<h1>Newbie File</h1>
This is the "newbie" file for the vintagebus list. We get a lot of
subscribers who are new (or fairly new) to the Internet. If you've
never been on a mailing list before, you are STRONGLY encouraged to
read this file. 

<h2>MAILING LISTS -- what they are, how they work</h2>
Mailing lists are the oldest information "protocol" on the net. They
take place entirely through email messages. Very basically, here is how
the "mechanics" work: 

<ul>
<li>a subscriber like you sends an email message about buses to a
"reflector". The "reflector" is usually called the list server or
listserv.
<li>the server takes your single email message and re-sends it to every
subscriber on the list. This is done with automated software; there is
no human intervention.
<li>the other subscribers can then read your message as if you had sent
it straight to them. They can reply to you only, or they can reply to
the list, in which case the whole process repeats itself (or of course
they may chose to not reply at all).
</ul>

<h2>THE LIST SERVER -- understand how it works</h2>
The server--the "machine" that distributes the list to its
subscribers--is software, just like the software you use every day on
your computer. When you use your software, you control it by clicking
on icons or choosing options from menus or typing input. 

<p>You can also control the list server, just like you can control your
own programs. Like all other software, list servers exist for the sole
purpose of doing what humans want done.

<p>But the list server is just a little different because it doesn't
live on your computer, so you can't point and click. The list server
lives somewhere else--it can be anywhere in the world. So instead of
pointing and clicking, you tell the list server what to do by sending
commands to it in email messages. The server will receive your message,
extract the command from it, and act on it. Then it will usually send
you back a "receipt" so you know your command was succesful. Pretty
cool, no?

<p>There aren't that many commands because list servers are not very
complicated (at least as far as the subscribers are concerned). The
only commands you really need to worry about are subscribe (which
starts the list mail coming) and unsubscribe (which stops it). The
important thing is to understand that the server is just a bit of
software. Now we'll talk about how to control that software.

<h2>THE LIST IS NOT THE SERVER -- there's a big difference</h2>
This is where many newbies get tripped up. The LIST is where you send
messages about buses. The LIST SERVER is where you send administrative
commands, like unsubscribe. The way you can tell them apart is that
they have DIFFERENT EMAIL ADDRESSES. This will be true for every
mailing list you will ever be on. 

<p>In our case, list messages should always be sent to this
address--this is the address of the "reflector":
<blockquote>vintagebus@type2.com</blockquote>
And here is the list servers addresses for each command you may want to 
issue: 
<blockquote>vintagebus-request@type2.com (if you are not on
digest)</blockquote>
or 
<blockquote>vintagebus-digest-request@type2.com (if you are on
digest)</blockquote>

See? Adding "-request" to the list address makes the mail go to the server
instead of the list. This will work with all other lists you'll come across, too; while there 
are lots of different mailing list software schemes out there, sending 
mail to listname-request@host will nearly always work--and if it doesn't, 
it will get you an automated response that tells you what you need to do 
differently.  The important thing is to NEVER post administrative
commands to the list. It won't do what you want done and it will make the
subscribers and the administrator angry.

<h2>THE DIGEST -- messages within messages</h2>
Most lists come in two flavors. You can get the list in "individual
message" flavor. If you choose this one, you get each list message as
it's posted. This lets you see each message immediately and it makes
replying somewhat easier. The downside is that it can cause serious
mailbox clutter, especially on busy lists like ours, and it takes up a
lot more space on your disk because of all the useless header
information you'll get. Understand that dealing with colossal amounts
of data is a learned skill--and if you haven't honed that skill yet, we
strongly suggest that you get the list in digest flavor. 

<p>In "digest" flavor, the server packs up lots of individual messages
in one big one. Our digests come out 4 times a day: 8am ,12pm, 4pm, and 
10pm EST/EDT. This usually contains about 20 messages [or?],
but it could be more and could be as few as three. If there are no 
messages ready when the digest comes out you won't receive one.
<p>If you want to switch to digest, send an unsubscribe message to:
<blockquote>type2-subscribe@type2.com</blockquote>
and then send a subscribe message to: 

<blockquote>type2-digest-unsubscribe@type2.com</blockquote>
If you subscribed from the type2.com web page [CHECK THIS?], you're 
already on digest so you should probably just leave it. If you really want 
to switch to real-time, you can infer the way to do it from what I just 
told you. If you can't figure it out, you should definitely stay on 
digest. ;) 

<p>The downside to digest mode is that when you reply to a message, you
have to paste in an appropriate subject line. If you forget to do this,
your message will be intercepted by the server (which knows to search
for these) and returned to you.

<h2>YOUR MAIL PROGRAM -- understand how it works</h2>
It is crucial that you understand this. I'm not gonna ask you to read
the documentation that came with your mail program because I've never
read mine either, but I am going to ask you to experiment a little. 

<p>You MUST know who you are replying to when you reply to a list
message.

<p>You can end up with any of three sorts of reply:

<ul>
<li>you can reply to the <b>list only</b> (not recommended but not
discouraged)
<li>you can reply to the <b>sender of the message only</b> (we'll go
over this)
<li>you can reply to <b>both the sender and the list</b> (we'll go over
that too)
</ul>

Your reply will go to the addresses in the "To:" and the "Cc:" lines of
your reply. "Cc:" means "carbon copy" and in practice it is exactly the
same thing as "To:". All mail programs let you see and edit these
header lines. MAKE SURE that your message is going where it should go. 

<p>You should reply to the <b>sender of the message only</b> if your
reply might not be interesting to everybody on the list. Examples:

<p>"I have one of those gizmos you're looking for."

<p>"I'm interested in buying the barndoor you're advertising for sale."

<p>"Way to go, Bubba!"

<p>"I think when we go camping at Mountain Meadows we should bring
plenty of toilet paper."

<p>You should reply to the <b>both the sender and the list</b> if your
reply contains information that you think will be useful to everybody
on the list. The reason you reply to both is to make sure the sender
sees your message; he'll get your reply by private mail even if he
misses it on the list. Examples:

<p>"The total advance of the 009 differs, depending on whether it's
German or Brazilian."

<p>"I had a bad experience with Shyster Mail-Order Parts, too. Here's
what happened."

<p>I said I was going to ask you to experiment: figure out what the
reply options are in your particular mail program. Try different things
and WATCH YOUR HEADERS. Usually, you can choose between "reply" and
"reply to all", but see what works for you. Do not send messages that
don't turn out right, of course. Delete those and start over.
