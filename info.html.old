<h3>News</h3>
<strong>4 October 2003:</strong> <b><u>type2.com is moving!</u> No, really!</b>
We will be down for 2 to 3 days starting approximately 16 October while our ISP
changes data centers.  This will affect type2.com, vintagebus.com,
and the Type2 and VintageBus mailing lists - neither the sites nor
the mailing lists will work for a few days around the end of this
week.  Current list subscribers do not need to do anything.

This will come back.  The AIRS link at left still works.  I just feel
that right now, the idea of "rescue squad" should be reserved for the
folks digging it out.  Matt Roberds 9/14/01
