		CONFIGURING THE DATABASE:<br>
		(If you're looking for a true primer on mySQL, this probably isn't the place)<br>
		<br>
		1. Create the database using this mySQL command from within the mySQL command line interface:<br>
		CREATE DATABASE realestate_db;<br>
		... this was impossible to automate, as some hosting services restrict the naming of databases.<br>
		2. Make sure your common.php file is configured correctly (as defined above)<br>
		3. Run the configurator by going to http://yoururl.com/configurator.php<br>
		It should take care of all the configuration for you, and create a sample listing.<br>
		if not, you can do this by hand by typing &quot;mysql realestate_db &lt; ./admin/configurator.sql&quot; (without the quotes, of course). It is highly recommended that you remove configurator.php, configurator.sql, and upgradasaurus.php from your site when not in use.<br>
		Also, sometimes, if you're using a program like phpMyAdmin, you need to add the lines one at a time... sometimes with a ; after each line as well. Play around with it...<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS:<br>
		* I'm alose running OpenRealty. Can I the two programs share user databases?<br>
		Absolutely. You've gotta do it by hand, but just add the vehicles table to whatever database you're using for OpenRealty. They can share images, agents, etc...<br>
		<br>
		* Where can I go for help with this?<br>
		Drop by our discussion forums at <a href="http://jonroig.com/freecode/openrealty/bbs/bbbb.php3">http://jonroig.com/freecode/openrealty/bbs/bbbb.php3</a> for help with any issues. I also post new developments there. As I work quite a bit at a fulltime job, please <b>DO NOT</b> email me with questions -- I will not have time to answer them.<br>
		<br>
		* Can you redesign this program to work as a general classifieds ads program?<br>
		I get this one a lot. Over the long run, that might be a plan... but I've seen a lot of inexperienced programmers use this script as a base for all kinds of odd things -- it's actually pretty cool. If you get stuck, just post on the message board and I'm sure someone will help you. 'Course, if you do come up with something interesting, it'd be cool if you'd contribute your work to the opensource community and release it under the GPL.<br>
		<br>
		* Is this program really free?<br>
		It sure is. I started by building a RealEstate listings program (http://jonroig.com/freecode/openrealty/) and ended up with a much more popular program than I'd anticipated. It's become a calling card, of sorts...<br>
		<br>
		* Are you planning further revisions on this program?<br>
		I am currently planning to do one further revision on this to convert the code over to Object Oriented Programming standards. Users of the most current version won't notice any difference, I'm just going to make the code a bit prettier.<br>
		<br>
		* Is it possible to add more than one picture to a listing?<br>
		Yes! You can put HTML into your preview description and full description. Just link to images from there like you'd link to any other images.<br>
		<br>
		* There are a whole bunch of fields I don't care about --. can I get rid of them?<br>
		If you leave those fields blank, no information will appear. As a user, you'd never know they were even there. Play around with it to see how it works.<br>
		<br>
		* I want to customize OpenAutoListings -- what advice do you have?<br>
		Make a copy first. I've tried to make OpenAutoListings really easy to play with, if you're so inclined. 'Course, I am also available to do various types of custom coding as well, so if you need those kinds of services, send me email. That said, if you're familiar with HTML, take a shot at customizing it yourself. I've documented a big chunk of the code, so it shouldn't be too hard to figure out what various pieces do. Although several people have suggested that I integrate some kind of template system into OpenAutoListings, I decided against this. The user really only sees a handful of actual pages, so it seemed kind of silly. In browse.php and propview.php, I've marked the placement of the header and footer parts of the HTML. Happy hacking!<br>
		<br>
		* No offense, but I don't like your browse.php page. How can I link to specific queries within the database?<br>
		None taken. Feel free to experiment with code you appropriate from that page -- it's there as an example. Here are some cut and paste examples of how to structure searches:<br>
		<br>
		* I have multiple agents running on one computer. How do I logout?<br>
		Just add a link in your template to logout.php. That should close out the session...<br>
		<br>
		* Is there a version that works with PHP3?<br>
		NO! UPGRADE TO THE NEW VERSION!!!! AGGGGGHHHHHGGHGH (sorry -- I get this question constantly.) It's not like PHP4 is new or anything, and it's not like it's not a stable program.<br>
