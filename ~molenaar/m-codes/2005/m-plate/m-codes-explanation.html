<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The M-codes tell you in which way a bus is
different from the standard serial version. The 'M' in M-code stands for <i>'Mehr- und Minderausstattung'</i>.
This is German for <i>'extra and reduced equiment'</i>. In most cases the code stands for an optional extra installed
on the vehicle, in a few cases it is something that was left out. A common example of something
that was left out is M248: "ignition lock without steering lock".</p>
<p>The list has been cut into four sections. Three sections show the codes that only contain numbers. The fourth section
lists the codes that start with a letter. These 'letter codes' either identify a specific SO-conversion like a Westfalia campmobile
or they represent a group of M-codes.
