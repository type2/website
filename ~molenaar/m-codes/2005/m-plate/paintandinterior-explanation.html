<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Paint and interior 
  codes</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The paint and interior code 
  consists of 6 numbers or letters. In most cases the code is put together like 
  this:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>PPPPUU</strong></font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 'PPPP' indicates the 
  paint code and the 'UU' stands for the interior code. The exception to this 
  system are the buses that have a special paint instruction ('<em>Sonderlackierung</em>') 
  and were built in the model years 1968-1971. In these cases all six digits were 
  used for the paintcode. More information on this can be found in under <a href="paintandinterior-special.php" target="paintandinterior">special 
  paint codes</a>.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The paint code on regular 
  bus can be split in two parts. First the colour for the lower part of the body 
  is printed, then the colour of the upper body part. It depends on the model 
  year to determine where the border lies between the two colours. On 1968-1970 
  models it is the rain gutter, on 1971-1979 it is below the belt line, which 
  is about 10cm below the windows.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Below are two examples of 
  late model buses and their codes:</font></p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<table border="0" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="1">
  <tr>
    <td><img src="jpg/t2_colors_sticker.jpg" width="128" height="412">&nbsp;</td>
	<td width="20">&nbsp;</td>
    <td valign="top"><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Paint 
        sticker and 'L-codes'</strong></font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In both the list of 
        the regular and the list of the special paint codes are codes mentioned 
        that start with an L: '<strong>L-codes</strong>'. The L-code and the name 
        of the colour in German are printed on the paint sticker below the M-plate. 
        The L-code is usefull if you want to order paint at a paint shop. The 
        code printed on the M-plate is completely useless for this purpose. It 
        was only used in VW sales brochures and booklets.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The paint sticker 
        is fixed on the metal partition behind the driver seat (passenger seat 
        on RHD vehicles). On 1968-1976 models this is actually right below the 
        M-plate. See the example on the left. The sticker is made of paper which 
        makes it voulnerable, it has often disappeared</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The paint sticker 
        shows one colour name if one colour was used for the entire body. If a 
        roof colour was applied it would also appear on the sticker. The font 
        used to print the colour name and the L-code varies over the years. Also 
        the way of writing varies. Sometimes the 'L' was left away. In other cases 
        the L-code was printed without spaces, for example: 'L 90 D' was used, 
        but also 'L90D'.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Buses with a Sonderlackierung 
        normally didn't have a paint sticker. If the colour used was a regular 
        Volkswagen colour the sticker would be fixed anyway, Westfalia buses are 
        an example of this. Only in model year 1978 and 1979 buses with a Sonderlackierung 
        got paint stickers as well listing both the colour name and the L-code.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The picture on the 
        left shows the position of the M-plate and the sticker in a 1976 bus. 
        The plate reads &quot;E1E1&quot; (color lower and upper part is &quot;Bright 
        Orange&quot;). The sticker says &quot;leuchtorange L 20 B&quot;. This 
        is the German name for the colour. &quot;L 20 B&quot; is the colour code.</font>
