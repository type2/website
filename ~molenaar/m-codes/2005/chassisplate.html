        The chassis plate is fixed behind the passenger seat. The plate shown 
        here is a regular chassis plate fixed in buses that were made and assembled 
        in Germany. Not every bus had this plate when it left the factory. Here 
        are several reasons:</font> 
      <ul>
        <li><font color="#333333" size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2"> 
          </font><font color="#333333" size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2">For 
          certain export markets the buses were standard deliverd with M912, meaning 
          'no chassis plate'. In this case you will find only two holes on the 
          spot where the chassis plate should be. North American buses were also 
          delivered without chassis plate from approximately model year 1975 onwards.</font> 
          </font> </font></li>
        <li><font color="#333333" size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2">Buses 
          for the English market often have a larger chassis plate with the text 
          in English instead of German.</font> </font></li>
        <li><font color="#333333" size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2">Buses 
          assembled overseas had the German chassis plate in some cases. However, 
          it is also possible that the plate is one from the overseas factory 
          and looks completely different. These specific plates can be found on 
          South African and Australia buses.</font></font></li>
      </ul> <p> </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
	<td><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The vehicle type is 
      mentioned on the plate after the word 'Typ'. In most cases this number is 
      the same as the first two numbers in the model code (see M-plate). There 
      are a few exceptions. Sometimes a specific M-code is mentioned after the 
      type number. For example: '<strong>Typ 23-517</strong>' is a VW Kombi (type 
      <strong>23</strong>) with Westfalia campmobile interior (M-code <strong>517</strong>).</font></td>
