<b>The Story</b><p>
<dd>
It must have been somewhere in 1998 when we first spotted this panelvan. We were passing along
on route N351 through the tiny village of Nijetrijne. Spotting a junked T2 in the Netherlands is
an experience that has become quite rare so we agreed to take a look. Unfortunately the junkyard
was closed. We decided to return a few weeks later.

During the second visit we were more successful. The owner was there and was willing to talk to us.
He wasn't quite a person of many words and when we asked him about the T2 his first question was:
"which part do you need?". Just to have an excuse to take a closer look to the van I replied "I am
looking for a windshield, can I have a look?". Too bad the other junked vehicles were parked real
close to the panelvan to have a good look at it. I asked him what he wanted for the whole car.
It seemed that he didn't really want to answer that question. He started a story about how rare these vans are
nowadays. A certain person had already offered him fl 600,- (US$ 300,-) for it but he refused to sell
because he thought the van was worth much more. I thought he should have sold it right away because
this is the best offer to get when you own such a piece of junk.<p>

Then I asked the junkyardowner how much he wanted to have for the VW-logo and the windshield. "The
windshield is fl 200,-", he didn't seem to be willing to sell the logo, actually I had the idea
he didn't want to sell the van at all, so I gave up. We stood there for a little while, then the
owner asked me if I had an idea when this car was built, I said "looking at the doorhandles and the
dashboard in the bodywork colour I'd say it's a 1969 model", "No", he said, "it's from 1954". "WOW! This must be
a really rare prototype!"<p>

In September 2001 I was cruising the roads in the neighbourhood of Nijetrijne again for my work. I
couldn't resist to go to Nijetrijne again. The van was still standing there. Perhaps it would
be nice to pay the junkyard another visit.<p>

A week later we were there again. Again we asked the man how much he wanted to have for his "1954"
panelvan. He replied "600 guilders", we said "no way!". We offered him half of that amount which I
thought was actually pretty much as well since there didn't seem to be a lot of items on the car that
could still be used. He refused our generous offer. But he also said to us that he was going to clean
the place up and was going to stop his junkyard business.<p>

A few weeks later I was, again, in the neighbourhood for my work. Curious on the status of the junkyard
I drove by Nijtrijne again. the junkyard was empty, except for a few cars and the 1969 panelvan! I called
the junkyard owner to see if I could negotiate about the price. This was hard. He still wanted more than I
offered. A second phonecall was needed to finish the negotiations and I became the proud owner of a 1969
Velvet green panelvan. Actually this is the T2 of my dreams: a Velvet green panelvan, too bad large vital
pieces of metal had corroded into eternity. The only reason I bought this car is to save the useable parts
from a certain shredded future.<p>

While parting out the van we discovered how rusty this car actually was. The cabin doors on both sides
had been almost split into two parts: an interior part and an outside bodywork part. The front of the
car was corroded away on almost every corner: the windshieldrim, the cabindoor sides, around the headlamps
and around the fresh air inlet. Also the chassis of the car was by far the most rusty T2-chassis I have
ever seen. All the hallow-chassis beams had rustholes in them. There were a few surprises though:<p>

<dl><lu>
  <dd>
  <li>The rear hatch was in perfect shape! No corrosion at all. The stamp in the lower rim of the
      hatch said "7 68" (manufactured in July 1968)
  <li>The fuel tank looked brand new! The room it was located in looked like it came fresh from the
      factory: no traces of corrosion, fresh and shiny Velvet green paint and not even a trace of dust. The
      tank sender unit was manufactured in november 1968.
  <li>Even though the van had been standing in the mud up to its axles for a few years...the front-axle unit
      was in a great shape. No rust holes at all!

Here's the data from the M-plate. It's fixed behind the drivers seat in every T2 from 1968 until
1976. Most of the info can also be found on the birthcertificate from the VW-Museum.<p>
