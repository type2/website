<b>The Story</b><p>
<dd>
My very first car: a 1978 Kombi. It used to be Taiga Green which I hated, so
I turned it into this type of green by simply using a 'roller' and metal-paint. The paint turned out not
to be such a god idea when you decide you want to remove it again.<p>

<dl>
Since I bought the 6-UP, it has been upgraded several times. First it got new cabin doors plus a new rear hatch.
But then the real upgrading started by adding the following items:<p>
<lu>
<dd>
	<li>rear window defroster
	<li>headrests
	<li>original VW 3-point seatbelts
	<li>blower to boost the hot airflow while waiting for traffic lights
	<li>ventilation windows in passenger compartment
	<li>fresh air pipes to passenger compartment
	<li>mum-made curtains
	<li>Westfalia trailer-hitch
	<li>Westfalia SO-67 interior from 1969
	<li>rear fog lamp to warn car-drivers in rear for 6-UP not being elephant<br>
		(used to have the "leaking exhaust option" for that purpose)

</lu>
</dl>
<p>
Unfortunately I can't drive it anymore. It has soo many spots where it needs welding to pass inspections,
I decided to concentrate on my other vehicles until I have money to get some professional equipment to
finish the job. Looking at the quality of the bus it should actually be junked, but I got attached to it
after all those years that I do not want to part with it. So now it's resting somewhere in a dusty
barn in the north.<p>
