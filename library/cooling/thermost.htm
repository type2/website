<h3>The Air-Cooled Thermostat Explained</h3>

wondering if I need one..."</i></font></blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Any engine when it warms up expands in size--
watercooled or aircooled, it doesn't matter. It's also important
that an engine warms up to operating temperature as quickly as
possible. Why? A cold engine is an engine with more friction and
the faster the warm up, the less sludge that builds up in the oil
from combustion. There's also another reason in an aircooled VW -
Expansion rates. Aluminum expands faster than steel or iron, so
your heads expand faster than your cylinders. The thermostat allows
both to expand evenly (or as near evenly as the VW engineers could
account for).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Also, when the thermostat is closed, i.e., not
as much air pushing over the engine allowing it to warm up, you use
less horsepower. Yes, it takes horses to push the cooling fan, when
the thermostat is closed, it takes less power. So, in colder
climates you may find the thermostat is mostly or fully closed
during operation. When the engine warms up, it opens and the flaps
open up.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">One area that VW didn't do a very good job on is
the Type IV cable assy. This has to be checked, and is the weak
link in the Type IV system. However, a properly operating
thermostat and flap system Type I, II, III or IV will insure faster
warm ups, reduced wear and reduced sludge build-up.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Remember the classic experiment describing air
pressure that used an old paint can?: Fill the can with water, heat
it to produce steam, then seal the can up. Now, cool the can
quickly (or slowly)...and what happens? The can crushes due to low
air pressure (the steam condensing inside the can) and high air
pressure outside. The same thing happens with the VW thermostat.
They're filled, and heated and brazed expanded, which forces the
normal air pressure out. The gas produced from the liquid (not
water, but something with a lower boiling point) pushes the air
out. The brazing seals the chamber and then when cool, the
thermostat collapses. When you re-introduce air (i.e., puncture),
the thermostat expands because the metal is under force to be
collapsed.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">As for thermostats failing constantly, I haven't
had but one fail in nearly 20 years of tinkering with these things.
It was my fault as well as I didn't get the expansion bracket
properly aligned and the thing bowed out. It still didn't burst,
just expanded way beyond the norm. That's what the expansion
bracket is for. When installing it keep it vertical....</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">As St. Berg once stated: "If it cost $5 to put a
part on and it wasn't Necessary, VW could have saved over
$50,000/day by leaving it off."</font></p>
