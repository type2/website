<h3>Thermostat Design</h3>

<p><font size="+1">The thermostats work with a liquid (probably an
alcohol) that is a liquid below the thermostat's set temperature
and a gas above that temperature. When the temperature drops below
the set temperature, the alcohol attempts to liquify. This lowers
the pressure inside the thermostat, which causes the atmospheric
pressure outside to push the can to the collapsed position. Thus,
the thermostat uses atmospheric pressure to push it to the closed
position.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The partially collapsed thermostat wasn't caused
by having too much alcohol. The amount of alcohol is not terribly
important to the operation of the thermostat, as long as some is
present and (important part here!) no other substances are inside
the thermostat.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">My theory is that this thermostat has a tiny
leak and that air has found its way into the thermostat through
that leak. It's unlikely that the alcohol would come out, since
there is a partial vacuum inside the canister when it is cold (the
canister is new, and never warmed up).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The air in the canister would never liquify, so
the canister would never get any smaller than the air volume
inside. The alcohol in the canister would expand the canister to
its correct length if it were heated.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I'd hate to try to fix one. You'd need a vacuum
pump and the correct alcohol, along with some way of opening and
sealing the canister.<br></font></p>
