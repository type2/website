<LI>Keep the engine and transmission clean, particularly the
area of the lower tins.  Grime and road crud are effective heat insulators.
<p>
<LI>Not obvious, but your tires, suspension components, and wheel
bearing all effect engine performance.  Simple maintenance can
do quite a bit to keep this from being a problem.  Recent postings
from individuals who replaced their wheel bearings, and then
noticed a surprising increase in gas mileage, shows what this can  do.
<p>
<LI>For Pete's sake, slow down.  Unless you have installed a larger
engine, external oil cooler, .... you have an engine which was
not made to run at Interstate speeds.  Get off the Interstate
find some good two lanes, and enjoy the drive.
