<h3>Cooling Tips</h3>

<li><font size="+1">Keep the engine and transmission clean,
particularly the area of the lower tins. Grime and road crud are
effective heat insulators.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Not obvious, but your tires, suspension
components, and wheel bearing all effect engine performance. Simple
maintenance can do quite a bit to keep this from being a problem.
Recent postings from individuals who replaced their wheel bearings,
and then noticed a surprising increase in gas mileage, shows what
this can do.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">For Pete's sake, slow down. Unless you have
installed a larger engine, external oil cooler, .... you have an
engine which was not made to run at Interstate speeds. Get off the
Interstate find some good two lanes, and enjoy the
drive.</font></li>
