Adjusting your thermostat is pretty simple.  But first you have to get at it.
To do that, you'll have to remove the rear section of the lower tin-ware on
the passenger-side of the engine.

<p>Once you have access to the thermostat and its bracket, remove the bolt
securing the thermostat bellows to the bracket.  The engine should be cool and
the thermostat  bellows fully closed when you do this.

<p>With the bellows free in the bracket, LOOSEN the nut holding the bracket to
the stud that projects from the side of the crankcase.  You want to be able to
slide the bracket up & down but the nut must be firm enough to hold the
bracket in position when you let go.  Now check your flaps to make sure they
are FULLY OPEN.  The procedure here varies according to the year you have.
The basic idea is that when the rod attached to the bellows is pushed UP the
flaps will be pushed OPEN, so one way to check is to simply push the rod up as
far as it will go.  It should stay there, thanks to the spring attached to the
connecting rod linking the two pairs of flaps.

<p>Fully up -- fully open -- is the HOT position.

<p>Notice how the bracket completely surrounds the bellows?  What you want to do
is cause the upper part of the bracket to just touch the upper part of the
bellows.  In practice, the bracket serves to prevent the bellows from
expanding too far, which can cause the bellows to crack.

<p>When you have the bracket properly positioned, tighten down the nut.  

<p>Now comes a bit of fumbling.  Reach up, grasp the bellows and pull it DOWN,
rotating it as needed to cause the flat-sided boss on the bottom of the
bellows to mate with the hole in the bottom of the bracket.  The flat-sided
boss prevents the bellows from rotating, which would cause it to unscrew
itself from the actuating rod.

<p>If the bellows can't be pulled down far enough to mate with the bracket, you
can back-off a few turns from the rod.  But insure you have at least six full
threads of engagement (more is better).

<p>Insert a short 8x1.25mm bolt with a suitable FLAT washer, plus a warpy washer,
into the threaded hole on the bottom of the bellows and tighten it down while
holding the bellows firmly aligned in the flat-sided hole.  The flat washer
must be large enough to span the boss on the base of the bellows and contact
the bracket, otherwise the thing will simply spring back up.

<p>That's all there is to it.   The first time you do it, take as long as it
takes.  Once you've done it a few times, it takes only a couple of minutes to
set the adjustment.

<p>When pulling the engine for maintenance that involves removal of the blower
housing, it's usually most convenient to remove the thermostat from its
bracket and to unscrew it from its rod as part of dropping the engine, when
the vehicle is hoisted up and there is room to get at the underside.  For the
same reason, it makes good sense to hold-off re-installing the thermostat and
lower tin-ware until you replace the engine in the vehicle.

<p>The short bolt and large-diameter flat washer used to secure the thermostat to
its bracket are somewhat unique.  It's a good idea to keep them with the
bellows.
