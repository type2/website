<h3>Thermostat Adjustment</h3>
<p>by Robert S. Hoover</p>

<blockquote><font size="+1"><i>"How does one adjust a thermostat
properly?"</i></font></blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Adjusting your thermostat is pretty simple. But
first you have to get at it. To do that, you'll have to remove the
rear section of the lower tin-ware on the passenger-side of the
engine.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Once you have access to the thermostat and its
bracket, remove the bolt securing the thermostat bellows to the
bracket. The engine should be cool and the thermostat bellows fully
closed when you do this.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">With the bellows free in the bracket, LOOSEN the
nut holding the bracket to the stud that projects from the side of
the crankcase. You want to be able to slide the bracket up & down
but the nut must be firm enough to hold the bracket in position
when you let go. Now check your flaps to make sure they are FULLY
OPEN. The procedure here varies according to the year you have. The
basic idea is that when the rod attached to the bellows is pushed
UP the flaps will be pushed OPEN, so one way to check is to simply
push the rod up as far as it will go. It should stay there, thanks
to the spring attached to the connecting rod linking the two pairs
of flaps.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Fully up -- fully open -- is the HOT
position.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Notice how the bracket completely surrounds the
bellows? What you want to do is cause the upper part of the bracket
to just touch the upper part of the bellows. In practice, the
bracket serves to prevent the bellows from expanding too far, which
can cause the bellows to crack.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">When you have the bracket properly positioned,
tighten down the nut.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Now comes a bit of fumbling. Reach up, grasp the
bellows and pull it DOWN, rotating it as needed to cause the
flat-sided boss on the bottom of the bellows to mate with the hole
in the bottom of the bracket. The flat-sided boss prevents the
bellows from rotating, which would cause it to unscrew itself from
the actuating rod.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">If the bellows can't be pulled down far enough
to mate with the bracket, you can back-off a few turns from the
rod. But insure you have at least six full threads of engagement
(more is better).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Insert a short 8x1.25mm bolt with a suitable
FLAT washer, plus a warpy washer, into the threaded hole on the
bottom of the bellows and tighten it down while holding the bellows
firmly aligned in the flat-sided hole. The flat washer must be
large enough to span the boss on the base of the bellows and
contact the bracket, otherwise the thing will simply spring back
up.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">That's all there is to it. The first time you do
it, take as long as it takes. Once you've done it a few times, it
takes only a couple of minutes to set the adjustment.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">When pulling the engine for maintenance that
involves removal of the blower housing, it's usually most
convenient to remove the thermostat from its bracket and to unscrew
it from its rod as part of dropping the engine, when the vehicle is
hoisted up and there is room to get at the underside. For the same
reason, it makes good sense to hold-off re-installing the
thermostat and lower tin-ware until you replace the engine in the
vehicle.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The short bolt and large-diameter flat washer
used to secure the thermostat to its bracket are somewhat unique.
It's a good idea to keep them with the bellows.</font></p>
