<h3>Adapting Doghouse Oil Cooler to '69 Crankcase</h3>

<p><font size="+1">You must first change the stud on the top of the
case. Ask for a Step-Stud. This is a stud with the original 6mm
thread on one end and 8mm thread on the other end. Length would be
31mm. As a reference, the VW PN is N14402.1, shouldn't be more than
50 cents and these are used to repair the original 6mm Intake Studs
on Single Port Heads when the hole stripped and has to be re-tapped
to the next size up. Screw the 6mm end into the case so that the
8mm end is sticking out. Get a Self Locking Nut and a Spring
Lockwasher (8mm thread/13mm Hex) to secure the the cooler stand
there. In addition, you may have to *slightly* drill the "ears" on
the case to accomodate the two 8mm studs on the other side of the
cooler stand. Use 8mm Self Locking Nuts and Spring Washers there
too.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>DO NOT OVERTORQUE THESE NUTS.</b> Book calls
for 5 foot pounds. That's all that's needed. Otherwise you'll crack
the cooler stand, break the mounting ears on the case or at the
very least deform the seals from the case to the cooler
stand.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Re: oil cooler rubber seals:</b> What you
need are two seals with different sized ports on each side of the
seal. Large (10mm ID) side goes to the cooler stand, small (8mm ID)
side to the case. The other seals to use for the stand to the
cooler (if unattached) are indentically sized at 10mm ID on each
side. Both styles should be in the gasket set. IMPORTANT! Do not
use the real thick cooler seals that come in the gasket set - these
are for Type 3 Squareback/Fastback engines/coolers. If you do, you
will leak as the seals don't fit properly and they will
deform.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>METRIC HARDWARE LESSON #101</b>: Lastly, an
important note to all. PLEASE indicate the fasteners by their
thread diameter size, NOT the Hex size. This will go a long way to
properly identifying hardware when asking questions or placing an
order. A 10mm Hex Nut could be either 5, 6 or even 7mm thread (6 is
the most common), depending on it's application. Had a customer
order two dozen "#10" Hex Nuts one time and dumb-dumb me, I sent
him 10mm thread nuts (17mm Hex). I'm sure this would be a help to
any place you order or ask about fasteners.</font></p>
