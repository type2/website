<h3>Overheating Troubleshooting Guide for Air-Cooled VWs</h3>

<h3><font size="+1">* Why care?</font></h3>
<p><font size="+1">Unlike a watercooled engine, there is no
safeguard: watercooled engine will boil over and force car to stop,
thereby preventing further damage to engine. On the other hand,
unless equiped with an oil temp gauge, the driver of air-cooled
automobile will not know if temp suddenly goes up. Consequences of
overheating is first damage to gaskets and if it gets really hot,
breakdown of oil viscosity hence lubrication failure.</font></p>
<h3><font size="+1">* Is it really overheating?</font></h3>
<p><font size="+1">Gauges are not always accurate; try dipstick
test. Can you hold dipstick without burning your fingers? Verify
gauge calibration by plunging temp sender in boiling water (212 F,
100 C).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Note that you may not find out if your engine is
prone to overheating unless you drive it at cruising speed for at
least 1/2 hour. That's the time it takes mine to reach the steady
state temp.</font></p>
<h3><font size="+1">* What is a "correct" temperature?</font></h3>
<p><font size="+1">180 F: too cool; is the thermostat still
there?</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">180-210: peachy.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">210-250: can live with it; many busses w/ type4
engines get that hot under load in the summer.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">250-280: something is wrong and must be fixed;
however, viscosity of good synthetic oil should still be fine. If
it's after dark and I'm in East St. Louis, I keep on
driving.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">280 F: better stop; unless the oil pressure
light is on (in which case you must shut the engine off
immediately!), let the engine run. Glen Buhlman recommends that it
not be left idling, but that revving it will allow the fan to do a
better job of cooling the engine.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<h2><font size="+1">* Troubleshooting</font></h2>
<p><font size="+1">Problems can roughly be classified as either
cooling problems or as heat generation problem:</font></p>
<h3><font size="+1">* Cooling *</font></h3>
<p><font size="+1">- <b>hot summer day?</b> (duh)</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">- <b>driving in the wrong gear?</b> Remember
that for a given speed, higher engine rpm =&gt; faster cooling fan
=&gt; cooler engine.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">- <b>do you keep your engine lid open to "let
heat escape"?</b> Don't. For better cooling and to make work easier
for the fan (hence the engine), you need positive air
pressure.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">- <b>missing or damaged seal between engine and
engine compartment?</b> (you don't want to "recycle" hot
air.)</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">- <b>holes in tin</b>: are all seals and covers
there? At holes for sparkplug wires, oil pressure switch, CHT
sensor (on FI models), adjusting screw for alternator belt (type 4
engines)? Is all the tin there, correctly installed and tight? No
fastening screws missing? A listmember found that missing the seals
for the spark plug holes increased oil temp by 10-15 F. I've heard
that Corvair spark plug seals are superior to VW seals.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">- Kim Kariotis says: "Be sure the aux heater fan
is properly ducted to the engine. There are flapper valves in the
fan housing that prevent your cooling air from escaping through the
auxiliary fan via the ducts. No ducts, big leak, engine runs hotter
than it should."</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">- <b>oil cooler unobstructed and clean?</b>
Leaves and debris can be sucked in through the fan and cover up the
oil cooler; if the cooler is oily, dust will stick to it, impeding
air flow and acting as an insulator.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">- <b>do you have chrome valve covers?</b> Valve
covers are in contact with oil and work as oil coolers, *provided
they're black*.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">- <b>clean engine?</b> The goop under your
engine acts like an insulator; scrape it off.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">- <b>type of oil</b>: air-cooled engines are
also oil-cooled and some oil brands are better than others at
picking up heat in the engine and shedding it in the oil cooler. A
reputable source (Ed Hackett) told me that synthetics are better in
that regard, although some listmembers did not share that belief
based on their personal experience. (Note that synthetics are much
better at withstanding high temps, hence provide added protection
for overheating engines.)</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">- <b>amount of oil</b>: too little ain't good;
too much ain't good either.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Dennis Haynes says to keep it halfway between
the marks on the dipstick. If there's too much, it get's beaten
into foam, causing a drop in pressure and less cooling.</font></p>
<h3><font size="+1">* Heat Generation *</font></h3>
<p><font size="+1">- <b>timing</b>: check advance at idle and check
total advance, too. Compare with specs in Bentley. (Still not clear
to me if heat goes up steadily with total advance, or if the only
significant increase in heat is the jump at the detonation
threshold.) It is generally said that 29 deg total advance is safe
and that 32 is "pushing the envelope". I'm not sure if this applies
to type 1 engines only or to all VW air-cooled engines. When I
checked up the specs of the dual vacuum dizzy for my type4 in
Bentley, I found that 40 deg total advance is normal; unless I
misunderstood the figures...</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">- <b>lean running</b>: adjust carbs or, if you
have fuel injection, check for false air. False air is air that
sneaks into the intake manifold without first passing through the
air-flow meter; hence the computer underestimates the amount of
fuel to be injected. Possible sources of false air are an EGR valve
that was not disabled, say, after the EGR filter fell off; old,
leaky rubber boots at the air intake distributor, disconnected
vacuum hoses, etc.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">- <b>engine friction</b>: general condition of
the short-block; crankshaft endplay is said to be a good indicator
(provided it was not reset since the last rebuild). A smooth,
well-balanced engine will be more efficient and generate less heat.
Retorque the heads. If you suspect a bearing is going bad, have a
lab analyze your oil.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">- <b>non-engine friction</b>: poor aerodynamics
exacerbate the fact that required work is proportional to the
square of speed. Hence you need about 40% more hp to go 65 mph
instead of 55 mph. Reduce loss to friction in transmission by
replacing transmission fluid every 2 (?) years. Do wheels turn
easily? Check wheel bearings, look for binding brakes...</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">- <b>air-intake thermostat</b>: here's an exotic
one. I'm talking about the tiny thermostat located before the air
filter, which selects whether air destined for combustion should be
cool air from the engine bay or preheated air. (Often, on older
cars (non VW) there was no such thermostat, just a lever that could
be switched either to the "summer" or the "winter" position.) Now,
if this thermostat is stuck in the "preheat" position on an already
hot day, you'll be burning really hot air. A quick
back-o'-the-envelope calculation shows that a 2 liter engine
turning at 4,000 rpm will suck in 4,000 liters (that's about 1,000
gallons) of air every minute. That should be a lot of
btu's...</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">- <b>valves adjusted?</b> A tight exhaust valve,
for example, will never completely close and will let partially
unburned fuel escape into the exhaust system, which in turn gets
extremely hot. Moreover the loss of compression in that cylinder
translates into loss of power, hence requires more work from the
other 3 cylinders to keep up initial speed.<br></font></p>
