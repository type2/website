<h3>* Why care?</h3>
<p>
Unlike a watercooled engine, there is no safeguard: watercooled engine
will boil over and force car to stop, thereby preventing further damage to
engine.  On the other hand, unless equiped with an oil temp gauge, the
driver of air-cooled automobile will not know if temp suddenly goes up.
Consequences of overheating is first damage to gaskets and if it gets
really hot, breakdown of oil viscosity hence lubrication failure. 
<p>
<h3>* Is it really overheating?</h3>
<p>
Gauges are not always accurate; try dipstick test. Can you hold dipstick
without burning your fingers? Verify gauge calibration by plunging temp
sender in boiling water (212 F, 100 C).
<p>
Note that you may not find out if your engine is prone to overheating
unless you drive it at cruising speed for at least 1/2 hour. That's
the time it takes mine to reach the steady state temp.
<p>
<h3>* What is a "correct" temperature?</h3>
<p>
180 F: too cool; is the thermostat still there?
<p>
180-210: peachy.
<p>
210-250: can live with it; many busses w/ type4 engines get that hot under load in the summer.
<p>
250-280: something is wrong and must be fixed; however, viscosity of good synthetic oil should still be fine. If it's after dark and I'm in East St. Louis, I keep on driving.
<p>
280 F: better stop; unless the oil pressure light is on (in which case you must shut the engine off immediately!), let the
engine run. Glen Buhlman recommends that it not be left idling, but that revving it will allow the fan to do a better job of
cooling the engine.

<h2>* Troubleshooting</h2>
<p>
Problems can roughly be classified as either cooling problems or as heat generation problem:
<p>
<h3>* Cooling *</h3>
<p>
- <B>hot summer day?</B> (duh)
<p>
- <B>driving in the wrong gear?</B> Remember that for a given speed,
  higher engine rpm => faster cooling fan => cooler engine.
<p>
- <B>do you keep your engine lid open to "let heat escape"?</B> Don't. For better
  cooling and to make work easier for the fan (hence the engine), you need
  positive air pressure.
<p>
- <B>missing or damaged seal between engine and engine compartment?</B> (you
  don't want to "recycle" hot air.)
<p>
- <B>holes in tin</B>: are all seals and covers there? At holes for sparkplug
  wires, oil pressure switch, CHT sensor (on FI models), adjusting screw
  for alternator belt (type 4 engines)? Is all the tin there, correctly
  installed and tight? No fastening screws missing? A listmember found
  that missing the seals for the spark plug holes increased oil temp by
  10-15 F. I've heard that Corvair spark plug seals are superior to VW
  seals.
<p>
- Kim Kariotis says:
 "Be sure the aux heater fan is properly ducted to the engine. There are
  flapper valves in the fan housing that prevent your cooling air from
  escaping through the auxiliary fan via the ducts. No ducts, big leak,
  engine runs hotter than it should."
<p>
- <B>oil cooler unobstructed and clean?</B> Leaves and debris can be sucked in
  through the fan and cover up the oil cooler; if the cooler is oily, dust
 will stick to it, impeding air flow and acting as an insulator.
<p>
- <B>do you have chrome valve covers?</B> Valve covers are in contact with oil
  and work as oil coolers, *provided they're black*.
<p>
- <B>clean engine?</B> The goop under your engine acts like an insulator; scrape it off.
<p>
- <B>type of oil</B>: air-cooled engines are also oil-cooled and some oil brands 
  are better than others at picking up heat in the engine and shedding it
  in the oil cooler. A reputable source (Ed Hackett) told me that
  synthetics are better in that regard, although some listmembers did not
  share that belief based on their personal experience. (Note that
  synthetics are much better at withstanding high temps, hence provide
  added protection for overheating engines.)
<p>
- <B>amount of oil</B>: too little ain't good; too much ain't good either.
<p>
  Dennis Haynes says to keep it halfway between the marks on the dipstick.
  If there's too much, it get's beaten into foam, causing a drop in
  pressure and less cooling.
<p>
<h3>* Heat Generation *</h3>
<p>
- <B>timing</B>: check advance at idle and check total advance, too. Compare with
  specs in Bentley. (Still not clear to me if heat goes up steadily
  with total advance, or if the only significant increase in heat is the
  jump at the detonation threshold.)
  It is generally said that 29 deg total advance is safe and that 32 is
  "pushing the envelope". I'm not sure if this applies to type 1 engines
  only or to all VW air-cooled engines. When I checked up the specs of
  the dual vacuum dizzy for my type4 in Bentley, I found that 40 deg total
  advance is normal; unless I misunderstood the figures...
<p>
- <B>lean running</B>: adjust carbs or, if you have fuel injection, check for
  false air. False air is air that sneaks into the intake manifold without
  first passing through the air-flow meter; hence the computer
  underestimates the amount of fuel to be injected. Possible sources of
  false air are an EGR valve that was not disabled, say, after the EGR
  filter fell off; old, leaky rubber boots at the air intake distributor,
  disconnected vacuum hoses, etc.
<p>
- <B>engine friction</B>: general condition of the short-block; crankshaft
  endplay is said to be a good indicator (provided it was not reset since
  the last rebuild). A smooth, well-balanced engine will be more efficient
  and generate less heat. Retorque the heads. If you suspect a bearing is
  going bad, have a lab analyze your oil.
<p>
- <B>non-engine friction</B>: poor aerodynamics exacerbate the fact that required
  work is proportional to the square of speed. Hence you need about 40%
  more hp to go 65 mph instead of 55 mph. Reduce loss to friction in
  transmission by replacing transmission fluid every 2 (?) years. Do
  wheels turn easily? Check wheel bearings, look for binding brakes...
<p>
- <B>air-intake thermostat</B>: here's an exotic one. I'm talking about the tiny
  thermostat located before the air filter, which selects whether air
  destined for combustion should be cool air from the engine bay or
  preheated air. (Often, on older cars (non VW) there was no such
  thermostat, just a lever that could be switched either to the "summer"
  or the "winter" position.) Now, if this thermostat is stuck in the
  "preheat" position on an already hot day, you'll be burning really hot
  air. A quick back-o'-the-envelope calculation shows that a 2 liter
  engine turning at 4,000 rpm will suck in 4,000 liters (that's about
  1,000 gallons) of air every minute. That should be a lot of btu's...
<p>
- <B>valves adjusted?</B> A tight exhaust valve, for example, will never
  completely close and will let partially unburned fuel escape into the
 exhaust system, which in turn gets extremely hot. Moreover the loss of
  compression in that cylinder translates into loss of power, hence
  requires more work from the other 3 cylinders to keep up initial speed.
