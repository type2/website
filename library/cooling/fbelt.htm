<h3>Fan Belts</h3>

<p><font size="+1">Fan Belt substitutions: If you need a belt out
in the boonies, a 10mm by 930mm belt will replace the standard
9.5mm by 905mm belt if you put all of the shims between the pulley
halves.. The former belt can be found at NAPA distributors and is a
lot easier to find in Wyoming than the OEM Continental belt. In the
future I'll carry a spare Continental belt, as I like its fit
better. I'm also going to get a few more pulley shims to get a
wider range of adjustability.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">If you're unfortunate enough not to have a spare
belt and need one in an unknown town, this info might of benefit to
other "Upright Engine" Folks:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The 9.5x905 is just a hair over 35 1/2" long.
Gates is a popular & quality belt maker that seems to be
everywhere. Although Gates lists their PN 7355 as a replacement, I
have found that it to be just a little too tight, being 10mm (or
more) in the width. Better choice is a PN 7360 which is 36 inches
(914.4mm) long, fits and adjusts better. The factory supplied 8
shims for adjustment, but like Lyle, I always carry at least half a
dozen extras, just in case. (And I always carry two spare belts -
I'm just a little more paranoid I guess). 36 inch belts are used on
an enormous amount of rice-burners and are easier to
find.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The 9.5x905 belt is also available at the Volvo
dealer under PN 973547 as a last resort too. A Mercedes model
(don't know which) uses a 10x910mm (37 3/4 inch) belt as another
option - PN 006-997-02-92</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">When installing a new Continental 9.5x905 Belt,
I've usually found that 5 shims between the pulley halves is best
at first. After 100 miles, I check it and in most cases, remove at
least one shim to re-tension the belt correctly.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">This of course applies to stock crank pulleys &
stock OD degree pulleys --"your mileage may vary".</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Jim Thompson writes:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The way I was shown by several knowledgeable
Vee-dubbers (and it's worked for me for over 30 years) is to have
the outer portion of the belt just inside the pulley groove area
(about 1/8 of an inch) than to having it ride on the top of the
groove. If the belt is placed lower within the groove area of the
pulley, the belt tends to cause the pulley halves to work back and
forth, cutting and wearing out the center shaft area of the inside
pulley half. Most VW people (to include myself) know what the
resulting noise sounds like when a pulley explodes (or is getting
ready to) because the belt was not properly positioned and
tensioned. I've seen people with the belt riding high where the
belt enters the pulley on the left and then cuts severely through
the two pulley halves and exits out the right - not the proper way
to have your belt running.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Optional belts mentioned in my last post are for
TEMPORARY use only to get you out of a jam and until you find and
install the genuine Continental 9.5x905 which still works the
best.</font></p>

<blockquote><font size="+1"><i>"This is excellent information. It
did however jog a thought (ouch). The stock pulley/belt setup
should give a 1:1.9 ratio of crank to generator. This info is for
the 1500/1600 class, upright engines. If you run a worn belt, or
one that requires the pully be adjusted so the belt runs out at the
rim of the generator pully, you reduce your

<p><font size="+1"><i>You effectively reduce your fan speed, by
increasing the size of your generator pulley. As volume is
increased or decreased as a function of fan speed, this is one more
factor to examine if you feel your engine may run
hot."</i></font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Starting about 8 years ago, Continental began
changing their belt production to what they called "world
standardization". This means 12.5mm becomes 13mm, 9.5 becomes 10mm.
Almost all of the 9.5 belts I'm getting from Conti are 10mm now,
with the notable exception of the 905mm belt (40HP, 1300/1500/1600
applications), but I've been hearing that soon this will only be
available from Conti in a 10mm width as well. Volkswagen already
lists the 111-903-137D belt as a 10x905mm in their parts database.
Oh well.</font></p>
