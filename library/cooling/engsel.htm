<h3>Engine Compartment Seal (&lt;'71 Type 2)</h3>

<blockquote><font size="+1"><i>"I've just installed a new engine
perimeter seal, the flat kind with double rubber edges. I'm bugged
by the way it bunches up around the curved parts of the engine
apron (or whatever you call the body piece it attaches to). The
bunching up leads to gaps large enough to stick several fingers
through. Not a good situation for sealing. Am I doing something
wrong?"</i></font></blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">It's possible. Let's see if it was installed
correctly:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The Engine Surround Seal on 56-71 Buses is the
same as those used on the 45-66 Beetles and K Ghias. Installation
on a Bus/Pickup is a little different than on the Type 1 by doing
the following:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Notice that the seal is shaped like a "U".
Remove the Rear Apron. Slide one side of the "U" into the slot on
the body on the LEFT side of the Engine. Be sure that the double
flap of the seal has one flap on top of the Engine Tin and one flap
below the Engine Tin. At the end of the slot on the body, take a
sharp knife or tin snips and cut the seal. Now take the opposite
side of what's left of the "U" seal and repeat the process on the
right side of the engine.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">What's left over now is a "C" shaped piece that
installs into the slot on the Rear Apron. When installing this
piece, be sure that it is not "bunched" by forcing all of the
rubber into the slot. If the seal is completely in the slot and
there is "bunching", pull both ends of the exposed seal to reduce
or eliminate the bunching. Do not stretch the seal or in time (and
heat), the seal will prematurely deteriorate and you'll haveta
replace the darn thing again. Trim any excess seal left over on the
ends, but leave enough to overlap the two pieces it mates up to on
the left and right side of the engine. Be sure that when you
re-install the apron the upper flap goes on top of the Engine Tin
and the lower flap below it.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">If bunching persists, you may have gotten a
poorly made Brazilian Engine Surround Seal and I've never been able
to get them to work right. Use a good quality OEM or better yet a
USA Made seal like mine or WCM's.<br></font></p>
