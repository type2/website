Contact Dawn Smyth at PLF VW Canvas.  Nobody makes better VW canvas products.

Her Westy poptop canvas replacements are made with Sunbrella fabric, the same 
stuff used for the finest boat canvas work.  From personal experience with 
this material in an especially harsh marine climate I can attest to its near 
bulletproof characteristics.
