<h3>Dormobile Campers</h3>
<p>by Susan Crandall</p>

<p><font size="+1">Our favorite feature that was first available in
1962 is the Dormobile sleeping top. This is a fiberglass poptop
manufactured in England and installed at the Westfalia factory.
Rather than popping straight up it elevates to the side. <!--

<p><font size="+1">Usually the hard side of the top was on the
driver's side and the red and white horizontally striped (green and
white) tent side was to the double doors. The hard side of the top
had two operable fiberglass vents and two flat windows.</font></p>

Level with the roof of the bus are two cots that fold out from each
side. The cots will hold an adult but aren't really very wide. The
increased head room and walking room is fantastic and personally we
can't live without it anymore. Dormobile also manufactured their
own version of a camper with a very rustic kitchen across the back
and four unique swivel/reclining/fold down seats in the cargo area
of the bus that make two beds or connect to be a large bed or can
be removed completely. For a company with such a great top I never
figured out their spartan camper. <!--
