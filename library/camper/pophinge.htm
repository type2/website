<h3>Poptop Hinges</h3>
<p>by Karl von Salzen</p>
<hr size="2">
<p><font size="+1"><code>ALL 68 to 79 WESTY hinges are steel where
they mount to the body and the top. 68-72 westy hinges had tubular
supports made of aluminum, but the mounting parts are
steel.</code></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><code>Only the 68-73 front hinged pop tops used
rubber tie downs. Never on a 75 WESTY.</code></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><code>68-73 hinges are shorter and are not flat
along the bottom. They are curved to fit the contour of the front
of the roof. They are 18 3/4" long. They have 3 bolts holding them
to the roof, and 2 holding them to the top.</code></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><code>68-72 have tubular supports, they are weak
and bend.<br>
73 only are have flat stock steel, like 74+. Stronger.<br>
68 are one-year-only. They attached to the top using countersunk
wood screws.</code></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><code>The top ripped off real easy! Starting in
69, VW used carriage bolts that went thru the top. The hinge is now
flat where the nut and lockwasher sit. 68 only is not flat, has a
raised circle where the counter-sunk screw goes. Also, 68 was the
only year that VW put a vinyl strip between the paint and the
hinge.</code></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><code>74-79 hinges are 23 1/2" long. 3 bolts
hold it to the roof and 3 bolts on the top.</code><br></font></p>
