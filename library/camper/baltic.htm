<p><font size="+1">Need 3/32" plywood, 3 ply birch? try Aircraft
Spruce and Specialty Co. They have the right stuff. in various
sizes and thicknesses, in various woods. tough enough to survive
boiling water for three hours without delaminating. but it isn't
cheap. Full sheets must be cut in half for UPS, otherwise shipped
by truck.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Be careful of birch plywood. Almost all of it in
the USA is interior plywood. The glue is not water proof or water
resistant. Luan underlayment usually is. A quick test is to cut a
small piece and boil it for 15 minutes. If it doesn't come apart it
is OK.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">As I understand it there is some birch plywood
made in Finland that is exterior.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I wouldn't put interior plywood in a vehicle too
much chance of a leak.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">The best/only way to replace the westy ceiling
is by using BALTIC BIRCH. This is imported wood and thus comes not
on the 4 foot by 8 foot domestic size but the european standard
(about 5 feet). You must have this width to properly replace a
headliner. It is available in varing thicknesses (measured in mm).
It should be available from larger lumber suppliers. The price is
about twice that of US wood. But this is not a huge difference. It
is the original wood used for headliners. It is imported from
Russia and so is not hugely popular due to less than reliable
shipping practices. Treatment of the wood is just sealing or a
polyurethane coating. One could stain it to whatever shade of
course.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Another list member writes:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Any shop that sells to cabinet shops should have
Baltic Birch, it is becoming very popular for cabinet backs and
drawer sides. It is first class stuff with no voids tight patchs
and usually 7 plys, approx $20 a sheet. It is in metric sizes but
most places refer to it in standard 1/8, 1/2, Etc. I believe the
thin stuff specs at 3mm and is a direct replacement for factory
westy stuff. It is flexible along the grain but rigid against,
making it very strong. I would recommend using a polyester or
urethane sealer on both sides of the panel (good and bad side) to
prevent the grain from lifting if exposed to moisture.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">After combing the local lumber yards for 1/8
inch anything ("I didn't even know they made it that thin") I
finally found a place conversant in thin plywood. A marine lumber
store. I just about dropped dead when I asked the guy over the
phone if they sold 1/8 and he said, without that dreadful silence
we VW restorers come to know and love, "sure."</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">And it's Baltic Birch to boot. $14 for a 5X5
sheet. Cheeeep. The only other place I found that sold thin stuff
was a guy who said he had "aircraft" grade birch for the princely
sum of $65 a sheet. Know, I now my '70's gonna flat out fly when
it's finally running again, what with that balanced and bored
powerplant out back and flames painted on the side and all :0, but
I don't think I'll ever leave the ground. No need for aircraft
quality.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Clay writes:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">One point that most non-detail-carpentry-types
will forget or ignore is the fact that all plywood has a tendency
towards chipping.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">When cutting the 1/8" or 3mm Birch sheets, trace
your line, then put a strip of masking tape over the line. When you
cut, the tape will minimize the chipping.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Also, try to get a good jigsaw, like a Bosch.
Yep, same company... The Bosch allows you to zero out the
eccentricity of the bit, so that it cuts straight up and down
rather than pitching forward as it cuts. Works well for thin
materials.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">H. Steven Dolan writes:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Very true, if you have a router (and I do, and
the way Clay describes is how I would do it) *BUT* if you don't
have a router (which I didn't for many years), there are other ways
to keep plywood from splintering during a cut:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">OK, so you have it marked (on both sides of the
target piece), and you are about to jigsaw it along the
line.</font></p>
<ol>
<li><font size="+1">Be sure that you have the *bad* side up and
marked... that way even if it splinters, you don't care as much.
Jigsaws cut on the up stroke and are much more prone to splintering
on the top of the cut piece.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Apply a strip of masking tape along the good
(bottom) side lapping the cut line to hold it together, in
case.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Before you make that cut, take a utility knife
with a sharp (new) blade and cut just inside the marked line (like
a 32nd of an inch (or 1mm if you live in an advanced country
(damned English measurment system!!!))). The depth of the cut
should aim to sever the fibers in the top layer of the plywood.
Then, any chipping that *does* occur will be confined to that 1mm
wide strip</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Remember that to cut smoothly, there should be
at least 3 teeth in the work piece at all times. For 3mm plywood
you should have a maximum tooth spacing of 1mm. Despite the
recommendations on the package, this will often be a sheet metal
blade. This will cut slower, but smoother.</font></li>

<p><font size="+1">Jim Ellis writes:</font></p>
<blockquote><font size="+1"><i>"I also noticed that the coloration
of the "Golden Oak" stain differed between the real Baltic Birch
(that I used in most spots including the headliners)and the paper
thin veneer crap (that I used on the driverside long wall). The
veneer ended up looking browner. I barely wiped any stain on the
rest of the wood and it came out fine."</i></font></blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Steve Lashley responds:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">It is always a good idea to put a sealer coat on
any soft or very thin wood before you stain it. There are several
ways to do this, you can buy sealer made for this, or MinWax makes
a sealer/stain combo. I take the varnish or polyurethane and cut it
down by 50%, and lightly rub it on with a rag. After this dries,
you can apply the stain.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">You may want to test this on a scrap piece of
baltic birch first, because I don't think you will need it here,
but I would seal any veneer, or luan products before staining
it.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">You can also purchase non-yellowing varnish.
Even clear varnish products may yellow, so make sure the label says
it is non-yellowing.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I would also stay away from water based
polyurethane unless you want a totally clear finish with no
darkening. These products will make the wood look exactly like it
does before you apply the finish. Most oil based varnishes will
darken the wood a little. When I refinish furniture I count on the
final coat giving the wood a deep color to it, where it highlights
the grain. If you decide to use the water based poly, keep in mind
that you need to stain or seal it first to get the look you want
before you apply the top coat.</font></p>
