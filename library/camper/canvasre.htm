<h3>Canvas Replacement ('74-'79 Bus)</h3>
<p>by Robert Taylor</p>
<hr size="2">
<p><font size="+1">Here are a few of the pitfalls I discovered, for
your consideration in future canvas projects.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">1. The bugmesh goes on the OUTSIDE. Keep this in
mind when initially securing the canvas with a few staples lest you
do it inside out.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">2. If the vinyl strips around the inside top
have gotten too hard to drive staples through, improvise one of the
following solutions:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">a) Use 3/4" carpet tacks. I went this
route.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">b) Cut 1.25 inch wide strips from those long,
vinyl vertically hanging window louvers and use those in place of
the petrified vinyl strips.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">c) Get the thickest duct tape made, make a
triple layer of the stuff in a long 1.25 inch wide strip, and use
that in place of the petrified vinyl strips.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">d) Gain the use of an industrial type stapler,
either electric or pneumatic. Even the gnarliest spring-loaded
hardware store stapler probably isn't up to the chore.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">e) Boil the strips in water to soften them just
before stapling. This might work, but I didn't try it.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">3. You have to unbolt the support arms from the
poptop in order to deal with the front left and right edges. When
unbolted, the arms can be carefully propped in the front corners of
the top to support it. When so positioned, the poptop is lifted
about 1/2" less high than usual. If you staple/ tack the upper
edges of the poptop without accounting for this, the whole front
end will be too short once you have reconnected the support arms.
Leave yourself some extra room to account for this or you'll have
to unstaple/ tack the top edge, let some out, restaple/ tack, and
forevermore deal with a row of holes along the top edge that will
remind you of your folly from now until the end of time. (Ask me
how I know.)</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">4. There's not much room to work when screwing
down the rear portions of the canvas. An electric screwdriver may
not fit back there without a swivel joint. Small handheld
screwdrivers may work better.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">5. It helps to use a sharp thing (an awl or
nail, or tack) to poke holes through the lower edge and find the
screwholes beneath before you start trying to drive screws
in.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">6. It takes a deep socket (or otherwise small
outer diameter) socket wrench to unscrew the nuts holding the
square metal bar to the inside front ceiling of the poptop. And you
must remove this thing to get at the front edge of the canvas.
Check it out and be sure you have the right tool before you settle
down to do the job.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">In summary, the folks who installed your
original canvas at the factory had the benefit of doing hundreds
and thousands of these. But you will probably only do one, so you
won't have their practice and skill. Work slowly, allow more time
than you think it will take, and better a bit loose than
overstretched.<br></font></p>
