<p><font size="+1"><code>That pic from John Perry's site is from
me. The one on the left is from the 78/79 Deluxe [brown plaid], the
middle one is 74/75 [orange plaid], and the one on the right is
from my 77 Deluxe [green plaid].</code></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><code>The height difference is because the 76+
has a swivel pass seat, so the seats sit higher. The storage
box/stool, when in place between the seats, are even in
height.</code></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><code>Not sure where someone thinks the trash
container is red?!? Must be a bad case of color-blindness.....they
were all yellow. VERY rare.....I only have one. I saw one on ebarf
awhile back, had a cracked handle.....not sure what it sold
for..... each time the person put it up, it never met
reserve.</code></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><code>Early bay Westies came with 4 legged
stools.<br>
68-72 were honey opal naugahyde.<br>
73 were one-year-only mustard cloth.<br>
74/75 NON deluxe Westies were matching plaid.<br>
74 - 79 were plaid, the colors depended on the outer paint
color.<br>
74/75 Deluxe were the storage box style</code><br></font></p>
