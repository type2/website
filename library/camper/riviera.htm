<h3>Riviera Camper</h3>
<p>by Fred Stoermer and Charles "Luke" Lukey</p>

<blockquote><font size="+1"><i>"Riviera Motors was the Beaverton,
Oregon based regional distributor of Volkswagens. At some point
they decided to contract with ASI (Automotive Services, Inc.),
based in the Vancouver, Washington area, for Type 2 camper
conversions modeled after Westfalia Campmobiles. Why Riviera
decided to do this is a puzzle, because Campmobiles sold like
hotcakes in the Pacific Northwest."</i></font></blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Charles "Luke" Lukey responds:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">True - they sold so well that Riviera Motors
could not keep their downstream dealers supplied. VW offered the
following take-it-or-leave-it deal: You get X number of Westfalia
campers when you buy Y number of pickups and panel vans.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">This posed a problem to Knute Qvale, owner of
Riviera Motors. VW pickups and panels were slow movers, prone to
"lot rot." Knute knew a cabinet maker named Lasko and assigned him
to design and build a camper conversion that would work with the VW
panel. He then imposed a new regime on his downstream dealers: You
get X number of Westfalia campers when you buy Y number of my
"Riviera" campers.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The dealers were hesitant at first, but once
they'd seen the workmanship of the conversion, they got on board.
This was in 1965.</font></p>
<blockquote><font size="+1"><i>"Over the years the ASI conversions
became (in my opinion) more and more like mini-motorhomes, and less
like campers. ASI used their own poptop that is similar in
appearance to Westfalia's, but actually quite different in
execution. The cabinets, etc., were initially clones of Westfalia's
designs, but diverged over the years. All of the fittings,
hardware, etc. in ASI rigs are pretty standard mobile home/RV
stuff."</i></font></blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Mostly true. Every year the sales reps from
Westfaliawerk would arrive in Portland to see what new things Knute
was adding to his campers. Many of those ideas appeared in next
year's Westfalia. They exchanged ideas on what hardware held up and
what layout seemed to be popular. Westfalia also used off the shelf
RV parts, some still available in European RV shops.</font></p>
<blockquote><font size="+1"><i>"I believe they converted Type 2s
that were delivered to Riviera Motors by VW as Station Wagons. Two
of my friends drive late-'70s ASI conversions. Theirs, and others
I've looked over, show all the signs of having been built and
fitted out as Station Wagons, then stripped by ASI and reincarnated
as campers. I've never seen an ASI conversion with a reinforced
chassis, for instance, but I have seen ones that clearly had
originally been built with a sunroof."</i></font></blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">ASI campers, being much lighter than their
German counterparts, usually did not require a belly pan. I've seen
one that did, but as a double door panel, it would've had one
anyway.</font></p>
<blockquote><font size="+1"><i>"If ASI continued converting VWs
after the 1979 model year, I'm not aware of having seen one. That
may be because I haven't really paid much attention to
Vanagons."</i></font></blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">They continued on to the mid-80's. Al Lasko, son
of the original cabinet maker, is still in business in Vancouver.
He's been doing van conversions since demand for Vanagons petered
out a few years ago. I've got him on video, looking over the
interior of my Riviera and commenting on the originality of
it.</font></p>
