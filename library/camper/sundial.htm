<h3>Sundial Campers</h3>
<p>by Josh Rodgers</p>
<hr size="2">
<p><font size="+1">Sundial campers are most commonly recognized by
five (three on driver side, two on the passenger side) SINGLE pane,
pop-out windows rather than the LOUVERED style associated with the
Westfalia campers. Often, they have a third non-popout single pane
window on the passenger side.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Also, Sundial started with panel vans (VIN
begins 215) and cut windows into them whereas Westfalia pulled the
existing windows from a standard van, or Kombi (VIN begins 235).
For this reason, many purists scoff at the Sundial as a, "poor
modification toa perfectly good panel van". As with any product Vw
produced, Sundial also produced many campers from Kombis, and even
used louvered windows.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><img src="../images/sunlouv.gif"></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">So there really is no hard-set rule for
distinguishing these campers except for a badge found in the
interior.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><img src="../images/badge1.gif"></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The camper conversion company was American so
the interest in the Sundial is quite mixed. It is generally
regarded as an "inferior" conversion in quality compared to the
Westy, but it IS the most popular of the few American camper
conversions to VW vans. Possibly, pride in American work (whether
inferior or superior)and the American love for the "underdog" make
the Sundial as popular as it is.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Being the most well known American camper
conversion, many people mistakenly label their camper Sundial.
Pretty much all American converters used the same single paned
popout windows. The only real distinguishing factors are in the
interior. Some other American camper conversion companies that are
often confused with the Sundial include E-Z, Camper of America,
Riviera, Coleman, and Kit.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Due to the scarcity of the Sundial, I have seen
the original interior of only a few years of Sundials. Most
restorers opt to just use a Westfalia interior or else make a
completely custom interior for obvious reasons. I found an interior
picture of a 1964 Camper for sale that listee, David Easterwood,
pointed out to me to be a Sundial.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><img src="../images/so1964.gif"></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">This interior very highly resembles the <a href=
"so42.htm">SO-42</a> interior of my '65 Westy. Many Sundial owner's
note the bed for Sundial's (Z-style) to be more comfortable and
easier to operate than Westy beds.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><img src="../images/stevebed.gif"></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The exteriors of the Sundial are most commonly
an off-white color with the painted hub cabs and primered rear
interior. These details were standard from Germany for the panel
van as they were designed for commercial use. Possibly, more
popular than the Camper conversion itself, the infamous Sundial
Tent that came with the Sundial campers was unique in that it had a
fringed top w/ removable sides. Usually, they were wide green and
white perpendicular stripes.</font></p>

This is the '65 that Mike Mott tried to save. Notice again the
"Clamshell" lamp shade. Also, notice the unusual "Spice Rack" on
the door.</font>
