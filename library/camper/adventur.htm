What exactly is the difference between an Adventure Wagen  and a VW Safare? I would assume the manufacturers to start but after that what?

<P>
Adventurewagen and Safare both took plain VW busses from the factory and equipped them for
camping.  They had a similar style of foldout bed - a very nice design (I think) which folds up
into a U shape, unlike the Z-bed in the Westfalia.  They were both very well equipped, with
most of them having stoves, sinks, 12/110v electric refrigerators, onboard propane tanks, and
dual batteries.  Most had upper beds as well so they could sleep two adults and one large or
two small children.
<P>
Differences that I know of: 
<P>
Adventurewagen had several styles of highroof, some with crank out windows and a window in the
back - as far as I know, Safare had only one style which had sliding windows with screens and
no window in the back.
<P>
Adventurewagen had a different cabinet behind the driver - theirs had a unit with a stove and a
cabinet above.  Safares had a closet and sink with the stove being behind the passenger seat
with the fridge.  
<P>
Safare used cheap, thin, medium colored wood paneling.  Adventurewagen used darker, more
quality-looking paneling.  I haven't looked at it closely but I think it may be formica over
particle board.
<P>
That's all I can think of offhand.  I am really not that familiar with the different models of
Adventurewagen so it's kind of hard to compare them. If I could see an Adventurewagen I could
tell you the exact differences from the Safare.
