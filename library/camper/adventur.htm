<h3>Adventurewagen and Safare Campers Compared</h3>
<p>by David Schwarze</p>
<hr size="2">
<blockquote><font size="+1"><i>What exactly is the difference
between an Adventure Wagen and a VW Safare? I would assume the
manufacturers to start but after that what?</i></font></blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Adventurewagen and Safare both took plain VW
busses from the factory and equipped them for camping. They had a
similar style of foldout bed - a very nice design (I think) which
folds up into a U shape, unlike the Z-bed in the Westfalia. They
were both very well equipped, with most of them having stoves,
sinks, 12/110v electric refrigerators, onboard propane tanks, and
dual batteries. Most had upper beds as well so they could sleep two
adults and one large or two small children.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Differences that I know of:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Adventurewagen had several styles of highroof,
some with crank out windows and a window in the back - as far as I
know, Safare had only one style which had sliding windows with
screens and no window in the back.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Adventurewagen had a different cabinet behind
the driver - theirs had a unit with a stove and a cabinet above.
Safares had a closet and sink with the stove being behind the
passenger seat with the fridge.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Safare used cheap, thin, medium colored wood
paneling. Adventurewagen used darker, more quality-looking
paneling. I haven't looked at it closely but I think it may be
formica over particle board.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">That's all I can think of offhand. I am really
not that familiar with the different models of Adventurewagen so
it's kind of hard to compare them. If I could see an Adventurewagen
I could tell you the exact differences from the Safare.</font></p>
