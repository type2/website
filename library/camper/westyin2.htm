<h3>'65-'73 Westfalia Interior Interchangeability Notes</h3>
<p>by Michael Heron</p>
<hr size="2">
<p><font size="+1">Note: I have checked the part numbers in my
Westy part manuals to ensure that the following parts are
interchangeable.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">In restoring my 65' westy back to as original as
possible, I have made a few insights as to the interchangeability
of pre and post 67' Westies. As the van changed from the split
window to the bubble window the westy interior changed just enough
to make it infuriatingly <b>not</b> interchangeable. For example,
the coldbox from a bubble window camper is approximately 2" taller
than the coldbox for my 65' Westy, and therefore not
interchangeable without major surgery. Thus anytime I find any
interchangeable parts I am just a little bit tickled.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Here are my findings on interchangeability
between my 65' Westy and bubble window Westies (up to
1973):</font></p>
<ol>
<li><font size="+1">The wood grain on the cabinets stayed the same
from 65' (maybe back to 64?) up until 1971)</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">That now famous yellow vinyl that covered the
camper seats remained the same from 65 (maybe 64?) up until early
1973. Obviously the shapes of the seats etc. changed.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">The yellow and brown checkered curtains stayed
the same from 65 (maybe 64?) up till 73'. The curtain material on
the bubble windows was designed to cover up longer side windows, so
some cutting needs to be done to fit a split, but finding this
material in half decent shape is an accomplishment!</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">The small washer like thing that site recessed
in the floor that the leg of the dining table screws into the same
remained the same from 65' to 72.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">The beige metal "securing snaps" that hold all
of the cabinets remained the same from 65' to 73.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">The engine access hinges remained the same fro
64' to 74' (I know I am repeating myself).</font></li>
</ol>
