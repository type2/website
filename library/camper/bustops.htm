Here's a unique '69-'70 vintage bus:

Eric Archer spotted the picture here and provided
the following information:

"It is actually a camper conversion 
called the 'Desert Rat Conversion' done by Volkswagen dealerships in a attempt to pick up sales
out here in the Phoenix, Arizona area. I currently have a 1973 bus that
has the same top but due to the dust and dry climate out here, the
canvas pop-tops did not fair very well for more than 5 years... so it
was decided to add a high roof pop top to it. The GT model
was supposed to be a high performance model that was supposed "to pull its
own weight among other mini-RVs of its class (i.e ASI, Dormobile, etc.,
etc.). The chrome trim was available for an extra amount with the extra resistant
paint as found on Wolfsburg editions. The dome light is apart of the conversion, 
and well...the top does not work
at all--it could just be considered as a high roof and that's that! They are
not really known in the VW camper world and that's a shame... they only made
about 50 or so of them from 1967 to 1979 so i think that more people should
take more notice of them."
<P>
The fiberglass top has crank out side windows, a ventilation portal in the top, and a luggage
rack in the rear. The interior is stock Westfalia,  but the poptop hole was enlarged for more access to 
utilize the high top.
