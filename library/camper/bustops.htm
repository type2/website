<h3>Miscellaneous Camper Buses</h3>
<p>compiled by Ron Van Ness</p>

<p><font size="+1">Here's a unique '69-'70 vintage bus:</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Eric Archer spotted the picture here and
provided the following information:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"It is actually a camper conversion called the
'Desert Rat Conversion' done by Volkswagen dealerships in a attempt
to pick up sales out here in the Phoenix, Arizona area. I currently
have a 1973 bus that has the same top but due to the dust and dry
climate out here, the canvas pop-tops did not fair very well for
more than 5 years... so it was decided to add a high roof pop top
to it. The GT model was supposed to be a high performance model
that was supposed "to pull its own weight among other mini-RVs of
its class (i.e ASI, Dormobile, etc., etc.). The chrome trim was
available for an extra amount with the extra resistant paint as
found on Wolfsburg editions. The dome light is apart of the
conversion, and well...the top does not work at all--it could just
be considered as a high roof and that's that! They are not really
known in the VW camper world and that's a shame... they only made
about 50 or so of them from 1967 to 1979 so i think that more
people should take more notice of them."</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The fiberglass top has crank out side windows, a
ventilation portal in the top, and a luggage rack in the rear. The
interior is stock Westfalia, but the poptop hole was enlarged for
more access to utilize the high top.</font></p>
