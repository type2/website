<h3>More Notes on the Westfalia SO-34 Interior</h3>
<p>by Steve Mighetto</p>
<hr size="2">
<p><font size="+1">I'm not an expert but I do own an S0-34
Westfalia. The cabinets in S0-34's are white laminate. From what I
can tell, the laminate material is the German equivalent of white
formica.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Westfalia S0-34 and S0-35 interiors are the so
called "Flipseat" interiors. They are identical in layout and
differ only in the color of the formica laminate. S0-35's are brown
wood grain. SO-34's are white.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Flipseats were available from very late 1961
until VW changed the size of the rear window in mid '63. The
"flipseat" is the front cab bench seat. Not the rear seat or some
form of the bench/bed seat as many people seem to
assume.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Flipseats are built on walk through Kombi
chassis. The chassis is modified by removing the partition wall
that is normally between the cab and cargo area. With this done, a
special cab bench seat mechanism is installed. The bench seat
mechanism allows the seat back to be flipped over and moved
forward. This reforms the front bench seat so that it faces the
cargo section of the bus. You are literally sitting in the cab
facing the other direction. In this configuration the front bench
seat forms one arm of a corner sectional like seating arrangement
in the cargo area.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">To sleep, the flipseat mechanism is moved to an
upright position with the bench back facing up. The bed is formed
from the bench seat in the cargo area and the cab bench seat. You
sleep with your feet in the cab. On the driver side your feet can
be quite literally under the steering wheel.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">From the back edge of the rear cargo door to the
rear hatch, there are cabinets on both the driver and the passenger
side. Flipseats have a window in the closet like other Westy's and
a really useless window behind the ice box.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Flipseats do not have a built in sink, stove, or
refrigerator. The sink is a washbowl in the door cabinet. The door
cabinet is set up as a vanity with a mirror on top and a wash bowl
(not a sink) on the bottom. What looks like a refrigerator is an
ice chest. The stove is a camp stove.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The cabinet section on the drivers side is
unique to this model only. It has the liqueur cabinet, special
storage for metal cups, ice chest, and a food preparation cabinet.
The food preparation cabinet is hinged so it can swing to face the
interior of the bus. The camp stove stores in the food preparation
cabinet. Most food prep is done by opening the rear hatch and using
the cabinets in "tailgate" fashion.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The closet section on the passenger side looks a
lot like the earlier S0-23 and later S0-42's. Some people have told
me the flipseat closet is wider. I really don't know.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The cabinet latches changed in late '62. Early
models used the same all metal latches found on S0-23's. Late model
versions use the push button latches(found on S0-42's?).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">There are a lot of other details that make
S0-34/35's unusual Westy's. The table can be mounted outside of the
car in an adapter plate that mounts in the spare tire. There is a
forward facing seat in the rear that can be removed and becomes a
chair etc. etc.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Terry's bus on the following web page is an
S0-34.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Micahel Heron has pictures of my S0-34 on his
web site. They are at the very bottom of the page and are labeled
"Steve and Saundra's S0-35" (it's actually an S0-34).</font></p>
