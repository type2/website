<h3>Westfalia Child's Cot Pole Specifications
<P>by Karl "Aufever"</h3>
<hr size=2>
<font size=+1>
<p>
Here are the sizes and styles of Westy cot bars:
<P>
55 1/4", round, black = split bus (rear pole)<BR>
~47", round, black = split bus (front pole)<BR>
56 1/4", round, black = 68<BR>
56 1/4", 3 sided, galvanized = 69 - 73<BR>
57 1/4", 3 sided, galvanized = 74 - 75<BR>
2 piece, collapsible, 3 sided, galvanized = 76 - 79<BR>
<P>
68 to 73 stored on top of the side cabinet. 74 - 75 stored under the full
width bed/bench seat, 76-79 were collapsible because the bed was 3/4 width
and one piece bars won't fit anywhere. The round black ones bend very
easy....
