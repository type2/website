Remember this article is meant to be an overview or an introduction anda way to describe 

as many features as we can.  It doesn't mean it's gospel.  Owning Volkswagens should make you 

aware that every country kept features for a different length of time and that Volkswagen 

subscribes to the left over theory.  If it's left over just put it onthe first ten or first 

two hundred models of the next year to confuse everyone!</p><p>During the early sixties the idea 

of a "ready to go" camping vehicle seemed to have caught on in Europe and especially here in 

America. Volkswagen had already made in roads with this new market as early as1952, when they 

made available roof racks and awnings.  In America, interest in the camping vehicle steadily grew 

right through the end of the split window era and beyond.  Some of the refinements that we've seen

are still being used, some were discarded as impractical.</p>



<p><h3>Camping Box</h3>Westfalia did incorporate distinct styles of kits in the early buses

through 58, unfortunately not many good examples exist today.  Whatmakes theses kits unique was 

the large use of wood (not much plastic there) and a fairly simple design.  1953 introduced the 

camping box.  Aremovable box that would allow part of the kit to be removed  to be used as a sort 

of chuck wagon by the picnic table.  One of the  models used arollback bread box style cabinet 

as rear compartments.  The camping box expanded to "standard" and "export" models in 1955.  In 

1956, the kits were renamed "standard" and "deluxe".   These early models used a set of very

prominent decals with the Westfalia horse logo.  Most unusual of all were 2 large red fuel 

containers for an optional Westy cooking stove. (pretty high on my cool factor)  While the 

sleeping cot was primitive by later standards, it was very functional.  Available from 1952 to 

1964was the operable steel hatch in the roof so you could enjoy the good weather and the stars 

at night or let the bus fill up with water if you forgot to close it tightly.   </p>



<p><h3><a href="../images/so23.gif">SO-23</A>

</h3>1958 brought about the deluxe SO-23. SO designations come from "sonderausfuhrung" meaning 

special model or edition.  The original standard SO22 camping box was still available and 

possibly was available through1966.  We are unsure of this total timeframe.  Offering the same 

basic design 58-61 Westfalia was using the 2 rear seats with 2 back cushions to form a bed.  

Either red and black or yellow and black plaid were thechoices for upholstery.  Cabinets were 

made of plywood veneer with woodfinish,  the doors of cabinets were oval or half rounds with 

metal edging.  Early style child's hammock using same plaid as rear bed hooked around back of 

front seat to make a small hammock and bottom of frontseat could actually hold another child.  

These campers came with or without an ice box section that included another storage compartment 

on thedriver's side above the engine compartment.  Also as an option was anelastic catch all for 

shoes across the ceiling of the rear area.  These campers came with the highly sought after spun 

colored aluminum drink sets in the clear bread box display cover.  There were your basic cocktail

6 oz cups and your accompanying shot glasses.  There was anenormous water tank that took up half

the area under the seat behind the driver that operated on an electric siphon hose.  There were 

2 clamshell side lights and an abundance of 

<a href="../images/so23.gif">homey charm</a>.

There were 2 tent options.  Small foyer and large cabana room.  A lot of busses came with both 

sets of mounts on the roof  hence the four mounting eyes on early Westys.  To increase the amount

of stuff you could bring, Westfalia racks started to appear regularly.  A rack from this era is 

distinctivefrom a side profile.  The back bow has a lower profile than the other 2,or look at 

the attaching clamps.  They are smaller without press marks from stamping. The wood slats were 

screwed with 2 screws instead of oneas in later racks.  The later racks all had equal bow height.  

In 1960 the "MOSAIK" program was introduced to create more optional kit offerings.  With the 

MOSAIK program you could buy just the camper pieces you could afford or really wanted. Additional

pieces were available through the dealer.</p>



<p><h3><a href="../images/so34.gif">SO-34 

and SO-35</a></h3>1962 brought out a different kit altogether.  The SO-34 or 35 depending on the 

upholstery.  While the flip top hatch was retained and the hanging locker and rear cupboard unit 

was in the same place everything was different.   From a kid’s perspective it is also the 

"funnest" year. </p>





<p> The hanging locker unit was wider than before.  The camper interior was arranged

for seating looking out the side doors rather than facing each other front to back.  The bed was 

made up from 3 narrow (uncomfortable) cushions going lengthwise in the middle of the bus that

used the front seat and the fold up middle seat in the rear tunnel as extensions for tall people.

Extra seating for socializing was provided by spinning the back of the front seat 180 degrees on

swivel arms accessed at the front doors.  The seat back completely flipped around so from the 

side doors you could access the entire bench seat now facing backwards.  So in addition to the 

bench seat facing the <a href="../images/so34sink.gif"> 

double doors</a> there was one across the front of the bus and in the tunnel

or alley in the back in front of the engine compartment a single seat flipped up. An optional item

was also a small standard folding chair that clamped to the floor for travel in front of the 

hanging locker.  The table screwed into the floor but could swivel on a bent arm that allowed 

the long way to be either horizontal or vertical across the bus.  But the best part about the 

table was its ability to come out of the bus and be used.  Why did they ever give that idea up?</p>

<p>The back of the bus under the rear hatch was the primary access to the kitchen area.  Facing the 

rear of the bus the left hand <a href="../images/so34cab.gif">  

unit </a> had a large fold down doo to act as a flat surface with 4 

recessed shelves to hold canned goods, silverware, condiments, fuel bottles, cups,etc. and in 

front of that  was the icebox.  On the right hand side was a cupboard with 2 side opening doors

behind the hanging locker.  But if the weather was inclement just unbolt the kitchen fastener 

and swing it around on its roller wheel to face the interior of the bus and work from there 

albeit hunched over.   The swivel unit itself had logical storage and even accommodated the 

stove when you were ready to pack up.  No digging under the bed for kitchen stuff.  While the 

unit was swiveled forward it allowed access the spare tire behind it.  By taking the spare tire 

out and laying it flat on the ground, with the plate that came in it you could mount your table 

to the tire and have a little serving table or prep table wherever it was most convenient.</p>



<p>On the front of the ice box facing the front of the bus was a very early sixties traditions, the 

bar.  The <a href="../images/inside.gif">upper

cupboard</a> sported the traditional spun aluminum glasses in the 8 oz size with space for your 

own extras and the bottom cupboard tilted out with cutouts to support two fifths of your favorite

before dinner beverage and storage for a third.  This was definitely a  martini crowd camper!</p>



<p>This year introduced the  common green child's hammock that we saw through 1967 and its basic 

style is still used in today's Westys.  The "social" frontseat swiveled to a 90 degree rotation 

to form the lumpy support underthe child's hammock if needed but also opened up the front seat 

to be the overflow foot room for the main bed.  This year instead of the traditional wood finish

the white laminate with the gray dashes and lines was the indestructible material for the cabinet

surfaces. </p>



<p>The upholstery was either yellow/orange plaid with a red vinyl front seat or 

blue/green plaid.  Instead of a water tank and pump this model came with 3 water jugs.  Very 

handy to take out of the bus and use anywhere and refill.  One of the most novel ideas was that 

of a movable light.  Alittle cone shaped patio lamp on the end of a lamp cord that plugged into 

a cigarette lighter like opening and could be hung from various hooks or even hung from the tent 

made seeing what you were doing a breeze.  This kit has been seen in 1963 which appears to be a 

transition year, sharing most designs with 1964 but not quite.  </p>







<p><h3>1963 and 1964</h3>Interestingly the 1963-1964 kit is reminiscent of the 1958-1961 kits 

where the 2 back seats oppose each other and the table affixed itself inbetween them.  To make 

the bed the seat bottoms slid to the middle andthe seat backs came off and were used to fill in 

the gaps.  The rear seat back fit fine as is but the front seat back was thinner and needed to 

use lifters to level out the bed.  These were the little hinged pieces of wood inside the forward

seat compartment.  Under the seat bottoms were huge storage areas.  A lawn chair easily fits in 

the storage compartment.  The cupboards had squarish doors with roundedcorners trimmed in plastic

but instead of the wonderful brass swivel latches used previously Westfalia attempted to copy a 

cheap American camper design and went to plastic pull knobs that bent broke and fell apart.  

The conical light remained through 1965.  1964 marked the last year of the real wood finish.  

It was also the last year for the fliptop and the first year of the large rear window.  Seat 

cushions were still the yellow/orange or blue/green plaid Pendleton wool material.  On the front 

side door was the ‘bathroom’ with a rectangle cupboard divided in half.  The top opened up and 

had 3 shelves with a mirror on the inside and snapped to the door and the bottom folded down and 

was held perpendiular with a chain and the cupboard held a ‘dishpan/bathroomsink’.</p>



<p><h3>SO-42</h3>1965 brought out a totally different kit and certainly the one that is most familiar to 

everyone.  It was known as the <a href="so42.htm">SO-42</a>.  What really made this kit different

was the use of a retractable (very comfortable withsprings) 

<a href="../images/soback.gif">Z bed</a> which

allowed instant sleeping arrangements and could be put away again post haste.  Coupled with the 

new fiberglass top and canvas side straight up pop top there was plenty of room to move around

in.  They finally brought the <a href="../images/sooppos.gif">ice box</a>

to a more accessible area in aself contained cabinet just inside the front double door where it 

could be opened from inside or outside the bus.  This unit also housed the upright water tank 

and excellent plunge pump dispenser.  No sink was installed, so there was room for a utensil 

drawer and a more useful flat<a href="../images/sooppos.gif">cabinet top</a>.

The cushions were covered in easy to clean solid color vinyl for the export market or the 

yellow/orange plaid was available generally in Europe.  The side lights were covered with 

rectangular slide out covers and there was no conical light with this kit.  This kit came in a 

walk through style with a single seat behind the driver and maybe a lid on the map storage 

section in between the driver and rear passenger or maybe not, or with a three quarter bench 

with a built in map junk compartment with or with out a lid that a small child could sleep on.  

If it wasn't a walk through then there was a narrow what-not cupboard in the rear corner of the 

bus on the driver's side.  A surprisingly roomy cupboard went across the top rear.  A full 

week'sworth of clothes for one person could easily fit there.  The rear access hatch for the 

space behind the hanging locker opened up, rather than sideways as in the past.  Some how you 

had to hold up the hatch and dig around in the depths to find what you were after.  A snap strap 

to hold it open like the kind used above the table to hold the table up and out of the way would 

have been handy.  The table was permanently hinged to the side of the bus and would fold down 

against the side wall out of the way or swing up to the roof.  The child's hammock remained an 

option. The most practical addition was the what not cabinet on the rear sidedoor.  It holds a 

ton of food, spices and glassware.  The two fold up tables one on the front door and the other 

on the side of the <a href="../images/smallso.gif">ice box</a>

under the pivoting arm of the water dispenser made an easy working areaunder the awning. To add

a little sleeping room a factory option sparetire mount could be ordered right in the middle of 

the space for the front emblem.  Or for those Alaska hiway trips you could bring two spare tires.

Since camping is sometimes done in the rain the jalousie windows and screens made water and bug

proof cross ventilation possible.  The SO-42 sold for 1850 dm in 1965.  Basic components of this

kit can still be recognized in the newest offerings from Westfalia even today.</p>



<p><h3>SO-44</h3>Also available starting in 1965 was the SO-44 kit.  It employed a significantly

different interior layout.  It was for non walk throughbuses with the bulkhead behind the driver 

made up of a kitchenette with a flip over cover and a hanging locker directly behind the driver.

Inside the lid of the kitchenette there was space for a stove or work area and a small sink.  In 

1965 water was obtained from siphon pumping from two removable bottles while later there was an 

installed watertank.  There were three doors on the kitchen section the one closest to the outer 

doors was the ice box.  The middle one had 3 small utensil drawers and storage for the bottles.  

The one by the hanging locker had 3 shelves and plenty of storage for canned and dry goods.  

Instead of a fixed dinette table the table was on a moveable swivel with a small jumpseat between 

the hanging locker and the huge Z bed. 

The Z bed went wall to wall and like the SO-42 was a spring bed with all the size and comforts of home.

What a difference a foot makes.  There were cute armrests on either side.  The yellow naugahyde

was the usual upholstery. Hanging from the roof in the rear and extending from side to side of 

the bus was an optional 3 section clothes compartment.  Great for extended storage but almost 

completely blocks the view out the back window. Frequently found in this kit was the small 

hanging light with the adapter hole.  This kit was a bit more money at 2540dm.</p>



<p>While there is no ultimate year by Westfalia all models have a favorite feature.  It is the 

imaginative designs that have made owning and restoring Westys a real treat.</p>
