<h3>Fiberglass Pop Top Painting

During the past 2 weeks I have finally painted my pop-top. Some painting
took place on the weekends, and the rest occurred after work. I was
fortunate to have warm dry weather during the entire job, no morning or
evening coastal fog that often occurs at my house. The entire job took about
20 hours. I removed the front luggage rack for painting, and painted the
rear poptop in place. I used the Interlux fiberglass paint and products from
West Marine to do the job. I basically followed all the procedures specified
by Interlux for surface prep, and used all their products.

<LI> Washed the poptop before painting with soap and water to get the dirt
off.
<LI> Removed the front luggage rack.
<LI> Washed the tops again with X-14 for the luggage rack, and a bleach and
water solution for the rear. I ran out of X-14. The bleach solution seemed
to work as well as X-14 IMO.
<LI> Sanded the tops with 60 grit using my random orbital sander, a sanding
block, and by hand when required to get at the hard to get spots.
<LI> Washed the tops off.
<LI> Sanded the tops with 120 grit
<LI> Washed the tops off again.
<LI> Applied Interlux 333 brushing liquid to clean off any remaining dust and
to "improve paint flow and slow hot weather drying time".
<LI> Applied Interlux Briteside Primer to both tops. I used a paintbrush to
apply the primer to the luggage rack, and both a paintbrush and roller to
apply the primer to the poptop.
<LI> Sanded tops with 120 grit.
<LI> Cleaned top and applied brushing liquid.
<LI> Applied another coat of primer.
<LI> Sanded tops with 120 grit.
<LI> Cleaned top and applied 333 brushing liquid.
<LI> Applied Interlux Bluglo White, 1 part polyurethane paint.
<LI> Sanded top with 220 grit
<LI> Cleaned top and applied 333 brushing liquid.
<LI> Applied paint - job complete
</OL>
<P>
At this point the job should be complete. I wasn't happy with how the paint
went on when brushed, so I ended up sanding and adding a third coat to the
luggage rack.
<P>
This was a pretty tedious, time consuming task, but my top sure is shiny
now.
Brushing and using a roller was not the greatest. Despite all my efforts, I
was unable to eliminate all the brush marks. 
If I had the money and equipment, I would think spraying to tops would
produce better results.
Heck, if I had money I would pay a professional to do the job.
<P>
Material cost - Due to my third coat on the luggage rack, I needed to buy an
extra can of paint to finish the job. With careful allocation of the paint
and primer, a 2-coat paint job can be done with 1 quart of paint.
