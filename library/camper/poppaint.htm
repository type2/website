<h3>Fiberglass Pop Top Painting</h3>
<p>by Brian Hoare</p>
<hr size="2">
<p><font size="+1">During the past 2 weeks I have finally painted
my pop-top. Some painting took place on the weekends, and the rest
occurred after work. I was fortunate to have warm dry weather
during the entire job, no morning or evening coastal fog that often
occurs at my house. The entire job took about 20 hours. I removed
the front luggage rack for painting, and painted the rear poptop in
place. I used the Interlux fiberglass paint and products from West
Marine to do the job. I basically followed all the procedures
specified by Interlux for surface prep, and used all their
products.</font></p>
<ol>
<li><font size="+1">Washed the poptop before painting with soap and
water to get the dirt off.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Removed the front luggage rack.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Washed the tops again with X-14 for the luggage
rack, and a bleach and water solution for the rear. I ran out of
X-14. The bleach solution seemed to work as well as X-14
IMO.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Sanded the tops with 60 grit using my random
orbital sander, a sanding block, and by hand when required to get
at the hard to get spots.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Washed the tops off.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Sanded the tops with 120 grit</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Washed the tops off again.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Applied Interlux 333 brushing liquid to clean
off any remaining dust and to "improve paint flow and slow hot
weather drying time".</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Applied Interlux Briteside Primer to both tops.
I used a paintbrush to apply the primer to the luggage rack, and
both a paintbrush and roller to apply the primer to the
poptop.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Sanded tops with 120 grit.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Cleaned top and applied brushing
liquid.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Applied another coat of primer.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Sanded tops with 120 grit.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Cleaned top and applied 333 brushing
liquid.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Applied Interlux Bluglo White, 1 part
polyurethane paint.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Sanded top with 220 grit</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Cleaned top and applied 333 brushing
liquid.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Applied paint - job complete</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font size="+1">At this point the job should be complete. I
wasn't happy with how the paint went on when brushed, so I ended up
sanding and adding a third coat to the luggage rack.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">This was a pretty tedious, time consuming task,
but my top sure is shiny now. Brushing and using a roller was not
the greatest. Despite all my efforts, I was unable to eliminate all
the brush marks. If I had the money and equipment, I would think
spraying to tops would produce better results. Heck, if I had money
I would pay a professional to do the job.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Material cost - Due to my third coat on the
luggage rack, I needed to buy an extra can of paint to finish the
job. With careful allocation of the paint and primer, a 2-coat
paint job can be done with 1 quart of paint.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">1 quart Interlux Paint $23<br>
1 quart Interlux primer $18<br>
2 cans 333 thinner $20<br>
Sandpaper, brushes, $17<br>
Rollers<br>
paint tray<br>
X-14<br>
latex gloves<br>
