<B>'68-'72 "European" Westfalia (model S0-69)</B> with Sink, stove and Electrolux propane
refrigerator behind a front bench seat cab.  Some buses fitted with this 
interior originally did not have a front bench seat.  In these cases an adapter bracket was
used at the factory to allow installation of a 2/3 passenger seat in the cab.

"My German 74 has a similar interior to the 74/75 on the picture. 
Differences: Orange plaid, Cabinet behind sink extends all the way 
up, blocking part of the side window (inside hanging space, accessible 
from the rear). There is also a small bench between the folding 
bench and the driver's side cabinet, providing a vented (through 
the floor) cabinet for 2 propane bottles. It also has  a trap door 
in the floor between bench and fridge, providing access to a an 
under floor mounted LP heater. On later German campers (76-79, I 
believe) you have the sink, where the fridge is on the 74, and a 
cooker that folds down from the driver's side cabinet, blocking 
the walkthrough when in use."
