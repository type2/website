photos of a '68-'79 Westfalia interior that is not identified here,

<p><font size="+1"><b>'68-'72 "European" Westfalia (model
S0-69)</b> with Sink, stove and Electrolux propane refrigerator
behind a front bench seat cab. Some buses fitted with this interior
originally did not have a front bench seat. In these cases an
adapter bracket was used at the factory to allow installation of a
2/3 passenger seat in the cab.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">"My German 74 has a similar interior to the
74/75 on the picture. Differences: Orange plaid, Cabinet behind
sink extends all the way up, blocking part of the side window
(inside hanging space, accessible from the rear). There is also a
small bench between the folding bench and the driver's side
cabinet, providing a vented (through the floor) cabinet for 2
propane bottles. It also has a trap door in the floor between bench
and fridge, providing access to a an under floor mounted LP heater.
On later German campers (76-79, I believe) you have the sink, where
the fridge is on the 74, and a cooker that folds down from the
driver's side cabinet, blocking the walkthrough when in
use."</font></p>
