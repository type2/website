<h3>Plastic Molding for Westfalia Interior</h3>
<p>by to Rick Fabulous and Brian Hoare</p>

<blockquote><font size="+1"><i>Way back last year sometime, one of
the T2 listees went on a hunt for that plastic edging that goes
around the furniture on Westies. As I recall, the person said they
located a place that not only sold in bulk for cheap, but one could
get the trim in a variety of colors.</i></font></blockquote>

1-800-631-8375</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">They'll send you a free catalog about an inch
and a half thick. The T-molding comes in 250 foot rolls, minimum.
They've got all kinds of other stuff, from doorknobs to two foot
high statues of Michelangelo's "David." I got the catalog for the
T-moulding, but wound up buying a thousand bucks worth of halogen
light fixtures, transformers, and touch dimmers for my
house!</font></p>

<p><font size="+1"><b>Plastic T-molding</b>: 12 foot roll is $4.99,
100 foot roll is $24.99 3/4" wide.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">12 foot roll is $6.49, 100 foot roll is
$24.9913/16" wide</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Both widths come in tan, brown, black, and
white. The catalog says the 3/4" width is for plywood, and the
13/16" width is for laminated sheet goods. I think the 3/4" width
is probably what you want. You will also need a slot cutter for a
router to cut the groove to install the T-molding. They sell these
also for a 1/4" shank router.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">48876 for a 1/16" kerf (for 3/4" molding) -
$24.99<br>
95332 for a 5/64" kerf (for 13/16" molding) - $26.99<br></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The part numbers for black 3/4" T-molding are
27201 & 91728 for the 12 ft and 100 ft respectively.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Prices were from my Fall 1997 catalog. Order a
catalog before you buy and you will see a picture and the same
description as above.<br></font></p>
