Way back last year sometime, one of the T2 listees went on
a hunt for that plastic edging that goes around the furniture 
on Westies.  As I recall, the person said they located a place
that not only sold in bulk for cheap, but one could get the
trim in a variety of colors.

They'll send you a free catalog about an inch and a half thick.
The T-molding comes in 250 foot rolls, minimum.  They've got all
kinds of other stuff, from doorknobs to two foot high statues of
Michelangelo's "David."  I got the catalog for the T-moulding, but
wound up buying a thousand bucks worth of halogen light fixtures,
transformers, and touch dimmers for my house!

<B>Plastic T-molding</B>: 12 foot roll is $4.99, 100 foot roll is $24.99 3/4" wide.

12 foot roll is $6.49, 100 foot roll is $24.9913/16" wide
<P>
Both widths come in tan, brown, black, and white. The catalog
says the 3/4" width is for plywood, and the 13/16" width is for
laminated sheet goods. I think the 3/4" width is probably what
you want. You will also need a slot cutter for a router to cut the
groove to install the T-molding. They sell these also for a 1/4"
shank router.

48876 for a 1/16" kerf (for 3/4" molding) - $24.99<BR>
95332 for a 5/64" kerf (for 13/16" molding) - $26.99<BR>
<P>
The part numbers for black 3/4" T-molding are 27201 & 91728
for the 12 ft and 100 ft respectively.

Prices were from my Fall 1997 catalog. Order a catalog before 
you buy and you will see a picture and the same description as
above.
