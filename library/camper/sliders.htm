<h3>Westfalia Curtain Track Sliders</h3>
<p>by Fred Stoermer</p>
<hr size="2">
<p><font size="+1">The brand name is 'RECMAR', and I get it at
Boater's World which is a discount marine supply chain.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">RECMAR's name for this particular product line
is 'SLIDE-RIGHT CURTAIN TRACK'. You can buy just the sliders in a
bag, or a kit including track and mounting screws plus the sliders
and stop screws for the ends of the track sections. The track is
identical to the plastic track above the front doors on my 1970
Westy Campmobile, and the sliders fit perfectly in those Westy
tracks plus the aluminum track above the sliding side
door.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The sliders are individual plastic pieces with
loops for sewing onto the curtains. The original Westy curtains had
a length of fabric with the sliders already attached, and this was
then sewn to the top edge of the curtains. I sewed the RECMAR
sliders onto the curtains my wife made for the Westy and it went
very quickly even with my clumsy efforts.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I have an unopened track kit here now. It has 2
pieces of track, 36 inches each, plus a bag of sliders and all the
hardware. The price at Boater's World was a whopping $6.99. Kits
are also available with 24", 48", and 60" track sections. The
packaging even includes instructions for making the
curtains.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I can't find an address for RECMAR on this
package, but they market this stuff for van conversions and RVs as
well so it should be available just about anywhere.</font></p>
