<h3>Pop Top Billowing ('68-'73 Westfalia)</h3>
<p>by Fred Stoermer</p>

<p><font size="+1">I specifically recommended using nylon luggage
straps. The ones I've used for years are 1" nylon, with
plastic-coated gutter hooks and a solid nylon adjustable buckle
closure.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I place one strap over the poptop so the hooks
are just at the top rear corner of the front doors. This places the
strap in the existing crosswise groove of the fiberglass poptop so
it can't shift back and forth when agitated by the slipstream and
crosswinds.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The second strap is placed so the gutter hooks
are at the top rear corner of the sliding door
opening/"seam".</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The nylon straps have a certain amount of
elasticity. They can be snugged tight, "preloading" the strap
tension, and guaranteeing that the poptop won't flutter or "work"
in the slipstream or nasty crosswinds. Because the buckles are
quick-release, it just takes a moment to remove the straps when you
want to raise the poptop.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Before we started doing this, even with
brand-new inside hold-downs and the front hinge assembly/hardware
in perfect order the poptop would still shift around in the
slipstream/wind. When the wind gets under the top it also works on
the canvas.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">After a highway run of a few hours the left rear
portion of the canvas used to be hanging down loose above the rear
seat. After we started using the outside straps this was no longer
a problem. Obviously, the outside straps secure the poptop very
well and prevent even strong wind gusts from affecting the position
of the poptop and the canvas.</font></p>
