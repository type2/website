<h3>Fiberglass Pop Top Restoration</h3>
<p>by John Anderson</p>
<hr size="2">
<p><font size="+1">Camper pop tops are a nightmare to do right. You
can try scrubbing with a phosphate cleaner, then give it a
rubberized white RV roof treatment. To do one right is to re gel
coat yourself with a professional polyester surfacing primer or
have it done professionally. The thick RV stuff will rebuild gloss
over the worn fiberglass and you can do it.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">A real good thing to do first: get yourself some
sprayable polyester filler and put it down on the sanded glass
(this is basically thin spray gelcoat). I've used a brand called
Z-chrome (about $50/gallon here) but there is a more common brand
that is a bit pricer (about $20/qt). I would leave a lot of tooth
for this stuff, sand to about 180 then lay down a couple nice heavy
wet coats. It goes on real nice and can actually fill the big
scratches. You spray it as is out of the can, adding only catalyst.
This will basically restore the origional gell-coat in a cheap
manner. It can then be sanded wet to take off the orange peel
(which is not very much) and topcoated to your desire.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Regular epoxy primer, even good stuff like DP90,
isn't going to cover heavy enough to bury the exposed glass you
will be hitting into--but this will. I swear by it on all things
(usually used on metal right after a good epoxy primer). It is a
totally, 100% shrink free primer surfacer, wonderful to work, and
yields beautiful results. I tried it first time about a year ago on
the '90. It is everything it claims and more. But use an old gun
and clean it ASAP with acetone. For a full paint job this stuff is
miraculous, allows you to take out all kinds of minor surface
imperfections after you've gone to bare metal or if you have just
done rough bondo work and want something to fill all the
pinholes.</font></p>
<blockquote><font size="+1"><i>"What sort of a gun are you using to
spray this stuff? Just a regular suction gun or some sort of HVLP
or pressure pot system?"</i></font></blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">I'm using my oldest, ugliest primer siphon gun,
but I drilled out the fluid tip to a fairly large size (hey you try
to find needles and tips for a 10 year old taiwan gun). I basically
drilled it as big as it looked like I could. It puts the taper of
the needle much farther out the tip--works very nicely. The stuff I
used (I think Z-Chrome Rust Defender is its name) is about 1.5-2
times as thick looking as properly mixed acryllic enamel. It does
not get thinned either, just goes straight on. It also goes on well
even with the siphon gun without much overspray or orange peel. I
must have lucked out on the modified tip orfice size. The stuff is
so heavy it just wants to go on the desired panel, plus it does not
dry quickly at all so overspray settles on and sinks in. It takes a
good time for the surface to fully dry. I don't recall exactly but
a good couple (3+) of hours. Mine is basically just polyester
resin, thinned with styrene I'd suppose, with a yellow pigment so
you can see where you've been. In thinking about it again, I think
I'd do a full pop-top to about 180-220 dry before I sprayed,
experimenting a little to make sure the stuff will cover. But I'm
fairly sure I've gone straight from 180 to spray this, to 240 and
320 final sanding before using a heavier topcoat.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">As another general gun plug, I'm still 1000%
satisfied with my gravity cup Sharpe HVLP. It has to be one of the
best $150-$200 guns on the market. The HVLP actually works (perhaps
not so well as a full turbine system). I like the gravity cup and
the balance of the gun a lot, save for the fact the cup is
small.<br></font></p>
