<h3>Sundial Camper Employee Interview</h3>
<p>by Colin Williams</p>
<hr size="2">
<p><font size="+1">In the spring of 1970, Dave King, the licensee
of the "Westminster" Volkswagen dealership in New Westminster, B.C.
approached me with the idea of my selling the camper to other VW
dealers. There was, at the time, a real strain on getting Westfalia
campers from VW. They were always in short supply to the extent
that we never had any choice as to colour or options. We just took
whatever they gave us. He had seen another camper set-up in a
magazine (it was on the front cover in a forest setting). He then
arranged for him to have the rights to produce this camper for
Canada. The basic interior came from the USA factory (somewhere in
California) I believe, and as memory serves me, here is the basic
layout.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">We began by using any new cargo van we could get
our hands on, then we used window vans and finally sunroof
models.</font></p>
<ol>
<li><font size="+1">A full length fibreglass roof that was tall
enough in the centre that I at 6'2" would not hit my head on when I
showed people the unit. Originally, we just used any van and cut
the entire metal roof away and put on the fibreglass one. We only
did a few with roofs from the US, then we produced on own. Our
first six or so units did not have any windows in the roof section,
but after that, we started to install them as an option. They were
just off the shelf RV units that we picked up in Vancouver. Small
rectangles with a sliding window and screen. I think they sold for
about $50.00 each side. The most I remember being put on is three
(left, right and back) but it looked funny.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">In the front, between the headlights, we
installed the spare tyre holder that we found we had to be careful
with otherwise our holding screws cut through some electrical
wires. The spare was wrapped in aluminium foil so that the tyre
would not stain throughout the plastic cover. The cover only came
in a creamy colour and had the Sundial logo on it in the
centre.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Dash changes were for an optional twin
cup/change/kleenex holder made of pine wood and stained to a dark
brown to match the door panels. It went on the dash by the radio.
If by chance we needed up with a white door panel unit we just
stained them with brown shoe polish...ah the expertise......other
options for the dash was a pine shelf unit that fitted under the
dash and it was also stained. I believe the holder was $8.00 and
the shelf $20.00. We also installed a steering wheel cover to match
the interior. It was made in Langley out of real cowhide and laced
with stained gut. It sold for $5.00. We installed an Am/Fm radio
with six pushbuttons and a longer antennae for $100.00 it came with
two extra speakers we installed in the doors towards the bottom of
the panel. The radio was a Blaupunkt but everything else was just
off the shelf.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">The front seats were standard but we slipped
over them a vinyl cover to match the interior. Sometimes, we
charged for the seat covers but I do not remember what that was.
And behind the driver's seat we had an optional head rest that sold
for $20.00. It was just using up odds and ends of the vinyl but we
sold almost all of the units with it. They varied in size but
basically were a rectangle.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">There are two other things I think I should
mention. We installed a vinyl floor that went from front to back. I
mean we took up everything and set this vinyl flooring down...glued
it down good, too. Then, we sold floor mats and the carpeting as
options. Second, we insulated everything everywhere. Sometimes, we
got so carried away that you could hardly roll down the windows but
it was warm in the Winter...especially since all units had to have
the gas heater/furnace.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Over the front seats, we installed hooks for
the two pieces of pipe and canvas cot that was standard. We sold
the units as capable of sleeping six, two up top, two on the cot,
and two in the double bed.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">The curtains were installed using the same old
push buttons as the Westfalia, except ours were bright and flowery.
They came from the US and were marked "Made in India". They were
much lighter in weight and in bright sunlight were almost
see-through. They were hung by using the thin brown bungie cord
instead of a top rail and snaps only on the bottom.</font></li>
