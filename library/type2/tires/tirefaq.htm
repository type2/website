<p><font size=
"+1">========================================================================</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">1.A. How do I read a tire's sidewall to tell its
size?</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">A tire's size is expressed in the format
WWW/AA-DD (i.e. 205/60-15) where WWW is the tire's
sidewall-to-sidewall Width in millimeters (205), AA is the Aspect
ratio or profile of the tire which specifies the tire's height as a
percentage of its width (60% of 205 = 123mm) and DD is the diameter
of the wheel that the tire is mounted on in inches (15 inches). If
the size is shown as P205/60R15, the "P" stands for Passenger and
the "R" is for Radial ply construction. Note that the width does
not measure the tread, which can vary significantly between tires
with the same nominal width, even within product lines from the
same manufacturer.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">What about an older tire that doesn't list an
aspect ratio?</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">For an older tire without an aspect ratio (i.e.
175R13), it's generally assumed to be a 78 or 80 series tire, (i.e.
175/78R13 or 175/80R13). Note that for some European tire models,
the default ration is 83. Fortunately, the practice of not listing
the aspect ratio is getting less and less common.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">1.B. Speed Rating</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The speed rating was traditionally shown as a
part of the tire's size, i.e. "205/60VR15". Since the inclusion of
Load Ratings (see 1.C below), many manufacturers are now showing
the speed rating after the size in combination with the load
rating, i.e. "205/60R15 92V". Commonly used speed ratings
include:</font></p>
<pre><font size="+1">
           Certified

  Rating   Top Speed

     N       87 mph

     Q      100 mph

     S      112 mph

     T      118 mph

     U      124 mph

     H      130 mph

     V      149 mph*

     Z   over 149 mph

     W      168 mph

     Y      186 mph

</font></pre>
<p><font size="+1">* Originally, V was "over 130mph". W and Y
ratings are relatively new, hence the redundancy with Z, which will
probably be dropped at some point in the future.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">1.C. Load Index</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The Load Index indicates the maximum weight the
tire can carry at the maximum speed indicated by its speed rating.
Some sample Load Rating Indices:</font></p>
<pre><font size="+1">
  Rating   Capacity (lbs)

    75           853

    82         1,047

    85         1,135

    87         1,201

    88         1,235

    91         1,356

    92         1,389

    93         1,433

    105        2,039

</font></pre>
<p><font size="+1">1.D. UTQG (Uniform Tire Quality Grading) rates
three aspects of tire performance: Temperature, Traction and
Treadwear. These grades are usually located together on the tire
sidewall. Tire manufacturers do their own UTQG testing and assign
their own grades. Some variations in testing are inherent due to
the lack of controls. FWIW, experts usually agree that Treadwear is
consistent within a given manufacturer's product lines.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Temperature: A/B/C</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Shows the tire's ability to dissipate heat and
its resistance to heat generation. "C" means that the tire meets
minimal federal standards measured in laboratory testing, while "B"
and "A" indicate increasingly better performance above the
government minimum.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Traction: A/B/C</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Grades straight-line wet braking performance. A
is best, C is worst.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Treadwear: Numeric Grade</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Rates the tire against a control standard with a
defined rating of 100 when run on a test course. A rating of 300,
for instance, indicates that the tire will give three times the
mileage of the control tire. One rated 60 would be expected to wear
out in 60% of the control tire's mileage.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">1.E. M&amp;S Designation</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Indicates an all-season tire designed for Mud &
Snow use. Note that this does *not* mean that this is a "snow tire"
(see Section 6).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">1.F. Max. Load</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">This is the maximum static weight, usually in
both pounds and kilograms, that the tire can support.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">1.G. Max. Press.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The Maximum Pressure (usually in PSI and kPa)
that the tire is designed to handle. This is *not* the recommended
pressure, which is set by the car manufacturer and stated in the
owners manual as well as on a sticker in the door jamb or glovebox
lid (see Section 2).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">1.H. Construction</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The number and composition of the tread and
sidewall plies are listed on the sidewall, for example:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Tread Plies: 2 polyester cord + 1 steel cord + 1
nylon cord</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Sidewall Plies: 2 Polyester Cord</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">1.I. DOT Serial Number</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">All tires approved for street use in the U.S. by
the Department of Transportation will display a DOT Serial
Number.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">1.J. Manufacture Date</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">All tires are coded to indicate the week of
manufacture. Look for a three digit number following the DOT Serial
Number. The date code will be stamped rather than molded. The first
two digits are the week of the year in which the tire was
manufactured (01 thru 52), followed by the final digit from the
year of manufacture. A tire stamped "134" was manufactured in the
13th week (the week of April 4th in this case) of 1994.</font></p>
<p><font size=
"+1">========================================================================</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">2. Tire Care: Inflation & Rotation</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">What inflation pressure should I use in my
tires?</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">As stated in 1.G. above, recommended tire
pressures are set by the car manufacturer, not by the tire
manufacturer. They're stated in the owners manual as well as on a
sticker in the door jamb or on the glovebox lid. It's important to
check pressures frequently; at least once a month - more often if
you find that you're losing pressure. For consistency, always
measure pressures before driving when the tires are cold (parked
for at least four hours; preferably overnight).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Tire pressure affects your car as
follows:</font></p>
<pre><font size="+1">
                Lower Pressures         Higher Pressures

Ride            more comfortable        stiffer

Handling        less precise            better feel & turn-in

Wear            more on edges           more in the center

Gas mileage     lower                   higher (less rolling resistance)

Tracking        steady                  tends to follow grooves

</font></pre>
<p><font size="+1">Many car manufacturers are conservative (low)
with their recommended pressures to maintain a comfortable ride.
Drivers who push their cars fairly hard usually prefer a slightly
higher setting. If you want to experiment, 32 all around is a good
starting point - begin there adjust to your own
preferences.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The outside temperature affects your tire
pressures; a general rule of thumb is that a 10 degree fahrenheit
change will change tire pressure by 1 psi. When temperatures are
fluctuating, check your pressures more often. And if you check them
in a heated garage, adjust for the colder outside temps.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">How about rotation?</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Recommendations for tire rotation patterns and
mileage intervals vary; check your car's Owners Manual and the tire
manufacturer's recommendations for some guidelines. As a general
rule, rotation is advised at least every 10,000 miles. It may be
prudent to rotate more often if you're using ultra high performance
tires that wear quickly, or if your car's suspension settings tend
to wear the tires at one end of the car at a much more rapid pace.
Many people find it convenient and a helpful reminder to rotate
their tires along with their oil change schedule, every 7,500 miles
for the typical car or every other change for those with more
frequent changes. YMMV! &lt;g&gt;</font></p>
<p><font size=
"+1">========================================================================</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">3.A. Alternate Sizing - Why Do It?</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Variations from the OEM tire size are usually
done to improve a car's handling and performance. Except in the
case of snow tires (see Section 5), a common goal is to get a wider
tire and/or shorter sidewalls without changing the overall diameter
of the tire. Wider tread width changes the tire's contact patch and
can lead to a big improvement in handling. In general, more rubber
on the road provides a better grip. A shorter sidewall (lower
aspect ratio) provides less flex which can improve turn-in,
responsiveness and stability. Keeping the overall tire height as
close to stock as possible reduces the chance that changes will
impact the accuracy of the car's speedometer and odometer, overall
gearing, suspension dynamics and introduce potential clearance
problems.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Note Well: With any change from the OEM size,
clearance between the tire, fender, fender wells and suspension
components is a vital concern. Also, expect variations from
calculated tire dimensions; whenever possible, measure the actual,
mounted tire.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">3.B. How do I calculate Tire Height and
Rotations Per Mile?</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">A tire's theoretical height in inches is
calculated as follows:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Height = (Width x (Ratio/100) x .03937 x 2) +
Rim Diameter</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The width multiplied by the aspect ratio over
100 gives the height in millimeters, multiplying by .03937 converts
to inches, and doubling this accounts for the fact that there's
tire at the bottom and the top of the rim.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Rotations Per Mile (RPM) can be calculated as
follows:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">RPM = (inches per mile) / Tire
Circumference</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">= (5280*12) / (Height*3.1416)</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">= 20,168 / Height</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Some sample calculations of tire height and RPM
are shown below:</font></p>
<pre><font size="+1">
               Height   RPM   Error  @60MPH   Note:

    205 60 15   24.69   817      -     60.0   Stock size

    225 55 15   24.74   815     0.2%   60.1   Wider tire on stock

    225 50 16   24.86   811     0.7%   60.4   Plus One

    245 45 16   24.68   817     0.0%   60.0   Plus One

    245 40 17   24.72   816     0.1%   60.1   Plus Two

    245 35 18   24.75   815     0.3%   60.2   Plus Three

    185 65 15   24.47   824    -0.9%   59.5   Snow tire alternative

</font></pre>
<font size="+1">It may be helpful to set up a simple spreadsheet to
determine options. Height and RPM calculations are given above,
while the error and speed at an indicated 60mph are calculated from
the RPM as compared to the stock size. An error of less than 1%
almost always indicates a very good match.</font>
<p><font size="+1">3.C. Can I put wider tires on my stock
rims?</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The cheapest way to pick up additional
performance is usually to get a slightly wider tire with a lower
aspect ratio for use on the stock rim. For example, a stock
205/60-15 tire can be replaced by a 225/50-15 with almost no
variation in overall diameter. Note well that in addition to the
clearance considerations listed above, the width of the stock rim
also needs to be able to accommodate the wider tire. A 6" wide rim
easily accommodates a 205/60 tire, but is at the low end of
recommended rim widths for most manufacturers' 225/50 tires.
Wherever possible, seek advice from the tire manufacturer or other
owners of your car to see what width tire your stock rims can
accommodate.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">3.D. What's a Plus One, Plus Two or Plus Three
conversion?</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Also shown as "+1", "+2" or "+3", these
designations indicate switching from stock rims to rims of 1, 2 or
3 inch larger diameter. Going to a larger diameter rim while
keeping overall tire height about the same can allow for a
significantly wider, shorter tire which can have a dramatic effect
on a car's handling, ride and appearance.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">As shown in 2.B. above, potential replacements
for a stock 205/60-15 can range from a prudent +1 combination like
225/50-16 to a rather outrageous 245/35-18 for a +3 conversion.
Note that price increases are not linear; although 18 and even 19
inch tires and rims are available, they can cost several times what
a 15 or 16 inch setup will run.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">4.A. Buying Tires - What brands and models are
best?</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">There are no "best" choices. What's good for you
is highly dependent upon your car and your preferences. With that
in mind, here's a broad listing of some of the tires most
frequently recommended by users of the CARS forum, broken down by
type:</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">4.B. What factors are important to consider when
choosing tires?</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The best tire depends upon a wide variety of
factors, and the more specific you can be when asking a pro for
advice, the better advice you're likely to receive:</font></p>
<pre><font size="+1">

 - What car, truck or minivan do you drive?

 - What's the stock tire size?  Are you considering a change?

 - How do you drive? Is your driving style aggressive, passive or in-between?

 - Where do you drive?  City, highway, back roads, mountains, at the track?

 - In what kind of weather?  What's your regional climate?  Is the car used 
   year round?  How much snow or heavy rain do you get?

 - What's most important to you?  How would you prioritize traction, ride 
   comfort, treadwear, steering response, handling and noise?

 - What's your price expectation?  How important is value compared to the 
   tire performance items you prioritized above?

 - Do you have any particular brands or models in mind?  Have you had good 
   or bad experiences with any models in the past?  How did your current 
   tires perform?

</font></pre>
<p><font size="+1">4.C. How do I choose between Performance,
Touring and All Seasons?</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Tough question! Here are some random thoughts
and notes to help:</font></p>
<pre><font size="+1">

 - Ultra High performance tires provide more traction and performance than 
   can be used safely on the street. They are a waste of money for most 
   drivers and most cars unless they are used as a dual purpose street/racing 
   tire.  Tire life under 10,000 miles should be expected on some car models.

 - High Performance tires also provide more traction and performance than 
   a responsible driver should be using on the street. But by doing so, they 
   increase the safety margin in emergency handling maneuvers. There are some 
   very competitive, cost-effective models in this classification; it isn't 
   necessary to spend big bucks to get a dramatic performance and safety 
   improvement over original equipment tires.

 - The "Touring" designation is relatively new. Definitions may vary between 
   manufacturers, but most are marketed as competent year 'round performers 
   that are better than an all-season for performance driving and better than 
   a performance tire in slippery conditions.

 - A true All Season tires has a "M+S" (mud & snow) designation on its 
   sidewall. All Seasons usually do much better than performance tires in 
   mud, snow or slush, but it's something of a misconception that they also do 
   better in wet conditions. In tire tests (see Section 7), performance tires 
   did better in wet handling and braking than All Seasons. In general, All 
   Seasons are a compromise solution that let you use the same tires year-
   round, even where snow is expected. Using performance tires and a set of 
   snow tires (see Section 5) is recommended by many CARS forum regulars.

</font></pre>
<p><font size="+1">4.C. Which All Season tires do best in the
snow?</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Richard Engel [76614,3653] of The Tire Warehouse
in Edmonton, Alberta offered that the Dunlop D65, Axiom and Sport
4000, Pirelli P300 and Yokohama Y370/Y378 are several top
performers in the snow, but he's quick to remind everyone that to
get the best traction, you need a set of winter tires.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">4.D. Where should I buy my tires?</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Perhaps the best way to buy tires is to find a
knowledgeable, local shop who has reasonable prices, competent
service people, modern equipment and gives honest advice. As far as
national chains, Super Shops have been recommended as a great place
on all counts. Town Fair Tire stores in the Northeast sometimes
have good prices if you negotiate, but their recommendations are
frequently biased by what's profitable or in stock and service can
be spotty.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Among mail order firms, the Tire Rack at
(800)428-8355 has been recommended hundreds of times for good
advice, excellent availability and very competitive prices. If you
call, ask for Robert at x307 or Scott at x343. Tire Rack also has a
web presence at http://www.tirerack.com - it was new as of 4/96,
but already a very impressive interface with good content and
(very) speedy operation. Highly recommended!</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Discount Tire Direct at (800)707-8473 also has
retail outlets and does their best to beat Tire Rack's pricing and
delivery. TeleTire (800)835-8473 doesn't carry as many
manufacturers as some other firms, but also pledges to try to give
the best price. EuroTire (800)631-0080 takes phone orders in
addition to selling through their retail stores, but carries a
limited brand selection.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">5. What about snow tires?</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">For snow tires, narrower and taller usually
works better than the stock tire size, and some experts recommend
considering a "Minus One" conversion, especially for cars equipped
with wide tires. The sample calculations in 2.B. above are also
used for determining narrower snow tires sizes and for Minus One
conversions, i.e.:</font></p>
<pre><font size="+1">

               Height  RPM*   Error  @60MPH   Note:

    275 40 17   25.66   786    -       60.0   Stock size

    205 60 16   25.69   785     0.1%   60.1   Minus One


               Height  RPM*   Error  @60MPH   Note:

    205 50 15   23.07   874    -       60.0   Stock size

    185 55 15   23.01   876    -0.3%   59.8   Narrower Snow Tire on Stock Rim
</font></pre>
<p><font size="+1">For serious driving in the snow, regular or
all-season tires are no match for a good set of four snow tires.
Among CARS forum members, the most frequently mentioned models are
the Pirelli 190P & 210P and the Bridgestone Blizzak. The Pirellis
are a very good all-around choice for a snow tire with reasonable
dry performance and treadwear expectations, and the new Pirelli S/P
is a good choice for a severe duty, studdable tire.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The Blizzaks were only recently introduced, but
already have a lot of fans. They provide great traction on slippery
surfaces, but their dual compound tread design means that they may
not be a good choice for all situations. Once the Blizzak's tread
is worn below 55%, it is designed to work as an all-season tire
rather than a snow tire. This may work well for someone who puts
high annual mileage on their car, expects to replace their tires
yearly and prefers not to have to keep a second set of tire. By
purchasing a new set of Blizzaks in the late fall, you can insure
optimal snow traction throughout the winter. As the tires wear
down, you get a competent all-season to use until the next
replacement cycle. As an alternative, someone who puts lower
mileage on their car can keep a set of Blizzaks through several
winters by installing them just before snow starts and removed in
early Spring.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Nokia Hakkapeliittas deserve a special mention
as perhaps the premium snow tire which is used by more rallyists
than any other brand. Because of limited distribution, they can be
difficult to find, but several forum members have recommended Greer
Enterprises in Milwaukee (414-744-0996) as a source for Nokia
tires.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Do I *need* four snow tires?</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The question of 2 vs. 4 snows has been raised
several times. While convent- ional wisdom used to be that putting
snows on the drive wheels was sufficient, more recent
recommendations have been to use all four. Why? The primary concern
is that snows and all-seasons have dramatically different handling
characteristics.<br></font></p>
