<h3>Westfalia Jalousie Windows ('67-earlier Type 2)</h3>
<p>by Jim Ellis (aka Rusty VanBondo)</p>
<hr size="2"/>
<p><font size="+1">Removal and Disassembly:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">In pursuit of the completion of the infamous '67
Westy Resto from "Heck" the VanBondo tribe decided to detail the
dickens out of the five louvered glass camper windows. Additional
windows were acquired at various shows and junkyards during the
eternal wait for the completion of the body and paint processes.
Most of the time they can be had for cheap and are in sad
disrepair. Elbow grease and clock time can make these puppies
really look and work nice.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">During the initial tear-down of the bus we
carefully removed the delicate painted metal trim pieces from
around each of the windows. In the SO-42 interiors these trim
frames were painted to resemble wood. Easily bent, they were placed
in a safe location until they would be put back into service. Next
we very carfully removed the screen from each window. Press on the
top of each screen frame sliding it toward the roof of the bus.
Select a very thin tool, possibly a small standard blade
screwdriver (if necessary!) and slip it between the frame and the
bottom of the screen frame and help it out of it's track. BE
CAREFUL as the screen material (if still intact) will be real
delicate and will rip very easily! The screen frames themselves
have a tendancy to fold and crease if given enough pressure. (Been
there, etc.) Take your time. Place the screens in a secure spot,
maybe in a box, for later. The window frame assemblies themselves
were carefully extracted from the bus via several screws located
around the perimeter of each window on the inside of the van. Have
a helper on the exterior of the bus to prevent the frames from
accidentially falling to the ground and becoming damaged. Set them
aside, out of foot stepping range, as they are removed.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Once we had the frame assemblies removed from
the vehicle, we had to make a decision as to whether to make them
look stock or jazz them up a bit. Inspired by a nice white SO-42
that we saw at both the '95 and '96 SOTO Garden Grove show, we
decided to polish the frames to a high polish. Highly polished
jalousie windows are not stock but they kinda look similar to
chrome and set off the generally utilitarian nature of the beast
when completed. The alternative might be to have the frames glass
beaded or attacked with 3M scuff pads. Stock, original camper
windows of this type have a understated satin appearence and look
nice also. It's a personal taste thing. The amout of detail that
you put into these windows is up to you and will determine whether
they will have rattling glass, retain the dreaded draftiness, and
look sharp (either polished or OEM) or tattered, dirty, and
dull.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Starting with frames which had the typical
thirty plus years of dinge on them we dissasembled them down to the
bare frames. Removal of the three main slats of tempered glass
should be accomplished via the back (top) side of the three pairs
of hinged aluminum holders. Carefully maneuver the glass away from
each pair of rotating aluminum holders. I have seen sets of window
frames ruined by attempts at glass removal by the front (or lower)
end of each pair of holders. The aluminum which makes up the
rotating pairs of holders can withstand only a certain amount
bending. Radical tweaking of the arms will result in ruined and
worthless frames. Retracting the glass from the frame involves a
combination of rotating the crank handles to various positions and
a touch of experience with Japanese puzzles. Take your time and
look at the frame closely. You will eventually figure them out.
Each window frame has one singular stationary piece of glass
postioned at the top of the frame. This remaining piece is removed
by undoing the single phillips head screws, one on each side of the
frame.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">We chose to carefully remove the six highly
weathered grey rubber retention (rattle) stoppers on each frame.
These rubber bumper pieces are located between the glass and the
frame at the end of each piece of movable glass. If dried to the
point at which you choose to remove them, try gentle prying with a
small standard blade screwdriver or small needle nosed plyers. The
key word to doing these windows is "gently." Next separate the two
halves of the main frame assemblies by removing the eighteen
phillips head screws from the perimeter of each frame. Gently pry
the two halves apart and remove the dried putty type material that
is stuck on the pieces. Try a wood popcycle stick or fat edged
ceramic tool to prevent scratching the frames.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The last item to be removed is the crank
assembly. I found that cranking the window approximately half way
open and removing the two phillips screws to be the first part. The
second part is to look in between the main frame and the sliding
piece that keeps the three slat holders in synch. Wiggle the crank
handle assembly until the round disk shape that is inserted into
the guide piece lifts free. Use your finger or the light touch of a
screwdriver to assist if necessary.</font></p>
<hr/>
<blockquote><font size="+1"><i>...replaced the seals on one
jalousie window, boy was that more work than I expected. The metal
looked good once I scraped off the concrete like glue used on the
inner aluminum frame.</i></font></blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">VanBondo suspects that the "concrete like glue"
was a rock hard vesion of the "putty tape" that is readily
available at any RV or trailer sales and supplier. The putty is
exaclty like the window sash putty that was/is used in older style
home window frames. The putty tape comes in a roll with a crepe
paper liner. It is produced in a consistant thickness and width.
The crepe keeps it from sticking together while rolled up like a
roll of tape. (I think that I have made that clear enough...) It is
real cheap and definitely in need of being replaced. It is the real
seal between the weather and the interior of your bus. The grey
rubber outer seal is technically a "dust seal."</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Check with your hardware supplier or
professional paint supplier. I think that there might be a chance
that some form of mineral spirits, paint thinner etc. **In a well
ventilated area away from flames** might help to soften the
petrified putty. Check with a professional for advice.</font></p>
<hr/>
<p><font size="+1">Over all, the refurbishing of these windows is a
lot of common sense, patience and tons of literal lubrication and
the other kind of grease as mentioned. No need to force anything!
Simply remove the wormy gear/handle mechanism via the two screws
that hold it in place. Use a lot of common sense an really look at
how it all goes together/comes apart. Most of the problems with
these windows are caused by dirt and lack of lube. The glass can be
removed from the inside once the slats can be rotated about half
way open. *DONT* pry the aluminum holders and try to remove the
glass from the bottom of each holder. The aluminum cracks pretty
easily. Thank goodness I had more than one set to mess with when
doing mine.</font></p>
<hr/>
<p><font size="+1">It boils down to elbow grease and tons of
polish. The windows can be disassembled fairly easily. A medium
satin sheen would be stock. Taking the frames to someone who
polished aluminum for the Harley/Hotrod crowd could make them look
almost like chrome (which is not stock but looks nice). You can
coose to clear coat the frames if the "chrome" appearence is to be
retained. Otherwise the sheen will gradually return to the stockish
look.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Use stainless steel screws when reassembling the
windows. get them from your local specialty fastener supplier. Take
examples with you in order to match them up.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">New/NOS Stock dustseals are impossible to
locate. Buy up these camper window frames at swap meets until you
obtain enough seals that look good enough.</font></p>
<hr/>
<p><font size="+1">I recently discovered a supplier of a screen
material that might be worth looking at if you need to repair or
replace the screens in your camper. This stuff looks like it would
be aestheically appealing in all generations of campers. The
material is fine mesh enough to approximate the old splittie
screens in the Jalousie windows and would still be nice in the
Euros etc. Designed to resist damage by kids and pets. The display
had a pic of a Collie with paws *leaning* on the stuff!!!

Hardware.</font></p>
<hr/>
<p><font size="+1">Don't force the jalousie windows!!!!! Remove the
two screws that hold the crank mechanism to the window frame and
gingerly work to get the whole crank assembly apart from the frame.
Look for dirt and misalignment. Clean and relube with white lith
grease. I have found that 99% of the time that jalousie windows
fail to open/crank due to old grease and dirt. The other percent is
from their owners reefing on them with vice grips! I have found
that speaking sweetly, spending time examining, cleaning, and lots
of lubrication gets you further than forcing yourself.</font></p>
