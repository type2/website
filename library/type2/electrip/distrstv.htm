<h3>Distributor Advance</h3>
<p>by Steve Denis</p>
<hr size="2">
<p><font size="+1">As we all seem to be both shaken *and* stirred
about the poor 009 I'll jump in to muddle it *all* up. VW engineers
operate(ed) under the same parameters as do their counterparts
everywhere: make a perfect product, that costs nothing to produce,
and sells for all the money in the world. *Or* build and ship
*anything* so your "end of the month" (1/4 year) looks
good.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Let's look at that distributor.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The V-dub had many different types of
distributors and carburetors over the years. With a given carb,
manifold, valve size, cam and compression ratio the engine will
need a spark right *now*, at any temperature, air pressure, load
and fuel type.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">If your engine ran at one speed, temperature,
and load it would only need a fixed spark timing. A typical Briggs
and Stratton has just such a set up. Although on long hills it
*seems* that you only have one speed, the engine has to perform
under many different types of conditions, hence the advance
"curve".</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">We all understand that the spark has to happen
sooner at high speeds to allow the mixture time to burn and reach
the peak pressure *just* when we need it. Modern engines do this
electronically with computer "maps" and knock sensors. At any given
set of conditons the computer signals the coil(s) to fire the plug
at the time it thinks it *needs* to. The knock sensor is a feedback
device to let the computer know if it got a *wee* bit carried away
on the advance. It will drop back just a *smidge* and run the
engine right at the edge of detonation.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The older cars had to do this mechanically, so
right off the bat the system has a lot of built in margin. Ain't no
feedback on a 57 bug...until you blow a hole in a
piston.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Total mechanical advance</b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">What this represents is the basic timing setting
for the engine at any RPM at wide open throttle under the "worst
case" conditions of pressure and temperature (maybe minus a bit for
safety). It's all the advance the engine will take at that rpm
under wide open throttle.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"Put an 009 in my bug--I'll get more power
'cause it's just like the Porsche distributor!!"
Umm..well.....no...</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Porsche didn't bother with a vacuum advance. The
idea was that you would *always* be at wide open throttle. If not,
why did you buy this car??? So the vacuum advance would never come
in to play anyway. Ditto for the early transporter. Look at an
early splitty. The gas pedal is bent to match the contour of the
floor where some cat spent all his time trying to push it into the
pavement. So for some engines, VW (Bosch) made mechanical advance
distributors.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"Ok" for full power settings, but at lower
throttle settings, engines can use some more advance. Reason?
<b>The flame front moves slower as the mixture in the cylinder gets
less dense</b>. So we can get started earlier and catch the peak
pressure just where we want it, even at low outputs. This helps the
engine temperature, as the mixture is not burning late, helps the
power, as the peak pressure is at the right place in the stroke,
and helps the fuel economy as the fuel is being used
effectively.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The *full* vacuum advance VW distributors are
nothing of the sort. If you put one on a distributor machine and
run it up without the vacuum hooked up, it *still* advances!
Huh???</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">It has a crude mechanical advance: the friction
of the rubbing block on the cam drags the breaker plate around and
changes the position of the points.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"Ok, you, the wiseguy in the back
row."</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"Ah, yeah man--but if it pulls the points around
with the cam, doesn't that *retard* the time?"</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"Remind me to give you an A on the next
quiz."</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Yes, that is true. *BUT* the breaker plate swing
is not concentric with the cam and the change in *dwell* advances
the time more than it gets retarded! Clever, no? Ford did this for
*years* with a vengeance. Look at a mid-sixties Ford with the pivot
point out near the edge of the cap!</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The vacuum adds advance at anything less than
about WOT. It uses what is called "Ported" vacuum. It's blocked off
at an idle, but as soon as the thottle opens, it gets full manifold
vacuum. There is a built in lag in the vacuum advance that allowed
you to change throttle settings quickly and snap back to where you
were and the advance would not have a chance to change (much). This
makes the engine seem "smoother". You are unable to "suprise" the
thing with quick throttle motions. This is what John Muir was
saying about having to keep your foot on the gas with
"elan".</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">These "vacuum" distributors worked well for the
limited rpm range and the typical bug driving conditions. All was
well, not *great*, but hey, it was cheap and it ran
well.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">As the car got heavier and speeds went up they
needed more power *and* economy from the flat 4. They finally gave
in and put a mechanical advance with a vacuum advance to get the
best of both worlds. A combo unit that acts like a full mechanical
under full power (because it *is* a full mechanical) and adds more
advance under low throttle settings when the engine needs and wants
it. Great, the best (mechanical) system! Then in step the smog
regulators. Oh boy. What is good for the engine, fuel economy and
power is *not* always good for the air. More power, better economy
and smog *too*?! argggggh!</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Then VW went to the dual port 1600 and power
went up to 60 hp! The bigger manifold has a larger internal volume.
Due to all kinds of strange atmospherics in the manifold, the pulse
through the carb is "softened" with this "big" manifold. Years
before, this simply meant bigger main jets or smaller air
correction jets. But now the emisson/economy gremlins were out in
force and this was not allowed. And,let's face it, the upright has
a *weird* manifold setup anyway. They brought everything right to
the edge: jetting, ignition timing, cam and valve timing. And when
everything is spot on the car ran pretty well.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Let one thing get "loose" and God couldn't get
it to run right. *Blame* the carb, *blame* the distributor. But ask
yourself, is the:</font></p>
<ul>
<li><font size="+1">carb *perfectly* clean</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">good throttle shaft bushings</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">centered and un-worn throttle plate</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">float height</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">fuel pressure</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">pre-heated air hooked up? Adjusted
correctly?</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">valves set? (Cam bearings worn
out?)</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">heat riser un-cloggged?</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">distributor set up *exactly* to spec on a
distributor machine??? (the specs are in the book)</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">manifold boots in good nick?</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">proper (metal) gaskets under the intake
castings at the head?</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">engine thermostat set correctly? (or did the
previous owner bin it?)</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Correct plugs with the correct wires and
ends?</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font size="+1">When you have checked/adjusted all of this and
the car *still* dosen't run correctly, you have a beef. Until then,
fussing with different distributors or screwing with the carb is a
waste of time. Do what you want/can with what you have. <b>Chances
are your *best* bet for the 1600 dual port is a vacuum/mechanical
unit.</b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Oh yeah: the <b>dual diaphragm distributor</b>.
It used manifold vacuum to retard the spark so much that at an idle
that the heads ran hot enough to burn off the rich mixture required
by all engines at that speed. As soon as you crack the throttle, it
springs back to the base setting and acts like a single diaphragm
unit.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The 72 bus (1700) used a vacuum advance cut-off:
no vacuum advance until you hit high gear. It's the little gizmo
next to the heater fan and the "extra" back-up light switch on the
tranny.</font></p>
