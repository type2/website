<h3>EberspÃ¤cher B2 Gas Heater For Beetle/Ghia</h3>
<p>by Joe Helwig</p>
<hr size="2">
<p><font size="+1">(**Bracketed [] corrections were made by Thomas
Johnson when Joe's email originally appeared on the bus mailing
list.)</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I have enclosed my 'standard' spiel about the B2
model. When working on gas heaters, practice safety. Do things
slowly, and think about each step before doing the procedure. Gas
heaters are great winter heaters if they are maintained. If they
are not maintained, they can be dangerous. Never fire up a gas
heater UNLESS you know its history, AND/OR you have completed all
the gas heater systems checks. ALWAYS have a fire extinguisher, and
ALWAYS work in a well ventilated area. If you have done extensive
work on your vehicle and you are comfortable being your own
mechanic (ie: rebuilding engine, rebuilding carbs, etc), you should
be able to tune up a B2 model gas heater. If you are uncomfortable
with tuning the heater, take it to a pro. It's better to pay out
some cash than risk blowing yourself up. Now with that out of the
way...</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The B2 model gas heater is a 12 [or 6] volt
system. It's mounted on the drivers' side of the car (bug/ghia),
and is turned on by a lever in the passenger compartment (near the
hood release). When the lever is pulled, the gas heater is turned
on. The gas heater uses a low volume, low pressure electric fuel
pump to deliver the fuel from the car's gas tank to a jet in the
gas heater, which restricts how much fuel is delivered to the
combustion chamber. Any excess fuel is rerouted to the car's gas
tank. The ignition source is a 4 volt glow plug [hooked up to a
series resistance]. Air for the combustion chamber is sucked in
from under the front of the car. The exhaust is passed thru the
fender well, and released in the wheel well. The intake air is
sucked from inside the car's cabin, passed thru a heat exchanger
(combustion chamber provides the heat), and blown into the car - it
is a recirculating heater. [Most are non-recirculating. I think
(but can't yet prove) that '70 was the only year for a
recirculating B2.]</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">A thermostat kicks the fan into high speed when
the air is warmed to temperature. When the lever is pushed in
(heater is turned off), the fuel pump and glow plug are turned off,
but the fan motor keeps working until the air is cooled down. Gas
heaters do require routine maintenance which includes: cleaning the
contact points on the fuel pump; cleaning the glow plug; cleaning
the jet; inspecting fuel lines for cracks; cleaning the combustion
chamber (carb cleaner - the kind that is added to gas tank); and
inspecting the exhaust system for rust. [Quote from the B2 manual
regarding the event of a breach of the heat exchanger: "Since the
static pressure on the fresh air side is higher than on the gas
mixture side, exhaust gas cannot blend with the fresh air, even if
the heat exchanger is not hermetic, and any danger that such gasses
may enter the passenger cabin is excluded." This is true for all
EberspÃ¤chers.]</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">To install the heater into a Type I, (BN4
heaters are usually installed in busses) you will have to cut the
following holes:</font></p>
<pre><font size="+1">
- combustion chamber air intake (fender well - 1" diameter),
- combustion exhaust (fender well - 2" diameter),
- recirculate air intake (underside of dash 3.25" diameter), and
- heated air vent (underside of dash - 3.25" diameter).
- control lever (near hood release - 0.25" diameter)
</font></pre>
<p><font size="+1">You will also need to put a 'pickup' in your
fuel tank (mounts on the top of the fuel tank) to feed fuel to the
gas heater, and to return unused gas. This would involve drilling a
hole in the top of the fuel tank (scary, eh - do not do this to an
old gas tank). You can get around this by getting a fuel tank with
one already installed, or getting a professional to drill a hole in
a new gas tank.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The wiring is very simple - you connect the
power wire to the fusebox (a fuse that is always 'hot'- #8 in the
early bugs, #7 or #9 on later bugs). You also have to connect a
ground wire."</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The following instructions are for the B2 model
ONLY. Different models have more/different safety systems, and
consequently, different procedures. I have 'developed' the
procedures from tuning up gas heaters for myself and for my friends
(never for profit, though).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">You can check the gas heaters parts separately,
but you will need a well ventilated area, and have a good 12 volt
power supply (a car battery fully charged works nicely), as well as
a fire extinguisher (hey, you never know...). I always pull the
heater from the vehicle prior to inspecting it. After removing the
heater from the car/bus, make sure that there is no residual
gasoline left in the heater. Test the fuel pump by removing the
power wire from the pump. Give the pump 12 volt positive, and
ground the heater case with the neg wire. It should make rapid
clicking sounds. The solenoid electro-magnet) pulls the diaphragm
up. As the diaphragm moves up, it causes a set of breaker points to
open - power is cut to the solenoid. A strong spring causes the
diaphragm to move down, and the points touch each other, causing
the diaphragm to go up. The up/down movement of the diaphragm is
what pumps the fuel. The clicking sound is the diaphragm moving
very quickly. When the heater is running, the diaphragm 'clicks'
when the back pressure of fuel becomes low (the jet restricts the
amount of fuel delivered to the heater).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">If it doesn't click, remove the pump from the
heater. Open up the pump. Look at the rubber diaphragm, and inspect
it for rips/tears. Look at the solenoid, and look for cracks. The
fuel pump relies on breaker points to actuate the solenoid. If the
solenoid is not actuating, it is due to a fried solenoid (bad -
toss solenoid), fried points (scavenge points from another fuel
pump) or to the points not being set properly. To set the points, I
rely on trial and error. I started with a wide gap, and then tested
the pump to see if the pump actuated. I kept closing the points
down little by little, and testing each setting. Eventually, I got
to the 'proper' setting. I did write it down, but I lost the note
(doh!). Make sure the points don't have ridges before you try to
set them (use a fine emery paper and gently sand the points to
remove ridges).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I use ethanol alcohol to test the pump (non
corrosive, and non-explosive). Inspect the gas lines and look for
cracks. Hell, replace the fuel lines with some high quality fuel
lines. With the fuel feed line in alcohol and to the pump, and the
return line from the pump positioned over the alcohol so you can
see the ethanol being pumped, start the fuel pump. It should click
away, pumping the alcohol. Now place your finger over the return
line (blocking it). It should NOT click with the return line
blocked (if it does, a torn diaphragm or a leaky fuel line is
present). If you gently release pressure on the return line, the
pump should be clicking, and delivering fuel. The fuel pump test is
complete. Blow out the fuel pump and the lines with compressed air
(ethanol can eat rubber if it is in contact with the rubber for few
days). Put the pump back on the heater, and discard the ethanol.
Remove the jet, and blow air thru the jet. Do NOT use a wire to
clean the jet, as the size of the jet's hole is critical for the
heater to function (if hole is too big, you will flood the heater).
Replace the jet, and the fuel system inspection is
complete.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Next, remove the glow plug from the heater. I
use a Dremel (TM) tool with a wire brush attachment to clean all
the rust/crap off the glow plug body, as well as where it screws
into the heater. [With the correct voltage applied] it should glow
red in about 10 seconds or so. If it doesn't glow, the plug is
shot. If the plug glows red, you have spark.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Attach the + to the main power feed on the gas
heater. Put the neg wire on the heater body. Pull the lever. The
fan motor should start at low speed. On the thermostat bridge there
is an adjustment screw. Gently turn the adjustment screw until the
fan kicks into high speed. Now push the power lever to the off
position. The fan should still be on high. Turn the thermostat
adjustment screw until the fan stops. If the fan worked at high and
low speed and is not making horrible screeching sounds (bad
bearings), the fan is good. If the fan didn't come on, the brushes
in the motor are shot or you have electrical 'concerns'. If you
have a DVM or a current probe, check the power from: a) the
battery; b) from the thermostat bridge, c:) the fuel pump; and d)
the glow plug. When lever is in the on position, all the above
should be getting power (both fan settings). With the fan on high
and the lever in the off position, their should be NO power to the
fuel pump and the glow plug.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Now, carefully remove the thermostat from the
heater, but keep all the electrical connections on it. With the
power lever on, use a propane torch to heat the thermostat sensor
up. The fan should kick into high speed. Turn the power off, and
remove the propane torch. When the thermostat has cooled, the fan
should shut off. Put the thermostat back on the heater. If the fan
did not shut off when the thermostat cooled, turn the thermostat
adjustment screw until it turns off, and repeat the
test.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Now that all systems check out (hopefully),
inspect the exhaust pipe on the heater. You may have to go to a
muffler place, and have them replace the exhaust pipe. On my '64's
gas heater -uncertain model, (not EberspÃ¤cher) but it is HUGE- the
previous owner extended the exhaust pipe down to the running board.
This prevented the exhaust from being blown on the tire, and helps
to limit the amount of exhaust that is sucked back into the exhaust
chamber/ or back into the car. Inspect the air intake hose to the
combustion chamber, and replace if necessary. Replace the gas
heater in the car, and start the car. Start up the gas heater (have
fire extinguisher handy). The heater should fire up in less than 30
seconds. If it doesn't, something is wrong turn it off immediately,
and locate the problem. Allow the heater to vent the gas it
contains (it will be flooded) by waiting for at least 30 minutes
before you try again.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">If the heater fires up, let it run - there
probably be lots of smoke coming from the exhaust if the heater has
sat for a long time. Let it run until the exhaust smoke clears, and
check if it is putting out lots of heat. Turn the gas heater off,
and feel the temperature of the air from the fan. The fan should
turn off when it is cold. If it continues to run after the air is
cooled, adjust the thermostatic bridge screw. I usually use a
carbon monoxide sensor (from the private pilot store), and place it
so the heated air blows over it. Have all the windows closed, and
let the heater work for 20 - 30 minutes. The card should NOT
indicate any carbon monoxide. If it does, you have a leak, which
could have fatal consequences. I usually have a carbon monoxide
detector attached to the 'Oh My God' bar on the dash. I usually add
carb cleaner to the gas tank, and then have the heater operating as
I drive around. This will clean out both the carb and the gas
heater. Of course, you may cook yourself :).</font></p>
