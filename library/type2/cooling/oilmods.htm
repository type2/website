<h3>Engine/Oil Cooling Mods</h3>
<p>by Robert S. Hoover</p>
<hr size="2"/>
<p><font size="+1">I was never able to duplicate Gene's claimed
results regarding engine temperatures and external oil coolers.
Indeed, Gene never clearly defined what he was measuring. I believe
I've already mentioned this situation in an article on external oil
coolers.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">My original interest was in learning how the
Volkswagen engine was cooled so I could insure adequate cooling
when the engine was installed in an airplane -- converted VW
engines in airplanes being notorious for swallowing the rear-most
exhaust valves.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I dismantled the blower-housing from a 40-hp
engine (this was in the late sixties) and replaced it with a sheet
of plexiglas. Running on the test stand, I could introduce
smoke-streams and figure out what VW was trying to do. (Later, I
rigged the big squirrel-cage blower I used on my flow-bench to suck
air down thru an engine with the blower housing removed, using
Temp-L-sticks, thermistors and the like to gain some understanding
of the temperature change in the heads based on air-flow and engine
speed.)</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I discovered the major emphasis in the original
design was in providing the CORNERS of the engine with air, with a
very intricate series of air vanes and dams devoted to this
purpose. Because of the obstruction of the oil cooler, the left
head didn't flow very well and because of the offset of the
cylinders, #3 got the least air of all.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Removing the upright oil cooler brought an
immediate improvement in air-flow although you had to do something
about the 'hole'. I first tried various forms of air dam before
realizing I was going at the problem backwards. Adequate flow can
only come when there is adequate pressure and Volkswagens' method
of sustaining adequate pressure using a pair of deflector plates
and the tin-ware skirts across the ends of #2 &amp; #4 cylinder didn't
work very well. To maintain sufficient air pressure -- needed to
insure adequate flow to the 'corners' you must improve the cowling
of the underside of the cylinders, a step Volkswagen got around to
a few years later.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">For aircraft use, a tight upper plenum combined
with tight lower cylinder cowling did the trick. This was not a
popular fix because many of the light-plane designs do not include
pressure cowlings.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">There is also considerable improvement you can
make in the heads, getting rid of any casting flash and insuring
maximum air-flow down thru the fins around the exhaust
stacks.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I modified a number of Type IV's for use in
aircraft but all of the above work was done with the early model
engine.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Getting back to external oil coolers, the
dog-house cooler -- and that of the Type IV -- is an external-type,
in that air used to cool the oil is exhausted to the atmosphere and
not used for engine cooling.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">In one of my articles I described the auxiliary
oil cooler I designed for my '65 bus. I didn't give a lot of detail
about the design process but it involved making a manomoeter from
plastic tubing, plywood and colored water to measure the air
pressure inside the engine compartment. Addition of air scoops
caused a significant increase in engine compartment air-pressure.
While many still argue the merits of air-scoops on early buses one
need only examine the cooling-air inlets of later model buses to
see they too incorporate a scoop-type design.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Once I understood the problem I was able to come
up with the design of an auxiliary oil cooler that worked, and very
well too, as demonstrated on a run to Kansas City when I had to tow
a Westy over South Pass (outside of Needles, California) in
temperatures of over 100 degrees.</font></p>
<hr/>
<p><font size="+1">A couple of closing points.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I don't want to get into a pissing contest with
a dead man but I was never able to substantiate many of Gene Berg's
claims. Indeed, in many cases I couldn't even get him to explain
what he was measuring, where he was measuring it and how it was
measured. I said as much years before his untimely death. Nothing
has happened to change that.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The information I developed on auxiliary oil
cooling applies mostly to my '65 bus. The general principles MAY
apply to later-model buses but the wiser course would be to run
some tests before cutting metal.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I don't see any benefit in your idea of removing
the oil cooler in your Type IV. However, should you need an
auxilary oil cooler there are convenient means of installing such
without removing the stock oil cooler.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">All of the Type IV's I've seen that were
experiencing problems with overheating, the fault was due to poor
maintenance.... usually missing air-seals or tin-ware.</font></p>
