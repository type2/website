<h3>Aftermarket oil coolers</h3>
<p>by Robert S. Hoover</p>
<hr size="2">

<h2>Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About After-market Oil
Coolers</h2>
</center>
<font size="+1"><b>Fundamental Stuff</b></font>
<p><font size="+1">All reciprocating internal combustion engines
used in automobiles are 'air-cooled' in that their waste heat is
coupled to the atmosphere.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The main advantage of an air-cooled engine is
its lighter weight. The lack of radiator, water pump and hoses
translates into lower production costs. A lower parts count should
mean less maintenance and greater reliability but this isn't true
if the engine is required to operate near maximum output for long
periods, as is the case with the Volkswagen.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The success of air-cooling depends on the
physical properties of air, such as its density and temperature;
thicker air, such as found at sea level, will absorb more heat than
thinner, high altitude air such found at Denver, Mexico City, or
Bogota. The engine's ability to transfer waste heat to the air mass
depends on the velocity of the air flow over the engine's heat
conducting surfaces, the surface area of those conducting surfaces
and how well they conduct heat.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The success of a specific air-cooled engine,
such as the Volkswagen, depends largely on the capacity of its
blower, the shape of the air-containment shrouding, and the size &
efficiency of its oil cooler. If the displacement of the engine is
increased the factors above must be changed to insure the increased
heat load can be coupled to the atmosphere.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Background Stuff</b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><br>
The Volkswagen engine design dates from the early 1930's and
reflects remarkable innovation for that period. Using principles
adopted from motorcycle and aircraft engines, the first VW
prototypes were not fitted with any form of oil coolers, depending
on their deeply finned crankcase. When this proved unsuitable, a
variety of oil cooling methods were tried. A surviving photograph
from 1932 shows an engine fitted with an external oil cooler but it
was a plumber's nightmare. By making a minor modification to the
magnesium crankcase casting, it was possible to fit an oil cooler
within the blower housing. Hindsight has shown this to be a
compromise but the engine was less expensive to manufacture than
one having an external oil cooler and appeared capable of meeting
the durability specification of 100,000 kilometers before needing
major overhaul. The original Volkswagen was priced at 1,000 marks;
in the mid-1930's a low-cost car capable of delivering 56,000 miles
of service was unheard of.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The original Volkswagen engine was rated at 22
horsepower, its war-time version at 25. The original blower and oil
cooler design proved adequate for the task except in Africa. Engine
problems usually involved the failure of the #3 exhaust valve. The
#3 cylinder received the majority of its cooling air from the
exhaust of the oil cooler. Already heated by passage through the
oil cooler, #3 cylinder typically ran hotter than the other three.
The added heat stress caused the early failure of the #3 exhaust
valve.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Modern Times</b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Post-war development of the Volkswagen saw a
steady increase in engine displacement and thus waste heat. Engine
failures followed the now familiar pattern of #3 cylinder
swallowing its exhaust valve. But no significant changes were made
in either air flow or oil cooler efficiency until 1971, when
Volkswagen finally bit the bullet and redesigned the blower housing
to accept a larger fan. At the same time they adopted an oil cooler
having a higher heat transfer rate and moved it to a new location
outside of the blower housing, thus making it an external oil
cooler.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The redesigned oil cooler was housed in a
'dog-house' attached to the front of the blower housing. After
passing through the oil cooler the heated air was ducted out of the
engine compartment.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The new oil cooler is the same design used on
the Porsche and Corvair. Volkswagen used it earlier on the pancake
engines used to power Type III's.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The dog-house style oil coolers have enough
excess capacity to handle engines with displacements of
2000cc.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Aftermarket Stuff</b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Within a few years of their introduction to the
southwestern United States it was clear that the Volkswagen had a
problem keeping a cool head. Driven at highway speeds when the
temperature was above 90 degrees Fahrenheit insured your bug
wouldn't last very long. Early bug owners quickly learned they had
to keep their foot out of it or cross the desert at night. For bus
owners it was even more of a problem. The deserts of the southwest
were a lot farther from northern Europe than VW ever
imagined.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Those of us adventurous enough to do our own
repairs had good evidence that our engines would last longer if we
could get the oil cooler out of the blower housing. The usual
method was to make a hose adaptor that fit where the oil cooler
normally mounted, allowing us to put the oil cooler somewhere else,
usually in front of the air inlet to the blower housing so as to
get the benefit of the air flow. This didn't work very well due to
the small size of the stock oil cooler so a variety of alternatives
were tried, including heater cores and refrigeration coils. A large
heater core appeared to be the perfect solution since they were
widely available (they had remote heaters that mounted under the
rear seats) and most of them worked very well... until the first
cold morning, when they would burst. Refrigeration coils also
looked good, and even worked after a fashion, but the diameter of
refrigeration tubing was rather small. By the time you had enough
of it to do a good job of cooling, the flow of oil was so
restricted that you were liable to suffer a bearing failure, rather
than swallowing #3.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The interim solution was to use war surplus
aircraft oil coolers. You could mount two of them across the air
inlet behind the fan housing and no matter how large an engine you
were running (some of us tried modified motorcycle cylinders;
others used Corvair jugs) your engine would never
overheat.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Mounting the oil cooler over the air inlet was
of course a compromise since it pre-heated the cooling air. But it
was a better solution since it distributed the heat stress to all
four cylinders rather than roasting #3.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">By the late 1960's tube-type aftermarket oil
coolers were available specifically for Volkswagens. Unfortunately,
tube-type coolers have a host of problems: Most offer too much
restriction and many are made of copper and burst with depressing
regularity. On the cheaper models the cooling fins are not brazed
to the tube but simply pressed in place, presenting the heat flow
with a high-resistance path. VW owners seriously interested in
durability stuck with Corvair, Porsche and Harrison (aircraft-
type) oil coolers.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Most recently, a steel plate-type cooler has
become available. Intended to serve as a utility radiator for both
lubricating oil and transmission fluid, it was never aimed at the
Volkswagen market, although it was quickly adopted. The oil cooler
(which is available from J. C. Whitney [s/n 38XX1483T, about $50]
and others) may be mounted away from the engine when used with an
auxiliary fan, or to the back of the blower housing. Its steel
construction insures against leaks and while steel is not as good a
conductor of heat as aluminum, the large size of the radiator makes
it suitable for engines up to 2400cc.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Bernie Bergmann has made up a kit around this
cooler, including fittings, thermostatically controlled valve,
hose, auxiliary fan and thermostatically controlled fan switch.
(See the supplier list for Bernie's address & phone.)</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>General Conclusions</b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">An external oil cooler is not required on
dog-house engines up to 2000cc.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b><em>Do not use a tube-type oil
cooler.</em></b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">When installing an external oil cooler use AN8
(1/2") aircraft type fittings and high pressure oil hose with an
internal diameter of 1/2". Racers and those serious about
durability use Aeroquip fittings and hose, or their non-aircraft
certified counterpart.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">When mounted away from the air inlet, an
auxiliary fan is required. The fan is normally wired in series with
a thermostatically controlled switch.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Final Conclusions</b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">When you install an external oil cooler you are
doing something VW should have done in the first place, and which
they got around to in 1971. This 'Better Late Than Never' brand of
retro-fit engineering also applies to oil filters and hydraulic cam
followers, which VW incorporated in its late Type IV
engines.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The smartest move you can make when installing
an external oil cooler is to install it in conjunction with a
full-flow oil filtration system, in which case it is installed
downstream of the filter, usually on the other side of a
thermostatically controlled valve.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Depending on the plumbing runs, an external oil
cooler and filter will increase your oil capacity by about 1.3
quarts. Aside from doubling the life of your engine the most
significant change you'll see is a slightly longer warm-up time.
With a filter installed you can extend your oil change period to
3,000 miles (non-dusty conditions).</font></p>
