<h3>Increasing Split Stability and Handling</h3>
<p>by Jason McDaniel</p>
<hr size="2">
<blockquote><font size="+1"><i>...it sounds the camber compensator
is not all it is cracked up to be. A list member said a better
option would be the spring that bolts to the frame horns rather
than the tranny case. Is this the "z-bar"? I have a 1960 double cab
and want it as safe as possible.This includes adding steering
stablizers. I have not added anything to the front yet as I want to
make it compatible with what I do to the front. My impression so
far is the CC is not worth it, and this z-bar, which i don't know
what it is, would be the better choice. Do the list members
concur?</i></font></blockquote>
<font size="+1"><br></font>
<p><font size="+1">Richard, the *Z* bar was used by Volkswagen in
1967-68 beetles and Type IIIs.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Formula V racers have adapted adjustable
anti-roll bars into Z bars by turning one of the arms 180 degrees
(approx) from its original location, and then fabricating custom
mounts and links for it. Formula V racers have also tried all other
sorts of rear suspension tweeking, like the zero roll suspension,
that would not be suitable on a street car. Take a look at a manual
that describes 1967 beetles to see what the *Z* bar looks like, and
where it is mounted.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Without fabrication, the Camber Compensator is
really your only choice, and it is not a bad choice. I used the one
that mounts to the transaxle, and I drive my cars hard, long and
often. I have to do periodic maintaince MUCH earlier than my
friends because of it. The transaxle mounted CC does CONTRIBUTE to
my transaxle mounts going bad, but that is par for the course...you
take the good with the bad. Even after changing out the mounts, I
will keep the CC on the car. The solution to the mounts problem is
to find or fabricate a mount that attaches to the frame rather than
the transaxle, though this may only help a little, the axles and
therefore the mounts absorb a lot of the cornering force, and if
the CC allows you to corner faster (with more force) then every
other component will be stressed more.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">On my '57 Kombi, I am considering welding a
custom CC mount straight to the frame horns. That bus also has a
custom rear engine mount (wish I has thought about using the late
bus mount, would have saved some time, and looked more
stock)</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">If you really want to be SAFE and have a
comfortable drive in a well handling car or bus, then convert it to
a double-jointed rear axle. Buses have a few over the counter
options, using a bug IRS setup, a late bus IRS setup, or you could
fabricate something outrageous. I've seen photos (in Volks World)
from Holand of a guy's fastback with Porsche 911 rear suspension
(and engine and transaxle).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">As far as simple handling adjustments go, my
list would read like this, and I would implement them somewhat in
this order: (I am asuming you have a good alignment, the front end
is in A-1 condition, and that you adjust your linkpins and lube the
chassis every 3000 miles and have good rubber bump stops) See the
brake notes at the end.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Change the tires to 185SR15 Michelins (sp) XVX
or whatever the newest X series tire is. Make sure they have a
build date within the last year, as they have a limited shelf life
(7-10 years). I would change to the 15" rim, even if I had a
'63-'70 bus. Check the inflation, and keep it maintained. Using XVX
tires on my stock beetle (165SR15) I inflate to 23lbs in the front
and 28 or 29 lbs in the rear. I would start a bus at around 28lbs
in front and 30-32 lbs in back and work from there.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Add *flop stops* that do not allow the spring
plate to droop too far, and spring plate retainers that will not
allow the spring plate to jump off the lower stop and tuck under
the bus. Dune buggy suppliers have this stuff. You will bottom out
(top out?) on the flop stop if you drive on VERY bumpy roads at
speed.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Change the shock absorbers to Boge HD stock
units. They will NOT give you slot car like traction, but are
idealy suited to spirited driving in an otherwise stock bus, and
will not rattle your fillings out like KYB Gas-Adjust shocks. Make
sure you are getting the HD units. Others have their favorite brand
of shocks.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Add a front anti-roll bar. You can get them new
from Sway-A-Way or get one off a '66 or later bus. New mounts,
including clamps, can be purchased from West Coast Metric. Get new
mounts and clamps. The anti-roll bar increases roll stiffness,
without changing the original spring rate (more stiffness around a
corner, but stock stiffness going over a speed bump). If your bus
is lowered a lot using an Albatros lowering kit from Bus Boys
(turned springs) then the anti-roll bar may stick down too low and
snag on minor bumps or high crown roads.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Add a camber compensator. Just the plain jane
one that Sway-A-Way sells. Keep it lubed at the center link and the
axle straps.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">After the transaxle mounts fail, change them out
with Gene Berg Heavy Duty mounts.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Add a rear engine mount from a '68-'71 bus, or
fabricate it (the harder way) or adapt a traction bar (from Gene
Berg or others)</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Add a Gene Berg transaxle cener section mount.
He doesn't make one for buses, so you have to buy the parts
unwelded, and adapt them yourself.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">De-camber the rear axle, and add adjusters to
the front to adjust it (by changing the heigth of the front using
adjusters, you change the lever arm angle on the torsion bars) (by
changing the rake of the bus, you change the corner weights) (you
can do this, and keep the reduction boxes, and still have a *stock*
looking ride)</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Use HD donut bushings at the front of the spring
plates, on the rear torsion bars. (they squeek, and have to be
lubed constantly) (you will HATE the squeeking) Does anyone out
there have other solutions for torsion bushings BTW. Something
strong, quiet, and will still give a little. No bronze bushings
please! Has anyone ever installed zerk fittings to lube these
parts, one in the cover and one in the housing?</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Change out the torsion bars (front or rear) to
others more suited to your purpose. Ambulance bars are softer, and
firetruck bars are stiffer. Earlier buses can easily use later,
stiffer torsion bars.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Change to double-jointed rear suspension
(IRS).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Add wider and/or lighter custom wheels, with
lower profile tires. Porsche 4.5 wheels are a little lighter, and
better vented, and more offset, Porsche 5.5 wheels are all that and
wider. Sprint Stars are stiffer, wider and have more offset, but
are just as heavy (or heavier). Rader, American Racing, Flat Four
and MSW have made 5on205 pattern wheels that fit early
buses.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Buy a Porsche ;-) and put the VW logo on the
front.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Make sure the brakes are in top notch shape, or
upgraded and in top notch shape. The easiest upgrade you can make
is just adding stainless or kevlar brake lines to increase braking
power, but you have to inspect them more often, and change the line
whenever you change the cylinder, as a rule. Early buses can change
out to the later brakes (and fit custom wheels easier) without
changing out the beam by using '63 only kingpin carriers and
spindles. They have the small linkpins to fit early torsion arms,
and later spindles to fit later brakes. There are LOTS of other
brake upgrades available, search the archives.<br></font></p>
