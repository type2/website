<h3>Torsion Bar Adjustment</h3>
<p>by Pat Walsh</p>
<hr size="2">
<p><font size="+1">A couple of weeks ago I set out to adjust the
torsion bars in my '71 Westy to raise the sagging back end a bit.
I'm not going to go over the step-by-step details as they are
covered in Bentley and Haynes, as well as an article in HVW a few
years back. But there were a few things I thought could use some
clearing up. First, the books talk about measuring the angle of the
body of the bus (underneath, between the front and rear wheels,
along the outer edge) and the angle of the spring plate, then
adding or subtracting depending on whether the rear of the bus is
higher or lower than the front. This gives you the "spring plate
angle". Maybe this is pretty obvious, but they're talking about the
angle of the body WHILE YOU'RE DOING THE PROCEDURE, not the normal
angle. At first I was thinking of measuring the angle of the bus'
body as it sat on it's wheels in the garage and somehow determining
how much (in degrees) the spring plate angle needed to change to
level the bus. That's not what it's about, though. The angle on the
spec. page of the manual is what the angle is "supposed" to be
between the spring plate and the body of the bus. In order to
determine what YOUR spring plate angle is, you measure the angle of
spring plate to the true horizontal and then measure the angle of
the bus' body to the true horizontal and add or subtract the values
depending on which end of the bus is higher RIGHT THEN. So it
doesn't matter if your floor isn't perfectly level, if you've got
the back end up on jack stands, etc. In fact, when I was taking the
measurements, the rear was actually a little higher than the front
because of the jack stands.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The second thing is that in order to adjust the
spring plates you don't have to remove the brake drum, disconnect
the brake line, remove the CV joints and drive shaft or take off
the shocks. (This is on my '71. I would expect it to apply to all
'68-'79 but of course I can't swear to it.) You need to unhook the
FRONT end of the parking brake cable, either inside the cab
('68-'71) or underneath ('72-'79), then pull the flexible sheath
(that goes into the back of the brake drum) away from the rigid
metal tube that goes toward the front of the bus. You just need
about six inches of slack. Don't try to pull the whole cable
through, of course. You'll also need to remove the clip holding the
brake line to the front of the diagonal arm and pull the brake line
out of the grommet at the rear of the diagonal arm. Support the
bearing housing with a floor jack as you remove the four big bolts
holding it to the spring plate and diagonal arm (after marking the
position as described in the books) and once it is free you should
have just enough slack to move it back to clear the spring plate
without straining the brake line, etc. I sat mine on a cement block
while I did the adjustment.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Next, chances are you're going to find that your
current spring plate angle is about what the book says it's
supposed to be. That was the case with mine, and the one they did
in HVW. Yet the back end of the bus still sags, because even though
the unloaded angle is to spec., the bars are old and have a bit
more give to them. Also, you're not going to be able to measure
down to minutes (1/60th of a degree) like they talk about in the
books, either. I was lucky to get within .5 to 1 degree with my
Craftsman angle measure-er (or whatever it's called :-) ). My
plates started out at about 22-23 degrees, and I rotated them 7
teeth which comes out to 4.67 degrees for my configuration, for a
final spring plate angle of about 27 degrees. Different years had
different numbers of teeth so therefore 7 teeth = 4.67 degrees
won't always be the case. Check your book to make sure. And by
"rotating 7 teeth", I mean I turned the torsion bar down 7 teeth on
the inside, and the spring plate up 7 teeth on the outside. ("Up"
and "down" instead of CW or CCW because it varies depending on what
side of the bus you are working on.) Before you pull the spring
plate off the torsion bar, put a drop of paint on the end of the
bar and on the spring plate. Once you remove the spring plate,
paint a mark on the bar and the housing. Don't scratch the paint on
the bar as it causes rust. Pull the bar out a bit and rotate it
down the number of clicks you've decided on. Then put the spring
plate back on, so that its dot of paint is rotated up this same
number of teeth from the dot of paint on the end of the bar. Now
measure the angle of the plate. It should be 4.67 degrees (or
however much you decided to adjust) more than when you started. You
should be able to easily tell if the outer end is set up right,
based on the paint drops. And if you are off by a tooth on the
inner end, it will be obvious when you measure (like 8 degrees or
so). If it isn't right, use your paint marks and start over. I
think this measuring business is what everyone's concerned about,
but honestly it isn't that big a deal. Just take your time and
think about what you are doing and start over if you have to and it
will go fine. I had more trouble getting the lug nuts off and the
bolts out that hold the bearing housing on.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Now you need to raise the spring plate back up a
bit so it rests on its lug (support). The books seem to imply that
this is going to take some monster amount of force, you might have
to have people sit in the bus to keep it from lifting off the jack
stands, the spring plate is going to be poised to lop off your hand
like a meat cleaver, etc. That just wasn't the case, at least with
the increase in angle I was using, and the age of the torsion bars.
I just put the floor jack under the end of the spring plate and
raised it up enough to clear the lug. Then I used a large socket on
an extension, up against the spring plate, and drove the spring
plate the rest of the way on the torsion bar. For safety I then
used a pair of vice-grips to clamp the spring plate on its lug
until everything is bolted up. I used lock-tite (per Bob's
recommendation) on the screws holding the cover on, and anti-sieze
on the big bolts I had such a hard time removing. Line up the marks
you made earlier on the diagonal arm, spring plate and bearing
housing and torque everything down. Secure the brake lines to the
diagonal arm, put the parking brake housing back in place and
connect up and adjust the parking brake and put the wheels back on
and you're done.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The bus isn't my daily driver, so I don't have
that many miles on it yet since the adjustment, but so far so good.
It looks a lot better and I can see out the back window better. I
should have taken more precise measurements before I started, but I
wasn't sure where to measure. The rear bumper is a bit crooked to
begin with on mine, and the front and rear wheelwells don't look
like they were SUPPOSED to be the same height, so it's hard to know
when you've got it 100% correct. Using a level on the wood floor
inside also gave slightly different readings depending on where you
set it. But the bus just "looks" better. For one thing, the fender
skirt just covers the very top of the sidewall, whereas before it
covered over half of it. I'm happy with the results and would
recommend the procedure to others contemplating it. If I were doing
it over again I might have gone an extra tooth or two, but no more.
As it is, it's about 5 degrees over spec. and if you have TOO big
an angle, you're putting more of a stress on the bars and they
could snap. I'll probably have the bus aligned before too long,
too.</font></p>
