<title>Steering Box and Horn Wire Replacement ('68-'71 Type
2)</title>
</head>
<body>
<h3>Steering Box and Horn Wire Replacement ('68-'71 Type 2)</h3>
<p>by Craig K</p>
<hr size="2">
<p><font size="+1">Replaced the steering box in my 70 bus recently.
While there, figured I'd</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">A) Replace the big rubber square (steering
coupler: part # 211 415 417) that connects the box to the steering
column and</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">B) redo the horn wire, which has been a
button-on-the-dash hack for some time now...</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">If I did it, you can.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">You will need at least:</font></p>
<ul>
<li><font size="+1">13mm sockets</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">TWO 13 mm crescent wrenches</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Phillips and standard screwdrivers</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">BIG needle-nose pliers</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Pitman-arm puller (use it on the arm that
connects your steering box to the drag link). Rent one if you don't
have one!</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Socket for bolts that hold steering box to
frame (forgot the size :P)</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">New cotter pins (big and small)</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Pillow or log or old steering box</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Two batches of your very best curse
words</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font size="+1">Read the procedures and look at the pictures of
whatever manual you have. GET ONE if you don't!</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>TWO THINGS TO REMEMBER - VERY
IMPORTANT!</b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>One:</b> replace that rubber coupler when you
do any work to the steering gear that looks likely to give you the
chance. They don't break very often, but break they do, and bye-bye
steering. Especially if you are replacing the steering box, there
is no reason NOT to spend the $10 or so bucks here... plus, you
will likely never have to do this again for as long as you own the
bus.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Two:</b> in a 68-71 bus, the electrical
circuit for the horn is as follows: the hot wire (yellow and black)
comes from the brake switch line or somewhere straight from the
fuse block (depending on year), goes to one terminal on the horn -
have been told that some horns prefer one terminal over the other
to be hot - and the wire on the other terminal (brown) connects to
a spade lug on the underside of the steering column, under the bus.
You can just see it, above the steering box, in the front (Front Is
Front). There also is a rubber seal in this area that insulates the
column from the rest of the car. Don't worry about it now; the gist
of this is that the column is now "seeking" ground, but is
isolated.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The horn button is the key - underneath the
button is a ring of tin or something; below is another ring, this
one of copper. When you push the horn button, you are pressing
these two together momentarily and BEEEEP because attached to that
FIRST ring is a wire, the notorious 'horn won't shut off' wire.
This travels down the center of the hollow steering column (itself
travelling down the center of the hollow steering tube) and
connects to the bolts that hold that little rubber coupling twixt
box and column. Convoluted, no? It gets worse.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">PAY ATTENTION AND SAVE YERSELF TWO DAYS OF LYING
UNDER YOUR BUS REDOING STUFF! AMHIK!</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">That wire from the horn button, which travels
down the steering column, MUST go THROUGH the hole in the center of
the rubber coupling disk, and be attached to the bolts on the
STEERING BOX side of the coupling - this bushing is basically what
isolates the steering schmeck from the rest of the car; when you
push the horn button, you are completing the ground circuit thru
the bolt and then thru the steering box to the frame. If you
connect that wire to the steering COLUMN side, it ain't gonna work.
Bentley does not tell you this. Muir does not tell you this.
Archives didn't mention it. Bob Hoover didn't know. Clymer,
Chilton, nope. Which is silly, coz its the most import thing
here.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">When your horn won't shut off, its because that
wire is grounding to the column somewhere. Which is analogous to
connecting the wire to the wrong side of that bushing!</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">So. First, disconnect the battery, and then
straighten the wheels out on the bus. Don't jack it up, as you will
want to keep those wheels right where they are. Under the bus,
remove the splash pan. Use the pillow, log or steering box to prop
up your head... much more comfy that way. Make a reference mark on
everything in sight - this will help you determine reattachments
for a centered steering wheel, wheels and steering box! Next, take
the standard screwdriver and unbend the cotter ends on each bolt
you see; use the pliers to pull out the pins. Undo the big nut that
holds the steering arm on.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Put the key in - BATTERY DISCONNECTED - and
rotate it to undo the steering lock. You might break the lock
otherwise. Use the Pitman puller to pull the arm off of the
steering box - DO NOT HIT IT! You will damage the internal gearing
(Hit it if you are replacing it, and you feel better for the
hitting :)). You don't need to remove the drag link, just push it
aside. Up in the cab, undo the turn signal assembly; push it
aside.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Back under, loosen the bolts from steering box
to frame. Undo the bolts that hold the steering box to the rubber
coupling. You should see the old horn wire - remember where it
goes! Finish removing the box. You should see a flange with a bolt
(with a lockplate on it). If you are replacing the steering box,
remove it and put it on the new one - tight . If not, leave it
alone. Remove the bolts that hold the old coupling to the steering
column. You can pull or move the column around to get better
leverage. Replace the coupling, and reinstall the bolts. Go back
topside, and center your steering wheel. Hopefully, this will line
up w/ your marks. If not, REmark to center.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Whether it is old or new, try and determine the
center point of the steering box's travel - mark it! Loosely
reinstall the steering box to the frame; then drop the horn wire
thru the hole in the coupling, and reattach it using the nut and
bolt. Put this wire on the UNDERSIDE - steering box side - of the
coupling.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Tighten everything up - you will use up the
first set of cursewords doing all this while trying to keep things
aligned properly!! With luck, your steering wheel should be
centered and the wheels still straight. Jack up the bus at the
center of the beam, just enough to test the steering from
side-to-side; make sure that all is correct HERE, not on the road!!
If things aren't right, this is the place to use the second set of
cursewords. If ollakalla, reattach the Pitman arm; tighten the big
nut to 58-80 lbs/ft - VERY IMPORTANT!!!</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Now put in new cotter pins and rejoice in tight
steering and/or loud horniness!</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><i>[Craig made a couple of posts to the lists
about a new problem - his Bus would become horny at random times.
The following is his post of 22 Jan 2001 where he described the
diagnosis and solution. -- Editor]</i></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">A loooooooooong day resulted in my finally
fixing my too-noisy horn; as some may recall, it had begun to beep
when the steering wheel was turned, and I had ALREADY done the
replace-the-wire-and-even-put-straws-on-it thing.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">As crazy as it sounds, I was right: it was the
ignition switch; specifically, the ignition lock.<br>
There is - or was - a plastic bushing that fits betwen the steering
shaft and the column that the steering shaft resides in, and that
has a little hole where the column lock protrudes; this had gone
The Way Of All Things. The column lock (a small metal bar) was
making a ground between the shaft, the column and the housing for
the ignition switch when the wheel was turned, as the lack of this
bushing (and resulting wear on the others) allowed the whole
assembly to flex. Figure 9-12 of the Front End section in my
Bentley shows the various bushings; the ignition stuff isn't in the
Bentley, I found pictures in a reprint of a VW parts manual, and in
the <a href="../electrip/igbay.htm">T2 library</a>.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I took the entire ignition assembly out ( a
pain) and removed the column lock by grinding it off. This was a
little odd, as I prefer to keep things stock, but I never liked
that little thing anyways. Locked the wheel up on me once when I
went to restart the motor while driving :P Next, I took a sheet of
THICK rubber and cut a 2" tall section of it to fit the column;
this was glued to the column, and the ignition housing, bearing,
bushings, turnswitch housing etcetc were put back on. Even got to
take that little bit of misalignment outta the steering wheel's
positioning :)</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">No horn beeps except when I want them, turn
signals cancel properly... nothing caught fire when I hooked the
battery back up =)</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I found that a key factor was having the
steering housing screwed TIGHTLY to the support that resides
beneath it; the slightest looseness will cause the column to flex,
the bushings to wear, and the horn to beep.<br></font></p>
