<h3>Subaru Engine in a Bus</h3>
<p>by Mark Chambers</p>
<hr size="2"/>
<p><font size="+1">Disclaimer: Dimensions for bell housing assembly
are from a 1600cc Subaru retrofit. I haven't measured yet to see if
the distance from the rear of the crank to the rear of the block
are the same on the 1800cc. The 2 features which have to match the
VW are:</font></p>
<ol>
<li><font size="+1">Distance from transaxle locating face of bell
housing to clutch disk surface of flywheel. This can be easily
measured on a VW engine with flywheel installed.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Concentricity of locating flange (ring) to
crankshaft centerline.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font size="+1">(If you make it thru this part, the rest of the
project is cake)</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><u><b>Part 1: Fabrication and Machining of Bell
Housing</b></u></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Needed:</font></p>
<ol>
<li><font size="+1">Bell housing off of your Subaru
engine.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">1/2" aluminum plate as big as a VW bell
housing.....$25</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Aluminum welding rod....$10 - $20.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">A good (aluminum) welder. $Beer (if you bring
the rod)</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Machinist with CNC mill or manual mill w/rotary
table.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">A VW engine &amp; transaxle just laying around to
fit and measure stuff.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font size="+1">Study the VW 'flange-type' bell housing. Study
the Subaru 'bell-type' bell housing. Look at your aluminum plate.
Your new bell housing will only be 1-1/4" thick. Visualize what you
are going to make. Do this for a long time.....</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>A. Cutting down the Subaru Bell
Housing</b><br/>
(Machining: This is the toughest part)</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Detach bell housing from engine. Set aside the
steel reinforcement brackets that go from the top of the engine to
the bell housing.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Clamp down to mill table with the Subaru side
down. Mill until it is .970" thick. I suggest milling from inside
out with a 'Hog' style end mill.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>B. Layout and Cut Aluminum
Plate</b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Using a transaxle for a template, layout with a
marker the general shape of the VW bell housing on 'cereal box'
grade cardboard. Leaving the shape round where the 'flats' are
won't hurt. I did this for extra strength. Leave material on bottom
edge to later match up to the oil pan 'mating surface'. Leave
plenty of material around the VW attach hole locations. Mark the
hole locations with a marker, then center punch them for
reference.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Transfer your cardboard template to the aluminum
plate. Saw or torch the plate outside and in. Make sure the inside
slightly overlaps inside the bell housing. Drop a flywheel into
your assembly and check for clearance with the flywheel centered.
Once every thing is lined up, drill and tap a couple of holes at
3:00 and 6:00 for some 10-32 screws to hold plate to bell housing
until welding. Consult your welder and he will tell you how much to
grind weld chamfers all around. Big chamfer at bottom between
Subaru &amp; VW halves of oil pan mating surface. Clean and chamfer
elsewhere, per welders instructions.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>C. Welding the Assembly</b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Weld everywhere possible. There is nowhere that
too much weld will affect. (This part can't be seen easily when in
the vehicle, so don't worry about massive piles of weld). Get
maximum penetration across bottom at oil pan mating surface to
allow for re-machining this surface. Build up areas around lower
hole locations (center punches) as much as possible (full thicknes
of assembly). Build up top hole areas to a little more than stock
VW thickness. (There went $20 bucks worth of rod)</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>D. Machining the assembly</b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The next stap CAN NOT BE OMMITTED because your
assembly IS WARPED from welding.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Clamp the assembly to the mill table, Subaru
side down. Clamp lightly keeping assembly in a 'free state' (do not
distort). Mill the 'plate' side just enough so that most of it
cleans up. Now flip over and clamp with plate side down (on fresh
machined surface). Mill the Subaru mating surface just enough for
100% cleanup. Surfaces are now parallel again.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Clamp (with Subaru side down) onto a CNC or
rotary table. Indicate in center bore. Indicate across oil pan
mating surface to line it up. Machine the VW flange (ring) to the
same O.D. &amp; I.D. as a VW engine. (Sorry I don't have the diameters
handy). Thickness of assembly (not including ring should finish at
1.220". Mill lower edge of assembly to match up with oil pan mating
surface.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Hand grind around top bolt holes for mating to
steel brackets.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>E. Fitting Assembly</b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Fit assembly to transaxle. Level it and drill
some pilot holes at 4 locations. Drill and tap the lower holes for
12mm studs. Drill the top holes to clear 12mm bolts. Attach
assembly to engine using 2 drill shanks where dowel pins go. Bolt
up. Remove drill shanks and tap holes for 3/8-16 bolts (they are
already the right diameter for threading. Now drill thru bell
housing only, to clear for 3/8 bolts. Remove assembly for final
cleaning. Re-attach with added bolts. Install a new seal
immediatly.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Find the steel reinforcement brackets. Heat them
up and bend them around to fit new VW hole locations. Weld a 12mm
nut to the starter side brackets. Screw in a 12mm stud to right
length (see VW engine). Lock with another nut against welded nut.
Note: This must be done because you can't access this area later to
use a bolt. The other side can use the std. VW bolt. Screw some
more studs into lower holes using loctite. Note: 12mm hi-grade
all-thread can be purchased at a Bolt &amp; Nut supply
store.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">If this sounds like a lot of work, it is. If you
have to pay a machine shop to do the machining, you are probably
better off buying the Kennedy Adapter kit. I'm not trying to
discourage anyone but it was easier for me because I have a CNC
mill and a friend who welds. If you can find a Kennedy bell housing
on a boneyard engine, you can skip this whole step,
also.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Any dimensions that I left or you are not sure
how to get, please request and I will dig out my notes or head for
the garage and measure again.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Next step:....(way easier from
here!!).....Modify flywheel. Fabricate pilot bushing
retainer.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Disclaimer: I am going to leave out a few actual
dimensions on this one...mainly because it's hard to verbally
describe a blueprint. Also because I haven't yet checked to see if
the 1800 crank bolt pattern is the same as my 1600. (Been too busy
trying to figure out the new turbo and fuel injection) All the
dimensions for this part are easy to obtain by measuring the your
Subaru crank. If anyone needs actual real numbers, I'll get them
(I've got to do it eventually). This text is more of a 'procedure'
for accomplishing the retrofit.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Once again, the #1 feature that you are dealing
with is:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Distance from transaxle locating face of bell
housing to clutch disk surface of flywheel. This can be easily
measured on a VW engine with flywheel installed.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">O.K....you've had all kinds of time to complete
the 1st part. You've probably already polished your new bell
housing adapter and sent it out to be rainbow anodized. The rest of
the adapter isn't as labor or money intensive as the last, howver,
a little more machining is involved, so I hope your machinist is
not too pissed off after the 'bell housing project'.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><u><b>Part 2: Modification of Flywheel &amp;
Fabrication of Pilot Bushing Retainer</b></u></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Needed:</font></p>
<ol>
<li><font size="+1">Flywheel *</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Mild steel plate long enough to span 2 Subaru
flywheel bolts opposite each other, at least as thick as your VW
flywheel center hub***</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Machinist to bore the center of your VW
flywheel.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Oilite bronze bushing 3/4 O.D. X 1/2 I.D. X
about 3/4 long***</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font size="+1">* I used a 200mm 6 volt flywheel. I like the 6
volt starters. Between my 63 &amp; 64 I've gone through 3 starters in
20 years running on 12 volt systems.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">*** There may be a simple way around the entire
bushing retainer on the 1800cc. The bearing retainer described is
needed for the 1600cc.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The VW flywheel locates with 4 dowel pins. It
fastens with a 'gland nut'. The Subaru flywheel locates with a
'bore' over a hub on the crank. It fastens with 8 bolts.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">You are going to modify the VW flywheel so that
it locates over the hub on the crank, and fastens with 8
bolts.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">With the VW flywheel on a VW engine, note where
the pilot shaft bearing (in the Gland Nut) is in relation to the
flywheel clutch surface (your main reference for all of this part).
With your new setup you have no Gland nut, no needle bearing. You
have to have a bearing or bushing at this 'location'.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">You are going to fabricate/machine a 'retainer'
to hold a bushing at the position of the current needle
bearing.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>A. Modifying the Flywheel...the Machining
Part</b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Notice that the Subaru flywheel has a 'flat'
face that attaches to the crank. The VW flywheel has a 'flange' for
sealing around the outside of the crank, using an o'ring or gasket.
This 'flange' has to go away.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Clamp the flywheel to the mill table, resting on
some 1-2-3 blocks under the clutch disk surface. The crank side is
up. Mill the flange flush with the center surface of the flywheel.
Install for dowels into flywheel. Using a dial indicator 'sweep' in
the four pins to find 'center' of the flywheel. If they are sloppy,
sweep in the center hole of the flywheel. Bore open the hole (not
very much) to slip over the hub on the Subaru crank.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The next step should prefferably be done on a
milling machine, but can be done manually.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Flip the flywheel over. If still on the mill,
indicate in the center bore. Measure the bolt pattern on a Subaru
flywheel or the Subaru crank for the 8 bolts. Notice that 2 holes
are spaced further apart than the rest. If on the mill, calculate
the bolt pattern and drill. Counter bore the holes (big enough for
the washers on the Subaru crank bolts) flush with the center
surface of the flywheel.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">If doing the hole pattern by hand, center the
Subaru flywheel over the VW flywheel. You might want make a simple
alignment tool thru the center bores. Transfer punch, drill, and
counterbore the holes using the Subaru flywheel as a
template.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>B. Fabrication of Pilot Bushing
Retainer...1600cc. (***may be a simpler way 1800cc)</b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Without showing you a blueprint, all I can do is
describe what you need to make. Look at the output shaft on your
transaxle. Notice that after the 'bullet' end of the shaft, there
is the part of the shaft that runs in the VW gland nut needle
bearing. There is more available shaft before you get to the
splines. The retainer that you need to fabricate attaches to at
least 2 flywheel bolts. It uses the space from within your flywheel
almost out to the clutch disk. (Lay the clutch disk in place and
see how much space you have). The retainer is bored out for a std.
3/4 bushing. The bushing needs to be bored for a slip fit for the
output shaft. The bushing will ride on the shaft back closer to the
splines than the original gland nut bearing.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">On the 1600 engine, the needle bearing in the
end of the crank must be removed. If you can't get it out, use a
5/8 drill, (that you dont mind chewing up a little) to remove
it.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The 1800 crank has clearance for the nose of the
shaft.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>***simpler way...maybe:</b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The Subaru 1800 flywheel has a 'bearing pressed
into it. There probably is a standard metric bearing which has the
correct I.D. for the VW output shaft.bearing. I don't think the VW
flywheel has enough meat for locating on the crank and retaining a
bearing but I will reseach this A.S.A.P.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Install the modified VW flywheel onto the Subaru
engine with your rainbow anodized bell housing in place. Measure
from the transaxle locating surface to the clutch disk surface and
make sure it matches the VW engine you have setting around. If it
does, then your ready to bolt up and see if it cranks
over.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Next step:....(no more machining!!).....Cooling
system side-hinged decklid. fabrication:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><u><b>Part 3: Cooling system and side hinged
decklid fabrication.</b></u></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Needed:</font></p>
<ol>
<li><font size="+1">***Radiator out of Subaru, or a taller, wider,
but not thicker one. $50-75 w/fans</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">(3) VW bus decklid hinges in good
condition.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Welder</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">(2) 21" full flex radiator hoses, 1-1/4
dia.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">3/4" long cabinet lock or equivalent latch
assembly. The locks are nice because they serve as a decklid latch
and if you get (2), you can throw a matched one on your gas
door.</font>
<p><font size="+1">From the steel supply store:</font></p>
</li>
<li><font size="+1">1" Sq. box tubing with 1/16 wall, about 12
feet. $8</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">A strip of 1/8 x 1-1/2 flat steel bar $8. This
will be to make all the bracketry such as latch mount striker
plate, and radiator attach brackets.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">(4)16 gage sheet metal strips. They will sheer
them for you. (2) pieces @ 40" long x 1-1/2" wide, (2) pieces 23"
long x 1-1/2" wide. $10</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Enough body sheet metal to cover the entire
area of decklid and rear apron.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">About 6 feet of 1-1/4 round steel tubing with
1/16 wall.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">(3) pieces of 1/4 or 3/8 steel, 2" long x 3/4
wide. (hinge mounts)big enough to make lugs</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">A strip of 3/5 x 1/8 flat steel bar about 11
inches long. You may as well get a long piece...the price for a 12
foot piece at the steel supply will be the same as a 2" piece at
the hardware store. $6</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font size="+1">Note: This phase requires a lot of fabrication
and welding. It will also take a while. (It took me about 10 hours
over 2 weeks time)</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">*** My 64 Double has a '82 Subaru radiator.
There is room to go 4" taller and 3" wider. This doesn't sound like
much but that is a lot more cooling capacity. The stock radiator is
cooling the stock 1600 cc engine fine but I will be upgrading when
I add the 1800cc Turbo. If you don't have a radiator, build the
decklid frame first, then find the biggest radiator that will fit
on the frame.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Study the existing VW bus decklid. Notice how
the hinges mount to a flat surface on the bus, and to an angled'
surface on the deck lid. You are going to mount (3) of these on the
right side of the door opening. (The only 'cutting ' of your
vehicle will be the 6 attach holes that you drill for the hinges.)
Remove the rear apron. Notice how the opening is straight until it
gets to the bottom, then it curves in toward the front. Your new
decklid will be made to follow this contour. It will fit the entire
area of existing decklid and rear apron. The assembly you will make
is as follows:</font></p>
<ol>
<li><font size="+1">A box tubing 'frame' that fits inside the
opening and has hinges on the right and latch and bullet pin on the
left for locking and support. The radiator is also attached to the
'engine compartment' side of the frame.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">A skin on the outside with matches/lines up
with the back of your bus. It will be flush all around for a nice
look. It also has a large cutout to exhaust air from the cooling
fans out to the rear of the vehicle. The cooling fans are on the
rear of the radiator and don't stick out past the skin.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font size="+1">Measure the door opening and sketch the inside
opening and the outside opening. now draw in a rectangular frame
inside the opening. 3/8 away from right side of door opening, 1/4
away from top' and 3/4 away from left. For my '64 this framework
(1" box tubing) ended up at 35-1/4 wide and 20-3/4 tall. Now with
the frame sketched in, shorten the bottom cross piece by 3" on each
end. Draw in an angled pieces that joins the sides at 8" up from
bottom. This cleared area will allow you to shape the bottom
corners of the decklid to match the bus curve at the bottom. Add a
4" long gusset across each top corner for strength and to kit
assembly square. Cut all your pieces, and chamfer them for welding.
I would recommend tacking the whole thing together and checking the
fit (right, left, top clearances listed above). Weld it all over
and straighten.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Look at the right end of frame and right side of
door opening. The hinge locations down from the top of the frame
will be 2-1/2", 7", and 11-1/2" to the center of each hinge. Cut
the right side box tubing at these locations so that you can weld
in the (3/4 x 2") steel lugs at an angle. (Look at the mounting
angle on your old decklid). Weld them in a grind any weld off the
faces. Clamp all 3 hinges onto a straight edge for alignment and
layout screw hole locations in the lugs. Pay attention to which way
the hinges go...they can be put on backwards and won't work. If you
have metric taps, drill &amp; tap mounting holes for existing screws.
If not use 1/4-20 flat head screws. Attach the top 2
hinges.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Modify the lower hinge. Weld another 3/8 on so
that it will reach. Fill the holes with weld and grind and re-drill
holes at the same distance from edge as other hinges. Re-attach to
frame.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Cut a piece of the 3/4 x 1/8 flat bar to 11"
long. Center along all 3 (attached) hinges and transfer the hole
locations to the center of the bar. Center the holes more or less
along center of strip as best you can. Drill and tap for 1/4-20.
This is a long nut plate which will go between the right taillight
housing and the right door frame.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Now fit the frame with hinges to the vehicle.
Don't worry to much about top and left spacing. You need to mount
the frame so that it is 1/16 below flush with all bus body metal.
Have someone hold it while you mark the hole locations. Drill thru
the bus right door frame for 1/4 bolt clearance. Use a 5/16 drill.
Hold the 11" nut plate behind the frame and see if the holes line
up. If they do mount the decklid with 1-1/2 long 1/4-20 flat head
screws.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Find a 3/8 or 7/16 bolt that you can cut up
(about and inch long). Grind a rounded bullet type end on one end.
On the other end grind a large flat along about half the part and
thru about 1/3 of the diameter. Fit this pin against the left side
frame about halfway down. This will be a 'support pin' to hold half
the weight of the decklid. Don't weld it on yet.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Make a 'striker plate' about 1-1/2 x 1-1/2 x
3/16 and fasten it behind the bus left side door seating surface.
(The surface the door will close against) Use flathead 1/4-20
screws from the front.(They will be covered with rubber trim).
Swing the decklid closed holding the bullet pin in place, center
the pin to the plate and weld it on. Grind away any weld on the
bullet side. Mark a hole location for the bullet pin to go thru the
striker plate, and drill. Make sure the frame is level, even if you
have to pick it up a little bit. This pin sets your alignment for
the whole thing. For you latch, weld a 2" x 2" plate flush with the
outer (skin side) of the frame. Locate it so that it 'latches' on
the striker plate.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Radiator mounting:</b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">On the top and bottom frame of your radiator
should be plenty of holes. Some of them will be threaded. I built
(4) brackets, 2 top, 2 bottom, and attached them to the radiator.
Then I welded 4 'standoffs' (1" box tubing...about 4" long) to the
top and bottom rail of decklid frame. I then pinned the brackets
and radiator to the frame with clevis pins for quick
removal/service.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Note: Make sure the fans do not stick out past
rear of frame.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Upper hose runs to the right thru 1-1/4 steel
tubing, then a full-flex hose into engine compartment. (I'll
discuss more of plumbing on the engine side later). Lower hose runs
to a brace (to protect from wear &amp; tear on soldered hose fitting at
bottom of radiator. Then a 18" full flex hose to the water pump.
The upper hose floats into the battery compartment against the
battery when door is closed. Lower hose feeds itself forward next
to the valve covers.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Adding the body metal:</b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Close the door and latch. Take the 1-1/2 wide 18
gage strips and frame the door leaving about 1/8 inch all around.
Tack weld into place. Where the sides come down bend strips to
follow body contour all the way to the bottom. Add a piece across
the bottom and bend in to meet sides. Some custom snipping will be
in order here. Once everything fits smoothly add welds every couple
of inches. Grind flush on the outside.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Cut the body sheetmetal 'skin' to 1/2" bigger
than your frame all around. Layout the large hole(s) for the fans
to exhaust thru. Fit the skin and fold over all edges carefully and
crease. Mine needed no welding.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Add some wire mesh or whatever suits you to
finish the look of the decklid. One note: I tried 1/4" raised
expanded metal first, but it created a lot of interference for the
fans. I switched to some 1/4" square wire mesh. I sprayed my fans
and that side of the radiator flat black to help hide
hardware.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">License plate was relocated with a simple metal
bracket coming off the right taillight bottom screw.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Next step:....All the Mickey mouse stuff that
goes with the retrofit. Plumbing, electrical, ignition, exhaust,
gages, etc....</font></p>
