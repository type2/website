<h3>Hydraulic Lifters and Type IV Pushrod Tube Seals</h3>
<p>by John Anderson</p>
<hr size="2">
<p><font size="+1">Hydraulic Lifters can be Adjusted
Warm!</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Despite popular belief, it <b>is not</b>
necessary to adjust <b>hydraulic</b> lifters stone cold. In fact,
there are times and means where you purposely strive for this not
to be the case. When you adjust a hydraulic lifter, you are
adjusting it to contact plus somewhere between 1 and 2 turns of the
rocker arm adjuster screw. That screw is a special fine pitch 10mm,
but still is good for 1mm per turn (.040"). Taking an average of
the information available, you will be adjusting to .060" past
contact.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Consider why on a solid lifter car you must
adjust the lifters stone cold. It is so you aren't adjusting them
when valves are warm and "stretched." Though I'm also a mechanical
engineer, I'm not going to bore you with numbers. But think for a
second about what you know. We adjust those solids to .006" gap,
which implies that an exhaust valve will NEVER stretch more than
.006" in use. Otherwise, we would be holding it open all the time
(even when on the backside of the cam lobe, and that is very
conservative). These valves aren't going to probably stretch more
than a few thousandths of an inch.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">So we know a valve isn't going to stretch more
than .006" and that VW over the years has proffered an adjustment
range from .040" to .080" past contact on the hydraulic lifters.
That valve can be as hot as it can get and you still have a 3 to 4
time slush factor either way of a "perfect" adjustment. So you see,
hydraulics don't have to be cold for an adjustment. The only thing
to watch out for with the warm engine/one that has just been run is
to avoid burning yourself (!).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Identifying Hydraulic Lifters</b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">You just bought a beautiful lime green and rust
'78 Westy and when you start her in the mornings you get something
between a tapping to pounding sound from the old engine that
changes with engine speed. You remember what the old bug (or '71
and earlier bus) sounded like with loose valves? This sounds the
same but even louder (even up to a hard pounding beat). You think
you got them hydraulic lifters...</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">A can tell if you have hydraulic lifters in a
couple ways. First, pull either valve cover. Take a "mini Mag"
flashlight and look up a pushrod tube around the rocker arm. If
that little pushrod is only about the size of a big round (3/8")
pencil all the way end to end and looks steel (probably brown and
oily), chances are there are still hydraulic lifters in there. If
instead, right behind the tip, behind the rocker arm, the pushrod
steps out to a big, ugly aluminum rod (probably closer to 1/2"
diameter and probably more silver in color) chances are you have
solid lifters in the block. If they are all currently adjusted to
somewhere in the .004-.008" range you can guess pretty much for
sure.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">By the book, only GD, GE, or CV blocks came from
VW with hydraulics (but only '78 and '79 GD blocks). All Vanagon CV
blocks came with hydraulics. Be aware that hydraulics could have
found their way into any T4 block over the years--hopefully along
with an hydraulic cam and the steel pushrods. If you see steel
pushrods and if when you rotate each cylinder to TDC and try to get
a feeler between the valve tip and rocker screw there <b>isn't</b>
a gap, you indeed have hydraulics. This is a good thing--but why
that infernal pounding?!</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Air in the Lifters</b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The hydraulic lifter lets the valve ride on a
cushion of oil, always maintaining perfect preload and contact on
the cam but not so much (oil pressure balances the spring pressure)
that it holds the valve open. Assume your '78 shows an actual 120k
or so on the original engine (though they can get noisy much
earlier if not driven, not maintained, etc). As these accumulate
time, the lifter parts lose their tolerances. Overnight, or after
setting, the oil inside them leaks out, air leaks in and when you
start up, the air has to find its way out. Imagine the lifter as a
syringe of water, but with the needle end closed and flat against
the cam, the plunger against the pushrod. Now that water inside is
instead being pressurized constantly to 40 psi or so (oil pressure)
from a little hole in the side of the syringe. If a big bubble of
air leaks in so it is only half water and half air inside, and if
everything is closed off (by the external oil pressure when you
start the car) the air is trapped. When you push on the plunger the
air compresses and the plunger can collapse easily some distance
before a balance is achieved.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Oil can't be squeezed. Air can be, therefore it
is not good to have air in your lifter. You can check for this if
you have noise. Go along with a big screwdriver and try to push on
the bottom end of the rocker shafts, right in line with the
pushrod. Do this when the cylinder is near or at TDC and the valve
train is not loaded (though many of the valves will be unloaded at
once so give em all a quick push). The rocker shaft is knurled
right where you press so the screwdriver won't slip. When you press
(and I mean a good hard press) there should be <b>no movement</b>
at all. Chances are some of them will be "soft" when you press
them. Maybe they will move in less than 1/16" of an inch feeling
spongy. Those have air, but are probably OK. Then there will be a
couple real offenders. Those you will be able to shove a good bit.
These definitely have a lot of air in them and little oil. You are
basically just compressing the big spring in the lifter. So we have
hydraulic lifters with air in them. What do we do?</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The questions we must ask are: Does this happen
every day? Does the rapping stop after 10-15 minutes driving? If
you drive the bus everyday does it stop even faster? My first
opinion: if you know the engine hasn't been fooled with and the bus
hasn't been driven in a few weeks, change the oil to something
light (10W30), put on a new filter, and sit there in the drive and
rev it up and down for 15-20 minutes, staying in the 2000-2500 rpm
range. Get it good and warm but don't rev it too high. If the bus
has sat for a few months or even a few weeks and begins to quiet
out, then subsequently quiets out each morning after even up to as
much as 10 minutes, and isn't banging <b>really</b> loud: don't
worry.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I parked my old '78 on a sideways slope for 8
months then fired her up. It always had 2 dying lifters that
pounded for 1/2 an hour (and I mean <b>pounded</b>). Make sure all
the rocker shaft nuts are torqued correctly and be happy. <b>NEVER,
EVER</b>, use Quaker State oil with VW hydraulic lifters.
Generally, I run the oil weight VW recommends. In my climate that
means 10W30 winters (but only if it stays cold else maybe some
15W40) and 20W50 in the summer. VW is very conservative about oil.
They recommend thicker stuff than most manufacturers. Use a good
oil and filter and change it every 3-5000 miles. If you run the
proper weight oil it won't cause you any noise or trouble. I use
Castrol GTX or Shell Rotella exclusively. I can often run the
Rotella 15W40 diesel weight oil year round in a camper that doesn't
get everyday use.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Still Making Noise?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">So it still pounds? If you didn't know any
better, you'd be tempted to adjust the valves. There are 3 much
possible solutions:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">1. Bleeding the Lifters<br>
2. Additives and Purging<br>
3. Special Adjustment Procedure (a compromise, as proffered by Mark
Steven's and others)<br></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>1. BLEEDING THE LIFTERS</b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">This is the hardest, most labor intensive
"solution" and it most likely won't solve your noise problem! You
can refer to the relevant section in the Bentley (official VW
service manual) for the "bench bleeding" procedure, for what it's
worth. To do this you must pull the valve covers, pull the springs
retaining the pushrod tubes, pull the rocker arms, pull the
pushrods, pull the pushrod tubes, then pull the lifters
(discouraged yet?!).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Replacing the pushrod tube
seals</b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Admittedly, this can be a good thing to do if
you want to replace pushrod tube seals anyway. Replacing these
seals correctly can be an adventure in itself. In short: don't use
RTV. O-rings work on clean, lubricated surfaces by compression.
That tube of blue, orange, red, or black goo won't last-- you'll be
back again facing the same leak in a few months, doubling your
labor and aggravation. After removing the aforementioned parts,
<b>immaculately</b> clean the areas surrounding each lifter bore.
Ideally, you should do this the day prior when you pulled the under
pushrod tins (if present). It's also a good idea to soak bottom of
the engine block with degreaser in advance. Scrub the block around
the tubes with a toothbrush, hose it off with hot water, then let
it set to cool and dry overnight.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">After that, clean out each bore carefully with
kerosene and paper towels (as many as it takes). Clean the bigger
part of the bore where the pushrod tube O-ring has been riding and
you make sure nothing is up in the machined lifter bore itself.
Pushing a scrap of towel back into the top of the lifter and using
a toothbrush on the bore where the o-ring sits is good. The towel
prevents debris from settling back in the bore.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Do the same to the bores over on the heads.
Install Viton o-rings with silicone grease (or at least oil) and
those tubes won't leak again. Verify the tubes are not dented where
the o-ring sits--that will cause a leak. Also, if you are
experiencing blowby (gases that slip past the piston rings,
pressurizing the crankcase) nothing will stop the
leaking.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Back to Bleeding the Lifters</b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Now that the bore is spotless, we can pull the
lifters. Use a good 2lb magnetic parts "picker upper", or catch the
lip of the lifter with a pointy right angle pick. If you choose the
latter technique be very careful not to slip and scratch the bore.
If everything is clean, a magnet should get them out, but you might
have to work them back and forth a bit.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Pull all of them and keep them in order. If
you're pulling them all, you can store them in an egg carton with
numbered holes (#1I, #1E, #2I, #2E, etc.) or do them one at a time.
If you're only doing the ones that feel soft, just be sure you
somehow keep track so that a lifter goes back in its correct
bore.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Now is a good time to inspect the cam. The T4
cam wears badly. Let's assume power and compression are off, and
the heads are newish on an old bottom end. Look down the bores at
the toe (top area) of one of the lobes on the cam (at least one is
going to be facing you down a hole). Is it smooth and even or is
there a 1/16" dip in the center? If here is a healthy dip, your
compression has very likely been low and power is down. In this
case, your bottom end's days are numbered. Assuming there is over
100k on the engine and you didn't buy it from meticulous owner who
changed the oil every 3000 miles, be aware that your power will
continue to wane. Expect a $1500 bill sometime in the next 25k
miles. The Type IV bottom end is rock solid as far as the crank and
rods go, but the cams wear.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Now we'll disassemble, bleed, and reassemble the
lifters one at a time. Remember to return each of them to their
numbered bins.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Inspection and Disassembling the
Lifter</b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">You'll need:</font></p>
<ul>
<li><font size="+1">a small can of kerosene</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">a pair of quality needle nose pliers or 2 tiny,
flat screwdrivers</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">a pick or paper clip</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">an old bug pushrod (ideal) or a rod of
something about 5/16" diameter. You can use a bolt, but file off
the end a bit semi-circular, then sandpaper the end smooth and
clean it well.</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font size="+1">Take a lifter and inspect it. Bentley says to
push the socket with your thumb, I say use the pushrod (even one
off your Type IV engine for now). Lean on it with all your might.
If it doesn't move, or barely moves, return it to its spot in the
numbered tray. If the socket sinks noticeably and easily, while
holding it down (not really necessary) remove the circlip with your
needle nose pliers or the 2 screwdrivers. Note: unless you have 10
or 20 used lifters sitting in a box like me, do this in a clean
area on clean newspaper (kitchen table is good). If that circlip
flies off and hides itself and you want to drive the bus tomorrow,
you better have a metal detector (ask me how I know!).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Take out the socket, plunger (with check ball,
spring and retainer), big spring, etc. The valve retainer will snap
off the plunger with finger pressure, revealing the ball and little
spring. Let it all soak in the can of kerosene for a few minutes,
then scrub all the parts with a toothbrush or Q-tips. Lay
everything out to dry on a paper towel. Everything should be clean
and shiny. Blow out the body with air if available, else make sure
all the kerosene is gone with a paper towel or Q-tips and blow the
lint off with your mouth. If anything looks terribly worn,
scratched, or scored, you should replace it. However, you'll
probably find most of even the real soft ones look brand new
inside. That is because the wear and tolerances we are dealing with
are minute.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Reassembly and Bleeding</b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">If you've been refering to the Bentley manual,
you'll notice at this stage it becomes particularly useless. They
expect you to have a press and jump through hoops keeping the body
immersed in a pan of oil while pressing. Ironically, the Vanagon
Bentley carries over this foolish procedure from the '68-'79
Bentley, but also has (in section 15.24) the far better procedure
for the wasserboxer lifters...which can also be used for the air
cooled lifters!! Needless to say, we will be following the better
instructions for the wasserboxer.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">You need a vice. A big C clamp will do (though
I've never tried it this way). A small vice is fine, just the
length of the lifter plus an inch or so. You also need about an
inch of that bug pushrod, or the inch long 5/16" bolt with the tip
filed semi-circular and smoothly sanded.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Take some SAE40 oil and lube all the parts, then
put the little spring in the check valve retainer. Sit the little
ball on the spring and clip the assembly to the bottom of the
plunger, making sure the ball stays centered on the spring. Drop
the big spring in the body of the lifter and take the SAE40 oil and
fill the body of the lifter until it overflows. Immediately drop in
the assembled plunger/check valve assembly. Oil will swish out the
hole in the side of the body and over the top. As you put it in,
put a pick or the tip of the paper clip in the hole to push the
little ball down, so as the plunger slides in, oil and any air
under the plunger come out the valve and the plunger sinks nicely
into the oil filled body. Push it down with your fingers as far as
you can. Now top off the body if it has flowed out and drop in the
pushrod socket. You won't be able to get this in all the way--that
is what the vice is for.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Immediately take the lifter to the vice, but put
a pad between the lifter face and the vice (aluminum soft jaws are
great if you have them). Hold the lifter there with the little hole
in the side of the body <b>facing up</b> while you hold it all
together. Use your smoothed bolt or 1" section of pushrod in the
socket and close the vice, compressing the socket as shown in the
Vanagon Bentley figure 15-493. Do this just far enough to expose
the groove for the circlip. Oil will ooze out the body side hole.
Install the circlip. Take it all out, store with the face down, and
test it again with thumb pressure or the pushrod. It should be rock
solid. Repeat this as many times as needed on the lifters that need
it.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Adjustment</b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Reinstall the lifters, pushrod tubes, pushrods,
rockers, retainer springs, everything in order. Back all the
adjuster screws out maybe 3 or so turns. If you don't know valve
adjustment basics, you may refer to the information in Muir's Idiot
book, the Bentley, or even the Haynes manual.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Go to each cylinder one at a time and set it to
TDC for adjustment. If you've backed the screw out 3 turns or so,
both rockers on that screw should rattle freely. Bentley says back
it all the way until it is flush with the rocker. That is fine as
well, but make sure the pushrod does not slip out of the socket on
either end at the lifter or in the rocker. With them just loose
this won't happen--double check by looking down the pushrod with
the mini Mag Lite. The pushrod should spin if it is loose in
between the two sockets. If it does fall out on the inside end and
rest against the lifter somewhere else, you will notice because the
pushrod will be too far out, making the adjuster screw contact way
before all the others do (probably before it is even hardly out
past the rocker.)</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Also check when you push with the screwdriver on
the pushrod end of the rocker: it should now be dead solid. You
might have a time limit here. Even with 40 weight oil, and not
having run or warmed up, your newly bled lifter could leak in air
overnight just sitting there on its side, so install them
<b>immediately</b> before adjusting. Also, install the lifters with
the little holes initially up.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The rockers are loose and that cylinder is at
TDC. Now, with the tension off, is a good time check the torque on
the rocker shaft nuts. Watch while you run each screw in till it
just touches the valve. A good way is by rocking it with one hand
(tap, tap, tap) while you turn. When it just touches: no tap. Then
turn it 1, 1.5, or 2 complete more turns. VW initially said 2, some
say 1, I compromise at 1.5 turns. Do both on that cylinder, tighten
the adjusting lock nuts. There's no need to be fussy about holding
the screw while tightening, just make sure the screw doesn't turn
while you cinch the nut (unlikely).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Move to the next cylinder, set it at TDC,
repeat, etc. You have just correctly adjusted your lifters by the
book. They are going to stay that way with that thick oil in them.
But the bad news is, when you run it the first time and it sits a
day, the noise will be back! At least you have verified that a
lifter is badly worn. Perhaps you should replace the real soft
ones, or, if they quiet down after 5-10 minutes, live happily
knowing they are set correctly. The bright side is the pushrod
tubes don't leak anymore, and maybe you know the cam is worn and
should be passing the Bus along or thinking about a
rebuild.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>2. ADDITIVES AND PURGING</b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">If even after an oil change the valves still tap
mercilessly and don't stop after 20 minutes of revving in the
2000-2500 rpm range, pull the covers and verify they are soft.
Consider that if the engine is in the 100k mile range and there is
much burnt oil in the rocker boxes, it might not be long for life.
Perhaps it has just sat a long time and the lifters are immersed in
dirty oil. In this case they need to be flushed.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">You could try an STP "wonder" product, CD-2?,
Warner or other aromatic solvents claiming to solve all your lifter
problems. It might work...or it might knock so much debris loose
you will regret it the rest of your engine's short life! If it is a
new engine with lower miles I might be inclined to toss a can of
"wonder" liquid in. But I'd do it a couple of days before an oil
change and if it doesn't help, change the oil.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Next option is to flush with thin oil. (SAE10 if
you can find it, Dexron Automatic Transmission Fluid otherwise).
Somewhere between 50/50 10W30 to ATF or just straight ATF if you
are feeling manly. Be forewarned, <b>this is risky</b> and
potentially engine life threatening, especially if too much stuff
breaks loose or if things get too hot. A new oil filter should
catch most stuff, but... I've gone the straight ATF route. For you,
maybe the 50/50 is a better, more conservative bet.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>If at any time you see the oil light come
on--STOP IMMEDIATELY--cool down, and go back to regular oil</b>.
Even with normally worn components, a 10 minute run with RPMs up
should not cause a 150k mile engine to have oil pressure problems.
If you notice pressure problems, you have other mechanical issues
to attend to: worn pump, extreme bottom end wear, overheating,
etc.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Start the engine and as before, run it up to
2000-2500 rpm, this time for about 10 minutes. Keep the rpm's
moving around a bit, let it cool for 30 minutes, then repeat.
Repeat maybe 4-5 times with good, long cool downs and stop if the
lifters stop tapping. If by trial number 5 nothing is changed:
Stop, change back to oil, consider replacing suspect lifters as in
step 1.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">If the noise at idle did go away, stop, and add
new, quality oil and filter. Keep it changed (every 3000 miles) and
start the bus every day and let it run 15 minutes or so. This can
be a great trick to clean things out. It can also be fatal if done
badly or if you are unlucky. If your bottom end is loose already,
nothing fixes extreme wear and bad maintenance. I've done this to
clean out a few vans, and you may do it wisely and at your own
risk. I also killed a GTI engine this way that sucked too much
debris up the filter screen. I've heard professional mechanics
recommend the straight ATF route, but again, this is at <b>your own
risk</b>.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>3. SPECIAL ADJUSTMENT
PROCEDURE</b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">You may use this procedure if your lifters are
noisy for 5-10 minutes then quiet down to no more than a minor
tapping at idle (or when you let up on the throttle suddenly after
acceleration). Do this if you yearn for something "scientific
minded", but don't want to pull the lifters. This is the best thing
to do when you just get a "new to you" bus. First, check for the
soft lifters as before, then do the following. Adjust all the
valves to .006" just like a solid lifter engine. This is a bit
tricky. Be sure when you adjust a soft one that the feeler gauge
isn't just compressing the lifter. Go to TDC, back the screws out
until they don't touch, and gently rest a finger against the
pushrod end of the rocker holding it against the lifter (but not
compressing the soft lifter) then adjust the other end to the .006
gap. Repeat for all valves at the appropriate TDC for each
cylinder.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Start the engine and let her run a minute or 2
at 2000-2500 rpm. It will be very loud. Maybe it will quiet a bit.
Stop the engine, pop the valve covers, turn to a cylinder and see
if the previously soft lifters are now hard. If so, immediately
close the gap (Which may already be gone if a soft one pumped up.
In that case open the gap then close to just contact). Adjust to
1.5 turns past contact as detailed previously. The valves are warm
so don't burn yourself.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Had you checked them all before and all 8 were
solid, you might find when the time came for the adjustment
procedure (adjust, turn the engine, adjust, etc.) by the time you
get to the last 4 they might already be soft again! My old '78 was
this way: the bad ones would only hold pressure for maybe a minute
or 2--had to work fast on them. This is no real problem. Just do
the one side first, then put the valve covers on, start it for
another 2 minutes, go do the other side. This is a practical way to
get them pumped up and assure they are in good adjustment. If you
adjust to 1.5 past contact ON A SOLIDLY PUMPED LIFTER you endanger
nothing in the valve train and the lifters have plenty of slop,
plus they seem to pump up better running loose. If they refused to
pump solid you need to adjust to about a turn or so past contact to
roughly where it was before you started. With contact being
ascertained as before by gently holding the rocker on the pushrod,
you might need to consider bench bleeding or eventually replacing
the lifter, or with luck it might just go away.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Some play is acceptable, but if you can push the
rocker down an 1/8" you have problems. You can try to adjust all
the way round and perhaps all will be right. But you'll likely find
the next morning nothing will have changed. So keep the oil clean,
and don't worry if they tap for even as much as 15 minutes or more
if the bus sits for a month or so. Basically, live with it, and
don't worry so much unless things are really banging around back
there.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Again, you may want to consider flushing with
ATF--it can work miracles and stop the noise, or it could be a
$1500 solution! You make the choice. For the first 15 minutes most
days you should have nothing more than extremely minor tapping and
valve noise from a hydraulic lifter VW van. perhaps you can have
noise from one or two lifters that sounds like a properly adjusted
mechanical lifter bus, no more. The length of time it taps depends
on the oil, angle it was parked on, how long it has been since run,
etc. But a faint persistent tapping from one now and then that
won't purge is nothing to get upset about--chances are it will come
and go.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Someone on the Type2 mailing list mentioned that
their valves seats had been cut to the point where the rocker
shafts rested on the retainer and compressed the valve. That isn't
right. I don't think a Type IV seat installed at the correct height
could be cut so far (correctly, without cutting out of the seat)
that the valve is that deep into the rocker box. But this is just
speculation. Shimming the rockers is about all you could do--but I
think spring tension would be way low in this case.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Something I recently noticed: the 1.7 style
rockers with 8mm adjusting screws perhaps have a different ratio
and are not interchangeable with 2.0 rockers (or maybe the rocker
shafts are set at a slightly different height?) Perhaps the real
problem were the 1.7 heads rebuilt for the 2.0 engine, or perhaps
the difference was my imagination (?). Or perhaps the early, solid
lifter 1.7 components and the 2.0 hydraulic valve train isn't
strictly interchangeable. Regardless, something is incorrect in
that situation. There should always be adequate clearance between
the rocker arm and the retainer.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">It is important that the adjuster screws stick
out past the face of the rockers for the entire distance where they
are turned down and probably a couple of threads. If anything (with
machined valve tips) they should be sticking out more. Generally
speaking, for all the prior procedures, it is a good bet that ALL 8
ADJUSTER SCREWS best be turned in about the same amount if
everything is correct. If one is drastically different from the
others, something is wrong: the pushrod is not seated correctly,
the rocker shaft isn't tightened, you adjusted at the wrong time,
or a variation on that theme.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The tips of all the valves should be level.
Determine this with the rockers removed and a straight edge across
the tips. If there is a minute difference, the tips might've been
machined or there might be a small variance in the valve
seats--this is acceptible. However, if one of the valves is
sticking out over 1/16" when all the rocker shafts are off, you
have the beginning of seat recession. If that cylinder's
compression measures at 90 psi or so, you'll soon need a new set of
heads or an engine rebuild. Heads will run with a seat pounded 1/8"
into the head, but not well. In that case, all the adjustment in
the world isn't going to help you.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">A final note: if you do have a couple very bad
lifters and they disturb you (even the 10 minute tapping) replace
them. They only cost about $10 from Bus Depot, more from RMMW. This
might not be a great idea though since the lifter isn't guaranteed
to be a great match for the hardness of the cam. Also, some of the
replacement lifters have a smaller hole in the side of the body
than the original had and might be less inclined to purge air. If
you do install a new, replacement lifter, make sure it was properly
bench bled solid before installation.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">As I've implied, all these problems tend to show
on old, high mileage vans. By the time you have 125k miles on a
poorly maintained Type IV engine, chances are that the cam is
beginning to wear with the hydraulic lifters, and the heads are
soon to go, etc. Replacing some things may buy you time but you
must carefully consider everything you do. For instance, $500 in
heads on an engine whose cam is failing doesn't make a lot of
sense. Perhaps you should save for a new engine.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">A lot of vans get sold this way. A novice bus
buyer overpays for a bus ($2500 for a $1000 bus), then 6 months
later has $600 heads installed (often badly by non-VW mechanic who
leaves big gaps in the tin). Six months or a year passes and the
engine is dead and the novice sells the bus at a loss, unaware of
the dynamics at play. Be smart, trust your own good judgement and
do your research. Read a copy of Tom Wilson's "How to Rebuild a
Volkswagen Air Cooled Engine" book and read it even if you never
intend to rebuild your own engine. Do it so you can speak
intelligently to a shop.
