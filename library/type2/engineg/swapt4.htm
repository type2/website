<h3>1972-1979 Type IV Crankcases and Swap Considerations</h3>
<p>by Mike Gensler and John Anderson</p>
<hr size="2"/>
<blockquote><font size="+1"><i>"Without major modifications
(cutting and welding etc.), what motors can I put into my 1972
1700cc camper bus? "</i></font></blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Mike Gensler writes:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">All type IV cases were created equal and are all
100% interchangeable. You can take any type IV long block from a
72-78, bolt on your old intake, flywheel/clutch, and exhaust and
off you go. I excluded 79 buses in that last statement because they
have 1-year only square exhaust ports on the heads and would
require the use of the 79 exhaust system as well.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">You can even take a motor from any year (70-76)
Porsche 914-4 and bolt it in as long as you use your old intake,
flywheel/clutch, exhaust and sheetmetal, but the oil filler and
dipstick will be located differently. You can probably use any type
IV motor from a VW type IV as well, but I don't have any experience
with them.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The intake systems are where the differences
really start to add up. The original dual carbs that came with your
bus will work, but will adversly affect the power of any engine
bigger than the stock 1700. And if you want to switch to FI from a
late-model bus, in addition to needing ALL the FI pieces (don't
forget the ecu, fuel pump, relays, etc.), you'll have to swap your
gas tank so you have a return tube for the gas.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">John Anderson writes:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Mostly Mike is right but I want to note some
interesting things as I have a 1700 case and a couple 2.0 cases
apart right now. All Type IV cases aren't quite created equal. This
transcends the previous discussion about Vanagon cases having the
obvious breather box, dipstick tube hole, and not so obvious 10mm
bearer mounting holes. There are more differences.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">First, the 1700 is an entirely different
(slightly) casting than the 2.0. If you look at the pictures of the
914 1700 in Tom Wilson's [How to Rebuild Your Volkswagen Air cooled
Engine] book you can see what I mean. Observe on page 123 the split
line of the case below #3 main bearing bore, just below an M8 stud,
where the oil pickup goes into the case. This is a single wall on
the 1700 case, but somewhere along the line this becomes a dual
wall forming a little resevoir pocket of oil on the suction, a
resevoir to which the drilling from the pressure relief valve
dumps. I would guess for a VERY instantaneous loss of oil at the
pickup, perhaps in high g cornering, the little pocket would
provide some buffer, but it is a real small volume. I didn't look
but wonder if the length of the oil pickups change slightly as the
new wall is forward of the old one.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Another difference is dual oil pressure relief
valves. This one I'm not exactly sure on. I don't know if the
second relief valve between the #1 lifters disappears between
1700/1800/2000 cases or if it disappears for hydraulic lifters. I
do know that hydraulic lifter cases only have the one main relief
valve and a plug where the second one would be and of course no
drilling for its return into the sump. Perhaps the lifters
themselves function as relief at high temp/high rpm? This would
would make sense--or perhaps they need all the volume they can get.
Also, the fuel pump is not drilled on FI cases and 914 cases
feature the same dipstick drilling as Vanagon cases, as perhaps do
411/412 cases.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">These are all in all pretty trivial changes but
it does make me wonder what would be <b>proper</b> for retrofit of
hydraulic lifters to a solid lifter 1700-2000 case, particularly if
the second relief valve should be blocked (somehow blocking the
return as well obviously) or if a high pressure (longer) piston
like [the Porsche aftermarket company] Automotion sells should be
used.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">One wonders about how much the little resevoir
matters. VW installed it as an improvement, but how much of one is
hard to say. The pickup tube lengths (if different) could also be
an issue.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">On a side note, I measured a couple of solid
lifter cams at about .290 lift, the hydraulic at .250 lift. Bob
Donalds of Boston Engine reports both are used occasionally in
hydraulic 2.0's from VW so I also wonder if the solid cam isn't a
good idea for a little warmed over engine?</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">As Mike says, a '72 to '83 block will bolt right
in (assuming you're using '79 heat exchangers on the '79 to '83
blocks and kept your original fan shroud). The bearer mounting
problem I'm guessing can be cured the same way VW cures it. It
appears to me ALL T4 cases are drilled M10x1.25. I guess all from
'72 to '79 have helicoils in the 4 bearer holes from the factory.
One could simply run 4 helicoils into a Vanagon case for Bus use or
perhaps try to extract the inserts for Vanagon use from a Bus
case.</font></p>
<blockquote><font size="+1"><i>"From page 90 [of an edition of the
John Muir Idiot book]: "Models after November, 1975 no longer have
an oil pressure control valve so don't look too long for it."
"</i></font></blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">I noted the same in the Bus Bentley in figure
9.1 in the Engine and Clutch section showing the breakdown of the
Type IV case. As to what this means for someone wanting to retrofit
hydraulic lifters into an early type IV case, I don't know. Again,
Automotion sells longer (to increase the spring pressure) oil
relief pistons for both pistons for use in the 914/912E (and de
facto any Type IV) case.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">411 cases apparently come with the Bus style oil
fill hole blocked (same for 914 cases?) in the casting and feature
a drilling down the breather for the oil fill. To use a 411 (or I
surmise, but don't know: a 914 case) would require the annoyance of
keeping the existing filler (not bad in a Vanagon, but cramped in a
Bus) or carving out the bus fill hole and drilling and tapping for
the mounting stud and bolt.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">For the record, there is <b>no problem
whatsoever</b> using a Vanagon case in a Bus despite what Tom
Wilson's book says. Simply use the Vanagon clip on breather, or if
you don't have it on hand slip the breather tube directly over the
steel pressed in flange (though this is tough) and there is no
change. The only problem one will run into regards the bearer
mounting holes and for that one must simply be prepared with 10mm
bolts. Drill out your bus mount pads or perhaps run a $0.25
helicoil down each hole. I'm not positive that will work-- it would
if the Vanagon case is threaded M10x1.25 (fine) for which you would
then use the 4 M8x1.25 bolts you have. If instead it is M10 coarse,
then you need to find M10 bolts. Offhand I don't recall what the
thread is, but I do know it is the same as the rear late baywindow
bus bumper mounting bolts. We also experienced something weird on
the flywheel end but perhaps that was just due to manufacturing
tolerances.<br/></font></p>
