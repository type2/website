<h3>Diagnosing Engine Trouble</h3>
<p>by David Schwarze</p>
<hr size="2"/>
<p><font size="+1">For the benefit of those who may someday be
stuck out in the boonies with an inoperative or semi-operative bus,
I suggest the following. Comments / corrections welcomed, of
course. All of this is in reference to 72-74 bus engines with dual
Solex carbs, but most of it is applicable to other busses as
well.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>THE BASICS</b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Your engine needs three basic things to run -
compression, fuel, and spark. Your engine needs three basic things
to run - compression, fuel, and spark.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I repeated that line because it is fundamental.
An elderly man told me that when I was in my early teens, then
proceeded to diagnose and repair the lawnmower-engine-powered
minibike I was riding (well, pushing). If you are having engine
trouble, it will likely be lack of compression, lack of fuel, or
lack of spark. Confronted with a problem such as what happened on
the baja run with Brian's bus, I would have attacked these areas
one at a time in the following order:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>COMPRESSION</b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Check compression first. A compression tester is
something that I always bring on long trips. Pull all four spark
plugs *first*, then remove the coil wire and check the cylinders
one at a time. Hold in the clutch so your starter won't have to
spin the clutch disc and transaxle input shaft. All four cylinder
readings should be over 100 psi and within 15% of each
other.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">(Aside: If you have a good ear you can do a
pseudo-quickie compression check by simply disconnecting the coil
wire, cranking the engine, and listening to the pulses. If you hear
"da da DA da da da DA da da da DA da" you probably have a weak
cylinder. If the pulses all sound the same compression is probably
okay. A real compression test will tell you a lot more. I've also
noticed this doesn't work very well on type I engines for some
reason.)</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The results of the compression test will tell
you whether to proceed or think about a tow truck. If compression
is low on one or more cylinders, there are a couple of things you
can do. First is check the valve lash. Tight valves will lower or
eliminate compression. If the valves are okay, you might look for
loose cylinder head bolts, but that's about it. Failing those two
things, you have serious internal engine trouble. It's good to know
sooner rather than later. If you're a glutton for punishment you
can get some more information by pulling the valve covers and
looking for motionless valves while the engine is being cranked
(watch out for flying oil!).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">If the engine passes the compression test, move
to electrical next. I have found that electrical problems are much
more common than fuel problems.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>ELECTRICAL</b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">If the bus won't start, have someone get ready
to crank it for you. Pull the center wire off of the distributor
and hold it very close to where it plugs into the center of the
cap. Preferably hold it with an insulated tool, or use a glove.
Don't hold onto the body of the bus with your other hand. Don't
have bare feet. Have your friend crank the engine with the key on
and a decent sized blue spark should jump repeatedly from the end
of the wire to the place where you plug it into the cap.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">If you see the spark, you are doing pretty well
and most likely don't have an electrical problem. The only other
electrical thing that could keep your engine from starting in this
case would be if the timing was way, way off.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">If you don't see the spark, check that the coil
is getting current at the + terminal. Use a multimeter if you have
one. A multimeter is something that I always bring on long trips.
If the coil has 12V and you aren't getting spark, you have either a
bad coil, bad condensor, bad points (check that the point gap is
reasonable: .015-.020"), or bad coil wire.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">If the bus is running at all, do the following.
While the engine is running, and using the same cautions listed
above, pull one wire at a time from the distributor cap, then
replace it (not the center wire though). Each time you pull a wire,
the rpm of the motor should drop considerably, and should increase
when you plug the wire back in a couple of seconds later. Do all
four and note which (if any) are not changing the RPM of the
engine. If all four cause the RPM to drop, you probably do not have
an electrical problem. In fact, you probably don't have any problem
at all, so let's assume at least one wire does not cause a drop in
engine rpm.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>*** This next section is important
***</b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">If <b>ONE</b> wire out of four does not drop the
RPMs, suspect the following:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">a) that plug wire (switch two wires to test)<br/>
b) spark plug (pull it, look for cracks in the porcelain, obvious
damage)<br/>
c) distributor cap (look for cracks, burnt contacts)<br/></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>FUEL</b><br/>
(yeah, we're switching to fuel right in the middle of this
test!)</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">If <b>TWO</b> wires out of four do not drop the
RPMs, and those two wires are both on one side of the engine (i.e.
cylinders 1 and 2, or cylinders 3 and 4) suspect the following on
the carb/intake from *that* side of the engine:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">a) idle mixture screw in too far<br/>
b) idle fuel cutoff solenoid plugged/inoperative<br/>
c) vacuum leak between manifold and head<br/></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">For a), simply try backing out the screw (turn
counterclockwise). The screw is in the throttle plate just forward
of center, and angled forward towards the outside of the bus. If
you back it out and the engine picks up rpm and smooths out, great!
Do the wire pull again to make sure and drive off happy.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">For b), first pull the wire off the end and wait
5 seconds. If the rpms of the engine drop, b) is not the problem.
Put the wire back on and go to c). If the rpms of the engine don't
drop, check to see that the wire is getting 12v. Use a meter or
circuit tester. A multimeter is something that I always bring on
long trips! If the wire is live, reconnect it, reach up and very
slowly loosen the solenoid 1/2 turn while the engine is running. If
it is plugged, the engine will begin to pick up speed briefly when
you have loosened it about 1/2 turn. It won't last long though -
the engine will be stumbling again in a few seconds. Shut the motor
off, unscrew the solenoid and look at the little hole in the very
tip of it. Three times now I've found it plugged with debris. Blow
it out or poke it out gently with wire. I usually find a piece of
14 or 18 gauge wire and use just one of the strands to clear the
obstruction. Don't want to enlarge the hole.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Install the solenoid (then replace your fuel
filter). In addition, the solenoid should make an audible click
when you connect or disconned the wire. If it doesn't click, it
probably needs to be replaced.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">If b) failed, diagnose c) by running the engine
then spraying carburator cleaner at the base of the manifold (where
it bolts to the head). Be liberal and hit it from all sides if
possible. BE CAREFUL and have a fire extinguisher handy, although
I've done this for years without the slightest hint of danger. If
the engine RPMs drop at all, you have a vacuum leak between the
manifold and head. If the engine stalls, you have a pretty bad
leak. Tighten the four nuts holding the manifold to the head and
try to limp to someplace where you can replace the gaskets or have
them replaced. These gaskets are metal, and don't seal very well
unless the mating surfaces are flat and smooth. I had horrendous
trouble with this until I removed the engine and polished the
surface of the head with a dremel sanding disc. Also check the
surfaces of the head and the manifold with a straight edge to make
sure they're perfectly flat.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Backing up a minute, if the engine won't start
at all, you only have to do one test to find out whether it's fuel
related. First, remove the air cleaner, make sure the choke plates
are open and crank the engine for 30 seconds without giving it any
gas at all. This will clear any flooding in the carbs. If the
engine is flooded it will crank for a while without catching at
all, then very slowly start catching on one cylinder, then two,
then three. Avoid the urge to give it any gas - just keep cranking
until it stays running.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">If it never sounded like it was catching, get a
couple of ounces of fuel (helps to carry a spare gallon here) and
pour half into the top of each carb. Try to start the engine again.
If the engine catches briefly and then dies, the carbs are not
getting fuel. Check fuel filter, fuel pump, fuel lines. Open the
gas cap and rock the bus back and forth and see if you can hear gas
sloshing around in the tank. Maybe you're out!</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>FUEL PART TWO</b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The engine has two separate fuel systems. Well,
three actually, but bear with me. The one we've been testing up
till now is the idling system. Assuming the bus idles smoothly and
passes the plug wire pull test, the main fuel delivery system could
still be malfunctioning. Symptoms would be a smooth idle (of
course) but bad/inconsistant acceleration when you hold the
throttle down. This is most probably caused by the main jet being
plugged. Find out which carb it is by removing the throttle linkage
from 1 carb at a time and trying to drive. When the good carb is
hooked up, the bus will drive a little. With the bad carb hooked
up, it will barely move. You can open up the bad carb by removing
it and either taking the top off (five slot head screws) and/or
reomving the 13mm plug in the side of the bowl. The latter is
easier but doesn't give you as good of a view. Stick a screwdriver
through the plug hole and unscrew the jet. There will probably be a
bunch of crap sloshing around in the gasoline at the bottom of the
bowl. Make sure the jet isn't plugged, then clean out the bowl and
put the jet back in. The third system I mentioned is the
accelerator pump mechanism, but you can live without that
one.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Argh, this is getting long. I know I've left out
a lot of cases, but these are all of the things that have happened
to me over the years, so hopefully they will be useful to someone
else.</font></p>
