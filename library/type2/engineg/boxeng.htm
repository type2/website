<h3>Vanagon 1600cc Crankcase Description</h3>
<p>by Brian Verbeek</p>
<hr size="2">
<p><font size="+1">I saw a CT engine (used in May'79 to Dec'82
Transporters, 1584cc, 50HP (37Kw)). It's based on the T1/T3 case.
It has factory HYDRAULIC LIFTERS and an OIL FILTER MOUNT cast into
the left case half, next to the oil pump, above the rear pressure
relief valve (only one), parallel to Cyl #4, slightly angled
downward. I bought it for 75 Guilders, a shortblock with cylinders,
fanshroud and oil cooler.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The fanshroud looks like a T4 unit but is made
of pressed steel instead of magnesium. It has a O-ringed dipstick
hole and the T3 oil filler opening. No boss or stud to mount a
regular thermostat: on this engine it's bolted to the oil filler
opening studs. The crank mounted fan hub can be replaced by a
regular crankshaft probably (if one were considering converting it
to upright).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">On the other side of the crank it has four
dowels and a gland nut, identical to the upright engines. The
opening for distributor, fuel pump and generator stand are all
there. Only the generator stand studs are 6mm instead of 8mm as
we're used to. They only have to hold a plastic, O-ringed breather
tower, similar to the T3 engine.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The lifters slide in from the pushrod side, they
are about 2.5" long and have an oil groove of approximately 3/4"
wide. Cam lobes are narrower than the regular upright cam. The oil
pump is identical to the 70s 1600s. The three holes for the rear
engine mount are there, but the mount itself is different of
course. The case has some additional mount bosses and webbing cast
on the rear, looks a bit T4.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">It has the usual sump screen as well, no drain
plug in the plate. If you look into the cylinder openings of a
regular upright you'll see the main bearing case webbing. These
have hollow spots in them. The CT case has these filled in. It's
NOT deep studded, but it does have 8mm headstuds with
casesavers.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">It has T4 like hydraulic lifters which slip in
from the head sides of the case, has normal DP upright 4 rivet cam
gear and oil pump, and has longer thread sparkplugs, filter, and is
made out of AS21 or AS41. It has a single carb, stock 69mm crank,
probably with the 215mm flywheel (which i also had in my '78 1600
single cab). The flywheel attaches with regular glandnut, not with
the 5 bolts like wasserboxers have.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">It has the three rear engine mount bosses
drilled and tapped. If considering converting to upright, there are
no bosses cast into the case to mount the pulley tin, not enough
meat to drill and tap. Also, on the rear of the case you'll find
four cast on mounting ears for the fanshroud (these need to be
removed should one wish to convert to upright). The oil cooler in
and outlets are in the "L" case half between the distributor and
where the upright shroud would be. A solution to this might be to
use a doghouse cooler and adapter in a slightly modified non
doghouse shroud.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">A German machine shop (BAS) didn't like the
engines too much, they have seen too many problems with them,
though I think it would be the ultimate case (if there were plenty
around which there are not). BAS said the cases were not as good as
the regular T1/T3 cases. The machinist thought that was proved by
the fact that VW discontinued it after only a few years of
production. I personally think that that could be due to other
reasons as well. It might not be a popular choice for
Transporter/Vanagon buyers. Not to forget, VW came with it in '79,
there was a little oil crisis then if I'm right... It didn't last
very long and people were looking for more performance again. I can
imagine that a 1600 Transporter/Vanagon would be rather
underpowered.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">BAS says the filtercase is of poor quality.
According to them it has 8mm oilgalleys (with hydraulic lifters
?!), only one oilpressure relief valve and suffered sealing
problems at the case parting line. Those would be the main reasons
why VW discontinued it after a short period of production
('79-'82).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">It would still be nice to convert one to upright
though. It has a T3 like oil filler and long dipstick in the same
location as T1/T2 uprights, fan mounts on a hub on the rear of the
crank, engine still has no rear oil seal (wasserboxer does). It
uses heater boxes which are longer (only the rear ends are
extended). If you'd shorten them they would fit a standard muffler.
Original heaterboxes to these motors are often found cheaply at VW
events here in Holland. The oilcooler is mounted in T3 fashion and
also has the oil pressure switch mounted on it.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The filter boss is cast on at the rear oil
pressure relief area, at the rearmost of the left case half. It
points to 8 o'clock. It has the same bore and stroke as the upright
engines, the crank, rods, P&amp;Cs, valve covers, oil pump, fuel
pump & distributor location are identical. It has a hydraulic cam
and lifters which slide in after the case is bolted together. I
didn't get the pushrod tubes with it but I think they are the same
as Wasserboxer tubes. They are thicker on the case end.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The cooler is mounted the same way as in T3s,
but then on top of a 2.5" thick spacer. But (and this is one of the
main problems should one wish to conver to upright), its mounting
holes are <b>behind</b> the usual location. If you look at the top
of a T1 case, between the bellhousing and the distributor, you see
it's divided by the case webbing (on which the upright fanshroud
sits) into three almost equally sized partitions. Now, we are used
to having the oil cooler holes in the middle part, but this one has
them moved one part to the rear, towards the distributor. This
could be solved by using a dog house cooler and adaptor in a non DH
fanshroud and cutting the shroud were it has to fit over the cooler
adaptor. Adjustments to the cooler location can easily be made by
flattening the adaptor or by using pieces of the spacer which comes
with the Vanagon 1600.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Under the cylinders there are T3 cool tins (in
fact, they can still be called T3 cool tins) but they are clamped
onto 8mm headstuds. The older T3 ones used to mount on 10mm studs
so the mounting tabs are different (their part number starts with
either 070 or 171).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The other main problem (if converting to
upright) is that the case has four cast on mounting ears for the
rear mounted fanshroud. These have to be removed by either
machining and a little remodeling or with a saw and lot of
remodeling. That can be done, but there is not enough meat to drill
and tap for the two M6 bolts that are supposed to hold the pulley
tin.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The oil cooler holes in the case aren't cut for
regular cooler seals. (To convert to upright) I figure that you
-could- use a doghouse shroud if you'd use a DH adaptor along with
the 2.5" spacer. The spacer would go right through the fanshroud.
But there's another problem with the cooler adaptor too. You have
to use dual carbs as the cooler adaptor sits in the way of the
stock manifold.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Stock Aluminum T1 cases?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">As for aluminum T1 cases, I've heard of a
limited number of aluminum cases. They would have been made in
Emden or were installed in cars that came from the Emden factory, I
don't recall who told/wrote me--it's all I know. I have never seen
one and don't know if this rumour is really true.</font></p>
