<h3>Rust/Corrosion Descriptions</h3>
<p>by Austin Jack Smith</p>
<hr size="2">
<p><font size="+1">[See also: Aircraft Corrosion Control by Crane,
Dale]</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">In order for corrosion to get a start , it must
penetrate any corrosion shield that has been used to protect the
vehicle from the various types of corrosive forces. Corrosion can
be classified into 9 categories:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>1. <u>Oxidation</u></b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">This occurs when two atoms of Iron or Steel(Fe)
jointhree atoms of oxygen producing iron oxide or rust. 2Fe+3O
-&gt; Fe2O3 Essentially the same formula holds true for Aluminum
and Magnesium as well except it occurs at a much slower rate in
Aluminum.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>2. <u>Uniform Surface
Corrosion</u></b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">When an area of unprotected metal is exposed to
atmospheric contaminates there will a uniform attack over the
entire surface. This dulling or miniature pitting of the metal is
caused by microscopic amounts of the metal being converted into
corrosion salts. Which will accelerate the corrosion until the
metal is destroyed.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>3. <u>Pitting</u></b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Pitting is a continuation of surface corrosion.
Pitting may be detected by the appearance of a white powder on the
surface of the metal.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>4. <u>Intergranular
Corrosion</u></b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">This occurs mainly in non-ferris metal or
various alloys. Microscopic examination of most alloys reveal that
they are made up extremely small grains of the various components
of the alloy held together by chemical bonds. When this type of
metal is heated and cooled improperly these grains grow until the
grains will reach such a size that areas of dissimilar metal will
form efficient cathodes and anodes for corrosion formation. Your
vehicle could look like a dry cell battery that has been left in a
flashlight way to long.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>5. <u>Exfoliation
Corrosion</u></b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">This is a type of Intergranular corrosion that
occurs in extruded materials such as angles and channels where the
grain structure is more laminated. This type of corrosion along
grain boundaries and causes the metal to separate or delaminate
with the resulting structure weakness.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>6. <u>Galvanic Corrosion</u></b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">This is one of the most common type of corrosion
and will occur when these two conditions are present.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">A. Two dissimilar metals are connected in such a
way as to provide a path for electron flow.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">B. their common surface are covered with some
material that will serve as electrolyte. In other words conduct
electricity.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">This means that a steel fitting on a alloy
crankcase or transmission can form a very primitive battery. The
less noble metal in this case the alloy will form corrosion
products and will be eaten away, like the outer zinc case of a dry
cell battery. It must be noted that both of the conditions above
must be present. Thosed of you that use outboard engines in salt
water have or should have a small blocj of "sacrifice metal" on
your engine part that is in water, the sacrafice piece is designed
to be eaten away before your engine replace it when it start to
have lost one half of its size.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>7. <u>Concentration Cell
Corrosion</u></b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">This occurs when water covers the surface of a
metal some seeps in between joints, spot welds, and seams. This
condition can cause Concentrated Cell Corrosion. Water in open air
readily absorbs oxygen (O) from the air, it then attracts electrons
from the metal to form negative hydroxide ions. 2H2O & O2 & 4
electrons-&gt; 4(OH) This is a type of corrosion that you would
find underneath sealant in the various joints and seams and also in
closed areas like the hollow side beams.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>8. <u>Stress Corrosion</u></b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">This is another type of Intergranular corrosion
found in the present of stress from poor quenching in heavily
welded areas such as the transmission engine horn areas, axles,
steering gear, etc. . Tensile stress occurs in the presence of a
corrosion environment. The bad part of this type of corrosion
causes cracks and grow very rapidly as the corrosive attacks the
end of cracks rather than the sides. In a high stress area shot
peening is used to provide uniformly compressive stressed surface.
Careful visual inspections may reveal this type of corrosion, but
to be able to find the actual extent of the cracks requires dye
penetrant inspection.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>9. <u>Fretting Corrosion</u></b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">This occurs when two surfaces fit tightly
together but can move relative to one another. This type of
corrosion acts very rapidly as any protective coating is rapidly
removed. This is another reason to properly torque all
fasteners.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Corrosion occurs when the metal is unprotected
by proper coatings. All good protection methods are used as a
ï¿½Systemï¿½ that is a series of treatments that end up by having
several compatible coatings on the metal to be protected. All of
the major paint companies that sell to industry have such systems.
I am particularly impressed with the POR-15 system as it includes
the basic treatments ie:</font></p>
<ol>
<li><font size="+1">Clean the metal with a special cleaning
compound designed to be used with their own system</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Preparation of the surface to neutralize rust
and prepare the metal for the next coat by etching the metal and
neutralizing any rust.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">A special undercoat to bond with the metal and
provide a very hard undercoat.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Last a topcoat that will protect the previous
coatings and has ultra-violet radiation protection.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font size="+1">One last point reference to painting the engine
and transmission. True it used to be thought by many well meaning
people that painting an engine could cause heat build up, but I
have checked with many aircraft engine overhaul companies and
engine manufactures, they all report that they paint their engines
and the FAA requires it. I have corresponded with a friend in
Europe who reports that even VW paint their overhauled engines to
indicate the engine built up for leaded and unleaded gas. I have
written Bob Hoover (Sermons) and he paints all of his engines. I
have included his references above. A flat black paint is nearly
transparent to heat transmission. Aircraft engines are subject to
the same heat dissipation problem as our engines and it would seem
logical to follow their recommendations.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I hope this may help you with your vehicle
protection, especially those of you who live where they use salt on
the road. If you are unfortunate to live in that environment you
should wash your vehicle every time that it is exposed to salt, a
good hose down especially in the undercarriage area. When I was
stationed at Omaha, I rigged a 7 ft. pipe with drilled hole pointed
up attached by hose to the hot water tank drain. I could drive
slowly over before I put my car into the garage. I had a Mark VII
Jag and a 1960 Bus at the time and they had a very poor rust
prevention coating. I used about 15 gal. of hot water and it drove
my wife crazy, but I didn't have a corrosion
problem.<br></font></p>
