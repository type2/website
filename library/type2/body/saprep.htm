<h3>Sand Blasting, Body Prep, Wet Sanding, and Safety</h3>
<p>by John Anderson</p>
<hr size="2">
<blockquote><font size="+1"><i>"I myself prefer to sandblast
damaged areas, then Variprime them and hit the rest of the sound
paint with a DA (Dual Action Sander). Prime the bus with a good
sandable epoxy primer, guide coat it and then countless hours of
blocking it out (this is where you and your bus really
bond"</i></font></blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">I'm no "pro" bodyman, but I do better work than
most "professionals" around here. These are good, sensible
suggestions in general. You want to avoid bare metal as a rule if
you can--but sometimes you can't avoid it (like on the average
condition crazed bus roof or if you really want to know what is
under the paint, or if you feel there is too much paint on the
bus).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I feel using PPG DP40, 90 (whatever color epoxy
you want) after a good metal etch and conversion coat will be
easily equal to what VW put on there 30 years back--so long as you
had the metal as clean as VW did, and if you can coat everywhere VW
did (the major failure problem). I like plastic media blasting, but
the media is expensive. Check a local or regional industrial buying
guide and try to find out where dealers are buying their product.
Often you can buy a 200lb drum direct. I have also had very little
problem warping panels with standard fine blasting sand so long as
I don't dally in one spot, maintain about a 45 degree angle to the
surface, and so long as you run the pot with a small nozzle and a
bit lower pressure.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Sand costs $5-10 for 100 pounds, the plastic
media around or in excess of $1 per pound. I run my Tip 99 at about
80-90 psi with a 7/32 nozzle, and my old DeVillbis military dual
stage compressor can run it there all day long without loosing
pressure. If I want a smoother finish I balance for more sand, more
pot pressure, less acceleration pressure. Regarding the blocking
and sanding, this is where I am right now. The windshield surround
of the truck and 2 things make my life amazingly simpler. First, a
foam rubber "Wonder Block (tm) by Motor Gaurd Corp": best sanding
block for irregular surfaces like a bus I've ever found. I'd
strongly recommend it, not for blocking flats, but because it is
invaluable along the beltline, etc.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">This is the third time I've used the polyester
primer/surface and I can't say enough about this stuff. This is
sprayable gold (in color and worth.) I'm using a gallon of product
called Z-chrome Rust Defender. This stuff is amazing in what it can
fill, in that it does not shrink, and it will spray over anything
without lifting the substrate and it sticks. A couple warnings,
spray it with a cheap gun, you need at LEAST a .070 tip, and you
may want to thin it a bit with acetone. Doing this, it will go on
heavy and smooth with no appreciable orange peel. I use it between
two coats of DP40. It says to use it directly on bare metal, but
I'm unsure since I trust the PPG epoxy beyond belief.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The Z-chrome is a savior for scratches,
pinholes--all the stuff you would have used spot putty or a heavy
laquer based surfacer for. You'll never worry that it will shrink
back into sanding scratches. I did a large panel of the '90 a year
ago with it, it is still perfect today. I pushed it to the limit:
leaving bondo at 80-100 grit scratches beneath this, Z-chrome, then
taking it directly to 220 dry, the second DP40 coat, and a 320
scuffing then topcoat. This stuff can save you so much time it is
amazing. It's worth twice the $40 I paid for the gallon.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I'll also interject that I'm still ludicrously
happy with my Sharpe gravity feed HVLP gun for my topcoat
applications but I'm looking for an economical source for spare
cups. My only gripe about the thing in general is the fact the cup
holds much less than a quart. But I knew that going in, and I think
the convenience of the gravity feed design as far as balance and
size outweighs the negative. The "HVLP" functionality seems not
entirely BS, there is a lot less bounce and paint goes noticeable
farther. I like it better than my friends turbine which I always
seem to spray overly dry.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>SAFTEY FIRST!</b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">All body work products have a little CYA
litigious, US inspired warning reading something to the effect:
only to be sold, mixed, applied by trained professionals using
appropriate equipment etc. Now, this doesn't stop anyone round here
(MD, PA, WV) from selling to anyone off the street, even with the
HVLP laws that I believe are now in effect in MD. (On that issue as
I said, HVLP is smart, works for you and the environment and I'm
all for it.)</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Although I believe that DP40 recently changed to
a slightly safer formulation for heavy metal reasons, MOST ANY GOOD
EPOXY OR URETHANE PRIMER OR TOPCOAT SYSTEM WILL KILL YOU DEAD.
Heavy metals, and worse, isocynates, ready to do nasty things. When
you buy a product get the application literature and read it. I
think it is law that it is provided, I know the MSDS has to be.
Face some facts: buy a respirator rated for isocynates if they
still exist (haven't seen one sold since the late 80's). It was
rather expensive then at $80-$100. An average organic vapor
respirator from Lowes for $30 don't cut it "by the book" for most
systems. I know a lot of people who use them, but technically it
isn't up to it.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The literature will tell you what NIOSH, MSA
level respirator is needed and will likely suggest positive
pressure instead of a respirator. This is a move I made a few years
back as I am inclined to respiratory problems due to my foolish
involvement with fiberglass dust during my MS research years.
During sandblasting you should wear at least the $30 respirator and
I've moved to using a QUALITY dust mask for mere sanding. The paint
still has heavy metals and creates an extreme nuisance dust with
fine sanding. I recently tried the N95 rated nuisance mask, about
$20 for 20 at Lowes or $5 for 2 (you figure which to buy). These
are 3M 8210? masks. Much nicer than the average cheapo dust mask,
fit tight, dual layer-- fit so well that your breath doesn't fog
your glasses if you wear them. That gives you a good idea, and you
should be wearing them (glasses) when sanding, when painting with
the respirator if you don't have a half or full mask. Wear a good
hood during sandblasting (I wear hooded Tyvek coveralls taped at
ankles and wrists too, since I don't like sand up my
orfices.)</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">You've got one body, make the most of it. Decide
what level safety you need to afford, take responsibility for
yourself. A hobby positive pressure system is about $350. Your life
is worth a tad more (or maybe not?!), but a lot of cars have been
painted with mere dust masks even with urethane catalysts. Decide
what you need, how much you intend to do, and obviously if
predisposed to respiratory problems, DON'T do it,
period.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">That's all well and good, except maybe you're
addicted--maybe you can't stop, because it is the only thing left
in life you truly enjoy. Running your hand over the freshly
finished contours of a nice bus, or a nice vette, or whatever. Or
perhaps you like turning a wrench, or lying in the mud under the
van with antifreeze running all over you (have I mentioned recently
I hate my waterboxers?), or gasoline, or motor oil?</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">...These things get under your skin: buy a MIG
and you want a blaster, by the blaster you need a new spray gun,
buy the gun and you need that positive pressure
system...</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Painting Tips</b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I don't like turbine systems. I spray at least a
van every other year and do touch ups on friend's stuff at least
yearly. I have lots of hobbiest friends, one of whom bought a $750
3 stage turbine about 3 years back. We all spray it too dry with
way too much orange peel. Even he does 50% of the time and he has
tinkered with reducers, tips, etc. And we've had lots of people try
it: guys who have been hobbiest painters for years, primarily with
PPG enamels and urethanes.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Something I do like: my Sharpe gravity feed SGF
HVLP gun. It's the best gun I've owned period--much better than my
old Binks. Goes on nice, with good gloss, and actually does have
some HVLP functionality. I paid $150, which was a very good deal.
But Harbor Freight sells a DeVilbiss low end HVLP for this price
and I just ordered their rip off gravity feed HVLP for $49 special
to spray primer. We'll see how it goes.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I note when looking at an HVLP for compressor,
I'd sort of shy away from "siphon feed" HVLP guns. It doesn't make
sense: they need more paint at pressure whether by gravity feed or
pressure pot (the SGF comes in both of these models and a "siphon"
model for $40 less.) I bought this gun on a whim, didn't expect or
care anything about its HVLPness, and have been quite satisfied and
amazed. It won't put all the paint on the car, but sure puts a lot
more on than even a quality, older siphon gun. It's the smoothest
spraying gun I've touched, and I've recently sprayed the $350
Accuspray compressor run gun--it did nothing more.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Wet Sanding</b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Wet sanding is either between coats or as a
final treatment. The idea is to sand off all the rough "orange
peel" surface from a new paint job to make a perfectly level
surface. Back in the 60's, 15+ coats of nitrocellulose laquer were
put into a good job, with wet sanding between every 3-5 coats.
Today one typically wet sands between coats only to fix an extreme
error, or between coats of different colors or different materials
(2 tones, clear coats, after primer, etc.) to rough the surface and
give the new top coat "tooth" to stick to. It isn't always done
then and in fact should NOT be done between coats of some systems.
So mainly wet sanding is at the end, when all is
sprayed.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Some systems are made to go on rather dry with
much sanding necessary, though most enamels and urethanes spray to
a good gloss with only overspray and problem areas requiring work
to build gloss. The hobbiest who doesn't do so well or the cheap
pro job can be drastically improved by wet sanding. Specifically
speaking, one starts with 600 grit silicone carbide wet/dry or
finer paper on a softer backing block. Soak the paper in a bucket,
then start sanding along contours in 1 direction only (unlike when
blocking down filler with cross hatch). Do the entire car, then go
to a finer 1000, then to 1500 grit. As you sand you frequently dunk
your paper and block in water and use a sponge or a squirt bottle
or a hose to keep rinsing off the fine sanding debris. Always keep
the surface flooded and never let buildup gather on the paper (this
is why you do it wet instead of dry, and you change paper
frequently). To get things perfectly smooth you use a "guide coat"
technique. To do this you shoot a contrasting color (say black on a
red paint) compatible spray paint or the like thinly all over your
freshly painted bus, like grafiti. The contrasting paint will be on
the mountains and the valleys of the orange peel in the real paint.
When you finally sand to the point all the contrasting paint is
gone, you know you have leveled all the paint to perfectly
flat.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">BUT!!!! This isn't to be taken lightly:
depending on how much topcoat is on the car to begin with, it is
VERY, VERY easy (even for an experienced painter) to sand too far
and go through into the primer or even to bare metal, particularly
on edges and bends and all the contours of a VW bus. And if you do
that you are in trouble. It will require extensive spot repair to
remedy. This is complicated by the fact that water tends to pool
with all the sanding remains along those surfaces and you don't
even realize you are through until you rinse again. Smooth the flat
surfaces and mentally sand on an edge or against some body feature
(say 1/10 of the amount you think you sanded on the adjacent flat
panel). Always use a backer of some sort (eventually you realize
how to do it bare handed but until you do, you risk sanding too
thin under where your fingertips press). Sometimes a backer is
worse up against a sharp edge...it all gets complex.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Then you've got to ask, "What do I really want,
show paint on a bus?" A late bay comes with healthy orange peel
right from the factory. Do you intend to over-restore? Now most
resprays will be slightly rougher, even after buffing, but not
much. So for most people a light color sanding of only problem
areas (runs, bugs, or really rough orange peel from overspray or
the like) is what is probably sensible, followed by a good buffing.
The secret to shine is mostly in the final buffing with a quality
professional compound on a foam pad. This is for the final coat.
For initial cutting I like a wool pad. Even a cheapy professional
buffer (the $50 WEN is good value for more than a couple of cars
compared to $120+ for a Milwalkee, DeWalt, etc.) is far more likely
to make your car look how you want it to look: shiny, but not
perfectly smooth. 50's and 60's VW paint is a bit better done and
smoother than the later stuff. If you want perfection you can work
for it, but be ready to pay the price. This is all largely what
makes the difference between the $1000 job and the $5000+ job on
your friends '67 corvette.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Wet sanding of primer and initial old material
in the 220 to 400 grit wet range is commonly done as well for
preparation to topcoat, seal, or prime. Wet sanding is better in
many respects because the paper lasts longer, but it gets stuff
wet. This is a problem if you again go to bare steel, and water
isn't fun at times like winter, etc. The sludge that runs off
carries a light dust to nooks and crannies of the van that can
cause paint separation later. The most important thing with any job
is to wash with good soap and water and then auto degreaser before
you ever touch the van to even do body work. Also do this after you
have everything done and are ready to put on any paint coat (i.e.
before each prime, each seal, each topcoat, where you have sanded
prior.) Again this is what costs money, a guy who knows what he's
doing takes his time.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Don't be afraid of wet sanding your van. But
realize that it is best to get the hang of it on something you put
little value in (a beater) before you attack your pride and joy. Be
prepared for the possibility you mess it up and be ready to deal
with it. Back in high school we painted a friends '70 Blazer with
car paint and brushes (!). We started at 320 and went to 1000 grit,
then buffed it out and it looked...well, as good as a lot of $500
paint jobs! But it wasn't really cost effective. A final note: buy
quality paper at a good paint supply store. Shop around and find
who has the best prices. A foam rubber block called a "Wonder
Block" is great for final sanding.</font></p>
