<h3>Bus Nose Panel Replacement Comments</h3>
<p>by Roland Wilhelmy, Bob Hoover, and Ken Hooper</p>
<hr size="2">
<p><font size="+1">Ken Hooper writes:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">There are a lot of people contemplating nose
replacement lately. These are in response to my query about
replacing the nose in a splitty but once I got to looking at it,
much of this may apply to a bay as well, but the flanges are turned
180 degrees the other way in a bay. Modern coachwork.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">These are very dense but they start to make a
helluva lot of sense once you've read them 10 or 12
times.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Also Rob King noted that "new" replacement noses
are not designed wide enough to do flanging/wraparound tricks, you
have to get the wide noses from a donor bus rather than a retail
source.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Let us commence.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Mr. Roland Wilhelmy writes:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Here are my thoughts. I think it is best to make
your cuts on the lines along the areas with tightest radius. Of
course you have to make the cuts really carefully and allow extra
metal so you can fit pretty precisely, but it is easier to grind
the welds to look well on more curved surfaces than running through
the flats. You can do sorta fake flanging by fitting for a butt
weld and then first welding in backing strips to support the inset
panel. These can range from complete backing to just enough pieces
to make it easy (huh!) to hold the panel in place while you tack
things together -- whatever suits you. And the welding of the
strips can range from big tack welds to full length beads, as you
choose. I am uneasy about trying to flange, say, ten feet of edge.
If you do flange, you will be flanging the bus metal, not the
patch. If you don't have the flange depth just right, then you have
to do a lot of filling of one side or the other of the patch line,
which is about as hard as butt welding it in the first place. And
flanging is a lot easier on flat panels than on the middle of a
tightly bent line.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">One point in deciding where to put your seams is
that you will be really thankful if you can reach the back side of
the seam lines from inside the bus. This is darn near impossible to
arrange, at least fully, but do think about this and do what you
can.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">If you can rent a plasma cutting torch to trim
out your bus' nose, I say spend the money. Cutting with a plasma
torch is almost like drawing a line with a magic marker, only there
is a narrow little cut where you "draw" instead of a black line.
Like with a marker, you use a ruler or straight edge to make
straight lines, and cut out patterns in metal and wood to guide you
on curved ones (or just cut inside the line, freehand, and clean it
up with grinders and files and shears). I have a small 110 volt
plasma torch and think it is the handiest tools there is, next to a
MIG welder. Plasma torches need very modest amounts of 50 psi
compressed air, along with the 110 volt ac. You can cut painted
metal with no problem, just be sure that what is behind the panel
you are cutting isn't going to catch fire. It isn't nearly as much
flame and sparks as a gas cutting torch, but there is some, more
like with a grinder.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">If you decide to try flanging of some sort, I
have a different sort of flanger that I haven't gotten up the
courage to use yet: From Eastwood, it makes just a small bend along
the edge of the metal, deep enough to let a MIG weld bead sink to
almost flat in the V made where the two edges come together. This
flanger is of the modified Vicd-Grip plier type. If you guys want
to try it, I will lend you mine with the understanding that you
will return it to me when you are finished with welding the nose.
(If it works well enough, you can get your own).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Most important, if you "don't know what" you're
"doing" with a MIG welder, plan to spend at least ten hours
practicing on scrap VW sheet metal, making the sort of welds you
are going to be doing on the nose. And have a good hand held
grinder to finish off your work. "Flap wheels" do a nice looking
job, but they aren't cheap. Start on your bus after you are happy
or at least satisfied with the look and solidity of your work. MIG
welding isn't brain surgery, but a few hours of practice where you
can make some of the inevitable mistakes all weldors make is a lot
easier to take than having to repair messes that didn't need to
happen on your bus. Besides, as you will find, it is a lot easier
to weld on horizontal surfaces than on the vertical ones your bus
will be offering you. Learn on hunks of horizontal sheet clamped
together on a table. Then practice a couple of welds running across
and up and down vertical sheets. Then you will be ready.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">And Mr. Bob Hoover writes:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The best cut-off tool is an air-driven
die-grinder mounting 1/16" thick cut- off disks. Second-best is the
standard 4" electrically powered hand-grinder (about $20 at Harbor
Freight -- disks are about half a buck each [ie carton of 10 is
about five bucks, locally] ). I've got four or five such grinders.
Keeps me from having to change disks/flappers as the work
progresses.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">You can get 1/32" thick disks for a die-grinder
-- makes a truely elegant slit in a steel panel... for about a
foot. Then you need a new disk. Sixteenth- inch thick, mebbe three
feet per disk, depending on the thickness/hardness of the stuff
you're cutting. (Oddly enough, harder stuff cuts
faster.)</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The disks used on 4" angle-grinders are about
3/16" thick, last for as long as you can keep them in contact with
the metal (the head of the grinder gets in the way) and are much
less expensive than the diamond-hard Resinoid cut-off wheels used
with die-grinders.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Saws are normally only used in areas you can't
reach with a grinder, such as slicing thru a 2x4 'C' section from
the top --- grinder can only cut about 1" deep. Blades are
expensive. Disks are cheap.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">If you've got the whole front-clip to play with,
remove the entire nose skin at the folded seams along each door
pillar and the folded seam along the bottom. IF the
wipers/windscreen are not rotted out, cut BELOW the level of the
wiper indentations, leaving at least half an inch for a flange.
(More is better. You can trim it later.)</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">To cut the seam, you simply grind off the outer
edge of the fold then GENTLY go after the spot-welds with a sharp
chisel. This will result in local deformation but in almost every
case it will be OUTBOARD of the crease between the seam and the
body-panel itself. You then dress this flange back to truth, ragged
or not.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">On the bus to receive the skin, you follow the
same general procedure except you cut away the skin INBOARD of the
folded seam and go after the spots with the EDGE of your grinder,
LEAVING THE OUTER PART OF THE FOLD UNTOUCHED.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">What you'll end up with a lip on the edge of the
fold. If you will now grind that flat you will see that have a
flange to which you can spot-weld PLUS a surviving 'factory' edge
on the fold... with a gap between the donor panel and the edge of
the fold that will have to be filled, ideally with the migger but
schlock shops use Bondo, etc.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The big advantage here is that you end up with
flanged surfaces on which to adjust the position/placement of the
donor panel yet the visible, significant flanges have retained
their factory fold & shape. If you try to build this flange back up
by welding/grinding, you'll find yourself spending as much time on
that task alone as you spend on the rest of the job. By retaining
the edge of the fold -- AND LEAVING IT ALONE -- you need only fill
the gap.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Positioning the skin is also much easier when
you have 'factory' flanges on three edges. The joint under the nose
will require trimming, then forming of the flange, then trial
fitting and perhaps more fitting -- flanging can stretch the
skin.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The usual flange tool is pneumatic but manual
and electric types are available. I use one of those attachments
that chucks into a rivet gun. It forms a flange half an inch long
and .030 deep. In use, you gotta lean into the thing. The flanger
is just a high-speed hammer & dies. The flange won't form itself --
the metal will just vibrate back & forth. It takes the strength of
your arm to make the flange 'appear'. Once you get it started, you
simply walk the tool along the end. It will guide on the cut-edge,
so you want that ground straight and cleaned up real nice. Once you
have a good flange, you fit the new panel to the flange by gently
grinding it down until the new panel fits neatly into the flange
with a gap of about a sixteenth. That is the space into which you
will weld or apply filler if the flange is to be spot-welded. The
edge of the fitted panel must also be clean and well dressed. If
spot-welding, the resulting flange is often painted with weldable
primer. After the repair is done, if the lower edge of the flange
is accessable, it's a good idea to seal it. In hard-assed repairs,
you weld it. (Grendel's new driver-side full-length rocker-panel is
welded both sides at the top.)</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">To secure a new nose skin you start at the
middle, top & bottom, then work toward the side seams. You'll need
about a zillion round-nose finger-type vise-grips.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Once you get things tacked, focus on NEVER
letting the panel get overheated. This is a bitch with gas -- you
can't weld more than 3/4" at a time then have to move to another
area. With a migger, you can do about 2" before you have to let
that section cool. That means, doing about four weldments then
waiting until you can put your hand on the LAST one you did before
going on.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Spot-welding is the best way to secure the lower
& side flanges. With clean surfaces you can tack every 4" or so,
alternating, side to side, go back and tack in between (ie, 2"
pitch) for about four tacks on one side before alternating. When
it's tacked at 2" pitch, take a break, let it cool, go back with
dolly & hammer and dress-out any local distortion. Then go back and
put a real 'keeper' between each of the previous spot-welds. That
gives you a 1" pitch and should result in a symmetrical, drum-tight
installation. Then comes the gap-filling (or edge-welding),
followed by a lot of flapper-wheel work.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Don't try to polish-out all evidence of the
spot-welds -- there are valid applications for body-filler and this
is one of them. If you can afford to do so, use the epoxy-based,
metal-filled fillers (Eastwood, etc) rather than the
polyester-based, silica-filled fillers such as Bondo. You'll need
to use more work to get the metal/epoxy filler smooth but you'll
end up with a more permanent surface.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">If you don't have a spot-welder, look into
renting one or borrowing one. They run about $250 for a good one
but you can often find them used for about half that. You should
even consider buying one for the job, selling it after.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The only secret to good spot-welding is clean
surfaces, easy enough to achieve with flapper wheels. And clamps. A
lot of guys mistake their spot-welder as a clamping fixture :-),
fail to provide enough clamps to hold things together while the
welding is done. Pay attention to the shape/condition of the copper
electrodes. Polish them (gently!) as the job progresses. If the
seam is well-clamped to either side of the target-spot, you won't
need all that much clamping pressure to get a perfect 'nugget'.
Although infinitely easier than conventional welding, there is a
learning curve involved with using a spot-welder, as well as a bit
of practice needed if you've not used one for a while. Making up
some coupons from the old nose-metal will allow you to practice. Be
sure to tear your test-welds apart. The welded-together 'nugget'
should not come apart -- the parent metal should tear
first.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The top seam, where you'll want to form a
flange, will be mostly concealed behind the dash. Before doing a
nose job it's a good idea to remove ALL wiring from behind the
dash. The package tray, wipers and heater ducts should also come
away.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Working with an entire skin you can put clamps
on the edges. This is often all you need to bring your flanged-seam
into alignment. But you also have the option of using wooden poles
or other means of exerting pressure against the back of the seam.
This is usually only needed in the center. You may also use clecos
or sheet metal screws but if you're not familiar with the technique
-- or if you don't have enough clecos -- you can build in some
ugly, ugly bulges in an otherwise perfect seam. Holes for clecos or
screws are filled later, either with gas or by backing-up the hole
with a copper block and hitting it with the migger. The migger does
best here. Chamfer the hole -- make it bigger, with a decided taper
-- so the heat gets to BOTH panels at the same time. Otherwise,
they will heat/cool at different rates and you end up with minor
bulges that give the finished seam a slightly 'pillowed'
look.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Clamp. Weld. Cool. Move on.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">As a general rule, the greater the mass of
copper you use to back up a weld, the less will be the heat
distortion, risk of burn-thru, blow-out, etc. But the curveture of
the panel dictates the size of the contacting surface (unless you
specially cast/shape your coppers). For a bus nose the copper block
is going to be limited to about an inch square. The usual procedure
is to shape/dress raw copper stock then braze it to a steel rod.
Grip the rod with vise-grips, etc, press firmly against the hole.
Working alone, it goes pretty slow but sometimes that's
good.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Welding supply houses offer an assortment of
commercially-made coppers.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">A lot of guys tackle a nose job without regard
to what they're going to find once the skin is off. Often times,
once the skin is off they find another weeks-worth of work in the
substrcuture. There is a classic water-trap at the foot of the
panel (and a hell of a good source for road noise to get into the
cockpit). It isn't a very good design.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">You'll also see (by the placement of the welds)
that the heater-ducting was installed before the nose skin went on.
You'll be doing things backwards so plan how you're going to
re-install the ducting... if you take them out. (Some shops have
the tooling/experience that allows them to leave them in, work
around them.)</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">If you want to build-in a concealed
compartment... with the nose skin off, examine the 'well' at the
bottom of the panel, between the supports for the bumper. (The
trick here is that after removing the front belly pan -- and
finding nothing concealed above it, few inspectors extend their
search to the frame-rails or body panels that have been concealed
by the belly pan. Or, so I've heard.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I suggest you de-rust this area aggressively.
This is also the ideal time to deal with those nut-plates for the
front belly-pan. Once you've dealt with the rust, flood the space
with corroless or other thick-film anti-corrosion paint. Insert
steel tubing for the electrical harness to pass through and put
globs of RTV over the nut-plates then fill the void with
high-density urethane foam, the stuff you mix together and pour
(check with a hobby shop. Our local HOme Depot has started carrying
it). The anti-corrosion paint should be allowed to dry for two or
three days before you foam it.</font></p>
