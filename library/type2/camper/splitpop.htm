<h3>'74-'79 Pop Top Retrofit on '67-earlier Type 2</h3>
<p>by Richard Palmer (a.k.a. Poor Richard)</p>
<hr size="2">
<p><font size="+1">Author's note: I originally wrote this article
in the spring of 1997. Since then, I've used the top with no
problems for the last 2 years, and am still quite thrilled to have
it. The only downside to it is that it adds a little extra weight
to the top of the bus, which will make it handle more like a late
model than a splitty. Other than that, it's great for road trips,
camping, and just sleeping out in the bus! :)</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><img class="img-responsive" src="../images/poorpop6.jpg"></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><i>Pictured above: Notice the custom canvas,
which I made by cutting out an old camping tent and sewing it up
according to the pattern of the old canvas, which was too rotten to
use.</i></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Howdy all. This is for everyone who owns a bus,
and has at some time wished for the extra sleeping space of the
luxurious double bed pop-top, available on Westfalias starting in
1974. I myself have long craved such a top, but never desired the
mechanical complexities of those later campers. So, the only course
for me, and everyone else out there with no pop-top, is surgery.
Having done the operation last weekend, I am pleased to announce
that the necessary transplant is not painful, and the results are
definately worth it.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><img class="img-responsive" src="../images/poorpop5.jpg"></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><i>Pictured above: Side view of canvas, with
larger than normal windows for better air circulation, and
fabricated front air dam</i></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><img class="img-responsive" src="../images/poorpop1.jpg"></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><i>Pictured above: Interior view, looking
backwards from front seats, showing front of bed in driving
position.</i></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Now this is not to take the process lightly, as
it is a VERY involved task. You'll need to chop the rear 2/3 of
your roof off (although I hear Vanagons may not need this, due to
their flat roofs), and then do some serious welding. But, given a
weekend, and the necessary equipment, you'll find it definately
will not be a super-difficult task, and certainly
rewarding.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">As background, I have a '67 camper, which I feel
is almost the perfect camper arrangement. The only thing it was
lacking was the upstairs bed. So, after much ponderance, I decided
that the transplant was in order. When a fellow listee mentioned a
willing donor for the top, a '75 Westy, I knew that the time was
right. I cut off the entire roof of the donor bus just to have
everything as a pattern, and brought it home, which was an
adventure in itself. I then took the entire assembly apart, just to
see how it fit together, and to measure and inspect the metal
framework that the factory fabricated for the top. The next step
was to take EVERYTHING out of the rear of my bus. I do mean
everything, because it's going to get really messy back there, and
any seats or carpets will be ruined by sparks and welding scraps
and such.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">After a careful comparison of the two roofs, we
confirmed that the split-window roof definately has a higher degree
of curvature than the late model, but it doesn't make the project
un-doable. Of course, as with any modification, measure twice, cut
once. Actually, measure about 5 or six times. Once that roof is
cut, it's gone. We used the sides of the bus frame as reference
marks, and measured in towards the center of the roof. We cut from
the front roof brace, behind the front doors, to the rear brace,
just inside the rear hatch, and cut at a horizontal distance of 5
inches in from the sides of the bus. Now, this removed one of the
major frame members, so that has to be replaced. You'll also need
to run two rails the length of the bus inside the hole to firm up
the edges, and rest the bed on.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Having seen fellow listee Stefan's just
completed transplant, I had a good idea of how to do this, although
his is a late model so dimensions are different. We ran a piece of
1" square 14g steel tubing between the front and rear roof braces
on each side of the bus. We then welded a piece of 2" square 14g
steel tubing across these, in place of the cross brace we had to
remove. We also welded an additional 1" brace across the rear to
support the rear of the bed. Once the frame was in, we bent/beat
the roof sheet metal as flat as possible across the rails, and tack
welded it down. At this point, paint is a good idea, to prevent
nasty rust.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">After that, it was time to mount the top. Now,
before mounting the top, it's a good idea to fit the bed in, and
drill all the holes necessary to mount it. Once it's all in, TAKE
IT BACK OUT. Yep, that's right. It'll only be in the way now, but
you want to get all the holes drilled before you put the top on,
since it's a lot easier that way.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><img class="img-responsive" src="../images/poorpop2.jpg"></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><i>Pictured above: Rear hinge, passenger
side</i></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Now, set the top on the bus. Line it up all the
way around, then carefully pop it up, and have someone mark the
mounting holes for the hinges. Remove the top, and drill ONE hole
for each hinge. Put the top back on, and bolt that one spot down.
Now make sure the other holes line up, and everything is cool. If
it doesn't line up, you've only made one hole, instead of
3.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">After getting the hinges bolted down, it's time
to mount the front brace. This one requires a lot of patience, as
you have to make sure everything lines up with the top both up AND
down. Check those holes very carefully, as it has to be perfect for
the top to work right.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Next, mount the hold-down latch bracket for the
front. Just make sure it lines up well, and mount it- that's pretty
straight forward. After that, you're home free if you have a late
model. Just fasten the canvas down, and attach the fiberglass
luggage rack to the roof, and away you go.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><img class="img-responsive" src="../images/poorpop4.jpg"></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><i>Pictured above: Front air dam, viewed with
top down.</i></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">If you have a split, you still have a bit more
to go. The front of the roof of a late model is VERY different from
the front of a split, so you can't use the fiberglass luggage rack,
or at least all of it. So, you have to get creative in finding a
way to stop water from blowing up under the top. I cut the rear
part off the luggage rack and used it as a base. I'm getting some
aluminum flashing to round out the air dam to smooth it out a bit.
Basically you want to keep things dry, and smooth out the lines for
airflow as much as possible.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Another important note for splitties is that the
hinges for the bed might not fit. Mine didn't, so we welded corner
brackets to keep the front bed section from sliding off.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><img class="img-responsive" src="../images/poorpop3.jpg"></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><i>Pictured above: Interior view of welded-in
frame, showing cut cross member where it
re-attaches.</i></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Anyway, all told, this makes for a good weekend
project for 2 or 3 people, assuming you can weld, and aren't afraid
to cut a hole in your roof.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">You need:</font></p>
<ul>
<li><font size="+1">donor roof section with ALL the
hardware</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">reciprocating saw</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">welder (we used a MIG set-up)</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">grinder</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">various screwdrivers and ratchets</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">patience</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font size="+1">Preparing the fiberglass top:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">After 20+ years of rain and sun exposure, the
fiberglass top may be in rough shape. It's definitely worth your
time to go ahead and recondition it now, while it's easy to access.
First, wash all the dirt, moss, and grime that cover it. Then,
wearing breathing protection, lightly sand the top. Finally, go to
a marine supply company, and get special fiberglass paint. Go ahead
and spend a few more dollars to get GOOD high-grade specialty
paint, as most other paints will just peel off. I found a quart
will do two coats, which will make your top very happy for years to
come.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Making new canvas:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The canvas tent material of the top may often
also be in bad shape. While you can purchase ready-made
replacements, if you wish to save money or create your own for
aesthetic reasons, it's easy. I had an old, large, camping tent,
which I used to make a new top out of. I took the old canvas out of
the top, and carefully cut it apart at the seams. I then traced
each piece on the tent, cut the new pieces, and sewed them
together. Voila! A new tent, with bigger windows, and a smaller
pricetag!</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">It can make all the difference between sleeping
3 people uncomfortably, and 4 people in the lap of luxury. Go for
it! Happy camping!</font></p>
