<h3>'68-'73 to '74-'79 Westfalia Pop Top Conversion</h3>
<p>by Jim O'Hara</p>
<hr size="2"/>
<p><font size="+1">From the <a href="http://www.bcn.net/~limbo/">LiMBO</a> newsletter "The Transporter"
v6 n3 June-July 94:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><u><i>Pop Top Replacement
Guide</i></u></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">(Arizona member Jim O'Hara sends this article
"covering" pop top swaps)</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">It is possible to exchange the old style pop top
(the one with the really uncomfortable cot) with the newer style
that has a large double bed. For comforts' sake it makes all the
difference in the world and pretty much maintains the stock look,
but it's not an easy job.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Before attempting this, I called just about
anybody I thought would know if this had been done before, only to
find that everyone had heard it could be done, but they didn't know
for sure. One guy even told me the easiest way was to chop off both
the roofs at the pillars and weld the new one on to the old one! I
decided the only way to find out for myself was to go to the
junkyard and look. Contrary to popular belief, the pre-'74 and
post-'74 pop tops do not have the same size roof holes and the
hinges are located at opposite ends of the bus. I figured I could
deal with these details and since I found a nice top with a decent
canvas I bought it. The rest of the job took several weeks and
probably 75 hours of labor, but just in case there are any other
masochists out there I'll outline the steps I followed for the rest
of the job:</font></p>
<ol>
<li><font size="+1">Find a top with a good canvas, seals and all
the necessary parts (including cushions). Take pictures of how
everything looks and works, and draw diagrams of everything that
looks like you might forget how it should go back together. Now is
the time to really think: "Is this worth the trouble?"</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Pick a nice day and plan to spend the entire
day at the junkyard. Make friends with the people that run the
junkyard because you will need help lifting off the new top and
moving it around. Remove the top and keep all the hardware and the
wooden boards that form the base of the bed. Keep track of where
all of those hundreds of nuts, bolts and screws came from.
Afterwards, study the roof of the bus you took the top off of. I
made a template with newspapers to locate the correct positions of
the holes for the hinges and the luggage rack. The top itself is
really heavy, you may want to brinig a pickup truck but I just
threw it on top of my bus, tied it down and drove away. You'll have
a fun ride back home.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Remove the folding support arms from the new
top and patch any holes in the canvas.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Remove your old top, saving all of the hardware
and the old seal. This requires removing all of the ceiling panels,
so I took the opportunity to refinish all of them and add some
insulation. I also removed the sink and fridge unit for extra
space. If you want to keep yours, you may have a problem with the
vent pipe getting in the way. Alternatively, you can install the
full interior from the donor bus if it had an intact
interior.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Use the templates to drill new holes in the
rear for the hinges. Put the new top on and attach the hinges. I
used plenty of washers on the inside to spread the stress some and
some on the outside to raise the whole top to add clearance. A milk
crate works well to hold the front up enough to get at the
hinges.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Attach the folding support arms to the
fiberglass roof and drill holes where they need to attach to the
bus roof, noting how much material is going to have to be ground
away to give them enough clearance. Scribe the area to be ground
away and get out the grinder. After cutting the metal, I bought
some plastic trim that goes on the edges of car doors, and put it
on the sharp edges. I lined the bottom of this area with some of
the rubber seal from my old top laid flat and glued down. Doesn't
look too bad.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Take off the metal arms (watch the springs)
that hook to the bottom of the folding supports to hold the top
closed. Shorten them with a hacksaw so they will hold the new top
down.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Lay out the metal pieces that hold the canvas
to the bus roof. Use a few of the screws and tape to temporarily
attach the canvas to the metal pieces. Mark the place on the roof
where they need to be and drill all of the holes. Don't really
screw it down yet.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Lay that big flat board on the rounded roof and
figure out how you are going to make a bed out of that! I did it by
cutting Styrofoam into the right shape to support the board and
then wrapping it with duct tape. Then I attached 6 hooks to the
board, one in each corner and two in the middle. I also attached 6
round eye bolts to the roof in corresponding locations and used
turnbuckles (available in different sizes at any hardware store) to
join them together. By tightening the turnbuckles you can adjust
the position of the big board to allow the roof to close. After a
lot of adjustments and hassles, I finally got it just right by
shoving the Styrofoam wedges in exactly the right places. There is
enough clearance that you don't have to cut the board. Then I
altered the front section of the bed by cutting the board a little
for clearance and changing the places where the brackets attach. In
order to make the big board even with the little board you have to
build little platforms about three inches high and attach them to
the roof. I made it up as I went along, but the final result is
that with the top down, the front board is in place (but not
locked) with the cushion off. After you open the top, you secure
the front board by locking it in alignment with the big board by
using two sliding bolt type locks (again from a hardware store) and
snapping the cushion on. If you are not using the bed but have the
top up, you simply fold the front board back over the big board out
of the way. This system works very well and is not as complicated
as it sounds.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">The front luggage rack is probably the hardest
part of the whole project. It is impossible to scribe correct
locations for the holes which the brackets mount to because the
fiberglass rack covers everything. I attached the brackets to the
rack with screws, and put glue on the bottom of the brackets where
it meets the roof. I put the rack in the right position and let the
glue dry. Then I carefully removed the screws and picked up the
rack, leaving the brackets glued in the right place. Then I drilled
my holes to permanently attach them. Easier said than done, you
might find a better way or use a template.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Seal up all the extra holes in the roof.
Silicone worked great for me. Contact lens wearers read and heed
the warning label on the tube. Silicone residue stays on your
finger for days and is a severe eye irritant. When you wash your
contact lenses, silicone gets on them and you will know
it!</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Connect the canvas to the roof using the 700
tiny screws.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font size="+1">It was a lot of tedious and time consuming work,
but worth it for me. The bed is plenty big enough for two and very
comfortable. It doesn't leak at all and since most of the parts
used are Westfalia, it looks fairly original. The hardest thing is
getting everything to fit under the top when it is folded down, as
there is considerably less clearance than the old one. Be creative
and you can find a solution.</font></p>
