<h3>Protecting Your VW</h3>
<h3>by Robert Kuhn</h3>
<hr size="2"/>
<p><font size="+1">If you've never had your VW stolen from you then
count your blessings. If you've ever had your bike stolen from you
when you were a kid, having your VW stolen feels 100 times worse.
When I had <b><font size="+1">my</font></b> Bug stolen, I went
through a range of emotions:</font></p>
<ul>
<li><font size="+1">Confusion ... "Is there where I parked
her?"</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Denial ... "No ... NO-NO! NO! NO! NO! NO!
NO!"</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">A state of high irkness (really ticked off!)
... (* LOTS OF POTTY MOUTHED LANGUAGE *)</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Hope ... "I'll find her!" .. or .. "The Police
will find her!"</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Acceptance ... "She's gone ..."</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font size="+1">You start to wonder if there was something that
you could've done to help prevent this. And that's what this page
was going to be about but then I started to think that it might
serve the opposite purpose; help someone break into a VW and make
off with it.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">This would be bad!</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">And thus I decided to just do an
editorial.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Since there is virtually no way to ensure that
your VW will never be broken into let alone stolen, at least within
the law, we can at least take some basic steps to help prevent your
car from being messed with.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The first thing that you have to rememeber is
that <b><font size="+1">IF SOMEONE WANTS TO GET IN YOUR CAR, THEY
WILL DO IT!</font></b> <b><font size="+1">IF SOMEONE WANTS TO MAKE
OFF WITH YOUR CAR, THEY WILL DO IT!</font></b> As sad as it sounds,
these are two givens that can be added to the other two givens in
life; death and taxes.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><img alt="blinking LED" class="img-responsive" height="28" hspace="4" src="../images/redblink.gif" vspace="4" width="28"/><b><font size="+1">Car alarms --</font></b> These are good investments, but don't
totally rely on them. A study was done a few years ago concerning
the alarm siren. The study group set off an alarm in a busy area
and no one paid attention to it. Probably because so many alarms
are false alarms that most people have turned a deaf ear towards
them.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Pretty sad, really. One feature of the alarm is
the panic mode where you can set the alarm off manually in the
event that you are in danger. I guess you can yell while the siren
is on.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">A good decent alarm shouldn't cost more than
your car. Don't be taken in by flashy pictures and logos on the
box. These are marketing tricks. If you take a peek at a <a href="http://www.clifford.com/">Clifford</a> box, it's pretty plain.
Most expensive also doesn't mean the best. I feel that a basic
alarm should have a decent shock sensor (a simple sensor that acts
very much like a tilt switch found in pinball machines ... when the
car is struck, it sets off the alarm) and ignition kill. <img align="right" alt="Stripped yellow Bug, rear view" class="img-responsive" height="237" hspace="10" src="../images/yelbug1.jpg" vspace="10" width="250"/>
Other nice items would be the ability to tie in electric locks and
windows ... my alarm will lock my doors when it's activated and
unlock the doors when I disarm the alarm. On the BMW, we did the
same thing and tied in the power windows so that it will close the
windows when armed. You can also program the alarm so that it rolls
up to a pre defined height in the event that you have to leave your
dog in the car.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Another nice item, but not needed, is a motion
sensor. We have this in our BMW. If the windows are open for
whatever reason, or if someone tries to gain access by the sunroof,
the minute they stick their arm inside the car, the motion sensor
(or radar) will catch it and trigger the alarm. This is a nice
feature if you have a convertible. I had this when I had a Fiat
Spyder.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Other nifty sensors include --</font></p>
<ul>
<li><font size="+1">Glass breakage; detects the sound of breaking
glass.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Voltage; detects when there's a drop in
voltage. Some thieves will actually drill a hole in the main car
battery to bypass the alarm. Others will simply snip the battery
wires. Some of your better alarms will have a hidden back up
battery for the alarm when this happens. Most of your alarms will
detect changes in the voltage. Sometimes a normal door pin which is
used to trigger the alarm will fail for whatever reason, but the
dome light will come on ... the alarm will take this as an
unauthorized entry.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Scamblers; Though this really isn't a sensor,
it's more of a jammer. Since 99.9% of all alarms are armed and
disarmed via radio freqs, someone got smart and used a scanner to
go through the various freqs until he found the right freq to
disarm the car. I believe that <a href="http://www.ungo.com/us/en/products/2007/ungo_security/index.html">Ungo</a>
was one of the first alarms that had a jammer which would jam
attempts to descramble its alarm.</font>
<p><font size="+1"><!-- Bad links 2007-01-28 - removed - mcr
            Clifford Electronics has a good <a href="http://www.clifford.com/scanners.html">description</a> as to how this is done.

            </font><p><font size=+1>
            <a href="http://www.clifford.com/acg.html">Code Grabbing</a> is the current trick being used by thieves today.
--></font></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><font size="+1">Some alarms offer paging which means that you
have to carry this pager with you and when the alarm is triggered,
it will page the pager. Though this is a nifty idea, the range is
limited and it still could be a false alarm. And if you already
carry a regular pager, you kinda look like a geek wearing two
pagers.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Most alarms also offer a valet mode. This is
somewhat useful ... we have it and I don't think I've ever really
used it even when I had my car valet parked.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><img align="left" alt="Car alarm siren" class="img-responsive" height="129" hspace="10" src="../images/siren.gif" vspace="10" width="120"/> Passive and active arming is good and bad. If
you're one of those people that forget to arm their alarm, then
this feature is for you. If you're like most of us, it's second
nature to arm the car. On some of your better alarms, there's a
timed delay which will automatically arm your car. The alarm in our
BMW does that. After X amount of minutes has passsed, it will
silently arm itself (doesn't chirp the alarm or flash the
lights).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">In conclusion, I still recommend that a car
alarm be purchased and installed by a professional. But I wouldn't
totally rely on them!</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Some car insurance companies will give you a
break if you have it professionally installed. Installing a basic
car alarm is about as easy as installing a car stereo. At least it
is for me. It's only when you start to add on all the nifty
features is where it gets complicated.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">A good decent/basic alarm is the Prestige alarm
by Audiovox.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Note -- Most alarms come with a pair of decals
which you are supposed to put on your window to tell everyone that
you have an "Acme Car Alarm". I discourage this. Some "Protected by
..." decals actually go to list what kind of alarm it is; "This car
protected by Acme Car Alarm". Some don't list the make/model of the
alarm, but the decal itself is sometimes all that is needed. The
reason I don't recommend that you use the supplied decals is
because that's all a thief needs to know. If he/she knows that you
have an Acme alarm, then they may already know how to bypass it. If
you feel that you need to advertise that you have an alarm, look
for a generic decal. I found some at my local Pep Boys. It said
"WARNING -- ALARM DEVICE" ... 'nuff said.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><img alt="blinking LED" class="img-responsive" height="28" hspace="4" src="../images/redblink.gif" vspace="4" width="28"/><b><font size="+1">The use of just a LED --</font></b> Though this will deter
some thieves, some just don't care and will still break into your
car.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><img alt="blinking LED" class="img-responsive" height="28" hspace="4" src="../images/redblink.gif" vspace="4" width="28"/><b><font size="+1">The Club --</font></b> This is a good device. It may not
protect your stereo, but at least it will help deter the thug from
making off with your car. Again, don't totally rely on this device.
If the thief really wants to make off with your car, he/she will
get past it. It's no secret that they will saw through the steering
wheel to remove the Club. The people that made the Club have
countered this by making "The Shield". Still, the Club is still a
good investment. It also makes a nice weapon when
needed.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The other day, as I was walking through the
parking lot of a large shopping mall, I spotted three cars that had
the Club, but they weren't installed! They were laying on the floor
and on the seat! It only takes a few seconds to install the Club!
So, if you have it or got it as a gift, <b><font size="+1">USE
IT!</font></b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><a href="http://www.geneberg.com/">Gene Berg
Eneterprises</a> makes a nifty locking shifter. This allows you to
lock the shifter with a key. This along with the Club makes the
thief think twice about making off with your car.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><img alt="blinking LED" class="img-responsive" height="28" hspace="4" src="../images/redblink.gif" vspace="4" width="28"/><b><font size="+1">"Lojack" --</font></b> In some states, "Lojack" is offered by
the local Police department. Though none of my friends have this
service, I have read a good deal about it. In a nut shell, the
Police installs a radio device somewhere on your car ... when your
car is reported stolen, the Police activate this homing device and
track the where abouts of the car. I have read many success
stories. The downside seems to be the price of the service. Some
say that it's not worth it. I think it's a neat idea and I think
that the costs are probably high because of the small number of
people that are using it.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><img alt="blinking LED" class="img-responsive" height="28" hspace="4" src="../images/redblink.gif" vspace="4" width="28"/><b><font size="+1">Common sense --</font></b> This is probably the most important
thing when it comes to protecting your car. If you have to park you
car in an area where you don't feel that it's safe, then it
probably isn't. Look for another area that you feel is safe.
Sometimes parking under a well lit area might not be a safe area,
this actually may draw attention to your car and make it easier for
the thieves to gain access. Parking in large structures are also
not safe. I find that it's best to park near one of the entrances
or where there are many cars around you. It's sort of along the
lines of "Safety in numbers". A friend of mine was so paranoid
about parking his car next to others because of fear of being
dinged that he parked his car away from the other cars in the
parking structure ... well, since it was parked away from the
others, it stood out and was broken into.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Lock your doors. I know this sounds stupid but
you'd be amazed at how many cars I see parked where the doors are
unlocked!</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Roll up the windows. Even an inch opening is all
that is needed in some cases to pop the door! If you're worried
about how hot it might get inside your car, buy a sun shade for the
window. These actually work! <img align="left" alt="Stripped yellow Bug, side view" class="img-responsive" height="206" hspace="10" src="../images/yelbug2.jpg" vspace="10" width="421"/> Don't leave things out in the
open that might tempt someone. Backpacks, briefcases and other
things (even a carbdboard box) that are in plain sight is all that
is needed to tempt someone. That sign that reads "DO NOT LEAVE
VALUABLES IN YOUR CAR" couldn't have been worded better!</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">If you are ever car jacked, let them have your
car! It's not worth it! Beware of those car jacking devices. I read
an article once about a security device which was supposed to
render the car useless after about 5 minutes. When the victim is
told to get out of the car, he/she activates said device ... the
car is driven off by the thief and after about 5 minutes, the car
stops and the thief is unable to restart the car and thus leaves
it.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"Hm", thinks I, "That sounds like a pretty neat
idea" until I read further when this particular device failed. This
poor woman got car jacked, she activated the device and the car
went about 30 yards before it stopped! After a few failed attempts
to restart the car, the car jacker got out and shot the lady and
then took off! According to the maker of the device, they were
unsure as to why the device failed.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">This was back in 1990 when I read this
article.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><!-- Bad links 2007-01-28 - removed - mcr
    Clifford makes a device called <a href="http://www.clifford.com/bljax.html">Black Jax</a> which is very much like the one I just mentioned.  With the experience that Clifford Electronics has, I would think that theirs works as advertised.
--></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The Bug that's featured on this page was not a
result of being broken into, but I have see Bugs where all that was
left was the body and pan! Mine was one of them. )c=</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Some of the many suggestions that I've read and
heard over the years (that has made me chuckle a bit) have
been:</font></p>
<ul>
<li><font size="+1">Rig up a bomb.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Electrify the car so the sucker gets
zapped!</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Rig up a time bomb that will explode at a later
time (like say 5 minutes after being stolen).</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Have hidden paint nozzles installed in the car
so that the thief is sprayed with this non-washable paint. Makes it
easier to track down said thief.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Leave a hungy Rotwieler, Doberman or Pit Bull
in the car.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Retinal verifcation. If the eyeball doesn't
match any of the predefined ones in the onboard computer's
database, the car blows up.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">If someone breakes into the car and doesn't
disarm the alarm by a certain time (say 1 minute), the car will
slam the doors shut, roll up all the windows, turn itself on and
with the aid of GPS, it will drive itself to the nearest Police
station. A pre-recorded message would then be played once the car
arrived at the Police station saying that the person(s) in the car
are to be booked. (this sort of has a RoboCop-ish theme to it, but
I liked it).</font></li>
