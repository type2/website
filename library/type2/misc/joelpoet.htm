<p class="c1">Klassical Po'try (for those of you who remember
English Literature, in its many forms ...)</p>
<p class="c1"><a name="1" id="1"><b>Depictus??</b></a><br>
by Billie Ernie Hindleg</p>
<p class="c1">Under the bus that carries me,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black as the grease on CV balls,<br>
I thank whatever gods may be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For my decrepit overalls.<br></p>
<p class="c1">Smudges from axles, loosely gripped;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have not flinched nor cried aloud<br>
As blood from my knuckles (socket slipped)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has colored the surface of this
shroud.<br></p>
<p class="c1">Above these spots and greasy smear<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are streak-ed paints of different shade<br>
And stains of ketchup, mustard, beer ...<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wear them proudly, unafraid.<br></p>
<p class="c1">It matters not how loud the gripe<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From friends or neighbors, wives, et al
...<br>
I will not wash, though they be ripe,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These funky stinking overalls.<br></p>
<hr>
<p class="c1">ok, how about another one? :) perhaps a bit more
elevated in subject matter?</p>
<p class="c1"><a name="2" id="2"><b>Elegy Written on a Country
Junkyard</b></a><br>
By Thomas Gray Metallic</p>
<p class="c1">The setting sun defines the end of day,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As doors and windows close against the
night,<br>
When tools and parts are left just where they lay,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For easy use tomorrow at first
light.<br></p>
<p class="c1">The cursing fades, the laughter ceases now,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In ones and twos, the men are gone
away.<br>
Old Sol is slow to take his final bow<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As insects tune themselves and start to
play.<br></p>
<p class="c1">It matters not the model nor the year<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor cost of purchase when the cars were
new,<br>
For like a graveyard, all will enter here<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To rust beneath the sun and morning
dew.<br></p>
<p class="c1">But there are some whose Karma reaches out<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To kindred souls, for help to cheat the
grave,<br>
And whether whole, or whether parted out,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Extend their lives upon the road they
crave.<br></p>
<p class="c1">For these, the kindred few, this yard is not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A place wherein their dread should make
them shy,<br>
Not like a graveyard, with decay and rot,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But more a warehouse, open to the
sky.<br></p>
<hr>
<p class="c1">and one of my favorites ... ;)</p>
<p class="c1"><a name="3" id="3"><b>Tales of the
Workshop</b></a><br>
by Robert W. Service-Advisor :)</p>
<p class="c1">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Rules</p>
<p class="c1">When they step up inside, as you go for a ride,<br>
And the first thing they see are the tools,<br>
Then they'll ask with a smirk if you do your own work,<br>
Cause they have no idea of The Rules.<br></p>
<p class="c1">For it's Tried and it's True: What you carry with
you<br>
Will help you get back; and it's certain<br>
What you leave back at home, as the country you roam,<br>
Will not help on the road when you're hurtin'.<br></p>
<p class="c1">As you go through the years, you will learn from your
tears<br>
All the tools you will need on the road,<br>
And you increase the weight, in attempts to cheat fate,<br>
Adding more and more tools to your load.<br></p>
<p class="c1">So the bus weighs a lot. Even more when you've
got<br>
All the spare parts your money can buy<br>
Hidden under the seat, stacked so careful and neat,<br>
In the hope Murphy's Law won't apply.<br></p>
<p class="c1">Now, it's sad, but in trucks, fuel economy sucks,<br>
And gets worse with all that piled aboard,<br>
But the point we make here is that gas ain't so dear;<br>
Don't let tools and spare parts be ignored.<br></p>
<p class="c1">But since Murphy still lives, and he seldom
forgives,<br>
No matter how much you have pleaded,<br>
The Rules make it plain, but we'll state it again:<br>
Carry with you whatever is needed.<br></p>

Klassical Po'try</p>
<p class="c1"><a name="4" id="4"><b>Jabberwagen</b></a><br>
by Screwloose Feral</p>
<p class="c1">Twas brilliant, and the propane stoves<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did frye and syzzle in the van;<br>
All sparkle were the splits and loaves<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the idle thoughts outran.<br></p>
<p class="c1">"Beware the Jabberwagen bus!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The rattles that ne'er cease their
speech!<br>
"Beware the Bus-Bus chorus line,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And listen not to what they
preach!"<br></p>
<p class="c1">He lifted up his greasley tools,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long time the irksome rattle sought ...<br>
Til slumbered he by the Half-Fast Tree<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And rested eyes in thought.<br></p>
<p class="c1">And as pretended he to sleep<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Jabberwagen squeaked again,<br>
Still certain of abilities<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To do its wants and when.<br></p>
<p class="c1">One, Two! Three, Four! And ratchet more!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hex-side socket felt his heft!<br>
And with the rattle dead and gone,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gathered up his tools and left.<br></p>
<p class="c1">"And hast thou silenced now the bus?"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They said as closer came he still;<br>
"Oh, Happy Day! Hot Damn! Hooray!"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then he handed them the bill.<br></p>
<p class="c1">Twas brilliant, and the propane stoves<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did frye and syzzle in the van;<br>
All sparkle were the splits and loaves<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the idle thoughts outran.<br></p>
<hr>
<p class="c1"><a name="5" id="5"><b>Mother Bus Rhymes</b></a></p>
<p class="c1">Jack and Jill went up the hill<br>
To test a Vee-Dub Syncro.<br>
Jill smashed trees, and just to tease,<br>
Crushed poor old Jackie's ego!<br></p>
<p class="c1">Hickory dickory dock,<br>
The chickens are all in a flock.<br>
My bus struck one, as it tried to run,<br>
The rest got away without injury.<br></p>
<p class="c1">This little bus went to market,<br>
This little bus stayed home,<br>
This little bus had premium fuel,<br>
This little bus had none,<br>
This little bus went Beep, Beep, Beep,<br>
All the way home.<br></p>
<p class="c1">Mary, Mary, quite contrary,<br>
How goes your Vanagon?<br>
With coolant leaks, and throttle tweaks,<br>
And a temp light that's always on!<br></p>
<p class="c1">Little Miss Muffet<br>
Sat on a tuffet<br>
Fixing her bus's fuel pump.<br>
Along came a spider<br>
And sat down beside her<br>
And said, "You gonna eat the rest of that donut?"<br></p>
<p class="c1">Jack Sprat, he wore a hat,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His wife, she wore blue jeans.<br>
They drove their Vee-Dub bus around<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just hoping to be seen.<br></p>
<p class="c1">As I was going to Spokane,<br>
I met a man with seven vans,<br>
In every van were seven seats,<br>
In every seat, a wife with feets,<br>
On every feets were socks and shoes<br>
Embroidered with the Daily News.<br>
Shoes, wives, seats, and vans,<br>
How many were going to Spokane?<br></p>
<hr>
<p class="c1"><a name="6" id="6"><b>Gunga Van</b></a><br>
by Junkyard Keepling</p>
<p class="c1">You can talk of being stuck<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you're sleeping in your truck<br>
In campgrounds with a water pipe that flows;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when you're way out here,<br>
'Neath the stars and sky so clear,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, it's something else again when
traction goes.<br>
Now in Arid-zona's clime,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where I used to spend my time<br>
On weekends off the road, in desert sand,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of all them off-road crew<br>
The finest one I knew<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was my old Volkswagen Camper, Gunga
Van.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was
"Van! Van! Van!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You
can make it, yes, you can!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Just
slip the clutch,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And
stick it into Low!!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You
blunt-nosed old Vee-Dub, Gunga Van."<br></p>
<p class="c1">The paint scheme that he had<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was really pretty bad,<br>
And less than what he needed, that's for sure.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But though he lacked for paint,<br>
In his engine, what there ain't<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were only things my money can't
procure.<br>
He was made of stronger stuff<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than that plastic modern fluff,<br>
And if a goat could make it, so could he.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I'd often see surprise<br>
In the young kids' widened eyes<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we puttered past them, stuck as they
could be!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was
"Van! Van! Van!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You're
not worth the sweat of Man!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Use
your grip, and grab the dirt!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't
sling it out behind!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You
worn-out rolling junkyard, Gunga Van."<br></p>
<p class="c1">But the steel can't stand too much<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the desert's tortured touch<br>
A'fore the metal gives it up and has to go.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, holed right through the case,<br>
We still made it back to base,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A'bleeding as we crawled along dead
slow.<br>
The damage, though severe,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looked worse out there than here;<br>
Still it's a cost to bear when'er I can.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And though he's dead for now,<br>
I'll build him back somehow,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I'll ride again in hell with Gunga
Van!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes,
Van! Van! Van!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You
faithful-hearted Gunga Van!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though
I beat you and I flayed you,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the
German steel that made you,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You're
a better bus than any, Gunga Van!<br></p>

<p class="c1">(last one. pay attention, kids .... there'll be a
quiz on Monday :)</p>
<p class="c1"><a name="7" id="7"><b>The Craven</b></a><br>
by Edgar Allenwrench NoMoe</p>
<p class="c1">Once upon a midnight frozen,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I drove the route I'd chosen,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sitting at the
wheel until my butt was sore,<br>
Suddenly, there came a tapping,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tapping, as if someone rapping,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rapping gently at
my sliding door.<br></p>
<p class="c1">"Tis the wind, " said I to me,<br>
"Tis the wind, and nothing more."<br></p>
<p class="c1">Onward through the night I traveled<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As my confidence unraveled,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of the
noise, the ill it bode.<br>
Was it just a stone in hubcap?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps an unrefastened gas cap?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or something worse
to break and leave me stranded on the road?<br></p>
<p class="c1">"Tis the wind," said I to me,<br>
"Tis the wind, and nothing more."<br></p>
<p class="c1">In the headlights, snow was falling,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still that tapping noise was calling,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calling all my
senses back from whence it came.<br>
Perhaps the cv joints need greasing,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And newer boots would make it pleasing.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, that's the
ticket! That's the one to blame.<br></p>
<p class="c1">"Tis the joints," I sagely muttered,<br>
"Tis the joints, and nothing more."<br></p>
<p class="c1">Then, as if it heard my speaking,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The noise was silent ... my ears still
seeking<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could find no trace
of what I'd heard before.<br>
On I drove, in silent waiting,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waiting for the noise, restating<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my mind the
causes I had thought ... and more.<br></p>
<p class="c1">"Tis my mind," said I to me,<br>
"Tis my mind, and nothing more."<br></p>
<p class="c1">Throughout the trip, no noise resounded,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But always now my thoughts are grounded<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the causes of
that noise I heard before.<br>
Like a shadow cast by sunlight,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My wraith-like fears will follow; and
might<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I, from out that
shadow, e'er be lifted?<br>

<p class="c1">Well, the hours went by, til the closing drew
nigh,<br>
And the owner grew twitchy and nervous.<br>
So he spoke to the boss, as he now was quite cross,<br>
And inquired 'bout the length of his service.<br></p>
<p class="c1">"Well, it shoulda been through," said the boss
through his chew,<br>
"And I don't know what's taking so long."<br>
So they walked through the door to the shop's working floor<br>

<p class="c1">Then the bus owner paid for the work that had
made<br>
All his broken parts mended again,<br>
And he happily drove to his home in the grove<br>
With no thought of the missing repairmen.<br></p>
<p class="c1">So the boss never knew what had taken his crew<br>
From their jobs, which they left and deserted,<br>

know that lots of famous people wrote musicals about buses and vw's
and such..unfortunately, none were ever made into productions that
we get to see. however, some were adapted to less interesting
subjects and became instant hits. one such example is The Sound of
Music, which was a watered-down version of the original The Sound
of Mufflers, a musical about a southern german family who invented
volkswagens and drove them around the Alps, bringing joy and
happiness to the people of the region. never made it into
production. change the central character from a Calamity Jane type
of mechanic/inventer to some frilly nanny, throw in some love
interest and a few nasty Nazi's and it became a box-office
smash.</p>

I spied an old geezer beside of the highway,<br>
A pack on his back and his thumb in the air.<br></p>
<p class="c1">There was something about him that gathered my
notice,<br>
A something familiar, and yet still unseen,<br>
A spirit so kindred, I felt in a moment<br>
That here but for god's grace was easily me.<br></p>
<p class="c1">I pulled to the shoulder and waved to him
friendly,<br>
He walked to the bus and he slowly got in.<br>
I asked, "Where you headed?" He answered, "Out that way.<br>
"And I'm later than usual," he said with a grin.<br></p>
<p class="c1">In talking while riding, he told a sad story<br>
Of trading two morrows for one yesterday,<br>
And then he admitted that he once had buses,<br>
And like his tomorrows, they faded away.<br></p>
<p class="c1">"I once had a camper, a nice sixty-seven,<br>
A neat little Microbus rolling along.<br>
But the wife and I split up, I needed some money,<br>
So I sold it to strangers for nearly a song."<br></p>
<p class="c1">"My fortunes rebounded a year or so later,<br>
But by then the buses lost most of their charm.<br>
Still I bought me a Breadloaf and learned that I love it,<br>
For it still was a Bus and could do me no harm."<br></p>
<p class="c1">"After that, there were others, in lengthy
succession.<br>
A Vanagon camper I had for a while;<br>
A Pickup, a Kombi, a Double-door Panel ...<br>
I had always thought I'd be riding in style."<br></p>
<p class="c1">"But fortunes and favors don't stay long at my
house.<br>
They find better lodging with others some day.<br>
When I lost all my money, my job, and my buses,<br>
That's when I packed up to try traveling this way."<br></p>
<p class="c1">"As the years added to me, I wandered the
country,<br>
Searching and seeking and moving along.<br>
Unsure of the way that my destiny pulled me,<br>
I changed my direction like changing my song."<br></p>
<p class="c1">He talked for a long time to tell his life's
story,<br>
I listened intently to his sad refrain,<br>
For his tale was spell-binding, no matter the sadness,<br>
And he spoke as if knowing he'd rebound again.<br></p>
<p class="c1">My exit came up as we rode down the highway<br>
So I pulled to the shoulder and bid him farewell.<br>
He thanked me profusely and wouldn't take money<br>
And waved at me til I had turned down the dell.<br></p>
<p class="c1">And as I was driving, my home road returning,<br>
His last words were ringing around in my brain:<br>
"Enjoy this nice bus for as long as you have it,<br>
You just never know if you'll have one again."<br></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this new land, her new home.<br></p>
<p class="c1">There she sat, among the rusting<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bones of cars from Yesterday,<br>
Left alone and here abandoned,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waiting for her dying day.<br></p>
<p class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh,
my darling, oh, my darling,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, my darling
Clementine,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will soon be
lost forever,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Awful sorry,
Clementine.<br></p>
<p class="c1">Years ago, she took a family<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Way out West and way back home;<br>
Never once had any problems,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the countryside they'd
roam.<br></p>
<p class="c1">But the family grew much bigger<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than poor Clementine could hold,<br>
So they sold their loyal camper<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a measly bag of gold.<br></p>
<p class="c1">There she sat, out in the weather,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the dealer's used car lot,<br>
Through the snows of winters freezing,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the summers burning hot.<br></p>
<p class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh,
my darling, oh, my darling,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, my darling
Clementine,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You were sold and
left abandoned,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Awful sorry,
Clementine.<br></p>
<p class="c1">No one looked or asked about her,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the dealer didn't care,<br>
So he sold her to the junkyard<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And for years she's been out there.<br></p>
<p class="c1">Then one day, there came a youngster<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking for some parts to buy,<br>
Saw her rusted, faded body,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bought her from the junkyard guy.<br></p>
<p class="c1">Towed her home and started fixing,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking time to do it right;<br>
Worked a long time on her engine,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stayed up late into the night.<br></p>
<p class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh,
my darling, oh, my darling,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, my darling
Clementine,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You were lost but
now I've found you,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not to worry,
Clementine.<br></p>
<p class="c1">Brand new tires, and brand new braking,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stop the rust, renew the paint,<br>
Rid the field mice from the cabinets,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cause a Mouse Hotel she ain't!<br></p>
<p class="c1">Mend the canvas, and the fixtures,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make the pop-top work just fine.<br>
When she's finished, she'll be pretty,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Beauty Queen, my Clementine.<br></p>
<p class="c1">Now she rides upon the highway,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just like when she was brand new,<br>
With a grin between her headlights,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And she purrs, like kittens do.<br></p>
<p class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh,
my darling, oh, my darling,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, my darling
Clementine,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You were almost
gone forever,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now you're fixed
and you're all mine!<br></p>

<p class="c2">Big Joe</p>
<p class="c1">It was a dark and stormy night. The wind howled like
a love-sick dog, as the rain beat a nervous staccato on the
windshield. The tires on the road made an angry hissing sound,
trying to keep my little bus securely on the asphalt. The wipers
strained and moaned against the flood, pushing one way and then
another. The road could barely be seen in the dim glow of my
headlights. I hadn't see it this bad in many years.</p>
<p class="c1">As i rounded a curve, my headlights reflected off the
back of an 18-wheeler driving slowly ahead of me. I slowed down and
kept back from his trailer, wishing to avoid the spray from his
wheels. I could see the lights clearly and the large letters on one
rear door, spelling "Big Joe" with a cartoon character underneath.
The sight of this made me laugh and cheered me considerably.</p>
<p class="c1">Driving behind the truck was much easier, as his big
tires moved most of the water out of the way. And I soon learned to
trust his instincts as he braked for curves or swung wide for large
puddles or fallen rocks.</p>
<p class="c1">We drove on for what seemed like several hours, until
the rain began to slacken and the wind died to just a steady
breeze. The truck began to pick up a little speed, so I tagged
right along behind.</p>
<p class="c1">We hadn't seen any other traffic in either direction
since I met up with the truck, and pretty soon, I could see the
lights of a truck stop ahead. I decided a cup of coffee would be
just about perfect right now, so I pulled into the parking lot.
"Big Joe" hit a couple of blasts on his air horns and kept rolling
down the road. I guess he had known I was back there, after
all.</p>
<p class="c1">It was still drizzling as I made my way into the
coffee shop, so I got a little wet. The smell of the food
brightened my spirits. The folks sitting around inside looked at me
a bit more than curiously, however, and I asked the waitress about
it when she came over.</p>
<p class="c1">"Oh," she said, as she poured my cup of coffee,
"They're just surprised that you made it through in this weather.
Highway 41 has been closed now since three o'clock."</p>
<p class="c1">"Well," I replied, "I'd have never made it if it
hadn't been for that trucker, Big Joe."</p>
<p class="c1">And with that, she dropped the coffee pot, smashing
the glass on the floor and spraying hot coffee all over her legs
and my feet. Her face was the color of the napkins, and her eyes
were the size of half-dollars.</p>
<p class="c1">"I'm sorry," I said, trying to wipe as much of the
coffee off my shoes as I could. I looked around at the other folks
in the coffee shop and they looked pretty much the same as she
did.</p>
<p class="c1">"I'm sorry," I repeated, "Did I say something
wrong?"</p>
<p class="c1">By this time, another waitress had recovered and
brought a broom and a mop to clean up the mess. "No," she said,
"It's just that we haven't heard anything about Big Joe in a long
time. He's dead, you see. Years ago, he was leading some cars down
the road, in a storm just about like the one tonight, when a rock
slide carried him and his truck over the edge and down to the river
at the bottom."</p>
<p class="c1">This time, I was the one who dropped the coffee.</p>
<hr>
<p class="c1"><a name="21" id="21"><b>another story for All
Hallow's Eve .... :)</b></a><br></p>
<p class="c2">An Old Tale from the Deep South</p>
<p class="c1">It was a dark and stormy night. The strobing flashes
of lightening darkened the already deepening shadows inside the old
Volkswagen camper. The flames of the small campfire flickered, like
the tongues of snakes, as the soft moaning of the wind increased.
The trees bent over the campsite, their limbs draped in Spanish
moss like old scarecrows in the tattered remnants of clothing long
gone out of style.</p>
<p class="c1">The little camper rocked slightly in the wind. The
old fellow at the gas station hadn't mentioned any storm. He only
spoke about how this campground was haunted by the spirit of Jean
Pierre Bapaume, one of the original explorers of this area, who
accompanied Iberville on his trek through the swamps of Louisiana,
Mississippi, and lower Alabama. Somehow the story didn't seem quite
so laughable out here in the dark.</p>
<p class="c1">What was it he had said? Bapaume had been hung by the
others from one of these very trees, and swore vengenance on any
who dared seek refuge here? The old fellow never did say exactly
what it was that Bapaume had done to deserve hanging.</p>
<p class="c1">I looked at my watch. It was nearly midnight. I
hadn't realized it was so late ... the sky seemed strangely light,
almost like twilight. Suddenly, out of the corner of my eye, I saw
an armadillo walk out of the bushes along the road and head
straight for the fire and me. I threw a rock in its direction, but
it kept coming. As it reached the light of the fire, its eyes
glowed greenish-yellow, and their gaze seemed fixed upon me.</p>
<p class="c1">"Are you to be here when Jean comes?" The voice
startled me, a high-pitched squeaking voice, with a terrible
accent. I stood up from my lawn chair and looked around, wishing I
had brought some sort of weapon. There was no one. Only the
armadillo and myself. Then the armadillo stood on its hind legs,
looked straight at me, and the voice again said, "Are you to be
here when Jean comes?". It was the armadillo speaking.</p>
<p class="c1">I stared at him for a few seconds, then decided the
storm and the beer were playing tricks on my mind. I threw a beer
can and hit the armadillo on the snout ... he vanished. No smoke.
No noise. No nothing. He just wasn't there anymore. The beer can
went right through him ... or rather, where he had been ... and
rattled down the dirt road.</p>
<p class="c1">Now I was sweating. I got the flashlight and walked
around the campfire, shining the light on the dirt, looking for
tracks of some sort. There was nothing there. No sign that anything
had walked over that ground in the last two hundred years. I didn't
like this turn of events. I looked at my watch... it was exactly
midnight. The wind was now only a soft whisper in the trees,
stirring the tatters of the Spanish moss.</p>
<p class="c1">I turned off the flashlight and started to walk back
to the camper, when I noticed a rather large possum, sprawled out
in my lawnchair. Like some bloated lifeguard at the beach, but with
eyes that were glowing red in the firelight. His eyes flickered
somehow, as if glowing from within instead of reflecting the light
of the campfire.</p>
<p class="c1">"Are you to be here when Jean comes?" The voice was
deeper than before, but the accent was just as bad. It was
definitely the possum speaking ... I could see his mouth move as he
struggled with the English words. And he shifted his weight in the
chair as he gestured with one of his forelegs.</p>
<p class="c1">He apparently took my shocked demeanor to be
misunderstanding, so he repeated his sentence, pausing slowly at
each word, and speaking louder than before. I swallowed, and
replied, "What do you mean?"</p>
<p class="c1">"I wish to know you still be here, when Jean comes",
he croaked. "Jean do not like you to camp here. Jean do not like
people at all." As he said this, a twisted sneer of a smile played
upon his features. If a possum can smile, that is.</p>
<p class="c1">Geez, I thought, now I'm talking to a possum in the
swamps of Alabama! How old was that beer? I picked up a stick and
walked around the campfire, intending to defend my lawnchair, when
the possum just faded out of view. He hadn't run away, or even
moved ... he just faded out of sight. I carefully felt all over the
chair, but there was no warmth, no smell, no hair, no nothing. Only
me, the crackling of the fire, and the whispering of the wind.</p>
<p class="c1">"Are you be here for Jean?" This voice was deep, very
deep. My spine grew goosebumps the size of golfballs. The voice was
behind me, on the other side of the fire. I looked at the windows
of the camper, to see any reflection of what was speaking, but
there was nothing reflecting but me, the fire, and the woods
beyond. I turned slowly around.</p>
<p class="c1">An alligator, about ten feet long, was lying on his
side, picking his teeth with a claw. He looked at me with bright
blue-green eyes that seemed to steal all your willpower to resist.
I looked away quickly and stared at the fire. The gator raised up
on his rear legs, and sort of sat there, using his tail as a prop.
His pale white belly glistened in the firelight.</p>
<p class="c1">"I mean," he said, "Do you stay til Jean comes?"</p>
<p class="c1">"Man, if you ain't Jean, I'm GONE!!" I shouted over
my shoulder as the Land Speed Record was broken by a 1971
Volkswagen Campmobile.</p>
<p class="c1">I don't drink much anymore. I don't camp at places
without at least three other campers there ahead of me. And I NEVER
stay up past ten o'clock.</p>

"He ain't home right now.<br>
He's out a'driving on the road<br>
In that Vee-Dub bus, The Cow."<br></p>
<p class="c1">So I took myself and headed home,<br>
Along the coastal road,<br>
When who'd I see, but that old Joe,<br>
On the shoulder where he'd whoa'd!<br></p>
<p class="c1">Old Joe was back behind the bus,<br>
A'poking round the rear,<br>
He had that engine hatch propped up<br>
And was pouring something clear.<br></p>
<p class="c1">I stopped in front and walked on back<br>
To see if he was broke,<br>
But he had close the engine hatch<br>
And was sipping on a Coke.<br></p>
<p class="c1">He said he couldn't stop to talk,<br>
Important was his quest,<br>
With miles to go before he quits<br>
For dinner and a rest.<br></p>
<p class="c1">He pulled out in the traffic lanes<br>
And hurried up to speed,<br>
I tagged along behind his bus ...<br>
Some help he might yet need.<br></p>
<p class="c1">In about ten miles, he stopped again,<br>
And behind the bus he'd go,<br>
Where he pulled that same old pouring stunt,<br>
On what, I didn't know.<br></p>
<p class="c1">Then off he'd roar, back on the road<br>
For another ten miles more,<br>
Where he would stop and run around<br>
Behind the bus to pour.<br></p>
<p class="c1">He kept this up back to the house,<br>
Where he called out to his wife,<br>
Who came on out and walked right back<br>
To the engine with a knife!<br></p>
<p class="c1">She poked inside, then poked some more,<br>
And then she said, "I'll bet<br>
You need once more around the block ...<br>
The turkey ain't done yet." :)<br></p>

fading,<br>
As the darkness was growing in the shadows' deep shading,<br>
The work wasn't going as well as expected<br>
So his spirits were down, he was feeling dejected.<br></p>
<p class="c1">And the shortcuts he'd taken, although he knew
better,<br>
Were quicker than following rules to the letter.<br>
A new regulator, to make headlights brighter,<br>
A simple replacement: screws loosened, then tighter.<br></p>
<p class="c1">A slip of the fingers, and down it was dropped,<br>
To hit on the chassis and there was it stopped.<br>
A spark, bright as lightening; then, to his surprise,<br>
That great big red wire disappeared fore his eyes.<br></p>
<p class="c1">At first it just glowed, then got brighter and
brighter,<br>
As part of his body grew tighter and tighter.<br>
It was gone in a second, a foul puff of smoke,<br>

Christmas</b></a><br></p>
<p class="c1">'Twas the night before Christmas, and all round the
house,<br>
Not a Vee-Dub was running, I felt like a louse.<br>
The stockings were hung by the chimney with care<br>
In hopes that St. Wolfsburg soon would be there.<br></p>
<p class="c1">The children were nestled all snug in their beds<br>
While visions of Campers danced round in their heads.<br>
And Mama in her flannel and I in mine, too,<br>
Thought a cross-country bus tour was a neat thing to do,<br></p>
<p class="c1">When, out on the lawn, there arose such a
clatter,<br>
Like sounds of a bad clutch; you know how they chatter;<br>
Away to the window I flew like a flash,<br>
I loosened the locks and threw open the sash,<br></p>
<p class="c1">And what to my wondering eyes did appear,<br>
But a Volkswagen bus, of the earlier years,<br>
With a little old driver, so pudgy and round,<br>
That I knew in a moment St. Wolfsburg I'd found.<br></p>
<p class="c1">And pulling the Bus, through the snow and the
cold,<br>
Was an octet of Beetles, so proud and so bold.<br>
More rapid than turtles, they strained as they came,<br>
And he yelled and he screamed and he called them by name,<br></p>
<p class="c1">"Now, Sunroof, now Oval, now Super, and Sunbug,<br>
On, Verti, on, Kuebel, on, Karmann, and Goldbug,<br>
To the top of the carport, to the top of the wall,<br>
Drive away, drive away, drive away all!!"<br></p>
<p class="c1">So up to the rooftop this convoy then flew,<br>
The Bus full of car parts and the Beetles were, too.<br>
As I drew in my head and was turning around,<br>
From the chimney St. Wolfsburg came out with a bound.<br></p>
<p class="c1">He was dressed as mechanics, from his head to his
foot,<br>
And he reeked of old motor oil and ashes and soot.<br>
A huge bunch of car parts he had stuffed in his sack<br>
Marked VeeDub and Bosch ... I was taken aback!<br></p>
<p class="c1">His face was all wrinkled, his eyes so dejected,<br>
Like parts that he'd ordered were more than expected.<br>
His feet were all covered with oil, which was dripping<br>
All over my carpet where he had been tripping.<br></p>
<p class="c1">He was rotund and jolly, a competent mech,<br>
But my room now was filthy, a horrible wreck.<br>
He spoke not a word but went straight to his work,<br>
With his butt-crack all showing, like some plumber, the
jerk!<br></p>
<p class="c1">Then putting his finger aside of his nose,<br>
With a wink and a nod, up the chimney he rose.<br>
He sprang to his Bus, fixed his seatbelt, and farted,<br>
Then hit the ignition and up they all started.<br></p>
<p class="c1">He pushed in the clutch, shifted gears with a
grinding,<br>
They all started moving, their engines were winding,<br>
But I heard him exclaim 'ere he drove round the side,<br>

<p class="c1">Strange tales are told, 'bout the Winter's cold,<br>
In Volkswagen buses so true,<br>
When the wind's fierce howl drowns the tranny's growl<br>
And there ain't enough heat for you.<br>
When that very same wind is trying to bend<br>
The steering wheel out of your hand<br>
And your muscles all ache when you step on the brake<br>
To slow the Velocity Van.<br>
With the numbness that spread from your butt to your head<br>
'Cause the feelings gone out of your toes,<br>
And you're wondering where, in that junk pile back there,<br>
Are those warmer and woolier clothes.<br></p>
<p class="c1">For the three hundredth time, you receite the
rhyme<br>
And the reason that caused you to go<br>
On this journey through land made dead, white, and bland<br>
By the hands of Ol' Winter and Snow.<br>
But you arrive there on time, in the arctic-like clime,<br>
And relate to them all of the pain<br>
Of the bone-chilling cold, and the driver so bold<br>
To have beaten Ol' Winter again.<br>
Through the window you stare at the bus parked out there,<br>
Covered now all over with snow;<br>
And next time, for sure, you swear now to cure<br>
Those heater boxes down there below!<br></p>

<p class="c1">Believe It ... or Don't Department<br>
Willy "Bill the Bard" Shakesbeer drove a vw bus!<br></p>
<p class="c1">Shall I compare thee to the summer's days?<br>
Nah, for thou art too ugly and too fat;<br>
No lines of grace nor speed thy form displays,<br>
More like the Snail, with speed akin to that;<br>
But when the showers of April are forgot,<br>
And darling buds of May do grace the land,<br>
Are thoughts of camping given rein to trot<br>
Within the wintered hearts and minds of Man,<br>
For it is then thy use belies thy form,<br>
As catepillar turns to butterfly,<br>
From cargo's bus to camper's little dorm,<br>
You turn whenever weekends happen by.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So long as campers camp, from sea to sea,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So lives a Bus, and those who camp with
thee.<br></p>

<p class="c1">When, in this race of Fortune and men's lies,<br>
I often sit alone and contemplate ...<br>
Where might I be, had I been much more wise<br>
In choice of cars with which to link my fate?<br>
What might I drive to work, to play, to cope<br>
In rageous traffic, more than some can bear,<br>
Were I to let someone decree my scope<br>
In what to drive, to say, or clothes to wear?<br>
How more in profit might my time be spent<br>
Than nursemaid to some broken old auto?<br>
A smile replaces brow with troubles bent<br>
As to the wheel I climb and off I go ...<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And though my drives through rolling country
end,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I love this bus, this one that makes me
grin.<br></p>

Evening</b></a><br>
by Robert Frostbitten<br></p>
<p class="c1">Whose bus this is I think I know.<br>
His home is 'cross the river though;<br>
He will not mind me stopping here<br>
To watch his bus be topped with snow.<br></p>
<p class="c1">My little bus must think it queer<br>
To stop each time we get so near<br>
To other buses that we see<br>
Parked at the malls or stores, like here.<br></p>
<p class="c1">Its little engine idles rough<br>
To ask if I have had enough.<br>
The only other sound I hear<br>
Is wiper blades on snowy fluff.<br></p>
<p class="c1">His bus is lovely, clean and bright,<br>
A pleasing note of all that's right.<br>
But I have traffic still to fight,<br>
And miles to go this winter's night.<br></p>

<p class="c1">How do I drive thee? Let me count the ways.<br>
I drive thee to the length and breadth and height<br>
My bumpers reach, when feeling, not by sight,<br>
For the ends of other Cars in parking space.<br>
I drive thee by the headlights glowing trace<br>
At Dusk, and Dawn, and yawning dead of Night.<br>
I drive thee slowly, in the lanes upon the Right;<br>
I drive thee quickly, when in Rushing Hour's Race.<br>
I drive thee for the passion, somewhat loose<br>
Like comfy briefs, that will restore my faith.<br>
I drive thee with a verve I seldom choose<br>
In other cars! -- I drive thee for the Smiles<br>
And Tears and all the Strife --- and if I choose,<br>
I shall but drive thee more, for years and miles.<br></p>

A'steering my bus and just singing this song,<br>
When what on my dashboard should sudden appear,<br>
But a green-looking Santa with tiny green deer.<br></p>
<p class="c1">So I says to this Santa, "Here, aren't you quite
wrong?"<br>
"You're all the wrong color, and Christmas has gone."<br>
To which he replied, "Son, just lend me your ear ...<br>
And if you have got one, could you give me a beer?"<br></p>
<p class="c1">Well, I had just a six-pack, right there on the
seat,<br>
So I gave him one quickly; he finished it neat.<br>
Then he sat back, and burped once, then burped once again,<br>
And he started to tell me this sad, sad refrain.<br></p>
<p class="c1">Of how, in the world of the Fairies and Witches,<br>
The tele had put them in serious stitches,<br>

So half of the Fairies were off on relief.<br></p>
<p class="c1">And one of them who was just laid off last week<br>
Was the Leprechaun fellow with the green little cheek,<br>
So now Santa's working on St. Paddy's Day,<br>

<p class="c1">"But I've not got it right yet", he said with a
frown,<br>
"This gold pot malarkey is wearing me down.<br>
"The people are chasing, and grabbing, and snatching,<br>
"And they hope that it's me that they'll soon be
a'catching."<br></p>
<p class="c1">Then he sighed, and he got up, and went to his
sleigh,<br>
Said, "Thanks for the beer, but I'm off on my way."<br>
Then he poofed out of sight, as he said with a sneer,<br>
"To all a good night, and to all a green beer!".<br></p>
