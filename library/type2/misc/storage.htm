<h3>Storage</h3>
<p>by Bruce Anderson</p>
<hr size="2"/>
<p><font size="+1">PORSCHE STRASSE'S Bruce Anderson picked up on a
message from CompuServe forum member Eric S. Shea about winter
storage for his 911:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I am not really much of an expert on storing car
because I live in California where we really don't store cars.
Because I continue to get questions about storage I have gathered a
bunch of information from various different sources.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The best way to store your car for the winter is
to fill the tank with gasoline just before you put it away. Change
the oil and filter as well just before putting the car away for the
winter. Either put the car up on blocks just so the tires miss
touching the ground or over inflate the tires to about fifty psi.
during the storing period. Remove the battery from the car and put
it on a piece of wood in a dry warm place and put it on a trickle
charger for the duration of the storage. When you take the car out
of storage drive the car enough to use the gasoline that it has
been stored with over a fairly short period of time and change the
oil and filter again. This should be within a week or so of
removing the car from storage. If the car is going to be stored for
longer periods of time other precautions are required.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Porsche recently put out a technical bulletin on
storage of used Porsches:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Technical Bulletin:</b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">In order to address customer
inquiries</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">If the vehicle remains in storage for more than
3 months, remove spark plugs and disconnect coil wire(s) from
distributor cap(s). Ground the coil wire(s) using jumper
cable(s).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Squirt 3-5cm of engine oil into each combustion
chamber.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Reinstall spark plugs and torque to 25-30 Nm
(18-22 ft. Ibs.).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Do not connect spark plug wires. Crank engine
for 5-8 seconds. Do not operate gas pedal.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Connect spark plug and coil wires.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Do not operate engine until vehicle is put back
in service.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Seal the air intake ducts and the muffler
tailpipe using towels or tape.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Windshield/Headlight Washer: Check and correct
antifreeze/cleaning solution level as necessary.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Electric: The battery should be removed from the
vehicle and stored in a cool and dry place, not on a cement floor.
Recharge battery every 3 months. If the battery remains in the
vehicle with cables connected, it is necessary to check, remove and
recharge the battery every 2-3 weeks.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Do not fast charge batteries. Refer to Technical
Bulletin Group 2, Number 8801 for charging information.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Vehicle Interior: The interior must be dry,
especially in the area of the floor carpets. The use of drying
agents (Silica-Gel) is recommended in vehicles with leather
interior and in areas with high humidity. The recommended amount is
3 fabric bags of 500 grams each placed on the floor
carpets.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Windows, doors, lids and top must be
closed.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">On cars with manual heating/ventilation systems,
air flaps should be open.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Brakes and shifting: Brake discs and brake pads
should be completely dry to prevent corrosion. Do not apply hand
brake.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Engage a gear on cars with manual transmission
to move the shift rod all the way into the transmission to prevent
shift rod corrosion.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Vehicles stored outdoors in direct sunlight:
Precautions should be taken to prevent sunlight from entering the
car's interior. Cover windshield, door, side and rear
glass.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Putting vehicle in service: Remove intake duct
and tailpipe sealing. Check for nesting creatures under the hood
and evidence of fluid leaks under the car.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Install battery. Start engine.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Do not depress the accelerator pedal. Do not run
engine at high RPM during warm up.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Should the engine not start after two starting
attempts, remove spark plugs and check for oil deposits. If
necessary, clean or replace spark plugs.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Caution: Do not crank engine with spark plugs
removed.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Switch on A/C at idle RPM and check state of
charge. Correct if necessary.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Adjust tire pressure to specified
pressure.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Caution: Brakes may not have the highest
possible braking efficiency after long storage. Apply brakes
several times at low road speed.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Often there are people who specialize in
preparing cars for winter storage and the storing of cars. I'm not
sure about your area, but I know several people in the east that
offer the service to their customers.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Here is the stuff that I send people that ask
about storing a car in the winter. Keeping the tank full during
storage is a good place to start. You should use unleaded fuel in
preference to a leaded fuel because it is less likely to gum-up.
Fill gas tank and put a can of Sta Bil in the tank to stabilize the
gas during storage. (Sta Bil is available at marine and lawnmower
shops.) Also you need to be careful that you don't use any of the
fuels that have alcohol bearing additives in the gasoline because
gasoline, water and alcohol do not mix. You have to be careful of
gasohol or gasoline with alcohol use as an octane enhancer, these
are now sold in 45 states. Because of the problems caused by mixing
alcohol with gasoline there are now companies producing additives
to protect cars from the use fuels with alcohol in them. If you
live in a state that uses alcohol in the gasoline you should look
into one of these additives, "Alcohol Protector" by Gold Eagle Co.
4400 So. Kildare, Chicago, IL 60632. Fuels containing alcohol have
the ability to absorb moisture from the air. Once the alcohol
absorbs water to its maximum, about 1%, a phenomenon known as phase
separation can occur. The risk is thaing storage of their Porsche,
the following information can be made available to them.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Clean vehicle thoroughly inside and
outside.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Clean engine and engine compartment.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Under carriage and chassis components should be
free of dirt and salt deposits.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">If required, apply cosmoline to under
carriage.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Caution: Do not apply cosmoline to brake system
components.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Fuel Tank: Fill up fuel tank.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Tires: Increase the tire pressure to 4 bars
(58psi). It is not recommended to lift the vehicle, due to the
possibility of corrosion on shock absorber pistons.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The vehicle should be moved slightly,
approximately every 4 weeks, to prevent flat spots on the
tires.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Climate Control: The air conditioning system
should be in good working condition and fully charged.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Engine, water-cooled: Check antifreeze
concentration and correct if necessary.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Engine:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Change oil and filter. Run engine for several
minutes.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Spray cold engine with corrosion inhibitor. (Do
not spray it on the exhaust system or belts.) t the water and
alcohol mixture can get trapped in some fuel injection systems and
cause corrosion or gum things up.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">When you put your cars away for the winter you
should start by cleaning them thoroughly inside and out and waxing
the outside finish, and putting Vaseline on the wheels, then fill
the tanks with gasoline just before you put them away. Change the
oil and oil filter as well just before putting the car away for the
winter. Either put the car up on blocks just so the tires just
barely miss touching the ground or over inflate the tires to about
fifty eight psi. during the storing period. The vehicle should also
be moved slightly once a month to prevent flat spotting the tires.
Remove the battery from the car and put it on a piece of wood in a
dry warm place and put it on a trickle charger for the duration of
the storage. The air conditioning system should be in good working
condition and fully charged. Seal up the air intake ducts and the
tail pipe using towels and tape. The heater ducts under the car
should also be sealed up to prevent rodents form interring the car
through the heater. Windows, doors, lids and top must be closed. Do
not apply hand brake.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">When you take the car out of storage remember to
remove intake duct, tail pipe heater vent sealing. Drive the car
enough to use the gasoline that it has been stored with over a
fairly short period of time and change the oil and filter again.
This should be within a week or so of removing the car from
storage.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Switch on A/C at idle RPM and check state of
charge. Correct if necessary.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Adjust tire pressure to specified
pressure.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Caution: The brakes may not work properly after
long storage. Apply the brakes several times at low road speed to
make sure that they work.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">A May 1984 column in the Panorama also dealt
with car storage and referenced an earlier column by Roger Chaney
printed in the August 1967 Panorama which also dealt with winter
car storage. Usually a good source of information on storage of
engines will be your local sport boat or private airplane dealers
and service centers. A great number of boats and private airplanes
are stored for part of the year each year.</font></p>
