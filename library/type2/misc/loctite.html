LOCTITEï¿½ Product 2041 is a high fluorescence, low odor, low
viscosity single component anaerobic threadlocking material which
develops medium to high strength. The product cures when confined
in the absence of air between close fitting metal surfaces and is
particularly suitable for wicking into preassembled components.
Because of its low viscosity and capillary action, the product
wicks into porosity and eliminates the need to disassemble.</td>
