<h3>Air Conditioned Bus</h3>
<h3>by David Schwarze</h3>
<hr size="2"/>
<p><font size="+1">I just took my first air conditioned ride in my
bus after 11 years of having a non-functional air conditioning
system. What a difference. I should have done this years
ago.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">To recap, I have an aftermarket dpd overhead A/C
unit that I've seen quite a few of in 72-79 busses. Also a similar
one in Vanagons. It's T-shaped with three vents in the front and
two in the back. The condensor is mounted flat underneath the bus
with forward-facing louvers on the bottom and two shrouded fans
pulling air up through it. The original compressor was a York
piston compressor that was mounted on the left side of the fan
housing, driven by a dippy little thin fan belt that runs between
the fan housing and the engine. Requires removing the fan to access
the drive pulley. Besides the thin belt (which I hear is prone to
breaking, and only available at the dealer - $15 each) the location
of the stock compressor requires you to cut away a large amount of
tin on the left side of the motor, making it hard to get a good
seal.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I decided to try a different, unproven path.
Years ago I took out the stock compressor, got replacement tin and
sealed the engine compartment back up. I didn't want to undo this.
Instead, I dug up the old pulley assembly that bolted to the fan
which was supposed to drive the air pump. Took that off long ago
too. A kind listmember sold me a Sankyo rotary compressor with some
universal mounting brackets, which nearly worked as is to bolt the
compressor where the air pump used to be. I had to grind down one
of the brackets, use some spacers, and make one small bracket so
the compressor could be adjusted. The compressor then bolted right
in on top of the fan housing. I thought I was going to have to
ditch the blower fan and stock air box for clearance but everything
fit, although it's somewhat cramped in the engine compartment
now.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Next I dropped the evaporator unit in order to
disconnect the hoses from it. This was NOTFUN(tm). Took all of the
old hoses off the bus, threw them in a box and took them up to an
auto parts place that makes A/C hoses. $250 later, I had all new
hoses. That hurt. Normally I would cheap out on something like
this, but I had an A/C hose pop on me recently and it was a
seriously scary experience. The old hoses did not look like they
could take the 300+ psi that can be generated by the compressor, at
least not for long. I had them make the new ones a little longer to
account for the new location of the compressor. The low pressure
hose was 19 ft long!! Holy crap! The high pressure hose was "just"
11 ft - it only had to go to the condensor.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Today I installed the new hoses and seals, put
the evaporator unit back in. This was even more NOTFUN(tm), flushed
out the condensor with oil and compressed air, flushed out the
compressor with oil. Added some oil to the new evaporator/dryer, to
the condensor, and to the compressor. About 8 oz total. There are
two types of oil used with 134A. PAG and Ester. Ester is supposedly
more compatable with the old R12 style oil, so I used that since I
hadn't had the system formally flushed.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Tightened everything down, hooked up the wires,
and fired up the vacuum pump. Pulled a vacuum on the system and it
seemed to hold it just fine. Added a can of 134A then started it
up. Pressures were good, no apparent leaks, so I put in another
can. Temperature at the vents started dropping after the first can.
Disconnected the gauges and took it for a spin. Everything works!
The air temperature wasn't extremely cold (~60 degrees) but
compared to the 103 degree outside air, it felt pretty
good.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I couldn't really notice the drag on the engine.
I'm sure it takes some hp, but not much. I did have to increase my
idle to compensate but otherwise I can't tell the difference. I can
still hold 65 on the freeway, although I'm not going to cruise that
fast for a while because I don't want to stress the
compressor.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">A word about refrigerants. There are three
available now: R12, which is the old standard, R134A which is the
new standard, and Freeze-12 which is a relative newcomer. I have
absorbed a LOT of information about refrigerants in the last few
days and I am still not sure what to believe. Everybody has a
different story and everybody is absolutely convinced they are
right. I found the same to be true about CB antennas, but I won't
even get into that! I strongly considered going with each of the
three refrigerants, but I finally settled on 134A because it's
cheap, I can buy it without a license, and there are a lot of cars
on the road using it. Freeze-12 requires a license and is $8/can,
and hard to find. R-12 requires a license and is $18/can and liable
to go higher very soon. R134A is $3.50 can and you can get it at
most auto parts stores.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Some people say that 134A will have a higher
pressure in the system. My answer to that was to use less
refrigerant. I currently have about 40 oz in the system and the
maximum pressure on the high side is about 250 psi, which is well
within the safe range. I saw 300psi on the R12 system in my
car.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Some people say that 134A doesn't "carry the
oil" in suspension as well as R12, and that it will cause your
compressor to fail anywhere from a week to a year after you install
it. My answer to that is that I have a modern, reputable brand
compressor that is the same as what is installed in lots of other
cars that are running 134A successfully. If it can work for them,
it can work for me.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The evaporator is three feet above the
compressor and condensor. I worry that the oil is all going to
accumulate in the accumulator and not be carried UP to go through
the evaporator (and then back to the compressor) because of gravity
and because of the previous paragraph. This could cause the
compressor to not be lubricated properly. My answer to that is to
charge the system with a small can of oil/134A every year. The cans
are $3 and contain 2 oz of oil and 2 oz of 134A. You can hook them
up to the low pressure port and the contents will be sucked right
into the compressor. I figure if I do this once or twice a year,
the compressor will likely never starve for lubrication even it the
oil doesn't circulate well. My new dryer is enourmous - it was made
for a diesel truck the guy said. I'm sure it can hold a quart of
oil. Adding 2-4oz/year, I should be okay for several years before I
run into a problem with too much oil in the system.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">So, I will depart for Jerome on Wednesday and
drive 1,000 miles through the desert in 2 days. I'm thinking there
is a 50/50 chance that my unproven, pieced-together A/C system will
not survive the trip. Lots of things could go wrong - compressor
could fail, drive pulley could fail, connections could leak,
condensor fans could die, etc.. I will bring all of my tools along
and try to fix any problems on the way, but I may arrive in Arizona
all sweaty just like I did last year. We'll see. I'll be happy to
answer any questions about the installation, as well as general A/C
questions although at this point I'm mostly just passing on what
others have told me.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">[later David writes:]</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Tonight I replaced the broken coupler in my smog
pump pulley assembly (which is being used to drive an A/C
compressor) with a modified (bwahaha) hockey puck.</font>
