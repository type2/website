<h3>Retractible Seat Belts</h3>
<p>by Andy McKinley, John Holland, Eric Johnson, Steve Lashley,
David Schwarze, Robert Taylor, and Dave Kinerson</p>
<hr size="2">
<p><font size="+1">Andy McKinley writes:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I installed retractable lap/shoulder belts
purchased from JC Whitney in the front of my '72 and they're
fantastic. And they bolt right into the existing holes. They are JC
Whitney part #'s 12FA6244U (black), 14FA5083N (tan), 14FA5244T
(navy), 13FA5211T (red), 14FA5200N (maroon), and 14FA5115N
(silver/gray). Ready for the price? $97.99 EACH--but worth every
penny in my humble opinion. They are very modern and easy to use,
and they come with a long, stiff female end that attaches to the
side of the wheel well and stays up off the floor just like the
originals. As a matter of fact, the entire installation goes just
like stock. And they look like they belong there.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Whitney also has lap belts that work well in the
rear seats (black 90" long is part # 81FA2244U for $15.99,
occasionally they run these on sale for $11.99) and they're a
pretty good match for the retractables.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">John Holland writes:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I installed the "Type2 List Favourite" JC
Whitney Retractable seat/shoulder belts in my '77 Westy yesterday.
Once I figured out how to do it, it was two hours of easy work.
They are a welcome improvement.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The B pillar belt hangar needed to be spaced
away from the body to clear a flange, so I visited a hardware store
for washers. (With the hanger bolt having part of its length
unsupported, will it bend or break in an accident?)</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">It took me a while to decide where to mount the
reel. The only easy place was to attach it to the anchor point
outboard of seat. (The bolt securing this anchor point now will
have two forces acting on it in an accident.)</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">To install the belts I used a mix of fasteners
from the original belts, items from seat belt parts kit, and
hardware store washers.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">There are three attachment points. I worked on
them in this order:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Anchor Point Outboard of Seat: Used the original
bolt and washer. Stacking order from floor: original washer, 90
degree bracket (vertical part facing outward parallel to door), lap
belt end plate, original bolt. Having the end plate above the
bracket allows freedom of movement for belt, since the end plate
doesn't have a bend in it. Tightened bolt into body, then installed
reel vertically, inboard of bracket, using nut, bolt and washer
from belt parts kit. Reel is vertical, but angled slightly toward
rear of vehicle to allow belt a straight run to B pillar
attachment. Clearance between reel bolt and door panel - driver's
side: 1/4 inch - passenger's side: 0 inch (!).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">B Pillar Belt Hanger: Used the original metal
washer and the two original plastic washers. Used bolt, flat
washer, sleeve for belt hanger from seat belt parts kit. Purchased
washers so belt hanger out from body enough to allow the hanger to
pivot without hitting the vertical flange on pillar. Stacking order
from B Pillar: original washer, about 3/8 inch of extra washers as
spacers, plastic washer, sleeve inside belt hanger, plastic washer,
kit flat washer, kit bolt. The plastic covers for the belt hangers
were interfering with belt movement, so I filed a bit off the
bottom of the covers.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Anchor Point Inboard of Seat: Used original bolt
and washer.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">First Impressions: Belt material seems lighter,
more flexible than original belts. Reel seems to lock a bit too
easily; have to put belt on slowly. Nice to be able to lean forward
without restriction. Can reach into glove compartment without
taking off belt. Lap and shoulder belt still seems fairly snug, but
doesn't give as much support when cornering. Passenger belt buckle
lower and closer to seat than on driver's side, making buckling
belt a bit more difficult. Reel location hinders access to area
behind driver's seat.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The old belts were dated 20 May 1976, so it was
time to replace them.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I'm importing sets of retractable seatbelts from
Mexico. These were used on buses made in Mexico in the 1980's. They
will fit most bay window buses with little modification. You will
need some longer bolts for your upper shoulder mount, and I suggest
some longer bolts as well for mounting the retractable part behind
your seat. I may include some of these parts later on in a kit, but
for now you will need to buy your own.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I installed these in my '74 Campmobile and can't
tell you enough how much I love them. They fit well, and I can now
adjust the radio, or reach over and open the passenger window
without having to slip off the belt. Best of all, these are genuine
VW parts.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The seatbelt conversion only takes about an hour
to install. You receive both the left and right retractable
hardware, and 2 seat belt receiving ends that mount in the stock
location. The new buckle ends are made of heavy rubber coated
cable, and will want to lay on the floor when not in use. I made a
little loop of cloth attached to the seat frame to hold them up
next to my seats.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">David Schwarze writes:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">For those interested in a lower priced
alternative, get some Vanagon seatbelts from the junkyard and
fabricate a simple "L" bracket out of 3/16" steel (available for a
few dollars at hardware stores) for the lower mount. I did this and
it works well and is also made up of genuine VW parts, except for
the bracket. You can use the existing upper seatbelt mount bolt or
use a longer one and make a spacer so it will pivot. It does not
pivot with the stock, short bolt but I secured it at a 45 degree
angle and it works fairly well that way if you're careful about how
you pull it. Someday I will make the spacer so it can pivot again,
but even as it is, it's miles ahead of the stock belts, which
everyone agrees are a royal PITA.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Robert Taylor writes:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">A few years ago I installed 3 point seatbelts
from a Rabbit (I think- maybe an Audi of some sort- got 'em already
removed form a junkyard) in my 1978 VW bus. I manufactured an
L-shaped bracket with two holes to bolt the seatbelt spool to and
one bolt to the floor of the bus next to front seats, outboard. I
replaced my receivers on the inboard sides of the seats with the
junkyard ones since they don't quite fit the original ones. I like
'em OK but there are at least three problems with them that my
passengers (most notably my luvin' wife) complain about
chronically:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Problem1- The lock is a tad sensitive. You have
to pull them out slowly or they lock on you. I never have trouble
with this, but the impatient jerk on them and complain every
time.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Problem2- The Rabbit (or whatever) is a smaller
car than the bus. There is barely enough belt to work in the bus. I
run out of belt if I lean forward much. A large friend of mine
doesn't have enough belt to buckle the thing. I can imagine ways to
manufacture an attachment point for the spool end of the belt
somewhere partways up the column behind the front doors, but then
it might interfere with turning the passenger seat around to face
aft. In any case the stock attachment location results in a lot of
belt used up between the spool and the shoulder attach
point.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Problem3- the receivers are a bit low- my
passengers are always fishing around looking for them and
complaining. I have no problems.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Folks have been lobbying for years for me to
"solve my seatbelt problem" when I thought I already had. I've
found this solution to be less than optimal.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Dave Kinerson writes:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Recently there has been a discussion about using
seat belts from a Rabbit or some such in a bread loaf. Good idea if
they are like new and fit, but I need to add my $.05 worth here.
You must NOT use old seat belts from old cars, especially from a
wrecked car. Here's why.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">It seems that I once worked for a crash test
facility for New York State DOT. I designed the instrumentation for
the various tests. One of the things that I learned about seat
belts is they must stretch a little during a crash. The reason for
this is that when you crash you are thrown against them with a
least a couple of "Gs" of force, usually more. When your body hits
the belt, it is like hitting a wall. The reason that the belt is
kept sung to the body is to reduce the traveling distance to the
first object struck. The stretchiness of the belt absorbs some of
the impact and lessens the injury to the body.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">As seat belts age they tend to get dirty with
stuff from McDonalds and the like. This dirt will make the belt
stiff. A stiff belt will not have the give that it should have and
will cause serious injury to the body if you hit it with any
significant force.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">A seat belt from a wrecked car is even worse.
Here the fibers are pulled to their design limit resulting in no
possible stretch at all. To prove my point, in the owners manual of
every Volvo, there is a statement that informs the owner to replace
the seat belts in the event of a accident. Now I don't give a hoot
about Volvos but the point here is this, this manufacturer
recognizes that seat belts stretched in an accident must be
replaced.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I am of the opinion that driving with stiff seat
belts is nearly as dangerous as driving with original fuel line.
What you don't know can be very dangerous.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">If you insist on using used belts, make sure
that they have some stretchyness left in them. Go find a new car
and feel the things. Then go looking for belts. I think you find
that you will wind up doing what I did and order either a set of
original belts or perhaps get a set of generic belts from your
favorite supplier.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">In my 76 Westy, I used retractable seat belts
from J. C. Whitney. I found that the original belt mounting holes
(for the lack of a better term) would accept the bolts supplied
from J. C. Whitney (JCW). The threads matched and screwed right in.
I used the supplied "L" bracket to mount the retractor vertically
behind the front seat and I mounted the "shoulder loop" with the
original hardware. I had to replace the original buckle with the
JCW one and used the original bolt here as well.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I noted the following things about this setup.
The J.C. Whitney retractable belts will not latch gently to relieve
that annoying tension on the shoulder. This can be a bit of a
problem for short drivers with the seat pulled forward. I keep the
seat full to the rear and it doesn't seem to bother. The are also a
little long for this application, and will not fully retract. This
means that the belt will fall out the door every time you get out.
I just stuff it back behind the seat when I get out. You get used
to it. Finally it would be nice if the buckle end could be made to
stay near the edge of the seat instead of lying on the floor. But
as I said, you get used to it.</font></p>
