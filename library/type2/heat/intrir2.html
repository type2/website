Noise Proofing 2</font></b></p>
</ul>
<p align="center"><img class="img-responsive" src="line1.gif" width="623" height="7"></p>
<ul>
<p align="center"><font size="6">Next step, Kool Patch!</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">As we saw in the pictures previously, the
body has little protection from the ravages of friction, and
moisture. As this van was to serve us for many years, I made
valiant efforts toward protecting the body from corrosion, while
deadening sound. The product of choice, Kool Patch, by Kool Seal
(</font><a href=
"http://www.Koolseal.com/">www.Koolseal.com</a><font face=
"Arial">). (Graphics shamelessly absconded with from Koolseal
website)</font></p>
<p><a href="http://www.koolseal.com/"><img class="img-responsive" src="Image55.gif"
border="0" width="227" height="49"></a><a href=
"http://www.koolseal.com/"><img class="img-responsive" src="Image56.gif" border="0" width=
"100" height="120"></a><font face="Arial">This product is designed
primarily for patching home roofs. It is an
asphalt/rubber/fiberglass emulsion that comes in a gallon bucket
for about $8.00. It brushes on with a coarse-bristle (Tampico)
brush, and is approximately the consistency of chocolate pudding,
while neither as flavorful nor as nutritious. It does smell nice
though.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Once dried, it requires a blow torch for
removal. I'm not kidding. It is a tough, leathery, thick coating
that laughs at the most offensive weather, salt spray, or friction.
I cannot speak highly enough of this product. If you are going
through a total "re-do" like we were, or if you just want to
re-undercoat your fenders, USE THIS STUFF. A couple of coats of
this will (perhaps permanently???) protect your van. We used
copious amounts of this, inside and out in the van.</font></p>
I seem to recall some assurance (on the can or website) that it
will last eight years or more on a roof. It has lasted more than
two years under the van without changing, flaking, or anything. I
combed some through my hair, and it stopped my retreating hairline.
Great stuff.
<p><img class="img-responsive" src="Image35.gif" width="338" height="224"><font face=
"Arial">Here's an example of the type of crap we put this van
through, and the Kool Seal looks like the day I put it on. Rapid
City, South Dakota; that's "popcorn" ice covering the panels and
wheel cover. The entire bottom of the bus was coated in 1-5" of ice
like this. No problem. None of the Kool Patch flaked or
cracked.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Kool Seal recommends it as an undercoating,
and I second the motion. We covered the entire underbody and the
entire interior (behind the panels, under the
insulation).</font></p>
<p align="center"><img class="img-responsive" src="Image32.gif" width="405" height=
"272"><img class="img-responsive" src="Image33.gif" width="270" height="418"></p>
<p><font face="Arial">At the point shown in the photos above, The
wheel arches, walls, and inclined area at the back of the floor
have been covered with Q-Pads, and then sealed around/over-coated
with two layers of Kool Patch. In the photo on the right, the Kool
Patch is still moist.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">We undercoated the interior primarily to
prevent rust. We have all seen how much condensation forms on the
windows while driving or camping in the winter; that same
condensation can form on the inside walls too. Further, it was
possible that moisture could accumulate in the insulation (from a
spill, rain leakage, etc) and rust through the body. The Kool patch
virtually eliminates this possibility. It furthers the
noise-damping in the body, too.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">We will discuss undercoating of the
floor/undercarriage in greater detail in the heater
section/conclusion.</font></p>
</ul>
<p align="center"><img class="img-responsive" src="line1.gif" width="623" height="7"></p>
<ul>
<p align="center"><font size="6">R-13 Insulation</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">A primary mission in this exercise was to
create a warm, comfortable bus for winter outings, the first of
which was our 9,000 mile honeymoon across the USA in the winter
(Oct-Dec 1997).</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">It made no sense to leave the outside walls
un-insulated. R-13 household insulation is readily available, and
is not terribly expensive (in addition, it looks like cotton candy,
which reminds me of the Fair). I recall that I bought a roll at a
home store, and still had enough change from a $20 for lunch with
Mrs.B. at Taco Bell. Mmmmmmmm.</font></p>
<p><u><font face="Arial" size="5" color="#008000">Welcome to
Insulation 101</font></u></p>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><font face="Arial">Insulation works by trapping little pockets
of air. Air is the insulator, not the fiberglass.</font></li>
<li><font face="Arial">Air is a great insulator. That is why you
can stand near flowing hot lava and take pictures of it. If air
suddenly conducted lava's 1,300-degree heat as well as metal does,
it would spoil your photograph, your hairdo, and probably your
entire vacation.</font></li>
<li><font face="Arial">Little pockets of air are just about as good
at insulating as BIG pockets of air.</font></li>
<li><font face="Arial">So, the greater the number of little pockets
of air between you and the chilly VW steel, the better you are
going to feel. Therefore, fiberglass must be fluffy to
work.</font></li>
<li><font face="Arial">If you PACK the insulation in, it will not
work well. Not enough little pockets of air.</font></li>
<li><font face="Arial">If you leave spaces around the insulation
for air to flow, you will have drafts and cold spots.</font></li>
<li><font face="Arial">So, chassis cavities must be full, but not
OVERFILLED.</font></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<p><font face="Arial">This is a time-consuming task, fit for monks
and retirees. The insulation must be cut precisely to fill, but not
overfill each cavity. These cavities are a myriad of shapes and
thicknesses, and there was no practical way to save time. I recall
this task taking a week of evenings. I must truly love my
wife.</font></p>
<p><img class="img-responsive" src="Image36.gif" width="456" height="330"><img class="img-responsive" src=
"Image37.gif" width="424" height="262"></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The left photo is self-explanatory if you are
familiar with the interior of a VW bus. The right photo shows the
interior of the sliding door. It has been covered with Q-Pads,
doubly coated with Kool Patch, and sprayed with spray adhesive in
preparation for the insulation. You will notice small bits of
insulation on the floor of the van. Don't throw these away until
you are finished with the job, as they come in handy to fill small
gaps. The voids in the door were later filled with foam
filler.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Cut the insulation to fit, spray,
stick.</font></p>
</ul>
<p align="center"><img class="img-responsive" src="line1.gif" width="623" height="7"></p>
<ul>
<p align="center"><font size="6">Vapor Barrier</font></p>
<p><img class="img-responsive" src="Image40.gif" width="69" height="77"><font face=
"Arial">&nbsp;If you put insulation behind your upholstered panels
and you fail to put a solid vapor barrier on top of it, you have
insured your van's future as a chicken coop or artificial reef.
Follow me on thisï¿½</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">If ever you:</font></p>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><font face="Arial">camp in your van, or just sleep in it (rest
stop) on cool nights,</font></li>
<li><font face="Arial">hop in with damp clothes on and turn on the
heat, or</font></li>
<li><font face="Arial">entertain your mate in the van a way that
causes you both to respire heavily,</font></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<p><font face="Arial">you put a LOT of water vapor into the air.
That vapor can go virtually anywhere in your van and condense. It
particularly likes places where the air is motionless and cool,
like on the window panes and the outside body panels (behind the
upholstered panels, where it can condense in private).</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Insulation holds water. Fiberglass insulation
can hold many times its weight in water. Here comes your
respiration, and it all condenses behind your body panels, in the
giant pink sponge, your insulation. There is no mechanism for that
insulation to dry out until summer (if then), so for months, your
insulation, and therefore, your body panels stay wet.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Within a few years, the inside of the walls
will rust, and you won't know it until the paint on the OUTSIDE
starts to bubble up. UGH! Avoid it.</font></p>
<p><img class="img-responsive" src="Image38.gif" width="396" height="244" alt=
"insulation on the door"><font face="Arial">Here is our door,
completely sealed off with 4.5 mil plastic sheeting. The black
pieces you see near the latch are fragments of Q-Pad positioned to
catch the resonance of the latch closing. The voids are filled with
foam at this point and we are ready for our upholstered panels. You
must do this to ALL of you insulated panels.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">This is not difficult to do. Purchase the
thickest clear plastic sheeting you can buy. Cut a piece that is
roughly 10% bigger than the panel, but follows its contours. Make
absolutely sure that the periphery of the door (where the plastic
will seal) is Immaculately Clean. According to Catholic Catechism,
a surface is defined as "Immaculately Clean" only if you could
proudly serve a Balogna sandwich to the Virgin Mother off said
surface). If you powerwashed/steamcleaned the body (as described
earlier) it will be clean enough.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Buy the best spray adhesive you can buy; that
"Arts and Crafts" crap made for kids to hold felt together won't
cut the mustard. Follow the directions for "Maximum Bond" which
usually entails spraying both surfaces, waiting a minute for it to
cure, then placing the plastic in place. I mask off the surrounding
surfaces on the body so I can spray with reckless
abandon.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">On the door above, I sprayed the periphery
and the center "t". Place the plastic starting from the center of
the panel first, and work your way out. Trim off the excess plastic
sheeting with a sharp blade or broken piece of onyx.</font></p>
<p><img class="img-responsive" src="Image40.gif" width="69" height="77"><font face=
"Arial">&nbsp;</font><font face="Arial" color="#FF0000">VERY
IMPORTANT:</font> <font face="Arial">this is not Saran Wrap, and
you are not storing Lasagna; this plastic MUST be sealed all the
way around, HOWEVER it should NOT be tight as a drum. Take a close
look at the picture. Puckers are <b><i>okay</i></b>. You want this
plastic to have some "play" in it. Polyethylene tends to shrink a
bit as it ages. If you make this tight now it will crack as it
retreats, and then it's rusty-old-VW-brand-chicken-coop-city,
baby.</font></p>
