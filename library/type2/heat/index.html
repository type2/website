copy, so they were not lost forever. I have mirrored them here for
the benefit of the VW Bus enthusiast community. I have attempted to
mirror all the pages and images that were not exernal references.
There is currently one broken link (a missing picture) that I am
aware of. If you find more, or have any other suggestions that

please don't hold me resonsible for the content of these pages. I'm

all of the interest in the site.</font></i></p>
I understand that links to it are on a number of vintage auto sites
worldwide. Terrific! Add it to your page, if you like; permission
granted. Or print it out, and carry it with you everywhere. Keep it
as a pet, if that makes you smile. My goal is to help as many folks
as I can. A huge update to the site is in progress (yes, I've been
saying that since 1998), incorporating answers to many of the
questions folks have e-mailed. Check back for new photos, diagrams,
and droll commentary. Someday, before The Second Coming, there will
be an update.This paragraph is the only place you will find a
shameless plug for our consulting buiness, some of the profits from
which keep this web site going. In a nutshell, we provide guidance
in strategic public affairs, internal communications, marketing,
and change management to global companies and non-profits. If we
can help your group, call. We now return you to your regularly
scheduled program. For legal reasons, if you haven't checked out
the "Terms of Use" page, please do. That way if you foolishly
neglect to extinguish your cigar before working with volatile VW
fumes, I can attend the funeral and tell your family "Shame, but
'twasn't my fault..."

As you probably can tell, I am not a web guru. Nor a web Shiek,
Czar, Potentate, Emperor, pedagogue, methodologist, know-it-all, or
other capable or revered web thing. When making this site, (which
took place through weary eyes, over a couple evenings), I didn't
know how to make thumbnails or whether to use GIF's or JPEGs. I
didn't do my best jobb of edidting either...
<p><i><font face="Arial" color="#800000">../but I know VW's, so
forgive the slow loading, long scrolls, ugly fonts, or links that
don't work quite right. In the HUGE update I am working on for this
site, things are a little less homey.</font></i></p>
<p><i><font face="Arial" color="#800000">Where possible, I linked
right to product websitesï¿½ I'm not sure if this is Kosher, but I
figured out how to do it, and it seemed handy, so if this isn't
a-okay, let me know.</font></i></p>

<li><font face="Arial">Can you imagine your vehicle in 10 years
having as little rust as it has today?</font></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<p><font face="Arial">If you answered yes, yes, or no to any of the
above questions, this page is for you. This page contains
definitive answers, and clearly illustrated techniques, and witty
commentary. After studying the materials on this site, you will be
able to make virtually any car quieter, more solid, warmer in the
winter, cooler in the summer, and more comfortable.</font></p>
<p><img class="img-responsive" src="Image40.gif" width="69" height="77"><font face=
"Arial">&nbsp;Look for this symbol for information you must not
miss. Uncle Sam will keep you from screwing up an otherwise great
job.</font></p>
</ul>
<p align="center"><img class="img-responsive" src="line1.gif" width="623" height="7"></p>
<p align="center"><font size="6">Details of this Study</font></p>
<ul>
<p><font face="Arial">Whether you have an '60's Ghia or Bug, a
'70's era Bus, or a more recent Vanagon, you face the same
problems: installing respectable heat, eliminating that
ear-shattering VW racket, and preventing body-rotting corrosion.
Why did Honda and Ford get this right, and VW failed?</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Back at the VW factory, the design teams that
worked on heat, noise, and rust took LONG lunches together and left
early each day for Das Hofbraeuhaus. VW did not adequately address
these three design shortcomings until the mid-1990's. By then,
millions of VW's were produced with pathetic heat, LOUD interiors,
and bodies that rust from under their hand-sanded enamel paint
jobs. Shame.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The ideas presented here are the result of 12
years of informal experimentation with a myriad of VW's and Porsche
914's, and study of luxury cars like Lexus, Infinity, and Cadillac.
Some ideas were lifted directly from my Jetta Turbo Diesel, which
is remarkably quiet considering the power source.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Other ideas came from Ford, a company that
commissioned an expensive study recently (1990?) to determine
"<i>what elements in a vehicle do people equate with
'quality'</i>".</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Ford found that the chief issue people
looked/listened for, was highly ethereal, and many people didn't
realize they were judging this, until the researchers pointed it
out. People were consciously or subconsciously sensing <b><i>how
long</i></b> after a given action (on the vehicle) was there
audible resonance of that action. For example, when they closed the
door, did it make one, solid, "clunk"? Or was it a long symphony of
various parts, rattling, clanging, vibrating, and reverberating,
"clatt-uh-dah-ur-annnk-dunkannng" (ala VW). Ford even zoomed in on
their power locks, and glove box latches, and the sounds they made
when being activated. Go listen to a new Ford, it is
incredible.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Our project was a 1976 VW Bus, 2.0 Liter, FI,
California original, seen here on day one, June 3, 1997. That's an
"AS IS" dealer sticker on the side window. Duhï¿½I wanted a
warrantee.</font> <font face="Wingdings">J</font></p>
<p align="center"><img class="img-responsive" src="Image28.gif" width="274" height=
"185"><img class="img-responsive" src="Image7.gif" width="370" height="186"></p>
<p><font face="Arial">This purchase was to be my wife's daily
driver for the next 10 years. Having owned VW's for years, I wanted
her to have the most solid, quietest, warmest vehicle possible; but
she wanted THIS van. So we spared no expense in its restoration,
and I used every idea I had devised to cure the ills of an old VW.
We are still paying First USA for some of that "expense". We since
changed</font> <b><i><font face="Arial" size="4">"our"</font></i>
<font face="Arial">minds, bought a White Westfalia, and sold the
Bus; that's another story.</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Arial">As you can tell from the photos, this project
was NOT a "recovery" effort, but a prevention effort. Although we
replaced most everything mechanical on the bus, the bus was rock
solid, rust free, and simply needed updating and maintenance parts
(shocks, brakes, motor, etc.).</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">So here is what you can learn

<p align="center"><font size="6">Important Concepts</font></p>
<ul>
<p><img class="img-responsive" src="Image40.gif" width="69" height="77"><font face=
"Arial">&nbsp;Here are some basic concepts you should understand.
They underlie all our solutions:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" color="#800000">Metal conducts heat and noise
freely.</font> <font face="Arial" size="5" color="#800000">ï¿½</font>
<font face="Arial" color="#800000">Large sheets of metal
reverberate after the originating noise has ceased.</font>
<font face="Arial" size="5" color="#800000">ï¿½</font> <font face=
"Arial" color="#800000">Untreated steel corrodes quickly.</font>
<font face="Arial" size="5" color="#800000">ï¿½</font> <font face=
"Arial" color="#800000">Certain types of padding can absorb noise
and shock.</font> <font face="Arial" size="5" color=
"#800000">ï¿½</font> <font face="Arial" color="#800000">Certain types
of padding can reflect heat back into the passenger
compartment.</font> <font face="Arial" size="5" color=
"#800000">ï¿½</font> <font face="Arial" color="#800000">Insulation
can trap heat, keeping it where you want it.</font> <font face=
"Arial" size="5" color="#800000">ï¿½</font> <font face="Arial" color=
"#800000">Certain types of asphalt/rubber emulsions and tiles can
eliminate reverberation and noise transmission in metal.</font>
<font face="Arial" size="5" color="#800000">ï¿½</font> <font face=
"Arial" color="#800000">Certain types of asphalt/rubber emulsions
can seal metal to prevent rust.</font> <font face="Arial" size="5"
color="#800000">ï¿½</font> <font face="Arial" color="#800000">VW put
nearly ZERO effort into insulating/noiseproofing their air-cooled
vehicles.</font> <font face="Arial" size="5" color=
"#800000">ï¿½</font> <font face="Arial" color="#800000">The heater
system in our VW was of intelligent design, but was poorly
executed.</font> <font face="Arial" size="5" color=
"#800000">ï¿½</font> <font face="Arial" color="#800000">Our project
vehicle was virtually rust free (This was NOT a "recovery" effort,
but a prevention effort).</font> <font face="Arial" size="5" color=
"#800000">ï¿½</font> <font face="Arial" color="#800000">Redesigning
motor mounts (ala the 1980-1983 Vanagon) to eliminate noise would
have helped, but was outside the scope of our effort.</font>
<font face="Arial" size="5" color="#800000">ï¿½</font></p>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<p><font face="Arial">The following graphics show the typical
protection VW designed into floors and walls. Little effort was
made to inhibit corrosion, or stop the transmission of noise and
heat. Sheet metal is relatively bare to the elements, and easily
transmits heat and noise to the cabin.</font></p>

starts by pulling the motor), and show details (product names,
