Back In</font></b></p>
</ul>
<p align="center"><img class="img-responsive" height="7" src="line1.gif" width="623"/></p>
<ul>
<p><font face="Arial">I won't waste your time with details of the
engine pull/machining/rebuild. It was typical, no surprises. Burned
valves, blah, blah, blah.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Our focus is the body, not the motor. This
page covers the details of our noise/rust/heat study related to the
motor and motor box. Again, forgive any slow load, long
scroll.</font></p>
</ul>
<p align="center"><img class="img-responsive" height="7" src="line1.gif" width="623"/></p>
<p align="center"><font size="6">Initial Conditions</font></p>
<ul>
<p><img class="img-responsive" height="216" src="Image41.gif" width="441"/><a href="barebox.jpg"><img border="0" class="img-responsive" height="290" src="Image13.gif" width="416"/></a></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Whether you have a Bus or other VW, look at
your motor box. Only pathetic wisps of soundproofing insulation on
the top surface. The rest is bare metal, which catches all the
pulses and clatter from the motor, transferring that cacophony to
the rest of the body. When you close your motor compartment cover
(or any door on your van), it sounds like a trash can lid. No
damping or insulation. Ugh.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">On top of all that, the Type II is not
exactly a silky quiet motor. In 1970, when Porsche put the Type IV
(a close cousin to the Type II) in the 914, the automotive press
said the motor "made an abysmal racket" and "sounded like a
sheet-metal stamping factory inches from my back". Agreed. VW
didn't think it was bad enough to put much effort into containing
that noise. We did though.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Notice the complete lack of thermal
insulation to keep excess heat in the motor area, and not in the
van.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Finally, notice the lack of
protectant/undercoating in the cooling air intake/battery
compartment. This area is bathed in rain, and sometimes, battery
acid. VW thought that paint would protect the body in this
environment, and many former bus owners (who now own a VW-brand
chicken coop, storage shed, etc) can testify to how wrong VW was.
In our case, the battery area was free of rust and simply needed
cleaning.</font></p>
</ul>
<p align="center"><img class="img-responsive" height="7" src="line1.gif" width="623"/></p>
<p align="center"><font size="6">Preparation</font></p>
<ul>
<p><font face="Arial">We carefully stripped out all seats, panels,
mats and everything else from the interior. I do not mean just
certain everythings, I mean EVERYTHING. Even the crummy rubber
matting under the front seats and the ridiculous "noise insulation"
back on the sides of the rear cargo area. We taped off the dash and
sealed it in plastic, and did the same to the steering wheel center
(horn, turn signals, etc.)</font></p>
<p><img class="img-responsive" height="77" src="Image40.gif" width="69"/><font face="Arial">  We then power washed/steam cleaned the entire body
inside and out, top to bottom, every crack, every crevice, to
remove all traces of grease and grime. The motor was also steam
cleaned, even though it was coming out the next day. No sense in
getting grimy while pulling a motor, right?</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">I cannot recommend this washing highly enough
as you start this project. It beats the heck out of cleaning each
area with 409 before installing the insulation/noise
proofing/plastic, or whatever.</font></p>
</ul>
<p align="center"><img class="img-responsive" height="7" src="line1.gif" width="623"/></p>
<p align="center"><a href="http://www.nasa.gov/"><font size="7">NASA</font></a> <font size="6">Insulation</font></p>
<ul>
<p><font face="Arial">Now lets look at what we added:</font></p>
<p align="center"><a href="inslmtr.jpg"><img border="0" class="img-responsive" height="235" src="Image14.gif" width="379"/></a></p>
<p><font face="Arial">In this somewhat gloomy photograph, we see
the components mounted on the firewall have been removed,
insulation installed, and the components reinstalled, carefully
cutting away the insulation where need be. The roll you see in the
rear cargo area is a remnant of the insulation used. It is sold
by</font> <a href="http://www.jcwhitneyusa.com/">J.C. Whitney &amp;
Co</a><font face="Arial">, under the name "Heat and Noise
insulation used by</font> <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/">NASA</a><font face="Arial">". About
$20.</font></p>
<p align="center"><img class="img-responsive" height="238" src="Image16.gif" width="216"/></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Here we see two layers of this insulation on
the motor box cover. It is a flame proof felt pad about 1/3" thick
with two layers of aluminum facing and a fiberglass mesh for
rigidity. Goes on easy. Use: industrial spray adhesive, scissors,
and two dashes of common sense. Certain components on the top
surface were used to "hang" the insulation while the adhesive
cured, and two screws with 2" washers were installed into the
cross-body member to insure a solid fit. This same product is used
throughout the van (we used four rolls) and I will refer to it as
"<i>NASA insulation</i>".</font></p>
</ul>
<p align="center"><img class="img-responsive" height="7" src="line1.gif" width="623"/></p>
<p align="center"><font size="6">Polyurethane Foam Filler for
Voids</font></p>
<ul>
<p><font face="Arial">I cannot emphasize enough the importance of
this step. If you skip this, you are missing a good quarter of the
noiseproofing and heat retention, as well as some great measure of
rustproofing as well.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">All of the "voids" throughout the body
naturely resonate with any sound/vibration introduced to them. You
know how this works...you've seen on the X-Files where Agent
Muldore is running through sewer piping, being chased by a
mangle-faced, inbred alien, when he screams out "SCULLY!!!!"...it
echos for miles do Agent Scully, who is smoking a cigarette up on
the surface...The point? Tubes and cavities resonate
near-perfectly.Further, these are the same areas where condensation
and moisture can cause needles corrosion, and heat can leak out
freely.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">THEREFORE, all of the "cavities" thoughout
the entire body are filled with polyurethane expansion foam filler.
You can buy this under the product name "</font><a href="http://www.itsgreatstuff.com/">Great Stuff</a><font face="Arial">"
for about $7 a can. This is one of Lexus and Infinity's little
tricks toward making a very solid body.</font></p>
<p><img class="img-responsive" height="86" src="Image54.gif" width="108"/><font face="Arial">When I say a cavity or void, I mean a hollow area that can
trap and resonate sound. For example, there is a void that runs
around the entire periphery on the motor box cover, see below.
Notice the foam in the void next to the lock. but they are
EVERYWHERE on the body. Around the tops of all the doors, around
the bottom of the sliding door, and the rear hatch, even in front
of the front floorboad, below the headlamp buckets. FILL
THEM.</font></p>
</ul>
<table border="0" cellpadding="9" cellspacing="0" width="798">
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p align="center"><img class="img-responsive" height="192" src="Image17.gif" width="164"/></p>
</td>
<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p align="center"><img class="img-responsive" height="240" src="Image15.gif" width="360"/></p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<ul>
<p><font face="Arial">This stuff really deadens resonance, a big
difference when you close a door. Infinity and Lexus use this in
ALL the voids. They also claim it "stiffens the body". I dunno
about that, but on your VW you notice no more trash can lid sound.
Rule of thumb on your van, if it isn't there to drain water, FILL
IT with this stuff.</font></p>
It also is a good filler/caulking. For example, we used it to fill
the gap between the rear wheel arch and the outside body panel
(bottom of the cooling air intake area, (below the spare tire
well). Notice that V-shaped gap? Many buses begin their rusty trip
toward becoming a chicken coop right there. Prevent it. Clean it,
and caulk it.
<p><img class="img-responsive" height="77" src="Image40.gif" width="69"/><font face="Arial"> </font><font color="#800000" face="Arial">Three VERY
important caveats, though:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><b><i>First</i></b>, think twice about what
you fill with polyurethane expansion foam. Certain areas of the
body are designed to drain water, for example, the bottom of the
front doors. Fill these and you will grant yourself endless moist
days, and rusty doors. There are plenty of spots where this stuff
can cause water to collect. Beware.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><b><i>B),</i></b> this stuff is unfathomably
sticky, and quite durable. If your appearance or health is of any
concern, wear gloves, a long sleeve shirt, goggles, and a hat.
Also, if you have neighbors or children nearby, wear
trousers.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><b><i>III-</i></b>, the instructions say
"<b><i>only fill areas 1/3<sup>rd</sup> full</i></b>." This is not
idle chatter. This product will miraculously expand for hours as it
cures, like Mt. St. Helens, pushing big sticky globs of foam into
places where you do not want it to be. Once it is cured (24-48) you
can cut it with a razor blade and make little sculptures of the
hardened blobs. It took four cans for our project, not counting
blob sculptures.</font></p>
</ul>
<p align="center"><img class="img-responsive" height="7" src="line1.gif" width="623"/></p>
<p align="center"><font size="6">Zero Balancing and Counter
Weighted Cranks</font></p>
<ul>
<p><font face="Arial">If you truly want a silent bus and you are
having the motor rebuilt, you can take a couple of extra steps at
moderate cost for dramatic results.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">If money is no object, purchase a
counterweighted crankshaft for the motor. This will probably run
between $400-$700 (a guess). The crankshaft is the main rotating
mass inside the motor and by nature, the Type II crankshaft creates
low-frequency vibration as it spins. A counter-weighted crankshaft
eliminates this vibration by welding/machining large weights to the
side of the crank opposite the connecting rod journals. Modern
motors (including all VW's now) have counterweighted
cranks.</font></p>
<p><img class="img-responsive" height="240" src="Image18.gif" width="360"/><img class="img-responsive" height="240" src="Image19.gif" width="360"/></p>
<p><font face="Arial">If money is somewhat of an object, use your
stock crankshaft, but have it "Zero Balanced". Zero Balancing means
machining off exact amounts of metal to make all of the
reciprocating/rotating parts identical in weight across and along
the axis of the crankshaft. In plain English, it's like having your
tires balanced, except we are talking about all of the heavy,
spinning stuff in your motor.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Have the same done for the connecting rods
(including end to end), pistons, flywheel and pressure plate and
donï¿½t forget your cooling fan. Beyond your regular machining, this
may add $300. It is worth EVERY penny. Your motor will sound like a
sewing machine when you are done.</font></p>
</ul>
<p align="center"><img class="img-responsive" height="7" src="line1.gif" width="623"/></p>
<p align="center"><font size="6">Hot Stuff-Exhaust
Wrapping</font></p>
<ul>
<p><font face="Arial">This actually is a critical part of our
heater effort, but was done while the motor is out, so it lands
here.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Exhaust wrapping is fiberglass-mesh webbing,
approximately 3 millimeters thick, and about 6 centimeters wide. It
is applied by moistening the mesh, then wrapping the exhaust spiral
fashion. The webbing hardens into a chrysalis around the
pipes.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Its purpose is twofold. First, to insulate
the exhaust tubing so the waste gasses do not cool immediately
after leaving the heads, thus maintaining their velocity. This is
important. If the exhaust cools suddenly on leaving the heads, it
slows down, making the motor work harder to push it out the exahust
tubing, muffler, and tailpipe. Don't forget, it is the force of
your piston that has to do the job of pushing that exhaust out,
wasting horsepower.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Second, the insulation prevents the glowing
HOT exhaust tubes from radiating tremendous heat (infrared) to the
heads. we forget about this IR heat sometimes, but if you turn your
motor off after a hard run ahd put your hand near your bare
exhaust, you will feel the tremendous toasting action. All of this
IR would normally bake the lower portion of the heads as they are
trying to stay cool. Counter productive.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Finally, you want the exhaust to stay hot for
another reason though: namely more available heat in your heat
exchangers. As an added benefit you get cleaner emissions. The
emissions decrease is due to the hotter temperatures "afterburning"
unburned exhaust/fuel products. VW's afterburner pipe was for this
reason, but the original insulation never lasts more than a few
years. This product more than adaquately replaces that afterburning
effect. Most importantly, though, all of that heat is now available
for release INSIDE your heat exchanger, driving the heated-air
temperatures through the roof.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The product works so well you can grab your
exhaust system with an ungloved hand even straight away after
highway travel. This serves no real purpose, and is not even handy
enough to be an entertaining party gag, but it is interesting
nonetheless. The total increase in temperatures in our heat
exchangers would be hard to codify but our heat works better than
many water-cooled vehicles, and I know this product was key to
acheiving this.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">I seem to recall the name of the product is
"RaceTec" or "J-tech". You can find it at Hot Rod shops for about
$35 a roll. They will look at you as if you are crazy when you tell
them you want it for your VW Bus. Tell them you ARE crazy, and to
sell you a roll or else you'll drink Brake Fluid. They'll sell it
to you.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">While we are talking about the picture below,
note the new heat exchangers. If yours are rusty or full of holes,
get new ones. It's about $600 for the pair and well worth
it.</font></p>
<p align="center"><img class="img-responsive" height="372" src="Image20.gif" width="717"/></p>
<p><font face="Arial">You can barely make it out in this
photograph, wrapped around the exhaust extractors and afterburner
"J-tubes". This was during the rebuild, a time when I did not mind
seeing the motor upside down behind the van. Today, this occurrence
would be sad. Of course it's not my bus now, and if Jamie (New
Owner) wants to flip the motor, or grab the exhaust, that's his
prerogative.</font></p>
<p align="center"><img class="img-responsive" height="321" src="Image21.gif" width="536"/></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Here is another shot, of the exhaust J-tube
just before selling the van. Much of the protective paint has
washed off the fiberglass wrapping and needs to be renewed, but you
can get a clearer picture of the fiberglass webbing, and of the
wrapping on the heat riser tube. (Note our new Westfalia in the
background). Note the blob of JB Weld sealing the EGR pipe.</font>
<font face="Wingdings">J</font> <font face="Arial">Also note, I do
not use the regular VW oil filter, but a PH8A instead. Somewill
argue not using VW filters, and they maybe right, but I always have
used the larger filter since my 914 days (Pres. Reagan years). PH8A
gives about double the filtering capacity, and only hangs a bit
lower. Note the very-tip of a green hose at the upper right of the
photo, that is the "self-draining" line for our 94-quart cooler.
Wow, there's just all sorts of stuff to Note in this
photo.</font></p>
</ul>
<p align="center"><img class="img-responsive" height="7" src="line1.gif" width="623"/></p>
<p align="center"><font size="6">Final Preparations</font></p>
<ul>
<p><font face="Arial">We sealed all of the joints in the
heating/tinware with High-temperature silicone sealant. Many of the
gaps were a few millimeters wide. Across the entire motor, it added
up to a lot of leaking air. If you look closely at the photographs
below, you will note orange gook oozing around all of the
flanges/tinware. We applied it before assembly then tightened the
parts down, and wiped off the excess.</font></p>
<p align="center"><img class="img-responsive" height="227" src="Image22.gif" width="283"/><img class="img-responsive" height="208" src="Image23.gif" width="348"/></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Okay, I know that all this is kind of Anal
Retentive, but this was my lovely wife's bus, and I wanted the
absolute best for her. If she were your mate, you would feel as
inspired.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">It goes without saying, we replaced the foam
seal that surrounds the motor. For those who are new in town, that
spongy foam seal is a critical component of the cooling system. It
prevents the very hot air from under the motor from being sucked
into the cooling fan. All of your cooling air must come from the
scoops (ears) on the back of your van, or you risk
overheating.</font></p>
