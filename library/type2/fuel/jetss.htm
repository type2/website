<h3>Carburetor Jetting</h3>
<p>by David Schwarze and Barb and Eric</p>
<hr size="2">
<p><font size="+1">David Schwarze writes:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">A while ago someone on the list mentioned that
the stock 72-74 bus dual Solex carbs used the same jets as Mikuni
carbs and that they might be available at a motorcycle shop. This
in response to someone (maybe me?) who was expressing dismay at the
fact that jets for the Solexes are very hard to come by. Well
whoever that person was, I want to buy them lunch! I stopped by a
Yamaha dealer today and asked to see Mikuni carb jets, and the guy
brought out a box from behind the counter which contained hundreds
of shiny gold jets in at least 50 different sizes, which looked to
be functionally identical to one of my old Solex jets that I
brought with me for comparison. Eureka!!! Only drawback was the
price - $9.95 each. Ouch. Fortunately the guy cut me a quantity
discount on four jets (two 132.5 and two 142.5) and I left without
my wallet stinging too badly.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I have to give credit to Dave Kautz, if he's
still on the list, for getting me started messing with the jets. I
hate to admit it but before I heard him talking about jet sizes on
the list I don't think I even knew what sizes of jets were in my
carbs. Jets were something that I didn't need to mess with, or so I
thought.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Eventually, in the quest for a better running
bus, I saw the error of my ways and started experimenting with jet
sizing. I'm only talking main jets here, the air correction jets
are something I still haven't figured out entirely. Anyway, I
started with 137.5 jets, which were the largest I could find. My
reasoning was that it was better to run rich than lean, since it
seems to be generally well known that a lean-running engine will
run hotter than one that runs rich.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The bus ran okay with the 137.5's but I had a
set of 130s also so I tried them for a while. I found that my
mileage increased substantially and the bus ran well up to about
7000 ft elevation, although the CHT increased somewhat. I ran the
130s until last month when I put the 137.5s back in because of
driveability problems in the colder winter weather. My guess is
that the 130s combined with the cold air caused the mixture to lean
out to the point that the engine wouldn't run right. I believe Dave
Kautz told me that he runs 132.5 mains and I gathered that those
would be about perfect for me as well if I could find them. Today I
found them.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">But why the 142.5s? Last Spring I got my
original tranny rebuilt, which has rather short gears in it. In
order to maintain 65mph on the freeway the engine has to turn about
4000 rpm. I haven't tried to figure it out, but 1 liter
displacement at 4000 rpm pulling through a 26mm venturi (in the
carb) seemed like a large bottleneck. The engine seems to run best
in the 3500-3800rpm range now, and falls flat on it's face just
before 4000 rpm.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">So soon after the tranny was rebuilt, I started
thinking about ways to make the engine breathe a little better up
top. I considered converting to fuel injection, getting bigger
carbs, or trying larger venturis in the stock carbs. Since the last
solution was the easiest and cheapest, I tried it right away. I got
a set of venturis out of some junk carbs and hollowed them out to
about 28mm. The extra 2mm would get me 8% more airflow, which I
figured should move my powerband up about 300 rpm. Put them back in
the bus and it idled fine but had no power. I was getting ready to
leave for a trip to California so I just put the stock venturis
back in and forgot about the whole thing for a while.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Some time later I started thinking about why the
bus wouldn't run well with the bigger venturis. It didn't take me
long to realize... I was still using the 130 jets! There was more
air going through without more fuel, which meant that it was simply
running too lean. How could I have been so stupid to have
overlooked that? (don't answer that!) I did some quick figuring and
came up with 142.5 jets with 28mm venturis being an approximate
match for 130 jets in 26mm venturis. I was only sort of excited
about this since I didn't have a source for the 142.5 jets, but
that problem has been taken care of. I probably should have gone
for 145s since if my calculations are correct the 142.5s will be a
little lean, but if it looks like it's going to work I can always
go back and get the 145s and still come out way cheaper than a set
of dual Webers.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">So tomorrow the Grand Experiment will take
place. I will yank the stock carbs, put 28mm venturis in place of
the 26s and 142.5 jets in place of the 130s. If all goes well, I
should end up with more horsepower, a higher freeway cruising
speed, and slightly worse mileage. I will report back to the list
with the results, good or bad, as soon as they become
obvious.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Barb and Eric write:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">You are right that running rich is better than
lean, but over time running rich can ruin the rings by washing the
oil away with the extra fuel. Checking your spark plugs for how
your bus is running is important. You mention a main jet size you
went to that worked well except in the high RPMs, the main jet
probably was correct. When the engine enters the higher RPMs the
air correction jet goes to work adding more fuel. You might want to
try a higher # air correction jet, this has a smaller dia. hole in
it's top which allows less air into it. Also important to have your
volumn control screw adjusted correctly. There are three jets and
two adjustable screws jets and all must be taken into account not
just one, for each affects different operations of the carb. It is
a bit of a juggling act, but if you look at the whole picture it is
easy to adjust here and there for the desired affect. You might
want to check all your jets and compare them to the recomended
stock jets first then experiment a little with each.</font></p>
