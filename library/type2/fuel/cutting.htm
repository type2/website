<h3>Cutting out at Idle</h3>
<p>by Robert S. Hoover</p>
<hr size="2">
<p><font size="+1">In a message dated 98-11-04 01:12:15 EST, you
write:</font></p>
<blockquote><font size="+1"><i>"I have a problem with my 1200 Bug
(as always). You might remember that I had my inlet manifold
changed due to an air leak in it, well after that, my bug was
running fine, and then after about 6 weeks starting cutting out at
idle speed. The Carburettor was removed and the jets cleaned, and
other new parts installed from a "carburettor rebuild kit". Once
again she was fine for a few weeks, but now is again cutting out at
idle thus forcing me to constantly keep my foot on the gas pedal
even in Neutral. The only possibility I can think of is that my 27
year old Carb might be on it's last legs and need replacing. Is
there anyway to tell whether it is this, as a new solex carb is
quite expensive and I don't want to replace mine only to continue
having the problem. Also is the stock Solex 30Pict3 the best Carb
for my stock engine?"</i></font></blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Before spending any money on carburetors lets
take another look at the problem.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Your carburetor is a fuel METERING device. (Many
think its only function is to MIX fuel and air, a task largely
accomplished in the manifold.) Barring damage due to corrosion or
excessive wear of the throttle-shaft bearing, the typical symptom
associated with advanced age is for the carb to run TOO RICH rather
than too lean.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Since you've not mentioned smoke or other
symptoms of rich-running, and since failure to idle is usually the
result of improper timing or too lean a mixture -- and since I know
you've already checked your timing, plugs and so forth... (you
HAVE, haven't you? :-) -- let's take a look at what might produce a
lean burn.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Mention 'lean' and the first thing people think
of is that the carb must be providing too little fuel -- especially
when the problem goes away when you hold the throttle open a bit
wider. But the other half of the equation is air. Rather than too
LITTLE fuel, you may be getting to MUCH air. Indeed, this is the
common cause of this complaint and for a very simple
reason.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">At idle-speeds the throttle-plate is almost
fully closed. This reduces the flow of air thru the carburetor (and
activates the low-speed fuel-delivery circuit) but it also lowers
the vacuum in the intake manifold, far lower than when the engine
is running at maximum rpm. Under those condition it is quite common
for the engine to draw in an excess amount of air -- so-called
'vacuum leaks' -- at the gasketed flange under the carb, through
leaky hoses, or where the ends of the manifold attach to the
cylinder heads.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">AND around the shaft of the throttle plate, if
the bore is excessively worn.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">You can check for such vacuum leaks by squirting
a bit of WD-40 on the suspect areas. If they are leaking, the sound
of the engine will change when it sucks in some of the WD-40 (which
is mostly kerosene). You'll get a bit of white smoke if the leak is
very large.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">After 27 years of service I would expect your
carburetor's throttle-shaft bore to show considerable wear -- and
to be sucking excess air at low rpm. This should be the first thing
to check. If the throttle-shaft bore is worn, the proper repair is
to install a 'bushing-kit', once standard stuff when there was a VW
dealer in every town, now so rare most people have never even heard
of such kits. (Hold the throttle full open [ie, with the
throttle-plate vertical] and see if there is any play where the
shaft passes through the casting of the carburetor
body.)</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Re-bushing a carb isn't difficult -- nowadays
they use metal-filled epoxies to hold the new bushings in place.
But if you've never done the job and can't find a bushing kit,
you're facing quite a task. For a quick fix, build an external
'seal' around the leaky bore using RTV. When the rubber compound
cures, you can still move the throttle (albeit stiffly) but the RTV
will greatly reduce -- and often stop -- air being sucked in around
the throttle- shaft bore (be sure to do both sides).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The other areas where an air leak might occur
are easier to repair, the answer being the proper installation of a
new gasket, replacement of a hose and so forth.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">But as to age effecting your carb, other than
internal corrosion or ovaling out the throttle-shaft bore, carbs
are relatively 'ageless'. When metering gasoline, wear of a brass
orifice is a function of pressure and flow-rate. On a carb, both
are quite low. I think you'd need to run about 25,000 gallons of
gasoline thru the main-jet before you'd begin to notice erosion of
the orifice... and any erosion would tend to ENRICHEN the mixture
rather than cause it to run lean (the low-speed circuit draws its
fuel thru the main-jet). But the truth is, when running at highway
speeds, a good percentage of the fuel burned does not flow thru the
main jet but is discharged directly into the carburetor's throat
from the spray-bars in the high-power circuit... and from the
accelerator-pump outlet. Erosion in these areas would have no
effect on low-speed operation.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">In any case, the main-jet, pilot-jet (ie,
low-speed jet) and emulsion tube are replaceable. IF you suspect
erosion, replace them. The cost of a set of jets is a pittance
compared to a new carb. But the odds are, they don't need to be
replaced.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Contaminants such as dust and rust could cause
blockage of the smaller passages in the low-speed circuit and might
give rise to a lean idle (usually, they block the circuit
completely -- it does not run at all) but the cause of such
problems is clearly evident on inspection (ie, rust in the
float-bowl [which you can drain & inspect without dismounting or
dismantling the carb], rust in the fuel-pump filter, or dust around
the upper orifice of the emulsion tube) and responds to proper
maintenance -- repair of the fuel tank in the case of rust and of
the air-filter with regard to dust. I know you've just cleaned your
carb but if the problem had to do with rust or dust, and if you
have not dealt with the root problem, you are back to where you
were a few weeks ago -- you must clean the carb again. But this
time, also take care of the root problem.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The Solex carburetor is more robust than most
realize. (And more resistant to blockage. By design, the mesh of
the fuel-pump filter is smaller than any of the jets & orifices
[pull it out, see for yourself].) But like any carb, your Solex
requires its fair share of maintenance. And carbs do wear out, like
any other part of your vehicle. But when repairs were needed, Solex
carbs were meant to be overhauled, not thrown away.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">As to a 30-PICT-3, I think this would be a poor
choice for a 1200cc engine. The 28-PCI (ie, manual choke) or -PICT
(electric choke) would be a better choice, followed by any of the
other 'round-bowl' carbs. The 30-PICT-3 (I think this was the first
of the 'square-bowl' carbs) incorporates a special 'low-emission'
low-speed circuit. For this new low-speed circuit to function
properly there must be a certain minumim rate-of-flow thru the
carburetor. At idle, the flow-rate provided by a 1200cc engine is
probably too low to insure stable operation of the low-speed
circuit found on these 'low- emission' carbs. (The 'square-bowl'
carbs were used on the 1500 & 1600cc engines.)</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">To sum up, your symptoms are most likely being
caused by an excess of air rather than a lack of fuel. Before
spending any money on repairs, make sure you have accurately
diagnosed the root problem. With rare exception, age alone is not
grounds for condemning a part, especially one designed to be
repaired.</font></p>
