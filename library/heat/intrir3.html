Preparation</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">For those of you who are visual learners and
have been pleased-as punch about the cornucopia of visual support,
stay tuned, there's more to come. Just not in this "interior
panels" section. I guess we did not take any photos of this
phase/task. That's okay, You'll get it anyway! Here
goes:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">After removing the interior panels, we
carefully removed all of the ducting/door handles, etc, and the
clips from the periphery of the panels. Next we cut/ripped off all
of the revolting, repugnant, offensive brown vinyl.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">This left us with large sheets of neatly cut
pressboard with strategically drilled holes, and a large pile of
revolting, repugnant, offensive brown vinyl. We promptly threw the
revolting, repugnant, offensive brown vinyl in the Dumpster, (which
sounded remarkably like our bus when we closed the
door).</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">We selected a durable coarseweave upholstery
fabric, from Mill Outlet Cloth, in Greenville, NC, and bought (I
think) 12 yards of the stuff, plus the material for the curtains,
and material to cover the folding bed. Value-shoppers paradise.
$100 for the bunch.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">We also purchased 13 yards of 1/2" thick FELT
carpet padding to use as padding behind the upholstery material
(NOT the foam rubber stuff).</font> <font face="Arial" color=
"#FF0000">This felt padding is important</font><font face="Arial">.
It is adhered to the face of the panel behind the upholstery, where
it deadens any vibration in the panel, and serves to absorb any
resonant noise inside the cabin.</font></p>
<p align="center"><img src="line1.gif" width="623" height="7"></p>
<p align="center"><font size="6">Interior Panels, Applying Felt
Padding</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Using the interior panels as a template, we
cut the felt, and adhered it with spray adhesive to the panels.
IMPORTANT: once you have fastened the felt soundly to the panels
and allowed the panels to cure (a day), you must take a sharp pair
of shears and bevel the edges of the felt everywhere the fabric
will wrap around. Here's a close-up: (our visual learners are
saying, "Thank God!"</font></p>
<p><img src="Image39.gif" width="360" height="240"></p>
<p><font face="Arial">If you leave the felt edges square your
upholstered panels will look like Spanky & Alfalfa reupholstered
them. Unless this is the look you desire, bevel the edges. Don't
forget to go around the door latch holes, the window crank holes,
and the vent holes.</font></p>
<p align="center"><img src="line1.gif" width="623" height="7"></p>
<p align="center"><font size="6">Interior Panels, Cutting &
Applying Material</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Next, we cut the material. This takes
practice, of which we initially had none, but now we have plenty.
The material MUST be cut <b><i>on the bias</i></b>. I have no idea
what that means, but the lady who sold us the material repeated
those words like a mantra. "That material must be cut <b><i>on the
bias</i></b>". So make sure you do.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">We just made sure that the pattern on the
material ran straight along the panels (no 2 degree decline on one
panel, and a 4 degree incline on another). Cut the material to have
approximately 10 cm extra around ALL edges. You can always cut more
off, but you can't put it back.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Once you have the material cut, spray
adhesive the back of the fabric, and the felt face of the panel.
Leave the fabric lying on a smooth level surface. Line up the top
edge of the panel with the pattern in the material, and lay the
panel face down on the material. Step all over the panel to make
sure the adhesive sticks.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Next, spray adhesive on the back side
periphery of the panel about 2" from the edge, to the edge. Roll
the excess material from the face of the panel, and press it firmly
into the spray adhesive. Follow this immediately with a fusillade
of 4mm staples from a staple gun to tack everything in
place.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">I used a manual staple gun for this. After
stapling the edges of all 13 panels, my right arm looked like
Popeye's arm, while my left still looked like my everyday left arm
(a lot like Arnold Schwartzenegar's arm, but without all the
muscles).</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">As you fasten the material around curves
(like corners, the round curve at the bottom of the door, etc.) you
will have to gather and cut material, or create relief cuts.
However, this is really getting WAY beyond the scope of the
Rust/Noise/Heat thing, so I'll leave you to figure that out with
the help of your local upholstery shop.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Similar to the shoemaker, you will find the
people at the upholstery shop euphorically friendly. I believe it
is because they are surrounded by materials and adhesives
that</font> <b><i><font face="Arial" size="4">off-gas</font></i>
<font face="Arial">all manner of potent chemicals throughout the
workday. If you value recognizing your own name, don't stay in
there very long...</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Arial">We replaced all the clips, and the little
black rubber prophylactics that go into the door to hold the clips
out of the weather. Once the interior walls of the bus were
soundproofed, undercoated, insulated, and vapor barriered, we
reinstalled the panels.</font></p>
</ul>
<p align="center"><img src="line1.gif" width="623" height="7"></p>
<ul>
<p align="center"><font size="6">The Floor and Front End</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Okay, we've got pictures of this
stuff.</font></p>
<p><img src="Image42.gif" width="420" height="276"></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Boy! This photo has lots of stuff in it.
First, notice the front panel (where the headlight buckets are) has
been covered with Q-pads, Kool Patch, and shiny NASA insulation.
This same treatment eventually was applied to the floorboards in
this area, as well. The interior of the driver's door is black
because its interior surface is covered first with Q-Pads, then two
layers of Kool patch have been applied. Other than shooting Great
Stuff expansion foam into the void ABOVE the door's window, and
making a new vapor barrier for the door, that is all you can for
the front door. Let me repeat that. DO NOT do anything else to the
front doors. They are part of the vacuum-force ventilation system,
and must "breathe". Plus, you have to be able to roll the window
down, PLUS it gets really wet inside the door.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The Driver's seat has been diassembled and
re-stuffed (MUCH more comfy!). There is a large McDonald's cup,
belying my extreme thirst in the July heat. The passenger side seat
arch is covered with Q-Pads and Kool Patch. You see my boom-box
leaned up between the seats. Finally, there are two cans (lower
left) of foam expansion sealant ready to fill the voids somewhere,
(probably the void over the top of the windows in the door; this
required a long hose, and some patience). There is a leather glove
and rags next to the cans of foam. You will need both.</font></p>
<p><img src="Image43.gif" width="415" height="211"></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Here we see that the side panels are
re-installed, the Q-Pads and Kool Patch are on the floor/inclined
area, and a single layer of NASA insulation covers the floor. Two
layers will cover the central portion of the inclined area (between
wheel arches) as this is a VERY warm and resonant area of the body.
Both layers were adhered with the aluminum facing out. We used
spray adhesive on all of the inclined areas to hold the insulation
in place, then used duct tape to seal the edges, and to give a tidy
finish. We used cardboard on the floor while installing so we
didn't tear the aluminum facing on the NASA insulation.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">By-in-large, that is the finished product,
(prior to carpet/padding, etc). The floor is covered with Q-Pads,
Kool Patch and NASA insulation, the panels are reinstalled. You can
make of one of the luggage anchors in the middle of the bulkhead
(right side of photo). We installed seven of these in discrete, yet
useful locations.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">You can also make out the heat recirculation
duct sticking up behind the spare tire well. More on that in the
"heat" section.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">One little detail has to fit somewhere, so
I'll mention it here. We sprayed all of the seams (including the
exterior body seams) with a product called "Rust Preventative" by
3M. It goes on as thin fluid (like WD-40) then dries to a waxy,
oily, pasty goo. It is difficult to wipe off, and dispatches water
with tremendous vigor. All of the door surrounds, the sliding door
rails, and any other nooks and crannies got a thorough dousing.
Cheap. About $5.00 for a can. Took two cans, although I used it as
deodorant twice.</font></p>
