Noise Proofing</font></b></p>
</ul>

<p align="center"><font size="6">Initial Conditions</font></p>
<ul>
<p><font face="Arial">Okay, in the first section, we isolated most
of the motor noise, and eliminated all the body "voids" as a place
for rust and noise to hide. We talked about Agents Scully and
Muldore. We trapped the infrared heat and clatter of the motor with
NASA insulation, and we wrapped the exhaust system with insulating
fiberglass webbing to boost HP, lower head temps, and increase heat
for our interior.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Prepare to be amazed at VW's lack of
soundproofing/thermal insulation in the rest of the
body.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Currently loading below: pictures of the
interior of the bus with all the panels out�see any insulation or
rustproofing? To think that this bare sheet metal was simply topped
with a cardboard/vinyl overlay; this actually
<b><i>enhanced</i></b> the resonance of the cabin interior.
Ugh.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">What is amazing is the lack of rust in this
vehicle. We were very lucky in this. VW put a lot of faith in their
paint alone to defy rust. It worked on this
California/Texas/Oklahoma van. Those vans who grew up in
Vermont/Iowa/Michigan were not so lucky, and now many are
artificial reefs and backyard storage sheds.</font></p>

"Image29.gif" width="388" height="250"></p>
<p><img src="Image30.gif" width="215" height="299"><font face=
"Arial">No wonder it sounds like a trash can; it is built like one;
bare, rattley sheet metal all the way around. The only noise
proofing is the felt tape on the wheel arches, and plastic/felt
crap on the air intake housing (rear of cargo area). You will see a
much different picture when we are done. (The black square in the
middle of the lower photo (above) is the first step in our noise
proofing, Q-Pads, more on that in a minute).</font></p>
</ul>

<p align="center"><font size="6">Important Concepts</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Recall these graphics from the index
page:</font></p>
<p><img src="Image10.gif" width="360" height="240"><img src=
"Image11.gif" width="360" height="240"></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Now take a minute to study what we will apply
here:</font></p>
<p><img src="Image48.gif" width="360" height="240"><img src=
"Image49.gif" width="360" height="240"></p>
<p><font face="Arial">For the sake of drawing, it would appear that
our floors and walls are now 6" thick. Not the case. In fact, those
of you who have seen this bus (at Buggout, etc.) can testify, you
cannot see tell tale signs of this insulation, only a nicely
upholstered interior. The clue comes you slam a door, and hear the
solid, "thunk", or ride down the highway, and talk in
conversational tones at 70 mph.</font></p>
</ul>
<p align="center"><img src="line1.gif" width="623" height="7"></p>
<p align="center"><font size="6">How did you do it?</font></p>
<ul>
<p><font face="Arial">We started with Q-pads from
Evercoat.</font></p>
<p><img src="Image53.gif" width="228" height="114"><font face=
"Arial">(Graphics and link shamelessly absconded with from Evercoat
website)</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">What you see in the photo below is a
self-adhesive, 3-millimeter-thick tile made of asphalt/rubber
emulsion, sold under the name Q-Pads, by</font> <a href=
"http://www.evercoat.com/">Evercoat</a><font face="Arial">. These
absolutely deaden vibration/resonance in metal. Similar products
are used by all automotive manufactures. The more luxurious the car
(like a Lincoln or Rolls) the more of these pads will cover
exposed, interior sheet metal.</font></p>
You heat them gently (in the oven at about 38 C, or 100 F) and they
conform to the ripples and chinks in the body, and stick
permanently. We put them EVERYWHERE. Inside the front doors, on the
floor, in the sliding door, everywhere. They are permanent, bonding
edge to edge to the sheet metal; impossible to remove, once placed.
I recently tried to remove a small section of Q-Pad to install the
rear seat (for selling the van); it took me an hour with a putty
knife and some choice swearing to make two wee holes. Tough stuff.
During installation (while they are warm) is the time to cut any
holes, etc.
<p><img src="Image31.gif" width="658" height="394"></p>
<p><font face="Arial">This Q-Pad is installed on the wheel arch
under the driver's seat. It is that thick black tile stuck to the
sheet metal. (Yes, that is my <b><i>actual</i></b> hand, not a
stuntman or body double's�) We covered this area with NASA
Insulation, and duct taped the edges. We did not order the
replacement rubber mat to cover all this, although that was the
plan.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">We covered the floor, front and rear wheel
arches, and walls with Q-Pads. The inclined area between the rear
wheel arches got two layers, as that area appeared to be the most
offending for resonance from the motor/transmission.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">You can find Q-Pads at Auto Body Supply
houses. We found ours at "</font><a href=
"http://www.co.fairfax.va.us/gov/bos/summary/1993/93-01-25.htm">Mattos
Paint and (other stuff</a><b><i><font face=
"Arial">)</font></i><font face="Arial">" in Alexandria, VA (you'll
have to "Find" Mattos on that web page). Unfortunately, they do not
give this product away, though I did ask.</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Arial">They said "No, they are about $40 for a box
of four tiles, so pay up or scram." The thinner tiles, used for the
walls, (about 1.5 mil. thick) come six to a box, and are about $25
a box. Either way, this was among the greatest outlays for a single
product in our project. I think we used eight or ten boxes.
Critical though, and worth every cent.</font></p>
