Heat for your 1960-1983 VW Bus</font></b></p>
</ul>

<p align="center"><font size="6">Initial Discussion</font></p>
<ul>
<p><font face="Arial">Let's get to it... VW bus heat is not a bad
design. It is just poorly executed. Later model years (1976-1983.5)
can literally heat you out of the van in a few minutes! If we
remedy certain problems with Bus heat, it works great. Beyond the
long-term service we needed, the big motivation for this fix was
our planned 9,000 mile honeymoon across the USA (Oct-Dec 1997) I
knew it would be COLD. It was. We weren't.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Loading below is a big diagram of your
heating system, and the way we fixed it. While it loads, lets look
at the problems with the VW heating system (starting from the rear,
where the heat starts, and moving forward):</font></p>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><font face="Arial" color="#800000">The engine-cooling fan is
insufficient to move air to the front of the van (20' total) at any
appreciable velocity. This is worse if you are in stop-and-go
traffic, and the fan is not rotating quickly.</font></li>
<li><font face="Arial" color="#800000">Air leaks in the tin ware
loose valuable volumes of air.</font></li>
<li><font face="Arial" color="#800000">The supplemental fan
promotes the velocity, but like the engine-cooling fan, it sucks in
cold air. If it is -20 degrees outside, both the engine fan and the
supplementary fan are gulping -20 degree air, and trying to warm it
up to 90-110 degrees, to warm up you and your cavernous
van.</font></li>
<li><font face="Arial" color="#800000">The exhaust extractors and
J-tubes loose heat before going through the heat exchangers. Wasted
heat.</font></li>
<li><font face="Arial" color="#800000">The heat exchangers, heat
risers, flapper boxes, ducting, and valves are all located in the
frigid airstream under the van.</font></li>
<li><font face="Arial" color="#800000">The heat risers, flapper
boxes, ducting, and valves are all pathetically insulated. They are
often very warm to the touch when the heater is running, and it is
freezing out. More wasted heat.</font></li>
<li><font face="Arial" color="#800000">The drop in velocity through
the long ducting allows for greater heat loss. More wasted
heat.</font></li>
<li><font face="Arial" color="#800000">Low velocity, luke-warm air
is ineffective at: removing ice from a windshield, warming your
toes, or keeping your loved ones from seeing their breath inside
your van.</font></li>
</ul>
<p align="center"><img src="line1.gif" width="622" height="5"></p>
<p align="center"><font size="6">Graphic and Description</font></p>
<ul>
<p><font face="Arial">Look at this:</font></p>
<p><img src="heatpp1.JPG" width="717" height="536" alt=
"Bus with stock, sorry heat"></p>
<p><font face="Arial">What you see here is your van. The bluish
discs in the rear represent your engine fan, and supplemental
blower. They input cold air into the rectangles, (your heat
exchangers), where it gets very hot in a hurry. From there it moves
forward, loosing heat and velocity as it goes.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">If you have ever felt the air coming directly
out of a stock, new heat exchanger, even when it is icy out, you
know what inspired our improvements. I have not measured the
temperature, but after a short trip down the highway, the air
coming out is hot enough to burn your hand. I would guess somewhere
around 140-160 degrees.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">As soon as this very hot air leaves the heat
exchanger, it flows through:</font></p>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><font face="Arial">an uninsulated tin tube,</font></li>
<li><font face="Arial">a uninsulated tin flapper box,</font></li>
<li><font face="Arial">a poorly insulated tin junction
box,</font></li>
<li><font face="Arial">a pitiable 17-foot paper duct,</font></li>
<li><font face="Arial">some more poorly-insulated tin
valves,</font></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<p><font face="Arial">and finally, what was left of your heat,
barely meanders out of the ducts, creating the vague scent of heat,
but little substantive warmth</font></p>
</ul>
<p align="center"><img src="line1.gif" width="622" height="5"></p>
<ul>
<p><font face="Arial">Here is what we envisioned and
created:</font></p>
<p><img src="heatpp2.JPG" width="714" height="534"></p>
<p><font face="Arial">If you didn't believe me before that I am not
a guru-web-designer, those graphics would convince you...don't know
what to do about that... anyway, I eliminated the engine fan for
clarity on the drawing. The engine fan is still on the van, and
functions as before.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">There's the conceptual. Now how'd we do that?
Right?</font></p>
</ul>
<p align="center"><img src="line1.gif" width="622" height="5"></p>
<p align="center"><font size="6">Getting started,
Undercoating</font></p>
<ul>
<p><font face="Arial">It's actually pretty simple, just time
consuming.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">First we removed everything that had to do
with heat on the van, including the BIG valve in the middle of the
van that looks like a rocket ship, and all of the paper-tube
ducting. We left the front (vertical) tube in, and the cables,
except for one, which we replaced.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">We bought new flapper valves, riser tubes,
exchangers, and a Diet Coke, because I was doing all of this work
in July and August. It was really hot out. While all of this stuff
was out from under the van, and since I had the front pan off, I
took the opportunity to undercoat the entire van twice with Kool
Patch.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">I think it took me about 15 seconds to write
the words "<b><i>I took the opportunity to undercoat the entire van
twice with Kool Patch</i></b>". It took however, an eternity to
undercoat that van. You will recall the consistency of Kool Patch
is roughly that of Chocolate Pudding with fiberglass threads in it,
just like Gramma used to make. Imagine for a moment the Sisyphusian
task of spreading chocolate pudding across an irregular surface
interrupted by projecting and overhanging immovable obstacles,
while laying on your back on hot asphalt in July in Northern
Virginia.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">This was a task fit for penitents and felons.
In the evening I would sip cool refreshment, look down at the bus
from the balcony, and contemplate ways I could safely roll the bus
over, undercoat it, and roll it back. In the end, I laid on my back
for a week or two after work.</font></p>
<p><img src="Image57.gif" width="420" height="263"><font face=
"Arial">While not showing much else, here is the visual result of
two layers of Kool Patch, one year after it was applied. Nuf
said.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">We wire-brushed and repainted the valves with
Rustoleum. We wrapped them in NASA insulation, carefully cutting
away the insulation where the cables attached. Last of all we
created a cocoon of duct-tape around each, to seal out
moisture.</font></p>
</ul>
<p align="center"><font size="6">Not to repeat myself�</font></p>
<ul>
<p><font face="Arial">Those of you who are frequent visitor to this
little site know that this page has remained stagnant for a while.
To put in more information QUICKLY, I have pasted below the
contents of an e-mail to someone who asked for more details. If I
repeat stuff above, sorry. I just don't have as much time as I used
to, but I want you and your family to be warm in your VW!!! Also,
my apologies for few pictures. I will try to scan a few of this
stuff and post in the coming weeks. Now here's the message I
sent�</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">A couple of years ago, my wife and I poured a
heap of $$$ into a 1976 van to preserve and improve it. The least
expensive aspect of the project was making the stock heater WORK.
When we were done, we were able to comfortably sit in shirt sleeves
in the van when it was 0 F degrees outside. In our 1982, the heat
coming out of the front ducts is now so hot, you cannot hold your
hand over it from more than a second or two. This, without adding
expensive or complicated furnaces, electric heaters, etc. I have
cc:d the type 2 list with this note, although I am not currently on
that list.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">I built a website that chronicles to whole
project http://www.bulley-hewlett.com/VWindex . Since some of the
early parts of the project contributed to our heater�s performance
(like fully insulating the body), I would recommend at least
scanning the pages from start to finish, so you get the baseline
info you need. You don�t need to do all the stuff to drastically
improve your heater�s performance. The "heat" portion of the site
is only partially complete, but I will fill in some details below.
There is a graphic (on the heat page) that shows all the components
of the stock system. And the changes we made. The text below
relates to that graphic.</font></p>
</ul>
<p align="center"><font size="6">What's wrong with my
heat???</font></p>
<ul>
<p><font face="Arial">First, here are the things that can prohibit
the stock, VW air-cooled heat from effectively heating your van
(starting from the source, to the vents (**items require
modification):</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" color="#800000">1. **Failure in design to
recycle heated air from inside cabin (all air pulled into heater is
ambient, COLD air)</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" color="#800000">2. (some models) Lack of
blower (auxiliary blower) to push air through heater boxes.The
stock cooling fan IS NOT ENOUGH for the 1960-1979 bus. Only in 1976
did VW add an electric pusher fan, and in 1980 added (the best
idea) a belt-driven fan.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" color="#800000">3. Leaks in ducting leading
to heater boxes.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" color="#800000">4. Leaks in heater
boxes.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" color="#800000">5. Leaky seams around heat
riser tubes (run from boxes to heat valves �flapper
boxes�).</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" color="#800000">6. **un-insulated heat riser
tubes</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" color="#800000">7. Un-adjusted, leaky, or
non-functional flapper box valves.</font></p>
<p><font face=
"Arial">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Now up to that point, if you have one, or
many of these problems, you don�t actually have a complete heater.
That is, you aren�t actually capturing the enormous amount of heat
available from your exhaust system. Now here�s the rest of the
list:</font></p>
<p><font face=
"Arial">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" color="#800000">8. un-insulated heater duct
mufflers (those black plastic accordion looking things).</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" color="#800000">9. Leaky junctions in main
pipe</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" color="#800000">10. Leaks or tears in main
pipe</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" color="#800000">11. un-insulated main
pipe</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" color="#800000">12. **front auxiliary fan to
suck heat forward</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" color="#800000">13. **un-insulated van, which
allows ALL heat to leak directly back to the atmosphere without
impediment.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Some of the above call for complicated
efforts. Some are quite inexpensive and easy to accomplish. In the
near future, our site will go into great depth on ALL of the above
with photos and diagrams just like on the rest of our site. For
now, here is a "quick hit" all air cooled folks can enjoy, with
nominal expense/effort. The stuff with **two asterisks takes a
little more time and effort, and should wait until after you have
tried the cheap and easy stuff in your environment. Unless you live
in Saskatchewan, the cheap stuff will prolly do the
trick.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The greatest impact you can have on your
1976-1983.5 VW bus without heroic expense and effort, is adjusting
the flappers, and insulating the ducting. It will cost about $19,
and will take about 5-6 hours. Assuming that your heater
boxes/flappers are in good shape, this project will DRAMATICALLY
increase the heat in your van. Fair enough? Good.</font></p>
</ul>
<p align="center"><font size="6">Objectives</font></p>
<ul>
<p><font face="Arial" color="#800000">What we are going to do:
Adjust the flappers, insulate the entire ducting system, from the
heat noise mufflers to the front of the van. For those of you who
aren�t Dennis, I am writing the instructions for a 1980 Vanagon.
Any type 2 van would be nearly identical, except the routing of the
hose over the fuel tank.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="6">&nbsp;</font></p>
</ul>
<p align="center"><font size="6">What items do I need to fix
it???</font></p>
<ul>
<p><font face="Arial">Here�s what you need.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">1. A 25� box of 4" Inside Diameter R-4.3 or
R-6 (if you can get it) insulated Mylar®-cased flexible household
ducting. (you can get this at an HVAC specialist. Home Deep-ho
won�t have the 4" ID, only 6". Remember, you want 4"!!!</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">2. A dozen 20" cable ties.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">3. Jack stands</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">4. A partner (for about 10
minutes)</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">5. Scissors, wire cutters, goggles, a
straight-blade screw driver, a pair of pliers, and a 6mm open
end/ring wrench</font></p>
</ul>
<p align="center"><font size="6">What do I do to fix
it???</font></p>
<ul>
<p><font face="Arial">(these instructions written for a Vanagon)
Jack up the van. Disconnect the battery. Get all your tools under
the van. Put on your goggles. Scoot under the van, and locate both
flappers.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">On the dashboard, have your partner fully
open and fully close the heater control lever in a continual
oscillation so you can inspect the flappers. On either side of, and
just above the transmission, look for a thin cable, connected to a
short (2") control arm by a spring and barrel bolt arrangement. The
control arm should be moving forward and aft, with the motion of
the cable as your partner opens and closes the valves.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">You want to make sure they FULLY OPEN when
the cable is under tension, and the control arm is FORWARD. You can
be sure they are fully open if, when your partner has the lever in
the fully open (HOT) position, you see the spring on the end of the
cable compress against the control arm. Alternatively, when the
cable is under tension, make sure there is no more than 1mm-2mm
additional movement the control arm �could� make, if the cable were
tighter. I have never seen a bus where these are properly adjusted,
unless the owner has recently done it.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">If the control arm isn�t opening the flappers
enough, you aren�t getting all the heat available. Using the 6mm
wrench, release the barrel bolts, and adjust the cables so that
when the dash lever is in the fully open position, the flapper
valves are fully open. Done? Great.</font></p>
</ul>
<p align="center"><font size="6">Let's insulate the
ducting!</font></p>
<ul>
<p><font face="Arial">Next, let�s insulate the ducting. Leave the
van on jack stands. We will start at the front.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Remove the spare tire from its carrier, and
remove the front grill. Behind the grill, release the clamp holding
the top of the duct to the plastic fitting that leads inside the
van. Release or cut the cable ties that hold the duct against the
body, and pull the duct gently down into the area where the spare
tire would normally lie. We will insulate from the front edge of
the fuel tank, to the fitting going into the dash. We won�t
insulate the duct going over the fuel tank, as it would be too
tight of a squeeze, and would probably cause rusting by holding
moisture against the top of the tank when it rains�</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Open the box of Mylar® ducting, and measure
out the same length PLUS 8" as the ducting under the van, from the
tank, to the fitting�remember, ADD 8". Cut the ducting with
scissors, and wire cutters. You will notice that this ducting has
four (or three, depending on manufacturer) layers:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">LAYER 1: an inside tube of wire-reinforced
Mylar,</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">LAYER 2: a thick bat of Fiberglas insulation
surrounding,</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">LAYER 3: a mesh of reinforcing cords, some
manufacturers don�t use the reinforcing mesh. It doesn�t matter for
our use. And</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">LAYER 4: a sturdy outside casing of thick
Mylar.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">This ducting will fit PERFECTLY over your
existing paper ducting. Slide the entire group (all four layers) of
new ducting over the old ducting. Now comes the IMPORTANT part. You
MUST seal the new ducting so that water can�t seep in, and get to
the fiberglass. At the fuel tank end, trim Layers 1, 2, and 3 back
to about 1" from the place where you will stop insulating (probably
just about over the front axle). This should leave about 3" of
layer 4 to seal against the original paper ducting. Neatly gather
layer 4 so that all of the extra Mylar is at the bottom of the
duct. Using your cable ties, secure layer four against the dusting,
and trim off any excess Mylar.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">On the other end of the duct, perform
virtually the same sealing procedure, trimming back the inside
layer, leaving the outside protective layer. But you can use the
existing screw clamp to seal the ducting as it passes into the
body. Make sure you can feel fiberglass batting evenly around the
entire length of the duct, that there are no "bunches" and no bare
spots. Adjust the insulation as needed. Replace any cable ties that
held the ducting. The outside protective ducting should be smooth,
not wrinkly and slack, but not TIGHT. Tah-dah! That was easy,
huh?</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Follow the same procedure for the main duct,
running from the junction box (just in front of the transmission)
to the rear of the fuel tank. Use cable ties to seal the tank end,
and the existing screw clamp at the rear. Make sure you re-hang the
duct securely with a couple cable ties.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The procedure is a little different for the
black plastic heat noise mufflers. Remove the mufflers completely
by releasing the screw clamps, and gently pushing the mufflers off
the junction box, and the flappers. Make sure you include the
silicone rubber seals with the mufflers.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Again, cut ducting +8". This time, remove the
inside tube (LAYER 1) completely from the new ducting, leaving only
the fiberglass batting, the mesh, and the outside Mylar. Slide
these three layers over the mufflers, and neatly gather the Mylar
to pass UNDER the screw clamps that hold the mufflers to the
flappers/junction box. Make sure the clamps are still loose enough
to allow you to fit the mufflers. Trim off the extra Mylar. I�m no
dope smoker, but if you do this right, the results will look like a
couple of big, fat joints.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Re-install the mufflers back on the van, and
tighten the clamps. Tah-Dah!!!!! That�s it. You have just insulated
most of your ducting. Unless, you want to get REALLY gung-ho, and
insulate the junction box, which helps a lot, that is it. Take the
van off the jack stands, take of your goggles, and hook the battery
back up.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Now here is the fun. Start the van, and go
for a spin with the heat on. Did you have to open a window? Next,
WITH CAUTION, slide up under the van, and feel the difference in
temperature between the outside of the insulated ducting, and the
un-insulated portions (over the fuel tank, or at the junction box).
Amazing, huh? All the heat going to waste.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Don�t throw that extra ducting away, as you
will need some of it for the next "phase" of this project,
recirculating the heat�that is another day though�.</font></p>
