<B><CENTER>A Roof Rack over the Long Style '68-up Bus Poptop</CENTER></FONT>
<FONT SIZE=4>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The search for a suitable rack to use above my '71 poptop Westfalia began after I acquired an 
old 15 foot Grumman canoe. The small, stock "luggage rack" on the rear of the '68-72  (front of 
the '73-79) full length poptop Westfalias is inadequate for such items as canoes or other loads 
with large girth.  Researching the type2 and vanagon archives I found other poptop owners 
either used aftermarket racks or fabricated their own to suit their needs .  
The large poptop Westfalia  is a special case when it comes to adapting an aftermarket roof 
rack.  The extra height of the poptop necessitates taller feet to mount on the rain gutters, and 
the curvature of the feet must not conflict with the top as well. As I was investigating the 
possibilities and weighing my options, I was blessed with a generous gift from a local friend 
and type2 listmember, Greg Kriss.  Greg has a '71 hardtop Westfalia patiently awaiting 
resurrection and had recently dismantled a '68 poptop Westfalia that came with a roof rack.  He 
acquired the rack unmounted to the '68, but noted that it was tall enough to clear the poptop.  
Here's a photo of it mounted on my bus. 
<P>
<img class="img-responsive" SRC="images/buscanoe.jpg" ALT= "canoe mounted on rack">
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's a stock tubular steel rack that was offered as an option for 68-79 bus hardtops 
(and split window buses).  It came in 1/3, 2/3 and full length 
varieties, with 4, 6, and 8 feet respectively.   This one is a 2/3 version that was modified with 
extenders just above the feet to clear the poptop.  Greg and I originally thought these extenders 
might have been an optional kit to modify a hardtop rack for use over a poptop bus, but from my subsequent 
research it seems more likely that this was just a wonderfully fashioned addition made by the 
DPO (in this case, Dear Previous Owner!).  The six feet were cut three inches up from their base and a 
4 inch aluminum rod extender of the same diameter as the feet tubing was added between the foot 
and the rack (4 inches between foot and rack tube--the extender itself is about a half inch longer on
either end but these sections were turned down to fit within the tube so they do not add height to the
rack).  The nice touch was that each extender was bent exactly the same to match the 
contour of the rack as it ascends the roof line.   It appears the ends were turned down on a lathe 
so they fit snugly into the steel tubing and the extender was then secured on either end with a 
stainless steel bolt and nut.  The nicest part of this modification is that although the rack was 
cut for this operation, it was done cleanly, and by removing the spacer the foot can easily be 
welded back to the rack to re-establish its original height for stock use on a hardtop bus. 
<P>

<P>
<img class="img-responsive" SRC="images/roof4.jpg" ALT= "later style clamps">
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I consider the tradeoff of eliminating the functionality of the poptop for the cargo capacity of 
the rack to be a good one, though I realize other poptop owners find this odd or unacceptible 
for their own circumstances (see the other options below).  To understand the factors 
influencing me (aside from a free rack and the desire to bring my canoe to a river as soon as 
possible!), consider that  the '68-'72 poptops have notoriously uncomfortable cots.  The other 
function of the top, to provide overhead space when camping, is not particularly important to 
our camping needs.  Often we're in a rest area where we don't pop the top, and under more 
typical camping circumstances we don't mind the lack of head room.  The fantastic benefit to 
the rack is that it easily carries the 50 lb canoe (and plenty of other gear at the same time) and it 
is extremely sturdy with plenty of locations for tying items down.  Another benefit is that a 
15 foot canoe is mounted high enough on this rack so that you can open the rear hatch completely without
worrying about hitting the door or its glass against the overhanging end of the canoe. Aside from losing poptop 
functions, the only other drawback is reduced clearance.  Without a load, I can clear 8' 6" 
overhangs with about 3 inches to spare.  I now share the concerns of a hightop camper owner in 
that I must be cautious about low overhangs and parking garages  (but unlike hightop owners, I 
can remove my rack if  I needed clearance on a regular basis).   
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm using 2 different styles of stock clamps that I modified to use with this taller rack.  Six of 
either clamp would work, but I had 3 of each type so I used the items at hand and mounted 
three of one style on one side of the bus and the three of the other style on the opposite side.  
Here are some photos of the clamps I adapted to use with the taller than stock rack.  Neither the 
rack or the clamps were physically modified, I simply added hardware as pictured to 
compensate for the height difference. 
<P>
<img class="img-responsive" SRC="images/roof3.jpg" ALT= "wishbone clamp close-up">
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the wishbone style clamp, I just used two pieces of threaded rod, one passing through the 
eyelet on the rack, the other threaded into the clamp.  They meet parallel at the center (thanks 
to coincidence or masterful planning in calculating the necessary extender height by the rack's 
previous owner) and I attached them via a thick piece of metal and nuts.  Before this rack was 
modified with the extender, the rack would normally sit on a hardtop bus so that one threaded 
rod can pass straight from the clamp to the rack eyelet.  The change of height changed the 
relative position of the eyelet.  Also due to good planning or coincidence, the bolt head and nut 
used to secure the extender to the rack and foot just clears the clamp. 
<P>
<img class="img-responsive" SRC="images/roof2.jpg" ALT= "later clamp close-up">
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the tall clamp with the rubberized foot I bought the longest off the shelf threaded eye bolt I 
could find at Home Depot.  I had to extend this a bit on the threaded end that meets the clamp.  
On the rack side I bent open the eye end and hung it off the outer tube on the rack, then bent it 
back and welded it together. 
<P>
<B>Other "Real Roof rack" Options for '68-79 long poptop Westfalia Owners</B>
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here are some 
other options I investigated that might better suit other poptop owners' individual needs for 
an additional rack: 
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yakima and Thule make "artificial raingutters" that bolt to the poptop and the feet that bear 
the load bars mount to those.  For a poptop camper bus, Thule recommends feet #300 for use 
with their #542 artificial  rain gutter brackets and 58" load bars.  This requires you to drill 
holes in your fiberglas top and back the holes with a reinforcement plate.  The good:  the 
poptop can be raised with a load (albeit with extra effort) to use the upper bed since everything 
is attached to the top and not the rain gutters.  The Bad: verify that the hardware securing the 
poptop to the bus roof is in good shape as this could become a weak link now that the poptop is 
bearing extra weight.  Also, the Thule catalog mentions not to mount a load greater than skis or 
two bikes with this setup, but the type2 archives show that in practice people have carried more 
than that. 
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thule Super high feet #953 will mount to the bus's rain gutters and will extend over the '68-72 
poptop (despite what their catalog indicates), allowing the load bars to clear.  The good: the 
poptop doesn't require modification and using the top requires only removal of the load (canoe, 
etc.) and one load bar.  Without a load the clearance isn't reduced by much since the load bars 
are so close to the top of  the poptop. The bad: super high feet are typically back order items 
and the feet alone are $130/set (doesn't include locks or load bars). 
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the Thule racks (and probably the Yakima) you can use the  65" load bars or if you're 
carrying two canoes, the 78" bars (cut down to a bit smaller size as needed).  When I was 
shopping for Thule and Yakima racks in the summer of '98, I found that <A HREF="http://www.Ageebike.com/">Agee's Bicycles</A>
had the best prices on the Net at the time. 
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You might also custom build a rack, a task which bears its own special rewards and 
allows you to explore your own creativity.  Just engineer it well! 
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, if you're carrying something like a canoe on a one time basis, you could just buy the 
inexpensive foam pads that fit to the gunnels and lash it to the roof by wrapping the lashing 
through the windows and around the bus.  It might not be very elegant and takes time to secure 
properly, but if you're on a budget, it might serve temporary needs affordably.
