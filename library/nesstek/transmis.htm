<b><center>'71 Transmission &amp; Shift Rod Make Over</center></b></font>
<font size="4">
<center>by Ron Van Ness</center>
<center>July 22, 1997</center>
<p>
<blockquote>
     Here's a chapter from my "what I did to my bus this summer" scrapbook.  While waiting for me 
to finish and install the long awaited rebuilt engine, my patient '71 Westy has been under the 
wrench for other mechanical operations, including transmission and shifter attention.  My 
transmission was covered with its share of oil and crud so I pulled it, cleaned it off and gave it a 
coat of flat black paint.  At the time I pulled the engine I noticed that the pressure plate finger tips 
were showing off center wear and I found play/general sloppiness in my clutch cross shaft 
bushings that were most likely the cause.  I also noticed the gear selector lever (a.k.a. hockey 
stick) was loose as a goose where it protrudes from the front nose cone bushing. The gear oil 
seepage below the side gear covers told me if I wanted to be really thorough I should replace the 
side gear seals while the tranmission was on the bench.  In the end I replaced all of the wear 
parts on the bell housing and nose cone and the side gear seals.  Here follows a description of the 
highlights and hurdles you'll have to leap to do the same--I left out the more obvious details in 
the name of bandwidth.  The part numbers I list at the end will work for anyone with a '71, 
though the '68-'75 transmissions (002) have many of these parts in common and I do my best to 
indicate the parts interchangeability.  Almost all the parts I mention are clearly diagramed in the 
Bentley manual.
<p>
     I didn't delve into the heart of the transmission though I know my 3rd/4th synchro is worn 
(shifter pops out of third on occasion when I take my foot off the gas), so that's why I call this 
just a "make over".  I'm living with the bad synchro until a transmission rebuild is inevitable (see Postscript).
The good news is when that dreaded day comes, all the work I've invested in the 
nose cone/bell housing I will be able to transfer to another transmission.  The rewards for doing a 
make over and my goals when I set out were: smooth operation of the clutch operating shaft and 
proper throw out bearing alignment with the pressure plate, elimination of gear oil leaks, and precise 
gear selection.
<p>
     For '68-'71 people: before you remove the transmission remember to mark the metal bracket (in 
a few spots) that bolts to the nose cone where it attaches to the rear motor mount.  This will allow 
for proper alignment of the transmission and make installation simple.  '72-up folks might need 
to do something similar, I'm not familiar with the front transmission mount on the later buses.  
Also for '68-'71: if you find that the front transmission rubber mount is broken, better start 
looking for a used one.  I could not find a source for these.
<p><font size="4"><b>
Bell housing components:
<p></p></b></font>
     Disassembly of the clutch operating fork shaft components revealed wear on the shaft where it 
contacted the left bushing and the spacer/washer wore a groove in the shaft.  Other wear 
included both the left and right side bushing, and wear spots on the return spring.  I replaced all 
these components--the only catch was the right side bushing that is pressed into the right side of 
the bell housing.  
<p>
<img alt="bell housing components" class="img-responsive" src="images/belhous1.jpg"/>
<p>
It is only accessible from one side (inside the housing) which can make it a 
challenge to remove, especially if yours is as ornery as mine.  It's a split bushing that has square 
impressions stamped into its surface.  The replacement bushing I bought from RMMW is a solid 
type with a smooth contact surface.  I measured a few thousandths of an inch wear using a 
vernier caliper by comparing the new bushing to the old so I decided to remove the old bushing 
from the housing.  The ID of this bushing is an odd size (14.1 mm) so the obvious solution of 
threading a bolt in the bushing and pulling it out does not work here. After making some tools 
that just didn't have the bite to pull that bushing out and after succeeding only in pushing the 
bushing down further so that it bottomed out in its housing, I called Rick Long of 
<a href="http://www.longenterprises.com/">Long Enterprises</a> 
to find a solution or get a tool for the job.  He said he's never had to replace that 
bushing on a transmission he's rebuilt and didn't have a tool for it.   The big local machine shop I 
brought the bell housing to next didn't want to try to remove it for fear of damaging the housing 
(!) and the local VW dealer did not have the correct extractor tool (a tool similar to, but a little 
larger than a starter bushing extractor tool) for the job.  But the dealership recommended a local 
place they bring their tough jobs (like sheared off studs in tricky places and other tedious things 
that require magic to pull off ;).  The place is called Walton Company here in West Hartford, CT 
(860-523-5231).  Frank at Walton had the problem solved in a few minutes.  He found a milling 
tool bit among his tool stash that had just the right size sharp, square end that he hammered 
snugly into the bushing and quickly twisted it out.  That beat my idea of making up a slide 
hammer-type tool on a lathe with special size threads to grab the bushing.
<p>
     After all this, I'd say unless your right side cross shaft bushing shows considerable wear, it's 
probably best not to replace it.  The bushing on the left side of the cross shaft (the easy one to 
replace) takes the brunt of the wear anyway and even a new shaft end when fit in a new right 
side bushing has some play so replacement is not critical and a few thousandths probably don't 
matter.  And after all the aggravation to remove the old bushing, the replacement (non-split type) 
did not press in very tightly (it just slipped in) so I ended up knurling the housing and using 
sleeve retainer to get it to stay put.  Unless you're a masochist (like me), I wouldn't risk 
breaking/damaging the housing to get at that bushing--just clean it and lube it and sleep well.  
As for the rest of the cross shaft items, the left bushing, rubber sleeves, and return spring install 
easily.  Don't forget to install a new input shaft seal and starter bushing while you have your 
nose in the bell housing.
<p>
     In my case, I removed the bell housing so I wouldn't have to lug the whole transmission to 
Walton to remove that pesky bushing.  The bell housing gasket and the nose cone gasket are 
paper, presumeably treated, gasket material.  It appears they were not originally installed with a 
sealer.  I cleaned the oil off the surface of the old bell housing gasket with acetone and then 
rubbed an extremely thin layer of silicone sealer for reassembly.  Bentley recommends use of a 
fresh gasket (no sealer needed) and I did use one for the nose cone, but decided not to spring for 
a bell housing gasket.  Hopefully no leaks will result from this corner cutting (see Postscript).

Side gear cover/seals:  
<p></p></b></font>
<p>
     First, you'll need to pierce the drive flange grease cap with
a screwdriver and pry it out so you can access the cirlip that retains the drive flange.
<p>
<img alt="drive flange grease cap" class="img-responsive" src="images/trseal1.jpg"/>
<p>
<img alt="grease cap removed" class="img-responsive" src="images/trseal2.jpg"/>
<p>
     Then, use a pair of cirlip pliers to remove the circlip. Curse
as needed.
<p>
<img alt="circlip removed" class="img-responsive" src="images/trseal3.jpg"/>
<p>
     An impact driver ($6 for the cheapo version at my local cheapo tool store) easily removed the 
phillips head screws that retain the side gear covers.  
My covers were rusty, so I ended up 
cleaning and painting these as well. 
<p>
<img alt="flange removed" class="img-responsive" src="images/trseal4.jpg"/>
<p>
You'll probably find a flat rubber seal (not pictured) that presses between 
the face of the oil seal and the side gear cover.  Remember to install that on reassembly.  Also, 
you'll discover a spacer ring (with a slit cut down its side) when you remove the drive flange 
and/or the oil seal.  This ring rides on the splined shaft.  It has a smooth side and a flat side.  
Install it so that the flat side faces out, toward the CV/drive flange. It's probably a very good idea 
to replace the c-clips that retain the drive flange on the drive shaft ends, but I didn't.  
<p>
<img alt="spacer ring removed" class="img-responsive" src="images/trseal5.jpg"/>
<p>
     Finally, we've reached the drive flange seal, a notorious leaker
on old transmissions.  The new, German Elring replacement seals look even better than the German originals.  The 
area that contacts the tranmsission housing is thicker than original so you can drive the seal in 
till it bottoms out (as opposed to the original type which cover only half the depth of the 
housing--if you get these old style seals you'll have to be careful to only drive them in flush and 
not go too deep or the seal lip might not make proper contact with the drive flange).  A 46mm 
socket is a perfect diameter tool for driving in the seals.  The blue grease caps press in easily 
with a smaller size socket.  
<p><font size="4"><b>
Nose cone:
<p></p></b></font>
     The nose cone is where parts replacement will reap you the most noticeable benefits and perhaps 
this is all you'll want to do if you just want to spend a little money and get a better shifter feel. 
The nose cone bushings are easily removed and installed as described in Bentley.  The front 
bushing (FIF) that has a tiny oil seal pressed in its end twists off with a vice-grip and the rear 
bushing can then be driven out with a drift.  
<p>
(In the picture below, note the shiny wear areas on the
hockey stick.  These areas pass through the bushings and are commonly worn due to lack of lubrication.
This is because they're working at a high spot on the nose cone that gear oil doesn't adequately reach.)
<p>
<img alt="nose cone components" class="img-responsive" src="images/nosecn.jpg"/>
<p>
You'll also discover that the bushings are worn a 
little thin (especially the rear).  The lever/hockey stick was replaced and the inner shift 
lever oil seal pressed into the end of the bushing.  Bentley mentions the bushing might have to 
be reamed, but this wasn't required in my case.  Lubricate the selector lever with gear oil before 
installation. There's also a plastic ball joint that the small end of the selector lever fits to which 
wears.   All of these contribute to a sloppy shifter feel (in addition to the nylon bushings in the 
shift linkage).  Replacing these yields a decisive shifter feel--now I know what shifting felt like 
on a new '71 bus :).  I'm waiting to hear back from Kyle on the availability of the dust 
cover/bellows for the inner shift lever (it's the accordion shaped rubber piece that sits over the 
end of the nose cone) (it's NLA--see Postscript).  This is an important piece since it protects debris from reaching and 
wearing out the inner shift lever seal.  
<p>
     Here's something you'll need to check before finishing the nose cone job:  While the nose cone is 
off it's easy to accidentally depress one of the selectors exposed on the transmission or leave 
them in an odd position relative to each other if you just happen to be playing with them for the 
heck of it.  If you do this, you might end up discovering after installing the transmission in your 
bus that the selector hangs up and you can't engage any gear (pulling the transmission, removing 
the nose cone and repositioning the selectors is the only way to remedy this).  To avoid this 
dilemma, make sure all the selectors are pulled out so that the slots line up, then install the lever 
that holds the plastic ball joint and the metal rod that loosely holds it in place like a hinge.  With 
the selector lever in the nose cone and just peaking out of the front bushing, slide the small end 
of the lever into the ball joint and push the nose cone in place.  Tighten the cover down and make 
sure you can push/pull the stub of the selector lever that protrudes from the nose cone--if you 
can't, one of the selectors is hung up so take the nose cone off and try again until you get it right.  
The critical thing here is to get the selector slots to line up.  You don't want to install the 
transmission and discover this problem later like someone I know. [innocent whistle]
<p><font size="4"><b>
Shift rods:
<p></p></b></font>
     The final piece of work is the shift linkage/rods.  The front rod on the '68-'73 bus has a small 
nylon bushing pressed into its front end that may require replacement--it is available from most 
parts suppliers.  The rubber boots for the rear shift rod also needed replacing on my bus and 
while the transmission was out, I pulled the rear shift rod to check the two nylon bushings for 
wear.  
<p>
<img alt="rod bushings and rubber boot" class="img-responsive" src="images/srodbush.jpg"/>
<p>
The front bushing was noticeably worn and I installed a new one (it's held in place by two 
nylon tabs in the bushing that fit into two drilled holes on the rod).  I couldn't detect any 
noticeable wear on the rear bushing but I decided to replace it anyway while I was there.  I 
bought from Just Kampers (UK) what I thought until recently was the correct rear shift rod rear 
bushing (211 711 185B), that is, until I removed the rear rod and had a look.  They instead sent 
me a rear rod front bushing (211 711 179).  But it turned out alright in the end.  An alleged 
211 711 185B that I only recently located would not stay put on the rod (it was sprung 
open where it laterally splits and kept slipping out of its retaining hole when pushed in the rear 
shift rod tube) so I ended up using a 211 711 179 at the front and the rear.  The front bushing 
attaches via two holes in the rod, the rear rod only has one hole to secure the smaller bushing.  I 
probably should've drilled a second hole in the rear of the rod to properly secure the front 
bushing for use in the rear, but at the time I instead decided to cut off one of the nylon tabs on 
the bushing.  I lubed everything with some semi-synthetic grease.  Hopefully I won't ever have 
to worry about replacing these parts again.  There's probably a good reason why VW didn't use 
the same bushing in the front and rear (too much friction area?), but I tentatively notice no I'll 
effects with this and the feel of the shifter now is very precise.  If you don't want to take the 
chance, just lube the rod and re-use your old bushing if it looks good (see Postscript, the rearmost
bushing is now being reproduced).
<p>
     In regard to taking up slop in the shifter, I haven't yet mentioned the shift rod coupling set (311 
798 211) that RMMW sells for $6.95.  This is the coupler/cage that attaches the selector lever to 
the rear shift rod.  Mine were a couple years old but still looked new so I didn't have to replace 
them--I think the urethane replacement bushings will outlast most of the other parts on the bus.  
Also unmentioned is the gear shift kit (211 798 121E) which RMMW sells for $18.95 (the stick 
shift in the cab section).  I also replaced these around the same time I did the coupler a couple 
years ago.  When re-attaching the set screws on the shift rods, don't forget to use stainless steel 
wire to hold them in place.  
<p>
     Listed below are the parts I used on this job, prices and sources.  The prices might have changed 
since I made my purchases, but this should give you an idea of the general cost and the part #s 
should make it easy to place an order.  Special thanks to Kyle Wade of Volks-Motorsports fame 
for tracking down most of these small, obscure parts for me.  He promptly replied to my email, 
offered a great price, and filled the order accurately.  That type of service is invaluable when 
you're waiting for just the right parts to complete a job. Thanks also to Brian Verbeek who went 
through the trouble of tracking down some parts and sending them across an ocean, and to Ron 
at the Bus Depot for providing a critical part, the hockey stick.   And thanks to my local VW 
dealership, Bill Barry VW of West Hartford, CT.  Ken Rybzyck, the parts manager, cares about 
his VW parts customers--even the ones with old buses!

Postscript: 20k mile Update<br/>
October 9, 1998
<p></p></b></font>
     It's been over a year and 20,000 miles since I installed the transmission.  The transmission's
exterior is still bone dry (no leaks).  The flat black rustoleum paint is flaking off, which 
I attribute to the lack of prep work before painting.  The engine case that I painted at about 
the same time was cleaned twice (before and after machine work) and the flat black paint has held up
much better than the coating on the transmission.  Oxidation of the magnesium had apparently been
neutralized on the engine case (which was hot cleaned at a machine shop) but not for the 
transmission (which I degreased and wire brushed only before painting).  
<p>
     Since my article appeared on the type2 list, Jim Thompson (Oldvolkshome) has reproduced the previously
obsolete rear shift rod rear bushing and sells this in a kit with the other bushings needed to renew
the shift rods.  
<p>
<img alt="rear shift rod bushing" class="img-responsive" src="images/rearbush.jpg"/>
<p>
The rear rod front bushing that I bought from Just Kampers is now readily available in 
the States though Jim remains the only source I'm aware of for the rear bushing.  
<p>
<img alt="shift rod boot" class="img-responsive" src="images/rodboot.jpg"/>
<p>
The rubber shift boots 
(211 711 183B) which I was fortunate to get through a friend in the Netherlands, Brian Verbeek, are 
no longer available in the US, but I notice Just Kampers in the UK lists them as part # 211 711 167A in 
their 1998 catalog for approx. $7.50 each.  The same catalog lists the 211 599 201A '68-'71 transmission
rubber mount, but availability seems sketchy since you must call for a price.  This part is also no
longer available in the US and is not yet reproduced in the aftermarket.
<p>
(Note: As of July '99 it's rumored that <a href="http://www.wolfsburgwest.com/">Wolfsburg West</a> will be
reproducing these shift rod boots.  Contact them for details.)
<p>
     Another elusive part is the rubber dust cover for the inner shift lever (68-75 bus 211 301 289A).  
If your transmission has not been rebuilt, you'll likely have the remnants of this piece still attached to the nose cone.
It was long ago discontinued by VW.  Interestingly, the 1979 US fiche for '68-'79 buses lists part # 211 711 115A
as a suitable replacement--this part # is also the boot at the base of the shift lever in the cab (in some catalogs it might
also be referred to as 111 711 115A because it was interchangeable with boots on other VW models).

<p>
After my transmission make over, I obtained a NOS 211 301 289A dust cover and leared from Brian Verbeek that 
there were two incarnations of the 289A.  Though functionally the same, one type (presumeably earlier)
is pleated and a later verson is smooth, without pleats.  Since they're no longer available or listed
in catalogs most people appear content to leave this part off without attempting to fabricate a 
home brew equivalent.  Perhaps they use the shift lever boot as the fiche recommends, though I haven't attempted to
fit one.   The nose cone bushing will get contaminated easier without
a dust cover and it is therefore worth the effort to install something functionally equivalent to the 
original.  
<p>
     Michael Donnellan brought to my attention that Transform (a transmission rebuild/parts shop in the US)
offers rebuilt nose cones that allow the '68-'75 002 transmission owners to use the '76-'79 091 transmission 
nose cone that is presumeably smoother shifting (spring loaded selector lever) and has less wear probability.  
They also offer a machined steel replacement for the plastic ball joint (004 301 241A).  Michael and others have 
highly recommended the nose cone upgrade, so you might consider this option vs. replacing the individual, original
components on your 002.  Weddle Engineering, another US VW transaxle rebuilder, also offers this upgrade kit.  
Prices are about $45 for the 091 nose cone kit, $6 for the steel ball joint.
<p>
     The problem I reported of the shifter popping out of 3rd gear when the 
transmission was loaded by removing
my foot from the accelerator has occured only 3-4 times over the past 20k miles/1 year.  It occured as many
times the year before with approximately the same miles traveled.  So for now, the 3rd/4th synchro appears 
not to be deteriorating further, though I am ever alert for a change in its status.  
<p>
     Happy shifting!
