<b><center>Replacing the '69-79 Bus Front Door Lock Spring</center></b></font>
<font size="4">
<center>by Ron Van Ness</center>
<center>October 17, 1998</center>
<p>
<blockquote>
     One annoyance '69-79 bus owners 
choose to tolerate in the face 
of other, more pressing repairs is a problem with the front door 
locks.  The symptom: when the door is locked, the key will not 
turn the lock cylinder easily due to a stretched or broken 
spring that no longer retracts a lever on the lock mechanism.  
If the spring is stretched, rapping the door around the handle 
will jog the weak spring and you can turn the key freely.  If 
the spring is broken, you learn to turn the key with varying 
increments of pressure, jiggling until a lever on the lock 
finally allows you admission to your bus.  Pressing the outer door 
handle button before using the key exacerbates the situation and can
double your required jiggling time. On wet days, you may notice that 
moisture is your friend and the subdued lock grants passage 
easier.  As you gain proficiency in your alternate lock coaxing 
techniques, you delay the inevitable, proper repair longer...and 
longer.  If you wait too long, and you're in the "jiggler" 
catagory, you might eventually break the pot metal lock cylinder 
by forcing the key, your bitter reward for procrastination.  My 
wife disdained learning key jiggling skills so when she 
drove the bus she'd surrender to the obstinate front locks and 
just enter via the sliding door.  When the sliding door finally 
unexpectedly fell off its track one day (I was also 
procrastinating replacement of a damaged sliding door lower 
roller) I was strongly encouraged to make the bus doors user 
friendly lest I suffer irreparable damage.  What follows is the procedure 
for this surprisingly simple though long avoided repair: 
replacing the puny, pesky, marriage threatening door lock 
spring. 
<p>
<img alt="tools required" class="img-responsive" src="images/lock1.jpg"/>
<p>
<b>Tools:</b>
<ul>
<li>phillips screwdriver
<li>hammer
<li>impact screwdriver
<li>allen wrenches
<li>10mm socket and ratchet wrench
<li>long, thin nosed pliers
<li>dentist's pick
<li>grease
<li>liquid graphite
<li>Anti-Seize
<li>wire snips
</li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></ul>
<p>
<b>Part:</b>
<ul>
<li>a spring (one per door)
</li></ul>
<b>Procedure:</b>
<p>
     With the window raised completely, remove the window winder 
handle by prying off its plastic cover and unscrewing the 
phillips head screw.  Remove the one screw holding on the 
plastic finger plate behind the door release lever, and remove 
the two screws holding the pull strap.  If you're not a 
Westfalia owner, you might also need to remove the screws 
retaining the air duct.  
<p>
<img alt="stage of door panel removal" class="img-responsive" src="images/lock2.jpg"/>
<p>
<img alt="stage of door panel removal" class="img-responsive" src="images/lock3.jpg"/>
<p>
Now you're down to the inner 
door panel, which is held by  twenty-five metal clips 
that grip to rubber grommeted holes in the door. The clips pop 
out of the holes as you finger pry your way around the panel. Some 
of the rubber grommets/seals might be missing or damaged.  West 
Coast Metric sells a set of twenty-five (WCM part # 211 219A) for 
about $20 which work with the original clips.  If you have aftermarket
panels and clips on your door, you'll need different seals which
are also available from WCM, though considerably cheaper. 
With the panel removed, you'll see the plastic 
sheet that protects the back of the panel from moisture.  Peel it back to
expose the top 2/3 of the door. If it's in 
poor condition, glue a fresh sheet in place to seal the door 
after your repair.  If it's in good condition and friendly, it 
might allow you to carefully peel it off and stick it back on 
its old, tacky glue afterwards.  
<p>
     Remove the two 10mm head bolts retaining the 
door release lever.  They might by obscured by some old foam, which will 
crumble away easily as you search through it. Unhook the lever 
mechanism from its rod.
<p>
<img alt="stage of door release removal" class="img-responsive" src="images/lock4.jpg"/>
<p>
<img alt="stage of door release removal" class="img-responsive" src="images/lock5.jpg"/>
<p>
On the other end of the rod, near the 
lock side edge of the door's inner panel, a circular opening 
reveals a spring steel keeper that secures the rod to the door lock.  Pull 
off the keeper, slide it forward and remove the rod hook from the lock arm and then slide 
the rod forward. 
<p>
<img alt="rod keeper" class="img-responsive" src="images/lock6.jpg"/>
<p>
You'll also need to remove the rear window 
guide channel, which you'll find at the rear of the door, 
secured by a 10mm head bolt at its bottom and a spring clip (the push on/pull off variety) at 
its top.  With the bolt removed, grip the channel firmly and 
pull straight down sharply.  The spring clip holding the top is probably 
rusted in place.  On both my front doors, the channel was 
removed easily after one or two sharp pulls, but some people 
encounter problems with a rusted clip.  If it doesn't break free 
on the first try, be assured that a good yank downward will free 
the guide channel and there is no need to bend or hack at it.  
If your clip breaks you'll just need to study the rusty clip 
remains and make a replacement clip with minor ingenuity, and 
repair the top of the guide if necessary.

<p>    
<p>    
<p>    
     Next, remove the two allen bolts (also accessible from the inner 
panel side) that hold the door handle against the door skin.  
It's a good time to clean your lock cylinder, lube with liquid 
graphite, and verify the phillips head screw that holds the 
lever on its end is secure.  Now all that's left between you and 
that cursed spring is the removal of the door lock itself.  
Before you can remove the lock, move the U-shaped piece (that 
grabs the striker plate post mounted on the door pillar when the door is closed) so that 
the open end faces down instead of at an angle.  This allows 
clearance for lock removal.

    <p>
    <p>
    <p>
    <p>
    <p>
<p>    
<p>    
<p>    
<p>    
<p>    
<p>    
<p>
(Note: Left side door lock pictured.  Right door lock is a mirror image of the
left side.  The two are not interchangeable.)
<p>
Removing two phillips head screws 
on the door's rear edge and a third one visible from the inner 
panel side will release the lock.  You will likely need an 
impact screwdriver for this since those screws probably haven't 
moved since your bus left the factory.  Don't bugger up the 
screw heads by forcing your impotent screwdriver blade against 
them, buy the cheap impact driver if you don't have one, you are 
guaranteed to find other satisfying uses for it later.  If 
you're really cheap or desparate though, you might get away with 
hammering a phillips screwdriver against the head first before 
twisting (but if that fails, don't marr the screw heads, get the 
dang impact driver!).
<p>
     Now that the lock is free, with your hand inside the inner door 
panel and fingers on the lock, work it down the door until you 
can pull it out the large opening on the bottom.  Now is not the 
time for impatience (there will be plenty of time for that later 
when you confront the spring installation) so if the lock gets 
wedged inside the door before you can pull it out, gently work 
it up a bit and try again.  A straight path down does the trick, 
that is, push the U-piece on the lock into the door until it 
just clears, and then try to work the lock straight down with 
the U still facing its usual direction.  It will come out 
without force so don't attack your inner door panel with a pry 
bar in frustration.  If it gives you trouble, take a breather 
and reapproach the problem with newfound faith.  When you fail 
again, swallow your pride and ask your wife to remove it.
<p>
     Once she's removed the lock, study how the plastic protector 
attaches to it and then carefully pop the protector off.  Clean 
the lock and protector thoroughly.  Study the photo of the lock 
to see where the spring attaches.  If your old spring wasn't 
simply stretched, you might see the remnants of a broken spring 
still attached to one of the levers.  Remove this bit and 
proceed to installing the replacement spring.  You can still buy
the OEM VW spring (part # 211 837 061 for '69-'79 buses) for about $1.60 US.
Other springs might work, but the VW 
spring was made for the job.  The upside: it's plated and stiff for its 
size and by using it you likely won't repeat your labor anytime soon; the
down side: the cost is expensive
relative to what you are receiving, so you might just buy one
new VW spring to use as a base line for purchasing cheaper equivalents
at your hardware store.  Also, I did need to make slight modifications to the OEM
spring (more on that below) to install on my '71 lock, so don't necessarily
expect a perfect fit if you buy the "stock" part.  Though 
you'll only need one spring per door, it's best to have a few on 
hand just in case you damage one attempting to hook it over the 
lever ends.  
<p>
     Installing the spring is another task requiring patience, so 
make sure your wife is still available for the inevitable.  
You'll need the thin nosed pliers and a dentist's pick or their 
equivalents.  I found it easier to hook the spring on the more 
visible lever first (the other lever is obscured from 
view).  Use your pliers to get the spring against the hook at 
the end of the lever, then work it onto the hook using the 
dentist's pick.  
<p>
<img alt="installing spring on lock" class="img-responsive" src="images/lock11.jpg"/>
<p>
On the stock spring, three coils are bent
away on either end to wrap around the lever ends. You
might find it easier to snip off one coil on each end to make your task
of slipping it over the hooks easier.  This will not weaken the working
part of the spring.  You can easily damage the spring by bending or 
stretching its coils if force is directed inappropriately, removing
that one coil might make your task easier and help avoid this.  If 
you install a stretched/damaged spring it won't retract the lever 
completely and you'll have the same lock problems that brought 
you here, so don't be hasty.  Once the spring end is hooked over the 
more visible lever, use the pliers to grab the other end and 
pull it over the hook on the second lever.  You'll see there's 
only one good avenue to use your pliers, with the plier tip 
grabbing down into the opposite side open end of the coil.  
<p>
     When you're finished, move the lever and check that the spring 
pulls it all the way back (i.e. pull the lever, release it, then 
push it further in the direction it retracted to see if its travel
continues).  If it does, you must unhook the spring 
and start again.  Either you stretched some coils when you 
installed the it (you'll see they're bent too much at the 
ends) or the spring is too long for some reason.  Although the 
same spring should work for either door, I found that my 
passenger side door lock required a bit shorter spring for some 
reason.  I cut off a few coils with a wire cutter, bent back two on that end
to grab the hook and then reinstalled.  Don't cut more than you need
to or the spring will be stressed in use and break prematurely.  Just take
off enough coils as necessary for the lever to retract fully.  Once the spring is 
correctly installed, give the lock back to your husband so he 
can make himself feel useful and direct him to the next 
paragraph.
<p>
<img alt="lock spring identified" class="img-responsive" src="images/doorlock.jpg"/>
<p>
     It's time now to lubricate the lock.  I used aerosolized liquid 
graphite on the relatively inaccessible joints and molybdenum 
grease with the dentist's pick on the more accessible joints.  
Work the moving parts of the lock so the lubricants will 
penetrate and then wipe off the excess.  Pop the plastic 
protector back in place and then work the lock back up the door 
panel to where it attaches.  Remember to first move the U-shaped 
piece so that its open end faces downward for clearance.  Once 
it is screwed in place, put a finger in the hole where the door 
handle would be on the outer door skin and push the lever on the 
lock.  The U-shaped piece will click into place at the proper 
angle to catch the striker plate.  If you forget to do this, 
when you first close your door the striker will be stricken abusively.
<p>
     Before you reattach the release lever rod to the lock with the 
spring steel keeper, clean and grease the rod's ends and also 
its center where it passes through the nylon block.  Attach the 
door handle and the release lever.  Now you're left with the 
rear guide channel.  Dab some grease on its rusty clip so that 
it will slide easily in place.  You'll suddenly realize it 
would've been a good idea (before you installed the lock) to 
look up into the door with a flashlight and memorize the 
location where the guide channel clips. But it isn't so bad, you 
know where the channel must bolt at its bottom, so look up 
inside the door to determine where the top needs to pass to keep 
the guide vertical when installed.  If you have it placed 
correctly, the hole in the lower part of guide plate will be 
about an inch below the hole into which the bolt threads.  At 
this point, give the channel a quick push upward and it will 
snap easily in place with the help of the grease.  Install the 
bolt.
<p>
     Now you can check your handiwork by closing the door 
and noticing that your lock problems have been eliminated.  
Breath a sigh of relief and install the plastic sheeting, inner 
panel and the remaining pieces you removed.  To install the door 
panel, you might need to guide the clips into their holes with 
one finger while you press the panel's face with your other 
hand.  
<p>
     If you're one of those over-achiever types who swapped in a 
spare lock that you had cleaned and waiting in advance with a 
shiny, new spring that you installed on a rainy day while all 
the other bus folk were out frolicking (my, aren't you 
special?!!), now is when your preparedness might be penalized.  
The latch on your replacement lock might not meet the striker 
plate on the door pillar as your original did.  To adjust the 
striker plate, loosen the two allen bolts holding it and adjust 
its position up, down, in, or out as needed to get your door to 
close smoothly.  You can still feel cocky and superior though, 
this doesn't take long.
<p>
     Congratulations, you've just repaired one of those depressing 
annoyances that accumulate, gnawing at your conscience, ever 
persuading you to sell your bus for something less worn.  You've 
made your wife happy (or your husband happy if you've reached 
this point without him), now everyone can open the locked door 
with just a key.  Now that you're motivated for more repairs, let's
