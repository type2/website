<b><center>Convert your Fridge on Wheels (BN4 heater in a Bus)</center></b></font>
<font size="4">
<center>by Caspar de Lint</center>
<p>
<u>Introduction</u>
<p>
At the <a href="http://www.vweuro.nl/">VWEuro '98</a> I stumbled across a 
crate with a lot of junk in it. It turned out to be a virtually complete 
Eberspächer BN4 heater for a bus. Even the vintage ('77) was 
about right for my bus ('76).  At first I hesitated. These units 
are renown for their unreliability. On the other hand, sometimes 
I just could not achieve a decent heater output. The beetle 
derived heat exchangers on my humble 1600cc are just 
not up to the task of heating the larger bus interior. I had accepted this as one 
of the few development faults, as I use the bus for summer/hobby use 
only. But a couple of years ago, after a meeting in Switzerland 
(Schwartzsee), where the temperature dropped to a -8 degrees 
Celsius at night, my interest for an efficient heater which could 
also run stationary was very much alive!! Being an original option 
for these vehicles (factory installed up to '72, and dealer installed up to '79) 
I decided to go ahead. The asking price was 
friendly $60. After some traditional haggling (hey, I am Dutch you 
know!!) he agreed on $50. I picked up the crate and thought, 
"Well, I'll give it a go, if I can find the right info..."
<p>
<u>First Sight</u>
<p>
Within five minutes I found out that its dashboard knob was missing. 
Being at Europe's biggest swap meet has its advantages; Michel, 
a long term fellow bus fanatic, dug it up after 30 minutes. 
A smaller piece of the fresh air ducting was missing too; the guy 
I bought it from was there with the bus he took it off. The duct 
was still riveted to his car, but he did not want to take it off 
for me...even if I offered him $10 for it. Strange guys, those 
Germans... 
<p>
<u>A Word about Prices...</u>
<p>
Afterwards I found out that in Germany these heaters are checked 
as a part of the TUV (MOT or APK) road safety check. As a result of 
German traffic law, the heat exchanger of each fuel heater needs 
to be renewed every 10 years. For the older types, such as BN4 or 
BA6, these are no longer available. Very little imagination is 
needed to comprehend why more complete "German" heaters turn up for sale. 
So my experience can be duplicated, provided you live in Europe...
<p>
Abroad prices are sometimes really stupid; one guy in the UK asked 
$450 for a used BN4, while I saw a NOS early BN4 complete to the 
last bolt lying also at VWEuro '98 for $330. At this year's VWEURO 
I spotted various units lying around (also for Beetle, even 6 volt and Type 3). 
Also bear in mind that these units were fitted for the Scandinavian 
market as standard equipment. I imagine that the same applies for a lot of 
vehicles sold in Canada. Finding a good candidate is not impossible.  
And make sure you buy the right type: the unit fitted to the 181 
or thing looks the same, but the ancillaries sure aren't--although 
I must admit that the heater itself, if decently priced, 
is a good parts unit.
<p>
Having a parts heater lying around is a good idea anyway; I bought 
one for $30. It has already earned its keep, but I will get to this 
later. However make absolutely sure that you are buying a complete 
BN4. When a part is missing think if you can replicate it. If 
ducting is missing remember that this is generally hard to make up 
yourself. Also make sure that the identification plate is present 
on the heater itself. If it is missing this could indicate the 
removal by German TUV authorities because of serious failures...
<p>
<u>The Quest for Info</u>
<p>
Because you are reading this article you already must have found 
Ron's share of info 
about this topic on the Web, which was a great knowledge boost, 
because I started from scratch. I would advise you to thoroughly 
read these two articles first before attempting any testing or 
installation work.
<p>
It took me a couple of days to find more useful sites. The Dutch 
Eberspächer dealer has no info nor parts left of these older 
types. With some toggling I found the <a href="http://www.eberspaecher.de/">site 
of the factory</a> again; no parts left. But I was put through to 
a man whom I explained why I called. He was very friendly, and 
told me to wait for what he could find. This turned out to be a 
complete installation guide, with templates for the necessary holes, 
electrical plan &amp; fault finders' guide, and some documentation 
about their newest models of course!! Later I found out that a 
fellow <a href="http://ploon.nl/lvwcn/">LVWCN club member</a>
had an original VW workshop BN4 manual with all the updates. 
After I spent some time at the copy shop I now have my own copy.
<p>
<u>Initial Work</u>
<p>
Photo below: Me merrily hacking away!  A typical shot of the installation: bus eats man!
<p>
<img class="img-responsive" src="images/bn401a.jpg"/>
<p>
Armed with this knowledge which I soaked up to be on the safe side, 
I decided it was time to find out if this heater was for real by testing 
it. Please make sure you are performing your test safely. You are 
working with fuel, a battery and a fan, which spins at high speed 
(more than 4800 rpm). You do not want to set your car or garage/house 
on fire, nor do you want to chop up your fingers with the heater's 
fan. I followed the hints in Ron's articles 
to set up a test situation. I also connected the temperature-regulating 
switch to assess if everything performed ok. After the pump had 
sucked enough fuel from the secure container (a 5 liter plastic 
jerry can) to deliver some to the heater, it started up like a dream... 
And there I was; on my driveway at 8:20 PM on a November night 
jumping up &amp; down... This hobby is sure more involving than 
stamp collecting!!!
<p>
<u>Fabrication</u>
<p>
This sure is also true for the fabrication of certain parts. 
The top cap of the fresh air duct was missing (my BN4 is the 
recirculating version) and although I had a complete exhaust 
it was sure no longer serviceable, both items are no longer 
available new.
<p>
The exhaust of the later type is directly behind the rear wheel. 
Unless there is a mudflap it will get the full spray from the wheels. 
This frequently results in detrimental effects. I was lucky that 
only the upper part was terminally moth eaten.  After some 
reviving the lower part looked excellent with some Hammerite brand 
paint. The exhaust lower part is made of considerably heavier 
gauge steel, so it survives longer.
<p>
<img class="img-responsive" src="images/transam.jpg"/>
<p>
Some digging in the trash container at my VW dealer (who is also a 
VW nut) revealed that some used Golf exhaust tubing virtually matches the 
old diameter of the (thinner) upper part. I used a straight section 
which comes from the part between the cat and the muffler. With an 
angle grinder and a hacksaw I cut it to the required length. 
<p>
The 
curved part, which attaches to the unit, was reusable. This is 
very convenient because of the specific joint which incorporates a 
clamp and asbestos ring (handle with care!!) I drilled the holes 
in the "Golf" tubing for the mounting of the lower exhaust part. 
Here you need to carefully assess where to drill them, otherwise 
the pipe won't line up properly when you install everything. 
My neighbor was so friendly to weld the two pieces together. 
<p>

<p>
Next up was the fresh air cap. In the panel where you need to cut 
for the inlet, there is a recession where the cap fits over. It is 
very awkward to take measurements here; you need to impersonate 
the snakeman here, who has an extra wrist and rubber vertebrae. 
I reproduced these dimensions on cardboard, so that I could produce 
a model. Jos, a friend of mine, duly reproduced this in metal. 
Just to be sure he made two. 
<p>
<u>Drilling &amp; Cutting</u>
<p>
Because my bus is retrofitted with a Westfalia interior, I needed 
to extend the hot air outlet under my couch. The unit I found came 
out of a nine seater, so with the general unavailability of parts 
I needed to be creative. A visit to the Eberspächer dealer 
yielded the parts which I could use for this. Although they are 
from the current type of heater, the can be made to fit with some 
patience. A piece of insulated tube is used for the extension 
under the seat and a vent is mounted in the front kick plate of 
the couch. This is an adjustable vent, so the hot air can be 
directed in the desired way.
<p>
<img class="img-responsive" src="images/bn4outl1.jpg"/>
<p>
<img class="img-responsive" src="images/bn4outl2.jpg"/>
<p>
<img class="img-responsive" src="images/bn4outl3.jpg"/>
<p>
Now it was time to take out the cushions, I left the rest of the 
couch assembly in place. This meant that I had to work in a more 
uncomfortable position, but in the end it turned out fine. I also 
took out the left rear trim for the recirculating hole, where my 
fabricated cap should go. I started to "mirror" the templates onto 
my bus with a felt pen. Working very, very close to your fuel tank 
means that the dimensions need to be spot on!! In my opinion you 
absolutely need to have those templates in order to successfully 
install the heater.
<p>
Then I drilled literally hundreds of 3mm holes just inside of the 
part scheduled for cutting (near the tank remember?!). 
<p>

<p>

<p>
<img class="img-responsive" src="images/bn411a.jpg"/>
<p>
If you do this 
consistently and drill the holes as close to each other as you can, 
you can easily chisel the section out. For this I used a special 
cold chisel (pictured below) which is used in auto body shops. 
<p>
<img class="img-responsive" src="images/chisel1a.jpg"/>
<p>
It is frighteningly 
sharp, so take care and wear safety goggles. 
You do want to enjoy 
your work when you are done, don't you?? Because it is extremely 
sharp, the metal does not distort and with some filing you will be able 
to obtain the right size of hole. Once you have cut out the first 
hole you can peek inside to see what's going on at the backside you 
are working on...
<p>
Photo below: Checking on the progression seen from the engine area. 
<p>
<img class="img-responsive" src="images/bn412a.jpg"/>
<p>
I started to drill/chisel/file the firewall in the engine compartment 
first, because Ron told me that you had the most of space (to the 
tank). I observed the engine compartment before I started and I 
judged that it could be done with the engine in situ, although 
the factory manual states that the engine has to be taken out. 
I certainly agree that this works far more comfortable but I had 
some experience with my fresh air cap measurements so I already 
had tested my "rubber" spine.
<p>
With the firewall hole made, I first made a few conservative drills 
on the "other" side, under the couch. I felt comfortable working in 
this way; after each hole I could see where I was, compared to the 
tank's position. Be sure to start at the top end of the hole. Because 
the bottom section is very close to the tank as well as the rear 
wheel well. With the templates marked out with felt pen you know 
where you are going.  The lower part of this hole I carefully 
chiselled out. Once both the holes are there you have to crawl 
under your car to drill the hole for the bowden cable to operate 
the temperature-regulating switch.
<p>
Again, double check your dimensions with the templates (either 
from Ron or Me) and mark in advance with your trusty felt pen. 
Because this panel is slightly curved you need to centre the 
position here before you can successfully drill the hole. As an 
exception to the rule the grommet where the bowden cable goes 
through can be ordered through your VW dealer (at least in Holland). 
The other hole for the cable, as you might expect, has to be 
drilled at an even more awkward position; above your brake master 
cylinder!! Hint: slide a piece of copper pipe over your drill so 
you won't protrude too far (about 10mm). In order to drill this 
one you need to take out your front seat. By this time your bus 
looks pretty messed up... 
<p>
I wanted to obtain the most original result possible, so I also 
drilled &amp; chiseled out the two holes for the exhaust &amp; air intake 
pipe. I felt most comfortable drilling upwards, with safety goggles.  
There was enough ground clearance to crawl half under the panel 
you need to work on. Because I found the recirculating version I 
also made a hole in the D-post. Although you need to follow to cut 
along the recession in the panel here (on my '76) I made sure to 
double-check it with my templates. Better safe than sorry.... 
Because the edges of the hole are visible through the intake 
grille I took my time to dress up the edges &amp; the inside of the 
fresh air intake cap. 
<p>
Transferring the hole on your trim 
panel also took some time, again using the templates and double-checking. 
I found out that the template was about 1 inch off the actual location 
in the panel, so I modified the template a little. In Holland 
(Europe) interior trim for buses is generally very hard to find. 
And if available and in decent shape, it is priced rather hefty 
(read: expensive).
<p>
<u>Mounting the ducting</u>
<p>
Although I had also templates for the heater mounting bracket, I 
only used them as a reference. I first mounted the ducting next to 
the tank and connected the temperature-regulating switch. Make 
sure that the tank compartment is sealed off decently when everything 
is in place. For this I used an old bicycle tube which I cut to 
size and glued with clear silicone. Silicone swells up when it 
comes in contact with fuel. Nice characteristic I think... I used 
stainless steel screws in all the original holes. There are not 
that many screws anyway, so using all the possible mounting points 
seemed like a good thing to me. One screw kept me busy for about 
two hours; it was located on the firewall's end on top of the duct. 
With the engine in this was difficult to get a grip on. But I doubt 
if things would improve if the engine were out.
<p>
Next I tried the heater for measurements. Everything lined up wonderfully. 
I marked off the mounting holes for the bracket and mounted the 
unit. Psychologically this was a milestone to me, so I celebrated 
this with a beer... Now I could try the exhaust and fresh air 
ducting for alignment. The fresh air duct needed some persuasion 
to fit properly, but in the end it fitted nice. I was glad that I 
had taken so much time taking measurements for the fresh air cap. 
After fitting the cap inside the D-post (I had to take the heater 
out again) the duct would slide firmly into place. Filling with 
silicone kit I sealed the fresh air cap joint through the D-post 
hole. Next I riveted the grille into place and put back the trim. 
<p>

(grille opening now blocked by insulation):

<p>

<p>
<img class="img-responsive" src="images/duct3a.jpg"/>
<p>
The exhaust with the welded section lined up like new. I had the 
grommet with the exhaust so no dirt can enter through the hole and 
the panel is protected against rubbing of the exhaust. For the late
model BN4 heater, this is part# 181 261 185A.
If it is missing, you can order it from your local 
VW dealer. It is not vital but very convenient if it comes with 
your unit. Installing the fresh combustion air intake was very easy. 
Just screw it to the bodywork and slide the flexible hose into 
place.
<p>
Next up was the fuel line. I made a cut and insert a T-piece under 
the car. This required an extra hole (&amp; grommet!!) to get the fuel 
line out of the engine compartment, but if something would go wrong 
with the T-piece it would leak outside the hot engine bay. I am a 
fan of keeping fuel lines as far away as possible from hot items. 
I used new fuel lines throughout and secured everything with 
clamps and tie wraps to be sure.
<p>
<u>Wiring</u>
<p> 
Photo below: My dash with knob.
<p>
<img class="img-responsive" src="images/bn402a.jpg"/>
<p>
I had to drill the hole for the stock switch. Again I drilled a 
smaller hole and filed it to size, taking care it would line up 
properly.  If you have a padded dash, you have to crawl under your 
dash and check the backside where the corresponding hole is pre-cut. 
On my plain-metal dash I had to carefully measure out (anybody got 
a decent padded dash for my '76 out there?? <a href="mailto:casba@tip.nl">EMail me!</a>) 
and cut the hole. Because I had the wiring loom from the switch to 
the fusebox this went pretty smoothly. I only had to install one 
wire from the front to the heater for the starting up sequence; 
this took some time to install neatly. It took me approximately 
6 meters of cable to complete the job.
<p>
<u>On the Road</u>
<p>
With all installation work completed I tried the heater stationary. 
Now I found out I had installed the wires for stationary use (with 
engine off, with "egg-timer") and normal use the wrong way around. 
After swapping terminals, this little gremlin was sorted. The heater 
starts whizzing as soon as you turn it into the "egg-timer" position.  
The fuel pump ticks and after some seconds (it was April, warming up in 
mid-winter takes longer)  you hear a sort of mini-jet afterburning 
in your bus... The heat oozes into your car and thoroughly warms 
the interior in minutes. Mind you: do not perform such tests in a 
confined space!
<p>
With my BN4 in the back I now only use the stock heater boxes to 
demist my front screen. The heater is perfectly capable of maintaining 
a comfortable temperature in my car. Although I directly admit 
I do not use my bus during winters and I have taken great care 
insulating the interior and closing off all draught holes. 
The noise it makes is very acceptable at speed. During the heat up and 
cool down sequences you sometimes hear the metal ducting ticking. 
Fuel consumption is also very moderate. When I drove through Paris 
this year on my way to Portugal I still achieved 10km to a liter 
with the heater working.  The temperature switch was set below 
half power.
<p>
In general, you hardly notice the thing working in the back...apart 
from the heat that is!!
<p>
<u>First Break Down</u>
<p>
Yep, this also happened. In Portugal it rained pretty hard and 
temperature was 14 degrees Celsius. So the decision was made to 
leave the mountains and head for the sunnier coast. The heater 
would not start. It had cut out by itself already some times before. 
Luckily the weather improved later that day.
<p>
I had taken my Eberspächer manuals with me, so with a test 
lamp I could perform an error check why it would not run. It 
turned out to be that the temperature regulating switch did not 
make contact anymore. This prevented the heater from starting up. 
Later, on my way back home I made a shortcut and cut the switch off. 
With thrusts of approximately 120 seconds I was able to warm up 
the car by switching the heater on/off, while my girlfriend Barbara 
drove. If things would overheat, there would still be the overheating 
switch as a safe guard. But understand me correctly: I sure do not 
advise running the heater in this set up. The clue to a long-term 
relation with a functional heater is keeping all the original 
safeguards in working order. I only made this conversion to get 
home and be able to warm up the interior if necessary.
<p>
Now came my spare-unit into play. I had an extra switch lying in 
the attic. Sad thing was that I had to take out the complete heater 
in order to replace the faulty unit. I guess just a case of Murphy's Law. 
Why it broke down is not clear to me: it could be because of some 
bad Portuguese roads, normal wear &amp; tear or just bad luck. Anyhow, 
it has run perfectly ever since.
<p>
<u>Stationary Use</u>
<p>
Still I had one wish: it would be perfect if I could run it on 
chilly nights on city power (in Europe 220V). A friend of mine, Albert, 
is a wizard with electrics because of his profession. He drew up a 
scheme with a 14 ampere 12v source, which runs on 220V. With a 
smart relay set up I now run the unit on my battery when not 
connected to 220V. As soon as 220V is detected the heater is fed 
with current from the 12V source. I now only need to enter 
campsites with a full tank of gas.  Now that's original heat!!! 
<p>
Albert made sure to incorporate all the other electric equipment 
in this setup. So my radio, interior lights, water pump and fridge 
all benefit from this clever piece of electrical engineering. You 
know, this hobby is all about one thing leading to another...
