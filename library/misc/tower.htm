My experience is that the stock bumper brackets
won't stand much towing with a hitch welded to
the bumper (the bolts hold up, the brackets fail
around the bumper bolt holes). I've used hitches
like this for light towing after making stronger
brackets, but I'd still shy away from this for
anything but the lightest loads (If you make
brackets, they should be beefier than stock but
still fail in a rear-ender. I bought a parts bus
once that the guy made such beefy brackets that
the frame buckled when rear ended!)
<P>
The previous owner of the '65 that I retired to the scrap
yard last summer (yes, I saved all the straight
metal) had an interesting fix to prolong the
bumper bracket's life with a hitch welded to the
bumper. He drilled 3/8" holes through the body
near the top of the engine compartment,
installed eye bolts, and suspended the bumper
with turnbuckles & chain! Creative way to take
some of the load off the brackets, but I'd only
do it to a junker! I did find the eye bolts
handy for tying off canoes, sailboards, and the
like, though ;)
<P>
My opinion, for what it's worth, is to cut the
hitch off the bumper and buy/build something
that attaches to the bracket mounts on the frame
(as has been described recently) or build a
Westy style hitch, which should be described in
the archives.

The original owner of our 1970 Campmobile towed a small travel
trailer all the way from Bend, OR to Fairbanks, AK and back over the course of a
Summer.  He carried everything he could inside the bus, to minimize the weight
of the towed load.
<P>
Immediately upon his return the engine and transaxle gave up the ghost.
<P>
A couple of years later, after we bought the van, I removed the
coil-over shocks he'd had installed on the rear.  Before I could install new
gas shocks I had to have the shock towers completely rebuilt.  They'd been
literally torn apart by the stresses imposed by the coil-over shocks.
<P>
We also had to completely rebuild the rear hubs, replacing the
severely damaged axle bearings, and replace all the CV joints.
<P>
Would I consider towing a boat or trailer with our
Campmobile?  Yes, but only lightweight tows and only for relatively short distances.  I've
seen (and am still paying for) the long-term effects...

My 71 bus weighed a tad over 3000 lbs, pretty much empty. The Book says:

All weights in american pounds (lbs). from the 1973 bus Owner's Manual.
<P>
Interestingly enough, my 88 bus weighs in at 3640 lbs (no people, no gas, but
with a box of tools and other junk) and maxes out at 5200 lbs (i think that's
right).
<P>
A neat thing to do is to find a truck stop (for the 18-wheelers) with a
truck scale, and pay them (usually about $5-10) to weigh the bus. They have
three "pads" (front axle, drive axle, and trailer axle) ... and you can split
the bus across the front and drive pads to get an idea of how much you weigh
front and back. They give you a printout as a momento. :)

GVWR stands for gross vehicle weight rating.  That means the maximum weight
that the vehicle is designed to support while driving.  Many things
determine this rating, like capacity of the tires, suspension, frame, the
ability of the brakes to stop a given mass, etc.  The rating includes
everything in and on the vehicle including people, fuel, cargo, and
everything!  It does not include the total weight of a trailer, just the
tongue weight.  The rating that includes all of the trailer is the GCVWR, or
gross combined vehicle weight rating.  I don't know when this rating, GCVWR,
came into use.  I've never seen it on an older vehicle, just newer ones.

Does anybody know what amount of weight a 1600 Bus will easily tow?

An early baywindow bus (non-camper) has a cargo capacity of 2000
pounds, including the driver and passengers. It doesn't particularly
care whether this load is inside or on a trailer.  If you have a 500
pound trailer loaded with 1000 pounds of load and you weigh 200 pounds
the total load is 1700 pounds, so you will be within the load limit of
the bus.
<P>
You have to have a hitch capable of handing the trailer, and the
trailer has to have brakes if it grosses over 1000 pounds in most
states.
<P>
Don't expect terrific performance from your bus either loaded or with
a trailer!

I don't think that logic works in this situation.  I'm no engineer,
but it seems to me that cargo capacity and towing capacity do not translate
directly.  Cargo capacity has a lot to do with suspension
components, frame strength, tire load rating, etc.  Towing capacity would be more
concerned with HP and torque, and secondarily with tongue weight, which would
depend as much on hitch design as on cargo capacity.

You are correct.  A vehicle with a properly installed hitch should be
able to tow more weight than the same vehicle can itself carry.
<P>
My estimate was a worst-case one, as it is very difficult to install a
load-carrying hitch on a bus.  The best you can get is about 200
pounds tongue weight which will allow a 2000 pound trailer to be
towed.  Having loaded my bus to capacity, I wouldn't want to travel
too far fully loaded.  It'll do it, but the performance was, well,
uninspiring.
