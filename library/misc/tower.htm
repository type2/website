<p><font size="+1">My experience is that the stock bumper brackets
won't stand much towing with a hitch welded to the bumper (the
bolts hold up, the brackets fail around the bumper bolt holes).
I've used hitches like this for light towing after making stronger
brackets, but I'd still shy away from this for anything but the
lightest loads (If you make brackets, they should be beefier than
stock but still fail in a rear-ender. I bought a parts bus once
that the guy made such beefy brackets that the frame buckled when
rear ended!)</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The previous owner of the '65 that I retired to
the scrap yard last summer (yes, I saved all the straight metal)
had an interesting fix to prolong the bumper bracket's life with a
hitch welded to the bumper. He drilled 3/8" holes through the body
near the top of the engine compartment, installed eye bolts, and
suspended the bumper with turnbuckles & chain! Creative way to take
some of the load off the brackets, but I'd only do it to a junker!
I did find the eye bolts handy for tying off canoes, sailboards,
and the like, though ;)</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">My opinion, for what it's worth, is to cut the
hitch off the bumper and buy/build something that attaches to the
bracket mounts on the frame (as has been described recently) or
build a Westy style hitch, which should be described in the
archives.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">The original owner of our 1970 Campmobile towed
a small travel trailer all the way from Bend, OR to Fairbanks, AK
and back over the course of a Summer. He carried everything he
could inside the bus, to minimize the weight of the towed
load.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Immediately upon his return the engine and
transaxle gave up the ghost.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">A couple of years later, after we bought the
van, I removed the coil-over shocks he'd had installed on the rear.
Before I could install new gas shocks I had to have the shock
towers completely rebuilt. They'd been literally torn apart by the
stresses imposed by the coil-over shocks.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">We also had to completely rebuild the rear hubs,
replacing the severely damaged axle bearings, and replace all the
CV joints.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Would I consider towing a boat or trailer with
our Campmobile? Yes, but only lightweight tows and only for
relatively short distances. I've seen (and am still paying for) the
long-term effects...</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">All weights in american pounds (lbs). from the
1973 bus Owner's Manual.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Interestingly enough, my 88 bus weighs in at
3640 lbs (no people, no gas, but with a box of tools and other
junk) and maxes out at 5200 lbs (i think that's right).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">A neat thing to do is to find a truck stop (for
the 18-wheelers) with a truck scale, and pay them (usually about
$5-10) to weigh the bus. They have three "pads" (front axle, drive
axle, and trailer axle) ... and you can split the bus across the
front and drive pads to get an idea of how much you weigh front and
back. They give you a printout as a momento. :)</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">GVWR stands for gross vehicle weight rating.
That means the maximum weight that the vehicle is designed to
support while driving. Many things determine this rating, like
capacity of the tires, suspension, frame, the ability of the brakes
to stop a given mass, etc. The rating includes everything in and on
the vehicle including people, fuel, cargo, and everything! It does
not include the total weight of a trailer, just the tongue weight.
The rating that includes all of the trailer is the GCVWR, or gross
combined vehicle weight rating. I don't know when this rating,
GCVWR, came into use. I've never seen it on an older vehicle, just
newer ones.</font></p>

<blockquote><font size="+1"><i>An early baywindow bus (non-camper)
has a cargo capacity of 2000 pounds, including the driver and
passengers. It doesn't particularly care whether this load is
inside or on a trailer. If you have a 500 pound trailer loaded with
1000 pounds of load and you weigh 200 pounds the total load is 1700
pounds, so you will be within the load limit of the bus.</i></font>
<p><font size="+1"><i>You have to have a hitch capable of handing
the trailer, and the trailer has to have brakes if it grosses over
1000 pounds in most states.</i></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><i>Don't expect terrific performance from your
bus either loaded or with a trailer!</i></font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Kevin Field responds:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I don't think that logic works in this
situation. I'm no engineer, but it seems to me that cargo capacity
and towing capacity do not translate directly. Cargo capacity has a
lot to do with suspension components, frame strength, tire load
rating, etc. Towing capacity would be more concerned with HP and
torque, and secondarily with tongue weight, which would depend as
much on hitch design as on cargo capacity.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">George Lyle responds:</font></p>
<blockquote><font size="+1"><i>You are correct. A vehicle with a
properly installed hitch should be able to tow more weight than the
same vehicle can itself carry.</i></font>
<p><font size="+1"><i>My estimate was a worst-case one, as it is
very difficult to install a load-carrying hitch on a bus. The best
you can get is about 200 pounds tongue weight which will allow a
2000 pound trailer to be towed. Having loaded my bus to capacity, I
wouldn't want to travel too far fully loaded. It'll do it, but the
performance was, well, uninspiring.</i></font></p>
