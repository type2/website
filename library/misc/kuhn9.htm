  <h3>Protecting Your VW</h3>

  <h3>by Robert Kuhn</h3>
  <hr size="2">

  <p><font size="+1">If you've never had your VW stolen from you then count
  your blessings. If you've ever had your bike stolen from you when you were
  a kid, having your VW stolen feels 100 times worse. When I had
  <b><font size="+1">my</font></b> Bug stolen, I went through a range of
  emotions:</font></p>

  <ul>
    <li><font size="+1">Confusion ... "Is there where I parked
    her?"</font></li>

    <li><font size="+1">Denial ... "No ... NO-NO! NO! NO! NO! NO!
    NO!"</font></li>

    <li><font size="+1">A state of high irkness (really ticked off!) ... (*
    LOTS OF POTTY MOUTHED LANGUAGE *)</font></li>

    <li><font size="+1">Hope ... "I'll find her!" .. or .. "The Police will
    find her!"</font></li>

    <li><font size="+1">Acceptance ... "She's gone ..."</font></li>
  </ul>

  <p><font size="+1">You start to wonder if there was something that you
  could've done to help prevent this. And that's what this page was going to
  be about but then I started to think that it might serve the opposite
  purpose; help someone break into a VW and make off with it.</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1">This would be bad!</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1">And thus I decided to just do an editorial.</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1">Since there is virtually no way to ensure that your VW
  will never be broken into let alone stolen, at least within the law, we can
  at least take some basic steps to help prevent your car from being messed
  with.</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1">The first thing that you have to rememeber is that
  <b><font size="+1">IF SOMEONE WANTS TO GET IN YOUR CAR, THEY WILL DO
  IT!</font></b> <b><font size="+1">IF SOMEONE WANTS TO MAKE OFF WITH YOUR
  CAR, THEY WILL DO IT!</font></b> As sad as it sounds, these are two givens
  that can be added to the other two givens in life; death and
  taxes.</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1"><img src="../images/redblink.gif" vspace="4" hspace="4"
  width="28" height="28" alt="blinking LED"><b><font size="+1">Car alarms
  --</font></b> These are good investments, but don't totally rely on them. A
  study was done a few years ago concerning the alarm siren. The study group
  set off an alarm in a busy area and no one paid attention to it. Probably
  because so many alarms are false alarms that most people have turned a deaf
  ear towards them.</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1">Pretty sad, really. One feature of the alarm is the
  panic mode where you can set the alarm off manually in the event that you
  are in danger. I guess you can yell while the siren is on.</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1">A good decent alarm shouldn't cost more than your car.
  Don't be taken in by flashy pictures and logos on the box. These are
  marketing tricks. If you take a peek at a <a href=
  "http://www.clifford.com/">Clifford</a> box, it's pretty plain. Most
  expensive also doesn't mean the best. I feel that a basic alarm should have
  a decent shock sensor (a simple sensor that acts very much like a tilt
  switch found in pinball machines ... when the car is struck, it sets off
  the alarm) and ignition kill. <img src="../images/yelbug1.jpg" vspace="10"
  hspace="10" align="right" width="250" height="237" alt=
  "Stripped yellow Bug, rear view"> Other nice items would be the ability to
  tie in electric locks and windows ... my alarm will lock my doors when it's
  activated and unlock the doors when I disarm the alarm. On the BMW, we did
  the same thing and tied in the power windows so that it will close the
  windows when armed. You can also program the alarm so that it rolls up to a
  pre defined height in the event that you have to leave your dog in the
  car.</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1">Another nice item, but not needed, is a motion sensor.
  We have this in our BMW. If the windows are open for whatever reason, or if
  someone tries to gain access by the sunroof, the minute they stick their
  arm inside the car, the motion sensor (or radar) will catch it and trigger
  the alarm. This is a nice feature if you have a convertible. I had this
  when I had a Fiat Spyder.</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1">Other nifty sensors include --</font></p>

  <ul>
    <li><font size="+1">Glass breakage; detects the sound of breaking
    glass.</font></li>

    <li><font size="+1">Voltage; detects when there's a drop in voltage. Some
    thieves will actually drill a hole in the main car battery to bypass the
    alarm. Others will simply snip the battery wires. Some of your better
    alarms will have a hidden back up battery for the alarm when this
    happens. Most of your alarms will detect changes in the voltage.
    Sometimes a normal door pin which is used to trigger the alarm will fail
    for whatever reason, but the dome light will come on ... the alarm will
    take this as an unauthorized entry.</font></li>

    <li>
      <font size="+1">Scamblers; Though this really isn't a sensor, it's more
      of a jammer. Since 99.9% of all alarms are armed and disarmed via radio
      freqs, someone got smart and used a scanner to go through the various
      freqs until he found the right freq to disarm the car. I believe that
      <a href=
      "http://www.ungo.com/us/en/products/2007/ungo_security/index.html">Ungo</a>
      was one of the first alarms that had a jammer which would jam attempts
      to descramble its alarm.</font>

      <p><font size="+1"><!-- Bad links 2007-01-28 - removed - mcr
            Clifford Electronics has a good <a href="http://www.clifford.com/scanners.html">description</a> as to how this is done.

            </font><p><font size=+1>
            <a href="http://www.clifford.com/acg.html">Code Grabbing</a> is the current trick being used by thieves today.
--></font></p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p><font size="+1">Some alarms offer paging which means that you have to
  carry this pager with you and when the alarm is triggered, it will page the
  pager. Though this is a nifty idea, the range is limited and it still could
  be a false alarm. And if you already carry a regular pager, you kinda look
  like a geek wearing two pagers.</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1">Most alarms also offer a valet mode. This is somewhat
  useful ... we have it and I don't think I've ever really used it even when
  I had my car valet parked.</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1"><img src="../images/siren.gif" vspace="10" hspace="10"
  align="left" width="120" height="129" alt="Car alarm siren"> Passive and
  active arming is good and bad. If you're one of those people that forget to
  arm their alarm, then this feature is for you. If you're like most of us,
  it's second nature to arm the car. On some of your better alarms, there's a
  timed delay which will automatically arm your car. The alarm in our BMW
  does that. After X amount of minutes has passsed, it will silently arm
  itself (doesn't chirp the alarm or flash the lights).</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1">In conclusion, I still recommend that a car alarm be
  purchased and installed by a professional. But I wouldn't totally rely on
  them!</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1">Some car insurance companies will give you a break if
  you have it professionally installed. Installing a basic car alarm is about
  as easy as installing a car stereo. At least it is for me. It's only when
  you start to add on all the nifty features is where it gets
  complicated.</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1">A good decent/basic alarm is the Prestige alarm by
  Audiovox.</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1">Note -- Most alarms come with a pair of decals which you
  are supposed to put on your window to tell everyone that you have an "Acme
  Car Alarm". I discourage this. Some "Protected by ..." decals actually go
  to list what kind of alarm it is; "This car protected by Acme Car Alarm".
  Some don't list the make/model of the alarm, but the decal itself is
  sometimes all that is needed. The reason I don't recommend that you use the
  supplied decals is because that's all a thief needs to know. If he/she
  knows that you have an Acme alarm, then they may already know how to bypass
  it. If you feel that you need to advertise that you have an alarm, look for
  a generic decal. I found some at my local Pep Boys. It said "WARNING --
  ALARM DEVICE" ... 'nuff said.</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1"><img src="../images/redblink.gif" vspace="4" hspace="4"
  width="28" height="28" alt="blinking LED"><b><font size="+1">The use of
  just a LED --</font></b> Though this will deter some thieves, some just
  don't care and will still break into your car.</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1"><img src="../images/redblink.gif" vspace="4" hspace="4"
  width="28" height="28" alt="blinking LED"><b><font size="+1">The Club
  --</font></b> This is a good device. It may not protect your stereo, but at
  least it will help deter the thug from making off with your car. Again,
  don't totally rely on this device. If the thief really wants to make off
  with your car, he/she will get past it. It's no secret that they will saw
  through the steering wheel to remove the Club. The people that made the
  Club have countered this by making "The Shield". Still, the Club is still a
  good investment. It also makes a nice weapon when needed.</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1">The other day, as I was walking through the parking lot
  of a large shopping mall, I spotted three cars that had the Club, but they
  weren't installed! They were laying on the floor and on the seat! It only
  takes a few seconds to install the Club! So, if you have it or got it as a
  gift, <b><font size="+1">USE IT!</font></b></font></p>

  <p><font size="+1"><a href="http://www.geneberg.com/">Gene Berg
  Eneterprises</a> makes a nifty locking shifter. This allows you to lock the
  shifter with a key. This along with the Club makes the thief think twice
  about making off with your car.</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1"><img src="../images/redblink.gif" vspace="4" hspace="4"
  width="28" height="28" alt="blinking LED"><b><font size="+1">"Lojack"
  --</font></b> In some states, "Lojack" is offered by the local Police
  department. Though none of my friends have this service, I have read a good
  deal about it. In a nut shell, the Police installs a radio device somewhere
  on your car ... when your car is reported stolen, the Police activate this
  homing device and track the where abouts of the car. I have read many
  success stories. The downside seems to be the price of the service. Some
  say that it's not worth it. I think it's a neat idea and I think that the
  costs are probably high because of the small number of people that are
  using it.</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1"><img src="../images/redblink.gif" vspace="4" hspace="4"
  width="28" height="28" alt="blinking LED"><b><font size="+1">Common sense
  --</font></b> This is probably the most important thing when it comes to
  protecting your car. If you have to park you car in an area where you don't
  feel that it's safe, then it probably isn't. Look for another area that you
  feel is safe. Sometimes parking under a well lit area might not be a safe
  area, this actually may draw attention to your car and make it easier for
  the thieves to gain access. Parking in large structures are also not safe.
  I find that it's best to park near one of the entrances or where there are
  many cars around you. It's sort of along the lines of "Safety in numbers".
  A friend of mine was so paranoid about parking his car next to others
  because of fear of being dinged that he parked his car away from the other
  cars in the parking structure ... well, since it was parked away from the
  others, it stood out and was broken into.</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1">Lock your doors. I know this sounds stupid but you'd be
  amazed at how many cars I see parked where the doors are
  unlocked!</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1">Roll up the windows. Even an inch opening is all that is
  needed in some cases to pop the door! If you're worried about how hot it
  might get inside your car, buy a sun shade for the window. These actually
  work! <img src="../images/yelbug2.jpg" vspace="10" hspace="10" align="left"
  width="421" height="206" alt="Stripped yellow Bug, side view"> Don't leave
  things out in the open that might tempt someone. Backpacks, briefcases and
  other things (even a carbdboard box) that are in plain sight is all that is
  needed to tempt someone. That sign that reads "DO NOT LEAVE VALUABLES IN
  YOUR CAR" couldn't have been worded better!</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1">If you are ever car jacked, let them have your car! It's
  not worth it! Beware of those car jacking devices. I read an article once
  about a security device which was supposed to render the car useless after
  about 5 minutes. When the victim is told to get out of the car, he/she
  activates said device ... the car is driven off by the thief and after
  about 5 minutes, the car stops and the thief is unable to restart the car
  and thus leaves it.</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1">"Hm", thinks I, "That sounds like a pretty neat idea"
  until I read further when this particular device failed. This poor woman
  got car jacked, she activated the device and the car went about 30 yards
  before it stopped! After a few failed attempts to restart the car, the car
  jacker got out and shot the lady and then took off! According to the maker
  of the device, they were unsure as to why the device failed.</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1">This was back in 1990 when I read this
  article.</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1"><!-- Bad links 2007-01-28 - removed - mcr
    Clifford makes a device called <a href="http://www.clifford.com/bljax.html">Black Jax</a> which is very much like the one I just mentioned.  With the experience that Clifford Electronics has, I would think that theirs works as advertised.

  <p><font size="+1">The Bug that's featured on this page was not a result of
  being broken into, but I have see Bugs where all that was left was the body
  and pan! Mine was one of them. )c=</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1">Some of the many suggestions that I've read and heard
  over the years (that has made me chuckle a bit) have been:</font></p>

  <ul>
    <li><font size="+1">Rig up a bomb.</font></li>

    <li><font size="+1">Electrify the car so the sucker gets
    zapped!</font></li>

    <li><font size="+1">Rig up a time bomb that will explode at a later time
    (like say 5 minutes after being stolen).</font></li>

    <li><font size="+1">Have hidden paint nozzles installed in the car so
    that the thief is sprayed with this non-washable paint. Makes it easier
    to track down said thief.</font></li>

    <li><font size="+1">Leave a hungy Rotwieler, Doberman or Pit Bull in the
    car.</font></li>

    <li><font size="+1">Retinal verifcation. If the eyeball doesn't match any
    of the predefined ones in the onboard computer's database, the car blows
    up.</font></li>

    <li><font size="+1">If someone breakes into the car and doesn't disarm
    the alarm by a certain time (say 1 minute), the car will slam the doors
    shut, roll up all the windows, turn itself on and with the aid of GPS, it
    will drive itself to the nearest Police station. A pre-recorded message
    would then be played once the car arrived at the Police station saying
    that the person(s) in the car are to be booked. (this sort of has a
    RoboCop-ish theme to it, but I liked it).</font></li>
