<h3>Air Conditioning Comments</h3>
<p>by John Anderson and Ken Hooper</p>
<hr size="2">
<blockquote><font size="+1"><i>As I was driving around earlier
(116* today) I was wondering if any later model "loafs" ('72-'79)
ever had Air Conditioners.</i></font></blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">John Anderson writes:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Yes, 2 main models, the VW Cool installation or
a DPD unit, the "COOL" installation was either ducts above
drivers/passengers heads in regular van or under dash unit in
Westy, the DPD is a nicer under dash unit with 2 blower fans.
Condensors under center of bus on either and possible under front
in front of axle as well. DPD condensor with nice louvered steel
gaurd, VW usually plaster metal lath screen. Both typically have a
couple of 12V fans on the main condensor, a good problem place to
check if you get a whine when you turn it on or if inefective
sitting still. Oh, some early Westy ('72 - '75) had a funky one
that vented on top of the cabinets on the left side I'm not sure
who made that one.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I have both under dash installations, the VW is
pitifull, the DPD slightly better than pitiful, I have been
informed the ceiling unit no better. Too much volume too little air
moved even though they recycle, plus it kills engines. Frankly
though I do admit the under dash units can keep the front
passengers in a Westy almost comfortable on a 95F day. Both use
archaic York compressors on brackets mounted to the left rear of
the T4 near the oil filter, a pulley behind the fan pulley is the
drive with an idler on the belt for tension, the belt is often a
very odd long thin size, which I will measure and post some time.
The VW bracket system is nicer and more easily adjustable. No
installation I have ever seen has made a very good attempt at
sealing the hole in the shroud cut for the compressor a critical
error IMHO. I have seen maybe 8 vans with these installations and
owned 3.</font></p>
<blockquote><font size="+1"><i>Anyone ever tried to retrofit
one?</i></font></blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Here would be my rec, make sure engine is solid,
find the DPD underdash unit andcondensors off a junkyard bus (not
too tough actually) Call ICE systems (advertise in the mags for
years) they want about $400 last I checked for a modern rotary
Sankyo pump with mounts and maybe hose. Retrofit will not be too
tough. They will likely want you to go 134A I would not reccomend
it as marginal as the system is it needs the extra capacity of R12,
even with the cost. And tint your windows and leave windows down
when out of the car. In 100+F degree weather I really doubt any
system is going to work.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Ken Hooper writes:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">While I'm willing to grant that York compressors
are not worth two dead flies at air conditioning, for lack of a
contrary, those who go junking and find one should note
that:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">They are worth money to 4x4 types. The York
compressor employs a peculiar design that enables it to double as
an air compressor (this has to do with the way it is lubricated).
Hardcore Jeep offroad folks desire these highly. They deflate and
inflate tires routinely, and more importantly they go and buy
expensive locking differentials that require an on-board compressor
and tank to work. A welded tubular rear bumper constitutes a tank,
but it requires a York to provide air pressure.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">So don't throw them in the trash, trade
them!<br></font></p>
