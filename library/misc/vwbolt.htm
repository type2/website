<h3>VW Bolts</h3>
<p>by Brian Verbeek</p>
<hr size="2">
<p><font size="+1">&gt;I need one more bolt for the rear bumper
mount<br>
&gt;of a late bay.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;Anything unusual about these? Can I go to Home<br>
&gt;Depot and buy anything that's similar?<br></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I have some new ones for my '73 single cab, i'll
describe them here, I bought them at the local VW dealer, The bolt
is VW part# N 010 253 7, and the washer is 211 707 189, the brand
of the bolt is Lobo, the size is M10x20mm (i actually measured 21mm
long without the bolt head) and it is zinc plated and yellow
passivated, it looks like it's cadmium plated, the bolthead is
17mm. The washer is a wavy washer of about 1mm thick and has a
10.5mm hole and the outer diameter is 25mm.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Hardware is cheap to buy through the dealer,
often they are even cheaper than the average hardware store, you're
still not sure whether you'll get *exactly* the same as what
originally came on your car but you are sure you'll get quality
stuff of the correct size.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">VW works with N numbers, the N stands for "Norm
teile" or "standardized parts" these are parts like nuts, bolts,
washers, cotter pins, grommets etc. VW attached a description of
the part to the N-number, the description includes things like
tensile strength, fit, size, special things like such and such
radius there and there, and surface treatment like zinc plated,
yellow passivated, phosphated etc. these part where supplied by
several german suppliers like Lobo, Kamax, Graeka, FHS, 3F,
etc.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">There's a microfiche that list all these
descriptions and as long as you find the piece of hardware that
exactly matches the decription you have in fact an original
replacement, VW does exactly the same except they order them by the
million i guess.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The 211 707 189 part number of the washer tells
us it's specifically made for VW, it's not a standard
part.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">If you are not concerned about originality you
can go to the hardware store and ask for a metric bolt of 10x20mm
and a (maybe a wavy washer of 10x25mm.</font></p>
