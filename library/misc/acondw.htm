<h3>Air Conditioner Servicing Advice</h3>
<p>by Michael Lewis</p>
<hr size="2">
<p><font size="+1">Servicing automotive air conditioning,
particularly with R-12 freon IMHO, is better left to the pros who
do it every day.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">There are several weak points in most systems,
most notably, the compressor seal, which is often a carbon seal
relying on a thin film of oil for complete sealing. That's why
older GM compressors are particularly bad. Many do not get run in
the winter, the oil dries out and the freon escapes. Those long
runs of hoses are subject to the same deterioration problems as our
VW gas lines, however there is considerable pressure on the pump
side. The system, including lines, evaporator and condenser must be
completely leak free.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">To properly charge an A/C system, it must be
thoroughly evacuated, cleaned and a considerable vacuum applied
with a vacuum pump. The reciever-dryer should be replaced at
service time, as even opening the system can allow moisture inside
which will shut the system down, first hot day.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Last, handling of pressurized freon is
dangerous, particularly if it escapes and hits the eyes. Corneal
detachment can occur if this happens. If you do decide to do this,
wear proper mask type eye protection which completely surrounds the
eyes, good leather gloves and make sure you get quality gauges. You
_can_ pull a head of vacuum with the compressor, but nothing like
what they can pull in a shop with pro gear. That vacuum is darn
near the most important part.<br></font></p>
