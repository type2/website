<p><font size="+1">(David Easterwood warns:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Be VERY careful when jacking up the rear
according to this image...</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">You would be better off jacking at the
reinforcement where the cross member &amp; outrigger meets the
longitudinal frame member about 6 inches forward of where they are
supporting it in the image.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Notice there are 2 small tubes an inch or two
outboard of where they are lifting in the image... those house the
hand brake cable and the clutch cable.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">A PO of my 68 jacked there &amp; bent the clutch
cable housing which now puts too much pressure on the cable
resulting in a very heavy clutch pedal action and I will have a
hell of a time replacing the clutch cable when it
breaks.)</font></p>
