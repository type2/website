<h3>Cable Lubrication and Installation

What I do is put grease onto the cable generously as I feed it into
the tube.  This works for all cables (clutch, speedo, etc.) that go
into a tube or sheath.
<P>
If the cable cannot be removed (or I'm too lazy to do so), I mix
gasoline and bearing grease to give the grease a "pourable, thick"
consistancy.  This will work its way into cables, then the gasoline
will evaporate leaving the grease.  This stuff also works for lubing
noisy speedometers, but you have to fabricate some sort of "funnel" to
guide the gas/grease to where it is needed.
<P> 
For cables, you can also use motorcycle chain lube, which comes in an
aerosol can.  This stuff is a _sticky_ grease in a solvent carrier  If
you seal the end of the tube to the little tube from the chain lube
can, you can pressure-feed lube through the tube.  Messy, but it works!
<P>
Unless you live in the Arctic, avoid light oils and WD-40.  They don't
last all that long.
