<h3>Cable Lubrication and Installation</h3>
<p>by George Lyle</p>
<hr size="2">
<p><font size="+1">What I do is put grease onto the cable
generously as I feed it into the tube. This works for all cables
(clutch, speedo, etc.) that go into a tube or sheath.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">If the cable cannot be removed (or I'm too lazy
to do so), I mix gasoline and bearing grease to give the grease a
"pourable, thick" consistancy. This will work its way into cables,
then the gasoline will evaporate leaving the grease. This stuff
also works for lubing noisy speedometers, but you have to fabricate
some sort of "funnel" to guide the gas/grease to where it is
needed.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">For cables, you can also use motorcycle chain
lube, which comes in an aerosol can. This stuff is a _sticky_
grease in a solvent carrier If you seal the end of the tube to the
little tube from the chain lube can, you can pressure-feed lube
through the tube. Messy, but it works!</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Unless you live in the Arctic, avoid light oils
and WD-40. They don't last all that long.<br></font></p>
