<h3>Inexpensive Digital Oil Temp Gauge</h3>

<p><font size="+1">A while ago I posted about this idea about using
a digital thermometer (for meat or candy) to monitor oil temps...so
I did it before a long haul in my '78 Westy. Here's the method I
used:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The thermometer came from local market--they
range around $15. Open the case (as for battery change), the metal
tube holding the thermistor pops right out of the plastic end if
you twist its slot with a screwdriver.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I cut the 2 wires and spliced/soldered in 2
wires of a phone wire (these have a nice tough sheathing---I can
use the other 2 for another gauge someday. Then I used epoxy to
fasten a 12" brass tube (whatever size just slides into the oil
checker tube- 3/16"?) over the existing metal tube with the
thermistor inside, overlapping about 1.5". I also ran the epoxy
down the tube to cover the exposed phone wires in case their
plastic color coded sheaths were heat sensitive. At the top of the
tube I had soldered on a piece of brass plate with a hole drilled
in it, allowing about 1/2" of the tube to extend above it. The
plate acts as a stop/grabbing point; the 1/2" extension is used to
grip the rubber/plastic hosing I put over the phone wire where it's
exposed in the engine compartment. Be careful to equal the length
of the stock dipstick, which is just about 2 cm above the sump
bottom.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">The wire I ran by the spare tire well (drilled
hole in the rear westy closet floor), and ran it behind the fridge,
closet, and under the mat behind the driver seat and under the feet
and then behind the dash to come out next to the left door post.
The gauge is only about 1" across and sits nicely against the
pillar and on the top of the dash (doublestick mounting tape to
hold it). This thing lasts a year on continuously with a button
battery, but has a switch. My temps are directly
rpm(speed)dependent- hauling at 80 down some hills in NY state, I
got it up to 270 deg; typical 60-65 mph stuff was around 230 -240
deg. This 100 degree weather here got that latter temp up to about
250. Is this high? Can't have hurt, since the stock engine is
purring at 203,250 never rebuilt miles!</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Addendum for the Library: 5,000 mi on this setup
now, and it works fine. Be careful about the thermistor sliding up
in the tube before you glue in your splices; it did not seem to be
fastened within the tube, leading me to think one could simply
slide it into a longer tube with the end soldered shut? Then the
overlapped gluing may be unneeded. However, I'd still run epoxy
down the tube with the wiring to immobilize it and enhance heat
transfer to it.<br></font></p>
