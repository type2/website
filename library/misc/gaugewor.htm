<h3>How Gauges Work</h3>

<p><font size="+1">Electrical gauges are only of two types they
measure volts or amps.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">A volt meter has a high resistance and is put in
parallel with the circuit at the point voltage is measured
at.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">A amp meter has a low resistance and is placed
in series with the circuit.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Your high school physics were you learnt about
ohms law and resistance in circuits is all you need to recalibrate
gauges to different ranges.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">To talk specifically about your two temp
gauges.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Both of the sender units contain a
thermo-couple. This is a junction between two dissimilar metals
which when heated changes resistance and produces a small
current.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">When the junction is heated the current will
always flow in the same direction for the same two metals - this in
fact gives an increase in resistance in one direction and a
reduction in the other!</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">So the oil temp gauge is a volt meter which
measures the increase in voltage at the gauge due to a reduction in
resistance the thermo-couple in the sender; hence the requirement
for an external voltage.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">But the head temp gauge is an ammeter measuring
the current produced by the thermo-couple in the sender; hence the
sender and gauge need no external power.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The choice of type of gauge (voltmeter or
ammeter) is probably governed by the economics of making a
thermo-couple with suitable characteristics for the required
operating temperature range rather than the cost of the
gauge.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Other gauges like an electrical vacuum/pressure
gauge will have some means of changing a variable resistance in the
sender unit and are of the voltmeter type so require an external
voltage.<br></font></p>
