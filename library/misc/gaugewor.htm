Electrical gauges are only of two types they measure volts or amps.
<p>
A volt meter has a high resistance and is put in parallel with the
circuit at the point voltage is measured at.
<p>
A amp meter has a low resistance and is placed in series with the
circuit.
<p>
Your high school physics were you learnt about ohms law and resistance
in circuits is all you need to recalibrate gauges to different ranges.
<p>

To talk specifically about your two temp gauges.
<p>

Both of the sender units contain a thermo-couple. This is a junction
between two dissimilar metals which when heated changes resistance and
produces a small current.
<p>

When the junction is heated the current will always flow in the same
direction for the same two metals - this in fact gives an increase in
resistance in one direction and a reduction in the other!
<p>

So the oil temp gauge is a volt meter which measures the increase in
voltage at the gauge due to a reduction in resistance the thermo-couple in the sender; hence the requirement for an external voltage.
<p>

But the head temp gauge is an ammeter measuring the current produced by the thermo-couple in the sender; hence the sender and gauge need no
external power.
<p>

The choice of type of gauge (voltmeter or ammeter) is probably governed by the economics of making a thermo-couple with suitable characteristics for the required operating temperature range rather than the cost of the gauge.
<p>

Other gauges like an electrical vacuum/pressure gauge will have some
means of changing a variable resistance in the sender unit and are of
the voltmeter type so require an external voltage.
