<p><font size="+1"><b>Procedure for checking 1973 - 1978 gas gauge
and circuit</b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">This procedure does not require removal of the
dash. The terminals can be accessed from under the dash, behind the
gauge. If you have the gauge cluster out and want to test it,
connect the battery to ground connection first! It might be wise to
turn the key off, remove the "+" (positive) wire from the ignition
coil and secure it away from ground.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Tools required</b></font></p>
<ul>
<li><font size="+1">Volt/ohmmeter capable of measuring 12v
(preferably with a needle, not digital), or a test
light.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">It is best to use alligator clips on the leads
or small electronic test leads with alligator clips</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">10 ohm 1/4&nbsp; watt resistor</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">22 ohm 1/4 watt resistor</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">47 ohm 1/4 watt resistor</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font size="+1">Before testing it is necessary to find out which
vibrator is installed. The zener diode type has 2 lugs that can be
pressed together and remove the back, to service the lamp. I have
included a diagram above (fig1-1).</font></p>
<ol>
<li><font size="+1">To test the zener diode type, fig 1-1, remove
the wire from terminal "J", switch on the ignition, and measure the
voltage at "J". Zero voltage indicates a faulty stabilizer. Remove
the lid, take out the bulb and replace it if required. To check the
diode, use an ohmmeter, disconnect the leads from terminal "+" and
"J". Connect the ohmmeter from "J" to the ground (speedometer
head). Read the resistance, it will be either low or high. Flip the
meter leads and test again. The reading should be the opposite as
the last reading. If the reading is the same, the diode is
faulty.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Test for power at the vibrator, set the
voltmeter to read 12 volts DC, clip your voltmeter negative "-"
lead on the dash ground (best place as this proves that the dash IS
grounded: check it!). It is VERY IMPORTANT that there is a ground
to the vibrator/dash chassis for correct operation, so if you are
doing this out of the vehicle, make sure you connect a ground to
the dash. You can use a chassis ground, but make sure that the dash
is grounded. Have I said that enough? Clip the voltmeter positive
"+" lead on the vibrator terminal marked "+" (black wire) marked
"TP1" on fig. 1-3. Make sure the leads are only touching the
appropriate terminals. Turn on ignition key. The meter should read
approx. 10 - 13 volts. This is good. Go to step 3 (alternately, you
can substitute a test light for the voltmeter, clip the test light
on the chassis ground, and touch the probe to the "+" terminal (TP1
on fig 1 - 3) on the vibrator. The light should be on, stay on, and
be bright).</font>
<p><font size="+1">If you do not get 10-13 volts or no light here,
make sure the key is on! Make sure you have good ground. Do not
continue until you find the fuse (try fuse 11 for a 73- 76, and
fuse 12 for others) and make sure you have power here. It is
usually the second fuse from the right.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">If you're running into problems at this point ,
it might be wise to turn the key off, remove the "+" wire from the
ignition coil and secure it away from ground; put a piece of tape
on it for now. This prevents you from damaging the ignition
circuit. When you locate the fuse and make sure there is power at
the vibrator terminal, come back here.</font></p>
</li>
<li><font size="+1">Test for bi-metallic vibrator operation (you
can measure the resistance from "TP1" on fig 1-3 to ground on the
vibrator and should get about 30-60 ohms). Move the voltmeter "+"
lead clip or test light probe, to the other terminal on the
vibrator ("TP2" on fig 1-3). The light will blink and the voltmeter
needle should "hop" or bounce up to about 3-5 volts. The bounce
should be even, and about 1 sec up then 1 sec down. This is why a
digital meter is hard to use here. The numbers will just jump all
over as the voltage here is pulsating. If the needle "hops" or
bounces then the vibrator is working fine, if the light is blinking
then the vibrator is fine. If it is a different result the vibrator
is defective, if the light stays on, the vibrator is defective and
it is likely that the gauge is burned out as well.</font>
<p><font size="+1">If you get no light or meter movement, it is
likely that the vibrator is defective...or you are not testing at
the right terminal.</font></p>
</li>
<li><font size="+1">Test for gauge operation. If test 1 and 2 are
fine, you have power and the vibrator is working. Remove the wire
from the sender side of the gauge and connect a jumper cable here,
at "TP2" on fig 1-3. Connect a 10 ohm resistor to the jumper cable.
Connect another jumper cable from the resistor to the chassis
ground. With the key "on", the gauge should read 1/1 or close.
Substitute a 22 ohm resistor and the gauge should read 1/2.
Substitute a 47 ohm resistor and the gauge should read in the "R"
zone.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Fuel gauge sender unit test. Make sure that the
gauge and the vibrator is working. And the connecting wires and
grounds are in good working order! The brown/black wire that is on
the vibrator at "TP 2", fig 1-3, can be "ohm'd out". Remove the
brown/black lead, put an ohmmeter from ground to the brown/black
wire. You should measure about 10-70 ohms depending on how much gas
is in the tank. You can also check with a voltmeter, re-connect the
brown/black to the vibrator and turn on the key, and check for
pulsating voltage here. Best to do that right at the sender
terminals as that will "prove" the wire from the front of the bus
is good.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Make sure the ground from the chassis to the
sender is in good working order. Turn the key off, re-attach the
"+" wire to ignition coil. Put the dash back to normal.<br></font>
