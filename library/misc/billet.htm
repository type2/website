<h3>Billet Aluminum Parts</h3>
<p>by George Lyle</p>
<hr size="2">
<p><font size="+1">A billet is a simply a bar of metal. "Billet"
parts are supposedly machined directly from the bar, without
intermediate casting, forging, etc.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">This method of making parts is more wasteful of
material and produces weaker parts than other methods. Lots of
stress risers and cuts across the grain of the metal.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">So why are billet parts so desirable? In racing,
many custom (one-only) parts are made from billet (the quickest way
to make them) so many of the "trick" parts on a race car were
"billet". Folks soon learned to associate "billet" with "trick" and
the idea spread.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Many so-called "billet" parts really aren't made
from billets. They are made from castings and have all exposed
surfaces machined to look like a billet part. There's really no
difference in quality or strength when this is done, despite what
the advertisers in VW Babewatch will have you think.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">All in all, the stock parts are probably
stronger!<br></font></p>
