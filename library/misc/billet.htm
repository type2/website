<h3>Billet Aluminum Parts

A billet is a simply a bar of metal.  "Billet" parts are supposedly



machined directly from the bar, without intermediate casting, forging,



etc.



</p><p>



This method of making parts is more wasteful of material and produces



weaker parts than other methods.  Lots of stress risers and cuts across



the grain of the metal.



</p><p>



So why are billet parts so desirable?  In racing, many custom (one-only)



parts are made from billet (the quickest way to make them) so many of



the "trick" parts on a race car were "billet".  Folks soon learned to



associate "billet" with "trick" and the idea spread.



</p><p>



Many so-called "billet" parts really aren't made from billets.  They are



made from castings and have all exposed surfaces machined to look like a



billet part.  There's really no difference in quality or strength when



this is done, despite what the advertisers in VW Babewatch will have you



think. 



</p><p>



All in all, the stock parts are probably stronger!
