<h3>Speedometer Reading Correction</h3>
<p>by George Lyle</p>
<hr size="2">
<pre><font size="+1">
&gt; A while ago there was a thread about speedometers and wheel sizes.
&gt; question 1, what is the correction factor that I should apply with
&gt; 135*15 front wheels?
</font></pre>
<p><font size="+1">One could calculate a correction factor, but it
probably wouldn't be correct. Like all instruments, speedometers
tend to lose accuracy with age. They generally start out reading a
bit more than the actual speed (no manufacturer wants to be sued
for speeding tickets) and _usually_ tend to read even higher with
age.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">A good speedo shop can recalibrate your
speedometer for your "way kewl dood" tire size, but some find it
more fun to do the corrections in their heads and impress their
passengers.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Get a stopwatch and find a long straight road
with mile markers (most states mark each road every mile either
with clear mile markers or with some sort of cryptic monument. Get
the bus up to an indicated 60MPH and measure the time it takes to
go one mile (by the mile markers) with the stop watch. It will
probably take a bit more than a minute. For every second past 60,
subtract 1MPH from your indicated speed. If it took you 64 seconds
to go a mile, you were going 60-(64-60)=56MPH. (Yes, I know this
isn't exact, but it works fine for minor corrections).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">From this you can figure corrections for other
speeds. Since you're off by 4 MPH at 60, you can figure on 30MPH
being actually 28, 15 being actually 14, and, of course, 90MPH
being actually 84MPH :<?  The
relationship isn't exactly linear, but these numbers should be good
enough.

&gt; Question 2, what is the RPM/mph that I amdoing with 165*15's on the
&gt; back and a standard 63 transmission?
</font></pre>
<p><font size="+1">Two ways to figure this out. You can figure the
RPM of the wheels using their rolling circumference and the road
speed, then multiply by the reduction box ratio, multiply by the
ring and pinion ratio, multiply by the 4th gear ratio, and you have
your engine RPM.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The other way is to hook up a tune-up tachometer
to the engine, run the wire out through the engine lid and in
through the hatch, drive 60MPH and have someone read the
RPM.</font></p>
