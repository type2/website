<p><font size="+1">Bob Wallace responded:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Seems to me there are three types of towing and
two types of vehicle.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Types of towing: rope/chain, wheel-lift, or flat
bed</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Types of vehicle: auto or manual</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">For a short (100 yards) a rope tow is OK for
auto or manual above that manual only or remove the drive shafts in
an auto. Also needs a driver in the towed vehicle. Should ever
cause damage to bumper or tie-rods etc - use the eye: welded to the
chassis instead (I've used that eye and a two rope to pull a car
out of a ditch)</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Like wise a wheel-lift tow truck is NOT SUITABLE
for an auto without removing the drive shafts. If you have a
steering lock make sure its on to hold your front wheels in the
right place otherwise you will need to tie the wheel in
place.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">If you have an auto and you don't want to remove
the drive shafts then make sure you tell the tow company you have
an auto so must have a flat bed.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">How long has the bus sat? What about brakes,
lights, wheel bearings? Better bring lots of parts, registration,
insurance, and tickets to the New Mexico State Police fundraising
raffle. Would you buy the engine in Texas, get it shipped there, or
bring it with you. Where would you do the work? Maybe some listers
in Texas?</font></p>
<blockquote><font size="+1"><i>Renting a truck/trailer and towing
it. Could be rather expensive....</i></font></blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">I would like to take this oportunity to pass on
my recent experience of getting Poni, my 23 window project from
Mississippi.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">1 - <b>TRUCKS:</b> If you can borrow a tow
vehicle, you will save big bucks. Absolutely the only vehicle I was
able to rent to tow with was a 15' U-Haul or Ryder truck. They
won't let you tow with the 10' truck or any pickups they rent. I
found no truck dealers or other truck rental places (ie Pensky,
Thrifty) that would rent any truck for towing purposes. Can you
spell "insurance liabilty"? The 15' truck from U-Haul are around 40
cents a mile (that's $800 for you) PLUS day rate for LOCAL rental,
and you still need a trailer. On a trip of 1000 miles, a one way
rental will be slightly less, which will pay for a bus or plane
ticket to Texas.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">2 - <b>TRAILERS:</b> Okay you still need a
trailer. (I though about rolling a bus INTO a 15' box truck, but
there is no way to secure it, and guess what, you will break the
rental agreement if you try this.) U-Haul will rent you an auto
transport alone. Ryder will only rent you a trailer if you rent a
truck (15' or larger). Here is the trailer low down:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">2A - <b>U-Haul Auto Transport</b>: 2-axles;
about $250 one way for 1000 miles (less if you rent a truck too);
2100 pound trailer weight; requires a class 3 hitch; 3600 pound
payload capacity (no problem for any bus I know). I decide to go:
this route, to eliminate the potential pitfalls of the other
trailer options below. WARNING: This trailer holds the towed
vehicle in only ONE position front to back on the trailer, that is,
all the way to the front of the trailer. This means the smaller the
vehicle, the more weight is proportionally to the front of the
trailer. There is no means to reposition the load, and hence adjust
the resulting the tongue weight.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">After I loaded my bus in Mississippi, I was
worried about the tongue weight on the trailer. The rear suspension
on the towing vehicle (a borrowed Jeep Grand Cherokee, 6cyl, 4WD)
was almost bottomed out. I called U-haul to see if there was a
different way to to hook the bus on the trailer. They were NO help
at all. We (my buddy and I) tried to figure out the wieght by doing
a structural beam analysis (we are both architects) on the loading.
U-haul could not even tell me the unloaded tongue weight of the
trailer empty. So we were traveling along, totally getting stressed
out about this tongue weight thing and feeling every bump. We made
it to a Citgo truck stop type of place on the highway out of
Gulfport. After we were done we were pulling out and noticed the
CAT scales. Heck, we might as well give it a try. So I explained
our situation to the scale keeper. It was a slow night, so they
said go for it.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">We pulled the trailer up to the scales with the
axles just off the end on the pavement. We unhooked the trailer and
ended up using the big chunk of pitch pine root to support the
tongue on the scale so we could get an accurate tongue weight.
Anyway the tongue weight turned out to be 620 pounds. The jeep and
hitch were rated at 750, so we moved on very happy and relieved.
Man, I hate stress. Once again, I was towing a 1963, sans-engine,
deluxe which has a weight of about 2000 pounds (by the book, not
actually weighed). Of course, a breadloaf will probably be
more.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">2B - <b>U-Haul Tow Dolly</b>: 1-axle, gets two
of the towed vehicles wheels of the: ground, requires the rear
wheels of the towed vehicle to roll along (good bearings, tires,
etc..), 750 pound trailer weight, I don't know the capacity or cost
which I assume would be less than the auto transport.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">2C - <b>U-Haul 6'x12' Open Top Trailer</b>:
2-axles, 1500 pound trailer weight, a splitty with no bumpers is
13'-6" long which would seem to fit hanging out, BUT the tailgate
is only 5'-6" wide, too narrow (barely) for a bus.</font></p>
<blockquote><font size="+1"><i>Having it 'professionally' shipped
here by one of those companies that ship cars.....could be more
expensive...</i></font></blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">3 - <b>AUTO TRANSPORT SERVICE</b>: My guess at
the cost is about $750 for your 1000 miles, although there does
seem to be a lot of east-west transport traffic through the
southwest, so it might be less. Every time I talk to these guys, I
don't get good feelings. They like it much better when the vehicle
is running so they can drive it on the truck. I get worried
thinking about a bus I have never seen, being transpported by some
dudes I have never meet, who knows what will happen. I wanted to
see my bus before I made the deal (in cash), so this didn't work
out for me as an option. The services that specialize in antique
transport and will tow it on a tralier by itself directly door to
door cost BIG BUCKS, more proportional in cost to a Porshe 356
Spyder or such.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">4 - <b>TOW BAR</b>: Getting a tow bar for the
bus might be a really cheap option, but bring or get some tires. I
will leave this option to others with experience on which to
comment.</font></p>

long distance towing. Across town to a repair or paint facility
would be OK though. If yer gonna do it long distance, I really
recommend a flat bed trailer IMHO.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I've used a BUS-SIZED tow bar since 1991 and it
has worked very well. Every bus Jeff or I have owned except the
Barn-doors has been towed by this towbar. Longest tow = 1200
miles.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">It is a home-shop made towbar made out of 4"
L-chanel and two pieces of 4x2" box section that have slots that
surround the lower tube of the front beam. It extends down to clear
the bumper and front valence, and forward about 4 feet to an
adjustable ball hitch (so it will fit ANY sized ball, including
those wierd metric sizes on Westfalia hitches).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Drawbacks: there are a few. The towbar weighs a
ton, between the size and weight, is a chore for one person to
handle it, though I have manhandled it many times. The size? It
takes up most of the room in a short bed, full size American
pickup. You have to remove the steering dampener to attach it, and
the heigth of the 4" channel restricts its use on lowered buses (it
tends to pull up reflectors when used on a lowered bus). It also
scratches the paint of the front beam.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">If I were to make one now, I would use 3"
L-chanel, and make it a foot longer.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">When we tow, we use a removable set of lights
similar to the type tow-truck drivers use.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Oh, and when towing a bus, you will glance into
the rear view mirror and experience a moment of panic when you see
someone following you that close! I have yet to get past
it.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I bought a bus tow bar from Dr Joe at All Bug
last week, just in time to retrieve the bus I bought...I got the
tow bar and after scraping the usual pile of junk together, I
headed off 75 mile away. I borrowed a Toy 4Runner for the
task.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">It took only a half hour to push the bus out,
hook up the tow bar and run the lights, not bad for a first time
use of this style of tow bar...</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The tow bar hooks up like the bug style in that
it has a "U" that hangs from the lower torsion tube. Actually it's
two angles poking up from the bar, but it forms a U bracket with a
bolt though the top to keep it hanging from the torsion
tube.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">It is sized to clear the anti-sway bar and such.
It would be a close fit to the steering damper, which was
disconnected on my bus. This may explain problems I had
later.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The U hanger is a loose fit to the torsion tube,
so it can slide around under there, sideways. At a stop to check
things I found marks indicating that the U hanger had slid around a
lot. A steering arm could be turned against the U hanger if the bus
turned while the U hanger was at the wrong spot. I tied a short
length of rope around the protruding piece of the steering box (the
one that is at the center of the bus, I don't remember the correct
name) to the arms of the tow bar to keep the bar centered on the
torsion tube. This worked very well.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The tow bar is fairly narrow, so any looseness
between the U hanger and the torsion tube results in the bus
weaving around when braking. I heavily suggest placing a wooden or
plastic shim to tighten up the space, yet still allow the necessary
rotation. A wider U spacing would be better, but the tow bar is
sized to fit loafs also, so probably some compromises were
made.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">[Gary LaVere responded: "The tow bar needs to be
narrow to fit early and late splitties. I made and have used this
style tow bar (made out of 2" cold rolled steel) at my shop on a
daily basis for many years. I have found that this wandering
side-to-side is the result of tires not being filled to the proper
pressure. Fill up your tires and try it again and the odds are that
the problem will have disappeared. As far as I know from experience
of hooking these tow bars up to early and late buses, there is no
difference between the beams as far as fit is
concerned."]</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The bus seemed to bounce back and forth during
the trip during braking above 40 mph. The lack of a steering damper
could have been the main culprit here, just don't know. It coulda
slowed down the wandering. I got up to 55, got a little weird, so I
kept the max to 50, usually around 45.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Other than the above, things worked real well. I
have a pair of rear lights from a '64 I have mounted to an aluminum
bar, already wired up to serve as trailer lights, so in case any
one cares, the lights were the same period as the bus!</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The length of the tow bar made parking lot
travel very easy, with no danger of pinching the bus and tow
vehicle.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Good sturdy tow bar. If you want one for
yourself: Call All Bug, Dr. Joe, $185 delivered, 602-997-7345 [July
2, 1998] No web site yet. Took less than a week for
delivery.</font></p>

<blockquote><font size="+1"><i>Tow with the rear wheels on the
dolly, ignore the manuals, ignore the morons at the rental place.
You want the drive wheels off the ground so you don't rotate the
transmission and internals. Cheaper to fix front bearings than
transmissions. Unless you remove the CV's and axles, then it's ok.
Open the driver's window, and securely lash the steering wheel the
closest approximation to straight. This'll keep the front end from
wandering around.</i></font></blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Joe Clark responded:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Makes sense, though I've also heard that towing
front-ways does no damage. It shouldn't, since the parts that move
will (normally) receive their normal loads and lubrication despite
the engine being off. I've towed a Ghia 1000 miles with no
noticeable damage (sorta hard to remove the CVs on swingaxles :-).
But since I have no idea of the condition of the
tranny/CVs/bearings on this one (it's pushable), your advice is
worth considering. I can pretty quickly R&amp;R the front bearings
beforehand if indicated.</font></p>
<blockquote><font size="+1"><i>Nota bene: One should also make sure
the poptop is secure when towing backwards, especially on 68-72
models. Inverse for later. Else potential sudden air scoop, albeit
briefly. Make sure the towing vehicle weighs at least as much as
the bus. The rental places WILL ask this question, be ready with an
answer.</i></font></blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Excellent point.</font></p>
<blockquote><font size="+1"><i>Keep your butt peeled, as opposed to
your eyes. If you feel the tow vehicle start to wander side to
side, you are about to fishtail bigtime. DON'T hit the brakes, just
slow down, and keep the speed below the fishtail
speed.</i></font></blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Also good advice. I've always felt that the
derriere is an excellent sense organ for extreme
driving.</font></p>
<blockquote><font size="+1"><i>Most trailers use the ball as the
ground wire for the electrical stuff. Truly pathetic, if you are to
run at night, run a separate ground wire from dolly to the tow
vehicle chassis.</i></font></blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Also a good point, but I plan to tow during the
day.</font></p>
<blockquote><font size="+1"><i>Getting the vehicle ONTO the dolly
is the toughest part.</i></font></blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Amen! I plan to use a come-along.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I'll add for those who down't know: you cannot
back up (more than a very few straight feet) with a 2-wheel
dolly.</font></p>

<blockquote><font size="+1"><i>The key is to tie the steering wheel
really tight to prevent the steering from flopping around. The

part of the problem.</i></font></blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Dave Easterwood responded:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I would imagine that another part of the problem
is by towing the bus backward, you don't get the benefit of the
toe-in of the front end alignment.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">If you have ever driven a vehicle with the front
end out of adjustment so that the distance between the forward edge
of the rims is greater than the distance between the rear edge of
the rims you know what I mean.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The toe-in keeps the vehicle from wandering all
over the road. Many moons ago I had to have my '66 Westy towed &
the driver insisted on towing it backward. Well, it went fishing on
him & he nearly lost it. Now I only tow with a towbar and all 4
wheels on the ground or a trailer with all 4 wheels off the
ground.</font></p>

remember)<br></font></p>
