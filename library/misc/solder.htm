<h3>Soldering</h3>
<p>by George Lyle</p>
<hr size="2">
<p><font size="+1">The reason that I solder all connections is that
it is impossible to produce high quality crimp connections with
commonly available tools and hardware. If you compare the
factory-made crimp connections with the common "crimping pliers"
connections you will see that the factory connections are much
better tighter. When disassembled, the wire inside factory
connections is usually bright and shiny, just as it went together
30 years ago! Insulated crimp-on connectors are really horrible,
and shouldn't be used at all. I won't even mention Scotchlok
connectors except to say that they should be properly labeled as
"corrosion promotion devices."</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I use the commonly available _uninsulated_
crimp-on connectors, but then flow solder into the crimped region
to complete the job. I then use two pieces of heat shrink tubing
(one over the crimp, one over the entire connector) to strenthen
the joint and prevent flexing.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Use a good soldering gun, the little soldering
pencils are good for electronics work, but you need more heat for
automotive wiring. Weller makes a good dual-heat 140/100W gun. For
shrinking the tubing, I use an electric paint-stripping heat gun,
which is quite a bit cheaper than the electonic heat guns. Kester
makes good solder (and there is quite a bit of difference in ease
of application here!)</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Most bad solder connections are due to too
little heat. To properly solder a connection, you should apply heat
to the connector until the _connector_ is hot enough to melt
solder. You may apply a bit of solder to the tip to aid heat
transfer to the connector, but you should never apply solder to the
tip while it is touching the connector. Melt solder into the
crimped joint until you see solder flow out the opposite side. Hold
the joint stationary while the solder solidifies. The result is a
nice shiny solder fillet.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">If solder refuses to flow, the joint is probably
contaminated with oil or corrosion. I've found that spray carb
cleaner is effective in getting rid of oil, but make sure that you
air out the wire before soldering.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Don't work too hard to save a contaminated
connecion. Simply cut it back a few inches and splice in a new
section of wire of the same type. I have a couple of old wiring
harnesses that I rob wire from so as to keep color codes
intact.</font></p>
