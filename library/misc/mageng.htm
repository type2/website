From the ASM Metals Handbook, V.2, 10th edition, 1990

Room Temperature properties (Al=Aluminum, Mn=Magnesium, Si=Silicon):

<B>AS21:</B>
<UL>
<LI>                1.7% Al
<LI>                .4% Mn
<LI>                1.1% Si
<LI>                240 MPa Tensile Strength
<LI>                130 MPa Tensile Yield Strength
<LI>                130 MPa Compressive Yield Strength
</UL>
<P>
<B>AS41A</B>
<UL>
<LI>           4.3% Al
<LI>           .35% Mn
<LI>           1.0% Si
<LI>           220 MPa Tensile Strength
<LI>           150 MPa Tensile Yield Strength
<LI>           150 MPa Compressive Yield Strength
</UL>
<P>
"AS41A has creep strength much superior to that of AZ91D or AM60B alloys at 
temperatures up to 175C (350F)... AS21 alloy exhibits even better creep strength 
than AS41A.  However, AS21 has lower room-temperature tensile and yield strengths, 
and it is somewhat more difficult to cast."
<P>
The newer cases are made of AS41A which is better than the original AS41 
material and even the AS21 which was used for awhile.
