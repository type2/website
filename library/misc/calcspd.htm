<h3>Calculating speed from RPM</h3>

<p><font size="+1">Calculating rpm and speed</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Question:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I'm interested in calculating how fast my engine
will rev in every gear, for a given speed, with different tires. Is
there a formula relating tire size, engine speed and road
speed?</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Answer:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">the relationship between engine speed (rpm) and
road speed (mph) is determined by the characteristics of the
drivetrain, from the crankshaft to the tire contact patch. to
calculate road speed for a given engine, you will need to know the
gear ratio(s) and the final drive ratio, or the overall ratio, and
the rolling circumference of the tires connected to the speedometer
(usually the driven tires).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">the rolling circumference will be the most
difficult to determine; gear ratios can be found in your owner's
manual or R&amp;T data panel. to find the rolling circumference
directly by measurement, put a chalk mark on the tire and the
ground so that they line up. with the car loaded normally (say,
half a tank of fuel and the driver aboard), roll the car for
exactly 10 revolutions of the tire to average things out a bit.
mark the ground again, lining up the chalk mark on the tire. use a
steel tape measure to find the distance covered.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">alternatively, you can look up the circumference
in the table below, which lists some of the more popular tire
sizes. this table was compiled from tire-industry standards for the
rolling circumference of new tires at 50 km/h (31 mph); the rolling
circumference will vary from brand to brand, with speed, load,
inflation pressure and wear. even radials exhibit "growth" at high
speeds. error limits for the numbers in this table are +1.5 percent
and -2.5 percent.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">as a last resort, you can estimate the rolling
circumference from the tire-size designation. for example, a
195/60R-15 tire will have a section height of 60 percent of 195mm,
or 117mm; in English units, 4.61 inches. add to this one-half of
the 15-in. wheel diameter, and you get 12.11 in. multiply by 2pi
gets the circumference using inch units; then dividing by 12 gets
you to the circumference in feet.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">the formula relating road speed and engine rpm
is</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">mph = (rpm * cir) / (gear * final *
88)</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">where rpm = engine rpm<br>
cir = tire cicumference, in feet<br>
gear = gear ratio of your car<br>
final = final drive ratio of your car<br>
88 = combines several conversion factors<br></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">for example, the audi 90 quattro (R&amp;T,
december 1987). its tires are 195/60VR-14,so our calculated
circumference works out to be 72.92 inches or 6.08 feet. its final
drive is 4.11:1, its 5th gear is 0.79:1, so their product is 3.25
and the rest is a quick calculation away:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">mph = (rpm * 6.08) / (3.25 * 88) = 0.0213
rpm</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">so, for instance, the audi will do 21.3 mph for
every 1000 rpm in 5th gear.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">to work the equation the other way, to find
engine rpm for a given road speed, you want to solve for
rpm:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">rpm = (mph * gear * final * 88) /
circumference</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">at 60 mph, for instance, this has our audi
revving a calculated 2822 rpm, within a few percent of our
road-test computer's 2750 rpm.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">when i did mine, i did the 10x rolling tire
chalk mark method, in a mall parking lot. my 195/??R14 tires came
out to 6.30 feet circumference, and the bentley book provided the
gear ratios:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">reverse 3.67<br>
1st 3.78<br>
2nd 2.06<br>
3rd 1.23<br>
4th 0.83<br>
final 4.86<br>
