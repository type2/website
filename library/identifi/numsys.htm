<h3>The VW Part Numbering System</h3>
<p>by Jim Adney</p>
<hr size="2">
<p><font size="+1">The VW part numbering system is extremely
logical and was designed to help make it easy to assign new part
numbers as well as remember old ones. Each part number consists of
nine digits divided into three groups of three. You may find it
helpful to think of them in the following way:
TCS-MSS-###.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>T</b> stands for the Type of car that the
part was first designed for, so it would be a 1 for a Beetle, 2 for
a Bus, or a 3 for a Type III.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>C</b> stands for Chassis, so for a squareback
this would be a 6, while notches and fastys got a 1 here, and Type
3 Ghias got a 4. If the part was the same on all the type IIIs this
digit is a 1.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>S</b> stands for Side, odd numbers were for
the left side, even on the right. If there was no handedness
involved S = 1.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">So, if you look through the Type III parts lists
you will find that there are more parts that start with 311 than
any other number.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The second group of three digits describes the
portion or logical division of the car that the part was used on.
All the VW chassis types used the same divisions.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>M</b> stands for Main group number. All the
parts of a car are divided into 10 Main groups numbered from 1 to
0. The 10 main groups are described in the list at the bottom of
this page.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>SS</b> stands for Subgroup number. This
leaves the possibility of dividing each Main group into as many as
100 Subgroups although most main groups had many fewer than that.
The subgroups for each main group are also shown in the list at the
bottom of this page. Note that subgroup 98 was always for repair
kits for that main group.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The last three digits were just assigned in
sequence from 001 on up. Where possible, these numbers were kept
unique to a certain kind of part. Thus a 113-105-271 is a beetle
flywheel, 211-105-271 is a bus flywheel, and a 311-105-271 is a
type III flywheel.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">As a final addition, most part numbers will have
some letters at the end. These signify variations over time. The
first part will have no suffix, the next will have an "A", then B,
C,... Z, AA, AB,.... There are also color and size code suffixes
that are needed for some parts, but I'm not going to get into that
here. Sometimes a later suffix will superceed an earlier one, but
this is not generally true; you need the parts list to tell for
sure.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">As a guide to understanding the part numbers I
have put together a listing of the main and sub-group numbers as
used on the Type IIIs.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">It is useful to know that when these parts are
sorted in a listing at a dealer or parts house, they will be sorted
first by MSS, then by ###, and finally by TCS. This may seem a bit
awkward, but once you see it and understand what it does, it will
seem natural.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">This list includes the main group, each
subgroup, and the parts list illustration numbers(s) that apply to
them.</font></p>
