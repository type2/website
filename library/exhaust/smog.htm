<h3>Passing Emissions Test (for High Mileage Type I Engine)</h3>
<p>by Fred Stoermer</p>
<hr size="2">
<p><font size="+1">A common emission test problem for upright fan
[type 1] engines with a few miles on them is caused by
blowby/crankcase fumes being re-ingested through the air cleaner
and carburetor and throwing the tailpipe readings way
off.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">There's a simple fix.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Using a longer piece of hose than is already
there reroute the crankcase fumes out of the compartment via a
"road draft tube". Standard fitment/procedure for most older
vehicles. Just remove the preheated air hose from the air cleaner,
temporarily, and route the road draft tube under the engine tin
through that opening. After the test replace the hoses in the
appropriate arrangement.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">This procedure was suggested to me a few years
back by a state-certified emission test/control technician, and it
worked like a charm.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Whatever approach you take it's imperative that
you get all the machinery thoroughly warmed up pre-test. Our local
state testing station checks this pre-test, and will send folks
back to the freeway if necessary to avoid wasting everyone's time
and money.<br></font></p>
