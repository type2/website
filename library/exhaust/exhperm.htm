<h3>'72-'79 (type IV engine) Bus Exhaust Permutations</h3>
<p>by Ron Salmon</p>
<hr size="2">
<blockquote><font size="+1"><i>"It looks like the [Federal] "49
states" 1979 exhaust could be adapted to 75-78 vehicles, using
72-74 heat exchangers -- either straight, or with a modification in
the crossover tube. But I have never seen one of these. Are they,
uhm, less than abundant?"</i></font>
<p><font size="+1"><i>...I think the exhaust ports for the '79
HE/heads are more square than the earlier ports, if I remember
right, so they have to match as a set. I could be
mistaken.</i></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><i>I put '72 heat exchangers and exhaust on my
'77 FI engine...the later exhaust is very expensive and difficult
to find parts for.</i></font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">In "real world" use, the shape of the exhaust
ports on '72-79 heads is close enough that any heat exchanger can
be made to work with any head, provided that you use the
appropriate copper gaskets to permit a tight seal. Basically, the
difference in shape is small enough that with some fiddling, you
will find that the copper gaskets will fill in the difference and
create a tight seal regardless of what heads and heat exchangers
you are mating. This gives you a lot of flexibility concerning
exhaust options.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">'72-74 heat exchangers and '79 heat exchangers
are identical in the way that they hook up to both the heads and
the exhaust. That is, both have trapezoidal outputs to the exhaust.
What this means to you is that if you have a '79 bus that needs
heat exchangers, you can get away with buying the less-expensive
'72-74 heat exchangers, and still use your original exhaust. (These
heat exchangers run about $80-100 less than the true '79 ones.) Or
conversely, a '72-74 exhaust system is a direct bolt-on onto '79-83
heat exchangers. (More on this below.)</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">'75-78 heat exchangers have a triangular output
flange, and require a whole network of no-longer-available piping
to go to the heads (as opposed to the '72-74 heat exchangers, which
are fully self-contained). Furthermore, an original quality (stock)
exhaust system is no longer available for the '75-78 heat
exchangers, leaving you with the $79 Pacesetter system as your best
option for these years, if you want to use your stock heat
exchangers. The Pacesetter is better than almost any other
aftermarket exhaust system I know of, but certainly not comparable
in quality to a stock system.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Therefore, there is little reason, in my
opinion, to stick with the '75-78 heat exchangers. They require
ancilliary parts that can't be found new, and limit you to
aftermarket exhaust systems. Better to put '72-74 heat exchangers
on your '75-78. This will eliminate those unavailable u-pipes, and
allow you to install either a catalyst or non-catalyst stock
exhaust system, which is likely to outlast the aftermarket systems
by a sizeable margin. In fact, in most of the rest of the world,
this is what VW did; these triangular port '75-78 jobs are pretty
much a U.S. only setup from what I've seen. I'm not suggesting that
anyone run out and buy '72-74 heat exhangers and exhaust if your
present '75-78 system is just fine, but the changeover is worth
considering if you are in need of heat exchangers and/or exhaust
anyway.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">If you want '72-74 heat exchangers, I do have a
small quantity of genuine N.O.S. German Volkswagen right side heat
exchangers for $149.95, which is an absolute bargain for these
extremely heavy duty units that have long been unavailable. You
would have to buy a Danish left side for $189.95, but even one
German side will give you better heat than if you had put Danish on
both sides.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">For exhaust systems that will mate up to the
'72-74 (or '79-83) heat exchangers, your best option (albeit
without provision for a cat or egr valve) is the stock '72-74
system, which was actually used in Europe thru '83. This is a heavy
duty system, and very simple in design. Basically a big muffler
that connects right to the heat exchangers, with a tailpipe on one
end. Normally I sell a Danish made system for $159.95. However, on
the list of bargains that I will be posting within a day,
consisting of the parts I just received from Europe, you will find
a similar system including a Stainless Steel German muffler for
only $30 or $40 more. This was a closeout deal I found in Germany
and is well worth grabbing, as mufflers of this quality have not
been imported to the U.S. before at any price. Your second option,
should you require a catalytic converter and egr valve port, is a
stock '79-83 49-state setup, complete with crossover pipe, etc.
This system runs $299.95, plus $99.95 additional for the cat. Since
cat's were legally required from '79 on (and from '76 on in
California), that would be the main reason for buying this setup,
as it offers no performance or reliability advantage over the
'72-74 setup and costs twice as much.</font></p>
