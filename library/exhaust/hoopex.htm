<h3>Type I Engine Exhaust Leak: Muffler Flange Installation</h3>
<p>by Ken Hooper</p>
<hr size="2">
<p><font size="+1">Thus spake Hoover:</font></p>
<blockquote><font size="+1"><i>"I prefer to use welded, flanged
fittings between my heat exchangers and the
muffler..."</i></font></blockquote>
<p><img src="../images/mufflan3.jpg" alt="2 bolt flange"></p>
<p><font size="+1">And in the If I Can Do This Then Any Other Idiot
Can Too department, put the flanges on when you put the muffler on.
This eliminates the hackneyed little ring clamps and their tendency
to leak loudly and shoot carbon monoxide into your heating
system.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>==Interregnum One:</b> This involves welding.
Don't get scared. I did it with a tiny little oxy-MAPP torch that
costs like $35 at Home Depot, although I went through an alarming
number of $7 disposable oxygen cartridges before the job was
through. When I asked about this little torch on the list a lot of
knowledgable people said "don't bother with that", and nobody said
"DO bother with that", so of course I had to go and buy
one.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>==</b>Although supplies for it are expensive
I do not regret buying it. This thing is capable of field repairs
if they don't require more than 10 minutes or so of welding,
especially if you pre-heat with a straight propane torch before you
start. A portable welder that's not much bigger than a shoe box is,
I think, a good thing to carry with you, particularly if you find
you have lost your lighter and have nothing to light cigarettes
with. One must be well-prepared when camping.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>==</b>A cheap real gas torch goes for $150 at
your local welding supply and uses the cheap returnable oxygen
bottles. You know you want one and think how much cheaper it is
than a MIG.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The flanges cost $6 from Kymco. Comes with
gaskets, bolts and copper nuts (I do hope they weren't merely
copper plated but I didn't check). They work like the flanges on
the exhausts of all other cars. If you don't know what I'm talking
about, go crawl under the nearest Toyota and look where the exhaust
pipes bolt to the catalytic convertor. The cat is the big bulgy
thing covered with steel braid about halfway back. Like
that.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">One of the flanges butts up against the flared
part on the front of the muffler and the tube from the heater box
goes through the other flange and on into the flare. There isn't
any cutting involved. These things do not fit tight, not even
close, you can't braze them on because there's a lot of space to
fill.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">To install, I went ahead and pulled the engine
so I could see what I was doing. I didn't want to do my first
welding upside-down on my back. But I'm sure you could install them
with the engine in by taking off the old muffler, supporting the
engine, and removing the rear engine support. Either way, you'll
have to bolt the whole exhaust together before you weld so
everything fits together.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>==Interregnum Two:</b> DO NOT USE the gaskets
that come with the flanges. These are made of white stuff that
seems remarkably like paper but is not. Instead, get some sheet
asbestos and cut your own gaskets using the ones supplied as a
pattern. The reason is, if you weld the thing up with the supplied
gaskets in place you can't take the muffler off again (to install
the engine support or for any other reason later on) because the
gasket will come off in pieces. You cannot use the "tin sandwich"
exhaust gaskets you use at the manifolds here because they aren't
big enough to fit over the heater tube, so you'll be stuck with no
gaskets at all. NAPA can get the sheet asbestos. Ask me how I know
this. ;/</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Having bolted the exhaust system on (with the
flanges and their gaskets bolted together and hanging loose on the
heater tubes) I butted the flanges against the flared part of the
muffler, "blocked" it in place with vise-grips, and welded away. Be
careful of accidentally welding the nuts &amp; bolts to the
flanges, there's not much room between them and you want to be able
to take the thing off again someday.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">This took me a long time and my greenhorn
amateur welds had a lot of warts, but eventually it was all
together. Let cool, unbolt exhaust, install engine support,
re-install WITH COPIOUS ANTI-SEIZE, run and check for leaks. Not
tough. Excellent, useful, safe, low-cost mod.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>==Interregnum Three:</b> If you have on of
those patios made of cement with the little brown pebbles in it?
And you are welding close to the ground? It makes the pebbles
explode and shoot shrapnel at your eyes. Ask me how I know this.

<p><font size="+1">Ron's note: I used Bugpack brand 1-3/8" flange
kit for both the muffler and heat exchanger. Not all BugPack
products work as advertised, but at these flanges get my seal of
approval. <a href="http://www.geneberg.com/">Gene Berg</a> sells a
few different kits that complement various extractor/muffler
combinations. The local muffler shops I visited didn't have such
small (1-3/8") flanges in stock, so buy them in advance before
getting torch happy.</font></p>
