  <h3>Type I Engine Exhaust Leak: Muffler Flange Installation</h3>

  <p>by Ken Hooper</p>

  <p><font size="+1">Thus spake Hoover:</font></p>

  <blockquote>
    <font size="+1"><i>"I prefer to use welded, flanged fittings between my
    heat exchangers and the muffler..."</i></font>
  </blockquote>

  <p><font size="+1">And in the If I Can Do This Then Any Other Idiot Can Too
  department, put the flanges on when you put the muffler on. This eliminates
  the hackneyed little ring clamps and their tendency to leak loudly and
  shoot carbon monoxide into your heating system.</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1"><b>==Interregnum One:</b> This involves welding. Don't
  get scared. I did it with a tiny little oxy-MAPP torch that costs like $35
  at Home Depot, although I went through an alarming number of $7 disposable
  oxygen cartridges before the job was through. When I asked about this
  little torch on the list a lot of knowledgable people said "don't bother
  with that", and nobody said "DO bother with that", so of course I had to go
  and buy one.</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1"><b>==</b>Although supplies for it are expensive I do not
  regret buying it. This thing is capable of field repairs if they don't
  require more than 10 minutes or so of welding, especially if you pre-heat
  with a straight propane torch before you start. A portable welder that's
  not much bigger than a shoe box is, I think, a good thing to carry with
  you, particularly if you find you have lost your lighter and have nothing
  to light cigarettes with. One must be well-prepared when
  camping.</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1"><b>==</b>A cheap real gas torch goes for $150 at your
  local welding supply and uses the cheap returnable oxygen bottles. You know
  you want one and think how much cheaper it is than a MIG.</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1">The flanges cost $6 from Kymco. Comes with gaskets,
  bolts and copper nuts (I do hope they weren't merely copper plated but I
  didn't check). They work like the flanges on the exhausts of all other
  cars. If you don't know what I'm talking about, go crawl under the nearest
  Toyota and look where the exhaust pipes bolt to the catalytic convertor.
  The cat is the big bulgy thing covered with steel braid about halfway back.
  Like that.</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1">One of the flanges butts up against the flared part on
  the front of the muffler and the tube from the heater box goes through the
  other flange and on into the flare. There isn't any cutting involved. These
  things do not fit tight, not even close, you can't braze them on because
  there's a lot of space to fill.</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1">To install, I went ahead and pulled the engine so I
  could see what I was doing. I didn't want to do my first welding
  upside-down on my back. But I'm sure you could install them with the engine
  in by taking off the old muffler, supporting the engine, and removing the
  rear engine support. Either way, you'll have to bolt the whole exhaust
  together before you weld so everything fits together.</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1"><b>==Interregnum Two:</b> DO NOT USE the gaskets that
  come with the flanges. These are made of white stuff that seems remarkably
  like paper but is not. Instead, get some sheet asbestos and cut your own
  gaskets using the ones supplied as a pattern. The reason is, if you weld
  the thing up with the supplied gaskets in place you can't take the muffler
  off again (to install the engine support or for any other reason later on)
  because the gasket will come off in pieces. You cannot use the "tin
  sandwich" exhaust gaskets you use at the manifolds here because they aren't
  big enough to fit over the heater tube, so you'll be stuck with no gaskets
  at all. NAPA can get the sheet asbestos. Ask me how I know this.
  ;/</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1">Having bolted the exhaust system on (with the flanges
  and their gaskets bolted together and hanging loose on the heater tubes) I
  butted the flanges against the flared part of the muffler, "blocked" it in
  place with vise-grips, and welded away. Be careful of accidentally welding
  the nuts &amp; bolts to the flanges, there's not much room between them and
  you want to be able to take the thing off again someday.</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1">This took me a long time and my greenhorn amateur welds
  had a lot of warts, but eventually it was all together. Let cool, unbolt
  exhaust, install engine support, re-install WITH COPIOUS ANTI-SEIZE, run
  and check for leaks. Not tough. Excellent, useful, safe, low-cost
  mod.</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1"><b>==Interregnum Three:</b> If you have on of those
  patios made of cement with the little brown pebbles in it? And you are
  welding close to the ground? It makes the pebbles explode and shoot
  shrapnel at your eyes. Ask me how I know this. ;/</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1">Ron's note: I used Bugpack brand 1-3/8" flange kit for
  both the muffler and heat exchanger. Not all BugPack products work as
  advertised, but at these flanges get my seal of approval. <a href=
  "http://www.geneberg.com/">Gene Berg</a> sells a few different kits that
  complement various extractor/muffler combinations. The local muffler shops
  I visited didn't have such small (1-3/8") flanges in stock, so buy them in
  advance before getting torch happy.</font></p>
