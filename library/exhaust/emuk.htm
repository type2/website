<h3>Emissions Testing in the UK</h3>
<p>by Bob Wallace</p>
<hr size="2">
<blockquote><font size="+1"><i>"I can find many sources quoting
upper limits as far as the passing of various Govt. tests is
concerned and indeed methods of attaining those levels but, as we
all know, what's good for the Govt (and probably our own lungs!) is
not necessarily automatically healthy for a VW
engine."</i></font></blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">First, for the benefit of those not here in the
UK, here are the emissions tests which are preformed on all petrol
vehicles (kit cars, amatuer built cars and Wankel rotory engines
are slightly different) each year as a SMALL part of our annual
test for the years covered by most aircooled VW
busses....</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">All tests should be done with the engine
warm.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">All vehicles will be checked for emission of
dense blue smoke. First rev the engine to 2500rpm (or approx half
maximum revs) for 20 seconds then allow it to return to idle and
check for dense smoke from the exhaust. The emission of such smoke
is a reason for failure.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">[Note: if the engine will not run a a reasonable
idling speed, operating at too many rpm it will be failed. But if
the throttle has to be applied to stop the engine from stalling
(idle speed is too low) it won't result in a fail.]</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Cars first used before 1 August 1975: Emissions
not measured</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Cars first used on or after 1 August 1975 but
before 1 August 1983:<br></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Hydrocarbon content of the exhaust gasses must
not exceed 1200 parts per million (0.12%) for a continuous period
of 5 seconds<br>
Carbon Monoxide content of the exhaust gasses must not exceed 6%
for a continuous period of 5 seconds.<br>
No test for Nitrous Oxide</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Cars first used on or after 1 August
1983:<br></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Hydrocarbon content of the exhaust gasses must
not exceed 1200 parts per million (0.12%) for a continuous period
of 5 seconds<br>
Carbon Monoxide content of the exhaust gasses must not exceed 4.5%
for a continuous period of 5 seconds.<br>
No test for Nitrous Oxide</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Now for the relationships between mixture, fuel
ecconomy, and power output:</font></p>
<ul>
<li><font size="+1">The ideal air to fuel ratio for a petrol
internal combustion engine is 14.7 air : 1 fuel.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Maximum power is achieved with a rich mixture:
12.6 air : 1 fuel</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Minimum fuel consumption is achieved with a
lean mixture - 15.4 air : 1 fuel</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">A Rich mixture will increase HC and CO (but
lower NOX) emissions</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">A Lean mixture will reduce HC and CO emissions
but NOX goes up (unless mixture is very lean)</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">A rich mixture will burn cooler than a lean
mixture.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Emissions control began by detuning carb
engines to give a leaner mixture.</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font size="+1">Fuel Injected engines hold the mixture range
between 14.5:1 to 14.7:1 giving below max power, a below max MPG,
but a good compromise between CO, HC and NOX emissions. Aggressive
emissions control passed to the catalytic converter which relies on
this mixture; used outside of this range a catalytic converter can,
in fact, result in worse NOX emissions than with no
Cat!!!!</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">So how do you get good emissions, power, and
economy with a carb engine when any mixture set during tune up will
not be held by the carb over the full rev range, and any setting is
a compromise? well you (or the government) choses which one is more
important.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">In the UK because of the emissions requirements,
a post August '75 car will tend to be tuned by a garage to minimise
emissions (epecially if the tune up follows a test failure). This
should give good MPG too but poor power output and higher engine
temps.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Because of the variability of mixture through
the rev range (and with air pressure / altitude / temperature)
carbs are traditionally tuned slighty rich giving good power, lower
temps but below best MPG and bad emissions. This "traditional"
state of tune will be achieved by following the procedures laid out
in (for example) the Haynes manual.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">My old '73 1600 TP had exhaust so clear it was
invisible and easily passed the emissions for post 1.8.75 busses
when it was tuned as per Haynes.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">In my opinion this slightly rich mixture is
better for your VW.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">It is of course in contradition with the mixture
I would like you to set for the benefit of the environment but
that's exactly the horns of dilemma on which you are
impailed.</font></p>
