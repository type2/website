<h3>Type IV Engine ('72-'79 Bus) Exhaust Leak</h3>
<p>by Steve Dolan and David Schwarze</p>
<hr size="2">
<blockquote><font size="+1"><i>I think i have finally found out
what the ticking noise is on the '73 Westy...Exhaust!!! #2 to
exhaust port to heaterbox joint. I removed the muffler and R/H
heater box today and found the brass crush gasket black and sooty
about 1/3 the diameter as well as the adjacent head area. I checked
the pipe for squareness and filed it smooth and reinstalled all the
exhaust and the noise is still there!</i></font></blockquote>

<p><font size="+1">This is a constant problem with the '76-78
exhaust system. The ports need to be square to the bolt holes in
both planes (side-to-side and front-to back) and in a common plane
with each other. The ends are attached to the manifold pipes on the
'76-78 by two puny tack welds and I think over time they warp or
move. At any rate, the manifold gets very difficult to get on and
off and stops sealing :-( The easy solution is to take the box to a
machinist or you can:</font></p>
<ul>
<li><font size="+1">Get two rods the proper diameter to fit the
holes in the heater box end;</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Insert rods and measure that they are parallel
(they probably won't be) and the same distance apart as the studs
in the head (again, probably not).</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Take the header/box and lay it on the face of
the exhaust ports on a formica counter.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Try to rock it up on either port;</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Move it to the edge so that one and then the
other port hangs over the edge while the other port is flat to the
formica. See if it drops down.</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font size="+1">While a formica counter is not the same as a
machinists surface block, it is *very* close! There are few items
in common use as flat as a good condition formica countertop! If
any of the tests above revealed an out-of-trueness in you pipe
ends, then that needs to be corrected or you will have
leaks.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Note also that there is little margin for error,
if you grind too much off the end, then the shoulder of the bolt
flange will meet the head before the pipe end meets the copper
gasket. In this case, you can grind a bit off that shoulder. *both
sides*! *evenly*!</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">This bus wouldn't happen to have the Dansk heat
exchangers on it, would it? The ones I got from VWOA last year
wouldn't seat on the port, but bottomed out on the stud bosses, and
thus wouldn't seal. The mechanic at the VW dealer attempted to
solve the problem by overtorquing the studs, and ended up pulling
one clean out of the head. When I removed the stud, the aluminum
threads were still attached to the stud and came off like a
helicoil. The mechanic gave the bus back to me and told me, "It had
that exhaust leak when you brought it in." Grrrr...but I digress.
My solution was to get out the cutoff tool and remove about 1/2cm
of the flange where the stud goes through so it could push the heat
exchanger farther up towards the head. It has sealed fine ever
since.</font></p>
