I think i have finally found out what the ticking noise is on the '73
Westy...Exhaust!!! #2 to exhaust port to heaterbox joint.
I removed the muffler and R/H heater box today and found the brass crush
gasket black and sooty about 1/3 the diameter as well as the adjacent head
area. I  checked the pipe for squareness and filed it smooth and reinstalled all
the exhaust and the noise is still there!

This is a constant problem with the '76-78 exhaust system.  The ports need
to be square to the bolt holes in both planes (side-to-side and front-to
back) and in a common plane with each other.  The ends are attached to the
manifold pipes on the '76-78 by two puny tack welds and I think over time
they warp or move.  At any rate, the manifold gets very difficult to get
on and off and stops sealing :-( The easy solution is to take the box to a
machinist or you can:
<UL>
<LI> Get two rods the proper diameter to fit the holes in the heater box end;
<P>
<LI> Insert rods and measure that they are parallel (they probably won't be) and
the same distance apart as the studs in the head (again, probably not).
<P>
<LI> Take the header/box and lay it on the face of the exhaust ports on a
formica counter.
<P>
<LI> Try to rock it up on either port;
<P>
<LI> Move it to the edge so that one and then the other port hangs over the
edge while the other port is flat to the formica. See if it drops down.
</UL>
<P>
While a formica counter is not the same as a machinists surface block, it
is *very* close!  There are few items in common use as flat as a good
condition formica countertop!  If any of the tests above revealed an
out-of-trueness in you pipe ends, then that needs to be corrected or you
will have leaks.  
<P>
Note also that there is little margin for error, if you grind too much off
the end, then the shoulder of the bolt flange will meet the head before
the pipe end meets the copper gasket.  In this case, you can grind a bit
off that shoulder.  *both sides*!  *evenly*!

This bus wouldn't happen to have the Dansk heat exchangers on it, would it?
The ones I got from VWOA last year wouldn't seat on the port, but bottomed
out on the stud bosses, and thus wouldn't seal.  The mechanic at the VW
dealer attempted to solve the problem by overtorquing the studs, and ended
up pulling one clean out of the head.  When I removed the stud, the
aluminum threads were still attached to the stud and came off like a
helicoil.  The mechanic gave the bus back to me and told me, "It had that
exhaust leak when you brought it in." Grrrr...but I digress.  My solution
was to get out the cutoff tool and remove about 1/2cm of the flange where
the stud goes through so it could push the heat exchanger farther up
towards the head.  It has sealed fine ever since.
