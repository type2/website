<h3>Adjustments to Pass Emissions Testing (Fuel Injection)</h3>
<p>by Dennis Haynes</p>
<hr size="2">
<blockquote><font size="+1"><i>"What is your opinion on adjusting
the spring tension inside of the air flow meter? I've been
experimenting and have noticed that on an air flow meter that
wouldn't respond to CO (mixture) adjustment, tightening the spring
tension allows the CO adjustment to become possible. The spring
tension can be tightened or loosened and is indexed by a plastic
gear which is held in place by a spring. I figured you may be
familiar with this. I have done this in the past with an old BMW 5
series that was not responding to adjustment. in this case it
seemed to help a lot.</i></font>
<p><font size="+1"><i>I think that so far I was able to get the 2.1
wasserboxer to be within specs only after tightening the spring
tension inside the air flow meter by three clicks. CO about
1.00-.095 % and HC around 200 ppm. I noticed that I encountered
slow speed surging while traveling in gear 1,2 or 3rd without
giving any gas at slow speeds. After richening the mixture a little
bit, it is a little better, but it still exists. I am sure the
throttle switches are properly adjusted. Could this be a result of
changing the spring tension inside of the air flow meter? Also I
find that trying to get the 2.1 to run within spec is a time
consuming process and I find myself having the think hooked up to
the exhaust analyzer for hours at a time. Any ideas? I have seen
some info on the largest version of the 2.1 that was offered in
Germany and it was a 2.1 with 10.1 compression and running Digijet
injection, no Lamda and no catalyst. I'm sure that setup really
would run very smooth at idle and it could be tuned to pass the MD
emmisions. My 2.1 with digifant is nice and runs good, but I just
wish I could get it to run a bit smoother at idle, but I seem to
feel that these engines especially with the newer FI setup run
rough."</i></font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">As for adjusting the air flow meter, "KEEP YOUR
HANDS OFF". Put it back where it was. The whole purpose of the
Lamba system is to continuously adjust the mixture to keep it on
the money. A mixture too rich will cause the Cat to be over worked,
ineffecient at reducing CO, and overheated. I've seen the CATs burn
paint off the rear valance. A mixture that is too lean will cause
engine miss, which will also overheat the Cat, and increase the
production of Oxides of Nitrogen, a mojor component of smog.
Assuming your FI and Lamda circuit is working properly, you must
have the airflow meter way out of adjustment if you can now adjust
the CO without the system re-correcting it. When adjusting
(actually testing), the mixture should be measured before the Cat.
If your Van is running correctly, you should have near zero CO and
Hydrocarbons after the Cat, with it warmed up and ignited. It is
normal for your engine to miss slightly at idle, however, 200PPM
hydrocarbons is excessive. In NY, you fail at 220PPM and
1.2%CO.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>EMISSIONS TESTING:</b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Basically there are two types of Emissions tests
in use. Although they appear in many different forms and different
manufacturers and types of equipment is used, all the tests are
looking for the same gasses. All official test procedures also call
for a physical inspection to determine that all of a vehicles
emission control equipment is still in place. This is enforced to
varying degrees but should be considered when thinking about
removing equipment to save repair costs (removing Fuel Injection)
or looking for more performance, especially changing camshafts and
compression ratios.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The most common type of test is the one that
measures the exhaust gas content with the engine idling. The test
equipment is based on what is known as a Four Gas Analyzer. The
machine tests for Carbon Dioxide (combustion efficiency), Carbon
Monoxide (Incomplete combustion), Oxygen content, and unburned
Hydrocarbons. This tester is usually combined with a computer or
other operator interface so that test parameters such as vehicle
year, test limits etc. can be set. This machine also uses an
ignition pick up or other device to monitor engine speed during the
test. This insures that the engine is at a proper idle speed as a
high idle will enable a poor running engine to pass the test. This
type of test will eventually be required everywhere.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The other test is more complex and requires much
more complicated equipment including a Chassis Dynamometer. This
test is often refereed to as the IM-240. This test actually
simulates driving the vehicle in real world conditions for four
minutes. As the vehicle will be undergo changing speeds and loads,
the test will be able to more accurately determine the performance
of a vehicles emission control systems. This test measures
everything the above test does with the addition of being able to
measure the actual volume of certain pollutants being produced
(grams per mile). It will also be able to measure the oxides of
nitrogen (component of smog) ( 3 way cat and EGR system test) as
the engine will be operated under load. This is the test system
that will be used for most state centralized emissions testing
programs. This test will be required in many areas due to the
failure of the more reasonable testing procedures to accomplish
their goals, mostly due to consumer pressure on the station
operators and their willingness to cheat.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Now, what do all these tests mean and how do I
get my car to pass? Luckily, believe it or not, VW has done an
outstanding job in my opinion of keeping their emission control
systems as simple as possible. Although this was probably done with
the idea of keeping production costs down, it has made systems
relatively simple. Many late model VWs do not have EGR valves, Air
injection pumps etc. Except for early fuel injection systems, the
VW product line has always had much less non-sense stuff than other
makes. What is there, has a purpose and is usually easy to diagnose
and maintain. Sometimes, as easy as something may be to repair, it
may not be cheap. One problem with this simplicity is that it is
more susceptible to improper procedures causing nasty results. For
example, if a GM car can idle at all, it will probably pass the
first type test with ease. If a Vanagon doesn't have the timing and
idle speed set by the book, it will fail horribly.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Let's look at the different gases and see what
abnormal readings on these gasses mean. Whether or not your vehicle
passes the emissions test, it is a good idea to keep a record of
the readings from year to year. This information can be used to
spot trends such as fuel system degradation or an engine getting
tired.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Carbon Monoxide:</b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Measured in percent, this is the result of
incomplete combustion. In other words, the fuel mixture has been
compressed and ignited, but could not complete the combustion
process due to the lack of oxygen. This failure is always mixture
or ignition timing related. The ideal reading for CO is 0%. A
normal reading for CO is usually around .25 to .75% with 1.2% being
the failure mark in most areas for vehicles 1984 and newer. Earlier
cars are allowed higher readings. Any car equipped with an Oxygen
sensor will try to run under 1.0% as measured before the Catalytic
converter (use that test connection for set-up). A vehicle with a
CAT, O2 sensor, and an AIR system (Air Injection Reaction) will
read almost 0% with everything working properly.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Most '70s cars should run between 1.0 to 2.0%
with 2.5% being the usual failure point. I find that 1600 dual port
will run fine in this range and with Fuel Injection, should be able
to run about .5 to 1.5 %. Remember this is at idle so it is not an
issue with overheating the heads and burning valves. '50s and '60s
cars will need to run richer still to remain smooth running.
Anything over 3.5 to 4.0% in any car is cause for concern although
most test programs allow up to 6.0% for early vehicles. This is a
lot of forgiveness in an inspection program. Over advanced ignition
timing will also cause high CO readings at idle due to the idle
speed control being set low in order for the engine to idle at a
reasonable speed. VWs are especially sensitive to this. Keep this
in mind when using different distributors.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Hydrocarbons:</b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Measured in PPM (parts per million), this is the
result of unburned fuel making it out the tailpipe. This is
different from the CO problem in that here the fuel has not started
combustion at all. This failure is usually caused by an ignition
(misfire), or an engine problem such as a bad valve. An engine
running too lean will often have excessive HC due to what is called
a "lean misfire". Any leaks in the intake system or bad injectors
will also cause excessive HC due to uneven fuel
distribution.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Vanagons are very susceptible to the "lean
misfire". Here the ideal reading again is 0 PPM. Most late model
cars should run under 100 PPM with readings between 10 an 50 PPM
being typical and a reading of over 220 PPM being the failure point
for must inspection programs. Again, older cars are allowed more
freedom although I find that most any car should be able to run
under 400 PPM. My 1923 Haynes runs at 300 to 350 ppm HC and 4.0%
CO. High HC readings are a little more challenging to trouble shoot
because there are so many possible causes including a mixture or
worse, a cylinder balance problem.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Carbon Dioxide:</b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Carbon Dioxide is the end product of all Fossil
Fuel combustion. CO-2, measured in percent is an indication of an
engine's combustion efficiency. The ideal is 14% with most VWs
running in the 12.5% to 13.5 range. CO-2 output is affected by
timing (valve and ignition), compression, mixture, engine condition
and temperature. The IM-240 tests will also measure the actual
volume of CO-2 produced and limits will be set according to vehicle
design. If centralized testing is coming to your area, be very
careful of any modifications made to your vehicle. Even changes to
your tires sizes and gear ratios will affect this test.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Oxygen:</b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Measured in percent, is actually excess oxygen
left over from the combustion process. If this reading is very low,
then you will also experience high CO. In boilers and other
equipment, we avoid high readings as that indicates excess air
which reduces heating efficiency. In automobiles, we usually are
looking for about 18%. Normal atmosphere is 21%. This is controlled
in late model vehicles by the Oxygen Sensor circuit. The O2 sensor
actually measures the Difference in O2 content of the atmosphere
and the exhaust. When the atmosphere has more O2 than the exhaust,
a small positive voltage is generated.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The Vehicle Computer (ECM), senses this signal
and then adjusts the mixture accordingly. You can measure the fuel
mixture of an O2 sensor equipped vehicle with a Digital Multimeter
(DMM). If the mixture control system is working properly, you
should see the signal fluctuate from .1 to .7 volts. This voltage
correlates closely (not by design, just luck) with the actual CO
percent (Example: .5 volt is approximately .5% CO). This is great
news as we could install a universal O2 sensor in any car and use a
DMM to set the mixture. If you wish to do this, ensure that you
mount the sensor in a "hot " area of the exhaust as it has to be
heated to 600 degrees F in order to function. This is why many cars
included 86 and later Vanagons use a three wire sensor. The three
wire sensor actual has a heating element built in to preheat the
sensor. This enables the sensor to go on-line on a cold engine much
sooner and keeps weather and driving conditions from effecting the
sensor. I find that earlier Vanagons often have problems with
sensor performance as the sensor is mounted far enough down stream
in the exhaust that they don't get adequately heated during cold
weather or when the engine is idling. This also creates havoc with
emissions tests as vehicles are often tested without being
thoroughly warmed up (car must be driven to properly warm up all
emission equipment, especially the Cat).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">So what does all this mean? Well we went for our
test and we failed. Our van seems torun okay but it failed. Lets
review why.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Failed the CO!</b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Check the Mixture and Ignition Timing.
Especially on VWs, over advance timing will cause high CO readings.
When setting up ignition timing, mixture, and idle speed, follow
the book. On Digijet Vanagons, disconnect and bypass the Idle
Stabilizer when setting the timing and idle speed. Resist the
temptation to "advance" the timing for performance. Also make sure
both the vacuum and mechanical advance mechanisms are working
properly. On Digifant Vans, Disconnect the Temperature Sensor
before setting the timing. Again, resist the urge to over advance
the timing. Check the O2 sensor system to ensure it is working
properly. Resist the urge to adjust the Airflow box. If the O2
sensor system is working properly, it will compensate unless some
one has already made a mess of things. Also check the oil, diluted
oil will also cause high CO readings. Worn rings and valve guides
will contribute to this also. However this will only be a problem
on very tired engines. Setting the idle speed around 1000 rpm will
also help keep the CO readings down.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Failed the HC!</b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Check the ignition system first. This usually
caused by an ignition miss. Then check the engine. Poorly seated
valves, leaking head gaskets, or other compression problems will
put the HC readings through the roof. Also check for vacuum leaks
and the injector spray patterns. Remember, HC failures are usually
caused by compression or ignition problems. Improper fuel
distribution/vacuum leaks will cause misfires that will cause
excessive HC.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Failed both CO and HC!</b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">If the HC is very high and the CO is close, you
probably have an ignition/compression related problem. If the CO is
very high and the HC is close, than you may only have a
timing/mixture problem. Use the above procedures accordingly and
you should be able to resolve your emissions failure blues. Next
time, we will talk about all that infamous junk they put on our
cars to control the emissions. I will explain the purpose of these
devices that you can better troubleshoot your cars and also to help
you decide which equipment is worth maintaining or discarding when
searching for more performance. One thing to keep in mind is that
much of this equipment is put on our cars because we don't maintain
them. That's why some car manufactures are shooting for 100,000
mile maintenance intervals.</font></p>
