<h3>Backfiring</h3>
<p>by Vince Knauf</p>
<hr size="2">
<p><font size="+1">Most often a backfire is the result of an air
leak in the exhaust system. For a moment when you up shift and
often when you let off the gas, there is a temorary "over rich"
condition with too much gas in the cylinders. This blows into the
exhaust and if there is oxygen (air leak) then it explodes in the
hot exhaust pipe. Without the air leak, it is cooled enough not to
explode by the time it reaches the atmosphere in a tight
exhaust.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Look at the exhaust system and repair any
problems. Also make sure that the carb is adjusted for good running
and fuel economy otherwise.</font></p>
