<h3>Do-it-yourself Awning</h3>

<p><font size="+1">Just a money saving tip for Vanagon
owners!</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I've owned several VW's myself over the years. I
currently have an 81 camper van. Having checked prices for awnings,
I decided to make my own for about 1/10th the cost of a pre-made
one. (At prices around $250)</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Parts? An 8' x 10' foot tarp ($16), 50' of 3/16"
Nylon rope and two large washers ($3), 8' section of 1/4" steel rod
($4), two extendable tent poles ($8).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I removed the grommets from one end of the 8'
section of tarp, folded it over and had the wife sew it to leave a
small channel from one end to the other. This is for the 1/4" rod
to slide through. I took the rope, cut two lengths and tied the
washer in the center of each length of rope and tied each end with
slip knots so that they are ready to use with the tent stakes. You
need to get rid of any rough edges in the inside and outside of the
washers. This will insure long rope life.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">To set it up, the 1/4" rod is slid through the
end of the tarp where sewed and then slid into the 8' channel
(already on the van as part of the camper package) above the
sliding door. Two poles........ two ropes....... 4 tent stakes and
5 to 10 minutes, it's up. (Fives minutes for two people, 10 minutes
for 1)</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The tarp is folded in it's bag under the seat,
poles go in storage compartments and the 1/4" rod rides in the 8'
channel while traveling.</font></p>
