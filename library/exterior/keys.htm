<h3>Keys and Locks</h3>
<p>by H Steven Dolan</p>
<hr size="2">
<p><font size="+1">All OEM VW keys, and all OEM VW locks have a key
code stamped on them. The key code takes the form "nnannn" where n
= a number and a= a letter. For example: "58L047" or "85R088". If
you don't have an OEM key, the easiest cylinder to get to, and the
one least often changed is the one on the lid of the
tailgate.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Any competent locksmith can either:</font></p>
<ol>
<li><font size="+1">Cut a key to the key code (and you will be
amazed at how much better the *right* key works than a nth
generation copy)</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Re-pin a cylinder to a key code or to a key cut
to from the key code.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font size="+1">The cost for getting a key cut to the code for
me here in the Washington, DC area was $15.00. The cost for
re-pinning the cylinder to match the key code was $40.00. Your
mileage may vary! Go to a locksmith, not a key cutter! There *is* a
difference!</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">If you take the re-pin route, examine the
orientation of the key and lever thoroughly before you deliver the
cylinder to the locksmith. They know locks, not VW's. Mine
assembled the ignition cylinder backward and had to re-orient it.
The standard for VW's is that the big lobe of the key faces the
rear of the vehicle, and actuates by turning up/forward.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">If you have a cylinder re-pinned, <b>do</b> take
a file and file out the now invalid code. Future owners will thank
you :-)</font></p>
