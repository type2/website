<h3>Keys and Locks

All OEM VW keys, and all OEM VW locks have a key code stamped on them.
The key code takes the form "nnannn" where n = a number and a= a letter.
For example: "58L047" or "85R088". If you don't have an OEM key, the 
easiest cylinder to get to, and the one
least often changed is the one on the lid of the tailgate.
<p>
Any competent locksmith can either:
<p>
<OL>
<LI>Cut a key to the key code (and you will be amazed at how much better
the *right* key works than a nth generation copy)
<LI>Re-pin a cylinder to a key code or to a key cut to from the key code.
</OL>
<p>
The cost for getting a key cut to the code for me here in the
Washington, DC area was $15.00.  The cost for re-pinning the cylinder to
match the key code was $40.00.  Your mileage may vary!  Go to a locksmith, not a key
cutter!  There *is* a difference!
<p>
If you take the re-pin route, examine the orientation of the key and lever
thoroughly before you deliver the cylinder to the locksmith.  They know
locks, not VW's.  Mine assembled the ignition cylinder backward and had to
re-orient it.  The standard for VW's is that the big lobe of the key faces
the rear of the vehicle, and actuates by turning up/forward.
<p>
If you have a cylinder re-pinned, <B>do</B> take a file and file out the now
invalid code.  Future owners will thank you :-)
