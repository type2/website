Look at the base of the chrome arm and you will see a roll pin
going thru it. Drive out the pin and the arm comes off. Find a bus
in a wrecking yard with a good knob/arm on it and drivr out the
roll pin. Install it on your window. Watch out for the 68's, they
do not use a roll pin and you cannot replace them. Here is a pic of
the two different versions:</code></font></p>

replaceable.</code></font></p>

but I have seen them infrequently used up to 71, is not repairable
easily.</code></font></p>

can't find one.</code><br></font></p>
