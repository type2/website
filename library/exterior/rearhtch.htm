The bay rear lid-hatch changed for the 72 year model. Sounds like you found a 68-71 lid..... 
<p>
 211 829 105 Q: up to 211 2300 000 [end of 71] 
<br>
 211 829 105 AD: from 212 2000 001 [start of 72] 
<p>
 This also means the hatch seal changed: 
<p>
 211 829 193 C up to end of 71 
<br>
 211 829 193 E from 72 up 
<p>
 And the latch assembly: 
<p>
 211 829 211 E up to end of 71 
<br>
 211 829 211 H from 72 up 
<p>
 And the striker plate: 
<p>
 211 829 221 D up to end of 71 
<br>
 211 829 221 E from 72 up 
<p>
 And, yes, the hinges are different also: 
<p>
 211 829 641 [left] and 211 829 642 [right] up to end of 71 
<br>
 211 829 641 C [left] and 211 829 642 C [right] from 72 up 
<p>
 Bottom line: an earlier 68-71 hatch won't fit a 72+.... but it will fit a split bus from 64 to 
 67 IF it has the push button latch in it. From chassis number 1 144 282. 
 64-66 are round, 67 has the hook 
 on it like 68+. [64-66 are T code, 67-70 are L code, 71-79 are R code locks] But you would need to use the correct year split latch assembly.
