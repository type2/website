<h3>Jalousie Window Installation ('68-'79 Type 2)</h3>
<p>by Chris Cybulski</p>

<p><font size="+1">First pull out whatever glass is in there. A
razor to cut the seal, a screwdriver to bend the tabs for the wing
window that are hidden inside underneath the seal and a fist to
pound the old glass out.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Second, prep the frame. Get it good and clean.
Rust? Then sand and prep with POR 15 or your favorite toxic brew.
Make those frames nice and smooth. Maybe even wax them
up.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">What shape are your jalousie windows in? Pull
the screens and hose them off. A Little soap and water for good
measure! Now, some 0000 steel wool will bring a nice shine to those
old oxidized aluminum frames. You would be suprised how nice they
look.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">And now for the hard part: the seals. Do you
have new ones? Fit the seal around the outer metal part of the
jalousie window. It will seem a bit loose. Now for the really hard
part. The rest of the seal (except for the corner area of the
windows) must be pushed in the groove that is made by the space
between where you just put the seal and the back side of the screw
track. This seems an impossible task but it can be done. Start on
the end of one of the tracks. The use a screwdriver push back as
you push down with your other hand. It will start to lock itself in
the groove and then you can run the screwdriver at a 45 degree
angle and drag it along the seal and it will push in. Repeat this
process ad infinitum. I cannot tell you how much this part sucked
but it is why the buggers wouldn't fit right the first time:) Take
you time and think good thoughts. Maybe it will be easier for
you.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Back to the bus. If you are installing jalousie
windows in a bus that never had them you will need to drill some
holes. I think the Bentley specs 13 but I drilled four on top four
on the bottom and 2 on each side. You will be using 1/2" #4 machine
screws for the install(#6 if you screw tracks are buggered.) Pick a
drill bit that is just a hair smaller than the screw and drill you
holes in the bus window frame a drill bits width in from the edge
so they will line up with the screw track. You might wanna dry fit
the windows first so you can visualize the process as you
drill.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Go in the house and get some liquid dish soap.
Smear the soap on inside of the seals and on the bus window frame.
Put some kite string in the outside groove of the seal. Although
this practice is really for putting in regular glass it made it
easier to get the seal set once it is installed.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I did one window installation with a helper in
the bus and me outside pushing, and the other I did by myself. Do
not be a island. Get some help. You will be happier. Now, slide the
top of the window up and then in. This is kinda like getting the
screens in and out. Now push!!!!! Harder!!!!!! One person holds the
window in with pressure while the other starts inserting screws.
This will draw the window snuggly into the frame. Once all the
screws are in you can pull the string out that you wrapped around
the seal groove and it will pull the flap of the seal out so that
water does not get in. We have had 5 drenching storms and a 3 day
rain and I have no leaks. I guess I did something right for a
change.</font></p>
