<h3>Rear Window Defroster Testing</h3>
<p>by Karl "Aufever"</p>

<blockquote><font size="+1"><i>I have checked continuity & I
actually have it across all the wires going across the window. Is
that a miracle or what? I was changing the window seal out this
last weekend & decided to check it out & was
amazed.</i></font></blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">I have never found testing each line going
across to be accurate with an ohmmeter. You have a positive common
connection on one end of the glass and a negative common connection
on the other end. Let's say you have 10 lines. Let's say only one
is making a complete circuit across. ANY other line you check with
the ohmmeter will show a circuit, zero resistance, because you are
reading the one good line. Now if you cut that good line, then you
could check each other one....providing you didn't have one more
good line..... The only true test I've found is to get the window
frosty and apply voltage, then see which line isn't clearing the
frost.</font></p>
