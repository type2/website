<h3>Jalousies and Sliders</h3>
<p>by Karl von Salzen</p>

<p><font size="+1"><code>Westy vanagon sliders are the same size as
pass vanagons, except the latch is 14 1/2" back from the corner so
you can have a screen mounted and be able to open the window. The
fixed glass is shorter and the movable glass is longer. I can give
you these measurements too, if you want them:)</code></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><code>The only bay sliders I have seen with
screens in them are the ASI Riviera sliders. They were made in the
USA and are very tough to find. Expensive when you do find
them.</code></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><code>There was an aftermarket screen that was
bolted to the outside of the slider frame. The screws went thru the
screen frame, thru the rubber seal, and into the body. I have only
found 2 pairs of these in the past 5 - 6 years. I gave one pair to
Charlie Ford for his bus, Mothership, when he was on his 'search
for the wind' trip a few years back. He may still have them on his
bus.... if he still has it</code></font></p>
