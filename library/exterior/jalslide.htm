Westy vanagon sliders are the same size as pass vanagons, except the latch is 14 1/2" back from the corner so you can have a screen mounted and be able to open the window. The fixed glass is shorter and the movable glass is longer. I can give you these measurements too, if you want them:) 
<p>
The only bay sliders I have seen with screens in them are the ASI Riviera sliders. They were made in the USA and are very tough to find. Expensive when you do find them. 
<p>
There was an aftermarket screen that was bolted to the outside of the slider frame. The screws went thru the screen frame, thru the rubber seal, and into the body. I have only found 2 pairs of these in the past 5 - 6 years. I gave one pair to Charlie Ford for his bus, Mothership, when he was on his 'search for the wind' trip a few years back. He may still have them on his bus.... if he still has it
