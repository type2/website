<h3>Key Cutting</h3>
<p>by Jim Thompson</p>
<hr size="2">
<blockquote><font size="+1"><i>"I suddenly find myself in the
possession of a nifty little item I'd never heard of before: a
Curtis Key cutter."</i></font></blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">The Curtis #14 Code Cutter (spinning wheels and
all that, eh?): We're talking about a "Vintage" item. I have two of
these myself (each with a wheel of its own), as well as the
appropriate "carriages" used for almost every VW key pattern (or
"profile" as VW called them) along with the code books. In
addition, I also have the "newer" code cutter gun, Curtis #15,
which is a little easier to use for the double-sided keys than the
older #14 you have. I've been using mine to cut VW codes for over
20 years and have cut keys for several listmembers as well in the
past year. I generally charge $9.00 to code cut a pair of keys
(aftermarket blanks only - but I use the best quality I can
get).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Curtis cutter guns are the locksmith's standard
for cutting keys for just about anything with a code, not just
VW's. Local locksmiths are always asking me if I wanna sell mine to
them all of the time (nope - not for sale).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Locksmiths here in California generally charge
$22.50 to code cut the first key, then $10 afterwards for each
additional key. Some locksmiths charge double in some areas of
California though. And like them, because of the fact I do this
service as well, requires a locksmithing permit in almost every
locale, costing from as low as $50 to as much as $900 per year.
Again, depending on locale and it's a PITA when doing it for the
first time. When I moved out of LA 5 years ago, it was not near as
difficult to do in Shasta County versus LA County where it's a
bureaucratic maze (and mess). From a friend of mine in Roseburg,
OR, who retired from Pac Bell years ago, I hear the permit process
and costs are a little more relaxed up there (he got into
locksmithing as a part-time thing), but I'd check first before
starting to publicly code cut keys.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Generally, the code book gives explicit
step-by-step instructions which go something like this:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Look at the code on the cylinder and look it up
in the appropriate section of the code book. It will tell you what
Curtis Key # to use, then tell you where to set the wheel to the
Curtis two or three letter code. Then it will tell you what
carriage to use. The carriage is the neat little block of metal
that holds the key. The code book will tell you where to insert the
carriage and key into the cutter (locksmiths call it a "gun" BTW).
Then it tells you where to set the little arm into the particular
slots on the wheel that determine the proper depth of the cut
(could be depth 1, 2, 3 or 4). Generally most VW keys of the 50's
through mid 70's had five cuts, from the key head out. Once you get
the hang of it, you can, by looking at an existing key, tell what
the depth of each cut is and not even look up a code.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">As far as the ring(s) of keys you have, the way
to find out if they are Bus Keys is to look at the pattern of the
"key milling" The key milling is the number and placement of
various slots the blank key is, thus determining it's VW profile.
VW profiles D, E, F, V, A & Z (Curtis V6, V23, Taylor 62VE, V68K,
Ilco VW3) are used on Type 2's through 1963. Profile T (Curtis V19,
Taylor V72L, Ilco VW64T)(Double Sided Cuts) is used on Type 2's
64-66 and profile L (Curtis V25, Taylor V78G, Ilco VW67S)(Double
Sided Cuts) is used on Type 2's 67-70.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Maintenance tip: Always keep the cutter gun
clean and lubricated. I use Lock-Ease brand graphite lubricant. And
don't take it apart - this is a very precision adjusted tool that
is most difficult to realign to the proper depth cuts - been there,
done that, cleaned up the mess, waiting for the T-Shirt
;-)</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">A thing or two about codes: the code on the lock
cylinder is not always the "be-all" information. It's very easy for
someone to get into there and swap the tumblers (actually, the
correct term is wafers for car locks), thus rendering the code
absolutely meaningless. In addition, the wafers do tend to wear
with age and even if the code cut is correct, the wear of the
tumbler sometimes requires a teeny bit of filing to allow a more
correct fit and smoother action of the lock.</font></p>
