"I suddenly find myself in the possession of a nifty little item I'd never
heard of before: a Curtis Key cutter."

The Curtis #14 Code Cutter (spinning wheels and all that, eh?):
We're talking about a "Vintage" item.  I have two of these myself
(each with a wheel of its own), as well as the appropriate "carriages"
used for almost every VW key pattern (or "profile" as VW called them) along
with the code books.  In addition, I also have the "newer" code cutter gun,
Curtis #15, which is a little easier to use for the double-sided keys than
the older #14 you have.  I've been using mine to cut VW codes for over 20
years and have cut keys for several listmembers as well in the past year.
I generally charge $9.00 to code cut a pair of keys (aftermarket blanks
only - but I use the best quality I can get).
<p> 
Curtis cutter guns are the locksmith's standard for cutting keys for just
about anything with a code, not just VW's.  Local locksmiths are always
asking me if I wanna sell mine to them all of the time (nope - not for sale).
<p> 
Locksmiths here in California generally charge $22.50 to code cut the first
key, then $10 afterwards for each additional key.  Some locksmiths charge
double in some areas of California though.  And like them, because of the
fact I do this service as well, requires a locksmithing permit in almost
every locale, costing from as low as $50 to as much as $900 per year.
Again, depending on locale and it's a PITA when doing it for the first
time.  When I moved out of LA 5 years ago, it was not near as difficult to
do in Shasta County versus LA County where it's a bureaucratic maze (and
mess).  From a friend of mine in Roseburg, OR, who retired from Pac Bell
years ago, I hear the permit process and costs are a little more relaxed up
there (he got into locksmithing as a part-time thing), but I'd check first
before starting to publicly code cut keys.
<p> 
Generally, the code book gives explicit step-by-step instructions which go
something like this:
<p> 
Look at the code on the cylinder and look it up in the appropriate section
of the code book.  It will tell you what Curtis Key # to use, then tell you
where to set the wheel to the Curtis two or three letter code.  Then it
will tell you what carriage to use.  The carriage is the neat little block
of metal that holds the key.  The code book will tell you where to insert
the carriage and key into the cutter (locksmiths call it a "gun" BTW).
Then it tells you where to set the little arm into the particular slots on
the wheel that determine the proper depth of the cut (could be depth 1, 2,
3 or 4).  Generally most VW keys of the 50's through mid 70's had five
cuts, from the key head out.  Once you get the hang of it, you can, by
looking at an existing key, tell what the depth of each cut is and not even
look up a code.
<p> 
As far as the ring(s) of keys you have, the way to find out if they are Bus
Keys is to look at the pattern of the "key milling"  The key milling is the
number and placement of various slots the blank key is, thus determining
it's VW profile.  VW profiles D, E, F, V, A & Z (Curtis V6, V23, Taylor
62VE, V68K, Ilco VW3) are used on Type 2's through 1963.  Profile T (Curtis
V19, Taylor V72L, Ilco VW64T)(Double Sided Cuts) is used on Type 2's 64-66
and profile L (Curtis V25, Taylor V78G, Ilco VW67S)(Double Sided Cuts) is
used on Type 2's 67-70.
<p> 
Maintenance tip:  Always keep the cutter gun clean and lubricated.  I use
Lock-Ease brand graphite lubricant.  And don't take it apart - this is a
very precision adjusted tool that is most difficult to realign to the
proper depth cuts - been there, done that, cleaned up the mess, waiting for
the T-Shirt ;-)
<p> 
A thing or two about codes: the code on the lock cylinder is not always
the "be-all" information.  It's very easy for someone to get into there and
swap the tumblers (actually, the correct term is wafers for car locks),
thus rendering the code absolutely meaningless.  In addition, the wafers do
tend to wear with age and even if the code cut is correct, the wear of the
tumbler sometimes requires a teeny bit of filing to allow a more correct
fit and smoother action of the lock.
