  <h3>Westfalia Jalousie Windows ('67-earlier Type 2)</h3>

  <p>by Jim Ellis (aka Rusty VanBondo)</p>

  <p><font size="+1">Removal and Disassembly:</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1">In pursuit of the completion of the infamous '67 Westy
  Resto from "Heck" the VanBondo tribe decided to detail the dickens out of
  the five louvered glass camper windows. Additional windows were acquired at
  various shows and junkyards during the eternal wait for the completion of
  the body and paint processes. Most of the time they can be had for cheap
  and are in sad disrepair. Elbow grease and clock time can make these
  puppies really look and work nice.</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1">During the initial tear-down of the bus we carefully
  removed the delicate painted metal trim pieces from around each of the
  windows. In the SO-42 interiors these trim frames were painted to resemble
  wood. Easily bent, they were placed in a safe location until they would be
  put back into service. Next we very carfully removed the screen from each
  window. Press on the top of each screen frame sliding it toward the roof of
  the bus. Select a very thin tool, possibly a small standard blade
  screwdriver (if necessary!) and slip it between the frame and the bottom of
  the screen frame and help it out of it's track. BE CAREFUL as the screen
  material (if still intact) will be real delicate and will rip very easily!
  The screen frames themselves have a tendancy to fold and crease if given
  enough pressure. (Been there, etc.) Take your time. Place the screens in a
  secure spot, maybe in a box, for later. The window frame assemblies
  themselves were carefully extracted from the bus via several screws located
  around the perimeter of each window on the inside of the van. Have a helper
  on the exterior of the bus to prevent the frames from accidentially falling
  to the ground and becoming damaged. Set them aside, out of foot stepping
  range, as they are removed.</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1">Once we had the frame assemblies removed from the
  vehicle, we had to make a decision as to whether to make them look stock or
  jazz them up a bit. Inspired by a nice white SO-42 that we saw at both the
  '95 and '96 SOTO Garden Grove show, we decided to polish the frames to a
  high polish. Highly polished jalousie windows are not stock but they kinda
  look similar to chrome and set off the generally utilitarian nature of the
  beast when completed. The alternative might be to have the frames glass
  beaded or attacked with 3M scuff pads. Stock, original camper windows of
  this type have a understated satin appearence and look nice also. It's a
  personal taste thing. The amout of detail that you put into these windows
  is up to you and will determine whether they will have rattling glass,
  retain the dreaded draftiness, and look sharp (either polished or OEM) or
  tattered, dirty, and dull.</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1">Starting with frames which had the typical thirty plus
  years of dinge on them we dissasembled them down to the bare frames.
  Removal of the three main slats of tempered glass should be accomplished
  via the back (top) side of the three pairs of hinged aluminum holders.
  Carefully maneuver the glass away from each pair of rotating aluminum
  holders. I have seen sets of window frames ruined by attempts at glass
  removal by the front (or lower) end of each pair of holders. The aluminum
  which makes up the rotating pairs of holders can withstand only a certain
  amount bending. Radical tweaking of the arms will result in ruined and
  worthless frames. Retracting the glass from the frame involves a
  combination of rotating the crank handles to various positions and a touch
  of experience with Japanese puzzles. Take your time and look at the frame
  closely. You will eventually figure them out. Each window frame has one
  singular stationary piece of glass postioned at the top of the frame. This
  remaining piece is removed by undoing the single phillips head screws, one
  on each side of the frame.</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1">We chose to carefully remove the six highly weathered
  grey rubber retention (rattle) stoppers on each frame. These rubber bumper
  pieces are located between the glass and the frame at the end of each piece
  of movable glass. If dried to the point at which you choose to remove them,
  try gentle prying with a small standard blade screwdriver or small needle
  nosed plyers. The key word to doing these windows is "gently." Next
  separate the two halves of the main frame assemblies by removing the
  eighteen phillips head screws from the perimeter of each frame. Gently pry
  the two halves apart and remove the dried putty type material that is stuck
  on the pieces. Try a wood popcycle stick or fat edged ceramic tool to
  prevent scratching the frames.</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1">The last item to be removed is the crank assembly. I
  found that cranking the window approximately half way open and removing the
  two phillips screws to be the first part. The second part is to look in
  between the main frame and the sliding piece that keeps the three slat
  holders in synch. Wiggle the crank handle assembly until the round disk
  shape that is inserted into the guide piece lifts free. Use your finger or
  the light touch of a screwdriver to assist if necessary.</font></p>

    <font size="+1"><i>...replaced the seals on one jalousie window, boy was
    that more work than I expected. The metal looked good once I scraped off
    the concrete like glue used on the inner aluminum frame.</i></font>
  </blockquote>

  <p><font size="+1">VanBondo suspects that the "concrete like glue" was a
  rock hard vesion of the "putty tape" that is readily available at any RV or
  trailer sales and supplier. The putty is exaclty like the window sash putty
  that was/is used in older style home window frames. The putty tape comes in
  a roll with a crepe paper liner. It is produced in a consistant thickness
  and width. The crepe keeps it from sticking together while rolled up like a
  roll of tape. (I think that I have made that clear enough...) It is real
  cheap and definitely in need of being replaced. It is the real seal between
  the weather and the interior of your bus. The grey rubber outer seal is
  technically a "dust seal."</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1">Check with your hardware supplier or professional paint
  supplier. I think that there might be a chance that some form of mineral
  spirits, paint thinner etc. **In a well ventilated area away from flames**
  might help to soften the petrified putty. Check with a professional for
  advice.</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1">Over all, the refurbishing of these windows is a lot of
  common sense, patience and tons of literal lubrication and the other kind
  of grease as mentioned. No need to force anything! Simply remove the wormy
  gear/handle mechanism via the two screws that hold it in place. Use a lot
  of common sense an really look at how it all goes together/comes apart.
  Most of the problems with these windows are caused by dirt and lack of
  lube. The glass can be removed from the inside once the slats can be
  rotated about half way open. *DONT* pry the aluminum holders and try to
  remove the glass from the bottom of each holder. The aluminum cracks pretty
  easily. Thank goodness I had more than one set to mess with when doing
  mine.</font></p>
  <hr>

  <p><font size="+1">It boils down to elbow grease and tons of polish. The
  windows can be disassembled fairly easily. A medium satin sheen would be
  stock. Taking the frames to someone who polished aluminum for the
  Harley/Hotrod crowd could make them look almost like chrome (which is not
  stock but looks nice). You can coose to clear coat the frames if the
  "chrome" appearence is to be retained. Otherwise the sheen will gradually
  return to the stockish look.</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1">Use stainless steel screws when reassembling the
  windows. get them from your local specialty fastener supplier. Take
  examples with you in order to match them up.</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1">New/NOS Stock dustseals are impossible to locate. Buy up
  these camper window frames at swap meets until you obtain enough seals that
  look good enough.</font></p>
  <hr>

  <p><font size="+1">I recently discovered a supplier of a screen material
  that might be worth looking at if you need to repair or replace the screens
  in your camper. This stuff looks like it would be aestheically appealing in
  all generations of campers. The material is fine mesh enough to approximate
  the old splittie screens in the Jalousie windows and would still be nice in
  the Euros etc. Designed to resist damage by kids and pets. The display had
  a pic of a Collie with paws *leaning* on the stuff!!! =)</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1">Don't force the jalousie windows!!!!! Remove the two
  screws that hold the crank mechanism to the window frame and gingerly work
  to get the whole crank assembly apart from the frame. Look for dirt and
  misalignment. Clean and relube with white lith grease. I have found that
  99% of the time that jalousie windows fail to open/crank due to old grease
  and dirt. The other percent is from their owners reefing on them with vice
  grips! I have found that speaking sweetly, spending time examining,
  cleaning, and lots of lubrication gets you further than forcing
  yourself.</font></p>
