  <h1>Type 2: Sliding Door Maintenance</h1>

  <p>Mostly maintainance is cleaning and greasing. There are three "points of
  motion", two are fairly simple, one a bit complex.</p><img src=

  <p>First, the upper and lower rollers do need to be present and do need to
  be greased. White lithium grease (sold in tubes or spray cans) is ideal. In
  the spray can it can be poked into places that would otherwise require
  disassembly. It is made for use on boat trailers so it is water-proof. As
  for the tracks at the top and bottom of the door: the top track rarely
  needs more than a wipe and grease. The bottom track needs to be cleaned,
  needs to be greased, and then needs to be looked at with an eye toward
  straightness. If there are significant humps or dips in the track, you are
  gonna have trouble. Why are there dips and humps? Because you need new
  rockers and a new track! As the rocker rusts off, the track begins to rust
  itself, and it sags from lack of support. Get the rockers replaced.</p>

  <p>The third point is the rear support (RS) and track. As with the upper
  track, there is rarely anything wrong with the track, it just needs a wipe
  and grease. That RS is a complex little puppy under great strain, though,
  and ought to come out and be inspected. You <em>don't</em> need to remove
  the sliding door to get the RS off! Here's how:</p><img src="rearbolt.jpeg"
  align="left" height="154" width="200" alt="Fig 2">

  <p>First, get inside the bus and close the slider. There will be two M6
  bolts at the rear of the door that attach the support to the door. (Figure
  1) If you are lucky, they are covered by black plastic caps. Remove the
  caps and the bolts. Open the door. Get a milk crate and a couple boards,
  open the door just enough to get it popped out at the back to the maximum
  (only and inch or two). Look inside the support and you will see two more
  bolts inside the rear edge of the door. (Figure 2) Remove them. Support the
  rear edge of the door on the milk crate and boards, lift it slightly, and
  pull the RS to the rear. It will come out. It may require some wiggle, but
  it will come out.</p>

  <p>Now you have to get the RS assembly off the track. Slide that assembly
  to the rear of the bus until you reach the cutout in the track. That gap is
  where the top of the plastic block lifts up off the track. After the
  plastic block is off, then wriggle the wheel off the track. Note that if
  you don't lift the block thru that gap, <em>you will break the block!</em>
  Also, I usually have no problem tugging the cover out enough to remove the
  RS without removing the cover. <em>But</em> if it looks like it might kink
  the cover, or you are just not comfortable, then remove the cover (see
  procedure below).</p>

  <p>Now that you have the RS assembly in your hands and loose of the bus,
  sit down and take a "70's moment." Sit and grok, in other words. There is a
  slider block (plastic and usually worn out), a wheel (sometimes in one
  piece with really nice ball bearings, but usually without and wobbling
  free), and the <strong>U</strong> with its support bearings and the two
  catches, neatly housed in a (usually) broken pot metal casting.</p>

  <p>And you wondered why it didn't work right! These RS's used to be common
  as dirt and you could get them from any junk yard for $5, but they are
  getting rarer and rarer, especially in decent condition. When you are in a
  junk yard and see one in decent condition, I advise collecting it! The
  casting and bearings for the <strong>U</strong> are NLA, so be careful! The
  secret is simply to disassemble, clean, grease, and reassemble, keeping
  track of the little parts and pieces.</p>

  <p>Once the RS is ready for reinstallation, pop it onto the track, and back
  into its cove in the door, then insert the bolts loosely from the outside,
  rear, and then, entering thru the front doors, to the inside front. At this
  point, you want to tighten the rear pair to "snug" but with possiblity of
  movement and adjust the rear of the door so that it is centered up and
  down. If the door is too high, it won't close, if it is too low, it won't
  open. Once it is centered, crank the front bolts from the inside and
  tighten the rear bolts from the outside.</p>

  <h2>Sliding Door Track Cover Removal/Installation:</h2>

  <p>Remove the screws at the front (Figure 3) and rear (Figure 4) lower
  corners (underneath). Note that these screws have probably never been
  removed, so be sure to soak them liberally with WD-40 for a day or two
  first. Next get a stiff 6" putty knife and hammer, and put the putty knife
  blade up in the top (<em>OUTSIDE</em> the clip, eh???(Figure 5)) and bang
  the cover up by banging on the handle of the putty knife. Move the putty
  knife forward and backward to spread the load! When it comes time to
  reinstall, use a 2x4 to bang it down. <em>Never</em> bang directly on the
  cover, as it will bend very easily!</p><img src="coverscrews.jpeg" height=
