<h3>Low - Cost Heating Improvements</h3>
<p>by Joe Sharpe-Velazquez</p>
<hr size="2">
<p><font size="+1">It's really cold in Oregon now, so I went at the
bus this week in earnest looking to thaw out my wife's toes. It
worked great, and since most of the other busses I pass look like
people are dying in them, I thought I'd share:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">- Opened up the front grill (where the fresh air
comes in through two flaps) and duct taped those suckers closed. If
I want fresh air, I've got windows, and at highway speeds I could
feel lots of cold air coming in regardless of the position of the
blue lever. All the foam which is supposed to seal those flaps has
long since rotted away.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">- Took silicone sealant and hit the gaps in my
front door seals. At night, with one person inside the car looking
while the other runs a flashlight along the seals, we spotted
plenty of spots where the seals (which look fine) just didn't seal
all that great. Ran a thick bead in these places, and now I can
feel the lack of a breeze at highway speeds.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">- Ran a section of 3" PVC pipe underneath,
replacing the dilappitated cardboard/foil tube that was there.
Actually, I ran that tube over the PVC, to act as some sort of faux
insulation. Couldn't hurt. And at the front of the PVC pipe, I
stuck in the 3" Atwood bilge blower 3000 Turbo, etc, etc that
someone here recommended. HELLO! Doesn't make the air any hotter,
but it moves a helluva alot of it. And the noise doesn't seem that
excessive to me, even competing with my cutting-edge Do-Tech AM/FM
non-auto-reverse broken tape deck stereo's 7 watts of power (to
only the right Kraco speaker). I was truly amazed at the
difference. Since I only put it in this week, I can't attest to how
it will stand up to continuous use or if it will somehow throw my
whole bus out of harmonic balance. (I'll report if it suffers a
meltdown). But the whole gig (PVC, wiring, blower & 100 yards of
duct tape) only cost about $30, so it's worth a try,
right?</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">What did I learn? Half of the icebox effect in
my bus was created by the cold air seeping in, and half by the
pathetic amount of airflow. Now, it's much more air tight and I
have a big red switch on the steering column that evokes a deep
howl from my bus' entrials. That? Oh, that's the turbo kicking
in.</font></p>
