<h3>Using a Blower Motor to get Heat to the Front of Your Bus</h3>
<p>by Rob Tourand</p>

<p><font size="+1">I took a blower and its mounting bracket out of
a another late model bus (a '73 maybe, looked like mine (two
outlets)). I then figured out where under the front floorpan I
needed to mount the blower. If you're in the bus, it's on the
passenger side floor pan, to the right of the emergency brake
lever. If you are lying on your back under the bus looking up,
these are my measurements:</font></p>
<ul>
<li><font size="+1">Hole 1: 3 1/4" away (to the left) from the
passenger frame rail, and 4 1/2" up from the front edge (going
towards the back of the bus)</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Bolt Hole 2: 6 5/8" away from the frame rail
and 3 1/2" up. This puts your blower on an angle, with the motor
towards the front of the bus.</font></li>
</ul>
<font size="+1">When it came time to actually mount the blower to
the floorpan, I used rubber washers on either side of the pan,
sandwiched them with metal washers, then the nuts and bolts. This
really cuts down on motor vibration (= noise).</font>
<p><font size="+1">To splice into the duct, I used a saber saw and
cut the tube, leaving about 3" hanging down on the front tube
(closest to the front of the bus), and about 5" on the tube that
comes from the back. Before I mounted the blower, I capped the
right side blower outlet closest to the passenger frame rail. I
used a 2" PVC cap from the plumbing store and glued/duct taped it
on.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Once the blower was mounted, I used some
flexible aluminium tubing to connect the blower to the system. I
connected the rear heater tube to the blower air inlet (the
squirrel cage) with 3" tubing, a hose clamp, and duct taped it.
This way, the blower is sucking the hot air from the back blower
and increasing the velocity (volume) of the air entering the bus.
The left blower outlet is connected to the front tube the same way
(hose clamps and duct tape).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">As for the wiring, I ran a wire (12 G - I
think), from the back blower power feed (red/black?) to the same
spot on the front blower. That way, when the back blower comes on,
the front one comes on, too. (I spliced an in-line fuse in this
circuit to protect the front blower). Now if you want, you can run
the power feed to the front blower through a 3-way switch so you
can control the speed of the front blower. Make sure the switch is
a heavy duty sort or your switch will melt. The other wire from the
blower (brown) is the ground and I just mounted it to the frame
with a screw.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I have had this set-up for more than three years
with no problems (well maybe one - sometimes too much
heat!!!!)<br></font></p>
