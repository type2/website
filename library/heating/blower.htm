<h3>Using a Blower Motor to get Heat to the Front of Your Bus

I took a blower and its mounting bracket out of a another late model bus (a '73
maybe, looked like mine (two outlets)). I then figured out where under the
front floorpan I needed to mount the blower.  If you're in the bus, it's on
the passenger side floor pan, to the right of the emergency brake lever.
If you are lying on your back under the bus looking up, these are my
measurements:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Hole 1:  3 1/4" away (to the left) from the passenger frame
rail, and 4 1/2" up from the front edge (going towards the back of the bus)
<P>
<LI>Bolt Hole 2: 6 5/8" away from the frame rail and 3 1/2" up. This puts your
blower on an angle, with the motor towards the front of the bus. 
</UL>
When it came time to actually mount the blower to the floorpan, I used rubber
washers on either side of the pan, sandwiched them with metal washers, then
the nuts and bolts. This really cuts down on motor vibration (= noise).
<p>
To splice into the duct, I used a saber saw and cut the tube,
leaving about 3" hanging down on the front tube (closest to the front of the
bus), and about 5" on the tube that comes from the back.  Before I mounted
the blower, I capped the right side blower outlet closest to the passenger
frame rail.  I used a 2" PVC cap from the plumbing store and glued/duct taped
it on.
<p>
Once the blower was mounted, I used some flexible aluminium tubing
to connect the blower to the system. I connected the rear heater tube to the
blower air inlet (the squirrel cage) with 3" tubing, a hose clamp, and duct
taped it. This way, the blower is sucking the hot air from the back blower
and increasing the velocity (volume) of the air entering the bus. The left
blower outlet is connected to the front tube the same way (hose clamps and
duct tape). 
<p>
As for the wiring, I ran a wire (12 G - I think),  from the back
blower power feed (red/black?) to the same spot on the front blower. That
way, when the back blower comes on, the front one comes on, too. (I spliced
an in-line fuse in this circuit to protect the front blower). Now if you
want, you can run the power feed to the front blower through a 3-way switch
so you can control the speed of the front blower. Make sure the switch is a
heavy duty sort or your switch will melt. The other wire from the blower
(brown) is the ground and I just mounted it to the frame with a screw.
<p>
I have had this set-up for more than three years with no
problems (well maybe one - sometimes too much heat!!!!)
