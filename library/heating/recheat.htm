<h3>'72-'79 Bus Recirculating Air Modification for More Heat</h3>

<p><font size="+1">RESTORING THE STOCK SYSTEM</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">First things first, the stock system must be
made to be 100% airtight and restored to "new" condition. The buses
featuring steel main pipes likely won't be at this point, but even
those with the double layer foil paper pipes are likely to have the
Y at the rear, and more importantly the distribution box under the
midsection, rusted out. Your choices here are ones of ingenuity,
the Y is tack welded to the crossmember on each side and riveted
under the rear seat in 2 locations, the distribution box is tacked
to the crossmember on each side. There are plenty of warm climate
buses who still have these in good shape, if you can find one you
are lucky.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I note now that to really see how bad they are
you have to peel back the insulation, which is likely causing them
to rust out anyway as it holds moisture and salt, but it may also
be asbestos. There isn't an iota of the asbestos you will be
exposed to. The bulk of the asbestos from the flex tubes, flex tube
seals, and particularly the insulating mats on the bottom of some
exchangers, should it become liberated, would end up residing in
the corrugations of the main and distribution tubes. This residue,
along with road dust, is probably the bulk of what some people
notice builds up in these tubes. This you can clean out. Take
precautions as you see fit.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">So your Y and your distribution box are rusted
out? Your options: find replacements or ingenuity. As mentioned,
the air directly out of exchangers is HOT, but I did use a plastic
Y at that time to replace just the tip of the Y section. It was a
modified piece from the front distribution ducts of a bus,
connected with flexible tubing. McMaster-Carr sells a Y adapter
(5398k19 old pn) for car garage exhaust that is 2-2.5" and 2.5-3"
out, made of cast aluminum for $20 that would work nicely. They
also sell a number of fiberglass, silicone impregnated, wire coil
hoses that are good to 550F or above which I have used extensively
in direct contact with exchangers and exhaust components to replace
missing parts on Vanagon systems. It's good stuff, but costs
$6-$10/ft, so you need to plan carefully.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">You manifold distribution box choices are: If
they are really bad, one solution (if you can't find a replacment)
is to pipe it straight ahead with tin pipe and forget the rear. If
your box isn't too bad, weld patches. Check the condition of all
these parts, disassemble them and blow out all the hoses. I'm a bit
leery here, not for asbestos but because it is very hard to get the
paper off without destroying the ends and the bent pieces for the
rear are very fragile and apt to split. There are NO good
replacements for these pieces that are inexpensive. Nothing I've
found in the aftermarket is insulated like the factory parts so
make your decisions. If my manifold and Y were solid and all the
joints look tight, I wouldn't touch a thing.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">We must also be sure that both exchangers,
flapper valves, and flex pipes are solid and that all the joints
between all the pieces are tight. These are NEVER put back together
right by casual mechanics. The thing I hate the most about air
cooled vans is dealing with the heater stuff when installing an
engine. It can take HOURS to get everything to fit right on a
'73-'83 vintage van! The aftermarket (Dansk) boxes never fit well
to all the little connector pipes and the pipes are usually rusted.
The front joints from heater box to riser pipe are particularly
bad, especially if they are the oval (not round) type. They differ
by year and exhaust.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The rear joint where heater box meets the
fanshroud should have 1 way flapper valves and should be gasketed
with molded asbestos gaskets. Those gaskets are impossible to keep
intact and are usually gone. I'm pretty sure they're no longer
available. Just using silicone at that joint doesn't help because
the gasket spaces things and makes the flappers work. In it's
place, I use a 3M product putty that is made to firestop conduit
passages through walls etc. 1/8" silicone rubber sheet would work
nicely since the input end of the exchanger isn't likely so hot.
For the other joints on the front of the exchanger, the exchanger
to flapper risers, etc, use high temp silicone. Use hose clamps or
restoration of the origional welded on clamps to make all those
joints PERFECT.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">OEM (original equipment manufacturer) bus
flapper boxes have asbestos seals, replacement boxes lack the
seals. Vanagon boxes have silicone rubber seals, but they aren't
compatible with buses. You want that flapper not to leak when it is
in the heat forward position blocking the vent, so repair as
necessary. The seals to the flex tubes on the bus are asbestos, the
Vanagon has silicone rubber (red or black). These do fit buses (the
ones off the straight tube of Vanagons) and are a great thing to
buy or scrounge in a yard. Beyond not being asbestos they simply
work 100% better and are easier to get together and seal perfectly.
You will have to deal with and remove the old ones. Take
precautions as you see fit.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Cables are about the only thing left in the
stock system. They have to work or you can just wire the flappers
open to the cable brackets (though cables are still available and
fairly cheap, ~$15). You can get some adjustment out of your
existing ones (they tend to stretch) if you can get the barrel nuts
apart and working. Replacing these and coating everything with
antiseize on reinstallation is a must. Now is a good time to remove
and repack your CV joints. Access to this entire area is greatly
improved by the removal of the axles. If you are cheap and
ingenious you can cut the end off a stretched cable and fabricate a
crimped end on, or use one of those accelerator cable repair kits
to shorten the cable.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Now your original system should be solid all the
way from booster fan to front vents and leak free. The cable system
shoulc fully open the flappers (disable the cable that ducts to the
rear if you remove manifold box.) The bus should now heat better
than it ever did. With one or 2 occupants it might be liveable on a
good trip down to about a 30-40 F day. It might give you around 50F
inside at the front and keep the windshield clean under those
conditions.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I was driving alone every day 70 miles 2 ways in
subfreezing weather. The temp rise in the front vents with the
system in this restored shape under these conditions was somewhere
like 15-20F above ambient in the vent (not in the cab). With one
person in the bus I had to layer very heavy clothes, coat, gloves,
and a clear windshield was not a given and I probably was
hypothermic when I got to work. Adding a recirculating system helps
overcome this problem.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">RECIRCULATION</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">On the stock electric fan there is just enough
of a lip on the intake to attach a close fitting piece of hose. I
don't think bug/bus hose is big enough, so I used air intake hose
from the parts store. I glued it on with silicone and attached with
the narrow German style hose clamp or band clamp. It will stay if
not disturbed since there is likely a slight negative pressure in
the fan suction. Now you must direct this air and to accomplish
that, you *must* cut a hole in your bus. You want air out of the
interior to recirculate, ideally from low in the rear which is
perfectly where the coldest interior air (but still warmer than
outside) will be.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">On my '76 bus, the solution was as
follows:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I had a bunch of scrap front air vents out of
front dashes and the vents that on a passenger bus are fed by the
tubes on the front doors. This little plastic vent looks nice and
fits into a little aluminum collar that snaps though sheet metal. I
carefully used an appropriate hole saw to cut a hole on the right
rear interior pillar for the vent. BUT the gas filler is back
there, and the overflow system and gravity locks and whatnot are
back there (i.e. lots of gas available to drill into, be carefull
when choosing a location).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Now the size of the fan intake and this vent
thing weren't the same, so I fabbed a little aluminum reducer for
the vent to get down to the hose size and plumbed it all together
using silicone at the joint though the sheet metal. I removed the
flapper from the plastic part of the vent (snaps out), cut a neat
hole in the black trim panel and snapped the vent though into its
housing. It all looked quite nice and basically stock. It occurs to
me on a Westfalia you could probably use the stock rear underseat
vent plumbed elaborately up through the tin somewhere, however, you
would lose a lot of heat from the air you were pulling. Likewise
you could take route similar to an engine compartment mounted
gasoline heater output vent (though the firewall beside the gas
tank and out under the rear seat), but that is pretty involved with
the engine in situ. Up on the pillar seems to be the best option.
The floor of the luggage compartment is possible, but then it gets
covered up.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Benefits: On the 70 mile daily trip, temps were
raised quite a bit as the trip went on. I think that I was looking
about 30 minutes into the trip at heat 30+F higher than ambient
coming out the vents, but results may have been better. This bus
also featured a nice 1" layer of fiberglass insulation above the
headliner and similar behind all door panels, another real
important element in heating a bus. I do know I could then
comfortably drive on a 15-20F day without my heavy coat and heavy
gloves and have a nice clear windshield at all times and not die on
a hour and a half trip.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">For '68-'71 buses your solution is quite simple:
buy one of those bug recirculating air kits and plumb them with
seperate fans for each side into the interior. For Vanagons without
the electric fan but with the alternator mounted fan this should be
possible as well. Just plumb into the intake of the alternator
fan.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The funny thing about all of this is that my '76
bus handled so much better in the snow compared to my '85 Vanagon
that I preferred to drive it without heat. A bus is really
predictable and "tossable" in the snow, a Vanagon is sort of
lethargic and unpredictable. I often plowed along though 12+ inches
of uncleared interstate in the morning and would never think twice
about hopping into the rutty passing lane to blow pass slow moving
vehicles. Good tires and a sensible driver behind the wheel can go
anywhere.</font></p>
