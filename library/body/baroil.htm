<h3>Bar Oil Undercoating</h3>
<p>by Don Martin</p>
<hr size="2">
<p><font size="+1">Here's my Vermont two cents worth on
undercoating:</font></p>
<ul>
<li><font size="+1">Spray on rubberized coatings tend to cover the
rust and do nothing to kill it. Over time it will chip or peel and
end up trapping salt and making your bus rust faster than if it had
not been undercoated!</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">The best thing some of us up here have found is
quality bar and chain oil. Do not get the cheap stuff. Agway or
Husquarvarna seem to both use similar formulas. That is a mixture
of phosphoric acid, oil, and paraffin. The phosphoric kills the
rust. In fact the rust will turn black within a week. The oil and
wax leave behind a sticky residue. This treatment also has the
advantage of lubricating all joints, etc...</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">When looking to buy bar and chain oil, READ THE
LABEL. Although it won't give you the ingredients, it should say
something like: High adhesiveness, high oiliness, High Film
Strength, Anti-Rust.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">The best way we have found to apply the bar and
chain oil is with a 3M Rocker Schutz gun and an air compressor at
about 50-60 PSI. Atomizing the oil helps to make this a quick job
as well as makes it possible to spray into doors, rockers,
etc.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">This stuff will evaporate/dry to some extent
and leave a thin film behind.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">I do my cars twice a year. In the fall, and
also in the spring.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">It's a good idea to pressure wash your ride and
let it dry before undercoating. Spraying the oil on top of mud
won't do much good...</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">I spray all sheet metal, joints etc underneath,
and also spray in the rocker panels, doors, etc.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Would you rather have salt water or oil in them
door seams ? Remember you'll be splashing up slush that seems to
get inside all seams (this salt mix is not nice !)</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Unlike the rubberized stuff that does nothing
to kill rust, you get a chemical reaction from the bar oil with the
metal which forms a protective oxide.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">This treatment is for cars driven daily in the
rust belt.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Considering the cost ($5 a gallon) this is
economical. If you are judicious in applying this stuff, one gallon
is all you need.</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font size="+1">CAVEAT:<br>
BE CAREFUL WITH ANY UNDERCOATING YOU APPLY.<br>
DO NOT SPRAY IT ON THE EXHAUST OR ENGINE !<br>
GIVE IT TIME TO "DRIP DRY".<br>
YOU DON'T WANT A BURNIN' BUS.<br></font></p>
