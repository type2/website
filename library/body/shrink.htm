<h3>Shrinking Metal</h3>
<p>by Roland Wilhelmy</p>
<hr size="2">
<blockquote><font size="+1"><i>"I'm doing some body work and have a
stretched area of metal. I understand that to shrink the metal, you
heat it up to a dull red glow, then quench it with cold water
soaked rags. Repeat as necessary.</i></font>
<p><font size="+1"><i>I have heated and quenched it a few times and
can tell very little difference. Do I just keep on? How much can it
change?</i></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><i>I would think the heating would expand it,
the cooling would shrink it, but how could it shrink it back
enough?"</i></font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">What I am going to say is based on my
experience. Your experience may be different. If you want to make
steel hard and even brittle, just heat it red hot and quench it
with water or a blast of compressed air. In the process you may get
some shrinkage, too.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">If what you want to do is shrink some sheet
metal you need to identify the stretched spots and shrink them. If
there is a larger area, then you have to shrink it one small spot
at a time. You can cold shrink or hot shrink. Hot shrinking
involves heating a small area gently and tapping it with a hammer
against a block of wood (not metal) or just letting it cool slowly.
The shrinking occurs when the spot gets hot and wants to swell but
the metal around it holds it in place, so that spot gets thicker.
Or it bows out, which is why tapping it down carefully and very
gently with a hammer helps keep it in line and thickening.
Stretching metal makes it thinner. Shrinking it makes it thicker.
You can cold shrink, but it is easier on edges where you can gather
some metal into a "pucker" and then hammer it into itself. Again
you use a metal hammer and a wooden dolly or vice versa. It helps
if you hold good thoughts in your mind while you do this
;-).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">If you want to see a video of how it is done,
you can order one titled "Shrinking Magic" by Kent White (aka the
Tin Man). If you're serious about body metal work he is one guy you
need to know about.</font></p>
