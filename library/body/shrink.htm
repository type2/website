"I'm doing some body work and have a 
stretched area of metal.  I understand that 
to shrink the metal, you heat it up to a dull 
red glow, then quench it with cold water soaked 
rags.  Repeat as necessary.
<p>
I have heated and quenched it a few times and 
can tell very little difference.  Do I just keep 
on?  How much can it change?
<p>
I would think the heating would expand it, the 
cooling would shrink it, but how could it shrink 
it back enough?"

What I am going to say is based on my experience.  Your experience may
be different.  If you want to make steel hard and even brittle, just
heat it red hot and quench it with water or a blast of compressed air.
In the process you may get some shrinkage, too.
<p> 
If what you want to do is shrink some sheet metal you need to identify
the stretched spots and shrink them.  If there is a larger area, then
you have to shrink it one small spot at a time.  You can cold shrink
or hot shrink.  Hot shrinking involves heating a small area gently and
tapping it with a hammer against a block of wood (not metal) or just
letting it cool slowly.  The shrinking occurs when the spot gets hot
and wants to swell but the metal around it holds it in place, so that
spot gets thicker.  Or it bows out, which is why tapping it down
carefully and very gently with a hammer helps keep it in line and
thickening.  Stretching metal makes it thinner.  Shrinking it makes it
thicker.  You can cold shrink, but it is easier on edges where you can
gather some metal into a "pucker" and then hammer it into itself.
Again you use a metal hammer and a wooden dolly or vice versa.  It
helps if you hold good thoughts in your mind while you do this ;-).

If you want to see a video of how it is done, you can order  one
titled "Shrinking Magic" by Kent White (aka the Tin Man).  If you're
serious about body metal work he is one guy you need to know about.

The usual disclaimers apply to Shrinking Magic.  I bought a copy and
like it.  I learned a lot of stuff from it.  That's all.
