<h3>Primer and Paints Explained</h3>

<blockquote><font size="+1"><i>"When do you *have* to sand down to
bare metal, when do you *need* to sand down to bare metal, when is
it *nice* to sand down to bare metal, and when is it *unnecessary*
to sand down to bare metal?"</i></font></blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Sanding to metal is only necessary when you are
going to apply plastic body filler (bondo). Plastic wont stick to
paint. Normally, though, when a person sands an area to metal, the
paint around the area is higher than the metal and when painted
appears as a dent. So, to remove all the paint in an area of repair
gives better results. <b>"Feather edging"</b> is a term meaning to
sand old paint in a much larger area around a place that was sanded
to metal in order to cut down on the taper from the high area of
the unsanded old paint to the low are of the bare metal. Also,
primer can be used to fill in low areas of bare metal up to the
heighth of existing paint. To do this you just spray an entire area
(old paint and area sanded to bare metal) with primer and then wet
sand or block sand until the old paint shows thru. This process
"builds up" your low area.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>"Wet sanding"</b> refers to sanding with your
specially designed sandpaper wrapped around a skinny sponge with
water running on your sanding area to clean away paint/primer from
the area you are sanding.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>"Block sanding"</b> means putting a hard flat
structure behind sand paper...I use paint paddlesticks or small
blocks of wood.</font></p>
<blockquote><font size="+1"><i>"I've seen a fair amount of info on
paint quality, but little on primer quality. What should I look for
in a primer? Is it basically the same things I should find in a
good paint? What about clearcoating?"</i></font></blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">On primer, it is pretty safe to go with you pay
for what you get. But, DO make sure it says that it is a "Sandable"
type primer. If not, it is little more than a flat paint and makes
for some nasty, scratchy finish work. As far as colors of primer,
the usual rule of thumb is to use "gray" for light colored (white,
light blue) finish coats and "red" for dark (black,
maroon).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Primer is designed for two things. One is to
fill low spots...like scratches and feather-edged areas. It is also
used while a project is "under construction" to keep rust from
forming until a finish can be applied. True, paint will not stick
to bare metal, so primer is most commonly used to make bare metal
"porous" enough for paint to stick to it, but it should not be the
only finish used before final finish coats. For a durable, long
lasting finish, a product called "sealer" (like primer but less
powdery) is used on top of wet sanded primer to make sure all metal
is covered and ensure a strong bond to your finish layer of paint.
Primer is considered an acceptable sealer for small panels and
touch up jobs, though.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><u>Paint Types:</u></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">There are basically two main types of paint:
Single stage and Two-stage. Single stage paints have the glossy
clear actually mixed into the paint and can be applied with "color
and gloss", if you will, in one stage. Single stage paints include
"Acrylic Enamel (most common), Acrylic Lacquer, and Synthetic
Enamel". These types of paint were most commonly used in automotive
purposes up until the early '80's until the release of two stage
paints. Two stage paints are commonly referred to as "base-coat /
clearcoat". Naturally, your first-stage is to spray a flat color
coat, then spray your gloss on as the second stage.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Two-stage paints give you more control on how
"glossy" your finish is and are a bit more durable than standard
single stage. The down-side is that they are a bit more expensive
than standard single stage paint. I would estimate $100-$150 for a
complete single stage paint compared to $150-$250 for two-stage.
Now, that is "man off the street" pricing. If you know someone that
works at an autobody place, have them order it for you. They can
get it a lot cheaper plus the person mixing your paint cares more
for "their" repeat business. Autobody places get a better price
from paint stores for the more they buy in a year, so it is better
for them, too.</font></p>
