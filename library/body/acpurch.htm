<h3>Air Compressor Purchase</h3>

<p><font size="+1"><u>SIZE OF COMPRESSOR:</u></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The main issue seems to be down-time, the time
you have to wait for the compressor to catch its breath. "The
smaller the tank and the smaller the compressor, the longer the
rest period," says Unca' Joel. "You CAN do all the wonderful things
with it, but it'll just take longer." A suggestion that makes good
sense is to look at air tools you want and see if the amount of air
they use are less or exceed the output of the air compressor you
want. The number you want to look at is the CFM at 90 PSI. A sand
blaster will always exceed the cfm rating so you'll have to stop
and wait every couple of minutes. The hp ratings of the compressors
is important but can be overrated.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">A specific recommendation was to get at the
*very least*, a five horse single stroke with a sixty gallon tank,
which should be very common -- just short of $500. A common theme
to all the replies was that I should not try to save money by
buying cheap tools and equipment. In the long run it is more costly
by far.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><u>OILESS?</u></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">A waste of money. The service life on the oiless
is supposed to be a quarter of the iron pumps. One reply said: "I
have a SEARS compressor that I have had to replace the "piston and
cylinder" assembly several times. Be sure that you look at the
parts book and then look at the cheap construction the piston is a
flat top with a teflon ring around it.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><u>240V?</u></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"Don't be afraid of 240 v systems." The only
problem with them is that they are not as "portable" as the 120volt
jobs. It is a snap to wire a 240v box. You need to run a line. This
requires two phases of your power and a ground. You need to get
heavy enough 3-wire cable (6 or 8 gauge) for the amperage of the
plug and device you are plugging in. But be SURE that you have TWO
circuit breakers ... otherwise you'll keep popping the breaker when
the compressor motor cuts in.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><u>ACCESSORIES/CUTTING?</u></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"Use rubber air line (don't use that coiled
plastic stuff, it's garbage)"</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"I've cut up some Westies and found the tools of
choice to be the cutter (it cuts with a nice curl of metal taken
out, very quick if you have a start hole or edge......and the disk
grinder, which takes disks about 3" in diameter and lets you get in
wierd places to grind/cut metal. Another tool of choice if you have
a clear space behind the metal is the electric sawzall, fitted with
a hacksaw blade; I've found the "bimetal" blades they sell to
outlast by 10 times the regular blades!"</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"There is an air tool called a "nibbler" that
"bites" little chunks of metal as you move it along. check with the
Sears catalog or Eastwood. it works in very confined spaces and
doesn't take away too much metal. air chisel can get away from you
pretty quickly, but will do the job. Buy a nibbler and/or a die
grinder and cutoff wheel. Both can be found at Tractor Supply
Company or Sears I suppose (I don't show at Sears
much)."</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><a href=
"http://www.aircraft-spruce.com/">Aircraft Spruce &amp; Specialty
Co.</a> is one possible source for tools. They sell home-built
aircraft supplies. On page 388 of their current catalogue you will
find a tool called the 'Adel Hand nibbling tool' which is only
$14.95. I am a retired aircraft sheet metal mech. and can recommend
this tool for light sheetmetal work. It leaves a clean, straight
cut (as straight as you can cut). The part number is 12-10400."
This is HAND operated, like a pair of pliers, but they have air
powered nibbling tools as well.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><u>WHERE TO BUY?</u></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">A couple people got their equipment at Home
Depot, another said that Harbor Freight was the best deal he found
when he was looking. Also, "if you live near a fair size town you
will generally find a shop that specializes in compressors,tools,
etc. Check these places out and you can find good used gear at good
prices."</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I'm also told that "For the same $400, you can
get a 6.5HP 60 Gallon _OIL_ compressor from Sears. Upright unit,
great for a garage. It think it is $440 ... the stores don't seem
to always have these, but they sell them. Sears has a 10% off
store-wide sale coming up soon... (call them and ask)."</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Another listee purchased a 6.0 HP 60 Gallon
_OIL_ compressor from Campbell Hausfeld for $397.00 at Home
Depot.</font></p>
