<h3>Painting 101</h3>

<p><font size="+1">For starts, be very carefull about the
*pressure* you are pushing through the gun. Use the *lowest*
pressure possible that will allow the material (paint) to blow
well. This sounds subjective because it is. You have to find the
best setup for your equipment, but don't crank up the pressure
thinking it will flow better, you just get flooding! Likewise, with
the paint control on the gun, crank it down to get a nice circular
pattern. On my setup I like the pressure to stay around 14psi
<b>with the trigger down</b>.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">What you want is a wet mist, <b>not</b> a sheet
of liquid paint. Assuming you are pushing Urethane Enamel, the mix
the supplier specified is about right--you <b>want</b> the stuff to
run like water. The control of the paint film comes from the
manipulation of the gun, not the viscosity of the paint.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Back off!</b> Stay 18-24 in. away, try to
stay parallel to the surface.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Work from the top down and the edges of a panel
in. I work 4-5 sq ft then move on. You don`t need to try and get
the whole side of the van in one shot, what you *do* need to do is
to KEEP A WET EDGE. This is the forward edge of the painted area
and should have a *wet* sheen or reflection to it (arrange the
lights so you can see it). This means the paint is flowing
together.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The maintanance of this edge without flooding
the surface is the hardest thing to control, but when you get it
you`ll paint like a pro. It is a "feel" as much as anything and you
WILL mess up till you get it.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">When you get a run: <b>STOP</b>. Have
rags/solvent ready and wipe it off. There is no reason to do all
that sanding. If you have allowed the runs to cure, then you have
to sand them down. This can be a problem with uncured paint as it
will gum your paper as fast as you can change it. You can also use
a "paint file" (a weird little tool-from your paint supply store)
to cut the runs out. No matter what, you must take the surface back
to <b>perfect</b> to try again. :-[</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The best thing is to practice on an old panel
until you get the control thing down. Relax: air painting is a Zen
thing, when everything comes together it flows out real nice, but
get hurried and frustrated and it will TTS. Stick with
it.<br></font></p>
