<h3>Body Prep and Paint</h3>
<p>by Gerald Carter</p>

<p><font size="+1">My experience with sandblasting is that it's
very messy and slow. To me, the best use for sandblasting is to
clean up rusted and pitted areas. Believe me, sand gets everywhere
and is hard to clean out of recesses and hidden pockets.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">If it were me, I would sandblast the rusted
areas, clean, and prime. For the rest, sand the paint down with a
DA sander and 80 grit paper. You don't have to go to the metal as
long as the underlying paint or primer is not cracked. Sanding will
reveal high and low areas of the body panel that need attention,
ie, bare metal will show up on high areas and paint will be left on
the low areas. You can then tap down the high areas with a pick
hammer and pull and fill the low areas.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Work these areas with a flat sanding board and
80 grit paper. When they are close to what you want, prime with a
good primer such as Dupont's Variprime or PPG's DP40 or
DP80.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Then, begin applying several coats of filler
primer. I prefer Dupont's Uro Prime. Then you can begin sanding
with a flat sanding board and 120 grit paper. Before sanding, get a
can of flat black spray paint and lightly dust the whole Bus with
black paint. As you sand, the black specks will be removed from
high areas and left in the low ones. You can then continue to work
these areas with a pick hammer and glazing compound (a very smooth
type of plastic body filler) until you are satisfied.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Apply three or more heavy coats of filler primer
and then begin to wet sand with 400 or 500 grit wet or dry paper
and a block or flat sanding board. While wet sanding, I dry the
area I'm working on often and keep a drop light in front of me. As
the wet sanding makes the filler primer shiney, the light will
reveal minor imperfections.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Depending on how good of a final paint job you
want, keep working with filler primer and wet sanding until you are
satisfied. Your shiney new coat of finish paint will reveal high
and low spots you never thought were present.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">A really good paint job is achieved in the
preparation. I know now why good body shops are expensive, it takes
a lot of hand labor to get good results. Its hard work, but well
worth it when your done.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Another list member writes:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">My body/paint guy has access to cross references
of all original VW colors in either Dupont paint or PPG paint, I'm
not sure. I do know that BASF carries a line called Glasurit, which
has a "21 Line" that supposedly contains almost all original VW
colors. Their phone number is (800)825-3000 and they can tell you
where the closet dealer is to you. I was originally going to go
that route until I realized my paint guy had the color chips
himself for *modern day* paint.</font></p>
