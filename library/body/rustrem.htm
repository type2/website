<h3>Rust Removal</h3>
<p>by Brian Verbeek</p>
<hr size="2">
<p><font size="+1">I'm looking into easy to use do-it-yourself
chemical treatments and this is what I learned about chemically
derusting and preparing metal for further treatment:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Phosphoric acid: It costs about $2.50us per Kilo
(20 liters is about 31.5 Kilo). It can be thinned with water (I
don't know the best ratio). It works best unthinned, but then you
must keep watching the process as it eats metal. This is called
"phosphating". VW does (or did?) it with most steel parts before
they were painted--it gives an iron-phosphate coat on the part and,
unlike galvanizing, it reaches all holes and crevices. It's a good
thing to do to any steel part that will not receive any other
treatment before paint or primer. Phosphating will disturb the
galvanizing process--it gives marginal corrosion protection
compared to galvanizing. Visible phosphating can be found on
computer chassis, the flat gray metal color finish. A slightly
better corrosion protection can be had by using a special
phosphoric acid that contains zinc. The process is then called
"zinc-phosphating".</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">If you want to remove the rust, or only clean
the parts prior to galvanizing or any other electroplating, use
sulphuric acid (I hope that's the correct translation, we call it
salt acid) which does not leave a residue. Both phosphoric acid and
sulphuric acid will remove a lot more than a regular solvent you'd
use to degrease a part prior to painting. The risk of rust will be
reduced by a lot.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Both treatments are very simple to do. Just take
a suitable container or bucket fill it enough so you can emerge the
part in the stuff and see how it goes. Both chemicals will not
strip paint so you'd need to do that first. Don't put an alloy part
in there of course :) and, needless to say, these are very
corrosive chemicals, very nasty stuff. If you have a safe place to
keep them you can use them over and over, but I wouldn't know when
it's used up. In my humble opinion, phosphating is a lot better
than sand blasting. Sand blasting increases the surface area (and
thus the risk of rust) by a high (I forgot how high) percentage and
it cannot crawl into a folded seam or weld.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I think it'll become problematic to use this
process with the fanshroud. I'll look for a company that can dip it
into something. I got a tip from my galvanizer. I asked what he
would prefer me to use on the bare metal to prevent rust and if he
had problems if I used motor oil. "No," he said, "if you're
stripping the paint you must rinse with a lot of water. After that
you fill the sink with water and a little dishwashing soap (a
little more than you use for dishwashing). Wash the part again and
let it dry. The soap residue is enough to protect against quick
rust, and it removes real easy." The galvanizer can emerge it in
sulphuric acid as he always does and the soap is
gone.<br></font></p>
