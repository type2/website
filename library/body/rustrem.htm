<h3>Rust Removal

I'm looking into easy to use do-it-yourself chemical treatments and this is what 
I learned about chemically derusting and preparing metal for further treatment:
<p>

Phosphoric acid: 

It costs about $2.50us per Kilo (20 liters is about 31.5 Kilo).  It can be thinned 
with water (I don't know the best ratio).  It works best unthinned, but then you must 
keep watching the process as it eats metal.  This is called "phosphating".
VW does (or did?) it with most steel parts  before they were painted--it 
gives an iron-phosphate coat on the part and,  unlike galvanizing, 
it reaches all holes and crevices. It's a good thing  to do to any steel part 
that will not receive any other treatment before  paint or primer. Phosphating 
will disturb the galvanizing process--it  gives marginal corrosion protection 
compared to galvanizing.  Visible phosphating can be found on computer chassis, 
the flat gray metal color finish. A slightly better corrosion protection can be 
had by using a special phosphoric acid that contains zinc.  The process is then 
called "zinc-phosphating".
<p>

If you want to remove the rust, or only clean the parts prior to 
galvanizing or any other electroplating, use sulphuric acid (I hope 
that's the correct translation, we call it salt acid) which does not 
leave a residue. Both phosphoric acid and sulphuric acid will remove 
a lot more than a regular solvent you'd use to degrease a part prior 
to painting. The risk of rust will be reduced by a lot.
<p>

Both treatments are very simple to do.  Just take a suitable container
or bucket fill it enough so you can emerge the part in the stuff and
see how it goes. Both chemicals will not strip paint so you'd need to
do that first. Don't put an alloy part in there of course :) and, 
needless to say, these are very corrosive chemicals, very nasty stuff. 
If you have a safe place to keep them you can use them over and over, but
I wouldn't know when it's used up.  In my humble opinion, phosphating is a lot better 
than sand blasting.  Sand blasting increases the surface area (and 
thus the risk of rust) by a high (I forgot how high) percentage and
it cannot crawl into a folded seam or weld.
<p>
I think it'll become problematic to use this process with the fanshroud.  
I'll look for a company that can dip it into something. I got a tip from my 
galvanizer. I asked what he would prefer me to use on the bare metal to prevent 
rust and if he had problems if I used motor oil.  "No," he said, 
"if you're stripping the paint you must rinse with a lot of water.  After that you  
fill the sink with water and a little dishwashing soap (a little more than you use 
for dishwashing).  Wash the part again and let it dry. The soap residue is 
enough to protect against quick rust, and it removes real easy." 
The galvanizer can emerge it in sulphuric acid as he always does and 
the soap is gone.
