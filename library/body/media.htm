blast?<br></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">For really heavy rust on frame pieces I use
#30-#60 copper slag. It will mar the metal, but the pieces I was
using it on were being cut out anyway.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">For nicer work, I use #80 garnet. I used this to
do some wheels, and it came out beautifully.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">If you're just removing paint, use medium to
fine walnut shells. I used these on a Datsun roadster, and it works
great! I can take paint off one single layer at a time with this
stuff!</font></p>
