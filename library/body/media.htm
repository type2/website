How rusty is the part you intend to blast?<br>



<p>



For really heavy rust on frame pieces I use #30-#60 copper slag.
It will mar the metal, but the pieces I was using it on were being cut out anyway.
<p>
For nicer work, I use #80 garnet.  I used this to do some wheels,
and it came out beautifully.
<p>
If you're just removing paint, use medium to fine walnut shells.  I used
these on a Datsun roadster, and it works great!  I
can take paint off one single layer at a time with this stuff!
