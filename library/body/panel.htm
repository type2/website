<p><font size="+1">I've purchased the following replacement
parts</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><font size="+1">from Das Bulli Haus:<br>
replacement bed panels</font></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><font size="+1">from Wolfsburg West:<br>
right and left outer rockers<br>
left inner rocker<br>
left rear jack point<br>
hinge carrier for engine lid</font></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><font size="+1">from BFY Obsolete:<br>
right &amp; left cargo floorpans</font></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><font size="+1">I would stay away from BFY (BFY
Obsolete Parts). The panels were o.k., but their shipping practices
leave a lot to be desired. The panels came with several of the
corners bent up because they weren't packaged right. The
replacement bed panels from DBH (Das Bulli Haus) were nice, but no
big deal. Of course we're talking basic 15" x 59" corrugated
panels, not real complicated. The rockers, hinge carrier and jack
point from WW were nice too. They were the proper length, size,
shape, quality and fit fine.</font></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><font size="+1">I always price check between WW
and DBH and usually DBH is quite a bit more expensive. Some items
are less but only by a coupla bucks. When DBH is more it is usually
by a lot, like 30% to 90% (??).</font></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><font size="+1">As far as rockers go, if in the
future I need to purchase more (for another bus of course) I'd get
mine from <a href="http://www.wolfsburgwest.com/">Wolfsburg
West.</a> They are less expensive and they ship a lot
faster.</font></font></p>
