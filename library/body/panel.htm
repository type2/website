  <p><font size="+1">I've purchased the following replacement
  parts</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1"><font size="+1">from Das Bulli Haus:<br>
  replacement bed panels</font></font></p>

  <p><font size="+1"><font size="+1">from Wolfsburg West:<br>
  right and left outer rockers<br>
  left inner rocker<br>
  left rear jack point<br>
  hinge carrier for engine lid</font></font></p>

  <p><font size="+1"><font size="+1">from BFY Obsolete:<br>
  right &amp; left cargo floorpans</font></font></p>

  <p><font size="+1"><font size="+1">I would stay away from BFY (BFY Obsolete
  Parts). The panels were o.k., but their shipping practices leave a lot to
  be desired. The panels came with several of the corners bent up because
  they weren't packaged right. The replacement bed panels from DBH (Das Bulli
  Haus) were nice, but no big deal. Of course we're talking basic 15" x 59"
  corrugated panels, not real complicated. The rockers, hinge carrier and
  jack point from WW were nice too. They were the proper length, size, shape,
  quality and fit fine.</font></font></p>

  <p><font size="+1"><font size="+1">I always price check between WW and DBH
  and usually DBH is quite a bit more expensive. Some items are less but only
  by a coupla bucks. When DBH is more it is usually by a lot, like 30% to 90%
  (??).</font></font></p>

  <p><font size="+1"><font size="+1">As far as rockers go, if in the future I
  need to purchase more (for another bus of course) I'd get mine from
  <a href="http://www.wolfsburgwest.com/">Wolfsburg West.</a> They are less
  expensive and they ship a lot faster.</font></font></p><br>
