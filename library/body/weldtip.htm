<h3>Welding Tips</h3>

<p><font size="+1">It is <b>difficult</b> for me to "stick-weld" on
thin guage sheet metal. I prefer Oxy-Acetlyene welding over the
stick. I usually end up burning holes right through the metal. Even
better is MIG (Metal Inert Gas) welding for the thin stuff. A MIG
welding tip is surrounded by a gas that displaces oxygen, and helps
cool the surrounding metal. Argon is a common gas when welding with
MIG.</font></p>
<blockquote><font size="+1"><i>"I've found this welder at Orchard
Supply for $200. It goes up to 225 Amps. It is a single phase 220 V
AC. I can hook it up to my dryer outlet. Would this do the
job?"</i></font></blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Well, it is plenty big! Overkill for sheet
metal, though!!! Does it have AC as well as DC output? DC welding
will deposit more metal from the rod while the torch is "lit", as
opposed to AC, which will burn deeper into the metal. BTW, I have
plugged my welder into the dryer outlet, but please keep in mind
that the welder will come with a 50-amp plug on it, and the dryer
is either 25 or 35 amps. You will need to make and adapter for it.
The breaker did pop whenever I tried to make long welds.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Here's a quick rule of thumb on amperage and
metal thickness. Use the same amperage as the thickness of the
metal. For example, to weld 1/4" steel, use 250 amps. (1/4"=.250",
get it?) For 1/8 inch, use 125 amps...and so on. On 18-20 ga sheet
metal, you will need to use the lowest amperage that you can still
get the torch to maintain an arc. Maybe 60 amps on a thin
rod.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Also, choose the type of rod carefully! Not only
diameter (thinner rods are for welding at low amps), but also the
properties. For example, a #6013 rod will deposit a lot of filler
material, but a #6018 will cut into the surface.</font></p>
<blockquote><font size="+1"><i>"If with stick welding you can
easily melt the metal, then how about gas
welding?"</i></font></blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Takes some practice, but that is the way the
body guys did it for years before the MIG.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">About 7 years ago, I took a welding class at a
local vocational technical program run by the county government.
Classes were at night, three nights a week. It was for six weeks,
and cost less than $200. We were taught flame, stick, MIG and
Heli-arc welding in that class. That $200 has been paid for many
times over! Before embarking on your project, I would recommend the
same!</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I concur, don't buy a stick welder!</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">You need to find a wire welder. The good ones
(Lincoln, Miller) will cost you about $700 complete but are well
worth it if you have the money. Otherwise, you should rent a small
wire welder (MIG). Mine is the Lincoln SP-100 which is a 115v
machine so it plugs in to any 15-20 amp fused outlet. It puts out
much more power than is necessary for sheet metal work.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I have tried to weld sheet metal with a stick
and it is nearly impossible. The wire welder, on the other hand,
does a very nice job. You will need some practice or instruction to
make good looking welds.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">When welding long seams put a spot at the
beginning and end and then in the middle and then successively
halve the distance between welds. That way the metal doesn't get
hot and you don't have sheet metal warpage.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I use 0.030" mild steel wire with an
argon(75%)/CO2 mixture. It works quite well. I have rebuilt the
whole left side of my '74 including making new jack supports. I
used a piece of metal that runs laterally between the supports and
up to the side support. As I recall the piece was about
18"x48".</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I put in a new seat attachment plate which I
manufactured from some 3/32" steel. I think it is a lot stronger
than the original.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">In addition I have welded in many smaller pieces
where the metal is rusted. You will need a sabre saw and a good
number of blades to cut out the "old" metal. I have a very small
aircompressor (3/4HP) with a small tank and I find that I can use
an air gun to cut the sheet metal if I am not in a hurry. It has
made the job pretty easy when the sabre saw couldn't be
used.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">You need to take care to clean both sides of the
joint to get good welds. Also, you will need to figure out how to
"clamp" the pieces together prior to welding. I use a combination
of clamps, Vise-Grips and pop rivets.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">You will need a 4" or 4 1/2" offset grinder to
smooth up the welds prior to covering with Bondo.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I have been very satisfied with the work. It is
fun to see the old van get back to as good or better than new
condition. It may be a tad heavier as 18 gauge is thicker than the
original metal.</font></p>
