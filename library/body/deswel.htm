<h3>Welding Terminology</h3>
<p>by Jeff Carver</p>
<hr size="2">
<p><font size="+1">Most of this is from the AWS (American Welding
Society), the leading authority in the US on welding. One thing
they have been trying to do is to educate people on consistent
terminology, due to common use of brand and outdated names. The AWS
is VERY tight about getting info out, unless one BUYS their
overpriced books.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b><u>Welding</u></b>: A joining process that
produces a unification of materials by heating. Can be done with or
without pressure or filler material.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">As a generic term welding includes brazing and
soldering.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">As a specific term welding means that the base
material melts along with the filler material.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b><u>Brazing</u></b>: A process of joining
materials with a filler material that melts above 450degC
(840degF), but below the melting point of the base
material.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Most common braze filler materials are is brass,
bronze, & aluminum.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b><u>Soldering</u></b>: Same as brazing, but
with a filler material below 450degC (840degF), usually using lead
or more recently tin based filler material.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Raising the temperature of metal causes it to
oxidize very rapidly. Some form of shielding is necessary to keep
the air (oxygen) from contaminating the weld. One technique is to
use an inert gas in the weld area, usually argon, CO2, helium or a
mixture, depending on particulars of the weld itself. Using flux is
another technique that uses a solid, paste or powdered material
that melts at a lower temperature and physically and chemically
protects the weld. Flux usually hardens after cooling off and needs
to be chipped, ground, chemically, etc removed. But usually cheaper
that gas shielding.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Since heat leads to oxidization (rust), if at
all possible, gain access to the backside of welds and clean them
up and protect for rusting by paint or other coating.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">And now on to some welding processes:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b><u>GMAW</u></b> = Gas Metal Arc Welding, aka
MIG (old term) Solid metal weld material. Arc created between the
filler metal and the work. Filler metal usually on a coil. Gas
shielding for the welding. Usually a point and shoot type of
welder. Well suited for thin sections, most popular for body work.
Gas costs can be high. Easy to use.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b><u>FCAW</u></b> = Flux Cored Arc Welding, a
metal tube with flux in the center, the metal being the weld
material, the electric arc being made between the metal tube and
the work. Usually this wire is supplied as a coil. Very easy to
weld, point and shoot. Difficult to control for thin
metal.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Cleanup of flux is necessary after welding.
Works well in difficult orientations and in difficult weather
conditions (Flux protects weld, as gas would get blown
away)</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b><u>SMAW</u></b> = Shielded Metal Arc Weld,
aka stick welding. A solid metal rod with flux on the outside
surface. Well suited to large welds, weld suited to field repairs.
A VERY good welder can do thinner materials. Can actually be done
using a car battery (not while running though). Weld rods are
relatively short, not on a coil.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b><u>GTAW</u></b> = Gas Tungsten Arc Welding,
aka TIG (old term), or Heliarc (brand). Weld arc created between
tungsten handpiece (torch) and work. Filler metal added in using
other hand. Gas shielding from torch.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Can weld VERY thin material (Have seen soda pop
cans welded with this process). Slow process, very precise as
welder has complete control of welding. Slow learning curve. Filler
material usually 36in long.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Flux core and MIG are separate and different
processes. Apparently one can get a GMAW machine and use FCAW wire
in it without the gas shielding. Sounds logical, but recognize the
differences.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">As for which rod to use with which base metal,
for the particular machine and at what settings, ask at your local
supplier.<br></font></p>
