<h3>Bulkhead (Panel Behind Front Seats) Removal</h3>
<h3>by Bob Wallace</h3>
<hr size="2">
<blockquote><font size="+1"><i>More of concern with this conversion
is the absence of the bulkheads (dividers) behind driver's and
passenger's seats. In place of these I found triangular braces (3"
- 4") welded at floor level behind the seats. Original or
converted? Good thing or bad? I get a nice warm feeling
reading/hearing about how VW designers over-engineered the
structure of the bus. I get nervous thinking that a converter or
PPO thought they knew more than VW.</i></font></blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">The removal of the bulkheads is a modification
desired by many people to enable the fitting of rotating seats
which would make the cab seats usable while camping and giving a
larger usable space in the rear; and is very effective.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">For the 78 and 79 (or maybe just 79) model years
VW did produce T2s without bulkheads but only in Deluxe minibuses;
the strengthening which replaced the bulkhead was an L shaped
bracket 250mm long on each leg, 20mm wide and 8mm thick at the
corner tapering to 4mm thick at the ends. This bracket goes up the
door pillar and out across the rear upper edge of the seat
pedestal. NB dimensions are approximate and are from memory of a
friends bus.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Because there were T2 busses made by VW without
bulkheads the VW Type 2 Owners Club contacted VW about the removal
of bulkheads and received a written reply that this did not affect
the structural integrity of the vehicle PROVIDED that a
strengthening bracket is used in its place.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">So from the arrangement you describe (and the
vehicles age) I would think that think that the bulkhead removal
has been done by a previous owner or converter.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">You yourself must judge if the strengthening and
workmanship used in removing the bulkheads is adequate.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">To help you with this VW themselves still
produce T2 busses in Brazil and these come off the production line
WITHOUT bulkheads neither do they have the late 70s L shaped
bracket but a triangular plate in the corner. This plate is 180mm
high, goes across the bus for 250mm is 1mm thick and has a 5mm lip
bent forward at right angles to the plate on the sloping edge. The
plate is from the same sheet of steel as the rear side of the seat
pedestal. These measurements are accurate as I've just been out to
my 1998 Brazilian T2 and measured them.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">As a point of interest the seat belt mountings
are now taken through this plate rather than down through the seat
pedestal.</font> <!-- 2007-01-28 mcr Removed dead link

<p><font size="+1">Please (everybody) note, that it is the
consensus of opinion on this list that the T2s being produced in
Brazil cannot be legally imported into the USA or Canada (please
consult the archives for details). Therefore threads on the
importation of T2s from south to north America is a banned topic on
the list. Also I did not import my van into the UK but bought it
from Beetles (UK) who import them commercially; their web site is
www.beetles-uk.com I will not reply to E-mails asking me how to
import Brazilian T2s into any country in the world even the UK.
Sorry.</font></p>
