  <h3>Bulkhead (Panel Behind Front Seats) Removal</h3>

  <h3>by Bob Wallace</h3>
  <hr size="2">

  <blockquote>
    <font size="+1"><i>More of concern with this conversion is the absence of
    the bulkheads (dividers) behind driver's and passenger's seats. In place
    of these I found triangular braces (3" - 4") welded at floor level behind
    the seats. Original or converted? Good thing or bad? I get a nice warm
    feeling reading/hearing about how VW designers over-engineered the
    structure of the bus. I get nervous thinking that a converter or PPO
    thought they knew more than VW.</i></font>

  <p><font size="+1">The removal of the bulkheads is a modification desired
  by many people to enable the fitting of rotating seats which would make the
  cab seats usable while camping and giving a larger usable space in the
  rear; and is very effective.</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1">For the 78 and 79 (or maybe just 79) model years VW did
  produce T2s without bulkheads but only in Deluxe minibuses; the
  strengthening which replaced the bulkhead was an L shaped bracket 250mm
  long on each leg, 20mm wide and 8mm thick at the corner tapering to 4mm
  thick at the ends. This bracket goes up the door pillar and out across the
  rear upper edge of the seat pedestal. NB dimensions are approximate and are
  from memory of a friends bus.</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1">Because there were T2 busses made by VW without
  bulkheads the VW Type 2 Owners Club contacted VW about the removal of
  bulkheads and received a written reply that this did not affect the
  structural integrity of the vehicle PROVIDED that a strengthening bracket
  is used in its place.</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1">So from the arrangement you describe (and the vehicles
  age) I would think that think that the bulkhead removal has been done by a
  previous owner or converter.</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1">You yourself must judge if the strengthening and
  workmanship used in removing the bulkheads is adequate.</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1">To help you with this VW themselves still produce T2
  busses in Brazil and these come off the production line WITHOUT bulkheads
  neither do they have the late 70s L shaped bracket but a triangular plate
  in the corner. This plate is 180mm high, goes across the bus for 250mm is
  1mm thick and has a 5mm lip bent forward at right angles to the plate on
  the sloping edge. The plate is from the same sheet of steel as the rear
  side of the seat pedestal. These measurements are accurate as I've just
  been out to my 1998 Brazilian T2 and measured them.</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1">As a point of interest the seat belt mountings are now
  taken through this plate rather than down through the seat pedestal.</font>

This plate may be seen <a

==follow the 'But what does it look like inside?' link.

  <p><font size="+1">Please (everybody) note, that it is the consensus of
  opinion on this list that the T2s being produced in Brazil cannot be
  legally imported into the USA or Canada (please consult the archives for
  details). Therefore threads on the importation of T2s from south to north
  America is a banned topic on the list. Also I did not import my van into
  the UK but bought it from Beetles (UK) who import them commercially; their
  web site is www.beetles-uk.com I will not reply to E-mails asking me how to
  import Brazilian T2s into any country in the world even the UK.
  Sorry.</font></p>
