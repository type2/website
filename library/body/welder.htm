<h3>Welders</h3>
<p>by Josh Rodgers</p>
<hr size="2">
<p><font size="+1">This is one subject I find myself qualified to
write about not because I am an expert welder. I am not. But, I
have recently had to go through the ordeal of having to make the
decision for a pretty major investment in regards to my
buses.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>OXYGEN - ACETYLENE WELDERS:</b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Commonly referred to as "Oxy-Acetylene" welding
is simply a mixture of two gases to produce a high temperature
flame to melt metals together. This type of setup is primarily used
for cutting torches and "bailing wire" welding to farm machinery
and is not recommended for Autobody type work except as a last
resort. Prices vary, but the gas tanks make up the biggest expense
for this welder.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>PROS:</b><br>
(1) Portable<br>
(2) Does not require electricity<br>
(3) Initial Cost For Setup is "RELATIVELY" low at
$100-$300</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>CONS:</b><br>
(1) Two Bulky Gas Tanks<br>
(2) Tanks Need Refilled<br>
(3) Warps Thinner Metals Easy (due to great surface area of
heating)<br>
(4) Difficult to use</font></p>

<p><font size="+1"><b>MIG WELDERS:</b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The "MIG" welder is the most commonly used
welder due mostly to its ease of use. It bonds two pieces of metal
together thru the use of basically arching two different polarities
of electricity together via your grounded project and a trigger fed
"gun" of wire.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">A true MIG welder adds an Argon gas attachment
which "supposedly" reduces "impurities" in your weld and seem to
just make a lot cleaner looking weld by shielding the weld pool
from contamination by oxygen. Some "MIG" welders that are called
"Gasless" simply invert the electrical polarity on the weld and use
special wire called "flux core" which provides a similar effect as
Argon. These are also referred to as "Wire Welders".</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I chose a "combination" MIG welder which lets
you either weld "gasless" with "flux core" wire (for out in the
boonies), or you can switch the polarity of the cables and run
Argon and standard MIG wire to it for a professional, clean looking
weld. Mine is manufactured by a company called "Clarke". I am sure
the manufacturer inferior to "Lincoln" products, but I liked the
flexability the "Clarke" brand provided. Also important, a well
established local company carries all the attachments and supplies
for the "Clarke" brand where supplies for the "Lincoln" were
limited and much more costly.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Additionally, MIG welders come in different
amperages. I have used a 60 amp wire welder and found its use very
limited to very thin, light metals only. The largest (and most
common) MIG welders that I have been able to find are around 100
amp and are sufficient for even larger projects. They say 100 amp
is good up to 1/2 inch steel but I would rate them more around a
1/4 inch steel which is still very respectable for their
size.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>PROS:</b><br>
(1) Portable<br>
(2) Supplies Are Inexpensive<br>
(3) Little Warpage To Project<br>
(4) Very Easy to Use<br>
(5) Operate on 110 voltage (normal house electricity in the
US)</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>CONS:</b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><br>
(1) Must have Electricity to Operate<br>
(2) Initial Cost is About $300-$400<br>
(3) Limited to Thin and Light Metal Work (under 3/8")</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font size="+1"><b>ARC WELDERS:</b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Arc Welders are similar to a MIG Welder in that
they fuse two surfaces of metal together by taking two opposite
polarities of electricity and binding them with a metal. Arc
Welding is also called "Stick Welding" because you use a "flux"
coated rod or "stick" that a lead is attached to and "Archs" when a
lead of opposing polarity is applied to the surface the rods end
will meet with. Arch welders are most commonly 22O volt which
really cuts down on versatility.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>PROS:</b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><br>
(1) Portable<br>
(2) Supplies Are Inexpensive<br>
(3) Initial Cost Varies $100 (110volt units) to $1000's for
commercial units<br>
(4) Good for Larger Projects (thick metal)</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>CONS:</b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><br>
(1) Must have 220 Volt (Electric Clothes Dryer or Stove)
Electricity to Operate<br>
(2) Difficult to use on Smaller Projects<br>
(3) Medium to Hard to Use<br>
(4) Medium Warpage/Burn Through To Project</font></p>
