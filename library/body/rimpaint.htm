<h3>Painting Wheel Rims</h3>
<p>by John Anderson</p>
<hr size="2">
<blockquote><font size="+1"><i>There are two tricks to painting
wheels...</i></font>
<ol>
<li><font size="+1"><i>Have the tires removed from the rims and
have the area you don't see painted as well as the areas you do
see.</i></font></li>
<li><font size="+1"><i>Find a tire shop that has a rim machine that
reaches around the tire and does not touch the outer area of the
rim. These machines are much more common today and will not damage
the paint. Better yet have someone mount them by hand. I did this
once myself (new tires, fresh painted wheels) and can do a tire in
less then 4 minutes.</i></font></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">These are both good thoughts, to anyone
interested in some particulars, I've painted 4-5 sets and here are
some tips.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Blast them totally clean as with anything, bare
metal, metal etch, metal treatment converter. PPG DP40/90 etc. as
usual. In fact, if you are doing black ones, multiple coats of DP90
(I think that is the black) are pretty much enough if you want a
flat black like late bay/vanagon steels.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Major tip:</b> you can never get all the
blasting residue out of the crack of the rim to center joint, plus
it is VERY hard to get that well painted. I've done 2 things
separately and I do now in combination. Brush paint that joint all
the way round by hand first off. Then do one spray coat of primer,
then use a good automotive seam sealer calk in the joint all the
way round. That is what really gets them sealed up never to rust at
the joint, and covers residual sand bits. Continue with another
primer (or 2 more if using it as topcoat) and then maybe 2 shots of
topcoat.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Another good tip: cheapy lazy susan and spin the
wheel as opposed to trying to walk round it and maintain a good
spray. I put an old 1 gallon paint thinner can on the turntable and
set the wheel on it, in fact I just move them around on the thinner
cans (I have several.) Typically I use the gun adjusted to about 2"
wide spray and do multiple angles working center out and the
outside edges, let them dry overnight then do the backs.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">As Donald mentions the outside edges are
critical for nice air sealing, and tire shop idiots can scratch
them up even with better machines. Insist on a machine they do
alloys on if you don't want them scratched, but frankly most all
places use those now days anyway, operator error can still maul a
rim (real important on say a $500 alloy).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I mount/dismount my narrow 5's by hand on an old
manual machine I picked up for $25 at a sale. These are pretty
common, and depending on the design can be very safe for rims if
they feature lead lined parts to run on the rims. I've noted Harbor
Freight sells one for about $50, but have no idea the quality. They
look like the thing the guy is using in the Bentley T2 manual. You
sort of have to watch buying at a sale though as some of the early
ones have a lot of parts to mount dismount, can be pretty hard to
plain figure out how to use, and be useless if stuff is
missing.<br></font></p>
