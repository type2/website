<h3>Fuel Tank Clogging/Cleaning</h3>
<p>by Joe Fournier</p>
<hr size="2">
<p><font size="+1">Even after I pulled my tank and sloshed over a
cup of trash (including a dead mouse) out of the tank, I found that
out of the blue I would get these "hiccups" as I called them. If I
pulled over and let the bus sit for a while, I could get it going
again for another while. I've spent up to an hour on the side of
the road, though.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">My guess was that the trash was getting sucked
in enough to create a vacuum. Even though I could get fuel to go
through the lines, it wasn't enough.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Here's what finally fixed it:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">1. Pulled the tank</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">2. Poked a nail up into the tube from which gas
flows, discovering a tar-like substance in the tube at the bottom
of the tank.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">3. Had the tank acid washed. (If you do this,
bring a sealer with you. I didn't and I could see rust forming by
the time I got it home. If you don't have a sealer, bring something
that will dry the tank and something else that will oil it...like
dry gas and wd-40).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Once I reinstalled it, everything worked like a
charm. I run two in-line filters and watch for gas.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">***I think the problem is that in these old
buses, if they sit for some time, the gas starts turning to shelack
(which I've heard it does) and gums up the tube where the gas
leaves the tank. The reason it interferes at speed and doesn't
appear to do so when you press in the clutch is beyond
me.</font></p>
