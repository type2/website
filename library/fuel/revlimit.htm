All bay EFI ECU's have the 5400 rpm rev limit built into the ECU. The Bentley seems to leave this important bit of info out!! Not just the 79 Cal..... 
<p>
 But if you look in the VW 1st Edition yellow covered Repair Manual, it is listed on pages 28.2 and 28.3. NOT the Bentley, but the FACTORY type 2 manual that Bentley got its info from. Printed 6/76 for 74, 75, and 76 USA and Canada models. 
<p>
 I put a ! after 'almost' because: Page 28.2 says the rotor is the rev limiter for the ED engine but the * says "For California: speed limiter in control unit". So 74/75 FED ECU's do not have it? 
<p>
 Page 23.3 is all 76 GD engines and the speed limiter is in the control unit.
