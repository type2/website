<p><font size="+1">The fact that the temp sensor #2 was a trouble
spot didn't surprise me but I didn't expect to have this many AFM
contact plate problems. I guess 20 years of friction of the control
arm swinging over the contact plate is predictable to cause
failure. If you haven't found a good spare for the AFM maybe its
time to be putting away alittle to send to Bus Depot for a new one
($150 up).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Notice that no one mentioned a problem with the
ECU!</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Almost without exception, everyone voiced
satisfaction with their Bosch FI System. With a simple multi meter
test most problems can be easily diagnosed and
corrected.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Karl von Salzen mentioned that he replaces his
Temp sensor #2 every year.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Karl says: " I don't change it once a year just
to change it. I change it once a year because that seems to be it's
lifespan! I consider it a maintenance item. At first I thought it
was a AFM problem. I would swap with another and all the problems
would go away for a week. Then they would come back so I would put
my original AFM back on. Problems gone again for a few days/week.
Replace the #3 temp sensor and the problems were gone. I haven't
been able to explain the one year life span. The one I have in now
has lasted almost 2 years so far. This one I put in dry after I
cleaned the threads of anti-seize. I believe the anti-seize was
insulating the threads and causing the sensor to read 'open'. This
one also hasn't had the problem of loosening up on it's own once a
month where I have to retighten it. Seemed like it was 'check the
oil, check the tightness'. Now it stays tight."</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Steve says:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I personally would worry about stripping the
threads on the head with this much replacement so I'd recommend
just testing the sensor regularly:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Put ohm meter contact between #13 and #17
ground. This tests the Temperature sensor II. At 68 degrees it
should be between 2000-2900 ohms. (700-1000 @122 degrees; 200-400 @
176 degrees; and less than 200 at operating temp). Testing this at
the Harness to ECU plug will test whether there is a problem in the
harness too.<br></font></p>
