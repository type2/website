The fact that the temp sensor #2 was a trouble spot didn't surprise me
but I didn't expect to have this many AFM contact plate problems.  I
guess 20 years of friction of the control arm swinging over the
contact plate is predictable to cause failure.  If you haven't found a
good spare for the AFM maybe its time to be putting away alittle to
send to Bus Depot for a new one ($150 up).
<P>
Notice that no one mentioned a problem with the ECU!
<P>
Almost without exception, everyone voiced satisfaction with their
Bosch FI System.  With a simple multi meter test most problems can be
easily diagnosed and corrected.

Karl von Salzen mentioned that he replaces his Temp sensor #2 every year.
<P>
Karl says: " I don't change it once a year just to change  it. I change it 
once a year because that seems to be it's lifespan! I consider it a maintenance item.
At first I thought it was a AFM problem. I would swap with another and
all  the problems would go away for a week. Then they would come back
so I would  put my original AFM back on. Problems gone again for a few
days/week.  Replace the #3 temp sensor and the problems were gone. I
haven't been able  to explain the one year life span. The one I have
in now has lasted almost 2  years so far. This one I put in dry after
I cleaned the threads of  anti-seize. I believe the anti-seize was
insulating the threads and causing  the sensor to read 'open'. This
one also hasn't had the problem of loosening  up on it's own once a
month where I have to retighten it. Seemed like it was  'check the
oil, check the tightness'. Now it stays tight."
<P>
Steve says:

I personally would worry about stripping the threads on the head with this
much replacement so I'd recommend just testing the sensor regularly:
<P>
Put ohm meter contact between #13 and #17 ground.  This tests the
Temperature sensor II.  At 68 degrees it should be between
2000-2900 ohms. (700-1000 @122 degrees; 200-400 @ 176 degrees; and less than 200
at operating temp).  Testing this at the Harness to ECU plug will
test whether there is a problem in the harness too.
