<h3>Cold Start Valve and Thermo Time Switch</h3>
<p>by Sean Bartnik</p>
<hr size="2">
<p><font size="+1">Here's how the cold start valve/thermo time
switch works:<br></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The thermo-time switch has a metal contact arm
inside which is wrapped with a heating element. When it's cold, the
arm contacts a ground connection. When you turn the key to start
(the cold start valve ALWAYS receives power when the key is in
start, and ONLY when the key is in the start position --
temperature is irrelevant as far as the cold start valve itself is
concerned) 12v is sent to the cold start valve. If the thermo-time
switch is cold, then the thermo-time switch grounds the cold start
valve, allowing it to inject fuel. When the key is "on" the heating
element in the thermo-time switch is warming up and slowly bending
the contact arm, and so once it gets warm enough, it breaks contact
and no longer grounds the cold start valve, shutting it
off.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">However, this applies only when cranking. The
cold start valve never receives 12v when the engine is running,
i.e. when the key is in the "on" position, only when the key is in
the "start" position. So, to answer your question, no, the cold
start valve is probably not staying on, unless you've got some
weird wiring.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">And the thermo-time switch does not supply 12v
to the cold start valve, it merely supplies a ground for the cold
start valve.</font></p>
