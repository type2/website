<h3>EGR Valve and Charcoal Canister</h3>
<p>by Bill Abbott</p>
<hr size="2">
<p><font size="+1">The EGR should have a control hose that goes to
the intake manifold and allows the EGR valve to open at
wide-open-throttle, allowing some exhaust gas to mix with the
intake stream. The exhaust gas into and out-of conections to the
EGR valve are metal tubes in a '77 Rabbit, I expect the same in a
74 bus. One goes to the exhaust manifold and the other to the
intake manifold...</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">To test the EGR operation, start the engine and
then disconnect the control hose. The EGR should open and engine
should slow/hesitate/ act like it's getting some exhaust gasses
mixed into the intake stream. If disconnecting the hose makes no
difference, either the hose is leaky/ blocked or the egr exhaust
gas pipe(s) are blocked.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The basic failure of an EGR is the valve
diaphram that senses intake maifold vacuum and closes the valve.
With a clean hose on the control input, suck on the hose and put
your tongue against the open end of the hose. It should hold the
lower pressure, stick to your tongue, for at least a minute. You
can do the same test with a vacuum gauge of course, if you have
one. If the valve won't hold low pressure, then it won't close
completely at idle and your bus will ildle poorly.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Bentley SHOULD cover this, but I've never
looked.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">On our '70 single cab, there's a hose from the
fuel-tank to the charcoal canister, which is what allows it to do
its job, venting the fuel system to ambient pressure. This might be
a small diameter (1/4"/6mm) hose but I think ours is large (10mm?)
and connects to an appropriately sized metal hose that runs back to
the engine comparment from the vicinity of the fuel-filler, high on
the right side of the front of the engine comparment.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">A second, large diameter (10mm?), hose connects
the charcoal canister to a fitting on the side of the aircleaner
(Broken when I got the bus, JB Welded by me 4 years ago and still
solid).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The third, large diameter (10mm?) hose on the
charcoal canister connects to the opposite side from the one that
goes to the aircleaner and comes from a fitting on the cooling
shroud. This one should probably be on the opposite side of the
charcoal canister from the hose that conects to the
tank.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The theory of operation on the charcoal canister
is that it absorbs gas fumes from the tank as it vents out of the
tank during filling /expansion of the contents and also allows air
to flow through into the tank as the gas is consumed. The hose from
the cooling shroud blows air into the canister and that air vents
to the aircleaner, where is the slightly 'enriched' airflow mixes
with regular air sucked into the aircleaner and goes through the
engine, burning up the gas fumes.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The charcoal canister actually becomes
ineffective eventually, and is intended to be replaced at 30,000
mile intervals I think. I don't know anyone who does that but
that's what's intended.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The other venting connection on our '70 runs
from the oil filler pipe to a second fitting on the aircleaner,
venting the crankcase to the aircleaner. Again, the theory is that
the oil-laden smelly air from the crankcase vents to the aircleaner
where it gets passed through the enging and the hydrocarbons
burned, or at least given a good scare :).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The point of the exercise is to vent the gas
tank and crankcase to ambient pressure without allowing smelly or
hazardous effects.<br></font></p>
