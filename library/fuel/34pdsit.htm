Ok, the way I understand it, the screws on the stock Solex carbs (1974 
Bus, 1.8l type IV) only adjust the mixture at idle.  The bus is running a 
bit rich, so I want to lean it out a bit.  How do I do this?  It is rich 
at idle, so I'm going to adjust the idle mixture screws (out is lean?), 
but it is giving off a bit of smoke when I'm driving (plus it smells rich 
if you happen to be driving behind me).

Be careful when doing this with the 34PDSIT carburetors and here's why - 
The screws into the Throttle Body (base) are used primarily for fine
tuning the  "Balancing" of the two carburetors so that they are in "sync"
- Generally two to as many as 5 turns out COUNTERCLOCKWISE from bottoming
out.  A device called a "Unisyn" or similar animal is used for balancing
the carbs.
<P>
Idle mixture control is handled only on the LEFT Carburetor - there are
two screws (with O-Rings) on the top of the carb.  The large one adjusts
the idle (called an Air Bypass Mixture Screw) and the smaller one (called
a Volume Control Screw) is the one used to set the idle mixture.  The
Volume Control Screw is usually set at about 1 1/2 to 3 turns
COUNTERCLOCKWISE from bottoming it.  OUT is RICH - IN is LEAN and only
during idle.  There is nothing on the right side carburetor that will
allow for setting the Idle Volume Control like the left side does - it's
pre-set on that carburetor.
<P>
There is an additional screw on each carburetor attached to the linkage
called the Throttle Stop Set Scew.  This is to be pre-set by turning the
screw CLOCKWISE until it just touches the Throttle Stop on the
carburetor, then an additional ONE turn further CLOCKWISE.  Do this with
the Choke in the OFF (Open) position.
<P> 
The Bentley Bible is the best source for setting the carburetors
step-by-step.  See Section 3, pages 9 thru 25 for the basic overview. 
Most other books I've looked at regarding the set-up of these carburetors
is rather poor and a waste of time.
<P>
Running rich symptoms usually mean some of the Air Bypass drillings or
passages, both in the idle and power circuits within the carburetor, are
clogged up with dirt and junk - the carburetors should be cleaned out or
better yet rebuilt.  Loose Idle Pilot Jets or Idle Cut-Off Valves can
also cause these problems as well.  Other causes are the Intake
Needle/Seat isn't closing properly (dirty), Float is leaking (doesn't
happen very often, but sheesh - these are over 20 years old) and too high
of fuel pressure from the mechanical pump.  If you're running an electric
fuel pump, fuel pressure may be too high and require a pressure regulator
as well - pressure shouldn't be more than 2 to 3 psi.
