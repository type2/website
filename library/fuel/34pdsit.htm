adjust the mixture at idle. The bus is running a bit rich, so I
want to lean it out a bit. How do I do this? It is rich at idle, so
I'm going to adjust the idle mixture screws (out is lean?), but it
is giving off a bit of smoke when I'm driving (plus it smells rich
if you happen to be driving behind me).</i></font></blockquote>

<p><font size="+1">Be careful when doing this with the 34PDSIT
carburetors and here's why - The screws into the Throttle Body
(base) are used primarily for fine tuning the "Balancing" of the
two carburetors so that they are in "sync" - Generally two to as
many as 5 turns out COUNTERCLOCKWISE from bottoming out. A device
called a "Unisyn" or similar animal is used for balancing the
carbs.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Idle mixture control is handled only on the LEFT
Carburetor - there are two screws (with O-Rings) on the top of the
carb. The large one adjusts the idle (called an Air Bypass Mixture
Screw) and the smaller one (called a Volume Control Screw) is the
one used to set the idle mixture. The Volume Control Screw is
usually set at about 1 1/2 to 3 turns COUNTERCLOCKWISE from
bottoming it. OUT is RICH - IN is LEAN and only during idle. There
is nothing on the right side carburetor that will allow for setting
the Idle Volume Control like the left side does - it's pre-set on
that carburetor.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">There is an additional screw on each carburetor
attached to the linkage called the Throttle Stop Set Scew. This is
to be pre-set by turning the screw CLOCKWISE until it just touches
the Throttle Stop on the carburetor, then an additional ONE turn
further CLOCKWISE. Do this with the Choke in the OFF (Open)
position.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The Bentley Bible is the best source for setting
the carburetors step-by-step. See Section 3, pages 9 thru 25 for
the basic overview. Most other books I've looked at regarding the
set-up of these carburetors is rather poor and a waste of
time.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Running rich symptoms usually mean some of the
Air Bypass drillings or passages, both in the idle and power
circuits within the carburetor, are clogged up with dirt and junk -
the carburetors should be cleaned out or better yet rebuilt. Loose
Idle Pilot Jets or Idle Cut-Off Valves can also cause these
problems as well. Other causes are the Intake Needle/Seat isn't
closing properly (dirty), Float is leaking (doesn't happen very
often, but sheesh - these are over 20 years old) and too high of
fuel pressure from the mechanical pump. If you're running an
electric fuel pump, fuel pressure may be too high and require a
pressure regulator as well - pressure shouldn't be more than 2 to 3
psi.</font></p>
