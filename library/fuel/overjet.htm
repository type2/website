<h3>Over Jetting</h3>
<p>by Barb & Eric</p>

<blockquote><font size="+1"><i>"So I went to my local FLAP and
found the biggest jet he had, a 130. Gee. I didn't think I was
supposed to feel acceleration or be able to break 60mph on the
highway. All that and significantly cooler oil temps at
speed."</i></font></blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">We think you might have gone with the wrong
solution. The stock main jet for your bus was a 116. You are
probably running too rich in the lower RPMs while accelerating,
which will wash out your rings with too much fuel in the lower
RPMs. Instead, you probably would be better off with a smaller air
correction jet in your carberator.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">There is not one jet, but three jets that you
have to have right to match the engine size, air cleaner, and even
how the different engine compartments breath. The pilot jet sets
your idle with the air/fuel adjusting screw doing a little fine
tuning. The main jet does the low to medium RPM acceleration fuel
delivery. The air correction jet actually allows more air into the
fuel system the bigger this jet is and it controls the fuel mixture
at the higher (about 2,500-4,000) RPMs. So check out your Bentley
manuals for your size engine and then check the other Bentleys for
your bus and see if you need to compromise between the
two.<br></font></p>
