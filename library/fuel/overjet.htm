"So I went to my local FLAP and found the biggest jet he had, 
a 130.  Gee.  I didn't think I was supposed to feel 
acceleration or be able to  break 60mph on the highway. 
All that and significantly cooler oil temps at speed."

We think you might have gone with the wrong solution.  The stock main jet
for your bus was a 116.  You are probably running too rich in the lower RPMs while
accelerating, which will wash out your rings with too much fuel in the lower
RPMs.  Instead, you probably would be better off with a smaller air correction
jet in your carberator.   
<P>
There is not one jet, but three jets that you have to
have right to match the engine size, air cleaner, and even how the different
engine compartments breath.  The pilot jet sets your idle with the air/fuel
adjusting screw doing a little fine tuning.  The main jet does the low to
medium RPM acceleration fuel delivery.  The air correction jet 
actually allows more air into the fuel system the bigger this jet is and it
controls the fuel mixture at the higher (about 2,500-4,000) RPMs.  So
check out your Bentley manuals for your size engine and then check the other
Bentleys for your bus and see if you need to compromise between the two.
