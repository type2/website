<h3>Air Cleaner (Stock) for '68-71 Type 2</h3>
<p>by George Lyle</p>
<hr size="2">
<blockquote><font size="+1"><i>"This air cleaner has two flaps in
its snout. One of the flaps has a weight on it: you know the one
that hasn't been ripped off and destroyed on most stock air
cleaners--somebody usually has this one wired
open."</i></font></blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">This flap, for all I know, is there to close off
the crankcase blow-by tube when the airflow through the intake is
high. The weight normally keeps the flap angled up, which opens the
crankcase vent into the air cleaner. My assumption is that this
helps to prevent detonation caused by excessive crankcase blow-by.
It normally bobs up and down quite a bit at idle, which is probably
why folks wire it up.</font></p>
<blockquote><font size="+1"><i>"Then there's another one, and it
has a business on the outside that looks spring loaded. It looks
like this spring-loaded thing opens and closes the second flap,
choosing between hot intake air and cold."</i></font></blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">That's what it does. There is a wax pellet
thermostat located inside the filter housing (it's that
bullet-shaped thing that you can see from the inside of the
housing). This thermostat senses the temperature of the intake air
and pushes a rod in and out. This rod varies the position of the
flap inside the neck of the air cleaner which controls the mix of
the air. [Editor's Note: This describes a '71 air cleaner. On
'68-'70 models this flap is controlled via a cable attached to the
right side cooling flaps which are actuated by thermostat
expansion/contraction].</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">This is a very nice automatic device. The only
problem is that my thermostat is kaput! I haven't even tried to get
a replacement, which I doubt is available (anyone get one lately?).
I get around the problem with the crude method of installing and
removing the hot air duct depending upon the weather. When the
weather gets cool the duct is installed. When it warms up the duct
is removed and a plug installed in the hot air inlet in the breast
tin. Make sure that you plug this hole, as it can be a major
hot-air leak! I use a expanding freeze plug to seal it. This method
works great for me, and there are quite a few cars that work this
way from the factory (albeit with a "winter/summer" lever, rather
than removing parts!)</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Having hot air going to the carb really improves
drivability at low temperatures. Without the hot air the carb tends
to stumble and lag when you want to accelerate. With hot air the
car performs just like in the summer.</font></p>
<blockquote><font size="+1"><i>"How does this thing work? I can't
figure it out. Is that spring-loaded thing some sort of thermostat?
It all seems self-contained. Hmmm. Also there seem to be two places
for a hose to the crankcase, where did the one go that doesn't go
to the oil fill?"</i></font></blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">The inlet under the neck goes to the oil filler.
The other inlet (in the side of the "can") goes to the charcoal
canister. It is the route by which fuel vapor from the canister
finds its way into the air cleaner and hence into the engine. If
you don't have a charcoal canister you just plug this
hole.</font></p>
<blockquote><font size="+1"><i>"Could you give me some idea as to
the angle the weighted flap should be resting at with the engine
stopped?"</i></font></blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">On my '71, the weight points toward the snout of
the air cleaner, slightly below horizontal. The flap attached to
the weight is held up against the top of the intake by the weight.
When the engine starts, the vacuum pulls the flap open, which
raises the weight to a position above horizontal.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I may have been premature in saying that the
purpose of the flap was to shut the crankcase vent tube. Having
examined it more closely, I think that the idea is to provide a
constant, slight vacuum to the crankcase vent over a wide range of
engine speeds and loads.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Mine still works fine, but I'm thinking of some
machined brass replacements for the plastic pivots, which are
fairly loose.</font></p>
