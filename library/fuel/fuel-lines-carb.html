<b>Notes:</b>

<h2>READ ALL THE WAY THROUGH THIS FIRST</h2>
<ul>
<li>When replacing fuel lines, I suggest just removing the original
hose, then cut the new one to the same size using the old as a
template.
<li>You may disconnect the battery and drain the tank for added fire
safety. I feel as long as you avoid open flame and sparks there
shouldn't be any problems.
<li>Total time required is about 15 minutes.

<b>Procedure:</b>

<ol>
<li>Remove and replace lines from carb to the fuel filter using 7.5mm
hose. Don't forget the clamps!!

<blockquote>A minimal amount of gas will spill out from the line. It
will evaporate quickly. You can collect this in a pot if you wish,
however I just let it run off.</blockquote>

<li>Loosen clamp and disconnect hose on fuel filter (for fuel line
running to fuel pump.)

<blockquote>This will make it easy to pull the hose out when you're
under the Bus.</blockquote>

<li>Climb under Bus
<li>Remove and replace line from fuel pump to the fuel filter using 5mm
hose. Don't forget the clamps!!

<blockquote>You can attach the hose to the fuel filter when you're back
on top of the Bus. Make sure to push it through the hole so you can
grab it when you're back at the engine.</blockquote>

<li>Remove and replace line from the tank to the pump, using 7.5mm
hose. Don't forget the clamps!!
<li>Get out from under Bus, and return to engine bay.
<li>Attach the hose that runs from the fuel pump to the fuel filter.
Don't forget the clamp!!
<li>Check for leaks in all 6 clamped areas. Attach safety wire while
you're at it!
</ol>
That's it! Now you can feel safe knowing you've personally changed and
inspected all fuel lines.
