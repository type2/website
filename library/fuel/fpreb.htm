<h3>Mechanical Fuel Pump Rebuilding</h3>
<p>by Bill Bowman</p>
<hr size="2">
<p><font size="+1">Although some of you might just install a new
Brazilian fuel pump on your motors, some of you "original" nuts
(like me) might buy a fuel pump rebuild kit and tear down and
rebuild your original pump. Usually over the years the diaphram
will harden or tear and start leaking gas down into your motor thru
the base (contaminating your motor oil - smell your dipstick
lately?). Bad, bad news for your motor.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">However, the rebuild kits usually don't come
with instructions and if you don't know any better, you can still
"screw up"the rebuild. The VW factory Workshop manual tells us
about an important step in the reassembly process that most of you
may not know about. After you've torn down and cleaned up every
part of the pump, lay the contents of your rebuild kit and your
pump out in front of you. Here is exactly what the Workshop manual
for the early 40hp style fuel pump says about the reassembly
process:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">When installing, the following points should be
observed:</font></p>
<ol>
<li><font size="+1">Check valves carefully; replace the top half if
necessary. (Bill: the "valves" are in the top half of the
pump)</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Replace the diaphram and rubber gasket if they
show signs of hardening. (Bill: the new ones should be in your
kit).</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Press down (on the) diaphram and spring and
insert rocker arm in diaphram. Insert pin (thru rocker arm) and
secure by means of the lock rings.</font>
<p><font size="+1">(NOW HERE IS THE STEP MOST OF YOU MAY NOT KNOW
ABOUT)</font></p>
</li>
<li><font size="+1">Place the lower half of fuel pump in a vice
with the Gage VW 328d inserted. Thus the rocker arm is pressed 14mm
(inwards measured from the flange jointing face), bringing the
diaphram to the required assembly position. (THIS IS IMPORTANT.
Before you place the top half of the pump down onto the diaphram,
and insert the six slotted screws and tighten them down, you must
FIRST DEPRESS and HOLD the rocker arm inside the lower base exactly
14mm as described above.</font>
<p><font size="+1">Granted, you'll probably never find the VW
special tool - Fuel Pump Gage VW 328d. I was lucky recently and
actually found and bought this tool which is for all fuel pumps
40hp and up. At the same time I also bought the other tool VW 328b
for the 25 and 36hp fuel pumps also. For your information, the 25-,
36hp tool depresses the push rod 35mm inwards measured from the
flange jointing face. Now, don't panic, you can fudge it! Just make
a small 14mm tall block or cylinder that will fit inside the lower
"base" of your fuel pump to depress the rocker arm. Set this block
on a perfectly flat surface like your workbench. Then set the lower
"base" down on it so that the point where the fuel pump push rod
would touch the rocker arm rests on top of the block. Then when you
press down on the "base" of the fuel pump until it is flush with
your workbench surface, you have just depressed the rocker arm
inside the "base", and hence your new diaphram, the proper 14mm.
Somehow clamp the base down in this position and move on to the
next step.</font></p>
</li>
<li><font size="+1">Place the top half of the pump in position so
that the fuel connections are situated above the inspection cover.
Make sure that the diaphram is not creased. (Bill: now with the
diaphram properly positioned by step 4 above, insert the six screws
and carefully tighten, making sure not to wrinkle up the diaphram
as you tighten the top half to the bottom "base".) Insert filter so
that the flat side is positioned downward. Do not omit the sealing
washer between the pump cover and mounting screw.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Fill the lower half of pump with Universal
grease VW - A 052 (anti-freeze). The grease assumes a liquid
condition at operating temperature, insuring a proper lubrication
of all moving parts. Rocker arm and pushrod which are devoid of
grease or oil indicate a leaky diaphram.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Check rocker arm spring for proper
seating.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Check inspection cover gasket for wear, replace
if necessary.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font size="+1">Again, other than my bracketed comments and
clarifications, the above instructions are copied verbatim out of
my 1959 VW Workshop manual. Those VW engineers wanted that diaphram
pre-tensioned for a reason, and if you don't do it correctly, your
fuel pump won't be working as well as it should. I hope this tip
helps some of you out!</font></p>

carburetor it's recommended practice to soak new diaphragms in
gasoline for an hour before installation to acclimate them to their
new environment.]</font></p>
