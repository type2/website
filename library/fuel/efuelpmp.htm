<p><font size="+1">Yes you can bench test them. It's not good to
run them for more than a second or 2 with no gas because they are
actually gas cooled and lubricated. But you can touch power to them
briefly to make sure they at least turn.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Sometimes you can resurrect a 'stuck' pump just
by whacking it once or twice with a piece of wood (don't hit it
hard enough to dent it!!).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">If you are going to bench test it with gasoline
running through it, you need to remember that these are 'push'
pumps, not 'pull' pumps. So you need your gas source to be able to
gravity-feed the pump. And also bear in mind that these are high
pressure, high volume pumps so make sure the output hose is safely
secured. These pumps will move around a lot while running so clamp
it down to your bench before firing it up. Try to minimize sparks
when you hook up the power source!! Probably the best way is to
install a simple 12V on/off switch and secure all the wires. You
really don't like to see sparks flying around when you're messing
with gasoline. Gas fumes are at least as flammable as the liquid so
do all of the above in a VENTILATED area and always have a fire
extinguisher handy just in case. Be safe.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I've found very often that when a fuel pump
won't run it has debris lodged in it, apparently. I've usually been
able to dislodge or unlock a locked up pump by hooking up the wires
in reverse an actuating the flapper a few times, maybe as many as
ten times. I've never found a pump that I couldn't free up like
this. Maybe good to know if you're stuck out in the boonies. Even
if you've a spare, changing one is not a pleasant job (always a
danger of a gasoline bath).</font></p>
