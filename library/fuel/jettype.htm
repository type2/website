<h3>Jetting a Type 1 Engine</h3>
<p>by Eugene Palmer</p>
<hr size="2">
<p><font size="+1">Several messages recently have raised the
concern in my mind that folks are not jetting their VW's to reflect
changes made to the engines. Allow me to recommend some guidelines.
My experience is limited to the upright and type 3 engines, but
I've no doubt the same principles apply to the type 4
pancake.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Stone Cold Dead Stock, this means stock engine
size, air cleaners, exhaust, compression, distributor, fuel,
etc.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Hey, use the stock jet size, which is 125 for
the 34 PICT-3. If it still seems hot, go to 127.5.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">ANY SINGLE THING other than stock, Berg
Semi-Hemi heads, 009 distributor, extractor exhaust,
etc.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">127.5-130 mains minimum</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">ANY TWO OR MORE THINGS other than
stock,</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">135 mains</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">SUPER STOCK, Berg Semi-Hemi heads, 6.9:1 CR,
dual carbs, paper or screen air cleaners, 009 distributor,
Pertronix or other CDI ignition, single or dual extractor exhaust,
ratio rockers. 140 mains minimum, I have these in my engine and,
even without the ratio rockers, it's still not quite enough. I'm
trying 142's and 147's soon (can't find 145's), I'll let you know.
Also refer to the Hot-VW's article on the SCAT stock engine with
dished pistons (lower CR) that recommends the same thing. They
stopped at 140 but I think 145 is supported when the timing is
advanced to take advantage of the lower CR. Hot-VW's didn't do
that, or didn't talk about it.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">LARGER ENGINES 1641-1776, Depending on the fuel
delivery system and other components, but even with stock carbs and
exhaust, please start at....... 150 mains and work up from there,
if it's a super set-up with dual carbs and extractor, it will
easily support 160, 165 or even 170 mains.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">BIG ENGINES 1776-1980, I think you're getting
the picture here, MORE FUEL, start at 160 mains, 170 if it's a
super set-up.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Taller Soapbox here: I burnt up a 1776 engine on
130 mains and a round silver "pressure regulator"(read restricted)
set at 2.5 PSI. I believe they were both responsible for the
extreme exhaust temperature and resulting melted heat exchangers,
burnt valves, cracked heads and scorched cylinders. I once returned
a pair of Kadrons because they "wouldn't make power" on a large
engine. They were simply not jetted high enough. I've read
everything Berg ever published and I believe when he says he can
lean out the mix on a lowered CR engine it's because his initial
jetting was way higher than us backyard types ever imagined. When I
tried the 130 mains (perfect right out of the box, guy on the phone
said so) in the Weber dual 34 ICT's on my super stock 6.9:1 CR
engine, it had nasty intake backfiring, the classic lean condition
symptom. No amount of idle jet changes would help, only until I
went to the 140's did it settle down. When I tried the stock carb
on this engine it ran hot and was horribly lean. I couldn't seem to
find larger Solex jets. The Dellorto manual says a "race ready"
1600cc engine is jetted 160 or higher, and that jetting is mostly
related to venturi size. When I hear about 1641's with 110 or 120
mains that positively scream, I cring and imagine the exhaust
valves red hot on their seats, and then the inevitable failure at
9435 miles.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I have an 02 sensor at the merge point of the
exhaust and I'm finding that the mixture changes even with the
level of fuel in the tank. When it's full, the mix is richer than
when it's near empty. I also think the outside temperature causes
changes, when it's summer and hot it's leaner than when it's
cooler. The first ten minutes of driving are richer than later on,
and I have the thermostat and flaps in operation. It seems
ridiculous but if I really were serious I would change both the
jets (richer) and spark plugs (colder) before heading out for the
mountains from the city. Folks seem to think their fuel mileage
will get better with leaner jets, I beg to differ, you weaken the
engine when you do this and it loses it's efficiency, not being
able to make the amount of power it could were it supplied with
sufficient fuel. I believe there is also a small amount of
evaporative cooling effect that helps keep engine temps down. Be
very careful when relying on the spark plug color, unless it was
taken out hot off the highway, you not likely to get an accurate
color. I don't believe that the level of pollution out of a lean
engine is less than that of a properly jetted engine.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The VW loves fuel and must have it to run cool
and strong. Bergs jetting was a proprietary secret, and I think
it's because he ran on the rich side of everything, though I don't
believe even they are sending out carb kits rich enough for what
people are putting together. Closely check your fuel lines, pump,
and filter for weakiness and restrictions. If you've made ANY
changes to your engine, check those jets, bump them up.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">But, of course, don't believe anybody, think for
yourself.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Regarding steering play, please check all
related components before charging into adjusting the steering box
itself. As mentioned in previous posts, the draglink ends. But
also, all four tie-rod ends, the king pin bushings (the ones center
of the front beam), the actual mounting bolts and frame around the
steering box for looseness or cracking, the dampner, the rubber
isolation ring above the box, and very importantly, the ball joints
or in the case of splitties, the king pins and associated bushings
out at the wheels. Also very importantly, the wheel bearings, and
wheels and tires. The steering box comes last. I've had very little
success adjusting the actual box, whenever I've tried, there
inevitably ends up being a tight spot or bind somewhere in the
travel, not good or worth it. Replace the lube if you want, but
don't do anything drastic to the box, if it's bad, replace
it.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Get your SO or buddy to crank the wheel back and
forth and check everything for play. Replace anything icky, tie
rods are fairly cheap. Look closely at the center king pin (also
called a swing arm pivot I think), there should be no rocking, this
is all in the Muir book. One thing not mentioned in the Muir book
is that if you do replace the king pin bushings you need to REMOVE
THE GREASE NIPPLE! Nothing like bashing endlessly up into the
bushings only to find you've been gouging a huge notch in the old
bushing as you beat it past the bit of grease nipple that protrudes
inside the beam. Without that thing in the way they come out like
butter. After you get all that done, have it aligned at a shop,
measuring across the tires just isn't accurate enough.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">On the subject of ongoing jet changes, I
re-installed the 60 idle jets (1600cc weber 34 ICT blah blah) and
lo & behold, the light throttle and off idle response has indeed
returned to it's previous smooth response. The running mix seems
better too for some unknown reason. I'm trying to stick to one
change at a time so thats the way I'll post them. Besides, I'm too
busy to fool with the car, I've the luxury of being able to ride my
bike to work these days and parking sucks.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">(1971 Westy with super-stock 1600cc type 1
engine, Weber 34 ICT dual carbs)</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Since I spouted off about the charge mix I
thought I'd do further testing, and see just how rich I could go
without producing black smoke, backfires, and horrible fuel
mileage. Though I tried to do just one change at a time I couldn't
quite pull it off, this is a work in progress.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I changed the mains to 147 (from 140), and while
I was inside I couldn't help but change the air to 160 (from 150),
and the idle down to 52 (from 60 in an effort to keep
backfire/sputtering to a minimum). The 02 meter got richer around
town, but there was now a stumble just off idle and in the super
light throttle range. I ran the timing ahead to about 18-20 BTDC
(from 15) on the 009/Pertronix. The stumble diminished but did not
disappear. On a warmed up highway run (&lt;10 miles) with the new
advanced timing the 02 had only a barely noticeable richer reading,
but even doing 75-80 mph the oil temp wasn't moving past 180,
midday, at about 75 degrees F air temp. I think it has a bit better
high speed power. This was already a pretty cool running engine and
previously would've only hit about 200 under the same conditions.
Downhill deceleration sputtering did not seem to change, it still
has a slight spit, so much for the 52 idles.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">This exhaust is a dual "quiet pack" extractor
with very tight flange type fittings that I brazed on where the
stock heat exchanger tips meet the extractor. I use the 15mm type
head nut for maximum flange coverage wherever I can get them to
fit, on the rest I use the stock 13mm nut. It's likely an engine
with the leaky stock clamps, or any other leak, would have a nasty
backfire under the same conditions.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I now imagine many of the list members out there
ripping into their carbs and I must say BE CAREFUL, fuel and sparks
don't mix! Keep that fire extinguisher charged and nearby, and
either dis-connect the battery and/or be darn sure there are no
sparks, electrical or mechanical, around your open carbs. Raw fuel
is a pollutant, stick it back in the carb or in your spare fuel
can.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Due to the heavier exhaust smell, I no longer
believe that the richer mix does not pollute any more than the
leaner mix. My nose tells me it does, perhaps it's the price for
keeping the VW running cool.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Please also make very sure there are no vacuum
leaks in your intake system. When I took the carbs out the little
covers over the distributor vacuum take-off were badly
disintegrated and must've been leaking air. It's very easy to do an
intake install and have a leak. An old problem I ran into was when
I tried to put a single port manifold back on an engine that had
the cylinders shimmed out for lower compression. The engine was
.120" wider and that was enough to make the intake manifold fail to
mate properly with the port on the heads. I eventually went to dual
carbs to solve the problem. I've also had to replace the hoses and
check valve for the power brake system to insure there were no
leaks. I always keep a spare check valve. The balance tube and
fittings should be closely checked and tightened, a lesson I
learned when I couldn't get a pair of Dellorto FRD's to perform
until I fully bottomed the hose clamps on the balance tube. The
next time I took off, the engine jumped to life as all the carb
circuits became engorged. Use an oil spray to find leaks, if the
idle changes, you know you've found a leak.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Next steps are to replace the 60 idle jet and
make sure the stumble goes away (it should). I'll try to have a bit
of patience and run a couple tanks through to get a sense of the
mileage before I try the 155 mains. If I can finally get a rich
highway reading, I'll try a CD ignition and maybe even the 1.4:1
rockers to see if the engine can use the fuel. Though I long ago
promised myself I wouldn't use the 1.4:1 rockers on these heads
because they don't have heavy duty springs, maybe just for little
while.</font></p>
