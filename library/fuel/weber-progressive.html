  <p>When you order a Weber Progressive for your air-cooled motor you are
  never quite sure what the jetting will be. Over the years various changes
  have been made to the main and air correction jets without any real plan
  from a sellers point of view. The Progressive in its various models have
  been used on over 100 models of cars and trucks, foreign and domestic, in
  factory and aftermarket applications. Also the type of Progressive you may
  receive might be different from the one you ordered or expected to get.</p>

  <p>The linkage setups for air-cooled VW work on both the DFAV/DGAV and the
  DFEV/DGEV carbs. The "E" is for electric choke and the "A" is for water
  choke. Make sure you get an electric choke as hot water is hard to come by
  in an air-cooled vehicle. The DGEV is the mirror of the DFEV and have been
  used successfully in dual carb setups for 2500 cc and above type IV and
  Porsche engines although the response is not as snappy as other types of
  dual carbs. If you have an application for dual 48's then dual Progressives
  might be a little more streetable. The DGEV come with a solenoid fuel shut
  off valve just like your original Solex, but you will need to lengthen the
  solenoid wire to reach the front mounted cutoff on the Progressive.</p>

  <p>The first carb I took apart had the following jet setup:</p>

  </table><br>
  This is what I used as my base line for setting up this 32/36 DFEV carb. My
  28/36 DCD out of a 72 Ford Pinto has a completely different jetting.
  Because they are hard to come by nowadays, even though I consider their
  range much better and they are manual choke, I am leaving this article to
  carbs that are available. You might have different jets installed in your
  32/36 and will have to make a determination as to what works best for your
  motor. If you get lucky you will have received a carb that has been jetted
  properly. This has happened to me a couple of times when I bought a rebuilt
  carb kit. One of the places I have ordered rebuilt carbs from is Larry's
  Off Road. The carbs they sell have been previously used in VW applications
  and will most likely have correct jetting.

  <p>The major problems when installing the Progressive carb are due to dirt
  and air leaks and debris in the intake runners. In the past it was possible
  to find that the intake manifold runners were too long. Today you may still
  find that situation when the crankcase cylinder faces have been surfaced or
  the heads fly-cut to raise the compression. This will narrow the engine
  causing an excessive runner length. Make sure that when the intake castings
  are bolted down that the center section is still loose in the boots. It is
  an excellent policy to always check the runners for dirt and debris. Some
  of the center sections come with the heat risers molded in place and others
  you have to assemble. Still other makes of intake center sections have no
  provision for heat risers at all. Make sure that your application is
  correct for the type of intake you get. The majority of uses are for street
  vehicles and will require the heat riser. This is a heavy carb and manifold
  so you need to install a bracket to take some of the strain.</p>

  <p>If you suspect dirt in the carb, even if it is brand new, there is a
  little trick you can try prior to tearing it down. This is how it happens.
  Dirt will build up over a time in your fuel lines and even new lines will
  have some residue. When the lines are wiggled while changing carbs or fuel
  filters, some of this will break loose and flow into the carb. A trick to
  break loose this dirt is to rev up your engine and then slap your hand over
  the top of the carb creating a huge vacuum. This will usually suck the dirt
  right through. The hard stuff that is still lodged in the fuel circuit will
  necessitate tearing down the carb regardless.</p>

  <p>During the adjustment and re-jetting process you will want to have a
  spark plug color chart to check where your burn is and decide which
  direction to go. You can usually pick these up at the auto parts store or
  there may be one in your repair manual. These are good to see where you are
  at in the process. I found a good color chart in an old Clymer's shop
  manual for a different vehicle. It will work fine for this.</p>

  <p>As a baseline you will want your motor to be in peak adjustment. That
  means the distributor timing is set, the points and plugs are gapped
  properly, and the valves are adjusted. If you are running larger
  aftermarket heads and have some intake porting, it is suggested to get the
  larger diameter intake manifold end castings available through many of the
  VW parts suppliers listed in the VW mags.</p>

  <p>Carb adjustment starts out with your float setting in your float bowl. I
  am like you, I'd rather not take the carb apart first, just use it out of
  the box with some minor exterior adjustments. The float setting is critical
  to everything else and must be checked. Floats can be out of whack from
  poor manufacture or remanufacture to just being jostled during shipping.
  You need to know where it is before changing anything else. Do the next
  step before installing on the engine.</p>

  <p>The top and bottom surface of the float must be parallel to the gasket
  surface of the float bowl. To check the bottom surface of the float you
  need to hold the carb upside down at about 45 degrees (this keeps the
  weight of the float from compressing the small spring in the float needle).
  The gasket surface to the bottom surface of the float should be about 1.5"
  or 38.5mm.</p>

  <p>I like to set up this carb on an engine start up stand in order to get
  to all the hard to reach places, most of you do not have this luxury.
  Before changing jets you need to check out the low speed settings as they
  will affect your motor from idle to over 3000 RPM. Back out the idle screw
  (it's the one on the linkage on the left side of the carb). Then screw it
  in until it just starts to move the primary butterfly (be sure the choke is
  full open and place your finger on the butterfly to tell when it first
  starts moving). Then turn it ONE FULL TURN.</p>

  <p>Next item is to set the idle richness screw -- that's the one below the
  choke on the front of the carb that's impossible to get to. This screw
  controls the amount of pre-mixed air and fuel. Screw it all the way and
  lightly bottom it out. Then back it out two (2) turns. I use a real short
  fat handled screw driver to get to this beast.</p>

  <p>The factory VW fuel pump will handle the supply to this carb under all
  but the most strenuous running. On dune buggies and vehicles that really
  wind up you will need to install an electric fuel pump and a fuel pressure
  regulator. I set the regulator to halfway for the base install. Now start
  the motor and let it warm up without changing the screw setting. Once the
  motor is warmed up and the choke has fully rotated, screw the idle richness
  screw in or out until you hit the highest RPM.</p>

  <p>Next, after letting your motor cool you must check how many turns out
  the idle richness screw is. Be very careful not to bottom out the screw
  hard when you do this. If the idle jet is the correct size you will be 1
  3/4 to 2 1/4 turns. If you are less than 1 3/4 turns out, install a smaller
  idle jet and if it's more than 2 1/4 turns out you need to install a larger
  idle jet. The only idle jet we will change in this article is in the
  primary circuit as the secondary jet (140-145) is large enough to handle
  the demand when the secondary is engaged.</p>

  <p>If you had to change the idle jet (the one on the left of the choke
  element) then go back and adjust the idle mixture screw again until you end
  up with it out about two turns for the highest RPM. You may want to turn it
  out another 1/2 turn to richen up the idle to compensate for low end drop
  out when the accelerator is pressed.</p>

  <p>Now that the low speed circuit is properly adjusted you can now use your
  spark plug color chart for adjusting the main and air correction jets.</p>

  <p>The backyard method, but one that works well, is to slowly run your
  engine up to 3500 RPM while attached to your tach and view the main jet in
  the venturi. It should start dripping fuel at this RPM into the throat of
  the venturi. If the fuel starts dripping at a much higher RPM then increase
  your main jet. If fuel starts dripping at a lower RPM than 3500 then
  decrease the size of your main jet. An engine installed in a Beetle or bus
  will force you to use a light and mirror to see this. Not everyone has an
  engine start up stand. I use an explosion proof sealed fluorescent shop
  light in the engine compartment.</p>

  <p>Although some low end throttle response can be helped through more
  initial spark advance, be careful where you set your timing. Too much
  advance too soon can be sure death to your motor. You don't want your
  advance all in before you hit your cruising RPM.</p>

  <p>You will notice that the air correction jets were never mentioned. The
  carb comes with all the air correction needed for any engine jetting from
  1600 cc to 1904 cc. Your mixture setting and main jet size is what is
  important on this carb.</p>

  <p>For my specific use on an 1835 cc engine with 041 39 X 35 valves, a 009
  distributor, and a stage 2 cam I came up with the following setting:</p>

  <table border="1" summary="Carb jets installed">
    <tr>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>

      <td>Primary</td>

      <td>Secondary</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>Main</td>

      <td>#137.5</td>

      <td>#145</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>Air Correction</td>

      <td>#165</td>

      <td>#160</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>Idle</td>

      <td>#65</td>

      <td>#150</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p>It's a hassle to set up and time consuming. That's why a lot of people
  give up and say that the Progressive is useless for VW application. Like
  all carbs, they have to be set up to match your engine size, but when
  dialed in, will perform satisfactory and give good mileage at the same
  time. You have the extra benefit of being able to stomp on it when you want
  to play and have extra umph available for that race to the stop light or
  passing on the highway.</p>

  <h2>Weber with a vacuum advance distributor</h2>

  <p>Information from the DBG web site: <a href=
  "http://www.dreamwater.com/dbg/how_do_you_run_a_weber_progressi.htm">http://www.dreamwater.com/dbg/how_do_you_run_a_weber_progressi.htm</a></p>

  <p>"How do you run a Weber progressive with a vacuum advance
  distributor?</p>

  <p>There is a small vacuum port on the progressive, but left alone it
  produces way too little vacuum to be of any help. There is a fix however.
  The way we did it was this:</p>

  <p>Method 1) with the stock carb or FI system read vacuum at the stock port
  with your mini-mightymax vacuum pump and tester. Take this reading at the
  RPM where your distributor is at max advance (on the test engine it was at
  3100 RPM). Now install the carb and read the vacuum at the same RPM.
  Enlarge the port using a selection of long and really tiny bits until the
  readings match the stock set-up.</p>

  <p>Method 2) Determine what RPM you want full advance, this may not be as
  easy as it seems. Then hook-up the pump to the diaphragm and start pumping
  until the dizzy is at full advance. Then start enlarging the port on the
  carb until you get the right vacuum at your revs.</p>

  <p>Some notes: Drilling the vacuum port voids any thought of a warranty on
  your carb.</p>

  <p>The port is at the point of tightest restriction in the carb throat. It
  can be tough drilling and not damaging the carb. To do so, you will need to
  remove the brass vacuum port fitting and attack from the outside using a
  selection of jetting bits. Be really sure to clean shavings after every
  drill.</p>

  <p>The vacuum level may rise quickly depending on how well your engine
  breaths. The larger the engine the more vacuum you will have. Once you set
  your vacuum level, mark your carb in some manner to signify that the vac
  port diameter has changed.</p>

  <p>Be sure you're done with improvements to your motor before you do this.
  Better breathing motors cause larger vacuums at lower RPM's, your dizzy may
  start to advance too quickly if you did the carb before you install 1.25:1
  rockers, bigger cam, larger jugs, etc.</p>

  <p>Take your time. It took us 3 days to get mine just right."</p>

  <h2>Information from the Redline site</h2>There is more technical info at
  the Redline site than all the other sources combined I've seen online.
  Redline has tuning info that doesn't exist in the Weber Carburetor books!
  The Redline web site is pretty bad (hard to navigate, broken links, pages
  that consist of large scanned fliers), but the info is very, very good.

  <p>Here are a few things I learned from the Redline site: <a href=
  "http://www.redlineweber.com/html/application_guide/making_the_right_choice_32.htm">
  http://www.redlineweber.com/html/application_guide/making_the_right_choice_32.htm</a>
  DGV and DFV are essentially mirror image carbs. The throttle primary
  throttle plate rotates clockwise in the DFV series. We use the DFV series
  on the VW Beetle (DFEV).</p>

  <p>The E in DFEV is for Electric choke. The A in DFAV (or DGAV) is for
  water choke (aqua? Weber is an Italian company.)</p>

  <p>DGV series carbs are available with an Integrated Cutoff Valve (ICU).
  This is the same as the electric idle solenoid on stock VW Solex carbs and
  prevents dieseling or run-on after you cut off the ignition. I do not know
  if the ICU is available on the DFV series carbs.</p>

  <p>The DGV series is available as a non-progressive, synchronous opening
  carburetor. This is a two barrel carb where both throttle plates open at
  the same time. These carbs are the 38 (mm) DGAS and 38 (mm) DPS. Redline
  recommends this carb for modified engines (hotter cam, headers, larger
  engine size, and presumably high flow cylinder heads). There does not
  appear to be a corresponding DFS, so those of us running VW's would have to
  do some interesting throttle cable modifications to use the DGS. I cannot
  tell if the DGS is available with electric choke (I guess it would be
  called a DGES). Of course, if you want a two barrel synchronous carb, the
  IDF is a better choice at about the same price.</p>
