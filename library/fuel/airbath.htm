<h3>Oil Bath Air Filter Cleaning</h3>
<p>by John Anderson</p>

<p><font size="+1">I read an SAE report a few years ago comparing
oil bath wicking filters to some popular pleated paper and oiled
gauze element filters. The oil bath was superior on all counts. VW
knew what they were doing. It lasts forever and maintainence isn't
really all that involved.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I had to wash the filter element on the '70. I
sat the top part with the horsehair in a 5 gallon bucket of
kerosene for an hour. As it became evident I'd go through kerosene
forever, I went to TSP and very hot water. I went through 3 water
changes then finished back in the kerosene. It was AMAZING what
came off the horse hair, and scary. But when I was finished the
hair appeared brand new and clean as a whistle. After the last
water wash I hooked a compact hair drier into the outlet with duct
tape and let it blow dry for a good half hour. The whole thing was
toasty warm with no moisture left. Then I dipped it once into
kerosene, dried it, then reassembled with a cleaned bottom half and
new oil.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Has your filter had regular maintainence its
entire life? And, just what did VW figure its life was? I'm quite
happy with the result and feel much better about what the truck now
sucks its air though.</font></p>
