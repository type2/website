<h3>Oil Bath Air Filter Cleaning

I read an SAE report a few years ago comparing oil bath
wicking filters to some popular pleated paper and oiled gauze element
filters.   The oil bath was superior on all counts.  VW knew what they were
doing.  It lasts forever and maintainence isn't really all that involved.
<P>
I had to wash the filter element on the '70.  I sat the top part with
the horsehair in a 5 gallon bucket of kerosene for an hour.  As it
became evident I'd go through kerosene forever, I went to TSP and very hot
water.  I went through 3 water changes then finished back in the kerosene.  It
was AMAZING what came off the horse hair, and scary.  But when I was finished
the hair appeared brand new and clean as a whistle.  After the
last water wash I hooked a compact hair drier into the outlet with duct tape
and let it blow dry for a good half hour.  The whole thing was toasty warm with
no moisture left.  Then I dipped it once into kerosene,  dried it, then reassembled with a
cleaned bottom half and new oil.
<P>
Has your filter had regular maintainence its entire life? And, just
what did VW figure its life was?  I'm quite happy with the result and feel
much better about what the truck now sucks its air though.
