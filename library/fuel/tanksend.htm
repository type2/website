<h3>Fuel Tank Sender Replacement</h3>

<p><font size="+1">I pulled the firewall out of my '74 & replaced
the sender. It wasn't the worst automotive experience I've had.
When I inspected my old sender I saw why it wasn't looking. There
are a series of parallel contacts that the sensor slides over as
the float rises and falls. About half of the contacts were worn
completely away.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">My notes aren't in the archives yet, so here's
my experience:</font></p>
<ol>
<li><font size="+1">As mentioned earlier, watch for two sheet metal
screws accessible under the bus that hold the lower part of the
firewall in place.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">With all of the screws removed, pry the
firewall out from the bottom. Once it clears the engine tin (a
squeeze & bend operation), you can free the top of the firewall by
applying downward pressure with a tire iron or pry bar. There's a
1/4'' lip that goes straight up into a slot.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">It's a pretty tight maneuver to remove the old
sender, but I did it with the tank in place. I removed the tank to
put the new one in...but wouldn't necessarily recommend that. (Be
careful loosening the hold-downs if you do. They're mild steel &
break easily.)</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Reinstalling the firewall was pretty simple.
The hardest part is getting the bottom to clear the tin. I used
several wide-blade taping knives, wedged between the frame & the
tin and the firewall slipped right over them.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font size="+1">(Editor's note: While the above procedure works
well for 1972-1979 buses, for the 1969-1971 bus you must either
pull the engine to remove the firewall and gas tank to replace the
tank sending unit, or cut a hole in the deck above the gas tank
exactly above the sending unit for access. 1968 buses typically
have no firewall, so access is simplified. The latter method was a
VW authorized procedure, but obviously requires caution when
cutting and a suitable method of resealing the hole once the
replacement procedure is completed.)</font></p>

<center><font size="+1">INSTRUCTIONS FOR ACCESS TO FUEL TANK SENDER
WITHOUT REMOVAL OF ENGINE OR DRILLING OF ACCESS PANEL ('72-'79 Type
1 or Type IV Engine Bus)</font></center>
<ol>
<li><font size="+1">Raise van to suitable height, support
engine.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Remove 4 * 13 mm bolts from rear engine support
bar.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Remove 2 * 14 mm bolts from front engine
support (on top of gearbox bell housing).</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Lower engine, about 4-5 inch gap between
support bar and its mounts, careful not to damage throttle cable,
it will come down enough without the need to
disconnect.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Remove insulation panel from engine compartment
roof, a nice sharp wood chisel and a few taps with a hammer chops
off the rivets without damage to the flimsey metal
panel.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Remove the 8 screws holding the panel in front
of the engine, drop it down half an inch and lift it straight
out.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">You now have access with the engine in the
lowered position for any work on the fuel tank, sender unit, filler
neck, overflow pipes.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Reverse procedure for re-installing. The rivets
that were knocked off can be drilled and tapped to allow fitting of
screws for easier access next time.</font></li>
