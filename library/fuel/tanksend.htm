I pulled the firewall out of my '74 & replaced the sender. 
It wasn't the worst automotive experience I've had. When I inspected my old sender 
I saw why it wasn't looking. There are a series of parallel contacts that the sensor 
slides over as the float rises and falls. About half of the contacts were worn completely 
away.
<P>
My notes aren't in the archives yet, so here's my experience:
<P>
<OL>
<LI> As mentioned earlier, watch for two sheet metal screws accessible under the bus 
that hold the lower part of the firewall in place.
<P>
<LI> With all of the screws removed, pry the firewall out from the bottom. Once it 
clears the engine tin (a squeeze & bend operation), you can free the top of the firewall 
by applying downward pressure with a tire iron or pry bar. There's a 1/4'' lip that goes 
straight up into a slot.
<P>
<LI> It's a pretty tight maneuver to remove the old sender, but I did it with the 
tank in place. I removed the tank to put the new one in...but wouldn't necessarily 
recommend that. (Be careful loosening the hold-downs if you do. They're mild steel & 
break easily.)
<P>
<LI> Reinstalling the firewall was pretty simple. The hardest part is getting the bottom 
to clear the tin. I used several wide-blade taping knives, wedged between the frame & 
the tin and the firewall slipped right over them.
</OL>

(Editor's note: While the above procedure works well for 1972-1979 buses, for 
the 1969-1971 bus you must either pull the engine to remove the firewall
and gas tank to replace the tank sending unit, or cut a hole in the deck above the gas tank 
exactly above the sending unit for access.  1968 buses typically have no firewall, so access is
simplified. The latter method was a VW authorized procedure, but obviously 
requires caution when cutting and a suitable method of resealing the hole once the replacement
procedure is completed.)

INSTRUCTIONS FOR ACCESS TO FUEL TANK SENDER WITHOUT REMOVAL OF ENGINE OR DRILLING OF ACCESS PANEL
('72-'79 Type 1 or Type IV Engine Bus)
</CENTER>
<P>
<OL>
<LI> Raise van to suitable height, support engine.
<P>
<LI> Remove 4 * 13 mm bolts from rear engine support bar.
<P>
<LI> Remove 2 * 14 mm bolts from front engine support (on top of gearbox bell housing).
<P>
<LI> Lower engine, about 4-5 inch gap between support bar and its mounts, careful not to damage throttle cable, it will come down enough without the need to disconnect.
<P>
<LI> Remove insulation panel from engine compartment roof, a nice sharp wood chisel and a few taps with a hammer chops off the rivets without damage to the flimsey metal panel.
<P>
<LI> Remove the 8 screws holding the panel in front of the engine, drop it down half an inch and lift it straight out.
<P>
<LI> You now have access with the engine in the lowered position for any work on the fuel tank, sender unit, filler neck, overflow pipes.
<P>
<LI> Reverse procedure for re-installing.  The rivets that were knocked off can be drilled and tapped to allow fitting of screws for easier access next time.
