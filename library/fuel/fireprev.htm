OK, it's time for George's Fairly-Annual Fuel and Fire Rant:
<P>
(This rant is obviously aimed at Type 1 engines, others edit as needed!)
<P>
The absolute best way to put out an engine fire is to _not_ have one
in the first place.  That means that you need to replace rubber fuel
hoses regularly.  Don't replace them "tomorrow" or "when I get around
to it" or "the next time the engine is out".  Replace them in January
of every even-numbered year, or devise your own system of timing. 
Every leaking fuel hose was "just fine" a month before the leak, and
the only way to avoid problems is to make sure that the hoses don't
get old enough to have problems.  They get old fast with the witch's
brew they call gasoline these days!
<P>
Be sure to use the proper metric size fuel hose and install it in a
workmanlike manner.  That means hose clamps on all pressurized
connections (or all connections if you are paranoid like me).  
<P>
Be sure that the fuel ports on the fuel pump and carb are tight by
giving 'em a good tug with a pair of pliers.  If they come out, clean
them up with carb cleaner, let dry, rough up the surface of the tube
by rolling it with a file, put a thin coat of JB-Weld (or other
fuel-proof epoxy) on the roughed up surface, tap the tube back into
place, and let cure.  Really paranoid folks safety-wire the hoses to
the fuel pump. Those little in-line filters aren't such a good idea. 
If you want to use a filter, get a metal one and make sure that it is
secured properly.
<P>
When replacing the hoses, cast a jaundiced eye on the metal fuel line
where it passes through the front tin.  There should be a rubber
bushing in this hole, but it is often missing.  The tin will cut
through the metal line.  This will cause a fuel leak on both sides of
the firewall and if a fire starts here it will be almost impossible to
put out.  If the bushing is missing, check the metal line for a groove
and replace it if a groove is present.  I've found that Chevy pickup
brake tubing (scavenged from a wreck) is just the correct OD and has a
thicker wall than the original tubing.  I also made the end that
passes through the front tin a bit longer to move the rubber hose
further from the #3 exhaust pipe.  For a bushing, I use a piece of
thick inner tube rubber wrapped around and around the metal line and
then shoved into the front tin hole.  Others like the Hoover fitting
made using lamp parts.
<P>
When replacing hoses, don't forget that there is a hose that runs from
the fuel tank to the metal line in front of the engine.  This line is
under the bus and is the usual culprit in "engine" fires.
<P>
OK, your bus is fireproof, but one day you are rolling down the road
and come upon another bus owned by someone who doesn't read the list. 
There is a fire starting and smoke starting to billow.  What do you do?
<P>
OK, grab that big fire extinguisher and exit your bus (leaving it at
least 20 yards from the burning vehicle).  Ready your extinguisher for
action, but don't get trigger happy.  First determine where the fire
is.  
<P>
If it's under the bus, you'll see smoke billowing up the sides but not
so much from the vents.  If it's under the bus it's pretty hard to put
out, but you might try laying on the left side of the bus and trying
to hit the flames from the side.  
<P>
If it's in the engine bay, the lid will have to be opened up so that
you can shoot the flames.  This is tricky, as the original poster has
found.  The thing to remember is that fire tends to go upward, so if
the thing flares at you you need to go down and away to the rear. 
Wait for the flare to subside, then attack the flame.
<P>
There are no half-measures when using a fire extinguisher.  Once you
hit that trigger, keep it down until the extinguisher is exhausted. 
If you use half the extinguisher and then the fire reignites, do you
think you will kill it with the other half of the extinguisher?  Not
likely!  It costs exactly the same to fill an empty extinguisher as a
half-full extinguisher, so go ahead and shoot the works.
<P>
Before you attack a fire, you need to ask yourself if the vehicle you
might save is worth the risk to your own life and limb.  As much as it
pains me to see a bus burnt to the ground, I would _really_ hate to
see anyone hurt in the process of trying to save one, even my own. 
The decision to fight a fire is yours alone and you should consider
your options carefully before rushing into danger.
<P>
OK, rant over.  I feel much better now.
