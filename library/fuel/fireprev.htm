<h3>Preventing and Fighting a Bus Fire</h3>

<p><font size="+1">OK, it's time for George's Fairly-Annual Fuel
and Fire Rant:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">(This rant is obviously aimed at Type 1 engines,
others edit as needed!)</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The absolute best way to put out an engine fire
is to _not_ have one in the first place. That means that you need
to replace rubber fuel hoses regularly. Don't replace them
"tomorrow" or "when I get around to it" or "the next time the
engine is out". Replace them in January of every even-numbered
year, or devise your own system of timing. Every leaking fuel hose
was "just fine" a month before the leak, and the only way to avoid
problems is to make sure that the hoses don't get old enough to
have problems. They get old fast with the witch's brew they call
gasoline these days!</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Be sure to use the proper metric size fuel hose
and install it in a workmanlike manner. That means hose clamps on
all pressurized connections (or all connections if you are paranoid
like me).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Be sure that the fuel ports on the fuel pump and
carb are tight by giving 'em a good tug with a pair of pliers. If
they come out, clean them up with carb cleaner, let dry, rough up
the surface of the tube by rolling it with a file, put a thin coat
of JB-Weld (or other fuel-proof epoxy) on the roughed up surface,
tap the tube back into place, and let cure. Really paranoid folks
safety-wire the hoses to the fuel pump. Those little in-line
filters aren't such a good idea. If you want to use a filter, get a
metal one and make sure that it is secured properly.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">When replacing the hoses, cast a jaundiced eye
on the metal fuel line where it passes through the front tin. There
should be a rubber bushing in this hole, but it is often missing.
The tin will cut through the metal line. This will cause a fuel
leak on both sides of the firewall and if a fire starts here it
will be almost impossible to put out. If the bushing is missing,
check the metal line for a groove and replace it if a groove is
present. I've found that Chevy pickup brake tubing (scavenged from
a wreck) is just the correct OD and has a thicker wall than the
original tubing. I also made the end that passes through the front
tin a bit longer to move the rubber hose further from the #3
exhaust pipe. For a bushing, I use a piece of thick inner tube
rubber wrapped around and around the metal line and then shoved
into the front tin hole. Others like the Hoover fitting made using
lamp parts.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">When replacing hoses, don't forget that there is
a hose that runs from the fuel tank to the metal line in front of
the engine. This line is under the bus and is the usual culprit in
"engine" fires.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">OK, your bus is fireproof, but one day you are
rolling down the road and come upon another bus owned by someone
who doesn't read the list. There is a fire starting and smoke
starting to billow. What do you do?</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">OK, grab that big fire extinguisher and exit
your bus (leaving it at least 20 yards from the burning vehicle).
Ready your extinguisher for action, but don't get trigger happy.
First determine where the fire is.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">If it's under the bus, you'll see smoke
billowing up the sides but not so much from the vents. If it's
under the bus it's pretty hard to put out, but you might try laying
on the left side of the bus and trying to hit the flames from the
side.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">If it's in the engine bay, the lid will have to
be opened up so that you can shoot the flames. This is tricky, as
the original poster has found. The thing to remember is that fire
tends to go upward, so if the thing flares at you you need to go
down and away to the rear. Wait for the flare to subside, then
attack the flame.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">There are no half-measures when using a fire
extinguisher. Once you hit that trigger, keep it down until the
extinguisher is exhausted. If you use half the extinguisher and
then the fire reignites, do you think you will kill it with the
other half of the extinguisher? Not likely! It costs exactly the
same to fill an empty extinguisher as a half-full extinguisher, so
go ahead and shoot the works.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Before you attack a fire, you need to ask
yourself if the vehicle you might save is worth the risk to your
own life and limb. As much as it pains me to see a bus burnt to the
ground, I would _really_ hate to see anyone hurt in the process of
trying to save one, even my own. The decision to fight a fire is
yours alone and you should consider your options carefully before
rushing into danger.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">OK, rant over. I feel much better
now.<br></font></p>
