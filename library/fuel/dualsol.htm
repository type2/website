<h3>Dual Solex Adjustment</h3>

<p><font size="+1">First, check your plugs, wires, and points. Set
everything to specs. Check for vacuum leaks. Make sure your timing
isn't too far off. No point fiddling with the carbs till this is
done - it will be time wasted.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Now turn two side screws in then 2.5 turns out
as described. Start bus. On left carb, turn in the side idle
adjustment screw until the RPM starts to drop. Stop and back it out
1/2 turn. Do the same on the other carb. If these screws are
misadjusted (too far in) it will cause the engine to backfire
during deceleration (my experience).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Now pull all four wires at the coil one at a
time and make sure the RPM drops an approximately equal amount for
the left and right banks of cylinders. If so, you have the idle
mixture set fairly well, and your idle shutoff solenoids are
working (ugh). If you have a dead cylinder at idle it's probably
either the mixture screw overtightened or a bad shutoff
solenoid.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Now fiddle with the small adjustment screw on
the top of the left carb. On my bus, it doesn't seem to make much
difference where it is set, so I just set it 2.5 turns out and
leave it. The bus runs fine.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">One other thing I have found with the dual
carbs: it is VERY important that the linkage is set to open them at
the same time. Tug slightly on the accelerator cable where it
attaches to the crossbar (don't grab any part of the crossbar
though!) and watch the stops on each carb. Make sure that the
linkages are beginning to move at exactly the same time. Also check
that the accelerator pumps are being actuated at the same time.
Adjust the linkage if necessary. For me, this almost always makes a
HUGE difference in driveability. The carbs being slightly off makes
your part throttle acceleration suffer badly.</font></p>
<blockquote><font size="+1"><i>"Also one more problem, carb
related. When cold, the engine idles nice and fast and smoothly,
but after its warmed up, and I kick down the choke, it idles too
slowly and backfires (popcorn sound) alot. I have repeatedly set
the idle to 900rpm, at operating temp, but it keeps returning to
the slow idle. Is it possible that when my mixture is set correctly
this will straighten itself out, or is there something else
amiss?"</i></font></blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">I had a similar problem where when warm it would
idle slow. Flooring the throttle briefly usually brought back the
high idle. In my case it was the large solenoid that shuts off the
air to the idle circuit. It's in the very front of the left carb,
horizontal. It was sticking closed. I have several of the solenoids
and they ALL stick. I finally removed it, put a washer over it, and
reinstalled it (so it's about 1/8" farther out now). No more slow
idle.</font></p>
