No, you cannot swap ECU's between Fed and Cal Vanagons: 
<p>
 California Models: 
<br>
 071-906-021B All Transmissions 1980-1983 
<p>
 Federal Models: 
<br>
 039-906-021E Manual Trans 1980-1983 
<br>
 039-906-021C Automatic 1980-1983 
<p>
 Only Vanagon ECU's will work in a Vanagon. 
<p>
 The ONLY aircooled ECU in all the Fresno and Madera self-serve yards is a Fed manual one in Westside Auto Dismantling. The one in Pick n Pull is a melted glob...... I have been looking for a Calif ECU for over a month. 
 It seems like all the Vanagons showing up are wasserboxers. Pick a Part in Fresno just put out a complete 84. Pick a Part in Madera has a later, Wolfsberg edition Vanagon
<p>
 Not sure why Bus Boys says the 80-83 manual ECU is the same as the 79 Cal auto ECU.
 <p>
 The 79 Cal auto trans ECU Bosch short number is C105X. 
<br>
 The 79 Cal manual trans ECU Bosch short number is C104X. 
<br>
 That is all these C numbers fit. 
<p>
 A while back someone asked what the difference was between all the ECU's on bay window buses. VW/Bosch made 4 per year model. Cal auto and Cal manual, Fed auto and Fed manual. I said I have never felt a diference in any of them when I test them in my 77 Westy. With that in mind, I just went to my EKTA disc to see what VW says the part number of the ECU should be. 
<p>
 That 039-906-021B that Bus Boys says fits fits 79 Cal manual trans.... well EKTA says it is the ONLY ECU available for ALL transmissions in these applications: 
<p>
 1) Calif, from the start of the 77 year model to the end of the 78 year model 
<br>
 2) ALL Fed bay buses from 77 to the end of 79. 
 EKTA does not show it for 79 Cal! 
<br>
 3) ALL aircooled Fed Vanagons, 80 to 83.5. 
<p>
 The Calif Vanagon is 071-906-021B 
<p>
 No wonder I never felt a difference! There isn't one.
