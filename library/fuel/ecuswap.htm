<h3>ECU Swaps</h3>
<p>by Karl von Salzen</p>
<hr size="2">
<p><font size="+1"><code>No, you cannot swap ECU's between Fed and
Cal Vanagons:</code></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><code>California Models:<br>
071-906-021B All Transmissions 1980-1983</code></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><code>Federal Models:<br>
039-906-021E Manual Trans 1980-1983<br>
039-906-021C Automatic 1980-1983</code></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><code>Only Vanagon ECU's will work in a
Vanagon.</code></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><code>The ONLY aircooled ECU in all the Fresno
and Madera self-serve yards is a Fed manual one in Westside Auto
Dismantling. The one in Pick n Pull is a melted glob...... I have
been looking for a Calif ECU for over a month. It seems like all
the Vanagons showing up are wasserboxers. Pick a Part in Fresno
just put out a complete 84. Pick a Part in Madera has a later,
Wolfsberg edition Vanagon</code></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><code>Not sure why Bus Boys says the 80-83
manual ECU is the same as the 79 Cal auto ECU.</code></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><code>The 79 Cal auto trans ECU Bosch short
number is C105X.<br>
The 79 Cal manual trans ECU Bosch short number is C104X.<br>
That is all these C numbers fit.</code></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><code>A while back someone asked what the
difference was between all the ECU's on bay window buses. VW/Bosch
made 4 per year model. Cal auto and Cal manual, Fed auto and Fed
manual. I said I have never felt a diference in any of them when I
test them in my 77 Westy. With that in mind, I just went to my EKTA
disc to see what VW says the part number of the ECU should
be.</code></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><code>That 039-906-021B that Bus Boys says fits
fits 79 Cal manual trans.... well EKTA says it is the ONLY ECU
available for ALL transmissions in these
applications:</code></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><code>1) Calif, from the start of the 77 year
model to the end of the 78 year model<br>
2) ALL Fed bay buses from 77 to the end of 79. EKTA does not show
it for 79 Cal!<br>
3) ALL aircooled Fed Vanagons, 80 to 83.5.</code></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><code>The Calif Vanagon is
071-906-021B</code></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><code>No wonder I never felt a difference! There
isn't one.</code><br></font></p>
