<h3>VW Fuel Injection System Types</h3>
<p>by Jim Thompson</p>

<p><font size="+1">Quotes from the Bentley/Probst "Bosch Fuel
Injection & Engine Management Manual:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>D-Jetronic:</b> The first Bosch Jetronic
System. The D is short for Druck, the German word for pressure.
Manifold pressure is measured to indicate the engine load (how much
air the engine is using). This pressure is an input signal to the
control unit (ECU) for calculation of the correct amount of fuel
delivery.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>L-Jetronic:</b> The L is short for Luft, the
German word for air. Air flow into the engine is measured by an
air-flow sensor with a movable vane to indicate the engine
load.....L-Jetronic was often called Air-Flow Controlled (AFC)
injection to further separate it from the pressure-controlled
D-Jetronic.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">(My note: "Digijet" is the same as L-Jetronic
with a few VW add-ons. It's a licensed system from
Bosch).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>LH-Jetronic:</b> LH-Jetronic measures air
mass (weight of air) with a hot-wire sensor instead of measuring
air flow with an air vane (volume of air) as in L-Jetronic.
Otherwise, L and LH systems are very similar. The H is short for
Heiss, the German word for hot.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>K-Ketronic:</b> The first continuous system.
Bosch called it a K, for Kontinuerlich, the German word for
continuous. Air flow is measured by a circular plate in the
air-flow sensor. Until 1980, fuel delivery is strictly under
mechanical control in direct relationship to air flow; there are no
electronics.....Volkswagen, Audi and Mercedes call this
CIS.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>KE-Jetronic:</b> This combines K-Jetronic
mechanical control with total electronic modulation of the mixture.
It uses many of the sames sensors used in L-Jetronic systems.
Because it is based on K-Jetronic, it is still capable of fail-safe
mechanical operation if the electronics fail....Volkswagen, Audi
and Mercedes called it CIS-E</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Motronic:</b> The first "engine-management"
system. It combines L-Jetronic pulsed fuel injection with
electronic ignition timing control in one control unit. In most
engines, it also has electronic idle stabilization for a complete
engine-management system.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Volkswagen Digifant:</b> This pulsed system
was partly designed by Volkswagen, but operates pretty much as
Bosch Motronic does. It's timing control is less complicated than
the Bosch Motronic map. It does not have a knock sensor.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">(My note: VW Digifant II does have a knock
sensor.)</font></p>
