<h3>Bartnik's Jetronic Reference</h3>
<p>by Sean Bartnik</p>
<hr size="2">
<p><font size="+1">A lot of people dislike the Bosch L-Jetronic
fuel injection system fitted to the 411 and 412 in 1971 and the
Beetle, Super Beetle, and Bus in 1975. Most of the complaints seem
to stem from the fear of the unknown. They don't understand the
system and so are afraid of it and rip it off to put some junk carb
on their engines, then they wonder why they run like crap.
:-)</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">In reality, the L-Jetronic system is very
simple, very reliable, and easy to diagnose. All you need for
diagnostic tools is a fuel pressure gauge and a multimeter, and a
manual. The Bentely manual does an excellent job of explaining FI
diagnostic procedures. Most people blame ignition system problems
on the fuel injection and go on a parts-replacing spree, wasting
unnecessary money. So it is imperative that before diagnosing the
fuel injection system, the ignition system must be in tip-top
shape.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">This part of the Tech Page endeavors to explain
the functions of the various fuel injection parts so that the
seeminly mysterious fuel injection system will be revealed for what
it is: a bunch of simple parts working together. I will try to have
photos here as soon as possible.</font></p>
