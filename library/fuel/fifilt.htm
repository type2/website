<h3>Fuel Filters for Fuel Injected Buses

<p> 
I have not been impressed with the Bosch Fuel Injection or Filters
Catalog over the past several years due to inaccuracies particular to the
Vanagon Fuel Filters.  I find that when using the VW Parts Film for
filter look-up, it's far more accurate than the Bosch, which is why I
posted the applications and Bosch Numbers in an earlier posting as per VW
Parts Film.  Almost everytime I have used the Bosch Book, especially for
Wasserboxers, it's been wrong.  When double-checked with the VW Parts
Film, I have always found the correct filter everytime and the listing
didn't always jibe with Bosch's.
