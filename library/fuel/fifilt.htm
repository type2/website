<h3>Fuel Filters for Fuel Injected Buses</h3>
<p>by Jim Thompson</p>
<hr size="2">
<p><font size="+1">I have not been impressed with the Bosch Fuel
Injection or Filters Catalog over the past several years due to
inaccuracies particular to the Vanagon Fuel Filters. I find that
when using the VW Parts Film for filter look-up, it's far more
accurate than the Bosch, which is why I posted the applications and
Bosch Numbers in an earlier posting as per VW Parts Film. Almost
everytime I have used the Bosch Book, especially for Wasserboxers,
it's been wrong. When double-checked with the VW Parts Film, I have
always found the correct filter everytime and the listing didn't
always jibe with Bosch's.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">To reiterate:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">VW 133-133-511 (Bosch 0450 901 005)(Short Bosch
