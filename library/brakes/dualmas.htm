<p><font size="+1"><u>List of needed parts:</u></font></p>
<ol>
<li><font size="+1">1971 or later disc brake master
cylinder</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Short metal brake line</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Two longer master cylinder mounting
bolts</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">VW Rabbit or 1967 only bus brake fluid
reservoir</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Optional spacer</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Optional bolt (in place of cutting original
push rod)</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font size="+1">Total cost is about $50.00 and a couple of hours
under your bus, resulting in a much safer braking
system.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">If you have a 1967 bus and want to use a master
cylinder that's much less than 1/5 the price or you have a pre-1967
bus with single circuit brakes, here is a conversion for you and
your bus's safety! Remember that on the single circuit brake system
if a single slave (wheel) cylinder, flexible brake line, metal
brake line (yes, metal brake lines can rust from the inside out!),
or even the master cylinder leaks half the system dry or bursts
from the up to 1200PSI in the brake system: you loose all hydraulic
brake control. "So what," you say, "I have an emergency brake!"
Have you tried to stop with only the emergency brake? Especially on
a downhill or from high speed in a short distance? Now try
imagining having one of the rear slave (wheel) cylinders burst and
soak the brake linings on that side with slippery brake fluid,
resulting in not only no hydraulic brakes but only half of the
wimpy E-brake working properly! With dual circuit you end up with
at least half of your brakes still working in such an emergency
instead of almost none.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The best conversion for the 1955-67 (and this
would probably fit just the same in the barndoors, pre-March 1955
buses) is the 1971 and later dual circuit brake cylinder for disc
brakes. For the pre-dual circuit buses you need a brass T-fitting
and a short metal brake line to it (about 100-150mm, or 4-6" long,
which can be scavanged from the front disc brakes of a 1971 and
later bus).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Rig the two front brake metal lines into a brass
T-fitting with a short metal line going to the outlet on the
underside of the master cylinder. This brass T-fitting can be
scavanged from any VW from where the single metal brake line
running to the rear splits into the two lines going to the rear
wheels. In other words, plumb the two front metal brake lines up
just like a 1967 bus front brake lines. Be careful not to mix up
the rear metal brake line with the left front metal brake line.
They both run right next to each other for several feet and are
easy to mix up, resulting in a bus that pulls to the right when
braking.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Then plumb the short metal brake line for the
front brakes to curve around and under to the port that is under
and at a 45 degree angle out of the bottom of the 1971 & later
master cylinder. This outlet in this late master cylinder in its
stock application is for one of the brake light senders, but if the
sender is used in pre-1968 bus you can not install the belly panel
which keeps the dirt, dust and rocks from the master cylinder,
cables and linkages for controling the bus. Make sure to bend the
metal brake lines in curves, not angles that would pinch off the
flow.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">You need a reservoir from a Rabbit, or better
yet, a 1967 only bus reservoir. Check your local wrecking yards for
either of these. These reservoirs are a snap fit into the seals in
the master cylinder. To remove, grip them firmly with both hands
and pull as straight up as possible. When you install either of
these resevoirs put the fill cap end closest to the piston end of
the MC so you can refill the resevoir through the stock hole in the
bus front floor. Go ahead and use two brake senders in this new
master cylinder and use the sender for the rear brakes as your
primary. If this sender fails on a trip you can just switch the
brake wires to the front brake sender, and replace the rear one as
soon as you get back to civilization.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The two mounting bolts for the master cylinder
will have to be 12.5-19mm, 1/2-3/4" longer than stock. You will
have to shorten with a hacksaw and file the push rod and the
bracket it threads into so the lock nut does not touch the master
cylinder piston, or like one fellow says, use a shorter bolt and
cut off the head instead of wasting the original push rod. Either
way, make sure to file the shorter push rod end so it has the same
rounded end as the push rod did before, and the shortened bracket
flat so the lock nut sits flatly on it.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">While all this will work this way it is bugger
to adjust the push rod. Make sure to adjust the push rod for about
.75mm, or 1/32" of play between the push rod end and the master
cylinder piston. Check often to make sure this play still exists
over the first 62KM, or 100 miles. If the play disappears expect
brakes that drag and lock due to not releasing brake fluid
pressure. You end up having to unbolt the master cylinder to adjust
the push rod due to lack of room. If you have time now or later,
build a 6-7mm, or 1/4" spacer (must be more than just some washers
around the mounting bolts!) to go between the master cylinder and
its mounting bracket on the bus to make the push rod far easier to
adjust. Whichever you do, do NOT cut the front of the master
cylinder piston at all. When all is installed, make sure that the
metal brake lines are a minimum of 25.4mm, or 1" away from and
moving linkages and cables or you run the possibility of having a
brake line worn through. Have a friend operate your pedals,
shifter, and emergency brake while you lie underneath to make sure
that nothing gets too close!</font></p>
