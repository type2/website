<h3>Teflon Hose / Stainless Steel Brake Lines

The various recent comments regarding replacement Teflon / stainless
steel brake lines leads me to believe that a dose of information is in
order...
<P>  
Years ago, I worked as a project engineer designing and manufacturing
fluid systems, including just about every type of hose.  Making hoses
was definitely the boring part of the job, but it was our bread and
butter ;-)
<P>  
While the steel (or other material) braided over a hose liner does
serve to protect the liner, its primary function is to _reinforce_ the
liner. A plain Teflon tube will only take a small amount of pressure,
and tends to kink very easily when flexed. Adding braid creates a hose
capable of handling very high pressures, and actually improves
flexibility somewhat.
<P>  
The hose wears out when the braid wires fatigue or corrode, or if it
is damaged. The Teflon doesn't age, and is unaffected by brake fluid
(and just about everything else).  The Teflon hoses are favored in
high-performance applications because (a) they have an effectively
infinite working life, if the proper hose is properly installed, and
(b) the Teflon liner doesn't "give" under pressure like a rubber liner
does, so hydraulic systems function more crisply and efficiently.
<P>  
In racing, military, aircraft, etc. applications, hydraulic hoses and
systems get pressure-tested, typically to 1.5 x working pressure, on a
regular basis to find bad components before they fail in service.
<P>  
The pressure-testing on your Bus happens every time you step on the
brake pedal... and the consequences of failure could be dire.  DOT
certification gives peace of mind for a couple of reasons: you can be
sure that the hose has the correct pressure rating for your vehicle,
and is sufficiently high that failure is extremely unlikely; the
manufacturer proof-tests the hoses to verify that they will take
pressures well in excess of what they will see in your vehicle; and if
there's a failure and an accident results, the manufacturer has
liability insurance.
<P>  
If you want to specify a Teflon / SS hose assembly to use for your
brake lines, then by all means be sure that you get them from a
reputable supplier, and that they are tested at proof pressure. There
are plenty of little shops around that will slap together hose
assemblies of very poor quality, and I'm sure you'd agree that it's
not worth taking chances with your brake lines. Teflon hose assemblies
are quite a bit trickier to build than are rubber hoses.
<P> 
A final word -- be *very careful* installing Teflon hoses on your Bus
-- Teflon hoses will kink very easily, and once kinked they shouldn't
be used. They are not as forgiving as rubber hoses. Doing a brake job?
Replacing ball joints?  Watch out for those brake lines!
