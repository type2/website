<h3>Teflon Hose / Stainless Steel Brake Lines</h3>
<p>by Chad Frost</p>
<hr size="2">
<p><font size="+1">The various recent comments regarding
replacement Teflon / stainless steel brake lines leads me to
believe that a dose of information is in order...</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Years ago, I worked as a project engineer
designing and manufacturing fluid systems, including just about
every type of hose. Making hoses was definitely the boring part of
the job, but it was our bread and butter ;-)</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">While the steel (or other material) braided over
a hose liner does serve to protect the liner, its primary function
is to _reinforce_ the liner. A plain Teflon tube will only take a
small amount of pressure, and tends to kink very easily when
flexed. Adding braid creates a hose capable of handling very high
pressures, and actually improves flexibility somewhat.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The hose wears out when the braid wires fatigue
or corrode, or if it is damaged. The Teflon doesn't age, and is
unaffected by brake fluid (and just about everything else). The
Teflon hoses are favored in high-performance applications because
(a) they have an effectively infinite working life, if the proper
hose is properly installed, and (b) the Teflon liner doesn't "give"
under pressure like a rubber liner does, so hydraulic systems
function more crisply and efficiently.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">In racing, military, aircraft, etc.
applications, hydraulic hoses and systems get pressure-tested,
typically to 1.5 x working pressure, on a regular basis to find bad
components before they fail in service.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The pressure-testing on your Bus happens every
time you step on the brake pedal... and the consequences of failure
could be dire. DOT certification gives peace of mind for a couple
of reasons: you can be sure that the hose has the correct pressure
rating for your vehicle, and is sufficiently high that failure is
extremely unlikely; the manufacturer proof-tests the hoses to
verify that they will take pressures well in excess of what they
will see in your vehicle; and if there's a failure and an accident
results, the manufacturer has liability insurance.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">If you want to specify a Teflon / SS hose
assembly to use for your brake lines, then by all means be sure
that you get them from a reputable supplier, and that they are
tested at proof pressure. There are plenty of little shops around
that will slap together hose assemblies of very poor quality, and
I'm sure you'd agree that it's not worth taking chances with your
brake lines. Teflon hose assemblies are quite a bit trickier to
build than are rubber hoses.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">A final word -- be *very careful* installing
Teflon hoses on your Bus -- Teflon hoses will kink very easily, and
once kinked they shouldn't be used. They are not as forgiving as
rubber hoses. Doing a brake job? Replacing ball joints? Watch out
for those brake lines!</font></p>
