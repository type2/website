<h3>Brakes Pulling--Rubber Hoses

If one of the hoses is plugged up front it is very noticable
when you brake.  It is really easy to tell if you have a plugged line.  
Open one of the bleeder nipples in front and attach a hose to it 
(like bleeding the lines).  If when you press
the pedal there is resistance the hose is plugged.  The brake pedal
should almost fall to the floor when the bleeder valve is open.
I've been through this about 5 times now, and it appears that all
the brake lines will eventually plug up as the inside diameter goes
to 0 after about 25 years.  Yep, VWs will last forever, but the parts
do fail now and then. ;)
