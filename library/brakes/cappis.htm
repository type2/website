"None of the rebuilders bother aligning the
pistons, and or replacing the retaining plates. 
I don't know what the retaining plates do."

What they do, for all I know, is allow one end of the pad to contact the disc
just a bit before the other, allowing smooth engagement and reducing
noise.  You'll notice that the retaining plates are mirror images of
each other, and shouldn't be swapped left-to-right.

I used a small set of channel-locks <B>inside</B> the piston.  You can pull
the handle apart and wedge the head of the tool inside the hollow of
the piston, then turn the piston.  Actually, it turned pretty easily,
so you  could probably just push it around with a screwdriver on the
"step" of the piston.

Yes, I've noticed that the cutout on the piston is designed to
apply force unequally to cause "toe-in" on the pads just like on bicycle
brake pads!   I presume the backing plates are to keep the alignment of
this piston uneqality, or they could rotate out of position!  If I find the
plate "flattened" I punch out the tabs so they can hold the piston.
