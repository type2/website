<h3>Caliper Piston Orientation</h3>
<p>by George Lyle and Michael Benthin</p>

<blockquote><font size="+1"><i>"None of the rebuilders bother
aligning the pistons, and or replacing the retaining plates. I
don't know what the retaining plates do."</i></font></blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">George Lyle writes:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">What they do, for all I know, is allow one end
of the pad to contact the disc just a bit before the other,
allowing smooth engagement and reducing noise. You'll notice that
the retaining plates are mirror images of each other, and shouldn't
be swapped left-to-right.</font></p>
<blockquote><font size="+1"><i>"The Bentley shows a special tool
for orienting the pistons"</i></font></blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">I used a small set of channel-locks
<b>inside</b> the piston. You can pull the handle apart and wedge
the head of the tool inside the hollow of the piston, then turn the
piston. Actually, it turned pretty easily, so you could probably
just push it around with a screwdriver on the "step" of the
piston.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Michael Benthin writes:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Yes, I've noticed that the cutout on the piston
is designed to apply force unequally to cause "toe-in" on the pads
just like on bicycle brake pads! I presume the backing plates are
to keep the alignment of this piston uneqality, or they could
rotate out of position! If I find the plate "flattened" I punch out
the tabs so they can hold the piston.</font></p>
