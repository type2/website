<h3>Brake Adjuster Spring Steel Retainers</h3>
<p>by Brian Verbeek</p>
<hr size="2">
<blockquote><font size="+1"><i>"I know that at least one of the
little bits of spring steel that attach to the block that the stars
ride in is gone, and others are most likely weak. I also know that
these blocks are NLA."</i></font></blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">The rear backing plates as a whole were only
discontinued recently here in Europe. I have two new ones on my
'73, they listed $55 ex tax each. I had them zincplated. From time
to time you see NOS earlier backing plates being offered at the
shows for around $30 to $40 each.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The funny thing about the new plates is that
they didn't have holes for pins and springs that keep them shoes to
the plates--they don't have to be used anymore.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">As for the little flat spring that keeps the
adjuster stars from turning, look around at the shows, or order
them for a drum brake Porsche 356. The 356 fronts have two
adjusters per side, with one seperate spring each. These are held
to the adjuster housing with a small 4mm screw. You can drill and
tap and screw it on there and it can be replaced easily. Most early
Porsche parts are available from the Porsche dealer and surely from
all Porsche parts houses.</font></p>
