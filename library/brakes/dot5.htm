<h3>DOT3/DOT4 to DOT5 Brake Fluid Conversion</h3>
<p>by Dave Barbieri</p>
<hr size="2">
<p><font size="+1">Since I don't do 'conversions', I wanted to talk
to some of our brake vendors (TX & CA) and get my facts straight.
Here's the procedure recommended:</font></p>
<ol>
<li><font size="+1">Use a turkey baster to suck all the old fluid
out of the master cylinder reservoir. Fill the reservoir with
rubbing alcohol. Get about 5 bottles; yer gonna need 'em.
8-P</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Bleed the system, just like you would normally.
Keep bleeding each wheel cylinder/caliper until only rubbing
alcohol comes out. When all you see is <b>only</b> clean, clear
rubbing alcohol, you're thru with the flushing.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Take all the brake lines loose at both ends.
Use filtered, dry compressed air to blow out <b>all</b> alcohol.
The lines <b>must</b> be free of all traces of alcohol.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Remove the master cylinder and wheel
cylinders/calipers. Disassemble each component, clean thoroughly
with either hot soapy water/hot water rinse or with a commercial
non-filming brake cleaner. Dry each part and reassemble using DOT5
brake fluid as lubricant.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Components such as the combination valve will
have alcohol in them from the flushing procedure. Blowing them out
will be pretty touchy. Too much air and you 'blow out' the valve,
too little and you don't get rid of the alcohol.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Re-install all the parts, fill the reservoir
with DOT5 fluid, and bleed as normal.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font size="+1">There's not complete agreement on how DOT5
reacts with DOT3/4. Some tech reps said it forms a gummy residue
that affects brake action. Two stated that the DOT5 would simply
'flush out' any traces of alcohol/DOT3/4 during the bleeding
process. Since there's not 100% agreement, (and I'm both
anal-retentive and paranoid when it comes to brakes), I listed the
full procedure.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Do you really, reeeelly wanna do this? DOT5 is
typically used in heavy eqyuipment, military vehicles, and (some)
antique vehicles. All share the same characteristic of sitting for
long periods of time. DOT5 gets rid of any concern about moisture
absorption while sitting idle.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">DOT5 is expensive and a PITA; I think you'll
spend a lot of time and $$, only to be disappointed with the actual
performance gains.</font></p>
