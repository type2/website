<h3>Brake Reservoirs</h3>
<p>by Karl von Salzen</p>
<hr size="2">
<p><font size="+1"><code>71-73 used a square upper reservoir behind
the seat.<br>
68-70 were under the dash at the top of the kick panel.<br>
74-79 were down by the front of the seat.</code></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><code>The 71-73 square ones are very robust. As
well as the plastic tubing. But the rubber sleeves are crap. They
are still available at the dealer or from Bus Depot [he probably
gets them from the dealer since his price and VW list price is the
same]</code></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><code>Part # for the sleeve is 211 611
833.</code><br></font></p>
