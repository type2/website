 71-73 used a square upper reservoir behind the seat. 
<br>
68-70 were under the dash at the top of the kick panel. 
<br>
 74-79 were down by the front of the seat. 
<p>
 The 71-73 square ones are very robust. As well as the plastic tubing. But the rubber sleeves are crap. They are still available at the dealer or from Bus Depot [he probably gets them from the dealer since his price and VW list price is the same]
 <p>
 Part # for the sleeve is 211 611 833.</code>
