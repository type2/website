<h3>Vacuum Brake Booster Test Procedure</h3>
<p>by H Steve Dolan</p>
<hr size="2">
<p><font size="+1">If the booster is working correctly, it should
have no noticable effect on the engine, but if it is leaking, it
will cause big problems. Use the following procedure to check
yours.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><u>Things you need:</u></font></p>
<ul>
<li><font size="+1">Vacuum guage</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Cap for vacuum port on the intake
manifold</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Friend to work brake pedal</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Pencil and paper</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font size="+1"><u>Procedure:</u></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Hook up the vac guage. Start the engine. Note
the reading. This is your "base" reading.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Stop the engine, disconnect the booster vacuum
line and cap the port on the manifold. Start the engine, look at
the guage. If this reading is substantally higher than the base,
you have a leak in the system, probably in the lines leading to the
booster.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Stop the engine, remove and test the one-way
valve (should be able to blow into it one way but not the other).
Air should only pass in the direction indicated by the arrow
printed on the top of the valve (make sure to reinstall it in the
correct direction).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Reconnect the one way valve and vacuum line to
the manifold and start the engine. Watch the vac guage as a friend
depresses the brake pedal. It should dip as the pedal is depressed
and return to the base reading. If it drops slowly, but returns,
you have a blockage/collapse in the vac line. If it falls and does
not return, you have a torn diaphram in the booster. Especially
indicative of a torn diaphram is a hissing when the pedal is
depressed.</font></p>
