Any remedies on how to cure stuck caliper pistons?

<LI> Compressed air in the brake line opening.  Put a piece of wood or 
something else soft to catch the piston as it comes out of the bore 
so not to mar the piston surfaces
<P>
or my favorite

<LI> Screw a zerk fitting into the caliper (or wheel cylinder) brake line 
opening and use a lever arm grease gun to gently force the piston out.

If you use a grease gun, clean the caliper or wheel cylinder completely 
before re-assembly.  I soak them in carb cleaner overnight, rinse, blow 
out with compressed air, do a final rinse with brake cleaner, then blow 
out with compressed air again.  Always replace the o-rings & seals if you 
do this.
