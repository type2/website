<p><font size="+1">Are you getting all of your stopping power?? The
importance of brake flushing</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Brake fade is somewhat akin to brain fade.
Reaction time is slower, usually snappy performance is replaced by
a dull, mushy feel, and in critical situations the slow response
time can be disasterous. While there are several mechanical reasons
for this type of condition, one of the most overlooked causes is
contaminated brake fluid. Most car owners are well aware of the
importance of maintaining proper fluid levels in the vehicle, and
reliably check to make sure that the brake fluid is mainained
between the minimum and maximum marks on the reservoir. After all,
if there's too little fluid, it's possible for air to be sucked
into the lines, which can result in a spongy pedal feel and
inefficient braking performance.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The importance of flushing the brake system ...
taking the old fluid and replacing it with new ... is often not so
well recognized. In fact, a few years ago, Motor Trend Senior Road
Editor Mac DeMere needed to get his vehicle's brake system flushed
and call a local gas station for a price. The person he talked to
... even with never having seen Mac's car ... told him that
procedure wasn't necessary. When Mac pressed for a price anyway,
the person again fervently stated that his vehicle's brake fluid
didn't need to be changed. Finally, Mac simply called elsewhere.
One of the problems is that flushing the brake system if often not
specifically listed in many vehicle's routine maintenance schedule,
which could cause an unknowledgeable person to think that the
procedure wasn't necessary. In fact, manufacturers usually specify
a general inspection of the brake system and leave it up to the
mechanic to know when to flush the fluid.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Why is flushing important? Conventional
glycol-based brake fluid is hygroscopic, which means that it
absorbs water. This is important, in order to keep condensation in
the brake system from causing corrosion. However, eventually, the
fluid will absorb all the moisture it can hold, reaching its point
of saturation. Several things can happen at this point. Unabsorbed
moisture can begin to collect in the system, causing corrosion in
critical areas; the water can cause seals to swell and deteriorate,
further contaminating the fluid; and the boiling point of of the
fluid drops beyond recommended levels. This means that under
high-heat braking conditions, such as during hard braking or
repeated brake application while descending a mountain, the fluid
will start boiling sooner, which will reduce braking performance.
The pedal can begin to feel spongy, and as braking efficiency
drops, it takes longer to stop the vehicle.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">How do you know when the system should be
flushed? Most maintenance schedules that do specify it recommend
changing the fluid every two years or 30,000 miles. If you live in
an unusually humid climate, it's better to plan on doing it every
year. However, your eyes can tell you when the time has come. Fresh
brake fluid is transparent and has a slight amber-colored look. As
the fluid absorbs moisture, it takes on a darker, cloudy
appearnace, which tells you it needs changing. This can also be
verified empirically. For instance, Phoenix Systems (Dept. MT, 3555
E. 42nd Stravenue, Tucson, AZ 85713; (888) 749-7977), a company
that specializes in professional brake system tools, markets a
Brake Fluid Tester ($370) that reads the boiling point of a sample
of fluid. Fresh brake fluid has a boiling point of about 400
degrees F or higher. As it absorbs moisture, however, the boiling
point will gradually drop. Phoenix Systems recommends that if its
tester shows a fluid's boiling point to be below 330 degrees, the
system should be flushed.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">When adding new brake fluid, be sure it's the
appropriate type for your vehicle; it will be listed in the owner's
manual or marked on the reservoir cover. Conventional glycol-based
formulas are designated as DOT 3 and DOT 4, which differ mainly by
their boiling points. While the two are compatible, DOT 4 has a
higher boiling point, so if your vehicle is designed for DOT 4,
don't substitute DOT 3. If DOT 3 is recommended for your car, you
can use either type. Castrol also markets a brake fluid called LMA,
for Low Moisture Absorption. This is formulated to last longer than
conventional types because it takes longer to reach its saturation
point, and also boasts a higher boiling point.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">It's important to note that DOT 5 brake fluid,
which is silicon-based, is NOT compatible with conventional fluid
and should NEVER be added to a system using DOT 3 or 4. DOT 5,
which has a purple color, doesn't absorb moisture, and has a higher
boiling point. It's NOT recommended very often for late-model cars
because its lack of moisture absorption INcreases the chance of
corrosion, and since it can be compressed, it can cause the brake
pedal to have a spongy feel. It's also much more
expensive.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Certainly never pour any other type of fluid,
such as power steering fluid, ATF, or motor oil into the brake
system, as those petroleum- based fluids will deteriorate the seals
and other rubber components, potentially causing brake failure. In
addition, if using DOT 3 or 4, be careful not to spill brake fluid
on a painted surface, as it can eat away the paint. If this
happens, clean up the spill immediately and wash the area with
plenty of water.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Whenever you add the brake fluid, it should come
from a fresh, sealed container. This is, again, due to its
hygroscopic characteristics. Fluid that has been exposed to air for
any length of time can absorb water vapor, reducing its capacity to
absorb moisture in the brake system. When buying brake fluid then,
always get the smallest container that will do the job. If you're
just topping off a master cylinder, for instance, purchase a small
bottle. If doing a complete flush, get a large container. Any
leftover fluid should be sorted in a tightly sealed bottle and used
within a few weeks. It's false economy to use brake fluid that's
been sitting around for an extended time.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">TIPS for the Do-It-Yourselfer</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Brake flushing is much like bleeding air from
the system. The most common method is the tried-and-true two-person
procedure. It's easier done than described. First remove the lid
from the master cylinder (be sure to clean around the lid first, to
prevent any dirt from falling into the reservoir). Here, you start
at the wheel farthest from the master cylinder, and slip a piece of
clear plastic hose over the bleeder valve; it should fit snugly.
Place the other end of the hose into a clear containe, such as a
glass jar or plastic milk carton, submerged in brake fluid. Have an
assistant pump the brake pedal a few times to build up pressure,
then on a downward stroke, hold the pedal depressed slightly. While
he's holding the pedal down, use a wrench to open the bleeder valve
just enough to let a surge of brake fluid escape into the hose and
container. Your assistant should then slowly depress the pedal to
the floor and hold it there long enough for you to immediately
close the bleeder valve again to prevent air from being drawn back
into the lines.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The key here is to keep the fluid level in the
master cylinder above the minimum mark by repeatedly adding fresh
fluid. Once you begin seeing fresh, clear fluid (with no air
bubbles) coming out of the bleeder valve in place of the old, dark
fluid, you can tighten the valve and move on to the next wheel.
Repeat this procedure on all four wheels, working your way toward
the master cylinder, which should be your last bleeding point
(unless another sequence is recommended in the vehicle's service
manual).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">In these days of modern technology, there are
easier alternatives to this age-old procedure. For instance, you
can buy a bleeder hose with a one-way valve, that allows fluid and
air out, but doesn't let it back in. This eliminates the need to
repeatedly open and close the bleeder valve during each pump of the
pedal. Just make sure that the fit of the hose on the valve is
tight enough that it doesn't allow any air to seep in through the
connection. Russell Performance Products (Dept. MT, 225 Centress
Blvd., Daytona Beach, FL 32114; (904) 253-8980) also makes a
one-way bleeder valve, called the Speed Valve, with which you can
replace your stock valves. This works the same as the one-way hose
and eliminates any concern about air leaks at the connections.
Either method makes it possible for one person to do all the work,
although you still need to check when clear fluid is flowing out of
the valve.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Vacuum pumps, such as the popular Mity-Vac
models made by Neward Enterprises (Dept. MT, 9251 Archibald Ave.,
Rancho Cucamonga, CA 91730; (800) 648-9822), can also be used as a
one-person flushing procedure by drawing fluid out through each
bleeder valve, without the need for someone to pump the brake
pedal. The company also markets the Mityfill Automatic Fluid
Feeder, which can be attached to the master cylinder to provide a
constant supply of fresh brake fluid as you're removing the old
fluid, eliminating the need to be constantly check the fluid
level.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Perhaps the most sophisticated tool for both
bleeding and flushing brake systems is the Phoenix Injector,
produced by Phoenix Systems. This has the capability of either
injecting fluid into the system or pumping it out, to allow a
variety of one-person techniques to be used. For instance, in
split-system designs (most vehicles produced in the last couple of
decades), you can pump fresh fluid into one bleeder valve, while
the old fluid is simultaneously extracted from the opposing valve.
Or the system can be pressure flushed (a professional technique
normally requiring expensive hardware) by pumping fluid through the
system from each master cylinder reservoir port, while again
collecting the old fluid at each bleeder valve. Or it can be used
to vacuum flush a system, acting as a conventional vacuum pump. For
bleeding, the Injector also allows reverse fluid injection, which
removes air bubbles by forcing them upward and out of the master
cylinder, requiring a minimal loss of fluid. The Phoenix Injector
is a professional-caliper instrument, and understandibly isn't
cheap; depending on model, it runs $70 to $305.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Regardless of which flushing method you choose,
when you're done, be sure to top off the level in the reservoir and
install the lid securely. Assuming all mechanical components are in
order, your brake pedal should have a strong, firm, confident feel,
and the system should be working at maximum efficiency, ensuring
you'll get the most from your brakes.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">TIP of the Month: The Masters of Our Own
Cylinders Even if there are no leaks in your car's brake system,
the fluid level in the brake master cylinder will still gradually
go down. This is important to keep track of, because it is a good
indication that it's time to check the vehicle's brake pads and/or
shoes for wear.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">As the friction lining on pads and shoes wears
down, they are pushed out farther to maintain good braking contact
with the rotors or drums. This, in turn, requires that more fluid
be drawn from the master cylinder. Eventually, this will be evident
in the master cylinder reservoir as the fluid level drops to near
the minimum mark.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Be sure to check your brakes at this point, and
don't forget to top off your fluid.<br>
----------------------</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Unca Joel's warning:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">If you add fluid BEFORE you replace the pads or
shoes, you may regret it later (after you've forgotten that you
added that fluid!) when you do change the pads/shoes. the new pads
and shoes are thicker, and will push the fluid back up into the
master cylinder reservoir ... and all that fluid you added may
spill out!!!</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">So if you're gonna add fluid, make yourself a
note somewhere to watch out for spillage when you replace the
pads/shoes. :)</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">For Vanagons You have FIVE bleeder valves. The
fifth one is on your hydraulic clutch slave cylinder (on the
transmission, between the rear wheels). This fluid also needs to be
bleed/flushed periodically (whenever you do the wheel cylinder
bleeder valves). I think it's easier to reach from up top, through
the engine compartment. And yes, you have to pump the CLUTCH pedal
(instead of the Brake Pedal). :)</font></p>
