<h3>Compression Ratio and Compression
<p>by Ron Van Ness</h3>
<hr size=2>
<font size=+1>
<p>
Here are some data on the relationship between
compression ratio and compression.  The Bosch Automotive Handbook gives the following
formula:
<p> 
<I>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Compression = (Compression Ratio minus one) to the 1.1 to 1.2 power
multiplied by Atmospheric Pressure<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
</I>
<p> 
Given Atmospheric Pressure at sea level = 14.7 psi, 
we have the following:

The Engine Volume of the VW Workshop manual gives the following specifications for
these specific engine types:

<I>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
"Compression (with engine warm, throttle open, all plugs out, gauge in
plug seat and engine turned by starter):
<p> 
Engine code B, AE (up to 558 000)  [Compression Ratio = 7.5]<BR>
New part: 114-142psi  Wear limit: 100psi <BR>
Main difference between cylinders: --<BR>
<p> 
Engine code AE, AH, AK, AM   [Compression Ratio = 7.3]<BR>
New part: 107-135psi  Wear limit: 85psi<BR>
Main difference between cylinders: 28psi"<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
</I>
<p> 
Knowing the compression won't help you pinpoint the CR.  However, if you
are presented with an "unknown" engine that tests out well on a leak down
test, and you proceed to check the compression, you can at least tell if
your CR might be extreme (e.g. if the leak down is good and compression
measures at 150, you can conclude you have an engine with a high CR built
in).  For the most part though, knowing the compression will tell you very
little about CR (as the table above shows), especially if you measure a
compression of 110psi (could be a CR of anywhere from 6.5-7.3:1).
<p> 
All this is bookish info, for your information.  In the real world we aren't all at sea
level, and though standard atmospheric pressure at sea level is 760mm on
the mercury barometer (1013.2 millibars), atmospheric pressure can range
from 950-1050mb according to some reference book I just had lying around
here.  This, the fact that we all don't have access to a leakdown tester
and don't know  how much we are losing past our rings/valves, and the wide
range of compression for a given CR makes the whole business of relating
CR to compression interesting only in an academic sense.
