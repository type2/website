<p><font size="+1">If you hook up a stoboscopic timing light, and
watch the light while the engine is running, you can determine if
the noise is tapping every other revolution of the engine (noise
coincides with light), or every revolution (noise taps twice for
every time light comes on).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Noises that coincide with timing light are "top
end" noises (valvetrain, valves, cam, lifters, etc), and noises
that sound twice for every blink of the light, are "bottom end"
noises (crank, rods, pistons, etc)</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Align Boring:</b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">In order to determine #2 main bearing wear to
decide if line boring is necessary, you can lay a machinist's
straight edge (a ruler may not be completely flat/straight) across
bearing saddles #1, 2, and 3 (not 4) in the case half you are
working on, with the straight edge carefully held in a straight-up
position (don't tilt it). Try running an .001 or .0015 feeler gauge
under all 3 bearing saddles at the straight edge. If the feeler
gauge goes under the straight edge at any of the 3 bearing saddles,
then align boring is a good idea.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Be sure to get a reputable shop to do it--don't
trust just anybody. BTW, it's *definitely* not something you can do
yourself, to be sure. Just be certain that the case that is
candidate for align boring is worthy of the investment---some other
things can be wrong with the case, like the lifter bores
(oversize), cracks behind the flywheel, etc.</font></p>
