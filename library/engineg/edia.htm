<B>Engine Noise:</B>
<p> 
If you hook up a stoboscopic timing light, and watch the light
while the engine is running, you can determine if the noise is
tapping every other revolution of the engine (noise coincides
with light), or every revolution (noise taps twice for every time
light comes on).
<p> 
Noises that coincide with timing light are "top end" noises
(valvetrain, valves, cam, lifters, etc), and noises that sound
twice for every blink of the light, are "bottom end" noises
(crank, rods, pistons, etc)
<p> 
<B>Align Boring:</B>
<p> 
In order to determine #2 main bearing wear to decide if line 
boring is necessary, you can lay a machinist's straight edge 
(a ruler may not be completely flat/straight) across bearing 
saddles #1, 2, and 3 (not 4) in the case half you are working on, with 
the straight edge carefully held in a straight-up position (don't 
tilt it).  Try running an .001 or .0015 feeler gauge under all 3 
bearing saddles at the straight edge.  If the feeler gauge 
goes under the straight edge at any of the 3 bearing saddles, 
then align boring is a good idea.  
<p> 
Be sure to get a reputable 
shop to do it--don't trust just anybody.  BTW, it's *definitely* 
not something you can do yourself, to be sure.  Just be certain 
that the case that is candidate for align boring is worthy of the 
investment---some other things can be wrong with the case, like 
the lifter bores (oversize), cracks behind the flywheel, etc.
