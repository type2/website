<h3>How to Inspect a Used VW Engine Case</h3>
<p>by David Easterwood</p>

<blockquote><font size="+1"><i>I found a person with a used short
block for sale for $75.00. Can someone give me some pointers on
what to check for to make sure the case is
re-buildable?</i></font></blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Well, you can't tell while it is a shortblock,
so tear it down first.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">When you get it apart, inspect the main & rod
bearings to see what kind of life the engine led. Are there any
wear marks on the bearing surfaces that indicate it was run with
dirty oil? Any blueing of the main or rod journals on the crank to
indicate it was run hot?</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">As for the case itself, the first thing I
inspect is the area of the oil sump. Is there any metal
deterioration there? If so there was water in the case for a while,
or it sat with old oil in it for 5 years or more.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The next area I inspect is the the main thrust
bearing dowel pin hole. I think this area is often overlooked. If
the dowel pin has any movement in the hole I trash the case. The
movement means the end play was not set correctly and the excessive
end play caused the dowel pin to oval out the hole.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">If it still checks out, then I thoroughly clean
the case with a pressure washer. To do it right you get *soaked*!
;) Make sure you clean out all of the oil passages. Then I blow the
case out with compressed air to dry everything.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Then I bolt the case back together and torque to
spec and shine a light in the case to make sure the case halves
seat together correctly & the case has not been overheated &
warped.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">After that I look at the main bearing saddles.
If you can run your fingernail over the saddle and feel a ridge
where the oil passage for the bearing was, then it definitely needs
an align bore. I then check with new main thrust bearings to see if
it is a standard or cut case and see if the thrust needs to be cut
on the case. (you have 3-4 sets of new bearings lying around, don't
you?)</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">If the case passes all these tests, sometimes I
take a torch & heat up areas above & in front of the #3 spigot to
see if there are any hairline cracks.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">These are a few things I do before I send a case
out to be machined. I probably forgot a thing or
two...<br></font></p>
