<h3>Tan Foamy Sludge (a.k.a. "Oil Cap Mayonaise")</h3>
<p>by Dean Aukes</p>

<p><font size="+1">On the tan foamy sludge, I've had that in
varying amounts on the oil filler cap of my '73 type 4 engine
camper for the last 9 years. With the thermostat and flaps fully
functional, I would get a little of it; without the flaps and
thermostat working properly (current engine), I get it on the cap
and some in the filler tube.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">As I understand it, it is due to the oil never
getting warm enough (&gt;180F) to get all the condensation out of
the oil. It isn't immediately fatal, but doesn't help your engine
in the long run.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">There have been many discussions over the years
on the cooling flaps and thermostats. Bob Hoover has a few sermons
on it and is very adamant that they should be in place. I tend to
agree with him in all respects though my practice has been a little
more lax. VW wouldn't spend money on something that didn't really
need to be there. I think it makes a difference on the long term
life of your engine, say 60,000 miles vs 100,000-150,000 miles that
Bob gets. On the flip side, there have been posts of engines making
100,000 without flaps, or testimonials of folks whose flap linkage
caused overheating and they would never use it again.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">It's up to you. There's lots of stuff in the
archives on it. I'm basically a stock kinda guy, so I would tend to
agree with the VW factory and Bob.</font></p>
