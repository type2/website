<h3>Rear Motor Mount Replacement ('72-'79 Type 2)</h3>
<p>by Dennis Jolliffe (a.k.a. Denmeister) and David Schwarze</p>
<hr size="2">
<p><font size="+1">Dennis Jolliffe's recommends:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">First, a procedure within a procedure:
<b>Removing the Alternator</b>:</font></p>
<ol>
<li><font size="+1">As usual all good procedures involve
disconnecting the battery. Do it first.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Get a roll of 1/2" masking tape, and a pad of
paper, fine point felt marker, and a ball point pen. Mark
everything as you take it apart, so you will know where it goes
later. Draw circuit connection maps if you need to so you don't
forget where everything attaches. It's not a crime to make notes.
The mind is a fickle thing after a few beers, don't you
know...</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Disconnect the alternator wires from the
starter, and pull them back thru the firewall tinwork, and
disconnect the harness from the regulator. Label everything so you
know where it re-connects.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Remove the engine seal back far enough to not
be in the way around the back while you're working.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Remove the plastic oil filler portion of the
oil tube, and the dipstick, and tuck a clean rag in there so
nothing unwanted falls into the tube during surgery.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Remove the three tinwork parts around the rear
edge.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Remove the center three bolts from the fan hub
(not the very center one, it can stay).</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Loosen the alternator, and remove the
belt.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Loosen and remove the bottom bolt holding the
alternator in place thru the tinwork at the bottom.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Remove the bolts and screw holding the
alternator front cover tinwork in place, and remove the
tinwork.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Remove the upper adjusting bolt from the
alternator bracket (watch for the widget at the back of the bracket
when you remove the allen head bolt, as it will fall to the ground
when the bolt is removed).</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">The bracket the alternator adjustment is done
against is connected with a 13mm nut at the top. It can be removed
from below using a short 13mm socket, and a couple of long
extensions. The bracket is also connected to the heater box at the
bottom. Remove the hardware and the bracket.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Now remove the alternator! End alternator
removal...reverse procedure to re-install.</font>
<hr></li>
<li><font size="+1">CAREFULLY remove the fan from the end of the
crank hub (soak it good with WD-40), and pry gently from the edges
against the steel part of the pulley with two long flat blade
screwdrivers, this can be a tricky job requiring a beer brake if
you get cranky. Be sure not to break off any of the aluminum
cooling fins during removal as this will play havoc with the
balancing and cause all kinds of grief afterwards. Give the whole
fan assembly a detailed bath in Varsol when you get it out. I use a
tooth brush to get in all the cracks and crannies.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Remove the two connecting plates that cover the
opening between the heater box and the fan shroud assembly at the
bottom...these are accessed from the bottom. They're different,
mark which one goes on which side. Put the hardware back in the
holes once they're removed</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">There are three oddball to get at screws that
hold tinwork to the fan shroud on the 3-4 side--two along the
outside edge, and one down by the base of the dizzy. Remove
them.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Disconnect the thermostat cable from the
crossbar. This 4mm bolt (8mm head) strips easily, don't over
tighten it later. Pull the cable back out of the way from the
bottom</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Disconnect the hold-down strap from the coil,
and move the coil forward out of the way.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Remove the 4-8mm bolt size (13mm head size)
nuts from the fanshroud thru the center fan opening.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Some folks have a heater/muffler support
bracket on the 3-4 side that attaches to the fanshroud. If you have
one, now is the time to remove it.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Have a good look around for anything else that
might still be attached, but you should be able to pull the top
edge of the shroud rearwards at this point, and up to remove it
from the vehicle. It's a tight fit, and may require some minor
prying. Watch the flapper fins on the way out to be sure you don't
damage anything. Have a good look to see how everything aligns
before you give it the final tug.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Support the engine on a stand at this point,
and remove the rear cross-member two lower bolts, and two on each
side bracket bolts, and remove the rear engine support. You need to
do this to reach the lower mount bracket bolts...or you can leave
the brackets on the engine, and change the broken mount. Either
way, you're half-way there, it's all apart, and the hard part is
done.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Replace the rubber mounts, and re-assemble
reverse of taking apart.</font></li>
</ol>
<font size="+1">To be honest, this is a 2-4 hour job at best...plan
the day, it can't be hurried in much less than 3 hours, and be done
correctly.</font>
<p><font size="+1">Remember my motto: measure twice, but cut once,
and do it correctly.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">One can also use this procedure to replace oil
cooler seals and gaskets. It's a good time to do that and replace
the accordion boot on the dipstick where it attaches to the oil
filler tube by the way.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">David Schwarze writes his procedure for
replacing the motor mounts:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Unfortunately, a lot has to be removed to get at
the mounts easily. I say easily because I'm not sure it's
impossible to remove them with the fan housing attached, but if
possible it would certainly be difficult.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The fan housing is held on by four studs behind
the fan, but it is also attached to the heater boxes. You need to
pull it back to remove it from the studs, but you need to lift it
up to remove it from the heater boxes. I've tried, but have not
been able to remove the fan housing without both unfastening the
studs and removing the heater boxes. My procedure is roughly as
follows:</font></p>
<ul>
<li><font size="+1">Remove positive lead from battery (for safety -
just do it).</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Remove rear of engine seal, oil filler pipe and
three rear tin pieces.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Remove muffler.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Remove small tin pieces at heater box/fan
housing junction</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Remove two bottom tin pieces between the heater
boxes and engine case.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Unfasten forward and top ducts from the heater
boxes (may not be necessary if you don't remove the heater boxes -
see below).</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Remove alternator bracket bolt from right
heater box.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Remove heater boxes (you could probably get by
with just dropping them down a bit).</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Remove three bolts from fan hub and remove
fan.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Remove four nuts and washers holding the fan
housing on. Make sure you get the washers after they fall down into
the housing (they always do).</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Unfasten thermostat cable at the
crossbar.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Remove alternator (this might not be necessary,
but it will allow you to completely remove the fan housing and set
it aside, without having to remove the alternator wiring):</font>
<ul>
<li><font size="+1">remove adjusting bolt</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">remove lower bolt (13mm nut behind)</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">remove tin cover</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">remove cooling duct from fan housing to
alternator</font></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><font size="+1">At this point, the fan shroud should be loose.
Pull it straight backwards, being mindful of the upper edge, which
is tucked underneath the top tin pieces. If it does not come free
easily, you may need to loosen some of the fasteners holding the
upper tin pieces to the engine case to allow the upper tin to come
up a little bit.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">A bonus is that now you get to see how the
cooling flaps work. Take a few minutes to move them back and forth
with your hands and look closely at the flaps, especially the left
one. Notice the dimensions of the openings in the fan housing - the
left one is larger because of the oil cooler.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">You can also check your oil cooler and sender
for leaks and repair them easily if needed. You can also do
something cool with your fan housing like cleaning it really well
and powdercoating or polishing it. I want to powdercoat mine
someday.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">If you dropped a spark plug down under the tin
sometime in the past, now is the time to reach in there and grab
it. You can also inspect your cylinders and oil cooler for anything
blocking the flow of air through them, like leaves, or oily
dirt.<br></font></p>
