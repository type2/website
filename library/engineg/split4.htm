<h3>Splitting the Type IV Case</h3>
<p>by John Anderson</p>
<hr size="2">
<p><font size="+1">You NEED to remove up to 18 (count them) 8mm
nuts or bolts to split a Type IV case. Often there are only 17, but
occasionally one will be in place at the very top tab on the
flywheel end.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Among the hardware to be removed are:</font></p>
<ul>
<li><font size="+1">Two 6mm nuts from the breather area</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Six 10mm case through bolts to split a T4 case
(don't actually remove those 10mm bolts just take off the
nuts)</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Three often overlooked are: one behind the
flywheel, one in the center of the lifter bores, and one below the
oil filter.</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font size="+1">Count them, if you don't have 18 yet, keep
looking.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Even then the Type IV can be a hard case to
split. Last week I ruined a nice 1700 case--broke the tang up at
the breather clean off on my second tap with a wooden mallet. I've
hit harder on others with even steel hammers, so I figure someone
else had already nearly broken it.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">It is usually the 2 dowels that hang it up,
particularly if they are rusted. To make it easier I recommend
using one of the studs below the oil pump (which has already been
removed) to tap on. Sometimes it is easier to first remove all the
parting line and through hardware then the pump will slip right
out. Put an old nut on the stud about halfway on, and tap gently
with a hammer on the nut. This will concentrate the force right at
the dowel below the pump. Once that starts, judicious tapping with
soft mallets up on the front top (flywheel end) will usually break
the other pin free and then you can pull it apart by hand. Also, no
need to remove the oil seals. Don't beat that stud so much to
damage it--light tapping will get the case going.</font></p>
