<h3>The 40 hp "Bastard Motor"</h3>
<p>by Clara Williams</p>
<hr size="2">
<p><font size="+1">The motor is officially called the "modified
36hp" by VW. However, it is often called the "bastard" 40hp. A
couple explanations come to mind:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">It is sort of like a bottom end of a 36hp with
the top end of a 40hp. A "bastardization," if you will.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Due to the problems this combination caused,
often resulting in broken cranks, VW actually recalled the damn
things, and you could get it replaced at your local dealership and
get a 40hp installed. Though there was great hope for the new big
engine, it was an embarrassing mistake, spoken of derrogatorily,
pushed under the allegorical rug and VW doesn't like to admit it
was born. (Not to cast aspersions upon the sons of unmarried
mothers.) The bottom end of the 40hp engine was strengthened, and
the crank breaking problem was eliminated.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Many of the different bastard parts will fit the
later motors, such as the fuel pump. The heads are different, and
take a different valve cover gasket.<br></font></p>
