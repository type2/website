<h3>Compression Ratio Shims and Spacers</h3>
<p>by Jason Black</p>
<hr size="2">
<blockquote><font size="+1"><i>"I'm in the process of determining
what cylinder spacers I need to achieve a compression ratio of 7
for my 1776. On page 17 of my Gene Berg catalog, he lists spacers
and shims and I'm wondering how each is to be used. The obvious
difference is that spacers have thicknesses of .040 and .060 and
the shims have thicknesses like .007. Are the shims to be used in
conjunction with spacers to set the compression ratio with great
precision? If not, then what is their use?"</i></font></blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Setting compression ratio exactly begins before
the engine case is bolted together, in my humble opinion, by
measuring the rods and pistons and ensuring that "shorter" pistons
get matched with "longer" rods and vice versa. It's easiest to do
this with a good dial caliper that is accurate to .001". This helps
to make certain that your deck height measurements won't be wildly
deviated from each other on any *single* side of the engine. Like,
1 and 2 can be .010" greater than 3 and 4... that can be accounted
for in shims/spacers by making the 3/4 spacers .010" larger. But, 1
and 2 should be very close, as should 3 and 4.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">After the engine case is buttoned up and pistons
and cylinders installed, the deck height must be measured. With
these figures (hopefully they match each other), and the CC volume
readings, you can determine what shims/spacers you need to order.
Gene Berg will make any size that you need.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Without CC volume, you can't know the CR... a
thick round piece of clear plastic is obtained, the same diameter
as the top of your pistons. A hole is drilled in the plate that
conforms to roughly where the combustion chamber in the head ends,
where there is little space. If it's drilled in the middle, you'll
spend an eternity trying to get the head level again so that all of
the air bubbles escape.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Some people use cooking oil to check their CC
volume...it's what I used. It does not want to flow through the
syringe easily, though. If I had something that would flow easier,
then I'd use the 1cc syringe over the 10cc, for the sake of
accuracy. Go ahead and score the markings on the syringe into the
plastic, since the marks come off when repeatedly exposed to oil...
I also partially disassemble the head, removing and hand-lapping
the valves so that no oil leaks between the valve and the seat, and
reassemble. Polishing the head before this is done is also a good
idea. I use the blue 3M Roloc pads on a high-speed angle air tool
with gentle pressure, in combination later with tinier Cratex
polishing mandrel things...</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Head together, grease sparingly on plate to
seal, plate on, head more or less level... the rocker arm studs
prevent this unless you drill a couple of holes in a piece of
plywood for them to stick through. I loosely screw on a couple of
nuts on the back side, too...</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Then you just keep track of how much fluid you
inject into a given head. When it's full, that's the volume for
that one... three more to go.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Bob Hoover recommended, I believe, that heads
for stock motors be kept to within a 1/2 cc of each other, within 1
cc for 1776 and up... Polishing a little more aggressively can even
this up, although I'm told that the common procedure is to sink the
valves...I don't have that technology yet.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Once you know that the CC volumes are
approximately equal, then you can take that data and the deck
height and crank stroke and piston/cylinder diameter and figure out
the CR... and figure out what shims/spacers to order/have made.
Some times it is a hassle trying to make everything fit after you
have effectively widened the engine. For this reason many people
have their heads semi-hemi cut to lower compression with little if
any shimming required. Barb and Eric recommend taking down the
sharp edges on the combustion chamber to have a similar effect, but
I don't know how much you can safely remove and so far i have stuck
with shims. Perhaps they will post about exactly how much they feel
comfortable with removing and some ballpark
dimensions...</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">But... only one shim or spacer should be used
per cylinder... any more and you run the risk of leakage. People
have gotten away with it, but it is not recommended.<br></font></p>
