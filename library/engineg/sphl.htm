<h3>Spark Plug Hole Rethreading</h3>
<p>by Barb and Eric</p>
<hr size="2">
<p><font size="+1">Please do not use a helicoil. They are not a
good idea and I had many bad encounters with them in the USAF in
aircraft maintance. The only places they are good in are areas that
are virtually never taken apart again. Due to their tendancy to
back out with the stud/bolt/sparkplug. On top of that they require
two more special tools to install compared to just a tap for the
solid inserts. Also the solid inserts and tap can be bought from
<a href="http://www.timesert.com/">"Time-Sert"</a> and these
inserts have a system to lock them in place just like the 36HP and
earlier head steel inserts.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The main thing we would advise is to remove the
heads, then you can make sure to tap the holes straight with the
old ones. Also, you can ping the lock on the inside of the head so
it will never come out if you use either "Never sieze" or graphite
on the threads of the plugs.</font></p>
