  <h3>Hydraulic Lifters and Type IV Pushrod Tube Seals</h3>

  <p>by John Anderson</p>
  <hr size="2">

  <p><font size="+1">Hydraulic Lifters can be Adjusted Warm!</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1">Despite popular belief, it <b>is not</b> necessary to
  adjust <b>hydraulic</b> lifters stone cold. In fact, there are times and
  means where you purposely strive for this not to be the case. When you
  adjust a hydraulic lifter, you are adjusting it to contact plus somewhere
  between 1 and 2 turns of the rocker arm adjuster screw. That screw is a
  special fine pitch 10mm, but still is good for 1mm per turn (.040"). Taking
  an average of the information available, you will be adjusting to .060"
  past contact.</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1">Consider why on a solid lifter car you must adjust the
  lifters stone cold. It is so you aren't adjusting them when valves are warm
  and "stretched." Though I'm also a mechanical engineer, I'm not going to
  bore you with numbers. But think for a second about what you know. We
  adjust those solids to .006" gap, which implies that an exhaust valve will
  NEVER stretch more than .006" in use. Otherwise, we would be holding it
  open all the time (even when on the backside of the cam lobe, and that is
  very conservative). These valves aren't going to probably stretch more than
  a few thousandths of an inch.</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1">So we know a valve isn't going to stretch more than
  .006" and that VW over the years has proffered an adjustment range from
  .040" to .080" past contact on the hydraulic lifters. That valve can be as
  hot as it can get and you still have a 3 to 4 time slush factor either way
  of a "perfect" adjustment. So you see, hydraulics don't have to be cold for
  an adjustment. The only thing to watch out for with the warm engine/one
  that has just been run is to avoid burning yourself (!).</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1"><b>Identifying Hydraulic Lifters</b></font></p>

  <p><font size="+1">You just bought a beautiful lime green and rust '78
  Westy and when you start her in the mornings you get something between a
  tapping to pounding sound from the old engine that changes with engine
  speed. You remember what the old bug (or '71 and earlier bus) sounded like
  with loose valves? This sounds the same but even louder (even up to a hard
  pounding beat). You think you got them hydraulic lifters...</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1">A can tell if you have hydraulic lifters in a couple
  ways. First, pull either valve cover. Take a "mini Mag" flashlight and look
  up a pushrod tube around the rocker arm. If that little pushrod is only
  about the size of a big round (3/8") pencil all the way end to end and
  looks steel (probably brown and oily), chances are there are still
  hydraulic lifters in there. If instead, right behind the tip, behind the
  rocker arm, the pushrod steps out to a big, ugly aluminum rod (probably
  closer to 1/2" diameter and probably more silver in color) chances are you
  have solid lifters in the block. If they are all currently adjusted to
  somewhere in the .004-.008" range you can guess pretty much for
  sure.</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1">By the book, only GD, GE, or CV blocks came from VW with
  hydraulics (but only '78 and '79 GD blocks). All Vanagon CV blocks came
  with hydraulics. Be aware that hydraulics could have found their way into
  any T4 block over the years--hopefully along with an hydraulic cam and the
  steel pushrods. If you see steel pushrods and if when you rotate each
  cylinder to TDC and try to get a feeler between the valve tip and rocker
  screw there <b>isn't</b> a gap, you indeed have hydraulics. This is a good
  thing--but why that infernal pounding?!</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1"><b>Air in the Lifters</b></font></p>

  <p><font size="+1">The hydraulic lifter lets the valve ride on a cushion of
  oil, always maintaining perfect preload and contact on the cam but not so
  much (oil pressure balances the spring pressure) that it holds the valve
  open. Assume your '78 shows an actual 120k or so on the original engine
  (though they can get noisy much earlier if not driven, not maintained,
  etc). As these accumulate time, the lifter parts lose their tolerances.
  Overnight, or after setting, the oil inside them leaks out, air leaks in
  and when you start up, the air has to find its way out. Imagine the lifter
  as a syringe of water, but with the needle end closed and flat against the
  cam, the plunger against the pushrod. Now that water inside is instead
  being pressurized constantly to 40 psi or so (oil pressure) from a little
  hole in the side of the syringe. If a big bubble of air leaks in so it is
  only half water and half air inside, and if everything is closed off (by
  the external oil pressure when you start the car) the air is trapped. When
  you push on the plunger the air compresses and the plunger can collapse
  easily some distance before a balance is achieved.</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1">Oil can't be squeezed. Air can be, therefore it is not
  good to have air in your lifter. You can check for this if you have noise.
  Go along with a big screwdriver and try to push on the bottom end of the
  rocker shafts, right in line with the pushrod. Do this when the cylinder is
  near or at TDC and the valve train is not loaded (though many of the valves
  will be unloaded at once so give em all a quick push). The rocker shaft is
  knurled right where you press so the screwdriver won't slip. When you press
  (and I mean a good hard press) there should be <b>no movement</b> at all.
  Chances are some of them will be "soft" when you press them. Maybe they
  will move in less than 1/16" of an inch feeling spongy. Those have air, but
  are probably OK. Then there will be a couple real offenders. Those you will
  be able to shove a good bit. These definitely have a lot of air in them and
  little oil. You are basically just compressing the big spring in the
  lifter. So we have hydraulic lifters with air in them. What do we
  do?</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1">The questions we must ask are: Does this happen every
  day? Does the rapping stop after 10-15 minutes driving? If you drive the
  bus everyday does it stop even faster? My first opinion: if you know the
  engine hasn't been fooled with and the bus hasn't been driven in a few
  weeks, change the oil to something light (10W30), put on a new filter, and
  sit there in the drive and rev it up and down for 15-20 minutes, staying in
  the 2000-2500 rpm range. Get it good and warm but don't rev it too high. If
  the bus has sat for a few months or even a few weeks and begins to quiet
  out, then subsequently quiets out each morning after even up to as much as
  10 minutes, and isn't banging <b>really</b> loud: don't worry.</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1">I parked my old '78 on a sideways slope for 8 months
  then fired her up. It always had 2 dying lifters that pounded for 1/2 an
  hour (and I mean <b>pounded</b>). Make sure all the rocker shaft nuts are
  torqued correctly and be happy. <b>NEVER, EVER</b>, use Quaker State oil
  with VW hydraulic lifters. Generally, I run the oil weight VW recommends.
  In my climate that means 10W30 winters (but only if it stays cold else
  maybe some 15W40) and 20W50 in the summer. VW is very conservative about
  oil. They recommend thicker stuff than most manufacturers. Use a good oil
  and filter and change it every 3-5000 miles. If you run the proper weight
  oil it won't cause you any noise or trouble. I use Castrol GTX or Shell
  Rotella exclusively. I can often run the Rotella 15W40 diesel weight oil
  year round in a camper that doesn't get everyday use.</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1"><b>Still Making Noise?</b></font></p>

  <p><font size="+1">So it still pounds? If you didn't know any better, you'd
  be tempted to adjust the valves. There are 3 much possible
  solutions:</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1">1. Bleeding the Lifters<br>
  2. Additives and Purging<br>
  3. Special Adjustment Procedure (a compromise, as proffered by Mark
  Steven's and others)<br></font></p>

  <p><font size="+1"><b>1. BLEEDING THE LIFTERS</b></font></p>

  <p><font size="+1">This is the hardest, most labor intensive "solution" and
  it most likely won't solve your noise problem! You can refer to the
  relevant section in the Bentley (official VW service manual) for the "bench
  bleeding" procedure, for what it's worth. To do this you must pull the
  valve covers, pull the springs retaining the pushrod tubes, pull the rocker
  arms, pull the pushrods, pull the pushrod tubes, then pull the lifters
  (discouraged yet?!).</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1"><b>Replacing the pushrod tube seals</b></font></p>

  <p><font size="+1">Admittedly, this can be a good thing to do if you want
  to replace pushrod tube seals anyway. Replacing these seals correctly can
  be an adventure in itself. In short: don't use RTV. O-rings work on clean,
  lubricated surfaces by compression. That tube of blue, orange, red, or
  black goo won't last-- you'll be back again facing the same leak in a few
  months, doubling your labor and aggravation. After removing the
  aforementioned parts, <b>immaculately</b> clean the areas surrounding each
  lifter bore. Ideally, you should do this the day prior when you pulled the
  under pushrod tins (if present). It's also a good idea to soak bottom of
  the engine block with degreaser in advance. Scrub the block around the
  tubes with a toothbrush, hose it off with hot water, then let it set to
  cool and dry overnight.</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1">After that, clean out each bore carefully with kerosene
  and paper towels (as many as it takes). Clean the bigger part of the bore
  where the pushrod tube O-ring has been riding and you make sure nothing is
  up in the machined lifter bore itself. Pushing a scrap of towel back into
  the top of the lifter and using a toothbrush on the bore where the o-ring
  sits is good. The towel prevents debris from settling back in the
  bore.</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1">Do the same to the bores over on the heads. Install
  Viton o-rings with silicone grease (or at least oil) and those tubes won't
  leak again. Verify the tubes are not dented where the o-ring sits--that
  will cause a leak. Also, if you are experiencing blowby (gases that slip
  past the piston rings, pressurizing the crankcase) nothing will stop the
  leaking.</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1"><b>Back to Bleeding the Lifters</b></font></p>

  <p><font size="+1">Now that the bore is spotless, we can pull the lifters.
  Use a good 2lb magnetic parts "picker upper", or catch the lip of the
  lifter with a pointy right angle pick. If you choose the latter technique
  be very careful not to slip and scratch the bore. If everything is clean, a
  magnet should get them out, but you might have to work them back and forth
  a bit.</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1">Pull all of them and keep them in order. If you're
  pulling them all, you can store them in an egg carton with numbered holes
  (#1I, #1E, #2I, #2E, etc.) or do them one at a time. If you're only doing
  the ones that feel soft, just be sure you somehow keep track so that a
  lifter goes back in its correct bore.</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1">Now is a good time to inspect the cam. The T4 cam wears
  badly. Let's assume power and compression are off, and the heads are newish
  on an old bottom end. Look down the bores at the toe (top area) of one of
  the lobes on the cam (at least one is going to be facing you down a hole).
  Is it smooth and even or is there a 1/16" dip in the center? If here is a
  healthy dip, your compression has very likely been low and power is down.
  In this case, your bottom end's days are numbered. Assuming there is over
  100k on the engine and you didn't buy it from meticulous owner who changed
  the oil every 3000 miles, be aware that your power will continue to wane.
  Expect a $1500 bill sometime in the next 25k miles. The Type IV bottom end
  is rock solid as far as the crank and rods go, but the cams
  wear.</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1">Now we'll disassemble, bleed, and reassemble the lifters
  one at a time. Remember to return each of them to their numbered
  bins.</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1"><b>Inspection and Disassembling the
  Lifter</b></font></p>

  <p><font size="+1">You'll need:</font></p>

  <ul>
    <li><font size="+1">a small can of kerosene</font></li>

    <li><font size="+1">a pair of quality needle nose pliers or 2 tiny, flat
    screwdrivers</font></li>

    <li><font size="+1">a pick or paper clip</font></li>

    <li><font size="+1">an old bug pushrod (ideal) or a rod of something
    about 5/16" diameter. You can use a bolt, but file off the end a bit
    semi-circular, then sandpaper the end smooth and clean it
    well.</font></li>
  </ul>

  <p><font size="+1">Take a lifter and inspect it. Bentley says to push the
  socket with your thumb, I say use the pushrod (even one off your Type IV
  engine for now). Lean on it with all your might. If it doesn't move, or
  barely moves, return it to its spot in the numbered tray. If the socket
  sinks noticeably and easily, while holding it down (not really necessary)
  remove the circlip with your needle nose pliers or the 2 screwdrivers.
  Note: unless you have 10 or 20 used lifters sitting in a box like me, do
  this in a clean area on clean newspaper (kitchen table is good). If that
  circlip flies off and hides itself and you want to drive the bus tomorrow,
  you better have a metal detector (ask me how I know!).</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1">Take out the socket, plunger (with check ball, spring
  and retainer), big spring, etc. The valve retainer will snap off the
  plunger with finger pressure, revealing the ball and little spring. Let it
  all soak in the can of kerosene for a few minutes, then scrub all the parts
  with a toothbrush or Q-tips. Lay everything out to dry on a paper towel.
  Everything should be clean and shiny. Blow out the body with air if
  available, else make sure all the kerosene is gone with a paper towel or
  Q-tips and blow the lint off with your mouth. If anything looks terribly
  worn, scratched, or scored, you should replace it. However, you'll probably
  find most of even the real soft ones look brand new inside. That is because
  the wear and tolerances we are dealing with are minute.</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1"><b>Reassembly and Bleeding</b></font></p>

  <p><font size="+1">If you've been refering to the Bentley manual, you'll
  notice at this stage it becomes particularly useless. They expect you to
  have a press and jump through hoops keeping the body immersed in a pan of
  oil while pressing. Ironically, the Vanagon Bentley carries over this
  foolish procedure from the '68-'79 Bentley, but also has (in section 15.24)
  the far better procedure for the wasserboxer lifters...which can also be
  used for the air cooled lifters!! Needless to say, we will be following the
  better instructions for the wasserboxer.</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1">You need a vice. A big C clamp will do (though I've
  never tried it this way). A small vice is fine, just the length of the
  lifter plus an inch or so. You also need about an inch of that bug pushrod,
  or the inch long 5/16" bolt with the tip filed semi-circular and smoothly
  sanded.</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1">Take some SAE40 oil and lube all the parts, then put the
  little spring in the check valve retainer. Sit the little ball on the
  spring and clip the assembly to the bottom of the plunger, making sure the
  ball stays centered on the spring. Drop the big spring in the body of the
  lifter and take the SAE40 oil and fill the body of the lifter until it
  overflows. Immediately drop in the assembled plunger/check valve assembly.
  Oil will swish out the hole in the side of the body and over the top. As
  you put it in, put a pick or the tip of the paper clip in the hole to push
  the little ball down, so as the plunger slides in, oil and any air under
  the plunger come out the valve and the plunger sinks nicely into the oil
  filled body. Push it down with your fingers as far as you can. Now top off
  the body if it has flowed out and drop in the pushrod socket. You won't be
  able to get this in all the way--that is what the vice is for.</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1">Immediately take the lifter to the vice, but put a pad
  between the lifter face and the vice (aluminum soft jaws are great if you
  have them). Hold the lifter there with the little hole in the side of the
  body <b>facing up</b> while you hold it all together. Use your smoothed
  bolt or 1" section of pushrod in the socket and close the vice, compressing
  the socket as shown in the Vanagon Bentley figure 15-493. Do this just far
  enough to expose the groove for the circlip. Oil will ooze out the body
  side hole. Install the circlip. Take it all out, store with the face down,
  and test it again with thumb pressure or the pushrod. It should be rock
  solid. Repeat this as many times as needed on the lifters that need
  it.</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1"><b>Adjustment</b></font></p>

  <p><font size="+1">Reinstall the lifters, pushrod tubes, pushrods, rockers,
  retainer springs, everything in order. Back all the adjuster screws out
  maybe 3 or so turns. If you don't know valve adjustment basics, you may
  refer to the information in Muir's Idiot book, the Bentley, or even the
  Haynes manual.</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1">Go to each cylinder one at a time and set it to TDC for
  adjustment. If you've backed the screw out 3 turns or so, both rockers on
  that screw should rattle freely. Bentley says back it all the way until it
  is flush with the rocker. That is fine as well, but make sure the pushrod
  does not slip out of the socket on either end at the lifter or in the
  rocker. With them just loose this won't happen--double check by looking
  down the pushrod with the mini Mag Lite. The pushrod should spin if it is
  loose in between the two sockets. If it does fall out on the inside end and
  rest against the lifter somewhere else, you will notice because the pushrod
  will be too far out, making the adjuster screw contact way before all the
  others do (probably before it is even hardly out past the
  rocker.)</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1">Also check when you push with the screwdriver on the
  pushrod end of the rocker: it should now be dead solid. You might have a
  time limit here. Even with 40 weight oil, and not having run or warmed up,
  your newly bled lifter could leak in air overnight just sitting there on
  its side, so install them <b>immediately</b> before adjusting. Also,
  install the lifters with the little holes initially up.</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1">The rockers are loose and that cylinder is at TDC. Now,
  with the tension off, is a good time check the torque on the rocker shaft
  nuts. Watch while you run each screw in till it just touches the valve. A
  good way is by rocking it with one hand (tap, tap, tap) while you turn.
  When it just touches: no tap. Then turn it 1, 1.5, or 2 complete more
  turns. VW initially said 2, some say 1, I compromise at 1.5 turns. Do both
  on that cylinder, tighten the adjusting lock nuts. There's no need to be
  fussy about holding the screw while tightening, just make sure the screw
  doesn't turn while you cinch the nut (unlikely).</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1">Move to the next cylinder, set it at TDC, repeat, etc.
  You have just correctly adjusted your lifters by the book. They are going
  to stay that way with that thick oil in them. But the bad news is, when you
  run it the first time and it sits a day, the noise will be back! At least
  you have verified that a lifter is badly worn. Perhaps you should replace
  the real soft ones, or, if they quiet down after 5-10 minutes, live happily
  knowing they are set correctly. The bright side is the pushrod tubes don't
  leak anymore, and maybe you know the cam is worn and should be passing the
  Bus along or thinking about a rebuild.</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1"><b>2. ADDITIVES AND PURGING</b></font></p>

  <p><font size="+1">If even after an oil change the valves still tap
  mercilessly and don't stop after 20 minutes of revving in the 2000-2500 rpm
  range, pull the covers and verify they are soft. Consider that if the
  engine is in the 100k mile range and there is much burnt oil in the rocker
  boxes, it might not be long for life. Perhaps it has just sat a long time
  and the lifters are immersed in dirty oil. In this case they need to be
  flushed.</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1">You could try an STP "wonder" product, CD-2?, Warner or
  other aromatic solvents claiming to solve all your lifter problems. It
  might work...or it might knock so much debris loose you will regret it the
  rest of your engine's short life! If it is a new engine with lower miles I
  might be inclined to toss a can of "wonder" liquid in. But I'd do it a
  couple of days before an oil change and if it doesn't help, change the
  oil.</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1">Next option is to flush with thin oil. (SAE10 if you can
  find it, Dexron Automatic Transmission Fluid otherwise). Somewhere between
  50/50 10W30 to ATF or just straight ATF if you are feeling manly. Be
  forewarned, <b>this is risky</b> and potentially engine life threatening,
  especially if too much stuff breaks loose or if things get too hot. A new
  oil filter should catch most stuff, but... I've gone the straight ATF
  route. For you, maybe the 50/50 is a better, more conservative
  bet.</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1"><b>If at any time you see the oil light come on--STOP
  IMMEDIATELY--cool down, and go back to regular oil</b>. Even with normally
  worn components, a 10 minute run with RPMs up should not cause a 150k mile
  engine to have oil pressure problems. If you notice pressure problems, you
  have other mechanical issues to attend to: worn pump, extreme bottom end
  wear, overheating, etc.</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1">Start the engine and as before, run it up to 2000-2500
  rpm, this time for about 10 minutes. Keep the rpm's moving around a bit,
  let it cool for 30 minutes, then repeat. Repeat maybe 4-5 times with good,
  long cool downs and stop if the lifters stop tapping. If by trial number 5
  nothing is changed: Stop, change back to oil, consider replacing suspect
  lifters as in step 1.</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1">If the noise at idle did go away, stop, and add new,
  quality oil and filter. Keep it changed (every 3000 miles) and start the
  bus every day and let it run 15 minutes or so. This can be a great trick to
  clean things out. It can also be fatal if done badly or if you are unlucky.
  If your bottom end is loose already, nothing fixes extreme wear and bad
  maintenance. I've done this to clean out a few vans, and you may do it
  wisely and at your own risk. I also killed a GTI engine this way that
  sucked too much debris up the filter screen. I've heard professional
  mechanics recommend the straight ATF route, but again, this is at <b>your
  own risk</b>.</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1"><b>3. SPECIAL ADJUSTMENT PROCEDURE</b></font></p>

  <p><font size="+1">You may use this procedure if your lifters are noisy for
  5-10 minutes then quiet down to no more than a minor tapping at idle (or
  when you let up on the throttle suddenly after acceleration). Do this if
  you yearn for something "scientific minded", but don't want to pull the
  lifters. This is the best thing to do when you just get a "new to you" bus.
  First, check for the soft lifters as before, then do the following. Adjust
  all the valves to .006" just like a solid lifter engine. This is a bit
  tricky. Be sure when you adjust a soft one that the feeler gauge isn't just
  compressing the lifter. Go to TDC, back the screws out until they don't
  touch, and gently rest a finger against the pushrod end of the rocker
  holding it against the lifter (but not compressing the soft lifter) then
  adjust the other end to the .006 gap. Repeat for all valves at the
  appropriate TDC for each cylinder.</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1">Start the engine and let her run a minute or 2 at
  2000-2500 rpm. It will be very loud. Maybe it will quiet a bit. Stop the
  engine, pop the valve covers, turn to a cylinder and see if the previously
  soft lifters are now hard. If so, immediately close the gap (Which may
  already be gone if a soft one pumped up. In that case open the gap then
  close to just contact). Adjust to 1.5 turns past contact as detailed
  previously. The valves are warm so don't burn yourself.</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1">Had you checked them all before and all 8 were solid,
  you might find when the time came for the adjustment procedure (adjust,
  turn the engine, adjust, etc.) by the time you get to the last 4 they might
  already be soft again! My old '78 was this way: the bad ones would only
  hold pressure for maybe a minute or 2--had to work fast on them. This is no
  real problem. Just do the one side first, then put the valve covers on,
  start it for another 2 minutes, go do the other side. This is a practical
  way to get them pumped up and assure they are in good adjustment. If you
  adjust to 1.5 past contact ON A SOLIDLY PUMPED LIFTER you endanger nothing
  in the valve train and the lifters have plenty of slop, plus they seem to
  pump up better running loose. If they refused to pump solid you need to
  adjust to about a turn or so past contact to roughly where it was before
  you started. With contact being ascertained as before by gently holding the
  rocker on the pushrod, you might need to consider bench bleeding or
  eventually replacing the lifter, or with luck it might just go
  away.</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1">Some play is acceptable, but if you can push the rocker
  down an 1/8" you have problems. You can try to adjust all the way round and
  perhaps all will be right. But you'll likely find the next morning nothing
  will have changed. So keep the oil clean, and don't worry if they tap for
  even as much as 15 minutes or more if the bus sits for a month or so.
  Basically, live with it, and don't worry so much unless things are really
  banging around back there.</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1">Again, you may want to consider flushing with ATF--it
  can work miracles and stop the noise, or it could be a $1500 solution! You
  make the choice. For the first 15 minutes most days you should have nothing
  more than extremely minor tapping and valve noise from a hydraulic lifter
  VW van. perhaps you can have noise from one or two lifters that sounds like
  a properly adjusted mechanical lifter bus, no more. The length of time it
  taps depends on the oil, angle it was parked on, how long it has been since
  run, etc. But a faint persistent tapping from one now and then that won't
  purge is nothing to get upset about--chances are it will come and
  go.</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1">Someone on the Type2 mailing list mentioned that their
  valves seats had been cut to the point where the rocker shafts rested on
  the retainer and compressed the valve. That isn't right. I don't think a
  Type IV seat installed at the correct height could be cut so far
  (correctly, without cutting out of the seat) that the valve is that deep
  into the rocker box. But this is just speculation. Shimming the rockers is
  about all you could do--but I think spring tension would be way low in this
  case.</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1">Something I recently noticed: the 1.7 style rockers with
  8mm adjusting screws perhaps have a different ratio and are not
  interchangeable with 2.0 rockers (or maybe the rocker shafts are set at a
  slightly different height?) Perhaps the real problem were the 1.7 heads
  rebuilt for the 2.0 engine, or perhaps the difference was my imagination
  (?). Or perhaps the early, solid lifter 1.7 components and the 2.0
  hydraulic valve train isn't strictly interchangeable. Regardless, something
  is incorrect in that situation. There should always be adequate clearance
  between the rocker arm and the retainer.</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1">It is important that the adjuster screws stick out past
  the face of the rockers for the entire distance where they are turned down
  and probably a couple of threads. If anything (with machined valve tips)
  they should be sticking out more. Generally speaking, for all the prior
  procedures, it is a good bet that ALL 8 ADJUSTER SCREWS best be turned in
  about the same amount if everything is correct. If one is drastically
  different from the others, something is wrong: the pushrod is not seated
  correctly, the rocker shaft isn't tightened, you adjusted at the wrong
  time, or a variation on that theme.</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1">The tips of all the valves should be level. Determine
  this with the rockers removed and a straight edge across the tips. If there
  is a minute difference, the tips might've been machined or there might be a
  small variance in the valve seats--this is acceptible. However, if one of
  the valves is sticking out over 1/16" when all the rocker shafts are off,
  you have the beginning of seat recession. If that cylinder's compression
  measures at 90 psi or so, you'll soon need a new set of heads or an engine
  rebuild. Heads will run with a seat pounded 1/8" into the head, but not
  well. In that case, all the adjustment in the world isn't going to help
  you.</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1">A final note: if you do have a couple very bad lifters
  and they disturb you (even the 10 minute tapping) replace them. They only
  cost about $10 from Bus Depot, more from RMMW. This might not be a great
  idea though since the lifter isn't guaranteed to be a great match for the
  hardness of the cam. Also, some of the replacement lifters have a smaller
  hole in the side of the body than the original had and might be less
  inclined to purge air. If you do install a new, replacement lifter, make
  sure it was properly bench bled solid before installation.</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1">As I've implied, all these problems tend to show on old,
  high mileage vans. By the time you have 125k miles on a poorly maintained
  Type IV engine, chances are that the cam is beginning to wear with the
  hydraulic lifters, and the heads are soon to go, etc. Replacing some things
  may buy you time but you must carefully consider everything you do. For
  instance, $500 in heads on an engine whose cam is failing doesn't make a
  lot of sense. Perhaps you should save for a new engine.</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1">A lot of vans get sold this way. A novice bus buyer
  overpays for a bus ($2500 for a $1000 bus), then 6 months later has $600
  heads installed (often badly by non-VW mechanic who leaves big gaps in the
  tin). Six months or a year passes and the engine is dead and the novice
  sells the bus at a loss, unaware of the dynamics at play. Be smart, trust
  your own good judgement and do your research. Read a copy of Tom Wilson's
  "How to Rebuild a Volkswagen Air Cooled Engine" book and read it even if
  you never intend to rebuild your own engine. Do it so you can speak
  intelligently to a shop.

-->

   At least run the checks Muir describes before ever buying a bus in the
  first place. <a href="http://www.bostonengine.com">Bob Donalds</a> also has
  some sensible words on this subject. You might want to look at his thoughts
