<h3>Engine Case Sealants</h3>
<p>by Jim Thompson, John Anderson, and Richard T. Perry</p>
<hr size="2">
<p><font size="+1">Jim Thompson recommends:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Curil K2 $9.99 for a 175G Tin w/o handpump (With
the neat pump it's $17.94)<br>
Curil T $7.25 for a 100G Tube</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">A few machine shops in the area and most of our
wholesale customers back East buy the stuff a lot because they say
it's hard to find and won't use any other types of compounds. Guess
they want the original stuff.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Been using the K2 on case halves for an untold
amount of years - no leaks ever. Also used Permatex 3H (Aviation
Form-a-Gasket) with equal results when I couldn't find the K2 -
probably better priced too, even from the "Fast-Food" FLAPS, such
as Chief, Kragen, Checker, Pep Boys, etc.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Also carry another Curil product (actually
Elring-Germany makes them all) called Dirko, which is an elastic
sealing and filling compound. $8.95 for 100G tube. Works great
sealing the gear reduction boxes.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">John Anderson says:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Might want to consider the Loctite 574 (orange),
supposed to be a bit thicker (but not at all thick) and offer a
more reasonable crush. Also most Porsche racers around me recommend
it as the best stuff hands down ($13 for a 50 ml tube
locally--note: Automotion wants $25 for the same).</font></p>
<hr>
<p><font size="+1">Ron Van Ness says:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Be attentive when applying sealer to the case
halves. I purchased a bottle of Permatex 3H that had a cap top
brush applicator with loose hairs. Every few brush strokes a hair
would leave the brush, depositing itself on the case seam surface.
Examine the cap brush for loose hairs and have a reliable
applicator on hand if necessary.</font></p>

<blockquote><font size="+1"><i>"This weekend I hope to assemble the
bottom end of my stock 2 liter engine. I'm planning on using
Permatex Aviation Form A Gasket on the split-line, but I've got the
" thread in the sealant " method on my mind. Have any of you ever
done this, and what where your experiences ? I know that method is
used on aircraft engines, but there it is expected. What good is it
to measure bearing journals to the ten thousandths and then do
something that will have a measurable, even if small,
effect?"</i></font></blockquote>
<font size="+1">Richard T. Perry offers:</font>
<p><font size="+1">String in the Permatex Method</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">As an A&amp;P mechanic, I've done this a few
times. Frankly, I don't have all that much experience in engine
overhaul, and I don't have a manual handy, but here goes. First,
you use the Permatex you mentioned, and a (I'm dredging this up
from DEEP memory) "00" silk thread. The procedure goes something
like this:</font></p>
<ol>
<li><font size="+1">Clean everything carefully. This method will
only work with perfectly clean flanges. When cleaning, ensure that
you're using a scraper that's softer than the flange, too...scratch
the flanges up and you're done.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Put down a small layer of Permatex, and smear
to cover flanges evenly with a finger. This is not a case of more
is better. Put on too much, and the SOB will leak forever. Try not
to get much into the case-half-bolt-holes. You know you've got the
right thickness of permatex when it looks like you've just colored
the surface, but can still see the surface through the
permatex.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Let the permatex get a little tacky (5-10
minutes? It's been a WHILE), then carefully lay down the thread on
one flange. Use a double thread, (i.e. two different threads or lay
it in once , then bring it back through) and ensure that they NEVER
cross over each other. That, too, will make it leak. Ensure that
the string doesn't interfere with the bolt-holes, btw. I usually
try to put both layers on the inside of the holes all the way
around.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Assemble the engine and tighten the case half
bolts to the spec torque.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Take a sharp knife and trim the string off
flush where it comes out of the case parting surface.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Let sit for 24 hours before introducing fluids
(oil, specifically) to the crankcase.</font></li>
</ol>
<font size="+1">When this is done right, it won't leak in a
standard overhaul period.</font>
<p><font size="+1">Now - big disclaimers are in order here. I
haven't done this in a while, and I'm not looking at a manual, and
(MOST IMPORTANT) this is the procedure for a Lycoming (I think it
was a O-320-A4K, last) not a VW. Your Milage WILL vary. I've never
torn a VW apart, (I'm a wannabusser right now), and I don't know
what kind of standards they had for those surfaces. For instance,
in an aircraft engine (with a few exceptions), the case halves are
cast as a unit. Cannot be individually replaced [editor's note: VW
case halves are also matched pairs].</font></p>
