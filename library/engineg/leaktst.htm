<h3>Leak Down Test</h3>
<p>by Dennis Haynes</p>

<p><font size="+1">A number of people have asked "What is a LEAK
DOWN test?" and "Can I do it myself?". First, let me explain the
concept. We already use a compression test to determine an engines
condiditon. the problem with this test is that there are too many
variables. It can only be used to check engine condition by
comparing cylinders to each other or a past norm. Variables such as
cam profile, engine cranking speed etc, will affect the
readings.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">A leak down tester uses air from a compressor
and measures the rate at which it leaks through the engine. This is
done with the engine not running and the beauty of this is that toy
can find the source of the leakage by listening for the escaped
air. Internal leakge is found by air bubbles in the cooling system.
Tools need are a leakdown tester, and an air compressor. The tester
is available from Milton at about $60.00. Compressor should be at
least 2hp and deliver 90psi.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Procedure: Remove spark plugs. Set engine to TDC
#1. Calibrate test gauge per the instructions. Lock engine so it
can not turn. Conect hose to spark plug hole, Conect pressurized
gauge to hose connection. Read leakage. If looking for coolant
leaks and nothing obvious shows up, bypass gauge and connect shop
air direct to cylinder. Open radiator cap before this. If coolant
sprays out, you have a head problem. Do same test on rest of
cylinders. Remember to set TDC of each piston for compression
stroke. This test is also great for air cooled haed leaks and valve
problems. Note that all engines will have some leakge past the
rings. I always do full pressure test when I suspect a problem.
Make sure engine is secured with full pressure test. it will spin
violently. With gauge connected, you can rock crankshaft to see if
leakage changes. If so, this is a sign that the ring lands are
wearing, new engines will also do this until the rings are
seated.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I know these instructions are kinda flaky, but I
hope this gives some insight as to this type of test. If having a
mechanic work on your vehicle, he should be familiar with the
leakdown test. I would be concerned if he isn't. This is a basic
troubleshooting tool that all fleets use. Especially on
diesels.</font></p>
