<h3>Engine Pinging</h3>
<p>by David Schwarze</p>
<hr size="2">
<blockquote><font size="+1"><i>"...The piston can overheat and
knocking can and will occur. This knocking is caused by ignition of
the gas/air mix in your cylinder before the spark of the spark
plug. This causes temperature and pressure peaks that will melt
your piston, crack your cylinder head, and drop one of your exhaust
valves. You have heard about those abrupt deaths of air cooled
engines..."</i></font></blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Pinging sounds like rocks being thrown around
inside your engine. It will never happen at idle, may happen at
part throttle, but is most likely to happen at full throttle. It is
usually accompanied by a small amount of smoke out of the tailpipe,
but don't rely on that.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Pinging is like... taking a cutting torch to
your combustion chamber. Your engine can stand anywhere from less
than one second to perhaps minute of pinging before it suffers
permanent and serious damage, depending on conditions.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The hotter your engine is, the more likely your
engine is to ping. The farther your timing is advanced, the more
likely your engine is to ping. The higher your compression ratio
is, the more likely your engine is to ping. The lower the octane of
gas you use, the more likely your engine is to ping.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">So, in order to minimize the risk of pinging, do
the following:</font></p>
<ol>
<li><font size="+1">Make sure your engine doesn't over
heat!</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Make sure your timing is not too far
advanced.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Make sure your compression ratio is not too
high (&lt; 7.5 to 1)</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">If necessary, use higher octane
gas.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font size="+1">If you take care of the first three, you
shouldn't have to worry about the last one.<br></font></p>
