Question: <i> Is it possible to install the CHT sensor into the EGR hole of the 1800cc head? The threads aren't the same but I feel I could "adjust" it somewhat.</i>
<p>
NO NO NO!!! They are NOT EGR ports. They are air injection ports for the smog pump.
<p>
EGR is exhaust gas recirculation. EGR is exhaust gas being added to the intake mixture to lower combustion temps to stop the formation of NOx. 
<p>
 Air injection is used to add air to the exhaust ports to complete the burn to lower HC. 
<p>
 If you stick your #3 temp sensor in the exhaust gas flow, you WILL melt it. It is aluminum! 
<p>
 Get a 10x1.0 tap and a drill bit and enlarge the tin screw hole forward of #3 intake port. 
<p>
 PLUG the air injection ports.
