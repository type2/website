<h3>Pistons and Cylinders</h3>
<p>by Al Brase</p>
<hr size="2">
<p><font size="+1">There are 4 main reasons to replace pistons and
cylinders:</font></p>
<ol>
<li><font size="+1"><b>Worn ring groove lands.</b> Put a new ring
in the groove and check the space that's left with a feeler guage.
I'm a little rusty on numbers but I think that anything more than 4
thousandths (.004) inch is too much.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1"><b>Cylinder wall taper.</b> To measure this
it's really nice to have a bore taper guage. They're expensive and
few shops have them, so what I use is an inside micrometer. This
takes a lot of fiddling around and a lot of "feel" to do a good job
of determining the wear. The wear mostly will be at the top of the
ring travel, just below the ridge. Engines can tolerate some taper
(up to .010 inch) but bear in mind that this makes the rings go in
and out as the pistons go up and down their travel, and a lot of
taper is going to wear out the rings and lands pretty
quickly.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1"><b>Broken fins.</b> The reasons for this are
obvious.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1"><b>Good opportunity to upgrade to a larger
displacement.</b> There is a point of diminishing returns with this
plan. (some think it's 85.5mm, others may feel up to
90.5mm)</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font size="+1">What it mostly boils down to is economics. If
you're a shop, you just sell the customer new parts, make the
markup on them, save them the labor charge of cleaning the old
ones, and the rebuild may last 100,000 miles instead of 50,000
miles (I said may). If you have more time than money, and the
p&amp;c's meet the above specs, then go for it! Personally, I'd
rather spend a couple hours doing something more fun.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Type4 cylinders will have a good life after
re-ringing. The existing GEOMETRY of the pistons and cylinders
makes a big difference. If the motor being rebuilt was ever fried
thru lack of cooling air, oil, too lean or too much advance, they
may be damaged. But my experience is that p&amp;c's always outlast
exhaust valve guides and if you've got the heads off
anyway....</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">A good inside mike is really helpful. Well, a
bore guage is REALLY helpful, measuring anything with an inside
mike takes a lot of feel and practice (but there's only one way to
get the practice, right?). Cylinder wall taper shouldn't be more
than 4 or 5 thousandths of an inch (.004-.005). I've assembled
chevys with 10 but the rings only lasted 20k miles or so. The other
three sides of GEOMETRY(that does describe the essence of it) are
the piston ring grooves. With a new ring in place, there should be
no more than .005 clearance between the groove and the
ring.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Honing</b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Actually, glaze breaking. Real hones are rigid
and used as the final step after a rebore to bring the bore to a
precise size and finish.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Support the cylinder somehow. Best would be
fastening into the case before you clean the case, but you'll NEED
to clean the case then. It's my belief that you don't want to make
the cylinders very rough, but you need some roughness to cause the
rings to wear in. So, use a glaze breaker hone of 180-320 grit,
slather the walls with honing oil (mix solvent or kerosene and
motor oilso it's pretty runny) fasten the glaze breaker into the
slowest drill you can find and move the hone the hone top to bottom
in the cylinder while running the drill. Remember you're not trying
to take out a lot of metal, just giving it a new finish.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The ideal that all the books called for was a 30
degree crosshatch. 25 degrees or 50 degrees, I don't think the
rings know the difference, but try for some crosshatch. Maybe if
your drill isn't very slow you might try triggering it as you move
the hone in and out--30 to 60 seconds in each hole is enough. To
keep the stones wet, I put the oil in an oil can (pump oiler) and
slather it continuously.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Wait, you're not done! Now you've got to get
that cast iron grit out of the pores of the cylinder walls. Chevy
books said soap and hot water were the answer and it's sure easier
to put VW cylinders in the kitchen sink than Chevys, but I think
that clean oil-wetted rags used to wipe them down will work too.
When they don't come out grey, they're clean.<br></font></p>
