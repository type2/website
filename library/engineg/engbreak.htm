<h3>Engine Break-in</h3>
<p>by Joe Fournier</p>
<hr size="2">
<p><font size="+1">Here's what I do for break-in:</font></p>
<ol>
<li><font size="+1">Immediately upon starting, run engine up to
2000 rpm for 20 minutes. Watch oil pressure and temp gauges. You're
letting parts machine themselves to each other for preliminary
fit.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Drain oil while it's hot. Replace before
starting again. If time allows, let engine cool and check
valves.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Inspect drained oil for metal particles. React
accordingly; check for magnetic properties to distinguish aluminum
and brass from iron. Aluminum = bearings...some wear is expected,
but no chunks. Brass = timing gear or valve guides. Shouldn't find
much of this, if any. Iron/steel = crank, cam, rings,
cylinders...definitely no chunks, but I'd expect *some* of this in
breakin oil.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Run engine for 5-10 miles doing the drive up to
55; then wind (down-shift) down to 20 mph...at least 5 times...as
many as 10. You're letting parts further machine themselves to each
other with the emphasis being on the cylinders, which must machine
themselves under load because their position/geometry is slightly
different at different RPMs...thus, the variance in RPMs and the
downshifting. I don't fully understand this, but Bob Hoover
instructed me to do this and I do it religiously. I consider this
as important if not more important that the 20 minute
breakin.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Let sit over night. Check valves.</font>
<p><font size="+1">I record all valve settings (per valve) and
maintain that information for the first 300 miles. I check and
adjust valves at the following times:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">after 20 minute break-in<br>
after 5-10 mile break-in<br>
at 25 miles<br>
at 50 miles<br>
at 150 miles<br>
at 300 miles<br></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">If I notice trends, I check more often. Since
work is about 25 miles round trip, I usually get pretty close on
these.</font></p>
</li>
<li><font size="+1">At 300 miles, pull the engine and retorque the
heads. This is a step many people skip, but I'm not inclined to. It
will tell you a lot about how your engine is running and is
neccessary to assure engine longevity and reliability. It gives you
a chance to tighten up tinware and do those things that you meant
to do but were in too much of a hurry to do the first time
around.</font></li>
