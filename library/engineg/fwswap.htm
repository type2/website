<h3>Flywheel Swap ('72-'79 Type 2)</h3>
<p>by Jim Thompson</p>
<hr size="2">
<p><font size="+1">The following flywheels were originally equipped
on the Type 4 based engine Bus 72-79:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">72-74 1700 210mm Flywheel</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">74-75 1800 215mm Flywheel</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">76-79 2000 228mm Flywheel</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Theoretically, any of the 3 flywheels above will
directly "bolt-on". However, when using a 228mm Flywheel on 72-75
models, the original 002 Bell Housing and SR15X Starter <b>must be
changed</b> to the 76-79 091 Bell Housing and 76-79 Starter
(SR87X). Do this complete with the Clutch Operating Shaft (the
Release Bearing is the same 71-79 - PN 113-141-165B). In other
words: use the 091 Clutch Shaft when making this swap.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Remember - if the flywheel is changed, the
crankshaft end play must be re-set. If you just resurface your old
flywheel, you "should not" have to re-set the end play. However,
it's most wise to check the end play anyway when removing and
re-using your old flywheel to insure the end play doesn't exceed
.006".</font></p>
