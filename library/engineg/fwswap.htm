<h3>Flywheel Swap ('72-'79 Type 2)
<p>by Jim Thompson</h3>

<p>
The following flywheels were originally equipped on the Type 4 based
engine Bus 72-79:
<p>

72-74   1700   210mm Flywheel
<p>

74-75   1800   215mm Flywheel
<p>

76-79   2000   228mm Flywheel
<p>

Theoretically, any of the 3 flywheels above will directly "bolt-on". 
However, when using a 228mm Flywheel on 72-75 models, the original 002
Bell Housing and SR15X Starter <B>must be changed</B> to the 76-79 091 Bell
Housing and 76-79 Starter (SR87X).  Do this complete with the Clutch
Operating Shaft (the Release Bearing is the same 71-79 - PN
113-141-165B).  In other words: use the 091 Clutch Shaft when making this swap.
<p>

Remember - if the flywheel is changed, the crankshaft end play must be
re-set.  If you just resurface your old flywheel, you "should not" have to 
re-set the end play.  However, it's most wise to check the end play anyway when 
removing and re-using your old flywheel to insure the end play doesn't exceed .006".
