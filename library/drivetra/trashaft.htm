<h3>Tranny Shaft Pulls out of Tranny</h3>
<p>by Robert S. Hoover</p>

<blockquote><font size="+1"><i>"That shaft that comes out the back
of the trans and goes into the pilot bearing? I know two people
(Joe and Marc) who have tried to pull the engine and ended up
unintentionaly pulling that shaft out just this week. Marc tried to
put his back together but now his bus doesn't move. Joe hasn't
reassembled yet.</i></font>
<p><font size="+1"><i>If you have time could you give the lowdown
on what causes that, and whether it's a catastrophic sort of
thing?"</i></font></p>

<p><font size="+1">The mainshaft comes out when the circlip and
coaxial stud has failed, which usually results -- although not
immediately -- from a rear-end collision or colliding with
something while backing up.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">If the damage is isolated to the mainshaft,
reversing gear, keeper and coaxial stud, the repair is relatively
easy although the disassembly/reassembly is a pain in the
ass.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I don't know if any of the manuals address this
specific repair procedure. In most cases of main-shaft
disengagement there are other, more serious problems to be dealt
with. Repairing only the mainshaft could be the waste of a vast
amount of effort, if after the job you discover you also have a
shifter-fork or gear-cluster problem.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">However, with the above as a precautionary
prologue, the repair goes something like this:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Drop the engine and pull the transmission. On a
bus, pull the outboard gear reduction units and strip everything
down until you have bare axles. Unbolt the driver's-side cover
plate from the tranny, seat the PASSENGER-SIDE axle fully into the
differential side-gear and GENTLY drive the differential and
driver's-side cover-plate out of the tranny using a lead or copper
mallet.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Keep the shim stacks together. This is
vital.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">With the differential out of the way you will be
able to diagnose the root problem, which is usually a sheared
coaxial stud -- it is a dinky 6mm stud, treaded on both ends, that
screws into the center-line bore of the tranny's input shaft, and
into the mainshaft.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The coaxial stud is only for alignment, not
power transmission. Power from the engine to the transmission is
transmitted via the reverse-gear coupling sleeve which slips over
BOTH the mainshaft and input shaft. The reverse-gear coupling is
held in place by a circlip on the mainshaft.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">If the coaxial stud is sheared in the input
shaft the repair may require dismantling the transmission (so far
we've only been dealing with the differential). The typical bus
owner is unlikely to have the tools or skills needed to tackle this
level of tranny repair. But if the failure is limited to a problem
with the mainshaft, reverse-gear coupling and circlip, the repair
usually involves only the replacement of any damaged
component.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Taken slowly, with constant reference to the
manuals, this repair is within the capabilities of the novice but
there is such a range of variables, any one of which can lead to
more difficult tasks, that it would be wise to consider replacing
the tranny as a unit, allowing you to repair the removed unit in a
bench-top environment.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">-Bob Hoover</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">PS -- It should be obvious that any repair that
requires removal of both the engine and transmission provides an
opportunity to perform maintenance, repairs and replacments to
related systems, such as the shifting linking, outboard gear
reduction units, rear brakes, heater ducting and so forth. --
