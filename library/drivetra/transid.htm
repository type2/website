<h3>T2 Transmissions/Gearboxes</h3>
<p>by Todd Hill, VolksWerks Transaxles, Olympia, WA</p>

<blockquote><font size="+1"><i>"Is there any way to identify the
year of manufacture of a type II transmission by external case
stampings or any other external method?"</i></font></blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">What year Bus we talking about?</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The '68s were a one year only style maincase in
which both of the side covers under the inner CV flanges were held
on by studs and acorn nuts rather than the later screw in style
retainers.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">1969-1974 pretty much look the same except that
the '71-'74s use the later style T/O bearing and clutch
arm.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The 1975s are also a one year only 002 maincase
with 5 larger ribs vs. the 3 ribbed earlier cases. Also, AFAIK,
starting in 1975 the last digit of the serial number reflects the
year in which it was made. But since it is the 5 rib version you'll
know its a '75 simply by looking at it.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Internally the transaxles are the same with some
minor modifications changes in gear ratios, and ring and pinion
sets.<br></font></p>
