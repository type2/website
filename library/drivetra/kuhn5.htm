<h3>Clutch Removal and Replacement (Type 1 Engine)</h3>

<tr>
<td><font size="4">VW clutches are single dry disc types mounted on
the flywheel. Between 1961 and 1970, VW used a coil spring pressure
plate type clutch assembly. Later models used a diaphragm spring
type.</font>
<p><font size="4">From 1961 to 1965 (I think), Volkswagen used a
carbon clutch relase bearing. In 1966 (or possibly 1967),
Volkswagen used a conventional ball bearing type.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">Removal of the clutch assembly is a fairly
straight forward repair. The hardest part, I feel, is the removal
of the <a href="../engineg.htm#10">engine</a>. But even that isn't
that hard to accomplish.</font></p>

will also need the following:</font>
<ul>
<li><font size="4">Clutch pilot tool. Your auto parts store should
have this tool and it doesn't cost all that much. I think mine was
about $3.95 (US). The main shaft from an old broken tranny also
makes an excellent clutch pilot tool. I don't think it's worth
renting this tool because of the low cost.</font></li>
<li><font size="4">A cleaning solvent; trichloroethlene (a
non-petroleum base cleaner). Most auto parts store will have this
cleaner.</font></li>
<li><font size="4">A medium-fine emery cloth.</font></li>
<li><font size="4">A dial indicator to check the roundout on the
flywheel.</font></li>
</ul>

</table>
<table border="0" width="80%" cellpadding="10">
<tr>
<td><font size="4">Before you assume that the clutch needs
replacing, do some simple checks:</font>
<ul>
<li><font size="4">What's the free pedal play like? Is it within
specs (see below)?</font></li>
<li><font size="4">If the cable is good, find a nice level area.
Place the car in neutral with the engine running and apply the
parking brake. Now shift into 2nd gear and slowly let the clutch
out. If the clutch is strong, the engine will stall. If the it
doesn't stall then replacement of the clutch assembly is
needed.</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font size="4">If you're doing an engine rebuild or swap,
replacement of the clutch should be done unless the old one has
little miles on it. In any case, the <a href=
"../engineg.htm#10">engine has to be removed.</a></font></p>

<h1><font size="4">Removal</font></h1>
<ul>
<li><font size="4"><a href="../engineg.htm#10">Remove the
engine</a> first.</font></li>
<li><font size="4">Mark the flywheel and the clutch cover for later
reassembly. Use something like a sharp punch. I've known some
people to use paint.</font></li>
<li><font size="4">Remove the bolts securing the clutch cover ...
one turn at a time ... Do this diagonally opposite one another
rather than working directly around the cover. This will help
ensure that heavy spring pressure will not warp the clutch
cover.</font></li>
<li><font size="4">Once the spring pressure has been relieved,
remove each bolt.</font></li>
<li><font size="4">Now remove the clutch.</font></li>
</ul>
<h1><font size="4">Inspection</font></h1>
<p><font size="4"><i>If you are going to reuse your old clutch
components, then be sure to do the following inspection/checks. In
my humble oppinion, since you've gone through the trouble of
removing the clutch assembly, why not just replace the assembly?
Most clutch kits come complete with clutch, pressure plate and
sometimes throw out bearing. Flywheels are usually not included in
said kit as they don't normally need replacing during a clutch
R&amp;R. If it's not in the budget at this time, then read and do
the following.</i></font></p>
<ul>
<li><font size="4">Clean the flywheel face and pressure plate
assembly. I use trichloroethlene (a non-petroleum base cleaner).
Most auto parts store will carry this sort of cleaner.</font></li>
<li><font size="4">Check flywheel for any signs of grooves and
scratches. Check the runout with a dial indicator and compare it to
the specs listed above. The flywheel might need to be regrounded.
If it's really warped, which can be felt by your hand, replace
it.</font></li>
<li><font size="4">Check the pressure place for cracked or broken
springs, signs of heat, cracked/scored friction surfaces and
looseness. Be sure to check the release lever ends for wear. On
diaphragm spring clutches, check the spring fingers for wear. If
there is any damage, replace the pressure plate.</font></li>
<li><font size="4">Now check the clutch disc (drive plate) lining
for wear, cracks, burn and oil. The assembled thickness of the disc
should be at least 0.36 in. Also be sure to check for loose rivets
and cracks in the spring leaves or the carrier plate. Check that
the disck slides freely on the transmission spline without
excessive radial play. Replace the disc if it fails to meet any of
the areas listed.</font></li>
<li><font size="4">Check the throw out bearing (release bearing)
for wear. <b>DO NOT WASH THE BEARING IN ANY SORT OF SOLVENT !!!</b>
Wipe it with a clean-dry clotch. I don't like the idea of re-using
an *old* throw out bearing. You should <a href=
"kuhn6.htm">replace</a> this bearing even if you are going to reuse
the old clutch assembly. A lot of clutch problems are because of
the throw out bearing not functioning properly. That's just my
oppinion.</font></li>
</ul>
<h1><font size="4">Putting it all back together</font></h1>
<center><font size="4"><i>*** Be sure your hands are clean of all
oil and grease before proceeding ***</i></font></center>
<ul>
<li><font size="4">With a medium-fine emery cloth, sand the
friction surface of the flywheel and pressure plate. Sand
<b>lightly</b> across the surfaces (not around) until they are
covered with fine scratches. This breaks the glaze and aids in
seating a new clutch disc. Or at least that's what was taught to
me.</font></li>
<li><font size="4">Clean up the flywheel and pressure plate with
trichloroethlene type solvent (or something
equivalent).</font></li>
<li><font size="4">Insert the clutch disc. Place the pressure plate
in position and line up the marks you made earlier. If you are
installing a new or a rebuilt pressure plate, align the clutch
assembly with the balance marks 180 degrees from each other. The
balance marks, painted on the edge of the flywheel and clutch
assembly, show the heaviest side of the part.</font></li>
<li><font size="4">Center the clutch disc over the gland nut hole
with a pilot (alignment tool).</font></li>
<li><font size="4">Start all pressure plate bolts, finger tight.
Tighten diagonally opposite bolts a few turns at a time until all
are tight. Torque to 18 ft.-lb. (2.5 mkg).</font></li>
<li><font size="4">Remove the pilot tool.</font></li>
<li><font size="4">Measure the height of the release plate above
the flywheel with a straightedge and depth gauge. This dimension
should be 1.06 - 1.18 in. (26.7 - 30mm). Measure dimension at 6 or
more points around the flywheel. If this not correct, or if any 2
of the readings are more than 0.02 in. (0.5mm) apart, the clutch
pressure plate fingers require adjustment. I don't really know
what's involved in this and have been told that the only way to do
this correctly is to take the flywheel and the clutch assembly to a
VW dealer (or a shoppe that know's how to do this adjustment) and
have them do it.</font></li>
</ul>
<font size="4">We're done! That wasn't so hard, now was
it?</font></td>
