<h3>CV Joint Boots</h3>
<p>by George Lyle</p>
<hr size="2">
<blockquote><font size="+1"><i>Has anyone had cv joint boots get
tears in them after a few thousand miles? ...Are some boots better
than others?</i></font></blockquote>
<font size="+1">Yes! Boots don't seem to be as durable as they used
to be. I've had poor luck with Lobro, Qualitat, and even the cheapo
taiwan boots that I tried out of desperation.</font>
<p><font size="+1">My local brake supply house provided me with a
set of <a href="http://www.rockfordcv.com/">Rockford
Dura-boots</a>. These are made in USA and seem to have much higher
quality rubber than the others. The part number for a bus is
814-21. The boot design is closer to the type used by FWD cars than
the accordian-pleats of the others, so restoration folks might not
be happy with them. I've only been using them for a year, but they
are showing _no_ signs of wear or cracking. They cost around $15
each with grease, but no bolts.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">One quirk with the Rockford boots: They are a
bit shorter than stock, so the boot won't go between the "bumps" on
the axle. I placed the boot just outboard of the outboard "bump" on
the shaft and the boot fit fine.<br></font></p>
