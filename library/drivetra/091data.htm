<h3>091 Transmission Data</h3>
<p>by David Schwarze</p>
<hr size="2">
<blockquote><font size="+1"><i>"All T4 trannies have the same
ratios in 1st, 2nd, and 3rd gears. The differences appear in 4th
gear and final drive ratios. From '68 through chassis 213 2068 548
(mid '73) the 4th gear ratio was 0.82. From there on to '79 the 4th
gear was 0.89."</i></font></blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">I've seen that published too, but my experience
didn't bear it out. I have a late '73 bus with chassis number well
after the one above, but my 4th gear was .82. Didn't find out till
it was too late. :-(</font></p>
<blockquote><font size="+1"><i>"The final drive ratio changed also,
but at a different chassis #. From '68 through the end of the '73
model year (chassis 213 2300 001) the final drive was
5.375."</i></font></blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">I think it's till the beginning of the '74 model
year.</font></p>
<blockquote><font size="+1"><i>"Starting in 1974 chassis 214 2000
001) the final drive was changed to 4.867 through the end of the
breadloaf series."</i></font></blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Not true - only '74 and '75 had the 4.867. 76-79
has 4.57 final drive (with the .89 4th gear).</font></p>
<blockquote><font size="+1"><i>"I happen now to own one of those
oddball 0.89 4th gear, 5.375 final drive
trannies."</i></font></blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">I used to think that too. I'd be really suprised
if you have one (I think they don't exist). Knowing the final
drive, you could put it in gear, mark the shaft and prove me right
or wrong by counting the number of turns on the input shaft vs. the
output shafts.</font></p>
<blockquote><font size="+1"><i>"I also own a '78 tranny Tranny with
the 0.82 4th and a 4.867 final drive, which allows 70+ cruising
speeds, but quickly forces a drop in gears when you enter the
mountains."</i></font></blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">I think you have .89 4th and 4.57 final drive on
that tranny.</font></p>
<blockquote><font size="+1"><i>"The advice I was seeking, since I
am planning a cross country trip this June, is on which way to
compromise. Should I seek the higher "flatland" speed across the
midwest, or would the lower gearing of the late '73 tranny allow me
to maintain speed in the mountains. The powerplant for this
assemblage, BTW, is a '78 2L FI engine in a '73
body."</i></font></blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">I still say keep the higher geared box. You'll
do a lot more flat interstate than you will mountain passes. Here's
a clip from a spreadsheet I made to help figure things out. The
bastard transmission is a 78 case with the .88 4th gear and an
oddball European ring and pinion (5.43/1) which combine for a
serious stump puller. I used .88 for the 4th gear ratio in the
later trans, but it may be .89. I've seen both in print and I
haven't bothered to find out which it really is yet. Is it any
wonder I don't trust anything I read about these tranny ratios
anymore? The ideal trans is one I'm going to have built from my
original '73 box with the .82 4th gear and the 4.86 ring and pinion
from the '75 installed. I feel it will be a good compromise between
freeway cruising speed and hill pulling in the lower
gears.</font></p>

----------------------------------------------
79 trans        32/7    4.57    4.02
75 trans        34/7    4.86    4.27

</font></pre>
<font size="+1">And since that may have been a little confusing,
here's another one that's a bit easier to understand. The first
column is overall ratio in 4th gear, and the second column is how
many RPMs you'll be turning at 60 mph with brand new 215/75R14
tires in back. Note that these tires are rather large. When I had
205/70's on the rear (which are comparable diameter to 195/75/14
btw) the RPMs were about 75-100 higher.</font>
<pre><font size="+1">
               4th      rpm@60mph
----------------------------------------------
79 trans       4.02     3326
75 trans       4.27     3534
late 73 trans  4.41     3644
bastard trans  4.78     3950
ideal trans    3.98     3293
</font></pre>
<p><font size="+1">Some of you are thinking that 3293 is a bit too
low for the motor to be turning on the freeway, and you're probably
right. It's okay though, because I'll be going back to smaller rear
tires when I get this trans, which should put me at about 3375-3400
@ 60mph, which is exactly where I want to be (I'll normally be
going 65ish anyway). One final thing to note is that putting bigger
tires on the back of your bus isn't going to mess up the
speedometer, because the speedometer is driven off of the front
wheels.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The 091 trannies started in 76 in the US. At
this time my best guess is that sometime in 74 they changed from
5.375 to 4.86, still in the 002 case. In 76 they started with the
4.57 and the 091 case. The 75 case was one year only, 002 number
but with 091 style ribs on it.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">This is one area where the Bentley appears to be
a poor source of information. You really can't be sure what you've
got until you open it up and look. You can just make an educated
guess.</font></p>
