It's easy.  On your 71, at the shifter loosen the bolts fore
and aft of it--loosen, don't take them out.  Moving the shifter base towards
the front favors engagement of 2, 4th and Reverse, moving towards the
rear 1st and 3rd.  Once adjusted, retighten the bolts.
<p>
Make sure however that the shift coupling square headed
screws are properly seated and that the tranny nose mount is secure..
