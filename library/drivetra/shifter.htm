<h3>Shifter Adjustment</h3>
<p>by Will Wood</p>
<hr size="2">
<p><font size="+1">It's easy. On your 71, at the shifter loosen the
bolts fore and aft of it--loosen, don't take them out. Moving the
shifter base towards the front favors engagement of 2, 4th and
Reverse, moving towards the rear 1st and 3rd. Once adjusted,
retighten the bolts.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Make sure however that the shift coupling square
headed screws are properly seated and that the tranny nose mount is
secure..<br></font></p>
