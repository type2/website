<h1>Throw out bearing replacement</h1>
<p></center>

The throw out bearing (release bearing) is mounted in the tranny case.  Removal of the <a href="../engineg.htm#10">engine</a> is required.<p>

I feel that the throw out bearing should always be replaced whenever the <a href="kuhn5.htm">clutch assembly is being replaced</a>.  Other people may disagree with me and say that it's not needed.  The only reasons that I see for not replacing the bearing during a <a href="kuhn5.htm">clutch R&R</a> would be because the lack of money at the time or the bearing was replaced recently.<p>

Otherwise, I don't see the logic in ignoring this simple R&R.<p>


If you have a carbon release bearing, consider upgrading to the newer ball bearing type instead of another carbon block.  Consult your VW dealer/parts place for the correct ball bearing type.<p>

To remove the bearing, unhook the retaining clips and slide the bearing off.<p>

A simple check (and probably the only check) is to lightly press the outer race against the inner race and rotate the outer race and feel for any binding/roughness.  It should be smooth and fairly quiet.  If not, it's defective and requires replacement.<p>

All the throw out bearings that I've seen are prelubricated and sealed.  So there is no way to re-pack this bearing.  Do not spray any sort of lubricant inbetween the races either.  And <b>DO NOT WASH THE BEARING IN ANY SORT OF CLEANING SOLVENT !!!</b>  Wipe the bearing with a dry-clean cloth.<p>

Before installing a new bearing, I like to lightly sand the plastic ring with a medium coarse emery cloth.  Then I lubricate the sanded surface with a molybenum disulphate paste (they come in powder form too).  This can be got at just about any auto parts store.<p>

Now lubricate the contact points between the fork and bearing with lithium grease and place the bearing back in the tranny case.<p>

Re-install the retaining clips and we're done.
