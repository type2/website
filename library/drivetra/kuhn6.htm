<font size="4">The throw out bearing (release bearing) is mounted
in the tranny case. Removal of the <a href=
"../engineg.htm#10">engine</a> is required.</font>
<p><font size="4">I feel that the throw out bearing should always
be replaced whenever the <a href="kuhn5.htm">clutch assembly is
being replaced</a>. Other people may disagree with me and say that
it's not needed. The only reasons that I see for not replacing the
bearing during a <a href="kuhn5.htm">clutch R&amp;R</a> would be
because the lack of money at the time or the bearing was replaced
recently.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">Otherwise, I don't see the logic in ignoring this
simple R&amp;R.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">If you have a carbon release bearing, consider
upgrading to the newer ball bearing type instead of another carbon
block. Consult your VW dealer/parts place for the correct ball
bearing type.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">To remove the bearing, unhook the retaining clips
and slide the bearing off.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">A simple check (and probably the only check) is
to lightly press the outer race against the inner race and rotate
the outer race and feel for any binding/roughness. It should be
smooth and fairly quiet. If not, it's defective and requires
replacement.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">All the throw out bearings that I've seen are
prelubricated and sealed. So there is no way to re-pack this
bearing. Do not spray any sort of lubricant inbetween the races
either. And <b>DO NOT WASH THE BEARING IN ANY SORT OF CLEANING
SOLVENT !!!</b> Wipe the bearing with a dry-clean cloth.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">Before installing a new bearing, I like to
lightly sand the plastic ring with a medium coarse emery cloth.
Then I lubricate the sanded surface with a molybenum disulphate
paste (they come in powder form too). This can be got at just about
any auto parts store.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">Now lubricate the contact points between the fork
and bearing with lithium grease and place the bearing back in the
tranny case.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">Re-install the retaining clips and we're
done.</font></p>
