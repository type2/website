<h3>Swing-axle Boots</h3>
<p>by Clara Williams</p>
<hr size="2">
<p><font size="+1">You know those boots on your swing axle tranny?
How it has that row of little nuts and bolts holding the split
closed? Well, your swing axle tranny didn't come like that- it came
with a boot with no split. This is sometimes seen on very crusty
VWs, and as seen on a swing axle bug tranny someone gave me
(condition unknown, presumed core status)</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I liked the idea of putting non split tranny
boots on the tranny for my westy. I obtained a pair of said boots,
which seem sturdy. They would not pry over the end of the axle tube
(axles are off) that goes into the center section, as the flange
was too big (even when using hot water to soften and stretch the
boots). After a bit, I accepted what the book said about having the
reduction gear housing removed to put the boots on, though still
concerned about the rubber bumper mount on the tube, and the brake
hose/line clip flange, over which the tranny boots would have to be
stretched.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I believe the boots were originally put on
before all the bits on the tube were welded on. Then the tube was
painted (notice paint line does not extend center section wise from
where the small end of the boot is).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I cannot press the bits off, So I called places.
A lot of places. The results are funny:</font></p>
<ol>
<li><font size="+1">I had to explain to the guy what non split
boots are, when he understood he said just go with split boots.
Wouldn't believe they came with non split boots. He thought it was
a waste of my time/money/energy. Said they never came that way
either. (!)</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">He knew what I meant, but didn't have the stuff
to do them. Said go with split boots.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Old crusty German guy with thick accent. Knew
what I meant. Had done it, maybe 30 years ago. Though I should just
go with split, but would put the boots on (both sides) for
$150.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">This point I am wondering why I am getting this
"go for split" pressure. Perhaps they are afraid. Ha!</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">First guy I talked to said sure, check for a
price, came back saying no go, they won't do it.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Said they'd never done it, but they'd try for
circa $120.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Sells parts only</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">No, won't touch it.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Know what I meant, and why I wanted to do it.
Had done it before (in the past year). Said $60.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font size="+1">So, it turned out when I went to Pei at
Wolfsberg Motorworks, and said how I had tried to get it over the
flange. He clamped that bad boy axle tube in a vice, heated up the
boot with an industrial hair dryer type thing, sprayed some lube
and wrestled that boot in place over the axle flange. It involved
serious pushing and stetching, with his body at a 45 degree angle
pushing hard, but both of them went on without damage, and without
pressing the reduction gear housing off. He changed me less that
the quoted price, too. Guess I could have done it if I just used
more strength, but I was happy with the outcome.<br></font></p>
