Does anyone know if there is such a beast as a hand control for a clutch?  
My left knee has cr*pped out on me and I have been thinking of ways to get 
around converting my beloved bus from a manual shift...

What is probably the slickest set of controls is the "Drive-Matic"
automatic clutch system.   This works very much like the bug's auto stick
shift. It has a microswitch on the gearshift lever and engages the clutch when
you touch it.

The hand controls I have on my van, and the ones I like (so much so that I
am now a distributor) are the Handicaps Inc.  These controls will operate
up to two functions gas/brake, gas/clutch, etc and work well on an
automatic van.

Most all of these can be bought direct and anyone who can take out a type
II engine certainly should be able to get one of these controls installed
and adjusted correctly.  Just remember if you mess up it will come back to
get you at the most inconvenient or dangerous time.
<P>
Also, it seems that possibly the Automatic Stick
Shift from a Type I might also be adapted for use on the Type II.
<P>
When driving there are several "tricks" to make it safer and easier, and I
recommend a special driver's education program.  For those who think they can do it
themselves start in a BIG empty lot and practice until it becomes second
nature to you.  It is not hard merely different.
<P>
Other adaptive aides are also avaliable, including lifts, power steering
add ons ($$$$), and even eye tracking turn signal actuators.  If you have
the desire it is possible to drive.

<P>
The Guidosimplex and Drivematic systems use servos and microswitches.
However Benificial Designs makes one that operates all three pedals with a
cumbersome arrangement to one control (you still need to hold the
steering wheel and shift?).  I know the owner of Benificial Designs and
he makes some really durable and well made equipment, YMMV.

Also buried somewhere in my read mail is a message from a guy who has built
his own hand-operated clutch for a Type 181  (Thing). It is very similar to
the Guidosimplex though.
