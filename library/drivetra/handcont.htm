<h3>Hand Controls for Clutch</h3>
<p>by Access Systems</p>
<hr size="2">
<blockquote><font size="+1"><i>Does anyone know if there is such a
beast as a hand control for a clutch? My left knee has cr*pped out
on me and I have been thinking of ways to get around converting my
beloved bus from a manual shift...</i></font></blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">What is probably the slickest set of controls is
the "Drive-Matic" automatic clutch system. This works very much
like the bug's auto stick shift. It has a microswitch on the
gearshift lever and engages the clutch when you touch
it.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">The hand controls I have on my van, and the ones
I like (so much so that I am now a distributor) are the Handicaps
Inc. These controls will operate up to two functions gas/brake,
gas/clutch, etc and work well on an automatic van.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Most all of these can be bought direct and
anyone who can take out a type II engine certainly should be able
to get one of these controls installed and adjusted correctly. Just
remember if you mess up it will come back to get you at the most
inconvenient or dangerous time.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Also, it seems that possibly the Automatic Stick
Shift from a Type I might also be adapted for use on the Type
II.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">When driving there are several "tricks" to make
it safer and easier, and I recommend a special driver's education
program. For those who think they can do it themselves start in a
BIG empty lot and practice until it becomes second nature to you.
It is not hard merely different.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Other adaptive aides are also avaliable,
including lifts, power steering add ons ($$$$), and even eye
tracking turn signal actuators. If you have the desire it is
possible to drive.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">The Guidosimplex and Drivematic systems use
servos and microswitches. However Benificial Designs makes one that
operates all three pedals with a cumbersome arrangement to one
control (you still need to hold the steering wheel and shift?). I
know the owner of Benificial Designs and he makes some really
durable and well made equipment, YMMV.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Also buried somewhere in my read mail is a
message from a guy who has built his own hand-operated clutch for a
Type 181 (Thing). It is very similar to the Guidosimplex
though.<br></font></p>
