<h3>CV Bolt Removal</h3>
<p>by Ron Van Ness</p>
<hr size="2">
<p><font size="+1">Before any attempt is made to remove the bolt,
clean the head thoroughly with a toothbrush and solvent. The most
common reason for CV bolt removal problems is starting an allen
wrench or tri-square bit in a dirty socket and stripping the bolt
hex. Start clean and you won't need the Vise Grips or the
penetrants. If you still manage to strip the head, you may resort
to a pair of Vise Grips brand "locking pliers" or "vise grips". The
Vise Grips brand is the best because the jaws are treated and more
durable than most other brands. They won't break after a few months
of use and the serrated jaws stay sharp longer.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">A good penetrating oil like Kroil or GM General
Purpose Penetrant and Heat Valve Lubricant (GM Part # 1052627) can
also be an invaluable tool for stubborn bolts. The penetrating oil
has a better chance of working on the inner CV bolts since the
threaded ends are accessible for cleaning and spraying (look behind
the flange on the transmission to which the CV bolts attach). Heat
and vibration are also good tools. A sharp blow with a small hammer
on a stuck bolt head is an appropriate wake up call for frozen
threads.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The orginal bolts are an allen head socket but
later replacement bolts have a modern tri-square or "triple square"
socket head design (improved engineering for more torque). Though
they look similar, the "tri-square" is NOT a "Torqx" head, so do
not use a Torqx wrench, you will just ruin the bolt head. Good
parts stores will sell both an allen bit and tri-square bit for
your 3/8" socket wrench--a good investment, and much easier to use
and exert torque through than a small allen wrench. After cleaning
the head, tap the bit in squarely with a mallet and go to work with
the ratchet.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">In the case of excessively stubborn bolts, try
grinding flats on opposite sides of the head to to get a better
grip for a wrench or Vise Grips. In the nastiest worse case
scenario you can cut the head off with a Dremel, remove the CV, and
work on the headless bolt still in the transmission flange or on
the wheel's stub axle flange.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">If your problem is with a stuck bolt or bolts on
the outer CV, it might be possible to remove the inner CV bolts and
swing the shaft down, jack up the wheel and remove the axle nut,
and pull or drive the axle shaft with the outer CV off. Then you
can bring the assembly to your vise and work a serious attack on
the bolts. Similarly, if the problem is only with the inner CV
bolts, you can remove the outer CV bolts and swing the axle down
and cut off the offending bolt head on the inner CV. Then remove
the grease cap on the transmission drive flange and release the
flange by removing the circlip. Now you can bring the flange to
your work bench and punish it for its obstinance.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Having stuck bolts on CVs on both ends of an
axle shaft would be the worst case scenario. In that dreadful
instance, if you absolutely were forced to the point of cutting the
bolt heads off, you would then need to remove the transmission for
clearance to remove the axle shaft. But that's never happened to
any VW enthusiast in recorded CV joint repair history. These
scenarios are all extreme hypotheticals--do not surrender and try
these until the situation is hopeless. Vise Grips and a strong arm
(and perhaps some penetrating oil) are usually all that's needed if
you find yourself with a stripped socket.</font></p>
