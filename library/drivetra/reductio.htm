<h3>Newer Reduction Boxes vs Old</h3>

<br>



Let me sum up the pros and cons of both sets.



<hr size =1>



<p>



<LI>'64-'67 Reduction boxes



</p><p>



Larger brakes



Cheaper brake parts (slightly cheaper wheel cylinders if you compare



German ATE cylinders)



Easier to find (and correct for that late split bus)



More expensive bearings



Much more difficult to rebuild (remember that darn *freeze plug* and the



big soft shallow nut)



Are higher geared than earlier boxes (you can use a stock transmission



and achive decent highway speed)



You have to find/use a 46mm socket to remove the axle nut



</p>

<LI>'56-'63 Reduction boxes



</p><p>



Smaller brakes (this is actually more important on the front, but every



bit helps).



More expensive brake parts (Chinese repro parts are not available, you



are forced to purchase German parts)



Harder to find, but correct for your early bus (which was also hard to



find)



Cheaper bearings (3 of the 4 per side are the same bearing as the



beetle, HD versions of this bearing are available)



Easier to rebuild (with a proper bearing puller, I've done both sides in



less than 3 hours!)



Lower gearing (for highway speed, use a custom built transmission with a



higher ring and pinion gear)



You can use the same 36mm socket that is *commonly* available to remove



the axle nuts.



</p><p>



Both boxes have their application, you decide which is correct for you.



I have buses with early, late and no reduction boxes and they all have



their place.

<LI>Barndoor reduction boxes are not sutible for transplant into later



buses, save them for us barndoor nuts. They can be used in a beetle if



you wanna be wierd - use whatever transmission, barndoor reduction boxes



and barndoor spring plates. If you wanna use later boxes on a type1, you



have to make up spacer that go between the spring plate and the



reduction box. This is what the factory did when it assembled Things



with reduction box transmissions.
