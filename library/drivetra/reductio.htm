<h3>Reduction Box Pros and Cons</h3>
<p>by Jason McDaniel</p>
<hr size="2">
<h3><font size="+1">Newer Reduction Boxes vs Old</font></h3>
<font size="+1"><br>
Let me sum up the pros and cons of both sets.</font>
<hr size="1">
<li><font size="+1">'64-'67 Reduction boxes<br>
<br></font>
<p><font size="+1">Larger brakes Cheaper brake parts (slightly
cheaper wheel cylinders if you compare German ATE cylinders) Easier
to find (and correct for that late split bus) More expensive
bearings Much more difficult to rebuild (remember that darn *freeze
plug* and the big soft shallow nut) Are higher geared than earlier
boxes (you can use a stock transmission and achive decent highway
speed) You have to find/use a 46mm socket to remove the axle
nut</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<ul>
<li><font size="+1">'56-'63 Reduction boxes<br>
<br></font>
<p><font size="+1">Smaller brakes (this is actually more important
on the front, but every bit helps). More expensive brake parts
(Chinese repro parts are not available, you are forced to purchase
German parts) Harder to find, but correct for your early bus (which
was also hard to find) Cheaper bearings (3 of the 4 per side are
the same bearing as the beetle, HD versions of this bearing are
available) Easier to rebuild (with a proper bearing puller, I've
done both sides in less than 3 hours!) Lower gearing (for highway
speed, use a custom built transmission with a higher ring and
pinion gear) You can use the same 36mm socket that is *commonly*
available to remove the axle nuts.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Both boxes have their application, you decide
which is correct for you. I have buses with early, late and no
reduction boxes and they all have their place.</font></p>
<hr size="1"></li>
<li><font size="+1">Barndoor reduction boxes are not sutible for
transplant into later buses, save them for us barndoor nuts. They
can be used in a beetle if you wanna be wierd - use whatever
transmission, barndoor reduction boxes and barndoor spring plates.
If you wanna use later boxes on a type1, you have to make up spacer
that go between the spring plate and the reduction box. This is
what the factory did when it assembled Things with reduction box
transmissions.<br>
