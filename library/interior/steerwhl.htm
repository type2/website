 Yes, the padded steering wheel was 78/79. 
<p>
 It will be an instant bolt on swap for the earlier hard plastic steering wheel. 
 Not sure when the splined late column started, somewhere around 74? 
<p>
 The swap has a couple of plusses: 
 The hard wheel gets VERY hot in the sun, soft ones don't. 
 The hard wheels crack, the soft one won't. 
<p>
 The minus: 
 The soft wheel for some strange reason, on humid days, gets sticky. Cleaning it helps a little...... 
<p>
 And I have a couple of the late padded wheels if any one wants one.
