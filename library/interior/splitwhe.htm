<h3>Pulling a '56-'72 Type 2 Steering Wheel</h3>
<p>by Jason McDaniel</p>
<hr size="2">
<p><font size="+1">For '56-'72 Type 2s, you unfortunately cannot
just pull off the old steering wheel. The wheel is wedgemated to
the steering column, that is, there is a slow taper at the end of
the column that matches the taper inside the steering wheel.
Torquing the nut down forces the wheel down on the taper and
*locks* it into place (just like a wedgemated flywheel on a
performance engine). The key and keyways also prevent it from
slipping. I'd imagine that this was done because of the forces that
the bus wheel experienced as folks leaned on it and used it to pull
themselves into the cab. Early Barndoor buses did use splined
shafts like beetles. When you pull wedgemated parts apart you will
experience a *pop* when the parts are forced to release their grip
on each other.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The best way I know of to remove an early bus
steering wheel it to: Make a two piece collar that fits around the
steering column and can be bolted together and obtain a two arm
puller deep enough to go around the base of the steering wheel and
the collar.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Remove the turn signal, and the self cancelling
ring (take out the three screws and lower the ring.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Reinstall the three screws (or three others)
from the self cancelling ring, but do not screw them in till the
heads touch the soft part of the wheel.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">This prevents the puller collar from pulling
against the bakelite portion of the bottom of the steering wheel
(and chipping it), and instead pulls against the screw heads that
are threaded into the metal portion of the wheel. Install the
collar on the steering wheel column. (I use a marine item that
allows a propshaft to pass through a bulkhead or a
hull).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Fit the puller to pull the collar off the
column, taking the steering wheel with it. The puller can build up
a lot of force here, so be careful. I highly recommend that if you
have safari windows, open them to reduce the chance of breaking the
glass (I came close to hitting my OPEN safaris).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">When you reinstall the wheel, use anti-sieze or
grease on the wedgemated part of the column.<br>
