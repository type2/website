<h3>Headliner Replacement</h3>
<p>by Dyer Lytle</p>
<hr size="2">
<p><font size="+1">I installed a new headliner in my '66 standard
microbus. It was a lot of work but the results look good and I am
pleased.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">In the beginning I took the bus to an upholstery
shop and got a quote of $550 to replace the headliner. That seemed
a little steep so I ordered a headliner from Wolfsberg West where I
do most of my mail-order business. (about $150, this includes a few
yards of extra headliner material for recovering the rear panels,
doing the window surrounds, etc.)</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">There were a number of peripheral projects
associated with the headliner replacement. These were included
because in order to replace the headliner I had to remove most of
the interior panels as well as all the (6) pop-out windows. (I
didn't replace the headliner material over the windshields because
it still looks good, but if I had, I would have had to take the
windshields out too.) These associated projects were:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">1. Replace the rubber seals around the pop-out
windows.<br>
2. Repair one of the mounts for one of the pop-out window's
latch.<br>
3. Install sound deadening material in various places behind
panels.<br>
4. Insulate the roof (under the headliner) and the walls.<br>
5. Repair the original interior panels as much as
possible.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I also had to replace the headliner material
around the pop-out windows as well as recover the upper panels on
the sides of the rear cargo area but I consider this part of the
headliner installation.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I started by pulling the pop-out windows out of
the cargo doors and replacing the headliner material that surrounds
those windows (on the inside). I found that the best way to apply
the headliner material to the upper part of the inside of these
doors was to cut a rectangular piece of headliner material larger
then I thought I needed and glue this flat against the metal inside
the door, covering the window. I let the glue dry before I
continued. Then I cut a hole in the middle leaving enough material
around the edges to come to the edge of the window hole when glued.
(I used something called "Automotive GOOP" for this, I don't think
it is the best possible glue but it worked and the contact cement I
tried sort of melted the perforated vinyl.) Then very carefully
working with a razor blade and glue I fit the edges around the
window and the outside edges that wrap around to the edges of the
door, some of which tuck under the door rubber and some of which
have special metal hold-down flanges.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">While waiting for glue to dry I did things like
clean out the old window rubber from the pop out frames and install
new rubber. I only replaced the seal around the outside of the
window frame and the seal around the body hole, I didn't replace
the seal between the window frame and glass because mine didn't
look too bad. The seals that fit in the groove around the outside
edge of the window frames were hard as rock and had to be dug out
with a small screwdriver little by little. Putting in the new seals
took all of 60 seconds.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Once I had the material around the windows of
the cargo doors finished, I reinstalled the windows, added sound
deadening and insulating material and put the door panels back
on.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Next it was time to do the main headliner. I
followed the instructions in the Bentley manual for removing the
headliner carefully observing how the various parts of the edge of
the headliner were installed. The only part that I didn't
disassemble was the rear part of the headliner which I had torn out
previously when I removed the air-conditioner that was installed on
the roof over then engine and welded up the holes in the roof. This
part of the installation was, fortunately, fairly
obvious.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Under the old headliner there had been some
insulation mats glued to the steel roof of the vehicle. They had
all fallen off and were sitting on top of the old headliner when I
disassembled it. I decided it would be good to install some good
insulation up there before I installed the new headliner. (The
stock insulation pads were thin and insubstantial.) I found some
insulation at the local auto supply store that was about 3/4 inch
thick mat with a layer of silver mylar (space blanket type stuff)
on one side. Two rolls of this, each about 4 feet by 6 feet, was
about right to cover the roof between the roof reinforcement rails.
I used 3M contact cement, about a half gallon of it, to cement this
insulation, mylar side facing down, into the vehicle, onto the
underside of the roof.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Before I installed the new headliner, I had to
replace the window surround material for the pop-out window behind
the cargo doors as well as for the three pop-out windows on the
driver's side of the cargo area. The most difficult part about this
was applying the large piece of headliner material that goes around
all three driver's side windows and wraps around the post behind
the driver's door. I put this large piece of material up by first
using clothes-pins to pin it up at the top hanging from the roof
ledge and then starting in the middle and gluing out toward the
edges. Once the material was glued flat to the wall of the bus I
worked on each window individually, doing the procedure outlined
above for the cargo door. (I found it very handy to have some
spring clamps and clothes-pins for this project.)</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Some time during all of the above, I recovered
the panels that go on the sides of the rear cargo area (behind the
spare tire and above the fuel filler area). The old material peeled
off the panels easily and I then sprayed the bare panels with 3M
spray adhesive and rolled new pieces of headliner material onto the
panels. Finally I cut around the edges and glued them around and to
the back of the panels. (You also need to locate the various screw
holes and poke holes for the screws, I did this by just screwing a
screw into the hole.)</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Cutting the listings. The folds in the new
headliner where the metal rods go through are called listings or
lists in an auto upholstery book I have and these must be cut near
both ends to allow the metal rods to go through. The position of
the cut affects the way the headliner is supported. Too close to
the edge and the headliner is pulled up too much near that edge.
Too far from the edge and the headliner will sag near that edge.
What I did was look carefully at where the lists had been cut on
the old headliner and cut the new ones in the same positions, this
worked out quite well although I did have to adjust the lists on
the front (short) rods a little.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Next I inserted the metal rods and hung the
headliner in the car. It turned out that it was fairly self
supporting even before I began installing the edges. The sequence I
used for installing the edges of the headliner was the
following:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">1. Install the headliner edges on both sides of
the cargo area. This involves inserting the plastic strips sewn
into the edges of the headliner into the grooves above the windows
and cargo doors and then stuffing the plastic pipeing material back
in between the top of the wall and the headliner.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">2. Attach the back end of the headliner. This
involves inserting the one medium length metal rod into its listing
and hooking the rod over the hooks along the bottom of the
rear-most roof beam and then inserting the cardboard strip into the
slot above the back cargo door and bending that slot down tight.
This took a bit of stretching and it would be better to have two
people do it but I was able to do it by myself.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">3. Install the cardboard strips along both sides
of the front of the headliner and the cardboard strips along both
sides of the fresh air vent behind the appropriate metal tabs and
bend the tabs down tight. This also involved some
stretching.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">About this time I began heating the headliner to
remove wrinkles and to allow the headliner to begin assuming its
final shape. I think a hair dryer or heat gun would be best for
this but I didn't have one so I used my white-gas-fueled Coleman
heater. It is a convection heater with a dome shaped top and I just
held it up under the headliner until the headliner got warm enough
to get soft and stretch out. This was fun and it looked like magic
as the headliner sort of "flowed" into shape. Next I did the
following:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">4. Glue the headliner into position on the sides
of the rear cargo area. This part of the headliner edge doesn't
have plastic or cardboard strips and it just glues to the metal
tabs on each side in front of the rear door hinges. Here is where
the spring clamps and clothes-pins come in very handy, I used the
"Automotive GOOP" and just clamped the material into position until
the glue dried.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">5. Glue the front of the headliner to the roof
behind where the sun visors go. There are two small panels here
that had to be removed when I removed the old headliner. I glued
the new headliner into position and then screwed these panels back
into position to hold the headliner while the glue dried. Then you
have to cover these panels with headliner material and re-install
them. (Then reinstall the sun visors.)</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">6. Glue the headliner into the back of the fresh
air vent and then reinstall the fresh air vent grill.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">7. Reinstall the rear passenger dome light. I
found it quite easy to feel where the wire and bolt holes were
through the headliner and to cut small x's over them with a razor
blade and then hook things back up.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">That was about it, I heated parts of the
headliner a little more to got it all settled down and smooth. Then
I reinstalled some of the interior panels after adding sound
deadening and insulation materials. Looks good!</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Tools used.<br>
I found that a nice new brake tool that I bought at Sears and that
doesn't even fit through the brake adjusting hole on my bus to be
great for bending out the little metal tabs when removing the
headliner and for stuffing cardboard strips and material into
various slots when installing the new headliner.<br>
Utility knife, box cutter (razor blade), scissors, for cutting
material.<br>
Contact cement, spray glue, GOOP<br>
Spring clamps, clothes-pins<br>
A rubber hammer and short piece of wood (1" x 1") for tapping metal
tabs closed.<br>
Various screwdrivers and wrenches for removing and installing
panels and hardware.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Heat source: I used a Coleman space
heater.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">With the old headliner the front half of the
headliner was made of solid vinyl with dots drawn on it to make it
look like perforated vinyl. The rear half of the old headliner was
made of real perforated vinyl. The new headliner I got from
Wolfsberg West uses perforated vinyl throughout.<br>
