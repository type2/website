<h3>Oil Filters for '72-'79 Bus and Vanagon</h3>
<p>by Ron Salmon</p>
<hr size="2">
<p><font size="+1">Vanagon oil filters by design have a different
pressure and flow characteristics than those used on Golfs,
Rabbits, etc. Most aftermarket filters use the same "generic"
design for both, and this can damage your engine, plain and simple.
According to Mahle/Germany, the original oil filter (and piston,
cylinder, etc.) supplier to VW, "When you use (a Golf oil filter)
for your car (VW Tranporter/Vanagon) you can get problems, when you
start your car. The motor is too ong without oil...and the pressure
bypass is different. Please use (the correct Vanagon-specific
filter) to get no damage to your car or motor." This is right from
the horse's mouth, so to speak. I have also seen proof of it with
my own eyes (and ears): vehicles with lifter noise or even severe
knocking on start-up, that went away immediately when the correct
filter was installed. Even if the situation is not so severe that
it causes a knock in your engine, it can certainly be harmful to
your engine in the long run.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Only two filters, to my knowledge, are
specifically designed for the Transporter/Vanagon engine, with the
correct characteristics that Mahle speaks of. One is the Mahle
(also sold under the Knecht name), the other Mann (also an O.E.
supplier to VW). Bosch is sometimes but not always comparable to
the above two brands. In some markets, they are selling a good
German filter (probably in fact made by Mahle or Mann). In others
they are simply repackaging some U.S. made filter, whose origin
cannot be confirmed. (Therefore I don't sell them, given the good
availability of actual Mahle and Mann filters which are always the
same.)</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">This means that if you want to be sure of
preventing damage to your engine, you should stick with either
Mahle/Knecht, Mann, or the VW brand sold by the VW dealer (which is
generally either a relabeled Mahle or Mann).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">These filters do not cost $9.00 as one list
member has suggested. I sell them for $3.99 to $4.29 apiece,
depending on the application. In my opinion this is a no-brainer.
It's kind of silly to even take the risk of buying a filter that
can potentially damage a $2000 engine, just so you can save perhaps
one dollar on an oil filter.</font></p>
