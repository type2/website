<h3>Quick Valve Adjust</h3>
<p>by Brian Verbeek</p>
<hr size="2">
<p><font size="+1">When i want to adjust valves i remove both valve
covers and put the crankshaft pulley on it's TDC mark, then i can
adjust the three front most valves on the one side and the rear
most valve on the other side, then i turn the crank one revolution
and adjust the rest of the valves.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">For instance, when you put the pulley on its TDC
mark, and it happens to be cyl.1 that going to fire, both valves on
cyl.#1 have play and both can be adjusted, the lobe of the inlet
valve of cyl.#2 points towards 7 o-clock if looked at from the
pulley side, away from the #2 inlet lifter, so it can be adjusted,
the cyl.#3 exhaust points towards 5 o-clock, away from the #3
exhaust lifter and can be adjusted, all these valves together
equals the three right front valves and the left rear valve, turn
the pulley one revolution and you'll get the opposite situation,
then you can adjust the #3 in. and ex., #4 in. and #2 out which
translates to the left three fronts and the right rear one. I also
use this method on T4s and Porsche 356s. It's harder to describe
than it is to actually do it.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">However, you can always check if the above
method works yourself, adjust your valves like you always do, and
then check them how i described to adjust them.</font></p>
