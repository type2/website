Maybe, maybe not, as the viscosity range indicated by the SAE numbers
is fairly wide and the numbers themselves are quite arbitrary. Read
on if you want to know more.
<P>
The way oil viscosity is measured is with a Saybolt orifice
viscometer, which is basically a cup surrounded by a water bath which
keeps the temperature of the oil sample constant. There is a plugged
opening in the bottom of the cup, which is opened when the oil is at
the proper temperature. The oil is captured in a 60ml flask and the
amount of time required to fill the flask is recorded.
<P>
A SAE30 oil takes 58-70 seconds to fill the flask at 210F,<BR>
an SAE40 oil takes 70-85 seconds, and<BR>
an SAE50 oil takes 85-110 seconds.<BR>
<P>
There is also a test for low-temperature viscosity that is designated
by a "W" suffix on the SAE viscosity rating.<BR>
A SAE5W oil takes less than 6000 seconds to fill the flask at 0F.<BR>
An SAE10W oil takes 6000-12000 seconds, and<BR>
an SAE20W takes 12000-48000 seconds.<BR>
<P>
I'd assume that the winter oil testing leaves the test engineers with
plenty of time to relax while waiting for the test to conclude! Ah,
the life of a petroleum engineer!
<P>
A "multiviscosity" oil is simply an oil that has been rated using both
tests. Nothing magic about it, except that sometimes the composition
of the oil has been tweaked to flatten the viscosity-temperature
curve.
<P>
Note that a SAE30 oil and a SAE30W oil are not the same thing, as they
are measured using different tests.
