<h3>Oil Weight</h3>
<p>by George Lyle</p>
<hr size="2">
<pre><font size="+1">
&gt; Does 2 quarts of 30w + 2 quarts of 50w (same brand) = 4
&gt; quarts of 40w? Oil Weight
</font></pre>
<p><font size="+1">Maybe, maybe not, as the viscosity range
indicated by the SAE numbers is fairly wide and the numbers
themselves are quite arbitrary. Read on if you want to know
more.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The way oil viscosity is measured is with a
Saybolt orifice viscometer, which is basically a cup surrounded by
a water bath which keeps the temperature of the oil sample
constant. There is a plugged opening in the bottom of the cup,
which is opened when the oil is at the proper temperature. The oil
is captured in a 60ml flask and the amount of time required to fill
the flask is recorded.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">A SAE30 oil takes 58-70 seconds to fill the
flask at 210F,<br>
an SAE40 oil takes 70-85 seconds, and<br>
an SAE50 oil takes 85-110 seconds.<br></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">There is also a test for low-temperature
viscosity that is designated by a "W" suffix on the SAE viscosity
rating.<br>
A SAE5W oil takes less than 6000 seconds to fill the flask at
0F.<br>
An SAE10W oil takes 6000-12000 seconds, and<br>
an SAE20W takes 12000-48000 seconds.<br></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I'd assume that the winter oil testing leaves
the test engineers with plenty of time to relax while waiting for
the test to conclude! Ah, the life of a petroleum
engineer!</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">A "multiviscosity" oil is simply an oil that has
been rated using both tests. Nothing magic about it, except that
sometimes the composition of the oil has been tweaked to flatten
the viscosity-temperature curve.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Note that a SAE30 oil and a SAE30W oil are not
the same thing, as they are measured using different
tests.<br></font></p>
