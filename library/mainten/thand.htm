<h3>Valve Adjustment Tools</h3>

<p><font size="+1">I've found a big help in adjusting valves is to
get a screwdriver with a cross-handle on it. This exact tool
happens to be the chain adjusting tool that came with my Stihl 020
chainsaw. I'm quite certain that anyone can purchase such a tool at
your friendly Stihl chainsaw dealer for about $6.00 US. It's just a
medium blade screwdriver with a combo sparkplug socket-13mm. socket
welded across the end to form the handle. Using the cross-handle
allows a little more leverage and much more control of small
movements of the screwdriver blade. (Those screws tend to be a bit
sticky.) It's also a handy 13mm. socket wrench. It's made in
Germany, so it should feel some extra kinship while lying under
your seat with the lug wrench.(For those of you who feel that
wrench karma is important.)</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">If this helps an old salt such as myself, I'm
certain it should make the job easier for a novice.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">The Stihl chainsaw tool sure beats the price of
the similarly designed Schley brand tool for valve adjustment (that
sells for US$60!). Thanks Al.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Speaking of handy valve adjustment tools, some
folks like to use the tapered "go/no go" feeler gauges for valve
adjustment. Once you develop the proper feel for using this tool it
can make checking adjustment quicker. It is often difficult though
to find individual replacement blades for these (the blades around
.006" mysteriously seem to wear out quicker for VW owners :).
Strangely, companies that sell life time warranty specialty tools
like KD or Cal-Van prefer to replace an entire feeler gauge set for
free if one blade is worn/broken--but won't stock individual
tapered replacement blades!</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Feeler gauges come in tapered and non-tapered
varieties, and in varying lengths and pre-bent for specific
applications. Porsche aftermarket companies sell a replica of the
Porsche feeler gauge tool that is very convenient to use for VW
valve adjustment because of its comfortable handle and short blade
which sits at an appropriate angle. It gives the user more control,
especially in tight areas.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">There are two varieties. One has a short steel
handle with a curl on the end to fit comfortably against the finger
and a feeler blade tip screwed to the other end at 90 degrees. The
other type is also a steel piece but has a short feeler blade
attached at an angle on either end (typically a .004" or .006"
blade for Porsche applications). A worn blade is replaced by
removing two small screws that hold the blade securely between the
tool handle and a tapped backing plate. If you can't find tapered
blades sold separately, you can cut the appropriate one out of your
feeler set and drill it so that it will screw to the Porsche
tool.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">In fact, you can make the whole tool yourself
with a stiff piece of 1/2" steel about 5" long. Bend the steel
about 1/2" up from the end at roughly a 90 degree angle. Drill two
holes near the end of the angled part, side by side, through which
the hold down screws will pass. Then drill matching holes 1" up
from the end of a feeler blade. Drill and tap a small steel backing
plate to match the screw threads and sandwich the 1" bit of feeler
between the handle and the plate and screw it down. Now you have a
homemade "Porsche" tool that's a pleasure to use.<br></font></p>
