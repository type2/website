<h3>Dead Battery Jumping by Ray Cellar</h3>
<hr size="2">
<p><font size="+1">I've been in the battery 'biz' for 15 years or
so, and jumping a dead battery is no big deal if you take your time
and think before 'jumping' - so to speak...</font></p>
<ol>
<li><font size="+1">Identify the POSITIVE (red) end of one of the
jumper cable clamps - attach it to the POSITIVE (+) terminal of the
dead battery.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Attach the other POSITIVE cable clamp on the
other end of the jumper cable to the good battery's POSITIVE post
or terminal.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Attach the NEGATIVE (black) jumper cable clamp
nearest the good battery to the good battery's NEGATIVE (-) post or
terminal.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">Attach the remaining NEGATIVE jumper cable
clamp to a good engine ground point on the dead battery's vehicle
away from the dead battery - I always 'test' this last connection
by barely touching the clamp to the engine to see if it 'sparks' to
any great degree - which it might if the dead battery is really
dead.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font size="+1">Some words of caution here...batteries generate
hydrogen while charging AND cranking...if you have been cranking
heavily (bad for the starter) on your regular battery and have run
it down, you have been generating lots of hydrogen gas inside the
battery and hydrogen being lighter than air, migrates out through
the battery's vents and will explode if a small spark is in the
area...loose battery terminals are the usual problem when a battery
explodes, but a spark from the jumper cables can do the same
thing...ALWAYS wear some kind of eye protection when jumping
batteries - it's not the battery acid that will hurt you (I have
splashed it in my eyes several times and it washes right out with
fresh water without permanent damage) it's the 'shrapnel' from the
exploding battery case that does the real damage, and without
glasses you are a prime target for same!!!!</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">You don't have to remove the dead batteries
cable connections to attach a battery charger, assuming it's a
charger of the same voltage. I don't recommend using a large
charger's booster setting on a regular car battery, it's best to
let the dead battery charge at a lower, normal (10-20 amps) setting
for 15 minutes or so and then try to start. As a rule of 'thumb'
you should never exceed 20% of a batteries amp hour capacity when
recharging...most smaller car batteries are in the 40-65 amp hour
range, which would call for no more than a 10 amp battery charger
(my recommendation as the best, all-round type charger for
overnight use). If you use a small 2 amp charger on a dead battery
- expect a long wait before it will be charged up again...if you
have 50 amp hour battery that's stone dead, you have to 'pump'
those 50 amp hours back into the lead plates, therefore your 2 amp
charger would theoretically take 25 hours (50/2). The last 20% of a
battery charge can take as long as the first 80% to complete, so I
always us a factor of at least 150% when trying to anticipate when
a dead battery will be fully charged, and in this case it could
take about 38 hours with that 2 amp charger!...Using a 10 amp
charger would complete the same task in about 7.5 hours
(50/10x1.5).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">One last word of caution while using battery
chargers....ALWAYS hook the charger leads to the battery BEFORE you
plug the charger into the AC house current - with the charger
unplugged, there is little chance of a spark if you hood the leads
to the proper polarity...</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Then, ALWAYS unplug the charger from the AC wall
socket BEFORE you remove the leads from the charged battery - again
you want to avoid a spark while removing the leads - and please,
wear those protective eye glasses when using that battery
charger!</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">If all the above fails, park your loaf on a big
hill so you can get up some speed before jamming it in gear to bump
start...you guys with the auto trannys need a really BIG
hill!!!</font></p>
