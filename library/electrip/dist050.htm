<h3>050 Distributor</h3>
<p>by Will Wood</p>
<hr size="2">
<p><font size="+1">An 050 is a Stock Distributor, it's counterpart
the 250 is for Type IV engines. Both share the same
characteristics: Timed ATDC instead of BTDC, Nearly 40 Degrees of
total advance (Vacuum + Mechanical). Two vacuum ports (one for
advance, one for retarding the advance). The 009 is straight
mechanical with approx 22 degrees of advance and is timed
BTDC.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The Confusion about the 050 as being high
performance comes from part numbering scheme, many original 050
Styles were the 015, 117 and 215 (If memory serves correctly). The
050 and the 250 are replacements for these.<br></font></p>
