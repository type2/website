this problem and I will assume that you have a Type-I. If you have
a Type-II, III or IV, there will be some variations but that is
mostly where the location of the voltage regulator is mounted. For
the most part, the information provided should be the same for all
Type's. I recommend that you get a decent repair manual to aid you
(Clymer, Chilton, Robert Bentley, Haynes and I guess Muir's Idiot's

<font size="+1">Don't panic, pull over to a safe place and turn the
engine off. Most people assume that the generator (or alternator if
you have one) is at fault. This is not always the case.</font>

that can cause your generator light to come on.</font></p>

<tr>
<td><font size="+1">For the most part, you will probably be using
your volt meter.</font>
<h1><font size="+1">Fan belt tension/defelction.</font></h1>
<p><font size="+1">Make sure that there's about a half inch of
play/deflection.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">If there's more than that, see if you can
tighten the belt. Do this by removing one (or more) shims that's
between the two pulley halves.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">If after removing <b>all</b> the shims and
there's still too much play in the belt, then the belt is stretched
and needs to be replaced.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">If the belt is OK, then check the
generator/alternator mounting bolts are tight. If they are nice and
tight, then we can rule out a bad/loose belt and
generator/alternator.</font></p>
<h1><font size="+1">Wire harness and connectors.</font></h1>
<p><font size="+1">Check the generator/alternator wiring harness
and the connectors at the regulator.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Depending on the year of your VW, the regulator
can be found under the rear seat (left side) or be mounted right on
top the generator. If you have an alternator, then regulators are
usually built in to the alternator itself.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Typically, on a 6V car (1966 and older) it's
mounted on top the generator (a silver box). On a 12V car (1967 and
on) it's usually under the rear seat off to the left. In Ghia's, I
think the regulator is in the engine compartment and I believe
that's the same with the Bus.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Anyway, check and make sure that the wires are
on good and tight and not burned or damaged. Replace any
wire.connector that looks bad.</font></p>
<h1><font size="+1">Battery.</font></h1>
<p><font size="+1">Disconnect the battery cables, negative cable
first then the positive. Inspect the battery posts, for a few
bucks, you can buy a battery post cleaner or use a wire brush and
clean the posts and the battery clamps. For about $1.00 (USA), you
can buy these little felt rings that you place over each battery
posts which helps keep them nice and clean. There's also a gooey
gell that you can put on the posts once the cables are re-attached
to help them from corrison build up.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">If you suspect that the battery has a bad cell
or two, you can buy a hydrometer from any FLAPS. This simple device
checks the specific gravity of the battery electrolyte in each
cell.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">A bad cell can cause the generator/alternator to
overcharge the other cells which will trigger the generator light
in the speedo.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">With the key in the <b>OFF</b> position (remove
it from the ignition to be safe!) and the negative cable removed
from the battery (keeping the positive cable still attached)
connect a test light between the negative battery post and the
disconnected negative battery cable.</font></p>
<ul>
<li><font size="+1">If the light does not come on, then reattach
the negative battery cable and move on to checking the voltage
output check.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">If the test light comes on, there's a short in
the electrical system. You must first find out where that
short/drain is coming from before we can check out charging
system.</font>
<p><font size="+1">A suggestion that might help you track this down
would be to disconnect the generator/alternator harness, if the
light goes out then the generator/alternator is bad, if the light
stays on then move to the fuse block and start removing fuses one
at a time until the lamp goes out. This will at least help you
figure out which components might be causing the
short/drain.</font></p>
</li>
</ul>
<font size="+1">Get out your digital volt meter (DVM) and check the
battery voltage. A healthy 6V battery should show about +6.3VDC. A
healthy 12V battery should show about +12.6VDC.</font>
<p><font size="+1">Start the engine and run it at fast idle (about
2000 RPM) and check the battery voltage again. On a 6V battery, you
should be getting around +7.4VDC to +8.1VDC, on a 12V battery, you
should be getting around +13.5VDC to +14.5VDC.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Flip your head lights on, the voltage should
drop a bit then come back up again if the charging circuit it
working properly.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">If the voltages are more than what's specified,
then the regulator is probably shot and needs to be
replaced.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">If the voltages are less than specified, then
the problem lies in the generator/alternator.</font></p>

<h1><font size="+1">Generator</font></h1>

<p><font size="+1">Inspect the brushes first.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">On generators, you can can try a simple trick;
remove the brush (use a magnatized flat bladed screw driver, it
will make it easier when you go to re-install the brush), the
copper wire that is attached to one end is usually long enough for
you to rotate the brush 180 degrees. If it is, re-install it (do
this for the other brush too) and re-check the voltage outputs (the
generator light may take several seconds before it goes out). If
the generator light goes out and the voltages are within spec, then
you have a set of worn brushes ... replace them.</font></p>

</p>
<p><font size="+1">If after doing this brush trick doesn't fix the
problem, then you probably have a bad generator.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Remember that when replacing the generator, it's
a good idea to replace the regulator too. A generator that's gone
wonky can damage or weaken the regulator which may come back to
haunt you later down the road.</font></p>

<h1><font size="+1">Alternator</font></h1>
</center>
<p><font size="+1">In the alternator, you can't do this trick as
the brushes are built into the internal regulator and they both get
replaced as a single unit.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">If after replacing the internal
regulator/brushes in the alternator does not fix the problem, then
the alternator is probably bad and needs replacing. Hang on to the
new regulator/brushes and keep them as a spare (most places will
not let you return electical parts, if they do, cool
deal!).</font></p>

<h1><font size="+1">Conclusion.</font></h1>
<p><font size="+1">Well, that's about the basics in what can cause
your generator light to glow (aside from there being a short in the
generator light itself).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">It's also beyond the scope of this page to pin
point the exact problem, but what I have outlined here is something
that the basic "Do it yourself" type person can do. It is my hope
that this the information that I have provided will help/aid in
your troubleshooting.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Keep in mind that if you are running a
generator, the generator light will glow dimly and is most
noticable when it's dark (ie: at night). This is common. Ever
notice when sitting at idle and you have your headlight on how
*dim* the lights are at times, then when you rev the engine up over
1000 RPM they glow brighter? This is normal for a generator
supplied car. Try running the lights and the wiper motor on at the
same time in a 6V car. (c=</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">And last but not least, don't be ashamed if you
have to enlist the help of a shoppe. It's best to have it done
right. Electrical troubleshooting is time consuming and fustrating
(even in a simple car like the VW), if not done properly, you can
not only toast the wiring/electical system, but you can toast your
VW!</font></p>
