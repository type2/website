<h3>Auxiliary Battery Isolater/Starter Solenoid</h3>
<p>by David Schwarze and Jim Arnott</p>

<blockquote><font size="+1"><i>"There has been much discussion
regarding the fitting of a battery isolator for running dual
batteries. It really can be quite simple.</i></font>
<p><font size="+1"><i>1. Get yourself to the local auto parts store
and purchase a continuous duty starter solenoid P/N ST-80 (list
price $46.85.)"</i></font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">David Schwarze responds:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Or go to Camping World and get a similar device
for about $15. Continuous duty, looks like a starter solenoid -
cylindrical with two mounting tabs, two large connectors, one small
one, silver in color. Camping World has a catalog, and presumably
an 800 number so you could mail order this part.</font></p>
<blockquote><font size="+1"><i>"2. Install same on firewall using
SHORT sheet metal screws. (3/8-1/2") Drill carefully, the gas tank
is back there. You REALLY don't want to punch a hole in it. (Note:
wrap a mess of duct tape around the drill bit about 1/2" from the
point to make a stop.)</i></font>
<p><font size="+1"><i>3. Run a 10 gauge wire from the large
terminal on the left side of the solenoid to the positive terminal
of the aux. battery. (Use crimp on terminals on both ends of the
wire. You can't get away with just wrapping the wire around the
terminals...)"</i></font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">I used 2 gauge wire with soldered copper lugs -
overkill perhaps but it makes me feel like a man,
dammit!</font></p>
<blockquote><font size="+1"><i>"4. Run another 10 ga. wire from the
large terminal on the right side of the solenoid to the large
terminal on the starter solenoid. (There are other places to pick
up the charging circuit, but this is the simplest for the novice
electrician.) Make sure that the wire is grommeted where it passes
through the sheet metal. Running it with the vehicle battery
positive cable will work okay." 5. Okay, you've gotten this far,
now it's time to tell the solenoid when to close. There are a
couple of schools of thought on this, such as picking up the idiot
light circuit so the solenoid will only operate when the alternator
is charging, but I believe in the KISS principle... So... run a 14
ga. wire from the small terminal on the left side of the solenoid
to the 12 v. side of the coil. That's the side that doesn't have
the wire going to the distributor."</i></font></blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">That works great - I went a bit farther and
wired it to the ignition "on" AND another switch so I could
interrupt the continuity if needed, but I usually just leave that
switch on. The one difference between the ignition "on" position
and the coil is that the former is off while the starter is
cranking, which is a good thing.</font></p>
<blockquote><font size="+1"><i>"6. Run another piece of 14 ga. wire
from the small terminal on the right side of the solenoid to
ground. I use one of the attaching screws.</i></font>
<p><font size="+1"><i>Viola!!! Aux. battery will now be in the
charging circuit whenever the ignition is on.</i></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><i>There has been some concern expressed about
the aux. battery "sucking the charge" out of the vehicle battery.
Believe me, it ain't gonna happen through a 10 ga. wire in less
that about an hour. Not without turnin' that puppy into a
fuse."</i></font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">I would go so far as to say that it will never
happen. Even when my two golf cart batteries are dead, they do not
drain my little 450CCA starting battery when they are connected
through the 2 gauge. They pull some decent amperage for the first
few seconds, but the starting battery still has plenty left and the
alternator makes everything all right in a few minutes. If you're
worried about it, wire the solenoid to the ignition switch instead
of the coil as described above. Or put in the second switch and
leave it off until the engine is running.</font></p>
<blockquote><font size="+1"><i>"That's it. As I've noted, there are
variations on this theme, but this has worked for me on VWs, Fords
(motorhome), GMCs (winch) etc."</i></font></blockquote>
