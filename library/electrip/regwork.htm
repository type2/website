<h3>Alternator Light and Voltage Regulator Operation</h3>
<p>by William Warburton</p>

<blockquote><font size="+1"><i>I was wondering if someone can
explain to me how a voltage regulator
works.</i></font></blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">A quick summary: The alternator's generating
coils are wired to the charging system via diodes to convert AC to
DC. These coils are "fixed" (unlike a generator, which uses brushes
to tranfer large currents to the car), and this accounts for the
alternator's improved capacity. Output current is generated by
passing a field current through coils in the rotating part of the
alternator. The field current is controlled by the regulator and is
relatively small (a few amps), so the brushes that carry it last
longer.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The regulator senses the output voltage and
cycles the currrent through the field coil by switching it rapidly,
if the average current is high, we get high output, low for low
output. Electronic (solid state) regulators have no moving parts
and can switch faster and are therefore more accurate and more
reliable.</font></p>
<blockquote><font size="+1"><i>Another thing I don't understand is
when terminal D+ is live and when it is not, or asked differently,
how can the alt light on the dash be off while the aux. fan relay
(or the aux. battery charging relay for that matter) are powered:
all three being connected to D+.</i></font></blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">The alt-light is effectively connected *between*
battery (+) and alternator output, so it indicates when either side
is low, though not both(!). Hence it's on when the ignition is on
but before the engine is started and also if the engine is running
but the battery getting low or the alternator isn't producing
output. It actually performs an important job in providing the
initial excitation current to the alternator's field
windings.</font></p>
