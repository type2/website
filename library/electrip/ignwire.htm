<h3>Ignition Switch Wiring</h3>

<p><font size="+1">Below is the ignition switch wiring chart from
MY '71 Westy. The switch is a replacement from RMMW, but the wires
all matched colors with the exceptions noted below. I can't swear
that the PO didn't change any wiring, but it all LOOKS original,
with the possible exception of maybe the black wire going to the
light switch. BUT, it DOES all work, including the coil getting 12V
in the start position. :-)</font></p>

   WIRE                  FROM/TO                         DESCRIPTION
--------             ----------------               -------------------

Red/Black            from switch to starter         12V when in "START" position
Black                from switch to fuse box and
                     ignition coil                  12V when in "ON" and
                                                    "START" position
Black/Yellow(1)      from switch to light switch    12V only in "ON" (not
                                                    "ON" & "START")?
Red                  from battery to switch         12V at all times (straight
                                                    from battery)
Brown/Blue(2)        door buzzer                    connected to GND when key
                                                    is in ignition
Blue/gray            not used
</font></pre>
<font size="+1">1. Connecting wire is Black, not Red/Black as shown
in book. 2. This wire is shown as Brown in book. Also, the
connecting wire is White/Black, not Brown as shown in book.</font>

<p><font size="+1"><b>Note from Jim Thompson at a later date
regarding the wiring of a '69 bus replacement ignition
switch:</b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Jim Thompson writes:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">This Grey wire is an "accessory" wire used on
models that never made it to the US. In fact, it's not widely
known, but the replacement switch has an "accessory" position,
which due to the design of the USA/Canadian market steering locks
is not accessible for some stupid reason I've never been able to
fathom.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The original switches had 3 positions, Off, On
and Start. The Replacement Switch has 4 Positions (clockwise
starting from the left), Accessory, Off, On and Start.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">It's important that before installing this
switch to take a screwdriver and check the correct position of the
movable slot of the switch. Check to see if has 4 positions. If so,
be sure that it's in the second position (Off) before attaching it
to the steering lock. If it's a 3 position switch, make sure it's
in the first position (Off).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I usually tell people to loop the wire under the
dash and tape the end up so it doesn't contact anything to short
out. For people with Stereos and Amplifier combinations, it makes a
great sensing wire to tell the amplifier to turn on, but I usually
wire my music to play on a "hot all da time" circuit.</font></p>
