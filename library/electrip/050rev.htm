<h3>"050" Distributor Reviewed</h3>
<p>by Andy McKinley</p>
<hr size="2">
<p><font size="+1">I have been using this "050" distributor for the
past four+ years. It is Bosch part number 230 081 050. It ends with
"050", just like the "009" distributors end with 009, and the
"010's" end with 010.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">No, this is not a stock distributor for any VW.
Most Bosch books don't even list it. Most VW specific vendors don't
have a clue, and can't provide tune-up parts for it (the ones that
are familiar with the "050" don't seem to have any problem at all,
tho).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">This is strictly a mechanical advance
distributor. [Editor's Note: there are "050" suffix vacuum canister
distributers--Andy discusses the typcial mechanical version
here]</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Its advance characteristics are similar to the
Brazilian manufactured "009" (there are some that were made in
Germany as well, and they say "Germany" on the bottom of the can,
and have different advance characteristics, too). The "050" has a
smoother advance curve (flatter line on a graph of rpm/degrees
advance). The advance kicks in at around a hundred RPM lower than
the "009," making it more suitable for use in a van. The "050" also
advances to a greater degree, around 26 degrees at ~3100 rpm, while
the "009" poops out at ~2650 RPM with a total advance of about 21
degrees. These numbers are approximate, and will vary between
distributors and reference literature.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Part number I have (stamped on the part)
are:<br>
Cap-231 081 413<br>
rotor-231 081 628<br>
points-01 011 (I'm running Pertronics point eliminators, which
required slight modification due to interference with the
rotor).<br></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Driving Characteristics:<br></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I find the "050" is more driveable than the
"009" Brazilian unit that I keep as a backup. Neither is as
driveable as the vacuum unit, but since I'm running dual Dellortos
I can't drop in the stock vacuum unit for a direct comparison. It
is possible that the Dellortos may be coloring the difference
between apparent driveability, but I doubt it, since they're only
36mms. Power is WAY up over the stock components. My otherwise
stock 1800 can whup any stock four cylinder Jeep (and probably most
other four cylinder cars/vans/suv's in the same weight range) on
acceleration (standing or high gear) and grade climbing.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">BTW, I paid ~$80 bucks for my rebuilt "050."
Kinda haigh, in retrospect, but they musta done i right. Still no
signs of play.</font></p>
