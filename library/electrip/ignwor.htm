<h3>How the Ignition System Works</h3>
<p>by Malcolm Holser</p>
<hr size="2">
<p><font size="+1">The way the ignition works is this: You connect
a coil to some electricity, and it builds up a magnetic field. You
stop feeding the electricity, and the field collapses, inducing
flow. The voltage, in this open circuit, builds rapidly toward
infinity and eventually it must go somewhere, and arcs across
whatever is handy.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Relays do this, and generate a back-spike when
they are disengaged, arcing across the contacts of the controlling
switch. Often, a "diode clamp" will be placed across the relay coil
to prevent this. (always in electronics that cannot tolerate
voltage spikes).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The ignition coil is really two coils
intertwined, with the leads to one going to the spark plug, and the
leads to the other going to the points. Your points close, and a
magnetic field builds up. They must stay closed long enough (they
DWELL closed for a bit!) to energize the field. They open, and the
field collapses. The inductance of the collaspsing field does not
care which of the two intermingled coils created it -- it dumps
into both, but because of the way they are wound, it mostly dumps
into the spark-plug side. Enough gets into the points-side, though,
that there will be a spark across them as well. The condensor is
there to absorb this. Without a condensor, your ignition will work
fine, but your points will very rapidly pit because of the arcing,
and may weld themselves together. Alway replace the condensor with
the points -- it is more common that a poor condensor has caused
the points to fail than the points wearing on their own.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Electronic ignitions use big transistors to turn
on and off the one side of the ignition coil and internally damp
this feed-back voltage with big diodes, a far better solution, but
not one available in the 1800's when Benz invented the spark-plug.
Many newer ignitions augment the energizing current to the coil
with a Capacitance-Discharge (a capacitor is charged and then
quickly dumped to the coil). This allows the coil to charge
quickly, and the "dwell" becomes less critical. A condensor and
capacitor are the same thing, though, and this use may have led to
thinking that the capacitor in a normal system boosts the spark
voltage. It might, but the effect would be minimal.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Even though the points stay open for quite some
time, the spark only occurs the instant they open. A little basic
electrical theory:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The ignition coil is a step-up transformer.
There's a 12V coil, wound around many, many, many fine turns of
wire which are connected to the high voltage wire of the coil.
Transformers work on a *changing* magnetic field. While the points
are closed, the field is steady, so no voltage comes out of the
coil. The instant the points are opened, the field created by the
12V current collapses suddenly, producing a high voltage in the
fine windings, and a short, low-current, high voltage spark. No
matter how long the points are open (or closed) the spark only
lasts an instant. The reason the cap needs to be on right is
because you want the spark to have to jump as small a gap as
possible, so less voltage is lost crossing it.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Incidentally, the collapsing magnetic field also
induces a current in the 12V windings. This would normally arc
across the points, pitting them and shortening their life. This is
why you have a condensor, to absorb this unwanted 'inductive
kick.'</font></p>
