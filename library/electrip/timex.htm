<h3>Ignition Timing Explained/Timing an Unknown Engine</h3>
<p>by Michael Shiffer</p>
<hr size="2">
<p><font size="+1">There has been a lot of mail concerning how to
set timing with an unknown engine. I think a basic description of
timing might help sort out a lot of this. First, you should know
that there are two types of timing in an engine: cam timing and
ignition timing. (Three types, if you count injector pulse, but
injection timing on gasoline-powered busses is tied to ignition
timing and is not separately adjustable so I will ignore it, as
should you.) Cam timing is what determines when the valves open and
close with respect to the position of the pistons in their bores.
It is set when the engine is built- by placing the camshaft and
crankshaft in the correct relationship. It cannot be adjusted on a
stock engine. It doesn�t change: if it was right once it will be
right for the life of the engine, barring disaster. And by disaster
I mean the park-it-where-stops-rolling kind of disaster. (This is a
very rare occurrence in VW air-cooled engines. Not so rare in the
Rabbit/Golf ones, which drive the cam with a rubber belt which
strips if you don�t change it on schedule.) In sum: cam timing is
not connected with or affected by turning the distributor. What
distributors time is spark, or ignition. Why?</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">At idle, your engine is turning relatively
slowly, let�s say 1000 rpms. The throttle is closed, so very little
fuel and air are being drawn in to the cylinders. This small amount
of combustible mixture burns very quickly, so for maximum
efficiency, the spark needs to start when the piston is very near
top dead center. If the spark comes too early (too advanced), the
pressure from the ignited mixture will hit the piston while it is
still coming up the cylinder and be wasted trying to shove the
piston down before it reaches the end of it�s travel. If you try to
start an engine whose ignition timing is too advanced, the starter
will try to turn the crank one way, and the combustion process will
try to turn it the other way, and it will seem as if the starter
hasn�t enough oomph to start it. Contrariwise, if the timing is set
too late (too retarded), the pressure from the ignited mixture (and
the power derived therefrom) will dissipate as the flame front
chases the piston down the cylinder bore in the rapidly diminishing
pressure of the combustion chamber. In other words, the piston is
already on it�s way towards the bottom of it�s stroke, reducing the
effectiveness of combustion. The is very fuel inefficient, since a
larger throttle opening at idle (set by the idle speed screw) is
needed allow extra fuel in to keep the engine idling. In practical
terms, the position of the distributor which yields the highest
idle speed is within a very few degrees of where it should be set.
(If you retard the timing about 5 degrees from this point, you will
be awfully close to spot-on.) Of course, this assumes your
carburetor (or F.I.)is working well and that the idle mixture is
correct.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">When driving on the highway, your engine�s
timing requirement is different. At higher engine speeds, larger
throttle openings and greater loads than idle, you need ignition
advance. There are two reasons for this. First, you are burning
more fuel so complete combustion takes longer. Second, the
combustion time, as a percentage of the time the piston is at or
near top dead center is much longer because of the piston speed.
What this means is that you have to ignite the charge earlier,
while the piston is still coming up, in order to get the full
benefit of the pressure against the piston at the right time. Too
early or too late timing will have a similar effect at speed as at
idle, but greatly magnified and with far more destructive
potential. Too retarded timing will give low power, lousy emissions
and excessive bore wear. Timing too advanced will cause pinging (a
rattling noise usually heard on acceleration), overheating cylinder
heads and other problems too scary to contemplate.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I will now pretend that vacuum advance doesn�t
exist. It will only confuse things.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Distributors have little weights inside that
swing away from the shaft as it turns faster. As they move out,
they rotate the upper part of the shaft which passes through the
plate that the points are bolted to so that the rubbing block which
opens the points meets the lobes which hit it (and thus open the
points) a little earlier. At what engine speed this advance begins,
at what rate it advances and at what engine speed it stops
advancing is determined by the shape and mass of the advance
weights and the strength of their return springs; at what degree of
advance it stops is determined by a limiter on the plate to which
the weights are bolted . None of this is meant to be adjusted: the
manufacturer sets it up for each engine family it builds, based on
compression, cam profile, octane requirements and availability,
among other things. Timing the ignition, then, is a matter of
getting the timing correct at one end (idle or full advance) and
letting the rest of the range look after itself.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">If you have a stock distributor and know either
the timing at idle or the maximum advance at a given engine speed
and you have a good timing light, you will have no trouble setting
timing. If not, here are some ways to get in the ball park. I
already mentioned that the highest idle speed is very slightly
advanced from correct. If you set it there and hear no pinging on
acceleration and get good power (ha-ha), you are good. If it pings,
retard it little by little until the pinging goes away. If it seems
weak, advance the timing a little at a time until you hear pinging
or find the engine hard to start, then retard it
again.<br></font></p>
