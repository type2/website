<h3>Generator to Alternator Swap</h3>

<hr size="2">
<p><font size="+1">Assuming a 68-71 bus with a 1600cc engine going
from a generator to the typical BOSCH AL82X Alternator that's been
coming with the alternator kits for the past several
years:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">First of all - DISCONNECT THE BATTERY GROUND
STRAP.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Your regulator is mounted on the right-side
firewall and yes, there's several wires going to and from your old
generator, but there's really only two on the regulator that are
important for correct hookup to the alternator.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Terminal B+ on the old Voltage Regulator -
that's the heavy 10 gauge RED wire coming usually directly from the
Battery. Usually has a Push-on Female terminal that is generally
useless with Alternators, as they have a stud protruding on the top
right side (as the Alt is mounted in the engine) that acts as the
B+ terminal. So, change the Push-on to a Ring terminal on this wire
and mount it on that stud. (Note: if you have more than one wire
going to B+ on the old Regulator, put them ALL on this stud). Use a
little vaseline to prevent corrosion on the connections as
well.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Terminal 61 on the old Voltage Regulator -
usually a small BLUE wire, this is for your Dash Generator Warning
Light. On top of the Alternator is a small Male Push-on terminal
the SAME size as the Female terminal of your harness. Might even
have the number 61 right next to the terminal, I can't remember.
Connect that wire to that male terminal. The rest of the wires and
the regulator can now be removed and properly recycled or disposed
of.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Note: Some Alternators, Motorola in particular
had an additiona real teeny-weeny Male Push-on terminal. Don't hook
anything up to this terminal (this was for the diagnosis harness on
the 75-79 Beetles/Convertibles). Motorola Alternators haven't been
available new for quite some time, so the chances of you getting
one with the kit are very slim. Motorola's can be identified by the
small white plastic Voltage Regulator/Rectifier Assembly mounted
directly on the top of the Alternator. (Ha! - try finding that
regulator nowadays, Motorola hasn't made these in almost 9 years -
I think I still have one in my stash somewhere's)</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">If there is a grounding screw on the alternator
case (some do), run a wire from that to a good ground. If possible,
stay within the color code and use BROWN, 16 gauge wire's
fine.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Note to 69-71 Bus owners originally equipped
with the 38amp GR17X Generator - This generator uses the infamous
and very expensive cast-iron backed pulley which is NOT useable
with the Alternator Conversion. This is because this particular
Generator is a little longer than it's 30amp GR15X cousin and
required this bastard pulley to "step" the belt properly back in
line with the crankshaft pulley. If you try to use this pulley on
the Alternator, you'll pay hell very shortly because the belt won't
stay on, the pulley assembly will make a gawd-awful noise and
possibly come apart, damaging the Alternator Shaft and Housing and
that can ruin just about anyone's day. Hopefully a new pulley was
provided with your kit (most are not), so if this is the case, hop
on down to your FLAPS and ask for a 12 Volt Beetle Generator
Pulley. It's stamped steel on the inner and outer halves. Stay away
from the chrome ones - chroming weakens the integrity of the metal
and this piece needs all the strength it can get with the stresses
it puts up with, not to mention that your cooling (i.e. fan)
department depends heavily on it's strength. 67-68 Buses normally
came with the GR15X Generator and you can use the pulley from that
one however, because it is the same for all 12 Volt Beetles/Ghias
as well.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Trivia note: The 12 volt Generator Pulley
(stamped steel) was used on the large diameter 6 Volt Generator
(105mm OD). The 6 Volt Pulley (differently stepped) was used on the
smaller diameter (90mm) 6 Volt Generators (GR11X) back to 1959. An
even smaller pulley was used on the 36hp varieties because the
Crank Pulley was was larger than it's descendants'</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Ron Van Ness writes:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Alternator conversion kits typically come with
an alternator pedestal (the stock generator pedestal will not work
with the alternator without modification), three fan mounting tin
pieces (which are very thin compared to the original German
pieces), an alternator clamp, and a 55 watt alternator with
internal regulator (Kymco does sell a higher output alternator).
Because of the poor quality of the tin and problems some have
fitting the cheap alternator pedestal casting that are included
with the typical aftermarket kit, it is often wiser to locate the
better made German pieces from a '73-'74 bug which came stock with
an alternator. Also, to clear the alternator, a '73-'74 alternator
charged bug fuel pump is required (113 127 025G) as well as a
shorter push rod (113 127 307A) to match the pump.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">1. <u>Modifications to fuel system with
Alternator</u></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">With the installation of an alternator, the fuel
system has had to be modified as follows:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">a - Pump inclined 15 degrees to the left<br>
b - Pump push rod length: 100 mm (3.937 in.), previously: 108 mm
(4.252 in.)</font></p>

pump).</font></p>
