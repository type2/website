In reference to a "bad diode", it can happen on these alternators - most
alternators manufactured by Bosch (and some by Motorola) during this time
frame (to the present day) are built with a "diode trio" pack (actually one
a pair of diodes per pack).  If even one of these diode pairs go bad, the alternator can appear to be working just fine in your vanagon, but not delivering a full charge to the battery.  I remember when these "diode trio" alternators first came out (on mid 70's Volvos if I remember correctly) and it drove my rebuilder nuts when he first encountered them.
<p> 
If your into rebuilding your own alternators, you can get diode packs, but
only thru the dealer (lotsa $$$) or if you have a sympathetic rebuilder,
maybe from him, but no guarantees I'm sure (I didn't get any when I bought
one 8 years ago to try it myself).  In the long run, you may be better off
just getting a rebuilt alternator.
<p> 
When having an alternator tested, I usually go to a local rebuilder or an
auto electrician, not a FLAPS.  Why?  The testing machines the rebuilders
have are a little more sophisticated in that a simulated electrical load
can be applied on the alternator to determine is true condition.  Most
FLAPS that have testing machines are less sophisticated and while you can
check output and some diode conditions with these machines, they lack the
capability to place a load on the alternator and many times will be
inaccurate.  And a lot of the time the FLAPS employees have very little
clue how to operate one of these machines anyway.

The "+" terminal is a plug for the VW Diagnosis Machine.  Leave it alone,
don't connect anything to it please.
