<h3>Alternator Diode Pack</h3>
<p>by Jim Thompson</p>

<p><font size="+1">In reference to a "bad diode", it can happen on
these alternators - most alternators manufactured by Bosch (and
some by Motorola) during this time frame (to the present day) are
built with a "diode trio" pack (actually one a pair of diodes per
pack). If even one of these diode pairs go bad, the alternator can
appear to be working just fine in your vanagon, but not delivering
a full charge to the battery. I remember when these "diode trio"
alternators first came out (on mid 70's Volvos if I remember
correctly) and it drove my rebuilder nuts when he first encountered
them.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">If your into rebuilding your own alternators,
you can get diode packs, but only thru the dealer (lotsa $$$) or if
you have a sympathetic rebuilder, maybe from him, but no guarantees
I'm sure (I didn't get any when I bought one 8 years ago to try it
myself). In the long run, you may be better off just getting a
rebuilt alternator.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">When having an alternator tested, I usually go
to a local rebuilder or an auto electrician, not a FLAPS. Why? The
testing machines the rebuilders have are a little more
sophisticated in that a simulated electrical load can be applied on
the alternator to determine is true condition. Most FLAPS that have
testing machines are less sophisticated and while you can check
output and some diode conditions with these machines, they lack the
capability to place a load on the alternator and many times will be
inaccurate. And a lot of the time the FLAPS employees have very
little clue how to operate one of these machines anyway.</font></p>
