One of the most frequent of questions on the type2 list, right after,
"What kind of tires should I buy?", is, "Where is the timing mark on
my type IV engine??"
<p> 
This page attempts to provide an answer to that question.  If you
can't find it using this system, please write to

First, the timing mark is *very* small!  I tend to look less with my eyes
and more with a fingetnail.  It is located on the forward rim of the
pulley that runs around the edge of the fan at the rear of the engine.
The first step is to locate the notch in the hub of the fan.  this notch
is pictured below.

Once you have found the notch follow a line from the center of the hub,
thru the right (clockwise) edge of the notch out to the rim.  You may find
marks there.  These were put there by a PO and are *not* the timing mark,
but are a good indication that you are in the neighbothood! :-)
<p>
As I said above, I find that the easiest way to find the notch is with
my fingernail.  Turn the fan until the notch is at the 3:00 position
(pointing to the right).  then trace a line out from the hub and run your
fingernail along the forward face of the pulley.  When you find the timing
mark, *PUT A SPOT OF PAINT ON IT!!!*  A picture of the timing mark is
shown below, FYI:
