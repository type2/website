<p><font size="+1">One of the most frequent of questions on the
type2 list, right after, "What kind of tires should I buy?", is,
"Where is the timing mark on my type IV engine??"</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">This page attempts to provide an answer to that
question. If you can't find it using this system, please write to
<a href="mailto:dworkin@type2.com">me</a>.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">First, the timing mark is *very* small! I tend
to look less with my eyes and more with a fingetnail. It is located
on the forward rim of the pulley that runs around the edge of the
fan at the rear of the engine. The first step is to locate the
notch in the hub of the fan. this notch is pictured
below.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Once you have found the notch follow a line from
the center of the hub, thru the right (clockwise) edge of the notch
out to the rim. You may find marks there. These were put there by a
PO and are *not* the timing mark, but are a good indication that
you are in the neighbothood! :-)</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">As I said above, I find that the easiest way to
find the notch is with my fingernail. Turn the fan until the notch
is at the 3:00 position (pointing to the right). then trace a line
out from the hub and run your fingernail along the forward face of
the pulley. When you find the timing mark, *PUT A SPOT OF PAINT ON
IT!!!* A picture of the timing mark is shown below, FYI:</font></p>
