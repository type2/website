<h3>Distributor Vacuum Hoses - Where Do They Go?</h3>
<p>by Jim Thompson</p>
<hr size="2">
<p><font size="+1">Over the years, many a 71-74 Beetle and 71 Bus
with Dual Diaphragm Distributors have graced my doors and about
half the time the vacuum lines are backwards. So here's the
poop:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">First, take a look at your Vacuum can. On the
flat side of the can is a hose fitting - for the larger (4.5mm
GREEN) hose. This is the RETARD side.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Second, on the cone (or rounded) side of the can
is the smaller hose fitting. This uses a 3.5mm hose, usually black.
This is the ADVANCE side.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Third, look at your 34PICT Carburetor. The
fitting on the LEFT side of the carb is for the ADVANCE side of
your Vaccum can. Connect appropriately.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Fourth, look at your 34PICT Carb again. On the
rear (RIR) of the carb should be a fitting up towards, but not on
the carburetor top. This push-on fitting is just slightly larger
than then one on the side. This is for your RETARD side of your
Vacuum can. Connect appropriately with the 4.5mm Green
Hose.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Fifth, Any other fittings on your 34PICT Carb
are for the infamous Throttle Positioner sometimes improperly
called a "Decel Valve". The fitting for this jewel is an angled one
right at the rear base of the carburetor. Connect the small vacuum
hose to it to the Throttle Positioner Diaphragm Fitting. If your
Throttle Positioner has two fittings (as original on 71 Buses,
71-74 Beetles), connect another length of 3.5mm vacuum hose from
that to the Throttle Positioner Solenoid, usually located in the
left side of the engine compartment. If you don't have the Throttle
Positioner, cap off all the remaining fittings on your
carburetor.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">If you're running one of those new replacement
H30/31PICT carbs, the procedure above is the same as they come with
these fittings like their distant 34PICT cousins. Original 30PICT
Series did not have the RETARD fitting, except for Beetle Auto-Suck
Models - BUT - this fitting was for the Auto-Suck Solenoid, not the
distributor because they were still single vacuum models (Actually,
the Auto-Suck use a combined vacuum/mechanical distributor similar
to the 76-78 Buses). Buses don't have these, right? So use this
fitting for your RETARD side of the Dual Diaphragm Can.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Timing is usually 5 degrees AFTER Top Dead
Center when using a Dual Diaphragm Distributor, give or take a
degree or two - no two engine setups or running conditions are the
same, so you''' have to fool with with of course. One other thing -
Strobe Light at idle speed with the hoses CONNECTED. Sorry, no
static timing with these, except to initially set the distributor
at 0 TDC, start the engine, then strobiscopically time it after it
warms up.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">For those wanting to put a stock push-pull
distributor back on their 71 Dual Port 1600 with a 34PICT (or other
Bus with the same arrangement, here's the skinny on interchangeable
distributors. All have the same Advance/Retard Curve
specifications:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Vacuum: 2-5deg Adv @ 6.7 In. Hg, 11-13deg Ret @
9.1 In. Hg<br>
Centrifugal Advance: 6-12deg @ 1500rpm, 22-25deg
@3800rpm</font></p>
