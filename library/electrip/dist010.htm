<h3>010 Distributor</h3>
<p>by Jim Thompson</p>
<hr size="2">
<p><font size="+1">The 0231 129 010 distributor was not (repeat)
NOT equipped with a vacuum advance. Purely centrifugal (VW
211-905-205F) and was the predecessor to the 009. Advance curves
were roughly the same (010 came on about 200-300 rpm sooner) and
the other difference was the 010 had dual advance weights, the 009
had (or still has) a single advance weight.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Here's a real laugh - the 009 was still listed
the VOA Price list (126-905-205) for (hold on to your wallets!)
$246.30!!!! :-O</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">It's showing an "Obsolete" Code in the latest
price list. Gee, I wonder why? :-)<br></font></p>
