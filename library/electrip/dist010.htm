The 0231 129 010 distributor was not (repeat) NOT equipped with a vacuum



advance.  Purely centrifugal (VW 211-905-205F) and was the predecessor to



the 009.  Advance curves were roughly the same (010 came on about 200-300



rpm sooner) and the other difference was the 010 had dual advance



weights, the 009 had (or still has) a single advance weight.







<p>Here's a real laugh - the 009 was still listed the VOA Price list



(126-905-205) for (hold on to your wallets!) $246.30!!!! :-O







<p>It's showing an "Obsolete" Code in the latest price list.  Gee, I wonder



why? :-)
