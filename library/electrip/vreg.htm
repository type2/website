<h3>Voltage Regulators</h3>
<p>by Austin Jack Smith</p>
<hr size="2">
<p><font size="+1">As I understand it the voltage regulation system
on almost all auto voltage regulation devises are what are called
Constant Potential Voltage Regulation, which means the voltage
output from the DC power source is controled by the voltage
regulator by adjusting or changing the field current to the
generator field windings. This is why you are advised not to run
the generator without the regulator attached for more than a few
moments, just long enough to measure the voltage output of the
unregulated generator. Ref. the generator testing information in
both Bentley and the Haynes manuals. The DF on the voltage
regulator and generator stands for Dynamo Field, our English
friends call the generator the Dynamo or we call the Dynamo the
generator.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">As the battery voltage comes up the amount of
current being put in the battery is less, Voltage times Current (in
amps) = watts or a unit of electrical work. so basically the
generator puts out the same watts only different voltage and amps.
Some of you old timers will remember when old Fords and others
didn't have voltage regulators only reverse current relays (to keep
from motorizing the generator when the car was shut off) in order
to keep from overcharging the battery it was common to run with
your headlights "on" on long trips. If that wasn't possible you
could move the third brush in the generator and cut your voltage
output down or up.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The voltage regulator used to be adjustable, but
you had to have a very good voltmeter, a resistance load (to
simulate the current demands of the battery and the vehicle) a very
accurate ampmeter and a accurate thermometer. All of the
instruments were necessary because temp. is also a function of the
regulator. Today it would be foolish to try to adjust a regulator
unless it was an emergancy, if the generator goes bad it is very
likely that the regulator caused this, barring brush wear and othe
mechanical wear factors. If your generator packs up change the reg
as well.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">A lead acid storage battery produces a fixed
voltage per cell, (2.5 Volts) the state of charge makes very little
difference until the battery goes completely dead. The only way to
accurately measure a batteries state of charge is the specific
gravity of the electrolyte (Sulpheric Acid Water Mixture) H2S04+H20
Under normal conditions at 59 degrees F. a fully charged battery
will read 1.300 meaning their is enough free acid in the water to
raise the weight of electrolyte to 1.3 times the weight of pure
water. So a discharged battery will need quite a few amps of charge
to bring its voltage up to 2.5 volts per cell, as the cell voltage
increases the amp flow will decrease until the battery and gen
voltage are the same and then the battery is on what is called
"zero float".</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Now trying to charge two batteries in parallel
the batteries will try to equalize temselves out first ballancing
the load until they both have equal voltage, which is very hard to
obtain with two batteries of different size and age. On Submarines
where I spent 11 years of my youth as an Electrician's mate we
would do a special chargeing proceedure every 28 days called an
"equalizing charge" the batteries consist of two batteries of 126
cells each and they were charged until all 252 cells were within a
.01 volts of each other and the specific gravity corrected for
temperture, of course was within .001 of each other. I hop[e you
can see this is not a big problem but can have some consquences if
not done right.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">This is why a voltmeter is a better measurement
of your electrical system than an ampmeter. Point to remember the
physical size of a lead acis cell has no bearing on its voltage,
but it does indicate the ability to store electrical chemical
energy. A single 2.5 volt cell on a submarine holds 31 gallons of
electrolyte and weighs over a ton, but only can deliver 2.5 VDC,
but for a much longer time. The abiltiy to store electric energy is
measure in Amp Hours, it is often advertised in how much it can
give up in a certain time intervel. It takes 250-300 amps to stall
the starter on a VW. So if you want to motor your engine over for a
minute you will need about 450 Amp Hr. Battery. When a battery
starts the end of its life cycle the plates that are in a battery
gradually get covered up with a sulper compound called sulphate and
it will charge very fast and discharge just as fast. This usally
shows up in the winter when the oil is thicker and it is harder to
start the engine. The additional amp Hrs. are just not there and
the battery dies.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I have spent more time than I meant to and I'm
sorry, but just remember what has already been said in previous
discussions. You can eletrically isolate the two batteries from
each other by useing large diodes or electrical check valves, but
they use a small voltage to function so they will effect your
charging rate. You can use electrical relays to isolate your
batteries, easly found in auto stores called starter relays. What
ever you do by having a voltmeter switchable to either or both
batteries or just two voltmeters cheaper and easier to measure the
state of your batteries you can see what you need to
do.<br></font></p>
