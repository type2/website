<h3>Battery Inspection</h3>
<p>by George Lyle</p>
<hr size="2">
<blockquote><font size="+1"><i>"I feel like I'm a member of the
'battery of the month' club! I bought a new battery for my 73 Westy
in July 96 (Champion brand from Walmart). 6 months later it was
dead so I took it in and they gave me a new
one."</i></font></blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Well, you might want to figure the cost of your
time and hassle into the equation. Each "free" battery is probably
costing you far more than its value in your lost time!</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">It's unusual for batteries to die with such
regularity. Since the batteries are probably of reasonable quality
and freshness it might be a good idea to check out your electrical
system.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">With the engine off, pull off the negative cable
and put an ammeter in series from the cable to the negative
terminal of the battery. You should see 50ma or less (preferably
less!). You may see some current flow because of memory
requirements of stereos, alarm systems, etc. If the battery is run
low regularly it is in danger of shorting out its plates. Batteries
work by dissolving lead from plates into solution and then
replating the lead onto the plates. The problem is that the lead
doesn't get replated into the same place it dissolved from. This
isn't a problem when the battery stays charged, but if you run it
down the life can be shortened.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Reconnect the battery and start the bus. Measure
the voltage between the battery terminals. Rev the engine up to
cruising RPM. You should see 13V-14V at the battery. Less and the
battery won't get charged, more and the battery will be evaporated
of water by the excess current.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">If either excess drain or charging is present,
you need to pay attention to the electrics in your bus. If they
aren't, you need to get a different brand of battery!</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I tend to use Pep Boys batteries as they are
inexpensive, have given me good service, have removable caps so
that I can refill the fluid (with distilled water) if I have an
overcharging episode, and if all else fails they have a reasonable
return policy. Years ago I used Sears batteries, but the quality
and warrenty terms both became bad. I also tired of dealing with
the high pressure sales geeks who apparently were given electrical
shocks if a customer escaped without spending at least
$500!</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">If you aren't already doing it, use a good 'ol
'merican Group 24 battery in place of the Bug battery normally
supplied for the bus. It fits in the battery space fine and has a
lot more reserve capacity.</font></p>
