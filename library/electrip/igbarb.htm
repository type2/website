<h3>Ignition Switch Troubleshooting</h3>

<p><font size="+1">If you have a volt/ohm meter you can hook it up
to the positive wire going to the coil. Try this first with the
engine off, but the ignition on. Check the voltage at the battery
and then try the coil wire again and have someone turn the engine
over a couple of times. If you see a two or more drop in the
voltage, check through the wiring system until you find the area of
voltage loss.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">We ran a wire from one of the running tail
lights to the coil when a fellow had a complete failure of this set
of points in his bugï¿½s ignition switch. Kind of wierd to see him
pull up, turn off the key, then turn off the running lights to shut
down the engine. This might work for you if you have to drive your
bus and can not fix the ignition switch.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Often the ignition switch is destroyed by the
owner driving their VW around with heavy fobs and/or lots of keys
hanging down.</b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">This swinging weight does in the switch, just
like hanging a bowling ball on one side of your head as an ear ring
would mangle your neck over time. The heaver the wieght the faster
the destruction. Which is why we have seperate VW keys on their own
little rings and our house keys on another. Less wieght=less
damage.</font></p>
