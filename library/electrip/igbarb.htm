If you have a volt/ohm meter you can hook it up to the positive wire going
to the coil.  Try this first with the engine off, but the ignition on.  
Check the voltage at the battery and then try the coil wire again and 
have someone turn the engine over a couple of times.  If you see a two or 
more drop in the voltage, check through the wiring system until you find 
the area of voltage loss.  
<p>
We ran a wire from one of the running tail lights to the coil when a 
fellow had a complete failure of this set of points in his bug’s ignition switch.  
Kind of wierd to see him pull up, turn off the key, then turn off the running 
lights to shut down the engine.  This might work for you if you have to 
drive your bus and can not fix the ignition switch.

<B>Often the ignition switch is destroyed by the owner driving their VW around
with heavy fobs and/or lots of keys hanging down.</B>  
<p>
This swinging weight 
does in the switch, just like hanging a bowling ball on one side of your head 
as an ear ring would mangle your neck over time.  The heaver the wieght the 
faster the destruction.  Which is why we have seperate VW keys on their own 
little rings and our house keys on another.  Less wieght=less damage.
