<h3>Alternator Rebuild</h3>
<p>by Author Unknown</p>
<hr size="2">
<p><font size="+1">Most manuals don't tell you how to rebuild the
alternator! Please read this whole posting first to decide if this
is something you have the tools or time for...you're only going to
save about $40 per alternator. Also, I should define the 2 main
parts of the alternator: The rotor is the "go-roundy" and the
stator is the "standy-stilly".)</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">1. First, you need something to get the pulley
nut off. I use my half inch impact wrench....ZZZZZZZing! Off pops
the nut! The next easiest way is to loosen it in the bus...with the
belt on and a rag lodged in the pulley (don't use a screw driver
and mess up the pulley). There is some sort of wrench to hold the
pulley, but I have never owned one.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">2. Next, you need a bearing puller. I got the
cheap JC Whitless set with all the pieces. On alternators, it works
great! It has tapered plates (with cutouts) that clamp around the
bearing and then the puller part threads into these. I first use
this plate to get the pulley off. Slip the plate behind the pulley
and locate the puller thrust screw on the end of the shaft (use the
flat end insert to avoid damaging the end of the shaft). DO NOT
HAMMER OFF THE PULLEY BY HITTING THE END OF THE SHAFT.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">3. Next the long clamp screws and nuts have to
come off...the three long jobs you see on the outside of the
stator. I use a hand impact screwdriver I still have from my
motorcycle days. You whack this thing with a hammer and the end
turns! Make sure you take off the nuts on the back side, as well as
the tin cover and the electrical connections underneath before you
unscrew these.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">4. With the clamp screws out, you can separate
the front housing (pulley end) from the stator. I use a piece of
wood to tap on the mounting supports until the rotor and housing
come off of the stator as one unit. Now you use the puller to get
the housing (with bearing) off the front of the rotor. Rig the
puller backing plate behind the housing and pull it off the rotor
just like you did with the pulley in step 2. Unscrew the bearing
retainer inside the housing and take the bearing out. Use the
puller to take the other bearing off the end with the collector
(the collector is the double copper ring job on the opposite pulley
end). BE CAREFUL NOT TO DAMAGE THE COLLECTOR. A scratched and
nicked collector is our enemy.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">5. Hang in there. The hard part is over....well
almost. There is a brush holder in the back of the stator housing.
It's usually white thermoset plastic. It has a couple screws
holding it in and a spade terminal connecting it to the rectifier
(diode) plate. You have to take off the rectifier plate to get it
out. Once it is out, put it in a bag with the used bearings and go
to your local electrical automotive place (LEAP...you guys use
FLAPS, I use LEAPs). Show all the stuff to the guy behind the
counter. Make frequent references to how you did it all yourself.
Smile proudly. He'll probably sell you the brushes for $2 and the
bearings for $3 each. (Don't feel bad, he probably paid pennies for
the brushes and under a buck for the bearings!) BTW, these parts
are all common to many different cars (the bearings are probably
the same on a chevy!)</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">6. Desolder the old brushes and resolder the new
ones. Do them one at a time to duplicate exactly how they are
located. Be careful not to wick the solder too far up the brush
leads. When you are done, you will need to push the brush up
through the holder until the end of the spiral spring is against
the side of the brush. This holds the brushes in a lifted position
for assembly (this is really a neat design!). It actually is easier
if you do this trick before you solder the leads.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">7. Put everything back together...you did draw a
diagram of where the washers, wires, and screws went, right? You
can sand the collector with 400 grit paper and clean with contact
cleaner (before you put the bearings on), if you want. If it looks
clean, I let it go. If it's deeply rutted, the LEAP can turn it
(about 8 bucks). For that matter, the LEAP can solder the brushes
in for you too...but you're eroding your bottom line with each step
he does. You can get the bearings on by pressing (the right way) or
taping on with a block of wood. I use a big honking vise
(horizontal press) with sockets for spacers.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Just before you close up the electrical
connection end (opposite pulley), put a small screw driver or ice
pick through the opening above the brush holder and snap down both
brushes toward the collector. You should be able to see the spiral
spring ends position themselves on the tops of the brushes. Button
the rest of it up and put it back in the bus.</font></p>
