A vacuum advance distributor senses changes in the engine's LOAD -- and does
so almost instantaneously.  Mechanical advance distributors, which sense only
changes in rpm, are meant for special purpose applications, such as as drag
racing  or poorly designed multi-carb set-ups.... or moving a loaded Type II
with a 25hp engine.  
<p>
If you try to use a purely mechanical advance distributor in your daily
driver you will have to jack-up the output of the accelerator pump, since
providing a jolt of raw gas is the only way you can bump up the rpms, which
is the only way you can get the advance to kick in.  But before the revs can
build up you waste a lot of gas. This plays hell with your fuel economy and
shortens your engine's useful life at the same time.
<p>
People who run mechanical advance distributors usually have no idea how well
their Volkswagen can perform.
<p>
When you go back to a vacuum advance distributor you usually see a remarkable
improvement in both performance and economy.  The performance-change being
the typical perception of an engine that is now suddenly more responsive than
before.  The improvment in economy comes about because you're no longer
throwing away most of the accelerator pump's output each time you shift gears
or pull away from a stop.
<p>
The fact John Muir.... and all the tits & ass VW magazines.... say the
mechanical advance distributor is the best thing since canned beer is no
reason to assume this is true.  Muir advocates any number of things that are
incorrect, including many that are detrimental to your vehicle.    
<p>
I've written about the vacuum vs mechanical distributor situation many times
but most people still don't get it.  Volkswagen -- and all other auto makers
-- use vacuum-advance (or vacuum/centrifugal) because for normal driving such
distributors do a better job than a purely mechanical-advance device.
