<h3>Vacuum Advance VS Mechanical Advance</h3>
<p>by Robert S. Hoover</p>
<hr size="2">
<p><font size="+1">A vacuum advance distributor senses changes in
the engine's LOAD -- and does so almost instantaneously. Mechanical
advance distributors, which sense only changes in rpm, are meant
for special purpose applications, such as as drag racing or poorly
designed multi-carb set-ups.... or moving a loaded Type II with a
25hp engine.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">If you try to use a purely mechanical advance
distributor in your daily driver you will have to jack-up the
output of the accelerator pump, since providing a jolt of raw gas
is the only way you can bump up the rpms, which is the only way you
can get the advance to kick in. But before the revs can build up
you waste a lot of gas. This plays hell with your fuel economy and
shortens your engine's useful life at the same time.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">People who run mechanical advance distributors
usually have no idea how well their Volkswagen can
perform.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">When you go back to a vacuum advance distributor
you usually see a remarkable improvement in both performance and
economy. The performance-change being the typical perception of an
engine that is now suddenly more responsive than before. The
improvment in economy comes about because you're no longer throwing
away most of the accelerator pump's output each time you shift
gears or pull away from a stop.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The fact John Muir.... and all the tits & ass VW
magazines.... say the mechanical advance distributor is the best
thing since canned beer is no reason to assume this is true. Muir
advocates any number of things that are incorrect, including many
that are detrimental to your vehicle.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I've written about the vacuum vs mechanical
distributor situation many times but most people still don't get
it. Volkswagen -- and all other auto makers -- use vacuum-advance
(or vacuum/centrifugal) because for normal driving such
distributors do a better job than a purely mechanical-advance
device.</font></p>
