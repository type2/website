<h3>Auxiliary Battery Wiring</h3>
<p>by Bob Wallace</p>
<hr size="2">
<p><font size="+1">The purpose of the second battery is to provide
a power supply for lights TVs, radios, computers etc while the
vehicle is parked, while leaving an untouched supply for starting
the engine.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The second battery should ideally be a LEISURE
battery as that will provide 12 volts further into its discharge
cycle. Choose a battery that has a least the same cold cranking
amps as your driving battery and you will be able to jump start
yourself.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">On a split or loaf the favorite position for the
second battery is on the left of the engine bay (those with a gas
heater there will have to fit the second battery elsewhere). On a
Vanagon favorite is probably under the front seat on the other side
to the driving battery.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Where ever you put it, make sure its firmly
secured as we don't want it to fall over and throw acid around. Use
a chunky earth strap too - same size as on the driving battery will
be fine.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Electrically the installation should meet the
following criteria:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">1. Power must not be consumed from the driving
battery while stationary. This allows the second battery to be
completely drained but the camper will still start.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">2. Power must not be consumed from the driving
battery when the dynamo/alternator is not producing electricity
(during cranking or low rpm idling). This prevents power being
dumped from a fully charged driving battery to a flat auxiliary
battery as soon as the ignition key is turned.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">3. If a fridge is fitted it is desirable that
because it consumes a lot of current (so will quickly run an
auxiliary battery flat) that it should be isolated from both
batteries when stationary or idling. When camping the fridge can be
used on its mains electricity or propane/butane gas
settings.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Some of these criteria are meet by the fitting
of manual change over switches but forgetting to flip the switch
just once will leave you stranded.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">So to connect the battery meeting all the above
criteria.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Go to a camping/caravaning center, or look in
the towing accessories at your FLAPS, and buy a special relay for
charging a second battery. They will come with instructions and
will fulfill all of the above criteria - fit it and forget it, no
faffing around with manual switches.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">If you can not find one of the special relays
then its easy to make up your own with a couple of relays and a
plastic 'project' box from Radio Shack (or other electronics
store).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Use 2 double pole double throw (DPDT)
relays.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Relay 1 is triggered by turning the ignition on
and allows the current from the driving battery to be passed to
relay 2</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Relay 2 is triggered by the generator warning
light and prevents current going to the fridge/second battery when
the generator is not producing any charge</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">So here's the wiring diagram (in its various
states):-</font></p>
