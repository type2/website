<h3> Point Settings Explained</h3>
<p>
If the gap is too small the coil's magnetic field will not be fully collapsed
before it begins to re-charge.  The net effect is to reduce your spark
voltage and duration.  At anything above an idle this results in very doggy
performance.  
<p>
If the small point-gap was the result of rubbing block wear a check of your
timing would have shown it to be retarded by several degrees.
<p>
Oddly enough, setting your points either too wide OR too close... and then
timing the engine to that firing point, has about the same effect, which is
to limit performance to a relatively low rpm.
<p>
As a point of interest, you would not have noticed this problem with a CDI
module.  It requires only the initial triggering -- dwell is not a factor.
 Timing does change as the rubbing block wears (assuming you use the stock
points for the triggering signal) but it's a simple matter to check this
periodically and tweak the timing.  It takes about fifty thousand miles for
the rubbing block to wear-down to where the point will not open at all,
assuming you start with a point-gap of .020", proper lubricant and so forth,
at which point you may be able to simple re-set the gap (I got 138,000 miles
from a set of points on my Datsun).  Once the CDI module gets the firing
signal, it fires full-voltage every time.  Unlike your stock ignition system,
a CDI module pays no attention to when the points CLOSE, only to when they
OPEN, and that opening can only a thousandth of an inch and still get the job
done.
<p>
As part of the LPG conversion I'm investigating magnetic ignition triggering.
 I'm running a Pertronix 'Ignitor' on the bus and have another undergoing
non-destructive testing.  Pertronix offers only a 30 month warranty and I'd
like to know why.  The standard Hall Effect trigger should justify a longer
warranty.  (I'll be posting a report on this shortly.)  
<p>
If you are considering replacing your points with some other form of ignition
trigger I think it would be wise to AVOID optically triggered systems.
 Detroit -- and everyone else -- went to magnetic triggers for good reason.
