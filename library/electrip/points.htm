<h3>Points</h3>

<h3><font size="+1">Point Settings Explained</font></h3>
<p><font size="+1">If the gap is too small the coil's magnetic
field will not be fully collapsed before it begins to re-charge.
The net effect is to reduce your spark voltage and duration. At
anything above an idle this results in very doggy
performance.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">If the small point-gap was the result of rubbing
block wear a check of your timing would have shown it to be
retarded by several degrees.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Oddly enough, setting your points either too
wide OR too close... and then timing the engine to that firing
point, has about the same effect, which is to limit performance to
a relatively low rpm.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">As a point of interest, you would not have
noticed this problem with a CDI module. It requires only the
initial triggering -- dwell is not a factor. Timing does change as
the rubbing block wears (assuming you use the stock points for the
triggering signal) but it's a simple matter to check this
periodically and tweak the timing. It takes about fifty thousand
miles for the rubbing block to wear-down to where the point will
not open at all, assuming you start with a point-gap of .020",
proper lubricant and so forth, at which point you may be able to
simple re-set the gap (I got 138,000 miles from a set of points on
my Datsun). Once the CDI module gets the firing signal, it fires
full-voltage every time. Unlike your stock ignition system, a CDI
module pays no attention to when the points CLOSE, only to when
they OPEN, and that opening can only a thousandth of an inch and
still get the job done.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">As part of the LPG conversion I'm investigating
magnetic ignition triggering. I'm running a Pertronix 'Ignitor' on
the bus and have another undergoing non-destructive testing.
Pertronix offers only a 30 month warranty and I'd like to know why.
The standard Hall Effect trigger should justify a longer warranty.
(I'll be posting a report on this shortly.)</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">If you are considering replacing your points
with some other form of ignition trigger I think it would be wise
to AVOID optically triggered systems. Detroit -- and everyone else
-- went to magnetic triggers for good reason.</font></p>
