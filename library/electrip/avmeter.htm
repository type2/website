<h3>Ampere and Volt Meters</h3>
<p>by Austin Jack Smith</p>

<p><font size="+1">Basically, there are two types of ampere meters,
one uses an internal "shunt" to read the flow of electricity, which
means all power going from, or too your battery must pass thru the
meter which requires another pair of wires from the end of the bus
to the front. This wiring type is called "wired in series" This
additional wiring will result in a drop in voltage to your systems,
this drop is called "line loss" and will be noticable so I think
this would render a internal ampere meter a very poor
choice.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Another type of ampere meter, which would be
very expensive, is a type that requires a small "shunt" to be
placed next to the battery, instead of inside the meter, which
results in a very small line loss because the total electrical
passes thru the shunt and a very small pair of wires goes to the
ampere meter which is then reads this flow as total amperage flow,
although it is just a small amount, cost wise this would eleminate
this type of ampmeter. Unless you just had to have this
information.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">To provide a really good source of electrical
information is a Voltmeter, which are very popular in the newer
cars. Because it does tell you the status of your electrical
system. Low voltage when you switch on prior to engine rotation
tells you your battery is getting old and not holding a charge or
you left something on and ran your battery down. While an increase
in battery voltage after engine start will tell you your electrical
generating system is working and the voltage remaining a steady
reading of say 14.3 Volts indicates that your voltage regulator is
functioning properly, this should remain steady regardless of the
"load" placed on the system, of course when the engine is idling,
you shouldn't expect to run all the equipment at once.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The biggest plus of a voltmeter is that it is in
parallel with your system and only requires a very very small
amount of power to run it. The power can be taken from any convient
source that is on when the ignition is switched on. It is also much
cheaper to buy as well.<br></font></p>
