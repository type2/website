<h3>How to Make an 009</h3>
<p>by Brian Verbeek</p>
<hr size="2">
<p><font size="+1">A properly adjusted 009 will most likely be set
at around 7, 8, 9 deg BTDC. I would not recommend 20 deg static
timing with 009 as the total advance would be something like 40 to
45 deg BTDC--I'm pretty sure that'll destroy any VW
engine.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">If you're swapping distributors and you want to
determine the new static timing point, take your old static timing
point (OST) get the distributor advance of the original distributor
(ODA), and the new distributor advance (NDA), and make sure to
covert distributor degrees to crankshaft degrees (1 distributor
deg=2 crankshaft deg).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">New Static Timing= (OST+ODA)-NDA<br></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">if (I just put in any numbers):<br></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Old Static Timing, OST=7.5<br>
Original Distributor Advance, ODA=20<br>
New Distributor Advance, NDA=21<br></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">New Static Timing=(7.5+20)-21<br></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">New Static Timing=27.5-21<br></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">27.5-21= 6.5 crankshaft degrees (if you get a
negative number it's ATDC).<br></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">After you adjust the timing you can experiment a
little, as the formula is not a guarantee things will be fine. It
only helps to set the new distributor so as to give the same amount
of total advance as the stock distributor had. The new static
timing point might not let the engine idle properly, or the new
distributor might have a very aggressive advance curve, and might
give full advance at a different RPM. Be careful with settings of
more than 30 crankshaft degrees total advance static+distributor).
Be sure to check your engine's temperature frequently until you're
sure things are fine. Be extra careful when you have an extractor
exhaust system, as that will make it harder to detect
detonation.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>How to make your own '009'</b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">You can make your own 009 if you have some old
distributors laying around. Either call your Bosch importer to ask
the spec sheet of your distributor#, or stick the distributor in an
engine with a (properly) degreed pulley and use a timing light to
see how much it advances without the vacuum advance connected. The
spec sheet is the better way to go as you can ask for a 231 178 009
spec sheet at the same time so you can compare the distributor you
have to the 009.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Remove the vacuum canister and the point plate
from the distributor body. The point plate is actually two plates.
Remove the top one. Now you have the 009 point plate. It's exactly
the same (actually, most of the time, early 70s C+V distributors),
you only need to tap the hole for the screw that holds the points
(M2 or M3). The holes are in the proper location, but note that the
points have moved, so make sure that you change the #1 marking on
the edge of the distributor body accordingly so that #3 will get
its less-advanced-than-the-others spark. If you're lucky you have
the distributor body with an oval hole for the vacuum canister. If
that's the case you can use an oval plug from another distributor
to plug it. These plugs are either black or white plastic or
stamped out of sheetmetal. You might end up with a distributor that
suits your needs better than an 009.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I would only recommend a centrifugal advance
distributor for engines with (big) dual carbs or that have other
modifications to their intake system that disturb the vacuum signal
in the manifold and thus would not actuate the vacuum advance
properly. The stock distributor should work properly on a stock
engine.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">All numbers mentioned above are from the top of
my head. It can't hurt to double check them.</font></p>
