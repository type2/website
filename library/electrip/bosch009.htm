<h3>Timing the Bosch OO9</h3>
<p>by Ken Hooper</p>
<hr size="2">
<p><font size="+1">The thing about timing is that what matters most
is what happens at cruising speed, maximum advance--that's where
you can burn up an engine quickly if your timing is too far
advanced.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">But: The Bosch 009 does not have a predictable
advance curve--the German ones are different from the Brazilian
ones and the worn ones are different from the new ones and on it
goes. The natural result of this is that just because you've timed
the 009 properly at idle does not mean you have any way of knowing
what's going on at highway speeds.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">So while the stock vacuum advance distributors
can safely be timed at idle (or even timed statically per Muir,
although this is never optimal), the 009 has GOT to be timed to
about 30 degrees TOTAL ADVANCE with a timing light. Which means you
have to rev it up until the distributor stops advancing before you
can dial it in.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">It takes three hands and if the process isn't
painful, you aren't doing it right. =^ ) It's okay to time it
statically at around zero degrees in order to get the engine
started, but you have to finish the process dynamically by making
lotsa noise.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">It is very easy to find 30 degrees without a
degree wheel as long as you know where top dead center is. From
TDC, measure an inch and three quarters (1 3/4") to the right
around the diameter of a stock pulley. That's about 28 degrees, go
a tinch further and mark it with fingernail polish or
something.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">If you don't know where TDC is, then you have to
pull the #1 spark plug and push the eraser end of a pencil in the
hole and rotate the engine and feel the piston until you figure it
out.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">A basic timing gun is ~$20, get one and carry it
with you, it's an irreplacable tool.</font></p>
