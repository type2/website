<h3>Ignition Switch (Early Baywindow Bus)</h3>
<p>by Bob Wallace</p>
<hr size="2">
<p><font size="+1">The Bentley/Haynes manuals describe the removal
of the ignition switch, but only for the later models (of
bays/loafs) where the key is inserted downwards, sort of parallel
to the steering column.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">For the earlier type where the key is inserted
horizontaly from right to left into the lock held in a casting
between the column and the dash here's what to do....</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">DISCONNECT THE BATTERY</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Remove steering wheel, wiper switch, and
indicator switch from the column. Undo the screws in the underside
of the ignition switch housing; this will allow the outer column to
move up to give you some access (depending on how much slack you
have in the iginition wires).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">If you look straight on at the ignition lock
(from the right) imagine a tiny hole (1mm dia) in the lock casing
inside of the housing at about 10 or 11 o'clock, quite close to the
end where you put the key in.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><img src="../images/ignition.jpg"></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Take a paper clip (or stiff wire) and bend into
a L shape and fish around with the end for the little hole that you
cann't quite see or feel because it's on a shoulder of the lock
casing. Finding the hole with the end of the paper clip is the most
difficult part. Push the paper clip in against the slight
resistance of a spring and the lock part of the ignition switch
will slide out.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Reference to a replacement lock will show the
where the spring is and will help in locating the hole. The hole is
also shown, but only as a dot, in the appropriate drawing in the
parts manual - which is how I found it.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">If you wish to remove the electrical end of the
switch the tiny grub screw on the bottom of the casing will allow
it to slide out.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">To remove the central part of the lock (which
contains the steering column lock) remove both ends, as above, then
it's attached to the housing by two larger grub screws.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Assembly is the reverse of above.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>**Addendum to the original article (September
8, 1999)**:</b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The picture above shows the position of the
'magic hole' used for releasing the lock. However, I changed the
ignition on a '72 a couple of weekends back while
instructing/guiding on our clubs maintenance weekend and that was
slightly different from the picture and text in that the hole was
at the ten o'clock position rather than the eleven o'clock position
and there was no little ledge to help find the hole.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Be prepared to be patient - I know how to do
this, I had done it before, but it still took me over two hours - a
good part of which was trying to get the new lock in as it was a
tight fit. I also discovered the the lock was about 3mm shorter
with the key out - removing the key helped to fit.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Good luck (you will need it!)<br>
