<h3>Alternator Charging, Testing, and Output</h3>

<p><font size="+1">David Schwarze responds:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I've heard this too, although it annoys me that
an alternator is apparently not designed to run at its rated output
for any length of time.</font></p>
<blockquote><font size="+1"><i><b>Charging and voltage
regulators:</b><br></i></font>
<p><font size="+1"><i>The green wire from the voltage regulator
delivers a variable voltage (from 0-12V) to the alternator based on
the voltage of the battery. The alternator then delivers more or
less current (Amps) out of the fat red wire based on this
voltage.</i></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><i><b>To check the alternator without voltage
regulator:</b><br></i></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><i>With the fat red wire hooked up to the
battery (or starter bolt), unplug the wiring harness from the
voltage regulator and jump the green wire to 12V and start the
engine. This tells the alternator to deliver full capacity current
to the battery. You should see ~13.8V at the battery. If this works
and you are not getting the 13.8V when the harness is hooked to the
voltage regulator as normal, then point fingers at the regulator.
If it doesn't work, then you know your alternator is
bad.</i></font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Thank you, I've been wondering how that worked.
I guess you could also hook up an ammeter between the fat red wire
and the battery to measure the maximum output of the alternator,
right? I also guess that you should not run it in this "test mode"
for more than 60 seconds based on your first statement, or risk
overheating the alternator.</font></p>
<blockquote><font size="+1"><i><b>High output alternator
alternatives:</b><br></i></font>
<p><font size="+1"><i>My rebuilder says it's easy to put a Delco
200A alternator (able to put out 130A continuous) into a Bus. It
has it's own fan so you don't need to worry about hooking up boots
to the fan housing. He's put one into his friend's Bus and said he
would set me up with one for $150-200 ...</i></font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">I asked my rebuilder about this recently, and he
said that he wouldn't recommend putting any non-bus alternator in
because of the close proximity of the alternator to the exhaust and
other hot engine components. He said that models without the
cooling duct would overheat because of inadequate air circulation,
even if they have their own fan. I think he's right, especially in
the case of a high-capacity alternator such as the Delco 200
amp.</font></p>
<blockquote><font size="+1"><i>He says the 55A model I have won't
last very long charging multiple
batteries...</i></font></blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">I disagree. My 55 amp has been charging not two
but three batteries for many years. The reason it's not a problem
is because batteries charge in a non-linear fashion. They start out
drawing a large amount of current, typically 20-30 amps if you just
started the car, 50-100 amps if you wore it down overnight with the
headlights, and then taper off very quickly (like within 60
seconds) to a much smaller charge rate of 10-15 amps, which will
remain more-or-less steady until they are fully charged. When they
are fully charged, they will draw less than 1 amp from the
alternator (older, worn batteries may draw 3 amps
continuously).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The thing that will kill an alternator is if it
is overloaded by current-draining accessories like A/C, fog lights,
refrigerators, etc. If you have a 55 amp alternator and are using
50 amps worth of accessories while you drive, you risk killing your
alternator because the accessories don't "charge up", they will
just keep sucking down the power and never give your alternator a
chance to cool down.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">If you're still worried about dual batteries and
your 55 amp alternator, you can make life a little easier for it by
not turning on headlights, wipers, etc. for a minute or two when
starting up with a low auxiliary battery. This gives the alternator
time to overcome the initial spike of power demanded by the low
battery before additional demands are placed upon
it.<br></font></p>
