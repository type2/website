I spoke with my local alternator rebuilder today who just happens to be 
familiar with buses. (He does the engine work on a friend's Bus.)

<B>Output:</B><BR>

An alternator should only run at full capacity for no longer than a 
minute or so...Normally it should run at about half-capacity.

I've heard this too, although it annoys me that an alternator is apparently
not designed to run at its rated output for any length of time.

<B>Charging and voltage regulators:</B><BR>
<p>
The green wire from the voltage regulator delivers a variable voltage 
(from 0-12V) to the alternator based on the voltage of the battery. The 
alternator then delivers more or less current (Amps) out of the fat red 
wire based on this voltage. 
<p>
<B>To check the alternator without voltage regulator:</B><BR>
<p>
With the fat red wire hooked up to the battery (or starter bolt), unplug 
the wiring harness from the voltage regulator and  jump the green wire to 
12V and start the engine. This tells the alternator to deliver full 
capacity current to the battery. You should see ~13.8V at the battery. If 
this works and you are not getting the 13.8V when the harness is hooked 
to the voltage regulator as normal, then point fingers at the regulator. 
If it doesn't work, then you know your alternator is bad.

Thank you, I've been wondering how that worked.  I guess you could also
hook up an ammeter between the fat red wire and the battery to measure the
maximum output of the alternator, right?  I also guess that you should not
run it in this "test mode" for more than 60 seconds based on your first
statement, or risk overheating the alternator.

<B>High output alternator alternatives:</B><BR>

My rebuilder says it's easy to put a Delco 200A alternator (able to put 
out 130A continuous) into a Bus. It 
has it's own fan so you don't need to worry about hooking up boots to the 
fan housing. He's put one into his friend's Bus and said he would set me 
up with one for $150-200 ...

I asked my rebuilder about this recently, and he said that he wouldn't
recommend putting any non-bus alternator in because of the close proximity
of the alternator to the exhaust and other hot engine components.  He said
that models without the cooling duct would overheat because of inadequate
air circulation, even if they have their own fan.  I think he's right,
especially in the case of a high-capacity alternator such as the Delco 200
amp.

He says the 55A model I have won't last very long charging multiple 
batteries...

I disagree.  My 55 amp has been charging not two but three batteries for
many years.  The reason it's not a problem is because batteries charge in a
non-linear fashion.  They start out drawing a large amount of current,
typically 20-30 amps if you just started the car, 50-100 amps if you wore
it down overnight with the headlights, and then taper off very quickly
(like within 60 seconds) to a much smaller charge rate of 10-15 amps, which
will remain more-or-less steady until they are fully charged.  When they
are fully charged, they will draw less than 1 amp from the alternator
(older, worn batteries may draw 3 amps continuously).
<P>
The thing that will kill an alternator is if it is overloaded by
current-draining accessories like A/C, fog lights, refrigerators, etc.  If
you have a 55 amp alternator and are using 50 amps worth of accessories
while you drive, you risk killing your alternator because the accessories
don't "charge up", they will just keep sucking down the power and never
give your alternator a chance to cool down.
<P>
If you're still worried about dual batteries and your 55 amp alternator,
you can make life a little easier for it by not turning on headlights,
wipers, etc. for a minute or two when starting up with a low auxiliary
battery.  This gives the alternator time to overcome the initial spike of
power demanded by the low battery before additional demands are placed upon
it.
