<h3>Points/Condensor Troubleshooting</h3>
<p>by Jim Arnott</p>

<blockquote><font size="+1"><i>"I've got no spark at my coil and
can't figure out why. I have checked everything I can think of. I
have replaced the coil and condenser with new ones. I swapped out
the distributor. I ran a hot wire from the battery to the coil to
eliminate the ignition switch as a
possibility."</i></font></blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">My guess would be a grounded (or open) set of
points. (Two piece points? did you forget the fibre washer under
the spring?) First check for power to the coil. If you have 12v
there, then manually open the points and check for spark from the
coil. If no spark, remove the wire from the points and manually
"spark" it to ground. If spark, then problem is bad points or
condensor. If no spark, then the problem is coil or the wire to the
points. To check the coil, disconnect the wires from it and take
your multimeter (You do have a multimeter, don't you...) and check
the resistance between the 1 and the 15 terminals. I don't remember
how much it should be, but it will be a bunch. 20k ohms? It
shouldn't be open or shorted. If it is, replace it. To check the
points, rotate the engine 'til the points are open and check that
the fixed point has 0 resistance to ground and that the movable
point has infinate resistance to ground. Bad condensor? The only
way to check that is to replace it with a "known" good one. (A
known good one could be the one that you took out of the bus the
last time you tuned it and it was runnung.) The Kettering ignition
is really pretty simple to troubleshoot.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">To quote L.J.K. Setright:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"...a battery to supply electricity, a coil to
transform that low voltage supply to a much higher electrical
pressure, with the assistance of a contact breaker which triggers
it to produce a very high voltage pulse, which is led , via a
distributor, to the appropriate spark plug where the pulse comes
across the gap between the electrodes, igniting the charge in the
process. The only other essential is a condensor, wired to the
contact breaker to prevent excessive arcing or sparking across the
points as they open to trigger the pulse from the
coil..."</font></p>
