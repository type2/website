information at your own risk.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Most 1955-1967 VW headlight switches use rivets
to hold the contacts on the inside of the switch to the switch
body. 1962-1967 switches also use these rivets to hold the push-on
wire terminals on the outside to the switch body. For all of these
years, the rivets also serve as the electrical connection between
the outside terminals and the inside contacts. Over time, these
riveted connections can loosen up, leading to increased resistance,
heat at the connections, and dim headlights. If your headlights
seem dim and the headlight switch gets so hot that you can barely
hold the metal switch shaft, it's time to fix it! Fortunately, this
is easy to do. You can solder the rivets to the contacts on the
inside (and to the push-on wire terminals on the outside on later
switches), and clean the internal contacts, to get a much better
connection, less heat, and brighter headlights. This page describes
how to get into the switch, do the soldering and cleaning, and
reassemble the switch.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The first thing you have to do is get the switch
out of the Bus. <strong>Disconnect the battery negative cable
first!</strong> The headlight switch is supplied with an unfused
wire directly from the battery, so if you skip disconnecting the
battery, you <strong>will</strong> cause sparks and probably a
complete wiring harness fire if this wire grounds out on anything!
After you've disconnected the battery, unscrew the knob from the
switch and take out the screw holding it to the dash. This will let
you drop the switch below the edge of the dash where it's easier to
see and work with. Label each wire as you disconnect it, according
to the numbers molded into the body of the switch. When you have
all the wires loose, you'll have something like this. This is a
1962-1967 style switch with push-on wire terminals; earlier
switches are similar but have screw terminals.<br></font></p>

The key to getting into the switch is the rivets that hold the
metal piece on to the plastic base. If you look at the plastic
base, where the wire terminals are, you'll see three rivets - two
large and one small. <i>Only the two large rivets need to be
drilled out.</i> Here's a picture identifying the
rivets:<br></font>

<font size="+1"><br>
Use a drill bit as big as the head of the rivet, and drill until
the head is separated from the rivet. It is best and safest to
drill the heads of the rivets off the metal cover on the rear
(front is front) of the switch. Drilling at a 20 to 30 degree angle
from the hole in the center of the rivet reduces the rivet's
tendency to spin with the drill bit - if the rivet is just spinning
in its hole, it is impossible for the drill bit to remove the rivet
head. Once you have the rivet heads off, rock the metal piece back
and forth to separate it from the plastic base. Here are the two
pieces you will have at this point:<br></font>

<font size="+1"><br>
Here's the other side of the small rivet you should NOT have
drilled out. It holds one of the contacts for the rheostat (dimmer)
for the dash lights.<br></font>

<font size="+1"><br>
There are a couple of rubber seals on the shaft. You can leave them
on or take them off, but don't lose them. If you take them off,
don't forget to replace them later.<br></font>

<font size="+1"><br>
You can operate the switch, if you like, to see how it works.
Basically, there is a piece of brass wrapped around the square
plastic piece connected to the shaft. This brass piece connects the
various contact fingers that come up from the base of the switch.
From left to right, here are pictures of the switch in "off",
"park", and "on" positions:<br></font>

<font size="+1"><br>
If you have a US-spec switch, you may have noticed that the plastic
piece that moves with the shaft has a different contact arrangement
on one side:<br></font>
<center><font size="+1"><a href=
"vw-hauptlichtschalter-park-detail.jpg"><img src=
"vw-hauptlichtschalter-park-detail-thumb.jpg" alt=
"Front parking lights detail"></a></font></center>
<font size="+1"><br>
This is the contact that turns the "parking lights", "city lights",
or "running lights" in the front headlight rims <b>on</b> with the
parking lights but <b>off</b> when the headlights are on. It should
be under the contact finger connected to terminal 57. If your
switch doesn't have a terminal 57, it is a Euro-spec light switch.
If you have a switch like this and a Bus with US-spec wiring,
connect the front parking light wires (usually two thin gray wires
with one connector) to terminal 58 (rear parking lights) on the
headlight switch. If you're putting a US-spec switch into a Bus
with Euro-spec wiring, just leave terminal 57 disconnected.</font>
<p><font size="+1">Now, to fix it. Mark one side of the plastic
piece in the middle and its matching contact finger so you can get
it back together the right way (bits of masking tape will do). Pull
the shaft and plastic piece all the way out of the switch, noting
how the end of the shaft fits into the pocket on the rheostat.
Clean all the contact fingers and the brass piece on the plastic
block on the shaft with fine sandpaper, and remove any trace of oil
or grease from every electrical contact surface. Blow out the
residue from sanding. Also, clean off the wire terminals on the
outside of the switch with the sandpaper. Bend each internal
contact arm inward slightly so it contacts the sliding block
firmly. A light coat of dielectric grease on the internal contacts,
sliding block, and external wire terminals will greatly reduce
oxidation and resistance at the contacts.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Next, solder each of the rivets to its
corresponding contact finger. You will need a <i>hot</i> soldering
iron for this! I (Matt) tried 100 watt and 140 watt soldering guns
for this and neither one was really enough. Eric&amp;Barb use a 325
watt soldering gun, which works much better, helping to draw the
solder into the space between the wire terminals and the rivet
shafts in the switch body. Be sure to use either solid or
rosin-core solder; acid-core solder (as used for plumbing) will eat
out the innards of the switch! Thoroughly melted solder will follow
heat, so you can apply solder to one side of the rivets, heat the
other side of the rivet with the soldering iron, and suck the
solder under and between all the pieces. Try not to build up tall
"mountains" of solder on the rivets. Remember, the metal cover is
going back over all this, and you don't want the solder to short
out on the cover. Here's a couple of views of the soldered
rivets:<br></font></p>
<center><font size="+1"><a href=

"vw-hauptlichtschalter-solder-2.jpg"><img src=
"vw-hauptlichtschalter-solder-2-thumb.jpg" alt=
"Inside soldering 2"></a></font></center>
<font size="+1"><br>
When you're happy with the connections on the inside, solder each
rivet to its wire terminal on the outside as well. Pre-1962
switches with screw terminals have a solid connection from the
screw terminal to the inside contact, so they don't have rivets on
the outside to solder.</font>
<center><font size="+1"><a href=
"vw-hauptlichtschalter-solder-outside.jpg"><img src=
"vw-hauptlichtschalter-solder-outside-thumb.jpg" alt=
"Outside soldering 1"></a></font></center>
<font size="+1"><br>
Also, check the dimmer switch rheostat. This is a small circle of
coiled wire in the very front of the switch. It's behind the
plastic insulator in front of the inside contact fingers. If the
insulator or the wire are broken, the wire can short out to the
metal cover of the switch and leave you with a dead battery. If the
insulator or wire are already broken or look like they will soon,
you need to remove the insulator and wire completely. Then, solder
in a short insulated wire, inside the switch, from terminal 58 to
terminal 58b. 16, 18, or 20 gauge wire is fine - whichever one you
have handy. This way, the dash lights will come on full bright with
the parking lights and headlights, but you will lose the ability to
dim the dash lights.</font>
<p><font size="+1">When everything has been soldered, it's time to
re-assemble. Put the shaft and plastic piece back in the center of
the switch, fitting the end of the shaft into the pocket on the
rheostat, and aligning one side of the plastic piece with its
corresponding contact finger, using the marks you made earlier. Put
the rubber seals back on the end of the shaft if they're off.
Carefully line up the metal cover and push it on until it's seated
on the plastic base. Hold the cover to the base with one hand and
work the switch a couple of times with the other hand to make sure
it feels right.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Since you've drilled out the rivets, you'll need
some other way to hold the cover on the switch. Small nuts and
bolts work well. For the switch in the photos, #4 x 1/2" screws and
nuts were used. #6 screws or bolts can also be used. The closest
metric sizes to these are M3 and M4, with M3 probably being a
better bet. Some switches will require one side of the nuts to be
filed flat to fit properly against the bell-shaped metal cover of
the switch.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">If you want to check your work, you can do so
with an ohm-meter or a self-powered timing light. Measure between
the metal cover of the switch and each terminal on the back as you
work the switch through all its positions. You should show infinite
resistance (the light should be off) between the case and every
terminal. If you measure low resistance or the light comes on,
chances are that the metal cover is shorted to the solder on that
terminal inside the switch. Take the cover off and rework that
connection.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Once you're happy with the switch, put it back
in the Bus. Put the wires back according to the marks you made,
screw the switch back into the dash, and put the knob back on. To
double-check your work, look at the <a href=
"https://web.archive.org/web/20190816155922/http://www.vintagebus.com/wiring/">wiring diagram</a> for your
vehicle. Connect the battery ground strap back up, and try it out!
You should find that your headlight switch runs cooler, and that
your lights are a bit whiter and brighter.</font></p>
