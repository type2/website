Caframo [fan manufacturer] went from a quality motor built in
Canada that DID NOT cause TV interference that I still use after 8 years to
one made in China (got it at Camping World) that  has a smaller motor and
causes interference and lasted one season before being very noisy
(bearing play)....for the electric whizzes here-any idea why/how  a DC motor
can be  built that doesn't cause interference?  Isn't it a brushes thing???

Yep, the situation is that brushes tend to make sparks, which creates
broadband RF signals.  The cheaper, smaller brushes in inexpensive
motors have to carry more current and tend to spark more than heftier
brushes in quality motors.  This interference is most evident in AM
reception which is why AM radio and television video seem to suffer
more than FM radio and TV audio.
<P>
The solution to this is to short out the RF signals before they can
get very far from the brushes and into the power leads that can serve
as antennas.  For this you need something that will short out
electrical signals at radio frequencies, but not short out the circuit
entirely.

The device you need is a simple capacitor.  Go down to Radio Shlock
and get a few ceramic disc capacitors.  The value should be around
.01uf (microfarad) and the voltage rating should be 50 volts or
higher.  Price should be a buck or two, even at R. S. draconian rates.
<P>
You want to install this capacitor inside the fan, across the fan's
brushes and as close to the brushes as possible.  You might have to
play around with the value of the capacitor to find the right one.

Since you complained about the quality of the fans, I'll suggest that
you check out truck supply outfits to see if they carry better fans. 
Over-the-road trucks often use such fans inside their cabs and
obviously demand better durability than the Camping World crowd.  I'd
be prepared to pay a goodly sum for the durability, but this would be
advantagous in the long run as their better brushes would probably
run quietly!
