doesn't cause interference? Isn't it a brushes

<p><font size="+1">George Lyle responds:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Yep, the situation is that brushes tend to make
sparks, which creates broadband RF signals. The cheaper, smaller
brushes in inexpensive motors have to carry more current and tend
to spark more than heftier brushes in quality motors. This
interference is most evident in AM reception which is why AM radio
and television video seem to suffer more than FM radio and TV
audio.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The solution to this is to short out the RF
signals before they can get very far from the brushes and into the
power leads that can serve as antennas. For this you need something
that will short out electrical signals at radio frequencies, but
not short out the circuit entirely.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The device you need is a simple capacitor. Go
down to Radio Shlock and get a few ceramic disc capacitors. The
value should be around .01uf (microfarad) and the voltage rating
should be 50 volts or higher. Price should be a buck or two, even
at R. S. draconian rates.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">You want to install this capacitor inside the
fan, across the fan's brushes and as close to the brushes as
possible. You might have to play around with the value of the
capacitor to find the right one.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Since you complained about the quality of the
fans, I'll suggest that you check out truck supply outfits to see
if they carry better fans. Over-the-road trucks often use such fans
inside their cabs and obviously demand better durability than the
Camping World crowd. I'd be prepared to pay a goodly sum for the
durability, but this would be advantagous in the long run as their
better brushes would probably run quietly!</font></p>
