<h3>Converting Headlights to H4 Halogens</h3>
<p>by Ulf Nyman</p>
<hr size="2">
<p><font size="+1">All this talk about Sealed Beams, H4 and their
predecessor that we Europeans call "plain old headlight bulb" makes
me remind you all about VOLTAGE. When I upgraded my 1971 Kombi to
H4's I happened to measure the voltage at the bulb's socket. It was
just under 10 Volts. If you look at the scheme for your VW you can
understand why.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Let's follow the funny ways of the plus lead,
starting at the battery pole going to the starter motor, the fuse
block, light switch, relay and finally to the light bulb (I
probably forgot one or two). Every connection lowers the voltage a
bit, especially when the electrical system is getting old. All bay
window busses are old by now. :-) Ok, ok not the Mexican and
Brazilian ones....</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The remedy is a bypass operation. A new heavy
gauge cable from the battery (put an inline fuse near the battery)
to the dashboard ending up in two new relays, one for short beam
and one for long beam. The old system operates the relays. Put in
new cables and bulb sockets and WOW, what a difference! Two or
three volts makes a big difference in light power. Let's do the
math.......</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">This is what we should have:<br>
The Voltage should be about 13 Volts.<br>
The resistance in the bulb about 2.8 Ohms.<br>
The current is then 4.2 Amperes.<br>
This gives about 55 Watts.<br></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">This is what my '71 Kombi had:<br>
9.6 Volts.<br>
The resistance is relatively constant at 2.8 Ohms.<br>
This gives a current at 3.4 Amperes<br>
And a power of 32.6 Watts<br></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">55 Watts instead of 32.6 is a 41 % improvement!
This, plus the H4 upgrade allowed me to use sunglasses anytime
;-)</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I agree that these are a great way to improve
nighttime vision. I had a set of these (Brazilian Hella, I think)
clear back in the 80's and they were great. Two caveats
however:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">1. They don't have the alignment bumps on them
that sealed beams have, thus necessitating manual
alignment.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">2. They do, over time, get tarnished inside in
the silvering. I used mine for 7 or 8 years and could definitely
see some degradation inside. This is why they are not DOT legal [in
the US] and what DOT is protecting us from by making us use sealed
beams. Sealed beams are mediocre, but at least they won't get
worse! I'm sure they could be taken apart and resilvered, like the
lights on your 1934 Duesenburg J, but it might be cheaper to buy
another set for spares in a few years.</font></p>

improved headlight intensity on his older Vanagon after extending a
fresh, heavy gauge ground cable from the battery directly to the
grounds on the headlamps.]</font></p>
