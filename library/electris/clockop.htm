<h3>Clock Operation and Repair</h3>

<p><font size="+1">The analog clocks in older vehicles have an
escapement movement and simple gears like any simple clock or wrist
watch. The difference is in their mainsprings. VW clocks are wound
by a little electromagnet that ratchets an arm attached to the
mainspring. What happens is that a set of contact points closes a
circuit to the electromagnet, which pulls an arm and tensions the
spring. With a wound spring the clock just keeps working like a
wound watch. As the spring unwinds the arm, which contains one of
the contact points, slowly approaches the fixed contact point. At
contact the electromagnet kicks in again and ratchets the spring.
This cycle happens about once every five or ten minutes.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">When these clocks fail it is often because the
points get dirty or Oxidized [or because its small "fuse-wire" has
come loose--look for signs of its remains and re-attach]. There is
also an adjustment in the clock for regulating it. If it's running
slow or fast you can adjust it. It's been five years and I don't
remember the regulation details but I think they would be
self-explanatory once you took a look inside the clock. Regulating
a regular clock or watch is just a matter of changing the tension
on the balance wheel spring, making the wheel spin faster or
slower. Same in the VW clocks.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">So if you have an old analog clock you might try
a quick repair. The one in my van loses about a minute a day,
depending on the weather. It is disgustingly reliable. It also
keeps running even when you disconnect the battery for a few
minutes. That's something the digital wonders can't
claim.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Oh, by the way, don't try to lubricate or clean
the balance wheel and escapement unless you know how to deal with
balance wheel springs and watch pivots. These clocks will run for
years without any lubriction. Mine has been going for almost 25
years now. It makes a very satisfying little "kerchunk" every ten
minutes to tell me it's happy.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Which is all to say that it is not a constant
voltage that makes old analog clocks run true. The voltage just
winds them. The balance wheel spring regulates them.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I fix clocks all the time, sorta becoming a
hobby for me. 90% of the time it's a broken wire. This wire runs
from the contact points to a little metal arm on the coil. This
little are has a sort of double end on it. How do I explain this?
It's a little arm and on the end of it is a taco with a hole in it.
The arm bends enough to reach the points, and then you can squeeze
the taco on to the contact points. I have fixed several clocks this
way! You may also want to dress the points up a little, other wise
they arch and slam the arm back when the make
contact.<br></font></p>
