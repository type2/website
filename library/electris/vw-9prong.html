<p><font size="+1">Volkswagen used a combination flasher and relay
on 1966, 1967, and 1968 US-spec Buses for the turn signal and
hazard warning functions. 1966 Bugs, and 1967, 1968, and 1969 Bugs
and Ghias used a similar relay, without the brake light
connections. Similar relays may also have been used on other Types.
The Bus relay is commonly known as a "9 prong box". Some vendors
sell a kit to replace this box for anywhere from $50 to $70. In
this document, I describe the internals of one 9 prong box and
discuss how you can bypass it or build your own replacement, using
readily available parts, for $15-$30.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Note: Some of this discussion will make a lot
more sense if you can follow along in the wiring diagram for your
VW. Thom Fitzpatrick has put up color scans of *many* air-cooled VW
wiring diagrams, not just Buses, at <a href=

Thanks, Thom! I have also made a simple drawing of the original
hookup:</font></p>

There is a sticker on the bottom, around the terminals, that is
marked "12V 21W". It also has the color of the correct wire for
each terminal printed around the terminal. There was also a brown
ground wire coming out of a hole in the front just under the VW
part number.</font>
<p><font size="+1">Here are the functions and colors of the wires
connected to the box:<br></font></p>
<pre><font size="+1">

</font></pre>
<p><font size="+1">The box is held together by a long rivet through
the mounting hole. To get mine apart, I drilled out the rivet head
on the "back" side of the box. Then, I pried apart the three
snap-locks on the "front" side of the box - one on each side about
a quarter of the way from the bottom and one at the top center. The
"front" cover can then be removed (feeding the ground wire through
the hole) and the guts pulled out of the box.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The guts consist of three relays, eleven
resistors, four capacitors, and three transistors. I have not
completely mapped this circuitry out, other than to find that one
of the transistors simply drives one of the relay coils. Some of
the circuit also must detect when a load is placed on the box (by
turning on the turn signals or hazard flashers) so it will start
operating. I would assume that the other two transistors are in the
"classic" multi-vibrator circuit to provide a steady pulse
stream.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">One of the relays is driven by these pulses. One
contact of this relay is connected to battery voltage, and the
other is connected to the 49a terminal, through the coil of the
second relay, to provide the pulses to the turn signals. In other
words, it performs the same function as a two-terminal
flasher.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The second relay mentioned above is somewhat
special. Most automotive relay coils are wound with many, many
turns of very fine wire and are designed to have full battery
voltage across the coil. This one, however, is wound with a few
turns of heavy wire and is designed to drop very little voltage
across the coil. The coil is wired in series between the pulsing
battery voltage provided by the first relay and the 49a output to
the turn signal switch. One of its contacts is grounded, and the
other contact goes to the KBL terminal for the indicator light in
the speedometer.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The effect of all this is that this second relay
<strong>monitors</strong> the current being output to 49a. Only if
sufficient current flows will the contacts close, causing the
speedometer indicator light to illuminate. This is done to provide
a lamp failure indication. If one of your turn signal bulbs (front
or back) burns out, the other bulb on that side will still flash.
However, it will draw about half of the normal current, so this
second relay will not activate, keeping the speedometer indicator
light off. This is to alert you (the driver) that one of your bulbs
is burned out. Note that if both of your turn signal bulbs on one
side are burned out or disconnected, nothing will happen when you
flip the turn signal lever to that side.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Aside: The older round can flashers also
provided this function. Even on semaphore Buses, the speedometer
indicator light is not simply in parallel with the semaphore coils
and lights, but is instead switched on a separate wire from a
switch on the semaphore that only closes when the semaphore is
fully extended. The various US and EU regulations usually require
this kind of monitoring function for the turn signals.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The third relay is the largest and has four
poles. One side of its coil is connected to terminal 30 (battery
voltage at all times) and the other side is connected to the -S
terminal. The -S terminal is switched to ground by the hazard
switch on the dash to turn this relay on.<br>
One of the poles on this relay is connected to the VR terminal and
another pole is connected to the VL terminal. With the hazards off
(relay unpowered), the relay does not connect VR or VL to anything
else. With the hazards on (relay on), VR and VL are both connected
to 49a. This makes the front turn signals flash regardless of the
position of the turn signal switch.<br>
The third pole performs a similar function for the brake light. The
"wiper" (movable contact) is connected to terminal 54f, the brake
light output. With the hazards off (relay unpowered), the relay
connects 54f to 54, the input from the brake light switch on the
master cylinder. With the hazards on (relay powered), the relay
connects 54f to 49a, so the rear turn signal and stop lamps will
flash regardless of the position of the turn signal switch.<br>
Finally, the fourth pole basically makes sure that the turn signals
only work with the ignition on but that the hazards work anytime.
The "wiper" is connected to everything inside the box that needs
battery voltage to operate. With the hazards off (relay unpowered),
the relay connects the wiper to terminal 15 (battery voltage with
key on). With the hazards on (relay powered), the relay connects
the wiper to terminal 30 (battery voltage on at all
times).</font></p>

<h3><font size="+1"><a name="Troubleshooting" id=
"Troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</a></font></h3>
<p><font size="+1">First, know that the 9 prong box has nothing to
do with your headlights! If you are having trouble with your
headlights, look elsewhere. Also, if you can get any of the turn
signal bulbs on the car at all to flash, the 9 prong box is not the
first place to look. Check out your turn signal switch and the
wiring first. Also make sure that the bulbs are not burned out, and
that they are well-seated in their sockets. Check all the fuses
too.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><strong>WARNING:</strong> Terminal 30 is a
direct unfused feed from the battery! Do NOT let anything connected
to this terminal touch anything that is grounded (like all of the
body sheet metal) or a major meltdown WILL result! If you have one
end of your jumper wire clipped to 30, pay attention to where the
other end is. It would be best to use the kind of alligator clips
that have a plastic sleeve over them. Consider making a fused
jumper wire with a 16 A fuse in an inline holder.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Testing: You will either need a short piece of
wire, 12 to 16 gauge (2.5 to 1.0 mm<sup>2</sup>), with alligator
clips on each end, or a friend. With the key off and turn signal
and hazard flashers off, pull the wire off terminal VL on the 9
prong box and either touch it to the wire on terminal 30 (with your
friend watching the light) or use the alligator clip wire to make
the connection so you can go outside and look. If you are
friendless, park against a wall so you can see the light reflected
at you.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">If the left front light doesn't light up when
you do this, there is a problem in the wiring, with the bulb, or in
the socket. Put the VL wire back on its terminal when you've
figured it out. Repeat the same test for VR: pull the wire off of
VR and touch that wire to 30 and the right front light should come
on. Put the VR wire back when you're done with it.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">To test the rear lights (and a partial checkout
of the turn signal switch), do this. Pull off the wire connected to
terminal 54f and touch it to terminal 30. Make sure both of your
rear lights come on. Now, with the key off, flip the turn signal
switch into "left turn". Your left rear light should go out but the
right one should stay on. Now flip the switch to "right turn" and
your left rear light should be on and the right one should be off.
If this is not as expected, the trouble is in the turn signal
switch, wiring, bulbs, or sockets. Put the wire back on 54f when
you're done.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Finally, to finish checking out the turn signal
switch, pull off the wire connected to terminal 49a and touch it to
terminal 30. Flip the turn signal switch to "left turn" and both
the front and rear left turn signal lamps should come on steadily.
Flip the switch over to "right turn" and both the front and rear
right turn signal lamps should come on steadily. If not, there is a
problem in the turn signal switch, wiring, bulbs, or sockets. Put
the wire back on 49a when you're done.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">To test the speedometer indicator light, pull
off the wire connected to terminal KBL, ground it to the body, and
turn the ignition on. The indicator light should light up. If not,
there is a problem with the ignition switch, wiring, bulb, or
socket. Once the indicator light is working, you can use it to
check the hazard switch. Pull off the wire connected to terminal -S
and hold it and the wire from KBL together (both wires disconnected
from the 9 prong box). Turn the ignition on and you should be able
to make the speedometer indicator light go on and off by operating
the hazard flasher switch. If not, there is trouble in the hazard
flasher switch or its wiring. When done, turn off the ignition and
replace all wires on their terminals.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">To test the warning light in the hazard switch,
pull off the wire on terminal "K" on the hazard switch. Run your
jumper wire from "K" on the hazard switch to "30" on the 9-prong
box. Pull out the hazard switch and the light should come on. If
not, either the bulb or socket or the grounding of the hazard
switch is the trouble. Remove the jumper and put the wire back on
"K" when you're done.</font></p>

<h3><font size="+1"><a name="Replacement" id=
"Replacement">Replacement</a></font></h3>
<p><font size="+1">There are a few ways to do this. I outline three
ways: one that will get you down the road with turn signals and
brake lights but no hazard flashers, and two that almost completely
duplicate the functions of the original box. Either way is
completely reversible - if you find a working 9-prong box later and
want to go back, you can do so just by unplugging this replacement
and plugging the box back in. All of this assumes that you
currently have a stock setup, with no hacking on the
wiring.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><strong>Disconnect your negative battery cable
before fooling around with this!</strong> Only hook it back up when
all wiring is secure and ready to test.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Note that red push-ons are for 22-18 gauge
(0.5-0.75 mm<sup>2</sup>) wire and blue push-ons are for 16-14
gauge (1.0-1.5 mm<sup>2</sup>) wire. If you need to connect two 18
gauge (0.75 mm<sup>2</sup>) wires to one push-on, twist the ends of
the wires together and use a blue push-on.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><u>Method 1</u>: Turn signals and brake lights
only.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><img src="vw-9prong-fig2.png" alt=
"Simple 9-prong box replacment"></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">If you don't have to have emergency flashers,
you can do the following. You'll need a replacement 6v or 12v
flasher (2 or 3 terminal) from the auto parts store, some
electrical tape, some 14 gauge (1.5 mm<sup>2</sup>) wire, and some
push-on terminals.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Pull the wire connected to -S off of the 9 prong
box and tape up the end. Pull the wire connected to VL off of the 9
prong box and tape up the end. Pull the wire connected to VR off of
the 9 prong box and tape up the end. Pull the wire connected to 15
off of the 9 prong box and tape up the end.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Cut a 4"/10cm piece of wire and crimp one male
push-on on each end. Pull the wire connected to 54 off of the 9
prong box and connect it to one end of your new wire. Pull the wire
connected to 54f off of the 9 prong box and connect it to the other
end of your new wire. Tape up these connections, then temporarily
reconnect your battery negative cable and make sure your brake
lights work. <strong>DO NOT DRIVE A CAR WITH THE BRAKE LIGHTS NOT
WORKING!</strong> When you're happy, disconnect the battery
negative again and continue.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Pull the wire connected to 30 off of the 9 prong
box and connect it to terminal X on your new flasher. Pull the
wires connected to 49a and KBL off of the 9 prong box. If you have
a 3-terminal flasher, connect the 49a wire to "L" and the KBL wire
to "P". If you have a 2-terminal flasher, connect both the 49a and
the KBL wire to "L". You can make up a "Y" cable using one male
push-on, two short pieces of wire, and two female push-ons, or use
a ready-made adapter. When all this is hooked up, hook the battery
back up, and test your turn signals. If they work OK, mount the new
turn signal flasher somewhere--just taping or zip-tieing the metal
can to one of the wiring bundles is fine. Make sure none of the
terminals can ground out on the body. The 9 prong box may still
have a ground wire hooked up--disconnect this ground wire and take
the 9 prong box out of the car as you don't need it
anymore.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><u>Method 2</u>: Turn signals, brake lights, and
hazards - relays - nearly exact duplicate of original
functionality.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><img src="vw-9prong-fig3.png" alt=
"Complete 9-prong box replacment - relays"></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">You'll need some 14 gauge (1.5 mm<sup>2</sup>)
wire, some 18 gauge (0.75 mm<sup>2</sup>) wire, some push-on
terminals, a replacement 6v or 12v 3-terminal flasher, and four
SPDT relays. If you have a 12v VW and use a #559 flasher, you can
get an exact duplicate of original functionality. If your VW is
12v, you can use standard automotive SPDT relays. These are
generally available at your local auto parts store, and car alarm
and stereo shops. The relay must have five terminals labeled 85,
86, 30, 87, and 87a. If it doesn't have these numbers someplace on
the relay, it's not the right kind of relay. Some of the
five-terminal relays sold for driving lights and such have 87 and
87a connected together all the time, which won't work. You can make
all the connections to these relays with 1/4" push-ons, but there
are also standard sockets that may make your life a bit easier.
Mouser Electronics carries a suitable relay (526-R51-5D40-12F) for
about $6; All Electronics usually has a couple of different
suitable relays in stock (RLY-351, RLY-356) for $3 or so, and they
also sell the sockets (SRLY-2) for $2 each.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">If you have a 6v VW, it's harder to find 6v
relays. The most suitable, readily available item I have found is a
5 v Magnecraft/Struthers-Dunn relay from Mouser Electronics,
Magnecraft W9AS5D52-5 and Mouser 528-9522-5, $3.50. This relay has
sufficient DC contact rating for automotive use, push-on
connectors, and a flange mounting. You will also need a 2.4 ohm, 5
watt resistor (Mouser 280-CR10-2.4, $0.60) to reduce the voltage to
the relay coils, and some 0.187" (3/16") push-ons.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">In case you're wondering about the "exact
functionality" part, it has to do with the indicator light in the
speedometer. Originally, this light is on when the outside turn
signal lights are on. If you use a generic 3-terminal flasher, the
speedometer light will be off when the outside lights are on, and
vice versa. The #559 flasher has a separate set of contacts for the
indicator light, which lets you wire it to work exactly as the
original.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Cut three (6v) or four (12v) 4"/10cm pieces of
18 gauge wire. Make a daisy chain with the wire and five push-ons
like the following. == is wire, | is a male push-on, [] is a female
push-on, and --RR-- is the resistor (6v only).<br></font></p>
<pre><font size="+1">
12v    |======[]======[]======[]======[]   (all 1/4" push-ons)
6v     |--RR--[]======[]======[]======[]   (first one is 1/4", rest are 3/16")
</font></pre>
<p><font size="+1">Plug each female push-on onto terminal 85 (12v)
or either of the small terminals (6v) on a relay. The male push-on
goes to the "-S" wire.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Cut four 4"/10cm pieces of 18 gauge wire and one
4"/10cm piece of 14 gauge wire. Make up a daisy chain using six
push-ons like the following. == is 18 gauge wire and ** is 14 gauge
wire.<br></font></p>
<pre><font size="+1">

</font></pre>
<font size="+1">Plug the female push-on with the 14 gauge wire into
terminal 87 (12v) or terminal NO (6v) of one relay. Plug all
remaining female push-ons into terminal 86 (12v) or the other small
terminal (6v) of each relay. Plug the male push-on into the "30"
wire. The relay with two push-ons from this string on it is the
"power" relay - remember that.</font>
<p><font size="+1">Hook your battery back up temporarily and pull
the hazard flasher switch out. All four relays should click when
you do this. Push it back in and they should click again. When
you're happy, disconnect the battery again.</font></p>

of each of the three relays that have an unconnected terminal 87 or
terminal NO.</font>

terminal "X" on the flasher.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">If your flasher has four terminals (the #559
flasher), you should have one terminal left over, E. Cut a piece of
18 gauge wire long enough to reach a handy ground (like a screw or
bolt that goes into the body). Crimp a ring terminal on one end and
a 1/4" female push-on on the other end. Put the ring terminal under
the screw or bolt and plug the push-on onto the E terminal on the
flasher.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Once you're happy that it's working, you need to
figure out where and how to mount the relays. The 12v ones have a
handy mounting tab; the 6v ones have notches in their flanges for a
mount. I have mounted several of the 12v ones before by attaching
them to a strip of pipe strap - a mild steel strap about 3/4" (2
cm) wide with holes in it - and bolting the strip to the body. For
the flange mount ones, it might be easier to bolt them to a thin
sheet of plastic or metal, and then mount that sheet to the body.
Make sure none of the connections can ground out on the body sheet
metal! On the 6v version, it is normal for the resistor to get warm
in operation - it's dissipating around 2 to 3 watts. So make sure
the resistor isn't right up against anything that can melt, like
another wire.</font></p>

Bus, 231-953-235A. If you have a 12v VW and use a #559 flasher, you
can get an exact duplicate of original functionality. You'll also
need some 18 gauge (0.75 mm<sup>2</sup>) wire, some 14 gauge (1.5
mm<sup>2</sup>) wire, some 12 gauge (2.5 mm<sup>2</sup>) wire, and
some push-on terminals. If you have a 6v Bus, you may need to
replace the 12v light bulb in the switch knob with a 6v
bulb.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">In case you're wondering about the "exact
functionality" part, it has to do with the indicator light in the
speedometer. Originally, this light is on when the outside turn
signal lights are on. If you use a generic 3-terminal flasher, the
speedometer light will be off when the outside lights are on, and
vice versa. The #559 flasher has a separate set of contacts for the
indicator light, which lets you wire it to work exactly as the
original.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">If you can get the 9-prong box wires to reach
the dash where the new switch will be installed, great! However,
you'll probably have to make extension wires for some of the
connections - just a length of wire with a female push-on on one
end and a male push-on on the other. When you connect this
extension wire to the original wire where the 9-prong box used to
be, wrap the connection with electrical tape so it doesn't short
out on anything.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Unplug the "K" (blue) wire from your old hazard
light switch and tape up the end. Cut a piece of 18 gauge wire long
enough to reach from where the 9-prong box was to a handy ground
(like a screw or bolt that goes into the body). Crimp a ring
terminal on one end and a 1/4" male push-on on the other end. Put
the ring terminal under the screw or bolt and plug the "-S" wire
onto the male push-on. Unplug the brown wire from your old hazard
light switch and plug it onto the "31" terminal on the new
switch.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">First, plug the "30" wire onto the "30" terminal
on the new switch. Use a 12 gauge extension wire as required. Plug
the "15" wire onto the "15" terminal on the new switch - for this
and all other extension wires, you can use 14 gauge wire. Plug the
"54" wire onto the "54" terminal on the new switch, and plug the
"54f" wire onto the "54f" terminal on the new switch.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Hook your battery back up temporarily, turn on
the ignition, and step on the brakes - your brake lights should be
on. Pull the hazard flasher switch out, and your brake lights
should go off. When you're happy, disconnect the battery
again.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Plug the "VR" wire onto the "R" terminal on the
new switch, and plug the "VL" wire onto the "L" terminal on the new
switch. Make up a 12 gauge wire about 6" (15cm) long with female
push-ons on each end. Plug one end onto the "+" terminal on the new
switch and the other end onto the "X" terminal on the new flasher.
Plug the "KBL" wire onto the "P" terminal on the new flasher. Make
up a "Y" cable with two 14 gauge wires, each about 6" (15cm) long.
Twist these two wires together on one end and crimp a male push-on
on the twisted wires. Crimp a female push-on on the other two ends.
Plug one of the female push-ons onto the "L" terminal on the new
flasher, and the other one onto the "49a" terminal on the new
switch. Plug the male push-on onto the "49a" wire, and wrap this
connection with electrical tape.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">If your flasher has four terminals (the #559
flasher), you should have one terminal left over, E. Cut a piece of
18 gauge wire long enough to reach a handy ground (like a screw or
bolt that goes into the body). Crimp a ring terminal on one end and
a 1/4" female push-on on the other end. Put the ring terminal under
the screw or bolt and plug the push-on onto the E terminal on the
flasher.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Hook the battery back up and try it out! See the
chart above for the proper responses. When you're happy, you need
to figure out where to mount the new flasher - just taping or
zip-tieing the metal can to one of the wiring bundles is fine. Make
sure none of the terminals can ground out on the body.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">You can use a Bus relay on a Bug and just ignore
the terminals for 54 and 54f, as long as the voltage
matches.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">You can use a Bug relay on a Bus, as long as the
voltage matches, by adding one external relay for the brake light
function. If anyone wants detailed directions for this, let me
know.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Someone asked about adding hazard flashers to a
Bus that didn't have them from the factory. Probably the simplest
way to do this using stock VW parts is to use the hazard light
switch and relay from a '63, '64, or '65 Bus. You could also use a
9-prong box or the 9-prong box replacement I have described above.
When using the '63-'65 switch and relay, the hazards will only work
with the ignition key on.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><u>Method 1</u>: Adding hazard flashers to a
'58-'62 bus with the '63-'65 switch and relay. It appears that the
switch simply connects all four of its terminals together when
activated, so exact terminal assignment is not important. First,
disconnect your battery negative cable.<br>
Run a 14 gauge wire from one terminal on the switch to terminal 54
or S on your existing turn signal flasher. Both the stock wire and
this new wire should be connected to 54 or S.<br>
Run a 14 gauge wire from another terminal on the switch to the left
rear lamp wire at the turn signal switch connector - the
black/yellow stripe wire. Again, connect this new wire in addition
to the existing wire.<br>
Run a 14 gauge wire from another terminal on the switch to the
right rear lamp wire at the turn signal switch connector - the
thicker of the two black/orange stripe wires. Again, connect this
new wire in addition to the existing wire.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Temporarily reconnect the battery, turn on the
ignition, and turn on the hazard switch. Both rear lights should
flash. The front ones will not flash yet. Note: If you step on the
brake, the rear lights will probably light up steadily as long as
you are stepping on the brake, then go back to flashing when you
let off. When you're happy, disconnect the battery and
proceed.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Run an 18 gauge wire from the last terminal on
the switch to terminal 86 on the relay.<br>
If the relay has a terminal 85, run an 18 gauge wire from it to
ground (body sheet metal.) If not, the relay grounds through its
case. Make sure the relay is well-mounted to the body for a
ground.<br>
Run a 14 gauge wire from terminal 30 on the relay to terminal 15 on
your existing turn signal flasher. Both the stock wire and this new
wire should be connected to 15.<br>
Run a 14 gauge wire from terminal 87 on the relay to the left front
lamp wire at the turn signal switch connector - the black/white
stripe wire. Again, connect this new wire in addition to the
existing wire.<br>
Run a 14 gauge wire from terminal 87a on the relay to the right
front lamp wire at the turn signal switch connector - the
black/green stripe wire. Again, connect this new wire in addition
to the existing wire.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Connect the battery back up and try it. All four
lights should flash when you pull out the switch. As before, the
rear lights will probably light steadily if you step on the brakes
with the hazard flashers on, although the front lights will
continue to flash.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><u>Method 2</u>: Adding hazard flashers to a
'58-'62 Bus using a 9 prong box or the replacement discussed above.
For 6 volt systems, use the '66 9 prong box, and for 12 volt
systems, use the '67 or '68 9 prong box. For either system, you'll
need a simple on-off switch for the hazards. Start by disconnecting
the battery negative cable.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Swap wires from existing turn signal flasher to
new 9 prong box:<br>
Pull the wire off of 15 on the turn signal flasher and connect it
to 15 on the 9 prong box.<br>
Pull the wire off of 54 or S (black with green and white stripes)
on the turn signal flasher and connect it to 49a on the 9 prong
box.<br>
Pull the remaining light blue/white stripe wire off of the turn
signal flasher and connect it to KBL on the 9 prong box.<br>
Ground the brown ground wire coming out of the 9 prong box.<br>
Temporarily reconnect the battery and try your turn signals - they
should work just like they did before. When you're happy,
disconnect the battery again and proceed.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Run a 14 gauge wire from terminal VL on the 9
prong box to the left front lamp wire at the turn signal switch
connector - the black/white stripe wire. Again, connect this new
wire in addition to the existing wire.<br>
Run a 14 gauge wire from terminal VR on the 9 prong box to the
right front lamp wire at the turn signal switch connector - the
black/green stripe wire. Again, connect this new wire in addition
to the existing wire.<br>
Run a 10 gauge wire from terminal 30 on the 9 prong box to the top
end of your leftmost fuse - the one that should already have two
thick red wires on it.<br>
Run an 18 gauge wire from terminal -S on the 9 prong box to one
terminal of your new switch. Run an 18 gauge wire from the other
terminal of your new switch to ground.<br>
Disconnect the brake light wire at the turn signal connector - the
skinnier of the two black/orange stripe wires. Connect the harness
end to a piece of 14 gauge wire and run this wire to 54 on the 9
prong box. Run another 14 gauge wire from 54f on the 9 prong box to
the turn signal end of the wire you just disconnected.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Hook the battery back up and try it! The proper
operation should be the same as in the chart above. The hazards
should work with the ignition on or off, and stepping on the brakes
with the hazards on will have no effect.</font></p>
