 <H2>Ignition Timing</H2>
 <P>
 <HR ALIGN=CENTER>
 <P>
 Timing dynamically is fairly simple and is the best way to time your
 engine.  Static timing is good for a baseline adjustment, but real
 accuracy requires a timing light.  You can get a timing light for about
 $30 at Wal-Mart, so it's not a big expenditure and is a wise investment.
 To set timing you will also need a tach/dwell meter.
 <P>
 The first step to setting your timing is to <A HREF="valveadj.htm">adjust your valves</A>.  Valve
 adjusting is to be done on a stone cold engine and is a topic for
 another procedure, but John Muir explains well how to do it in his Idiot
 book.  If you have a '78 or later Bus with hydraulic valve lifters, you
 can skip this step.
 <P>
 Once that's done, you need to <A HREF="points.htm">adjust your points</A>.  NEVER set the timing
 before setting the point gap.  Changing the point gap changes the
 timing.
 <P>
 Once that's done, you can proceed to set your idle speed.  Do not adjust
 the timing until you've adjusted the idle speed to specifications
 (usually between 800 and 1000 rpm on the VW engine).  Idle speed
 adjustment can only be done on a warm engine.  This is where you need
 the tach/dwell meter.
 <P>
 OK, now that you've done all the above, you can mess with your timing.
 First look at your timing light.  You will see two alligator clip type
 leads and a black box lead.  The two alligator clip leads are for power
 and ground for the timing light, red is power and black is ground.  the
 black box is the inductive pickup.  You simply 
 clip the 
 inductive lead
 over the spark plug wire for the #1 cylinder (cylinder numbers are
 stamped on the tin next to each cylinder).  OK, so you've been out
 driving and the engine's all nice and warm and you just adjusted your
 idle speed to spec.  OK, turn off the engine.  The first thing you'll
 want to do here is mark the timing notch on the pulley with something to
 make it more visible.  Chalk or white-out do wonders.  You can crank the
 engine around with a wrench on the alternator nut to bring the timing
 notch into view, and then mark it with chalk or whatever.
 <P>
 Now, hook up your timing light.  Clip the power lead to the + terminal
 on the battery or the + side of the coil (make sure it's the + side or
 you'll blow that sucker -- ask me how I know).  You want to hook the power lead of the timing light to the terminal on the coil that the condenser does NOT connect to.  
<P>
<CENTER><img class="img-responsive" SRC="images/power.jpg"></CENTER>
<P>
Clip the ground lead to
 a good ground.  Hook the inductive pickup on the #1 spark plug wire and
 then start the engine.  
<P>
<CENTER><img class="img-responsive" SRC="images/induct.jpg"></CENTER>
<P>
Also, at this point, if your engine needs to be
 timed with a vacuum hose disconnected, this is a good time to disconnect
 and plug it.  Pencils make good plugs.  
 <P>
 Now, you've started the engine.  Let it idle, check your idle speed
 again just to make sure it's within spec.  OK, pull the trigger on your
 timing light.  You should see the strobe flash in time with the engine.
 If not, check your ground.  Some places that seem like good grounds
 really aren't.  Now, point the strobe at the crankshaft pulley.  You
 should be able to see the strobe highlight your timing notch.  Then look
 where it is in relation to where it's supposed to be.  On a Type 1
 engine, the notch is supposed to line up with the crack in the engine
 case (case seam).  On the Type 4 engine, the notch should line up with
 the proper number on the plastic timing scale.  If it doesn't, you need
 to make the adjustment.
 <P>
 What you do now is get out your 10mm wrench.  Look toward the
 bottom of the distributor, you will see a clamp that goes around the
 distributor body with a 10mm nut holding it closed.  Loosen this 10mm
 nut a bit and slowly turn the distributor body by hand while watching
 the timing mark in the strobe light.  As you turn the distributor body,
 you will see the mark move and probably hear the change in engine speed.
 Turn the distributor so the mark moves to where it's supposed to be and
 then tighten the 10mm nut.
 <P>
 That's it, you've timed your engine!! 
 <P>
 As an addendum to this topic, I've had a couple people ask me questions
 about timing a Type 1 engine which just has a notch in the pulley.  I've
 been asked what value the notch represents.
 <P>
 The best answer I can give you is that it depends.  First it depends on you having the correct pulley for your engine, which is not always the case.  Secondly it depends on the year of your engine what the timing spec is.  Your best bet is to look in the Bentley manual for your year and find your timing spec.  It should show you what the different notches stand for for that year.  Some have only one notch, in which case that's the notch that should line up with the seam in the crankcase, however some have 3 notches which represent different timing settings.  Consult the manual to be sure.
<P>
If you have a Type 4 engine, this should not be an issue.  A Type 4 engine has a plastic or metal timing scale attached to the fan housing right by the pulley.  You just line the notch up with the correct number on the scale.  If your timing scale is missing, go buy a new one.  They are still available.
