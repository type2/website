<H2>Clutch Replacement</H2>
<P>
<HR ALIGN=CENTER>
<P>
<B>APPLICATION:</B>  Early Vanagons and late Buses with the Type 4 air-cooled
engine and manual transmission.
<P>
What you need to buy before you start:  new clutch disc, new pressure plate,
new clutch release bearing (throwout bearing), new pilot bearing, and new
front main oil seal.  Some of these parts can be purchased in a clutch kit.
<P>
The first step in this job is <A HREF="engineout.htm"> removal of the 
engine and transmission</A>.
<P>
Now with the engine and transmission out of the car and lying on the ground
separated, you can replace the clutch.  The first step is to remove the 
pressure plate from the flywheel.  There are 6 13mm bolts holding it on.
You need to loosen them a little at a time as the pressure plate is under
tension.  Break these bolts loose and then loosen them a half-turn at a time
until the tension is relieved.  Then remove the bolts.
<P>
Now the pressure plate can be removed.  It is held onto the flywheel by 
four dowel pins, so gently wiggle it off of the flywheel.
<P>
Now the clutch disc is easily removed, it just sits in between the pressure
plate and flywheel and is free to be removed now that the pressure plate
is off.
<P>
Next step is to remove the flywheel.  There are 5 17mm bolts that hold the
flywheel to the crankshaft.  These bolts are torqued to 80 ft-lbs. and so 
you will either want an impact wrench to loosen them OR a nice length of 
angle iron.  What you do is re-insert two of the pressure plate bolts into
the flywheel a bit, then use them to brace the piece of angle iron (either
against the floor or a helper) -- this will keep the engine from turning
while you apply the necessary leverage to break the bolts loose.
<P>
Now remove the flywheel.  It is also held on by a dowel or two, so wiggle it
off of the crankshaft.  Now you are looking at the front of the crankshaft
and you can see the large oil seal.  You want to remove this seal.  You want
to pry it out of its bore, but be <B>VERY CAREFUL</B> not to gouge the sealing 
surface on the engine case, or it will leak -- and when this seal leaks oil,
it leaks a <B>LOT</B> of oil.  There is also a special tool for this job, a seal
puller.  You may want to rent one if you believe in using the proper tools
for the job.
<P>
Once the seal is out, make sure that the bore it sits in is clean and free
of crap.  Do <B>NOT</B> use any sealer on the new seal, simply press it into place
the same way that the old one came out.  
<P>
You also now want to remove and replace the pilot bearing.  This is the small
needle bearing in the front of the crankshaft.  You will need another special
tool to remove this bearing.  It's called a bearing puller and consists
of a hook that you stick through the bearing and hook on its other side, and
a rod with another rod that sticks out perpendicular to it.  You use this
second rod to bang a hammer on, which pops the bearing out.
<P>
The new one should be greased well with an all-purpose moly grease, then 
inserted into the hole in the crankshaft.  You can tap it in with a socket
that is the same size of the bearing and a hammer.  
<P>
Now you need to replace the throwout bearing, which is still sitting in the
transmission bellhousing.  On each side of the bearing there are spring
retainers which must be pried off.  Then there are two retaining clips that
must be pried off.  The bearing can then be removed from the release shaft
and guide sleeve.
<P>
To put the new bearing in, grease the guide sleeve (the sleeve the throwout
bearing rides on, over the input shaft) and the rotating face of the 
bearing.  Don't put too much on.  Then put the new bearing on the same way
you took the old one off.  Also take this opportunity to clean out the 
bellhousing and engine case if they are grungy.
<P>
Now you are ready to start assembling the clutch.  First clean the flywheel
very well with some kind of solvent -- the brake parts cleaner that comes in 
a spray can works well.  Do not touch the friction surface of the flywheel
with your oily/greasy fingers.  Re-install the flywheel.  It will only go
on one way due to the dowels.  Insert the five bolts and torque them to 
80 ft-lbs.  You will need to use the angle iron trick again to brace the 
engine from turning while you torque the bolts.  Tighten them in a crisscross
pattern, like lug nuts.
<P>
Now, clean your hands up <B>BEFORE</B> handling the clutch friction disc.  Any oil
or grease on it will foul it (like brake pads) and you could wind up with a 
chattering or slipping clutch.  Try not to touch the friction surface at all
even with clean hands.  Handle it by the outside edges or by the center.
Set it in its place on the flywheel.  Then install the new pressure plate.
Align it with the dowels, and then tighten the bolts evenly -- remember, you
are placing the plate under tension and you must do it evenly or you will
warp the pressure plate.  Go a half-turn at a time on the bolts.  Don't
tighten them all the way, though, as you still need to align the clutch 
disc.  Look through the hole at the center of the pressure plate.  You want
the hole in the pressure plate to align with the hole in the clutch disc and
that to align with the hole in the crankshaft so that you will be able to 
easily mate the engine and transmission later.  A clutch alignment tool 
is sold for this purpose or if you feel lucky you can eyeball it or even
use a broomstick end if you've got one around.  Once you've got it aligned
then go ahead and tighten the pressure plate bolts down <B>EVENLY</B>.  
<P>
Now your clutch is installed.  All that's left is to mate the engine and
transmission and put it all back in the car.
