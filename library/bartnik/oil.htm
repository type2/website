 <H2>Oil Change</H2>
 <P>
 <HR ALIGN=CENTER>
 <P>
 <B>APPLICATIONS:</B>  Type 1 and Type 4 engines (Beetle, Super Beetle, Bus, 
Karmann Ghia, Thing, 411, 412, air-cooled Vanagon). 
<P>



No tech page would be complete without the most basic part of all car
 maintanence, the oil change.  


Your oil should be changed
 every 3000 miles if you have a Type 1 engine and every 5000 miles is fine for the Type 4 engine, since it has an oil filter.
 <P>
 <CENTER><H3>TYPE 1 ENGINE</H3></CENTER>
 <P>
 The first step to an oil change is draining the old oil.  So, crawl
 under your car and see what you have.  Look at the bottom of the engine
 case, right in the center, and you will see a round metal plate.  This
 plate is held to the engine case with a number of very small nuts.  Your
 car may or may not have a large bolt in the middle of the plate.  If it
 does, you're lucky!  If not, you can buy one with the large bolt.  Basically,
 the large drain plug in the middle of the plate makes it easier to drain
 the oil.  Get your oil pan underneath the plate and if you have the
 center drain plug, undo it and let the oil drain into the pan.  If you
 don't have the center drain plug, undo the small nuts.  You'll get to a
 point where you've got most of the nuts off and oil has started to
 drain.  At this point, you might as well let the oil drain rather than
 covering yourself with oil trying to remove the remaining nuts.
 <P>
 Once the oil is drained, the next step is to completely remove the
 plate.  For those with the center drain plug, just undo the small nuts
 that hold the plate to the case.  For those without the center drain
 plug, undo your remaining nuts and remove the plate.
 <P>
 Once you have the plate off, the oil screen will probably fall out into
 your oil pan.  If not, sometimes it hangs up on the plate mounting
 studs, so reach up there and pull the oil screen out.  This screen is
 your engine's only method of filtering oil.  So, what you want to do is
 either clean your existing screen or be a big shot and spring the $2 for
 a new one.  The new one will come with the two gaskets you need.  If you
 simply reuse the old screen, you will need to buy the two gaskets.  Your
 best bet is to buy a new screen, which comes with the gaskets and the
 copper crush washers that go under the plate mounting nuts.  Since the
 copper crush washers cannot be reused, you will need to buy new ones
 anyway.  Reusing the crush washers can lead to stripping the threads in
 the nuts.  
 <P>
 OK, so at this point all the oil has drained and 
 you have the plate, acorn nuts, (center drain
 plug), and oil screen laying in front of you.  Clean any oil sludge off
 of the plate and clean up the sealing surfaces on the bottom of the
 engine case with a paper towel.  Get it clean so the new gaskets will
 keep your oil in where it belongs.
 <P>
 OK, now you're ready to put it back together.  Hold the oil screen up
 like it goes into the engine, then put one gasket over it on that side.
 Shove the whole works up into the engine where it goes, then put the
 other gasket on.  Then put the plate up there and start the acorn nuts
 (with new crush washers on each one) and the center drain plug (where
 applicable).  First tighten the acorn nuts, but not much at all.  The
 proper torque for these nuts is something ridiculously low, like 5 foot
 pounds.  If you tighten them any more, you're likely to either strip the
 nut or pull the stud out of the case.  So just tighten them snug and
 then a hair more with a wrench, but be gentle.  After you tighten them,
 then tighten the center drain plug and make that one fairly tight.
 <P>
 Now, crawl out of there and open up the oil fill cap under the
 generator/alternator.  Put in the recommended quantity of oil (check the
 owner's manual or Bentley) and the proper grade.  Whether you want to
 use synthetic oil is up to you, I won't bother with that tired debate
 here.  I wouldn't recommend synthetic for a Type 1 engine for the simple reason that since the engine has no oil filter, nor does it have a proper oil seal at the pulley end of the crankshaft, you will not be able to take advantage of synthetic's longer oil change intervals.  Therefore, you will still have to change the oil just as often. 
I would use 20W-50 weight conventional oil for most of the warmer
 climates and 10W-40 for the cooler areas.  I wouldn't go below that unless
 I lived somewhere where it gets really cold.  And in the super-hot
 areas, you may want straight 40W oil.  I used 20W-50 in my van in the
 summer (before I switched to synthetic) and
 10W-40 is good for the winter months.
 <P>
 If you have an oil bath air cleaner, now is the time to deal with
 that as well.  The oil in it has to be changed regularly and when better
 to do it than your oil change?  So, remove the air cleaner from the
 engine (usually a screw-clamp or two) and open it up.  Pour the old oil
 into your oil drain pan and wipe the air cleaner out.  Then put new
 fresh oil in up to the fill line in the air cleaner.  Note, this only
 applies if you have an oil bath air cleaner.  If you open your air
 cleaner and find a paper filter element, <B>DO NOT</B> under any circumstances
 add oil!  
 <P>
 And that's pretty much it for the oil change.  Note:  This assumes you
 have a bone-stock Type 1 engine.  You should also <A HREF="valveadj.htm">adjust your valves</A> every
 3000 miles, so you should do that at the same time you do your oil
 change.  
 <P>
 <CENTER><H3>TYPE 4 ENGINE</H3></CENTER>
 <P>
 The first step to an oil change is draining the old oil.  Crawl under
 your engine and locate the two possible oil drain locations.  One is a
 round metal plate held to the engine case with a 13mm nut in the center.
 The other is off to the side of the plate and is usually either a regular
 hex-head drain plug or an allen head drain plug.  That's the one you
 want to remove, if possible.  Sometimes the main drain plug is on too
 tight and then you have to remove the nut that holds the metal plate on.
 <P>
 If you can get the main drain plug out, do so and let the oil drain into
 your drain pan.  
 <P>
 If you have to get the plate out instead, simply undo the 13mm nut in
 the middle.  Sometimes it will fall out, sometimes you will have to coax
 the plate out.  At any rate, the plate hides an oil screen, much like
 the Type 1 engine, except it attaches differently.  You should probably
 remove the plate anyway, but it's easier and less messy if the oil has
 already drained.  When you get the screen out, clean it up and clean the
 plate up.  Kerosene is good, a paper towel is good too.  Just get all
 the crud off.  
 <P>
 Then move on to the oil filter.  You will see it on the driver's side of
 the engine (left), hanging straight down and in a tight spot.  You will
 probably need a cup-type oil filter wrench (available at FLAPS) if you
 can't get it off with your hands.  Tip:  while you're at the FLAPS
 buying the filter, find a cup-type wrench that will fit over the
 replacement filter and buy that.  I'd recommend using a replacement filter from either Mann, Knecht, or Mahle.  I'd avoid anything else.  Loosen the filter, with wrench
 or hands, and get the drain pan under it.  The filter holds about a half
 a quart of oil and there will be drips from the filter mount.  
 <P>
 Once all the oil has drained out, prep the new filter by opening one of
 your new oil bottles and sticking your finger in.  Get a little oil on
 your fingertip, and spread it around the rubber gasket on the filter.
 It helps make the seal.  Then wipe off the filter mount with a paper
 towel and screw the new filter on, hand tight only.  Do not use the
 filter wrench to tighten the filter.
 <P>
 Now, you can put the screen back in, preferably with new gaskets.  Put
 the whole assembly back in the way it came out, and then start the 13mm
 nut.  <B>WARNING:  DO NOT</B> overtighten the 13mm nut.  The torque spec. is 9
 ft-lbs.  <B>DO NOT</B> exceed this torque.  There is a big warning in the
 manual about how overtightening this nut can damage the camshaft.  So
 snug it up good, and then a bit beyond, but not much.  
 <P>
 Now you can also put the main drain plug back in, and feel free to tighten
 that one down a good bit.
 <P>
 OK, get out from underneath, open the oil fill cap and add the appropriate
 amount of your favorite brand/grade oil.  I'm using Mobil 1 synthetic 15W-50.  
 If you're going to use regular oil, 20W-50 is a good grade for most climates.  I think the spec is 3.7 quarts
 with filter change, but check the manual.  Again, if you have an oil
 bath air cleaner, now's the time to deal with it, so check the Type 1
 engine section for that information.  
 <P>
 <CENTER><H3>ALL MODELS</H3></CENTER>
 <P>
 Check the oil level on the dipstick.  It may seem high initially, but
 the oil needs time to settle, especially in the Type 4 engine, where
 about 1/2 a quart will stay in the oil filter after starting.  Start the
 engine and check for leaks and also check to make sure the oil pressure
 light goes out when it's supposed to.
 <P>
 That's it, you're done your oil change.  Take the old oil and put it in
 some kind of container, gallon milk jugs are good.  Then take it to your
 local oil recycling place.  Most FLAPS will take waste oil for
 recycling.
