<h3>Tire Inflation</h3>
<p>by Fred Stoermer</p>
<hr size="2">
<p><font size="+1">For 185 R 14 Reinforced _radials_ ('68 - '79
vehicles) the factory lists 30psi in front and 40psi in back,
except for "Delivery Van and Station Wagon from April 1972". For
these last they call for 30psi in front and 44psi in back. These
specs are for "Fully loaded" conditions.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I've found that the factory stickers on
individual buses sometimes specify 30 frt. and 42 rr., 28 frt. and
40 rr., or even 32 frt. and 44 rr., but 30 and 40 seem to be about
right.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">A great many people, not just Type 2 owners,
look at the max. inflation pressure on their tire sidewalls and
assume incorrectly that that is the proper running pressure. All
the tire manufacturers publish suggested inflation pressures for
various vehicles, tire sizes, etc., but they always refer to the
vehicle manufacturer's specs for the definitive
settings.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">In my experience the vast majority of Type 2
owners are running passenger tires on their buses. They find them
mushy and squirrely, so they jack the tire pressures way up in an
attempt to obtain some stability in handling, etc. Some who should
know better, including some "VW mechanics", suggest higher
inflations in front to make steering easier.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I know of one of these latter who ran 50psi on
all 4 corners of his Riviera camper for several years. He's now
recovering from major orthopedic surgery following a terrible crash
which might have been avoided if his bus had handled normally
during an evasive maneuver. The Riviera was totaled.....</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Passenger tires are not rated for inflation
pressures much over 30 or 35 psi, so overinflating them is
dangerous -- contributing to tread separation, blowouts, and rapid
wearout.</font></p>
