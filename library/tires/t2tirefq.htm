<h3>Type 2 Tires: Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
<p>by the Type2 Mailing List</p>
<hr size="2">
<p><font size="+1"><b>Summary of Tire Requirements for a Type
2:</b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">This is a conservative outline of how to choose
the best tires for your Type 2 based on factory recommendations.
Running tires that are insufficiently load rated, for a passenger
car, or too wide (especially on a heavier Type 2 camper) can lead
to problems such as: tread separation and blowouts, poor handling,
and premature steering component wear. Wider tires such as 205s
will fit under the wheel well, but might scrape the bodywork in
turns and will be more difficult to steer from a
standstill.</font></p>
<ul>
<li><font size="+1"><b>SIZE:</b> 185R14 (195 is also acceptible
providing they meet the other load and sidewall
requirements)</font></li>
<li><font size="+1"><b>LOAD RANGE:</b> "C" or "D" Light Truck (LT)
tires.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1"><b>MAXIMUM LOAD RATING:</b> 1500-1700 lbs
+</font></li>
<li><font size="+1"><b>MAXIMUM INFLATION PRESSURE:</b>
50-65psi.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1"><b>SIDEWALL:</b> Must have <i>reinforced
sidewall</i> (i.e. more than the standard one ply sidewall found on
a passenger car tire). Preferably 4 ply sidewall--this is the
critical factor for improved handling.</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font size="+1">Other considerations:</font></p>
<ul>
<li><font size="+1"><b>ALL SEASON:</b> M+S (mud and snow) rated,
all season (depends on your individual driving
conditions/climate/local laws)</font></li>
<li><font size="+1"><b>TREAD:</b> Preferably aggressive</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font size="+1"><b><u>An Example of an Ideal Tire Meeting All

-0700:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I got my new tires from The Tire Rack delivered
today. UPS left them on the front porch. Here is what they say on
them:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">YOKOHAMA RADIAL 370 STEEL BELTED M+S<br>
PLIES: SIDEWALL POLYESTER 2<br>
TREAD POLYESTER 2 + STEEL 2<br>
LT19575R14<br>
LOAD RANGE D<br>
MAX LOAD SINGLE 775KG (1710 LBS) AT 450 KPA (65 PSI) COLD<br>
MADE IN JAPAN<br>
Y370B<br></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The sticker also says 8PR LT on it, although the
tires don't say 8PR. I'm not sure how they get the 8 ply from the
above description.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The tread is much more aggressive than the Y356
tires I have now. These really look like mud and snow radials. I
expect to have a little rougher an noisier ride once they are
installed.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">No you won't find the Y370s on the Tire Rack
site. They do carry them. I just received mine last week. $58 ea,
plus $27 shipping. Make sure you speak with someone who knows what
these tires are. There is some confusion regarding these because
Yokohama makes a Y370G tire which is a passenger white
wall.</font></p>
<hr>
<p><font size="+1">From David Raistrick:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">As for what tires I WOULD recommend: Yokohama
370 LT195/75R14</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Sears can get them. Load D tire, mild allterrain
tread. I've put almost 35k on them since september when I bought
them. Rain, dry, dirt, mud, ice. No snow. Gravel
too...:)</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Love them. A little noisy, but easily
bearable.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">One note: Don't let anyone tell you to get the
185 or 195 Yokohama 356's. Why? They are highway rib tires, that do
not have sideways grooves to allow water out.....though they are
Load D tires.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">There are a few 195/75R14 or 185R14 tires
available, Bridgestone makes one, I know..in the Dueler line.
Decent tire also. You need a load C or load D tire, and you want an
all season radial, not a highway tire...:)</font></p>
<hr>
<p><font size="+1">From Stephen T Whetstone:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I'm not certain if these tires have been
discussed much before, but the tires I bought for my '78 Westfalia
were Continentals. I believe the models are Contact CS/CT21. They
have the 185r14 reinforced.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I ordered mine through Sears and believe I ended
up paying $304 (10% off sale) for four after
mounting/balancing/disposal/ taxes/etc. I've notice that handle
noticeably better than the previous Michelins that were on it when
I bought it. I believe the old tires were "XZX" &amp; ?</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I had originally seen a set on a Westie at one
of the BugOuts in Manassas, VA last year.</font></p>
<hr>
<p><font size="+1">From Jack Stafford:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I bought some new tires at my local FLATS.
Bridgestone RD603, 8-ply rating, Load Range D, Max load 1850lb @
65psi cold. $72 each, mounted and balanced. They are the stock
size, 185R14 so my snow chains will still fit them. End of tire
testimonial...</font></p>
<hr>
<p><font size="+1">From William Warburton:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">As far as choosing good tyres is concerned my
recommendations (and those of other listees) would be to look
for:</font></p>
<ol>
<li><font size="+1">an "LT" designation, with "Load range C" or
"Load range D".</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">the "C" suffix on the tyre designation- ie
185R14C _not_ 185R14</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">A maximum inflation pressure of 50-60psi. not
40psi</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">A maximum weight rating of over
1500lbs.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font size="+1">Although I am talking only about 185R14 sized
tyres you should be aware that VW specified 195R14 as a valid
alternative, so you can use those, too. It's perfectly possible to
go with some other sizes- 195/75R14, for example, or possibly
215/70R14, however you are then diverting sufficiently far from
stock that you should make sure you understand the implications of
the size, speed and weight ratings, sidewall stiffness and tread
design before going ahead- unfortunately you can't trust the
tyre-people to do this right as they often don't have the knowledge
and experience to know what works well on a bus. The weight ratings
of "Passenger car" tyres are different from those of "Light Truck"
tyres- hence the preference for the "LT"s If you're looking at
passenger car tyres then you might find it useful to know that VW
specified a load index of 97R to be appropriate for a vanagon.
That's a weight rating of 1609lbs at a maximum of 106mph, if memory
serves. Most arn't this high- 92 or 94 is more common.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">George Lyle on Sat Jan 10 12:52:42 1998
responds:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">My recent tire follies have shown that there is
a big difference between the rated load of 185R14 and 195/75R14
tires, with the _185R14_ having the higher load rating. (yes, I
typed that correctly). The 195/75R14 tires were slightly smaller in
all dimensions (except tread width, which was equal) than the
185R14.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">My standard-load 185R14 tires are rated at 1450
pounds at 36PSI</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Load range C 185R14 tires are rated at over 1700
pounds (don't remember the exact number) at 50PSI.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The load range C 195/75R14LT tires I bought were
only rated at 1435 pounds at 50PSI! Note that this is _less_ than
the standard load 185R14 tires. Very disappointing!</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The specified tire load rating for my '71
station wagon is 1520 pounds at 40PSI.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Seems that if you want to use tires of the
proper capacity for a bus, you need to get either 185R14 load range
C, or 195/75R14 load range D, with the former size being closer to
the original 700-14 specification.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I've seen the 185R14 in a Hercules brand for a
reasonable price, but the load range C version of that tire isn't
rated M+S. Darn!</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Two more considerations:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Bus steering boxes are pretty fragile and
expensive. Wider-than-stock tires (and they're all wider than stock
nowadays!) put more stress on the steering box than the originals.
There's no cure for this other than making sure that you are
rolling a bit before cranking the wheels around.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Tire chain clearance is limited. Both the
185R14s and 195/75R14 have sufficient clearance on my bus if you
are careful to install the chains (limited clearance type)
carefully. I avoid chains like the plague, but if I have to use
them I don't want to destroy anything!</font></p>
<hr>
<p><font size="+1">From Roy D. Robertson on Fri Jul 11 10:11:32
1997:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">A number (too many) threads in the archives
discuss tires. But which tires to buy is a big decision - I've
regretted not buying the best tires for my bus before, so here's my
advice on the subject again:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">A VW bus, particularly a Westy, needs
reinforced-sidewall tires. VW recommends 185R14 tires. P-rated
tires, such as P185/14, are passenger tires and not rated for the
heavier loads/sidewinds buses experience. Reinforced-sidewall tires
help keep the bus in its lane on the highway instead of being blown
about so. A bus, and especially a Westy, has a higher carrying
capacity than most cars, and needs more heavy-duty tires to take
full advantage of this capacity.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Their selection is much larger and their prices
much lower than what you can usually find locally. I bought four
Yokohama Y370LT195/75R14 tires from them a few months ago. They
cost $58 each, plus UPS ground shipping.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">These tires seem to be perfect match for my VW
bus. They have an all-weather tread design that gives good traction
on dirt roads, while preserving a smooth ride on the highway. Being
stronger tires than P-rated radials, the maximum air pressure for
these is 65 psi. I keep mine inflated to about 52 psi rear, 40 psi
front. I think that the decreased rolling resistance provided by
the extra inflation pressure gives the bus something like 1~2 mpg
better fuel economy than with P-rated tires. The 195/75 tires are
slightly taller than 185 tires, providing a little more clearance
on rough roads and slightly higher over-all drive (gearing)
ratio.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">The gross weight of the camper and station wagon
is the same, so the tire requirement (at least from the factory) is
the same. You can get by with lesser tires in a station wagon as
the empty weight is a lot less than a camper and you usually don't
get fully loaded. I don't recommend this...</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">VW requires a load rating of 1400 pounds. I'm
pretty sure that the 185R14 "C" tire will handle this. A "D" rated
tire is up around 1700+ pounds so it will handle a bus
easily.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">With most of these tires you will get 2
polyester plies in both the sidewall and tread (they wrap all the
way around) and two steel plies in the tread area only. Standard
load tires will have only one sidewall ply. The "ply rating" is a
marketing gimmick that does not state the actual number of plies.
For example, my Bridgestones are "8-ply rated", but only have four
plies in the tread and two in the sidewall. I suppose that this is
probably as strong or stronger than the original rayon-carcass
bias-ply tires that the bus came with.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The real story is in the fine print on the
sidewall that tells you the actual load rating in pounds. If the
number is 1400 pounds or greater, you're cool.</font></p>

-0400:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I've read several posts about tires recently,
and it seems that many tire shops are trying to talk Bus/Westy
owners into some nice in stock passenger car tires. I suggest if
they do this, insist on the correct tire, or go somewhere else. At
least the Firestone guy was on the right track. My 8ply tires are
rated at 1850 lbs. My Buses rear end weighs 2800 lbs, and the Bus
weighs 4961 lbs empty. If I add all of my gear, and five passengers
then I'm getting close to 6000 lbs total weight, thats 1500 lbs per
tire. I don't think that the 8 ply tires are too much tire at
all.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">When I purchased my '74 Campmobile, it had
passenger car tires on it. I immediately put on the Yokohama 356s
and there was a major improvement in handling.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">If you can still get the 6 ply Yokohama or
Michelins, then thats what I would do. If you can't find these and
8 ply Firestones are available, then I would go for it.</font></p>

1997:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I know that it's probably blasphemous to say it,
but I get along very nicely with Hercules YP-821 4-ply-rated 185R14
standard-load tires (also sold under the brand names of Merit,
Jupiter, etc.) Their load rating is 1450 pounds which gives me a
comfortable margin even fully loaded (which is seldom). Their
treadwear rating is 300, traction rating is A, Temperature B (which
doesn't matter at bus speeds). The bus handles well with them and
they cost a bit over $200 for four, mounted and balanced. One very
nice thing that I have noted is that these tires don't tend to wear
on the edges as did other tires (including expensive ones) I have
tried.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">After fighting one bad steering box in my '71, I
wouldn't put anything wider than a 185 on my bus. Even then, I
never turn the wheels with the bus stationary, since modern radials
require more effort to turn at rest than the original bias tires.
Forget the 205s!</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Other tips:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">If you haven't yet done so, install metal
screw-in valve stems. One less thing to worry about.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">If your rims need painting, the best time to do
it is when changing tires, since you don't have to mask the
tire.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Don't let the tire folks install the lug nuts
with an air wrench. They should torque them by hand if you ask
nicely.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Some tire stores attempt to balance the wheels
with weights on the inside of the rim only for aesthetic reasons.
If that's your thing, fine, but they can do a better job if they
put weights on both the inside and outside.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">From William Warburton (on non-stock rims and
tire profiles):</font></p>
<blockquote><font size="+1"><i>... I have ... decided instead to
source out a new set of alloy wheel rims and lower profile tyres,
thus, achieving the same effect, or nearly, and the desired
look.</i></font></blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Which effect? Lower profile tyre should reduce
sidewall squish in a turn but will not lower the centre of gravity
unless you reduce the overall size of the wheel+tyre quite a bit.
This will obviously impact gear ratio (at the rear) and speedometer
accuracy (at the front).</font></p>
<blockquote><font size="+1"><i>Well, how low.....and how wide ? Are
there limits ?e.g.: 16 " wide rims with Pirelli P6's ?...and does
this mess with your speedo ?</i></font></blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">If you look at the way-kewl kustom buses, they
run some very low profile rubber. This looks flash but the general
concensus seems to be that it doesn't work too well for driving...
and driving busses is what this list is all about.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The main issues are (1) The bus steering box is
quite fragile. Low profile tyres and fat rubber increase the strain
and lead to premature wear. (2) Ultra-low profile tyres just don't
work that well on busses. I don't have a good explanation of why
this is the case but it seems pretty widely accepted. My guess is
that the combination of high centre of gravity and unsophisticated
suspension mean you just don't get the benefits you might expect
and have to live with tough parking, tramlining, aquaplaning, poor
ride etc. Couple this with the fact that fat tyres decrease wet
weather grip and it looks like it's best not to go too far, unless
you tow your bus to the showground.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">As far as speedometer accuracy is concerned, you
just need to ensure that the overall diameter of the front
wheel+tyre remains the same. This is known as "plus sizing": "+1"
is a 1" increase in wheel diameter coupled with a 1/2" decrease in
tyre sidewall height (there are two sidewalls per diameter), "+2"
goes up two inches on the wheel (14"-&gt;16") and decreases the
sidewall height by 1" etc.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">If you want to make a modest change, you can go
to a +1 setup with a 15" wheel and run 195/70R15C tyres. This
reduces the sidewall height a little and gives you a slightly
fatter tyre. The same wheels could be used with wider, lower
profile tyres, too: 205/65R15 is the same size. The next width
isn't as neat: 215/60R15 is a bit smaller than stock and 215/65R15
a bit larger. I havn't researched the options for 16" wheels, but
the same principles apply. There's a good bit of info in the
archives (check the vanagon ones, too) on the topic.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The final, and important, point is that bus
tyres need to be substantially stronger that car tyres. This is
particularly true if you actually want better handling. Most low
profile tyres are designed for lightweight, sporty cars (this may
be less of a problem in the USA than in Europe, mind you) and won't
have adequate load carrying capacity for a bus.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">You need a weight capacity of over 1500lbs for
safety, and more than that for a good stiff sidewall. Tyres have a
load index on the sidewall and for a bus you want something like
97S (730kg/1609lbs) or better (good van tyres are often 100 or
more). The letter is the speed rating (S=up to 113mph) and
generally isn't an issue for a bus :-). Eurovans use a 195/70R15C
tyre, they will be strong and relatively cheap. Once you get over
195-section most of the tyres available in adequate weight ratings
(look for "reinforced" tyres) are for big, powerful saloons/estates
and they get a lot more expensive. You're typically paying for a
140mph speed rating you don't need.</font></p>
<blockquote><font size="+1"><i>Also, will any 5-stud wheel
fit......can anyone suggest a happy and attractive combination
?</i></font></blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">There are a few possibilities, though none seem
to be perfect. <b>You need a wheel with a 5-stud pcd (Pitch circle
diameter) of 112mm.</b> This matches a few fords, some Mercedes and
some of the bigger Audi and VW saloons. You can also get adapters
to fit Porsche wheels to a bus- some folks say that adapters are
always a bad idea. Others that good adapters are OK, and the Fuchs
wheels are so good (strong, light) that the combination is
worthwhile. Genuine Fuchs wheels are expensive, copies are
dangerous.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Unfortunately you also need to get the
relationship between the tyre centreline and the hub correct.
<b>For a bus the "offset" is 41mm.</b> Some of the Mercedes wheels
are correct. Some are close (I don't know how close it needs to be)
and I don't know about the others.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Finally, few of these cars have a hub that's as
big as a bus and the profile of the lugnut seat needs to match.
Depending on your situation, you might be best to work out how big
you want to go, check you can get tyres to match and then hunt
around some breakers yards for wheels that fit. Check the offset
carefully before trying them and then make sure you can fit them
OK.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">You can, of course, buy new alloys from an
aftermarket wheel supplier. If you go this route I would not trust
the fitter to know what they are doing with a bus: even if they've
fitted alloys to a bus before it was probably for someone who
wanted them for show use not driving.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Finally, the steel rims that VW used are
actually pretty good. They are lighter than many cheap alloys and
lightness is a good thing in a wheel (unsprung weight).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I hope this is helpful, sorry it's so long but I
still feel I've left out a lot of important
detail!!!<br></font></p>
