I've posted this many times.  This is the results of my tire size research:
<p>
European sized metric tires, such as a 185SR14 for example, do not have an
80% aspect ratio, but 82% or 83% (I forget which, but I think it's 82%).
This changes things just a bit.  I've added the Euro spec tires to the list
of acceptable 14" and 15" sizes for buses.

Bentley says that the <strong>3/4 ton</strong> (small nut) models came
with a 6.40-15 tire,
having a diameter of 27.16", +/- .24".
<p>
This makes the nearest European radial tire size a 185R15, and the nearest
P-Metric size a 205/75-15.

How about running 14" wheels on a 3/4 ton (small nut) bus?

Good luck getting most of these on the back.  I've gotten some big tires on
the back of an old bus by letting the air out while wedging the tire
between the drum and the body lip, and then refilling it after getting the
wheel bolted up.

<strong>One ton</strong> (big nut) models came with 7.00-14 tires, having
a diameter of 26.22", +/- .24".
<p>
This makes the nearest radial tire size a 195R14, and the nearest commonly
available P-Metric a 205/75-14.

How about running 15" wheels on a one ton (big nut) bus?

If you're thinking of using a tire size not listed here, try
the tire size calculator at
