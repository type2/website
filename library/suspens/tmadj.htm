<h3>Rear Torsion Bar Measurement and Adjustment</h3>
<p>by George Lyle</p>
<hr size="2">
<p><font size="+1">I don't recommend you try to correct sag by
cranking in a "compensating" amount of twist [of the spring
plate/torsion bar]. The relationship between arm position and body
position isn't linear. I tried it and ended up too high!</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">This is the method I use for adjustment. I use a
dime-store protractor with a piece of thread through its center
hole and a nut to hold the thread vertical. It reads to 1/2 degree,
which is less than the tolerance for the arm position.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I get the floor of the bus level front-to-rear
(saves calculations) and then use the protractor to measure the
angle of the plate. I hold the flat side of the protractor against
the bottom of the spring plate and push the spring plate up a bit
to take the play out of the splines. The difference between the
protractor reading and 90 is the spring plate angle. Note that the
angle is different for different models of bus, so be sure to use
the right specs. I get mine from Bentley. If you turn the inside
spline one tooth and the outside spline one tooth in the other
direction you will get a difference of 2/3 degree, which is fine
enough to get the arm into spec.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Don't be tempted to crank in a little extra
twist. Handling, CV life, and tire life will suffer.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Be aware that if your loaf is properly adjusted,
you _won't_ be able to see the horizon through the back window.
This kind of surprised me, but that's the way it is!</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">If you work carefully and use the correct
numbers you have a good chance of doing it only once!</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Remember to douse all the fasteners in Liquid
Wrench the day before you do this!</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">There are 44 splines on the inner end and moving
one spline changes the plate angle 8.18 degrees.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">There are 40 splines on the outer end and moving
one spline changes the plate angle 9.00 degrees.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Neither of these is the "fine tuning". The two
used _together_ is the way that you adjust the angle. If you turn
one end one spline and the other end one spline in the opposite
direction you will get an angle change of 0.82 degrees, which is
the tolerance allowed for the spring plate angle. Thus, there is
always one setting that will get the torsion arm into the correct
angular range. You measure the current angle of the spring plate,
find the difference between that angle and the desired angle,
divide the difference by 0.83, round to the nearest integer, turn
the torsion bar in the inner spline by that number of notches
_opposite_ the desired direction, and move the spring plate on the
outer spline by that number of notches _in_ the desired direction.
Check the measurement and you're done!</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">If you try to adjust the angle by just turning
the outer spline, you will end up with the rear end way too high,
like against the upper stop. The bus will handle very strangely,
will have horrible rear tire wear, will ride very roughly as the
suspension tops out, and will damage the CVs and boots.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">A simple $0.50 protractor works great. It's
simple, accurate to 0.5 degree, and you can get one just about
anywhere. You can set the bars right the first time.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">A list member suggests:</font></p>
<pre><font size="+1">
&gt; There are four bolts that hold 
&gt; the torsion housing covers on.  And...an old-timer clued me in on this. 
&gt; On the actual resetting of the splines on the outer end of the torsion 
&gt; bar with the splines on the inside of the spring plate, you can line up 
&gt; the bottom of the springplate (is a straight edge) to intersect the 
&gt; bottom front bolt hole for the spring plate covers.
</font></pre>
<p><font size="+1">This procedure works great, if you drive a bug!
It's a dune-buggy folk trick for setting the springs a bit stiffer
on a Baja bug. Unfortunately, buses have different settings than
the bug, and different models of buses (deluxe, campmobile, etc.)
have different spring plate setting angles.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I've had no problem with doing it by following
the procedure in the Bentley manual. The only deviation I make is
to level the bus front-to-rear before I begin, rather than adding
and subracting the deck angle as Bentley recommends.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">If it's so easy to do it right, why do it any
other way?</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The easiest way to check your bus is to park it
on a level surface, open the sliding door, put a carpenter's level
on the door sill, put a driver in the driver's seat, and read the
level. If it is close to level your suspension is fine. (I'm
assuming that you have equal-sized tires all around, of course!)
Buses normally sit a bit nose-high without a driver in the driver's
seat.</font></p>
<pre><font size="+1">
&gt; I'd check my 73 for you, but I imagine my rear end would be comparable
&gt; to yours (ie. sagging a BUNCH).  Do you get tired of not being able to
&gt; see cars behind you in your rear-view mirror?  Sounds like its time to
</font></pre>
<p><font size="+1">Be very careful using the rear-view as an
indication. In a properly-adjusted bus you _cannot_ see the horizon
in the inside rear-view mirrors. The mirror is positioned higher
than the upper edge of the rear window. I assumed that my bus was
sacked out because I couldn't see the horizon and wasted quite a
bit of time. If you adjust the bars too high you will end up with
strange handling, rapid tire wear, and CV joint/boot
damage.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I'd strongly suggest that you stick with the
standard spring plate settings. There is always the temptation to
"crank in a bit more", but, in my experience, it never works well.
Be sure to hold the spring plate up while measuring to take slack
out of the splines.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">In order to correctly set the torsion bars, you
_must_ adjust both ends of the bar. The tolerance is only 50
minutes of arc (5/6 degree), and the only way to have the plate
fall within this tolerance is to use the differing number of
splines make the fine adjustment. If you use only the outer
splines, you get an adjustment of 8.2 degrees per
spline!</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">This job isn't hard to do, but it does take some
thought and planning in order to have it come out right.</font></p>
