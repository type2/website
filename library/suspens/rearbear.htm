<h3>Rear Wheel Bearing Replacement</h3>
<p>by Chris Chubb</p>
<hr size="2">
<p><font size="+1">First a peeve: Whoever the junior engineer was
that wrote up the rear wheel bearing procedure for the Bentley for
the '68-72 Busses never came within 500 yards of a rear wheel
bearing. Don't believe anything you read about the rear bearing in
there.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">That said, down to the correct
procedure.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I just tore both rear wheel bearing carriers off
of my '71 bus, and this is the real procedure:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">1) Mark the diagonal bar, trailing arm and
bearing carrier with a cold chisel, so that you can align
everything up after the changeover. Mark top and bottom.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">2) Remove the shock, brake hose, castellated
nut, lug nuts, brake hardware, CV, etc. in the most appropriate
order.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">3) Remove the wheel bearing carrier, that
monster assemblage of steel and the brake backing plate, together.
Take into your workshop or other clean area.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">4) Push the axle stub out the center. Use a
block of wood to assist if needed.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">[Here is where the Bentley manual diverges
greatly...]</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">5) Put the roller bearing inside race in a
plastic sandwich bag. Bentley shows the roller bearing having the
rollers come out with the center, like the front hub. They really
stay with the outer race.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">6) Remove the brake backing plate. The Bentley
shows the little stud behind the adjusting stars as staying in the
bearing housing. It really stays in the brake backing plate. Drift
it out from the other side.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">7) Use a seal remover to remove the grease
seals. Toss em in the trash.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">8) Here is hard part #1. Remove the circlip from
the 'back' (inner side) of the bearing housing. It is strong, and I
bent two sets of circlip pliers, including some $29 Snap-Ons before
I resorted to prying and chiseling it out. (Bending those pliers
put me in a bad mood, I had to take a breather for some hot
chocolate.) Bentley says in three places that there are two
circlips, one on each side. The diagram only shows one, but other
things are wrong on there, too.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">9) Here is hard part #2. You have to push the
spacer to the side because it wont come out until the ball bearing
comes out of the 'back' side. Bentley says it will fall right out,
but it wont. I pushed the spacer to the side, reached a screwdriver
down the side and drifted it out a little bit at a time, working
the screwdriver around and around. Hint: Use a 3 lb sledge instead
of a lightweight hammer for drifting bearing races. You should not
use a steel screwdriver when installing the bearings, you will
scratch the bearings and screw them up.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">10) When the ball bearing comes out, pull out
the spacer and put it in your plastic baggie.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">11) Drift the roller bearing out the 'front' of
the bearing housing with a broad bronze drift.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Cheapskate note: $8 is waaay too much for a
brass drift. Get some monster aluminum nails (gutter spikes) and
cut the pointy ends off. They are about $.30 each, and you can cut
the end off about 6-7 times as they mushroom.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">12) Installation is the reverse of removal. (No
other 6 words in the English language strike so much fear into a
mechanics heart.) Actually, that was this mornings work.
Installation will come after much cleaning, painting, greasing,
etc. )<br></font></p>
