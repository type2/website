<h3>Rear Wheel Bearing Replacement

First a peeve: Whoever the junior engineer was that



wrote up the rear wheel bearing procedure for



the Bentley for the '68-72 Busses never came 



within 500 yards of a rear wheel bearing. Don't



believe anything you read about the rear bearing



in there. 







<p>That said, down to the correct procedure.







<p>I just tore both rear wheel bearing carriers off



of my '71 bus, and this is the real procedure:







<p>1) Mark the diagonal bar, trailing arm and bearing carrier



with a cold chisel, so that you can align everything up 



after the changeover. Mark top and bottom.







<p>2) Remove the shock, brake hose, castellated nut, lug



nuts, brake hardware, CV, etc. in the most appropriate order.







<p>3) Remove the wheel bearing carrier, that monster assemblage



of steel and the brake backing plate, together. Take into



your workshop or other clean area.







<p>4) Push the axle stub out the center. Use a block of wood



to assist if needed. 







<p>[Here is where the Bentley manual diverges greatly...]







<p>5) Put the roller bearing inside race in a plastic sandwich



bag. Bentley shows the roller bearing having the rollers



come out with the center, like the front hub. They really stay with



the outer race.







<p>6) Remove the brake backing plate. The Bentley shows the little



stud behind the adjusting stars as staying in the bearing housing.



It really stays in the brake backing plate. Drift it out



from the other side.







<p>7) Use a seal remover to remove the grease seals. Toss em in 



the trash. 







<p>8) Here is hard part #1. Remove the circlip from the 'back' (inner



side) of the bearing housing. It is strong, and I bent two sets



of circlip pliers, including some $29 Snap-Ons before I resorted



to prying and chiseling it out. (Bending those pliers put me 



in a bad mood, I had to take a breather for some hot chocolate.)



Bentley says in three places that there are two circlips, 



one on each side. The diagram only shows one, but other things



are wrong on there, too.







<p>9) Here is hard part #2. You have to push the spacer to the side



because it wont come out until the ball bearing comes out of



the 'back' side. Bentley says it will fall right out, but it



wont. I pushed the spacer to the side, reached a screwdriver down



the side and drifted it out a little bit at a time, working the



screwdriver around and around. Hint: Use a 3 lb sledge instead



of a lightweight hammer for drifting bearing races. You should



not use a steel screwdriver when installing the bearings, you



will scratch the bearings and screw them up. 







<p>10) When the ball bearing comes out, pull out the spacer and



put it in your plastic baggie.







<p>11) Drift the roller bearing out the 'front' of the bearing 



housing with a broad bronze drift.







<p>Cheapskate note: $8 is waaay too much for a brass drift. 



Get some monster aluminum nails (gutter spikes) and cut



the pointy ends off. They are about $.30 each, and you can



cut the end off about 6-7 times as they mushroom.







<p>12) Installation is the reverse of removal.



(No other 6 words in the English language strike



so much fear into a mechanics heart.)



Actually, that was this mornings work. Installation



will come after much cleaning, painting, 



greasing, etc. )
