When I was just a wee pup I worked part time for a *very* conciencious VW
mechanic..."Eat off the floor" kind of shop..would reject flywheel shims with
a scratch on them.....Mr. Safety had rubber gloves, dust masks, safety glasses
on everyone. would repair "safety items" on customer cars for free rather than
ignore them..
<P>
Anyway, bug and bus ball joints....pull the arm, heat the area around the
joint to a dull red, support the arm with the joint over the edge of a press
plate or heavy table and beat the joint out just like *that*!!...Yes, I said
heat....I went pie-eye when Pete did this the first time..."Bbbbbbbbb the book
says!!!!......"
<P>
"Yes, I know," he replied..."But the book can't get the joint out of the
control arm..."
<P>
He's still in business after 30+ years, *still* has a dedicated clientele and
has yet to have a failure of the arm or joint from this......
I've replaced them this way myself..I once made a tool, used a 30 ton
press...and cracked an arm..tossed the tool out and got the torch......
Dull red and hit it like you *MEAN* it...."plonk"..on the floor..every
time.....

I'd second this procedure. I've changed quite a few and see no harm in
WARMING (dull red) the arm. I see no reason to remove the arms unless
one is changing the beam cause of rust. I've never seen those bearings
or seals fail, but most of the cars I've worked on were well on their
way to death by rust and none over 200k miles. So I suppose extreme high 
mile cars might need more work. 
<P>
I own a TRW ball joint press ( came as a
promotion with 20 ball joints back in the 70's). It may be available
under other brand names or as a rental. It works okay for type 2 ball
joints. I also never use a pickle fork type remover for tie rod ends or
ball joint studs in the knuckles. I just whack the knuckle with a 2 lb.
hammer perpendicular to the stud. First, put on heavy gloves in case your
hand dashes against the knuckle. Works every time after a couple blows,
never damages the seals. The books certainly don't recommend doing it
this way, but my homespun self-taught engineering education tells me
that I'm not going to seriously deform a hole in 5/8-7/8 section of
HEAT-TREATED steel without laying it on the railroad tracks. Even if
such a procedure did oval the stud holes in the knuckle slightly, what
difference does it make- the stud will straighten it out when it pulls
in. 
<P>
The procedures in many books are wrong, even Bently. My brother owns a
German car shop in Omaha, one of his favorite sayings is "The difference
between an amatuer mechanic and a professional is that the professional 
knows which bolts to leave out." Not that he leaves out many bolts, but
after a few years of experience the pro realizes what's important and
what's not.
<P>
So I think putting 4 ball joints in a bus is a nice job for a morning or
an afternoon and if I could get $350 per job I'd probably quit my day
job. You should probably have the shop put in new swing arm bushings
while it's there, if it needs it.
