<h3>Ball Joint Removal from Torsion Arm</h3>

<p><font size="+1">When I was just a wee pup I worked part time for
a *very* conciencious VW mechanic..."Eat off the floor" kind of
shop..would reject flywheel shims with a scratch on them.....Mr.
Safety had rubber gloves, dust masks, safety glasses on everyone.
would repair "safety items" on customer cars for free rather than
ignore them..</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Anyway, bug and bus ball joints....pull the arm,
heat the area around the joint to a dull red, support the arm with
the joint over the edge of a press plate or heavy table and beat
the joint out just like *that*!!...Yes, I said heat....I went
pie-eye when Pete did this the first time..."Bbbbbbbbb the book
says!!!!......"</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">"Yes, I know," he replied..."But the book can't
get the joint out of the control arm..."</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">He's still in business after 30+ years, *still*
has a dedicated clientele and has yet to have a failure of the arm
or joint from this...... I've replaced them this way myself..I once
made a tool, used a 30 ton press...and cracked an arm..tossed the
tool out and got the torch...... Dull red and hit it like you
*MEAN* it...."plonk"..on the floor..every time.....</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Al Brase responds:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I'd second this procedure. I've changed quite a
few and see no harm in WARMING (dull red) the arm. I see no reason
to remove the arms unless one is changing the beam cause of rust.
I've never seen those bearings or seals fail, but most of the cars
I've worked on were well on their way to death by rust and none
over 200k miles. So I suppose extreme high mile cars might need
more work.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I own a TRW ball joint press ( came as a
promotion with 20 ball joints back in the 70's). It may be
available under other brand names or as a rental. It works okay for
type 2 ball joints. I also never use a pickle fork type remover for
tie rod ends or ball joint studs in the knuckles. I just whack the
knuckle with a 2 lb. hammer perpendicular to the stud. First, put
on heavy gloves in case your hand dashes against the knuckle. Works
every time after a couple blows, never damages the seals. The books
certainly don't recommend doing it this way, but my homespun
self-taught engineering education tells me that I'm not going to
seriously deform a hole in 5/8-7/8 section of HEAT-TREATED steel
without laying it on the railroad tracks. Even if such a procedure
did oval the stud holes in the knuckle slightly, what difference
does it make- the stud will straighten it out when it pulls
in.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The procedures in many books are wrong, even
Bently. My brother owns a German car shop in Omaha, one of his
favorite sayings is "The difference between an amatuer mechanic and
a professional is that the professional knows which bolts to leave
out." Not that he leaves out many bolts, but after a few years of
experience the pro realizes what's important and what's
not.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">So I think putting 4 ball joints in a bus is a
nice job for a morning or an afternoon and if I could get $350 per
job I'd probably quit my day job. You should probably have the shop
put in new swing arm bushings while it's there, if it needs
it.</font></p>
