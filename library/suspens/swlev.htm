<p><font size="+1">The kits are pretty simple, consisting of two
bushings, the hinge pin, and a new bottom cap.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I did my '71 so long ago that I can't recall the
source of the parts. It might have been the local FLVWPS. The parts
were German, but not in a "VW" marked box.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The one big tip I have is to avoid hammering the
bushings out. It's a real pain and there is a very real possibility
of damaging something.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">You do need a tool to press them in and out. I
made one from a few heavy washers, a deep socket (large enough for
the bushing to fit inside), and a 1-foot length of 3/8 all-thread.
You grind a washer to be slightly smaller than the ID of the
bushing. Remove the bottom cap and pivot pin. Place the washer on
top of the upper bushing. Thread the all-thread, through the deep
socket, up through the beam and through the washer. Secure this
with a nut. The lower end of the rod has two nuts jammed together
and a single nut that you will use to pull out the bushings. You
hold the jammed nut with a wrench, and use another wrench to
tighten the loose nut. This pulls the top washer slowly through the
beam, pulling the bushings ahead of it.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Works much better than a hammer!</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I read a lot about reaming the bushings to fit,
but mine didn't need reaming at all. Might be an early bus
thing.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The new bottom cap was impossible to press into
place. I could have made it fit with a little fileing around the
edges, but the old one was still perfect so I put it in
instead.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I grease the swing lever and the torsion bars
every other oil change. this is probably too often but grease is
cheaper than repairs.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">George's method should work pretty well. I
personally had a problem with the force that was necessary with
using the all thread the way I had it set up.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Another way (sort of the same):</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I decided to use a C clamp, a socket whose OD is
almost the same as the bushing but just less than the ID of the
housing, a piece of flat bar (3" long and 1/4" thick roughly) and a
piece of PVC coupling (I think 2.5" in diameter ~ 2"
long).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">You will need to disconnect the E-brake directly
above the center pin. You will also need to move the drag link and
relay arm out of the way (bigger pain than it sounds - good time to
replace the drag link as well since you may ruin the boots removing
the piece) and remove the grease nipple for the center pin. Read
the Bentley or Haynes account on clamping the center pin when you
loosen it due to a spring washer in the assembly.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Put the C clamp in position w/ the threaded end
toward the ground. Place the flat bar on top of the hole for the
center pin (The top bushing extends ~ 0.05 inches above the surface
of the hole - but you do not need to worry about displacing it
downward since you will be removing it anyway) put the stationary
end of the C clamp on top of the flat bar. Now, on the bottom side,
put the socket in position under the bottom bushing. The bottom
bushing is flush w/ the lip so you need to be really careful and
not let the socket get skewed. Keep an eye on it while you start to
turn the C clamp. The center pin is not perfectly vertical. The top
of the pin is leaned slightly to the back of the bus. Keep this in
mind when you are lining up the C clamp. You may need to
periodically loosen the clamp and re-tighten. keep rotating the
clamp until you feel resistance. Now the bottom bushing has
contacted the top bushing. Put the PVC coupler in the place of the
flat bar, and then put the flat bar on top of the PVC. The cavity
created by the PVC coupler allows room for the bushing to push out.
At any time you can put another socket into the center pin hole to
reduce the length of the C clamp thread that is extended. Once the
top bushing pops out, loosen everything and remove it so the bottom
bushing can pop out as well.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Clean all the old grease out of the center pin
hole and regrease the area - allows the bushings to slide in
easier. Grease the outside of the bushings also.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Put the Bottom bushing in first! This bushing
goes flush w/ the hole. The top bushing protudes ~0.05" to prevent
the relay arm from scraping the beam (so says Bentley). You want to
put the bottom in first so that you can use the surface to push in
the top bushing.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Place the C clamp in position w/ the flat bar
across the top of the hole and the bottom bushing lined up w/ a
thin piece of wood between the bushing and the C clamp. Exert a
little pressure, watch the bushing, then slacken the clamp. Check
for correct bushing alignment. Then re-exert some pressure.
Remember, the pin isn't perfectly vertical, so the bushings won't
be either. Once you get the bushing going, it will slide right into
position. Put the bar on the bottom and the bushing on top and
repeat. Get a feeler gauge for 0.045 to 0.05 and do not allow the
bushing to go lower than that.</font></p>
