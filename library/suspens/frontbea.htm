<h3>Front Axle Beam Replacement</h3>
<p>by H Steve Dolan</p>
<hr size="2">
<p><font size="+1">There is nothing technically difficult about
removing and replacing the beam on a breadloaf, the only problems
are that it is *HEAVY* and that a number of things run *thru* the
beam. The following is from my experience replacing the beam on my
old '78, filled in with the memory of stripping the '79. Because I
was doing a complete front end overhaul on my old '78 at the time,
I did some things that you may not want/have to do, but this it my
story, and I'm sticking to it :-).</font></p>
<font size="+1"><br></font>
<center><font size="+1">CLEARING THE WAY</font></center>
<font size="+1"><br>
Before removing the old beam, you will need to clear the following
from it:</font>
<p><font size="+1">the shift rod;<br>
the clutch cable;<br>
the booster and MC;<br>
the parking brake cable;<br>
the brake calipers;<br>
the drag link;<br>
the speedo cable.<br></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">To remove the shift rod, first, shift the bus
into 1st or 3rd. then , under the bus, remove the set screw at the
junction of the front and rear rods. This is a square head screw
about a foot back of the beam. remove that screw, slide the front
rod forward 'til the front and rear halves of the shift rod have
separated. The go back up into the cab and remove the shift lever
(2 13mm bolts at the base){KEEP TRACK OF THE ORIENTATION OF THE
GATE PLATE IN THERE!!!!!} (install it backward and you will have a
bear of a time getting 4 gears!). Then back under the car and slide
the front shift rod back and out.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Clutch cable. Removal is fairly basic (many of
us are, alas, quite familiar with the procedure). Unscrew the
adjuster at the rear, remove the pivot housing at the front, unclip
the cable at the front, and feed it back 'til it clears the axle
beam.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The booster and MC... The front of the booster
is a pin and clip at the bottom of the brake pedal, then there are
4 (?10mm?) nuts that hold the booster to the beam (get under there
***NOW*** and WD-40 them to death!!! and a couple more times before
you try to loosen them). Now my mind get's foggy. I remember being
forced to remove the MC with the booster, removing all the brake
and fill lines from it. I tried to remove it from the booster, but
I think it would not swing far enough out of the way to allow the
booster to pass to the rear, as it must for removal. I forget, and
will try removing the MC from the booster *again* this time, with
the same bad luck, probably.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Parking brake cables were a doddle.... clamp a
vise-grip to the square nuts and crank 'em off (liberal application
of oil helps :)</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Tie rods/Drag link... I was replacing these so I
popped both ends of each, and tossed 'em. The drag link *must* come
off, but if your new beam has good tie rods and ball joints, you
need not remove them (I *think*)(but see below)</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Brakes/steering knuckle...Since I was replacing
the tie rods, drag link and ball joints at the same time as the
beam, what I did was to loosen and pop the ball joints and tie rods
from the steering knuckle and hung the knuckle/caliper/disk
assembly from the frame. I also removed the trailing arms from the
beam before I removed the beam. If you are installing a complete
front beam assembly, you might just disconnect the hoses to the
calipers, or remove and hang the calipers only, but you're on your
own their..</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">However... I would advise removing the whole
knuckle, as the beam is heavy enough by itself, w/o adding the 60+
pounds the knuckle assemblies add.</font></p>
<center><font size="+1">BEAM REMOVAL:</font></center>
<font size="+1"><br>
It's just the 4 bolts (?17?mm) on each end (famous last words :) I
STRONGLY advise that this takes 3 people, two of whom should be
fairly hefty people! Take 3 bolts out of each end (I left the rear
upper bolt in, YMMV, I don't think it much matters) and put a jack
under the beam, in contact with the lower torsion tube with a hair
of tension on it. Release the last bolt on each side and reinsert
it ~1 turn. Put one person on either end of the beam and a third
controls the jack. The beam end folk each release their bolts, and
the third lowers the jack *slowly*. As it lowers, the beam will
want to tilt backward. The beam end folk should control this (yeah,
right, just keep yer heads outa there!)<br>
<br></font>
<p><font size="+1">Once the beam is down, the beam end folk can
lift it off the jack, rotate it and lay it down. Be careful, it
weighs on the order of 100lbs, w/o the trailing arms or steering
knuckles.</font></p>
<center><font size="+1">BEAM INSTALLATION</font></center>
<font size="+1"><br>
Is the classick "reverse of removal". Things to watch out for:<br>
All beams are not created equal! You may find that your new beam is
not the exact width of the frame (mine was, but I was warned about
this, so I pass it on). If the beam is too narrow, you are SOL and
walking til you find a wider beam. If it is too wide, then you
*must* insert shims. I was very specifically warned not to crank
the bolts to tighten it to the frame, or wedge it wider, as this
will distort it, and cause a fatigue failure of the beam (I dunno,
but it sounded bad to me!)<br>
<br></font>
<p><font size="+1">After you get the new beam up, and the bolts in
loosely, while you are tightening them, have someone lay on their
back with their feet against the lower torsion tube and press it
back while you tighten. If not, the first time you brake the bus
will take that rotational slack out suddenly. (Again, I was warned,
did this, and have no idea how bad the consequences of not doing it
are).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Further information available upon request,
corrections/additions welcomed.<br>
IMHO, you should allow a whole weekend to this. It is time
consuming, and the piece is heavy and clumsy. I would not begrudge
a pro the ~4-600 I have heard quoted for the job.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Lastly, I *believe* a '71-79 beam is OK, I don't
know about the '68-70's tho, as they may not have the mount for the
disk brake booster. There may also be some problem w/early and late
boosters. I sent one to David Schwarze off the '79 for his '73 and
it was a different diameter and rubbed. The reason *may* be a
change in beam mount points (I'm guessing here). Your best bet is a
'76-79 beam, if possible, a '71-75 if available, or a '68-70 if you
are willing to give up the brake booster.<br></font></p>
