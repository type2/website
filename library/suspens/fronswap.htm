<h3>Front End Swaps</h3>
<p>by Vince Knauf</p>
<hr size="2">
<p><font size="+1">1. How was the Front End swap and did it take
long? It took my mechanic about a full day todo it. Advantage of
68+ is replacing the "king pin" front suspensiion joints with the
"ball joint" suspension. much smoother and easier to rebuild. disc
brakes were added ?year, certainly by 71-72. I did my 69 upgrade to
get the ball joints and prepare for later upgrade to discs (and my
king pins were shot!!)</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">2. What years front end would fit a 64 Bus?
68-72 I am told bolt right on. Some small mods may be needed for
73-79 Advantage of 73+ is larger disc brakes.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">3. Did it just bolt right in, were any
modifications necessary? I am told that the 68-72 just bolts in,
the 73-79 requires mods to get the beams to mount, but that the
73-79 spindles bolt onto the 68-72 beam. I am not certain of
this.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">4. Did you use the old steering box or the one
from the 69 bus? Yes</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">5. How much did the front end cost you and would
you recommend this procedure? Recommend? YES! much smoother . cost
was the cost of the used parts and a day of the mechanics
labor.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">6. Did you rebuild the 69 Front End before you
put it in and if you did what did you replace? Yes. New ball
joints, new wheel cylinders and shoes for the drum
brakes.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">7. What reference material is available or is
that not necessary? ???? No mention in the Idiot book. I am unaware
of a "sermon" on the topic. I just asked everyone that I knew and
seemed to get some good advice.<br>
