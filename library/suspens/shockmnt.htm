<h3>Shock Absorber Mounts</h3>
<p>by Karl von Salzen</p>

<p><font size="+1"><code>The question came up about why Koni says
these shocks are for 70 to 79 and why won't they fit
68/69.</code></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><code>Here is why:</code></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><code>The lower mount hole size changed from
68/69 to 70 and up.</code></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><code>68/69 lower mount is 10mm. The nut part
number N 11 010 4 to chassis number 219 300000</code></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><code>70 and up is 12mm. The nut part N 11 020 2
from 210 2000001 is 12 x 1.5</code></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><code>The top of the shock appears to be
narrower on the 68/69 then the 70 and up.</code></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><code>68/69 upper bolt is part number 211 413
401A and is 12 x 1.5 x 95mm</code></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><code>70 up upper bolt was part number N 10 192
1 and was 12 x 1.5 x 100mm This has been replaced by N 10 706 01
and is 12 x 1.5 102mm.....</code></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><code>Not a minor mod! If you put 70-79 shocks
on a 68/69, the shocks will knock at the lower mounts. You would
need longer upper bolts and a sleeve to fit inside the lower hole
to reduce the hole size 2mm.</code><br></font></p>
