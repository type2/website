 The question came up about why Koni says these shocks are for 70 to 79 and why won't they fit 68/69. 
<p>
 Here is why: 
<p>
 The lower mount hole size changed from 68/69 to 70 and up. 
<p>
 68/69 lower mount is 10mm. The nut part number N 11 010 4 to chassis number 219 300000 
<p>
 70 and up is 12mm. The nut part N 11 020 2 from 210 2000001 is 12 x 1.5 
<p>
 The top of the shock appears to be narrower on the 68/69 then the 70 and up. 
<p>
 68/69 upper bolt is part number 211 413 401A and is 12 x 1.5 x 95mm 
<p>
 70 up upper bolt was part number N 10 192 1 and was 12 x 1.5 x 100mm 
 This has been replaced by N 10 706 01 and is 12 x 1.5 102mm..... 
<p>
 Not a minor mod! If you put 70-79 shocks on a 68/69, the shocks will knock at the lower mounts. 
 You would need longer upper bolts and a sleeve to fit inside the lower hole to reduce the hole size 2mm.
