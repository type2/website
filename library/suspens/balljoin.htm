<h3>Ball Joint Replacement</h3>
<p>by Mike Gensler</p>
<hr size="2">
<p><font size="+1">Here's my ball joint procedure - its a little
wordy (but then, that's me), but it is fairly comprehensive. This
was on a 73 bus, but the earlier busses (and probably bugs too)
should be pretty much the same. This was written up in April 97 so
suggested prices and/or vendors mentioned later in the instructions
may have changed - your call.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Other than the "damned clamp" on the swaybar,
everything ended up being pretty straight forward. It took me about
4 hours to take everything apart and about 3 to put it back
together. Now that I've done it, I could probably cut the time in
half (well maybe...).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">If your joints are anywhere near as bad as mine
were, you really need to replace them. The rubber boots on mine
were torn up when I got the bus 6 years ago and the joints had
deteriorated to the point that they literally 'rattled in their
cages' - one by as much as 3/16" side-to-side and up and
down!</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Tools used: - normal wrenches and sockets 10,
11, 12, 15, 17, 19 - small, medium, and large flathead screwdrivers
- channel-lock or long-handled pliers - 2 foot crowbar (pry-bar?) -
5 lb sledge hammer (to knock the arms off and back on) - allen
wrenches 8 and 6 (I'm not 100% sure of the sizes - the 6? is for
the hub lock nut and the 8? is for the torsion arm set screw) -
2-arm 'puller' (I got mine at the local Pep Boys for $20 and it has
been VERY useful for lots of different applications). You will need
this to get the ball joints to let go of the steering knuckles - my
uppers and one of my lowers fell right out, but the other lower was
stubborn and I had to use the puller - a really big wrench (I used
a 20" crescent) that will fit the big nuts on the ball
joints</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Supplies: - LOTS of rags - you'll be dealing
with heavily greased parts here. I bought a box of those little
latex gloves like your dentist uses and wear them anytime I'm doing
this kind of work. That way you don't have to walk around with
grease under your nails for 3 days. - WD-40 - how could you do ANY
job on your bus without some of this wonderfull stuff? - grease - I
used some black, hight temp., multipurpose moly something stuff
from the local Pep Boys (I think they consider it wheel bearing
grease). I used about half of a can (like 3" tall and 4"
diameter)</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">If your front suspension is as dirty and caked
with crud as mine and you are working in your garage or driveway,
you might want to tape some newpaper down under where you're going
to be working because all that crud is greasy and you'll end up
knocking a bunch of it off. I had to scrub my driveway with Tide
and a stiff broom afterward because nobody told me this and I was
to thick-headed to realize it ahead of time.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Steps:</font></p>
<ol>
<li><font size="+1">- remove the front shock absorbers (2 bolts -
19mm)</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">- loosen the front lug nuts and put the bus up
on jack stands or cinder blocks or whatever - just so long as it is
secure and safe</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">- remove the front wheels</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">- remove the brake pads (drive out the 2 pins
and yank them out)</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">- remove the brake line clip that secures it to
the steering knuckle (just grab it with a pair of long-handled
pliers and yank it straight off - a little WD-40 is good
here)</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">- remove the brake calipers (2 bolts - 19mm)
and hang them out of the way with some wire</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">- remove the hub dust caps - don't forget to
remove the little circlip that secures the speedo cable on the
driver's side</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">- remove the hubs - loosen the allen lock nut
and remove the nut (driver's side is a right-hand thread) then just
pull the hubs off</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">- remove the rotor backing plate (3 bolts -
11mm) - you don't have to, but it is simple and gives you a lot
more room to work</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">- remove the big nuts from the upper and lower
ball joints</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">- if they didn't just pop out, use the 2-arm
puller to get the joints out of the steering knuckle then push the
knuckle (still attached to the tierod) out of the way toward the
rear of the bus</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">- remove the nut and bolt from the end of the
sway bar (15mm)</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">- remove the clamp from the sway bar - on the
bottom side of the 'big' clamp is a sliding, tapered clamp that
hold the opened ends of the big clamp together. On the back (toward
rear of bus) end of the tapered clamp is a tab that is bent up into
the rubber bushing. Wedge a screwdriver under this tab and bend it
down straight (so it is in a line with the bottom of the tapered
clamp). Then pound it off (from the back, toward the front of the
vehicle). I used a 6" piece of wood with a metal plate on its end
so I could hammer against it because there's not much room to get a
good clean hit at the clamp itself. I put a floor jack under the
lower torsion arm to help remove the stress against the sway bar -
I don't know if this helped or not, but I think it did. For me,
this was the hardest part of the whole deal and took over an hour
before I finally got ONE of the clamps off. I left the other one on
and took the arm with the swaybar attached to that one to get the
new joint pressed in. The guys at the shop looked at me kinda
funny, but that's life. I was later informed that if you use a
clamp or channel-lock pliers to squeeze the big clamp together that
it comes off much easier - makes sense because that's how you get
it back on.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">- remove the set screw in the upper and lower
torsion arms (19mm to loosen the lock nut, then 8mm allen to remove
the screw)</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">- remove the lower torsion arm - just take the
sledge hammer and start whacking it from the back side - it slides
straight off. I wouldn't do this at 2am unless you really don't
like your neighbors very much!</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">- remove the grease seal - mine stayed with the
tube - its just a big (2"?) rubber ring. If your putting new ones
on, toss the old ones</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">- remove the upper torsion arm - I removed the
upper suspension stop</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">- that 2inch round rubber thing that the arm is
currently resting against - first by using a big screwdriver to pry
the clip that secures it out toward you (a little WD-40 helps
here). I used a 2 foot crow-bar (pry-bar?) to lever the torsion arm
up so I could get the stop out. An extra pair of hands would be
helpful for this, but with some creativity you can manage it
yourself. After it is out of there, the upper torsion arm will be
resting against the metal.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">- knock the upper torsion arm until it clears
the metal it is resting against (ie. there is no longer any
pressure against it), but DO NOT REMOVE IT FROM THE TORSION BAR
YET!!! Use the sledge hammer to bang on it, just like the lower
one. I sprayed some WD-40 on the metal where the arm is pressing
against it, just to lube it a little. You need to get the torsion
arm on the other side to this same point before removing either of
the upper arms. Otherwise the bars inside still have tension on
them from the other side and this causes problems.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">- when both upper arms are free of tension,
remove them</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font size="+1">When you've got your new joints in your arms,
the installation is just the opposite with the following
notes:</font></p>
<ol>
<li><font size="+1">- put the new torsion arm seals on all 4 arms -
that way you won't forget one!</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">- put lots of grease on the torsion bar and all
over the torsion arm</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">- I used some kinda high temp, moly something
or other all purpose (same stuff I shoot into the fittings when I
grease the tube) from the local Pep Boys</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">- put BOTH upper arms on the torsion bars
before you start pounding them back on</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">- I used the crowbar to 'lift' the upper arms
up and over the metal that they rest on while I pounded them back
on</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">- putting the upper rubber susp. stops back on
is just as much a pain in the ass as taking them off was - watch
your fingers!</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">- to get the tapered clamp back on the big sway
bar clamp, I used a pair of channel-lock or long-handled pliers to
squeeze the big clamp together until I could get the tapered clamp
started, then just pound it all the way on and bend the securing
tab back up into the rubber bushing</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">- put a jack under the lower torsion arm so you
can raise it up as you put the new ball joints through the steering
knuckle and keep it raised as you tighten the nuts, otherwise you
are tightening against the pressure from the torsion
bars</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">- make sure you put the holder for the brake
line back onto the upper ball joint before putting the nut back on
- things stack in order of eccentric bushing, steering knuckle,
brake hose holder, washer, nut.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">- if your old ball joints had washers under the
nuts (mine did), keep them and put them back on the new ones - my
new ones didn't come with them, but you need them.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">- keep an eye on the end of the ball joint (the
end the nut goes on from) as you tighten it. I had to put a (12mm?)
wrench on the end of one of the joints to keep it from turning
while I tightened down the nut.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">- this is a good time to replace your wheel
bearings if they need it (I had the VW dealer install the new
bearings in the hubs for an additional $51). Also maybe brake pads?
- your call.</font>
<p><font size="+1">******* NOTE: There is an 'eccentric' bushing on
the upper ball joint. It is an oblong thing with a large hex-shaped
end so the front-end allignment shop can turn it to adjust your
camber or castor (I don't remember which). It is apparently just
pressed onto the shaft of the ball joint, but I couldn't get mine
off. The guys at the dealership transferred it to the new ball
joints when I had them pressed in. Make sure you get this thing off
the old ones and onto the new ones or you're screwed!</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Bus Boys (800-792-2697) sells a set of 4 torsion
arms with new German ball joints already pressed in. If I had it to
do over, I'd probably buy those ($175/set plus $50 core-refundable
on return of your old arms). I paid $16 each for the joints from
Ron Salmon's Bus Depot (610-754-8989), then paid $102 to the dealer
to press them in = $166, so it's not much cheaper and you have the
hassle of taking them over there and the wait while they do it.
Again, don't forget to get the eccentric bushing off your old upper
joints.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I tried to give you as much detail as I could
remember on this. I wrote this up the day after I finished the task
so hopefully this is fairly accurate, but its possible that I left
something out. Just take your time with it and use lots of common
sense and take all the standard safety precautions. If you know
anyone else that could benefit from this info, please feel free to
share it.</font></p>
