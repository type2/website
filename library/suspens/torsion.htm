<h3>Rear End Sag Correction</h3>
<p>by Josh Rodgers</p>
<hr size="2">
<p><font size="+1">The following procedure is a step by step on how
to correct the rear ride heighth on '68 - '79 IRS buses.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">PREFACE:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The time involved varies, of course, but I was
able to do the procedure in approximately 5 hours (3.5hrs on the
first - learning, 1.5 on the second side - rushing and making
stupid mistakes ) without any step by step instructions. I feel
with these instructions a person with a good set of tools and a
minimal amount of mechanical ability could complete the procedure
in appoximately 3 hours. One person could complete the job but I
would highly recommend a second person (my procedure includes
disconnecting the brake lines which is optional but I recommend it,
so you will need a second person to help bleed the brakes when you
are done).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">TOOLS NEEDED:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">(A) Open/box end wrenches: 11mm, 16mm, 17mm,
18mm (or 3/4), 22mm (or 7/8)</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">(B) Ratchet with sockets: 16mm, 3/4" (19mm?),
22mm</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">(C) Jack stands (2)</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">(D) Large hammer</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">(E) Pry bar and/or Small wedge</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">(F) Small flat-head screwdriver</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">(G) Floor jack</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">(H) 6mm Allen wrench or triple square wrench,
depending on your CV bolts</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">(I) Good Vice-grips</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">(J) Protractor</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Additionally, I would like to add some optional
tools that I used that really made the job easier, but are not
necessary.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">(A) 3/4 inch drive Air or Electric Impact (an
electric impact is one of the best investmensts I have made for old
Vw's)</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">(B) Large floor jack</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">(C) I presoaked all bolts thoroughly with Liquid
Wrench (or similar lubricant).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">(D) I want to double-emphasize the word GOOD on
the vice-grips, without worn jaws</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">(E) Brake Fluid</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">PROCEDURE:</font></p>
<li><font size="+1">(A) Begin by breaking the lug nuts on both rear
wheels to easy removal when tires are off the ground.</font>
<ul>
<li><font size="+1">(B) Block the front tires so the vehicle can
not roll forwards or backwards on you and jack the back of the
vehicle up at least high enough to remove the rear
wheels</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">(C) I placed large jack stands under the rear
main frame supports just forward of the torsion
housing.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">(D) I then removed the floor jack and rear
wheels.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">(E) Remove the lower shock mount bolt (mine had
17mm on one end and 3/4" (19mm?)</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">(F) Next, I removed the outer CV bolts (the
trick here is to dowse the bolts ahead of time with lubricant, then
take your vise-grips and try turning the bolts forwards and back,
tightening and loosening until they break, then use your Metric
Allen wrench or triple square wrench). I used something to support
the axles to keep em from dropping to the floor. Important: If dirt
gets in the greased ends of the CV's or if you are low on grease,
your CV's may pop when reassembled. Now is a good time to regrease.
Use special CV grease rather than standard grease. Also, I covered
the ends of the greased CV's with Zip-lock bags (or Duct tape) to
keep dirt out and grease in.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">(G) I disconnected the brake line that runs
thru the hub. I will say this is optional but the first side I did
was hard to get a part until I disconnected so it is one of those
things where if you go thru a little extra work now, it will save
you much time and head aches later. This is NOT necessary on the
Type 1.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">(H) Next, I removed the bolts (2 small, 2 large
-&gt; 22mm?) from the outer hub that run thru the spring plate.
This is where the electric (or air) impact showed its
worth.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">(I) Now, you should just have bare spring
plates with nothing attached to them.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">(J) At this point, we take the four bolts out
of the torsion housing ends (16mm?) and remove the covers. A black
rubber spring plate bushing should come out with the cover.</font>
<p><font size="+1">[Editor's Note: There are two of these bushings,
one on either side of the spring plate. Now is a good time to
replace them with new ones. The part number is 211 511 245A for
'50-'79 Type 2s. You'll need 4--they cost around $7 each (1999
prices). Lubricate them with talcum powder (not grease!) before
installing. Talcum powder is available from your local
pharmacist/chemist. FYI: A Porsche aftermarket company selling
torsion bars states that breakage of the bars is not covered under
warranty if they were not installed with all new spring plate
bushings. Installing only new outer bushings is not acceptible--you
must replace all four together.]</font></p>
</li>
<li><font size="+1">(K) This is where I marked the current location
of the spring plate on the splines of the torsion. I just scratched
an arrow on the spring plate that pointed to the center of the
little circle on the torsion housing but, in retrospect, wish I
would have scratched a full line to go all the way across the
torsion bar and spring plate.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">(L) Now great caution must be taken not to pull
the torsion bar from its spline location on the inside of the
torsion housing (the torsion bar is not secure on the inside; it is
just splined on both ends; there is one torsion bar per side). I
also scratched a line into the torsion housing using the spring
plate as a straight edge just in case this happened. Again, tons of
lubricant was applied to the spline area of the spring plate and
torsion bar.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">(M) What we want to do now is push the torsion
bar thru the eye of the spring plate. I did this by hammering a
wedge or crow bar behind the spring plate, and hammering a deep
well socket thru the center of the spring plate on the torsion bar
(wedge pushes spring plate out, socket keeps torsion pushed in).
Take your time and be aware of what you are beating on. A small
hammer worked fine for me. If the inside of the torsion bar pops
out, don't freak out, just realign the spring plate with the mark
we straight-edged on the torsion housing.</font>
<p><font size="+1">[Editor's Note: If you scratch any paint of the
torsion bar, it is a good idea to clean and paint so no rust
occurs. Rust will eventually cause the bar to break as it
penetrates the bar, so use precautions].</font></p>
</li>
<li><font size="+1">(N) More Liquid wrench...Heat????? Have you
taken a break yet????? Give it a couple seconds and come back with
a little more patience and possibly a new perspective.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">(O) OK...now that we got those off, Now comes
the time for precision.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">(P) See George Lyle's procedure for <a href=
"tmadj.htm">proper adjustment of the torsion bar</a> to attain the
correct ride height.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">(Q) Now that your adjustment is done, more than
likely, you will need an assistant here to help you get the spring
plate up above the step on the bottom of the torsion housing cover.
I used a large floor jack to jack the spring plate up so far, then
hammer it on at the same time.</font>
<p><font size="+1">For reference, when I jacked up the spring
plate, after a while, it did eventually lift the bus off of the
jack stands.</font></p>
</li>
<li><font size="+1">(R) Also, the torsion housing cover can be kind
of tricky to get back on. Don't forget to install the spring plate
bushings lubricated with talcum powder. I took a long skinny bolt
and washer through one of the bolt holes and the cover that would
allow the cover to move around a little, then got one of the
original bolts started and then got the other two originals in.
Once I got those pretty snug, I removed the unoriginal long, skinny
bolt and nut and replaced it with the last of the original
bolts.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">(S) The rest is basically everything in the
opposite order. Put brake line and outer hub back on. The CV and
the shock are bolted back to the wheel hub and you reattach the
tires.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">(T) Don't forget to bleed the brakes if you did
disconnect the brake lines.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">(U) Finally, to insure proper tire wear and
stability, take your baby by your local Tire guy for rear wheel
alignment check.</font></li>
<li><font size="+1">(V) Don't forget to re-aim those
headlights!<br></font>
