For a normal alignment the steering wheel doesn't need removing.
<p> 
However, if components are replaced, the steering wheel may need to be
repositioned if you're picky about it being horizontal. The reason is
that only one tie rod is adjustable.
<p> 
You can adjust out minor crookedness with the drag link, but you have
to be careful to make sure that you don't adjust it so that you run to
the end of the worm gear in the gearbox. This is _very_ bad for the
worm and peg, and we all know what a hassle and cost it is to replace
the steering box!
<p> 
The correct way to adjust the steering is to get the wheels centered,
then make sure the steering box is centered, then move the wheel on
its shaft to center the wheel. The last bit of crookedness is taken
out with the drag link.
<p> 
The PO of my bus had the drag link replaced and my wheel is 90 degrees
to where it should be. I'm still looking for someone with the proper
puller for the wheel or the time to fab one up myself. In the
meantime I've grown accustomed to looking around the spoke to read the
speedo :)

The steering wheel *does not* need to
be removed! and I gotta say that by adjusting the drag link, you can take
more than a 90 degree lopsidedness out of your steering wheel. And, if
your steering wheel is at all lopsided you very much should! These
days there are very few places (including VW Dealers) that know the drill
on setting up the front end on a bus. Below is an outline of the steps:
<p> 
1) remove the front end of the drag link from the pitman arm. Use a
puller or tie rod press, *NOT* a pickle fork! If the end on your drag
link uses a castellated nut and cotter pin, fine, otherwise go out and
buy a new vibration proof nut (this is one nut you *really* don't want to
lose!).
<p> 
2) set the left wheel camber (eccentric bushing on the lower ball
joint)
<p> 
3) Set the left wheel (this is the one with the solid tie rod) to the
proper toe by just moving it by hand.
<p> 
4) set right wheel camber
<p> 
5) set right wheel toe using the adjustable tie rod
<p> 
6) center the steering box. Turn the steering wheel all the way to one
end and then all the way to the other, counting turns. Turn it back
1/2 the turn count, including 1/2 the partial turns. If no one had messed
with it, and no major accidents have bent anything, the steering wheel
will be very close to level at this point. If it's not, center the box
and we will re-level the wheel in step 8. If it's less than 1/8th of a
turn off, you can level it, but if you are a perfectionist, center the
steering box and do step 8.
<p> 
7) adjust the drag link. Adjust it 'til it drops into the pitman arm
as close as possible. you may find that when it is correctly adjusted,
that levels your steering wheel all by itself, as you must do full turns on
the adjustable end. It is a fine thread, with a fair amount of length, so
it should be able to reach any undamaged, centered steering box (but see
the worst case note) After it is in place, tighten on the nut and *BE SURE
TO INSTALL THE COTTER PIN!!!!!*
<p> 
8) If your steering wheel is not level, then (and only then) you need
to pull and re-install it. on the later busses (my '76 and 78) the wheel
lifts off after the nut is removed. On earlier busses *you ***must***
use a puller*! There is no way, as the original poster found, to get the
wheel off without it. I don't know where the divide is, but the 73 is
a tapered shaft, and the 76 is straight, so it is between those two.
<p> 
Worst case scenarios:
<p> 
If your drag link is not able to be adjusted to the pitman arm... I
would assume massive front end damage in this case. Before you move another
inch, check for bent tie rods and/or drag link! if all looks well, you
need to have it hauled to a shop to check the trailing arms. This
should have showed up when adjusting the camber, but maybe not, if both upper and lower are bent. Also check the beam for straightness!
 <p> 
If all parts of the system are OK, and it is an aftermarket drag link
that is just the wrong length (I dunno... it *could* happen...) then the
pitman arm *is* removable, and can be adjusted, but it is in the worst
spot for applying a puller, it is the biggest tapered, splined shaft I
have ever dealt with and is, basically, a metric bear to get off (a
metric bear, BTW, is equivalent to 2.2 english bears :) AFAIK, this tapered,
splined shaft is applicable to all years of breadloaf busses.
<p> 
I usually take my busses to a tire place, have them perform steps 2-5,
bring it home and pop the drag link and set the steering wheel myself.

The steering box MUST be at it's center point when driving straight ahead and 
properly adjusted.  See discussion of this in Bentley.
<p> 
There is a designed in "tight spot" (for lack of a better term) in the 
steering box, located at the center point of it's travel.  Even a brand new 
and accurately adjusted steering box will have slack/play in the steering 
wheel on either side of this center point.
<p> 
Steering box adjustment must be made with the box centered on this "tight 
spot".  Doing otherwise will damage the unit immediately, and can even cause 
the box to seize as you attempt to steer.  This is definitely a VERY BAD 
THING!  
<p> 
Even if it doesn't seize, the improperly adjusted internals will quickly be 
damaged by being forced to turn through the "tight spot" and you'll be back in 
the market for a new/rebuilt steering box.
<p> 
These units are too expensive, and too much of a hassle to replace, to risk 
damage due to incorrect adjustment.  I don't always agree with the Bentley 
manual, but in this instance you ignore it's instructions at your peril.
