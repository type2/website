<h3>Steering Wheel and Alignment</h3>
<p>by George Lyle, Steve Dolan, and Fred Stoermer</p>

<p><font size="+1">For a normal alignment the steering wheel
doesn't need removing.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">However, if components are replaced, the
steering wheel may need to be repositioned if you're picky about it
being horizontal. The reason is that only one tie rod is
adjustable.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">You can adjust out minor crookedness with the
drag link, but you have to be careful to make sure that you don't
adjust it so that you run to the end of the worm gear in the
gearbox. This is _very_ bad for the worm and peg, and we all know
what a hassle and cost it is to replace the steering
box!</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The correct way to adjust the steering is to get
the wheels centered, then make sure the steering box is centered,
then move the wheel on its shaft to center the wheel. The last bit
of crookedness is taken out with the drag link.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The PO of my bus had the drag link replaced and
my wheel is 90 degrees to where it should be. I'm still looking for
someone with the proper puller for the wheel or the time to fab one
up myself. In the meantime I've grown accustomed to looking around
the spoke to read the speedo :)</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Steve Dolan writes:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The steering wheel *does not* need to be
removed! and I gotta say that by adjusting the drag link, you can
take more than a 90 degree lopsidedness out of your steering wheel.
And, if your steering wheel is at all lopsided you very much
should! These days there are very few places (including VW Dealers)
that know the drill on setting up the front end on a bus. Below is
an outline of the steps:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">1) remove the front end of the drag link from
the pitman arm. Use a puller or tie rod press, *NOT* a pickle fork!
If the end on your drag link uses a castellated nut and cotter pin,
fine, otherwise go out and buy a new vibration proof nut (this is
one nut you *really* don't want to lose!).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">2) set the left wheel camber (eccentric bushing
on the lower ball joint)</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">3) Set the left wheel (this is the one with the
solid tie rod) to the proper toe by just moving it by
hand.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">4) set right wheel camber</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">5) set right wheel toe using the adjustable tie
rod</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">6) center the steering box. Turn the steering
wheel all the way to one end and then all the way to the other,
counting turns. Turn it back 1/2 the turn count, including 1/2 the
partial turns. If no one had messed with it, and no major accidents
have bent anything, the steering wheel will be very close to level
at this point. If it's not, center the box and we will re-level the
wheel in step 8. If it's less than 1/8th of a turn off, you can
level it, but if you are a perfectionist, center the steering box
and do step 8.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">7) adjust the drag link. Adjust it 'til it drops
into the pitman arm as close as possible. you may find that when it
is correctly adjusted, that levels your steering wheel all by
itself, as you must do full turns on the adjustable end. It is a
fine thread, with a fair amount of length, so it should be able to
reach any undamaged, centered steering box (but see the worst case
note) After it is in place, tighten on the nut and *BE SURE TO
INSTALL THE COTTER PIN!!!!!*</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">8) If your steering wheel is not level, then
(and only then) you need to pull and re-install it. on the later
busses (my '76 and 78) the wheel lifts off after the nut is
removed. On earlier busses *you ***must*** use a puller*! There is
no way, as the original poster found, to get the wheel off without
it. I don't know where the divide is, but the 73 is a tapered
shaft, and the 76 is straight, so it is between those
two.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Worst case scenarios:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">If your drag link is not able to be adjusted to
the pitman arm... I would assume massive front end damage in this
case. Before you move another inch, check for bent tie rods and/or
drag link! if all looks well, you need to have it hauled to a shop
to check the trailing arms. This should have showed up when
adjusting the camber, but maybe not, if both upper and lower are
bent. Also check the beam for straightness!</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">If all parts of the system are OK, and it is an
aftermarket drag link that is just the wrong length (I dunno... it
*could* happen...) then the pitman arm *is* removable, and can be
adjusted, but it is in the worst spot for applying a puller, it is
the biggest tapered, splined shaft I have ever dealt with and is,
basically, a metric bear to get off (a metric bear, BTW, is
equivalent to 2.2 english bears :) AFAIK, this tapered, splined
shaft is applicable to all years of breadloaf busses.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I usually take my busses to a tire place, have
them perform steps 2-5, bring it home and pop the drag link and set
the steering wheel myself.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Fred Stoermer writes:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The steering box MUST be at it's center point
when driving straight ahead and properly adjusted. See discussion
of this in Bentley.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">There is a designed in "tight spot" (for lack of
a better term) in the steering box, located at the center point of
it's travel. Even a brand new and accurately adjusted steering box
will have slack/play in the steering wheel on either side of this
center point.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Steering box adjustment must be made with the
box centered on this "tight spot". Doing otherwise will damage the
unit immediately, and can even cause the box to seize as you
attempt to steer. This is definitely a VERY BAD THING!</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Even if it doesn't seize, the improperly
adjusted internals will quickly be damaged by being forced to turn
through the "tight spot" and you'll be back in the market for a
new/rebuilt steering box.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">These units are too expensive, and too much of a
hassle to replace, to risk damage due to incorrect adjustment. I
don't always agree with the Bentley manual, but in this instance
you ignore it's instructions at your peril.</font></p>
