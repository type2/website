<h3>Transvair Conversion on a '70 Westfalia</h3>
<p>by Trevor Bessy</p>
<hr size="2">
<p><font size="+1">Here's an excellent example of a well crafted
Transvair (Corvair conversion on a VW Transporter) done by <a href=
"mailto:trevbessy@aol.com">Trevor Bessy</a>. These photos are of
his '70 pop-top Westfalia taken at Buses by the Tunnel '99, an
annual Limbo event in North Adams, MA. The engine and transmission
are both from a Corvair. Trevor mentioned that the shift linkage
was available for the bus in a kit. The linkage runs along the
outside of the stock VW linkage tube, down the center of the
bus.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">An especially nice aspect of this conversion was
the attention to detail and efforts to modify only a miniminal
amount of the stock bus metal. He mentioned that the conversion kit
expects the installer to cut out the bus body metal that surrounds
the stock engine so that the Corvair tin will fit. Instead, he
adapted the instructions in the kit and cut instead the Corvair tin
and preserved the surrounding bodywork as much as possible. Even
the bracket for the full flow oil filter was cleverly clamped on
using bolts through existing holes. The only incisions made to the
surrounding metal were two vertical cuts, one cut on either side,
just below the gas tank firewall. That was so the surrounding metal
could be pushed to the sides for clearance. The only other major
modification was the removal of the oil bath air cleaner pedestal,
but it did seem that it would've been possible to simply bend it
back out of the way to achieve the minimum clearance
needed.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Bringing this back to stock would require only
two lines of weld and finishing, and welding the air cleaner
pedestal back. No other metal was removed, and in all other spots,
adapters were used to retain the stock bus so that swapping back to
stock could be done with ease.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Rear torsion springs were adjusted to correct
for the additional weight. The rear engine apron was removed and a
simple custom made piece was inserted in its place to clear the
longer Corvair engine.</font></p>

Berkshires effortlessly. Kudos to Trevor on a thoughtful
conversion! When he gets his webpage up this writeup will be
