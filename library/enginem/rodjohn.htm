<h3>Rod Length for Performance Engines</h3>
<p>by John Connolly</p>
<hr size="2">
<blockquote><font size="+1"><i>So what is the relationship between
power and rod length? Any other sage advice on building a 2110 that
will not likely see 5000 or more RPM? For instance, heads and
carbs?</i></font></blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">With a rpm powerband that you need, use the
shortest rod you can get. Stock or even Porsche length.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">All else being equal, a longer rod moves the
powerbanD UP higher in the rpm range, and a shorter rod is torquey
at the low rpm band.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">If you have some spare parts, assemble this (or
imagine it if you can see in 3 space well): an assembled engine
with a long rod on one journal, and a short one on the other. Deck
height is the same (adjusted, of course). Now, as the cylinder
fires, and the piston moves down say, .060", you will see the short
rod engine moves the crank MORE crank degrees because of the short
rod, and the long rod moves barely at all. Imagine a rod length of
0, and a rod length of infinity to better understand
this.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">As a result, the long rod pistons "dwells" at
TDC longer, and allows the pressure to build up. Obviously at high
rpm this is good for maintaining power since the short rod engine
would have the piston halfway down its stroke in no time (no push)!
Conversely, the short rod engine at low rpms and high loads will
not ping and the engine has "leverage" to spin the crank, where the
long rod engine "stalls".</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Since the piston "timing" is different on the
two respective engines they have different characteristics
regarding camshaft selection and timing requirements. Also, the
shorter engine will "pull and push" the charge thru the ports
harder, running out of "breath" at a lower rpm while the long rod
engine keeps pulling! VW managed to incorporate this characteristic
on the T-4 engines which have a VERY short rod, which is ideal for
the heavy bus. Obviously high rpms are a "no no" on this engine
without a rod change (and length change). Some high rpm engines use
insanely long rods to "slow" the piston down to keep parts together
and power up at these rpms. The biggest drawback is engine size,
since we can only move the piston pin up so far (the ring stack
gets in the way) to keep things close to the same size.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Lastly, rod bearing life is shorter on short rod
engines, and so is piston and ring life (due to the side loads
associated with the "extreme" angles the short rod engine's
see).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Hope this makes some sense. This is one aspect
of engine knowledge that most people are clueless about.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">On a 2110 you can NOT use the stock rebuilt T-1
rod without asking for rod failure. This rod is only safe to a 78mm
stroke. If you go to a better rod, don't be afraid to crank it to
86mm.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">For your engine, use the Engle 110 cam (SCAT
C-35 is the same), and a 40 X 35.5 head (good one).</font></p>
