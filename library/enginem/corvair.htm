<h3>Corvair Engine Conversion</h3>
<p>by Keith</p>
<hr size="2">
<p><font size="+1">Chevy Corvairs were built from 1960 to 1969.
There were 2 body styles, early and late (sounds like our buses).
The early Corvairs were somewhat smaller and more square (they were
built from 1960 to 1964). The late ones were built from '64 to '69.
The early engines had a lower horsepower rating (I think it was 80
hp).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">From 1964 through 1969 Chevy increased the
horsepower by making the connecting rods longer and enlarging the
diameter of the pistons. Now the motor put ouy 110 hp. You could
also get a 140 hp motor which has 4 carbs and a 180 hp turbocharged
engine. Both of these, the 140 and the turbo, are not what you want
to install because of their slower torque curve, making the 1965
through 1969 110 engine ideal for the Transvair kit.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">You use the Corvair transmission and
differential for the conversion kit. You can use a 4 speed or an
automatic transmission called a "Powerglide". This is a 2 speed
transmission and it's what I have run for 8 years. One of the
reasons I went this route is because the kit is cheaper for the
auto and easier to install, plus there is a lot less things that
can go wrong: no clutch no pressure plate, throw out bearing
etc.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">When I say it just bolts right in I mean it! The
only thing you have to do as far as modifing anything is the engine
compartment has to be cut out square, which is easily done with a
Sawzall and a metal blade. The front of the transmission hangs in
the same stock location as the VW transmission, the kit has an
adaptor that makes this possible. The stock VW CV joints and axles
are used and they bolt right up to the Corvair differential with
the kit's adaptor plates. The rear of the engine hangs with the
kit's engine mount which bolts right up to the stock VW locations
on either side of the motor. It comes with everthing you need and
everything fits perfect, wire harness and all.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">This motor is bullet proof. It has hydraulic
lifters, dual carbs and your horsepower doubles. When the kit is
installed it looks stock, but runs like a bat out of hell. One
thing I like is that now I never have to adjust the lifters or
re-torque the heads. When it had a VW engine I was going through an
engine a year. I have had this set up for 8 years now and the only
thing that I ever had go wrong is I dropped a valve seat. Also I
don't have to drive in the slow lane anymore on the freeway, I can
drive 80 to 90 mph. My favorite thing to do is spot a bus the same
year as mine on the freeway, pulling up next to it and then just
leave it in the dust. Plus, the way the 6 cylinder, dual exhaust
sounds: it's so cool!!!!</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">To do this installation right you should start
out with a rebuilt engine and transaxle which could run anywhere
from $2,000-3,000 depending on how trick you want it.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The kit costs $600 and comes with everthing you
need including instructions with good pictures</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Corvair parts are not rare. They are everywhere
and can be picked up at a good price. The 2 biggest parts suppliers
are <a href="http://www.corvair.com/">Clark's Corvair</a> in
Shelburne, Massachusetts, USA and the <a href=
"http://www.corvairunderground.com/">Corvair Underground</a> in
Oregon, USA. They make everything you could ever need for
rebuilding a Corvair engine.<br></font></p>
