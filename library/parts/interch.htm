<p>The  Late 63-66 Beetle Headlight assmblies will work on a split window bus provided that:
The water drain hole in the headlight rim is drilled in it's proper(bottom) location;
The  sealed beam SHOULD mount "sideways" for running in a Bus/Pickup. 
Replacement units (Brazil) from places like myself and WCM are actually 
Beetle assemblies (and have been for over 15 years), but of course the 
water drain holes have to be drilled  to be authentic for Buses/Pickups.
<p>
Late 63-66 Beetle Headlight Assemblies have the Adjustment Screw 
OFFSET at 2 and 8 o'clock positions.  Beetles up to Early 63 (like my '62) have 
both screws at the bottom.  These may have been used on 50's series 
Buses, but I have nothing to substantiate that.  Most Buses I've 
seen have the OFFSET screw arrangement.

Split brake cylinders:
<p>
The 1955-63 rear cylinders can be use on either side on the rear only.  While
the front cylinders of the same years are left and right side only.  Then with
the 1963 only one ton M 215 suspension and the 1964-67 rear cylinders that are
either side also.  Once again the front cylinders for these years and types
are left and right only.  None of the 1955-63 brake cylinders can be used on a
1963 only one ton suspension or the 1964-67 buses and visa versa.

'67 and earlier busses and 
early beetles use the same tie-rod ends.
<p>
'62 and earlier busses use the same rear axle nut as beetles.
<p>
63 and later busses use the same front spindle bearing nut locking
plate washer as beetles.
<p>
<B>Deck Lids - Split </B>
<p>
'66-'67 busses use the same engine compartment latch as beetles. <BR>
'59-'64 deck lids same<BR>
'65 decklid is a one-year-only item. Earlier decklids had the
pressed steel lever stay to hold them open, and later decklids had 
the push button latch to open them. '65 is unique because it uses 
a church-key to open the latch, and the spring stay to hold it open. 
If you are willing to go un-original you can switch your decklid 
AND REAR APRON to a '66 or '67 and use the pushbutton decklid.

<B>Doors - Split</B>
<P>
'49 has hinges below the beltline (upper hinge is lower than later buses)
<P>
'50-early '55 all *normal* barndoor doors are the same (I think)
<P>
late '55-'58 the handle base is flush to the door
<P>
'59-early'64 the handle base bolts to a depression in the door
<P>
The '64-'67 doors are unique to each year (I think)

I know for a fact that the air seals for the spark plug wires are a 
direct replacement for the air seals around the brake and clutch pedal 
rods going thru the floor on busses.

'68-'71 doors except '68's have different door handle outside 
and different locking system inside.  
Door reflectors were added in'70 and on models so reflector holes 
will need to be filled for pre'70 use.

'68-'69 doors used the round door reflectors
