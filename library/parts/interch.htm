<p><font size="+1">The Late 63-66 Beetle Headlight assmblies will
work on a split window bus provided that: The water drain hole in
the headlight rim is drilled in it's proper(bottom) location; The
sealed beam SHOULD mount "sideways" for running in a Bus/Pickup.
Replacement units (Brazil) from places like myself and WCM are
actually Beetle assemblies (and have been for over 15 years), but
of course the water drain holes have to be drilled to be authentic
for Buses/Pickups.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Late 63-66 Beetle Headlight Assemblies have the
Adjustment Screw OFFSET at 2 and 8 o'clock positions. Beetles up to
Early 63 (like my '62) have both screws at the bottom. These may
have been used on 50's series Buses, but I have nothing to
substantiate that. Most Buses I've seen have the OFFSET screw
arrangement.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Split brake cylinders:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The 1955-63 rear cylinders can be use on either
side on the rear only. While the front cylinders of the same years
are left and right side only. Then with the 1963 only one ton M 215
suspension and the 1964-67 rear cylinders that are either side
also. Once again the front cylinders for these years and types are
left and right only. None of the 1955-63 brake cylinders can be
used on a 1963 only one ton suspension or the 1964-67 buses and
visa versa.</font></p>

same tie-rod ends.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">'62 and earlier busses use the same rear axle
nut as beetles.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">63 and later busses use the same front spindle
bearing nut locking plate washer as beetles.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Deck Lids - Split</b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">'66-'67 busses use the same engine compartment
latch as beetles.<br>
'59-'64 deck lids same<br>
'65 decklid is a one-year-only item. Earlier decklids had the
pressed steel lever stay to hold them open, and later decklids had
the push button latch to open them. '65 is unique because it uses a
church-key to open the latch, and the spring stay to hold it open.
If you are willing to go un-original you can switch your decklid
AND REAR APRON to a '66 or '67 and use the pushbutton
decklid.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Doors - Split</b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">'49 has hinges below the beltline (upper hinge
is lower than later buses)</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">'50-early '55 all *normal* barndoor doors are
the same (I think)</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">late '55-'58 the handle base is flush to the
door</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">'59-early'64 the handle base bolts to a
depression in the door</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The '64-'67 doors are unique to each year (I
think)</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I know for a fact that the air seals for the
spark plug wires are a direct replacement for the air seals around
the brake and clutch pedal rods going thru the floor on
busses.</font></p>
