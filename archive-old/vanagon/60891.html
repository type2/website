Subject: Re: '79 Water-cooled Bus? Yessirree!

&gt;| No, it is not a cosmetic alteration it is a Mexican (or possibly Brasilian?)
&gt;| bus. If you go south of the border you will see a TON of these. 

	I saw a new Caravelle with Mexican plates that had a T-2 body, Eurovan
interior (well, the rear seats were the same) with the raditor up front and
what looked like a inline 4 in the little engine hatch (from underneath). The
top was a little taller than the standard T-2 body as well... And it was
teal...

&gt;| re-tooled to build the third generation of Transporter/Bulli. They coninued
&gt;| building these through the '80's, selling them with motors built for the
&gt;| Vanagon, and the weird looking radiator up front. I guess no one has seen a
&gt;| real need to &quot;Grey Market&quot; these into the U.S. 

	I believe the front sheet metal can be imported pretty easily (a
mechanic I know was looking to do this) and I have seen a number of bay windows
that have had this modification preformed kicking about the bay area... I
was looking to do it to my breadloaf before it got towed out of my driveway
for no smog (how can a seized engine produce smog I kept asking)... The
rabbit/golf engine will fit in the stock 11 degree tilt that the engine sits
at in the golf and kennedy making an adapter plate...
