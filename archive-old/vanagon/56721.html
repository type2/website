Item Subject: The archives address
     Dave,
     
       I get this a lot as well.  Can anyone tell me why this is?  
     Searching the archives can be tedious because you get this message a 
     lot when you try to open files from the achieves as well.  I find 
     myself canceling out of loading any archived message if it takes more 
     than ten seconds to load.  I go to other files or try again 
     immediately after canceling.  I usually have success the second or 
     third time but man can this be *TEDIOUS*.  Here is the current address 
     just in case you are trying an old URL.
     
     http://halfdan.med.umn_dot_edu:8853/misc/archives/vanagon.html
     
     Regards,
     
     Vince.

Could some please post the address for the archives. Everytime the I try to 
access them it says the server is not accepting connections or is busy.
     
     
Thanks,
