Subject: Re: cb range?

&gt;Hey all,
&gt;Now that I've got my new cb toy, I was wondering what the useful working range
&gt;would be.  It's a 4-watt transmitter with a whip antenna, a bit more than 3
feet
&gt;long.  any ideas?  Oh, by the way, it's mounted on top of a bus :)

Hello Sean,
     I have a slightly tweeked Pace 8041 and a K40 60&quot; antenna, the antenna
is mounted on top of the van with a maganetic base.  I average 8 to 10 miles
for recieve and 3 to 5 miles  transmitting, over fairly flat terrain.
Weather sunspots and terrain make these ranges highly variable.  Have fun
with the new toy. :-)
