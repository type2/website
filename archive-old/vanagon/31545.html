Subject: Alternator, V.R. question
Date: Wed, 27 Dec 95 18:15:07 CST


Can someone sketch for me a complete diagram of the charging system
of a 79 bus with external voltage regulator.  I got the new alternator
for dads bus put in, but I get no juice.  The original alternator was
destroyed by a reversed battery.  I also replaced the voltage regulator.

The V.R. has pins labeled D+, D- and DF as does the alternator.  Three
wires connect the regulator pins to the corresponding alternator pins.
D- appears to be simply ground.  DF I am guessing is the field coil.
D+ also connects to a wire from the dashboard light.

I'm a bit confused on where the regulator is supposed to get power to
run through the field coils.  12v does not appear on any of the pins.

Thanks,

Albrecht &quot;hopeing not to have to remove the alternator again&quot; Jander
