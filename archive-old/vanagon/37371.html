&gt; Saturday, I replaced the starter on my 87 syncro with a rebuilt bosch unit 
&gt; purchased from Pep Boys for $118 with a $37 core charge.  I did this because 
&gt; the solenoid was intermittently inop in cold temperatures and getting worse.

Wow!  I can't believe you didn't flame me for my 1.5-2 hour estimate!  
Hope you don't hate me too much.  Sure makes me love my 81 even more.
