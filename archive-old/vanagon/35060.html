&gt;In my inexperienced beginnings of rebuilding my 1700cc engine(before

&gt;put them back on yet, but when I am I don't know if I will be able to 
&gt;do it right.  Is there any book that gives a good picture of how all 
&gt;the tins are assembled? Is there anyway to find out how they go on 
&gt;without acting like the whole thing is a jigsaw puzzle.  Please help,

Bentley and Haynes each have pretty good pictures of the tinware.  The
Bentley manual is the &quot;official&quot; one and you can order it through
numerous VW places, maybe even your local dealer.  The Haynes you can
find in your local FLAPS.  If they don't have the one for your bus,
they will order it.  Still, you might also want to take a trip to a
junkyard to see one put together.
