Chris,

Don't ignore thermistors.  Some of the new epoxy-packaged units have specs
that rival nuclear instrumentation and they are the size of a pin-head -- you
may reliably fasten them to aluminum castings with a special metal-filled
epoxy offered with several of the thermistor kits.  I've used these on wands
to detect/measure air-flow, thanks to their exquisite sensitivitiy.
