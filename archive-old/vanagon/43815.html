Subject: Re: Re- more Q's on the TDI

I've been following this thread with interest.  One comment:
I ran out of diesel in the '82 Diesel Westy at least half a dozen
times.  Every single time, all I had to was to bring a can of diesel
fuel, dump it in, turn the starter for 10 seconds, and the engine started.

One of my friends, however, ran out of fuel with his 1980 Mercedes-Benz
300 Turbo-diesel, and he ended up paying the dealer $$$ (around $500) 
to vacuum the injectors :-(  (and this happened back in '87)...

&gt;&gt; You have to use diesel again and the air that entered the fuel system
&gt;&gt; must be bled (sp?) out of it, just like a brake system, some cars
