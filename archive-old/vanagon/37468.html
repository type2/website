Subject: head temp gauge

        I've got an '80 Westy and for the second time in 7 months will be
replacing the head on my #1-2 side.
(I believe I got a faulty one 7 mos. ago--there appeared to be
contamination in the welding that caused my valves to drop).  I am aware of
several head temp gauges that I can install myself to prevent, somewhat,
overheating that might prevent this problem from happening again.  My
question.
Which are the better ones on the market and where might I find one?    TIA.

Mark
