Subject: Re: More on Snow tires: Nokia Hakappelitta 10

Hi Tom, et al

I mail order my Hakkas from a place called Greer Enterprises
(414.747.0996) - they just quoted me $89.65/tire including UPS
shipping, but then mounting's gonna be extra.  Around me, I don't
know any Nokia dealers (hadn't looked too hard, tho!).

I've used Hakkas on my Jetta and Integra, and have been real
happy with 'em!  They're also really great on very wet roads.

Good luck in the snow, all...

&gt; This is a Load Range D, 8 ply snow tire.   Our local Nokia dealer can get
&gt; them for 100$ per tire (includes mounting only, balancing is 8$ extra).
&gt; The size is 185R14.  They are stud-able (although this shop charges 24.95
&gt; per tire -- rip-off!).  They are &quot;directional&quot; with a little arrow on the
&gt; sidewall that shows direction of rotation  (so be careful when backing
&gt; up :-).  I've got these on my Jetta -- they're excellent in snow and,
&gt; in spite of the very aggressive tread, are relatively quiet and handle
&gt; well on dry roads.  I have no experience with them on a vanagon/bus.
