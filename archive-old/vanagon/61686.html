Subject: RE: Dometic - Have Flame - No Cooling

Blake,

Just talked to a friend who had the same problem.   He called the Dometic
expert at the RV place in Elkhart, who said that it was either a clogged
jet (at combustion chamber), or a clogged bypass screw ( brass screw on top
of the thermostat, which has a metering orifice in it) or a clogged or
restricted exhaust pipe, or possible a clogged gauze filter in gas outlet
pipe (mine doesn't have one).
Friend found that previous owner had scraped the orifice at the burner just
enough to close it up some.   A new jet fixed it.    I'm going to try that
as soon as I get the jet.

BTW - It was someone else who ordered the new thermostat.

&gt;David,
&gt; After spending many months of pulling apart my fridge and cleaning and   
&gt;pulling everything apart to see how it worked I did get everything   
&gt;running (gas, fans).  After playing with it I have become very familiar   
&gt;with the design and operation of the unit.  I have put my refrigerator   
&gt;back in my van.  It works on the bench but gas still isn't cooling like   
&gt;120V.  I was able to get the fins to freeze on 120V but not with gas.  I   
&gt;didn't actually check with a thermometer.  On the 27th I'm going on a   
&gt;trip and after that I'll be able to report more completely on how it's   
&gt;operating.
&gt; I do know that my thermostat is opening up for the second stage flame.   
&gt; When you fridge is running there is always a pilot light that is burning   
&gt;supplied by a bypass gas jet that is attached to the thermostat.  When   
&gt;the cooling fins warm enough, the pressure sensor bulb which is in the   
&gt;refrigeration compartment expands and inflates a billow which opens the   
&gt;burner gas valve.  When this valve is open the cooling will happen.  In   
&gt;essence, it is dumping more gas into the burner creating a larger flame   
&gt;in order to heat more of the ammonia need for cooling.
&gt; I would love to pull more of this type of information together in order   
&gt;to create a very complete and accurate archive on these Dometic   
&gt;refrigerators.  I have some text material on these mobile refrigerators   
&gt;with excellent pictures explaining the whole process in depth.  I don't   
&gt;have a scanner but would be willing to mail them to someone in order to   
&gt;do this.  From reading this tread for about 3 weeks it seems that people   
&gt;really want to learn about this stuff.
&gt; If you want to go straight to the source here is Dometic's address and   
&gt;phone.  Maybe they have repair manuals or info.  ( I haven't talked to   
&gt;them yet)

&gt; By the way, David, you said you paid $126 for a new thermostat.  What   
&gt;did that include (part wise) and did that include labor to install?  How   
&gt;did that come out.  I know that it was only the 14th that you posted that   
&gt;but I'm intrigued.  I know much of the stuff I just said you had already   
&gt;talked about previously.  Not trying to be redundant, just trying to get   
&gt;it out in the open for others to read.  Here are some good articles on   
&gt;Dometics that I found in our own archives.
