&gt; Hello again gang,
&gt; the sound has gone away.  So I can't experiment to find conditions to make
&gt; it come again ... but now here's a real stumper ...
&gt; Although I'm not the kind who takes drugs I'd swear that when I drive my
&gt; vanagon through snow (which is falling rapidly) that around 25-30 mph,
&gt; the world takes on a different sence.  Instead of me driving on the road,
&gt; the road is going under me while I am standing still.  This same 
&gt; sensation hits my wife also ... and almost at the same speed.
&gt; Has anyone else noticed this ?  It is not something I have ever noticed with
&gt; another vehicle.  For those that have noticed this, what do you do to
&gt; return your concentration to reality?
&gt; Perhaps it is just that the vanagon runs so smoothly at 30 mph.  Perhaps
&gt; it's too much propane.  Who knows?

I have noticed this especially when the snow is falling heavily and the
head lights are on and it is dark all around. I think its a combination of the
huge windscreen which gives a cineramic kind of view and the snow falling
towards the van which creates the perception of it moving towards you. You
get a similar sensation sitting in a train which is not moving but the one
beside it, is.....DC
