Subject: '77 f.i. stalls when hot

Volks,
When I drive more than about 40 miles non-stop, the van runs great, no prob.
But if I turn off the engine, go into a store for a few minutes and restart,
it won't idle. If I barely touch the foot pedal it's enough to keep it alive.
I suspect the head temp. sender but have no ohm meter to check it. Then last 
night I turned me ear this way and that and began to imagine the bearing
behind the fan (would that be the main bearing??) is sort of squelling intermittantly. Theory: the motor heats up evenly when driving. Stop the motor and thingscool at variable rates. Start again and parts start to rub, creating more 
friction which is enough to stall the engine.

Am I off my rocker? I turned the idle adjustiment up a hair but have not tested
this variable yet.

Any comments are greatly appreciated.
