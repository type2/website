Subject: Syncro rf CV Replaced, Now Mainshaft Noise?

Hi All,

I'm still working on acquiring an 87 Syncro from a sorta nearby automotive
VoTech instructor.  The rf CV went out after some clicking noise.  This
morning he replaced the CV, but now there is a noise that he suspects is
a mainshaft or mainshaft brg noise where there wasn't one before.  He is
going to look into it further before I come out to test drive (it's about
2.5 hours away).  He says the noise occurs under a load somewhere in the
drivetrain, but it is not the ring &amp; pinion based upon his mechanical
experience.  Any thoughts on this matter?  Anything I, as a buyer, should
look out for on this?  He still states it is a 4 speed, no granny low etc.
Hmmm...,
