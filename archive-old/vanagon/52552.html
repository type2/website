hey hey now!!

thats unfair! i dont feel that VW ever claimed that the Beetle was a 
totally original totally theirs concept, and advertised on TV tht nothing 
else inthe word had every looked at all like it!!

&lt;or does my memory not serve to well...&gt;

sure, some individuals hae probably claimed it, but, i dont think the 
company ever accualy issued a statement like Chrysler and Chevy have..

&quot;The first pickup truck with 3 doors!&quot; sure...

&quot;The First Minivan&quot;..oh yeah, that right..VW called theirs a microbus, 
didnt they..:)

and, for all i care, they can damn well take credit for the autostick!
which, btw, i dont think VW invented either..and, i doubt that the bus 
was the first small van, although i dont know my histroy of Euro and 
Asian cars too well..


anyhhow....VW really ought to press charges...:)

not saying that they had it first, but just to prove that it existed 
before...and that these american car giants are just using their monopoly 
to make false calims....

as for me, i gotta stop rambling..:)

&gt;  How about the 1933 Airflow?  Rumoured to be the inspiration for the shape of
&gt;  a certain German vehicle produced a few years later, the Airflow was viewed by
&gt; many in it's introductory year, including a Dr. Porsche...
