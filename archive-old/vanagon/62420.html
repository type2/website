&quot;Am I missing something here?  I think that I can buy a Porsche 915 for 
under $1,000.  I think that I would have to fabricate a front mount, a
bell housing adapter and get some custom length axles, but it probably
wouldn't come near $2,200.&quot;

Interesting idea.  If somebody has access to the torque ratings on
Porshe gear boxes, that might be great information since any
substantially higher torque engine than the stock gas motor in vans
should have a tougher trans too.  Eg. Subaru SVX flat six.
