&gt; only a problem for one right now, but I don't see the future
&gt; for this situation getting any better.  At this point I'd be

I think RMMW has one for about... $125!!!!!  

&gt; Since VW changed mid-year (my early (#008082) still has the
&gt; single circuit cylinder), would it make any sense to convert
&gt; to that or a '68 and later cylinder?

Is it really worth the extra $100?  If you find them cheaper (alot 
cheaper!), let me know, I'll put one in my '66.
