Subject: Re: beware of parking garages!

I have never relied on the bar height alone but rather the bar height plus
the stated clearance in feet or meters.  The owners manual states the
height in both measures.  I use 2.1 meters as a minimum height and have
never had problems.  Anyone else out there have clearance stories and/or
tips?

&gt;Last weekend I attended a conference in the D.C. area where I stayed
&gt;at a hotel with a basement parking garage. Since this was the only
&gt;parking the hotel offered free, I very slowly and carefully pulled the
&gt;van ('87 Westy) up to the overhead yellow barrier indicating the
&gt;amount of clearance required to park in the garage. I jumped out and
&gt;inspected the situation and ascertained that I had about 4 inches to
&gt;spare to get under the bar.
&gt;
&gt;Well, call me naive, but I said &quot;OK - go for it&quot;. I rolled under the
&gt;barrier AOK, then proceeded (very slowly) down the entrance ramp and
&gt;made a right-hand turn into the garage proper. As I was approaching
&gt;the ticket-dispensing machine it happened - scraping sounds from the
&gt;roof area!
&gt;
&gt;Oh dear. I immediately stopped and inspected the situation; the garage
&gt;ceiling was smooth so the distance btw. the ceiling and floor was
&gt;obviously narrowing. Well I wasn't wedged in (if I had been it would
&gt;have been let-some-air-out-of-the-tires-time), so I began the process
&gt;of reversing out of the garage. And that was a very tedious,
&gt;nerve-racking experience which wasn't helped much by the fact that
&gt;there were 2 cars behind me that had to reverse out as well!
&gt;
&gt;No real damage was done to the van, so there's a happy ending to this
&gt;tale.
&gt;
&gt;Moral of the story? Don't blindly trust those height barriers at
&gt;parking garages!
