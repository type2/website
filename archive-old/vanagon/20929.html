Subject: auto-choke\transistorized ignition\pizza in oregon...

    dear fellow bus fanatics,
now that we've once again recovered from friday-mania, here's two more
technical morsels i'd like to toss out to you...
    1. THE AUTOCHOKE. i have a 73 westy with the usual 1700cc twin carbs
engine (okay joel, you don't have to ask, his name is festus after the
deputy in &quot;gunsmoke&quot;...). the problem is the idle: it idles just fine when
warm, but when i start it up cold in the morning it idles way too fast,
maybe 2000-3000rpm from the sound of it. now, being no COMPLEAT moron, i've
checked the autochokes and they seem to work okay...flaps closed when cold,
opening up completely after a few minutes. i was wondering if there is any
way to adjust the autochokes to make it run slower during warmup...maybe so
the flaps don't close quite as much when cold ??? any suggestions ???
    2. TRANSISTORIZED IGNITION. someone mentioned putting in a
transistorized ignition to do away with the notoriously unreliable points
gap adjustment...any reason not to do that ? or any suggestions as to which
particular transistorized ignition is particularly good ? i understand most
have centrifugal advance only, so i'd have to plug the vacuum hoses to the
carbs. does the beast run well with that ??? i don't wanna screw up anything
that actually works around here...

  okay, there's some food for thought for you...speaking of food: since all
bus-owners in all parts of the country seem to have this inexplicable craving
for pizza these days: anyone wanna have a bus/pizza meet around here in
oregon ??? let's hear it !
                            peace,
                                    gregor (73 westy &quot;festus&quot;)
