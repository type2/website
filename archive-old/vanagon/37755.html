&gt;My '80 Vanagon needs the exhaust system replaced.  The van has a catalytic
&gt;converter and my city (Spokane, WA) has stringent emissions testing.  The van
&gt;presently does pass emissions testing even though the cat is almost certainly
&gt;useless (rotted out).  To avoid future potential hassles, I am willing to 
&gt;try and restore the factory exhaust system; ie. Replace the existing components
&gt;and retain the catalytic conveter.  However, a check with the dealer indicates
&gt;that the crossover pipe is no longer available.  I called Bus Boys and they no
&gt;longer have any.  
&gt;
&gt;Is it possible to fabricate the crossover pipe?  Could a good muffler shop (not
&gt;Midas) construct one?  The crossover pipe is quite complicated.  The name is 
&gt;misleading.  It is not a pipe, but more of a manifold connecting the exhaust
&gt;headers from both sides of the engine.  It also has an integral  U-shaped pipe 
&gt;on the driver's side which connects to the cat (and subsequently the muffler). 
&gt;
&gt;So what is the general consensus?  Can such a part be fabricated?
&gt;

Alas and alack, I faced this very same situation on my '82 Westy.  I contacted
every supplier I could think of, and had all of them check their sources, all
to no avail.  The crossover pipe is no more.

&quot;No sweat,&quot; thought I, I'll have it fabricated.  Time for a reality check.  No
muffler shop can make it because they aren't equipped to bend pipe sharply
enough for that unique &quot;J&quot; shape.  Several metal shops I took it to declined to
try.  The thing is not really made out of pipe, but rather a series of metal
stampings that are welded together.  Ok, there's one straight length of pipe in
it.  Anyway, I dead-ended on having one made!

Like you, I was concerned about emissions; Minnesota has strict laws and
inspections, so the &quot;extractor&quot;-type exhaust everyone kept referring me to
didn't seem like a solution.  Then I discovered the loophole.  In Minnesota,
if you convert your registration to RV plates, no emissions inspection
is required.  As an added bonus, your annual tax goes from a percentage of the
value of the vehicle to a flat fee based on GVW.

To make a long story short, that's what I ended up doing:  Converted to RV
plates, and installed a &quot;C5 extractor&quot; exhaust system for a mere $150, which 
fit perfectly, and although slightly louder than stock (my opinion), at least 
I don't sound like I'm riding a Harley around town any more.

As an environmentally aware person, I'm not happy about losing the catalytic,
but there's just no other solution out there.  I suppose one could rationalize
that since the vehicle is an RV, it gets driven infrequently, and thus
contributes relatively little polution... hmmm...

If somebody could be found who _could_ make these pipes, they'd get a lot of
business.  With all the '80-83 Vanagons still on the road, there have to be
thousands of folks who will face this problem sooner or later.
