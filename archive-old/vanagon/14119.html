&gt;A friend of mine may have an 82 parts Vanagon available soon. I was
&gt;curiuos if the 4-speed in it would fit in my 83 Wasserboxer. The 83
&gt;crunches gears when shifting unless you really baby it and I thought this
&gt;might be a cheap fix. Do you think it will fit without too much
&gt;reengineering?

the story i heard was that the air-cools had an 091 transmission, and the
water-cools had an 091/1. supposedly they are the same transmission, same
size, etc., but the water-cooled buses have different transmission mounts
and (because the water-cooled engine is shorter than the air-cooled engine)
the transmission is mounted in a different place (to make the cv-joint
angles &quot;better&quot;).

so the first thing you'll need to check is whether the two have the same
mounting positions.
