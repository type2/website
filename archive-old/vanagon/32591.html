Subject: Re: Testing Bosch O2 sensors.addendum

re-reading my post i see that article forgot to emphasize an 
important point:

Have the ignition off when disconnecting or connecting the O2 sensor. 
 This is important for 2 reasons:  1-  it protects the computer from 
any transient voltage spikes during the connecting, and 2- the ECU 
can store mixture information if the sensor is disconnected/connected 
while the engine is running and throw off your rich/lean tests.
