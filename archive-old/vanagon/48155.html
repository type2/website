In a message dated 96-08-09 12:35:15 EDT, you write:

&lt;&lt; 
 &gt;    Anyone out there know anything about a 5 speed trans. put into Canadian
 &gt;'84 gas Vanagons. I have a chance to buy one that I plan to put into my 
 
 No 5 speeds ever stock in gas vanagons in this country(Canada), in Euro
 likely avail, same South Africa.  Might be from an '83 CDN diesel. The bell
 housings are different, so if it truly is from a gas engined van you'll need
 to swap your diesel bell housing onto it. Bentley devotes a big section to
 this trans alone, model 094, so I'd guess it's got some significant
 differences from 091 and 091/1 4 spds.  Also if it is from a gas engined van
 then the ring and pinion ratio will likely be too tall for your diesel (fine
 for TDI? :).  Supposedly top speed in diesel is 75mph_at_5000rpm vs
 89mph_at_5200rpm for gas (for 4spd boxes).
 
 One point to consider, is this a close ratio 5 speed, or is it normal ratio
 with higher top gear.  I looked in Bentley, but ratios for 4spds given only
 (older Bentley).  I was going for a 5spd trans in an old Porsche, until I
 realized that the top gear ratio was the same as 4spd in it already.
 Would've helped the up-shifting/power but hard to justify the $$$$.

Tim and All,

The trans case say's 091 but it is a 5 speed. I don't know what to make of
it!

Cancel everything I just said. I just got off the phone with Tom _at_ TomCat
Auto in Canada, He knows all about this tranny. He said, it's the same as a
091 but VW hung the same 5th gear as is in the '90 Jetta. Sooo.... seems like
that would be a 1:1 final drive, with a lot closer ratio than what I now
have. :-) The pursuit continues...
