STATE DEPARTMENT TRAVEL INFORMATION - Canada
============================================================
Canada - Consular Information Sheet
 July 23, 1996

Country Description:  Canada is a highly developed stable
democracy.  Tourist facilities are widely available except in
northern and wilderness areas, where they are less developed and can
be vast distances apart.

Entry Requirements:  For information on entry requirements,
travelers can contact the Embassy of Canada at 501 Pennsylvania
Avenue, N.W., Washington, DC 20001, (202) 682-1740 or the nearest
Canadian consulate in Atlanta, Boston, Buffalo, Chicago, Dallas,
Detroit, Los Angeles, Miami, Minneapolis, New York, San Juan or
Seattle.  Please note that due to international concern over child
abduction, single parents, grandparents or guardians traveling with
children often need proof of custody or notarized letters from the
other parent authorizing travel.  Anyone under age 18 and traveling
alone should carry a letter from his/her parent or guardian
authorizing the trip.

Medical Facilities:  Good medical care is widely available.  U.S.
medical insurance may not be valid in Canada.  Travelers have found
that in some cases, supplemental medical insurance with specific
Canadian coverage has proven useful.  Further information on health
matters can be obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention's international travelers hotline (404) 332-4559 or visit
the CDC home page on the Internet at http://www.cdc_dot_gov.

Crime Information:  There is a higher incidence of criminal
activity in urban areas.  However, violent crimes such as murder,
armed robbery, and rape are infrequent.  The loss or theft of a U.S.
passport abroad should be reported immediately to the local police
and the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate.  U.S. citizens can refer
to the Department of State's pamphlet, &quot;A Safe Trip Abroad&quot; for ways
to promote a more trouble-free journey.  Additional information on
Canada can be found in the brochure &quot;Tips for Travelers to Canada&quot;
or on the Consular Affairs Internet site at http://travel.state_dot_gov.
 Both publications are available from the Superintendent of
Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington  D.C. 20402.

Drug Penalties:  U.S. citizens are subject to Canadian laws while
in Canada.  Penalties for possession, use, and dealing in illegal
drugs are strict, and convicted offenders can expect jail sentences
and fines.

Road and Traffic Information:  Road safety is excellent.  U.S.
driver's licenses are valid in Canada.  Proof of auto insurance is
required.  Driving under the influence of alcohol is a serious
offense.  Penalties are heavy and any prior conviction (no matter
how long ago or how minor the infraction) is grounds for exclusion
from Canada.  A waiver of exclusion may be obtained from Canadian
consulates in the United States, but requires several weeks.  It is
illegal to take automobile radar detectors into Quebec, Ontario,
Manitoba or the Yukon and Northwest territories.  The police will
confiscate radar detectors, whether in use or not, and impose fines
up to $1000.

Other Information:  Firearms are strictly controlled.  In general,
handguns, pepper spray and mace are not permitted.  Anyone wishing
to bring hunting rifles can contact in advance the nearest Canadian
consulate for detailed information and instructions.  In all cases,
travelers must declare to Canadian Customs authorities any firearms
in their possession when entering Canada.  If a traveler is denied
permission to bring the firearm in, there are in many cases
facilities near border crossings where firearms may be stored
pending the traveler's return to the U.S.  Canadian law requires
that officials confiscate guns from those crossing the border who
deny having guns in their possession.  Confiscated guns are never
returned.

Registration and Embassy/Consulate Locations:  U.S. citizens who
register in the Consular Section at the U.S. Embassy or at a U.S.
Consulate may obtain updated information on travel and security
within Canada.

The U.S. Embassy is located in Ottawa, Ontario at 100 Wellington
Street, telephone (613) 238-5335.

U.S. Consulates are located at:

Calgary, Alberta at 615 Macleod Trail SE, (403) 266-8962;

Halifax, Nova Scotia at Suite 910, Cogswell Tower, Scotia Square,
(902) 429-2480;

Montreal, Quebec at 1155 St. Alexander Street, (514) 398-9695;

Quebec City, Quebec at 2 Place Terrasse Dufferin, (418) 692-2095;

Toronto, Ontario at 360 University Avenue, (416) 595-1700,

Vancouver, British Columbia at 1095 West Pender Street, (604)
685-4311.

 No. 96-135

This replaces the Consular Information Sheet dated May 11, 1995, to
update the section on entry requirements and the list of Canadian
consulates in the U.S. and to add a section on road and traffic
conditions.
