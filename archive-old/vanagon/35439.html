&gt; I am in need of an engine as faithful readers are already aware.  I would
&gt; like to get one that matches the year of my bus (1969).  Does anyone have
&gt; any suggestions?  For junkyard/dismantler suggestions I am in Northern
&gt; California in Stockton which is 1 hour south of Sacramento.

I like Pozzi's in Sacramento; thats where I got mine.
