Subject: Re: height question

&gt;what is the height of a '70's westfalia, with stock tires, 
&gt;suspension,etc? (yes, this is a will-it-fit-in-the-garage question)

&gt;i know the bus was originally 1.9meters but wasn't sure about the 
&gt;camper conversion. i don't (yet) have one handy to measure...

&gt;just point me to a source if that's easier. don't want to make you 
&gt;all run to your garages with tape measures. :)

&gt;thanks much
&gt;Carolyn Cullen

    -I have a '71 Devon conversion which I had to measure the height 
of when I booked a ferry. It was 2m exactly. Hope this helps.
