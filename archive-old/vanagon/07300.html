Subject: RE: ftp site and gopher still down

&gt;From: Gerald Skerbitz &lt;gsker_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu&gt;

&gt; No new disk, so the ftp site and the gopher are still down.
&gt; I'll keep you posted via this channel.
&gt; If nothing comes in tomorrow, I'll reestablish the thing on another disk.

Did you forget to repack its cv joints?  ;-)

Funny thing,  I was gophering it during my lunch hour (1:30pm EST) on Monday 
and was wondering why it was taking so long to bring up articles.  I was 
going to send you a message when I was finished half hour later.  But after
that you had sent out messages if anybody had saved the directory screens.
I guess that answers my questions on what was happening.
