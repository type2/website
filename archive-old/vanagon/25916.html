Subject: Looking for a project?

... have I got one for you!

With the recent westy purchase draining the checkbook I've decided to
sell my panel.

Heres the info:
1961 double door panel(last year for bullet turnsignals and glass tail lenses?)
rusty rockers.
minor dents and dings.
no engine ,but I have something around that would go in it.

$500/bo

The van is near Pittsburgh Pa., I can deliver.

Lemme know if your interested, thanks.
