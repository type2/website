First, let me say to all the helpful people on this list 'thank you' for 
all of your information.  Second let me say........

I GOT IT---I GOT IT

Yes ladies and gentlemen, you are talking ,er--um-- reading the message of
the proud owner of a 79 Westfalia.  I got the guy to give her to me for
$2700 (after lots of haggling) and she is worth more pennies than I paid
for her.  (BTW. why is she/it a her?) So now my job is a sanding and a
priming and a painting.  The overall plan is to have it painted like a
huge dive flag, but I am not sure If I will yet--kinda leary of the jeers
I may get.  Oh as the the location stats add me in there somewhere.  I
believe that makes 2 or three from tennessee....Maybe we could break that
down into cities :). Someone had mentioned having instructions on
patching/recontitioning the canvas camper top, it has been a while and I
nolonger have the post so could I get some mail from that kind person. 
Here is a question....  The propane tank on the camper has never ever been
filled..... does it need some kind of inspection like a scuba tank would
or is it ok? 

And again thanks for all of the information.
Rick.
P.S.  I am in the process of writing a gif to txt converter, this may 
      help me out in the ascii art department as I am horrible.
