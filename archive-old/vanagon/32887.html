&gt; Are Eurovans that bad?   :-)


No, they're just more expensive and harder to work on!

Seriously though, consider that:
- the microbus was available in US for approx 10 years (57? - 67)
- the bus was available in US for 11 years (68 - 79)
- the van was available in US for 12 years (80 - 92)
- the eVan was available in US for 2 years (93, then the 95 Camper)


my definitions and dates may be slightly off, and I don't have statistics for
actual production figures. I know that EVs have not sold well, in part
because they were expensive, in part because they were diss'ed by Consumer
Reports and other trade publications because they weren't more like the
other minivans sweeping the market. They built it on a truck chassis, and
lo and behold, it drives like a truck - not a station wagon! Actually it
feels remarkably similar to the Vanagon, only with more power. (Well, the
front end doesn't raise up so much when you hit the gas either!)

just my US$.02,
