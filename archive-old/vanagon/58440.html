Subject: Recalls, Etc,

I just found a neat way to report defects to NHTSA ... Car-Talk's site
includes the following:

Complain to NHTSA: Experiencing a nasty, on-going problem
               with your jalopy? Let the world know by filing an online
               complaint with NHTSA, the National Highway Traffic Safety
               Administration. NHTSA's complaint database forms
the 	       basis for all-important recalls and technical
service 	       bulletins. Help
               keep a government bureaucrat busy by sending them
               something today!

The address is:

I think we should all complain about the fuel leaks Vanagons develop
when the plastic thingees rot on top of the fuel tank. Most of us have
had to pull the tank or risk a fire, it is a known problem which VW has
made our problem and their money-maker. At dealer prices it costs about
$300.00 to fix, and the nice thing about it is that it will happen again
later.

Any thoughts about the effectivness of 600+ emails to NHTSA about this?
