Subject: Re: external head leak

My '91 dumped all its ccolant New Year's Eve.  The only prior symptom was a
slight coolant smell from the rear heater vents.  $2000 to repair at the
dealer.
This after replacing the transmission last summer, for a broken pinion gear.
You're right, the wasserboxers have been less than stellar.  I think this
is a case of defective design.  VWoA so far has said &quot;Too bad, you bought
it&quot;
tk

&gt;Like most other Vanagons at some time in their lives, my '91 is =
&gt;suffering from external head leaks.  Mine only leaks in the winter =
&gt;though..  The last two years, as soon as the temps stay 40 or above, the =
&gt;leaking stops.  I had to fill up the reservoir every two weeks or so =
&gt;during the winter.
&gt;
&gt;I'm just curious if anyone else found this to be the case.  Maybe it =
&gt;gets worse as time goes on.  Any feelings on how quickly the leaks go =
&gt;from being tolerable to intolerable?  I know different people have =
&gt;different thresholds.  I don't want to poison all the neighborhood cats =
&gt;and dogs, but I also don't want to spend $2000.   It has 80k miles on =
&gt;it.
&gt;
&gt;I've been a VW addict for the last 13 years or so, but I'd have to say =
&gt;that my other VWs (Rabbit, Jetta II, and Cabriolet) have been way more =
&gt;bullet proof than the Vanagon.  I don't mind replacing worn out parts =
&gt;like shocks, tie rods, ball joints, even cv joints, etc, since I can do =
&gt;them myself.  I resent this head leak, though, since it's a known =
&gt;Vanagon problem, very expensive to have someone fix, and  somewhat over =
&gt;my head (no pun intended) to repair myself (and still expensive if I =
&gt;need new heads).  I guess I'll have to try fighting with VWoA on this.  =
&gt;I know people have had mixed results with this.
&gt;
&gt;I've been on the list for a couple of months and have enjoyed it.  This =
&gt;is my first entry.  Thanks for any info (or sympathy or whatever),=20
