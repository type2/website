Subject:       Vanagon Dbl Cabs! (an omen... ?)

Just got back from lunch, and saw *three* (yes THREE) double cab 
Vanagons, and one was (I think) a Tri-Star!

All 86-up models, two white ones, one was a company vehicle.

The Tri-Star was burgundy, with a roof rack, and *FOUR* doors (it 
passed me twice as I waited at KFC...)
And it was a syncro, so I guess this makes it a Tri-Star, right?

Cool. I wonder if this means something.

(Or, it could be 'cause my wife &amp; I just returned from our (her?) 
first ultra sound - saw our baby's heart beating, so we were a 
little stranger than normal. Only 16 years to find the perfect 
bus for her/him!)

See ya.
