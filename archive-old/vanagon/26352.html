Subject: R-12 stockpiled with no place to go...
Date: Thu, 17 Aug 1995 06:34:17 GMT


Someone was lamenting that they couldn't GET R-12. Well, go figure. A
couple of years ago I read, way in the back of my local newspaper, that
R-12 would be banned in a year or so time. So, being the owner of a
bunch of older American Iron (at that time) I went down and loaded up on
the stuff. I even bought a decent gauge set to be able to install it....

Fast forward a few years. Time and finances have chanced and I'm the
ower of three VWs...nothing else. No air, nada.

Now I've got all this stuff and it is, I understand, illegal to sell it.

So, you may be in a bad way, but I can't even peddle this stuff that I
bought legally. I mistakenly thought they weren't going to MAKE it
anymore. I see that you can still get it at your local AC shop.

Oh, well....

Robb
