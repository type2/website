As my old Latin teacher used to say, &quot;Get out of here! You're
not taking this class!!!&quot;

RustyVanBondo sez:
Joel and I must have had the same Latin teacher...

At Alhambra High, Home of the Lions, it was required (just in case) that
everyone study a foreign language prior to graduation. Just like everyone
else, I originally wanted to take 'Spanish' but the classes were full. I was
so stupid that I thought that 'Latin' was the next best thing. Hey, using my
misspent time and knowledge from the Geometry theorms and &quot;proofs&quot;, I
surmised that if 'Spanish'='Latin Culture' then 'Latin'='Spanish'.
Everyone at high school was constantly deciding on what their career was
going to be. If I was stuck in Latin class then I decided I was going to be
either a Priest or a Lawyer. One of the choices pleased my mother the other
pleased my father. That was before I discovered women and the art of
negotiations which rather pleased me from time to time!
Latin Class was right after lunch with Mr. M. M. Mike Mulligan. (M.M.M.M.M.)
Mr. M. M. Mike Mulligan looked like somone off the Mary Hartman, Mary
Hartman TV show. He was skinny, balding, wore hornrimmed bifocals, had
allergies or asthsma, and had a mustache and sta-sta-stammered. Not funny in
it's self but he had a major nervous twitch in his eyes which affected his
mustache. I mean, the guy looked and acted like a four foot neon tube that
was about to go out. Winking and blinking, twitching and itching and
sta-sta-stammering, it was difficult to concentrate and be serious.

The typical foreign language drill session was happening. Every student took
a phrase or sentence out of the book and read/repeated it out loud. I was
getting increasingly nervous as my turn approached. My sophmore pride was at
stake. &quot;Salway Magestor, Salway Magestra,&quot; Mr. M. M. Mike Mulligan the
teacher sta-sta-stammered as he was winking and blinking, twitching and
itching. It was my turn to recite the words that the teacher had just
spoken. For the first time in my life I had chosen not to play the class
clown and say it right. I opened my mouth to say &quot;Salway Magestor, Salway
Magestra.&quot; Intead, the world's largest,loudest,rudest,involuntary belch came
flying out of my face! (Tim what's-his-name the Tooltime/Home Improvement
guy would have called it a &quot;vurp.&quot;)
Mr. M. M. Mike Mulligan, the winking and blinking, twitching and itching
teacher came completely unglued! &quot;Get out of my class and go to the
Principal's Office!!!&quot;, h,h,he sta-sta-stammered! I tried to explain that I
had not vurped intentionally, and that I never could figure out how to burp
at will or fart from my under arms like Peter Kingsley. Every explaination
and plea for understanding was rebuffed by Mr. Mulligan. The class was
instantly in total pandamonium! The choice was quickly negotiated to either
leave Mr. M. M. Mike Mulligan's La,La,Latin class and tranfer into the young
good looking Miss Tate's &quot;General Business&quot; class or stay in Latin class and
spend a month in detention period after school. Of course my Law career was
instantly doomed and being celibate wasn't in my plans and didn't raise it's
ugly head again until after I got married. Thanks to Miss Tate I have become
adept at balancing check book, watching the Stock page so I can see what the
folks with Monopoly monies are buying and secured my Social Security number.
Oh well, &quot;C'est LaVie&quot; I say! ;)
