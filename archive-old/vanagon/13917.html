Subject: Minor oddity

Here's a little mystery.  Otto, the 79 Bus (50,000 on a rebuilt 2000,
161,000 mi. total, completely stock) has, for reasons known only unto
himself, started getting getting 19-20 MPG in combined driving, and 21-23 on
the highway.  This has been consistent now for over a month.  I've not done
anything, mechanical or otherwise, except putting in a new battery 2 weeks
ago.  Ever since I bought this Bus, the gas mileage has been 16-17 combined
and 18 or 19 on trips.  These figures are based on reality, as I keep track
of the mpg's with each fill-up.  I'm not complaining, but this seems a
little weird.  

What's the collective wisdom?
