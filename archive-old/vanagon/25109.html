Subject: Re: win prizes! name that noise!

&gt;&gt;hello everyone, here's my problem of this week (81 adventurewagen):
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;a chirping noise, only when engine has warmed (after driving a few
&gt;&gt;minutes).  the noise is most apparent at lower rpms in 1st and 2nd, but i
&gt;&gt;can sometimes hear it in 3rd and at higher rpms in 1st and 2nd. i have not
&gt;&gt;heard it in 4th.

How about:

1.  No grease on distributor cam lobes?

2.  Worn/loose alternator belt?
