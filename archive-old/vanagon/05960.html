Subject:  My bus engine(again)




        I have had the engine out of my bus since August.  After tearing
the lil 2.0L apart, I 'found' that the mains were gone, the cam worn
out, lifters worn, heads needed redone, needs new wrist pin bushings,
and of course new pistons and cylinders.


        So basically, my question is, rebuild this engine?
        Or buy a remanufactured one?

        I think the rebuild would cost about $700-800ish, possibly
more.  I am a bit leary of remanufactured engines for some reason.
The warranty for 12,000 miles would last me about 4 months....not
exactly what I would call a long time.


        I would like about 80k out of it....am I dreaming?
