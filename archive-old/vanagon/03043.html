&gt;Probably a bit of both. Of the twenty or so Westfalia's we
&gt;&quot;interviewed&quot; for purchase in CA half were on their second or third
&gt;engine. There are multiple reasons for this but the main one seems to
&gt;be that FI/OXS system burns out the valves around 80,000 miles.

I have over 100K on my air cooled vanagon and the pressure in all cylinders
is right around 125 lbs..
