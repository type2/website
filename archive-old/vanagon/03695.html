Subject: Shocks

    Thanks to everyone who responded to my loose steering problem, I 
    tightened the screw/locknut on the steering box and it's much 
    better. The rest of the steering assembly is tight as a bee.
    
    While I was down under there I got to thinking, &quot;hmmm... these 
    shocks kinda need replacing.  The ride is getting a bit bouncey, 
    if not erotic.  And it would improve the handling&quot;.
    
    The last time I replaced the shocks I went to a VW dealer.  I'm 
    wondering if there are cheaper after-market shocks for my '72 
    kamper?  What make &amp; specs do you recommend?  I drive in the city 
    mostly, but on occassion head out over logging roads. The various 
    books and manuals I looked through don't provide after-market 
    info.  Maybe I should get a better book.
    
    Any thoughts??
    
    Thanks again
    Eric
