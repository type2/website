Just another lil' point ... 

&gt; Eurovan   27 - Camper   8, Panel    0, Pickup   0, Diesel   1

Wouldn't the new blue thing really be a &quot;Diesel Panel&quot;?  (Hur hur.)

And do I win a prize for being the most unique?  

IRE - 1
91 EV - 1
Diesel - 1

... or perhaps the most ridiculous?  :) 

The figures you folks give for fuel consumption is *really* scary.  The new
blue thing is giving 45 mpg (imperial gallons *are* a little bigger than US
gallons but it's still very high.)

111,000 miles passed yesterday.  6,000 miles past service point.  Uh-oh.
