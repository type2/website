Subject: 56 Single-cab FS Sighted

Taking a different route than usual to the postoffice today, I spotted a
blue split-window 56 single cab VW pickup. For Sale sign in window asking
$3,000.
Phone (619) 460-8033.

It's in El Cajon, CA.

That's all I know. That and that my 68 Dual-cab is enough to keep me
occupied just now. So I guess I'll go back to the old route.  %^)
