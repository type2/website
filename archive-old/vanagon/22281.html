&gt; I'm going insane.
&gt;
&gt; My SO needed a car toady (BMW Belly Up Again) so I lent her the 911!  I
&gt; wouldn't have even _thought_ to let her use the bus.  Is this proof I'm going
&gt; insane?

Nope. Shows that you are in compleat control of your mental faculties. My wife
has yet to drive either the Notch or the Van!! She drives either the 85 K-car
wagon (120k miles and was declared a total by State Farm) or the 85 Cavalier
(90k)! Although, if I had a 911, I dont what I would do then....
