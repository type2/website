Subject: Re: sport racks on Westys


&gt;For kayaks, the only solution I see is Thule gutter racks with the long
&gt;feet. These will attach to the gutters on the Vanagon and rise above the
&gt;poptop. The main drawback is that you have to remove the racks to raise the
&gt;top. Not a big problem really when you consider that you will most likely
&gt;be driving to a destination and then removing the kayaks for a while. I
&gt;carried two triple sea kayaks with this setup on my '74 this past summer.
&gt;Cruised to Lund, BC from Seattle with no problems at all--the racks were
&gt;rock solid. I wouldnt want to use this setup for skis because the racks
&gt;interfere with raising the poptop.
&gt;
&gt;Any other opinions out there?

I am using four Yakima 'wide body brackets' (adapters) screwed on(in)to the
corners of the pop top (and supported by larger metal 'counter'plates from
the inside) to put on the regular high Yakima raingutter rack system. Have
carried up to four single / two double sea kayaks on it w/o any problems,
exept for the inconvenience of loading and unloading &lt;grin&gt;. However, I
always use additional straps to hold down the poptop, and bow- and
sternlines to keep poptop, racks, and gear on the van! You have to remove
the kayaks to pop up the top, but can leave the racks on!
