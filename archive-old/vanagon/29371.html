Subject: Source for Westy Cabinet Edging

Does anone know where you can get the
soft plastic edging material used on the '87
and newer Vanagon Westy cabinets ?

I checked out the dealer and it is available
for $32 per meter (what an outragious price).
For the amount I need it would be cheaper
to go into manufacturing it myself.

Does anybody else need some ?

My alternative is have a good cabinet shop
make up some oak edging and stain it grey.
This would be much cheaper than buying the
original material from a dealer and it would
probably look better with the wood grained
edging.

Any other thoughts out there ?

Thanks in advance !
