Subject: Re:Thermostat

Hi Tom and other thermostaters !
  i'd definitely agree on that one...even if you choose to disconnect your
thermostat, you definitely wanna leave the air flaps in there !
        gregor

&gt; remove the air- vanes that the thermostat
&gt; controls?&quot;. If you did, find some old ones and get them in there! They are
&gt; necessary! I have wired those things wide open with no apparent bad effects, but
&gt; on an engine that I built (my first one-at 15 years old!) I took the advice of
&gt; the mechanic that told me to scrap all that stuff. Engine lasted 26,000 and died
&gt; due to chronic overheating. Always detonated like crazy on the highway. I
&gt; learned.
