Subject:      85 transporter no vanagon

Hi Folks.   I'm just back from a week long bush wack in the great
Northern Ontario!  In the bush I stumbled across a german guy with an 85
transport for sale.  Now I may have the termnology wrong... but this is
the vw product that is a &quot;pick up&quot; in ordinary speak.  It looks like a
truncated westy!

The vehicle looked to be in excellent condition... a four speed tranny
with 168k kilometres.  He is the one and only owner, has had it serviced
by the VW dealer in Sault Ste. Marie Ontario Canada.  Al the usual
papers ... yadda yadda.  Its a single cab dealy.

He's asking 3500 canadian dollars.  Apparently he justy purchased a
trailer and the transporter's a little underpowered to tow the thing.

I thought I'd post it in case anyone one was curious.  Is you are...
give me a call... I stupidly left the guys phone number back atr the
house and I'm at work checking the mail...
