Hi everyone, 

May name is Adam Sidky and for the past few months I've been a steady lurker
on both vanagon mailing lists.  Well just yesterday I bought a 74 Westy (or
is it actually called a Transporter?) and have a few questions about some of
the 'features' inside.  First of all how does the sink work?  There is the
plastic water reservoir underneath the sink but is there an electric pump to
pump the water up through the faucet or do I just whip that handle next to
the faucet back and forth to get the pump to work.  Secondly the fridge has
been disconnected (says the previous owner) and I'm not too sure what to do
about getting it working again.  Do I need some sort of special tool to
light the pilot light?  All I've seen on the side of the fridge (next to the
passenger's seat) is a switch with a 12V and 110V label and a little red
knob.  How do I go about trying to light the fridge.  And finally for the
110 V setting doesn't this mean that it runs when the Westy is plugged in?
I've hunted around for a plug but I can't seem to find one anywhere that
plugs into a normal socket; was this an option or what is going on.  Thanks
in advance and I'm pretty sure that I'll be asking many more questions so
please bear with me.

Thanks,

Adam Sidky
