Subject: Re[2]: Manassas VA Bugout. Coming?



&gt;&gt; will probably try to be there just to meet you guys. The only problem
&gt;&gt;is I probably cannot drive my Vanagon since I am still looking
&gt;&gt;for a catalytic converter and complete exhaust system before the
&gt;&gt;shoebox can pass inspection. Anybody knows where I can get something
&gt;&gt;for less than the $900.00 Vw is charging?

      Once again, Bob Hoy ad has a closeout. In Hot VW's, in the clearance
      sections is Vanagon catalytic converter for $175.00. Pg 102 in March
      issue. (800) 289-4697
