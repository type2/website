Eric is correct that a danger is there that the bus might be in gear 
when remotely started.  The only time I EVER leave it in gear is when 
parking on hill.  I make sure my parking break always works.  Also 
when working on the bus in my driveway I chock the wheels too.
I was more concerned with problems of the electrical nature.
By using a jumper instead of a hard wired switch for the power, it is 
quick and easy to yank on the wire to kill engine, instead of fumbling 
for a switch.  Thanks for the warning.

&gt;     This is DANGEROUS!!!!!!!!!   I have seen people do this, with just
&gt;     temperary switchs.  After an hour or so of playing with something,
&gt;     and driving the car around a bit,  they forget that they left the 
&gt;     car in gear, and try to start the thing. Most of the time they 
&gt;     get lucky and It don't start.

&gt;     never use one.!!!
