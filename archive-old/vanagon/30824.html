I don't care if it rains or freezes
'Long as I got my plastic Jesus
Riding on the dashboard of by bus.....


I DO have a plastic Jesus on my dash, held on with a magnet.   For some
reason it took ages to find,  but was discovered in Hamilton, Ontario.  8) *)
 I also had an eagle feather,  confiscated by customs st the US border.  I
just love the customs officials, but I don't think they loved all the greasy
junkin the bus, not to mention bits of wire from telephone and power
insulaters  (my SO's hobby).  Actually, all kinds of stuff ends up there.
 That is the advantage of a bubble window bus over a split - more altar
space.  Barndoors are really lousy at it.
