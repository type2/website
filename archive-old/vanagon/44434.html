Subject: Re: tents? popups? who cares?

Mr. Language Jerk writes:

&gt;Please stop referring to that fiberglass-roofed, canvas-sided thing 
&gt;that pops up atop your westy as a tent.  It ain't a tent.  It's a 
&gt;popup or poptop or movable roof or lichen farm or something, but it's 
&gt;not a tent!

Actually, Volkswagen and Westfalia (in the parts book) calls it a Boot.
 Bentley calls it a Poptop Canvas.

I don't care.  BOOT TO THE HEAD! :-)
