Subject: Re: need faucet top

&gt;I have an '81 westy, and need a replacement part for the very
&gt;tip-top of my water faucet (the round, flat black plastic piece).
&gt;I tried the dealer, but they said they can no longer get this
&gt;part.  Further, they can't even get the whole faucet.  Does
&gt;anyone who's replaced their faucet happen to have an extra
&gt;lying around?  If not, for those of you who have replaced your
&gt;faucets, what did you replace it with?  I have the kind
&gt;attached to a DC pump (thanks to BradleyM, who diagnosed
&gt;and fixed a leak in my old one this past weekend!), so it
&gt;needs to be able to bring up both city or tank water.
&gt;
&gt;TIA
&gt;
&gt;/m

Martha:

Alice and I (eggnog 81) seem to have a very similar series of needs.  Boy
blunder who used to own our camper crazy-glued the faucet in the open
position and we need to flip a switch to run the pump for tank water.  I'm
not sure what happens with city water since the outside connector is
busted.  I wrote to &quot;Delta Six Industries&quot; which makes replacement camper
parts but have gotten no reply so far.  Maybe it's time for a (another)
junkyard trip.

On my wishlist:

1) the small table top (missing, but we have the swing out arm)
2) replacement (83 or younger I think) door locks so you can lock w/o key.
3) city water hose adapter / working faucet.
4) Rear screen
5) Hot laser to zap cars that pass me even when I'm keeping up with traffic.
