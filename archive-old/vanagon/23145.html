Cetin asks:
&gt; Maybe the more important question is: why waste the propane when you
&gt; have another source of power that is immediately available and does
&gt; not tax any other resources (while the engine is on)?  am I missing
&gt; something?
&gt; Cetin

well... the interruption in the cooling cycle by switching between 
12v and propane causes a 'lag time' before each respective heating 
method fully kicks in.  This increases the fridge temps and it seems 
they are hard to get low again once they've warmed up.  Additionally, 
being new to a Westy propane fridge, i have mine running continuously 
just to see how long a tank will last.  So far, i'm at 9 continuous 
days.  Environmental ethic aside (yeah, which it probably shouldn't 
be) the cost factor for propane seems negligible ($3 for a total 
fill-- 3 gallons).  

i'm doing some 'experimenting' with the condensor fan.  i've hooked 
it up so that it runs continuously... that really seems to help keep 
things cooler at low to medium ambient temps.  60's-80's.  at higher 
ambient temps, having the fan run continuously doesn't seem to change 
the fridge temp, probably 'cause it would've been running all the 
time anyway.  haven't had a problem with battery drain, using the van 
daily.
