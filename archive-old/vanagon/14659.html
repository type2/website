No doubt sstones can do it funnier, but ...

the rows are displacement, no of cylinders, power in kw (with hp in 
parentheses), what kind of tranny, top speed, acceleration to 100 km/h,
which emissions standard (EG-Norm = European Union standard), what kind
of fuel (S bf = super unleaded, D = diesel doh!), consumption in l/100km
(I'll let someone else do the conversion :-) at 90 km/h, consumption at 
120 km/h, consumption in city driving, and lastly price in D-Marks (which 
have been rising against the $ faster than a helium filled balloon...I can 
remember 10 years ago it was 3.3 DM/$, now we're lucky if it stays above 
1.4...if I only had money then...if I only had money now!)
