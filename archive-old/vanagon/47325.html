Subject: Circuit Breaker '81 Westy

My circuit breaker fried and needs to be replaced. Delta Six wants 
$38 which is reasonable compared to the dealer but are there any other 
safe alternatives? I was thinking about replacing the breaker with a 
ground fault receptacle. Does anyone know if this would also act as a 
breaker if too many amps go through? Please respond directly since I 
have been relegated to the &quot;other&quot; list 8^)
