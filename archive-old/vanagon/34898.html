Stopped into the Baltimore Auto Show last nite.  No EV's a the VW display 
but I chatted with a rep.  She said the '96 will be out in May with the 
big engine, a longer nose to accomodate it, airbags and a bigger 
price tag.  She said there was still a goodly supply of '95 Campers and 
even had a list of where they were (back in her hotel room :-().  Lastly, 
she said that while the '96s would be out in the same models as the '93s,
that there could be a camper out in '97.
