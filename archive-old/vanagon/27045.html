Subject: Re: EV at 100 mph?

    I didn't mean to accuse, at first glance I must have experienced 
speed envy.  Most of my touring has been at high elevations 
(4000-11,300' above sea level) at sea level higher speeds are sure.  I 
cruise at 75 mph and max has been 87 - 90 ant about 4600 rpm redline is 
about 5000.

&gt;&gt;     Who took the EV to 100 mph? I own a 93 MV and you would be RED 
&gt;&gt; LINING to get to 100mph, i'll buy 90 mph.

&gt;I have no idea if he was telling the truth or not. I was merely 
talking
&gt;to him about the EV's being underpowered, and he mentioned an easy
&gt;cruising speed of 80, with top of 100. I don't think he meant 100 as
&gt;cruising speed.He is, however, a listmember (I don't have his 
address),
&gt;but I'm sure he'd be happy to talk to you. (His was a '95, BTW)
