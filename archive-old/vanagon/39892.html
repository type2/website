Subject: Re: V6anagon un-V6'ed

Well Steve, I am kind of curious as to what is happening.  Could it be 
that the torque of the V6 is too much for the clutch mechanism?  Maybe 
you need a &quot;super high performance off road racing clutch&quot; to take the abuse?

Keep us all posted as you have been, cuz I have been curious as to what 
is happening...
