Subject: Heater Cables

The levers that cotrol the heat are really hard to move - in fact one of the
plastic covers is cracked and frequently comes off in my hand (where in the
world can you get replacements?).

Where do you start in terms of making these easier to move?  I'm totally new to
this cable thing and have no idea how to trace these things once they leave for
the outside of the bus.

Thanks!
