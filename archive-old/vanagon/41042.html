Y'know, I've been sitting this one out, but after seeing what appears to 
be a fairly widespread and consistent experience, I thought I'd throw my 
story into the ring.

Remember those &quot;Difficult Conditions&quot; manuals I copied for about a 
grillion folks on the list?  I did it for my cost, when I had no job and 
less money, and a little time to kill.  And I did the whole thing on the 
honour system--folks told me they wanted a copy and where to send it to 
them, and I mailed it.  And because VW bus folks are almost universally 
good karma people, the cheques arrived over the following weeks and I 
broke more or less even.

Except for one request for 2 copies of the manual.  I think you can guess 
who requested it...

Oh, well.  It's their karma, right?
