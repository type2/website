Subject: 83.5 Vanagon Cooling

I just had an 83.5 w/c rebuilt. (Those aircooled guys are gone so there are 
less people laughing right now.  The engine runs great but I'm having problems 
with the cooling.  First, the temp guage rides mostly at 3/4 is this OK? My 
'84 always rode right in the middle.  Second, when I go to bleed it, I lift 
the front 3 feet off the gound, turn on both heaters and loosen the valve on 
the radiator.  The fand comes on when the temp gets a little past 3/4.  My 
problem is the anti-freeze starts to boil out of the rear at the same time I 
start to get bubbles out of the valve on the radiator.  Where should I start 
investigating?

Also, a not as important question.  When I switch the air-conditioning on, the 
compressor does not kick in.  Any sugestions?

Thanks,
Bryan
