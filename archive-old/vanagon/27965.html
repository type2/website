Subject: RE: Midas or not


&gt;Aren't Midas shops franchised?

Don't know.

&gt; If so, the quality of service probably varies quite a bit from place
to place

Not in my experience. People were always smiling, nice, courteous; and
the resulting work was technically sloppy, in every Midas I went to.


&gt;while the mufflers stay the same.

Every lifetime-guarantee muffler I've seen has remained shiny and
new-looking, while the pipes they put on with it have rusted out quickly.


&gt;Kinda like a Big Mac.

&quot;Special Sauce&quot; is poor IMHO. MacLeans and McNuggets are much better,
and their fries are usually excellent. :^)
