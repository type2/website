Ok, this is everything I know about windshield repair.  I ordered this
from Harbor Freight Tools on 10/23/95.  I needed to add something to a
48.99 order so I could qualify for the free shipping deal.  I had a 
nice star in my windshield about 3&quot; up from the bottom of the 
windshield and right of center.  '71 bus.

It being Friday I will provide ascii:

The x,y axis lines here measured 4cm X 4cm or 1 1/2&quot; X 1 1/2&quot;.  The 
rest of the stuff represents shorter lines coming out from the center.
At least one of the quadrants had seperated at the laminating some. It
looked like the petal of a flower in there.  I picked the dirt out of 
the center with a stick pin as per the directions.  The rest of the 
directions were followed to the letter with the result that the thing 
now looks quite sealed up and showing no signs of getting any larger. 
It was a two part epoxy thing.  Part number (04139)  &quot;Windshield 
Saver&quot;.  Mine was the &quot;Clear Star&quot; brand.  A call to Harbor Freight on
3/22/96 showed they had at least one in stock.  I listened to the 
recorded voice of a real women.  She did not tell me the price.  I 
paid $5.99(Amer) for it on 10/23/95.  Their number is 800-444-3353.  
All diclaimers apply.  If this thing is bad, or available elsewhere 
for much less then please let me know.  I plan on buying at least two 
more at some point to fix a couple of smaller ones I have my eyes on. 
If you had something to clean out the syringe thing and a sheet of 
thick double stick tape you own a windshield repair business.  I know 
I paid $25 once to do this fix about $14 years ago now.  I think the 
original poster paid over $50 to get a much bigger crack fixed lately.
This thing would seem to make good sense as a do it yourself repair on
at least the smaller ones.
