Subject: 67 13 wndw deluxe 4 sale

                                           3:51 PM             7/10/96

In my search for the holy grail (with another 8 windows) I have been
in email contact with a guy called Bob Peck in LA who has what sounds like
a very nice 67 13 window deluxe for sale (if you're into the sorta 'very mild
custom'
look).  He has had it for the last 15 years, has all paperwork and would like
to see 
it go to a  'good' home.  I offered to post an ad to the list on his behalf -
I
have not *seen* the bus...

  &quot;67 VW 13 window deluxe Bus; safari's, pinstriping, maroon &amp; grey,
upholstered
(matching), luggage rack, cherry+ condition, Calif vehicle. $5000. (213)
223-4850&quot;
