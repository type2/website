Subject: Re: Tire Circumference

&gt;&gt;I believe it's the circumference that is important.  Assuming that the tire 

which VW refers to as the 'dynamic circumference'

&gt;van on flat concrete (1.96m) was less than the circum. calculated from the 
&gt;diameter measured with the wheel off the van (2.00m).  I'm pretty confident 

For my Syncro,  the trans manual lists 2.00m for dyn.circ. The tires are
likely same size as all loafs, 185SR14 or 195/75/14.

&gt;In light of all this, the engine RPM now calculates to be about 200 RPM less 
&gt;than what my tacho reads at 100km/hr in 4th. Oh well, back to the drawing 


formula given is:

km/h / 1000rpm = 1000RPM / (gearbox ratio) x (axle ratio) x DC x 0.06

eg.  GBR = 41/48,  AR = 38/7,        DC = 2.0  (TD Syncro #s, I think)
         = out/in     = ring/pinion
gives 25.88 km/h per 1000RPM, top speed is this times redline, natch.

Maybe redo your #s with the 2.00m circumference?
