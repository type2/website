Subject: Re: List Split Announcement [IMPORTANT]



&gt;The *normal* course for mail list splits is to duplicate the 
&gt;entire list, and allow each individual the opportunity of 
&gt;unsubscribing to one, either or both.  Since the subscription (and 
&gt;unsubscription) is automated... This avoids all of the issues of 
&gt;which list you end up on.  Just send a message on each list, after 
&gt;the split, informing those people on the *new* list on how to 
&gt;unsubscribe.
&gt;

To add my 2 cents, I, too, am sorry to see the list split, but 
recognize that it is Gerry's list and his decision.  

I do agree that if it must be split, I would rather see everyone 
automatically subscribed to both with the option to unsubscribe.  
After each member has been on both lists for a while, he or she will 
be in a better position to decide whether to unsubscribe to one of 
them. If a member wants to unsubscribe to one list immediately, he 
can, of course, do so.

This option will also help maintain the &quot;community feel&quot; that we are 
all so afraid of losing, because we will all still be in contact 
with eachother after the split (except for those who choose not to). 
With the other option (automatically dividing the list), half of the 
members will suddenly be separated from the other half because they 
were put on different lists.  This will separate our &quot;community.&quot;

What do you think, Gerry?
