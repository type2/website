Subject: air-cooled list?
Date: Tue, 1 Apr 1997 17:32:12 -0800

Hello everyone,

After the lists air and water lists split, I dropped the air-cooled list. 
In trying to resubscribe, it looks like my subscription information is out 
of date. Could someone be kind enough to steer me in the right direction?

Thanks,
