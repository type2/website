Subject: Smell from Heater

&gt; I am new to the list and have been waiting to see some 
discussion               
&gt;about the smell that comes from the heaters of the 
watercooled                  
&gt;Vanagons.  It was my understanding that this was a 
common                       
&gt;feature, or is there a way to correct this 
problem?                             

My Vanagon had this feature too when I bought it. You have a few options 
here:
1. Move somewhere where you never have to use the heater. :-)
2. If you are lucky, then the hose attaching to the heater core may be 
leaking (I'm not lucky) :-(
3. Check the heater core. It is probably seeping out coolant which is 
probably heating up and burning off   right there on the core with little 
leakage. It can steam up the windows pretty quick. This is a $200 job at 
the dealer. :-(

It is amazing how much heat you will have once it is fixed!!
