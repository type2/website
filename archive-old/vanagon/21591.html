To All:

The three pieces of tin that shroud the push-rod tubes (one piece on the
driver's side, two pieces on the right) not only protect the push-rod tubes,
they allow the engine to warm-up faster and to maintain a more stable
temperature, critical factors in obtaining maximum service life from your
engine.
