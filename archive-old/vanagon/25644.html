Well i'm off to Front Royal Va for some weekend camping and canoeing.  
My uncle is meeting me there with his 76 westy. With the trans fixed 
after his last journey it should be a good trip this time.  It is only the 
third time I've had my 71 Westy out camping, it is different from my old 
one, but it gets more &quot;broken in&quot; every time I go out.  I'm lokking 
forward to it esp. because it kicks off three weekends camping of 
camping, including the Bug-On in Monravia Maryland.  Anyone going?
