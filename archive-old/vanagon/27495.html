Subject: 82 westy rebuild questions

     
     hello all -
     
     I purchased an 82 this summer, and despite burning 1 qt of oil over 
     700 miles I love it.  as thelma said, &quot;I see what all the fuss is 
     about&quot;. 
     
     But I figure it's time to start working on it's problems, the main one 
     is the age of the engine (it has 112,000 on the original). It's also 
     the only one I know about ;).
     
     I found a rebuilt engine (rebuilt by VW) from a bus that caught on 
     fire, and I the seller will look it over before putting it in.  He 
     wants $1200 for it - should that include installation ?  What's a 
     rebuilt engine cost 'of the shelf'.  How long should this take (the 
     shops in another town 1 hr away).
     
     Are there any other things (transmission, shifting mechanism, etc) 
     that I should also consider.  I've heard that having your engine 
     rebuilt costs about $2,500.
     
     There's a little outside rust, and the interior's in great condition.
     
     Any advice would be appreciated.
