&gt; There are several different models being discussed here.
&gt; 
&gt; In 1993 (perhaps other years also??) VW offered the Eurovan MV model which
&gt; was very much like the Vanagon Multivan model sold for the 1990 &amp; 1991 model
&gt; years.  The pop-top was done by Westfalia and contained seating for 7, but NO
&gt; sink, stove, etc.

Uh thats the Weekender if it has the pop top - which would also usually 
have a &quot;mini cooler pseudo fridge&quot; under one seat.  The regular MV has no 
pop top or cooler seat.

&gt; So, someone in Germany might be talking accurately about his Eurovan &quot;Westy&quot;
&gt; while in the USA we have the Eurovan &quot;Winnie&quot;.  Other's might accurately
&gt; describe their Eurovan MW as a &quot;Westy&quot;, since it does have a Westfalia
&gt; pop-top.

Well the weekender again...
