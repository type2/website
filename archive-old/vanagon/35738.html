Subject: My new Westy - '82 diesel at home

     Last night, at about 9:40PM, I got started working on my new Westy. My 
     wife thought I was nuts, but I rationalized to her that since the 
     cooling system had just water/oil emulsion and no antifreeze, that it 
     could freeze at night and crack the block. I knew it would not get 
     that cold, but I had to work on it! It's an addiction!!!  8^)
     
     First thing I did was to disconnect the hoses that went into the oil 
     cooler, which transfers the heat from the engine oil to the 
     antifreeze. This critter is mounted on top of the oil filter. I bought 
     the van convinced that the cooler was bad, since oil would go into the 
     coolant, but not the other way at all. The PO told me he thought it 
     was a cracked engine block, and I never argued the point. ;) I pulled 
     the hoses of the cooler, and used on of those &quot;Tee&quot; fittings used for 
     flushing engines to connect the two hoses together. Started the engine 
     up, and sure enough, oil started pumping out the hose connectors that 
     should have the coolant in them! Looks like a bad cooler for sure, and 
     not the block!
     
     I also did the best job I could flushing out the water/oil emulsion 
     from the cooling system--what a mess! Then I drained the radiator and 
     engine, and refilled just the engine with a 50/50 mix of antifreeze 
     and water.
     
     This morning, I visited the dealer to get some parts I needed. I 
     bought an inside window scraper for the driver's door, a new heater 
     blower switch and knob, a new coolant reservoir cap, and a overflow 
     reservoir cap.
     
     I priced out the oil cooler and O-ring seal---$205.00  OUCH!
     Does anybody know of another source for theses things? Dennis H.-any 
     help? I didn't have the money with me for the cooler, so I will prolly 
     order it tomorrow. For a while today, I debated either removing the 
     cooler and running without it, or replacing it with one of those 
     cheaper air-cooled types. I have talked myself out of it, however, and 
     will prolly just order the one from the dealer.
     
     I sat down today to figure out what this animal is costing me, and I 
     am not doing that bad:
     
     82 Vanagon diesel Westy    $2700
     Airfare to Orlando           120
     Tow to Autotrain             100
     Autotrain to Lorton          350
     Oil/Antifreeze/misc           20
     Parts at dealer today         71
     Oil cooler and seal          205
                                 -----
                        Total   $3566
     
     Assuming I don't need anything else too major, looks like a pretty 
     good deal so far!               
     
     Once again, if you know where to find one of those coolers for less, 
     please let me know!
     
     Thanks for listening!
