&gt;Before we head into the rainy season again, Is there any chrome or plastic
&gt;rainguards (those little chrome awnings that clip above the windows)
&gt;available that fit a 86 Vanagon driver &amp; passenger door windows.I tried JC
&gt;Whitney-No luck. The problem is the window is so wide, so I cant take
&gt;another type of guard and try it. Any VW parts or aftermarket catalog phone
&gt;numbers would be appreciated. Thank you again.

years ago, vw parts depts sold them as an accessory ... they might possibly
be out there somewhere on a shelf. but when i tried to buy some last year
from the dealer, he said that the part number was discontinued.

they are called Ventshades, by the way.

now, the Reimo catalog, from Germany, still has them. if you want to try
to order them, i can give you the address/phone and part number.
