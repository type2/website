&gt; and so might spend a day or two with the GNATT if it passes by the
&gt; bay area. I haven't seen any route info for this leg though. I'm
&gt; too scatter brained to coordinate, so if someone will simply tell
&gt; me when the tour is passing by, and where it stops and starts, I
&gt; will try to connect.

Funny you should mention that - I was just workin on it.  :)  Looks like
the new-and-improved reverse-route tour will be arriving in the Seattle
area around the 10th of June, Crater Lake around the 15th, and the Bay
Area around the 19th.  How does that strike ya?
&gt; 
&gt; 	Speaking of tours, has anyone heard from that nice
&gt; Canadian couple with the vivid yellow breadloaf, the Copleys? 
&gt; Last I recall, they had returned from Baja and were headed east along
&gt; the Southern US.

There was a post from them a little while ago, saying they needed to sell
their Westy to help pay for the trip, but other than that they made it
home okay and had a fantastic time.  Anyone else heard more?
