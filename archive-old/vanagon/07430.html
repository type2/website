&gt; 	In the 70s, a Porsche shop in the Soquel/Aptos area south of
&gt; Santa Cruz had a bread-loaf pickup truck with tandem rear axles as a 
&gt; flat-bed-hauler for injured sportscars. It was light blue and I dearly
&gt; wish I'd taken a picture of it! I never climbed under it to figure out
&gt; which of the rear wheel pairs were powered- it was like:
&gt; 
&gt; 	  ======
&gt; 	 //   ||
&gt; 	//---- |
&gt; 	|  ___ |________/======\_______
&gt; 	#=//o\\_________//o\ /o\\______\
&gt; 	   \_/           \_/ \_/
&gt;
This bus (or one like it) is for sale in the classifieds in the back of
this month's Hot VW's...
now's your chance to get it :)
