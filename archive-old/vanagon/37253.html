Subject: Thanks for EV tire info and more.


Just wanted to send a thanks to everyone who responded to my tire query.

Worrying about reinforced tires sure limits the selection.  Did the 
Vanagon require reinforced tire, because mine sure never had them?  

Also, one person mentioned the EV problem database.  I still want to do 
this but right now I'm entirely too busy (60+ hour work weeks and two CS 
classes with giant projects).  I hope to slow down a little bit this 
summer and will try to set up a web page and database (and go to Hawaii 
and get a pilots license).

On the rattle I posted a few months back, its definitely the catalytic 
heat shield and two dealers, and one muffler shop later, they have almost 
gotten rid of it.  It'll probably be back next week. ;(
