Subject: Towing Bus Trucks w/ a Syncro, EV Panels Sighted.

Hi All,

Today I pulled my 60 Dbl Cab project with my 86 Syncro GL about 60 miles
through varied types of roads:  residential, gravel, I-35, crapy county 20
foot blacktops.  The Syncro passed all expectations towing my Dbl Cab to
its new storage spot.  Next Tuesday I hope to haul my 64 Single Cab home
and get it back on the road after 27 years!  The Syncro has my class III
hitch installed and I use an older bumper-mounted hitch (like U-Haul used 
to use) with a so-so, but sturdy splittie bumper.  Last week I towed a
weighted down 70 Sunroof Bus thru residential streets w/o incident, *but*
I did loose a wheel on a 61 Bug I was towing on I-35 thanks to my neglect
of not tightening an axle nut!!  Luckily an accident was avoided and we
were back on the road after a 30 minute delay retrieving another axle nut.
The wheel, tire and brakedrum continued to let the poor bug roll with the
back of the rim rotating on the outer axle until I got on the shoulder!
8-/  With the Dbl Cab I did hit the 70 mph mark a few times on I-35, but
passing semis made for a lot of air-turbulance.  60-65 worked best.

Anyways, on my travels down I-35 lately I have noticed on 3 occasions
flatbed semis hauling loads of 3 Eurovan Panels heading northeast.  My
speculation is that these are getting hauled from the docks in Port 
Aurther, TX to the Winnebago plant in Iowa.  I could be wrong, but it is
the only reason I can think of.  Any thoughts on this?
