Subject: South Africa, VW's

I returned a couple of days ago from Botswana and South Aftrica.
Thought readers might be interested to know of the HUGE number of
VW's I saw in the Johannesburg area.  All the shuttle-busses from
airport to hotels were 'Vanagon' types (Transporters, Caravelles
etc).  Large numbers of Jetta's, Cabriolets, Golfs etc etc).  I
didn't think there we so many VW's in the world - ESPECIALLY buses.
That gave me great hope of being able to buy some parts that are hard
to get in Australia second hand (almost no Vanagons wrecked here.).

On my return trip from Botswana I had 10 hrs to kill in J'burg so I
talked and phoned around and took a taxi to Volkspares, a few km from
the airport.  I was looking forward to excess baggage full of spares.
They had NOTHING at all of use for me, but a mountain of parts, old
bugs and vans. Apparently, even with so many buses on the road,there
are none in wreckers yards.  The most helpful owner knew one recent
van being wrecked in Pretoria, but none others in the country! I must
say how impressed I was with the bus I travelled in for 15km from
airport to hotel.  It was a current model VW, and in such a different
class to my 82 van.
For what it's worth . . . .
