I'm parting out a near complete 87 Syncro 7 passenger van. Check out my web
page for more details.  http://gozips.uakron_dot_edu/~koesel/SMT If you have
already contacted me about parts, I'll be sending you e-mail soon. Sorry to
everyone for the delay, the logistics of getting this van home was more
than I anticipated.
