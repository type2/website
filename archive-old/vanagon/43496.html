Subject: The 85 EcoVanagon is riding again

Hi fellas:
This is to say thanks to all those friends who helped me to clear out the
problem I had with the rough riding of my 85 GL. Sand paper, a lot of
patience, new coolant sensor, WD-40 and a long riding terminated with the
problem (I'm stil suspicious about the flowmeter).This is a great list
and you guys are great friends.  Thanks again for your good advice.
