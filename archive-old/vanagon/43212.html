  For sale:  1969 Westfalia, full roof pop-up, $2300.  Low miles on rebuilt
  motor
  (1600 Dual) and Trans.  Good brakes, complete interior, very little
  rust.  Needs minor ding repair and paint.  Been all around the country
  without complaints, very reliable for years but prefer early busses now.
