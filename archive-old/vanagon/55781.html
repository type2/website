Subject: JCW Heat Exchangers Quality?

Anyone buy a set of late Bus exchangers from them recently?

Last set I bought was back in 88 or so, and have held up quite nicely 
on the old '76, Danish I believe, I feel the T4 engine ones are 
usually better than the bug jobs.  I ask as the '78 will need a set 
and my new JCW catalog lists them on sale for $172 each, a good 
price, but like I said have not a bought any from them in a long 
time, seeking a more recent opinion.
