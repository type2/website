Subject: Re: emissions equip for 73 Bus


&gt;If your engine has a single carb and none of the above equipment, then
&gt;I would say it will take a LOT of work and $ to get it to pass emissions
&gt;legally.  If your bus is one that requires the EGR and Smog pump like
&gt;Steve mentioned, then you are *really* screwed.  I would sell it and
&gt;let someone else worry about converting it.

I think the car will be very hard to sell if it cant be easily registered, 
unless someone has a rusty, bent 73 bus with a blown motor... Anyone in such 
a situation?  I dont really NEED this bus anymore, I just kind of like it...
