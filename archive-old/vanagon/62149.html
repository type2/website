Subject: Potential Purchase, 88? Vanagon...questions..:)



Hey folks.....find-o-the-year fer me...(well, maybe...:)

88 Vanagon, fer 300 bucks...took a look at it, its in damn good 
shape...surface rusted roof (damn hard to wax that beast, i presume..:)
a ding in the front of the right rear wheelflare...surface rusted there, 
and some seam rust behind the drivers door...

The third-party story that i know on it:  Original owner, boughtit 
fer the wife, she drove it till 6 or more months ago, he was unable to 
stop it from over heating. claims it has a porshe motor (i fell off the 
tire i was sitting on laughin when i heard that one....:)
Stoped driving, and bought the wife a new minivan...

Interior is basic, rear, middle, fronts...no visible tears or 
anything....grill was off, and in the middel seat...

I looked at the motor....says it was made by VW of Germany...:)
The case is VERY VERY cleean. Like it had recently  made major work 
done....And never sean the road...

(didnt see engien compartment, this is UNDER the engine....)

Got the engien # for finle confermation thats its VW, not Porshe...025 
101 102

The bus has round headlights, too....if i (sure...:) remember rightly, 
didnt they go square around 86??

SO, i got the VIN to find out hte real year, too...:)   WV2YB0256FH043503

Anyone know how to read one of those???:) (i'm thinking 85....)

Oh, windhsield has a BB gun shot in it...:(right at driver eye 
level..phooie..


So....anything anyone wants to tell me is welcome...I'll prolly be 
getting this bus, one way or the other (prolly in exchange for work on a 
friends Things...:)

If i cant figure it out, then i'll sell. or part it...bu for know, i want 
to give it a shot....as soon as i get the truck done...:)


Later....david
