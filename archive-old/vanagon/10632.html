&gt;fluid comes out as it should, but when I went to fill up the resevoir, I
&gt;discovered that most of the fluid was pouring down the filler tube and from
&gt;there directly through to the ground below. Is there a seal between the filler
&gt;tube and the tank which has gone bad?  If so, is it easily obtained/replaced?

yup. there IS a seal, but what happened to me was that after about a year
(this first happened on my new 1980 bus which i bought back in december of
1979), the seal kinda 'shrinks' and doesn't make full contact all round the
little plastic filler neck that goes up from the tank to the hole beneath the
driver's feet.

 what is running out onto the ground is all the fluid that you put into the
filler neck. normally, you'd fill it up until you saw the fluid, right? :)

so the tank itself is still full, but you don't have any additional fluid
up the filler neck. big deal. i've grown accustomed to it and use the sound
of tinkling to let me know when to stop pouring. :)

easily obtained? for some reason, i never did that ... can't recall why.
easily replaced? real easy. but you're gonna get fluid all over you. :)
i found that out when i was trying to discover what the heck was going on ...
and again when tracking down a pinched fluid tube up to the spray nozzle by
the wipers. unless you squirt a buncha fluid out of the tank, it'll spill.
on you. :)

i suppose, now that i know about silicone sealant, that a remedy could be
easily fabricated to stop the leaking. i just 'never got around to doing it'.
