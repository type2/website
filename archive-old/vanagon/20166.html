Subject: Return of the Crew cabs.

I saw in one of the VW rags (can't remember if it was VWT of HVW's) but in a
section of the mag they showed VW's not available in the US. One was a Jetta
stationwagen, and the other was a Eurovan based crew cab pickup. The one
shown had a flatbed on the back.  Didn't give any specs tho'.
