Subject: Postcard from William Warburton
Date: Wed, 19 Apr 1995 16:36:34 -0700 (PDT)

I got this postcard in the mail yesterday from William Warburton, a list-
member that some of you will remember that is travelling in the Americas
and was going to go on the GNATT tour.  It reads:

&quot;Hi,
	I'm afraid this card is bad news - we have too much still to do
in South and Central America to be able to join the VW trek this Summer.
I'm sorry to miss it as I'm sure it will be great fun but alas we are only
now leaving Chile and it will take us three or four months to get to the
U.S..
	Please pass on our apologies and best wishes to everyone on the
Vanagon list (especially Joel and Jack Stafford) - we'll try and get in
touch to say hello to some fellow VW Volks when we get to the US anyway.
Once again - Sorry to let everyone down!
	FROM:  William Warburton and Judy Foster, Edinburgh, Scotland.&quot;

The card was mailed from Santiago, Chile on April 4th.

*sigh*  Well, this is bad news, but not the end of the world, of course.
Now having the start at St. Louis makes even more sense, since nobody is
going to make it all the way across the country.
