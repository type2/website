Subject:      85 owners manual

I have an 85 owners manual, I'd gladly photocopy for anyone needing one
(including the camper suppliment for those with campers). I also have the
stove, 'fridge, and other assorted paper ephemera that came with STRIDER.
Anyway, those interested please e-mail me directly. My search for a companion
has thus far been fruitless. The latest was an 84 pigdog. I'll post the
particulars soon so others may share in my pain.
