Subject: Re: VC failure symptoms

These do not sound like vc failures to me.

My VC has been failing steadily for the last year or so. The symptom is that
it gets so aggressive that it binds the vehicle severely in tight turns
after driving.

&gt;&gt;     GOod Question!  I think mine is on it's way out. It has a small
&gt;&gt;     vibration at 35MPH only for the first 2 minute of running. After
&gt;&gt;     that you must stop for 1/2 hour to repeat the vibration. OH This
&gt;&gt;     is with the drive shaft out. With it in the vibration changes to
&gt;&gt;     45MPH, all the time.         Eric
