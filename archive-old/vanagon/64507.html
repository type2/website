Subject:      Auto or Man trans on '93 EV MV?

Hey folks,

What's the conventional wisdom on Automatic or Manual transmission in the
'93 Eurovan MV?  This is the 5 cylander engine.  (I've heard it referred to
as the &quot;Audi&quot; engine.)

I had a manual transmission that worked well.  I'm now looking at one that
is an automatic.  Any reason to stay away from the Automatic transmissions?

Thanks,

Carter
