Back to the mugs...

I'd prefer the ceramic 4 Generations mug myself....I do have an idea for =
shipping. I have a small collection of boxes with those annoying plastic =
p-nuts in them. I'm sure others have them too...howabout if we enclose a =
check in one of those boxes, ship the box/check to you...you remove the =
check, insert a mug, and send the box back? Would that fix the problem?

BTW..speaking of the &quot;mass debate&quot; comment, and coffee mugs, the =
following conversation was overheard at Dunkin Donuts between Poor =
Richard and the waitress:

WAITRESS:	Cream in your coffee??
