I always make sure to put my filters on only hand-tight, and I don't have 
your problem because of it.  Also, I possess super-human strength.  :)

Without a tool, there are a couple of approaches:

1) The MacGiver Method: get a few hose clamps, put them together so they 
form a big circle, and tighten THAT around the filter.  Now you've got 
something to grip.  

2) The Barbarian Method: get your big, ugly screwdriver, and ram that 
sucker right through the filter, THEN start turning.  No way that thing 
can resist your superior power.  Works best if you're lying directly 
underneath the stuck filter when you hit it with the screwdriver.  ;-&gt;

3) The Bradley Method: get a pile of magnesium and reduce the filter to a 
few remnants of smoking goop.  Scrape off remains.  Replace with new 
filter.  Have entire Los Angeles Fire Department ready for fire 
suppression OR have the bus obscenely over-insured (with fire insurance 
rider, of course).
