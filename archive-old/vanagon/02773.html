Subject: Hot Starting (a) vanagon

Query: What are three main causes of problems or restarting an
aircooled Vanagon engine? The engine is equipped with an OXSensor and
I am wondering if the problem relates to the sensor's age (no idea),
electrical (ie coil)
or the FI system (lack of fuel)? Thanks in Advance -DC

I have noticed sometimes if I let the engine idle a few minutes before
shutting down that chnaces of a resstart are improved.

The engine start first time when cold BTW.
