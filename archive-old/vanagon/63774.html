&gt; 1.  A Westfallia is a full camper conversion with closet, sink, fridge that
&gt; apparently doesn't work well, and probably swivel seats.

In general terms a Westfalia is any VW van converted by Westfalia to be a
&quot;Camper&quot; (VW's term) by the addition of a pop-top and other features.  Some
Westies had the complete camping package including sink, stove, etc.  Others
were more basic models and had a pop-top but only a simple fridge and no
sink, stove, etc.  The Multivan is very similiar to the basic Campers, having
a pop-top and a cupboard, but is usually not called a Westy.
 
&gt; 2.  My GL has a fold down rear seat to make into a semicomfortable bed.
 Even
&gt; my rolled CARAT had the same fold down erar seat, and in addition had the
jump
&gt; seats, and a table that swung out of the wall.
&gt; 
&gt; 3.  What is a Weekender package.  Is it something in between 1 and 2
above???

Your GL and Carat both had the &quot;Weekender Package&quot;.  The &quot;Weekender Package&quot;
consists of a bed that folds down and combines with a cushion over the engine
to form a bed.  On the GL (depending on the year) the Weekender Package was
likely an option.  On the Carat it was standard.  The description I write
here is VW's terminology for Weekender Package.

Many people call the basic (non GL) Camper (Westfalia) a &quot;Weekender&quot;.  This
is often confused with the Weekender Package as described above.  VW never
called any of it's Vanagons a &quot;Weekender&quot;, but many owners have.

Did I confuse you further?  Great, I feel complete now.

Chris?
