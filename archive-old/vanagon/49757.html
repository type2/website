&gt; but I would want to register it someday...and not get busted 
&gt; for auto theft.
&gt; 
&gt; any thoughts?

You can check the city or county tax records to see who owns the property 
and approach the owner.  I wouldn't take it upon myself to remove a 
seemingly abandoned vehicle.

Best of Luck in your rescue effort. :-)
