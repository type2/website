Be careful the crow doesn't get stuck in the fan or you'll have real 
temperature problems.

|&gt;Does someone have the measurements [inches or cm] from 0
|&gt;on a stock-sized crank pulley for 7.5 and 30 BTDC? I seem
|&gt;to remember 7.5&quot; being about 3/8&quot; to the left of 0.
|
|Measuring on a stock-sized degree wheel I never have installed:
|
|7.5 degrees =  .45&quot; or
|                3/8&quot; or
|                11 mm
|
|30 degrees =   1.75&quot; or
|               1 3/4&quot; or
|               44 mm
|
|I'm measuring as the crow flies, not rolling around the diameter.
