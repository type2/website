WARNING: I am going to attend this (with my 2-year-old son Seth) and
instigate others to drive their vans adventureously. 

Alert your viscous couplings! :)

&gt;Looks like we have a minimum of 8 buses coming so far, and room for more!
&gt;
&gt;Details:
&gt;Friday June 21 (early arrivals)-Sunday, June 23, at the Elizabeth Furnace
Campground, 
&gt;Massunutten Mountain, in George Washington National Forest. $11.00 per
night, we can 
&gt;park two vehicles at each campsite. Generally, this is near the
intersection of 
&gt;Interstates 66 and 81, in northwest Virginia.
&gt;
&gt;VW activities, besides the usual bragging and lying, will include an
off-road excursion 
&gt;on the seven mile Peters Mountain Trail; those without Syncros are welcome
to come along 
&gt;for the ride! 
&gt;
&gt;Non-VW activities include large variety of hiking, from kid-friendly nature
trails to 
&gt;strenous bushwacking. Elizabeth Furnance itself is the remains of an old
iron smelter, 
&gt;and there are other historical attractions nearby. Sounds like there will
be plenty of 
&gt;kids attending, some are bringing bikes and soccer balls. I understand
canoe and
&gt;kayaking are also good in the area. Shenandoah Caverns is nearby, a nice,
cool, slightly 
&gt;touristy stop.
&gt;
&gt;Potluck dinner Saturday nite: I'll try to coordinate with those that
&gt;confirm so that we don't end up with nothing but tuna casseroles, but if
you decide to 
&gt;come at the last minute you'll be quite welcome, try to bring something to
serve 8.
&gt;
&gt;Vague Directions (i.e., get a map and this should make sense):
&gt;
&gt;&gt;From the north, take I-81 south to Strasburg (Exit 298?). Find your way to
Route
&gt;55 east. From the east, take I-66 to Exit 6, and head south toward Front
Royal until
&gt;you pick up 55 going west. In either case, take 678 south to the
campground. There is a 
&gt;Elizabeth Furnace Group Campground that you will see first, that is not it.
Keep going.
&gt;Total distance south on 678 is on the order of 5 miles. 
&gt;
&gt;If you are coming from the south you could just run up I-81 to Strasburg,
or get off at 
&gt;Edinburg (Exit 279)and head southeast on 675 until it crosses 678, then
turn north 
&gt;toward the campground. From the southeast, one could also pick up 675 at
Luray, head 
&gt;northwest until meeting 678, then turn north etc.
&gt;
&gt;Keep me posted on your plans!
&gt;
