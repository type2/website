Subject: Vanagon: Bosch Platinums?

Can someone tell me the model # of Bosch Platinum spark plugs for my '87 
2.1litre Syncro. The dealer can't, can you? Our local cheesy autoparts 
supplier gave me a number, and will have to order them in, hence the double 
check. All other platinums are $5.99/pair, he wants $4.35/each for mine, can 
you spell VW? ,he can!  tia  tim s.
