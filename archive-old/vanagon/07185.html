Subject: Adjusting Diesel timing



To adjust the timing of a diesel, without using any of the fancy tools,
can be accomplished by the following.

Remove the timing belt cover
Using 13mm open end, socket loosen the 4 bolts.  3 on the face of the
pump and 1 on the back of the pump.
       (face being near the belt....)

only loosen the bolts slightly, just enough as to move the pump using a
large channel locks

start the van up.

Rotate the pump slightly towards the head, which will set the timing to
advance, going too far will cause a hoard of knocking, so try and find a
happy medium.

Tighten the bolts, take the van for a drive.

I set most of my diesels pretty far advanced, which makes me never using
the cold start cable to fire up the engines in the morning.

I also on the van, have the pump set up pretty rich,
