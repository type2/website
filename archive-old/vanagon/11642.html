&gt;&gt;I've seen some awfully good looking drums in the junkyard that could be
&gt;&gt;had for a few bucks and turned, if not used outright.  Have you considered
&gt;&gt;getting used instead of spending over $150 for new ones?

Vanagon drums in junkyards? I hardly ever saw any vanagons in junkyards.
Also I am afraid that used and turned drums are too thin to reuse. It all
depends on lucks. I may not have choice but paying hard earned $$$$ for
new ones. Thanks for the good point.
