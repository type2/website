&gt;	There was nothing sadder for me this week than watching my
&gt;`63 kombi getting hauled away by the wrecker; headlights pointing
&gt;straight back at me, looking accusingly at the person who just
&gt;couldn't fix her. *sigh*. It was time to take the patient off life
&gt;support.

You did remove all of her valuable before you had her interred, right?  
Thats the custom for California hospitals and mortuaries.
