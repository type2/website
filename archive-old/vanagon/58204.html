Subject: Oil light/buzzer on, but was actually dirty contacts

From: Dave Mancuso &lt;Mancuso_at_etown.k12.pa_dot_us&gt;

Last year at the end of winter, my oil light/buzzer went on when the van 
first started up.

After the panic attack, I noticed that a) it only went on over 2,000 rpm 
(so it was the .9 bar oil sensor, not the .3 ), and b) It never went on 
after the engine got warm.

I used VW filters, and 10W30 at the time, so I thought the oil pump was 
shot, or the sensor was shot, until I shined up the sensor spade 
connector with sandpaper. Surprise! The problem went away.

My starter stopped working for the same reason, and when I shined up the 
contacts on the starter, it worked again fine.

Now this year I had the problem again with the oil sensor. Shining it up 
made the problem go away again, but I think I'm going to replace the 
sensor, to make sure. I don't want to fool around with oil pressure 
warning systems.

Are the winters in PA that bad on electrical systems? I guess so. (BTW, I 
have an '87)
