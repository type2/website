&gt; I recently hit a BIG bump in my 1985 Vanagon and, evidently, some seals

&gt; last.  He also said that he couldn't &quot;guarantee&quot; his work and
&gt; recommended that I purchase a rebuilt rack.  Got one price off the net
&gt; of $450.00 with my core.  Whoa, had no idea they were so expensive?
&gt; 
&gt; So....looking for recommendations.  Should I go with the &quot;unguaranteed&quot;
&gt; work and hope for the best or just go ahead and &quot;bite the bullet&quot; and
&gt; get the rebuilt rack? 

Since you are in Vacaville, I would call John, the service manager at Wes
Lasher VW in Sacramento, and ask him what they do with PS racks.  He is a
good guy.  Their phone is 916-441-2761.  I suspect it would be smart to
try the new seals before getting a $450 exchange rack.

&gt; Perhaps there's another alternative?

I see the Parts Place catalog has a kit of used parts to convert power
steering to non-power for $250 and a $50 core charge.  Maybe you could
pick up those parts locally for less.  You could also get a used PS rack
at a local dismantler, I suppose.
