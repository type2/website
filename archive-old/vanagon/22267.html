Subject: RE: PTFE AS TRANSMISSION ELIXIR

&gt;However, Volkswagen recommends in the owner's manual of our '71 Bus
&gt;that if winter weather remains around -40 degrees, the manual tranny
&gt;should be filled with ATF (automatic transmission fluid). Of course,
&gt;it never gets that cold here in San Diego!

Just try to get it to come out!  Lying on your back with your mittens on,
wrench in hand.  I guess you could torch the trans for a few minutes to warm
it up.  Put the ATF in the oven, what fun.  Not that i'll ever have to try it.
