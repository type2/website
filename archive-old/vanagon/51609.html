Subject: Re: Syncro Westie GVW?


&gt; So what is the real answer for &quot;how much does ruby-the-red-brick weigh?&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; Anyone weighed their syncro-westie w/water etc on a front-rear scale?  
&gt; What did the beast weigh?
&gt; 
&gt; I'm thinking that 1325 lbs_at_ 50PSI maybe isn't enough tire (Uniroyal Laredo).
&gt; 
I'd say 1325 is probably not enough, based on the following:

My Westy (non-syncro) loaded with water &amp; gear for 2 nights 
(~75-100lbs), two people (~275lbs), 2 cats (~18lbs), 1/2 tank gas, 
was 2050 kg = 4510lbs on a commercial scale. I seem to recall that a 
Vanagon weight dist. is about 58/42 % Rear/Front, which means the 
rear tires are carrying ~1300lbs each. 

This trip was a fairly average load; I've carried much more than this 
before.
