&gt;Jumped in the 89' westy yesterday and noticed a slight humming sound coming
&gt;from the fridge/cabinet area.  Can't be certain it was fridge but what else
&gt;could it be?  The ignition was turned off, there is no spare battery to run
&gt;fridge.  Flipped the 3-way fridge switch several times, humming still there.
&gt;Any thoughts?

It is probably ther cooling fan for the condensor.  It gets power all the
time and it thermostatically operated.  The refrigeration cycle in these
things is a complicated process.  Letting the fridge overheat will damage the
internals rendering the unit useless.  Using fridge with the van parked un
level will do same damage.  When using propane, be sure the 12 and 110 volt
switch is off.  The extra heat of both the propane and a heater elemement
will cause eventual damage.
