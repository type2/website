Subject: HELP! I need Ken in North Charleston, SC

Got a phone call a minute ago. My buddy Jim Kirk is towing a Vanagon back
from SC. The Vanagon has no motor and is on a trailer. Turns out this
trailer works fine for hauling Bugs. But not so fine for hauling Vanagons.
It fish tails bad. Cant go over 30 mph which is means it will take them
until next Christmas to make it back home.      

Jim had the name and number for a local VW guy there in North Charleston but
it turns out the number is no good. Ken are you out there? Jim has lined up
a better trailer but needs a place to leave this one for now. Or if they
could lay their hands on an air cooled Vanagon motor quick, then he would be
up for driving it home. 

Can you guys help??
