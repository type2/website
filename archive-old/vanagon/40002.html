Subject: 78(?) Westy Parts, Cheap

Hi All,

A local salvage yard is going out of business and they are having a 
close-out sale--$25 an arm load etc.  Bus-wise they only have a 78 
pop-top Westy camper that had an engine fire, but is more or less 
complete.  I plan on getting the drivetrain etc. (heavy armload!) and can 
probably grab misc. parts if they aren't too big.  Let me know soon.
BTW, looks like all the camper stuff is still in it.  You'll pay 
shipping, but otherwise it's windfall if it's not a huge item.
