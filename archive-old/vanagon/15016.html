Subject: Cracked Heads Too!

 Well, I pulled the heads off of my tired 1800 last night thinking &quot;All I had
 was those bits of metal in the oil so these heads should be fine.....&quot; Not
 so lucky! Three of the combustion chambers have cracks running from the
 exhaust valve seat all the way through to the exhaust port &lt;visible from the
 other side!&gt;. Bummer. Suitably depressed about the new need for remanufactured
 heads I went inside to work on my taxes. I owe the state big time. Like as
 much as a GEX rebuilt for my bus. Bummer.
 
 Back out to the garage to poke around. I'm peering down into the engine case
 with a flashlight and notice that my cam has the two little cast bands around
 the center bearing - I thought &quot;doesn't it say in Bentley that the cams with
 the two little bands are for engines mated to an automatic transmission?&quot; I
 look it up and that's what it says. Bummer.

 What do I have to do to lift this curse? Is there some way I can get the 
 Hon. Slimey Pete Wilson &lt;please DO vote for him in the primary and please
 DON'T vote for him in the real race - we'd like him to stay out of the state
 as much as possible, but sure don't want him to become president&gt; to pick up
 the tab for my rebuild?
