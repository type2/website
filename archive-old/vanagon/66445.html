&gt; May we have the size, etc. of those Michelin tires again, please.

&gt; I am very happy to hear about these tires for the EV, because the first
&gt; time I rotated the Goodyears on my 1997 EV was at 7,500 miles, and my tire
&gt; man said that I would be lucky if I get 15,000 miles out of them at their
&gt; current rate of wear.
&gt;
&gt; And what is the price of the new Michelins?

I don't often read the messages about Eurovan tires because I don't have
need of them--until now. I am changing wheel size on my Vanagon to 15&quot;
and am trying to get the right size tire. Today at a tire store, I was
having little luck finding what I want until I came across a &quot;Vanagon
repacement tire&quot; in a Michelin catalog that was (to my surprise) a MXL
205 65 15. Is that the original tire for one of the Eruovans? The MXL
205 70 14 was the original tire for the Syncro Vanagons but they don't
make them anymore. Has anyone had experience with these tires?  BTW I
was quoted 115$ each.
