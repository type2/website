Subject: Re: Why there are so many cars with &quot;rebuilt&quot; engines for sale?

The problem with VWs are that they are perpetually cool and they do
not rot away like Amero-nippo-anglo boxes.  When was the last time
you saw a Vega? and ask yourself why that is so.  Come to think about 
it those 300ZX s are pretty rare,  dated,  and doggy looking now.
The interior of my '83 Westy looks better than my moms '93 Lincoln,
the premier American Luxury Auto.  

So,  I guess that VWs are worth rebuilding rather than just hiding 
them on your front lawn up on cinderblocks.

By-the-way....are there any products out there that can help my
wasser boxer get through emissions inspection with regularity?  It 
seems that in New Jersey they have implemented a much stricter emissions 
test;  the kicker is that if you fail the inspection a second time
your car is essentially condemed!  That means it can not be sold in 
this state, ever driven again in this state  etc....Just think of the 
implications,  I may be forced to buy a new Honda or something....
This law will put a big crimp in my VW lifestyle.  So please help!
My Westy is a 1.9L wasser boxer,  a new engine at 102,000,  and currently 
sitting at 156,000.

HELP...jg Rutgers University....'83 Westy,  '92 Passat
