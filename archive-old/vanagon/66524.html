Subject:      More propane regulator questions

Thanks for all the help with my propane regulator.  I  was able to buy a =
new generic one at $$$toltzfus's near West Chester, PA for $25.00.  My =
question is since there was a reverse thread on one side where the tank =
connector connects to the connector on the regulator is there another =
reverse thread on the other side of the connector? (The square side)  It =
doesn't want to turn in either direction so before I apply any force I =
was wondering if I was going the right way.

Thank,
Bryan
