Subject: Hoch Motors info wanted

I've seen multiple references to Hoch/Roy Mathers in the past.  Coyote 
kindly turned me onto him as a source for a synchro westy.  Insofar as 
Corvallis, Oregon and Santa Rosa, Calif. are far apart, it's tough to get 
info on Roy's operation.  If anyone has had experience with it, I'd sure 
appreciate getting the lowdown....honorable guy, good vehicles, etc.  
Roy, if you're listening,,, no insult intended, just need to know....
