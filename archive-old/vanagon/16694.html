Subject: Type IV missesss


	I would be money,(about 170 dollars to be exact) that the missing
is caused by your air flow sensor.  Eventually, the little carbon track wears
through, and when you hit that spot, your engine shuts down momentarily.
 
	I have temporarily fixed mine by moving the wiper, but it still
stutters occasionally.  Gads I wish I could spell.
 
	Anywho, you might pop the plastic top off the sensor and see if
the carbon track has any dead spots in it.....
