Subject: failing engine mount?

Hey all,
I'm trying this again because it appears my last attempt was truncated.

What's happening on my '78 is that when starting in 1st gear from rest, sometimes I get a groaning/creaking/metallic noise that sounds like it has something to do with the sudden application of torque that results from acceleration.  I don't know what a failing engine mount sounds like, so what does it sound like?

I assume it's either that or a rear suspension problem.  If it is rear suspension, what would be a probable cause?  Is this a warning that soon my rear suspension will collapse?  :)

Any help would be appreciated.

Thanks,
Sean
