Subject: VW Micro-Bus

	Does anyone out there know the approx prices of a 1950-60 VW
MicroBus? (I'm not sure about the production dates, but I know it's
the one with the split-pane front windshield...) :)
	I say priceS (plural) because I'm wondering the various different
prices for the van in running condition, in a condition in which it &quot;needs
work&quot;, etc. And how easy is it to restore (only to satisfactory running
condition) the original engines? Did any of these come in automatic??
	And about how much (on average) would one have to spend to get
a micro-bus running? (I know these are VERY broad questions that depend
on the van in question, but I'm hoping I'll get some response!)
	Thanks!
