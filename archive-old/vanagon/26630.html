Subject: Re: numbers, was BITE ME...&lt;snip&gt;

&gt;Ok, I'm a bit insenced over this &quot;most produced van&quot; crap....
&gt;
&gt;I dug up some figures....as of March 8, 1990 (the 40th anniversary
&gt;of the first VW Transporter), there were 6.7 million Type2 built..
&gt;that's just the figures for the first 3 generations...


Here's the poop straight from VWAG, via fax to me on 25.08.1994 from Herr
H. Otto in the Finanz-Publizitaet und Statistik department in Wolfsburg.

&gt;From 1949 until June 30, 1994 there were 7,458,079 units (VW Transporter,
including van, microbus, etc.) built.  Herr Otto offered no comments on
historical accuracy of &quot;inventing&quot; the minipuke, er I mean, minivan.

So there. :-)
