Subject: Bucking Clutch

Hello all-

Recently my '86 Westy has developed a problem with the clutch. After I have been
driving in stop-and-go traffic for awhile, the clutch begins to &quot;chatter&quot; when I
try to start from a stop.  The only way I can prevent this from happening is to
rev the motor up to about 3000 rpm while I let the clutch out. Any ideas on what
is causing this, and what needs to be done to fix it?
