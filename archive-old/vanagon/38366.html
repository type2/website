Subject: '88 Westy Drain Board/Burner Cover

One thing I discovered while reading my new Bentley is that the US 
model Westy Vanagons had a flip-down drain board over the burners. 
But the Canadian models (like mine) use a fixed stainless heat 
shield. Apparently, some Gummint authority thought us Canadians would fry 
ourselves with such a device...

Anyone know of a good source for a US burner/sink cover in grey? I'd 
love to get one of these. If not, I guess a plastic drain pan would 
work, but it's just another thing to carry around...

Shawn.
