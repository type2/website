&gt;   Oh well, tomorrow I get out the test lamp and the ohmmeter, along with 
&gt;  the wire brush and the pocket knife.  I'll make all the conectors sparkle 
&gt;  and make sure everything makes contact.  Then maybe I'll get Buddy and 
&gt;  we'll take the bus out for a push.

  Not having F.I. on my bus I am not a good source of advice, but this does
  sound a bit like some of the accounts of &quot;worn-out-track-in-flow-sensor&quot;.
  Is it true that this can be fixed by bending the wiper a little so that
  it rubs in a new spot?
