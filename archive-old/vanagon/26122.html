I was just redoing the heating system on my '73, and found that once the
engine starts, the warm air blower no longer runs. It runs fine when you
turn the switch on and have the ignition switch turned to &quot;on&quot; (so the
warninglights are on) but by slowly turning it (the key) further, it cuts
out the blower just about the time the starter is going to be be triggered.
Now, this same car has always (since I've had it) had a starting malady in
that won't fire while the starter is cranking, but you have to crank a
little, then just let off the key, and it fires up. Until now, I had assumed
that the problem was that the starter was going bad, thus drawing too much
current, and not leaving enough for the coil to give a good spark. Now I
don't know. Could this be faulty ignition switch?
