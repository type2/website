Subject: Re: Gearing Calculator

Cool! But what I want to do is find out what size tires the factory 6.13
gear ratio gears would cause us to purchase to have the van have the same
characteristics as the 25&quot; tires that are original to the 4.86 gears.

I couldn't find out how to do this with the gearing calculator, so can you
help?  ...or anybody else, for that matter?

&gt;'Morning all!
&gt;
&gt;I just posted a Gearing Calculator on my web site.
&gt;(http://coyote.accessnv_dot_com/wayback) It's a conversion of a spreadsheet
&gt;I put together several years ago.
&gt;
&gt;To use it you specify rim diameter, tire cross section (185, 205, 195,
&gt;etc), aspect ration (70, 75, etc.), max RPM to calculate, 1st through
&gt;4th gearing and the final drive. The defaults on the gearing and final
&gt;drive are accurate for my '71. Then clicking the calculate button you
&gt;will get a table of speeds in each gear starting at 1000 RPM then
&gt;increasing 250 RPM up to the maximum RPM requested.
&gt;
&gt;This was helpful for determining how different tire sizes impacted my
&gt;cuising speeds. I have BFG 27x14 All-Terrains on my Westy and originally
&gt;created this so that I could check the difference from the stock size. 
&gt;
&gt;Hope it's helpful,
&gt;
&gt;Scott
