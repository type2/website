Subject: Is it my generator?

So the generator light is flickering in the '59 bus.  It stays off
at idle, but as RPMs increase, the generator light flicks on. Just barely.
Like about 1/4 of the time. Like if you count 4 it's lit on 1, off on 2, 3, 4.

So, I look at the belt, it looks worn, I figure even if it's not the belt 
slipping, it sure is gonna be better to change it now then later, and I don't
have a spare in the bus, so I get one and change it.  Problem is still the same.

So I measure the voltage on the generator - By the way, this is a 1600 DP
engine,
with the voltage regulator mounted in the engine compartment on the right side 
(FIF, passenger side). And it is 12 Volt.  On the generator, where the two
wires 
come off (on the top) the potential I get was about 5-6 volts at about 1500
rpm, 
and _increased_ to about 8-9 volts at idle.  

So I think I have a generator that is going to the opera.  Any ideas? Why is my 
voltage increasing at idle?  It almost seems like I have a 6 Volt generator!
With
the PO, I wouldn't doubt it, but I have driven it about 500 miles w/ no
electrical
problems (if you don't count running over my turn signal bulb).

If it is my gen, how hard is it to rebuild? Will the procedure described by Muir
help? How much would I have to pay for a new (useable used) one? 

Thanks for any help........I will have more questions soon...
