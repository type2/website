Subject: [T1] A journey of sight and sound, inside the rear hubs...
Date: Tue, 5 Mar 1996 23:47:21 -0400

Evening.  This Sunday I spent approximately 3 hours discomboobulating the
rear end of my '67.  Boy are those nuts on tight.  One nut was almost
completely rusted through in one spot but was still stuck on like a pit bull
on a mailman.  Anyway, I noticed that the E-brake wasn't hooked up at all
and on one side the brake lever and connecting link were gone!  Anybody have
these two items sitting on a shelf somewhere?  I know where there's some
splitties hiding but I want to avoid any more hub disassemblies if I can
help it.

Yesterday I picked up some new shoes, a throttle cable, axle nut, and engine
seals.  I looked in the Bus Stop catalog and they have two different seals
listed -- a firewall seal and the main engine seal (2 req'd).  The place I
was at only had one listed for both spots so I bought two.  It just looks a
flat piece of rubber -- unless it inflates like a life raft I'm gonna have
some serious air leaks.  When I look around the fan shroud I can see the
heat exchanger flapper boxes.  Am I missing some critical engine tin here?
Maybe I better go scope out those other splitties...  Oh, does the engine
have to come out to install these seals?  My first guess is &quot;yes, and you
need to learn how to do that anyway.&quot;

What's the minimum advised thickness for the brake drums?  Mine have some
minor scoring so I was thinking of having them shaved a bit.  Also, since I
have the wheels/drums off I was thinking of reduction gear/bearing
maintenance.  The bearings don't seem to have any play and don't make funny
noises but the wheels are pretty hard to turn.  Bob H., do you have any
sermons on the subject planned/already written?  I really have to buy the
damn early manual.  I have the [T2] Bentley but it's useless here.

After I drain the tranny and RGs what should I fill them with?  80-90W gear
oil ok?  I think I have some of that laying around.  How much does it take
to fill a tranny and a RG?

Thanks for any help.

Bob J.
