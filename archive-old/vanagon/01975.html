Subject:      Re:  vanagon.list group trip!

&gt;east across the northern US to New York,  South to Alabama (or do
&gt;we make a wide detour around Alabama?), then west across the southern

harumph! yeah, ok, you guys. wanna be THAT way, eh? well, just remember
this: any detour around Alabama puts you in (1) the Gulf of Mexico, or
(2) Arkansas! ha! :)

 &lt;actually, some parts of Arkansas are quite lovely this time of year.&gt;

do you guys realize what you are suggesting? a piece-meal non-contiguous
Cannonball Rally. sort of. only played at 33-1/3 rpm. :)
