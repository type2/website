Dave exclaimed:

&gt;  SALT?? SALT!!!!   Sami, you must immediately return that immaculate '75
&gt;  camper to California. You can leave it with me, where it will be safe &lt;hee,
&gt;  hee&gt;. Your only other alternative is to put it in a giant baggie and save
&gt;  it until summer, and then you still have to hose off the road ahead of you
&gt;  with distilled water. 

That salt business is just a crying shame! I get sick to my stomach when I
see the damage it as already done to the bus over the 3 1/2 years since it
moved from sunny Napa valley to St.Louis, Misery. I can't keep up with the
rust. Yesterday I took Maria to the Honda dealer, driving through that
saline solution. The bus is *covered* with white, crystalized crud. :(
