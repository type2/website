Subject: Re: Leak Free Battery (fwd)


&gt;I personaly have seen these as about 8 of them were used
&gt;in an electric car project around the university where they
&gt;were frequently quick charged with good results.  800cca is
&gt;pretty impressive as is the 2 yr full replacement warranty.
&gt;I had thought these were actually lead acid gel cells and
&gt;don't know what the spiral wound construction implies but
&gt;the cases do have six individual circular bumps.  Certainly
&gt;the ticket for stopping battery related rust problems forever.
&gt;I though the university paid about $100 each though.  And
&gt;how about that 6 volt model, perfect for the split that doesn't
&gt;get out much.  I'll try to find out more about these things.

Very interesting.  The sloar cars at tech run off of 12 wheelchair 
batteries.  They are rigged in series to get a total of 144 volts- ouch!
I can't see paying 100 bucks each though.
