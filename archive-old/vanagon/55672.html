Subject: ANNOUNCE: Hoover Sermons in Permanent Home


The liturgy of Parson Hoover is now and forever will be at:

http://www.type2_dot_com/sermons/index.html

If you have a VW web page, please link to the Sermons or update if you
already have a link.

Coming soon:

--Bob is working on re-organizing the page to make for easier browsing

--I'll be wiring a search engine up to it tonight or tomorrow, to make it
easier to sift out all the articles on a given subject.

PLEASE USE THIS RESOURCE. Many of the questions that are often asked on the
list are already answered well in the Sermons. Newbies, if you don't know
what I'm talking about, this is one of the most phenomenal resources for
air suckers that exist anywhere.

Somebody please pass this on to vintagevw and to the newsgroup.

World without end, metaphors without discrimination, stars and shrikes forever,


--Ken
