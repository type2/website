To All:

Happy Fry Day.

Many owners of Type II's are not aware that Volkswagens form a symbiotic
relationship with one another.  Just as every stable has a few chickens,
rhinos their tick-birds and crocs have those bold little birds to do the
dental work, the Type II is not complete unless there's a Type I in close
proximity, ideally one having the same engine, and being in the same state of
repair.  When this bond exists, the Type II will run smoother, get better
mileage and require repair less often.  Indeed, I suspect the many problems
that afflict the water-cooled vans stems from not having a water-cooled Bug
parked in the same garage.

Of course, no two Volkswagens are even in exactly the same state of repair.
 That's where we come in.  If we have part of a set of Volkswagens, we have a
moral obligation to round out the pair.  And if the only way we can do so is
to bring home some waif and restore it, then that is right and proper.  After
all, there are some things a guy just has to do.

Many women will not understand this.  Perhaps it's a guy-thing.

-Bob
