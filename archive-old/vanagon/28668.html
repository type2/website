Subject: Still Life With Volkswagens...


If you are into somewhat bizzare English humor and have about $20
extra in your budget may I suggest you buy (or steal) a copy of
&quot;Still Live With Volkswagens&quot; by Geoff Nicholson.

Got my copy from Barnes &amp; Noble the other day, and I'm about 1/3
thru it...There's a little bit of us (list members) in each of
the characters...

and as was said in &quot;Joko Homo&quot;.....&quot;We are ALL Devo...&quot;
