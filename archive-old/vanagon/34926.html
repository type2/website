Please give this bus a good home!  It has sat outside my house for
a few months - I thought I could get it fixed up, but I have too
many project cars and little money.  It starts, but needs an engine
seal.  Remanufactured engine put in 3 or 4 years ago (*not a pancake*), 
and there's another engine in boxes in the back.  It has a lot of 
rust, is primer color (was originally white), and the canvas and 
screens are torn in the poptop, but the cot is in good shape, not torn.
It also need some electrical work and has none of the inside features,
except for a countertop.  Has one rust hole that's gone through to
the outside.  Has the spare tire on the front and usable tires on 
the rims.

It's got a good title, a good battery, and a good manual.  All the
glass is intact, including those funky louvered windows with screens.
I'm not a bus person, but I saved it from the junkyard because I 
didn't think it was ready for the grave.  All it needs to drive is
an engine seal, so it must be towed.

A VW mechanic who knows the bus says I should ask $800 and settle for
$600, so I'm asking $400.  If you're interested, please come out
and see it.  It's in East Brunswick, NJ, right off of rt.130.
My # is 908-297-1856.
