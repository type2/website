Subject: Trading in the 68 for an 85 :(

I am forced to trade in my 68 camper, a vehicle with the type of
character I may never experience again, for an immaculate 85
Vanagon GL.

We had some good times in it but, all those dreams of restoration
and promises of regular up-keep just failed to materialize ...

I know the dealer will scrap it, and it breaks my heart. If you want to
make a new home for it, I would love to hear from you. The dealer
offered $800 for it, but I would rather it remained in this world, so
we can work something out if you want it.

Thanks,
- Will (Pittsburgh PA)
