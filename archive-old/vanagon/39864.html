Subject: another score!

I bought a &quot;new&quot; welder today, from a guy at my work.  Its a 110v MIG,
complete with gas bottle and everything (100% CO2) for $100.  Its an Astro
(italian mfg) has 4 heat settings and an infite wire speed setting.  I
couldn't pass it up.

That inspired me to sit down and write out an order for the first pieces of
sheet metal the bilge bus will need. I ordered the longitudinal rails and
the inner rockers.  I have to finish cutting off the home made inner rocker
on the passenger side, and clean up the remnants of the driver's side, then
I can weld the inners on. Then I'll replace the longitudinals, probably the
passenger side first, since its worse off.  Then I'll probably have the
pieces behind and in front of the torsion bars fabbed, and section those in.
Then I will have the skeleton of a frame that I can start filling in with
the various cross-members.
