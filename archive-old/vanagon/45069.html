&gt; Based on the info from my books here, the # 0301353 1500 was installed prior
&gt; to the 1964 model year (what's yer VIN?), and only as an option (M215, M216)
&gt; as the 63's were equipped with a standard 1200 40HP engine.

VIN# 1165853     (Sept. 1963)

&gt; Jan 63  VIN (Parts Book does not say)  Eng# 0143543  1500 option introduced
&gt; Aug 63  VIN 1144282  Eng # 0578878  Beginning VIN for 1964 Model year
&gt; 
&gt; I would say that yer # 0590821 was made within the next month or so after
&gt; that. (The last 64 made in December of 1963 was VIN 1222500, but VW of course
&gt; gives no engine number in the books or the microfiche film).

Hmmm ... maybe the # listed in the Warranty Booklet is wrong?

Thanks for the info!

Bob
