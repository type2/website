&gt;&gt;&gt;My wasserboxer motor is surging at idle.  I think I remember reading about
&gt;&gt;&gt;this problem on the list before so I will try the archives.  Meanwhile if
&gt;&gt;&gt;any of you have a clue as to what is happening the help would be welcome. 
&gt;&gt;&gt;The symtoms are constant surging between 900 and 1200 rpm after hot and at
&gt;&gt;&gt;at idle.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;

If idle adjustment does not solve the problem then try the following:

Bypassing the idle stablizer (disconnect both connectors and reconnect both
into each other) should tell you if it is at fault.

If not you may disconnect the connector from the air flow sensor, the box
between the throttle body and the air filetr housing. With the air flow
sensor disconnected the engine should still idle. Don't rev up though.

CHeck the ECU (Electronic control unit) connector to see if all pins are
clean and free from possible bad contact.

Check all ground straps to make sure all of them ground properly.
