&gt;I'm asking because when I go to look, I will look for rust around the
&gt;windows, underneath the cargo area, around the wheel wells, around the
&gt;doors(all of them). Any where I've forgotten?

=====================

Look where all of the window rubber meets the body, at the welded seams 
in the body itself, where that long narrow piece of sheetmetal covers the 
sliding door support rail.  Open and close the sliding door a lot to make 
sure it slides smoothly.  Cluck your tongue a lot when you do all of 
these things and try to look genuinely dismayed about any rust you find, 
claiming how you really want this to be on the road for the next ten years.  

Optimally, you will pay what you think is fair and he will part with it 
for what he thinks is fair, so say the word &quot;fair&quot; a lot.  The trick is 
to get him to quit thinking about what he fantasizes about getting for it 
and to start thinking about what he thinks is fair. 

Bring CASH.  put $650 in your front pocket, $250 in your wallet and 
another $100 in your other front pocket just in case it's BEAUTIFUL.  

I spent eight months looking for a decent bus in Austin, and with all of 
the students and hippies, true bargains don't last.  The good part in 
your case with this bus is that it is neither dirt cheap nor can it be 
driven away; most students look for running vehicles and most older 
hippies look for cheap vehicles with good bodies and blown engines.  
Myself, I finally got a &quot;77 with very little rust and a dropped seat for 
$350   =8^)

David!  DON'T &quot;SETTLE.&quot;

Good Luck, 

Peter.
