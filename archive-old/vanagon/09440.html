&gt; &gt; &gt;  wrt the silver socket secret, there are few things of which we are sure:
&gt; &gt; &gt; they seem to appear only on aircooled westys built in 1980, 1981, 1982.
&gt; &gt; &gt; This in itself is baffling....Dc -- 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt;  My '74 Westfalia has a 12V silver socket beneath the glove box. The owners
&gt; &gt;  manual shows it in use, running the compressor that was included to fill 
&gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt;  collapsible spare tire with which the vehicle was originally delivered.

&gt; whoa! we seem to have stumbled on an answer to the silver socket secret.
&gt; how many people's westys came with said socket, a collapsible tire and a
&gt; compressor? mine did not but then it was used....

This is indeed a breakthrough. My '82 also has the mystery socket and no 
compressor, but I'm the third owner. -Erik
