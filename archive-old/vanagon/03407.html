Subject: RE: Walkthrough Splitz

Hello -

I'll ask the *expert* later about how many walkthrough 
splits were made. Not sure if Anthony knows how many of 
our 1300 in the database are walkthroughs, good 
question! It might be in the &quot;notes&quot; field.

I've got the photocopies of the Devon Caravette info.
I'll try to mail them at lunch, if not tomorrow. This 
info is from a book called &quot;Volkswagen bus-camper-van,
1954-1967.&quot;

By the way, our 67 Westy that we camp in regularly is,
indeed, a walkthrough! I like them a lot better than
the full seat in front. 

When we travel, &quot;he drives, I navigate.&quot; While we are on 
the road, I occasionally get an iced tea or make up a 
sandwich from the icebox. Or sit and read at the table.
Or stretch out on the bed. So I may appreciate that
walkthrough more than Anthony does!

By the way, another great feature of our camper is the
gasoline furnace, which is located on the left side of
the engine. The middle of the cabin gets quite warm!
We chauffeured a VW couple on their wedding day, this
past Jan. 15, which was one of the coldest days this 
past winter in NJ (close to zero degrees F). Up in front 
(where we sat) there was no frost on the windows, and
we could not see our breath! So this was a vast improve-
ment over normal &quot;bus heat&quot; for such a cold day. Anyone
interested in gas heaters/furnaces, let me know, we can
recommend an expert in that area. E-mail me or call us
at home, 201-347-4081 for more info.
