&gt; Several differences to note right off.  You'll have to learn about fool 
&gt; injection as well as acquire the VW manual since Muir doesn't cover 
&gt; vanagons.  The manual is 8 1/2 x 11 and about 2&quot; thick.  They run ~$90 
&gt; from the dealer but can be found for less.  I got mine off the net for 
&gt; $20 from someone that had sold his van.
&gt; 
The Latest version of Muir's book now includes the aircooled Vanagons.  I 
haven't seen the Bently guide(the $90 book) but I going down to the 
library this weekend to Look at it, they wont check it out.  So if some 
has an extra copy laying around drop me a line.

&gt; My van, an 81 Westy, has been very dependable with the exception of 
&gt; normal wear and tear items such as the starter, a broken clip in the 
&gt; tranny that no one else seems to have experienced, the dreaded VW 
&gt; ignition wire syndrome, etc.  All easily fixed by your normal shade tree 
&gt; mechanic.
&gt; 
&gt; What you get in increased power and size you lose in greater systems 
&gt; complexity.  So everything balances out in the end.
&gt; 
&gt; Good luck with your search,
&gt; Jack

I like my '81 westy too.  This all sound like I could have writen 
it.

        Good Luck.
