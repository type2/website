&gt;Someone (sorry -- digest, you know) posted about the water-collecting
&gt;ability of the '68-up Westy tent roof.  Dintya know that was its
&gt;_purpose_, dude?  It's for desert camping. :-)

Great! Then I won't need one here... :-)

&gt;I fully agree about spreading an extra tarp over the external frame -- but
&gt;make sure it's drum-tight!  My last trip to the Keys, I returned from an
&gt;evening of Duval Street bar hopping to a soggy post rain squall mess. 
&gt;(Dude! Lost my buzz!) The rain collected _in_the_over-tarp_ until it
&gt;reached that magic 3-gallon (U.S. ;-) limit, then SPLOOSH.  Fortunately,
&gt;only a couple of those irreplaceable plastic snap-hooks broke (waaah!). 

The manual also sez:
&quot;In the event of heavy rain, untie one of the loops attaching the tent to
the frame on each side. This will prevent water from collecting on the roof
of the tent.&quot;
