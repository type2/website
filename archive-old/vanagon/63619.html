Subject: Canadian rebuilds

Hello Alex,

     I don't know the tract record for Canadian rebuilds, but I have one
that was installed at 42,000.  My van has 188,000 on it now, thats about
146,000 on the motor.  I have not had any overheating problems with it.  I
live in Arkansas and the temp here in the summer gets into the 100's upon
occasion. I drive my van fairly hard, a 25 mile trip at between 65 to 75 MPH
on a daily basis.  The temp runs at about 180 to 190 all the time at speed.
The only time it goes up is at a stand still.  

      You need to find a good VW mechanic and have them check the cooling
system over.  A blockage of some kind would explain the overheats at high
rpms.  Air can block a system and keep it from working correctly.  The
bubble may be out of the way at low flow rates and move to block the flow at
higher flow rates.  I have seen this happen on industrial pumps.  

     Hope this little bit of info helps.
