&gt;Hello all,
&gt;I have a set of Hella 500 driving lights mounted on my van.  These
&gt;lights came with the H3 12v/55W halogen bulbs (these bulbs are a pain in
&gt;the ass compared to the other H bulbs).  Anyway, I was wondering if when
&gt;these burn out I could safely replace the 55W H3 bulbs with 100W H3
&gt;bulbs or if this is a really bad idea.
&gt;Thanks all,

I didn't have any problem when I did the same thing with a set of Marschall
driving lights. I was going through a 30 amp relay. I also replaced the
round headlights with a set of Cibie that used the H4 bulb. Was able to get
a pair of bulbs that were 90/140 watt. Them babies really throw the heat.
Wasn't a problem where I live because it doesn't get that hot especially at
night, and all my driving is rural driving. No stop and go traffic to worry
about the heat not being dissipated good enough. HTH
