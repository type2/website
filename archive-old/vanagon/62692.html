Subject: Quebec Camping Suggestions?


While we are on the topic of camping.....we're thinking of heading toward 
Quebec tail end of July, beginnng of August. At this point we're not sure if 
we hit Quebec City and then along the St. Laurence....or head cruise around 
Gaspee. Any suggestions for campgrounds, routes?

Thanks.

Ric
