FS: '67 Camper Bus

Hi.

Firstly, I live in the Vancouver WA- Portland OR area. I have a '67 camper
Bus that I need to sell. The bus itself is in fair condition. It needs
some body and transmission work in order to be fully restored. However, I
recently installed a new clutch, and gave it a tune-up. The buyer will
also receive a child's cot, a full sized canopy that can be used when
camping, and of course, all the owner's manual. I'm willing to sell it for
$600 or best offer. If you are interested, please send e-mail to
orclord_at_mail.pacifier_dot_com.

Thank you for your time.
