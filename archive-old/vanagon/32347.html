&gt; Subject: chrome strip

&gt; Do any windshield experts know if this strip can be replaced
&gt; without removing the windshield?  I thought I could lube it
&gt; up with some KY jelly and pop the new piece in!

The *short* story is that I got a new windshield in my '84
GL as an insurance claim.  Just glass.  A year of a leaky
windshield later, I bought a new seal and chrome strip and
replaced them both myself.

I cannot see how the plastic chrome piece could be removed
and replaced with the glass in place, but it is not *that*
hard to remove the whole thing and put in a new one.

I was able to track in my &quot;log&quot; of costs that I spent $206
for parts about that time, but I cannot remember (and
haven't tracked down the receipt yet) how much was for the
seal and how much was for the chrome strip.  The Bus Boys
catalog lists a Vanagon windshield seal for $106.20 (with or
without the groove), but I don't see that they have the
chrome strip.  Maybe they sell it by the foot or something,
but it doesn't stand out in the catalog.

BTDT, no leaky windshield and new chrome strip.
