check out
http://www.vuw.ac.nz/who/Amy.Gale/recipes/other-sites.html
and search for the word &quot;coffee&quot; or the word &quot;drink&quot;
That gives you lots of links.

My page (http://wuecon.wustl_dot_edu/~samid/) also has a link to Amy's page.
Which reminds me to tell you that more Busses by the Arch pictures will be
posted sometime this week, as soon as our scanner is back on line.
