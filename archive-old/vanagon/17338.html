&gt;The vent
&gt;to the back would seem to have to come from under the dash and get
&gt;distributed to the doors to empty out in the rear....I don't seem
&gt;to see any provision for that in mine....Hmmm.

The vent to the rear floor mounted vents comes off the main air duct under 
the bus.  There is a control cable which comes out under the drivers seat.
