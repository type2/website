Has anyone tried changing the thermostat and fan switch to a lower temp
set up?  Is there such a thing for Vanagons?  Of course, if the fan's a 
noisy beast, you may not want to do this, but it *should* run cooler, no?
You might also look into a product called &quot;Water Wetter&quot; from RedLine;
it won't magically keep your needle from moving, but if it does start to broil
in there, it really does hold the temp. down (I've seen it, on the wife's car).
