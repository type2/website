Subject: fridge smells hot

I recently purchased an '84 Westy and am sorting things out.  The Dometic
fridge works fine on electric.  I tried it on gas for the first time last
week-end and it lit right up.  However, a few minutes later a very acrid
burning smell was emitted.  Could see no smoke so I watched carefully for a
couple of hours.  The smell remained strong but the fridge got cold.  I blew
out all vents with compressed air in case of debris but found none.  At one
point, it sounded like a small cooling fan came on but it went back off and
I never heard it again.  My father and fellow VW fan is ready to yank the
whole unit out which I would very much like to avoid.  Does anyone have any
advice??
