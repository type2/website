Subject: Little Martha drove under her own power!

	Friends,
	Last night, at 9:30pm, I fired up Little Martha, backed up the
driveway a bit further to make sure everything worked, then drove out and
made one circle in the cul-de-sac and parked  back in the driveway, 
facing uphill.
	Thanks to my beloved brother Ian Abbott, my neighbor Bill Morey, 
my fiancee Jean Delaney, my friend Kevin Hoffmann, all my neighbors, 
the support and inspiration of this group, all my friends who have listened 
to me talk about this for the last 18 months, Brian Verbeek for the belly-
box latches, Sami Dakhlia for the parts catalog and Eric Lindberd for metric 
sheet-metal screws.
	Hurrah and thank you!

	Paid suppliers included:
	ECI for the engine, RMMW for hard parts, WCM for rubber parts, 
Wolfburg West for more parts, Bugformance in Sunnyvale for yet more parts, 
Bus-Boys for a kind exchange and just a few more parts, Mill Supply for
sheetmetal, VW Used Parts Center and Pick-And-Pull for used parts, Kirkwood 
Hardware and Orchard Supply Hardware for nuts, bolts, paint, etc, Grand Auto 
for lightbulbs, oil, etc, Midas Mufflers on White Oaks for welding, George 
and Doug at Antonio VW for factory parts, neoprene novelties and my own 
copy of the parts fiche (I worship you) and don't forget the locksmith 
at Union and Curtner for match-keying the door-locks!
	Thank you too!

	I still have to set the idle, fix the emergency flashers (turn 
signals work but flashers don't), pump up the left tires and rear air-shocks 
(yeah, I know) and bolt on the rear bumper. Then the smog check, safety
inspection and official wieghing (all trucks are 'commercial vehicles' in
CA...). At some point I'll figure out the door lock problem, and thank
you especially, Clara, for persisting in explaining the workings of the
latch mechanism
	
	Special thanks to Rich, The Rubins, The Kautzes, and Bradley for 
celibrating the installation of the engine with such enthusiasm, and
extra special thanks also to Christian for tunes!

	Even with, as it turned out, about 5lb of air pressure in
the left-front tire and the engine not idling happily, I've seldom
had a happier trip than last night's brief excursion!

	In the 14 months the truck has been parked in my driveway,
I've had two notes left on it offering to buy it...

	There's a poem by Rumi to the effect, &quot;Go ahead, start a
vast, impractical project! Its the human thing to do!&quot; Yeah!
