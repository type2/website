Subject: 1984 Vanagon Sale: Need Advice

I want to sell my 84 Vanagon and need advice on how to set a fair price.

I'd appreciate comments and/or reccomendations. The data:

1984 Vanagon Wolfsburg Edition/Weekender Package
Blue exterior, Blue Corduroy Interior
Wasserboxer
PS/AC/Compact Disk 
195K Miles Total
New engine, rebuilt clutch at 156K miles
Original transmission
New waterpump at 160K miles
New alternator at 125K miles
New Gas Tank at 170K miles
New Power Steering yoke at 160K miles
New windshield 1995
Driver and front Passenger seats frayed under seat covers
Some corrosion bubbling in right rear wheel wells/not broken through
Drives/tracks really well, still feels tight.

Thanks in advance..
