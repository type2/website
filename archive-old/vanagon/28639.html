Subject: Re: Tragic story: Wonder what failed?

Mark writes about the tragic story about the home built aircraft.

I would like to add that the story I read indicated he made several 
runs down the runway before trying to fly the aircraft.

He apparently made 4 runs and that it was unfortunate the 
engine failed on the 5th attempt. 

And now you know...  the rest of the story.
