&gt;Hi,
&gt;
&gt;I own a 1991 Vanagon (fuel injection) and for the last two months it has 
&gt;been idling at 2000 rpm. When the problem started last July (my God has 
&gt;it bee this long!) the car would only idle at high rpm when hot, but for 
&gt;the last two months no matter what the temperature it almost immediatly 
&gt;after starting it goes up to 2000 rpm.
&gt;
&gt;Can anybody help ?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks

I'll take a stab at this.  If you're lucky like me, VW put a $94 idle
stabilizer on your vehicle, too.  When my '91 Jetta is hot it idles at
1500-3000 RPM depending upon how many people are looking at me.  At least on
my Jetta, the idle stabilizer is a cylindrical-lookin' thing that sits on
the intake manifold with hoses 'n' stuff running into it.  If you have one
of these, try hitting it with a wrench or something and see if the idle
changes.  If the idle changes, lemme know.  I've got a couple of articles
from rec.autos.vw regarding this problem.

Of course, the Vanagon may not even have an idle stabilizer...

Bob.
