I can't remember if you described the symptoms, sorry, but as one poster
said, FI diagnosis is straight forward, all you need is a cheap $15
voltmeter, a Bentley for your year and an hour or so.  Sorry, I already gave
my old Bentleys away.
        I had a VW factory mechanic lost with my FI on a '78. 25 years at
dealer, then another 10 with a local rebuilding shop as their VW specialist.
When I hear &quot;Did your van ever just quit running before?&quot;  I figure it's
time I should've already left.  The shop owner and a different mechanic
helped me push it out of the garage after I blew a fuse in front of all
present. Fixed it in their parking lot.
        The only thing wrong was that the ground wires weren't securely
connected. This was after they had done a full valve job, which was after
the same mechanic had set the timing by sight/ear about 40 degrees BTDC
during a routine tune-up, burned 3 exhaust valves in 80 miles. Yup, went in
for a tune-up, 2 weeks later redone heads and a dead bus.  Don't feel bad.
        It took an hour to check out every component separately, then begin
to check ALL wires for continuity and correct voltage.  Easy to do, just
takes a while.   Can you check the FI brain by getting someone else to put
it in their bus? That would be a great help.  It gets changed last, when ALL
ELSE has failed.  I would stay with FI if at all possible, emissions and
maybe mileage being factors.  Also the FI system is smooth and pulls well
throughout the range, and starts/runs in all weather, unlike unheated carbs.
        I don't think you need to buy $900 worth of FI components nor even
$500 worth of carbs. Maybe $200 max of used FI would get you moving, tell
the garage flunkies to p*ss off and get your bus towed out without a bill.
Didn't I see an '84 vanagon auto for $1000 last week, maybe get a new bus
:), but just get away from that garage!   Tim Smith
