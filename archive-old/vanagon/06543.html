&gt;   The other day someone suggested that a Vanagon Diesel could deliver 200,000
&gt;   miles or more between overhauls. I have yet to meet anyone who has squeezed
&gt;   even 100,000 out of one of these hard working units.
&gt;

Our '82 Diesel Westfalia wore out the clutch at 108,000 miles, but the
engine is still going strong..
We get about 23 mpg highway or city.
