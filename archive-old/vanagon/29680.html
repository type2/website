&gt;On thing wrong with the ad is that we all know that Squarebacks do not get
&gt;stuck in the snow

The first time I saw the '67 Squareback that I eventually bought, it was 
nose-first into a snowbank; actually, the snowbank had been piled on top of 
the car, which was buried except for the taillights.  We were able to get in 
through the hatch; put a battery in it, turned the key, it cranked twice and 
ran.  Had to dig to get it out, though; the snow was ~10 feet high.

Dang, wish I still had that car....
