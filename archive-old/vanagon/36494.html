Subject: Awning questions

     
     
     with all this talk about awnings, I recalled that the PO of my 82 
     westy had an awning.  I'm going to give him a call and see if he still 
     has it and find out what it is.  A plain sheet of canvas or the 
     original VW awning on a roll (tube).  
     
     Are these types of awing reliable or subject to common failures ? (are 
     they 'better' than other types of awings).  What's a resonable price 
     for one in good condition ?
     
     john the semi-lurker.
