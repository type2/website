Subject: trans sometimes grinds going into 1st.

I think I may have just missed out on a string pretaining to this problem 
so If I am asking a redundant question please bear with me.  On my '72, 
When I shift into first from a complete stop I get a grinding sound.  
sometimes small, sometimes not.   If I am just rolling a little bit like 
1-2mph there is no problem at all.  However, If I am rolling backwards a 
little, it gets really bad.  I don't have any problems with any other 
gears and don't have any other tranny problems.  could it have somthing 
to do with the clutch?  It engages just a wee bit off the floor.  What 
does that mean?  Also, sometimes if I don't fiddle the accelerator and 
clutch just right after shifting into first while taking off I get a 
nasty SLAM SALM SLAM out of the back some where.  Bouncing clutch?
Any ideas?
thanks.
Ed.
