Subject: Re: Loss of Coolant

take back the YANKEE remark  LOL LOL !  In New England it gets to 100 degrees
in the summer and my fan comes on when stopped for a traffic light , bank
teller , 
anytime I'm not moving for 3 or 4 minutes  , like on any interstate at rush
hour 
what I'm concerned about is the loss of coolant .This is not normal , and she
should check it out . And yes   the fan is LOUD ! 
MICKEY
