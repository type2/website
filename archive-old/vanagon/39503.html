Subject: I need parts

I have an 85 Vanagon GL H20 and I am looking for the following parts:

Front Grill (ruined my a flying piece of ice)
Bumber covers (The black pieces which go at the corner of the bumbers)
1 Wheel cover (lost it driving in Brooklyn)

I think that's it for now.  Where I live (Albany, NY) the junk yards look 
at me like I am crazy.

Thanx
Nate El Great
