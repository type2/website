Subject: Need help on '85 vanagon fuel consumption

After widely varying opinions from several mechanics, seeking opinions on
this situation:

Our '85 Westfalia with 104,000 mi. w/new head gasket at 80,000 suddenly
started getting 12 mpg instead of 18-20 mpg. At first, greatly decreased
power, but has gone back up. Compression low (125 as opposed to 145-150) in 2
cylinders, was at 105, but went back up. At first black smoke out of exhaust,
now none. Replacing ECU and air box did no good, so put old ones back in. Not
burning oil, maybe gas going into oil, trying to determine this now.  Seems
to consume more gas under a load - like up a mountain pass.  Dealer says put
in new engine, and gee, then we'll see what else needs to be replaced.  Other
end of opinions is, what do you expect out of a van this old?  $3,000 buys a
lot of gas, drive it a while and let's see if it gets worse.  Any similar
experiences?  Ever hear of dripping fuel injectors? Any help appreciated.

K. Reichgerdt
