Subject: heating air sound dampners?


All,

I was replaceing the 30 year old rubber brake lines on my '66
last night and spent some time looking closely at lots of other
things while I was under there (nothing like working at night
in the dark with a portable light to see the details of the
underside of a bus!) and noticed that there are a couple of
sound dampners (apparently) on the heating air ducts above
the transmission.  I don't remember my '72 having any such
sound dampners.  Are the heaters on '68 thru '79 busses louder
than early busses?  Or perhaps the sound dampning is done
somewhat further along the heat pipe on these later busses?
Anyone know?

By the way, I didn't have any trouble replaceing the brake lines
which, as far as I know, were working fine but, call me over cautious,
I figure they were old enough and serve a sufficiently critical
function that replacement might be wise.
