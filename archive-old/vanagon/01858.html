Having gone to high school in So Cal I'm acutely aware of the macho points
one can gain by outdragging another vehicle.

Yesterday I had an interesting experience: Westfalia wipes Rabbit!!

Of course the Vanagon had only my wife and me in it, and the Rabbit had
four large adult males. Of course the Vanagon is an '87 wasserboxer, and
the Rabbit was, perhaps, a '79. And a diesel to boot.

But hey I've got to get my kicks somehow! :-)
