&gt;&gt;It's my time to say my farewells to the list.

&gt;&gt;We are planning to pack up move to the Mid-West; outside of Saint Louis, MO.

&gt;&gt;Next week we are off to Saint Louis (Lewis &amp; Clark style).

     Wow, what a guy. How can I convince my wife to move closer to the BBTA
     (Busses By The Arch) location? All kidding aside, Pete, good luck and
     hope to hear from you soon! ;)
