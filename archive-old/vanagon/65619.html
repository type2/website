Subject:      Glue, heating, thanx and rolling again

Hey.

I had the well known gasket problem after 180.000  km, and it is solved.
After contacting two VW authorized garages and getting very dicouraging
and expensive offers
(new motor, new pipes), I had the local guy take a look.
He exchanged the gaskets in the passenger side, and till now (400 km) it
works. No coolant loss. Price DKK 2500, =3D USD 350.

The gasket was rotten, but the head was just a little corroded in the
center area of the flange, so he believed it would stay unleaking
because there was enough contact area for the gasket. The cylinders came
out when the head was removed, and he needed not remove the motor.

Thanks to all who respended to my paniced outbursts.

Now I want to place some thin styropor sheets on the roof of my
transporter for insulation. What type of glue will be the best to use.
Also I want to build in an electric heating panel. How many watts will
be neccessary to keep warm at zero centigrade (=3D32=B0 Farenheit)
-- =

Have fun!
