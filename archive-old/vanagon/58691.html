Hi, Lon -  I'm not sure if you got my joke or not - I was poking fun (good
natured fun) at the way you spelled Syncro.  The cardinal rule here on V_at_L is
you must know how to spell the following:
Volkswagen (with an &quot;e&quot;, not a &quot;o&quot;.)
Syncro (there's no &quot;h&quot; in Syncro)
Westfalia (there's no &quot;ph&quot; in Westfalia)

other than that, anything goes..... just ask David Raistrick, winner of the
V_at_L spelling bee......  :&lt;)

sorry david!!!  :&lt;)
