&gt;Hey Guys,
&gt;
&gt;I'm thinking about adding some sort of extension to my front bumper. 
&gt;I've seen them on some web pics of vanagons and am looking for a
&gt;source.  Specifically, I'd like the one that protects the headlights and
&gt;radiator from brush etc.  I did see one that had a winch on it that
&gt;looked real cool, but I don't need a winch and I can't remember where I
&gt;saw it.

&gt;From my vendors list (which also has a link to the photo) at
http://www.vanagon_dot_com/ :

     (Martin Schneider Designed Systems) Porsche engine kits for Vanagons
     &amp; buses, brake rotors &amp; stainless steel brake hoses for Vanagons, and
     a 'Panzer Brush Guard' - for mounting winches on Vanagons (or just
     keeping rocks and bushes out of your grill &amp; headlights).
