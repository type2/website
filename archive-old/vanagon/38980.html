Subject: re: 80 westy wheel covers

I too need one of the wheel covers described earlier.  I've been to
the dealers and found out they don't make them anymore.  I stop
by wrecking yards as opportunity provides but have yet to find one.
They were the standard covers that came w/ the vans off the lot though
so some must be around.  If anyone finds some and would be kind enough
I'll pay for it + shipping of course.  Thanks.
