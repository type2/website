Subject: halogen backup lights


I tinted my van widows with limo (darkest available) tint and now the 
reverse lights are nearly ineffective without intent concentration.  Does 
anyone run halogen bulbs in the reverse lights?  Will the sockets neet to be 
changed out as well?  Where can the bulbs (and sockets if necessary) be had?

Thanks,
Fred
