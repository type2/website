Subject: RE: replacing strut assembly

I replaced the shocks on my '73 in my younger days.  There are no
springs.  The shock sits on the inner side of the wheel well, attached
to the wheel arms with two big bolts.  The only hardship was to remove
the old ones without stripping the bolts/nuts... The van did not even
have to be jacked up...
