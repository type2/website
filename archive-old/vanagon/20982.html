&gt;&gt; Now I find that the wiring kit that came with the head temp gauge is about
&gt;&gt; 10 ft too short for my choice of routing. (Frankly I'd be surprised if it
&gt;&gt; would work with any choice of routing in a bus/van!) Any idea *how*
&gt;&gt; sensitive this thing
&gt;&gt; is to the length of wire? the instructions mention not shortening the wire, &gt;
&gt;
&gt;10 *ft* too short? I assume you mean inches. The wire is 15 ft. long and
&gt;it was just the right length (not 2 inches too long) for my baywindow
&gt;bus. It goes from #3 spark plug through the fire wall (same hole as fuel
&gt;line), under the bus and back into the cabin through a hole in the
&gt;floor next to the shift lever, then under the carpet to the front and up
&gt;to the dash, above the ash tray.
&gt;

Well, I didn't find an easy way through the firewall on that side, so I'm
running it over the engine compartment and up the left side, through the
hole for the brake lines under the dash, then up and out. 10 ft may be a
slight exageration, but I'll bet it's at least 6 ft longer when I cut them
down to fit.
Perhaps I should crawl under there again and try and find an easier route?

Was your experience with the sender ring similar to mine, or did you mount
it directly on the head somewhere else? (I looked for that alternative but
couldn't find anything from the top. Maybe I'll look underneath again -
connecting it from there would shorten it up quite a ways.)


&gt;Later, because I wanted to add a second wire with a sender from cylinder
&gt;#1, I added an on/off/on switch between the gauge and the wires. The new
&gt;wire from the switch to the gauge is 1 foot long and quite fat:  #10
&gt;gauge. The reading on the gauge has not been affected in any way.
&gt;

That's encouraging. I'm using heavier gauge wire anyway (16 AWG) so I'm
introducing all sorts of variables into it!
