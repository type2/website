... which was like waving a yellow flag at a gorilla.

The B-29 was fitted with the Turbo-compound R-3350, a twin-row radial engine
fitted with three supercharger turbines linked to the propellor shaft thru
hydrualic clutches, hence the 'compound' part of the name.  The turbines
drove the surpercharger compressors but also fed otherwise unrecoverable
energy from the exhaust gases to the prop.

3,350 cubic inches was only a taste of things to come.  The B-50 and B-36
were fitted with the four-row, 28 cylinder R-4360, rated at 3,500 horsepower.
 Most of the 4360's were normally asperated, the turbo-compounding
development never being carried forward due to Pratt-Whitney's growing
involvement in jet engine production.  

Despite its enormous size and complexity -- just changing the plugs was a
two-man job -- the 4360 was a reliable powerplant with a recommended overhaul
period of 1,500 hours.  By comparison, a modern jet engine capable of
producing the equivalent of 30,000 horsepower has an 'open' overhaul period,
determined by analysis of the lubricating oil to detect markers infused into
the bearing material.  Such engines often provide 10,000 hours of service
between overhauls.  The typical VW engine is lucky to survive 2,000 hours of
automotive service, most requiring major overhaul after 800 to 1,500 hours.

The forbears of the R-3350 are older than those of the aircooled Volkswagens.
 The first Pratt-Whitney engine barked to life in 1929, three years before
Professor Porsche fired up the boxer-based four-banger that would become the
powerplant of the People's Car.

There is magic in every engine.
