&gt;I tinted my van widows with limo (darkest available) tint and now the
&gt;reverse lights are nearly ineffective without intent concentration.  Does
&gt;anyone run halogen bulbs in the reverse lights?  Will the sockets neet to be
&gt;changed out as well?  Where can the bulbs (and sockets if necessary) be had?

i got a fog light and mounted it on the rear bumper (top side. you may have
to invert the fog light glass in the housing to get the right light pattern
this way). it is GREAT! you can actually SEE to back up at speeds greater
than 1 mph. :) i mounted mine on the passenger's side, between the taillight
and the tag.
