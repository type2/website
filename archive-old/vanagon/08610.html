&gt;A decade later and airbags are now a sales point.
&gt;R&amp;T took a decidedly anti-bag position, I don't read the mag now, but I
&gt;wonder if they now approve of supplimental restraint systems ( ie.
&gt;&quot;automatic&quot; seat belts and airbags).

well, they kinda don't have much choice, but to 'approve' of them. :) but as
i read it, they still don't like the auto/magic-mouse seat belts (and neither
do i) ... because of the tendency for people to forget the lap portion.

as i understood it, their position on airbags was a correct one, but a really
hopeless one: if you trained the drivers more and better BEFORE you gave them
a license to operate a two-ton machine, AND they wore their belts, you would
not NEED airbags.

this, i think, is true. unfortunately, and i think R&amp;T finally realized this,
this country is filled with voters who do not have brains enough to operate
an automobile properly. and the country is run by politicians who are afraid
to piss off those voters. period.

even after the laws have been passed, and tickets have been issued, over
half of the idiots on the local city streets wear no seat belts. they also
do not turn on their lights when it's raining. hell, some of them don't even
turn on their wipers!  about 15-20 percent ride around at night with only
one headlight burning (but they have several six packs on the seat next to
them, you bet).

my point being that (i think) R&amp;T thought that the american population was
smart enough to not NEED airbags, that seat/safety belts (if worn properly)
were capable of doing the job.  R&amp;T was wrong. the american population is NOT
smart enough ... in fact, most of the population NEEDS to be driving Volvos!!

at least, that the way the Bubba's drive.
