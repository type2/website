Subject: Re: halfmoons and stars- fixing windshield cracks


&gt;is &quot;star-like&quot; while the other is a straight line. What can I do short of
&gt;replacing the windshield?
&gt;

&gt;Thanks in advance - David C.

I got mine replaced a few months ago. It's the only viable option in the
end, IMHO. (I waited until the crack grew over eight inches first, tho')

They (SafeLite Auto Glass) did an OK job. The lower left (Driver's) corner
sticks out about 1/16 to 1/8 of an inch (I'm the only one who can tell), but
no leaks. Of course, the black sealant (silicone? not sure) they put around
the edge of the seal may have helped.

If they don't do it right, complain and have it replaced again. They have
warranties on these things.

Also you'd be amazed how clear a new windshield looks compared to an old one
with lotsa miles on it.


Good Luck!
Dave
