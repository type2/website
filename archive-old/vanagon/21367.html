Subject: Sermon Archive



To All:

I suffered a major system failure about three weeks ago and lost the contents
of my C: drive, including two years of addresses.  Among the addresses lost
was that of the young man who has very kindly devoted time to archiving my
'sermons' in compressed format, providing copies to all who asked.

Kris' address is:  kbrzesc_at_pb_dot_net

To all of those who have expressed an interest in reading those earlier
sermons, a message to Kris should do the trick.  I regret not being able to
provide this kind of back-up service but I did not retain copies of the first
dozen sermons and do not have an append/compression utility.

-Bob
