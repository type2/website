Subject: Re: Transporter (Vanagon) Driving Position

Jack,
I have some really strong epoxy that you could use to attach a three
inch block of wood to your wifes left foot.  Make that her shoe.  After
thinking about it a block on both shoes would work better. With only one
block she may walk in circles.     Sorry I could not resist.  I have the
same problem with my van.  Riser blocks are avaliable as legal aids for
the vertically challenged.  It should be a permanent fixture, which
causes the vehicle to be setup for one individual.

&gt; I have an '89 5speed manual Transporter with non-standard leather seats.
&gt; The driver's seat is about 1/2 inch higher than standard.
&gt; I am 5ft 10in and have no trouble adjusting the driver's seat to a
&gt; comfortable position.
&gt; 
&gt; However, my wife, at 5ft 3in, has real problems.  The causes are the height
&gt; of the clutch and brake pedals and the long travel of the clutch pedal.
&gt; She has to lift her feet to reach the clutch and, if she sits at a
&gt; comfortable distance from the steering wheel, she has difficulty in fully
&gt; depressing the clutch.
&gt; 
&gt; Has anyone met this problem and can anyone offer any hints on modifications
&gt; to help.   (I thought of looking for a taller wife but that has certain
&gt; difficulties :-)  )
