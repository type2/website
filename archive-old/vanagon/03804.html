&gt; I've got a photo which I'm gonna scan and I'll try and post
&gt; it somewhere. The bus has been fully restored and won a few
&gt; prizes at shows. Its history was traced back to the Falkland
&gt; Islands (You know that one we had the little dumb war over).
&gt; Where it came from before then, well I guess Argentina.
&gt; 
please send me a copy of this and any other interesting bus pictures,
to rapalmer_at_eos.ncsu_dot_edu
thanks
