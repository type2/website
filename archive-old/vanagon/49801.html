	If your &quot;head gasket&quot; was leaking you would have no external
indication. The head gaskets are on the inside. They are small metal
rings/washers that seal the top of the combustion cylander to the head. I would pin-point the leak before jumping to any conclusions. I am
betting on the crossover tube from the water pump to the right case.
