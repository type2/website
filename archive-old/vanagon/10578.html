&gt; I hope you don't mean the uglyyy yellowish green (chartreuse), that VWoA
&gt; calls Yosemite Yellow? The day I get around to fixing that Missouri rust
&gt; (after having moved to a more VW-phile climate), I'll have it painted RED,
&gt; like a Ferrari. 
&gt; 
&gt; Those '70s color choices at VW were just an abomination.

  The '70s were an abomination in general &lt;Nixon, Ford, Carter etc. and the
  music - blegghh!&gt;. Someone who used to live in my neighborhood had a 
  chartreuse '75 that was painted a deep forest green from the beltline
  down. The chartreuse was visible only around the windows &lt;it had a pop-top,
  white of course&gt;, and it made a great trim color with the dark green.
