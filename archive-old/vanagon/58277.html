Subject: TGIF: The Heart Of V-Dubbin' (song parody)

This went up on the type2 mailing list last Friday as part of the weekly
&quot;kick loose&quot; tradition (yes, type2 has it as well.) I thought some of you
might enjoy it. This week's offering will be posted to both lists
immediately following. (&quot;VW Dreams Come Through&quot;)

The Heart of V-Dubbin'
by Jennifer Sarantites

Music by Huey Lewis

Based on &quot;The Heart Of Rock N' Roll&quot;
by Huey Lewis &amp; The News
Nominated for a Grammy Award in 1985 (Record of the Year)
Grammy Winner: Best Music Video, Long Form

----------------------------------------------------------------------

VWs, VWs, are everything we say
And there's no other real car for you or me
On who else's bus can you do a half a million things,
All at a quarter to three
Those yuppies with their Explorers n' jeeps
They think they've got a lot of style
But it's still that same old VW logo
That really DRIVES us wild

(REFRAIN):
They say the heart of the road's the SUV,
But I can't say that I believe 'em!
Now the old bus may be barely movin'
But the heart of Volkswagen, the heart of Volkswagen's still beatin'.

The Golf, the Jetta, and the Eurovan
Are cars everyone should see
Drivin' lights and the loud rockin' tunes,
Driving so quickily.
When we drive our Buses,
Our good old Buses,
We oil 'em with a lot of grease
But it's still that same old Beetle engine
That kept us goin' when it pleased.

(repeat refrain)

London, Tennesee and New York State, Boston and Saint Loo,
Dallas, Austin, Toronto city, Seattle, San Francisco, too,
Everywhere there's buses, splits and breadloafs,
Buses with a million styles
But it's still that same old VW logo
That really drives us wild

(repeat refrain, fade)
