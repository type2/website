Subject: Has anyone put Aquatreads on a Eurovan?

My tires are nearing the end of their life.  We usually get tons of rain 
in the summer here and I would like to stick to the road as best as possible.

Last night in the rain, doing about 45 mph on a back road, I could just hit 
the gas and the tires would start to spin.  Not what I call a secure footing.
