     Much the recent talk about turbo-diesels in Vanagons. Hmmm, since I
     have yet to find a good gas engine to replace my blown diesel, I would
     be interested! Why? Because my Westy has a diesel-powered aux heater,
     and if I covert to gas, I either need to convert the heater to gas as
     well, or have a small separate diesel fuel source for the heater.

     If anyone has detailed info on this conversion, I would really
     appreciate it.
