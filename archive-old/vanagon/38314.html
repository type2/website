Subject: VAN,B.C.: Body shop recommendations?

Much as I love you all, if you don't live in or near Vancouver, B.C., 
Canada, I don't think you'll be able to help me on this one...

The lower track where the sliding door rides is now so rusted that the 
door rollers drop into the holes allowing the door to fall off(!).  I'd 
like to get a new plate welded in there so my door stays on when I open 
it.  And while I'm at it, I'd like to get the door hinge mechanism fixed 
so I don't have to hip-check the door everytime to close it.

Can anybody recommend a good body shop (or even general fix-it place) 
that has done good work for you?  I don't like the idea of giving our 
much-loved camper to just any old yahoo.

Thanks!

Tobin
