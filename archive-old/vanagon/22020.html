Subject: T-Shirt

Hi all,

I have a suggestion as to this t-shirt business.
All of us are aware how far the technology has come
along in photo reproduction houses.  I speak of the
ubiquitous printing shops that (unless we have members
from outer mongolia) all have access to.  For fifteen
dollars (Cdn. cheaper in the U.S.) I can bring in any
image I want and have it transferred to a shirt.  All
I need would be the design.  Whoever undertakes the
task would only have to uuencode the gif to the list 
and we could all get our own t-shirts made!  Elegant
solution to potential problems with mail, monies, and
sizing.  I realize that this suggestion might come a 
bit late in the discussion but I for one would like a
uuencoded copy of the final design sent to me.  I offer
assurances that the image would be used only to create
*one* t-shirt for myself.  Comments?
