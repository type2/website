&gt;Trivia question of the day - In &quot;Alice's Restaurant&quot;  is there a year 
&gt;mentioned for the microbus?  This is semi-serious, as my record player is 
&gt;defunct and I have not gotten a CD of this album.  
&gt;
&gt;In addition, what other musical VW bus references does anyone know of?
&gt;
&gt;I know of:
&gt;
&gt;Artist			Song			Year	Type/Note
&gt;----------------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt;Arlo Guthrie -	 	Alice's Restaurant	'??	Microbus
&gt;Kraftwerk		Autobahn			Bug sound effect

That trucker convoy song, with the line &quot; a dozen long-haired friends of Jesus
in a chartrues microbus...&quot;  I loved that song as a kid!
