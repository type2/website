Hi folks,

My brother has just installed a rebuilt engine in his `80 van and to his 
horror it wont start. He has determined that there is an initial spark 
(don't know how many) but then the ignition system goes dead i.e., no spark 
while the starter turns over the engine. He then has to wait for a period 
of time to crank the engine again before  he'll get an initial spark and 
then the process repeats. He has a spare coil and ignition module but they 
did not help. 

A caveat: Reason for the rebuilt was that a head decided to fragment and in 
the process a spark plug was reduced to no gap (shorted). Could this have 
damaged the ignition system? We don't know what would allow an initial 
spark only to be shut down. Any ideas? 

Could you please copy me directly? I think I'm back on the mailing list but 
I haven't seen any messages yet.

Thanks!

Steve Huss
