&gt;I have an 82 vanagon. I installed a VDO oil temp guage last fall on the
&gt;sump and am wondering what the ranges should be and how accurate the guage
&gt;is. This winter in Colorado the temps were ranging around 180-210 around
&gt;town and 250 when climbing mountain passes. Now that it is warming up here
&gt;the temps are ranging around 250 all the time. Is this normal or high? I
&gt;installed a GEX last fall also, so the engine only has around 4000 miles
&gt;on it. Also is there anyway to get the oil temp down on the 82? Thanks for
&gt;your help.

For cold weather these temps are a little high.  250 for climbing is pretty
good during warm weather.  How full is crankcase?  Try running with oil
between the dipstick lines, not up to the fill mark. This will usually bring
temp down 10 or 20 degress.  This is due to reduce churning of the oil in the
crankcase.  Next step is an additional oil cooler although if temps stay
around 220 or so, I would consider that acceptable.
