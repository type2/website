I'll second this, mine on a '78 were good, 2/3 of dealer cost, not JCWhipme 
prices, but they had 'substance' One minor problem was that they didn't have 
inlet holes in both exchangers for the heater blower fan.  Had to cut a 
circle in one side and fit a piece of muffler pipe in for the plastic duct 
to fit to.  Seems it doesn't get cold enough in Denmark to need full heat?
