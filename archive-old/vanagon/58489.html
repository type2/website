Thanks, Clark, for doing a fine piece of homework that can benefit the
many Westie owners  on the list.

This situation seems ripe for a group purchase. Can we find out what
sort of discount they give for large purchases...like how many it takes
to make up a wholesale order? 

Of course, unless the discount was steep, we might loose 
any benefit by having to pay for UPS ground twice: once to the
consolidator,
and again from there to each end-user.

Here are some options:

(1) Maybe there is a listee from nearby in Connecticut who could be the
consolidator, and actually go and pick the puppies up for reshipping. 

(2) A consolidator might be able to arrange with the company to 
drop ship each battery to the end users, while getting a decent discount
for a large purchase.

(3) Some companies may balk at giving a decent discount to an
individual, no matter how large the order. In that case, any listee with
a commercial operation might step in to act as consolidator, and take a
small cut for the trouble.

Just trying to stir up some trouble....:-).

Tom F.
