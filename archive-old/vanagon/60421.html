Subject: Re: Maple Grove VW swap

It looks like we can make the trek to Maple Grove for the swap on June
8.

Can anyone tell me if there is camping on the Maple Grove grounds? And
if so, are any other Listees planning on camping there? If not, are any
Listees planning on camping at the French Creek St. Pk.?
