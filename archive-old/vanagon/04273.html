Also speaking of mice....when I bought my 66 Double Cab it had sat
in a field for a year without an engine. I put in an engine got
the rest of the equipment working and had me a nice little vehicle
for about $300 (1973 $$).

One nice fall day, I turned on the heat. Although the heater 
pipes were all intact, I was getting a trickle of heat into
the lower heater vents. After about half an hour or so
of driving, not much heat was comming in...but I was getting
a rather pungent odor.

After returning home that evening I put the DC in the garage,
crawled under it and checked the pipes, still nothing
seemed to indicate any problem. So I disconected one of
the flex pipes and ran a plumber's snake down into the
heater pipe...

Out came a mouse nest and some rather &quot;baked&quot; dead-for-a-while
mice.


Sort of the mouse version of Monty Python's Dead Bishop on the
Landing sketch...do you have a Double Cab without so much
mouse in it?
