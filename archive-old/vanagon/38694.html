Subject: T4 rebuild starts on third revolution!!!

To all list members,

I have finished my T4 total teardown and rebuild.  It took a long
time(two months), but I made no shortcuts.  Every part that looked
like it needed replacement was replaced with a new, not remanufactured
part.  This was probably much more expensive than many other ways, but
I now have the confidence that I did everything that I could.  Today
was the big day, it was time to try to start ma first VW rebuild.  I
made sure all of the wiring was correct, then I tested the oil
pressure warning light.  It checked O.K. so it was time to turn her
over a couple of times.  I removed the coil wire from the dist. cap
and grounded it.  THen I turned the engine over until the oil pressure
light went out. I then pluged the coil wire back in, got in the front
seat of the bu, say a quick prayer, pressed in the clutch, and turned
the key.  On the engines third revolution it fired right up(Choke was
not even on).  I ran it for about ten minutes, everythingsounded good,
and there were no oil leaks(at least not yet :-).  All that is left
now is some fine tuning, a little more break in, and then she will be
drivable.  If anybody has any questions about a T4 rebuild, feel free
to ask me and I will be sure to confuse you even more :-).

Thanks for all of the help that was provided by the list!!!!!!!

Special Note: Thanks to Bob Hoover for kicking me in the rear 
whenever I wanted to slack off.
