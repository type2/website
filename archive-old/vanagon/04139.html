Subject:      help...

I'm looking for durable seat covers for the front seats in my vanagon. If
possible, I'd like them to cover my armrests (and maybe even a separate cover
for the adjustable headrest. Anyone seen such a thang? While we're on it, has
anyone replaced a vanagon poptop canvas? Mine is still good but I'm thinking
about buying one of the VW CANVAS models with the side windows. Also, how much
time does the job take?


RE: Awnings. I'm 6'4&quot; tall and I HATE the awnings that don't allow you to
stand up. If it's raining I'd want to set the outer edge down but for sun, I'd
like to be able to raise it enough to walk under it. Anyone else solve these
problems?
