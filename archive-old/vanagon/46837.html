Subject: Re: Bus Ball Joints

Bob, 

On June 26 I wrote you about ball joints on my '69 Bus.  I have since taken
everything apart, had new joints pressed in, and reassembled everything.  I
bought 4 new ball joints, new tie rods with ends, new drag link with ends
and new dampner, all from Rocky Mtn Motorworks.  The Bus has '71 (?) disc
brakes and spindles.

I am having problems...the steering is excessively stiff...so stiff that the
alignment shop wouldn't dial it in.  (I wasn't going to pay them to tear it
all apart and &quot;diagnose&quot; it).  The new joints were very stiff on
installation, but I figured this was acceptable given the load they handle
and that they were brand new.  The installation was moderately difficult,
but not unreasonable for my first time.  It drives, but there is little
return on the steering.  It feels sticky, but it will turn through the full
range...with little return (gotta pull it back myself).  This is with a
total of about 10 miles on the new gear...in town.

I don't know what to do...I've sunk some big bucks into this already.
Should I be patient and let it &quot;break in&quot;?  Did I get screwed on the parts
(Rocky Mountain is somewhat reputable).  Did I F**K UP?  Please respond for
I am at a loss at this point.  You have inspired me to tackle these jobs
myself, and I have performed competently with (mostly) proper tools,
referring to your sermons, John Muir, and Haynes frequently. I wasn't
uncomfortable with any of the work, just the results. 

I feel discouraged right now.

Tom,

Stop feeling discouraged and start thinking about how to diagnose what in all
probability is a very minor problem.

I hope you DON'T have a pickle fork.  Pickle forks damage the boot on a
tie-rod end.  To diagnos the problem you've got to isolate it, and that calls
for popping the rod-end loose.  The best tool for rod-ends is one of the
screw &amp; lever typs.  Pops them loose but doesn't touch the boot nor damage
the thread..

Okay, what you want to shoot for is breaking the system into three
sub-groups.  The wheels together are one group.  Pop loose the tire rods at
the steering knuckle.

The steering box is a sub-group by itself.  Pop loose the drag-link at the
gear box.

Now start fooling around.  The wheels should swivel freely on the steering
spindle, and that means the new ball joints should swivel freely in the
trailing arms.  If they don't, the fellow who pressed them in screwed up and
pinched the ball with too much pressure..  

How tight is too tight?   Go down to a front-end shop, explain the situation
and ask to FEEL a new ball joint.  It will have a firm, fluid movement with
no tight spots.  If you think you ball joints are the problem, pop one loose,
clear the knuckle and compare the feel of the VW ball joint to what you just
felt at the shop.  

No shop?  Then buy a ball joint from JCW, feel for yourself.  Costs about ten
bucks for a bug ball joint.

But lets say the ball joints aren't the problem.  What's left is basically a
pivot lever with two sticks attached, plus the hydraulic steering damper.

If you got a damper with a rusty rod it can take tons of pressure to move it.
 The damper should feel about like pumping up a truck tire with a hand-pump.
 And no play.

With the steering damper removed, the swing-lever and tie-rods should push
back and forth very smoothly with only a moderate amount of drag.  The
swing-lever should have no vertical play at all.  If it is worn, and you
install all new parts, it will sometimes hike itself up and bind, presenting
the symptoms you described.

Tie-rod ends are like ball-joints, they are a ball swaged into an
hemispherically shaped socket and should rotate with firm fluidity and no
play at all.  To test them you stick a prick-punch or steel scriber thru the
cotter-key hole, use it as a handle to turn the tie-rod end in its socket.
They can have the same problem as described for the ball joints and for the
same reason -- shoddy workmanship.

Spinning the steering wheel should cause the Pitman arm to travel thru its
arc as smoothly as snot sliding off a door knob.  And there shouldn't more
than a smidgen of motion at the steering wheel before the Pitman starts to
swing.  This is best checked with the steering assembled.  But you can detect
play and/or binding in the gear box best with the steering disconnected.

Your steering system is a very simple arrangement of push/pull rods and
pivots.  It is designed to be ultra-reliable.  VW bus steering is better than
what you'll find on a lot of American cars so don't settle for half a loaf.

Stiffness in the system indicates something is binding.  Find it.  Unbind it
or replace it.  Get the play out of the wheel bearings and steering gear.
 Install some stiff-walled Light Truck tires.   Crawl under and adjust your
tie-rods to give you about an eighth of an inch of toe-in.  Then take it down
and have the camber adjusted.  After that you'll have a stable ride with
precise, comfortable steering.

Don't feel so discouraged.  You're not fixing a bus, you're only learning
how.  And learning -- in the real world -- is always a tough proposition.

-Bob

PS -- I'm going to assume the problem is NOT related to the 69 vs 71 front
axle swap.  If it was steering properly before you did the rebuild, we are
looking at a problem associated with the rebuild and NOT the basic design.

However,  the burden of competence regarding the swap is on your shoulders.
 If there was some pre-existing problem -- possibly with the disk brake
caliper binding against a ball joint (?) -- that precipitated a failure and
thus dictated the rebuild, it should have been dealt with prior to doing the
rebuild.  Learn from the past or you're bound to repeat it.  -- rsh
