Subject: VW Ads



With all the conversation Re: VW's ads, I had to go to the library
and pull out the definitive book on the subject, to wit: &quot;Is the Bug 
Dead&quot; published by Stewart, Tabori &amp; Chang of New York in 1982.
This volume details the ad campaign started by Doyle Dane Bernbach
in 1959.  It includes all (I think) of the ads published from 1960
to the &quot;Going, going...&quot; ad published in 1977.  This volume probably
is out of print. (I got mine in a used book store for $7.50.)  

And my favorite is...

Front shot of bug from bumper level.

Caption:  $1.02 a pound.

Another book to look for is a dealer promotion from 1967 called,
&quot;Think Small&quot;.  Contains cartoon and short stories about VWs.
Contains works by Charles Addams, Jean Shepard, H. Allen Smith,
and about thirty others.  Well worth looking for.
