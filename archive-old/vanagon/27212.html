Hi John !
  could that gadget be the mechanical fuel pump ? It usually has 3 hoses
attached to it: one from the tank, one to the carbs and one short piece
called the &quot;vent tube&quot; that goes nowhere inparticular. maybe it was
disconnected because it was replaced by an electrical fuel pump ? if you
have the electric pump you should
be able to hear a clicking noise when you turn your ignition key
  about question 2: i'm sure joel will be more than happy to  fill you in
on that one...
    breadloafs forever !

                        gregor

&gt; I have a question. What on earth is the use
of the little gadget on the
&gt; underside, foward of the right side rock guard on the 1800 74 bus.I have
&gt; just purchased this bus and am trying to figure out what has been done to
&gt; it. This gadget has cloth tubing( cut or disconnected) going in and out.
&gt; BTW, it is between the tran and engine.
&gt;   Also, what is  easiest way to figure out the location of the various
&gt; senders. Some listing are of interest but I am unable to find out where they
&gt; are.    Many thanks     John Jordan   Spfld, IL
