&gt; Here's the story:
&gt; 
&gt; Newly bought 1979 Westfalia with a bad main bearing in the 
&gt; transmission (manual, not automatic).  Local (San Luis Obispo, CA) VW 
&gt; mechanic estimates $800 for a rebuild job.  I think this is very high.
&gt; Any option?  I was told that it didn't have to be rebuilt for a
&gt;  while-- the noise is not very bad right now, but the mechanic 
&gt; said it would get much worse. 

Matt:

GEX (Baldwin Park, CA) lists rebuilt transmissions for your year bus at
$699, so $800 is in the ballpark...if that includes removal/installation
then it's pretty good (assuming equal quality of rebuilds.)

&gt; 
&gt; I am not very experienced working on VW's.  Is it a good idea for me 
&gt; to buy a manual, a rebuilt tranny, and go for it?
&gt; 

Although I haven't pulled the trans on my Vanagon, I've removed the engine
many times.  In reading my manual before each &quot;pull&quot; I'm reminded that the
engine/trans can be removed as a unit; it doesn't seem very complicated or
very hard.  (A lot of this, however, depends on your own mechanical
experience and your willingness/ability to read and follow directions in a
manual.

&gt; Anybody know of a place that will do a rebuild for cheaper in the Los 
&gt; Angeles, Ventura, Santa Barbara, Orange County area anywhere?
&gt; 

Rebuilders of VW stuff are common in SoCal.....I'll bet by looking in the
VW magazines and your local yellow pages you can come up with 50 shops
within a 100 mile radius.
