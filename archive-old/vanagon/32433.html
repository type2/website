Subject: '80 V6anagon sliding door


When I open the big sliding side door on the '80 V6anagon, I tug down
on the lever, of course. But, sometimes the handle goes down but nothing
else happens. The rear edge of the door SHOULD pop out an inch or so,
allowing the door to slide back. But sometimes it doesn't pop out, and
so the door goes nowhere. You have to wedge your fingers into the crack
at the back of the door and pull it out, and then the door slides
normally.

What's wrong with this picture? Is there supposed to be a spring or
something that pops the door out at the back edge, an inch or two?
Maybe this spring is worn or broken? Please let me pick your brains
for nuggets of priceless knowledge, before I rush in where angels
fear to tread, and take it apart just to find out what's wrong.
