actually noted that the
doors might be easier to close if you left a window cracked open,
because
otherwise the bus would be airtight and the air would have nowhere to
go.

I can 2nd that one...try to just shut the door with everything closed,
 you haveto give it a good shove it's so airtight. Im used to my old
bus still that was hardly airtight....watertight also, I'd get a
river in it every rainy day heheh
