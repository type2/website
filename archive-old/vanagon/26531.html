Subject:       Re: Sewfine? CHEAP BRAKE VACCUM CONTROL VALVE ('71 Bus)! Shocks?

First off, my wife got sick of riding on the passenger side 
seat (did I say seat? I meant slide) in our '71 bus, and she gave me 
the go- ahead 
to get some &quot;new&quot; ones.  I picked up a nice (all the springs are 
there) set at the local junkyard, but they badly need new 
upholstry (that's how I was able to tell that all the springs were 
there).  I'm looking for a quality set of 
covers.  Any suggestions?  Sewfine looks good, but can I get them as 
good for less??????

Second:  I don't know if this is a common fix, but.... The in-line 
control valve on the vaccum line to my brake 
booster died, and not wanting to wait two weeks for my local VW 
dealer to find out that they couldn't get it (yes, I'm a little 
cynical about VW's vaunted customer service), I went to Autozone to 
see what I could work out with their &quot;Universal&quot; parts rack.  I 
picked up a valve (the kind that's supposed to mount right on a 
booster) for three bucks.  The valve has two different size 
fittings on it; the booster side fits right on to the stock hose, 
but the manifold side is way too small.  Solution? They gave me a 
2&quot; section of the hose to fit the smaller of the two fittings.  I put 
that on the valve, and lo and behod, the smaller hose just fit inside 
the schtock hose coming off the booster.  A hose clamp later, and the 
job was done.  It fits, it works, and I like it.

Third:  I need some shocks for the front of my bus (same '71).  
Anybody know of a cheap solution?  

Thanks in advance for the help, suggestions, etc.  I've been a hanger 
on on the list for a while now, and have really enjoyed the 
association.
