Subject:      Wild About Wheels

for those of you who don't know about these folks, it's a bunch up in
Massachusetts (U.S.A.) that sell videos about cars. and they have some that
have vw buses on them. :)  the videos are about 25 minutes (one half-hour
tv show w/o commercial ads), and have about three or four &quot;segments&quot; about
different cars. so you don't get a whole 25 minutes of vw buses, only maybe
6 minutes. :(  but it's better than nothing. ;)

anyway, here's the info:
Wild About Wheels            (800) 538-0539

Visa/MC/Amex accepted (i'm doomed!!!).

WARNING: ALL of these tapes are VHS-format. no other formats available. :(

the tv series tapes are $9.95US each, (buy 2, get 3rd one free!) and here
are some examples (i.e., the ones i bought a couple of years ago at $12.95
each!!!):

episode 32: Volkswagen Ehra-Lessien Test Track &lt;only a couple of short
              glimpses of vanagons&gt;
            (three other segments about Dream Cars, Pickup Trucks, and the
            Pittsburgh Vintage Grand Prix).

episode 28: The Volkswagen Microbus (YES!!) :)  this one has all FOUR of the
            generations of vw buses. some neat (but albeit short) scenes of
            some splits crashing through the jungles (south america?), of
            breadloafs rolling around town, vanagons, syncros tear-assing
            through sand, and the sedate, gentile Eurovans carrying the kids
            to the park. ;)
            and some other junk about New England Dragstrip, Sbarro customs,
            and the Green Machine.

episode 35: A history of the VW bug.

some other ones i'm thinking about ordering (since i got this new catalog
yesterday):
episode 27: the Paris-Moscow-Beijing Rally Race (there were some Syncros and
            some vw LT's in this race)
episode 30: The Australian Safari Rally (also were some syncros in this race)
episode 36: The Alcan 5000 (a race/rally up the Alaska-Canadian highway ...
            you know, up toward Inuvik. :)
episode 16: I wish I were an Oscar Mayer Weiner (sorry, folks, but i think
            those Weiner-mobiles are the silliest thing on the road. i've
            actually passed one on the road!! :)

but i don't KNOW that any of these (27,30,36) contain ANY scenes of syncros
... but i figure what the heck, for $10 it might be worth it.

anyway, i'd more or less forgotten about them (since i already have a couple
of copies of the vw bus one) until i got a new catalog yesterday. it's worth
getting the catalog. ;)
