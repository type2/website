  Drew,
    Try this. Get it to a &quot;unlocked position&quot;. Then disconect and
    plug the vacuume line in the engine compartment. If it stays in the 
    unlocked position the problem is the valve in the dash. I think
    thats where your going to find the problem. The axuator it self is
    spring loaded, therefore with out vacumme, the axil, would not engage.

&gt; my rear locking diff is *POSSESSED*!  &lt;Add your appropriate 
&gt; eerie sound here :-)&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Symptoms: For no apparent reason, the locking diff will activate.
&gt; The LED indicator will turn on and the rear is locked. There is no
&gt; correlation with the speed of the vehicle nor with whether the
&gt; vehicle is turning. Sometimes it will stay active for 10 seconds
&gt; and then go off. Other times it will activate for for more than 5
&gt; minutes.
&gt; 
&gt; Playing with the switch has no affect. This afternoon my wife 
&gt; was driving and it activated a couple miles from home. She drove
&gt; into the driveway and waited for me to get home. Four hours later I
&gt; started it and it was still activated, even though the switch was
&gt; in the off position. During my short drive around the block, it
&gt; activated and deactivated four times.
&gt; 
&gt; I need to exorcise the demon out of this Syncro. Short of calling a
&gt; priest, does anyone have any *serious* suggestions on what may
&gt; be the problem? 
&gt; 
&gt; (I know this is the vanagon list and some levity is expected, but
&gt; this is a *real* problem. It can't be driven until I get this fixed.)

&gt; I am posting from  my private ISP account. I don't subscribe to
&gt; vanagon_at_lenti from this account so please reply either to 
&gt; the list or to my daytime account: djenkins_at_foxboro_dot_com.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for any info.
