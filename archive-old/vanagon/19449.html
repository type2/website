Just a few thoughts on keying:

Some people in high zoot cars are asking to be keyed by their inconsiderate
actions, like
parking across two parking spaces at a crowded parking lot at Christmas time.
 I've found
the best thing to do if you want to cut down on door dings or experiences
like Richard's is
to look for angled parking, preferably the first spot (on the next car's
passenger side).
The fewer neighbors and opening doors, the better...

With regards to the result of keying itself, someone (SStones?) mentioned
light sanding
with very fine emory cloth/sandpaper, which is probably the way to go unless
it hit bare
metal.  I just read a european car article about color sanding that might do
the trick for
you.  Let me know if you'd like the article and I'll go dig it out for you.
