Subject: Removing very old stickers from glass.How?

Help!
We have some really old crappy stickers on our pop out window (pre us ie over
20 years old). We want to remove but are seeming impossible. They seem to be
some kind of plastic and only the  surface comes off mm by mm leaving
gunk/smear. 
I am afraid of using a scraper in case of scratching the glass. Anyone got any
ideas?
Of course if they were Grateful Dead stickers that'd be alright! BTW Anyone
got a line on one of these for me...? I'll swap sumfin?   Dave
