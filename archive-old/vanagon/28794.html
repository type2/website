Subject: Minutiae: Tubing

Quiet Seekers:

In the quest for more sound deadening and/or insulation, the
following comes from the Hank Weisner column *Bug Dust* in
the September, 1967 VW Autoist newsletter:

&lt;quote&gt;For several years we have had a piece of 3/8 inch
I.D. polyethylene tubing over our gear shift lever.  To us
it makes the gear shift look more substantial and we also
think it tends to keep down radiation of transmission noise
in the cab. Give the shift lever a light coat of vaselene
before placing the tubing.  It prevents sticking when
sliding the tubing in place.  Just another screwball item
for your Bug if you want to try it.&lt;unquote&gt;

Sound advice, friends :)
