&gt;What's this?  Care to elaborate?

&gt;Huh? (was: Re: AeroDynamics)
I wondered how long it would take.                                                 
My van was owned by a fellow who worked for a government lab. Some 
co-workers put a sticker on the engine door that has a radiation
symbol, and the text &quot;CAUTION This Equipment Emits X_RAYS When Energized&quot;.
When people ask about it, I tell them I have retrofitted the Type VII
Cold Fusion option, with Deuterium Injectors, and Palladium plated
piston tops, which gives me an extra 35hp through cold fusion. If they
believe this, I tell them I have an exhaust leak that I need to get fixed
because the damn Helium keeps building up in the engine compartment making
the back end light, and reducing my traction.
