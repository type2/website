Subject: 85 Westy no idle

Girlfriend's 85 Westy idle speed dropped off, so now it will not stay
running.....Starts up when cold and idles but as it warms up starts to
surge and dies....seems to need the idle speed increased.. Thats the
problem..I know nothing about H2O VW engines...where is the screw that
needs to be turned??? or is there a screw??? Please give me an idea of
what to look for.....Thanks.....Doc    69 Westy
