Subject: Re: Yokohama Y370's $

&gt; 
&gt; I have been quoted $74 (inc mounting) for 185/R14
&gt;  Y370's By a company called Tire Factory here in Portland OR.
&gt; I intend to buy these.  Any good reason not to buy 185's?
&gt; 
If they're really 185s, then they're probably not the LT version. My 
1995 guide from Yokohama shows the LT tire as 195/75R14 ONLY, with a 
load rating D. max psi 65, max weight 1710lbs.
Check for LT195.
