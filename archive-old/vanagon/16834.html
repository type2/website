Subject: Re: German Wants To Join!

I can give you a piece of a theory on why we don't have a lot of Germans
on the list:  Because of TU:V, the only old cars in Germany are very nice,
very original, and very expensive.  TU:V is a killer inspection process,
nationwide not local, that fails cars for things like rust holes above a
certain size, seatbelts don't retract, etc.  So keeping an old VW alive
is much less likely to be part of the student or newly-employed experience.

And the good public transportation means that it's easier to live a full
life in Europe with no car, or with one car for a family of four, than it
is in most of the US.

We've got a rich man's hobby.  I wonder why the neighbors aren't impressed.
