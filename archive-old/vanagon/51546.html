Subject: Re: mileage

&gt; it around, so I will ask the list gurus.  How's the city mileage on your
&gt; air-cooled Vanagon Westies?  What can I expect it to improve to in
&gt; highway driving?
    MY Syncro (non westy) for the second week in a row did 17 MPG.
     
    My non Syncro, non westy does a flat 21-22 MPG at 65 MPH.
    It has no O2 sensor, and no CAT. And goes like hell, for a
    Vanagon.
