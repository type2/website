&gt; Has anyone put an air-dam on their Bus? I'm taking a long trip this
&gt;summer and I'm trying to lower my gas mileage. There must be some type
&gt;of car with an air-dam that would bolt to the front bumper... Any suggestions?

my brother made one for his old 73 bus way back when ... out of some of that
reinforced rubber conveyor belt stuff. it hung down to about 4 inches off the
ground, and was flexible enough for curbs. he claimed it gave him 2 mpg more,
but eventually took it off because it scrapped badly on most streets and
intersections ... the roads out there are really much worse than we realize.

i took my factory air dam OFF my 88 bus for basically the same curb/street
scraping reason. i didn't think it made much difference on the mpg on the
vanagon ... cause my average is within the sticker values for the car when
new.
