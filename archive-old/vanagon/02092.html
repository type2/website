Subject: aux heaters...


Has anyone  with an air-cooled had any experience  in installing 
auxiliary: a) gas heaters; b) propane heaters or c) electric heaters? I 
have heard of a fan that fits in the main pipe to give the hot air a 
boost at 
idle - would this be sufficient for a Canadian (read cold) winter? 
thanks in advance...joel... you seem to have all the answers...- DC
