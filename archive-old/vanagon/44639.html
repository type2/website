Subject: intermittent engine cut-off

I just completed the rebuild of my '76 westfalia, and this problem is 
all that stands between me and the open road.  When cruising along 
at 35mph or so, the engine has a tendancy to cut off for a second or 
two, sometimes long enough to stall out, but more often it comes back 
on its own.  I don't yet know if it happens more often at higher 
speeds - haven't driven much out of the neighborhood.   This doesn't 
seem to happen when the engine isn't under a load.

I'm thinking it's a fuel delivery problem - I had a similar problem 
with my '73 bus, and a new fuel pump fixed it.  I thought of slapping 
on a new fuel pump this time, that is until I found out what they 
cost - $180 was the cheapest I could find!    So perhaps the problem 
is elsewhere (I hope).  Could be the pressure regulator, or the 
ignition (?).

Any suggestions?

Thanks in advance,
-David
