Hi (smile and wave to all buses, OK, &amp; vanagons, too!)

   What's the TDC sender for?
 
(or something like that)
 
I had that selfsame question when I rebuilt my 2L. The sender was in place, but
the wire was broken and I wondered if I should replace it.
 
I looked in Bentley, '77 &amp; '78 wiring diagram, current track 63. I saw that G7
terminated in numbered circles, which &quot;are the connections in the test network.&quot;
 
Because I don't anticipate taking my baby to someone who actually uses a
diagnostic computer-thingy (if I did I'd have some newfangled unintelligibly
complex and crowded but quiet and warm vee-hick-ul) I left the TDC sender
disconnected and broken.
 
Everything works groovy.
 
 
By the way, I know where there is a split window delivery van (?). When I get
back to northeast WI I'll look into it. But if it's too tempting I just might
take it and hide it until I have moola to spend on it!
