 A lot of work ... haven't suspected before.

Helmut, I just want you to know that I,  (and I'm sure all the other
listmembers who are ordering the fender lips) really appreciate all the time
you're putting into this... it takes a bunch of figuring out on both sides of
the Atlantic to make something like this work (I know, I'm currently hashing
out details about the SA quad headlight thing....got 30 interested
listmembers so far, but little time...)
Again, I want to thank you for all the work you've been putting into this....
