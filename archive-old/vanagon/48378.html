&gt; I may be putting a California '81 engine in my '80 non-CA Westi.
&gt; I have been studying Bently and have noticed that the CA has only one
&gt; heat exchanger (R) with the catalytic converter replacing the HEX (L)
&gt; Does this mean that I will will have half the heating capacity and
&gt; have to block off the left side ?
&gt; Are there any other differences that I need to know about?
