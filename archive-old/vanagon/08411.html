Subject: Weird list??? How about something humdrum...

well, something like a Vanagon looking for a good home and someone to
keep it in the lifestyle it has become accustomed to.

Spied in this week's NASA Johnson Space Center &quot;Swap Shop&quot;:
  '91 Vanagon Carat, blue, loaded, table, fold-out bed, $10.8k

and then, just before I posted this I thought maybe I should get the
guy's permission first...and unfortunately he sold it already.  In two
days!  So what is the net sum total of the worth of my broadcast to the
world this time?  Nothing.  Nada.  Nil.  Zip.  Zippo.  Zippy.
Zippididoodah-zippidiyay.  Seemed like a good deal though.
