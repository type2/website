Subject: Re: Awnings

Carefree of Colorado manufactures both an awning and the proper mounting 
brackets for both Westies/Vanagons and Eurovans. I am in the process of 
installing my second one, and I have run into others who have the same 
awning and also LOVE it.

Although you can't really see it well, there is one picture up on one of my
web pages that showes it extended. In all the other pictures you will see
a slim case along the gutter - that's the awning.

The pictures are small (I haven't taken the time to put the larger ones
out there yet) but you get a sense of it - nice and discrete! In the
same picture (Many Glacier Campground) you will notice an orange rain
shield for the upper front. I designed this many years ago to keep the
rain out (front from leaking in heavy/blowing rain). Just prior to our
last trip I redesigned this to be more airodinamic. I hope to get the
pattern posted at some point - It's really a great piece of gear!

Awning - mine cost $272, including the mounting brackets (that on 15% dsct)
Its 8' long and is great in sunny or rainy situations. We used dark moskito
netting as a drop on either side in extremely sunny conditions (they make
additional pieces to do this but they are too expensive.) This awning takes
2 people to set up or take down.

A more expensive ($500 I think) model has the crank out device and can be
done by one person - or cranked out partway. I was just too cheap for this
model. And it is a bit larger and heavier in terms of case, etc.

These awnings are sold by many RV dealers/catalogues. I bought mine locally
but several catalogues I receive also list them. I paid to have the first one
installed, but am installing the second one myself. Only problem is that once
mounted you need to drill holes through the inside awning case and the mounting
brackets. I will take it in for that as I am not strong enough to punch through
all that stuff. Also found that I had to change to shorter bolts to keep from
scraping the rubber trim on the roof during opening/closing.

Good luck! We love ours - and wanted one for years before doing it. Would not
want to be without one now.
