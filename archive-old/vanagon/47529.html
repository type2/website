&lt;&lt; Hi.  I've asked around for the last few days, and every parts store is 
 telling me that not just any three-wire sensor will do.  Are they all 
 just rying to sell me a more expensive part.  I've heard that some have 
 different threading and different temp. ratings.  Anyway, does anyone 
 here know the deal for sure?  I've asked a few parts stores for a generic 
 3-wire sensor, and they claim not to have one.
 
 I'd like to get back on the road, so any help would be appreciated.

So far, I have only come across a Chrysler sensor that does not work in the
VW,  If it has a black and two white wires, it should work.  If the wires are
red, black, and grey, it will not work.  Ask for a Standard SG-24.  It will
work.

Dennis.
