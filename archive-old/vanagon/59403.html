Subject: Ignition wires

Do any of the Canadian listees have any experience using the Canadian Tire
 brand ignition wires for the '86 van and later?  The brand name on the 
box is Niehoff. Says they're made in the U.S. by BVD (?) Corp. in Illinois.
 
I realize Bosch is the preferred way to go with the Brazilian wires next 
on the totem pole. 
 
The cap and rotor sold by this store are made in Italy. Any comments on 
these would also be very much appreciated. 
 
Thanks,
Phil 
'89 Westy (Ivana)
