Subject: RE: Buy of the Day

&gt; Wow I just picked up a Bentley for 1980 - 1991 vanagons for $15.00 at a
&gt; local freight salvage place.  It was the only one there I could find. Brand
&gt; new.  Made my day.   I did see a 1985 Sirroco, Jetta bentley if any one is
&gt; interested.  Also I think I saw a Muir for Jettas or something like that.  I
&gt; could pick these up if anyone so desires.  I will look for more vanagon
&gt; bentleys next time. 
&gt; 
&gt; They also had two VW type mufflers.  they were not vanagons but
&gt; maybe a type 2 or bug.  They were Kadrons,  I saw a date 1/78 and it
&gt; said VW sedan.  There were two outlets for the exhaust about a foot
&gt; apart and had two very small heat exchanger type structures.  Any one
&gt; interested in these and I could find out more info.   Probably pretty cheap.
&gt; 
&gt; Have a great Friday.

Rex Salvage is an unclaimed freight place in Oh. One time they had a
Vanagon 4sp trans. with a sold tag on it for $150. It was shipped from a
rebuilders and had a little bit of damage on the front of the housing
where it had been dropped. It could have been put into a new housing and
saved someone some serious $$$. I try to visit this place when I can.
