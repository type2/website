Subject: sometimes it's the little things

hey now,

last night i got home from work to find my friend and his ghia brokedown. he'd
been there about 1/2 hour...thought he had a clogged fuel line...he'd changed
those, the filter...i helped him push it into a parking spot and took a look.
he was getting gas...you could smell and see it in the filter. he thought he
would have to rebuild the carb or something. me, being overly simple...looked
at all the wires. heheh he had knocked the coil wire off...he cursed, i put it
back on and it started right up.

heheheh
