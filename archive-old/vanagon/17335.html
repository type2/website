&gt;&gt; &gt;Chris -- do you have door handles in addition to the pull
&gt;&gt; &gt;straps, or just the straps?  Curious....
&gt;&gt; Uh ... I have a door thingy.  About 9&quot; long, horizontally mounted, a screw 
&gt;&gt; at either end.  I would call it a door handle, but I'm not sure about what 
&gt;&gt; you're calling a strap.
&gt;Sounds like what I'm calling a strap -- yeah, about 9&quot; long, 1&quot; wide,
&gt;black ribbed plastic/rubber. What I'm calling a handle is more
&gt;like  a domestic ('64 Mopar?) door handle -- solid, with a hollowed-
&gt;out portion next to the door.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I think that the door ventalation Isn't there because we have the vents at 
&gt;&gt; the floor, behind the seats.  Like under the walk-thru.  At least I have 
&gt;&gt; them. :-)
&gt;Looking at my plumbing, that thingy that always gets crudded up
&gt;with pencils, pipe cleaners, straw papers, &amp;c is heat only. The vent
&gt;to the back would seem to have to come from under the dash and get
&gt;distributed to the doors to empty out in the rear....I don't seem
&gt;to see any provision for that in mine....Hmmm.
&gt;
&gt;Is there anyone out there with a non-Westy '71 with the air channels
&gt;on the doors, so we can compare notes (I'll show you mine if you
&gt;show me yours!)?
&gt;
&gt;-- 
&gt;Todd R. Schroeder 

Yah, like the other guy said, the vents to the rear are where the rear
facing seat and sink would be in a westy.  I am using the door panels off a
non-westy for both front doors because they have the armrests, mainly.  I
also grabbed the vent parts from the parts bus I had and will someday
install the rear vent on the passenger side.  I don't think it's worth it on
the drivers side since I like the rear facing seat.

Eug,
'71
