Subject: Check brake fluid?

I recently bought a 82 Vanagon Camper.  I understand the brake fluid
reservoir is under the instrument panel. The Bentley manual says that you
grasp the two indentations on the bach of the panel and pull up.  Mine
doesn't want to come up. It feels like if I pull any harder something might
break. Anybody know of any tricks that would help me. -dave-
