Subject: Re: Ethical question:Apology

Rusty Apologizes if the reply was perceived as being malicious or mean
spirited. I only meant to encourage the author of the original post toward a
mind set of awareness toward the realities of the world as it is rather than
place themselves or their property at risk over idealogical issues. I wish
no one to get hurt either by vandals, thieves, carelessness, or rudeness on
the list. My comments were clearly out of line. I did not intend to be an
example of the type of people that cause us all to lock our doors. My
intention of &quot;redneck Rusty&quot; humor was over the line. Peace
