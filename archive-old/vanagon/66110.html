Subject:      Re: Rear Heater core leaking (help)!

Jamie, My local dealer service dept (Metro VW,  Dallas,TX) replaced my rear
heater core FREE of charge. All I had to pay for was coolant.  My van is an '86
with 165K miles and three previous owners. They said VW recognizes a weakness in
their heater cores.  I dunno... maybe they were lying and they just wanted to do
it for me cause I'm a nice guy :)  In any case it sure was nice to have rear
heat without the stink!
