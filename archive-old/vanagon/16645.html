Subject: 73 Kombi steering wobble

Greetings All,

I have a problem with shakes of the steering wheel, this does not occur on
flat roads, but just occurs when jumping a pothole or rock. It just seems that
the steering wheel over reacts to even the smallest pebble.
Upon raising the front end of the Van there wasn't any looseness to the wheels
when I tried to move them side to side or up and down - round and round was OK :)
So does a dodgy steering damper sound a likely culprit????

Thanks

Carl
