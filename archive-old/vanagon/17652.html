Hello Dear VWers,

On my 80 Westy, I don't have the injectors firing. I have hooked up a test
light to the fuel injector, no light flickering when I start.

I have checked the voltage at the double relay, good. I have checked the 
ohmmeter check at the control unit, good. I have hooked a test light 
to white wire of the ignition coil, good, light flickering. But, the
control unit doesn't fire up the fuel injectors. I have checked the
power supply &amp; the ground connections to the control unit. Is there 
anything else I can do. The control unit is expensive ($700), and most
probably is good.

Any idea how I can get the fuel injectors to fire? Appreciate it.

Regards,
Vahid
