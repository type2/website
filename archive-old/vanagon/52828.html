Subject: Copy of: Re: Dead Deer on a Syncro

Driving on I-280 a couple weeks ago (SF Bay Area) I saw
the result of a deer/auto encounter.

The deer looked like he/she was sleeping on the road

The car that hit it was pulled over on the shoulder
a quarter mile down the road, steam &amp; fluids leaking
from the front of the vehicle.  Very good sized dent
in the grill.  Driver did not appear very happy.

I remember thinking that it was surprising those folks
didn't have veni-sushi sitting in their laps as I'm
sure they were traveling upwards of 70 mph at time of
impact.
