a thought has occurred to me:

bradley is right about the length and resistance of big wires running from
the rear of the bus all the way up to the dash (but if you want to hook it
up the way VDO says, you have no choice).

anyway, what about solving two problems with one solution? move the battery
inside the bus, under the rear seat. that would shortened the wiring a bit,
and stop the summer boil-over of the battery (at least down here in the hot
southern climes).

has anybody ever moved the battery? you'd have to redo some engine wiring,
but it seems to me like it might be worth trying (especially since i don't
have to do it... the vanagons already moved the battery inside! :)
