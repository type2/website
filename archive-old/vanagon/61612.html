Subject: '90 Westy water tank float

Hi Everyone.  Well, I seem to have some problems with the correct 
readings of the watertank level.

The problem is intermittent.  Sometimes it will record the correct 
level ranges (red, through yellow, and then green when full).  
Sometimes it will record the correct level going from empty to full 
(red to green), and then stay at green as the level drops to an empty 
tank. 

Removing the float assembly, and leaving it connected to the wiring 
harness, I ran the float along the rod and the problem was 
reproduced.  Again, an intermittent problem.  It would run through 
the various levels correctly, and then sometimes stick on green.  
I've played with the wires, and everything is tight, and clean.

As I have a limited knowledge of electronics, would this prove that 
the float assembly is faulty and I need a new one?  Right now it is 
on green (full reading) with the tank empty.

Any help would be appreciated.

Harry.
