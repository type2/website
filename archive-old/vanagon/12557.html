David Kao says:
&gt;If the engine has minor problems then I would rebuild it myself. Buy all needed
&gt;parts from VW dealer. 

That strikes me as an unusual statement on this list. Wasn't the
conventional wisdom that VW is always more expensive than aftermarket
suppliers? I'm not at all suggesting that you're wrong; just curious to
hear on what you base your opinion?
