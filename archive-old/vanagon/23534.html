I spent several months at Ft. McClellan just outside Anniston.  I was in 
training for the Chemical Corps. My platoon seargent drove a '62 bus.  In 
the time I spent in town and knowing the people that worked at the base I 
am fully prepared to believe this.  In fact I was told a joke about 
Anniston natives.  Seems you can't tell one a joke on friday because 
He'll break out laughing in church on sunday!
