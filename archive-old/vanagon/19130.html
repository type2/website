Subject: Re: Vanagon louvered side windows?


&gt;BUT, last summer I was in Glacer National Park and I saw saw a German
&gt;Vanagaon (ie. German license plates) that had them installed. I waited
&gt;around for the owner and talked to him. Regrettably his english wasn't
&gt;very good, all I managed to get was that these were available in
&gt;Germany, probally an aftermarket part.
&gt;
&gt;Well, I want to get a pair, any ideas are appreciated on where I can
&gt;find them.

If you can get hold of a Reimo (or is it Riemo) catalogue, they have every 
conceivable Vanagon gadget you could hope for, as well as stuff for other 
campers. I haven't got one handy to check but I think they have agents in 
most countries so you can probably get their stuff where you are.
