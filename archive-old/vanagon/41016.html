Subject: Re: BusBoys~catalogs and more...(less?)

&gt;from all that i have read and numerous people that i have talked to i haven't 
&gt;heard of ANYONE getting a flipping catalouge from BS Boys (pun intended :) I 
&gt;would personally stay away from them. If they can't get their *&amp;^%*% act 
&gt;together to send a catalouge to a friggin' potential customer I would hate to 
&gt;think of the way that they treat actual customers.

Well I never ordered from them (heard too many horror stories about money
lost), but last year when Busboy Jim was on the list I did request via email
and recieve in the mail a small catalog from them. Aside from the items you
usually see in RMMW and other catalogs they did have a blowup of the westy
camping equipment (bus and vanagon I believe) and claimed to sell new and
used parts for stoves/refridgerators.  They also listed some of their
trademark items (lowering kits, safari windows).  

RMMW products in general are overpriced, though their catalog is nice.  I've
had good luck with Mofoco, though some listmembers have had bad dealings
with them.  Recently I've been dealing with Rapid Parts out of Tallman, NY
for parts for our 82 rabbit convertible.  Over the last 2 months or so I've
spent about $700 over the course of 6 or so orders.  The orders always
arrive either the next day or day after (UPS) and the prices are great.  I
don't know if they carry vanagon items, but all the rabbit stuff I receive
is great quality and many parts are dealer items but much lower than dealer
prices.  They have an aircooled VW catalog, and though I haven't had much
need to order anything for the bus recently I'll give them a try next time
around.  They don't have a toll free number, unfortunately, and I believe
they charge $5 for their catalogs (the watercooled catalog I have is
primarily rabbit/golf/jetta/scirocco).  Their number is (914) 352-1138.
I'll get back to the list on their bus products after I've placed an order
for my 71.
