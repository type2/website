RE:	Copy of: Front Speakers

Yes, I know it screws out, I had the doorpanel off and had one hand applying
pressure to the front of the speaker, and the other on the back of the collar
turning- but I tried it and it (a), tore up my hands, (b), kept spinning,  and
(c), made me very angry!   You seemed to have taken it out with ease. What DID
you do? (to the other listmember who suggested use nails in a board- sounds like
a good idea, though I haven't tried it yet, I just believe they gotta come out
easier, so lets hear what he has to say)
