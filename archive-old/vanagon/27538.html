Subject: RE: J.C. Whitney-tel., address?


&gt;Does J. C. Whitless have an 800 telephone number or an e-Mail address?
&gt;
&gt;I can't find my catalog- how can I exist without one?


800 number? Hah! They just discovered FedEx, for cryin out loud.
The only number they list in their catalog is 312-431-6102, which you
probably already knew.

Well, they also have fax: 312-431-6111, which is probably a revolutionary
step forward for them. And Customer Service, 312-431-6111. And Parts Info,
312-431-6129. And maybe a bunch of other numbers I don't know, so maybe
I shouldn't mouth off so fast.

But no 800 number. Even 800 information doesn't list one.
OTOH, the flower shop on the corner here, does have one. Go figure.

E-mail? Huh? Whazzat? Nevah hoid of it.
