&gt;&gt;         Yeow! Sounds like crapolah to me... Mine is a screw in as well,
&gt;&gt; minus the adapters, and was around $20, as I said. I would agree that the
&gt;&gt; rubber plug one is junk, sight unseen. The design just plain *sounds*
&gt;&gt; crappy.
&gt;
&gt;I've been lurking on this thread for awhile now and just have to take
&gt;exception to this last little bit.  I have one of these that works just
&gt;dandy on my Rabbit.  So long as there's plenty of clearance around the
&gt;spark plug hole they work fine.  It's when you have to try and drop it
&gt;down the hole made by the tin or come up with some kind of adapter that
&gt;they don't work worth a damn.

        And since all aircooled busses have tin... well, that kinda solves
the question right there, doesn't it?  ;-)  I dunno, mebbe work in the type
4 engine. Wouldn't want to mess with it in a type 1, 'specialy when the
screw in ones cost all of $10 more. Same reason I use super unleaded. Sure,
unleaded works fine, just super works better, and I'm willing to pay the
premium.

Peace,
