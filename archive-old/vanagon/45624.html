Subject: Unsual T4 sighting


Saw a nice German registered T4 this morning. I don't know what year
it was (I don't know how to tell the year from German plates-or even
if you can).

The bus appeared to have a very low profile raising roof, making the 
overall profile of the van nearly the same as the solid roof version. 
It also had a built in awning mounted on the side. Both the roof and 
awning were marked Westfalia.

The bus itself had the normal three windows down the right hand
side, but the third on the left hand side was solid. Apart from
the VW logo the bus also carried a &quot;California Coach&quot; logo on the
back.

Would have liked to have got a better look, but as it was I was
swerving all over the place trying to see it from each side and
stay in the correct lane at the same time. 

cheers
