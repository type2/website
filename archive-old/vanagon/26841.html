Subject: Vanagon prices in the East (Coast)

Back from my friendly dealer where 3 Vanagons are waiting new homes. 
Fredericton, NB, just past Bangor Maine,  &quot;ain't got no cigarettes....&quot; as 
featured in that famous song!

1984 full Westy, 65K  miles, original paint, good-very good condition 
exterior, 4spd, heads appeared dry,  $10,900Cdn

1984 ASI conversion, 75K miles, pop-top, upper bed, propane furnace with 
wall thermostat, large Dometic fridge with tiny freezer, interior well used, 
but complete, 4spd, paint faded, minor seam rust, undersides clean/~no rust, 
 $7,900Cdn

1983 7 seater diesel, 120K miles, new head, ugly metallic turquoise, $5,900Cdn

First and last ones are way overpriced, but the full Westy is in exc. shape, 
looks late 80's condition in/outside. ASI: nice conversion, big fridge takes 
up too much floor, originally a US (minnesota) vehicle.
 All prices &quot;negotiable&quot;, $1.00Cdn ~ $0.75US

Tim Smith,

currently stuffing Westy guts into his Syncro, it's still thanksgiving ya know!
