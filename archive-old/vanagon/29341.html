Subject: Hog Rings - the mystery revealed

Hey now

I recently reupholstered my '60 bug.  One of the thoughts I had while
doing this was &quot;how did hog rings get that name when they're used for
upholstery?&quot;

A coworker just gave me a Sausage Making Smoking &amp; Meat Curing catalog
from The Sausage Maker in Buffalo, NY, and they have hog ring pliers
and hog rings in there.

Hog rings are clamped around the end of a sausage casing to keep all
the sausage meat inside.  Mystery solved!
