Yes, Kate and I had a great time in Panamint with the cal-van_at_lenti
crowd.  Somehow we slept through the exploding canned goods. Now I
finally know what this engine-case pyrotechnica is all about. Cool!

Al Knoll and I got our Syncros lost together trying to take &quot;the back
way&quot; into Teakettle Junction on Sunday, and met up later at the hot
springs in Saline Valley (if you haven't checked these out yet, you and
your shock absorbers don't know what you're missing!) I'm 99% certain I
finally got my front drive engaged (though you never really know...) and
I *definitely* had to use the Syncro's compound low to crawl up over
some of those jeep roads.  It really felt solid as a rock.

Martha - your extra tilt-o-meter came in handy several times when trying
to pick level camping spots for the van, and the corkscrew from that
off-brand Swiss-army-thingy you gave me saved my manhood when I nearly
got the cork stuck in the wine bottle during a romantic dinner in the
desert - thanks!

Kate and I took the north road out of Saline and went back over through
the top of Death Valley, took the hike down and back up Uhbehebe Crater
and had Scotty's Castle all to ourselves (the gumint's closed down,
dontcha know). BTW, don't *ever* buy gas there (long story.) After
dropping her off in Beatty I had a spectacular but lonely drive back to
395, over Tioga Pass (free ride through Yosemite without the
non-essential rangerettes taking my park fee), another campout on the
Merced and made it back to Santa Cruz for my 11AM Wednesday meeting.

Thanks to Al, Martha, David, Dave&amp;Francesca, Norberto&amp;Suzanna, Bradley
and Jack for a fun weekend. Killer chili, Al!
