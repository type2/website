&gt;-While this talk of MS Mail is fascinating, but it is not Ford related,
&gt;and probably not of interest to everyone on the Ford list, including me.
&gt;So, could you folks please keep your correspondences private by using
&gt;the appropriate reply commands?


Gladly... IF I COULD GET THE RETURN/REPLY ADDRESSES! This is exactly
the problem, and also what makes it list-related. Return address is
simply &quot;owner-fordnatics&quot;. No other clue! We MS-Mailers don't even
get YOUR return address, Eugene! If we did, we could cut list
traffic WAY down. Thank you, Microsoft.

I'd do it if I could. End of thread. Sorry for excess BW usage, Chucko.
