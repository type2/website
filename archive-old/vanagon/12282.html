Subject: Re: driving my bus to and in B.C.

&gt;Back in Germany, I saw those really neat gizmos, that seem to be far
&gt;better than chains. They call them Spiders (I think) and their advantage
&gt;is that they are extremely easy to install, don't rust (cause made of
&gt;plastic), and are not as &quot;clunky.&quot; Also saw them in use in Switzerland: a
&gt;majority of cars had them.
&gt;

I'm not sure of the cost, but these are sold in the U.S. for Saturns, at
least here in California.  They are nice looking, though I can't vouch for
their use.  (My boyfriend owns the Saturn... I have a Golf cart.)
