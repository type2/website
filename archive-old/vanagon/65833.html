Subject:      FYI - U.P. Michigan VW shop

     List members -

     On a recent road trip to the Upper Peninsula of Michigan we drove
     through Ironwood, MI on U.S. 2.  Ironwood is a great little town with
     a VW shop called European Repairs.  This shop had about 12 vanagons
     and busses including a 87 syncro in good condition with 89K miles and
     the price was $8K. There were 30-40 Rabbits, Golfs, ect... also on the
     lot.  We went through on Sunday am and just walked the lot and was
     unable to locate a phone number.

     Break downs can happen any where.  I just thought you folks might want
     to add this shop to your list.  Having traveled the U.P. of Michigan
     and northern Wisconsin, VW shops are not on every corner.

     Does the list have information on &quot;good&quot; shops?
