&gt;What would be the effect on performance if the regular air filter in a 73
&gt;Westy was supplemented by an additional  &quot;medium sized bird nest including
&gt;a few baked feathers&quot; filter, underneath the pleated paper filter.
&gt;
&gt;Was this a factory option, or was it more likely to have been installed by
&gt;the dealer?   Can I still get parts (twigs, wool) or will I have to replace
&gt;the entire &quot;bird nest&quot; as an assembly?

i believe that was a definite After-Market optional accessory, designed to
make the exhaust note sound 'Tweeter'. :)  i'd replace the whole thing as
an assembly, making sure to clean up any eggshells as well.
