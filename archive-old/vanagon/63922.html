Subject: Refrig for 84 Westy

Greetings to all:

Second owner of 84 Westy in need of a replacement refrig.  The
origninal, as we all know was like a fine women; Kind but Tempermental!

Mine has been that was and has finally quit on all three circuits.  

Anyone have suggestions for a modern replacement?
