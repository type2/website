Subject: Have a laugh.  (WAY out of sight of topic)

After 20 years I found an old classmate from highschool with help from a
nice listee (Miriam Argron, Claris Home page list) =


We have been corresponding, and tonight he sent me a collection of
wisdom of life quotes. It is off off off topic, but I take the risk of
being flamed for messing up the archives, waisting bandwith etc. Read on
and have a few laughs. =


The credit goes to my friend, Kim Nyegaard, who emigrated from Denmark
to the US 25 years ago and has a successful softwarebusiness. His site
is at
http://www.eriss_dot_com/

Feel free to spread them on the net in your signatures and make the
world laugh. If you distribute them all to other newsgroups - I=B4d
encourage that - sorry listpurists - let the credit go to Kim, who
collected them.
So here they come...
