Well, ahem.... Tap,Tap,Tap....Is this thing on?

Hi!

My name is Kevin Murray and I am a &quot;Lurker&quot;

Can I have my coin now please, or do I hafta give a speech?

Without painfully beating a rather tired horse I should fess up
and admit to being an active voyeur.vanagon.sic.( puppy ) but
add to my defense by saying that &quot;I am recovering....&quot; and intend
from this point forward to participate more openly (and as time
permits) in the dissapation of the myth that all VW partners are
either going to college or coming from a faculty meeting..

I also fully confess to being the rather sordid type of VW consort 
that weakens each time they pass a VW with a 4-sale sign. It doesn't matter
whether I already have one (I now have 3 `69 vanilla beetles!). 
it is just the thought of rescuing another stray from potential Wrent
-A-Wreck servitude that has me reaching for my wallet.

It has only  been with the loving support of my wife (74 412 wagon) and my
daughter ( 69 beetle) that I am able to live day by day in the world of
 Plymouth &quot;Volares&quot; and  Metallic Burgandy MiniVans!

Thank you for being the greatest support group ever..I mean that
really. I'd like to thank my agent for standing behind my creative
decisions.....Oops, Oscar's were last night. Sorry, Braincloud.....
