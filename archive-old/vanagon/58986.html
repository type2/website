Hi VW Van Fans

Wife and I are about to sign ourselves away for the 1997 EV Winnie. Does 
anybody have any words of reservation or encouragement? We need your 
advice. We appreciate your advice.

Is it a good product?

I have recently heard that VW service at the dealers is very costly, and 
frustrating?!

Will it hold its value and does it hold up well?

Anything else we should know before me make this (nervous) commitment?

wishing you well: THANKS!
