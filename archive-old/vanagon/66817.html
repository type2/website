Subject:      MN Fall Colors/Bare Trees Run

This is a repeat of last week's notice.  The forecast for Saturday is 65 F
and partly cloudy.  (Please be assured that today's early season snow will
be long gone, but the leaves are still close to peak.)

Meet at riverside park in Cold Spring, MN (15 miles south of St. Cloud on
MN Hwy 23) at 1:00 pm on Saturday, 10-18.  Driving tour of wooded
countryside, along with picnic and pleasantries, is planned.  Camp free
near St. Joseph, MN that night at a campground with electric hookups and
toilets.  Bring food and firewood.

Your genial hosts are Jack and Bev Gustafson.  Contact them either by
e-mail: zanshin_at_cloudnet_dot_com
or by phone (320) 252-0144.  Please RSVP ASAP.

All VWers are cordially invited.  I hope some of you fellow listees are
able to attend.
