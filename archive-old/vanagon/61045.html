Subject: nylon window slides

VW no longer stocks replacement nylon window slides.  All they stock is a
complete window glass with the aluminum bar attached with nylon slides as
part of the aluminum bar.  This requires replacement of the entire window.

Does anyone know of a source for the nylon slides that will just slip in
where the old ones fell out? I need them for my 88 camper.
