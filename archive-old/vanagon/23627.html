        Hi all

        Started working on the bed of my truck this week end.

        And have noticed some thing which is a curiosity to me!

        I have noticed A braised ( silver soldered ) spot,

        From the edge of the bed, in line,at every other rib
        
        to the opposit side. Thies spots repeat in lines 
        
        approximately 20 inches from the rear of the bed to 

        the cab, ( 4 times accross the bed ).

        Looking on the underside of the plate the spots are 
        
        noticable there too, but do not aligne with any thing. 

        as if they were intentionally placed there for fraiming 

        or structure support.

        Any one out there noticed any thing like this on your

        pickemup, I guess it's some thing a PO had done.
