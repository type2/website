Subject: Bleeding system??


	I too am suffering from the blinking coolant light on my '85 
vanagon.  I'm sure that bleeding the system would probably solve the 
problem.  Don't ask me why, I just think so.  Anyway..people keep writing 
to bleed according to Bentley.  What are you guys talking about??  I've 
read over section 19 about ten times now, and the only mention I see of 
bleeding is to open both the screw in the radiator, and the valve in the 
engine when replacing thecoolant.  Well....I don't wanna replace the 
coolant quite yet....I just wanna bleed the sucker.  SHould I just open 
both valves and the air will rush out?  Should the engine be running?  
Should the coolant be hot, or cold?  DO I need to jack up the front of 
the car like I do to cahnge the coolant?  I have this fear that if I open 
the valves, air will somehow rush in, instead of out.  I know this 
probably doesn't make sense physically, but I just need someone else's 
opinion.  Thanks for any and all help!!!
