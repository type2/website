Hello,

The one way vacuum valve lets the hose toward the front of the bus act as a 
vacuum reservoir.  This allows a few power assisted stops after the engine 
stops.  Front engine cars have a vacuum reservoir (a canister) for this 
purpose since the hose is much shorter.  (It is interesting to think about 
using a bigger container to store more of nothing.)

Sure it could leak.

Mike
