Subject: Re: Syncro seal

&gt;When getting a price from the dealer for a rear seal (crankshaft pulley) I
&gt;was told that the Sycro uses a different seal. Evidently they use a two part
&gt;seal that cost about $180 for the set, compared to a regular Vanagon seal
&gt;that runs about $15. He had no explaination for the difference. Has anyone
&gt;had experience with this and could a regular seal be used.
&gt;This is a VW reman. engine, what are the odds that the PO (probably
&gt;unknowingly) installed a regular engine, can I tell from the engine number?

This is a really good point, what IS the diff between Syncro and 2WD that
needs this kind of seal? Only thing I can think of is for Syncros deep water
fording, which would be pretty valid reason too!!  Anyone else?  Tim
