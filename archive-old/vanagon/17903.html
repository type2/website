Does anyone have any recommendations for roof racks that will fit my '73
Westy? I'm looking at Yakima, their Hi-Rise Towers, with maybe the
&quot;side-loader&quot; or &quot;wide-body&quot; adaptors. Putting the side-loaders on the
fiberglass poptop doesn't seem too sturdy. I'm even contemplating cutting
out some notches in the bottom edge of the poptop so that the wide-body
adaptors could be bolted to the roof metal. A clerk told me that they put
the hi-riser towers on a '74 Westy, but only in the back, over the luggage
rack where it isn't so high -- said they fit there on the gutters okay, and
they only carried bikes. I want to put my 85 pound 17' square stern canoe on
there. 
   Please e-mail me as I only read the list on the web site.

Microsoft isn't the answer. Microsoft is the question, and the answer is NO.
