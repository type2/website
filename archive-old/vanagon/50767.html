Subject: Wasser Hosses (Water Hoses)

I have seen a few messages on replacing water hoses on a Vanagon and the 
exorbitant rate being charged by VW on the hose sets. I live in the 
Clear Lake area of Houston/Galveston where the marine industry for 
yachting is huge. I purchase much of the oil line and other neat 
fittings and such from marine hardware stores here. I am sure they have 
coolant hose on the roll for applications on yachts. If someone knows an 
exact diameter (if it is metric, it will have to cross to SAE) and I 
will check on how much per foot. I use one place that has every kind of 
engine hose you can imagine and all sold by the foot. I don't know if 
there are any hard turns in the hose that might present problems in 
collapsing the hose not being pre-formed, but if there is there would be 
the possibility of putting a stainless-steel spring inside the hose at 
that point to keep it open in the bend. Just an idea, I will research 
this if anyone is interested.
