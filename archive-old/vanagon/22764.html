Ode To Billie Joe by Bobby Gentry

It was the 3rd of June, another sleepy, dusty delta day.
I was out choppin' cotton and my brother was bailin' hay.
And at dinner time we stopped and walked back to the house to eat.
And Mama hollered at the back door &quot;Y'all remember to wipe your feet.&quot;
And then she said &quot;I got some news this morning from Choctaw Ridge.
Today Billie Joe McAlister jumped off the Tallahachee Bridge.&quot;

Papa said to Mama as he passed around the black-eyed peas
&quot;Billie Joe never had a lick of sense, pass the biscuits please.
There's five more acres in the lower forty I got to plow.&quot;
And Mama said &quot;It was a shame about Billie Joe anyhow.
Seems like nothin' ever comes to no good up on Choctaw Ridge,
And now Billie Joe McAlister's jumped off the Tallahachee Bridge.&quot;

Brother said he recollected when he and Tom and Billie Joe
Put a frog down my back at the Carol County picture show,
And wasn't I talking to him after church last Sunday night.
I'll have another piece of apple pie, ya know it don't seem right.
I saw him yesterday at the saw mill up on Choctaw Ridge
And now you tell me Billie Joe's jumped off the Tallahachee Bridge.

Mama said to me, girl what's happened to your appetite
I been cooking all morning and you haven't touched a single bite.
That nice young preacher Brother Taylor stopped by today
Said he'd be pleased to have dinner on Sunday, oh by the way,
He said he saw a girl who looked a lot like you up on Choctaw Ridge
And she and Billie Joe was throwing something off the Tallahachee Bridge.

A year has come and gone since we heard the news about Billie Joe
Brother married Becky Thompson, they bought a store in Tupelo.
There was a virus going  round, Papa caught it and he died last spring,
And now Mama doesn't seem to want to do much of anything.
And me, I spend a lot of time picking flowers up on Choctaw Ridge
And throwin' em into the muddy waters off the Tallahachee Bridge.

Comments about the mystery of the song:

1.  I always surmised it was a body.  Why?  I dunno.

2.  In the film version, Billy-Joe's girlfriend denied him sex, so he 
had a homosexual daliance.   Of course he then had to off himself by 
jumping into the river.  The film was done sometime during the late 
60's or early 70's.  The part of Billy Joe was played by Robbie Benson.

3.  I thought it was a baby.

4.  There are two references to &quot;throwing...off the bridge&quot;.  One is 
about throwing &quot;something&quot; and the second is about throwing &quot;flowers,&quot; 
but the mystery was essentially: did Billy jump?  Was he thrown?  Did 
he jump/she chicken out?  Who knows!

5.  I remember seeing Bobby Gentry singing that on the Glen Campbell 
show.  I think she also did it on the Smothers Brothers too.  Number 
1 songin I think the year 1969 on some radio stations.

6.  The whole point of Ode to Billy Joe is that at first
everyone thinks she's jumped off the bridge, but in the last 
verse
we learn that she and someone were seen *throwing* something
off that bridge

7.  I do know that. They were engaged to be married. She threw his 
engagement ring off the bridge. It was just a day or two later Billie Joe 
jumped from the same bridge. She had broken up with him.

8.  And in the &quot;Ode to Billy Jo&quot; movie, it was a childs rag doll that 
was thrown from the bridge.  I don't believe it was ever revealed what 
it was in the song that inspired the film.
