Subject: Gas in Oil/happy ending

Hi volksfolks,

Some of you will recall my long saga about finding gas in my oil, and how
after changing the fuel pump and rebuilding the carb, my bus wouldn't start.
Turned out to be some bum spark plugs which were pretty new, argh.

Anyway, I went to fill up with gas the other day, first time since the fix.
Expected to put 8 or so gallons in after having gone 80 miles (it's been
cold, and I take short trips), but only needed 4.

So hurray for that but boohoo for the past few months where I've been
getting 10mpg and thinking it was just that it was cold.  I'll do a
compression test and post the results, hope they're not too scary.
