Subject: Box for luggage rack

I met some folks Saturday with a mint '85 Westy they bought new in Germany.
It has 160,000 miles on it but is in absolutely pristine condition. Wow!

Anyway, they are not on the list but we got to talking and they raised a
question I've been wondering about. Has anyone out there found a plastic
bin (with top) that fits smartly in the front luggage rack? They recently
bought a Rubbermaid they thought would do the trick but it was too long.
Like many of us, they have done the tarp and bungee cords/net routine, but
hope someone has a better solution. Any ideas out there?
