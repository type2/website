Subject: Re: T4 Engine Overhaul

Marcus and the List,

My interpretation of the valve guide wear is excessive side-loading.
 Discovering the rockers are 1.4:1 is part of the reason but the principle
culprit appears to be the stock adjusters.

Replacing the stock adjuster with a swivel-foot type should reduce the
side-load by at least half.

Sami pointed out that the late Gene Berg had told him his swivel foot kit
would not work on a Type IV engine.  The key word there is 'kit'.  Berg's
swivil-foot adjusters DO fit the T4 rockers, but the spacers included in the
kit are for the heads of an upright engine -- the T4 uses eight rocker arm
studs vs. four and the stud boss is smaller, the spacers in the Berg kit will
hang over and obstruct the rockers.

Making new spacers to readjust the valve train geometery is a trivial task
but only inspection will show if the 1.4:1 ratio of the T4 rocker arms will
cause the Berg swivel-foot to bind.  It may be that the T4 requires
additional height for the swivel to clear.

I'll work out these details when I reassemble the T4 engine and let you know
what I come up with.

-Bob
