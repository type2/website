Oh but it would have to be Syncro too.  Been there since I bought the EV 
in the first place.  No advice.  Wish I had some.  

&gt; Next I contacted and importer and was told that since VW never offered
&gt; the EV Double Cab in the States they would have to go through an
&gt; exhaustive certification process which could cost $6,000-$10,000.

Hmmm...  is this a per vehicle model or instance?  If we get a dozen 
folks wanting one would it be less than a thousand extra?
