    Yes,
      The switch is located right in the shifter lever base, under the
      plastic cover, unlike the manual transmission. It's ether worn
      out or has come loose. But nothing more than a simple switch.

&gt; I've noticed that my back-up lights are not going on when I shift my

&gt; Reverse, (bordering on putting it into Park), then I guess proper contact is
&gt; being made and the lights will go on.
&gt; 
&gt; Is there a simple fix for this?  Many thanks.
