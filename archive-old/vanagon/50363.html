Subject: solar swamp cooler

There's a company named Solar Chill in Tucson, AZ that I've been told
installs solar swamp coolers in vehicles. I'm interested in this in order to
travel in hot climates with my dog and be able to sometimes leave her for a
couple of daytime hours in my '91 Westy Syncro without ending up with
roasted canine.  Anyone have any experience with these products?
