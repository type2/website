&gt; Gerry,
&gt; Hi, I work with the Stebro Exhausts company and we noticed a little while ago that 
&gt; there do'nt seem to be any good quality and reasonably priced replacement Vanagon 
&gt; mufflers and pipes. We are thinking about tooling up to produce Vanagon systems 
&gt; (manifold pipes &amp; mufflers) in stainless steel. If - there is demand and it makes 
&gt; economic sense for us. 

  Well my E-Mail is screwed up again, so I have to make this short.
  I have 2 Vanagons. Both 1986. 1 is a Syncro. I will  be greatful
  to have a SS exhaust. I would even like to market them here in the 
  Pgh. area for you, If that's in your practic.
 &gt; 
&gt; What we would like to know from owner/enthusiasts is: how many of you would be 
&gt; interested and what do each of you feel is a reasonable price to pay? If we get enuf 
&gt; enquiries (have had only 4-5 so far) and can make a system for what people feel is a 
&gt; reasonable price - then we will do it.
&gt; 
   What is reasonable?  Well I would say REASONABLE would be about 150% of
   a replacement. But you will have a captive market, just don't price 
   your self out of it. I just made a universal muffler fit my 2 wheel 
   drive Vanagon, ( about $22.00), the original would have cost $125.
   A little work and now I have  $100 to spend. 

   Advertize on this list and I an sure it will sell!
   Don't forget the Syncro needs a different front head pipe.
   Maybe you can make it work with 2wd and 4wd.
