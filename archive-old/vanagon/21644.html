&gt; &gt;&gt; WD-40 was designed, formulated, manufactured, made, constructed,
&gt; &gt;&gt; perfected, and maybe blessed by the Lord Himself for this application.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Not to poo-poo any recommendations from &quot;the man&quot; :), but I'd highly
&gt; &gt;recommend
&gt; &gt;sticking with the earlier posts of the graphite powder. Liquid lubricants,
&gt; &gt;such
&gt; &gt;as WD-40, tend to collect dust and grime and gum up over the long haul.


I hate to disagree with Steve, but WD40 also evaporates, leaving
things dryer (but cleaner) than before. I have a good friend who does
locks and speedometers. He says that you should NEVER EVER use
graphite on a speedometer cable. Apparently most of his business
comes from people who put graphite in the cable. Use oil instead--but
not too much if it is a Volkswagen, because if you use too much it
will get into the left front wheel bearing and dilute the grease
causing the bearing to squeak then sieze.

I put a little 3-in-one oil on my locks, including the ignition locks,
about once a year. BTW, I keyed all of my VW locks to the same key.
That way I only have to carry one key.
