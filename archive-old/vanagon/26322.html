&gt; 	Another scary thing!  I found lots of small black grit on my
&gt; sump plate, and inside the sump.  Looks like it could be casting residue
&gt; or something.  I cleaned the sump out with a garden sprayer real good 
&gt; before I installed it, and didn't see any grit, or feel any when I was
&gt; done.
&gt; 
 If this part is a sand casting, the black stuff may be residue from the
 core. This is not good. To make a hollow cast part, a core is made from
 sand that is coated with a bonding agent and then molded into a shape that
 is the same as the space that is empty once the part is finished. After
 the molten metal has been poured, solidified and cooled, this sand core
 is still inside the part. The core has to be broken up into small enough
 pieces to be removed through the openings available. What may have 
 happened with your sump is that some core sand was adhered to the inside
 surfaces of the sump and was released when the sump was heated &lt;and expanded
 a little&gt; by the hot oil. Unfortunatly, sand is really, really the wrong
 stuff to have circulating  through the engine. I'd say a few back-to-back
 oil changes would be good prevention at this point. I think I'd punt on 
 the sump. Maybe they'll give you store credit towards something less 
 destructive. Some of this aftermarket stuff is really bad.
