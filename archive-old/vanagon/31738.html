&gt;Not seen: Antonio VW in Sunnyvale has always had at least 3 -5 Vanagons on

&gt;weeks ago they had none on their lot, and when I went by today still had
none.

You know, I noticed the same thing a couple weeks ago when I took the EV in
for its final warranty check; I remember thinking how unusual it was to not
see any Vanagons and EVs on the lot.  As Harvey said, there're usually 3-5
of the Type IIs on the lot.

Maybe the sales manager was feeling generous since it was Christmas and
they're all sitting in nice garages somewhere...

I'd be willing to bet if you cruised by Bob Lewis VW on Capitol X-way you'd
see a fair number of Type IIs of all types there; I think they're doing a 
little wishful thinking on their pricing sometimes.  But it surely does ap-
pear that they move quite a bit of volume.
