&gt; I tend to use phillips screwdrivers, or 1/4 inch extensions.  If you want
&gt;to be
&gt; really fancy you can get some metal rod of the correct diameter and cut a
&gt; couple of  4-6 inch pieces, file the ends smooth, and use them. Tighten the
&gt; clamps down again
&gt; if you're going to leave it like that for an extended period.

Drift punches work well, too, because many of them have tapered shanks.
