Subject: Re: New Mexico VW Parts Place........

Hi all,

I talked w/ Tom Brouillette (who lives in Alb.)  off-line about his
thoughts on  New Mexico VW Parts Place.here are his thoughts...

*********************************************************************


Yes, I've seen the place. Good restorable stuff up the wazoo (where is
Wazoo?). But, prices are relatively high. Owner reputed to sell one car a
month.

But, in terms of dry climate, Alamorgordo, near Trinity A-bomb test site, is
the ultimate for dry, rust-free cars.

You may forward this message to all, in the hope of releasing some of these
vehicles to live new lives.
