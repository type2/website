Subject: RE: Engine transplant

Pass any information about this on to me, i would imagine that these engines
are not really valued by the general public, i.e. can be found cheap!!
Remember that 1990 vanagon i was talking about last year (Ric, Joel,
everyone..) it had one of these Audi 5 cyls in it..

&gt; &gt;      Instead of a V6, how 'bout an Audi 5?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;      These are 300K mi bulletproof engines, that run with a turbine like
&gt; &gt;      smoothness, due to some peculiar balance characteristics of the 5cyl
&gt; &gt;      configuration. They are available at great prices from unloved (the
&gt; &gt;      ones without Quattro) Audis from the 80's.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;      You can get normally aspirated engines with about 135HP, turbos
&gt; &gt;      with anywhere from 168HP to 227HP.  Typically, these are 2.1 or 2.2
&gt; &gt;      liters displacement.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;      They already fit. A variant of this engine was installed in Vanagons
&gt; &gt;      outside the US (maybe our SA collegues can chime in with more
&gt; &gt;      information).
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;      Flying with the fantasy, once the list helps you get the details
&gt; &gt;      sorted out all those diesel owners could upgrade to the diesel version
&gt; &gt;      of the Audi 5cyl  (also sold by VW to Volvo, which put them in 240s
&gt; &gt;      and 740s for awhile) and be able to keep up in the Bus caravans AND
&gt; &gt;      enjoy airconditioning!
