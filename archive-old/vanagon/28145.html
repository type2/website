Subject: Introduction

Hi all,

I'm new to the list.

On Sunday I fulfilled a long time dream when my partner and I
purchased a 1987 Vanagon GL.

It's got a *great* engine but a few problems that are being fixed
before delivery. It's got non-westfila pop-top and some strange
wood work behind the back seat.

We should take delivery tonight. After 10 years without a VW
(my last was a 83 GTI that had 165,000 miles on it when I sold
it) I'm back. :-)
