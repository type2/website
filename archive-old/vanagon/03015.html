&gt;large intake manifold the old engine (never ran) was from a '68 beetle and
&gt;a place for the vacuum assist brakes.  This weber manifold looks like cast
&gt;aluminum.  Is there a way to get the vacuum from my current setup.  The intake
&gt;maifold  is attached to the heads via the rubber boots as in the dual port
&gt;setup?   Is the vacuum assist really that necessary?
&gt;
&gt;Also, is that little deal in the vacuum line a filter or something?  this van
&gt;has been sitting in a field for approx 7 years so I definately need a filter if
&gt;Thanks,

HI all,
The vacuum assist is definitely needed.  There is a big difference.  The
bus manifold is supposed to have a larger 1/2&quot; tube coming off of it just
under the carb.  On bug manifolds there is a very small tube there, and you
can use it, but stopping power is not as good.  I had a hard time finding
a manifold with the big tube on it.  There's no other way to tie into the
vacuum system.  Gooday
