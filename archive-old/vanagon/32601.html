Subject: need some van. westy parts


In the past, whenever I've posted to the list that I needed this part or
that, people have been very kind and remembered, sent me parts they either
had as extra, or happened to remember seeing in their local wreck yard.

Out of the possibility that anyone has an extra, I'll try again.  I
need the following for the vanagon years westfaila camper:

1.  refrigerator rack  (these come in a shallow depth for the upper spot,
    and a deeper depth for the lower spot - it's the lower, larger one I need)

2.  faucet control knob - I don't need the whole faucet, just the top round
    part.  You turn this one way for city water and one way for tank.  

If anyone has these laying around as extras, I'm interested in buying them
and will of course pay shipping, etc.  

If someone happens to see these items in the junkyard (or wherever), I'm happy
to reimburse, etc.

Many thanks in advance..
