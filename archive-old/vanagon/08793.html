Subject: Yosemite, anyone?


&gt;   I'll be camping in Yosemite the week between Monday, Dec. 26 and December 
&gt;   30, taking pictures and playing in the snow.

Great place to visit, I've been there twice... Wish I could get some
vacation and make it three times...  The snow is unbelievably beautiful
there at this time of the year.  Is there going to be a full moon?
