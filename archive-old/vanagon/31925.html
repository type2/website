Subject: Re: Front disks '71 bus

&gt;&gt;For what it's worth...my '71 with year old NEW front rotors with
&gt; the engine running has 1&quot; of movement on the brake pedal before
&gt; resistance is felt.
&gt;
&gt; You might still have air in the lines...why not bleed the wheels
&gt; again?  How long can it take?  and finally...invest in a one man
&gt; bleeder...you'll use it the rest of your life on every car you own.

If you *do* still have air in the lines, they should &quot;pump up,&quot; getting
tighter as you pump the brakes.

Thanks! Joe
