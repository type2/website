&gt; Where can I get factory info on oil temps?  Many people have different
&gt;stories.  What is a good open road temp.  I am running a self rebuilt 1600dp
&gt;in a 71 bus and using a dip stick guage the engine is set up for full flow
&gt;but am running only external oil filter till i am sure the engine is dialed
&gt;in then i will add the cooler and fan.  on the open road its running just
&gt;under 210 and in town at 185 I ran up an mountain pass today from 7000 to
&gt;9500 feet in 7 miles and the temp went just over 250 and cooled back down the
&gt;other side.  some people say never over 215 others + a VW mag says never over
&gt;265 what gives now that i have some investment in the bus where or what is
&gt;the correct info.

        Well, I just spent way too much time pouring over the VW type 2
service manual, the only refrence I can find to oil temp is when the
thermostat should open (149-158 deg. F). Idiot book says &quot;Oil temp should
stay below 225 deg. F (180-220 deg. F is ideal)&quot;. That's all I can find on
the subject, hope it helps.
