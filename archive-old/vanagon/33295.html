Subject: heat exchanger/muffler junction

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;        Ok, we're chock full of greasy do it yourselfer's here, right?
&gt; &gt;Here's my proposal: I hate that dammned connection between the header and
&gt; &gt;heater box as much as the next guy. If I knew how, I would get rid of it
&gt; &gt;and put in something that'd last longer than 2 weeks. Anybody got any
&gt; &gt;ideas?
&gt;

In 1971 I was serving an unaccompanied tour (ie no family) at the Pentagon.
 Having no dependents, I was subject to tranfer without prior notice.  I got
hurry-up orders to report to the Fleet Data Processing Service Center in
Sandy Eggo in ten days.  At the time I had a clapped out Ford station wagon,
about a thousand pounds of tools and a Volkswagen powered airplane.  I
promoted a free 1965 engine-less square-back with no brakes, yanked the
engine off the plane, stuffed it in the square-back and made a hitch to tow
the plane with the wings strapped to the sides.  

The airplane's engine was a 2180, never reved over 3200 rpm.  Rigged dual
carbs and a cooling system but the big engine was more than an inch wider
than stock, a real problem to shoe-horn into the square-back -- and no
muffler would fit.  Heated, bent and got a thing cobbled up but couldn't get
a seal with the stock clamps.  Hammered the flanges down, cut some .010
stainless into strips about four inches wide by 18 inches long and wrapped
the junction between the heater boxes and the muffler, secured the stainless
steel with eight hose clamps.  No leaks.

(Drove the 2,700 odd miles to Sandy Eggo towing the plane on its landing
gear, horizontal stabilizer strapped to the roof of the square-back, tools
and spare engine in the cockpit to balance the load.  Three days driving.
 Averaged 51mph _at_ 22 mpg.)
