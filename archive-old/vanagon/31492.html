Subject: Clutch master cylinder question

Hi,

I have an 81 Vanagon that has developed a leak from the clutch master
cylinder. I have checked it pretty close, and it is certainly coming from 
the top of the cylinder. 

Sometimes it will leak maybe an ounce or two over 2 days, other times it 
will not leak a drop for days if I have driven it recently. It has been 
doing this for about a month.

Since winter has finally arrived here in Utah, I am in no mood to fix 
it, and I would rather wait another month to pay a mechanic to do it, 
(Christmas kinda drained the bank account &lt;g&gt;)

The question I would like to ask would be, if I keep the resevoir topped
off, and catch the drips to protect the floor :), is it likely that the 
cylinder would fail catastrophically and leave me stranded? I have never 
had any kind of master cylinder go away, so I do not know what the 
failure mode would be.

Any comments or thoughts would be appreciated. 

Best Regards and a peaceful new year to you all,

John Brush
