Subject: Re: Westy tents



&gt;Do they sell these in Germany perhaps? Anybody know where I &gt;could get a
&gt;German Westy accessories catalogue?

&gt;Your help is appreciated. Thanks in advance.

Jeff,

Their is a very inexpensive Westy tent available throughout Baja although the
adobe side-walls limit its portability.  Prior arrangement and accurate
parking are required for the best fit although the manufacturer(s) are
willing to tailor one to your needs.
