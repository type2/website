Here is an excerpt from Tom Steinstra's book &quot;California Camping&quot;

PINNACLES CAMPGROUND
Campsites,facilities: There are 125 campsites for tentd or motor homes.
Picnic tables and fireplaces are provided.  Piped water, electricity, flush
toilets, sanitary disposal station (whats that?), showeres, a store, and a
swimming pool are available.  Bring your own firewood or purchase it at the
campground.  Pets are permitterd on leashes.
Reservations, fee: Reservations accepted for group sites, al others on
first-come first-served basis; $6 fee per night per person for a family
site; $5 fee per person for a group site with a $50 minimum.
Who to contact: phone the campground at 408-389-4462
Location: From Hollister, drive 32 miiles south on Highway 25. Turn at the
sign for the Pinnacles (Highway 146) and drive about 2.5 miles to the
campground.

Trip note: this is one of two camps at the Pinnacles National Monument.
This private one gets a lost more traffic -- it has more facilites, the road
in is in better shape, and the campground is closer to Bear Gulch Caves, a
prime destination.  The jaggged pinnacles, for which the park was named,
were formed by the erosion of an ancient volcanic eruption.  If you are
planning to stay over the weekend in the spring, arrive early on Friday
eventing to be sure you get a campsite.  beware of temperatures in the 90s
and 100s in the summer. 

John's notes:  I haven't been to the campsite but I have been to the
Pinnacles.  Some awfully nice hiking, and I bet the wild flowers should be
stupendous in March.  The other campsite has &quot;walk in tent sites&quot;.  I guess
that means that car camping is not allowed.

This would still be pretty close to the bay area and Sacramento, but I fear
still I pretty long drive for the likes of David Schwartze (nice home page!).

Other ideas:  Peppermint is up by Lake Isabella, I think.  A beautiful
place, but the campsite does not open until May or June.  Uppper Mojave
would be a drive, but I like the desert, or is it dessert?


As for dates, later in March is better for Carol, Tonto and me.
