     I've jumped mine a couple of times with no adverse effects.  The only 
     warning is to have the auxiliary heater OFF when jumping it, or it'll 
     be damaged.

The last two days in NC have been *cold*.  On both cold days I could not start 
my
 bus.  I took the battery out and had it checked and recharged.  The service 
tech said it was ok.  I have a few ideas from the Muir book I will try when it 
is
 warm enough to crawl under the bus including:
1.  Check starter bolts
2.  Install ByPass solonoid
3.  Do starter and solonoid check.
     
But until then, what is the deal with jump starting a Vanagon with F.I.  Muir 
say s DON'T DO IT.  The VW Vanagon owners manual shows a procedure.  Can someone
clear this up for me.
     
Hello to all NC Bus owners.  See ya next gathering...
