Subject: Re: buying a used tranny.

I don't believe you can.  Bite the bullet and buy a remanufactured from
Transform or Mofoco that comes with a warrantee.  Why go through the hassle
of installing a trans that you might have to r&amp;r in a few thousand miles.

&gt;I was wondering how you can tell a good tranny from a bad one at a
&gt;swap meet.  At the last meet I went to there were some all painted up
&gt;purty and supposidly rebuilt.  Others were just pulled and their
&gt;sellers calimed they were in good condition.  When people want cash
&gt;only and you know you will never see them again, how do you protect
&gt;yourself?

I bought a used tranny at a swap meet for $35.  It was a 67 bus trans.  One
reduction box had been rebuilt,  the other was full of shavings, so i has to
pull it off and change it.   It also had nearly new german brake parts on it
that would have cost me more than $35.  The trans went in my 61 deluxe, and
cruised well, except for a whine at 45-50.   Even if it only gives me a
couple years, it's worth it.

try these tests - turn the spline where the engine would connect - does it
feel firm or sloppy?    try this in all gears (yes you can shift by moving
the bit that sticks out the nose cone)   How do the reduction gears shafts
feel?   This is no certain test-
