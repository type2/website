Subject: Re: my last week, bad news, good news

&gt;In a message dated 95-11-26 22:24:21 EST, you write:
&gt;
&gt;&gt;im just gonna wait it out for awhile, im carring a 50/50
&gt;&gt;water/sierra mix in my van to keep it topped off. 
&gt;
&gt;What do you mean &quot;wait it out for awhile&quot;?  The subject of your message
&gt;implies that you won't be with us more than a WEEK!!!    Hope you can stay
&gt;longer.   :-)

summing up my adventures!  i will be here for along time, although, i do
