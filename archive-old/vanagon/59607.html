Count me in too.   Can you convert Canadian funny money down there?
Otherwise, will drop some greenbacks in the mail.

&gt;&gt; &gt;Hi Gang,
&gt;&gt; &gt;I've been running the Vanagon_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu mailing list for over 3
years
&gt;&gt; &gt;now.  It's been great, but frankly, I'm very tired of it and would like to
&gt;&gt; &gt;stop.
&gt;&gt; &gt;I'm looking for someone to take over the list.  All of it. Ron Lussier was
&gt;&gt; &gt;interested in hosting it at his site, but backed out for reasons of
network
&gt;&gt; &gt;resources and $$.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I just want to mention that I'm willing to run the list, but I'd need to
&gt;&gt; purchase a machine and software (LISTSERV) to host the list, which would
&gt;&gt; cost approximately $1500.00.  Bandwidth is not a problem... my site has
a T1.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; If folks on the list are willing to pony up an average of $3 apiece for a
&gt;&gt; host machine and the LISTSERV software license, I'll run the list.
