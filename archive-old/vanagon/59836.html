Dan, thanks for the offer, I have looked at the sample Domino site and it
seems to offer quite a lot plus there seems to be links to other &quot;areas&quot; of
interest e.g. could incorporate a hyperlink to the Archives.

I must admit that I like the informality of the list as it now is and would
be willing to fork out some cash to keep it running but I can also see some
of the benefits of using a web site.

I am torn between the two, if the web site can be as easily accessed by all
currently on the list and &quot;managed&quot; to the same or better degree as the
list is at present then I for one express a preference for your idea.

However I accept that I am fairly new to the list and others may have
different ideas based on experience.

Once again subject open to discussion.

Gerry, thanks for running the list and giving up  your time to help us
explore the wonderful world of VW's.

&gt; 
&gt; All,
&gt; I have been thinking about taking over the list for some time now.  I
&gt; would
&gt; need your feed back on some of my ideas.  I propose taking all existing
&gt; threads
&gt; and importing them into a Lotus Notes Discussion database that can be
&gt; categorized by what ever topics we all choose, full text searched,
&gt; seperate
&gt; views for soliciations etc.  (Look at
&gt; http://domino.lotus_dot_com/area/discuss for a sample)
&gt; 
&gt; The information in the list is valuable and needs to placed into a
&gt; repository
&gt; that can be easily searched and added to.  In a sense the list would
&gt; nolonger
&gt; be a listserv but become a web site.
&gt; 
&gt; I have a site availble to me.  I would try do this free of charge to the
&gt; list
&gt; members but would also try to solicite funds from vendors.  My goal is
&gt; not to plaster
&gt; all pages with adds, but provide an area where vendors can post
&gt; information and
&gt; obviously get funds to support the site.
&gt; 
&gt; My MAIN concern is the information, I own a vanagon and have used the
&gt; list
&gt; and skip's repository countless times.
&gt; 
&gt; Please give me your feedback.
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Dan
