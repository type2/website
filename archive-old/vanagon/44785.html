Ellis,
To quote Scotty from Star Trek &quot;Fool me once, shame on you.  Fool me twice,
shame on me.&quot;  After the 2 week deadline and after the unreturned calls you
should've been on to this idiot.  I can empathize with you but, by the time
you felt the need to leave snide messages for him, it was time to get your
parts back and find another painter.  How good a paint job could he do that
would be worth all this hassle?   Go elsewhere with your money.

James



&gt;the Classic(two weeks ago this Friday!!!) went unreturned.  Each call to the
&gt;guy was professional and c ontained both the office and home numbers. He
&gt;knows me well enough to know that he can call anytime. Today I finally left
&gt;a frustrated message in which I basically implored the guy to wake up, be
&gt;professional, and at least return my (freakin) call. The call was returned
&gt;by his girlfriend/SO just moments ago. She was livid that I would leave a
&gt;&quot;rude&quot; message and basically stated several assumed aspects of working with
&gt;her boy friend....
