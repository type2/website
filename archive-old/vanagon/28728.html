&gt; Hi All.  My '90 has a black plastic bag that is designed to fit over

I've seen covers like this (plastic or vynal or such) on show cars, and 
in those cases it was strictly cosmetic I'm sure.  Unless it in someway 
keeps the plug leads separated specially or prevents them from twisting 
around on the dist. which would perhaps allow gunk under the electrodes 
I can't imagine that yours is serving more purpose than just being nice 
to look at.  
You can always try driving around without it...

I'd put a bit of dielectric grease on your dist electrodes (I put it 
everywhere, but I'm a bit excessive) and drive around.  If after driving 
in the rain, you notice water in the dist., then buy a new plastic bag, 
otherwise, you're okay without.
