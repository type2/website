Subject: She runs!


She runs! She runs well! Our brick moves down the road 
again! This was a nice part of Labor Day weekend, although 
our best friends thought we were nuts for going home to put 
the new (used) flex plate on the van. The whole weekend 
rates a 10! We started out on Friday, went to see a youn 
friend of ours start as a QB for the first time at 
Pymatuning Valley High. And PV won! Stayed up late, went 
back to our best friends house, Steve and Theresa, stayed up
even later, and then went to bed having partied enough. Got 
up at 8am to get ready to go to the Rock and Roll Hall of 
Fame and Museum. You all have to put this place on your list
of things to see on your travels. It is GREAT! we spent
2 1/2 hours in it, and will go back again this winter when 
the crowds thin out some. The Museum is terrific. Afterwards
we walked over to Tower City, the large mall in downtown 
Cleveland. A very cool place. Checked out the Disney Store 
and the Warner Brothers Store, my two favorie places. And 
spent some time listening to The Beatle Brothers band. Close
your eyes and you would think the Fab Four was right there. 
Bu it did take six of them to do it. Walked across Public 
Square to John Q's resturant, and as we were getting to the 
corner it is on, the other couple we were meeting walked up.
Perfect timing. Boy, we were all on the right page. After 
dinner, it was off to Cleveland Staddium and The Concert for
the Rock and Roll Hall fo Fame. WOW! Seven hours of great 
rock. It was amazing. Back to Steve and Theresa's after the 
show. Sunday-woke up, watched the first half of the Browns 
game, and went home to fix the bus. And at 10pm, she fired 
up. So we hopped in and drove to Lake Pymatuning on the PA 
state line for some fishing and picnicing on Monday. Wow, 
what a great weekend!
