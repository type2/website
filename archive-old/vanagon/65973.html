Subject:      bentley manual fs

alas - i have sold my van and will no longer be needing my bentley.  it
is in pretty good shape, the cover is clean and intact, and few pages
have greasy fingerprints.  if anyone is interested, i was thinking $45
ppd(cod) would be fair.

matthew

ps - i can only check my mail once a week - so please be patient - i
will respond.
