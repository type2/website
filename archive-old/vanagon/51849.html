&gt;The stupidity of that line of thinking should force all 'free thinking' 
&gt;beings (or plainly - any being that thinks at all) to boycott Wal-Mart.

&gt;
&gt;Due to Wal-Mart's new sensoship policy they will no longer be offering
&gt;cupholders that have ties to VW campers. A company spokesperson says VW
&gt;OEM style cupholders reflect on the past days in which VW campers
&gt;symbalized drug use and free thinking. Everyone will have to go to
&gt;K-mart.

I think Erik was joking, but his jest was based on a real event.  WalMart
pulled sweatshirts from their shelves after deciding that the shirts were
detrimental to &quot;family values.&quot;

The design?  Margaret (from Dennis the Mennis) saying &quot;I believe one day a
woman will be president!&quot;

The Right makes me sick.
