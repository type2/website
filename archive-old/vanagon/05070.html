So JOHNH_at_NORWICH.BITNET says:
&gt; 
&gt; we got the battery charged up on the way home.  the light was out. does this
&gt; mean that the generator is working again, or does it simply mean that the
&gt; battery is charged, and the light will come back on as the battery dies again?

I'd say it means a diode in the voltage regulator is getting the right amout
of voltage again so your dash light goes out.  

First, I'd check all of the wiring to make sure its not too old or corroded to
do it's job.  Especially the battery cables.  Make sure there in good order and
that the connection to the body is nice and shiney so that there's a good contact
to the body.  Same goes for the positive cable.  

&gt; 
&gt; how much can i expect to pay for a new generator?  does the cost difference of
&gt; having the current generator overhauled justify having the bus tied up as long
&gt; as it most likely will be? or should we just buy a new one?

If you suspect the generator, I'd take it out and have it tested at a shop so
they can tell you whether or not to spend the money for a new or rebuilt one.

Don't throw the towel in so soon.  There's lot's of adventures to be had with
a VW bus.  ;)
