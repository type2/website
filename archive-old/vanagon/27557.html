&gt;&gt; five speeds (sometimes)  Syncros have 094-4WD.
&gt;&gt; ^^^^^^^^^^^
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Anybody know if it is possible to put one of these five-speeds, in
&gt;&gt; an '81 Vanagon, to mate with the original '81 Vanagon gas engine?


&gt;I doubt I'll ever run across one.  I will conjecture to the conversion



and for all those inquiring minds...

Available at my local VW dealer, 1983 Diesel 5speed 7 seater Vanagon
