Subject: Can Holders... Help (U)

     Being a purist, I want to install the NOS ($5) flip holders in the 
     precise, original location in the 84 Westy. Would someone with 
     original equipment please measure the location/coordinates of theirs 
     and post. Also screw size and type (2 each I think). Where the 
     originals ($33.80) all black?
     
     84 Westy (Wally)
