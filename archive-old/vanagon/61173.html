Subject: Re: Faucet Fun, etc. . .

     First- copious thanks to all who made suggestions and shared their own 
     experience (my sink runneth over - see below).
     
     Second- I fixed the faucet pump problem (at least temporarily).  Turns 
     out the impeller had come disconnected from the shaft (I could tell it 
     was flopping around in the housing).
     
     Reasoning that I could do it little further harm, I got a hold of the 
     bottom of the housing with a pair of channel lock pliers, and popped 
     it off.  The hole in the impeller (where it fits on the shaft) looked 
     melted - did it jam?  Was it run dry, heated up, and the plastic and 
     metal separated?
     
     Well, I cleaned up the enlarged hole, with a drill bit held by hand, 
     all the while trying to keep it centered.  I inserted a piece of 
     Evergreen brand styrene tube (I &quot;play&quot; with trains and usually have a 
     lot of goodies around), glued it in place with Testor's liquid cement, 
     cut off the excess, and reinstalled it on the shaft.
     
     Once I got the impeller positioned on the shaft at the correct depth, 
     I placed the housing back on the pump and flowed more Testor's cement 
     around the joint.  Let it set up for a few minutes, tested and 
     reinstalled the pump.  Water almost immediately.
     
     Third - On to the Fridge!  Two questions before I start:
     
     1. Does the &quot;don't level - do damage&quot; relationship apply to all three 
     modes, or just to gas?
     
     2. Are the clip on temp sensors mentioned in Derek Drew's 
     &quot;Refrigerator Madness&quot; posting from 1994 still available from Radio 
     Shack?  Anyone have a part number?
     
     Again, forgive me for the more obvious questions - the PO didn't have 
     the Vanagon or the Westfalia manuals - I hope they show up at the 
     dealer's soon!  (Probably just after I figure everything out on my 
     own.
