Subject: Some basic questions

I have a few basic questions to ask:
1.  Will the transmission from a '73 fit into a '77 without &quot;much&quot; 
	modification?
2.  Will your run of the mill spray paint work to paint the engine tin or
	is high temp paint needed?
3.  What oil is recommended for my '77 westy?  I live in western NY.
4.  What does FLAPS stand for?
thanks for your time,
Brett
