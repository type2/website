Subject: curtains


Someone asked about curtain holders/rods/fasteners, etc.  I believe
that one can reorder these new from places like the dealer, but 
probably at considerable expense.  I went to the local hardware
store and bought some old-fashioned TV antennae wire - you know,
the brown, flat plastic stuff, about, say, 3/8&quot; wide, that has
the two wires (encased in the plastic) along each side.  This
replaced the aluminum strip I was missing on the rear hatch,
but I also think it would work to replace the 6&quot; or so strap
one uses to bundle the curtain to store while driving.
