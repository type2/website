As seen in Sunday's Baltimore Sun:

'91 Burgundy Vanagon  7 seater $12,995.
-I went and looked at this one.  It is *very* nice.
65K on the odometer.  Looking underneath at the engine, it was
very clean and dry and the exhaust system was new.

'93 White Eurovan  7 Seater $14,995.
-I glanced at this one, but didn't get the mileage.

These 2 are at a used car lot-410/628-2277

brakes, etc  No dents or Rust  $2900  410/761-2015

'89 VW Carat Vanagon  Water Cooled, AC 410/667-3423
-This one is real close by, I could take a look.

'78 VW Camper Bus  needs piston seals, manifold  $2500  410/235-4533
-I called on this one, and it sounds like a lot of work is needed
