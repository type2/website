Subject: FS: my beloved 90 Westy

Yes, I am reluctantly putting my beloved 90 Westfalia up for sale.  I
recently
found out that my dean is moving my job to Charlottesville, VA effective
July 1
and I _really_ don't want to go.  So I'm going to sell a few &quot;toys&quot; and
try my luck at starting my own business.
        
Here's the scoop if you're interested:  white 90 Westfalia camper with
AC, power
windows, power locks, cruise, alloys, 4 speed, 97,000 miles, canvas in
great shape, grey interior that is super clean; sink, stove &amp; fridge all
work great.  I'm the second owner.

I would rate it in &quot;excellent&quot; condition, except for a small golf-ball
sized dent under the right rear bumper that the PO put in it.  I just
checked Kelly Blue Book OnLine
(http://www.kbb_dot_com) and they say its worth $17645 retail
(right?!?!...where did they get THAT figure???)...I say its worth more
like $12,500.  I have a killer stereo in it that I just put in it in
December (Pioneer Deck, Boston Acoustic Speakers, Bazooka Subwoofer,
Pioneer 12 disk CD changer).  I'm not including that in the price, so if
you'd want the stereo with the van, we'd have to work out a deal for it
(I still have the factory original).
        If you're interested, drop me a line by e-mail, the phone number
below,
or at home (usually after 8 at night) 540-343-3829.

Ian
