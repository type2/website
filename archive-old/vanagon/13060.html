&gt;it would bump into the frame crossmember.  So my question (there
&gt;had to be one here somewhere) is: can I just remove the transmission
&gt;mount and let the whole thing down the necessary 2 inches without
&gt;detaching the transmission from the engine?  Would it be sufficient
&gt;to loosen the rear motor mounts to provide enough hinge effect?
&gt;Would lowering the tranny 2&quot; in place break or bend the shift linkage?

i would most definitely disconnect the shift linkage!!

&gt;If this apparently-minor job requires pulling the transmission all
&gt;the way out, I think I'll let the shop do it...

after suffering through a clutch slave cylinder replacement on a 4-speed,
i would suggest thinking really strongly about letting the shop do it,
IF they have worked on auto buses before. especially if you are gonna be
doing this without benefit of a lift ... i.e., on your back in the driveway.
it's really hard to get your hands up in the right places from the shadetree
position. :)

cause there is a tech bulletin out about the water-cooled buses, and how
the coolant hoses can be damaged if the tech-mechs are not careful when
removing/lowering the transmission.
