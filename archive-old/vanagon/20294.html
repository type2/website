Hi Derek -

Keep in mind that many (if not all states,) require that the label be affixed
in some manner or it is illegal to fill that tank.

I just had a customer today call to see if he could find a new tank because
the local propane supplier (in Illinois) flatly refuses to fill the tank,
stating it's against state law to fill any propane tank without the label
affixed to the tank.

Out here in California, the label is required, as well as a stamping on the
tank every so often (I think 5 years) that the tank has been checked and
re-certified for use or they won't touch 'em, fill 'em, etc.  I know this
because we regularly have 20 gallon bottles filled for hot tank and other
uses in our shop (We don't have the luxury of natural gas out here in the
sticks in Northern Cal.).

So after tackling the rust problem on your tank, find some way to affix back
on or your outa luck gettin' it filled.
