Just found a Web site that is actually an add for Alldata
Corporation which is an informative database for cars.  Included
was a sample of Service bulletins for all car makes.  I checked
out VW/truck/2wd and it had quite a list of Tech. Service Bulletins.
I wasn't sure if all of them were listed in the Vanagon Archives
so I though I'd post the address so Gerry and others could check it
out.

  The site is at: http://www.alldata.tsb_dot_com/
