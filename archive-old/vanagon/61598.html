Subject: Can't find a 1.9 fuel injection problem?

My 85 Westy is running very rich.  Symptoms are black smoke, poor gas
mileage and lack of power.

The following parts were checked by replacing with a known good part from=
 a
running 85 Vanagon

fuel injectors (mine weep a little, but not serious)
coolant temperature sensor
ECU
Air Flow sensor
Oxygen Sensor

The fuel pressure is OK (30lbs).
Fuel pressure regulator is OK.
Timing &amp; advance is OK.
cylinder pressure is relatively OK (125 psi on 1&amp;3, 150 on 2&amp;4).
I'm not burning water, no white smoke &amp; I don't use fluid.
but I did have a small head leak this past winter, fixed with stop-leak.

I am going to ring out the wiring harness but have done it once already.

Does anyone have any suggestions?  Has anyone seen this problem not cause=
d
by the usual sensors?  It sure seems like its getting too much gas someho=
w.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.
