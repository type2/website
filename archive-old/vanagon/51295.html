Hey all,
I got my '78 Bus's birth certificate today in the form of an air-mail
letter from VW AG.

It says:
Model: 		VW Type 2
Engine No.:     GE 016 277
Color:          not registered
Production date:21.11.77
Delivery Date:  23.11.77
Delivered to:   USA, Jacksonville

Signed by Klaus Chojnacki and Steffi Grundel   

Neat :)

I should go see if the engine number matches :)

Sean
