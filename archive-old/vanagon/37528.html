&gt; On a '78 I know that if you take the intake system off (in my case a

&gt; that the back of the engine can be lowered an inch or two, you can JUST get
&gt; the tank out.

I removed my tank with the engine out and it was a horrible job.  I
can't imagine doing it with the engine in place!  Anyone who tries this
is a brave, brave soul.
