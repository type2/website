&gt;Why don't the police put up a sign on that stretch of highway warning

&gt;a month in this manner, what with all the differences reported each time 
&gt;this urban legend is re-hashed?
Nah, the federal government will just mandate that all new cars have 200mph
bumpers installed, in case the owner happens to install a JATO rocket on
their car.  And in the front of the owners manual they'll add the statement
&quot;DO NOT install rocket propulsion units to this vehicle.&quot;
