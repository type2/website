yo,

	I took my precious taillights to to chrome shop this afternoon to be
plated.  Hope they don't screw them up!

	Its gonna cost $20 each, and they can do them with the glass installed.
I took them to Buff and Plating works here in Sac, and it'll prolly take
2 weeks for them to get done.  Just enough time to get the bus painted...
