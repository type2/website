Subject: Synthetic oil

Back on 1/22 David Goldberg posted a list on web sites that had some info on
additives like Slick 50 . I looked at two of those today that I thought
included quite good discussion of the merits of synoil.
 One of the assertions was that synoil was 10% more effective at heat
transfer. That reminded me of  the list member who a few weeks earlier said
he had tried and abandoned synoil because his oil temp. increased 10* to
20*(he may not have been that specific).Hence this question: Wouldn't that be
a good thing rather than bad if it means that the oil is &quot;transfering&quot; 10%
more heat(10* -20*) from the interior of the engine to the cooler?
I'll admit upfront that this is strictly an academic exercise for me since I
have very little understanding of things mechanical but do enjoy hearing the
&quot;pros&quot; hash one out.
