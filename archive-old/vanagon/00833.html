Hmmm. I just went to the local Champion Auto Parts store and asked for an 
oxygen sensor for my vehicle.  The price was $29.99 and it was a one-
wire.  The install was incredibly simple.  Having one of those crimping 
tools and a few connectors came in handy, but the remove from the exhaust 
was easy.  

I hope I didn't do wrong by going with a generic oxygen sensor.  I still 
have the old one if I did, and I'm not convinced it was bad.
