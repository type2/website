&gt; &gt; &gt; The difference between pulling an early late engine or a late late
&gt; &gt; &gt; engine is amazing.

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;   Not as amazing as the difference observed between them when driving!
&gt; &gt;   Dave
&gt; 
&gt; But then I guess you have to factor in time spent pulling the engine
&gt; over time driving. From what I hear from the FI guys, that should 
&gt; be about 50%
&gt; [ducking and running]

  Based on my own experience, without correcting for incompetence, all the
  time saved when removing the upright engine is paid back _with interest_
  when trying to remove the _at_!#$#_at_ gland nut. Those little bolts that hold
  the type IV flywheel on are soooo nice.
