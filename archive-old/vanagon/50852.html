Subject: Re: Carat Table Problems

&gt;If the table has the same lock as the one in my MV you have VERY slim
&gt;chance of forcing it open.  The latch is like a one-way clicker.  I.e. 
&gt;push and release to open, push and release to latch shut.  I had to keep
&gt;trying for two months to get my table loose.  I haven't let it latch back
&gt;since.  It looks like it may only need some lubrication to work correctly. 
&gt;But there is absolutely no backup method of releasing the table. 


Hmmm... I seem to remember a post about an easy way to get to these things.
Seems you take a three inch hole saw and cut a hole thru the table top directly
above the latch so you can reach thru and change the sender. Whoops! that was
something else.  Friday yet?
