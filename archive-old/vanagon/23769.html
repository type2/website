Subject: Anyone used PartsPlace Inc?

hiya Volke,

has anyone used Partsplace to order parts? my roommate has a catalog and i just
ordered some parts that i desperately need to get on the road. i'm hoping they
have a good reputation..would like to hear what folks have to say about them.
after buying a cvjoint that was RUSTED on the inner case from the local vw shop
here and being told 'that you don't know what you are doing...&quot; and fighting
to get my money back, i'm hoping i won't get ripped again.

thanks,

jonathan
