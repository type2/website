OK, I'm willing to put in a new temperature sensor to try and solve my
Vanagon Driveability Problems. I have the shop manual for my long since
sold 1981 Vanagon, but I don't think it is a good reference for my current
1991 Multivan.

Where is the temperature sensor located?  What does it look like?  Is it
easy to replace?  Does anyone happen to know the part number?

I assume the temperature sensor in question is the one detecting the
temperature of the engine coolant fluid.  Isn't there also an intake air
temperature sensor?

&gt; 
&gt; &lt;&lt;  Someone mentioned replacing the temperature sensor.  &gt;&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; This would have been the cheapest easiest part swap for you.It is
possibly
&gt; shorted or open you can test it w/ an ohm meter but _at_ less than 50 bucks
it
&gt; is a cheap part.
