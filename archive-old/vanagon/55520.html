Subject: Re: Hydraulic Clutch &quot;Adjustment&quot;

If nothing has ever been done to the clutch or any of it's linkages you
probably have some air in the system. Try bleeding it first. If it comes
back start by peeling back the dust boots to find out if the master or the
slave is leaking. Both are know to go bad. HTH

&gt;My clutch has excessive play.  By this I mean that when I step on the
&gt;clutch there is absolutely no resistence for the first 1/4 of the pedal
&gt;stroke.  In Bentley there is a diagram that shows an adjustment to the
&gt;&quot;plunger&quot; length.  Only one problem...the &quot;plunger&quot; is BURIED behind the
&gt;dash.  I can't even see it let alone adjust it!  Anyone played with type
&gt;of thing out there?

&gt;Thanks in Adavnce!
