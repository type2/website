Subject: Made it to California!

Made it to San Francisco from Ottawa in my previously unproven 73 Westy.  I
put 7000 miles on the bus in a month!  Longest day was from Kenora, Ontario
to Saskatoon, Saskatchewan.

So - where's a good place to get parts in San Francisco?  Good Junkyard?
Good mechanic for those pesky chores I don't feel like doing myself?

I was looking through the archive for stuff about engine temperature.  I
have a VDO temperature gauge hooked up to a dipstick sensor.  According to
a posting in the archive the dipstick sensor is measuring the oil
temperature -before- the oil goes through the oil cooler.  The indicated
temperature is normally about 215 around town and on cool days, but on hot
days and going up hills it stabilizes around 250.  Last week however, I was
driving back from Kings Canyon through Fresno.  The ambient temperature was
106 (HOT), and I had to be careful not to drive faster then 60 mph or the
temperature would rapidly start climbing towards the scary 300 mark (I know
this is really hot).  Was I running into the limited cooling capacity of
the stock fan and oil cooler?  I am running 5W50 Synthetic oil.

When is the U.S. going to switch to 75 cent coins like Canada?
