Subject: Dealer response: hatch struts

okay- i couldn't wait for an answer so i called the dealer back.  he said
that VW DOES use two different PNs on the hatch and that the even number
goes on the right.  so, i'll mount the low pressure 251 828 332 on the right
and the high pressure 251 829 331 B on the left.

(and you do the Hokey Pokey as you turn yourself around)
