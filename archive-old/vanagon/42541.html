Subject: '79 Bus FS in RI

    I have a 1979 bus for sale In Rhode Island.  It has been sitting for
 almost 3 years.  The body is in good shape and set up for travel.  It has
 a unique hard shell top that makes the bus 2.5 feet taller and gives lots
 of standing room inside. It comes with two FI parts engines and one in the
 bus that should run with the right exhaust.  It came out of a running
 914.  All the parts are there, plus many extra, all it needs and a
 battery.
