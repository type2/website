Steve,

Here's my guess as to your engines's problems:

Massive clouds of white smoke - 2.) Maybe the power brake servo has a hole,
and the engine is drawing brake fluid all the way down that huge vacuum line
from the front of the bus to the intake manifold?  And burning it
(occasionally) to form those huge white clouds?  [Just as you suggested.]

Bad exhaust valves and/or seats and maybe worn rings.  Have you done a
compression test?  Need top-end overhaul?  Engine rebuild?  All cooling tin
and engine compartment seals in place and in good shape?

A compression test will tell you lots.  The white smoke clouds sure do sound
like the power brake servo membrane - happened to my Mercedes once.

Good luck/have fun.
