Subject: Re: RV Shops, Puget Sound Area?

&gt;I am in the final stages of getting my Thermal Systems propane catalytic
&gt;heater ready to install in my bus, but am in need of an RV shop to do the
&gt;final installation - running and hooking up the propane lines.
&gt;
&gt;Does anyone have a shop to reccommend in the Puget Sound area? Preferably
&gt;it would be someone fairly familiar with Westfalias.
&gt;
&gt;Any help is most appreciated.

I can't help, but am interested in the heater your getting.  How big is it?
All the RV heaters I've looked at were like 16&quot;-20&quot; deep and would stick out
the side like way bad.  I assume you must vent the exhaust outside.  Is that
included in the outside dimension?
