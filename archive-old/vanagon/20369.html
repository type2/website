Subject: Please help me..Waaaa!..Bus don't go

Oh please I need help.

My bus is my only source of (legal) transportation and now it won't go.

To make a very long story short I did a tune-up on my '73 bus (stock type IV
engine and auto tranny).  I replaced the plugs, points, rotor, cap, and
condenser.  I gapped everything correctly, set the timing, and finally got it
running _very_ smoothly.  I decided to take it around the block for a test
drive.  At the exact opposite end of the block it died, just stopped.

Then I saw smoke coming out from the dashboard.  Eventually, I traced this to a
black wire coming out of the ignition switch which (according to the wiring
diagram) ends up at the #11 fuse.  The wire only gets hot when the ignition is
on (the car doesn't have to be running).  All the dash lights work correctly
but I get no starter action.

Just a little while ago I got an idea that it might be the condenser shorting
on something or maybe being defective.  Does this sound likely to anyone?  Any
other things I might look for?

I had to drive my Squareback to work which is uninsured and unregistered right
now, but I may have to put it back on the road if my bus is very ill.  Thank
you very much for your help

Erik.
