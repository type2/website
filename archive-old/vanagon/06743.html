&gt; from the shake-and-bake state will tell me your relative location within
&gt; california (north or south), i'll make the changes. but you are gonna have
&gt; to tell me ... cause i don't know where all those suburbs are and i don't
&gt; have a map here at work. :)  i know where san fran and san diego and l.a.

oh good , this reminds me of when .......

{ long winded explination and story volountarily ommited }

......  and that's why the state should be considered 4 regions for the 
list stats, south, mid-valley, north, north coast.

but since it's not likely that it will be 4 regions, 2 is beeter than one.

i would be in the NORTH region in either case, being here in the bay area.
