&gt; I knew I was hard core when I
&gt; noticed a really clean looking '68 camper in the background, located at the
&gt; house of doom, with stock curtains in it! Yowll I wonder if theyll sell it
&gt; for quick lawyer money. These dudes aint camping anytime soon. Maybe they
&gt; were planning a roadtrip to Montana. Naw, too many projects already...

I also saw a clip of another of the group's houses [I think], with 
a really straight tan splitty in the driveway.
