Subject: won't start

Phil,

My 2 cents:  sounds like it's either a vacuum leak/old vacuum lines; or
perhaps fuel vaporization.  With the latter, fuel lines get too close to
a hot engine, the fuel vaporizes, and the FI/Carb &quot;can't find&quot; fuel to
squirt.

I have a 1985 Vanagon GL that will start when it cold or has been
sitting for a while. If, however, I pop into a store and come out in a
few minutes, the starter motor turns and turns but it won't start. I can
smell gas so I suspect some kind of 'flooding'. Keeping the pedal to the
floorboard doesn't help, either. I find I have to wait for half an hour
before I can finally get it started.
