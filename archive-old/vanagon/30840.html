     &gt;uh, hate to pop your bubble, Lee,  but they didn't make single cabs 
     &gt;in 1950. and they didn't have rear bumpers then.  are you sure you 
     &gt;have '50 taillights?  What do they look like?
     &gt;If i sound anal, it's because i know what it's like to try to find 
     &gt;this ...
     
     what you mean you've never seen a '50 pickup DeLuxe ??!!  ;-)
     
     yep, I'm even gonna put deluxe strips on it, &lt;cringe&gt;
     
     no really, it's lucky I found it because there is literally only a 
     chassis left.
     
     no sills (I mean nothing)
     no outriggers
     no floors (inner or outer)
     no windows
     not much else either. 
     
     and I'm getting it for free (well I wouldn't pay for such a heap)
     
     Lee.
