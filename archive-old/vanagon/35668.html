&gt;When I tore down my 1700cc heads one of the valves was burnt, but all 
&gt;of the seats looked in good condition.  I ordered all new 
&gt;valves(intake and exhaust), but I am using the old guides.  Should I 
&gt;lap the valves? Tom Willson says no, but I don't see why.

Are guides worn or not?  Iwould replace unless pristine.  Seats should be cut
or lapped. Before installing heads, check valves for leakage with brake
clean,(turn upside down, with spark plugs in plcae, fill cavity).  After
assembly, air test engine to ensure no valve or head leakage.
