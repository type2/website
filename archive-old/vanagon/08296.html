Well, it's Friday (though for DC and me it felt like Friday last Monday!),
and I think Michael H. is leading us on to our contest du jour:

YMMV   your mileage may vary
FLAPS  friendly local auto parts store
FLAG   friendly local auto garage
FLATS  friendly local auto tire store
OE(M)  original equipment (manufacture(r))
EOL    end of life

OK, guys and gals, these are just some of the acronyms I've seen the past
couple weeks, so what say we bring everyone up to speed on the List's
favorite acronyms, eh?  C'mon...I know you're out there, let's bring 'em!..

Norman&quot;wait, I'm still trying to think of a witty anti-acronym for my name&quot;
nleong_at_synoptics_dot_com

ps-'sorry if all this stuff is already going on, but we in digestville
are like mushroom...
