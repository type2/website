Subject: gas leakage?

Last night I came out to my bus and found quite a gas smell inside..
Went around to the fill cap, and there was gas sitting in the little
space below the cap, and it looks like a little maybe spilled into the
engine compartment.  Seems I'd pared on a slight sidehill (nothing
big, just the slant of the street) with a full tank, and the gas had
gone right up the fuel fill line and leaked a little...  

How might I fix this problem?  Is it do-able without pulling out the
gas tank?  You could just say &quot;well, don't park on a sidehill&quot; or
&quot;well, don't fill the tank so full,&quot; but I was hoping for something
that would actually _solve_ the issue...

Thanks.
