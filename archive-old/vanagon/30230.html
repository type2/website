Hey all,
	I've been seeing on this list that the Bentley books for the VW
	Vanagons and Westys (1980 and up) are around $70.  Are the
	Bentley books for the older buses, like the '68-'79 book, that
	expensive?  Seems like a lot for that book, but I guess if you
	need one you need one.  

	Hopin' older is cheaper,
	Sean
