Well my brother is a salesman at a Dodge dealership in Rockland County NY   
and he was telling me that Chrysler was the first one to come up with   
this incredible and innovative feature a couple of years ago:
Front/Rear heating and A/C.

Well I could not resist so, with my 85 parked infront of the show window   
I told them so did mine.  The salespeople had this look on their faces.   
 They then spent the next 20 minutes talking about all the memories of   
their VWs when in their younger years.  It was cool!

I hear that Chrysler is going to invent the flat engine and are going to   
be the first to use air cooled engines!  Glad Chrysler is around!
