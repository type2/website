Subject: Brake Cylinder Rebuilding??

Hi all,
I've recently replaced (with new) both the rear wheel cylinders on our 88
Vanagon - one was leaking.  Also, recently I had the clutch slave cylinder
replaced on my 87 Syncro.  

I'd like to rebuild the old cylinders and keep them as spares.  The bore of
all of the cylinders is very smooth and shows no signs of pitting.  It seems
like the leaks were like caused by old and stiff rubber seals.  The seals in
the rebuild kits are much more flexible and the outer sealing &quot;skirt&quot; is a
bit larger in diameter than the old ones.  I theorize that the seals, after
being held inside the cylinders for 9-10 years, have assumed the diameter of
the cylinders and no longer exert much force on the walls on the cylinder
wall.

My question is about honing the cylinders.  Since they are smooth inside,
does this realy need to be done?  I'm a bit worried about taking a cylinder
with a nice smooth bore and screwing it up with a hone.  Also, any
suggestions on the brand or type of hone required?

Thanks,
Jim Davis
