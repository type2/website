Subject: Re: Idiot factor (was: Not overheating -SMAHER)

First thing I did to current bus was remove and repack CV joint because 
of excessive heating of rear wheel. Took about a week of stealing spare 
time from school and family (including getting the CV joint locked up). 
When all was said and done, the excessive heating was caused by a stuck 
emergency brake cable. (I was too embarassed to tell the list, so this is 
almost like a confession.) 8) Joe
