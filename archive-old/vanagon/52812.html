Subject: Windshield rain water leak?
Date: Sat, 7 Dec 1996 18:16:03 +0000

   My '84 vanagon GL drips water from the inside body behind/below the fuse
block to the carpet left of the driver's left foot. I assume this is leaking
from the windshield, not the wiper or antenna mount? The PO mentioned
repairing extensive front end damage. 

   Would removing the portion of the dash over the instruments reveal a
better look than what little I can see from below/under the dash?

   Is there a windshield sealent that might fix this?

Thanks,
