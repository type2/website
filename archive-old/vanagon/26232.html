Subject: A toast to Bob &amp; Grendel

All,

Since it is appearent that Bob is going to be departing in a day or so
(if all goes well), I propose, partly to Bob, and mostly to the rest of
us mere mortals, that say 10 - 15 minutes before Bob fires up Grendel
for the trek into warmer (drier?) climes he should send out a message to
the list saying something to the effect of &quot;10 minutes and counting&quot; and
give the local time.  We all then get a glass of Beer,Wine,Cola,
whatever your poison, and when 10 minutes, or whatever interval
(probably should be closer to 15 or more), elapses we all hold up our
glasses and say &quot;Good Luck Bob &amp; Grendel&quot; (if someone could translate
that into german it would be all the better).  With the sudden
outpouring of good VW karma, a new sense of being should flow into her
and be more than enough to carry her and Bob through the trials and
tribulations of the trip home.

Just a thought
