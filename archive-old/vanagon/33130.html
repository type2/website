Subject: Re: Cheap struts for Vgon rear hatch

On Fri, 8 Dec 1995, Maher, Steve (SD-MS) wrote about a cheap pair of rear 
struts for the Vanagon.

I was looking at the rear hatch of a friends old Volvo station wagon the 
other day and noticed that the left 'strut' was simply a tube within a 
tube combined with a simple mechanical latch/lock.  The right side had a 
regular gas? strut.  This seems like the way to go to avoid replacing 
them once a year.

I doubt if the volvo mechanical strut will fit, but I'll check.  If not 
it should be possible to fabricate one - possibly using an old worn out 
strut.

'80 Vanagon, struts still work
