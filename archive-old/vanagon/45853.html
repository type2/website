Subject: Trip Report:Out of Austin, into the frying pan...

Hey now,
     On we roll. I write this on highway 84, north of Lubbock, while Sam mans
(or womans) the wheel. It's been a hard couple of weeks, lots to do to get
ready for a 6 week road trip, and it's nice to be on our way. 
     Texas is big. I mean really big. I mean so vast that you can drive for
hours and still be there(apologies to Douglas Adams). We left Austin at 1am,
it is now 11 and I have new respect for anyone crazy enough to be a trucker
in Texas. What an incredibally boring job. 
     Even with all of our preparations, all has not been easy. The bus has
had a propensity for running hot, and I was doodleing with the mixture all
night, and around Roscoe (pop. 1400) it was running real bad. Pulled over,
checked the dwell, it was about 90. Not good. So we parked at Dairy Queen,
Sam and Indra ate while I replaced the points, condenser, rotor and dist.
cap. The cap was really toasted, which makes me wonder at the effectiveness
of my new electronic ignition. I'll be checking it at our next stop. Roscoe
was interesting, everyone drove American cars and trucks, and looked like the
arch-typical americans, baseball hats and all. I guess they were a little
amused by the hippie bus with all the tools strewn about...   ;-)
     Once we're out of Texas and get to Clovis NM I'll get to see my new
neice-kinda wierd to be an Uncle. And my sis is younger than me!! Wierd. I
guess that's it for now, more to come...
