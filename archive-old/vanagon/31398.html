Subject: HELP!

Due to a computer crash a couple of months ago, I lost the instrucions
on shutting off the list for a while.  I am going to be away from my
PC for about 10 days, and really don't want to come back to about
10,000 messages.

Can anyone PLEASE give me the instructions on how to leave the list
for a while.

Thanks much.

Royal
