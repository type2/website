Subject: BUG-OUT &amp; FREE BURGERS!!


All right East coasters, here's the deal. Show up at Bug-out on Sunday, May
28th and have a burger on me.

Place: Old Dominion Speedway, Route 234,Manassas VA. Gates are supposed to
open at 9 AM, but they actually let people in earlier. I'll get there by 8:30.
For those who have a map, the speedway is located right where the Prince
William County line crosses 234.Easy access from either I-66 or I-95. If you
are on I-95, head west at 234. If you are on I-66, head east. Word of caution
if you come from I-66 through Manassas---The cops run radar every year. When
the sign on that big,wide 4-lane road says 25 mph, GO 25MPH!!!

Back to the burgers:
Look for me in the show area. I will be showing my cracked windshield,faded
red, lowered, Porsche alloyed 65 Notchback. MD tags 65NOTCH. Look for grill
and possibly umbrella. Watch your step, there may be many empties strewn
about. Me and my friends usually eat around 11:00. Feel free to stop by and
identify yourself as Lenti-listmember. Eat a burger, enjoy general good vibes.
Secret handshake optional.BYOB, also.

Just for the logistics, how many of you guys plan on showing up? How many cows
should I buy? Chris Chubb--Do you have a list of possible attendees?

E-mails or phone calls appreciated.


PS. If you come by and don't see the car around 1pm, look on the track. I
might do the slalom again this year.
