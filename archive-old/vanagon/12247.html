Subject: Re: Cracked expansion tank

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;I replaced the tank several years ago for the same problem. Of 
&gt;&gt;&gt;course, it was pretty expensive for a plastic bottle.  
&gt;&gt;

How much does it cost? Mine cracked about a year or two ago. I forgot how
much I paid for the tank. I think it was something around 50 bucks. It
came with a cap which alone could be 15-20 bucks itself. It did not come
with an o-ring for the coolant sensor. The old o-ring does not seal properly
any more. I think my vee dub dealer owes me one.
