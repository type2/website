If the repair was performed under warranty at a VW dealer the warranty
system should still have the information. It doesn't have to be the dealer
it was done at, any dealer can do a warranty history search on and VW. If
it wasn't done under warranty you'll have to find out where it was done and
get the info from them.

&gt;Is there some way I can find out when/at what mileage it was rebuilt, so I
know
&gt;how many miles I've got on my engine?
&gt;Any advice appreciated...
