Saw this about a week ago, they wanted $2800 now they're down to $2400.	

'61 Double-door Panel Conversion

Since I don't know a whole lot about early busses I couldn't tell you how 
its been converted except it has seats and cabinets in the back and some 
windows that don't look OEM.

A quick walk around shows all chrome, lights and lenses present except 
one wiper arm. Painted in last 5-10 yrs some very light surface rust 
around the edges. Since I've seen it around town several times, I assume 
its at least marginally functional

If anyone is interested I'll give you the phone # and try to answer any 
questions. I want it but no $$$ and no space prevent that plan.
