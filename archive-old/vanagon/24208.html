Subject: Carb problems (34 PICT 3)

Soo, My 71 wouldn't start the other day, and I figured out that the carb was 
filled up with loads of little flakes, like rust.  I still can't figure out 
how it got past the filter.  Anyhow, I got the carb cleaned, and reinstalled 
it.  Now, it drools gas from the throttle shaft, on the side with the cable. 
 This isn't good.  It also has a hard time starting, you have to floor the 
pedal to get it started.  I'm almost sure that this is due to a real rich 
mixture, as all that gas is just sitting there.  Anyone got any ideas?  Take 
it apart again?  I dunno.  I guess I'll clean the other one and swap it out. 
 Thanks all.
