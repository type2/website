&gt;Anybody out there run Techron regularly through their Digifant or Digijet FI?
&gt;Wow - I'm really sold. I never thought I'd feel actual *gratitude* towards an
&gt;oil company, but man, if they could bottle that stuff...oh yeah, they already
&gt;do, at eleven bucks a pop.  Well, I feel only slightly less grateful; it was
&gt;$11 well spent.  Anybody else use this stuff?

yeah, i've used it several times ... to soothe my paranoia. :)
but it never helped The Problem (in my case). down here, it's $6 a bottle, for
the size that &quot;conditions&quot; up to 12 gallons ... never seen the &quot;big&quot; bottle.
a company named Imparts also sells it via mail/UPS for about $5 a bottle.

be aware that you NEED to change your oil after two bottles of this stuff ...
it supposedly dilutes the oil pretty badly ... so Steve, i think you need an
oil change right away, what with the STP AND the Techron. :)
