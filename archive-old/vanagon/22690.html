Subject: Re: Tires

&gt;  I've been ponying up the bucks for the reinforced Michelins &lt;$90 each, last 
&gt;  time!&gt; but plan on buying the LT195/75-R14s that Costco sells for $50 or so
&gt;  next time. The LT195/75 have almost the same overall diameter as the 185/80s
&gt;  do, they are rated to inflation pressures of 50 psi, have the correct 
&gt;  load range, and have a M&amp;S &lt;that's M&amp;S, NOT S&amp;M&gt; tread pattern which I'd
&gt;  like for off-pavement and winter use.

For a data point, I've had these tires (Uniroyal Laredo LT195/75 M&amp;S from 
Costco) on my '82 Westy for about 20k miles now. I highly recommend 
them.._dot_decent handling, fairly quiet, and seem to be wearing well. Size is 
perfect, as the speedo is still dead-nuts accurate.
