Subject: Re: wind noise in vans


When I moved up from my '67 bus to a '76 and got a crank-down
window, I thought it was great.  But I sure didn't like the
wind swirling around on the back of my head.  Those old
sliding front windows looked better.

I played around and ended up with a triangular piece of clear
plexiglass mounted on little studs (maybe 1/4&quot;) in the upper,
back corner of the front windows.  That was where the turbulence
originated.  They were maybe 10&quot;h and 12&quot;w on the right-angle
sides.  Worked great.  Didn't interfere with resting your
arm on the open window sill.

When I got the '81 Vanagon, I checked out the idea (since there
was still the turbulence on the highway) but it seemed more
general and I never did anything--other than open the back
window a couple inches--which calms it down.
