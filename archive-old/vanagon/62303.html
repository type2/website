Subject: Re: gauges for a Vanagon

Concerning the Oil Pressure gauges;

0 - 80 # is used on all air cooled and waterboxer motors.
0 - 150 # is for the &quot;Rabbit type&quot; motors as they run incredible oil
pressure. Most people not familliar with them won't believe they run
that high, but they do on startup.  Leads to a few unique concerns such
as needing quality oil filters.
