Subject:      plastic tubs for storage

There was a thread about keeping stuff out of sight in the van so as
not to attract the smash and grab crowd.  Wendy Silva gave me a good
idea that I'm not sure made it onto the list.

We picked up some Rubbermaid 18 gallon containers with lids at
WalMart for about $6 each.  They're just the right size to go in the
back (we got 2, but 3 would fit side-by-side in the GL) and will
accept lots of stuff picked up at the store.  Also, Wendy mentioned
that she puts all her clothes and other travel frabbitz (great
word!) in there and then stack them outside the van when camped.
Being paranoid, I think we'll put them in the front seats when the
Weekender bed is unfolded.

Sorry if this is old news.
