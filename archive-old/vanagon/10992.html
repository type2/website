Martha Rubin askes:
&gt; John et al - many of us in the Bay Area prefer the Morro Bay option,
&gt; since it's a lot closer, but the southern CA site was selected
&gt; out of the possibility that people from AZ and NM would also attend.
&gt; Can we PLEEEEEZE hear from those people - whether they would
&gt; come to Red Rock?

Well...as I told Martha off-line, the difficulty in going to Red Rock
is that it's quite a ways to go for just a weeking (8 hours both ways).
And I'm trying to save up vacation time so that I can do some of the
No. Amer. tour.  As it stands, I'll be lucky to even get 2 weeks to
do that and I would not like to go with less time than that.  Remember,
you have to turn around and go home to.  That's time tacked on to the
trip as well.  Soooo, I cannot see taking that long of a trip for a
week end only.

Sorry,

Steven
