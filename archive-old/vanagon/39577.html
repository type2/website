Subject: NW Camping at Fort Flagler this Weekend

Hello Folks,
	A neighbor of mine just got an 88 Westy, so to break it in we are
going to take it and our '81 Westy camping to Fort Flagler.  Rick Gordan
has mention this site in earlier posts about a NW camping trip.  I have a
list sticker on my rear hatch of my egg nog colored van.  If you feel like
a spur of the moment camping trip come on by. We will be there Friday
night and Saturday night.  Yes we are expecting rain, but there is a
chance of sun breaks, sound like spring on the Puget Sound.

	Hope to see you there.
	johnny Stutsman
