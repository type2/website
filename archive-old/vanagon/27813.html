Subject: Re: Westy Resto from... Update

I know just how you feel jim..  when I got my bug painted not too long 
ago, the unemployed private painter would change schedules on me 
constantly... and not only that, to keep work progressing I was required 
to help quite a bit.  All the sanding, all the taping with him, prep, 
everything I had to be there for.  A one weekend job, I promise, he says 
in his thick chilian accent was turned into a four week horror show.  
Often I had to call him up and wake him because he would go over to his 
girlfriends house, get drunk, have sex, and forget that we had an 
appointment at 7am to do some chore.  The only good thing to come out of 
it is I know how to paint a car, got a good job for the $500 plus $300 
for paint, and will try to do it myself next time.  Never trust anybody.
