&gt; &gt;It's snowing pretty hard outside (For WA, that's not very hard.) and
&gt; &gt;I was just wondering how well my `66 camper will handle in the snow.
&gt; &gt;(Without chains, with reasonably good `pizza cutters' on.)
&gt; 
&gt; well ... i made it around chicago one winter in my 71 bus with 'normal' tires
&gt; on it.  i do NOT recommend it, but it can be done. you just have to be very
&gt; very very careful about the other cars (who are NOT being very careful!) and
&gt; pay close attention to the condition of the roads and parking lots. :)
&gt; 
&gt; might be a good idea to get some extra rims from a junkyard and put a set of
&gt; snow tires on the back. ;)  but the weight distribution of the bus helps a
&gt; lot in snow ... until you have to panic-stop.
&gt; 
&gt; oh yeah. chicago is FLAT. so if your environs are bumpy and/or hilly, these
&gt; words may not be worth the paper they're printed on. ;)

Well here in the deep South, nobody, but nobody, even owns snow tires or
chains. Of course on the one hand I'm talking about the South of Canada (and
one mile from Detroit, or Dee-troit, so we do get snow), but on the other hand
it's flatter here than anywhere in Holland. Hills make all the difference.

I had a lot more difficulty in Chapel Hill (hellish freezing rain) than I've
had here in 24 years.
