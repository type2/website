Subject: UK Slough Swapmeet update

     Hi all,
     
     Just thought I'd tell you about Slough last Sunday - and what I 
     bought.
     
     It's the first time I've been to the Slough meeting. We set off
     at 06:50 in the V6 Caravelle from Manchester and arrived at Slough at 
     about 09:54 (amy guesses at average speed?).
     
     Basically the place was big, hot and packed with lots of stalls.
     
     This is what I bought for my '64 Deluxe bus:
     
     
     Front and back overriders.
     Front overider tube
     One rear overider tube (I still need a drivers side (RHD) rear tube!)
     
     Front Delux bumper trim (short US spec. ones, I need the rear ones)
     Two side pop-out window latches
     Samba sunroof &quot;Golde&quot; locking handle
     Fuse box cover
     One genuine rear lens
     Two wiper arms and blades
     Some stickers (EMPI, Bus Boys etc...)
     Box of genuine cab door/tailgate trim panel clips (stainless ones)
     
     A '68 ball joint front beam ! (to lower and fit discs to my '64)
     
     Total cost:  $$$$!
     
     
     There were quite a few bargains about like a very straight 13-window
     Deluxe for 3000 pounds (no rust, California import).
     
     My mate picked up some US spec lights for his '61 bus for 15 quid! for
     the pair. 
     
     What do they say about rear light for a '60'ish -&gt; '64 bus being rare?
     There were several sets to choose from ranging from 10 quid (used) to 
     70 quid (NOS). Also a boxed, NOS Delux clock (the rectangular one) for 
     200 pounds.
     
     
     Anyone else get any goodies (I saw wings and w-decks being flaunted) ?
     
     Lee.
