&gt;I have a friend that is looking into a '84 Weekender with automatic
&gt;...  The guy is asking $3800.
&gt;Does that sound like a ball park figure?

well ... it sounds a bit high to me, but not THAT much high. i'd feel more
comfortable with it going for about $3000 or $3400. remember that the
weekender doesn't have any stove or sink or refrigerator, just the cabinets
in back.

&gt;What sort of mileage can one expect to get from a wasserboxer engine?

nobody seems to know for sure ... yet. they haven't been around long enough
to see. the fact that it has that many miles on it already might speak well
of the engine's longevity ... if the head gaskets hold out. :)

i think i would suggest getting a compression test AND a leak-down test on
it, just to be on the same side.
