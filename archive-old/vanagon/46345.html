&gt;I appreciate the effort someone else is going to put into an aircooled van 
&gt;list...however, I think that there has ALWAYS been something special on this 
&gt;list which transcends air v water v T1 vT2 v T3 v T4 vans, and I would hate 
&gt;to see this disapear when the split window/loaf/early brick crowd has spun 
&gt;off onto another list....
&gt;
&gt;You said that this is in partial response to those who had problems with the 
&gt;amount of traffic....to those I say (to play on H. Truman)...&quot;If you can't 
&gt;stand the traffic, get off the list&quot;. 
&gt;
&gt;There are much more of us out there, I'm sure, who like the list and how it 
&gt;is run, and who would rather have the list stay the way it has always been 
&gt;handled.
&gt;
&gt;Could you please make the split optional? Besides, think of poor Richard 
&gt;Palmer, he'll have to scrap his stock of V_at_L shirts and have to revert to 
&gt;ones with late Vanagons and EVs only.
&gt;
&gt;PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE DON'T SPLIT THE LIST!!!
&gt;
&gt;I'll buy you extra beer!!!!!!
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;We are loosing our sense of &quot;community&quot; here....
&gt;
