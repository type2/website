Subject: O-Rings for wasserboxers?

To wasserbox owners, past and present,

&gt;I have a question:  Looking at the waterboxer in a junkyard I noticed
&gt;how thin a strip of metal there is as a sealing surface for the heads.
&gt;It's no wonder these things leak so fast!  so *WHY* don't people o-ring
&gt;the cylinders or heads to make them seal better?  It's a common trick
&gt;for hotrodders.  If I had a water-cooled that's the first mod I would
&gt;make to combat the problem.  For those that don't know, &quot;o-ringing&quot; is a
&gt;process where a small groove is cut into the sealing surface and a thin
&gt;metal wire ring is installed in it.  The ring mashes into the head gasket
&gt;giving a lot more clamping force at that point.

My question is, has anybody done this? It does sound like a viable solution.
But does it work over the long run?
