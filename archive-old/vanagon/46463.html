Subject: Re: 69-96 RIP, need advice on burned up engine


&gt;I purchased a 1776 from Strictly Foreign. One of the reasons was because 
&gt;of they had a warranty. Had the engine less than a weak and it caught on 
&gt;fire, my 69 camper is now gone.
&gt;... I recieved a letter saying that the engine warranty was valid only
&gt;if I had a &quot;proffessional&quot; put it in, and they had to sign off, 
&gt;including the 300 mile tune up and the 1000 mile tune up.
&gt;... I put it in, with the greatest of care, lots of hose clamps on fuel 
&gt;lines, etc.

You did not meet up with your part of the agreement to make the warranty 
valid.

&gt;I had been having some oil loss and firued it must be the new steel 
&gt;hoses from Berg I put on for the filter, 

Which they did not sell you or install...

&gt;Insurance didn't cover fire. I don't know what caused the fire. One 
&gt;guess is all the oil I lost and was on the engine? Possible? So what 
&gt;do you think of the engine warranty? Does Stickly Foreign owe anything 
&gt;in this?

If your oil leak was from your valve covers, it would only leak on your 
heat exchangers and would not ignite.  More than likely, the fire was 
due to a fuel line leak, and YOU installed the fuel lines.  I don't 
think you have a leg to stand on.

Sorry  :(
