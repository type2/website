This little U-bracket, pulley, and wire are easy junkyard items. If no junk
yard nearby, check a VW Bug/Bus shop where motors are scattered
hither-thither-and-yon. Many folks who work at this type of shop are in the
&quot;unbelievers club&quot; and will sell this &quot;junk&quot; for a couple of bucks.

BTW:  NEVER place an aux oil cooler anywhere INSIDE the motor compartment,
and in particular, NEVER in front of the cooling fan. Perfect example of
robbing Peter to pay Paul. By placing this anywhere in the cooling air stream
you may cool your oil but you will pre-heat your cooling air.  &lt;: (

If you need more info on where to fit the Empi 8-pass drop me a line off-list
and I will give you specs.
