Hey!  Do any of you beltway bussers (and buggers) plan to attend the Bug Out
in May?  I realize it's 5 months away, but I've been going for years now and
never met another netter down there.  Perhaps some of us can plan on hooking 
up at some point to do the pizza/beer/whatever thing.  My wife and I will be
coming down perhaps 2 days early in our 1974 Westy, and my brother will be
driving a (non-VW) pickup load of parts down for the swap meet.  (We may also
bring a 3rd vehicle full of parts if we can't cram everything into 2).  We
always camp at Bull Run regional park, and there's usually a BUNCH of VW people
camping there for the Bug Out.
