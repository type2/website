Subject: Re: Interior roof mold

At the risk of asking another YAFAQ, my brother has requested I try to find
a remedy for the increasing presence of moisture and mold on the inside of
the roof to his '81 Westy.  We live in Vancouver, Canada, a very damp
climate, especially in winter.  Is there any way to control this problem?
Any recommended methods for removing existing mold?

i saw a bumper sticker:

Crust music,  it grows on you.    

The bus had a crust of mold grwing on it.  =)

but seriously, eliminate leaks, and keep the heater working.
