I got a dashtray for last Christmas. It cost GB#25. It screws onto the
dashboard and fills the whole width bar the instrument console. It includes
2 cup holders, slot for 2 audio tapes, various slots for pens, sweets,
coins, paperclips, sunglasses, nuts and bolts from work in progress etc etc
and also a large flat section that holds a road atlas perfectly. Finally
the existing ashtray slots into an identical sized hole above the original
hole. I use the ashtray for parking meter coins.

I only have the telephone number of the supplier: +44 1978 660 355 (UK).

&gt; Remember that bandwith about the elusive dashtop tray with the two
&gt; cupholders and a couple of other miscellaneous containers?  I found one
&gt; yesterday off a fresh 82ish Vanagon in a boneyard.  It's fully intact and
&gt; was held to the dash by velcro.  Looks like the only place to use it on
my
&gt; 86 or 88 would be right over the dash ashtray with the lid closed.
&gt;
&gt; Anyway, who was it that was looking for one to make a mold from a while
&gt; back?
