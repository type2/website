Subject: Fast German Auto

In the May 96 issue of VW Trends (p62) there is an ad from Fast German Autoin
Hawthorne, CA that sells vanagon engines, air &amp; water cooled.  $1600 for a
waterboxer and 750 for an aircooled.  Anyone done business with them or know
anything about them?  FYI, their # is 310-679-2801.  Usual disclaimers.
