Subject:      Help! LP Problem

I just tried to fill my newly acquired '87 Westy's LP tank and it would not
take gas.  It just blew it out the bleeder valve (says the guy who tried to
fill it).  Something (I think air) continues to come out of the valve.  Is
there anyway to stop this?  How long will this go on?  What do I need to fix
so I can fill the tank?

Thanks very much,
