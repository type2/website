Subject: Re: changing shocks

Amoung the VW repairs/restoration I have performed over the past 17 years the
biggest bang for the buck, and easiest effort, was replacing shocks. I think
the '81 is the old bolt-at-the-top-and-bottom design, which you can change in
about 15 minute a shock. No joke.

Recently we performed this service to Suzy's 1976. The PO had NEVER replaced
the shocks. After pulling them off the bus, they would compress easily under
thier own weight.  The nitrogen shocks we installed made a HUGE difference. A
shocking improvement.

best o' luck,
