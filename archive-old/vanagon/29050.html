Subject: Re: Lighting Switch

&gt;&gt; BTW who on the net has put a door light switch in the sliding door on a 
&gt;&gt; 84 and on Westie?

Am I correct in assuming they come without a light switch??  My 85 panel had
switches on all doors, but only one light, above the driver.  The 87GL has
same, with two rear lights and drivers side.  They all will come on if any
of the 4 doors are opened.  Thought this was standard?  Neither are Westies
however. 
        I have a spare fitting to install in front passengers side soon, no
other mods req'd, except maybe one light in rear hatch area.
