&gt;I've tried e-mail (both addresses), faxing and calling to a busy
&gt;number for a week.  Still no response...

        I was there on Tuesday.  I was getting a trim piece for the guages
and a set of guages for my '79.  They were busy moveing stuff arround, but
they were answering the phone while I was there.
