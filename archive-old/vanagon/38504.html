Subject:  RE: '90 Rear Heater Leak Fixed :)

i've had rear heater problems too, only the leak was between the 
control valve and the heater itself...on mine ('84) the valve bolts onto
the heater core with two bolts, and the plastic on plastic just doesn't 
seal well enough to stop leaks...am i missing a gasket (the $6.22 one) or a
seal (the $1.89 one)?
