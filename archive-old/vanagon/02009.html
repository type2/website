Subject:  UJ's Numbers again ...


&gt;   damn we lost another desiel Vanagon or two - just when i
&gt;   was getting rec.vanagon.bunker.burner together ...

speaking of which, I'll see if I can get my bunker burner back on the
road for the &quot;bricks across America&quot; tour....  I'd like to join at least
part of the tour, in the Northeast, and I figure the EV does not
yet have enough character accumulated in it (i.e., stickers on the side,
grease and grime in the back, chips, dents, rust, noise, etc., etc...)
to effectively represent the family....
