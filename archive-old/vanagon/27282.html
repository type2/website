Regarding Audi 5 cyl. engines in Vanagons - 

As a Diesel Vanagon owner, I'm always interested in alternatives - four that
come to mind are:
1)  Replace with same (done that once)
2)  Replace with rumored 1.9 or 2 L version 4 cyl Diesel (same tranny
interface ?)
3)  Repalce with new TDI Diesel (same tranny interface?)
4)  New - Replace with 5 cyl  Audi Diesel or Gas (but will if  fit?)

So - Any of you that hear about these kinds of engine swaps - I'd love to hear
about it too.

Harvey
