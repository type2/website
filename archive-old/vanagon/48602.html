ABS ain't all that good....

I remember in the newspaper there was an article on this.  The way they came 
to this conclusion was by comparing acident rates before and after 
ABS....there were no significant difference.  This may be the result of 
ineffective use of the ABS brakes, that is, people are not using them 
effectively.   

BTW,

Consumer reports test of tires noted that in some stopping conditions, i think 
loose materials like snow or gravel, stopping distances are short *without* 
ABS.  Locking up made a faster stop, but, i would think with less steering 
control.

&gt;    Tim,
&gt;          This may not be a joke! There are several car co. that
&gt;          did not find ABS all that it was worth! Some of the 
&gt;          better designed cars found that wheel lock on dry roads
&gt;          to be a very small problem!

&gt; &gt; C'mon Harry, 92% of us KNOW that you can't lock the brakes anyway, it's a
&gt; &gt; vanagon design feature isn't it?  Or is it those cardboard brakes shoes I
&gt; &gt; got for $3.99 at Crappy Tire?  :)   tim smith
