&gt; place is gorgeous! Fabulous views from almost every camp site.

&gt; If we're going this far, why not go to a prettier (and cooler) place?

Well, I've never been in that area at all.  But I have been looking at the 
AAA camping map.  I think it would be nice to camp at a place with flush 
toilets, which according to the map, Red Rock doesn't have.
There are a few camp grounds at at Tehachapi summit that have flush 
toilets, and showers.  Looks like the same elevation as RR, but in a 
mountain pass.

Umm... just a thought...
