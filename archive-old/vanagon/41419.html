Subject: FS:70 westy/WTB

Due to an unfortunate turn of events, I no longer have the time/money to fix my
Cassidy.  She needs a home.  I think I will try to sell her for $450.  Here's
the details:
	1970 Westy pop-top
	no engine or generator
	needs bodywork (PA rust will do that!)
	nice interior
Let me know if anyone is interseted.  Now that I look at this, she is better
off than this makes her sound!  
	Although I can't fix this one up, I do need a vehicle.  I am looking
for a roadworhty bus (or bug or anything really) for around $1000.  I am in NW
PA (Erie, to be exact) and will only be on the list until Friday, when school
gets out and the accounts close, so time is of the essence.  

Amy :)
