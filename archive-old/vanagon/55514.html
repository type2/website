Subject: Re: K2 EuroVan

Judging from the tone of some six recent posts on the subject, 
I take it that I am not the only 95-96 EV owner
who would like to add some stripes or decal to the
all-white exterior look.

I'd like something much less obvious than the K2 look, maybe 
just a couple of delicate stripes or decal in nature-friendly
blue-green.  The Rialta 95 paint scheme is a bit too much, 
the Rialta 96 is even gaudier. Local accessory stores don't have 
anything better than speed stripes for pick-ups.

However I did see some 95 EV Winnebago poptops on the 
Seattle freeways with interesting color additions.  Any of
you reading this mail have some good sources?  Thanks.
