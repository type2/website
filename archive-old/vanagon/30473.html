Subject: Re: Bus top speed, not about spelling!

&gt;	Just one quick question out of complete curiosity.  Just about
&gt;	how fast will a breadloaf bus with the 1970cc fuel injected
&gt;	engine go assuming its in proper tune and all that.  I know it
&gt;	ain't a rocket and I'm thinking it's somewhere around 70-75 mph.
&gt;	Close, way off, or what?
&gt;

With reduction boxes in that '66?  I've done that too in a '66 with boxes.
85 that is. Running a 1600 dp, single Weber.
