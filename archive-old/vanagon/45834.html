Subject: Viper Militia and '68 VW bus

For once I gotta keep it short. A group called the &quot;Viper Militia&quot; were
arrested in Phoenix this week. They had serious plans for major sciopathic
behavior which woulda made the OKC thing look like a cake walk. News reports
showed stupendous amounts of firepower and Amonium Nitrate and Jet fuel
being removed form the *residential* site. I knew I was hard core when I
noticed a really clean looking '68 camper in the background, located at the
house of doom, with stock curtains in it! Yowll I wonder if theyll sell it
for quick lawyer money. These dudes aint camping anytime soon. Maybe they
were planning a roadtrip to Montana. Naw, too many projects already...
