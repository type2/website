Subject: Transmission dead   :-(

Hello All,

I'm at a loss. I had a great trip to Florida with Kalypso, but he started
losing gears back here in York (hard shifting). I've had the tranny taken
out, and it's ripped up pretty badly inside. I can't afford a complete
rebuild.

But I won't let this van go. Do any of you know where I can get a used or
rebuilt transmission for an '87 vanagon (regular--not syncro)? I'll travel
anywhere within a five hour radius of Harrisburg, PA to pick it up, or try
to arrange shipping.

If you know of any possibilities, please email me back as soon as possible.

I've been without Kalypso for a week; life just seems empty and meaningless
now...


Tearfully,
Dave
