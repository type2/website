&gt; Is
&gt;replacement a pretty straight-forward job?

Mark, 

the water pump on my 85 vanagon went out recently.  It is actually leaking
from what is called a `tel-tale' hole located in the housing just below the
impeller shaft.  You can see it if you lay on your back under the engine
comparment.  Use a strong flashlight!  It is about 1/4 inch in diameter.
 When the bearings fail on the pump, coolant can get past them and will leak
out of this hole to tell you the pump is about to fail completely.  At 9k it
shouldn't fail.  A natural life span is 80 - 120k.  Other things can cause
the pump bearings to die early.  Such as contaminants in the coolant system.
 When was the last time you changed the coolant or had the system flushed.
 If you don't usually use the auxillary heater during the summer and just
recently opened the control valve, the coolant that was in the heater core
(and all its corrosion) will then be free to pass through your water pump.

The other possibility is the pump is defective.  Whether it was caused by
contaminants or premature failure, I would recommend taking it back to where
it was installed and have them replace it at their expense.  There is no
legitimate reason the pump should have failed at 9k if it was a quality pump
and you've maintained the services on your van.

As far as doing it yourself.  I wouldn't call it straight-forward, but it
isn't that difficult.  The first time I replaced one took me 4 hours without
a Bentley's Manual.  Make sure you have a good set of sockets, extension bars
and allen wrenches.  I also found a socket universal extremely useful.  Good
Luck
