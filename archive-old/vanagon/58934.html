Subject: brake pressure regulator

OK, a stupid question.  Where is the brake pressure regulator located?  I'm
flushing my brake system this weekend, don't want to spend the whole day
looking for it so I can &quot;push lever toward back wheels&quot; as Bentley
recommends.  Bentley has a picture of it, but no indication of where it is
located...near the booster, maybe?

A related question... Does anyone know the pressure range on a power
bleeder?  I have rigged up a power bleeder from spare parts around the lab,
an air pump with variable pressure from 0-5 psi, and am wondering if I'm
even in the right ball park as far as pressure. (It would be tough to rope
my wife into pumping a couple of quarts of DOT4 through the system by
foot).
