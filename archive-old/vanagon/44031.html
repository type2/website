Subject: Finally back on line!


I finally am back on line after my mail system was down for over a 
week!  A few people, including Michael Heron and Jon Christensen, 
had sent me personal mail that got hosed in the crash.  If it was 
important please re-send.

Thanks and sorry for the non-bus bandwidth.

Dave
