Michael, if you're lucky ... you may only have to regret
asking about the generator. ;(

I have a generator (one of the supposedly quite ones). Last year
it was a big hit with my family ... going out and doing things ...
and having enough power to play with the 'toys', what ever they were.

I mentioned that, here on the list and, after a couple dozen or so
messages, I was glad to let the subject die!  I can get a few of them
to you if you have an interest about the opinions from the list.

    I just punched a tar baby, didn't I..?
