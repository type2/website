Along this conspiracy theme...

I read a flyer that the Porsche shop was handing out awhile back, something
about legislation to do away with all cars made before some arbitrary year, 
like 1980, and give you a $2000 credit toward a new car.  

Yup thats what I wanna do:  trade the old 911 for a spankin' new Hundai!
(sounds of serious retching, coughing up blood and bile)

There! Now I feel better!
