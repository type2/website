&gt; 
&gt; Dave Kautz inquires about putting a Type 1 engine where the Type 4 belongs.
&gt; You have to value your time real low, Dave, to make this conversion price
&gt; out right.  You'll need to fabricate a big apron to seal above-engine from
&gt; below-engine, along with the custom rear support member and tricky sheet
&gt; metal in the front corners.  It's usually cheaper to make the original 
&gt; stuff work right, rather than to get something wierd to work adequately.
&gt; 

 I was thinkng more along the lines of procuring the necessary parts from 
 a European or Mexican junkyard - But your point is well taken, by the time
 I got through paying for all the extra bits for the conversion I would
 have been better off paying the extra cost of the type IV parts and would
 be happier with the results. The engineer in me has examined the design of
 both the Type I and IV engines and thinks the IV is a finer piece of work.
 Now on the other hand, it would probably cost about the same to fit your
 2.2 911T engine into my Westie.......

 Thanks to everyone for the helpful responses.

 Dave
