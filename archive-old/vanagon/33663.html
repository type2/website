Subject: Re: hotvw want ads

Patrick (EAGAN_at_loyola_dot_edu) was grousing about a Hotvws ad:
&gt; 1968 VW truck in wonderful condition......
&gt;  $ 8,000. located in south carolina....

&gt;I noticed the same thing and about choked. I showed the ad to my wife and
mentioned that in 1981 I had to just about beg people to buy my '68 single.
&lt;Rayguns trickle-down economix and all&gt; It was another one of those &quot;wish I
never sold it&quot; situations. I was so broke that I couldn't afford to pay the
$30. extra dollars per month to insure it. Wife #1rode my hemoroids until I
sold it.  Should sold that wife instead. ;) Got about $2100. for it. Got way
less for the spouse. In fact it cost me some... =)
