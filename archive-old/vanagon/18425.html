Due to the lower air density at higher altitudes your engine may run slightly
rich and therefore cooler.  The general rule of thumb is that you may advance
your timing one degree for each thousand feet of altitude.  And with that
stated let me offer some personal advice.  If you do not have a degree wheel,
and are not running electronic ignition the chances are that your timing will
wander a bit even under ideal circumstances, thanks to the plug gap, wear in
the distributor shaft, rubbing block and so forth.  If you intend to operate
above 5,000 feet elevation for a prolonged period of time (ie, a move to
Denver, etc) then by all means, re-time your engine.  Otherwise, leave it
alone, unless it gives tells you in an obvious way that it would prefer a
different setting, in which case crank in a degree or two -- whatever the
engine likes -- to return its operation to harmony with your driving habits,
load carried, type of gas and, for all I know, the color of your hair and
eyes.  The point is, the settings in the manuals refer to new engines
operated under a set of fixed conditions.  Reality is seldom so kind, yet the
engine is always willing to let you know when it is happiest.

The symptoms of altitude sickness usually resemble retarded timing; lack of
power, poor economy, possibly a bit of black smoke or start-up or when
attempting to accelerate.  However, if you are running a hot CDI or other
all-electronic ignition module, the symptoms may be partially masked by the
cleaner burn and longer spark duration provided by most CDI's ( which are
easily retro-fitted if you're not presently using one.  Coupled with platinum
plugs, the combo virtually eliminates tune-ups for air-cooled veedubs.)

You may put aside any fears of high-altitude (ie, low-pressure) vapor locking
(as opposed to high temp vapor locks).  Since about 1980 all automobile fuel
sold in the United States has a vapor pressure that allows it to be used
safely to about 12,000 at 100 degrees Fahrenheit (an unlikely combination).
 For the past twelve years the Experimental Aircraft Association has been
using mogas in aircraft, reporting the results to the FAA and the EAA
members.  Several certified aircraft engines are now permitted to use mogas,
or 'tractor' gas as pilots tend to call it.  Works fine, even in old
Volkswagens; no problems with low-pressure vapor-locking.
