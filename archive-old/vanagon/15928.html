          yeah, i got one of those ads, too, but i beg to differ with
          those of you who see it as an accurate replica.  nowhere on
          these photos do i see any chipped paint, or dented bumpers.
          there is absolutely no rust below the windows, and i assume
          from first hand descriptions we've received on this list
          that the undercarriage is intact.  probably even has those
          little squarish channels for the jack that i've heard so
          much about.  hah!  you call that a replica??  i'll bet there
          aren't any plants growing under the rubber mats either.
