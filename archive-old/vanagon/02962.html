Subject: Help!! '67 transmission 
Date: Tue, 16 Aug 94 15:19:13 EDT
From: rapalmer_at_unity.ncsu_dot_edu

The transmission on my trusty '67 has began leaking oil from the front.
It''s not so bad for local driving, but it spews horribly on the
highway. I am fairly certain it is coming from the front, where the
shifter comes out. If anyone knows what sort of gasket or bushing this
may be, and how to replace it, or anything else, please do help me. I
really don't want to spend a lot, and split window transmissions are
hard to find and expensive. BTW, the reduction boxes are fine.
thanks 
Richard
