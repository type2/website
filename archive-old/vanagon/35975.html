Subject: 	Re: Need auto-stop propane tank valve

uh, somebody said:
&gt;
&gt; &gt;I understand that when the tank is full overflow propane is supposed to
&gt; &gt;come out there when the tank is more than 80% full. Is that right?
&gt; &gt;Nothing comes out of mine.
&gt;

just so we are all clear....
you ARE *opening* the bleed screw before filling (and expecting
propane to gush out when full)???  the bleed screw must be open prior
to filling.

that bleeder is easy to check.  when you know you have some propane
in the tank (light the stove to check, not assume) just open that
thumbwheel and see if propane hisses out.  if not, probably dirt has
packed into the unprotected opening.  with the valve closed, insert a
dental tool into the end and check for obstructions.  scrape dirt out
if necessary and open the valve to blow out the pickings.

Manchester supply has rebuild kits avail. for the auto-stop valves.
they include a few o-rings, a SS intake screen and a miniscule amount
of grease.  the kits are a whopping $4 or something and did fix my
auto-stop from a leaker to a smiler  :)
