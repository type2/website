Yo, Jesse!

Welcome back. You'll notice that vanagon_at_lenti is now watercooled only, so
you may now want to send your mail to type2_at_primenet_dot_com instead.

Remove your drum to get access to the star thingy. You'll notice that it
is hollow, in fact drilled and tapped. If I remember well, one of the two
bolts that held your drum will fit in this hole, so screw the bolt in
there. It will go all the way to the bottom and then push the star thingy,
just like a corkscrew will open a bottle of wine. Use plenty of
penetrating oil.

Hope this helps,

Sami ('75 Westf.)
