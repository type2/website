Subject: 1980 VW Camper for sale

Well, I can't hang onto it forever, and (unlike some of you folks) I can't
justify keeping two VW campers around, so the '80 is up for sale.
I haven't advertised it locally yet, but I put the for sale notice and more
details on my Web page. No underpriced bargain-basement deal here, sorry.
But its clean, has many extras, and is running strong. It's been a fun
vehicle, I hope its replacement is too!

Anyway, if you're interested, check it out at:

(Actually I just went over my entire site with a beta of SiteMill. Very
handy - it pointed out a couple of subtle and/or stupid errors and let me
easily change things around. Cleaned up the calendar page too.)

(Oh yeah, it also includes 1 free &quot;Space Your Face&quot; sticker on the
passenger window and a Darwin fish on the back. Which reminds me - I saw an
anti-Darwin fish the other day: it consisted of a Darwin fish with a red
slash through it, inside a bigger fish. I guess someone didn't like their
icon usurped!)
