Subject: Two Bobs Passing in the Night (slim VW content)

I was towing my '60 DD Panel in from where it's been parked the last two 
years (&quot;awaiting restoration&quot;) and, as I'm tooling down the highway, kids 
are passing me in their low-rider pickups, giving me friendly waves, 
flashing peace signs and the like.  Suddenly I see *many* flashing red 
lights in the opposite lane up ahead.  Thinking it was an accident, I 
slow down.  Then I realize that it's the &quot;Bob Dole Motorcade&quot; (he arrived 
in Springfield, heading for Branson).  All sorts of police, highway 
patrol, sheriff and Secret Service vehicles.  And a caravan of Ford 
Aerostars ... with me and my Micro heading in the opposite direction.  
Must mean somethin' ...  ;-)
