&gt;&gt;DO NOT FILL GAS CANS IN THE BED OF A TRUCK WITH A =

&gt;&gt;PLASTIC BED LINER
&gt;
&gt;Actually, I believe this is true.  The problem is not static in the
plastic
&gt;bed... it's that the plastic bed doesn't allow the static generated by
&gt;pouring the gas to dissipate.

Ron, you're right.  Flowing fuel does generate a large amount of static
electricity.  In addition to grounding the fuel truck, all pipes and
components inside the fuel tanks are either bonded with a ground strap or=

intrinsically safe and insulated.  This is one of the two viable theories=

left as to the cause of TWA flight 800 accident.
