Subject: '73 1700 rebuild

 Hi all. We just fininshed installing the new rings &amp; heads on my sister's
73 camper (1700cc type IV), and I got a couple of questions before it goes 
back in -
 note; prior to the rebuild, cylinders 3&amp;4 had about 35 lbs compression each.
The other side was OK, but we did both sides.

 1) The outside rocker arm on cylinder 3 is unusually close to the valve. So
close that the tip of the adjustment screw is barely visible before it hits
the valve. We have adjusted it as well as possible, but anyone know what 
might be causing this? The heads and rockers are torqued down properly, and
I don't really remember the rocker being like this before the rebuild 
...
 My Hayes manual says to adjust the valves on this year (after a particular
chasis #, which it is) to .008 ... does this sound right ... it mentioned
something about the valves having built of a different material (carbon maybe?).
 Just wanted to check this, as the Hayes and Idiot book don't agree.

 2) Also, the heater boxed are not too bad, and the insides look great, but part
s of the shell are rusted through. What do you all think of using fiberglass
(and mesh) to fix this? Something along the lines of a 'bandage' would be
ideal. I've had very little luck in the past with those muffler bandages that
are supposed to fuse themselves as they heat up.

 I really would appreciate any help anyone can offer. Thanks!
