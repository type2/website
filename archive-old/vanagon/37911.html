&gt; Please, please don't turn that blabbermouth Steve with his V6anagon loose
&gt; on us again! All he does is talk about how great the engine in it is,
&gt; how macho he is as a result, etc. etc.!

Steve, do I sence irritation concerning our ceaseless teasing and 
prodding about your V6anagon?  :)

I just want you to know that if I had a Vanagon and a Citation and IF 
IT WERE POSSIBLE I would fuse them together into one fabulous 
creation of iron and plastic, and I'd call it &quot;Vanatation&quot;  And it 
would have 8 wheels, two engines, and it would have &quot;Hoverability&quot;  
and I would drive it on land and by sea.  And the great VW god would 
smite vengence on me and I would sink to a wasser(boxer)y grave.

The end.
