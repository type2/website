Subject:      '84 Westfalia Starting Problem

&quot;84 Westfalia water-cooled has &quot;intermittent&quot; starting problem after
driving
in town or on highway. When attempting to start after driving, there will
be a momentary engine firing and then no ignition. The motor will turn over
without starting. Additional attempts to start only flood the motor. Let
the van sit for 30 min. to 2 hours and it starts slowly. Cold starts are
always instantly successful. Two local VW mechanics have given it there
best efforts with no success. At this point, I don't find a pattern in this
intermittent problem. It's is very frustrating because I never know if the
van will start. For example, if I kill it at a stop sign... Thanks for your
suggestions.
