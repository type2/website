Subject: RE: Stoopid Parts Stores [f]


&gt;I LOVE parts stores that tell you they have the part you're looking
&gt;for and when you get CLEAR over there they really don't have it.


Let's not forget the ones that sell you a part where the box/package/
whatever has obviously been opened, but you buy it because it's the
only one they have on the shelf, and you go home and bash a few knuckles
in a 1-hour installation only to find that IT DOESN'T WORK... a 1-hour
removal, back to the store, a LOT of digging/detective work, and you
finally discover that the part was a return from some other disgruntled
customer who also found that it didn't work, and some clerk with the
IQ of a doorknob simply put it back on the shelf instead of sending it
back to the manufacturer...

I hereby claim credit for longest one-sentence rant in List history.
Send all compliments/congratulations/monetary contributions to...
