Subject:      Clutch chattering and bucking 84 on

Hello
I have 15 k on sachs clutch  come from Bus depot {RON}
the disc was made in Canada
no problem at all  each trip was aronud 550 km with 2 hours of traffic
no chatter nothing
 Did the flywheel was refaced on your van??
 the  guide sleeve for the bearing is good no spots no nicks not
pitted.?
 A new bearing was installed ?
 Did the run out of the flywhell was good ?
This is the kind of troubles you had when you install rebuilt clutch,
but with new parts i never had problems
