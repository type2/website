&gt; well, i got another sucker-letter in the mail today from Franklin Mint,
&gt; wanting me to buy their Classic Microbus, for ONLY 5 equal payments of
&gt; $27* each (*Plus my state sales tax and a one-time shipping charge of $4.95),
&gt; with the first payment due prior to shipment.  &quot;all orders subject to
&gt; acceptance&quot;. HA!&gt; 
&gt; anyhoo, was anybody stupi ... er, Dedicated (yeah, that's it!) enough to
&gt; buy this thing? :)  i'm kinda curious as to the quality/etc.

Nah, I'm gonna hold out for the &quot;Klassic Kars Porcelin Hummel Figurine
