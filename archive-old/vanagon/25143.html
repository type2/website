Maybe you Gals and Guys can help...

I'm torn choosing my next project.  Its either the '65 notchback or the
'61 double door kombi.

Notchback:
advantages: somewhat rare, reasonably straight and complete, and I don't
have one.
disadvantages: have to delve into the mysterious world of type III's

Bus:
advantages: its a bus, its a double door (somewhat rare) and I know them
pretty well.
disadvantages:  already have one, serious body work to be done (nose replace
ment and pulling out front apron.

Well, whadday think?  I gotta make up my mind soon, or I'll be outta luck on
both counts.
