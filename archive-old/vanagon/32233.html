Subject: Stalling, vanagon

Newest phenomena is the suddenly stalling van, when coldish.  Starter probs 
have gone away, following the blowtorch BBQ treatment.  Now it will suddenly 
die after running a while.  Seems like once it warms up a bit something 
switches off that kills the engine below say 1500 RPM, where the idle 
stabilizer likes to operate.  May occur for say 5 minutes, then disappear 
completely after a restart. Won't start unless gas pedal is blipped and held 
down a bit, which makes me suspect the fuel cutoff microswitch on the 
throttle plate. Any takers? Still can't feel that idle stabilizer hum 
either, hmmmm?   Tim Smith
