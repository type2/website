Subject: RE: Do I have the wrong pressure plate?


&gt;'70 and earlier use the t/o bearing that has a raised ring in the 
&gt;center.  This mates with the 3-arm p.p.  You'll notice (I didn't notice 
&gt;what year bus you own) that you have no sleeve (on yer trans.).  
&gt;
&gt;'71 and later use a sleeved-transmission shaft with the smooth-faced t/o 
&gt;bearing.  This mates with the multi-splined &quot;porsche-type&quot; p.p.

But if the multi-splined (18 fingered) or 3 arm pressure plate have a
collar to join them all, the early (1961-1970) t-o bearing will work.

&gt;I had a couple &quot;professional&quot; mechanics tell me there was no diff. and 
&gt;that any combo. would work.  They were wrong. 

Damn straight!
 

&gt; Eventually, I realize 
&gt;the problem, replace t/o and p.p. both with old style.  
&gt;Result:  perfect clutching.

Ho! Ho!  I like that!
