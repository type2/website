Dennis:

   Thanks for info on Rialta pricing.   IMO, it's one of the nicest   
class B van camper packages out there, few of which feature both widebody
design and decent interior styling.  The price is in the ballpark for
this type of vehicle, and I think the VR6 is the powerplant we've been
waiting for all this time.  If I were looking to trade up from the Westy,
I'd be looking up dealer prices in Edmunds right now, but I think we'll
be hanging onto Wernher for the time being.  No harm in hitting the
occasional RV show, however. &lt;BG&gt;

   One caveat I have is the manufacturer, Winnebago, who once offered a
nearly identical unit, called the LeSharo on a Pugeot chassis, in both
gas and diesel models.  This was the Renault Dauphine of motorhomes.

    Winnebago seems to be one of  those outfits that would never admit
they might have screwed up and produced a real dog, judging from former
LeSharo owner laments and the  weird responses  I've seen from the
Winnebago rep who sometimes participates in the Compuserve RV Forum.  Her
comeback to people who might have been burned by them, in lieu of an
apology or even a bit of sympathy, is to buy a new Rialta!
