&gt; I have a standard trunk-deck mounted bike rack, we used on the Jetta.  I saw
&gt; one on a Vanagon recently, and after looking at mine, I realized that those
&gt; things are adjustable.  The hooks I used to attach to the front end of the
&gt; trunk deck can attach to the top of the Vanagon back door.  The 90 degree
&gt; (approx.) bracket has pins in it that allow you to adjust it.  And the feet
&gt; that used to stradle the top and rear end of the trunk lid are also
&gt; adjustable, allowing you to open them from a 90 degree configuration to a
&gt; 180 degree config.  Take a look at a standard trunk-mounted bike rack, and
&gt; see if you find one that is adjustable.

YES!  I have used one like this on my Vanagon.  Straps to the rear hatch
without any problem.  If you're muscular, you can even get the hatch open
with the bikes tied on.  Get whatever cheap-sh*t model you can at the local
K-mart or garage sale.


The back end of your Vanagon ends up looking like this from the side:
