Subject: re: 22 and no tickets

Bradley was lamenting the fact that he's only gotten 0 speeding tickets
before age 22. I don't know if this counts, but I've gotten 2 speeding
tickets, but I've been pulled over for speeding more times than I care
to count.  In one case I wasn't wearing my seatbelt(non moving violation)
another time I did not have my insurance papers in the car(show proof
if insurance + $10), another time expired tags(proof of renewal + $10),
another time the officer was tailgating me(I assume that in North Carolin
Carolina that is a no-no, as he was more than willing to let me go. I
cannot remember any other examples, but it took no whining on my part
to get these officers to let me go. Maybe it was my charm ;-).  One
time when my wife got pulled over, before I met her, she was going
95 mph in a 55 zone, no seat belt, passenger - no seatbelt, expired tags,
and about 6 other violations of some cryptic Louisiana code.

Regards,

David
