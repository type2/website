Subject: Re: Reducing Internal Noise

Friendly warning!!! These self adhesive roofing underlayments contain skin
and eye irritants and give off unpleasant and potentially damaging vapors!
They should not be used without CAREFUILLY READING ALL OF THE MFGR'S
WARNINGS AND THE PRODUCT TECHNICAL DATA SHEETS, which are available from any
authorized wholesaler of roofing materials. BTW, the product is heat
sensitive, and can be thermally bonded to most surfaces (including you) by
the use of a heat gun or hair dryer.

As a general contractor who has used these products for years, I can testify
to the fact that they must be handled with care and caution. More than one
of my workmen received severe skin or eye inflamations from handling these
products without adequate protection. I also caution you against using them
in closed, unventilated environments (like the inside of a VW Transporter)
because of the fumes they give off. Be carefull!! It's a jungle out there!!

Regards to all,

&gt;&gt;&gt; There is a material known as &quot;Ice Guard,&quot; which is used by roofing
&gt;&gt;&gt; contractors. It is similar to Dynamat, both in thickness and density. It is
&gt;&gt;&gt; self-adhesive on one side, and seems to work very well.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;How thick is this stuff?  I'm definitely in need of soundproofing for my
&gt;&gt;Westy ( a diesel ).
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Unfortunately, it is sold only in large quantities (225 ft^2 rolls), and
&gt;&gt;&gt; runs about $70 for this much. Perhaps a few people could get together for a
&gt;&gt;&gt; roll, or it might be possible to get scraps from a roofing contractor.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;What are the dimensions of the roll?  The size of tar-paper, I'd guess.
&gt;&gt;Is that 3 feet or 30 inches?
&gt;
&gt;Hi Gerry,
&gt;
&gt;Sorry, but I don't know what the exact thickness of it is. I just pulled
&gt;all the information from the FAQ and quickly threw it up to the list. The
&gt;FAQ did say it was similar, how similar though I don't know.
&gt;
&gt;Perhaps we have some architects/contractors/builders on the list who might
&gt;remember the dimensions of this stuff?
&gt;
&gt;Whatever the dimensions are, I'm sure we'd end up with some extras to make
&gt;beer bottle/can insulators. Hey, we could slap some V_at_L stickers on 'em and
&gt;start selling 'em! ;-)
