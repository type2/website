Subject: Re: Buying (building) a new Vanagon


&gt;According to the VW South Africa page:

&gt; http://www.vw.co.za/bus/bus_club/tech.html

&gt;you can still buy a Vanagon in SA.  Looks like it's offered with the 4
&gt;and 5 cylinder in-line waterpumpers.

&gt;'Course you'd have a near impossible time getting one into the US, but
&gt;hey, fantasies are just that.

If you really like to import a new SA Vanagon, you may call Mr. Gordon. He
is the export expert of VW SA:
