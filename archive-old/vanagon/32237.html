Subject: Re: Stalling, vanagon

&gt; Newest phenomena is the suddenly stalling van, when coldish.  Starter probs 
&gt; have gone away, following the blowtorch BBQ treatment.  Now it will suddenly 
&gt; die after running a while.  Seems like once it warms up a bit something 
&gt; switches off that kills the engine below say 1500 RPM, where the idle 
&gt; stabilizer likes to operate.  May occur for say 5 minutes, then disappear 
&gt; completely after a restart. Won't start unless gas pedal is blipped and held 
&gt; down a bit, which makes me suspect the fuel cutoff microswitch on the 
&gt; throttle plate. Any takers? Still can't feel that idle stabilizer hum 
&gt; either, hmmmm?   Tim Smith

Do!  Same problem I had. I had to replace the FI module. All was well 
afterwards.
