Subject: speedometer in 2wheel driveVan

     Ok now I see the problem... My syncro speedometer is right on
     the money, it's the 2 wheel drive speedo. that is slow!... and I 
     thought the different gears in the axil would make it the opposite!
     It's reading    49 M.P.H. at 3000 RPM. Anyone care to
     compare that?......
