Subject: Blowing kitchen w. pump fuses - help!

Well, had the maiden voyage last week. Took my new 84 wasserboxer on a
900k &quot;road test&quot; to the Kawartha Lakes region of southern Ontario. 

Laughed like a kid the first couple of times that I got the &quot;wave&quot; from
other Westy drivers. Wife now thinks I might be cool again.

Since this wasn't an overnight trip we weren't really rigged for camping
so didn't bother doing anything with the water tank/pump/drain
connections. 

I will be going remote camping this weekend so I decided last night to check
out the water system. Got the garden hose and put 5-7 litres of water in
the tank. (Do most of you carry a funnel to do this with?). Level
indicators work, at least the low level red does.

So - water in the tank = water out the pump ? Ha

Culprit is the water pump 3a fuse. Replace - PoP. Clean contacts (which
were very corroded), replace fuse - PoP.

I want this to be no more than a five fuse job so I turn to ya'll for help:

Does this pump need to be primed in some way. I don't think it has been
used in years.

Maybe I need to fill the tank completely? Does the water pressure of a
full tank have any roll to play?

If there is a short somewhere how to I go about tracing it? Auto
electrical systems intimidate me. 

Thanks for the help. More questions to follow...
