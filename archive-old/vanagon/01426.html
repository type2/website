&gt;Since most of the figures for mileage were for vangons, and mostly
&gt;water-cooled at that, I was wondering if someone can tell me if
&gt;the 10-12 mpg I am getting on a recently (1000 mi.) overhauled
&gt;engine is as pathetic as I think or if it's par for the course.

if that's driving back and forth to work in stop-and-go traffic, i would
guess it to be not so bad (for a newly rebuilt engine). if that's highway
mileage, i'd say your carbs need adjusting. my old 73 used to get about
20 mpg for highway mpg.

&gt;In the (maybe not-so) recent thread on camper types, mine was
&gt;omitted (sob!).  I have a '72 Safare Custom, with a pop-top that
&gt;starts behind the driver's compartment (luggage rack in front) and
&gt;pops straight up.  Is this uncommon, or was it just overlooked in the
&gt;discussion?

it would appear to be that rare. you have one of only two on the list. but
then, most non-westfalia conversion campers are rather rare, i think. some
of the other non-westfalia versions are even more rare (at least on the
list). there is only one Country Homes camper, and no Adventurewagens at all.

and who knows how many different camper versions there were in germany! :)
