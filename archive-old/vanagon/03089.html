Shit....now we will all have to behave!!!

It was great with Unka Joel here...shippin all of that marajuhana stuff
to Woodstock last week in the &quot;vanagon-list gas/grass/or ass
caravan to Woodstock&quot;....we really kept things going there....

It was great how we all introduced ourselves to our customers (
and for some...the local authorities) as: &quot;Hi I Gerry
Skerbitz....&quot;

.....ok...ok....I'm only pullin' yer leg...Joel was the only one
misbehavin'

8-)

Welcome back!

Ric
