Subject: grill

Doees anyone out there know of a source for vanagon spoiler kits and body
kits/grille? I saw one in an old vw/porsche mag i was thumbing through
yesterday(prior to inserting it in the round file) and saw an ad from
Änything Ltd.&quot;in LA for a cool grille for round headlite vanagons which had
two driving lites in the grille ala Kamei rabbit/scrirrocco. Unfortunately
they are out of bus.. Thanks Ed
