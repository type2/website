Last week Joel recommended that I try bleeding the clutch system for
my 85 Vanagon who's clutch doesn't want to disengage.  Well, I did
it.  Got all that old black gook out and she still won't disengage.
After bleeding it, I noticed that the arm still wasn't moving more
than a 1/2 to 3/4 of an inch.  I could also here a clunk or loud tap
when the clutch pedal was pushed in.

So now I'm thinking about rebuilding the slave cylinder.  Somebody
said rebuilds weren't always successful.  But the dealer wants $34.00
for the rebuild kit and $171.00 for a new cylinder.

If anyone has any thoughts on this let me know.  It's getting colder
in the garage and I want to cure this before I go into hibernation.
