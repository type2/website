Subject: Re: 3 Window Pop Top?
Date: Sun, 26 Mar 1995 21:35:05 -0500 (EST)

i installed a three window pop-top on my '73 sliding sunroof bus.  is your
friend's bus equiped w/ a sunroof? if its not, tell him/her DON'T DO IT. 
unless the correct reinforcement beams are installed across the roof, the
van will lose structurarl integrity and drive like an over cooked egg noodle.

anyway, it was easy.  with the help of several friends i removed the
sliding panel and operating gear.  we laid the pop-top onto of the car, lifted
into the position it would be in while open, and scribed the places to
drill through the  roof through the feet. we then removed the top, drilled
out the holes, and bolted the thing on.  make sure to use the
reinforcement plates that go on the inside to keep the bolts from rippin
through the roof. we had to fabricate some from small pieces of sheet metal.
the support legs go in the sunroof track.  the luggage carrier we just
laid in position, drilled through the screw holes, and screw  it on.  we
also added some bolts to hopefully keep it from becoming a missile.

the canvas itself needed some repair which was easy enough w/ a sewing
machine.  the thing is solidly attached, doesn not leak (knock wood) and
with new purple canvas looks really cool. 

if your friend has any specific questions, e-mail me directly at
