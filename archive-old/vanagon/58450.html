Okidoki, thanks to Jim and others we now have a how-to on the vents etc.       

For winter work, how do you close off all external frigid air to the front
of a Westie?  I can't seem to get the levers to shut down all airflow so I
bought some sorels and a blanket.

Now that it's summertime, this is a non too pressing question but I'm sure
Tim in the great north knows these things as does Harry.  So how-do-dey-do-dat?
