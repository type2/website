&gt; &gt; I see references to the idiot's guide alot. Is this a real manual or
&gt; &gt; just a code name for another book? If it is a real manual, I would
&gt; &gt; like to send a couple of copies to the dealer.... No Joke! Really!

&gt; Reminds me of the guy I knew with a German Capri (7?, V6, 5sp almost 
&gt; bought it, another story) who, after a few frustrating trips to his local 
&gt; Ford dealer, started putting the_factory_manual_on the front seat. He 
&gt; said it showed regular use. :}
&gt; 
Joel has a good point! It may be worthless to send them to the dealers because
the mechanics probably can't read. So maybe the Ford_manual was used as hand
wipers.
