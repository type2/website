Ya larn somtin new ever day.  Hummph!  I sit corrected (a little 
more warm too boot!)

Indeed, the top lever in my '80 Vanagon DOES control location of 
floor heat.  Right = defrost, center = front only, left = front and rear

As to adjusting them, I suspect that the adjustment is in the 
clamping location of the cable sheath behind the dash.  Loosen and 
changing the position of the sheath will change the relative position 
of the business end of the vent door relative to the cable itself, thus 
allowing some adjustments.

&gt; &gt; Speaking of adjustment, is there any way to adjust the cables that control
&gt; &gt; which vents the heated air comes out of? On the Vanagon there is a single
&gt; &gt; lever that lets the driver switch air between the front and rear floor
&gt; &gt; vents, the front floor vents only, or the defroster vents only. As i move
&gt; &gt; the lever to the defroster position (far right), the lever stops about an
&gt; &gt; inch short of the stop on the right side. I get plenty of air from the
&gt; &gt; defroster vents but I can't seem to get it to the point where the rear
&gt; &gt; floor vent closes and only the front floor vents are open. It seems like
&gt; &gt; it's either all the floor vents or the defroster vents, with no in-between.
&gt; &gt; Anyone know how to adjust this?
&gt; 
&gt; Yours may be different than mine, they made some changes in the
&gt; heating system between the '80 and '81 models.  So take this with a
&gt; dose of reality.
&gt; 
&gt; The control levers only change the air flow from defroster to floor.

WRONG, WRONG, WRONG I admit.
I can get front heat, without heat to the rear with lever in center position.
Sean, it could be that there is something inside the vent where the door 
is, holding it open.

&gt; That's it, there are no controls to change the distribution of the
&gt; front floor (actually knee) outlets versus the rear outlet.  

Above is wrong, too, as you can figger out by now.
The below stuff may still apply.

&gt; Pull off the dash cover and look around for broken cable sheaths.
&gt; These may limit lever travel.  I fixed a broken one with slit tigon
&gt; tubing with shrink wrap around it.
