&gt; 
&gt; &gt;So NOBODY on the list knows anything about removing/installing the
&gt; &gt;sliding door vent window?  Wow.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Well, you can remove it with a large rock.
&gt; 
&gt; Now aren't you glad you asked?   :^)
&gt; 
Steve, that's my method of last resort.  I only do that when I get
REALLY frustrated :) .  Or if I'm just not in the mood to do what
Bentley says :)

Now that you mention it though.....
