Subject: Argh...CV joints...what now?

hey now,

frustration level is high....

okay....all cv joints are off. the cv joints on one driveshaft have been
disassembled, cleaned and put in ziploc bags marked right, inner and right
outer etc. new boots are on the drive shaft. that part took a little time but
wasn't that hard.

(i've failed to do all the marking on the cv joint body, cage, and hubs like
mr. muir suggested...i WILL do it in the future. i have marked which side
of the driveshaft goes to the trans. case)

now comes the part that make me wanna pack up all these parts and go have the
local mechanic put them back together. even following the idiots guide i'm
having trouble putting the hub, balls, cage and body of the cv back together.
let me explain what i did which seemed to work...it moved freely like the
joints on the other driveshaft.

1) i greased the balls, hub, and cage.
2) i fit the hub in the cage.
3) then the hub/cage in the body of the cv
4) i tilted the hub and cage enuff to get the balls into their places.
5) then greased the whole shebang, and fit it on the driveshaft. fit right..
rotated good, just like the other ones.
6) the problem: when i try to fit the cover, which is attached to the boot/
trans. case...it' not a perfect fit...ie. i can get the cv joint most of the
way in the case...but it's not in perfect. will this just tighten down and be
even when i tighten the bolts? i have the right boot, i know. should i not use
the cover that came with the boot...i know the old cover that was on with the
old boot fits fine.

i'm beginning to think that i've bitten off more than i can chew.
