Subject: Heater pipe insulation

Here, Washington DC, in the winter, it does not get REAL cold, but
it gets real wet and chilly.

My question: What are people using to insulate the pipe that
runs up the center of the body? 

RIght now I have the original pipe, slathered with rubber roofing
sealer. This stuff will stick to rusty metal for a couple
(like 10) years before it gets too hard and falls off. The sealer
seals the leaks and keeps the paper and plastic jacket from disintegrating.

I have thought of replacing the pipe with PVC, but dont relish the
though of passing hot (hot) air through a plastic pipe and
releasing toxic gases. Does anybody know the temp at which PVC
gives off toxic gases?

I also want to extra insulate it. I want to put something around it that
will really insulate it from cold water splashes and air streams
while not soaking up salt water like a sponge. I looked for some of
that pipe insulation, but the outside of the pipe is about 4 inches,
and the home place did not have any that size. Mabye just an aluminum
panel across the center console with some small water drainage holes?
