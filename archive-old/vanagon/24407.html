Yes, this is the same Bus that is getting the new cargo floor sections, 
rockers, and outriggers.

The mounts look like they were physically removed when one of the previous 
owners put in the false Westy package mickey-mouse style.

I repeat, I do not see *ANY* mounts on the floor for any seats/seat 
belts.  I wish I did...

I guess once I have the new floors in, I could put in whatever I want?  I 
just would like to find out what was originally in this MicroBus.  Just 
call me difficult. :-)
