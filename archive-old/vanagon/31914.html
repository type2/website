&gt; I can't remember what 1973 engine seal rubber looks like, but
&gt;aircooled Vgon seal is really neat: fills gap of anywhere from 1/4 to 1
&gt;inch, so you don't need to get the shape exact.

This brings up a sore spot with me - my '75 Westy engine seal is made of this
funky FOAM RUBBER stuff - which soaks up any spilt oil like the sponge it is
(I keep a quart in the engine compartment - didn't cap it tightly and guess
what?? Yes, oil all over the place!!) and any water which splashes up onto
the bottom of bus.  Makes tuneups a *real* drag, as of course to remove valve
covers and adjust valves, I have to come in contact with this oozy stuff,
always have oil/water/gunk dribbling off my elbows... is this foam rubber
stuff an oddity that the PO visited on my bus, or (ack!) standard issue??  It
will *definitely* get replaced if/when the engine is next removed...
