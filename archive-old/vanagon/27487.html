Subject: Electric cars.

	I'm personally for electric cars, particularly for my commute. Stop
and go is a lousy environment for any car, but its ALL loss when my engine
is idling and I'm sitting at a dead stop. An electric vehicle would be
dramaticly more efficient. VW's auto-cycling EcoDiesel, not available in
this country, addresses this point nicely.

	Regarding charging 'em: Charging is off-peak hours, eg overnight.
Our current powerplant system is sized for running the business day
and prime-time: computers, air conditioning, lights, etc. There's a
remarkable oversupplly of electricity between 10pm and 6am.

	Combustion: Gasoline combustion give a lot of power, some
polution even with 3 way catalysts, and don't forget the warm-up period
of the catalyst. I think itm was Volvo who wrapped an electric heater
around the catalyst and produced a near-zero-tailpipe-emission car-
just by pre-heating the cat to 500F or so. Natural gas burns cleaner,
all other things being equal. But they're not- a thermal power plant
can be dramaticly more efficient AND less poluting than our little
300-500cc cylinders.
	So going from internal combustion/gasoline to external combustion/
natural gas, even with the effiency losses of lead/acid batteries, you
get a very real pollution per seat/mile savings.

	Down-sides:
	Lead Acid batteries are full of lead and sulphuric acid. Nasty
things in an accident. More volume and wieght of nasty stuff than a
gas-tank in a gas car, and consider what happens if you short-out
a battery capable of driving a 2000lb car 100 miles... that's a LOT
of energy

	Lead recycling isn't all it could be- some of it is done off-shore
because US environmental laws are expensive to comply with. But one isn't
consuming lead in a battery, just making use of it. Its all still
there when you're done, and the vast majority of the lead in a worn-out
battery can be recovered and re-used.

	Reality:
	Urban and sub-urban quick trips and commutes are what an electric
car is good for. Its a second, perhaps a third, car for a family of
two adults and 1.6 children. Its not a long-distance cruiser, I won't
be driving one, on battery power, down to visit Joel in the land of
the sabre-toothed 'possum. For the 12 mile commute I drive today,
an electric would be ideal. For the 35-45 mile one-way distance I'm
expecting after I move, its a little marginal. I'd buy the extra-range
options. But I hope to buy one one day.

	And if I have to to keep it on the road, an electric conversion
of my single-cab would be pretty sanitary- put the batteries in the
under-bed compartment VW has supplied me with :)

	But heck, at this point, I'd be happy to have it running on
its non-catalyzed 1600 single port!

	Cheers, all
	Bill
