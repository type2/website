Subject: My Splitty in the snow!

One hour since last posting - I went out to the garage where our bus has been
hibernating since last October, turned the key...chug chug phut,,turn key
again..chug chug....LIFT OFF! It's now sittinng in the drive purring away
raedy to slide out into the winter wilderness (Leicester may sound industrial
heartland but not where I live)...and today is Cee's birthday and all them
years ago she was born in a blizzard..all i need was a '53 bus for the journey
but we'll settle for a cuddle in the '67 a good year (I think, I can't
remember)...well more like the kids shouting about the cold in the back!!
happy Daze      Dave :) :)
