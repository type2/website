Subject: Calif. Emissions Testing

Hi all:

Can anyone tell me how old a vehicle in California has to be in order to
be exempt from auto emission testing.  I've been told &quot;20 years old&quot; and
I've also been told &quot;1966 and newer&quot; are tested.  Does anybody know for
sure?  Has this changed recently?

Thank You Very Much

Todd Francis
