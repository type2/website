Subject: Re: Stock Alloy wheels ????

&gt; 	What year or model Vanagon came with the 15&quot; alloy wheels????

An easy one!  NONE.

My 15&quot; alloys are probably Audi 5000 Turbo wheels -- the only 15&quot; alloys
with VW markings that I know of.  There is a steel 15&quot; wheel also for
Audi that fits (it even has the same part number as the alloys).  The
Audi wheels need some machining to fit.
