Hello, 
	This is my first posting to this mailing list.  I am currently 
looking for a late model Wasserboxer with a Westphalia package to add to 
my VW collection of a Cabriolet, Thing and '57 split.  My dream car 
unlike the Ferrari or another exotic is a '91 Westphalia.  I don't know 
why...I've always been a little odd.  Though, after reading the 
postings, I would probably go the extra 3 grand to get a syncro.  I am 
writing as a plea to anyone who knows of a late-model camper available 
in the D.C., Maryland, PA area.  I used to have a '73 T2 in college (I 
rebuilt the beast into a beauty) but it was totalled in a 
hit-and-run...I still cry about that.
	I would appreciate any info. that anyone has.
	Sorry, I can't help on the coffee conundrum.  I quit 3 years 
ago, I couldn't deal with the muscle spasms any more, and de-caf is like 
making love in a canoe.
		Cheers, 
			Gary
