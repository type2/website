Therein lies the problem.  I like this list because the signal to noise 
ratio is very high, rec.autos.vw had a significantly lower value.
Besides Vanagon is just the name of the list not totaly descriptive of 
the content. Many of us have loafs of varying years and configurations 
therefore requiring 2 or even 3 newsgroups to cover the same content.

This is true!
