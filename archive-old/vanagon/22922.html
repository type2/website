Subject: More '62 Kombi window stuff

OK I think I might be missing a piece of my window or
door frame.  The local WCM supplier told me there
is supposed to be a metal strip inside the door, attached
to the window frame, that the oft-mentioned notched
metal piece (the window latch catches in here) screws
to.  Hmm.  Lee you were right.  I'll get back on the PO 
to see if this part too is lying in his garage.  

If folks with splitwindowvans want to look at their
front door window setup and tell me what the notched
strip screws to and how big it is and what shape, I'd
appreciate it.  I want to get this bus on the ROAD!!!
