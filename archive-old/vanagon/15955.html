Subject: Head Help!

Sorry for rehashing, but, I need help!  Where do I order a cylinder head 
from?  Do I get new or remanufactured?  The dealer quotes $400 for 
remanufactured.  I've looked through the Whitney catalog and can't find 
anything for my 1985 Vangon (1.9L).
Money is my main concern, having a running vehicle a year from now, is my 
secondary concern.  I indeed am paying someone to do the repair (hang 
head in shame) and have $200 in labor already.
Should I have the other head taken off too?  He didn't remove the motor, 
he is doing it inside.  While it isn't currently leaking, there does 
appear to be some old residue.  What to do?  Help!

1.  Where to order heads from.
2.  New or remanufactured.
3.  To do the othere head, or not to do, that is the last question.

thanks much,
chuck
