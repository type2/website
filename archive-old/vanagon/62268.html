Subject: RE: '86 still plagued! (was rich running)

With the black plugs and smoking.... your checks don't seem to list the O2 
sensor - had same symptoms when my first O2 sensor went bad - when I unplugged 
the sensor (single wire) it ran much better until I could replace it. Also 
check the throttle switch that tells the ECU to idle or not.

Hi Volks,

Yep, the dreaded rich running '86 is still pissed :-(  Still starting hard,
won't take gas for about 15-20 secs after it starts, smokes a bit, gets bad
mileage, poor power, plugs black.

I've followed everybody's suggestions, scoured the archives and tracked Dan
Houg's footsteps, all to no avail. Here's everything I've done:

1) checked and cleaned all the grounds
2) checked the temp sensor (swapped with new to make sure)
3) checked and cleaned the AFM (swapped with new to make sure)
4) checked the ECU (swapped with new to make sure)
5) checked all FI wiring
6) checked for vacuum leaks
7) checked fuel pressure

I'll be checking engine compression next to make sure. I may have forgot to
list something ot another.

Does anyone have any other suggestions at all??

I am just about to give up on this van. And to think I sold my trusty 83.5
to &quot;upgrade&quot; to this!!!!

I hate to say this on the H2O list, but it makes me appreciate my '71
rustfalia. Even with a leaky and dirty carb and many years of neglect
continues to run...

Sorry for whining :-(

If VW still offered a new van, I'd be at the bank right now!
