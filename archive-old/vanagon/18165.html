So Paul Uusitalo says:
&gt; (all sorts of useless gunk expurgated)
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;beer, wine, or other &quot;substance&quot; of your choice
&gt; 
&gt; Martha:
&gt; 
&gt; You must have been trying to play some sort of cruel yet subtle joke here.
&gt; For the sake of those on their way to Bodega, I must point out that you put
&gt; the items of highest priority last on the list.
&gt; 
&gt; I just hope it's not too late for people to re-pack!!

Nah.....  We always take Martha's lists and just reverse it.  We know 
where our priorities lie.  ;)
