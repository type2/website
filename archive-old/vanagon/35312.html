Subject:  speedometer fixin'

** Reply Requested When Convenient **

Hey all

I think my weekend project this weekend is going to be to fix the
speedometer.  I will need help from you folks, tho.  Here's what I know
so far.  The speedometer does not function.  It does not register any
speed.  Also, odometer doesn't work (duh).  Anyway, I popped of the
left front hubcap to see if the cable end had worked itself out of the little
hole in the grease cap.  Well, it was still there, held in by the little circlip
and all.  So that part of it is turning.  This leads me to believe that the
problem is either with the cable or the speedometer itself.  First think I
want to check is the cable.  Sooo, how do I ge the sucker out?  I don't
want to guess at it, so I'd like it if someone could help me with that part of
things.  Also assuming the cable is in more than one piece, where can I
get a new one?  VW dealer?  Elsewhere?  OK, assume cable is OK, I put
it back in with new grease.  What kind of grease?  

If the speedometer is broken I guess I'm gonna be out some cash any
way I look at it.  Anyway, if anybody can help me out with this I'd really
appreciate it.  

Thanks a lot in advance,
Sean
