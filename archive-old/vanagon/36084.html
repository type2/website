Subject: How Tall is a Westy and '64 single cab progress

                
        Well, I got to see how tall a Westy is myself for once, as I watched
S Johnson back his vanagon into his not-quite-all-the-way-open garage door!

        We put the new door on his single cab, piece of cake, since he
followed my advice of liquid-wrenching the heck out of it!  Learned him some
new stuff about bus construction while I was at it!  He then helped me bleed
the brakes on the '56 and distribute brake fluid all over Johnson's half
acre, and I bailed home.

        Then the famous Matt and Joel were scheduled to arrive in an hour or
so.  On the way home from Steve's house, I stopped off at a defunct nursery
and rescued 2 eucalyptus and a birch tree.  When I got home, Steve called to
say M &amp; J were at his place and on the way over.  Knowing how quickly Steve
operates, I was able to get all three trees planted before they arrived!

        They showed up, I gave them the tour of the '56 and '54, and then we
went, had lunch, discussing the various flavors of beaver and beer.  Went
back to my house to try and make some calls to find a Westy for Matt.  They
then left and went in search of a Magic Ad or some similar publication to
try and find more busses to buy.

        All in all it was a fun day.  After they left, I took a nap, and
still have not got the new battery put in my bus nor the tranny fluid
checked/topped up.
