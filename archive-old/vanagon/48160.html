Subject: EV Storage Containers


I'm breaking one of my cardinal rules....going to Cape Cod (with the rest of 
the touristes) on a weekend during the summer....but what do you expect from 
someone who every once in a while gets the urge to trade my beloved EV in 
for something different...

Anyway, to the point. As I was shopping for food, etc. for the expidition I 
came across a couple of &quot;Jumbo Utility Containers&quot; Size 24&quot; x 14&quot; x 11&quot; made 
by Tambor Plastic Corp. for $9.99 (at Stop &amp; Shop). After doing a quick 
eye-ball of the boxes it looked like they would fit nicely under the luggage 
platform behind the rear seat in the EV/MV.

When I got home, I undid them from the plastic wrap, and sure as hell they 
fit. Not only did they fit, but I swear that who ever set the dimensions 
ownes an MV!!! The two fit side by side with 1/2&quot; clearance between them, 
and slide directly up to the base of the rear seat leaving about 3&quot; between 
the back of the box and the rear hatch.

Talk about $hit luck!

So now one holds a camp stove as well as the pots, pans, etc., the other 
holds a two day (or more) supply of food.

I went back and got another set of boxes which will fit under the rear 
seat...which has 8&quot; clearance...


All the boxes have snap on lids...(How many joints in a lid?...oops that was 
the &quot;Let's Make a Dope Deal&quot; skit from Cheech &amp; Chong...I digress or is it I 
flashback...)


Well, got to get back out and start packing up the EV...and a campin' we 
will go....
