Subject: Transaxle Numbers  Was: Wear Index


I was wondering if anyone can tell me where to look for the numbers on my 
transaxle.  The vehicle is a '68 Westy but the previous owner said the 
tranny is not a '68.  Once I find the numbers, where can I look for the 
year?  The books that I have include chassis and engine numbers but not 
tranny numbers.
                               TIA

                                 Martin
