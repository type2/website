Sorry, but this song has been in my head for well over a week, and its time 
to get it out!  It goes to the tune of that ridiculous song about leaving
a cake in the rain, blah blah blah.

{
Someone left the bus out - in the rain,
and I don't think I can take it,
cause the seals they didn't make it,
and I don't wanna clean that mess up, again!!!!!! 

Oh no!!!!!
}
