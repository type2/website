&gt;I used it full-strength on engine tin and the gas tank cover 
&gt;recently -- did a pretty good job. I've also filled a tub with
&gt;warm water and a couple of handfuls of TSP (tri-sodium-phosphate)
&gt;and soaking the smaller pieces in that.

I use biodegradeable, non-phosphate degreasers on my cars too.  You got to
work a little harder, but it gets your job nice and clean.  Get a stiff
brush, some eye goggles, and coveralls if your work is still on the van.  A
toothbrush helps in the knooks and crannys.  If it is really bad, I use a
generic brand of automatic dishwasher detergent (contains phosphates,
cheap) to clean it up.  I clean my engine case-halves this way.
