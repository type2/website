     Hi Bill,
     
     I saw this posting a while back,
     
     &gt;I have already bored both lists with how great and relatively easy 
     &gt;this is.  Mine is an 81 Vanagon with a 77 2.7liter engine.  The only 
     &gt;specialized part I used was the flywheel.  Everything else you need 
     &gt;is either Porsche (e.g. oil tank), or homebrew (e.g. engine tin).  If 
     &gt;you have specific questions, let me know, and help me guess whether 
     &gt;the answers will be of interest to the 'philes and/or Vanagon lists 
     &gt;at large.
     &gt;B.

     Where did you get the flywheel from, and how much etc.
     
     At the moment we are trying to convert a type I flywheel to bolt to 
     the porsche crankshaft by machining the boss on the flywheel to fit 
     over the porsche crankshaft and then by boring the bolt holes in the 
     type I flywheel to match the porsche setup.
     
     I wondered if the flywheel you used might be a cheaper way round.
     
     Lee.
