Subject:      Vanagon problems, almost solved

I have had the timing set correctly on the van, and the co mixture is set
right also. However the engine sounds like it is &quot;pinging&quot;, under load.
The
clutch feels a little stiff after it gets good and hot. Maybe the clutch
is
not fully engaging and causing the loss of power when the engine gets hot?
Any ideas on the clutch problem. Sometimes the clutch feels like it is not
releasing...Hmmmm??&gt;??
