Subject: Phase I Tools

Kids;
    Firstly, it would be keen for me to know who else on this list owns '71
Campers!! Next, (and more broadly-based) I'd like to find out how much ya
think the additional tools I need to buy for my Phase I Tool Kit (per
J.Muir's book) might run me!! I need a compression tester, a tach dwell
meter, a torque wrench and a set of bow end wrenches. Expensive?? Should I
look for the metering devices anywhere in particular?
    Lastly, I wanna learn the complete skill of VW mechanics. Don't wanna
waste my $$ at some generic tech school that just teaches you how to plug in
a diagnostics machine. Might any of you know of an instituion nearby that
might offer a more VW-related experience?? I'm in south-eastern Mass. New
Bedford.
You're good to me!!** Rachel
