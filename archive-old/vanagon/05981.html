Yep, that was my article about Wolfsburg....actually it was recycled
from here, VintagVW, r.a.vw, and LiMBO's Transporter...I get 
lots of mileage from my writing!!  ;-)


I will be doing some writing for them from time to time. Right now
I am working on an article on VW Restoration/Authenticity books.
