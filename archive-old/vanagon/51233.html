Subject: Battery Question


Just a quick question...

I have a deep cycle battery that i'm using as a second battery in my van.
To make a long story short, it ended up getting tipped over (not in the
van). What do I need to do in order to get it working again. It needs to
befilled with??? Would that be distilled water?

Please respond to me personally...not the list.

Thanks!
