Pop off your distributer cap and turn the crank until the rotor points to
the contact for the #1 plug wire. That will indicate TDC on #1. There's
usually a small notch (more like a nick) in the distributer body at the #1
position as well.

&gt;Ok, so I now know the correct cylinder #s:
&gt;3   1
&gt;4   2
&gt;
&gt;Aside from checking the distributor rotor, how does one check for TDC 
&gt;on #1, instead of #3, since both would give TDC on the crank, right? 
&gt;Do you have to remove a spark plug &amp; peer in, or is there a notch on 
&gt;one of the pulleys, or what?
