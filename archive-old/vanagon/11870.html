   Well, thanks to Mr. Rain, and Mr. Freezing Cold, I think all of us
managed to miss each other this weekend. My friend Sean (67 Westy) and I
got there around 3:00, and set up camp. We walked around for a bit, and
gradually began to wonder if no one else was going to show up. Right
before 6, the ranger asked us for money to stay, and as it was cold, and
wet, we decided to head for home. 
  Anyway,I awoke to more rain Saturday morning, and decided to go to work, and
head out in the afternoon. But then, around 3, Gary Clayton called from
the lake to ask where everyone was. As it was still nasty out, we
decided to forget the whole thing. So anyway, I guess when you look at
the percentage of us attending, vs. the percent of Californians
attending, we didn't do so bad.
  Of course, Sunday, it was sunny and in the 60's...oh well
So, anyone for Umstead park the first weekend of April?
Richard
