Subject: Temporary rust fix advice


&gt;   &gt; 1.  What type and grit of sandpaper will work best to clean up the 
&gt;   &gt; edges of the couple of holes and take off the larger areas
&gt;   &gt; of surface rust?
&gt;
&gt;   I would use something coarse, like 80 grit.  If you can get a power drill
				       ^^^^^^^^
&gt;   to it, I have found that those wire wheels work really well compared to
&gt;   sandpaper.


Oh No!!! grits again!!! :-)
