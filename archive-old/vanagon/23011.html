Bob, 
	If you see it, it is there.  So much heat is created by whatever 
compression ratios, cheap gas and too much advance.  Know these things and 
you you will understand.  The figures talk.  Right gas for your 
compression ratio and advance, for your distributor and elevation.  At 
least, in theory, this can be a start. Play and have fun.  People still 
do not beleive that I have to advance my timing to get heat in the 
winter.  Doesn't aid in starting!  Gary Gibson
