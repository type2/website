&gt;i might add my $0.02 (rapidly depreceating Canadian dollar) i think the
&gt;pans we are referring to are slightly different. Some 68-79 Kombi's and
&gt;Westy's had the belly pans that fit under the middle of the van to cover
&gt;the heater tube etc. whereas the splits had a pan that bolted underneath
&gt;the front pedals etc. to keep the cables free of road grime. do others know
&gt;more than i (entirely likely!!!!!!). Were there &quot;skid plates&quot; or whatever
&gt;you want to call them available on post 68' vans (i,e,the pan that bolts
&gt;underneath the the cab section's pedals and cables?
&gt;
&gt;Da belly-pan only covers the area underneath the driver's feet.
&gt;^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
My '73 Westy has a pan under the front to cover the pedal area, but nothing 
any further back, i.e. the middle of the bus.
