&gt;&gt;and a question for you---  why the 'Celtic' name?  just wondering 
&gt;&gt;because my wife plays in a Celtic band.

&gt;&gt;-dan

I was trying desperatly to find a &quot;unique&quot; user name while signing onto the 
Microsoft Network , BryanF, etc. all were taken, I tried Celtic, we have some 
nice Celtic music CD's, and that was taken, so I added B from Bryan at the end 
and that was it...

What band is your wife in?


Bryan
