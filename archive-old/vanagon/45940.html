Subject: Volkswagen Chronicle


I just came back from my local Barnes &amp; Noble and they have a book on sale 
called &quot;Volkswagen Chronicle&quot; by Graham Robson and the Auto Editors of 
Consumer Guide.

Not a bad book....has a 20 page chapter entitled &quot;A Van for the Uncommon 
Man&quot;...one of the better short pieces I've read on VW Vans in a while.

The nice thing about the book is that Classic Motorbooks was selling them 
for $19.95....B&amp;N had them for $14.95 (plus 5% sales tax here in 
Taxachusetts)....

Hurry down to your local B&amp;N...if they don't have a copy, maybe I could be 
&quot;convinced&quot; to get a few more copies...
