Ok, let's really open this can of worms.  I've yet to hear/see anything 
that totally disenchants me from the notion of hydrogen fuels, outside of 
the technological challenges, which as we all know are not 
insurmountable.  And like photovoltaics, once the market starts to 
recognize hydrogen as a viable alternative fuel, the price will drop to 
acceptable levels.

Then there's hemp, as an alternative fuel.  Does anyone know of research 
being done in this arena and/or emissions results?  Power output?  

What are others thoughts on these means of propelling us into the next 
century?

Jack
