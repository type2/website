Hello folks,

Here is the description of some troubles I've been having.

&gt; 
&gt; On Tue, 12 Apr 94 09:04:25 CDT Richard Eager said:
&gt; &gt;Jim &amp; Dean, I'm also very interrested in everyone's responses as I have a 1987
&gt; &gt;that exhibits a similar behavior (I think).  That is, when idling, the
&gt; &gt;RPMs will increase to about 2000 momentarily and then return to proper
&gt; &gt;idle speed.  Really weird the first time this happened while driving ...
&gt; &gt;I also have another problem that may or may not be related.  When I
&gt; &gt;first start the car in the morning, the idle is very rough and slow
&gt; &gt;(about 500 or so).  Sometimes the engine will stall, so I press the
&gt; &gt;accelerator slightly to keep the speed up. After a minute or two of
&gt; &gt;running, it's OK.  If it stalls though, it is very hard to restart and
&gt; &gt;sometimes there is the faint smell of gas.  Is it possible for it to be
&gt; &gt;choked too much ??!!
&gt; 

One other problem I didn't mention is that the car seemed sluggish and
hesitant after warm up.  Cold temperature performance was just fine.

Joel wrote the following in response:

&gt; Now THAT's the behavior of a bad temp coolant sensor! and if you drive off,
&gt; it will stall/die at stop signs and red lights. 

Today I'm THRILLED to report that I was able to replace the coolant temperature
sensor and that ALL of the above symptoms disappeared.  Starts right up and runs
right, no surging, no stalling and accelerates smoothly.  AND I got all this for
the $11.32 the dealer charged me for the sensor (and a $1.68 for the new o-ring
seal).

Joel, I would very much appreciate the microfiche for my '87.  Let me know how
we should work the details as I don't know your email address.

Again, many thanks to you all for your kind assistance.

Dick
