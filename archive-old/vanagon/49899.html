So DHaynes57_at_aol_dot_com says:
&gt;   &gt;&gt;
&gt; If you consider that it is now possible to spend $35K on a Caravan,  This
&gt; almost seems like a bargain!  Check with your tax man.  As an RV you can
&gt; probably write the loan off as a second home mortgage and you can probably
&gt; finance it for 10 years or more(YUK).  You can not do that with a Caravan!
&gt;  Still, I still like the Rialta for $43K.

This is true.  Linda and I did this until we got a real second home and
rented out the other.  You can take the tax credit if your vehicle (2nd
home) qualifies it as a second home.  That means it has a bed, toilet
and a sink.  I'm not sure if it needs a fridge or not.  Check with your
tax consultant.
