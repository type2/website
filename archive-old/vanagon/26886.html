John,

I had an '86 that had the inside of the catalytic converter disappear.  
The dealer swore that I must had done it to get better &quot;performance&quot;.
Where is their brain, I don't think I would have noticed that MASSIVE hp 
increase.  Anyway, in this part of FL we have emission inspections and I 
obviously could not pass without a new catalytic converter.  The dealer 
wanted near $900.00 for the part only!  I went down the street 1/2 mile 
to the Midas, they had one in stock.  I ran me $225 installed and I was 
outta there in about 2 hours. It has worked perfectly for about three 
years now.  I'm not complaining. 

Regarding your fuel tank implosions, my tank has, on an on and off basis, 
made a distinctive clunk.  Especially when near empty, it's like the 
whole thing is sucking in and then boom, it expands out.  But, I've never 
had it completely implode.

With all the similar problems posted on this list, it sure sounds to me 
like VW really screwed up on the fuel system design in the Vanagon.

&gt; Has anyone tried the franchise shops like Monroe, Midas, Speedy for Vanagon
&gt; exhaust work?  These shops say they have (most) the parts but I wonder if
&gt; the fit will be right and the quality any good.  My 1991 GL has 93K miles
&gt; on it and a small, growing hole in the muffler as well as a very rusty
&gt; converter and tail pipe.
&gt; 
&gt; Also, I'm considering (only considering) selling this well maintained, 4
&gt; spd, tornado red beauty as I get ready to send a second child to college.
&gt; I'm sure my priorities must be screwed up here.  Can I get an idea of what
&gt; a vehicle like this might sell for.
&gt; 
&gt; and
&gt; 
&gt; I'm curious.  I bought my first new GL in 1986 (an '86) and over the next
&gt; five years  I experienced 4 gas tank implosions. At 30k, 34k, 48k, and 55k
&gt; miles.  The thing just sucked inself flat as a pancake each time and left
&gt; my family stranded in various parts of the country.  VW offered no
&gt; explanation but did replace the tank each time.  Has this happened to
&gt; anyone else?
