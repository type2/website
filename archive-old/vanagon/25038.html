  I'd like to get the 'net opinion on the advantages of vinyl vs canvass
  sunroof covers.  I need to re-do mine purty soon.
  Here's what I have so far:
       Vinyl                   Canvass
  .........................
  Any others would be appreciated...

I'm sure you're asking for a replacement for your stock sunroof cover but
here's another option (assuming a stock look is of no importance).  I made
a &quot;custom&quot; cover for my '71 bus' sunroof since I had to yank the
mechanical junk and seals a long time ago (it's now a manual slide; works
but leaks like the Titanic).  I bought a piece of acrylic material from a
fabric store that is usually intended for sail and hatch covers on boats.
It's been exposed to the sun and elements for seven years and has never
faded, gotten moldy, stiffened up, and really never looks dirty (it's
bright electric blue).  The only drawback is that the material is not
completely waterproof but is close enough for my purposes.  Cost me about
$35 for the material, the screw-in snap sets, and the little snap tool.
Again, it is probably not what you're looking for but you did ask.....
