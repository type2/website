Subject: Request for consensus on Head Leaks

Lurking, listening, sometimes questioning, the consensus SEEMS to be

1. Try BarsLeaks first. If that doesn't work,

2. Try a very good cleaning plus epoxy and new gaskets ($250+). If that
doesn't work,

3. Try adding metal (TIG weld) and remachining down. ($?) If that doesn't work,

4.  Bite the bullet, get new heads and gaskets (~1000.)

Would you folks say this is accurate?
