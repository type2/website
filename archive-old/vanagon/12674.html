Subject: I need some help (over and above the obvious)


It appears that I have been a bit too outspoken for the Vintage VW list
manager during the past week, and I find myself dropped. I have tried
on numerous occasions to re-scubscribe...but have not received even
a reply from the listserv at sjsuvm1...In addition, I sent the list
manager John Sroka a letter for him to check if there was a &quot;mechanical&quot;
problem that caused me to be dropped from the list....as of today
I have not received a reply.

I am soliciting the help of the members of vanagon who also frequent
the Vintagvw list to get the word out that there is blatant censorship
going on on that list. Yes, I AM outspoken, but only on areas I strongly
believe in. The incident which seems to have gotten me in trouble had
to do with &quot;lurkers&quot; complaining about the amount of &quot;non-vw&quot; content
on the Vintag net...hell they ought to see what is going on on this
list 8-)

Anyway, I put forth the statement that the lurkers had no right
to complain, as they did very little to contribute to the list
in the first place, and if &quot;you don't contribute, don't bitch&quot;..

I guess my tone was a bit much for the listmanager, and so I
have been cut off...censored!

So, if you could, I would appreciate that this matter be brought
out to the Vintag list...I can't get through myself. 

The real tough issue, is not my &quot;conduct&quot;, but the censorship
of the list in general! Gerry...DON'T take a hint!! ;-)
