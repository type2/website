V&gt; I think they are worried that the fiberglass will crack and get sued,
hence
 &gt; my attitude.

You mean the same rack their catalog shows holding two canoes, a bike and
a piano on top of a Honda Accord?

I am only using the Yakima gutter mounts, the rest of the hardware is
Thule. But I do worry about the fiberglass...


================END QUOTATION==================

The max weight on a Yakima pop-top roof attachment for Vanagon Camper (not
the type which attaches to the rain gutter, but the type which bolts on to
the fiberglass roof) is so low you rally cannot attach anything to the roof
of the van except bicycles or popcorn because everything else is too heavy. 

The solution is to 1) ignore their weight limitations as being put there for
insurance reasons, 2) reinforce their basic bracket by adding some metal
under the pop top to distribute the load around better, or 3) add a 3rd or
4th cross bar. 

I do a little of #1 and a little of #2.

I do not have a listing of the weight limit with me now, so the 50 or 100 lbs
figure I quote above is from memory and might be wrong. Any Yakima dealer
should have the weight limitation printed in their fit list book.
