Subject: Refrigerator and alarm


I'm looking for a simple and inexpensive alarm for my '87 Westy. I've
found an audiovox that is triggered by either shock or a voltage
fluctuation. It's only two wires to install. I'm wondering if the
refrigerator is going to be a problem though. I want to use the alarm
when we're off day hiking or shopping etc. and I normally leave the
refrigerator running on gas. Does anyone know if the refrigerator uses
any electric when it's running off the lp? I didn't think that it did
but when I listen closely it sounds like there might be a whirring
sound of some kind.

Thanks much!
