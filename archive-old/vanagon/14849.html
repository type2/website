&gt;  My gas mileage has hit an all-time low of 14 mpg. I have a 72' 1700
&gt; and I'm at my wits end as to how to get more miles for the buck. I've
&gt; changed the ignition system completely (i.e. brand new), I've checked
&gt; the compression and its A-OK and I've changed the cut-off jets in the
&gt; carburator. All of these things were done on the advice of
&gt; mechanics... What I have not yet attempted is a carb equalization. I
&gt; didn't think it needed one because the engine runs like a Swiss
&gt; timepiece. Any suggestions? Is the &quot;volume control&quot; screw really just 
&gt; an idle mixture screw? If not, then is there a volume control screw on
&gt; the passenger's side carb? AAArgh, I hate not being able to drive my VW...

There are idle mixture screws on both carbs.  Have you checked to make
sure you have the correct jets?
