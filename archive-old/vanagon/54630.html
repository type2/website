Thanks for the support...

I'll do something.  I need to figure out if the problem is a blown
head or the whole engine.  If it's the heads, I'll replace it (myself).
If it's the whole engine, I'll look at engine swap options, including
a subaru engine and an electric conversion (my initial estimates show
a realistic, i.e., something that is remotely driveable, hybrid
electric conversion to be around 5-6K USD).

But that's gonna be at a time when the weather is warm enough to hold
the engine block without your hand freezing to it...
