I'm still not too old to &quot;genuflect, genuflect, genuflect...&quot;  and hey, my 16
yr old made me write down all the verses to &quot;Wet Dream&quot; so she could quote
lines like &quot;not tonight, I've got a haddock&quot; and &quot;you have to yell, Gill's a
little hard of herring&quot;...  soforth.
