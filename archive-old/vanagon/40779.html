&gt;What's the difference?  I read this somewhere before (in a Bosch FI

The FI system in your bus is Bosch L-Jetronic.  The L is short for the 
German word luft, which means air.  In this system the amount of fuel 
injected is based on how much _air_ enters the intake.  This system also 
goes by the moniker AFC for Air-Flow Control.

The Bosch K-Jetronic is the first Continuous Injection System (CIS). 
I think it was used on water-cooled Rabbit/Golf VWs.  The K is short for 
the German word for continuous (Kontinuerlich).  It's mostly a mechanical 
system in the early versions.

Over the years, both systems were refined by the addition of an oxygen sensor 
to attain a more precise air/fuel mixture.  This is named Lambda control.
