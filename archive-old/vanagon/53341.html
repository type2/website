Richard,

There is a big mistake in your mail according to the serial number:

KBA-ABE 95.004.   means:

KBA   Kraftfahrtbundesamt           Department for vehicle approvals
                                    in Germany
ABE   Allgemeine Betriebserlaubnis  This allows you to use this
                                    equipment on German cars without
                                    additional approvals at TUV
95.   Year or approval
004   running number

The price will be in the range of DM 300.00 to DM 400.00 in Germany.

Fred Porter asked...

&gt; What aftermarket cruise control systems have you
&gt; installed in your vanagons?

I've got an aftermarket VDO unit in my '86 Westy.  No complaints so
far: it's responsive &amp; easy to use.  The amplifier is hidden away
behind the glove box and the control box (2''x1.5''x1'') sits right
next to the instrument pod.

The only problem to date has been the foot switch on the clutch
pedal wearing out (it's in a rubber blister screwed directly to the
pedal rubber) - I replaced it with a microswitch glued directly to
the pedal lever.

The model is VDO Tempostat, serial number KBA-ABE 95.004.  No idea
about price, sorry.

Regards,

Rich Lumb
