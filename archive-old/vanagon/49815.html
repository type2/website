So Turbo says:
&gt; 
&gt; Not content to rest on my laurels after putting up the wiring diagrams (Take
&gt; a bow, Mr Bryant) I wanted to go one step further: I want to create a VW Bus
&gt; FAQ.

Hmmmm... There is an Air-Cooled VW FAQ that tends to include alot of 
bus information.  I currently maintain it.  Do you want to take it over
Tom?  You'll need to send it out to the newsgroup too.
