&gt;Its payback time. After getting so much help from everyone, and realizing
how
&gt;much dosh I've saved for so many things I didn't go to the dealer for, I'm
happy
&gt;to say I have a little something to share back.

I, too, got a lot of info from the list, thanks.

Here is what I came up with.

Optima Deep Cycle Battery (not gel, new spiral wound technology)
52 amp hours
700 or 750 cranking amps
Sealed -- no gases
Can be charged harder than gels without risk of frying
Also expensive ($160-$180)

Fits under seat but is a little too tall -- however comes with side and top
terminals, so I am going to use the side terms and drill holes in the black
access cover (and carpet) for the top terminals -- the access cover then
closes.  Top terminals come with plastic caps and will stick up through the
carpet (but not so high that the driver's seat won't swivel).  They will be
out of harms way when driving, and if I need to jump-start someone I can just
slide the seat forward a bit and take off the plastic caps.

People I have talked with think that this new technology is hot, so I guess
I'll find out.

I could drum up the spec's if anyone's interested.

BTW, I am using a A/B/Both switch instead of making the relay vs isolator
decision and wiring in an on-board charger that will charge both batteries
when the van is plugged in.
