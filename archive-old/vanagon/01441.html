Subject: Re:Unique Camper types

I used to have the interior/ pop-top from a 1967 euro version bus, all Westfalia
stuff, recognizably so, colours, fabrics, fit, finish and plaque, which I 
fitted into a '78 seven seater. It was a vertical pop-top also, but standing
room only!  Spring loaded, it would raise itself when unclipped. About 4' x 
4' inside, no  hammock but 3 zippered/screened windows. A fairly rounded 
design, in the dead centre of the van, no molded luggage rack. The 
installation was a cinch, and once you sink a jigsaw into a perfectly good 
roof there's no turning back anyhow!

 Interior was a full-width fold-out double bed, no tire lump! The closet was 
behind the drivers seat, about twice as wide as usual. Didn't obstruct the 
view at all. The 'kitchen' unit was one piece, almost full-width, next to 
the closet. All stainless steel top, incl. 2 burner stove and sink under a 
folddown lid. No icebox, just lots of storage in the 3 kitchen cupboards. I 
carried a 20lb. propane bottle, 5gal H2O and 2gal waste tanks and still had 
lots of room.
 The van this stuff came out of was a 3 seater front bench type, spare tire 
under the centre of the bench, and a solid waist high bulkhead across the 
seatback, thus being one of VWs delivery models, with windows.

 This was a great setup, except it was hard/impossible  to climb into the back.
Not good for sneaky camping in downtown Boston etc. No icebox wasn't a 
problem, a small cooler between the 2 front seats of the '78 worked 
perfectly, fresh ice/food during the day, eat/drink everything by bedtime 
then start again the next day. These people complaining about awkward 
dangerous high consumption propane/electric fridges take note...!
 I've spent extended time in almost all models of factory Westys, except a 
Eurovan, and this was my favorite layout. It was a bit cramped with the 
table up, but buying a Westy side tent made life extremely comfortable, 
almost civilized. Incidently, the old side tents fit on a Vanagon, I've 
still got the side tent, sold the '78+'67 Westy a while back.

  Just a bit of wistful useless nostalgia, as I contemplate my exhaustless 
Vanagon (yet again). It's also 'marking its spot' right now, one little 
green drop at a time.........      tjs 

(if anyone has a similiar oldstyle Westy that they're parting out keep me in 
mind?)
