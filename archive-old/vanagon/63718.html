Hi All,

Local mechanic has done 7 vans/14 heads this way. one has gone 6
years/75K miles without releaking.  No call backs on any, except for
very first one which he crushed the gasket on.  Epoxy being a known
anti-corrosion coating this is hardly a surprising result.

Dan mentioned one leak, for 2 days in mid winter.  this is due to the
engine design, not JBWeld.  In cold weather the higher contraction of
the outer aluminium water jackets reduces the preload on that fat head
gasket.  The rubber, being cold and stiff, doesn't expand and keep the
head sealed.  That the leak (drip I suspects) closed off by itself is
not surprising.

Go for it folks, convert a few pennies of JBWeld into renewed $550 VW
heads. Takes a weekend to do this job BTW, mostly in the cure time of
the epoxy, and silicone sealer, you must use.

bye, Tim
