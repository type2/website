Subject: Re: '81 Westy Deep-cycle/group 41 combo Q's

Hello.

 First off I want to thank everyone who took the time to advise me on
this issue. All of the advice that I recieved was enlightening and
helpful and allowed me to reach this course of action: 
 I will remove the lousy dual battery isolator and feed it to my
parent's Chocolate Labrador Retriever who has (in her short doggy
existence) aquired a taste for electronic devices by chewing up no less
than 5 TV and VCR remote controls! (Now to change the channel they have
to pull on her tail!)

 Having done that, I will install the big fat relay in it's place, so
that I can manually isolate the deep-cycle battery when required. 

 Thank you again,

Noel Leavitt
