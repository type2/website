Subject: HELLPPPP, Bus A/C belt.

Well after getting the '78 home I start looking her over
I mean, what did I expect for under $400 and one question
was, what happened to the A/C.  The answer easily enough
is, uh, old belt shredded to little bits, but compressor
still turns with clutch engaged, a good sign.  But now
1. What size is/was the belt 2. HOW IN THE !_at_$#!_at_ DO YOU
GET IT ON/OFF.  If you have not seen a Type 4 with dealer
installed VW air, the York style compressor mounts on the
left side of the engine compartment and St. Muir himself
don't know where that belt goes.  It does not run off the tip
of the crank end where the cooling fan/alternator drive is but
instead dissapears somewhere on the other (toward the
front of the car) side of the aluminum fan shroud casting.
Frankly I don't see how it is possible to change without
unbolting the fan shroud from the engine as it has to get
around the crank (and its hypothetical pulley) somehow. So
I ask, can this even be done with the engine in the vehicle?
can one pull the shroud? do you have to remove the fan to
pull the shroud? has anyone ever seen this done or done it?
A quick system pressure check looks good and I got a 15lb
can of R12 I &quot;found&quot; a few years back so I figure she will
work if I can get a belt on it, whether the old 2.0 has the
guts to run it or not is yet to be seen, the system on mom
and dad's '77 does a bang up job for the front passengers
and is quite useable without a great amount of drag, but the
'78 has had more miles and a harder life.  Shit, this job looks
like an incredible labor money maker, I'm betting like
2-3 hours at a dealer, I see why the PO just let the air go.

Any thoughts, suggestions, or solutions appreciated.
