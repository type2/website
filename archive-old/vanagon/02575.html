Ken,
Check out my post on The Bus Stop catalog.  Toll-Free catalog request number 
is
1.800.544.1066.  This was the only catalog I had with me at the time so it 
is just one
example.  You probably ought to get a copy of Hot VWs or VW Trends and check
out some of the advertisements in their.  There seems to be quite a few 
companies
selling seat covers these days.
