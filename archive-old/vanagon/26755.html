Subject: I need a heater guru


	I remember reading something someone wrote
that pretty much was the definative work on the BA6.
 
	I am trying, again, to make mine go for the winter
here, and will be *building* a few of the duct parts.  I have
some questions about the non-return flaps that I can't figure out
by looking at the serive manual Joel sent me, and I don't have
another bus to reverse engineer them off of.

	so, if anyone is feeling very kind, and is somewhat moderately
familar with the ducting/ and or wiring of the wonderful BA6 underbelly bomb,
I'd pay good money to talk to them (if I had any).

	I'll make sure to videotape the first time I try firing this
thing up
