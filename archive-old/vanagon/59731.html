&lt;&lt; I'll be replacing the exhaust components on my syncro in the next year or
 so, from the heads to the muffler. Bentley doesn't show it, but I've heard
 that the crossover pipe is specific to the syncro and very difficult to
 locate. Can one of you syncro owners confirm/deny this? Also, can you
 suggest sources for these exhaust parts other than VWoA? Thanks... &gt;&gt;

I just replaced that pipe on my '87 last year.  It IS a specific pipe and the
only place in the Mpls/St Paul area I could find it was VW.  It was $252
(thank goodnes for the 15% VW Club discount!).  What Bently also doesn't tell
you is that you have to drop the skid plates to get the old pipe off and the
new one on.  Found that one out the hard way.
