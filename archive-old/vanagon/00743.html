Subject: '73 Bus parts for sale


A friend recently had a collision with his '73 Bus. Its probably not worth 
reparing 
the body/frame damage, so he's wondering if there is a market for the good 
(undamaged) 
parts.  The engine and *auto* (yes, automatic) transmission were both 
recently rebuilt, 
and are running great. The rest is, well. ., 20 years old, but intact, 
except of course 
for the collision damage. The car is located in San Diego.

Is this of any interest to anyone?

You can contact him at rush_at_netcom_dot_com, or on this group (But he does not 
know about
this list yet; I'll tell him tonight.)

Thanks,
Bob
