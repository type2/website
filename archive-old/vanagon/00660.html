Subject: Re: Free Vanagon Parts Catalogue

I got one of the West Coast Metric catalogs and indeed it does have tons of
Vanagon stuff. I thought for a moment of ordering the front door window
rubber from them but the prices seemed to be similar to what a VW dealer
would charge. This made me think that for these particular parts they are
just selling VW parts.

I bought a tail light for my 72 bus a few years back and I remember feeling
at the time that it did not fit as well as the factory part.

If I want to order from a dealer, and I don't care how long it takes, I
should order from the cheapest dealer in the US who sells by mail order. Any
candidates folks? 

I always hear from Joel that his Atlanta guy sells cheap. Do we have a
consensus on a good all around source of factory parts people? I notice the
ad (is it Hoey?) in European Car magazine and from a few other VW deaelers.
