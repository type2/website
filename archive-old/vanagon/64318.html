Subject:      EVers raid BR31!

Hi, all

Just had to put in a quick report that fellow listmember
Ken &amp; Charlotte Miller, and their 2.5 yr old son Patrick,
met us for ice cream at the above establishment.
A great time was had by all, and their pristine, alpine
(arctic?) white '93 EV MV would be the envy of many of us.

We were discussing some shared interests, and here's what
emerged:

With the exception of color, I think we both have the same
EV; 5spd, power package, ABS, non-weekender, etc.

We live about 2 miles away from each other

We met &amp; married SOs from school (both grads of same school,
SJSU &amp; UCD)

We have garages full of bikes, including tandems

Patrick is less than two weeks older than my youngest, Justin

We do our bike shopping at the same shop, Slough's

We do our EV maintenence with the same folks, Sunnyvale VW
and New Dimensions

We're both two VW families (Fox &amp; EV, Jetta &amp; EV)

And we didn't even talk shop!  Ken commented that VW must
not have been paying close enough attention to its EV
owner demographics...

I'd be willing to bet that the Vanagon list is chock full
of good people with more than a shared interest in their
four-wheeled rides...

Happy Friday!
Norman
