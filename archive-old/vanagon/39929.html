Subject: Fuel circuit for a 77

I'm putting the fuel injection back into my 77, and I'm scoping out how much
fuel line (and clamps) I'll need. I wanted to check with the experts that
I've got the right fuel 'circuit' ; that is, I've got all the connections in
the correct order. I only have a Bentley manual to go by, and it isn't too
clear as to the complete fuel flow connections. I was hoping someone could
look at what I've deduced the circuit to be, so I can start ripping stuff
out and putting stuff in.

FROM            TO
----            --
tank            filter
filter          T (i have a gas heater)
T               fuel pump
pump            Left fuel 'ring'
left ring       #3 injector
left ring       #4 injector
left ring       cold start injector
cold start      right ring
right ring      #2 injector
right ring      #1 injector
right ring      pressure regulator
pressure reg    tank

Does this look right? 

I figure I'll need about 12 feet (conservatively??) of hose, and 24 hose clamps.

Thanks in advance.


Dave.
