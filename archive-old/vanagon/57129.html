Subject: Re: Gasoline Grade?

Gasoline grades also vary among brands and with elevation.

In my '91 Westy, standard trans, I averaged 20-22 mpg on 87 octane. While
out west this summer in dry, higher elevation areas, I found that 'regular
unleaded' was only 85 octane. Being VERY CAREFUL not to purchase any gas
that was &quot;blended&quot;, as many of the midrange octanes were, I found that I 
actually got 22-25 mpg on the 85 octane! And the engine purred. On the way
back east, you could see the octane of the &quot;regular unleaded&quot; go up as you 
lost elevation.

I ran &quot;regular unleaded&quot; no matter what the octane on the entire 8500 mi trip
with absolutely no problem. I plan to do the same in my &quot;new&quot; '91 Westy when
I get her.
