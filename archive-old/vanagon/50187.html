In a message dated 96-10-07 14:51:03 EDT, you write:

&lt;&lt; After shifing into 4th it began making a fairly loud whinning sound, much 
 like all terrain tires make at high speed, only I'm pretty sure it was 
 coming from the transmission. The pitch varied with the speed &gt;&gt;

Mike....what tune was it humming?????????????

Actually, dont believe them.It either has a bad pinion bearing or worn ring
and pinion gear set in the front or rear diff.It doesnt sound good....maybe
it is humming the blues......
