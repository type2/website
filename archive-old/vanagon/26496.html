Subject: RE: Replacing rubber filler neck on '77

Bradley

I replaced a filler neck hose on my '71 Westy when I had my tank 
out for repair (leak). The local VW dealer couldn't order one so I went to a 
local hose supply house and got a length of 2.25 inch fuel filler hose. It 
had thicker walls and was not cloth covered like the original but worked 
great and should last another 25 years. Getting to it involved pulling the 
engine, cover plate (behind fan shroud), loosening the clamp at the tank, 
taking out 3 screws at the filler neck and voila out it comes. While I had it 
all apart I replace the vent line tubing as well. Only want to do this once.
