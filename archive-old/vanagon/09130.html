Subject:       Catching the Bus

G'day people,

Just taking the opportunity to introduce myself.

My name is dave Barker and I live in Bathurst, Australia.

I been lurking for a bit until my deal to buy two busses was 
finalised. Now that I have them I can speak.

I caught the 'bug' in Jan 94 when I bought a '66 beetle that is now 
undergoing a restoration. 

I have now caught the 'bus' since I bought two busses.

The first is a '74 bus with no engine, but the deal included two 
spare VW engines. ( A 1500 and a 1735 big bore kit engine). Along 
with assorted bits and pieces this cost me $500. It does need work 
but  I dont mind.

The other bus is a '54 camper. This currently has 1600 'worked' motor 
in it but is not part of the deal. The '54 camper without engine is 
going to be about $300.

All I have to do now is buy a car carrier so that I can get them 
since they are about 50kms from town.

Anyway...thats my introduction. Looks like I will be needing help as 
soon as I get to working on the busses.
