Hey listies!

        Just to let you know, a buddy of mine re upholstered his 81 westy
with materials from Sewfine (you can usually find their ads in VWTrends or
HotVWs).  When he got in touch with them, they didn't have patterns for
everything, such as the captains chir front seats, so he sent them his seat.
Now they have a pattern to make replacement seat covers.  As for the back,
if they don't have a pattern, they can at least send you matching material,
although I don't know if they can match the corduroy that you have now.  My
friend redid everything, and changed the color, so he didn't have to try
matching the original (brown with multicolored hash marks) fabric.  It
really looks sharp now.

        Hope this starts you in the right direction!!!
