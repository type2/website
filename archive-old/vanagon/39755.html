Subject: In Sunny California :)

After a mad trip down I- 5  (more about that later) I am now in the SF area.
 Well, I have to go change the gear oil in April, the 66 standard microbus,
as it doesn't sound too good.     It has only been on the road since January,
and is still getting used to it.  This is her first big trip, and im very
happy.  I'll only be in the area a couple days, then back up to lush Oly.
 Anyone going to the meet tommorrow at Kelly Park in SanJose?
