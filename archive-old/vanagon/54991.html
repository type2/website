Subject: Re: Round silver thing under clock?

Ron,

I just checked out your excellent web site.  Thanks for this valuable 
service.  I was especially interested in the first part about aux. 
battery installment.  Is this site still under construction?  I tryed to 
print it out and it would only print the first page, or is it just my 
computer that is having a hard time? 

Thanks,

Charles

&gt; &gt;&gt;This may seem dumb, but ever since I've had my Vanagon I've wondered what 
&gt; &gt;&gt;that round silver thing under the clock, that looks like a cigarette 
&gt; &gt;&gt;lighter is.  I've looked through the books and nothing is mentioned.  
&gt; &gt;&gt;Could someone shed some light on the thing.   Thanks,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;This is definitely one for the FAQ.
&gt; 
&gt; I've added a section on the silver socket.  See the faq at
