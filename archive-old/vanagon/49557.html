So Stephen Bibler says:
&gt; 
&gt; My wife and I may be moving from Florida to California, driving a 90 =
&gt; Vanagon. This van was orginally sold new in South Carolina. What would =
&gt; have to be done to meet California emission laws? The engine has had no =
&gt; modifications that I am aware of.

Before you do anything else (except maybe go to the bathroom if you have too!) ;)
Check to see if your van has the California Emission control sticker already.
That way, you may not have to do anything special.
