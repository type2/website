Ron Lussier, American Icon, proclaimed:
 
&gt; &gt;Rusty Apologizes if the reply was perceived as being malicious or mean
&gt; &gt;spirited.

No problem...understood.

 
&gt; Whoo.  Thanks for this.  As a newbie, I don't really have much of a say in
&gt; the direction of the list, but I like to hope it's a freindly place.  Your
&gt; comments show that it is.  Thanks again.
&gt; 
&gt; (The original post *was* silly.  Part of me suspects it was a troll.)
 
I don't know if i'd say 'troll'...not really sure what that means.  I guess
I did kinda mean it to be silly...but at the same time, I thought it would
generate some interesting response...I do lock her, it's just that I hate
having to.  I thought that, overwhelmingly, the responses have been friendly.
I'm actually pretty conservative, but I really enjoy playing the irresponsible
, flowery bus-driving hippie-type up as much as I can. (You'd probably know 
what I mean if you saw my Matilda.) 
Speaking of which, how many people have done unorthodox things to their 
busses?  (i.e; painting, attachments, etc...)?

Good to see that Rusty was good enough
to go out of his way to make sure that there was no misunderstanding.
I really appreciate that.	
I'm not surprised, though...as it just serves to underscore my original 
claim that microbi inspire harmony and peace among mankind. ;)
