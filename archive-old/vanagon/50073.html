Donald,

I have an 84 Vanagon GL with a Mazda bumper in the rear.  The PO was retired
from the auto &quot;junk yard&quot; business and had bought the vanagon totaled and
rebuilt it for his daughter and son-in-law.  I'll have to take a photo and
post. It is a bit of a curiosity.  Karen named the Vanagon Ma-Van.  I do
wonder what other hybrid parts I'll find.

As for Camelback VW, I was excited when I found they offered an Internet
discount, then discouraged when quoted prices...

rod bearings $5.60 ea. half piece (2 per rod)
distributor drive gear $39.60
camshaft $231.69
muffler clamp $38.03
muffler $223.80
brake shoes $61.88

&gt;A leaking rear heater core has caused me to investigate parts sources other
&gt;than local Atlanta dealers and local FLAPS.  I assumed that the rear heater
&gt;valve was the culprit and ordered a new one from Camelback VW in
&gt;Phoenix--total...
&gt;
&gt;I also ordered a new bumber from Volks Motor Sports for $135... New bumpers
cost $395 from the dealer.
&gt;Looking forward to having a pristine rear bumper on my van.
