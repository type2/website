Subject: carbs &amp; elec. ig

I have been thionking about upgrading my stock 1600DP by adding an after 
market carb (weber, etc) and electronic ignition system.  I would like to 
hear the opinions of people have have done this.  Specifically about 
improvements in the engine (or lack of), specific brands used, gas 
mileage improvements, maintenance problems (or lack of), and anything 
else that you think might help. 
TIA
