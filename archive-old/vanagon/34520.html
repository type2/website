Subject: Re: How prevent cancer (rust) in Northlands?

&gt;I'm interested in a syncro for a daily driver. I live in Cancer central and
&gt;I don't want my (future) treasured bus to disintegrate.
&gt;
&gt;I'm betting that if I bring a bus up here from the Southwest, South or So
&gt;Cal, since it's never been exposed to salt, it would deteriorate rapidly in
&gt;areas where paint is chipped on the underside, etc.
&gt;
&gt;What steps can I take to protect my investment? Undercoating? repainting
&gt;with chip-resistant paint? Weekly washes? Tons o' wax?
&gt;
&gt;Anyone?

well Jim, i dont live in cancer central, but they heavily salt the roads in
Northern Virginia.  What i do is completely hose off the underside of the
van leaving nothing forgotten after driving in the snow, the neighbors think
im crazy, &quot;what's that kid doing out in the freezing weather with that
water&quot; but i have explained to my parents the situation.  I'll be the one
laughing in 20 years when my bus is in excellent condition.
