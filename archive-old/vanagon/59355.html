Subject:      Eurovan Curtain Question

Hey y'all,
I have a 93 Eurovan mv, and want to put up some curtains
that I can draw close (ie- on a rod).
I have the ones that snap on for sleeping hooked up now,
and tied up with some rope, but would like to make
ones that I can pull from left to right and right to left.
Anyway, if someone can give me some ideas of really easy ways
to install the rods, I'd appreciate it.  I already have the measurements
of my windows and am about to start making the curtains.
Thanks in advance for any help,
peace,
KEITH
