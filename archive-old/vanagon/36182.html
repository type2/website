Subject: Mounting a Gas Heater from a 412?
Date: Mon, 26 Feb 1996 09:18:06 -0800 (PST)

Hi all,

I have an opportunity to purchase a gas heater from a
412 that Thom Fitzpatrick has.  I'd like to mount it 
underneath in a safe position within the beams.  Does
anyone know if this is a do-able safe thing to do?

If not, the only other option is to buy a BN2 heater
and mount it under the bench seat.  I would really rather
have the heater external and preserve the under bench
area.

Any help with this is appreciated.

Thanks,

Steven
