Batteries are kinda like tires, don'tcha think?  some people have good
experiences with them, and others...the complete opposite...soooo, with
that in mind....
I had a  Die Hard in a Toyota (an anomaly, I assure you!) that started up fine,
then was deader than roadkill the next time I tried to start it (a mere 20 min.
later).  I had the electrical system checked out too, and the 
problem was the battery, because I replaced it with an Interstate and life has
been good for the past couple years.  My wife's GLI still has the OEM
&quot;Autobahn&quot; battery, and it seems to be pretty happy after 4 yr's use.  I
think the Eurovan has an Autobahn also, so we'll see how long that one
lasts....
I think it goes without saying that it helps to check the water level on 
a somewhat regular basis.
