&gt;&gt;I don't know whether you have Discount Tire where you are, but their prices 
&gt;&gt;are truly unbeatable.  &gt;&gt;

I just called the Discount Tire Center here in the Bay Area. They want 
$10.95 each tire for balancing and mounting, plus valves and disposal.
But the Price Club charges only $5 for all these.

I think I am going to give the Uniroyal Laredo LT195/75R14 a try. If I
insist on Michelin XZX 185R14 I will have to buy for Michelin dealers.
The price for the tire is only $7 more each but all other charges add up
to be almost $100 more for 4 tires.

So how do you net heads think?
