Subject: Re: The shower thing :}

OK, &quot;guys,&quot; if some of you intend NOT to shower, I'm going to be
forced to divide our camping area into two categories.  The
group that showers is going to get the chili, margaritas,
tequila shots, and cornbread.  Have fun, the &quot;rest&quot; of you!  ;0
