&gt;I was at Lake Powell a few years ago and saw a barge contraption that a 
&gt; small Winnebago rode on, the rear wheels powered a paddle and the 
&gt; front had a ramp like a landing craft. This thing had about a foot of 
&gt; freeboard, so I assume it is at the bottom of the lake, after one of 
&gt; the infamous storms they have in the canyon. 

A very long time ago I saw the same, a splittie likely since this was in say 
'67. It was on a small barge in an English countryside canal, no waves, just 
smooth sailing.   Tim Smith
