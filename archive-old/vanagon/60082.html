The airflow box and the old Throttle position sensor on typ914s is a carbon
track with a known resistivity per unit area.  The wiper will eventually 
wear a groove in the track and then wear through the track to cause some
degree of open circuit vs position.

Open the airflow box and reposition the wiper to a new &quot;track&quot; region.

Yep, it's a delicate little critter and yep you have to be careful.

Now if it's just a grunge situation, a bit of electrical contact cleaner
sprayed into the box whilst you move the vane manually will cure a host of
problems.
