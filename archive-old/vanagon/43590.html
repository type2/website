My voice may not even reach Steve M. because the depths of my ignorance (of
induction systems in this case) are so great, but I always thought that the
difference between carbs and injection is that carbs suck and injectors blow.
That is, carbs rely on venturis and Bernoulli and all that to draw in 
appropriate amounts of fuel from a bowl at ambient pressure, and injectors
squirt fuel in.  If they inject into a common throttle body, that's plain
fuel injection, if they inject into a runner that serves just one cylinder
that's port injection, and if they inject into the cylinder, that's direct
injection.  Anyone else want to take a shot at this?
