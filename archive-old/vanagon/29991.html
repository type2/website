Subject: injection to carb conversion: summary

Thanks for all the responses on my question (really a search for
psychological reinforcement!) about converting that '79 f.i. Cal bus to
Weber carbs.  It seems the consensus is that the carbs are simpler and
easier for the average grease-monkey to fiddle with, since they don't
require special equipment.  About the only consistent disadvantage that I've
read in the responses is the problem of lacking air pre-heating, but I don't
plan on going into any very cold climates anytime soon (I live in Phoenix!)
Some here have mentioned the problem of emissions inspections, but I also
don't expect to have a big problem with that where I live currently.  All in
all I feel much better having gotten rid of that &quot;Buck Rogers&quot; stuff --
remember it's not just the little ECU box, it's about a dozen sensors plus
the injectors themselves, who knows what else -- and the carb should be
adequate for my needs.

Does anyone know how to get around the pre-heating problem? Can some
modifications be made to the carb to mollify the problem? And what do you
mean by &quot;cold weather&quot; -- Arizona style cold weather or Yukon style cold
weather?  How big of a problem is carb icing?
