 &gt; &gt;    I replaced the stereo in Vanagon this weekend, and all works
 &gt; &gt; well except... it's not switched with the ignition. 
 &gt; Part of the problem is that you're correcting a non-existent problem. VW
 &gt; radios are designed to not be switched with the ignition. 

Indeed, I've found that the radios in both my VWs forget all their presets if 
power is removed (say, to replace the battery).
