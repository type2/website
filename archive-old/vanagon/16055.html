Subject: RV Shops, Puget Sound Area?

I am in the final stages of getting my Thermal Systems propane catalytic
heater ready to install in my bus, but am in need of an RV shop to do the
final installation - running and hooking up the propane lines.

Does anyone have a shop to reccommend in the Puget Sound area? Preferably
it would be someone fairly familiar with Westfalias.

Any help is most appreciated.
