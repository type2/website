Geez David! The last thing we want on this list is someone with
principles! But since you agree with the lit flame in the gas station
argument would you agree that having both propane and gas exposed to a
flame increases your chances of being blowed up real good no matter how
infinitely small that increase is? So if you are risk acceptant like
David Garth, you takes your chances, risk averse like Harry Yates and you
turn off the dial....The question is would you accept those odds with
someone else on board?

I suppose either way, fate is in the eye of the beholder....

This debate reminds me a bit of the anti-nuke demonstrations of the 70's and
80's. Even though protestors believed that their lives were threatened by
a potential nuclear onslaught the odds of every single one of them dying
in a bathroom  accident were significantly higher ( and still are). So why no
anti-unsafe bathroom demonstrations making headlines on the CNN? Principles,
principles- the single minded pursuit of the unobtainable.
