Subject: Re: CCC's 6/14 campout

For all of you who are going on the campout:

Is anyone leaving in either the late afternoon or evening on Friday the
14th? If you are in the Bay Area/Sacto/Valley would you want to meet up and
caravan down?

My family and I will be driving down in a modified '52 barndoor. We've
taken the body off of it, stripped it down to just a chassis, and put a
Ford Windstar body on it. Strictly for aerodynamic reasons don't you know.
The cool thing is it still has that unique VW engine noise, it's a real
sleeper. ;-)
