Subject: '65 - 21 WINDOW TREASURE


At the bequest of a chum, i'm posting this offer for a 
1965 21 window in solid, but unrestored 6-volt condition.
One of those been in a garage for 5 years things, he's 
got it running smoothly and says it's 'too cool for me'.

his dream wagon is a '58 - '61 westfalia in same or better
condition.  he really wants a trade but might consider
other offers.  

contact him (sean) at 919 481-3713 in north carolina

or email me at conkaj_at_aur.alcatel_dot_com if you have Q's.
