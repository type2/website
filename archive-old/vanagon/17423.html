Subject: I removed gas tank w/o spilling!


Hey folks-
Clamp off those fuel lines, or drain the tank.
While waiting on new longblock to come in I'm doing other &quot;wouldn't it be 
easy to....&quot; jobs.  One is taking gas tank out to replace bad fuel level 
sending unit.  I had to drain the (almost full) fuel tank.
Anyone have suggestion for a (ecologically sound) way to dispose of about 
9 gallons of gas?  I don't want to put it back in because it had been in 
the tank for 6 months, and I found some minor rust inside the tank.
Use it in my lawn mower?  (Gee, I'd have a 2 year supply!)
happy friday,
-gary
