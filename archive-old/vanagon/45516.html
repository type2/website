Subject: Steering Wheel Removal

I was cleaning out some mail, and came across the sterring wheel removal
thread.  So I went out to the garage, grabbed the liquid wrench, a 15/16
socket, ratchet, screwdriver and a hammer and climbed into the barndoor.
Weased the horn button off (which is toast :( ) dribbled some liquid wrench
around the nut and threads, took the nut off in very short order, dribbled
some more liquid wrench on the threads with the nut off, braced my right
foot on the headlight bucket and against the bottom of the wheel, and
proceeded to whack at the center of the column, rotating the wheel every
couple whacks.  I got the steering wheel off in less time than it took to
write this message.  And this was probably the crustiest, most sunburnt,
42-year-old-never-been-off-the-bus rustiest steering wheel you will probably
ever see.

I guess this really defines YMMV, huh?
