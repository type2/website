Subject: Rear heater matrix is identical to Polo's
Date: Wed, 8 Jan 1997 21:46:02 -0000

In trying to locate a cheap rear radiator matrix all the 3rd party parts
suppliers I contacted said it was a VW only part and therefore very
expensive at about 100 UK pounds.

Following a lead here about using a Ford or a Golf radiator matrix, and a
tip-off from a VW dismantler about Polo's I went to my local VW main dealer
and asked for the part number for the Transporter rear heater matrix,
answer 867 819 121 A. Then I asked him for the part number for the Polo
heater matrix, answer 867 819 121 A. Same part, sadly same high price.

However, when I went back to the 3rd party parts suppliers, yes of course
they had a heater matrix for the Polo, at 35 UK pounds. This is a saving of
nearly 2/3rds of the price just by a little bit of information. I pass this
tip onto the list although I have a feeling those in the USA don't come
across the Polo very much? In the UK the Polo is so popular that parts are
cheap.

I am astonished that none of the parts suppliers (FLAPS?) have caught on to
this. Apart from the one who gave me the suggestion none of the VW breakers
yards seemed to know this either. If it works I will write to VW Motoring
magazine and tell them. Reminds me of the good news of Jesus - most people
don't have the information although they could save much by knowing.
