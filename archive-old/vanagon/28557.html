&gt;Cylinder head temperature, all cylinders.
  &lt;snip&gt;
&gt;When I saw the above notation, I envisioned *four* gauges,
&gt;one for each cylinder.  Is this overkill?  Is this
&gt;obsession?  Is this insurance?  Is there a 4-cylinder gauge?

I vaguely recall seeing an ad in some VW mag, about such
a gauge. Years ago. Yes, they do exist. Or did. It's a single
round gauge with four little needles-- cute!

Some people also put four sensors, one on each cylinder, and
wire them to a rotary switch that then goes to a conventional
(one-needle) gauge.


&gt;Keep in mind that the owner also replaced standard fuses
&gt;with *breakers* (aircraft-type) so all he had to do was push
&gt;a button.

Hey... an &quot;official&quot; way to wedge a penny in the socket!   :^)
