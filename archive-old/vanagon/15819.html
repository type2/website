Subject: Rolling Toward A Vanagon


Hi Chris,
Saw your letter in the Autoist. With a new engine $6900 is not far out of 
line for an '87 with 80K miles. I paid $5000 for mine with 98k miles. 
Since then I spent $1500 to have the motor rebuilt so the few extra $$ and 
fewer miles easily justifies the difference.

The leakage problems you have heard about are common to the Wasserboxer 
engine. Depending on who you listen to, the reason is 
1. using phosphate antifreeze instead of the Autobahn blue goo that you 
buy from the dealer for $12.00/gallon
2. the gasket sealant used by VW causes the heads to pit, causing leaks
3. running the motor low on coolant causes air pockets in the cooling 
system causing hot spots that stress the gaskets causing leaks
4. VW just screwed up on this one and they never bothered to fix it

With a new motor and proper cooling system maintenance, you should get 
another 100k before leakage occurs. If the dealer is warranting the work 
you are in especially good shape.

The Vanagon is a great vehicle! The weak spot is the engine in my 
opinion. It is built like a tank. Lots of room. Ride high with good view 
of the world up there (although sometimes you do see things you wished 
you hadn't and didn't even know people did while driving).

Good luck with your purchase. There is a lot of Vanagon info on a list 
server called vanagon_at_lenti.med.umn. Just send a note with a message of 
SUBSCRIBE VANAGON and be prepared for a deluge of 70-80 messages per day.

Peace,
