&gt; I finally have all the parts required to reassemble my rear heater--a new

&gt; Since I took both of the rear seats out and cleaned the cork sound
&gt; insulation and the carpet, I also decided to remove the interior panels and
&gt; stuff the cavities of the van with R-11 insulation. Even with the interior
&gt; parts removed back there, the van is much quieter and solid sounding with
&gt; the addition of this insulation.  Cheap solution to sound control.

     I did the same thing. The only thing I thought of later is will
     the insulation settle? But in the mean time it works great!
