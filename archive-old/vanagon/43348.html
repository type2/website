Paul,

So far, so good.  Too early for any objective gas mileage data.

The van has lots of power; I barely have to step on the gas to 
accelerate through the gears.  On the road it seems like I have 
25%+  more power.  Van runs and idles very smoothly.  I think that 
it was running rich before; we'll see.
