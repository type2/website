Subject: westy tent for the rat?

while people are on the subject, i was wondering if any one had a spare tent
suitable for a 65 westy (AKA  the rat).  it is not drivable yet, nor is it
still the original velvet green/white two tone job it was painted.   but it
wants a tent!!!  

  i thought green and white stripes would be nice, though i was told it would
have come with the orange and grey stripes.

  it has four brackets on the roof, and one on the front bumper.  the rear
bumper is gone, so i dont know if there was a mount there.

thanks,  clara
