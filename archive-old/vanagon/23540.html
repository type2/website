Subject: RE: air scoops on splitties


&gt;Can anyone prove to me that the scoops that people drill/weld/poprivit
&gt;to the sides of their poor splits actually work? I'm (ahem) purchasing
&gt;a `67 `weekender' with this modification, and my `66 had them to start
&gt;out with, but I just can't see how this would improve air flow, as it
&gt;doesn't seem like the air will flow, esp. if your engine compartment
&gt;is sealed properly like it should be.


I've wondered about this. Back in the bad old days, when I used to
tow bugs around with my '69 bus in the mountains of Colorado (don't
try this at home, kids), the engine would tend to get hot (Duh!),
and start pinging. I found that, by opening the engine hatch and
driving that way, it wouldn't ping any more, and ran great. Course,
three side effects: (1) hitting a bump would cause the hatch to slam
shut; (2) You tended to get dust and stuff all over your engine; (3)
The cops took a dim view of busses where they couldn't see the rear
plate.

My guess it, air flow is restricted to the rate at which the engine
cooling fan sucks it into the fan housing, thru the thermostat vanes
and cylinders, and out the bottom. So air inside the engine compartment
stagnates and gets heated up (a lot) by the engine, lessening its
cooling potential when it finally does go thru the cylinder fins.

I've considered (and my still do it) cutting a zillion louvers in my
engine hatch, to the right and left of the license plate, and putting
an electric radiator cooling fan on ONE side to blow air out, with
some filter paper on the other for any air that wants to come in. The
object is to get that stagnant hot air out, and cool air in, to the
engine compartment, for the fan to ingest when it finally gets around
to it.

Any comment/criticisms/predictions? Anyone actually tried this?

P.S. Yeah, I eventually did replace a cracked head on that engine.
Maybe I should have done the same to the driver???  :)
