Subject: RE: Evil Bill Gates? (was: MIG Welding/Dave)

On the subject of Microsoft, there is a great Doonesbury today.

On the subject of busses, I got my propane tank topped off yesterday and it
was only 2.5 gallons down.  The fridge is extremely efficient.

Is driving with the fridge on 'gas' okay?  I was told by the propane guy
that I should always have my valve turned off while driving.
