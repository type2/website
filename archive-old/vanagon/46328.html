Subject: I'm Baaaaaaaaaaack!!!!!

Howdy all, I have returned happily and safely to Raleigh after 6000 miles of
travel in my trusty '67 camper. For those of you not familiar with the
circumstances, I will probably post a trip report (or several, depending on how
verbose I feel) on Friday. I certainly missed everyone here on the list, and am
glad to be back. I even got to meet a few fellow listvolk in my travels, who
were wonderfully hospitable (thanks Joel, Jim Kirk, and several NEATO folks) We
saw a lot of nice busses, and met nice people everywhere. We never got hassled
or searched at all, despite the colorful paint jobs.
 Anyway, today was my first day back at work, trying once again to be a
productive member of society....
 So, hello to all, and I'll be posting detailed reports soon...
:)
Richard
