Price a commercial carrier (via 18 wheeler). 
I know there was a recent thread on this but it's an option that ought to be
considered...

Here's another thought. I priced out the total costs minus the wear and tear
on old Rusty's body and health when I bought a 181 in Denver (September,
95)and was faced with a similar situation. I found, at least in my case,
that it was in fact cheaper to hire a commercial carrier to drag it down for
me than it was to get it myself. I could still stay at work and not burn up
vacation time and risk anything out on the highway. I paid $300. to have it
towed down right to the driveway. I was looking at $79.00 per day with
unlimited miles for the rental of the Ford Explorer and a tow ball, gas,
food, driving nonstop and having/choosing to be decieptful with the rental
organization and risk getting caught towing the Thing with the Explorer when
I really wasn't supposed to. All around I really felt better about the
commercial tow, didn't have to &quot;go to confession&quot; etc. and got a good nights
sleep besides. It's just a thought. Check it out and compare.
Admittedly, driving the vehicle home could be cheaper *IF* everything goes
without a hitch, you have the time, the weather is good and depending on the
cost of the airfare.
