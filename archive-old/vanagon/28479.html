they're much more

VW Canada is also planning a major hike to EV prices
with the V6.  My dealer estimates CDN$ 10,000 - $15,000 (!).
The dealers are dismayed (to understate).

As for the current EV, MSRP is $39,256 (5-speed) and $40,306
(auto).  Furnace is compulsory option ;-{
Additional becnh is $670

Adding Freight and PDI, air conditioning tax, gas guzzler
tax, and 15% (!) sales taxes (Ontario), the manual will run
$46,500.

Note to American readers - the Canadian dollar is kinda 
weak.

Your dollar is worth approx $1.40 here.
