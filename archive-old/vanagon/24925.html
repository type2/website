Subject: Re: window frame parts problem solved

Well, I can't help at all here, because the split window
buses don't HAVE any winding to do!  Slide that front
window back, that's it.  What year bus do you have?

'62 no winding, but not much of a window opening, either

&gt; Well some of you will remember my problem, which was the PO 
&gt; lost some crucial window frame parts, and I, never having 
&gt; owned a bus before, didn't even know they were missing 
&gt; until I posted some puzzled inquiries to this very list
&gt; (thanks to Lee Griffiths and Michael Heron and others) after 
&gt; which at least I knew what I needed to find.
&gt;      
&gt; So, at the Toledo show last weekend, I scored a complete 
&gt; set of doors, with glass (I needed one ventwing, too) from 
&gt; a '65 or so, for $20.  A fine swapmeet technique is to
&gt; buy your really heavy stuff right near the end, and the guy 
&gt; will think about hauling those doors back into his
&gt; garage and you'll get them cheap.  Almost scored a tranny for $75 
&gt; but somebody else got it, which is OK because somebody
&gt; else overheard me talking about needing a tranny and said to 
&gt; come by his house and get one for $50.  (I'm going to get
&gt; it next week, I'll keep you posted).
&gt;      
&gt; Anyway, all the window parts I needed were there, (and, in 
&gt; one of those amazing VW coincidences, the one piece missing
&gt; from the frame was the one piece I actually happened to have :) ), 
&gt; and I even got the frame off the door with only a few
&gt; days of Liquid Wrench, my new breaker bar (can you say 
&gt; torque, boys and girls?) and a little strategic drilling.
