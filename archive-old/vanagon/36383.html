Greg says...

        There's one thing that I find puzzling about their injection
system:  how does it determine the quantity of air entering the engine?
The Bosch systems that I've read about (D, J, L &amp; K) all have some sort of
device which measures the incoming air directly (e.g. air mass sensor) or
indirectly (e.g. manifold pressure sensor).  Does the CB system just make
an estimation via the throttle position &amp; rpm?  Is this adequate?  Is this
why the low- and high-speed mixture control knobs are included on the
control unit?


I have a '71 Westy that has an 1835 using CB's setup. It is based on a 1990 GM 
DFI system used on everything from V8's to L4's. The system is comprised of:

	1. ECU (mine is of Isuzu origin) with custom wiring harness
	2. 4 Lucas injectors
	3. MAP sensor
	4. Head temperature sensor
	5. Throttle position sensor
	6. Intake air temperature sensor
	7. O2 sensor

I originally had the mixture control but it is primarily for fine tuning the 
_cold_ idle O2 voltage _if_ the ECU was not programmed for your specific 
motor. Once the O2 sensor warms up and kicks in it is of minimal consequence 
according to CB Performance. During my install process they happened to have 
an identical engine (GEX 1835) as mine ready for the dyno and set up an ECU 
specifically for me. 

It has been working extremely well for me. I was running dual Kadron's but 
couldn't pass Nevada smog (yearly). With the FI setup I pass with flying 
colors. Mileage runs about 17 in town and 21 on the highway.

It was a learning experience getting everything installed but Scott at CB was 
very courteous and helpful. He worked with me till it was right.
