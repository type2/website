Subject: more red rock stuff

David Schwarze:  remember that 12v blenders DO exist - they 
have them at West Marine, but they're about $100.  :(

Everybody:  who has a REALLY large stockpot-type pot
they can bring?  How many gallons of water will it hold
for my shower contraption?  Does anyone have a temperature
guage we can put in it?  BTW, I'm bringing something
some of you saw at the bash - a cedar slatted doormat-type
thing, which we can all stand on for showers, which keeps
your feet up off the ground, and out of the mud.
