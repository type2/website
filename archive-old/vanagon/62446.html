Subject: Re: Bike rack

I just did some shopping and a purchase.  Our Bauer Revolution is on its
maiden voyage, and thus far is doing well.  It's a swing-away hitch-receiver
rack that comes as  2-bike rack, with a +2-bike extension.  It is very solid,
and stable.  It has many improvements over Bauer's previous swing-away.  

They just started shipping these.  We go ours at the Sports Rack (it's
available by mail-order too I believe), and there seem to be a few minor
flaws in the production process.  Our had to be filed to get the swing-away
lock to work freely, but its not something that would keep me from
recommending it.  The major drawbacks are the price (especially if you need
to had a 2&quot; receiver hitch), and the weight.  But if you are serious about
this, and want to access your rear hatch, this is a nice rack.

Another one that looked solid was the Yakima (I forgot the model).  It folds
down, instead of swinging away.  They also have features to protect the
bikes, and stablize the rack.

Let me know if you need more details like prices and phone numbers.
