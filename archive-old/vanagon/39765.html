Subject: Re: You can't do that in a mini-van... [EV MV brag]


Here's some other stuff you can't do in a mini-van that you can do in an EV 
MV:

Turn your MV into a &quot;sky-box&quot;. YEp, with this &quot;cold&quot; weather we've been 
having here in the NE, its been hell watching my son's high school baseball 
team. Solution? Park the van near the diamond....pop the table, have a 
sandwich...coffee, etc!


Quick bike transporter when the kids call and they're 20 miles from home and 
too tired (lazy) to ride the rest of the way. Solution. Fold up the  jump 
seats load the bikes in..._dot_use the seat belt from the passenger side jump 
seat and wrap it around the frames, and anchor it in the clasp on the 
driver's side jump seat.


Be a Thorn in the Side to &quot;air-cooled purists&quot; who say the EV is not a REAL 
VW Van. I know these little discussions have honed my debating skills!!  8)


One word - CURTAINS!!!!  Put up the snap-on curtains, and then you, as our 
friend from Arthur-Andersen has observed, you can crank up the Dead, roll up 
a couple of joints, and have a little Victoria's Secret fashion show 
(nudge..nudge...wink..wink..)   8)
