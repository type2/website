&gt; He's a good mechanic but charges $50 an hour.

==============================
The preceeding statement demonstrates the old saw that &quot;beauty is in the eye
of the behloder&quot; --  I'd absolutely LOVE to find a local mechanic that is good
(and honest) at $50 an hour!  The general local going rate, independent of
virtues, is around $70+.
