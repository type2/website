Subject: Breadloaf Bus On TV

Tonight I was channel surfing and saw The Marshall coming on.  The main
dude was skulking around some farmhouse in Kansas that had a bug deserted
in the high grass.  I was thinking I would keep my eyes peeled for a bus
and there it was.  This old geezer bounty hunter was tracking the same 
guy the Marshall was.  He was running around in a later seventies white
over tan breadloaf with the nose mounted spare and camper windows.  I first
noticed when a shot from the interior was looking through crank out windows.
Saw the bus quite a bit as the old guy tracked the fugitive back to South
Dakota where he finally was allowed to collar the fugitive by the Marshall.
