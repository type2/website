&gt; I saw their ad in the back of Trailer Life magazine, and requested product
&gt; literature.  They make some pretty interesting stuff, although on the
&gt; expensive side...
&gt; ...If any of you have any experience with these units, I'd love to hear
&gt; from you!

Well Martha (from one puke yellow '81 Westy owner to another), although I don't 
know anything about the above, I can suggest a low-budget alternative that my 
wife (Alice Gibb) and I have found useful for car camping and backpacking.

It's called the &quot;solar shower&quot; and comes in several varieties (small, medium, 
and large).  It is basically a tough plastic bag with a tubular spout.  The bag 
is roughly rectangular and has transparent material on one side and black 
plastic on the other.  Ours fits nicely into the luggage rack on top of the van,
and if there is any sunshine, it heats up to about 80-90 degrees F in a few 
hours.  Although you can argue that this depends upon warm weather, who wants to
take an outdoor shower (with all the incumbent evaporative cooling) if it's cold
out anyway?  We got ours at the local REI (Recreational Equipment Inc.) for 
about $10.  When empty, they weigh almost nothing and if you do any backpacking 
near water, they are great since you can carry it in and back empty but have the
luxury of warm showers miles into the woods!
