RE:

&gt;Volks,
&gt;
&gt;My latest experience in my 1971 VW bus is kind of rough.  As I was driving
&gt;home from a Bon Jovi load-out at 1:30 am on route 24 west, traveling at
&gt;about 60mph, some drunk who apparently thought my fabulous double taillights
&gt;ment that he was still on the road, nailed me hard on the left rear of the
&gt;bus.................I would like to know what the general consensus is on the
&gt;value of a 1971 Westfalia bus in excellent mechanical and structural
&gt;condition.''''''''''''



My '72 Westy was clipped on the back as well and required about $1700+ to
fix. Insurance claimers told me &quot;Sorry, book value is $672. We give you the
check, you give us the bus.&quot; My wonderful State Farm Agent led me down the
primrose path, and sold me collision and liability based upon my having the
vehicle appraised by a certified antique car dealer. I had all the
documentation to that effect, stamped,sealed, pix inlcuded and highly
offical, as had been requested by State Farm. The Van looks great inside
and out, and has no visible rust, dents or anything. (I mean she's a Babe!)
It was appraised for $3500, which I think is a fair value.  The claims
adjuster said basically, &quot;Tough Bananas. We don't go by the appraised
value, and we consider your vehicle totalled.&quot; To which my reply
(understated here) was &quot;Like Hell...I'll see you in small claims  court.
Your SF agent specifically sold me collision for xxx amount with a $250
deductible for antique cars....etc.&quot; I had to fight this really hard.
Eventually I won, they fixed it and paid for it. He did tell me that had I
not had the documentation, or if the repair estimate was closer to the
appraised value, I would have had to either give them the van (hah.) or pay
for/or do the repair myself.. (which involved tordhing off the back quarter
panel and welding on a new one.)

So, a word to the wise re documentation.

Also, if you have recent pictures that show its condition, you can supply
insurance claim adjustors with documentation from trade magazine ads (or
NEATO/LIMBO newsletters) that give average selling values for those
vehicles. There are also Collector's Clubs which can furnish you
documentation of going prices/values of vehicles.

Good luck. Hope this has helped.
