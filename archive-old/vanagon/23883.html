Subject: Re: '78 F.I. Problems.

Sounds like the problem I was having last summer in my '79 Bus.  I changed
the fuel filter in a national forest camp site in Colorado; that didn't help.

Finally got under there and pulled the rubber line from where it exits the
gas tank.  Hardly a trickle.  Shoved a piece of coat hanger up there into
the gas tank outlet.  Out gushed dirt and other debris, mixed with gasoline.
Got in my face some; I suggest draining it into a can or something.  It ran
great after that, for the rest of the trip, and still does.
