Sounds like I'm ok on this.  This morning on the way 'up the hill', the
oil temp stayed in the 200-220 degree range.  Since I change the oil
&lt;/= 3000mi religiously, I think I'm doing ok.  However I still get 
nervous having to struggle uphill (from 4200ft. to 7200ft) for more than
an hour (~45 miles to work!), every day (I'm from an area where I didn't 
have to contend with many hills on the way to work)!  All this is kind of
related to the question I had a few weeks ago about which is worse on a
car; 10min. start and stop, or 1hr. of mountain driving (which is, 
incidently, the difference for me in driving conditions from my old
job to my current one).  The nice thing about the drive, though, is I
get to 'glide' home!
