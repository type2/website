Subject: instruments /f theme songs, LIVE AT LEEDS

	Thanks for the positive report on dip-stick temp sensors, Forrest,
Sami and others and the alternative sender location, Dave, David C and David S.
Since there are a couple of Porsche swaps out here every year, the
914 adaptor for temp sensor on the galley pickup is possible- if that
adaptor can be applied to a type II case!

	You're right, Sami, the head sender selector will lower the temp. 
reading, but like you say, deltas are what one is looking for. If I feel 
really rich I may put in two gauges :-) Now THAT's ostentatious!

	Dave Black's suggestion of crimping the thermocouple wires
into a lug and screwing that lug to a suitable tapped hole in the head
certainly has merit.

	David Carnet's report of 275F FI head temp and 350F spark-plug
ring temp tell me which gauge I'll need- it'll be the VDO 600 unless
I can find a 450. (Catalog lists 300F and 600F- I wonder if I could
find these in Celsius as well?) I suppose I could use the 300F gauge
and put in a resistive divider, (or even a &quot;F to C&quot; converter!) but
I'd like to have 'real' numbers if I could.

	Steve Dolan's suggestion of trying all 4 cylenders and seeing
which is hottest is a good one (since I have a dog-house cooler) and
so I'll plan to move whatever I install around and monitor all 4. Results
will be published.

	Sami's holes between the radio and ashtray sound like a good way
to go- I'm not sure I could bring myself to do it but I'll give it serious
thought. I'm seriously considering ways to convert the ash-tray to
a cup-holder, since its NEVER going to be used for ashes again...
And, of course, a bloomenvasen somewhere or other.


	I do find that 3,000 rpm is sort of a natural stopping point
for my right foot. Its more like &quot;Gauges, what fun!&quot; As you may suspect,
I've gotten to sit in the co-pilot seats of a Navy P-3C and a retired
Air Force B-52D and I thought both instrument pannels were WAY COOL!
Ian and I got pictures of each other sitting in the '52. Once in a
lifetime!


	If LIVE AT LEEDS doesn't ring any bells with you, send me a
blank cassette and I'll put it and other suitable bus music on it and
send it back. It would be a pleasure. Sadly, the LIVE AT LEEDS CD doesn't
come with the replica recipts for smoke bombs. So I've got to keep my
vinyl copy.
	Send blank cassette to

	4660 Westmont Avenue
	Campbell, CA 95008-5830
	USA
