&gt;Hi,
&gt;
&gt;It has been cold here in Eastern PA.  The last few mornings I have had
&gt;problems
&gt;shifting my manual trans., it gets beeter after it warms up for a while.
&gt;  So yesterday I spent the day cleaning up the garage
&gt;so I could fit the Van in.  After it sat in the garage for an hour, the
&gt;shifting
&gt;was back to normal.
&gt;
&gt;What should I do to make the tansmission more tolerant to the cold?
&gt;
&gt;I was thinking about changing the fluid by going to one of those one hour
&gt;places.  
&gt;
&gt;What is your opinion on the &quot;Jiffy Lube&quot; shops and the qaulity of their
&gt;fluids and services, and should I do it myself.
&gt;
&gt;One question that gives you isight into my ignorance:  Is there a dipstick
&gt;or some resevoir I can look into to make sure I have enough trans fluid?
&gt;
&gt;Please respond to me directly at jferree_at_pica.army_dot_mil.
&gt;
&gt;thanks for your time.

The trans oil is checked by removing the fill plug on the side of the trans.
 The oil level should be about 1/2 inch below the hole. It must be checked on
level ground.  I would recomend draining and refilling the gearbox with a
75-90 synthetic gear lube.  This wil ease your shifting problems and provide
improved transmission protection.
Dennis.
