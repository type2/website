Subject: RE: handling on pre '68

Markus asked if there were any solutions to sloppy steering.

The answer is of course, yes.

First check / replace your tie rod ends, there are six of these on the bus and
any one of them can cause havoc with straight ahead steering.  

Next, check your link pin for slop.  The link pin is the thing near the middle
of the torsion tubes that the link arm is attached to.  The link arm converts
the front to rear motion from the steering box to the right to left motion of
the wheels.  If the link pin is sloppy, it may need the bushings replaced, or
the pin itself may be worn and can be replaced alone (this was done for me by an
incompetent VW garage that assured me they could replace the bushings, then
after getting the pin out, informed me that to replace the bushings, they would
have to remove the front suspension and send it out to another garage for the
work to be done.  Replacing the pin only with a new one got rid of the slop in
my steering, it turned out that my old pin was pretty badly worn and corroded).

Finally, check /  adjust the steering box itself.  If the slop is in the box,
and it cannot be adjusted out, it is time for a rebuild / replace of the box.

Good Luck,
