Subject: Update: Help!! 1978 Bus won't start!!

Thanks for all the responses!  I think we got it hooked up correct now
because the little terminals show that juice is going through.  But the coil
won't produce a spark.  I'm going to bring my coil in and have it checked to
see if it is working right or not.  If it does work I don't know what to do.
Does anyone know of a good stock replacement coil?

Thanks again for all the help!!
