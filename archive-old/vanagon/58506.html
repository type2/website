&gt; A FRIEND OF MINE GOT YOUR ADDRESS FROM SOMEONE. HE MIGHT BE &gt;INTERESTED IN
SELLING A 87 VW WESTFALIA WITH SYNCROMATIC &gt;AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION. VERY GOOD
CONDITION WITH A/C AND 106,000 &gt;MILES. IF INTERESTED, MAIL ME AND I WILL GIVE
HIM YOUR INFORMATION &gt;OR I WILL GIVE YOU HIS PHONE #.
&gt;  THANKS
&gt;  MIKE   

Thanks, but I'm not interested in buying another Vanagon.  
I have two already and love them.

Many others would be interested in buying your friend's van though.  I
suggest you send an ad (via email) to the Vanagon internet mailing list.
 It's an internet based group of about 500 Vanagon owners and some people
interested in buying Vanagons.

Send the email ad to :
Vanagon_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu

I suggest that you state in the message that you don't subscribe to the list
and to email you directly if interested in the van.

Good luck,
Jim Davis
