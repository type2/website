To All:

When you have fasteners that come loose despite being torqued to spec and
installed as per instructions provided by the engine manufacturer,   and when
there is no problems with the engine, such as unusual vibrations or CHT
temps,  the source of the problem may be downstream from the fitting.

Factories do make errors, as the various recalls prove.  But fabrication
errors in repair parts are an entirely other world.  I've seen Brazilian heat
exchangers that had the flange welded about ten degrees off.  By the time
you'd reamed and jacked and bent the things into alignment you had built in
some really heroic stresses that after a few heat cycles produced lots of
nice noisy leaks, loosened fasteners and a host of other problems.

A very common problem with bugs and early buses is after-market exhaust
systems that have resonant points far removed from the stock systems.  They
set up vibrations and a rich field of harmonics that often produce strange
problems in remote parts of the vehicle, like an ash-tray that won't stay
closed.  The various fixes range from the ridiculous to the sublime but the
explanations as to the cause of the problem are usually far from the mark.

A loose fastener is often only a symptom.  Symptomatic relief will keep you
on the road but the root problem could be something rather sneaky -- and
possibly dangerous.

A fastener that 'just comes loose' is enough to keep me awake nites.
