Subject: How to Steal VW Vans Quickly



Ha....thought this might get your attention.

My van has been burglarized four times over the years, almost always by 
someone prying/breaking open the right hand vent window in front. What is 
the experience of others on the list, I wonder?

Any defensive ideas ?  Favorite alarms?

I've also had the enlivening experience of burglars attempting to break 
in while I'm camping in it. This one is REALLY good for some adrenalin. 
How 'bout you?

'nuther good story...... about 7 years after buying my van, and that long 
after the first burglary, I had to remove the rear bumper to fix a dent. 
Upon doing so, I found what I believe to be the pry bar used to break the 
vent on the first occassion. Looks like they jammed it in the back when 
running away. I keep it in the front seat now as a possible gift to 
future visitors.

James......San Francisco Bay area
