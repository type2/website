Hello gang!

Yep, we've made it back to Vancouver after a 15,000 mile 'round North 
America (including Mexico) 3 month trip in our beloved '76 westy.  A full 
trip report is forthcoming, I promise.

I'm not officially on the 'net yet, tho (I'm using my dad's account right 
now), and it'll probably take a few weeks for my own account to get up 
and running.  So I'm not subscribed to the list yet, but I'll post as 
soon as I am.  I'm going to get reprints of some of the better photos 
from the trip, and I'll send them to David Schwarze to scan in to the 
web (although I haven't asked him yet).

One very sad note: we're going to have to sell our much-loved westy to 
defray the costs of the trip.  Very, very sad.  If there are any 
wannabusses or wannawesties out there, check out my next post.  Special 
price considerations will be granted if I can see that it is going to a 
good home.

Look forward to catching up on things in a few weeks!
