Subject: no start, round 2

Advice received from Sean, Paul, Joel, Rob, Ken, Norman, Steve &amp; John much
appreciated!  I checked my Bentley's description of the catalytic converter,
decided I'd been misinformed, got out my bike &amp; plugged in Tugboat.  I've
just turned the key... no sound.  I flipped the headlight switch on &amp; off, &amp;
Tug came to life.  Restart attempted... no sound.  Lights flipped &amp; YES!
 I'll get battery voltage checked &amp; be ready to replace PO's Diehard, as well
as finding (yea Bentley!) &amp; bumping the solenoid, etc., etc.  Is it true-
will normal &amp; hill jump starts ruin my cat. con.?  The starter sounded
strong, but I do pull on the steering wheel when I come aboard, &amp; I'm always
trying to get the steering column covers to seat right to eliminate the
rubbing squeal they produce.  I'm off- can't send a progress report 'till
late tonight.
