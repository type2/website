Subject: Re: Bentley manual costs

Barrett Enterprises in Azusa, CA (818-967-5171) lists decent prices for 
Bentley manuals.  $26.95 for the 66-69 and 70-79 Beetle manuals.  $69.95 
for the new reprint of the 61-65 Beetle and 63-67 Transporter manuals 
(which Bentley listed for almost $100 initially).  Don't know if they 
stock Loaf or Vanagon manuals tho'.  I have no connection to this company 
(just saw the ad).  I'd check the used book stores first.
