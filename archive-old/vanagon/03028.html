&gt; 
&gt; i saw you got a good quote for your seals (drive belt too?) - was  that
&gt; at VW or a real mechanic  :-)

Well, 

  Here's the poop. It was their learned opinion that the seals were 
blown due to excessive blow-by creating too much pressure in the
crankcase. So, they (Vaught and Son Garage) said that the seals 
may or may not hold.

  I had them adjust the valves while they were in there.  I asked when
it was time for a new engine (ouch...) and they said &quot;If the seals blow-out
again&quot;.  Any thoughts from the teaming masses?

PS. to you people with the wussy-compression gas-burners, just remember
that my exhaust system is cheap, and my dipstick is straight. 

p.s. it was $30/hr for 5 hours + parts.

ppss I just got my recycled-inc catalog and wasted 2 hours reading it. Way fun.
