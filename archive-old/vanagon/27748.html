Subject: ya never know

My RA came over and goes &quot;You know anything about cars-I see you drive
that old bus&quot; His problem is that the car won't start.
BTW, his car is a 73 Mercury Comet.
He pops the hood, we go through the whole schpiel:
check oil, check gas, check carb., check plug wires, check radiator, 
check battery, starter.  It still won't start, and it's not really 
turning over. It sounds like crap, and smokes out of everywhere.
We were just about to call it quits when he goes &quot;what's this?&quot;
I go &quot;It's the coil, which connects to the distrib. and ignition
switch&quot;  He pushes on one of the wires at the coil, and its loose.
We put that wire on tight, and the ole beast starts right up
and purrs at idle.  Tomorrow we would have given it a tune-up
Instead tomorrow he gets to go visit his family.
