 Trouble is, I can't get my hands or even a finger down inside the battery
 compartment to get it out.  The battery just barely sits inside the
comparment.
 There is no handle on the battery, and nothing to grab on top but the posts.
 
 Can anyone reccommend a neat trick to get the bugger out of there?  How
about a
 trick to make sure that it will be easy to get it out in a few years should
I
 need to replace it again?

Buy a Battery strap at your FLAPS.  It will attach to the posts making
battery removal a breeze.
