&gt;
&gt;Ah yes! I just found myself watching Brother Jesse Jackson and hoards of
various folks debating &quot;English as the 'Official' language in the USA.&quot; The
US Congress will be debating this issue forever but according to Brother Ric
we on the list have resolved this. The trouble I see is that I will have to
include the [RN] designation before all of my posts! This is a potentially
good thing as it will slow my rate of responses to fifty percent of all of
the posts. (Get a life Rusty!!!). I wish to suggest one more category. The
[MF] category would not be for what you and your dirty minds are thinking
but for &quot;Martha's Frustrating&quot; responses. So much for my MENSA membership.
I'll have to resign from MENSA and the ACM/Sig-encryption bandwagons on Monday.
