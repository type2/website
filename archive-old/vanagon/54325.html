&gt;This morning it was colder than most (25=B0F). Starting my 88' Westy

&gt;
&gt;This was with the engine still cold.
&gt;
&gt;I shut the engine and checked the fluid and the pump belt which both
&gt;checked fine. The temp gauge did not indicate that the engine was
&gt;overheating so I decided (since I was already late) to drive to work.
&gt;The entire way the Temp LED kept flashing although the engine was not
&gt;overheating.
&gt;
&gt;When I got to work, I shut the engine, waited a minute and started the
&gt;engine again. This time the Temp LED stopped flashing.
&gt;
&gt;Has anyone else experienced this problem? Could there be air in the cooling
&gt;system?
&gt;
&gt;Help would be very much appreciated...

I got this problem a few weeks ago, this LED indicates the level of coolant
fluid in the expansion tank, not in the one behind the plate. There is a
sensor on the expansion tank with a connector. You might unscrew it and
check if the 2 pins are clean. Check also the level of coolant fluid in
order to see if the sensor is in the coolant. Don't rely on the second tank.
Mine was full and the expansion tank almost empty. Beware of the head
gasket... Hope this help, I think it's a pretty common problem on Vanagons.
