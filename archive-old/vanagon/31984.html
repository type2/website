&gt;Anyone else recall any memorable &quot;cute&quot; or otherwise funny ads 
from the
&gt;past, from VW or not?

My favorite shows a guy driving thru a snowstorm on his way to work 
in the early morning darkness in his beetle.  He arrives at work 
and climbs into a huge snowplow.  The announcer says something to 
the effect:  &quot;Ever wonder how the snowplow driver gets to work?&quot;
