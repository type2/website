Subject: Re: Help me find a westy...

Many thanx for the great offers... got a call from a local bus nut here 
in NH... said to &quot;Check out Gordi Davis at 4 ever 4...&quot;
	went up to Gordi's shop in Marlow NH got a coupla CV joints for 
my '85 GL, looked at 5-6 Buses ( most of which are Westies...) after a 
few hours of crawling around on the ground, My friend bought an '81 
Westy with 126K &quot;NO RUST&quot; (very rare here in NH) motor was sitting on 
the floor inside with a &quot;weak #3 cylinder&quot; this was owned by a older 
couple who have owned it from new... unfortunately the husband was going 
into a nursing home and they had to part with the camper.. Price was 
also good $2250... we'll pick it up and tow it home tommorrow...motor 
will be coming apart the next day and hopefully with a P&amp;C set and 
new/rebuilt heads it will be up and running by the weekend...

	Again thanx for all the replies!!
	
	Now I'm thinking of getting a camper!!!
