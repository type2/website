&gt; I do remember that running a motor too lean can cause its premature demise.
&gt; So I'd rather have it rich than lean. 

I agree with Derek.  Running rich is much better than running lean.  The
reason is that a lean mixture will cause detonation (pinging) which will
destroy an aluminum motor in short order.
