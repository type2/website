&gt; &gt;I was talking to the parts guy at the local dealership.  He said that VW
&gt; &gt;has a deal to replace ANY vanagon engine for $2495 complete.  Something to
&gt; &gt;do with recalls and stuff so they just made a blanket rule.  He also
&gt; &gt;mentioned that most VW dealerships would try to steer you away from this
&gt; &gt;option to instead rebuilding your engine because the VW dealership makes
&gt; &gt;no money on the new engine under this plan due to the way the plan is set up.
&gt;Kohlweiss in Menlo Park, CA has GEX rebuilts for 1500 and 2000 (air
and water respectively) without labour.


We installed an aircooled GEX by ourselves and did the extra work that
would cost a lot - cleaned everything, new clutch, dist, trans fluid,
flywheel etc. If you are ready willing and able installing the engine
yourself would save between 400 and 1000 dollars depending on how much
you want to replace.

GEX has a good reputation but after 10000 miles its stilol too early
to tell. Apparently they align bore but also use seat inserts which
tend to come out......

NEw heads adlone would probably run you between 500 and 800 dollars
for an aircooled more for a water cooled.

&gt; well, i just phoned in to the dealer in atlanta, and, yup. but it is NOT
&gt; a 'new' engine.
&gt; 
&gt; it's a factory rebuilt engine with new heads, and atlanta's price was $2380
&gt; NOT including labor, which they figured at 10 hours _at_ 52.00/hour. so it looks
&gt; like a vw dealer rebuilt could be had for right at $3000.
&gt; 
&gt; oh, yeah. those are the water-cooled engines, by the way. BOTH of them, the
&gt; 1983-85 (DH) 1.9 liter and the 1986-91 (MV) 2.1 liter engines.
