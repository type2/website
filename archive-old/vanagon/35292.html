So Martha says:

&gt; My VW repair shop need bugs (69-74 std.) in or near the San Francisco
&gt; Bay area.  He has a contract to refurbish about 20 of them for a
&gt; Pepsi commercial/bug-giveaway, and needs them asap, so told him I'd
&gt; try and help out by posting here.  He's willing to pay $300-$1,000,
&gt; depending on the condition, and it's not crucial that the car be
&gt; running.  Good body would help.
&gt; 

Wow!  I wish I had a dream job with an order like that!  :)
