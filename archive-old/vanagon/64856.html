&gt;Like all good EV owners I spent last friday nite under it changing the oil

&gt;
&gt;There is an oil cooler on EV's just like the ones on Vanagons. It is held
&gt;onto its mounting by a large, flat nut. When changing the filter on vanagons
&gt;it's easy to see/feel if this nut is tight. If its not it will loosen and in
&gt;time prevent the filter/cooler from seating. Then it will be a mysterious
&gt;oil leak. Until this nut is tightened no amount of torque on the filter will
&gt; seal it or the oil cooler seal.
&gt;
&gt;On the EV's next filter change check this nut! Its hard to see but is very
&gt;important.

This is the same type of oil cooler as on the 86 and later Golf GTIs and
Jetta GLIs....unless someone screws around with the oil cooler unit, these
nuts do not come undone....At 215k miles, my GTI has not leaked from the
cooler, and I have never heard of a GTI/GLI owner complain of a leak before.
