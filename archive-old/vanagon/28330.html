&gt;I have an '88 GL that VW would only pay 33 percent, but I had a lot more

&gt;may be going again,
&gt;and after only 22 K miles on the new one!  (hopefully, it's a pinhole in one
&gt;of my coolant hoses - I haven't found the leak yet!)

I've never heard of the head gasket problem occurring after jus 22K.  I think
typical is 60-100K between gaskets.
