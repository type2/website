Subject: re: awnings

&gt;Camping World (800) 626-5944 has awnings for the VW made by A &amp; E Systems,
&gt;a division of good old Dometic!   Almost every large RV place will be able
&gt;to order them too.  They have a special bracket for the Vanagon &amp; Westy
&gt;which stands the roller up of the roof at an angle.  This also makes it
&gt;tall enough.  I've been toying with the idea of getting one but I am
&gt;monetarilly challanged at the moment.  Let me know how you like it if you
&gt;get one.
&gt;
        How easy is it to remove that type awning? I've talked with some
folks who lugged their awning around with them all summer because putting
it on and taking it off was such a hassle. (I don't recall what kind it
was.) In a perfect world, I'd only want to have the awning attached to the
side of the bus when I was going camping or picnicking.
        Last summer I spotted a rolled-up awning from Carefree of Colorado
on the side of a Westy in a parking lot. I never got a chance to speak with
the owner or see it deployed. Anybody have experience with that variety?

        Also, what kind of money are we looking at for either the A&amp;E
(sounds like a cable TV channel) or Carefree awnings?
