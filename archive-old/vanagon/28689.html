 &gt; I would like to add that the story I read indicated he made several 
 &gt; runs down the runway before trying to fly the aircraft.

This is normal practice when flying a new aircraft for the first time.  Taxi 
tests are supposed to uncover problems with wheels, brakes, engine and general 
mechanical soundness **BEFORE** you go into the air.

 &gt; He apparently made 4 runs and that it was unfortunate the 
 &gt; engine failed on the 5th attempt. 

Indeed.  It sounds like he MAY have been too anxious to get into the air.  
Often engines for homebuilt aircraft are bought early in the process and sit a 
long time without being run.

Also, I was taught that if the engine fails on takeoff it is MUCH better to 
just land straight ahead rather than try to turn back -- too many people die 
each year trying to turn back to the airport after a low altitude engine 
failure and get into a fatal stall-spin accident.  You may lose the plane 
landing straight ahead into trees. bushes, fences or whatever, but you're less 
likely to die.  That's a hard decision to make in almost no time when you're 
in something you've spent a couple of years of nights and weekends building.

Well.  ObVanagon:  Anyone have a single person methid for bleeding air out of 
the cooling system of a WasserBoxer?  The shop manual keeps me busy hopping 
from front to back and I'm never sure I've done it quite right.

(Air cooled dudes and dudettes can snicker all they want...)
