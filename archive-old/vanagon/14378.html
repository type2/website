&gt; &gt; I poked around last night for a few minutes surveying what I will have to do
&gt; &gt; to remove the engine from my '74 Westy. Can anyone tell me whether it is 
&gt; &gt; easier to remove the engine and transmission together, as a unit - which would
&gt; &gt; go more or less straight down -  or to take the engine out by itself - back 
&gt; &gt; and down - . There doesn't appear to be much room behind the engine to pull
&gt; &gt; it clear of the transmission input shaft. Has anyone tried it both ways?
&gt; 
&gt; It should be easier to take out the motor by itself.  On the '74, does the
&gt; rear apron come off, like earlier busses?
&gt; 
HAH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
If only that rear apron *did* come off... 
Unfortunately, in 1972, VW decided to weld the skirt in place, along
with switching to the type IV pancake engine. Therefore 
forcing the engine to be pulled back like 2&quot;, then dropped, while the
bus is raised, so the engine can slide out. This made it horribly
difficult to get to the engine, which is why in '74 or so, they put in
the hatch so you can get to the engine from the top...
That's why I like engine work on the early buses much, much better.
Anyway, 
Richard
