Subject: Happier update to '81 Westy project.

Sorry about the gripe letter before. had to get it off of my chest.
UPS can find me now! At last! And my second heat exchanger arrived
this morning. 2 pretty gray ones from Denmark. The cooling shrouds
went on the new engine a-ok last night. Sure looks spiffy! All the 
shrouds were scrubbed up, coated with Extend rust eliminator, and
have a base coat of BBQ black, and 3 coats of engine black paint.
Gosh this engine looks nice. Hope we can get it all in tommorow.
Dropping it took about 3 hrs. Hopefully the reverse will go very
smoothly. Looks like it will be running on Saturday or Sunday.
Will keep you posted!
Lisa
