Subject: Looking for heater for my 85 Westy.

I'm not sure what kind of heaters are available.  I am looking for something
to use in the winter months for camping that will operate off of propane or
some other source (other than a running engine).  Can anyone tell me what
will fit my needs? ....and does anyone have one for sale?
