&gt;THEN, the other day i saw this '70s westie thing with the pop top BUT the
&gt;pop top popped to the side!!! the pop top was hindged on one side (the 
&gt;passenger side i think) and the canvas folded out kinda rounded like, 
&gt;(there must have been some poles or something to keep its shape) so
&gt;the hard top part and the canvas formed a sort of big tube while open...
&gt;much more space i would think, but the canvas would have been right on
&gt;the top so it would get very wet in the rain...the hard top part also 
&gt;sported many dark tint windows...pretty cool...

Hmmm.....Don't see many Doormobile Campers in that part of the world, I
guess.
