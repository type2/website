Subject: CV boot kit prices
Date: Wed, 1 May 1996 11:46:00 -0500 (CDT)

I called RMMW this morning and their $9.95 cv boot kit, complete with 
all of the hardware is on two week backorder.  Calls all over the 
world this morning has found that the next cheapest price for 
everything is about $16 per joint, with all of the bolts, clamps, 
washers, grease, etc.  Does anybody know of another source in the $10 
range?  Thanks, Jim
