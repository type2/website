Subject: early report on synthetic tranny lube

About six weeks back I replaced the tranny oil in my '87 syncro with Red 
Line brand synthetic. Though it will be difficult to quantitatively evaluate 
the performance of this product, so far I'm very happy. The tranny runs 
quieter and shifts like a dream; feels like I'm driving with a new 
transmission. The synthetic should outlast the dino stuff--I'll keep the 
list informed as the miles roll by.
