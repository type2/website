&quot;Hormones are, broadly speaking, chemical messengers that the body (yours
or the turkey) uses to control various functions. Insulin is a good
example, its involved in the control of blood glucose levels. Hormones can
be proteins, peptides (short chains of amino acids), glycoproteins and
glyocpeptides (sugar residue(s) attached), steroids (can think of them as
modified cholesterol), and others chemicals.
They may or they may not be affected by the digestive tract, either
absorbed or broken down. My wife takes synthetic thyroid hormone orally,
anabolic steroids can be taken orally, birth control pills can be taken
orally :). I don't think its safe to assume that an animal fed &quot;hormones&quot;
is perfectly safe to consume.&quot;

Personally, I think it's a good idea for EVERYONE on this list to
take birth-control pills.  You don't want your mentality propogated,
do you?!??
