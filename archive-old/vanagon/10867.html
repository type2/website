&gt;The price difference between VW and my FLAPS for plugs, rotor, cap, and air

&gt;and Beck-Arnley for all the rest, vs. Bosch from VW.  What's the real
&gt;difference?  Have I doomed my beloved brick by putting in the cheap stuff?
&gt;What about other parts?  When do you go authorized VW, and when do you go with
&gt;the imitators?  Thanks all.

i think it's a case of personal paranoia. :)  but also, check with other VW
dealers, even the ones who advertise in HOT VWs and such ... the difference
in prices between dealers will sometimes amaze you.

as long as it is a good 'quality name' (i.e., not Bob's Spark Plugs, and
Fred's Oil Filters), you are likely ok. i've run Champion plugs for 24 years
in all my vws and never had any problems. i've got bosch in this 88 now, but
i got them at the FLAPS. i used Mann oil filters and air filters (from the
FLAPS) for years, because this idiot dealer wanted $12 each for oil and $30
each for air filters. but i found a dealer in atlanta that sells me genuine
vw stuff for only $0.50 more per oil filter and and $1.50 more per air filter.
... and that's where the paranoia comes in. ;)  for that little, why NOT use
the vw (and then the dealers can't say anything about 'wull, it's your oil
filter that caused your wheels to fall off: it's not from us'.

if the FLAPS stuff is made by bosch, it's the same stuff. otherwise, i don't
know. i've not found much of the cheap/unreliable stuff that is made for the
buses (not enough profit in it, i guess) ... so, except for some things from
JCWitless, most of the stuff you CAN find (at least for vanagons) is ok.
sorta. maybe. sometimes. :)
