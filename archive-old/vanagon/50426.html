&gt;&gt;John,

&gt;&gt;Your coolant light will blink if you do not have the proper mix of
&gt;&gt;coolant and water.  It will also blink if your fluid level is low.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Just a thought.

&gt;The sensor is simply a level sensor, not a magical glycol sniffer.

        The sensor is not only a level sensor, but it does it by magic!
        In one of the VW archives I found a service bulletin about the
blinking lite. The level is determined by the resistance of the fluid acting
on a probe, (NOT a Float). If the coolant is mixed too 'rich' the probe will
not get the correct reading and the lite will blink.
        I can't remember which VW page I went to for this info, but there
was some good info out there for the finding.
        Later volks,

        Rob.
