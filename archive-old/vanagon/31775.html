Subject: RE: List Stickers, shall I make them?


&gt;Hope everyone had a pleasant Holiday vacation. Over mine, I did some
&gt;checking up on making up list stickers. My main concern is that I would
&gt;have to order 500 (yes, five hundred) stickers as a minimum, to get the
&gt;best price possible. So, basically, I just want to make sure I can sell
&gt;enough to cover myself. Though I won't describe the design (just a tad
&gt;paranoid), I do believe they will be pretty nifty. One of the big points
&gt;of these stickers, I think, is to place them in a standard spot, on the
&gt;rear left corner/window,

Are these bumper stickers, like 15&quot; by 4&quot; size? Or smaller-- going in
windows, I'd guess they would have to be.

If they're smallish window stickers, I'd love to get some!

Are they adhesive on front, or back? Like, for putting inside the glass,
or outside? If they go on the outside, then We can quietly stick one on
the neighbor's bus who doesn't have a computer...   :^)
