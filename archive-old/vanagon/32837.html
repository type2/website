Subject: RE: vanagon shock absorbers


&gt;Anyone besides Joel have any experience with replacement
&gt;shock absorbers for the vanagon. I've looked in the archives
&gt;and came up with Joel's recommendation for hard to find
&gt;Koni shocks. Otherwise the archives is a little lacking for
&gt;vanagon shock info. I'm looking for a good after market shock,


Funny you should ask that. I just finished replacing the shocks on my
'80 V6anagon. I put on Gabriel shocks purchased from Sears for $16.99
each including shipping to my door. They bolted right on.

These seem to be a medium-soft shock, lifetime guarantee from Sears.
Before replacing them, I had some shimmying and shaking, and a lot of
nosedive when hitting the brakes, and nose-rise when accelerating.
Now I have no shaking, and moderate nose motion.

Since this particular Vanagon has a Chevy V6 engine and lots of torque,
I'd like to make the car as sports-car-ish as possible (ha!). The
Gabriel shocks are nice medium shocks for this application, and I would
be happy with them if it was an ordianry Vanagon. But with the zippy
engine, it would be nice if the shocks were a lot stiffer and firmer.
If I had it to do over, (and if I had lots of $$), I'd go for KYBs
all around. They make a gas-a-just for the rear, and a GR2 for the front,
and are NOT hard to find. Call some of the mail-order places in Hot VWs
magazine, and/or look in your Yellow Pages under Shocks (or Tires),
for places that sell KYBs.

Another option is Koni-- excellent, very stiff shock, very expensive.
I've heard that Bilstien is also very good, but have never tried them.
