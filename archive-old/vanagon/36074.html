This is very cool. First, memorize the Idiot Book. Take it with you. There
are lists of tools in there.

I actually thought this might turn into a nice thread; I know I'm not the
only one who's spent time tooling around Mexico. A few eclectic notes:

Uno. I wouldn't worry about Mexican gas. The guy I used to traipse around
Chihuahua State with, my best friend in college, was completely anal about
putting those little cone-top bottles of Bardahl whatsit in the tank
whenever we went to Pemex. He had decided that if we didn't use this stuff
the engine would immediately form chronic fur-balls. I think he read this
in _The People's Guide to Mexico_.

But midway through every road trip we would run low on money and we'd have
to choose between the Bardahl on the one hand, and more warm beer and Faros
on the other, so of course we didn't buy any more of the Bardahl. I never
noticed any difference at all.

Do get your gas in cities of you can because you'll be much less likely to
get a free cupful of water in your tank that way.

Dos. If you stay on blacktop, you'll miss most of the fun. All the cool
stuff is on unpaved roads. However, culverts are not a high priority in
Mexico. They pretty much think culverts are for wussies. Wherever an
unpaved road intersects with a canal or drainage ditch or irrigation ditch
(and they dig them deep in the desert), they simply slope the sides of the
ditch so you can drive through it. The fun ones are concrete.

Warning signs of any sort are for wussies, too, so you'll be cruising along
about 50 (to smooth out the washboards) and one of these ditches will come
out of nowhere--you'll go airborne if you don't pay attention.

Two different times I was in a car that hit one of those things without
slowing down, once in a Toyota truck and once in an old Datsun sedan. Both
of them survived unscathed but the girl who was sleeping in the back seat
of the Datsun was not amused one bit. ;)  I don't know what would happen if
you did this in a Vanagon but I bet it isn't pretty; they're heavy.

Tres. Mexicans in general and Mexican mechanics in particular are extremely
industrious. They're familiar with VWs, and they can fix anything if they
want to. If they can't find it they can fabricate it, and if they can't
fabricate it they know somebody who can. Don't pay them up front and don't
listen to a word of their advice, of which they have lots. Pay for
performance. The job may be hackneyed but it will keep you moving.

Quatro. Before you go to sleep, if things are not going well, you and
Whitney may observe in spite of it all, &quot;Hooper envies us.&quot;
