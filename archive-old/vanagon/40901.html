Subject: Header Exhausts

 
I'm interested in installing a header exhaust system on my '69 bus. What
exactly is involved in the procedure?
Most of the headers I've seen leave the heater traps wide open, what do
you do with those holes?
I'm am leaning towards a dual quiet pack exhaust, but am looking for
help/suggestions in purchasing a header.
 
Just some added daily brain pickin' from Jason.
