Subject: Help, my wallet's always empty...

 My gas mileage has hit an all-time low of 14 mpg. I have a 72' 1700
and I'm at my wits end as to how to get more miles for the buck. I've
changed the ignition system completely (i.e. brand new), I've checked
the compression and its A-OK and I've changed the cut-off jets in the
carburator. All of these things were done on the advice of
mechanics... What I have not yet attempted is a carb equalization. I
didn't think it needed one because the engine runs like a Swiss
timepiece. Any suggestions? Is the &quot;volume control&quot; screw really just 
an idle mixture screw? If not, then is there a volume control screw on
the passenger's side carb? AAArgh, I hate not being able to drive my VW...

 &quot;They all err; Muslim, Christian, and Jew
   Two make up humanity's universal sect,
  One man, intelligent without religion
   The other, religious without intellect.&quot;
               - Ma'arri (1057)

 &quot;The plague of man is the opinion of knowledge. That is why ignorance
is so recommended by our religion as a quality suitable to belief
and obedience.&quot;
 &quot;Man is certainly crazy. He could not make a mite, and he makes gods
by the dozen.&quot;
