Subject: VW-'85 WESTY-NEED A PROTECTIVE MUD FLAP

I'm an ex-Vanagon newsgroup member (so please respond to 
nickpace_at_rand_dot_org via email) but my friend asked me to see if anyone 
knew where she could obtain what she describes as &quot;the protective flap 
on the driver's side that prevents mud and junk from getting on the 
propane tanks and other stuff&quot; for her '85 Westy Vanagon.  I asked her 
if she meant an ordinary set of wheel well mud flaps but she 
emphatically said no.  The thing she wants is a single special unit that 
is only on the driver's side and whose purpose is only to prevent junk 
from hitting the accessories under the body.  She says that the price of 
a new one is steep.

Any ideas where to get one?

Thanks,

Nick
