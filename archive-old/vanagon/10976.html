So Doug Shapter says:
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, I thought the folks on the list could appreciate my plight. I 
&gt; wish I could say that I pulled the carb down  and fixed it a la Muir, 
&gt; but the circumstances really didn't allow it. oh well.
&gt; 

I think everyone on the list would agree that what you did (considering 
the circumstances) was the right thing to do.  I think Muir wouldn't 
even hesitate to take the same steps you did.  The priority was to
get the f--- outta there ASAP and that's what you did.  Good show!

Cheers!
