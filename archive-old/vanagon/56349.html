Subject: No catalytic converter??!!

Greetings Everyone,

I just changed the ball joints on my 83 WB Westy. Not really that bad of a
job. I got a new exhaust elbow and all new gaskets to fix a nasty leak. My
westy was loud and I thought it was because of the hole in the pipe. I took
care in taking the pipes apart. When I looked into the cat to see if it was
still in one piece it was hollow. That explains why the mechanic who
inspected it last year was pulling his hair out because he couldn't get it
to pass no matter what. Does anyone know if this would cause the motor to
run differently. I still haven't figured out why the idle is erratic. I
popped the top off of the AFM and moved the contacts and I noticed that the
carbon surface has a flake missing where the contact sits at idle. Also,
there was a drop of coolant on one of the heads. Are they supposed to be
retorqued after the gaskets have been redone. I had both heads done about 6
months ago. Thanks to all who offered advice about my idle. I still can't
figure it out. :(
Any advice is greatly appreciated.

dave
