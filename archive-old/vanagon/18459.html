Paul I must agree with you, most Grateful Dead bus owners destroy more 
buses than they save. Yes there are a few nice buses on tour, but the
majority are being trashed. I drive a bus everyday and it is not a 
total restoration. But you can tell someone cares about it. My opinion 
is the Grateful Dead crowd destroy more buses than they save.

&gt;&gt; Got drug to a Dead show last night and saw a guy selling t-shirts with the

&gt;&gt; Fukenbroken
&gt;
&gt;I saw this on Spring tour in Charlotte NC
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Didn't buy one out of various karmic concerns (ask and ye shall receive),
&gt;&gt; but looking at the state of the busses being driven by most Deadheads
&gt;&gt; (primarily extremely tired mid-70s campers, only saw one decent splittie),
&gt;&gt; it seemed spot on appropriate.
&gt;
&gt;I agree about the karma, but I do have a VW/Grateful Dead tshirt that 
&gt;says&quot;FarFromMovin': If you've owned a Volkswagen you've experienced it&quot;.
&gt;
&gt;But really Paul, everyone doesn't own busses to dump lots of money into 
&gt;them or do a full resoration - many still own them because they can 
&gt;maintain them themselves and they are great vehicles to live in
&gt;
&gt;And there are many nice vans in the lot at Dead shows - I've got pictures 
&gt;to prove it!
