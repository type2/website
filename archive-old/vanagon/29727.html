===&gt;$3500&lt;====
I've got a 1980 VW Westfalia Vanagon.  This is the factory camperized
type, the &quot;square corners&quot; 80's model, not the older &quot;rounded&quot; 70's type. 
Its GEART for camping.  It spent most of its life in California so the
body is good (e.g., in terms of rust).  Its got about 100k miles on it. 
It currently needs some repairs, something like a blocked fuel line, so
its not running right now, (also needs a few less immeadiate things like a
new battery) but I've been thinking of of selling it anyway, so I thought
I'd see if anyone is interested in it &quot;as is&quot; for the above price.  A van
like this in good shape is definately worth several thousand more.

If interested, please contact me by e-mail
