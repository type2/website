&gt;
&gt;Very funny stuff.  Your list is as nerdy as any of the science
&gt;ones I read.  My feeling is of course to throw it out since it is
&gt;so cheap, and at best would taste a little stale  (if it has been
&gt;opened).  If never opened, it is OK.  Forget the stuff about the
&gt;mold that one person mentioned -- there is a great scare about a
&gt;fungus which produces carcinogenic aflatoxins and which grows on the
&gt;paper thin skin on peanuts.  These skins are removed for pnut butter
&gt;production, and all large companies measure the resulting aflatoxin
&gt;content in their processed product, and keep it at safe levels.  The
&gt;worst that can happen, once the jar is opened is that O2 in the air
&gt;will make the peanut oil rancid, and the butter taste bad.
&gt;
&gt;The post about stablilizers is also misleading:  these compounds are
&gt;emulsifiers.  That is, they act like soap -- they do not allow the oil and
&gt;water components to separate.  They do not &quot;stablilize&quot; the product
&gt;in any other way, such as making it more resistant to spoilage.
&gt;
&gt;I'll speak to you soon.
&gt;Paul.
