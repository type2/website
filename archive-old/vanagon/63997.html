Subject: |'81 vanagon turbo dream
Date: Mon, 18 Aug 1997 21:59:16 +0200

I own a '81 Vanagon, 1600 cc diesel. We have dubbed it the Volkswagen XLA
(eXtremely Lazy Automobile).  Since the car is in excelent condition
bodywise (it is really very pretty, fire-engine red) I would like to keep
it. However, every day I hope that when I wake up in the morning  I find =
a
turbo under the hood.

No kidding, any of you know if it is possible to retrofit a turbo to the
standard engine. Is it feasible or total nonsens and should I start looki=
ng
for another vehicle instead.

(BTW, are fire-engines red in the US of A? I mean the old style red that
you would find on fire engines in England and Europe in the fifties. Now
they are more of a fluorescant orange).
