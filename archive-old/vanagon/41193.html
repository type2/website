Subject: New VW  history book out....ITS GREAT!

Hi Vanagoners &amp; Bussers!
    I dropped in at Borders last nite &amp; found a GREAT book. Tis 
called &quot;VOLKSWAGEN CHRONICLE&quot;. This is the BEST book I've seen.  
History from day one up to the new Beetle.   Some bugs &amp; buses ya 
might recognise in it...the coral '58 california  bug was in one 
ofthe mags...it's in the book now. Covers ALL models; including 
Porsche and Audi. It's gotta cool pix of the 4 generations of type 2s.
 
Color photos, except for the vintage pix of the Hitler(at least he 
did ONE good thing.....)and the type 32s,etc.  
Book info:
VW Chronicle   By Graham Robson
216 pages. Published by Publications International,Ltd. 1996.
ONLY $14.95(Border's had it for $13.49) not a bad deal for this NICE 
book! CHECK IT OUT!!!!!!!!!!!!
