Subject: Re-organization of rec.autos.vw, PLEASE READ


Sorry to bother everyone with this not-exactly-VANAGON-related posting...

rec.autos.vw is the Usenet news group dedicated to discussions about  
VW's.  It is a very high bandwidth group and currently no distinction is  
made between aircooled and watercooled VW's (or any VW's for that matter).

Recently discussions have been taking place about the creation of a  
rec.autos.vw.aircooled sub-group.  Based on this, it has come to our  
attention that a full-blown re-organization of rec.autos.vw must take  
place.  The new group should be part of the rec.autos.makers.* tree, and  
should have separate groups for different types of VW's.

We are unsure of the best organization for the new groups.  The simplest  
breakdown suggests the following:

   rec.autos.makers.vw.aircooled
   rec.autos.makers.vw.watercooled
   rec.autos.makers.vw.misc

However this does not take into account Bus and Vanagon discussions since  
these vehicles are both aircooled and watercooled -- some say that  
aircooled buses could communicate in the aircooled group and the same for  
watercooled.  But the vanagon mailing list is evidence of the fact that  
there are many issues that are unique to buses/vanagons which may warrant  
creating a separate group for this traffic:

   rec.autos.makers.vw.aircooled
   rec.autos.makers.vw.watercooled
   rec.autos.makers.vw.vanagon
   rec.autos.makers.vw.misc

However the ambiguity between aircooled and watercooled buses/vanagons  
may make this breakdown too confusing, for example if you are a bus owner,  
where do you post your question?  Furthermore, there is a separate  
mailing list for Audis (the QUATTRO mailing list).  Audi is a sister  
company to VW and the cars use many of the same parts, maintenance  
techniques, etc.  Some say that discussions about such derivative vehicles  
(including Porsche) could take place in the .misc group, others say that  
a separate .audi group should be made.

This brings me to my reason for making this posting.  I'm collecting  
feedback from YOU, the VANAGON subscriber that is interested in helping us  
make this decision.  If you have any opinions about this breakdown, or  
any suggestions about how it should be done, please mail them to me at  
randy_at_id_dot_com.  I am collecting information and will be sure to keep you in  
the loop on future discussions if you contact me.

Looking forward to hearing from you!
