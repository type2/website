Subject: RE: advice needed-rebuilding engine-`74 camper-part II

Ben Orlock wants to know what he's in for.  This is a tough call, as I want
to encourage the VW hobby but avoid sending Ben into months of frustration.
If you could be confident that the engine needed top end work only, I would
be quicker to recommend that you jump right in.  Or if you could find a used
engine that's guaranteed to run.  I guess what worries me is that you will
be putting in a huge number of hours before you've been able to bond with the
bus by running it a little.  See if you can't get a &quot;success fix&quot; early on,
that will tide you over during the dark days of front suspension or fuel
system horrors.

But the basic idea -- putting a family 74 back on the road your very own
self -- is great.  Good luck; keep us posted, even if it takes three
postings per message.

B.
