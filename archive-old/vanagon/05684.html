&gt; &gt; 	The oil consumption confirms it. You need, at least,
&gt; &gt; new oil seals on you valves. That's why the seller is supposed to do
&gt; &gt; the smog check, and you've just convinced me that I'll have anything I
&gt; &gt; consider buying smogged BEFORE I make a final offer. 
&gt; 
&gt; This may be an urban (californian?) legend, but when I was shopping for
&gt; a car here in CA (I'm recent transplant), I was told that the seller had
&gt; to (by law) give a smog certificate with the car, or else they would be
&gt; liable for any repairs needed to smog the car.
&gt; 
&gt; The Syncro I bought came with a smog certificate.  If you're buying a used
&gt; car in CA, it might pay to visit DMV and ask them about who's liable for
&gt; repairs to a used car that doesn't pass smog.

Funny you should mention that- this spring  when we bought our westy in CA we
were told by
the owner that he would produce a certificate. It turned out that he had
lost it, however we were told by DMV not too worry they would provide a
licence for the car but that if we should be stopped we would have to
produce a smog certificate or at least promise to produce one at a later
date (no joke). This was in Redwood, CA. In other
words they encouraged us to not have the vehicle smogged but nevertheless
drive it. The risk was ours. We eventually had the vehicle smogged with the
new engine in it and everyone was happy. The previous owner did not have
to produce a certificate, DMV eventually had one more cleaner car on the
road and we could drive fully legal.

What makes this bizarre state of affairs even stranger in my opinion is
that CA cars are not required to be &quot;safetied&quot;. They can be the cleanest
but most unsafe cars on the road...example - car drives through
intersection kills two pedestrians. Driver of vehicle had not replaced the
brake pads on the car ever and the  metal on the pads could not stop the
car...etc etc etc. DC
