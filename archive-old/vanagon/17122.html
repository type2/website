Subject: CB Antennas and stuff


We were thinking of hooking up the old CB on our next trip out with the 
'85 Westy.  Does anyone have any ideas for antenna mounting/locations.  
Magneticare out because of the fiberglass top.  Has anyone done any side 
or bumper mounts, if so how did it work out, and where did you run the 
wires.  Also, any good radio mounting ideas?  Thanks!
