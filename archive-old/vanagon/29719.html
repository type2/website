&gt; Hello all, This weekend I decided to remove my rear brake drums to

James, the '71 does in fact have two peice drums. I don't know about 
taking them off by removing the 11 mm nuts. All I've ever done was remove 
the &quot;mondo&quot; axle nut to take off the drums. Still, it wasn't easy; I had 
a stuck emergency brake.

One tip, keep an eye out for good replacement drums. I understand that 
ours are expensive and hard to come by when you need them. I still don't 
have any spares, though.

Best of luck removing them when and if you need to.
