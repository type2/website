Subject: Help! Jetta repairs

Hello all, my first post and under such dire circumstances. My girlfriend
has 1987 Jetta GLI. It is at a reputable vw mechanic's shop right NOW! 
Repairs needed: new brake pads and rotors on all four wheels - $345 and new
calipers for emergency brake - $180. It needs a new muffler, fuel
injectors need to cleaned and possibly replaced, and the battery does not
stay charged (the alternator is OK and battery is new). We trust the
mechanic (Broadway Foreign Car - Knoxville, TN).

Here is the question: Do we sell the car &quot;as is&quot; or do we have it fixed
and then sell it? The car has 112,000 miles on it. The body, paint and
interior are in great shape.

As i mentioned, the car is in the shop as i write -- any top-of-the-head
advice would be greatly appreciated. Please respond directly or post to
the type2 list. Thanks alot in advance.
