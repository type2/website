&gt;I decided to do a spot 
&gt;census on my daily commute, 3 miles on a bike from the U of W to Phinney 
&gt;Ridge.  On average I see about 21 VW busses, 2/3 of which are bay 
&gt;windows, and the rest are Vanagons.  I average less than one EV, and less 
&gt;than one Splitty.  BTW not one for sale sign. 
&gt;        This is probably not a good average for Seattle as a whole, I 
&gt;probably live in a high bus area, inter city middle class neighborhood 
&gt;near a university.

Compare that to my count during Christmas vacation.  I drove I-95 from
Trenton, NJ to Raleigh, NC and back (about 700 miles of highway
driving), and saw only 3 Vanagons and 1 bay window in 14+ hours.
Probably also not representative, because I'm sure a lot of people
wouldn't drive their East Coast rustbuckets on Christmas vacation, but
use them only for local driving.  Still, I like your numbers better!
