Subject: '84 Vanagon for sale (fwd)

1984 Vanagon RWD  
driven for 203,419 miles.
second engine with new fuel-injection system has about 100,000 miles on it. 
4 brand new BFGoodrich Radial All-Terrain tires (no hubcaps).

this vanagon has not been beaten or abused in any way (save the rear 
speakers that my mom broke off while loading branches into the back) and 
needs a new home.  I am selling it because my dad has pulled all 
financial backing out of a deal that would get me a chevy 3.4 liter v6, 
and an assortment of odds and ends for the van.

i am selling (on behalf of my dad) it for $5,000 (if someone is REALLY 
desperate, i might be able to get by with at most $3500 off).

PLEASE BUY THIS VAN or else it will be given away to a local 
charity/chop-shop for tax incentives. 

if you need any more information, please feel free to e-mail me at any 
time or call me at home between 7 pm and 10 pm, monday through saturday.


my e-mail address is: cdes_at_welchlink.welch.jhu_dot_edu
home phone:(410)744-1685
for 24-hour voicemail call:(410)617-2395 the answering machine will pick 
up after 4 rings.
