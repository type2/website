Subject:  Improved fuel additive  ZVW 239 003

Research by Volkswagen AG and other manufacturers has shown that the
performance of todays gasoline engines is directly influenced by the
type and quality of fuel used.

Fuel without the proper additives can cause deposits to collect on
fuel injectors, intake ports and valves.

This build-up of deposits can cause the following conditions:
     * unstable idle                    * power loss
     * surging                          * engine run-on
     * misfiring                        * pinging/knocking

Extent of deposit build-up varies depending on type of fuel used,
operating condition, etc.  Refer to current Technical Information
Circulars for description of deposit grading system.

PREVENTION
Prevent deposit build-up through the use of gasolines with injector
and intake valve deposit control additives.
Consult the suppliers and service stations in your area about fuel
grades and additives that prevents or removes these two deposits. &lt;sic&gt;

In areas where gasoline containing deposit control additives are
unavailable, light deposits can be controlled as follows:

* add one 6.5 oz. bottle of Autobahn Gasoline Additive,
  P/N:  ZVW 239 003.

Note:  Fill fuel tank completely.  Do not refill until fuel gauge
       reads 1/4 tank or less.

REMOVAL
Moderate to heavy deposits can also be removed with Autobahn Gasoline
Additive, P/N:  ZVW 239 003.
When used as follows this additive has shown to be effective.

* Check fuel injector spray pattern.  Purge injection system with G-16
  cleaner.  Refer to current Technical Information Circulars for
  injection purge instructions.

* Check that fuel and ignition systems are within specifications.

* Add three (3) 6.5 oz bottles of Autobahn Gasoline Additive,
  P/N: ZVW 239 003 for each of three (3) consecutive fill-ups or
  1000 miles.

Heavy deposit concentration may require 2 or 3 cycles of the above
treatment.

Note:  Fill fuel tank completely.  Do not refill until fuel gauge
       reads 1/4 tank or less.

* Deposit removal with Autobahn Gasoline Additive, P/N: ZVW 239 003
  is more efficient with engine at operating temperature and at
  moderate speed, short distance driving conditions.

* Because of possible contamination of the oil,  the filter and oil
  must be changed at the conclusion of each removal cycle.
