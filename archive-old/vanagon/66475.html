Subject:      Re: only 3 pistions are firing

&gt;&gt; When I start up my van in the morning, I sense only 3 pistions are
&gt;&gt; firing.  When I rev it a  little, it's even more obvious not all 4
&gt;&gt; pistons are firing.

While I don't know what this sounds like, it could be a stuck lifter.
The engine sounds horrible until the lifter gets unstuck, then it sounds
fine. Try an oil change and see if that makes it go away.
