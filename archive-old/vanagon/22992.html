Subject: MORE Smells like PHish...


My wife just came up with an addition to the discussion relative
to the Grateful Dead heir's apparent...the PHISH...

Will the followers of the PHISH be known as PHISHheads?


Fish heads, fish heads, rolly polly fish heads..
fish heads, fish heads, eat them up...yum!!
