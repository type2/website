I would like to extend an apology to all who had to wade through the message
that I sent yesterday to my friend Jim. Through your help he has guided me in
the purchase of the VW that I spoke of yesterday. To all who replyed to his
message, I say &quot;thank you&quot;.  As for the SHOUTING, well all I can say is that
there will always be among us, those just starting out, and we WILL make
mistakes.                     GHLINKE_at_scarolina_dot_edu
