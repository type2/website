Subject: ccc's in s. CA update!


First of all, thanks to the VERY many of you with your kind invitations to
meet, go to a restaurant, have a place to stay, etc.  I'm truly overwhelmed,
and it's GREAT to have so many friends!  :)  

Because this trip is unfortunately so last minute and so short in duration,
I/we can't possibly go to each place (though I'd love to, and will try to
do this eventually on further trips), so after talking with Schwarze and
Bradley, I'm going to propose the following idea, which will hopefully let
as many of us as possible get together in one place at one time, and go
do something fun together.  

Here's the plan.  Let's meet outside Dave Schwarze's place on this Saturday
morning at 11, and go en masse for lunch, perhaps in San Diego, or wherever
the democracy decides.  Then, lets park near the border, and walk across
to Tijuana (the idea is to avoid driving, so that we don't have to get 
stuck waiting in car lines to return).  Some of us want to pick up some
blankets/tequila/kahluah/etc., and would like to spend maybe 2 hours there.
Then, we'll walk back (we might even be able to visit the VW dealerships
there!) over the border into CA, and will then need to depart the San Diego
area at around 4 p.m. Saturday, as at least a few of us have stuff we've
got to be back here for on Sunday morning and afternoon.

Hope this sounds ok - it's the best thing I can think of to be fair to
get as many of us together at one place to enjoy the cameraderie.  E-mail
me and I'll send you directions to Dave Schwarze's place (he said I could),
with his phone number.  I'm trying to avoid bothering Dave with having to
do this, although if you need directions after Thursday afternoon, you'll
HAVE to mail Schwarze for them, because my being already on the road
will preclude my being able to send them to you.

See you all this Saturday morning at 11 a.m., at Schwarze's place, I hope!

Btw, Dave has a very busy weekend, with prior committments he can't break,
and so he'll not be able to be with us for much past the lunch and offers
his apologies in advance.  This was a sort of last minute thing, so we're
just making do and putting it together the best we can at this point.

Thanks, everyone!
