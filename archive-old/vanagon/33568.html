None of my vehicles are named `Westfalia' or `Westphalia'.  I always
spell `Gerbil' and `Wombat' correctly.  I believe I even get
`Volkswagen' right most of the time.  However, in the interest of
lowering the aggregate world blood pressure a picobar or two, I've
fixed the spelling of all entries on the Bus Bits page
(http://www.village_dot_org/vw/parts).
