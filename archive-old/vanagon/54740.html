&gt;&gt; If you do need head gaskets kits, I have them for $135 for the pair 
&gt;&gt; (German) if you can't find a comparable price locally.
&gt;&gt; Good luck (I've been there...:(

Ken,
It's a complete kit.  It contains basically everything you need to do a 
complete head gasket job, including all gaskets, pushrod tube seals, water 
pump seal, upper and lower cylinder seals, etc. Recently the kits have even 
been including the sealant you put on the heads.  The price of $135 is for 
2 kits, to do 2 heads.
-Ron
