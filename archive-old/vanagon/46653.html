Subject: Looking for aftermarket instrumentation

Looking for two things for my newly-acquired 87 Westy: a *real* oil
temperature gauge, and a tach.  I feel a little underinformed up there
in the cockpit.  I'd like to rip the clock right out of there and
replace it with something useful.

Any suggestions?
