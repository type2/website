Actually I had a 1991 extended awd Astro van and it was impressive in the
crappy weather we get in Southern Ontario.  Never got it stuck even when I
tried.  It was warm and comfortable, except for my left foot, and very
reliable....but it sure wasn't a Westy!!

&gt; On that note, I've seen two GMC Safari AWD running around (very nice
&gt; looking truck, for a domestic). Looks like the domestic market is seeing
&gt; that even van people like AWD too! Maybe VW will follow?????

&gt; &gt; This Mercedes Benz/VW project looks very interesting (and exceedingly
&gt; &gt; expensive).
