 Hi: A friend of mine is a horse vet. One of his acquaintances is a guy
that picks up dead livestock. We all think this car testing is a joke
(especially when a friend of mine slipped the tester 5 bucks to let his
73 bus pass at a state controled facility) Well, this guy was furious at
having the inconvience of having to take his rendering truck over to get
it tested so they could get his 12 bucks so a couple of weeks ago he
made sure the truck was filled with stock and off he went on a rather
warm day. Now, you have to understand that a load of dead livestock is
not a pretty sight (it is amazing to me anyone will do this job, but
someone has to), stuff drips out from under the truck and all.
Apparently he didn't have to spend much time at the test station (they
didn't do much of a test; got his 12 bucks though) and passed just fine.
He said the station probably still smells. Maybe this isn't such a good
idea but if you put a couple of dead cows in your vanagon when you go to
have it tested.........
