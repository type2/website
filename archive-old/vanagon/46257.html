Subject: Unhappy CAMPER

        Me, not my '78 pop top VW camper.

        I am a newish VW camper owner of a clean '78 camper.  Got it from
the proverbial 'little old lady' who only drove it on Sundays for the last
few years.  Got it last August '95, and put less than 3K miles on it.  Now
has just over 100,000 miles, runs strong, minor rust, original paint (green
- with various patches of yellow_green).  

        I have a 10 year old girl, 13 year old boy, wife, and use the VW for
Saturday sports events with the kids (soccer and lacrosse), and 5 overnight
trips with the family. Surprisingly, my wife (Korean) likes the camper.  No
complaints so far. 

        I have bunches of questions regarding the '78 camper, but I want to
share with the 'group' my present disappointment.

        I saw a picture of a neat set of wheels/rims in a trade magazine;
the 'Teddy Bear' wheels offered by ROLAN (they have an 800 number).  Called,
and was informed that the 'Teddy Bear' and OTHER ANIMAL wheels were for the
4 bolt wheels, and were intended for lighter weight vehicles than my camper.
(Already, I'm posting cute little stickers on the windows, like Easter
Bunny, Scarecrows, and other Nursery styled appliques.  I'm into 'cute' this
year.)

        I know now that I cannot get the 'Teddy Bear' wheels, so I am asking
the 'group' for suggestions. I was going to try to rechrome my original set
of wheels, but that might be unwise.

        Any one have any sugestions?  ((I am over 55, retired Navy, with a
young family.  In my past, I have owned some precious cars - 55 Merc, 57
Vette, 63 Split Window Coupe, 59 MGA + 59 MGA - and some not_so_precious
cars - 58 Edsel, 60 Ramler, 60 Renault 4CV.  I have permission and
encouragement from the misses to look at a 72 Vette convertable (65K miles)
and a 78 Vette Pace Car (24K miles)  My moniker 'PRAY4ME' is the label name
I gave my computer's hard drive, the second time I did a hard disk format))

        Sorry, no snappy signature block yet.  Just --&gt;&gt; 
        Barry Burneskis sends his best from Springfield VA.
