&gt; &gt; It says (if it can be believed) that when the bus is going 70 mph, the engine
&gt; &gt; is going 3,800 rpm.  75 mph = 3,900 rpm &amp; 80 mph = 4,000 rpm.
&gt; 
&gt; This actually sounds fairly normal.  My '66 does about 3600 _at_ 60, and
&gt; about 4000 _at_ 70.  I have a slightly higher 4th than stock also.

We have a 1973 trasnsmission in one of our vans and a VDO tach

80 mph = 4,000 rpm.
75 mph = 3,750 rpm.
70 mph = 3,500 rpm.
65 mph = 3,250 rpm.
etc.

As you can see, the tach reading is 50 times the mph.
