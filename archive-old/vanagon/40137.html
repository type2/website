&gt;i can't believe the saga, there seem to be so many people falling 
over 
&gt;themselves to rescue this &quot;free&quot; bus that iy is actually might be 
worth 
&gt;something.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;hope that somebody grabs it real soon before it gets expen$ive!
&gt;
&gt;keep us posted
&gt;

Well, let's see... a 6 hour round trip drive (at these new higher 
gasoline prices!!), plus rental of a towbar, and a day off work to 
pick up a bus that is not a deluxe, has severe rust, and hasn't 
rolled for 20 years? (Could be a hassle just getting it towable.)  
Marginally worth it for free, not worth it for a price.  The Pa. 
contingent is no longer falling over himself to get this bus.  I'm 
glad I read this post before heading out.  Think I'll hold out for 
a closer one, or one in better shape (maybe a deluxe?), if I'm 
going to pay anyway.  Just left a note on the door of a house with 
a '65 single cab in the yard, just as horribly rusted, last 
inspected in '84.  Wonder if it's free?
