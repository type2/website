Howdy all. Itried to post something before the holidays, but it
bounced...
Anyway, as some of you have noticed, the shirts went out in two batches
(actually 3)
One batch went out Wednesday before Thanksgiving, and the other
Yesterday. (The overseas/Canadian orders go out today...)
Anyway, glad those of you that have them already like them, and I hope
everyone else does too.
I am still sorting out the extra situation, so I'll post that as I find
out.
Anyway, I am looking into doing stickers next, so let's see how the mood
goes for those.
Also anyway, all you Triangle folks, we need to do another dinner thing
so you can all get your shirts! Let's figure out something...
Happy Bussing.
Richard
