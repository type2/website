&gt; Porsche mounted it in the sump (albeit with a different plate).  If it's
&gt; good enough for Porsche, it's good enough for this bus owner.  Besides
&gt; that, I think Berg and Fischer made a big boo-boo.  Here's why I think
&gt; that.
&gt; 
&gt; Did you know that the tip of the dipstick is less than an inch from where
&gt; the sender would be if it were mounted in the sump plate?  It's true.  If
&gt; you remove the sump plate and look up in there, you will see the tip of the
&gt; dipstick.  It's right there ('72 - '82 air cooled type IV engines).
&gt; 
&gt; The Porsche sump plate positions the sender a little higher in the case and
&gt; at an angle, when compared to the bus sump plate with a hole drilled in it.
&gt; When I installed the Porsche sump plate, I had to cut the bottom of my
&gt; dipstick off because it hit the sender.  After that experience, I don't
&gt; think there is anything that could convince me that the dipstick sender is
&gt; any better.  Plus, I don't like having wires dangling around in my engine
&gt; compartment.

THANK YOU!, for finally presenting a valid argument on this subject! I 
always found it hard to beleive that the air would cool the sump any 
more than any other part of the engine. Besides, if that was the case, 
wouldn't the temp gauge almost immediatley jump up 20-30 degrees at idle 
after a long run on the highway? Mine don't!
