]I saw that clip, and it was indeed a Vanagon.  The way it looked to me,
]the Vanagon was parked a couple of car lengths in front of the motorhome.
]The tank was doing about 30mph down a side street and veered over next to
]the curb striking the Vanagon head on.  The vanagon was pushed into (and
]when I say INTO I mean INTO!) the Motorhome and then the tank rolled over
]both of them.  It was more like an explosion - spontaneous vanagon combustion
] - he hit them so hard.  That vanagon didn't have a prayer, even if the
]motorhome hadn't been there it woulda been toast.  They said a total of 35
]vehicles were destroyed along with 8 traffic signs and 5 fire hydrants.

Popular topic.  Over on the Z-car list (wife's buggy) they're talking
about the yellow Z that got pancaked by the tank.  I wonder how many
other Internet lists are right now discussing how many of THEIR favorite
toy were removed from the population.
