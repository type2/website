To get even further off topic:  I worry about the PC trends in the
environmental movement.  Heck, we're all pretty intelligent people, right?
I just try to minimize my impact on the REST of the environment.  That's
right, in case people have forgotten, humans are a part of the environment.


I work in planetary science.  I've often wondered what we'll have to do
with the phrase &quot;take only pictures, leave only footprints&quot; when we FINALLY
get back to the moon to stay.  There, footprints are trash that won't go
away for millions of years.  Also, people are NOT part of the environment.
Not yet, at least.
