Subject: awning for Westie

Scott and Joby,
        I recently bought a Westie which came with an A&amp;E Catalina 2500
awning. I havn't had a chance to use it yet but it looks to be of high
quality and hopefully will use it in the Florida Keys this March or April.
It can be viewed and priced in the latest Camping World spring
catalog.1-800-626-5944.
