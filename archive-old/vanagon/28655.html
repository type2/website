Subject: Re: To wear a bra or not to wear a bra, that is the questi

I'll keep any smart comments to myself and respond to this also. I've had bra
on my '87 since early in 1989 after starting to notice several chips in the
paint on the front. It's done a great job, especially since I'm not prone to
removing it often. A lot of crud builds up under the top part and on the
lower outside corners, but I try to rinse under the bra as much as
possible(WHEN I wash it). I have SLIGHT marks in the paint along a couple
areas at the top edge of the bra, but that's a whole lot better than a
zillion chips in the paint.

Mine's a cheapy whitney also, but with periodic armorall treatments, it has
held up real well. I'd definitely do it again.
