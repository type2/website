After I thought that a heater blower ballast resistor was blown and many 
folks said no, it was the heater switch, I checked it out and the list was 
right.  $4.?? list at the dealer.  $3.17 at Camelback VW including my local 
sales tax and vanagon list discount.

Puting it in and dealing with those ridiculous heater control sliders is a 
different story.
