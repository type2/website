Subject: synchro tire pressure?

a local acquaintance (w/o email access) has a Synchro within which the
transmission just siezed up. Place in Oregon (Euro-American Transmissions?)
sent him a new one. They also told him that it was very important to keep
the exact same tire brand,size, &amp; pressure on these vehicles to prevent
transmission wear. I expressed some skepticism, since the viscous coupling
would help to alleviate any stress one would normally see in a rigid-drive
system - but, maybe I'm wrong. I figured I'd come to the authorities - so
what's the scoop eh?
