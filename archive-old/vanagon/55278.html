&gt; 	This might cause problems if the Hall Sender unit sends one signal
&gt; per revolution of the distributor. The ecus adjust timing for each
&gt; cylinder (according to the Bentley FI manual), you would get the retard for
&gt; 3 happening to 1.

If we're talking a vanagon engine here, there is no retard built into
number 3.  That's only on Type 1 engines.


&gt; 
&gt; You would also get the injectors possbily injecting at the wrong times if
&gt; they are grouped 1&amp;2 and 3&amp;4, but I do not remember how they are grouped. I
&gt; kind of doubt they are grouped like this, and would think they are grouped
&gt; 1&amp;3 and 2&amp;4 so the pulses correspond with the opening of the valves...
&gt; Something to look into though...

The injectors on the FI system (at least on the L-Jetronic) all open at
the same instant, they're not grouped in pairs.  The injectors fire with
every other opening of the points, I'm sure the Hall system has a
similar method of firing the injectors.  But all four fire at the same
time.
