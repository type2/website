Ditto to what Rob said about Volks Cafe,  I have had many good experiences
dealing with Volks Cafe is Santa Cruz and Kyle.

&gt; 
&gt; A while back I ordered a used speedo from Volks Cafe (with a repaired
&gt; odometer).  I would like the list to know about my satisfaction.
&gt; 
&gt; When the speedo arrived, there was a problem with it, but correspondence
&gt; with Kyle showed that he was willing to work with me to keep a customer
&gt; happy.  The speedo was sent back and repaired.  
&gt; 
&gt; Tuesday, my family and I were in the bay area visiting our son and we
spent
&gt; the day in Santa Cruz.  We decided to stop and visit Volks Cafe while we
&gt; were in town.  Got a chance to meet Kyle and pick up the speedo.  
&gt; 
&gt; We arrived just as Kyle left for lunch, but he came right back, wrapped
the
&gt; speedo for travel, etc.  The whole experience was a pleasure!
