Subject:      Dometic gas cooling problems

I've got the no cooling on gas but works OK on 120VAC problem with my
Dometic refrigerator.  The exhaust tubes are clear, the burner and jet
(#24) are clean, the regulator is working OK (11.5&quot;WC), the bypass orifice
on the thermostat is clean, the burner lights OK, and the flame is a nice
blue color but not real bright.  the thermostat changes the size of the
flame when it is adjusted.  I also have the small 12V Radio Shack fan
mounted on top of the evaporator unit inside the refrigerator.  The
external fan cycles some while running on gas but runs more while running
on 120VAC.

The thing just doesn't seem to want to get any colder than 50 degrees (with
70 degrees outside temperature) while operating on gas although it will
cool to 27 degrees F while running on 120VAC.  What's going on?  What else
could I check?

I'm going to increase the circulation behind the cabinet with a couple of
3&quot; Radio Shack fans in addition to the original fan.  Does anyone know if
it is possible to keep the fins on the back TOO cool for the system to
operate efficiently?

Any suggestions?
