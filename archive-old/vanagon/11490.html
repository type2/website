So Erik Soule says:
&gt; &gt; top.  It is important to do an oil change after a burning these 
&gt; &gt; cleaners as the deposits end up in the oil.  Just my 0.02 worth.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I doubt anyone can prove or dispute the Techroline theory, but I have one 
&gt; question:
&gt; 
&gt; How do the deposits end up in your oil? 

I would think most of it would be burned during combustion or in the
catalytic convertor and some residue would end up in the oil via the
EGR system but not much.
