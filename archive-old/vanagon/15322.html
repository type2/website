Subject: Belly Pan Saga(was re: Kelly Park...)


&gt;&gt;Real 23 and 21 window deluxes had a belly pan which covered the entire
&gt;&gt;under belly (between the wheel wells) and was added to strengthen the bus
&gt;&gt;due to the sunroof and possibly because of the add'l windows. I believe 
&gt;&gt;that
&gt;&gt;15 window vans did not have the belly pans as the usual stock config.

&amp;&amp;i might add my $0.02 (rapidly depreceating Canadian dollar) i think the
&amp;&amp;pans we are referring to are slightly different. Some 68-79 Kombi's and
&amp;&amp;Westy's had the belly pans that fit under the middle of the van to cover
&amp;&amp;the heater tube etc. whereas the splits had a pan that bolted underneath
&amp;&amp;the front pedals etc. to keep the cables free of road grime. do others know
&amp;&amp;more than i (entirely likely!!!!!!). Were there &quot;skid plates&quot; or whatever
&amp;&amp;you want to call them available on post 68' vans (i,e,the pan that bolts
&amp;&amp;underneath the the cab section's pedals and cables?

If these do exist for the 68-71 (or later) breadloaves, I'd sure like 
them.  Nothing like driving on a slushy day and getting delayed responses 
from both clutch and accelerator pedals--scary!!  Plus, I imagine some 
reduction in engine/road noise...

Off to the Parts Yard!!
