Subject: question re: oil discussion '68 1600

Dear All,
Regarding these oil changes, 1500 miles=ok...20W50=ok 
but,  do you also pull 
the air cleaner, drain and 
clean the bowl and the copper (?) bird's nest looking stuff ?  And, how do 
you get that bird's nest looking stuff clean, really?  And, when does that 
whole deal have to get replaced?
Thanks,
Jody
