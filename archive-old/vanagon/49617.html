Before removing the injection pump, remove only the high pressure lines.
Glo-plugs are a snap with those lines removed. But you are right, it should
not be that difficult to start with the temps you mentioned. After running
the van and being certain that there are no air bubbles in the line to the
pump park it overnight. Check the line in the morning for bubbles while and
after cranking. If you now have bubbles odds are the seal behind the
injection pump pulley is allowing air to enter the fuel system. It's kind
of difficult removing the old seal. You have to be very careful not to
damage the shaft. I get seals from a diesel pump rebuilder a couple hundred
miles from me, UPS next day. Install the new seal and re time it and you're
on your way.
&gt;&gt;work in my car and come back and see what's wrong with the van - hard
&gt;starting, rough running, vibrates greatly.
&gt;
&gt;1): Check Glow plug fuse - OK
&gt;2)  disconnect power lead to glow plug buss, jump battery hot lead direct to
&gt;glow plug buss via 0-50 amp meter.  Only reads 30 amps, expect about 40 (9-10
&gt;amps per glow plug is nominal)
&gt;3)  Get the trusty Fluke out , and start checking glow plugs -- #4 OK,  #3
OK,
&gt;#1 OK, #2 Oh Sh- -!.
