Subject: Re: '68 front-end into '59 Bus? Disc brakes?

	My 66 bus came with a 68 fornt end on it but it did not have disc
brakes, however, i have been told it is possible to take the disc brakes
off a 71 bus.  My friend has a later bus fornt axle on his bus, i'm unsure
of what year and has disc brakes. I dont know if this is of any help since
you have a 59 but good luck.
