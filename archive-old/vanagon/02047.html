Subject: Re: Brake Drum Removing


----- Begin Included Message -----


So, I spent my Saturday morning trying to find out, why my hand brake doesn't
pull. Brake lining seems still o.k. (by peeking through hole), hand brake cable
has lots of tension on it. Thought I pull off the drum to inspect the inside.
Check out Bentley's pg. 46.7 and it tells me to:
	- release parking brake and loosen its equalizer
	- back off adjuster
Well, here we are. Through the hole in the back I can't look inside. So,
if I try to turn the adjuster wheel (which way, up or down?), I don't even
know what I'm touching.

Are there any tricks?

Thanks, Richard ('84 Vanagon)

Richard:

My 84 vanagon GL has gone through at least 3 times of pulling brake drums.
I had the same question you have. I wasted some time getting nowhere in
determining how to turn the adjusters. I then went ahead to pull the drums
without loosening any star wheels. I figured that if the wheels were able
to run it should be ok to pull them off.

I used a gear puller and they both came off without hassles. I did have to
loosen all star wheels later to push the drums back in though. You will find
out how to adjust them back while the drums are off.

Good luck.

David
