 &gt; I purchased my 84 van[...] If
 &gt; it was any other vehical it would be a huge LEMON!.  But instead, everyone
 &gt; always says &quot;It's a Vanagon.&quot;.  The heads have been replaced twice, 12/92
 &gt; and 12/94.  Here I am in 12/95 and I have to spend another $2,000 on
 &gt; rebuilding the whole engine, including new heads again. 

I've had remarkably little trouble with my '84.  We bought it used in 1990 or 
so from a VW dealer, who paid for the engine rebuild it needed the next week, 
but let us have *our* mechanic do it.  Other than that, and the recent fuel 
injection control box problems, it's just run and run and run.  Oh, and a new 
tranny at 150,000 miles.  Everything else has been minor: a heater control 
cable broke, the rear heater valve leaked, etc etc.

We love it.  It just goes.
