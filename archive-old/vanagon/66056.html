&gt; Hi all:
&gt;

&gt; So at some point I'm going to have to bite the bullet and fix this.  Can
&gt; anyone recommend a transmission rebuilder in the SF Bay Area (or Northern
&gt; California in general) or other reputable source for a replacement trans?
&gt;

Hi Tom: My recomendation would be I.T.S. Transmission Service in El
Cajon CA. Either Mike Thornton or Pat Bollendorf there should be able to
help you out. This shop has a great reputation through out the off road
racing crowd in southern CA, and there are no tougher clients to please.
I took my Syncro tranny clear from Washington to have them rebuild it.
It works like a charm and I thought the price was fair. The phone is
619-579-2601   Good luck. I read that someone else on the list uses
their services. How about it, good work? fair price? what do you think?
