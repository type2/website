I'm on digest mode, so I'm a little late to the party, but...


James Cohen Writes:
&gt;&gt;Garcia of the dead has nothing to do with VWs.  He was, however,
responsible for hooking thousands of people on drugs and cultivating a
lifstyle that glorified substance abuse. 

James, lighten up.  I think that people are responsible for their own
actions.  You would be right to say that Jerry was *associated* with drug
use, and even abuse.  But that is a far cry from &quot;responsible for hooking
thousands of people on drugs&quot;.  Jerry did one thing exceedingly well, by many
people's standards, he made music.  He is not responsible for the rest of his
fans' lives.

&gt;&gt; It is poetic justice that he died
of heart problems stemming from his years of drug use 

More like significant statistical probability than poetic justice.  That
being said, I personally know several people who have died from alcohol
abuse, but none from abuse of other drugs (other than nicotine).  If you're
against drug use because if its destructive nature, I assume you mean alcohol
and nicotine too.

&gt;&gt;  Lets have stickers which have to do with us and our
love of these vehichles.

As to the appropriateness of Garcia and a list sticker...not necessary.  I
would say that only about half the busses I see have no Grateful Dead
stickers  on them, so the conection is already made.  And yes, Zippy sports
one from his first show, Hampton VA, March 1986, I think.  He made many a
happy  trek thereafter.

The VW bus is a car for iconoclasts, a large number with a countercultural
bent.  That's just the way it is.  However, there seems to be an unusually
broad tolerance here on the list, this hundred hydra headed narrative
dialogue repair manual poetry .  Strength From Diversity!  Let's keep it that
way.
