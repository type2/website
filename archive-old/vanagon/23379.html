Subject:       Rattlin' Shift Lever

This is a repost, I guess, but it's been a couple of years since I last 
bothered you folks with it, and, heck, it's still bothering the heck out 
of me!  (And there's a fair amount of fresh diagnostic/fix-it talent out 
there now as well ;&gt;  )

It may seem trite and unimportant, but believe me it's ANNOYING, 
especially on long, peaceful (supposedly), cruises, like the one I've got 
coming up in a week or so:  A distinct (and now even occasionally loud) 
rattling noise coming from the shift lever in my '91 Westy (w/ manual 
transmission), when I'm driving in 3rd gear.  Sort of a tinny buzz.  It's 
also starting to do it on occasion in 4th.  Putting a little pressure up 
or down on the shift lever makes it go away (but can't drive continuously 
like that, of course).  Personally, it sounds to me like a loose pin or 
other small part in the linkage, vibrating in sync with the engine (I had 
a go-kart when I was a kid that made the same sound from the brake linkage 
- of course the go-kart made so much noise, it wasn't a problem ;&gt;  )

I've had my trusty VW Dealer mechanic look at it several times (the first 
few were freebies!), but they're not typically tuned into this kind of 
thing (pretty much in a Factory Manual groove) and haven't seemed very 
creative in their approaches.  Usually, they repack the linkage with 
grease and it goes away long enough to pass the test drive!  
Unfortunately, I'm not set up as a backyard mechanic - no ramps, tools, 
etc, and can't really get into it myself.  I have made an appointment to 
&quot;use&quot; one of their lifts next week, and hope to dig into it with the aid 
of one of their '30 year bus drivin' mechanics (who IS creative - he 
previously suggested adding some weight to the shift lever, which DID help 
quite a lot for a few thousand miles).  Also, Joel suggested installing a 
Borg 'Short-Shifter' kit, but being mechanically challenged, I didn't 
pursue this.  

Well, folks, any ideas on what's causing this hummer?  I'd be ETERNALLY 
grateful for any ideas on how to fix this little, but &gt;&gt;grating&lt;&lt;, problem.
