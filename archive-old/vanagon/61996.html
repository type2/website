Were there any answers to this thread?? This is something that I've been
thinking about doing after I get everything mechanical fixed. There does
come a point when everything is just running perfect/just the way you want
it right ??? But I guess most of the fun of having one is making it what
you want it to be :)

&gt; Hi!
&gt; 
&gt; First, I luv my bus.  85 Vanagon, brown, well loved.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, we just got back from doing the Yellowstone-Teton loop, and I
realized something.  My speakers and radio need updating!
&gt; 
&gt; Problem:  I don't want to have to replace the grills up front, or the
pods out back if I don't have to....so my question is:
&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone know of a decent speaker set for installation in the old
hanging pods in back, and the grill door speaks up front?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks, if y'all can help!
&gt;
