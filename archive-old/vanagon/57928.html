Somehow I don't believe the makers of R-134A had the future of the planet or
our children's health in mind when they introduced their product, to them it
is all a matter of dollars and cents.  I imagine, when it becomes convenient
or profitable, R-134A will be blamed for all of the worlds problems and we
will see  the next generation of &quot;safe&quot; refrigerants introduced.  Sorry to be
so negative, but I have always questioned the EPA's motives and for some
reason, it always seems that their  priorities lie in padding their pocket
book rather than saving the earth.
