&gt;Anyway, does something like this exist for carrying gas?  If not,

there is a little 1.5 gallon tank that fits the vanagons (because their
spare tires are OUTSIDE the passenger area) ... it fits into the spare
tire up under the front bumper. available from:

Stainless Steel Brakes Corp.  Doughnut Gas Tank, item # A2900 - $70,
11470 Main Road               little metal spare gas tank that fits into
Clarence, NY 14031            the spare tire (1.5 gallons) under the
(716) 759-8666                front of the vanagon.

Girot's Garage                also sells the Doughnut Gas tank #92118
3500-A 20th Street E.         for $75.
Tacoma, WA 98424-1728         lot of neat (and expensive) tools and
(800) 345-5789                stuff
(206) 922-7500 FAX

admittedly, it's only 1.5 gallons, but sometimes that might be enough.
and you have to get a little dirty to get to it (cause you have to let the
spare tire down to get at it). on the other hand, it is outside so you
don't have any gas fumes inside. i've got one, but i don't carry it around
in my bus (haven't been on any lonnng trips since i got it. ;)
