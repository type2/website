Subject: Re: FREE '71 Westy--No ENG/TRANS

&gt;    I talked to Joe over the phone and this has been sitting in his back
&gt;    yard for 2 years and he is going to call the scrap metal people if no
&gt;    one wants it.  He says most of the interior is still there, in poor
&gt;    shape...
&gt;
&gt;    Good for parts, or a full restore...  Hey, isn't the 71 the last year of
&gt;    the upright motor, first year of disc brakes?
&gt;
&gt;    Anyone know if the camper stuff will fit my '75?
&gt;
&gt;    Call Joe...
