&gt; Subject:       Which Oil Filter??

&gt; Volks Folks,
&gt; 
&gt; Well time has come for the first oil change in the new Vanagon.  I heard a
&gt; lot of &quot;Don't use Fram filters&quot; while lurking on the list earlier.  The
&gt; question is what brand can I use?  Is &quot;Genuine VW&quot; the only way to go or is
&gt; there something else I can use?  All help appreciated.
&gt; 
&gt; -Dan
&gt; 
I've used Purolator filters with no problems but I prefer to purchase 
Mann whenever possible.
