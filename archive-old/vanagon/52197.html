&gt;I was driving through San Rafael, CA Saturday evening and saw a blue Vanagon
&gt;with a purple rear bumper. It (the bumper) looked like it was custom made
&gt;welded steel. It followed the lines of the stock bumper but looked like a
&gt;barden style bumper without the diamond plate. If this is your Vanagon or you
&gt;are familiar with it please contact me. I would like to find an alternative
&gt;to the stock flimsy one I have now.

I bought an '84 Vanagon GL with a Mazda rear bumper. The PO was retired from
the &quot;auto recycling&quot; business.  The bumper is chrome with black top flat
surface. If you're interested in more details, I have his phone #.
