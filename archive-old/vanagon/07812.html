&gt; &gt; A while back their was a thread regarding &quot;interchangability&quot; of vanagon
&gt; &gt; driver and passenger seats with other car seats, ie. Audi 4000?
&gt; &gt; Any more info? Anybody installed non-stock seats?
&gt; 
&gt; I just got done doing it, and I don't think there are very many seats
&gt; that will bolt right in.  I had to mount boards to the floor (which is
&gt; not actually the floor but the raised platform that the seats sit on)
&gt; and bolt the seats to the boards.  It wasn't really all that hard, just
&gt; time consuming.  Oh, and the seats are higher than the VW ones, which were
&gt; very flat.  I think this is typical of &quot;other&quot; seats.

What seat did you put in? How higher are they? Does your head now rub
against the headliner? #:) How tall are you?
Enquiring minds want to know.
