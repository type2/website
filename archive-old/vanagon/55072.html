Back in 1973 when FWD wasn't very common, I took my Fiat 128 into the 
mountains of Northern AZ to cut a Christmas tree.  Some red neck types 
followed me down the road in their 4WD utility.  I was the first down the 
forest road after new snow and sometimes had to take running starts at 
drifts higher than the hood.  When I got to  the cutting area, the other 
fellows stopped too to look over my diminutive Fiat to see what made it go 
so well.  Of course, they soon noticed the chains on the front wheels and 
started laughing.  Finally they asked me who put my chains on for me.  I 
just told them that I did it myself and, &quot;Aren't you supposed to put them 
on the front wheels?&quot;

They just walked away shaking their heads.

Mike
