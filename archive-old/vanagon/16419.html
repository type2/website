&gt; Er, not to take away from prospective list members from good old
&gt; Tschairmanie, but don't we already have a couple of German ex-pats on
&gt; the list?
&gt; 
&gt; Joachim (one such ex-pat who's so mixed up about where he is from and
&gt; where he is going, the only sure thing is the uncomfortable seat he's
&gt; in at work...)

&gt; I'm not an engineer, but I play one at work.

Hi Joachim,
I'm one of the more or less hiding germans on the list. I would say that 
I'm also a 100% swabian, which is a &quot;tribe&quot; of people living in the south 
of germany where all the good wheat beer comes from. They usually don't 
like to get mixed up with bavarians and people often associate with them 
some of the same properties as associated to people from Scotland :)
