Subject: RE: '71 Ignition Problems

&gt;&gt;Finally got around to getting the '71 camper ready for the camping season.
&gt;&gt;Tried to start it and found there to be no ignition. I decided the battery
&gt;&gt;was dead. It HAD been there for a long time. Put a new battery in it and
&gt;&gt;still no ignition. I've checked all the fuses, all good. Any ideas where to
&gt;&gt;go from here?
&gt;
Also, check the wire from the fuse box to the starter, and the connection
at the starter.  Also check the starter itself: short across the solenoid
(the two big connections) to see if the starter spins, then short the
right-most(pass side) big terminal to the little terminal to see if it
tries to start the bus.  This isolates the problem to either starter (1st
test fails),  solenoid (second test fails) or wire twixt switch and
solenoid (neither test fails).

Good luck,
Eric
