Subject: I finally installed my window A/C

Now tha summer session is almost over I had the time yesterday to install
my window A/C.  The unit is a Goldstar and it is 18&quot; long, 12&quot;tall, and
only 13&quot; deep.  It was by far the smallest 5000 btu I could find and has
the &quot;European Styling&quot;, so it is not big and bulky.  I installed it in the
rear part of the middle drivers side window, between the stove and the
rear table.  I had to let an autoglass place take out the glass and
install a custom fit piece of tinted plexiglass that they cut with the
hole for the A/C.  There was about 2 inches of plexiglass on the top of
the A/C because the height of the window was a little higher.  Everything
went as I expected except I could not put the A/C in as far as I wanted,
so about 6&quot;-7&quot; is sticking out instead of the 3&quot; or 4&quot; that I wanted out.
I attached the bracket that came with the unit to the bottom of it and
bolted the unit through the window seal and the metal. i then did some
serious calking.  I did not have to make any holes to the side of the van
for a bracket because The unit seems very secure andd I forgot to mention
it only weighs 42 pounds.  I am going to calk some more today to insure a
very tight seal.  I tested it out and the Westfalia turned into a meat
locker within 20 minutes.  All in all I am very pleased except the place
that took the original glass out broke it, so be very careful.  If any
body has any questions, don't hesitate.
