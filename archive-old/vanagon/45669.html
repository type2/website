Subject: Extra! Extra! Axle nut turns!...Read all about it!


Thanks for all the words of encouragement.  Having already mangled both
a 1/2&quot; and 3/4&quot; drive flex-heads on this axle nut, I opted for the
3/4&quot; sliding crown [or whatever it is they call it].  The nut had been
soaking in penetrating oil again last night.  A little heat, put the
socket on...stuck 5' of pipe on the bar and climbed on the end [I was
literally hanging onto the front door handle].  The bar flexed into an
amazing arc, then a very distinct &quot;groink&quot; echoed through the
neighbourhood.  Let I tell you, that was one rusty axle under that nut!

Now, it looks as though I will have to rig some sort of bracket to get
a two armed puller on the drums [I was thinking about a couple of
curved pieces of flat stock drilled to fit the lugs].  I tried my
&quot;smack the tyre with a rubber mallet&quot; trick that I used on the front
drums, but nothing moved...

Bugs &amp; Things &amp; Bricks...Oh, my!

Roy
