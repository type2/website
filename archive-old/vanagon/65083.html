Subject:      81 Camper gas mileage

Hi, I just joined the list because I just bought an 81 Vanagon camper. The
engine is newly rebuilt, and in the 10 weeks or so I've had it I've put
about 2800 miles on it.

My concern is the gas mileage. I'm only getting about 15 miles to the
gallon, which seems kind of low to me. Although this is not my first
air-cooled it is the first Vanagon I've ever owned so I have no idea if I
should expect better. Is this normal? If not, does anyone have any idea
what the problem might be or what I could do to increase it?

Most of those miles are highway but the mileage seems constant on the road
or in the city, and whether or not I use the A/C. I did have a problem with
schmutz in the gas tank (apparently the vehicle wasn't running for over a
year before the guy I bought it from rebuilt it) which clogged three fuel
filters in the first 2000 miles but that seems OK now.

Thanks in advance for bearing with a newbie if this has already been discussed.
