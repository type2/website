Subject: What is Mouse MIlk???

I started this so let me be more specific.  In Herb's article in the
archives there is a reference to &quot;Mouse Milk&quot; to loosen frozen nuts and
such.  This is stuff which is apparently used in the airplane world but
I've never heard of it.  Herb says the reference wasn't in his original
article and he has no idea what it is.

SOOOOO, what is this stuff, and is it (and why) better than WD-40 at
loosening?  Now, I like WD-40 but I'll use whatever I can get my hands on
to combat rusty nuts 'n bolts.  Any info is appreciated.

Maybe we should start a string on bolt/nut looseners?

James
