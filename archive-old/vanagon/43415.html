In a message dated 96-06-01 14:32:00 EDT, you write:

&gt;
&gt;I was given (!!) a Gene Berg add on oil sump. Should I use this device on
&gt;my '68 bus? Are there any precautions I need to take? Disadvantages,
&gt;besides extra $$ for oil changes? Will it help me out in any way?
&gt;

Ken,

Deep sumps are a trick developed on the drag strip to get the oil out of the
crankcase allowing the engine to accelerate more quickly.  They provide no
benefit to a daily driver, slowing engine warm-up and imposing mechanical
strains the miniscule sump-plate studs were never designed to withstand.
 Claims they lower oil temperature are based on temperature sensors installed
in the deep-sump -- valve gallery temps stay the same and because the
increased oil quantity introduces considerable lag, you can be running El
Frito temps long before the gauge begins to move.

If you feel you need additional oil capacity, installation of a full-flow oil
filter will increase your capacity by about a quart, an external oil cooler
by at least a pint, plus the oil in the tubing runs.

You really don't want something like this dangling under your bus.

-Bob
