&gt;&lt;&lt; I'd really like some advice on what sort of insulation to use.
&gt; I want convenience and neatness of installation,  I want good
&gt; insulating properties (sound, and heat.) &gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;John (and others)
&gt;
&gt;I'm sure others can add more to this,  but be carefull with 
polyurethane, it
&gt;will keep expanding for some time during installation and can expand 
enough
&gt;to destroy your panels,  but more imporant,  in a fire it is DEADLY...  
DO
&gt;NOT hang around if it catches fire!!!
&gt;
&gt;Fiberglass and rockwool can add a lot of irritants in the air for you 
to
&gt;breathe.  The movement of the van while on the road can constantly shed 
tiny
&gt;fiber particles that find their way out of any crack.
&gt;
&gt;Those are my only two known problems, but don't take my word on it, 
there are
&gt;many types of insulations and many ways to apply them.  I'm hoping 
others
&gt;will have more to say about this..............
&gt;
&gt;And while we're on the subject,  I'm interested if anyone has 
experimented
&gt;with ways to increase the efficiency of the AC by treating the windows 
with
&gt;coatings, films or shades.  I have the stock Westy windows in an 87 GL
&gt;Syncro.  Any ideas???

&gt;Curt,  

A long time ago when we lived in Arizona my wife and I tinted the 
windows in our 74 Westy with this adhesive film.  It went on easily 
(make sure the window is clean!) and really helped keep the vehicle 
cooler.  Just make sure you don't put real dark stuff on the rear window 
or the front side windows - it is hard to see out at night.

Since we now live in Alaska, I also pursued the insulation quest.  I 
glued 1/2 inch closed cell foam (carpet pad type) on the inside of the 
fiberglass poptop (just in the valleys)and then took 1/4 inch masonite 
coated with white plastic film (used as shower enclosure liners) and 
glued it with &quot;liquid nails&quot; to the ridges.  It has been up there for 6 
years now and works great.  No more condesation on the roof!  (we added 
a roof vent too which can help that problem too.)

I also took the same foam pad and lined the two front doors on the 
inside and the entire front panel under the dash etc - deadened sound 
and made it warmer.  

Good luck,


Adam Grove
