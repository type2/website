Subject: Heater booster fans

All,

A short time back there was a thread about the Barney's heater booster.
The less expensive route was to go to your local boating shop and
purchase bilge fans.  For those who do not have the luxury of boating
supply shops in their locale, I just received my Overton's discount
boating supply catalog, and they have said fans in 2 sizes.

Turbo Blower 3000 - 3&quot;id, 135 cfm open flow - $18.95
Turbo Blower 4000 - 4&quot;id, 220 cmf open flow - $20.95

tel # 1-800-334-6541
fax # 1-919-355-2923

usual disclaimer - don't work for, own, operate, know Overton's, etc....

Cheers where it was 98 degrees today,

David
