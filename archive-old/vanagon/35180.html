Subject: santa cruz this weekend!



As some of you may have noticed, one of our listmembers, Scott
will be camping this weekend in Santa Cruz and suggested others come
down and join him.  I'm going to try and do this for a bit, and
wanted to encourage the rest of you to do so, too, even if only
for a short while.  His address, btw, is spectre3_at_ix_dot_netcom_dot_com,
and you can let him know when you'll be arriving...
