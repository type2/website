Subject: Re: Help with dragging brakes
Date: Thu, 17 Nov 94 10:38:28 PST

&gt; 
&gt; I've rebuilt all my wheel cyliders and my brakes STILL drag! Should I put 
&gt; some grease in the cylider after I've cleaned out the rust or just brake 
&gt; fluid?
&gt; 
&gt; Any help appreciated,
&gt;

 Just brake fluid. I'm assuming you've already checked to make sure your not
 missing any parts - like the springs that pull the shoes away from the drums.

 What kind of shape is the master cylinder in?
