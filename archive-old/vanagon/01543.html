Subject: 197WTB: 1977 bus parts

From: Mark E Ingles &lt;mingles_at_iastate_dot_edu&gt;

I'm hunting for a few parts for a 1977 bus: 

* throttle valve housing (2.0 liter fuel injection)

* intake air sensor (2.0 liter fuel injection)
  --actually I only need the potentiometer circuit inside the case

* cylinder shrouding (2.0 liter fuel injection) 

* foam engine seal 

* diagonal arm for the drivers side rear suspension

* sunroof weatherstripping  

* uncracked windshield 

* right and left heat exchangers along with tubes that connect them to
the control boxes. 

* I might be interested in a stock exhaust muffler 




Thanks in advance.
