&gt;&gt;&gt; Plan on switching to Castrol Syntec 5W-50 100% synthetic at next oil change.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Have used it with excellent results in BMW's, Toyotas, and even in the
&gt;&gt;&gt; 1600cc type II engine in my 69 Westy.  Cuts oil consumption to near zero in
&gt;&gt;&gt; sound engines.
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;I hope this was a typo, but 15W-50 synthetic would be more appropriate
&gt;&gt;in warm/hot weather, and 5W-50 for very cold weather. I doubt 5W-50
&gt;&gt;synthetic would produce adequate oil pressure once the engine is up to
&gt;&gt;termperature.

&gt;Larry,
&gt;
&gt;5W-50 is correct.  I have never encountered a problem with oil pressure, at
least as indicated by a flickering light at low rpms.  This includes a
number of desert crossings in the summer (Mojave and Anza Borrego) with air
temperatures of  +110 F.
&gt;
&gt;Perhaps the idiot light is not a good indicator of insufficient oil
pressure due to thin oil.  Still, I use this oil year round and get easy
starts in the winter and seem to get good summer protection - at least from
a standpoint of oil consumption.  Would welcome additional feedback.  Will
post info later this summer after the switch.
