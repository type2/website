Subject: Battery Installation Catalog--Wrangler

One of the best sources for battery cable supplies and materials for dual
battery installations is Wrangler Power Products of Prescott, Arizona. 

They've just come out with their 1996 catalog ($3.00) which is available at
PO Box 12109, Prescott, Az, 86304-2109. Phone 520-717-1711.

If you are planning a dual battery installation, get this catalog. Other
companies have stuff, but few have such a range as Wrangler.

While I am on the subject, let me restate a long stated position to use
relays, not isolators, when installing your 2nd batteries (you loose juice
with an isolator--voltage drop). Also, I recomend you use heavy gague (e.g.,
1/0) cable to wire up the 2nd battery. This way you can start your car with
either batttery. 

Good luck ye 2nd batt planners...
