Subject: (f) Hi to Tobin &amp; Christa, models, wieghts, etc.

	this is a digest reponse...

	Hi Tobin and Christa!! (Dave, Jeff, pass this on? thanks)

	Someone wanted the scoop on the fella who sells pre-68 bus
model kits:

Think Small Models
Dennis Chung
6080 Clark Road
Ottawa Lake, MI  49267
(313)888-1409

	I've seen confirmation in this country that the Vanagon model
is being re-released in UN colors (Bosnia...- white with blue UN
decal).


	I shipped my case, crank, rods, extra-deep-sump and
heads down to EIS to save the core charge of $140. It cost $59 to
send them UPS from San Jose to Corona!! Oh well, I'll stop and
pick-up $80 any chance I can, and I trust they'll be able
to re-use what can be re-used. I wouldn't reuse a case and
cooler that had been with a melted piston without some kind
of really excellent cleaning of the oil passages... This felt
better than selling it to someone at a swap who might have
a tragedy involving pits of the old piston coming out of
the oil passages...

	FYI, the ES-21 case, deep-sump, crank and rods installed, no
flywheel, oilpump or head studs, reasonably boxed, wieghed
75lb! The heads, valves, springs, rockers, but no pushrods or
valve covers, wieghed 29lb boxed.

	I'm left with a 34 PICT 3 carb, dual-port manifold,
generator, fan, selected engine tin and a two-vacuum-tube 
distributor that are looking for a good home.

	The best part is that the old head studs, old pressure
plate and various bent pieces of engine tin went into the
curb-side recycling bin and got taken! Is this a great
country or what? Yes, Ian helped with this.

	Cheers, all!
	Bill
