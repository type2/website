Subject:       Re: Splitfire plugs

&gt; but i can say this: they do last longer than the previous Champion plugs i
&gt; was running. which, if you think about it, would figure: three prongs, so
&gt; each prong gets eroded only one-third as much (as a single-prong plug) in
&gt; the same number of firings. eh?  i like them. :)
&gt;
&gt; &quot;time for your medication again, Mr. Walker!&quot;

So what's the word on these Bosch's and Air-cooled engines?  I 
vaguely remember a recommendation not to use them.  Or am I just 
dreaming...  Laaa deee daaa deee daaa.

The Tie-Dyed movie made it to Utah finally.  I guess I'll go see what 
all the hype's about.
