Subject: Re: your mail &lt;wasted bandwidth&gt;

sorry for the incredibly wasted bandwidth, folks, on all these lists and 
addys....

PLEASE!!! HELLO!?_at_!?_at_# READ THIS CAREFULLY!*_at_*!_at_ 
 
   Do NOT reply to all to this message, or any of the previous spam, or 
previous discussions about the idiocy of this spam, and do the &quot;Reply to 
All&quot; function, thinking only the users on YOUR list will get it. These 
replies are bouncing across ALL the lists and addys that are currently 
under the To: heading. PLEASE THINK! PLEASE DO NOT REPLY TO THIS MESSAGE 
DIRECTLY! You can flame me directly if you like at: 
                      
                  jason_at_falco.kuci.uci_dot_edu

Again, PAY ATTENTION to what is ACTUALLY in the &quot;To:&quot; location. When you 
reply to all, you're spamming well over a hundred listserv lists. 
 
Again, sorry to all list subscribers of all sorts, list managers, net 
addicts, and whoever else this bounced to. This message is meant for a 
small minority of people that seem to be ignorant of what they are doing, 
and i hope they know who they are. Thanks for your time. KEEP THE NET OPEN!
