Subject: Re: Does everyones bus roll away?

&gt;My van has a bad habit of occasionally rolling away when I go inside
&gt;for dinner or WHY.  I wonder if this is a 'common' thing, or an
&gt;anomaly.  Does anyone else have this problem?  Sometimes the e-brake
&gt;works well, other times it feels like I am hitting the end of travel
&gt;on the handle and the brake isn't fully engaged.

What gear are you leaving it in? Should leave it in first.
A tire chock always helps me when the incline is questionable.
