Subject: Re: Early bus/window seals

ah, yes just go down to the dealer and ask for barndoor window rubber...

actually you can (and I have ) use later window rubber.  I dont like WCM- its
too plasticky, not tacky enough for me.   Wolfsberg West is okay, but the
contour could be better.   The best i found at a vw swap meet- lovely tacky
rubber molded well,  dont know original source.  I like to smear some roofing
tar on the window ledge before installing the glass as extra sealant.   NO
ONE makes  seals w/ correct contour and molded corners.
