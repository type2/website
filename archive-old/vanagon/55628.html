Subject: Coolant Leak

Vanagoners:

	The coolant leak that I described has now been diagnosed as a leaking
coolant distribution unit. They replaced all the hose last June, but not
the distribution unit. After 100K miles and two bad engine overheatings, I
guess this unit was now the weak link in the chain.
	The mechanic is a long time air cooled VW man, but he does have an 85
Vanagon; wants to convert it to the Kennedy Saburu and a Jetta engine
(likes AC, wants the power.) Didn't have a regular parts source for our
vehicles, so I passed along the Camelback VW 800 number, and told him
about the list. 
	Hoping to report a happy ending to this latest adventure soon.
