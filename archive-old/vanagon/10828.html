Subject: Coolant leak fixed

Joel was right - cracked expansion tank.  A series of cracks between the
fill cap and the level sensor.  At temperature it was probably spraying out
of there quite vigorously.

Pinched off the 1&quot; (approx) hose (running to the front that comes off the
water pump) over the left axle, with a C-clamp.  Captured the spillage and
flushed it down the toilet (that seemed like the most practical advice -
that water is treated, somehow... somewhere... rather than just dumped raw
into the environment).  Replaced the tank, the o-ring on the level sensor
and the o-ring on the left injector-temperature-sender.

Our driveway is steep enough that I didn't have to jack up the front for
the ridiculous filling-and-bleeding ritual.  Certainly an entertaining
procedure.
Does anyone have a method for keeping the RPM at 2000 while doing this alone?

Watching for puddles and keeping my fingers crossed.

My brake parts haven't found their way into town yet  :-(
