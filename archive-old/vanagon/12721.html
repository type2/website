Just saw a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup ad on tv which featured an old guy
sitting in back of his parked split window, sort of winter camping/sort of
playing with some kind of electronic (tube era) equipment. A meteor thing
falls to earth in the background and the old grizzled guy gets out of his van,
looks around puzzled-like.

Don't know why, but I thought of Joel when I saw it :)
