Subject: The shower thing :}

OK, I know that I'm just looking for trouble for posting this but what's up with
the shower thing?  Now don't get me wrong - I like showers, but WE'RE CAMPING 
HERE PEOPLE!  Remember that this is California, where every other year seems to 
be a drought.  What's wrong with roughing it for the weekend, conserving a 
little H20 and enjoying a nice refreshing shower when you return to 
civilization?  Besides, if the FRENCH can get away with only one shower per week
on average, can't we risk it for a couple of days?  Of course, no offense 
intended towards showermeister Dave Garth or Showerphile Martha Rubin.  Just 
call me EuroLarry, as in Eee-uuuu, what's that smell?  This important message 
brought to you (downwind) by your water conscious friends in bankrupt Orange 
Co., CA. (now fiscally and morally on par).
