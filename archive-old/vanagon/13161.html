I just returned from a week in California and have I been surprised!!!

1) Don't know what's happening but I have several messages in my mail box indicating 
I've been bounced from the list.

Don't know if  I'll get a response from any of you. Don't have any idea abut what's been 
happening in and about the list during the last two weeks!!

Anyone care to forward a synopisis? :)

2) RIC (and perhaps other Eurovan owners), you'll love this ....

I spent two days in San Franciso; the remainder of the time in and around 
Sacramento.

After the second day I became very aware of a visual absence and went looking ...

During the entire time, I did not see one Eurovan in California. I even looked for 
addresses in the Yellow Pages and drove past VW dealers, none there. I was up and 
down Highways (5, 80, 99, etc.). Saw plenty of vans (all types, colors, configurations, 
etc.); no Eurovans. Even saw a Vanagon (possibly '91) with ski racks mounted on the 
top and rear hatch, looked very good!!

Perhaps California does not recognize Eurovans (or worse, the folks out there aren't 
aware that VW still is making new models) ;)

Hope that I can get back on the list and hope to hear from some of you.
