Subject: headliner source in Virginia?

In the Sept/Oct issue of OBR Jim (Bryant) mentioned a source for
quality headliners in an article he wrote for Typing 2 Ink.

Was wondering if anyone knew the name of the source he refered to?

I am in the process of reassembling a 66 21 window and am looking
for alternative sources for headliners and raw material. We also
have a 23 window on the way as well as another 21 window to complete 
so's the info will come in handy immediatley.

I have tried (and in general am happy with ) Sewfine, RMMW, and 
WCM, but would consider alternatives as each headliner had its
own peculiarity price notwithstanding...

Kevin
