Subject: Rear Drums wont come off.

Well, after cleaning all the wicked metallic sparkles out of the
front bearing caps and replacing the grease with the blue stuff,
I tackled the rear wheels last night. (Heavy '71 Vans dont like
to stop when fully loaded!)

I could not turn the adjusters, no matter how hard I pried on them.
(Did not want to bust them) and I thought that pouring liquid 
wrench or oil on them through the adjusting hole would soak the
pads, etc. I tried to pull the drum off. I have the easy-off drum,
no castle-nut to remove. But I could not get the drums off. I 
pried, banged, yanked, etc. but they would not budge.

They turn OK, and the brakes are not binding, they just wont come off.
I dont have a wheel puller, but I dont see how it would help with
this type of wheel anyway. The lugs are part of the spindle,
which does not come off. Nowhere to hook a pully-puller to,
and no screws to tap. I dont want to bend the mudshield, so
I am at a loss to get it off. Should I just beat on it with a hammer?
How about a rubber hammer? Where is it binding?

Help!

PS: when the emergency brake cable is adjusted almost all the way
down, and the handle still comes 75% out, is it time to get new 
emerg. brake cables? How tough to put these in?
