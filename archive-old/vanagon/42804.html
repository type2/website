&gt; Then the guy who puts the JATO unit on the Nova (at least they didn't ask

You must admit, that was a rather good story!
 
&gt; The basic rule is, if its not germane to the list, don't post it.
&gt; Especially if it says to post it everywhere.  Treat with skepticism every
&gt; weird email that comes your way.

Amen.  I come to the Vanagon list to GET AWAY FROM COMPUTERS!  You 
can only handle eating sleeping breating fixing troubleshooting 
networking rebuilding computers for so long and then you need a VW 
break.
