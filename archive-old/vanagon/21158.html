&gt;        He is also thinking of bring back a 69mm T1 counter weight crank
&gt;because he thinks its a cheaper way to get one, so could someone post prices
&gt;for me so I can work out weather this is a viable proposition or not.
&gt;His idea is to carry it as his hand luggage!(Yeek)

The trick with this is to get the store to wright out a bill that is far,
far (within reason) cheaper than he actually paid...then if he gets caught
he'll only pay tax on a much lower bill...

BEWARE- customs ain't that stupid, even when its a VW part!!

....saying that though, they never stopped me and I had a Chevy
supercharger in one bag and a full turbo kit for a bug, in the other ;))

2 B Hounest I don't pay that much more than carrying and I get the stuff
mailed over regular....

Be lucky ;)
