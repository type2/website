Subject: Odd looking VWs-- can you top this?


&gt;From the fordnatics mailing list, in a thread about hauling odd cargo:

&gt;&gt; but the hatchback really did come in handy. Some of the
&gt;&gt; more interesting things I've hauled in mine include a (green?)
&gt;&gt; recliner (still in the box!) and later a 289 block and some
&gt;&gt; assorted parts.  Well, the recliner was about half in and
&gt;
&gt; I was driving a VW Beetle when I built my first V8 Capri.  When I
&gt;picked up the engine at the junkyard, I removed the hood [of the VW], had
&gt;them drop the engine on top of the gas tank on a couple of boards, and
&gt;drove home looking around the water pump.

                                                                              

Any Camaros come up beside you at a stoplight, take one look at your
apparent V8-powered bug, and flee in terror?   :^)
