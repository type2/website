Subject: R&amp;T Digression


One of the things I remember about R&amp;T from when I read it in the mid-70s
was the Stan Mott cartoons. There was one where the pipe-smoking, capped
and scarfed character was driving along a country road in his extravagant
open sports car. I think there was about 2 pages of panels of the car
racing along, with the final panels depicting the airbag inflating (due to
some trivial reason), and the now dishevelled driver saying, &quot;Thank goff
for Ralph Nader&quot;, or words to that effect. Those were the days when car
manufacturers were lobbying furiously against mandatory airbag laws.
A decade later and airbags are now a sales point.
R&amp;T took a decidedly anti-bag position, I don't read the mag now, but I
wonder if they now approve of supplimental restraint systems ( ie.
&quot;automatic&quot; seat belts and airbags).
