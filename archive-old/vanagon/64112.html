Subject: Diesel Westy Dometic Fridge: No 12V functioning: Where's the Fuse?

KampenVolks,
The Dometic on my new 82 Diesel Westy Chills great on 120AC/have yet to
try propane, but I get nothing out of the 12V mode. I mean nothing.
Particulars:
1) Batt Good
2) 12V mode properly engaged as per manual

The manual tells me there is supposed to be a 10amp fuse on the front
control panel of the fridge, but I sure can't find one. I did find the
fuse behind the driver's seat as per VW Kampenmanual and this fuse
appears good. 
Is there another fuse somewhere else or any other ideas. Any and all
feedback greatly appreciated.
Regards
Mark B. Magee
