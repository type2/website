     Karl,
     There are 2 motors. They are both located in the evaporator.
     This is located in the rear roof. To remove it, you must start
     in the front and remove the entire roof system. Have someone 
     help, in order not to break any of the plastic parts. While
     your in there replace the AC filter and the speakers. Before
     you start check the mounts on the evaporator, (the sides)
     to see if they are broke.  These are a 3 bolt flange that bolts
     to the side of the van. If so make a sheet metal angle to install
     when you remove the evap.
