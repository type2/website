Subject: tic-tic-tic in front wheel!?

 Greetings all,
   I am on the trail of the engine surge problem and hope to have
a cause and cure to report soon.
  meanwhile, any guesses about this
    For the first block or two only a tic,tic,tic in R front wheel.
  after that, nothing even when going oner cobblestone roads. It all seems
 pretty tight too. 
    my guess is something that expands when is warms up and no longer rubs,
 e.g. SLIGHTLY too tight bearings or brakes.
  thanks,
    Bill

 ps- loading a canoe on a vanagon is no problem provided you mount
the rear Q&amp;E rack as far back as possible. you just rest the bow on the rack
put the stern on the ground, the pick it up and push it on. Pad the 2x4's
of course.
