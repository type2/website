Subject: Re: Vans in europe?


&gt;From Halifax (Nova Scotia) to Antwerp was about $1200 Cdn. (one way)
when I inquired this past summer. This means you get it over to 
Halifax yourself and it takes it another 12 days minimum to cross the
Atlantic. You can't pack it full of things you'll need as they will
apparently only take the vehicle empty. Had I been able to do so, I
might have been more selective about what I was bringing to Switz.
and gone the way of car shipping. Instead, I shipped over a full
container, with the (full) Westy in it. This cost me about 5 times
as much.. :-(  But then I hardly had any furniture to buy here (at
2-3 times the Canadian price).
Remember that 12 (24) days exposed to salty air is pretty hard on 
the car. Even though mine was in a container, you could see the
increase in rust when it got here.

&gt; With all this talk about used vans no longer being cheap in 
&gt; Europe....I wonder if it would be worth while, if one were to
&gt; be in Europe on an extended trip (more than a month...) to ship
&gt; one's own camper/van from the US to Europe, and then ship it back
&gt; when the trip was over.
&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone know what it costs to ship cars back and forth?
