Subject: Camelback VW update
Date: Wed, 1 May 1996 11:57:10 -0500 (CDT)

I called Camelback VW in Pheonix this morning for a price quote on a 
couple of prices.  It seems that everyone there is aware of the 
&quot;internet&quot; deal so you don't need to talk to anyone special.  Also, 
parts are going for 25% over cost and not the 20% that was mentioned 
in the past.
