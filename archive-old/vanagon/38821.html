&gt;&gt;&gt;        Now why the heck cant the BP just buy Mexican busses???!!! 
Probably
&gt;&gt;&gt;cheaper, and if they *really* want stealth busses, Mexican plates will
&gt;&gt;&gt;really make 'em look innocent. I dunno if the Mex. Government would be 
cool
&gt;&gt;&gt;with the idea, but it would certainly be worth a shot...
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Same reason we can't-- illegal to bring them into the U.S. Don't meet
&gt;&gt;federal standards for emissions, taillight size, restraints, etc.
&gt;
&gt;wait a minute here!!! :)  this is our chance!!  somebody go down to mexico
&gt;and tell the mexicans about this ... tell them that they need to &quot;sneak&quot;
&gt;across the border in mexican buses!!! that way, the border patrol will 
think
&gt;they are other patrols!! and we get new-old buses into the states!! :)

Certainly begs the question:

If it's so easy to smuggle illegal humans into the U.S., why can't somebody
start smuggling illegal VWs??? We actually *want* those!   :^)
