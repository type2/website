Subject: Re: Rear axle nut. Uuugh!

When once trying to get off the flywheel gland nut on my beetle with a 
1/2&quot; K-Mart flex handle, I, too, broke the handle.  Actually, my 400 lb. 
neighbor broke it when I asked him to help me and he put all his weight 
into it!

I went to a pawn shop and got a 3/4&quot; breaker bar for no more than $10. 
then got a new Craftsman 1-7/16&quot; (36mm) socket (3/4&quot; drive).  I still bent
a 4 or 5 foot long cheater pipe!  (engine had to be crammed under
something to keep it from tipping over).  I wandered around vacant lots
and such in the neighborhood until I found a much heavier duty pipe (part
of a junked gate--had to unbolt some parts from it).  Finally got the nut
to come off (some creaking, but amazingly easy).

I've never had a problem with that 3/4&quot; breaker bar and ordninary sockets
(not impact sockets), with that thick pipe, and I'm only 130 lbs.  I've
also used it with a 1-13/16&quot; (46mm) Craftsman socket for the bus rear axle
nuts.  Always real easy. 

A friend tells me he uses one of those thick sheet metal thingys that you 
bang on with a hammer, and it always works great for him.

Like they do with wheel lug bolts, shops always put these high-torque 
nuts on way too tight with impact wrenches.
