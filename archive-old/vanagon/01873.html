Subject: Re: Bus Boys

I paid the four bucks about two years ago for a catalog. I never received 
one, and I found about four other folks in rec.autos.vw that had the same 
experience. I'll probably send 'em $4 again, but I'd sure like to get my 
catalog. (And, I have the cancelled check for the payment, but no 
catalog, from the first go-round. Maybe I'm a masochist, but I'm still 
keeping my '72 and planning on a rebuild, too.)
