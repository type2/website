Subject: 2 beater busses wanted
Date: Tue, 25 Mar 1997 12:49:15 -0500

Hi Volks,

I have two friends who are looking for their first busses. The only
qualifications are that they be in *relatively* sound mechanical shape and
cheap. They will be used as daily drivers and work vehicles so cosmetics
aren't a concern. Josh is a painter and percussionist, and Tyler is a piano
tuner and musician. I recommended 68-71 years for easy maintenance, but all
advice/opinions are encouraged and invited! Please email all responses to
me and to:

If you'd like, you can listen to our music at http://bluejordan_dot_com. Check

Thanks!

tony
