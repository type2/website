i don't think so.  The 74 westy's pop top pops up the the front, and has a
double bed upstairs.   The 73 opens up to the rear and has a single cot.

The interior layout was altered too.  The 73 has a cabinet on the passenger
side in the rear, with a bed/bench next to it, with a seat facing the rear
and a sink/cooler unit behinfdthe front seats.  I'm not clear onthe later
stle ecept the cabinet was moved to the derivers side (better visibility!)
and you could get a fridge and electric water pump.
