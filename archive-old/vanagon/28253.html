Subject: Re: Why VW's + T&amp;A?


Apparently the T &amp; A magazines do research on this and &quot;most&quot; of
their male reading public do want the T &amp; A pix in the mags.  What
is true, however, is that approximately 12% of the reader base
is female.  Perhaps it would not be a bad idea for them to poll
their female readers and see if they would like Brad Pitt type
people posing with the cars.  To be &quot;fair,&quot; they could then feature
12% of their photos in such a light.
