&gt; Marcus Grant asks: 
&gt;  Snap, almost. I got a 70 bus for the take it easy and a Kawasaki GPz 550
&gt;  for the ohmygosh sessions. Have many others on the list gone for the
&gt;  bus/bike combination? 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Yup. In addition to the '74 bus and other driveway sculpture mentioned in
  the past, we have a '79 Yamaha SR500 and an '87 SRX250. BTW, turn up
  the Twilight Zone theme again here, I've had two FIATs in my past too - an
  850 coupe and a 128 sedan - both of them lots of fun and not bad cars.
