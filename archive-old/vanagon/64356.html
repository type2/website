Well I can't speak for the DPO's (wow, I'm slinging VW jargon already!)
intent in installing it, and maybe this is what it's typically used for,
but my Westy has no fridge or stove.
Thanks for the clue though.

&gt;&gt;I've recently acquired my first VW ('86 WestyWeekender, 99k), and need

&gt;&gt;The compartment under the drivers seat contains not as I expected a jack
&gt;&gt;or tire iron, but another battery which appears at initial observation
&gt;&gt;to be connected into my system. Anyone  know how this setup works? Does
&gt;&gt;it function as a backup in case the one under the passenger seat fails,
&gt;&gt;or just give me more duration for running appliances?
&gt;
&gt;I believe that this second battery is only connected to the fridge.  It
&gt;charges while the ignition is turned on, and is isolated when the ignition
&gt;is turned off.
&gt;
&gt;Someone please correct me if I'm wrong.
