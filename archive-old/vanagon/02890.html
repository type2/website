Subject: in defense of grits!

 Well folks, it falls to me to defend the lowly grit, i really
like them. they are far superior to cream of wheat [which is truely
 awful ] and somewhat better than oatmeal [edible if not cooked too long].
 Grits have a very nice feature any of you all who have ever done a
good days work in the georgia sun would appreciate :they are not heavy going down yet they stay with you for a long time.
