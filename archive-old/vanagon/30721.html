Subject: Result of Cooling Oddities

I picked up my van today, after giving up (thankfully) the dreaded Geo
Metro.  The Vanagon mechanic (Fred) said he was only able to drain about two
gallons from the coolling system, so the coolant has been going somewhere,
and for quite some time.  I just drained, flushed and bled the cooling
system about three months ago.  Fred was able to show me the evidence of
leaking from the left head, an ever so slight smear from the head gasket.

So it's decision time, thanks to everyone who responded with their best
guesses.  The cooling fan does work, the system is bled with new
coolant--which of course is taking on air when I drive it.  I guess that
cooling fan won't come very frequently when over half of what the water pump
should be pumping around is, in fact, AIR!

VW has two 1.9 liter engines in Jacksonville available for immediate
shipment.  They won't trade my 1.9 for a 2.1--the exchange has to be for the
same engine or else to core apparently has no value to them.  The engine
price is $2,444, drive out price after installation will be at least $4,000
(I figure) with all the new parts that should be replaced; water pump,
clutch, probably replacing the rear heater which probably leaks a little,
seals and whatever new hoses it needs.  I asked Fred if he thought I should
figure on a new radiator and he claimed he has never had to replace a
radiator on a Vanagon--he feels that Vanagon radiators lead a rather stress
free life, not subject to quite the same pressures that cars with radiators
located within reasonable proximity to the engine.

Apparently, I can keep bleeding and refilling the cooling system for a
while--who knows how long.  I suppose I need to assess how much I want to be
driving a Vanagon in the interim period.  I'm tempted to go ahead and do the
work on it because I really like this van.

My question is, how successful will the transplant be?  It seems to me that
the smallest leak anywhere in the cooling system will inevitably lead to
engine problems, even if the heads are secure, with a possible leak
elsewhere leading to overheating, there goes my $4,000 &quot;investment.&quot;  Talk
me into this--the money I have, it's the confidence I'm lacking.  $4,000
could put me into a high mileage Audi 4000 of the '88 or '89 model vintage.
New TDI Passats are showing up around the country, etc. etc.
