&gt;	OK, so I've been lagging.  

S'alright.  You got a great deal on parts.

&gt;	I still wanna do the FIsh Taco thang, an everyone sounded like
&gt;they wanted to do late July or Early August.

Yup.  Late July is too soon, though.

&gt;	The possible activities included Beer Drinking, Mountain Biking,
&gt;Old Sacramento, and a tour of Fitzpatrick's Body Shop.

I'll mountain bike but not beer-drink.  Old Sac sound fun, especially if
there are antique shops, and body shops are always fun.  (For a way cool
portfolio of metal shop photographs, check out
http://www.teleport_dot_com/~lenswork/mos.htm).

&gt;	So!  Lets have a final vote:  Who wantsa come, which weekend,
&gt;which day, and what activities. 

I'm free any weekend in August.
