&gt;&gt;you are listed individually in addition to the vanagon list address.  Just a
&gt;&gt;possibility.

&gt;Not the case, however.  I've been seeing LOTS of duplicate posts, including
&gt;to stuff I'm not remotely interested in, such as '56 restorations.  (Sorry,

You know, I kind of promised myself that I wouldn't perpetuate this thread,
but I thought of another possible explanation.  Are all of the duplicate posts
from the vanagon list?  'Cause I'm also on the aircldvw list, and while I
also get duplicates, I've never noticed if maybe one was on the vanagon list
and the &quot;duplicate&quot; was on the aircldvw list because the author cross-
posted it.  Just (yet another) a thought.
