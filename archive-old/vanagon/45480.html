Subject: '83 Brake Magic

        Well, I actually managed to put in new brake pads with relative
ease. I expected a much more labour intensive procedure, but then again
there may have been something I missed, although everything seems fine.
        I'll run through what I did real quick and if anyone can see
anything Ive totally missed then please tell me as Ill be leaving in 9
hours for my Canada Day long weekend camping adventure.
- removed wheel etc. and turned wheel hard so that the pad area was easily
accesible
- removed 2 pins, and the metal clip thing (for lack of a better term :) )
- wedge Mr.Screwdriver in between the bad and the pad gaurd slightly and
pried enough to move the caliper back a bit.
- pulled my very thin brake pad out of its spot.
- Put the backing gaurd (which had sticky tape) on the back of the new
brake pad about where the caliper marks had made their impression on the
old pad
- pushed the calipers back as far as the receed
- shoved in the brake pad...one of them was real tight though so I had to
tap each corner with a hammer lightly to get in in their. I dont think I
pushed the caliper back in enough for that one.
- put the pins and clip back in.
- pumped brakes. It took 1 full push till the calipers p[ushed down on the
new pads.
- took it for a quick spin, and it seemed fine. No squeeks, and my brakes
dont have to be pushed nearly as far in to brake.

        So everything seemed fine to my freind and myself, but I didnt have
a manual or any reference so I wasnt sure if there were any adjustments
that had to be made. If so please drop me a note.

cheers, and HAPPY CANADA DAY LONG WEEKEND!!!!
