Subject: Trip Report posted

I've finally got around to posting a trip report from our trip down 
the Washington, Oregon, &amp; North Calif coast in April.

If you're interested, please take a look at my homepage shown in the 
sig.
If anyone who is webless (probably a good thing...) would like a 
copy, let me know.
Thx.

BTW, just got my Euro Car - they have an article on the Passat TDI!
