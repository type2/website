&gt; rec.autos.tech. Some of the answers coming  back included: a) heat would
&gt; have no effect; b) heat will crack the glass; c) fluid should not be heated
&gt; etc. What were your experiences? My idea was to wrap some of the tubing

The Corrado has heating elements (electric) in the washer nozzel
assemblies.  Cracking the glass is ludicrous, these things do not
heat that much, simply enough to keep the nozzel from freezing
up, a problem that cursed our '86 Vanagon.  The system is really
slick and melts these two little holes through the snow laying
on your hood, sort of neat.  Something like this would be great
for Bus or Vanagon if we could find a nozzel that might fit easily,
as many European cars have them, even on the headlight washers, it
might not be that hard.  Does anyone know if such a &quot;cold climate
package&quot; was offered on the Eurovan, as those units might work but
I note these things are likely very expensive, I like the recent
idea of using the Vanagon radiator to heat the washer fluid, but
this doesn't help Bus owners.  I note the heated fluid does seem to
work better as well, if I forget to turn them on (works on rear
defroster switch) I notice it. Of course what I'd really like
for the Bus is the other part of my cold climate package, the heated
seats, wow are those great on the back on a cold winter morn.
