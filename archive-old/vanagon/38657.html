Subject: Vanagon list archive back in action...


I apologize for the recent several day absence of the Vanagon mailing list
archive at http://www.automatrix_dot_com/~skip/volkswagen/vanagon-list/.  It is
back archiving messages for the time being.  The mail processor started
spewing error messages out mid-week and I was just too busy to address the
problem right then, so I turned it off.  I've rolled the archive over to a
new directory and things seem to be percolating again.

I was working on a replacement for hypermail a couple months ago that
archives the messages much better, but I never did get around to doing the
proper sort of CGI index scripts that one expects (by thread, author,
subject, date, ...) from such systems.  If there is enough interest in a
replacement for the hypermail-based archive (which has to constantly be
rolled over, thus destroying people's bookmarks), let me know and I'll try
and squeeze it in.  (If there is interest, I will at least make the
new-style archives available for feedback.)

Again, sorry for the downtime.  Anybody seen any 48hour days laying about?
I could use a few...
