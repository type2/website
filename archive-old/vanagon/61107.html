Hello Folks,	
Spent most of the weekend working on her, had lots of success though. Got
to looking around, found two plug wires touching with a BIG drip of oil
between the two to carry the current. Cleaned them up, and separated them
from each other. also found some corrosion on the ig. coil leads. Cleaned
that up also, and no more problem. :)  Spent the rest of my time putting
new brakes on the front. Would have been a lot easier had the idiots at the
local VW (who installed my new tires a few months back) had not put the lug
bolts on so tight. But after a lot of cussing and complaining and thanks to
a 3' cheater bar they finally broke lose with a very loud POP. The rest was
pretty routine, except for spending about 2-3 hours looking for the damn
e-clip that holds the speedometer cable. Control arm bushings along with
the remaining fuel hoses that aren't new (weather they need it or not) are
next weekend's project, but for now she's back on the road. Think I'll wash
her today, if it EVER quits raining around here. It is June isn't it????
Starting to feel like I need to convert the Vanagon to double as a speed
boat :) 

Happy Vanagoning
