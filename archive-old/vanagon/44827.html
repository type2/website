PRECISELY! My Dear Watson!!!  This is the stuff that *REALLY* torks me 
off.  I've had this happen to me on numerous other business deals where 
the &quot;business&quot; or &quot;the person I'm doing business with&quot; seems real nice 
and homey and all that.  But then when the time comes for them to provide 
the service, they simply won't render.  They hide out, and then in the 
end (and this is the part that kills me) THEY MAKE YOU APPEAR TO BE THE 
CRIMINAL!  As a youngster, I didn't know this stuff but now that I am 
older, I am getting bittered and experienced with time.  I no longer give 
verbal agreements any credibility whatsoever and get everything in 
writing that I can. My recommendation (although extreme) is to go to the 
shop, get your stuff back, and take it someplace else.  If they aren't 
there when you go, take a day off work, get a 5 gallon bucket, an 
umbrella, and a thermos full of your favourite ice-cold beverage.  Go 
down there, sit on the bucket under the umbrella, (bring something to 
read as well), and wait until they show up.  Sure, you make an ass out of 
yourself, but I'll bet you'll get your stuff back.  I practically had to 
do this to get a little red 74 Super that I had my eyes on.  I pestered 
the junkyard until they got the paperwork done so I could take it home.  
It wasn't the junkyard's fault that the paperwork hadn't been done 
(thanks to the PO), but after camping out for a month (everyday after 
work), they knew I was persistant enough and finally got the PO to get 
the title or whatnot.

You'll be glad when you get your stuff back.
