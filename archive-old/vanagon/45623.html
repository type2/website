Subject: RE: 77 Bus, gas tank removal or cleaning?

the usual procedure is to try and clean it several times, get stranded all 
over the place and then replace the tank. One might consider proceeding 
directly to step two.

Its not that bad a job to replace it. 

Remove the airbox and tube
Remove the 4 engine mount bolts and two top trainey bolts
lower the engine ~12 inches
remove the gas tank cover 
there are two straps holding the tank, remove 13 mm nuts (from below)
remove the sending unit and ground wires (from top center)
loosen clamp and slip fill hose off tank
disconnect vavor lines
remove tank
if the sending unit worked, swap it with the one in the new tank

You should be able to do it all in a morning.

Good luck

Martin
