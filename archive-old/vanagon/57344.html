I have a real Deal. Genuine Bosch three wire sensors for Late Golf Jetta's.  
$70.00 includes shipping.  You will have to use the connectors from the 
original as the later VW's use a single three wire plug instead of the two 
connections used on the Vanagon.  This sensor also accepts the clip on shield 
that the Vanagon needs to keep road dirt and water off the sensor.  Sensor 
getting wet from rain will cool it enough to make it work intermittently.  
E-mail me if interested.

Subject:	O2 sensor, 2.1L

Greetings list,
        I am replacing the O2 sensor in my 91. Several people have mentioned
using a &quot;generic&quot; three-wire sensor ($30-50) instead of the Bosch
($140-190). However, after several trips to various local flaps, I still
haven't found the O2 sensor I'm looking for. If anyone can help me out, I
need some specific information. Make/part number of the 'generic' O2 sensor
would be best. Year/make/model of the car it was 'designed' for would be
second best.

Thanks much,
Pat
