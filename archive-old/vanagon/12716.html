 My neighbor's '84 Vanagon has just over 120,000 miles and has had the head
 gaskets, water pump, expansion tank and muffler replaced. Other than that it 
 has been trouble free and he is very happy with it. 

 Sami suggested that this collection of statistics not be limited to just 
 wasserboxers so here's some more from my experience:

 '74 Westy  77K on first engine &lt;prev. owner&gt;, 108K on current engine.

 '72 Westy  Heads done at 95K &lt;prev. owner&gt; had 165K on it when I sold it.

 '64 camper Sucked the #3 exhaust valve every 40K, like clockwork! Sold at 175K.



 Best Regards,

 Dave
