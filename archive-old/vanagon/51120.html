For Sale:

'84 VW Vanagon
 114k miles
 4 speed manual transmission
 Factory AM/FM cassette
 Factory AC (did not produce cold air in '94 so the belt was removed)
 Two tone paint (cream on top, maroon on bottom), tan interior
 Bridgestone RD-603 LT 185R14 tires

I am the third owner of this bus and have been driving it daily since May
of '94.  I have repair records going back to the original owners.  It is
rust free and in near immaculate factory show room condition both inside
and out.  Asking $3500.
