Subject: Starter ?'s in '64 Bus


	Well...Ijust bought a rebuilt 6V starter for my '64 Bus.   
When I got the bus, it did not come with a starter in it, so I have a  
couple of questions.  Does it just bolt on?  It looks like two bolts  
hold it to the engine.  What size?  I would guess 13mm, but I'm not  
sure.  Are there nuts on the back of those bolts, or does it just  
bolt into the block somehow?  Is the solonoid supposed to end up on  
the bottom, or the top of the starter,or will it just only fit one  
way anyway?
	Also, the battery compartment is fairly rusted out, it is a  
'64, after all, so I was planning on putting the battery on the left  
side of the car instead of the right.  As far as I can tell, the only  
mod I need to do this is a longer wire to the starter.  Has anyone  
else done this, and knows what size works best?  I guess I'd also  
need to make a hole for the ground strap.  Is there anything special  
I need to do this, or can I just drill a hole and bolt the new  
ground-strap to the hole?  I know it has to be touching bare metal,  
not paint, but is there anything else important about it?  

	Also...How does the solonoid connect to the ignition coil?   
As far as I can tell...I run a hot (+) lead from the battery to the  
starter.  Then I ground the starter/solonoid unit, then run a wire  
from the (+) end of the soloniod to the (+) side of the ignition  
coil.  Then I just ground the coil to the engine somewhere.  Sound  
right?  Thanks for all the help..
