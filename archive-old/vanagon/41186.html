&gt; Hi all. Quick question. I need to repair or replace the screen on the
&gt; passenger side window of my 86 Westy(summer's Coming). Should I (can I) buy
&gt; a replacement or do I (can I) repair the one there now. The screen is
&gt; ripped at the bottom front corner and now is held in with duck tape. Thanks

Buy some fiberglass netting, not metal mesh.  Remove the screen frame 
carefully so as not to break the plastic clips.  Cut and trim the netting 
so that it just lays in the frame.  Glue in with a hot melt glue gun.  
Use glue sticks that give you a little time before they set up hard to 
allow you to time to align the screen.  Allow the glue to cure for an 
hour or so.  Reinstall.  Crack a beer and admire your handiwork.

If you're like me, you'll have to tack it back down in mid July after 
your wife leaves the window open for ventilation and the wind pulls the 
screen loose.  

Glue guns can be had for &lt; $10US, usually with a small assortment of sticks.

Jack
