&gt;Hi,
&gt;
&gt;I was just at the local hobby store and I noticed in one the magazines
&gt;that Revell/Monogram is re-introducing the air-cooled Vanagon Westy model.
&gt;Doesn't look too bad.  Similiar to the old 'Magnum PI' Revell Vanagon that
&gt;I have.  The Westy is coming out in March and can be mail ordered through
&gt;Hobby Heaven in MI, (616)453-1094 for $9.95 in March, or through your
&gt;local hobby store.  8-)

I'd love to find a nice Vanagon Westie toy / model.  Did anyone ever make one?

Ron
