&gt;THis second plate can be found riveted to the bulkhead behind the drivers
&gt;seat...unless some nurd removed it in which case your stuck!

        Better to say that the plate is behind the right-hand side of the
front seat, no?  This way it works regardless of which side of the road you
tend to drive on. :)
