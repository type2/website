&gt;I did 85 a few times on my way to the beach on 80 West dropping down into
&gt;Vallejo.  Mind you this was a '67 with a brand new tranny and a brand
&gt;new 1600.
&gt;Oh, and I had 1 meg of scantily clad surf betties, the mormon tabernacle
&gt;quire, a killer whale, 2 surfboards, wetsuits, and spam.

&gt;There seems to be an unusually high percentage of Python fans among Vanagon
&gt;owners. Perhaps we should add this to the database...
&gt;I think that it would be most appropriate for the Vanagon add to run with a
&gt;Norwegian Blue Parrot. i.e., &quot;If you hadn't nailed it to the hood...&quot;  or
&gt;Whump! &quot;Norwegian Blues stun easily....&quot;
&gt;BTW: Funny you should mention it, Joel, but I am going on vacation... I want
&gt;to see how many cans of Spam will fit in a Westie &lt;g&gt;

&gt;hmmm...Spam.._dot_come to think of it...Vanagons are shaped more like
&gt;Spam cans than bricks  :-)

i now have very serious doubts about the mental conditions of many of our
list members.

would that be spam-spam-eggs-bacon-and-spam? or spam-spam-spam-bacon-eggs-
and-spam?  and a dead parrot. with a lumberjack. in an argument.
