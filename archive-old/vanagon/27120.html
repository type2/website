Subject: RE: Left Lane drivers

I think I know why so many drivers like the left lane vs the right, in
Calif on I-5 through the valley, the right lane is the pits, chuckholes
every 15 feet. The left lane is cherry as it has less heavy truck traffic.
That is why I did it anyway....I always got over way ahead of anyone
wanting to pass me but I did get right back over into the left lane as
soon as I could afterward.
