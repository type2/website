   Check the spark plug wires first. Then the cap and rotor. This
   is usually the problem in wet weather.

&gt; Hi
&gt; 
&gt; I just bought an 89 Westy.  I've noticed that it has trouble
&gt; starting when it's very damp out.  I live in Montreal and it's
&gt; been raining alot lately.  I was told that adding gas-line 
&gt; anti-freeze will help.
&gt; 
&gt; Any comments?
