Subject: Re: A Manual Question

The Haynes is much more procedural and has explanations about how things 
work. Bentley has lots of useful drawings and detailed information, but 
often doesn't give you a nice procedure to fix something. If I had to choose 
only one, I'd get the Haynes. I've never seen a Haynes for water-cooled 
Vanagons, though, and assume that they don't exist.

&gt;Went to a local VW place today and picked up some &quot;dealer only &quot; 
&gt;stuff. While I was there, some guy was forking over $93 for the 
&gt;Bentley Manual. However, on their manual rack they had the Hayes 
&gt;(Haynes?) manual for all makes and models. For the Vanagon it looked 
&gt;a lot thinner than the Bentley one (not that this matters).  I was on my
&gt;way out when I saw the manuals sitting there, so I didn't get the price. 
&gt;
&gt;Can anyone give me a run-down on these. Are they as good as Bentley? 
&gt;Better? I'm sure it is mostly a matter of opinion, so all opinions 
&gt;invited.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Thanks
