It is easier to pass a Vanagon through the eye of a needle.....

Having brought one the other way here is where you may fall into trouble.
California was usually ahead of most states and Canada in legislating the
following items on a Vanagon: EGR, Catalytic Converter and O2 Sensor. The
crucial years in which these items appeared would be the very late 70s and
early eighties. After around the mid 80s the Canadian versions of the
Vanagon would match the California version in all respects. In other words
California versions of these early years (ie 82) would have all of these
components but the Canadian version would not (usual missing items would
be the O2 sensor or EGR). If your vehicle has all of the aforementioned
components 
there is no reason why it would not pass the tests imposed on California 
vehicles of the same year.
 Keep in mind the the CA smog check is more than just checking emissions,
it also entails checking that all the &quot;parts are there&quot; and functional. DC
