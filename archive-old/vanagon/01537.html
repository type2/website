Subject: pics and sounds


Thanks, John Gladu, for your contribution to the VW Bus world.  I've 
grabbed that image and the 67 bus and the logs and the sound of the VW 
starting and put them on the gopher server so more people can get to them.

To refresh,  gopher to halfdan.med.umn_dot_edu:/Miscellaneous/Vanagon

Have fun!
