Yep, I got several before the yahoos in our gummint decided they were 
&quot;dangerous&quot;.  The &quot;halon&quot; is an oxygen excluder used in aircraft and 
computer room fire suppression.  It's a heavy gaseous clean method for 
putting out fire without contaminating the area with particulates.

The esteemed feller who was worried about using a conductive fire retardant
on an engine fire needs to think a bit about what voltage source would be
available on a burning engine.  Frankly, none, unless you have a 110v or 
higher hot line laying across the vehicle.

And would I trade a dump of CFCs to save my Westie yep sure would.  But haven't
had to yet.
