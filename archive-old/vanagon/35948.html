&gt;&gt;I shut down and jumped out with my flashlight, thinking the fan belt had
&gt;&gt;broken, and checked the rear.  Belt is fine.  Alternator isn't moving
&gt;around.
&gt;&gt;Battery connections tight and clean.  Everything looks normal, no unusual
&gt;&gt;smells.  So I continued home (20+ miles) because I had to...  headlights
&gt;&gt;never dimmed; I had to use the wipers a few times 'cause it was *storming*
&gt;&gt;out there, but we shut off radio and interior lights.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Next morning (still pouring rain), I checked everything again.  A friend
&gt;&gt;checked the battery with a volt etc. meter which showed 12 volts in there.
&gt;&gt;Removed the voltage regulator, and he checked that too.  (Pardon me but I
am
&gt;&gt;completely stupid about things electrical)
&gt;
&gt;When you want to check to see if your charging system is working, check for
&gt;voltage at the battery.  It should be holding between 11.9  and 12.5 volts.
&gt; Then start the engine and rev the motor very briefly to about 2000 RPM to
&gt;set the alternator to charging, allow the engine to idle and check the
&gt;voltage at the battery.  The voltage when running should definitely be
higher
&gt;than when sitting.   The charging voltage would ideally be 13.8 volts.  The
&gt;lowest tolerable charging voltage is 12.8 volts while all electricals are
&gt;being used.  Then, Shut the engine off, and check battery voltage at the
&gt;exact moment that the starter is in operation.  The voltage should not drop
&gt;below 9 volts.  If your voltage is lower than that, completely charge the
&gt;battery with a charger.  Do not attempt to diagnose a charging/starting
&gt;problem with a low or &quot;iffy&quot; batttery.  It is like beating your head against
&gt;a masonry wall.

Well, I have a hot wire sitting in front of me.  About 8 inches from the
connection to the starter, this wire is melted through, and had been patched
(in the distant past) in two places near the meltdown with electrical tape.
 The wire shorted against the body and creamed my alternator.  The insulation
is brittle and flaky... no suprise, right??  A new alternator, battery wiring
and harness and I'm back on the road. In my haste, I took the bus to my bus
guy, many bucks spent here.  Oh well, I'm on the road again, and have learned
another lesson: There's more to the electrical system than meets the eye when
opening the engine lid - I NEVER would have thought to look UNDER the bus for
bad wiring... or maybe I would have, given enough time, being dry and comfy,
but...   :(
