Subject: Eurovan Westy 92 gasoline heater

Hi,

Bought my Eurovan new in 1992.  It has a gasoline furnace.  The furnace
is seldom used and when needed rarely works.  Lately it is completely

Anyone know where I can get some tech manuals so that I can safely
repair it myself ?  Any other suggestions ?

Thanks
