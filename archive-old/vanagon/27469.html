&gt;Ok, let's really open this can of worms.  I've yet to hear/see anything 
&gt;that totally disenchants me from the notion of hydrogen fuels, outside of 
&gt;the technological challenges, which as we all know are not 
&gt;insurmountable.  And like photovoltaics, once the market starts to 
&gt;recognize hydrogen as a viable alternative fuel, the price will drop to 
&gt;acceptable levels.

Where I work we have been running research vehicles on hydrogen for many
years. Some have had conventional engines that can run on hydrogen or
petrol, the current ones have fuel cells/metal hydride. I don't know too
much detail about the projects but the biggest hurdle seems to be how to
make it in sufficient quantities for widspread use. Electrolyzing water
needs electricty and that still has to be generated somewhere.
