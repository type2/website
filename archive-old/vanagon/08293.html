&gt; For those like Stuart who have leaking seals due to blow-by, a powder

No, actually my seals don't now leak all that much, amazingly enough. Oh they
do leak, but the real problem that causes an instant need to clean the 
vanagon's rear is ... not getting the oil cap on tight enough.  I am just
going to have to resolve myself to using channel locks to put it on an
take it off.  If I do that, the problem is not so bad.  But, if I don't
then that thing will blow out about 1 1/2 quarts of oil in under 15 min
at highway speeds.  My wife and I are thinking about methods of putting oil
into the thing without having to open the oil cap.  One idea ... install a
switch in the front which runs to a gallon tank of oil and an old windshield
washer pump. :)  Stuart Hutton
