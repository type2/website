Very cool!  But they didn't start FI till '75.  For '74 they went from
1700cc to 1800cc.

For 1973 they added the hatch above the engine - might be worth a
verse.

I added/changed the next few, for your amusement!

&gt; If you drive a Seven-Four,
&gt;    It's some better than before,
  One hundred extra cubic C's
	 3 more horsepower to fight the breeze!
&gt; 
&gt; If you drive a Seven-Five,
&gt;    go and take it for a drive,
&gt; Cause it's now got E-F-I,
&gt;    Fuel Injection,  squirts your eye!
&gt; 
&gt; If you drive a Seven-Six,
&gt;    You must learn a lot of tricks,
&gt; Have to hold your mouth just right
&gt;    Or you have no lights at night!

&gt; If you drive a Double-Seven,
&gt;    You be ridin in seven(th) heaven
&gt; Cause the year before was so right
&gt;    There's nary a change in sight
&gt; 
&gt; If you drive a Seven-Eight,
	 To drive it you'll have less of a wait.
  Hydraulic lifters make me sway,
	 No more valve adjust every 3K.
&gt; 
&gt; If you drive a Seven-Nine,
&gt;    Get yourself a glass of wine
  If you're tipsy you won't cry
	 When those Vanagon heads run your wallet dry.
