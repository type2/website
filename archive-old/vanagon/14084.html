Subject: Re: Banging

I had this problem a few weeks ago whilst holidaying in Devon.
The knocking occured whilst travelling uphill, the steeper the
hill, the louder the knocking, at one point sounding as though
the wheel was going to fall off....
But...
Can anyone explain why this knocking stopped after I had jacked
up the van and let it down again, even going up steeper hills
produced no more knocking.
I checked the CV's anyway, dry, so I replaced both on the previously
noisy side and repacked the rest.

Cheers

&gt; If you're driving along, right, and you hear this really bad banging 
&gt; noise, don't assume it's your engine lid which doesn't shut properly. 
&gt; It might be your CV joint.
