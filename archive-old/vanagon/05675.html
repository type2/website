Subject: front end woes

Using one of our local 8&quot; curbs, I managed to reset the front end
alignment on my '78 to the point where it cannot be set correctly. (the
long way of saying I bent it beyond repair). In search of a solution, I 
went out and bought a really nice looking used front axle beam. After 
hefting it, I have decided that if I can get away with replacing only the 
trailing arms, I will be way ahead of the game (and may even avoid a 
hernia).  Before I do, I wanted to check the replacement trailing arms 
for straightness.  The manual shows a jig that VW shops are supposed to 
have that does this check, but none of the DC/MD/VA VW dealers have the 
jig.  Does anyone (are you listening,joel?) have the correct dimensions 
for the arms?  that is the x and y offsets from the centerline of the 
shaft at the insertion plane to the center of the ball joint?  Does 
anyone know where one of these jigs might be found?  Am I better off 
replacing the whole front beam?  OK, Joel, Ric, David, David, etal lay the 
WORD on me....
