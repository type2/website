Subject: Re powering `82 Diesel with 1.9 Turbo Diesel (not TDI) 

Been away from the list for a while, good to be back. I'm about to re
power my `82 Westy Diesel with a 1.9L Turbo Diesel. It pretty much looks
like a drop in with a few minor changes. Of course, I'll still have the
old 4speed, which brings me to my real question...Is the gas 4 speed the
same gear ratio as the diesel 4 speed? As it stands, I'll probably have a
top speed of about 60-65mph, which is Ok but it'd be nice to see
75-80mph.

Any suggestions?
