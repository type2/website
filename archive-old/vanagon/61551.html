&gt;Congratulations! It's always a great moment when it actually runs
&gt;after tearing it apart and playing with it.
&gt;	A couple questions.  Did you use the 1.9 fuel injection or the
2.1?
&gt;Also, the same about the coolant hoses, water pump, etc.

Don, Thank you.

To answer your questions:

I am presently using the 1.9 FI System with one exception - because I am
using a 2.1 case, I had to use a 2.1 Center Plenum (which came with the
core motor) as specified in the VW fiche and in Bentley.  What they don't
say in Bentley or the fiche is that you also have to use the 2.1 Intake
Runners to the Cylinder Heads as well, but again they came with the core
motor.  The reason is the boot/sleeves for the 1.9 Plenum to Intake
Runners are just a hair too small for the 2.1 Plenum, so you have to use
the 2.1 style - but then these are too large to use with the 1.9 Intake
Runners to the Cylinder Heads to clamp down suffciently to prevent vacuum
leaks.  Just something I guess you learn with experience.

As to the cooling system, everything from the 1.9 including Water
Pump/Thermo Housing bolts/installs right in with no hassles at all.  I
did try to use the 2.1 oil cooler but could not adequately modify the
existing 1.9 cooling system for the proper flow of coolant.  At least not
without extensively (and expensively) retrofitting almost an entire 2.1
cooling package, hoses, etc.  So I pulled the cooler off and reinstalled
the shorter oil filter nipple for now.  Maybe I'll figure something out
later.

I did want to install the cooler thermofan switch (251-959-481K), but I
am finding it VERY DIFFICULT to find someone with a 29mm Deep Socket to
remove and replace (No room for a wrench at all).  But the existing fan
switch is working just fine for now.  Even Sears/Craftsman couldn't help
on this one, so the next MAC or Snap-On Tools Truck I see will be flagged
down to see if such an animal can be obtained.

BTW, although not mentioned, but questioned by others, the following new
items weren't on the list but were also replaced with new:

**Main Bearing, Rod Bearing, Cam Bearing &amp; Thrust Washer Sets
**Piston/Cylinders (2.1)
**Appropriate Gaskets and Seals

Figure I got about $1300 plus the original $1000 purchase price wrapped
up in this adventure, including the new Fuel Pump, Rebuilding Injectors,
etc., so far.

Thanks to Jon Hathaway and Unca Joel for their informative thoughts on
the Tri-Electrode Spark Plugs.  I will be throwing them in as soon as I
can.

Went and got the insurance today.  Only $290.60 for years worth at
Farmer's Insurance Group, about 1/3 to 1/2 of what everyone else locally
wanted.  Includes Uninsured Motorists, etc.

DMV fees were $102 because of late reporting the ownership transfer,
registration expiration.  Got a Temp Permit for now because the smog test
still has to be done.

Gonna have that done next week at Oasis VW Repair.  Redding is not
blessed (or cursed) with a Dealership, but Oasis is an &quot;Authorized
VW-Audi Repair Facility&quot; and Chuck &amp; Steve (the owners) know their stuff,
very fair with their pricing and they know how to dial this thing in just
right.  Kudos to them for showing me ahead of time about a few tricks to
bleeding the cooling system too.  A lot of smog stations here in Redding
don't like or won't touch a Vanagon.  So I might pay a little more, but I
know it will be done right.  The reason for next week is that they're
booked solid until Wednesday.  Thas OK, I've been waiting 13 months -
another week ain't gonna hurt.  I'll drop it off at 8:30AM and take my
mountain bike with me to take a leisurely ride up the Sacramento River
Trail for a couple hours while they dial it in.  Another reason is that
the PO had screwed the CO screw ALLTHE WAY IN to the bottom, so I have no
idea without a proper CO tester to know where to properly set it.  I'll
let the experts figure it out and go from there.

Again - Thanks To All
