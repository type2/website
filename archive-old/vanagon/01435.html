Subject: Re: reasonable mpg?

On a GEX rebuilt aircooled (82 Vanagon 2 l) with about 5000 miles on it 
we averaged about 22 mpg on the highway (from CA - Hoover Institution to 
Carleton University Canada). Mileage will improve over 
time, but a bigger concern is to make sure there are no manifold leaks 
and that the engine is &quot;tuned&quot; properly.  PS try either Fred's Garage in  
Redwood or Greg's VW in Menlo Park for superb and inexpensive VW service.

&gt; Since most of the figures for mileage were for vangons, and mostly
&gt; water-cooled at that, I was wondering if someone can tell me if
&gt; the 10-12 mpg I am getting on a recently (1000 mi.) overhauled
&gt; engine is as pathetic as I think or if it's par for the course.
