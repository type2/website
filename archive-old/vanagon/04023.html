&gt; lemme see if i get this right: Ric and myself account for over 25 percent of
&gt; the traffic on this list? awright, people: you folks are not trying!!!
&gt; you only get OUT of a club/list/whatever what you put INTO it!! state some
&gt; opinions? even stupid ones. it's ok to be stupid ... look at Ric. :) (and
&gt; he's a LAWYER!!! and doesn't even like Possum Pie!)
&gt; 
&gt; well, seriously, i'm a bit chagrined (is that like a lop-sided smile?).
&gt; well ... ok. maybe not.

I think you got the posts backword Joel!  Did you get Gerry's corrected
post?  Even I fell for the old one! ;)  I think I've already posted
enough drivel for the day.  And I keep makin' typos by the dozen.  
Obviously Ric's not readin' today.  Must be at one of his big Lawyer
Banquets.  You know, &quot;Pass the Grey Poupou, please...&quot;  ;)
