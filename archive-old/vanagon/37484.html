&gt;Replacement size of the reduction plate bolts is the metric  1.5 x 50 x 35mm
&gt;length. Use matching sized thick wavy washers behind the bolts and torque
&gt;them down to spec. I know the size because I just had to replace them on the
&gt;'67 Westy Resto. Accidentily bought the 40mm length and they were too long.
&gt;Forget the lock-tite (in my opinion)! Just find the correct torque spec and
&gt;inspect them as you change the oil every three thousand or as needed.  I
&gt;paid about $.90 per bolt at PEPBOYS and saved many $$ and time in agony
&gt;trying to get broken bolts out of the reduction box.  I guess that if you
&gt;have been driving on loose bolts then they have been buggered and could
&gt;stand replacement. Do it right and do it once.

In addition to the size of the bolts, the grade is important.  Almost all el
cheapo bolts are grade 8.8  These bolts should be grade 10.9 or better.  The
grade 8.8 will fail again.
