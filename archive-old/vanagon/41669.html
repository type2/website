Subject: Thoughts, and maybe a Westy for me..

well, i figured i'd toss this situation out to you all, and you could 
fill me in as you wished with watever info you want..

my 68 is quite dead, what with its '65 engine &lt;stock from valve cover to 
valvecover&gt; that only cost me 100$, parts from there, here, and other 
that way too, all cobbled toghethor..it still works, but it dies more 
each day...my 74 has mega raindeer damage to the front, needs a tranny 
and an engine...

so, i have the opportunity to get a 73 or 74 Westy, for 75$...(yes, 75$US..)
its been sitting for a while, and before this guy got it, it sat then 
too...the interior needs tremendous cleaning and such, plus fixing up, 
but looks better than my 68..needs new whatchamacallit for the poptop..jc 
whitney price of 259 or 269, wheter its 73 or 74..but that can come 
later..the body is fairly solid, with a few dents, and a few rust holes, 
nothing really super major...needs tires..(recommendations for a 
lowlowlow budget?) 

the engine, on the other ahdnd, i know virtually nothing of..i DO know 
that it doesnt have any carb at all..just 4 little pipes converging on 
air in the center of the motor..i figure i can get it running then find 
out how much trouble is underneeth the sheetmetal..

any recommendations for a carb? and price range i can expect for a used 
one? 

also, if you could clear up a rumor that i was told by a notso reliable 
source..&lt;havent looked myselft, the bus is 50 miles away, in a yard that 
is shoot before sight...only looked at the bus once sofar..&gt;that the bus 
will take acertian Chevy rim..that the bold patterns ar ethe same..any truth?

anyway, apreciat what you can contribute..btw: its orange, just lik by 
super..
&lt;or whatever the color is, according to my mom..&gt;
thanks...
