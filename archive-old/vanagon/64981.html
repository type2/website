&gt;Subject: Westi window screens

&gt; I have found a set of Westi side windows with the screens but no
&gt; screen material in them,so:
&gt; 1. How hard is it to remove the screens from the windows?

Not very.  There are &quot;clips&quot; at the bottom of the screen frame that must
be _gently_ pulled back to remove the screen frame.  You break it, you
bought it since the frame won't stay in place very well without these
clips.

&gt; 2. Can they be rescreened once they are off?

Yep.  Get some fiberglass screening material from a hardware store.  Cut
to fit the inside of the frame, then glue in place with a hot melt glue
gun.  I've done this several times on my screens.  The only reason I have
to keep redoing it is that my wife forgets to close the window and the air
rushing through it breaks the bead of glue.  An easy repair, though.

Jack
