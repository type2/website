Subject: Splittie engine swapping

A friend of mine is considering buying a '61 kombi.  The body is apparently
immaculate, but he's troubled that it *might* be underpowered.  I stiffled a
snicker and said  &quot;That's the way it is, man&quot;, but he wants me to find out
how easy it is to swap engines with, say, a later model breadloaf. (I'm
pretty sure he'd want to keep it a VW engine) I DON't think he's into
modifying the current (36hp, right?) engine.  I poked around the archives
and FAQs and couldn't come up with an answer for him.  Any comments?  He's
also wondering how much extra power the reduction boxes will take . . .?

Peace,
