&gt;Actually, that's in my neighborhood! Another good place to go is the dump.
&gt;You take some stuff with you that you want to throw away (you must have
&gt;something, or else you wouldn't have bought the truck, right?) and they
&gt;weigh you on the way in, and on the way out. The one I go to is on Zanker
&gt;Road out past 237 near Milpitas.
&gt;
This reminds me of going to the coal depot with my Dad as a kid. When they 
weighed the bus on the way in, he would always leave me sat in the back. On 
the way out I would go with him while he payed for the busload of coal. I 
must have been worth at least an extra sack or two!
