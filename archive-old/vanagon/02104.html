Subject: da trip


(1) Are we gettin enough traffic on this topic to merit getting off the
list? Non-participants comment please?

(2) Im interested in something next spring but, being uncertain about my
plans that far in advance one uncertainty (May 95) is as good as another
(Fall 1995?) I'll be in Albany NY area and am interested in a Northen 
Canada leg as well as midwest. 

More ideas:

	create a mini news group for coordinating meeting, repair plans
while we are on the road (a couple of laptops to stay in the
info superhighway)

	a sick-bus detail, maybe we can chip in for a stash of spares to
follow us around (lots of things to consider here - modest cash donation
for parts, hit up Recycled Inc for a bunch of spares in exchange for
:national advertising&quot;  :-), 

	master list of repair shops (user  recommended) and
(ugh) VW dealers, good parts stores

babble ......

(can you tell i run a facility for a living ???)
