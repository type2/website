Subject: antennas (FUBAR) /f

&lt;FRIDAY&gt;

Rather than install something in the stock location, I installed a
FUBAR antenna in the engine compartment.  Just like the units found
on Pintos.  They are available from Lillian Vernon and many other
locations in versions with and without leads to the starter
solenoid. I chose the one with.

The hardest part of the installation was running the antenna cable
through the plastic coolant tubes under the van.  There was
sufficient coax cable provided to reach all the way including 
securing the cable by wrapping a few lenghts around the #3 cylinder 
exhaust port, except I had to drill a hole in the engine tin to get 
access.  I installed the unit by drilling and tapping a hole in the 
AC high-pressure hose since it seemed solid enough.  

Looks very nice, works like crap.  The battery seems to short out
when I start the van and I hear a crackling sound in the engine
compartment, smoke is coming out of my cassette tape player, the
antenna keeps melting when the van gets up to temperature (which
seems to overheat and lose LOTS of coolant; I think it is happening
at the coolant tubes under the van), picks up lots of whining from
the starter and now my AC doesn't work any more (low pressure switch
doesn't let the clutch kick in, so I bypassed it and now the
compressor has a funny whining sound like a kitchen disposal when
you turn off the water).  I chose the engine compartment version
because I wanted it to be out of sight.  My whole van seems to be
FUBARed.  I don't get it... 

Anyway, the phone number for the company is 1-800-FUBAR-ME

&lt;/FRIDAY&gt;

;-)  I saw this message yesterday and couldn't resist saving it for
today.  No offense intended to the original poster.  :-)
