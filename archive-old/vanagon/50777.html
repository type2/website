Subject: Re: New Eurovans FS

They've also invaded the SF Bay Area.  I got a call a few weeks ago from
Boardwalk VW in Redwood City and I stopped with my son this evening and saw
two at Stevens Creek VW in San Jose.  They are nice and expensive.  But to
be the devil's advocate so is everything else out there.  The  salesman
said they were only available with the automatic.  

Does anyone have any info on the possibility of getting a stick version in
the future?  I've rowed all of my buses and am not sure I could deal with
an auto.  I am sure that I couldn't afford a camper now anyway.
