Subject: Re: Bosch 009 on T4?

I have a 009 dist. on my newly rebuilt type four engine.  I can't get 
the right setup for the distributor.  Number 2 and number 4 cylinders 
are not firing.  I have checked the intake, points, spark plugs, plug 
-------

I had a 009 distribtor on the 2 litre FI motor in my old 73 camper for years.
 It ran great.  After I sold the bus i heard from a reliable source you can't
do that.

anyway,    remember firing order 1 4 3 2

At TDC (or close enough, i don't know you timing off hand and that'd all a
mare's nest, i do it by ear while playing with the timing light.
 Stroboscopic Timing lights are good for making sure your spark is
advancing.) for #1  the rotor should point towards the notch on the
distributor rim.   There is always a chance that the distibutor drive shaft
got put in backwards, and that will be #3

turn the motor rounds by hand to make sure it's sparking at all four   Set
the timing statically first (by turning it by hand with the key on and the
plug wire for the coil held a hair away from a ground.)

hope this helps.
