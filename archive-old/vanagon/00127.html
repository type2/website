Subject: Under bench Propane heater
Date: Thu, 7 Apr 94 8:49:49 PDT


I was requested to post this so here goes.

I met a couple in the Cameron Park (CA) that had a '91 Syncro.  They
showed me a neat propane heater setup they had.  The heater is made
and sold only in Germany.  The heater is about the size of a large
thermos and is mounted under the bench seat.  It has two small vacuum
cleaner type hoses that are used to route the air for circulation.
The way they had it was just routed to the panel at the front of the
seat.  The heater exhaust goes out the bottom of the van.  This a
possible safety issue on this but I've talked to an RV place that 
will mount it but will not warranty it.  There is also a thermostatic
control that they mounted on their closet cabinet and looked much like
a home thermostat control.  I thought it was a nice touch.  They had
theirs mounted in Germany (they bought the van there).  Since I met
them, I have kept touch with them and they know a gug in San Jose that
owns a Vanagon Camper and put one of these in himself and would probably
be glad to show me how also.  I haven't contacted him yet, but will soon.
Oh, the heater gets its source of propane from the existing propane tank
and based on what they said, it does not use up the propane too fast.  I
would imagine for a weekend trip it would be fine.  If you wanted to use
it for more than that, then more trips to get more propane would be in 
order, I'm not sure how often.  I don't know the name of the company
that makes them but I'll try to find out.  I do know the cost of the
unit is ~ $500.00 and to have it installed is ~ $500.00.  So, if your
all interested, I'll keep you posted.

I'll empty my mail folder, cause I just know there's going to be flood soon ;)

Cheers!

Steven
