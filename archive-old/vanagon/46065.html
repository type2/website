Subject: Baywindow parts FS in New York

Hi folks,

I bumped into a fellow at the Litchfield, CT show who mentioned he had a 
variety of baywindow bus parts for sale.  His # is (914) 362-0689 and 
located in Rockland Co. NY (according to this scrap of paper I have).  I 
vaguely recall he had some body parts at the meet, but I believe he had a 
lot more that he left home.
