Gerry,
I had to do this on my '78 to replace something in the column.  If they 
did not change the design, then the story goes like this:

The bolt as sold:   --      --
                   |  |_  _|  |   - Allen socket head 
                   |    ||    |
                   |___ || ___|
                       /||\       - real skinny neck
                      / || \        (note the tiny drilled hole)
                    /       \
                    \       /     - threads
                    /       \
                    \       /
                     etc., etc.

As the bolt is torqued the head breaks off, leaving no way to extract 
it.  This is for obvious security reasons.  (The first thing every car 
thief I ever met wanted to do was remove the Steering wheel, right?)  ;-%
Anyhow, the way to remove it is to go, buy an extractor set and matching 
drill bits.  If you are real lucky, the smallest will fit in the tiny 
hole left in the bolt  &quot;head&quot;, otherwise drill the head and use an 
extractor to remove the bolt.  Extractors are tools that have a mild 
taper and left hand threads, as you turn them in a hole, they tighten 
when turned counter clockwise and (with luck) unscrew the broken of bolt.


If this isn't clear, post again and I will try to be clearer.
