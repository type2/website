Subject: Re: Rain in your Vanagon

&lt;&lt;Greetings! Any Vanagonites (or otherwise) had experience with rainwater
leaking from behind dash? &gt;&gt;

I have an '83 Vanagon, and it does leak around the windshield.  I thought 
this was because a buck came out of nowherre a few years back, hit our 
left front with incredible force, flipped around, and smashed THROUGH the 
windshield into my husband's lap, breaking his glasses but luckily not 
his head.  We got the windshield fixed, but it does leak a little...

If you look closely, there is still deer hair at the initial point of 
impact.._dot_can anyone ELSE make that claim about their van??  :)

Nancy
