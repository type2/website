Subject: vapor lock type troubles

I'm suffering from vapor lock type troubles in my '82/'84 vanagon on my way
from Minnesota to California.  The symptoms are if I drive in the afternoon
heat, it stutters and dies and then when I open the bleeder screw, lot of
&quot;air&quot; (presumably vaporized gas) comes out of the bleeder.  If I drive in the
evening after the sun has gone down, the problem never arises.  I've gotten a
few other suggestions, but I'm not hopeful.

I dug this article out of the archives. It sounds more hopefule than other
things and it rings true with something Joel Walker shared with me. If anyone
has any clearer information about what is involved in this, I'd really
appreciate email about it.   What does he mean by &quot;header&quot;?  Were they
drilling a hole in the tank with gas still in it?

Any clues would be appreciated.
