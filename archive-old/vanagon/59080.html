Subject: Re: propane gauge?

When I first bought my last '91 I went to my local (well known, good rep)
RV dealer/service center to have a gauge installed. I had often gotten grief
on the road when filling the gas by people who didn't know Westies about
not having a gauge. So I figured on the '91 I'd get one installed.

The RV service center said that this kind of tank with its fittings could not
be retrofitted with a gauge - and that anyone who really knew much about 
filling tanks should be able to fill it OK.

Thus we took the info from the VW Camper manual and figured about how much
gas the stove and frige used for how long etc. and went on that. In a 7 1/2
week trip west - from MA to So UT, up to Alberta and back across Canada - 
we filled the tank once before starting and twice on the trip. The first 
filling in the Tetons wasn't done correctly and we did have some problems -
the guy really didn't know what he was doing (we could tell) and let most of 
the gas back out. That tank lasted 1 1/2 weeks!

We ran the frig on propane ALL of the time we were parked, even if at the 
grocery store, etc. We cooked 2 meals per day, although breakfast was not a
big meal. We had tea in the evenings. It was hotter than hell in Arches - and
we were parked for most of the time in the NP. 

We have learned not to worry too much about the propane. It really seems to
go a looooong way!

&gt; Awhile ago I asked if anyone had ever installed a propane gauge to their
&gt; tank.  I have gotten a number of estimates on how long the gas will last
&gt; but no answers about the gauge.  It must be able to be done if there is
&gt; enough room.  I guess that's my question.  I too am having troubles getting
&gt; the fridge to run on gas.  Have tried all the easy suggestions, now I guess
&gt; we have to get down to the serious stuff.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks in advance for info
