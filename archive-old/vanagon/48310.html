Subject: '84 Westy: Broken down in NY...HELP!

Hey all!  Betty finally died _at_ 175,000 plus miles in Fredonia NY, south of
Buffalo.  I'm 10,000 miles into my x-country trip and have been suffering
without my vanagon list since June.

Betty's Symptons:  water temp light began flashing, gauge needle failed.  We
stopped immediately and checked coolant.  Refill tank boiling over.  Coasted
to a parking lot and let engine cool.  Checked for leaks in radiator; level
was low.  Oil level was OK, but as soon as engine turns over, the light
flashes amd temp rises; white smoke out of tailpipe, awful smell, sounds bad.

I have talked to a few mechanics.  Diagnosis: head gasket.  :-(  I'm willing
to have a new/rebuilt engine put in (I have no choice since I have to go
home).  Recommendations for help?  AAA will tow me to Buffalo, but I'm not
comfortable with that unless I get list approval/advice for a way to go
about this endeaver. 
I miss this list and can't wait to catch up on what's happening.  Once all
is settled, I will tell the tale of a wonderful yet turbulent adventure.
This breakdown unfortunately ends the trip 1/2 way through, but I can't
complain with the amazing amoung of mileage on Betty.  

Being stranded and all, I am communicating through a friend near Ithaca, NY
-- please reply to him DIRECTLY (as well as the list) since he is not a
member.  I'll be checking in periodically.  E-mail can be sent to

(formally of Burlington, VT, now residing in Portland OR, currently stranded
in Fredonia, NY.
