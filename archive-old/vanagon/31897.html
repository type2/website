Thanks Gary,

This morning I determined the same thing (about the headlights).  Buy =
those German engineers are really smart.  Oh by the way.  This morning =
it was 29 degrees F and the Bus fired right up.  I'll keep you all =
informed.  I think the solonoid is okay but I'll to the Muir check as =
soon as the weather warms up a bit.

You might try to figure out if it's the starter solenoid.  Sounds a
little like what was happening with mine, although with mine it didn't
like getting hot either.  Can you hear the solenoid click?  If you
tap on it with a hammer does it suddenly agree to cooperate?

&gt;ights would light=20
&gt;but not the headlamps.

This is probably not it, but the Vanagon headlights won't come
on when the engine isn't running, unless the key is in the on
position... you already knew that?  I thought so :)
