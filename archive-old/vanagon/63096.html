Hello Volks:

Congratulations and thanks to Ron and Chris for undertaking the
monumental task of running the list.  Hope everything goes smoothly
for you guys.

Does anybody know where I can find the plastic trim piece for the dual
power window switches on the driver's side door?  The pins that
protruded from mine were broken off, so the switches do not fasten
securely to the door.

TIA,

Victor Wong
