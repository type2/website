&gt; i drove in last night and a few minutes later I found coolant on the
&gt; ground, more to the end of the rear end; it looked like what Bessie
&gt; would do when running hot...boil over and dump the water. I thought
&gt; it strange becasue the idiot light didn't go off saying he's really
&gt; hot(neithre did Bessie's). It was extrememly HOT as it was outside,
&gt; it topped at 104'!! ITwas hot enough that I couldn't touch the access
&gt; door  to check the bottle for water. It was empty when I did check it.
&gt; ..the water's all in the system I gather.

We seem to be having a rash of this problem.  Mine did the same a little
while ago.  I was advised on the list to check the preasure valve on the
coolant tank.  If you can suck air thru it, it's bad.  Mine was.  Were
all problems so simple.
