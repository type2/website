&gt;      Hi All,
&gt;      
&gt;      The light behind the fader and first two preset buttons on my VW 
&gt;      Design (original equipment) AM/FM/Cassette radio no longer light up 
&gt;      when the headlights are on. Does this indicate a loose connection or

&gt;      that it's time for a new radio? Are there replaceable light bulbs in
a 
&gt;      VW Design radio?
&gt;      
&gt;      TIA,
&gt;

There's a small 5amp fuse on the back side of the radio. If you reach under
the dash there are two clips on each side of the radio. Push them in and
the radio slides out.

If you need a new radio I posted one for sale a few weeks ago and it's
still available.
