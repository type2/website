Subject: Neat camping toy. Attn: Martha R.



Under the subject of &quot;neat camping stuff&quot; I recently 
saw an ad for a self-contained, woodburning 
waterboiler. It is made of stainless steel , about 1.5' tall 
and about 8&quot; in diameter. It is shaped roughly like a 
thermos flask, but with oblong slots and fire chamber 
in the bottom and a chimmney that runs up the center. 
A water jacket surrounds the chimmney with a short 
spout/plug at the top to one side. You feed small twigs 
down the chimmney or through the slots at the bottom 
and it is supposed to heat the water up quickly using 
minimal fuel. The water capacity is around one or two 
quarts. It looks very well made and I think a steal at 37 
pounds.

BTW. I saw the ad in a British flyfishing magazine.


I also have heard of, but not seen, a gadget that heats up a resevoir of
water via a metal &quot;rod&quot; about 2' long that is &quot;plunged&quot; into the campfire.
I guess that the rod is simply a tight &quot;u&quot; bend and the water flows down to
the bend by gravity and rises out back to the resevoir when it is heated,
a self sustaining thermosiphon.
It is made/marketed by some guy in the interior of B.C., I'll see if I can
get more info.
