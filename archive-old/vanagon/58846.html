Subject: HELP!!!

On the way home from work today, my 81 westy started running really
rough and smoking.  The exhaust smelled strongly of gas and died if I
took my foot off the gas.  I got it home, checked all the connections
(and looked for broken wires) in the fule injection system with no
luck.  I then disconnected the air flow meter, and the thing idled
fine.  Of course, it won't drive like that.  As soon as I reconnected
the air flow meter, it died.  Has my air flow meter gone bad?  Or does
anybody have any ideas?
Its a 2.0 air cooled and a daily driver with 116k.  Any help would be
appreciated.
Chaz
