Hey all,
	Joel's got a good point. CB radios are cheaper, more practical,
and a heck of a lot more fun than cellular. A friend of mine offered to
lend me one of his for free. No license needed, but a quick look through
Radio Shacks CB book (title?) is helpful. I'm also going to bring a
short wave reciever along. I've got a Grundig YB-400. Cute little
digital, about the size of a paperback. Any other BBC-heads out there?
Boop...Boop...Boop...BOOOOOOP!
