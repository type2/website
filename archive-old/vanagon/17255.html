Subject: Re: CB Antennas and stuff

Joel-You are absolutely right about the linear amps.  A few people have 
been prosecuted for using them.  Usually turned in by hams.  The use of 
the amplifiers bleed into other bands including the 10m and 15m ham 
bands.  They have also been known to bleed onto local 2 way radio(police 
bands).  A loop sounds like a possible idea, I don't know if it has been 
done on CB, but has been on ham.  Then again, you can usually do well on 
ham with a simple wire dipole antenna.

&gt; &gt;isn't good.  What I wanted to do was put full length antenna (maybe 2?) up

&gt; 
&gt; hmmm. that's a thought. anybody know anything about &quot;loop&quot; antennas? like
&gt; having one big loop around the inside of the pop-top? if it works for the
&gt; old tv sets, why wouldn't it work for a cb transmitter??
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;and traded the tape player for the option.  I like it a lot but need some
&gt; &gt;more power.  Is there a booster I can add?
&gt; 
&gt; as i understand it, the only thing you can LEGALLY do is to take the radio
&gt; to a radio-repair person and have him/her tweek the set to obtain the
&gt; maximum legal output. otherwise you can get an illegal linear amplifier and
&gt; put in the line from the set to the antenna.
&gt; 
&gt; but all that does is make you much louder much farther away. i'm not sure
&gt; what it does for your reception. and finding one of low enough power might
&gt; be a problem ... most are made for ham radios and are up in the 100 watt
&gt; range (whereas the normal cb radio is allowed 5 watts output). those linear
&gt; amplifiers are also illegal as hell. :) even though lots of turckers use
&gt; them, and the FCC seems to have just given up on cb radio, it's still illegal.
&gt; 
&gt; any hams wanna comment?
