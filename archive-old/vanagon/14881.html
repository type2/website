&gt; &gt; My wife says I need to get her re-painted before she'll ride in her, so for
&gt; &gt; now, I am thinking of a cheap and quick Earl Scheib job, unless someone out
&gt; &gt;there convinces me that the cost / appearance trade-off makes it worth shelling
&gt; &gt; out more $$ (how much?) for a better job.
&gt; 
&gt; For maybe $50 more, go to MAACO instead.  Much better paint quality than
&gt; Scheib - may even last a couple of years.  Avoid One Day Paint and Body.
&gt; All IMHO, of course.

Hey, I'd like to stress with either option you can do a lot yourself
to make the job a great deal better, lets face it they spray OK quality
paint the problem is they do no or little surface prep, if you must go
with these options do yourself a favor, do whatever cheap body work you
think you can, wash her down with a good soap degreaser in water a few times,
then degrease once with a good auto paint degreaser and wet sand her
with 320 or 400 grit yourself all over real good to provide tooth,
degrease a couple times more with the good degreaser then take it
wherever, if you do such prep and they spray a reasonable qualitiy top
coat reasonably well (which they probably will) you should be able to
get 3 to 5 years out of the paint if you keep it waxed and avoid
pressure washes and the like, your total investment would probably be
less than $30 in degreaser and sandpaper and your time of course but the
results should be well worth it. If you go with Earl you might want to
mask the windows yourself (except the ones needed to drive) as you will
undoubtedly do a better job.
