Subject: Help installtion Aux.battery 1985 westy

 Hello Vanagon list, I would like to install a deep cycle aux. Battery
under the rear seat of a 1985 Westy. I have read that a battery isolator is
not good,but should use a high amp relay(how high of an amp?). Local RV
store wants $45 for a battery cut-out relay. Anyone know a cheaper
alternative? Could you not use, say a 1970's Ford starter relay? (Cost $6).
Looking at the wiring diagram of a 1986 (Bentley) could you just mount the
relay under seat or in  engine compartment, use a short battery cable from
Aux.battery positive to terminal 87 of relay and a 3-4 foot cable ran from
terminal 30 of relay to terminal 30 on the Starter (would be easier than
running the cable to the main battery) Splice into the blue alternator
wire(to dash light) to power relay (term.86) and ground term. 85 of
relay.Thoughts? Suggestions?
