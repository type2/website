Hey all,
	I have a question that's bugged me for a while.  When I first
got my bus, a 1973 1700cc beauty, it had already been converted to a
single solex.  The first (AND LAST!) mechanic I took it to talked me
into switching to a single weber instead of a single solex (on top of
ripping me off for some engine repairs$$$).  I kind of regret it, the
whole experience with the man.  Any way, how do you all think a single
solex performs?  How hard would it be to switch back to a single
solex?  What would be involved.  When he switched out the weber for
the solex, he also had to replace the intake manifold (I think that's
waht it is called).  I stupidly did not get anything back he took
off. Anyway, I am going to have a month off the end of June and am
trying to plan what kind of work I will do on the bus.  Thanks!

take care,
	brandy
