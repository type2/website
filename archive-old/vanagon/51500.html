Subject: Vanagon rear suspension


 A couple of weeks ago a list member posted questions about the
 Vanagon rear suspension.  The poster was experiencing excessive wear
 on the inside of the rear tires, and wondered:

      1) could worn springs affect the rear camber to such an extent
         to cause this wear, and
      2) was it possible for the shade tree mechanic to fix this
         condition with new springs?

 I only saw one reply posted which suggested getting some gas shocks
 for the rear.  The reply _suggests_ the answer to 1) is &quot;Yes&quot; and the
 answer to 2) is &quot;No&quot; (or &quot;it's too hard&quot;).

 Since I'm having the same rear tire wear problem I thought I post the
 questions once again.
