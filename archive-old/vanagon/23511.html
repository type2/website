Additionally for all of us so smuggly driving newer fuel injected vehicles - -
wipe that smile off our faces.  The same problems about aging hardening  and
then cracking  rubber fuel lines applies to us as well.  In addition, those
lines that feed the injectors are under pressure in the area of 20 =&gt; 30 psi!!
So if one of those hoses cracks, there will be an instant spray of gas.

Harvey
'82 Diesel Vanago which has METAL high pressure fuel lines and runs on diesel
fuel  that is so much less flamable than gas that a saucer of diesel won't
igniht if you drop a lit match in it. (But I also do drive a fuel injecteed
gasoline powered car)
