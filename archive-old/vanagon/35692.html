Subject: Re: '68 pickup,clutch,the problem


++Are all pressure plate/throwout bearing combinations interchangeable, i.e.
++could I use a type 4 pressure plate/throwout bearing set?

++I have put about 4000 miles on the truck since I got it.  It felt like it
++was all working fine - engine, clutch, transmission (except for the bungee
++cord 4th).  The engine is a dual port 1600, AK case.

The 68-70 transmission lacks a sleeve which sits around the trans. 
shaft which was included with the '71 and later transporters.  It is 
designed to accomodate the newer T/O bearing and splined pressure plate.

I had this exact setup (porsche-type plate, 1970 trans) and it worked for 
awhile, until my clutch cross shaft broke.  The (somewhat suspect) 
partsyard guy insisted that it would be OK.  

The old-style pressure plate (and matching T/O bearing, not the 
smoothe-faced one) will mount right up to the 1600 DP flywheel.
