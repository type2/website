Subject: Subaru notes, #3

And on it goes.....

forgot to mention a detail from KEP folks re their autobox Subaru
vanagon..   seems they have blown out (how?) two ATF/H2O heat
exchangers, the tin box on the front of the trans. They don't know why.
Awful mess, when coolant under pressure it goes into the autotrans, when
cooling off sucks ATF into coolant system. Double flush and bleed.  They
are not amused ;).

And furthermore.....

Checked out a Subaru 2.2L Legacy engine close up.  Modern engine, nice
massive cast aluminium intake runners, throttle body is highest thing on
the engine (right under a vanagon deck lid), 1 coil/spark plug, also as
high as possible.  This should run in water say 4-6&quot; deeper than the
vanagons wasser!! Good for Syncro Schwimmers. Very 'tight' compact
engine, no surplus water/FI piping etc. Vanagon wasser really looks old
tech!!

Sizes:  width 28&quot;, length 17&quot;, height above the centreline of the crank
13&quot;, height below centreline 11&quot; These are approximate to say 1/2&quot;. So
what... ?

well....  it won't fit under a 2WD vanagon deck lid, needs very little
however, like 1&quot;, and only 4&quot; diam. area over the throttle body inlet. 
Cutting away padding and forming the decklid with a heat gun would do
it. SOOL if you have a steel decklid.
It will fit nicely under a Syncro decklid though :) :)

Removing the VW airflap housing from existing filter box and replacing
with plate/collar will allow the VW air intake system to stay in place.
Need fat 'S' bend hosing to link up filter box to throttle body,
possibly the Subaru hose will do it!!!

Width and length are perfect match to fit in, Better fit since the
plumbing/FI crap doesn't hang off each side.  Don't know about alt/PS/AC
since all was off the engine. They mount high, one serpentine belt
pulley only. Also good for water protection.

And now the bad news.....  The vanagon oil 'pan' is only about 7&quot; below
the crank centre, Subaru has another 4&quot; to go, all oil pan!  This is
definately not Syncro compatible, and not my idea for any 2WD either. 
Ground clearance drops to say 4-5&quot; unloaded, 2-3&quot; maxed out.  Dangerous,
at least a gravel plate is needed, preferably a solid skid plate, and
not the existing Syncro one. Wah-hah!

Finally....  If anyone has seen KEPs conversion close up and checked
this out can you mail me your impressions.  The KEP mobile has been road
tested by one listee last year (it books!), can I get some more
firsthand info from someone.  
	And if anyone is within local phone distance can you call KEP and
discuss this problem with them? My bills are getting up there.  They
have never mentioned it to me, despite being well versed in other
idioSyncrosies of the conversion.  Best of all, can someone go photo
KEPs setup carefully, or suggest to them that they get it done
professionally, and get the photos scanned and up on a webpage. It's
long overdue.

	If anyone knows what it takes to dry sump an engine please mail me that
info too.  I need help, this is becoming a PITA.  Definately looks like
the right engine for a vanagon, despite all this, I waaaannt it!

bye folks/thanks, Tim
