&gt;&gt;Is this a good idea?  What grit paper #600 or #1000?

I make no claims to be an expert. 

I did have an experience with color sanding the black '57 Oval before I sold
it. =( I used 1000, 1500, and 2000 grit. Also used 3M products one of which
was a tannish fine grain rubbing/polishing compound that came in a squeeze
bottle similar to the old catsup/ketchup bottles. The other 3M product was a
micro fine finishing compound called &quot;finesse it.&quot; I know for certain that I
just butchered the real spelling. Use a block, TONS of water, get a small
blocking squeegee and check you progress constantly. I mean very constantly.
I was blessed with working on a black vehicle- so every minute scratch was
likely to show. I was amazed at how easy it was to get a scratch from the
teeniest bit of dirt, dust, heavy breathing, or even thinking about
scratches. The car turned out great and in my case was the difference
between a ragged looking original paint job and a beautiful looking black
oval with original paint. Be careful, work slow starting in an area that is
not critical and use plenty of water. In my experience 600, 800 would have
looked like I color sanded with a ring of car keys. Each application will be
different.

To remove orange peel, I have even heard of body persons using corn starch
as a rubbing agent coupled with a power polisher. (Really) I am not
recommending that this is what you should use. I watched an old neighbor of
mine (who is a pro painter for a F*rd dealer) rub out the Ghia 'vert that I
owned in the early 80's after a $300. paint job. *Ah, the good old days!*
The car's paint turned out like glass. Consult a professional for advice.
