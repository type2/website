&gt;Hey guys,
&gt;
&gt;It's that time of year again and I have to put my Bus up for the winter.  
&gt;Up here in Duluth, Mn. Snow flies at the end of Sept.- to mid Oct. until 
&gt;around May 1st. 
&gt;
&gt;With my previous buses I didn't do anything to them before I put them 
&gt;away, just took the tires off and propped it up.  
&gt;
&gt;This new 73 with a 77' motor and drive train might need something else.
&gt;
&gt;What do you do when you store a Bus for the winter?
&gt;
&gt;any info will be appreciated.
&gt;

Another approach worthy of consideration:

1.  Give the van a complete tune-up and compression test.
2.  Change the oil (with 20W-50W) and filter.
3.  Air up the tires (and the spare).
4.  Fill the gas tank.
5.  Grab your fins, mask, snorkel, swimming suit, inflatable boat, etc.
6.  Pack up the van with travelin' stuff.
7.  Quit your job or take a long sabbatical.
7.  Start the bus and head for the Caribbean or Pacific coast of Mexico
and/or Central America (or Baja).
8.  Head north about mid-April.
