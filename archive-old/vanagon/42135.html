&gt;Is there a Militia Movement on in Southern Kalifornia?

Not that I've heard. Looking for one? Check those Freemen idiots in
Montana-- you'll find what you want.


&gt;You're killing me up here in bastion of liberalism and truth...

...and the stone wall between the two.   :^)   Seen the column by Feder?
Are you seriously implying that all gummint offices serve useful purposes
and have no deadweight? Or that they do something other than restrict?
Sometimes that restriction is a good thing to do, as in the second
everyday example I gave, but it's still restriction. If they &quot;help&quot; one
person, they can do it only by taking from another, plus a little
more to pay their salaries-- the reason they shouldn't &quot;help&quot; in the
first place.

My point was to advise the original poster to check out that lost-title
bus carefully, and to suggest ways to avoid the runarounds I've gotten
in the past-- invariably from gummint offices. When I get them from
private companies, it's usually not hard to get to the root, or to go
to the competition, as others on this list have described doing also.
But gummint offices seem like bottomless quagmires sometimes. I wish it
weren't that way, but I see no mechanism available to change or avoid
the tendency-- that sic-'em technique, is only partial successful at
best. Hence my comments, based on sad experience, rather than an attempt
to inject extremism into a situation common to gummint offices everywhere.
