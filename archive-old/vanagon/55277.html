Subject: measuring current?
Date: Thu, 30 Jan 97 23:08:49 EST

Hey all,
OK, I have a question.  

I've been wondering this for a while, but how do I measure current with
my multimeter?  I've got your basic digital multimeter with two probes,
and a selection on the knob to measure DC amps up to 10 amps.

My question is where do I attach the test probes to determine current
draw?  

I've never been really clear on this so if someone could answer this
admittedly silly question, I'd appreciate it.

Thanks,
Sean
