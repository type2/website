Looks like I'll be putting in a new engine in my Vanagon camper. It ate the
lifter-left a nasty hole inside case in cylinder #1. Looking for a rebuilt
engine or good used engine. Need info on who to buy from. Want good solid
rebuild at reasonable cost and any and all info, rumors, praise, gripes about
various rebuilders and/or suggestions for a novice at this. Don't know if my
old case is re-useable. I live in the San Francisco Bay area (North).
Dealers I know of so far:

East German auto $1400 w/exchange (not too impressed telephone wise-seemed
they changed their $$ quotes significantly)
Hawthorne CA (+$250 shipping)

So Cal Imports Bellflower $1400 (+Shipping)

Vally Core Sacarmento       $1800w/exchange (I can pick up)
Thanks for any help.
