Subject:      88 Vanagon Leaks

My '88 Westy (~86k miles, '89 engine) just developed a bad leak from the left cylinder head.  On top of this, the engine has low oil pressure.  I've read the info on the Vanagon_dot_com webpage.  I'm looking for add'l advice.  Specifically:

Should I do both heads or just the leaky one?

Should I go for a rebuild (given the low oil pressure)?  If so, whose?

Should I use a independent mechanic or VW dealer?

Any recommendations on mechanix/dealers in the Seattle area?

Thanks,

Jon Van Wyk
'88 Westy
