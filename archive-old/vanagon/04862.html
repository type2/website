So Stuart Redford says:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Now, I KNEW that no mere mortal can read a water-cooled Vanagon oil
&gt; &gt; dipstick accurately unless he has let the vehicle sit overnight or 
&gt; &gt; has divine insight.
&gt; 
&gt; 	Huh? Why's that?

Because overnight is how long it takes for the ALL of the oil to drip
back into the sump.  This is the only way to tell how much oil is
in the engine minus the filter.  Besides, this way ya don't have to 
clean off the dipstick and put it back in to measure.  You just pull
it out in the morning and look at it.  Even the Car Talk guys agreed
that this is the best way to check your oil.  ;)  I've done this for
decades.

&gt; &gt; that these things didn't matter.  I decided the van needed oil.
&gt; &gt; And not one quart, after checking the dipstick again -- but two.
&gt; 	Your sin.......clean oil.
Agreed.
