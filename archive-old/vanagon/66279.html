Subject:      Binding when turning

my '89 westy syncro binds up really tight when its hot and i make a
sharp turn...like to turn around in a parking lot...the binding seems to
be more than what one would expect from the vc on a tight turn....its
almost like the brakes are on...the vehicle will not roll freely...and
it does not bind to this extent when not hot....

am i doomed?  will changing the fluid help?  hurt?  i appreciate any
response....to this most disturbing symptom...effect....whatever...
