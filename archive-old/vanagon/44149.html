Uh, isn't that the norm, to press the clutch pedal when you change gears with
the motor running?  I mean, that IS what the clutch pedal is for, right?  :-)

&gt;I losened the clutch
&gt;cable, till I had the most amount of &quot;allowable&quot; freeplay, but still
&gt;no dice.  I figure I'll go ahead and try putting the new clutch cable
&gt;in and use the other for a spare, but has anyone had this problem
&gt;before?  I'll swap out the clutch cables and play with adjusting it,
&gt;and let everyone know what's up.
I think if it were me, I'd put in the new cable, adjust free play to spec.
(about an inch?) and if it drove and shifted fine (WITH clutch :-) ) that
would be that.
