Subject: Westy Height



Into a typical garage (most owners' garages that I know of), it
will barely fit (with standard tires).  If you have one of those
little plexiglass domes protruding like a gunner's port, then you are
out of luck...

BTW, make sure your garage doors are adjusted.  My wife made a few quite
lasting impressions on our garaga door over the years....

&gt;   I've checked the usual sources, but couldn't find what the height of a
&gt;   Vanagon Westfalia is.  Does anyone know?  (I'm wondering if one would fit
&gt;   in my garage.)  Thanx!
