Subject:      FFriday: more short takes

just a few little selections of Songs My Mother Never Sang for Me:

Vanagon Gals (an old traditional favorite of the Wagen Trains, while
              travelling across the Great Prairies)

Vanagon gals, won't you come out tonight?
Come out tonight, come out tonight?
Vanagon gals, won't you come out tonight,
And dance by the light of the moon?


In My Vanagon (sung by Will-He Maelstrom)
              (inspired by little Ricky Golen) :)

In my Vanagon,
Just can't wait to get in my Vanagon,
My life is driving highways, and that's where I belong,
And I can 't wait to get in my Vanagon.


Sweet Westy from Pike (another traditional ditty of the Wagen Trains)

Oh, do you remember sweet Westy from Pike?
Who crossed the Rocky Mountains with her driver, Ike?
They struggled and climbed up those mountainous peaks
And came right back down and they had no oil leaks!


El Gringo (a perennial favorite, by Marty Poppins)

Out in the west Texas town of El Gringo,
I fell in love with Volkswagen machines,
Kombis and Pickups and Campers and Panels,
Buses of all sorts, that's just what I mean.


These Are A Few Of My Favorite Things (by Julius Andrews,
                                       alias Valve'sa Poppins)

CV joints greasy and new rubber booties,
Bright shiny bumpers for bus's patooties,
New wiper blades, and a windshield that's clean,
These are a few of my favorite things.
