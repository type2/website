Subject: Rear Bench Seat
Date: Thu, 10 Aug 95 14:59:42 PDT

Since we are on the subject of bench seats my '65 bus's
rear bench seat is in 2 pieces. The back cushion is detached
from the seating cushion. Seems to me they should be attached!
(My middle seat is in one piece)

Should the rear seat be one piece and, if so, how can I
attach these two separate cushions?

Thanks,
