&gt; In the near future, I will have to replace my aging Taurus as the family

&gt; They're :
&gt; a more modern design,
&gt; water cooled (read:   HEAT in the wintertime!)
&gt; come with BOTH air conditioning and the horsepower to drive it!)
&gt; criuse control
&gt; enough oats (with the V-6 models anyway) to deal with an automatic
&gt; (The lil' woman REFUSES to shift gears, end of discussion)
&gt; deal with Penna and W.V. hills at 65 mph.


So try to find an even more modern design.  I'll bet there are still 
Eurovans out there.  My MV comes with plenty of power to handle BOTH air 
conditioners (front and rear) - unfortunately it is automatic and does 
zoom up those PA and WV hills - i just passed through from VA to OH and back.

&gt; 
&gt; Now don't get me wrong, I love my lil diesel vanagon, BUT!
&gt; I want something else as well...
&gt; 
&gt; (like a set of pedals for hills!)     &lt;cackle&gt;
&gt; 

EVs don't need no silly pedals :)  (The Chrysler may be about the best 
minivan but who wants an overgrown station wagon anyway :)
