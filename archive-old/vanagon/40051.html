&gt;&gt; My advice to anyone with an older bus is to check the hinge *before* it
&gt;&gt; breaks, because it will be much easier to fix if it isn't already broken.
&gt;&gt; I am still trying to figure out the best way to do this, but it looks like
&gt;&gt; drilling it out and running a bolt through the hinge is my best option,
&gt;&gt; without actually removing the entire hinge.
&gt;
&gt;Any advice on the above procedure is most welcome.  I am about to need
&gt;the same on my '71.  I am thinking of using a stainless nut and bolt 
&gt;at least.

&gt;Before repainting my 71 bus I replaced both hing pins with stainless bolts 
that were JUST a bit larger than the originals (metric size) and put a nut 
with locktite on it...seems to work.
