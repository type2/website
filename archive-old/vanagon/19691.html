Subject: JC Whitney quality
Date: Mon, 26 Jun 1995 14:01:45 -0400 (EDT)


I saw this question a while back but don't remember any response about
the quality of JC Whitney parts, particularly in my case the heat
exchangers and shrouding.  They are so much cheaper, is there a
difference in quality for these non-precision items?

TIA,
Mitch
