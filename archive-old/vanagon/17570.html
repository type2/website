&gt; I'd be really interested to know if anyone has put a Bug engine into a 
&gt; '76-'79 Bus. Or alternatively, '76-'79 Westfalia camper components on a 
&gt; '68-'71  Bus.
&gt; 
&gt; I love my 2.0 liter, but It makes me uncomfortable in Mexico/CA. Any 
&gt; experiences ?
&gt; 
A '74 I bought for parts had a 1600 dp hanging off the tranny where
the 1700 Type 4 was supposed to be, no rear support, just hanging
there off the tranny, entire back end had been burnt up from the
origional Type 4 having an engine fire I guess.  I have no idea how the
clutch and connection was done, the tranny was hashed and had no 3,
and I could rock the tips of the valves back and forth about 1/8&quot; or
so and the guy wondered why it barely ran, no engine tin incidently,
just a bug tin attached to the engine, I bought it for $150 for its
windshield and pristine interior anyway and since the rest was solid
rust ripped off whatever I felt was OK but never separated the engine
and tranny.  However it was  hung on there, after substituting a set of
well worn (but not quite so worn) heads I did get her to run
approximately 40 miles I needed to get her home and back to a junkyard
after stripping all but the windshield.  I really don't figure this is
a reasonable conversion, fabricating engine tin and a rear mount
assuming you got a universal casee would be ridiculous to use an
underpowered stock 1600, and by the time you built a big Type 1 you
should have just rebuilt your Type 4.  However swappping the camper
pieces would be a joke, but the pop top should only be installed IMHO
if onto an origional sunroof '68-'71 due to the added structural
support.
