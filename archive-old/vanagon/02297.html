&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I'm a little nervous about this trip.  Maybe you could extract some names 
&gt; and cities of Van owners in my path.  St. Paul to Sioux City, IA, to the 
&gt; middle of Nebraska to Berthoud, CO (North of Boulder) back up to Cheyenne 
&gt; and over to Salt Lake City and north past Logan to Smithfield, UT.  Maybe 
&gt; I should post that request to the list and ask for repair kinds of people?
&gt; 


Gerry,

First, enjoy your trip even Nebraska can be beautiful! -- After all 
&quot;Beautiful Nebraska&quot; is our state song --  Seriously, in Lincoln there
are a few VW repair spots, but we've had our best luck with Olston's 
on 33rd street, which of course adjacent to the University! Farther 
West thing get a bit bleak -- good luck.


P.S. In central Iowa there used to be a great place for parts and such
in Zearing, IA  - Ron Blattel.  Zearing is rather small so anyone in 
town should be able to point you in the right direction.
