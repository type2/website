fwiw...
When the belly pipes on my '85 rusted through, I was on my way to NY the
next day to pick up a friend and didn't have time to figure out a cost
effective way to deal with it so I let the local dealership make my visa
bill big.
They replaced the steel pipes with what I assume is a polypropylene tube
(plastic tubing).  Apparently the '87s and newer never had steel pipes but
started out with the polypropylene.  I worried about the tubing getting torn
on rocks and parking lot blocks and the other things that pass under the
belly, but it's now a couple years later and they're still holding strong.
They aren't rusting at all.  ;P
