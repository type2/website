Here's tip for you vanagon people that like to check
your oil in the dark.

Usually when it's dark out in the morning I check the oil
by pulling the stick and holding it up to the light in the
garage.  When I go to put the stick back the back end of the
camper is too dark to see the tube in which the stick goes.
Normally I use a flashlight, but this morning I didn't have
one handy, so I turned on the parking lights which light
up the license plate lights and viola! I was could easily see 
the tube and put the dip stick back in with no problem.  So 
use those parking lights to your advantage.  And Martha,
make sure you get the right bulbs.  ;)

Cheers!

Steven
