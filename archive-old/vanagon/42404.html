&gt;I recently used a combination of stainless steel nuts, bolts &amp; washers and
&gt;anti-sieze compound when reassemblying my exhaust. Although won't be able to
&gt;see the fruits of this change for years, I'll bet that the next
&gt;dissassembly/reassembly will go much much easier.  I would recommend using
&gt;only stainless fasteners with anti-sieze for VW exhausts.

I believe in this also.  When using stainless hardware it is extremely
important to use anti-sieze.  If assembled dry, the threads will gall and
strip while being assembled. Never to be removed again.
