Subject: Fridge

When I had my fridge out of the van, I hooked it up to a propane tank and
fired it up to make certain that the servicing to the air pump, thermo
switch and other bits had been done correctly.  It worked.
So, I put it back in the van and guess what - It won't work.  Can't get it
to light up.  When it was on the bench test I didn't even think about
bleeding air out of the propane line, the fridge burner came on after about
five minutes trying.  In the van, I cracked the fitting until I could smell
the propane, tightened and checked the union, but it just will not light.
To make matters worse, I can't get netscape to run so can't access the
archives so would appreciate any suggestions.

BTW.  Query on replacing the hookup covers - I made new covers out of pieces
of scrap plastic.  One I screwed in place and the second I fitted in with
the wire that holds them in.  Because the little closure springs were
broken, I made the covers a teeny bit oversize so they would jam closed.  Am
willing to mail sketches if anyone is interested.

Heater cables:  I mentioned before that it is possible to buy this little
clamp unit which is fastened onto the end of the cable sheath with the cable
still in place.  One then squirts a lubricant through the fitting on the
clamp.  the lubricant is forced down the cable 'cause there's no where else
for it to go.

Cables can be replaced by pulling the old one out of the sheath and
replacing it with a piece of piano wire from a model airplane shop.  Don't
bend the wire too sharply, it breaks.
