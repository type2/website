I've got a diesel van.  It's a 96 model Transporter T4 2.4D.  It was built
in 95 (these things sit around in the yard for a LLOOOOONG time before
they get sold.) This is the 5 cyl engine that is offered here in
Australia.  I'm very happy with it so far and it compliments my other car,
a 81 Passat GLD diesel.
BFN
Reece.
