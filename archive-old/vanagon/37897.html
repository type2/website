  OFFICE MEMO          Re&gt;EV Camper                           Date:3/19/96

Megan &quot;the sniveling lurker&quot; : ) said:
the V-4 seemed OK. (Though rumor has it that a V-6 is in the offing for later
this year.)

I say:
Are you sure it is only a 4 cylinder? I thought all the EV's were 5 cylinder.
I have an MV, sort of a pretend camper, somewhat lacking the bells and
whistles of the real thing. I know there was an earlier post where someone
had trouble getting heat to the rear of their camper (no vents?).
Other than that it is a really cool vehicle (pardon the pun). Easy to drive,
fair amount of power, well thought out and plenty O' room. I really can't see
how the 6 cylinder would improve things much, maybe more low end torque. They
seem geared so low that unless they make some major changes to the tranny it
will still labor out of the &quot;comfort zone&quot; above 80 MPH.
Now, the guy who really could give you the story is Rob....
He has been blessed with the EV from hell.
Any input Rob??  ; )
