&gt; &gt;Hi All!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Well, as the subject line says, I plunked down the holding
&gt; &gt;deposit and will be picking up the '64 beauty this weekend.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; Steve,
&gt; Congratulations!!!  When I drive the bus, I get a big smile.  But when I 
&gt; drive Opie, the '68 crew cab pickup, it's even bigger.  Should be lots of 
&gt; fun for you also.
&gt; 
&gt; All of the stuff you talk about having to do makes me think that the 
&gt; condition of your pickup is about the same as Opie - rust &amp; stuff.  I've 
&gt; written Thom about some questions and suggested we video some of this work 
&gt; for each other's learning and the list.  What do you think?  I really don't 
&gt; know how to do this stuff.

Alright!  That's a great idea.  The only hard part is getting hold of a
video camera.  I'll try to borrow one and maybe it won't be a great
production, but at least it'll get the point across.  My impression,
so far, is you need lot's of practice to get good at this stuff.

Ya know, I've seen your posts many times, but you don't always converse
with everyone on the list and I may even have discussed some things with
you already.  I think it's great (for me at least) that buying this 
single automatically gives me another group of brothers/sisters to share
info. with.  What a great fringe benefit, eh?  :)

I'll see what Thom and I can do, in the meantime, don't hesitate to check
out other sources for info.  I'm the the Rustoration FAQ will go a long
way in helping.  Shoot! I have to read that thing myself.  ;)

Cheers!

Steven
