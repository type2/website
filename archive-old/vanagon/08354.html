Subject: Re: towing the vanagon

&gt;
&gt;	I don't know about Vanagon rear wheel bearings, but
&gt;you can count on trashing front-wheel drive VW bearings if you
&gt;roll the car even a short distance without the outer axle stub
&gt;in place- the bearing shell can't take the mechanical strain.
&gt;	So I'd be a little suspicious of removing the rear axles
&gt;from a van and then towing it   &lt;slice&gt;


Rear end bus shafts can be removed, since the stub axles remain in position, 
but the front axles on a Synchro will suffer from the above problem. You can 
disconnect at the differential end and hang them in thick 1&quot; hemp rope 
slathered in grease. Don't use poly rope!!!  I've had to do this for a 180 
mile tow of a salvaged Citroen chassis/pan. No fun stopping to check every 
hour or so.  tim s.
