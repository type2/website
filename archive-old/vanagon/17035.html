Subject: Re: how do I tow a bus?!?

&gt;Rent a uhaul truck plus tow dolly. I rented onw way for two hundred miles and
&gt;it cost $150. Disconnect joints from wheels or make sure it won't come out of
&gt;neutral.

Yes, this is the way to go, especially if you handle can tow the weight of 
dolly and van with your own vehicle,  but...

Back the bus onto the dolly. Puts the heavy end under better control, less 
of a pendulum, and you don't need to do anything. If you don't have a 
steering lock tie the wheel still. Blowing a front bus tire isn't so painful 
or likely either. 
Done this for 900 miles with a 1700lb Porsche behind a Vanagon. tim s.
