 VW Bus parts, mostly 71-72
     ---------------
 Parted out 71 and 72 Westfalia. Have about everything including doors,
 windows, Exterior trim and bumpers, front and rear axles, suspension,
 engines, transmisions, 1 complete Westfalia interior, wheels, pop top and
 luggage rack, Brakes, etc. When I say I stripped them, I mean it! Parts
 are in Brooklyn and I must get rid of them due to moving. All engines are
 1700cc type 4 and need rebuilt. Also have some other VW air cooled parts
 to offer. Send detailed want list for prices and availability. The more
 you buy, the cheaper things will be!
