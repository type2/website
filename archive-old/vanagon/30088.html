Subject: Re: Argh! My transmission went kaput!



&gt; the synchronizer is $247 from Volkswagen! I've found it for  $225 at a 
&gt; German distributor that typically has excellent prices.

Look at both parts that are available.  It is my understanding that 
VW has made the replacement part 'better' (surprise!) by changing the 
design of the part.  They have taken the 'notch' design - the area 
where the part breaks due to the stress at the point - and changed it 
to a more rounded type notch.  (Sorry for the vague terms but if you 
have the trans apart you will see what I mean.)  Try to buy the one 
that has the more rounded notch design - the idea being the part is 
less prone to break from stress.

 
&gt; At this price I do not 
&gt; want to replace the 1st/2nd for preventative maintenance. Has anyone ever 
&gt; had their 1st/2nd break?

When I was in my state of denial that my trans was hooped I visited 
several mechanics.  Most had broken 3-4 operators to show me, but 
only one had a broken 1-2 operator.  This doesn't tell me too much, 
however.  I myself only replaced the 3-4 operator, and that was 10,000 
miles ago.  Everything is still going fine thus far.  As for the 
synchros, for sure replace them - it's a worthy investment.
