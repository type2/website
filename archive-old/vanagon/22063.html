Great story David I glad it had a good ending.  Here's one back to you.

I found myself in that situation twice.  The first time the accelerator cable
broke it was near the pedal.  There I am in downtown Chico, underneath
looking at the two ends dangling in the wind.  I look towards the curb and
see a piece of plastic twine.  I bent the ends of the cable and tied it
together.  Ran for about 6 months before I replaced it.
The second time I was on a mountain road nowhere to nowhere.  The cable broke
at the carb.  I looked around and found a beer pop top, bent the cable and
hooked it with the pop top to the carb.  Ran it for a couple of weeks.  I
guess I haven't learned,  I still don't have a spare but I do know how to
recycle.

Happy Trails,
John
