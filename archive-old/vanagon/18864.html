Subject: Re: [?]/Strange American VWVan Look-alike

&gt;back in the 60's, when GM decided to try to copy VW with the Corvair, they
&gt;did make a van version ... and even a pickup version. called the Briarwood
&gt;(i think that's correct), it was indeed a flat-faced (with a somewhat silly
&gt;&quot;face&quot; on the car. imho) van with the air-cooled engine in the rear.

I was checking was of these out at a local swap meet, a pickup with the
one side folding down to make a ramp to carry stuff up into the bed.
pretty neat!
