&gt;
&gt; (much LiMBO and NEATO useful stuff deleted)
&gt; 
I noticed that both contacts for LiMBO and NEATO are in MA (where I am, 
incidentally).  Having a family who does not share my devotion to VW's
but is willing to humor me for short periods of time, I ask if anyone
knows of similar gatherings of Type II's (in New England, specifically,
but others would be of interest to other netters).  The rest of my clan 
really wouldn't tolerate the haul to St. Louis, although they may enjoy
a day trip.

Peace.
