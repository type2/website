Subject: 1995 EV Camper Insurance, Auto or RV


I am considering the purchase of a 1995 Eurovan camper. 
When I called my insurance agent (Allstate) he quoted my
a rate from his auto insurance price list under Eurovan GL. 

Apparently Allstate has different policies for autos vs. RVs. 
Although not apples to apples a rate he quoted me for a (non-Eurovan)
RV was significantly less. The way he put it is that RV
insurance is lower because they don't expect you to use your
RV nearly as often. 

I'd be interested in knowing if other EV Camper owners are 
insuring their vehicles as RVs or autos?
