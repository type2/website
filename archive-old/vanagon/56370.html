After seeing several references onlist, thot I'd send along this excerpt
from the latest email installment of Yahoo!'s Picks of the Week, found at:
yahoo-picks-request_at_yahoo_dot_com

Speaking of long strange trips, the runner-up YAWN for &quot;Interplanetary
Evangelism&quot; goes to DeadRadio_dot_com, where it's noted that &quot;the music
never stops.&quot; DeadRadio broadcasts music of the Grateful Dead
twenty-four hours a day in RealAudio 3.0. And as if that weren't
enough, beginning in March, the site will broadcast every Thursday
night tapes from a Dead show in its entirety. They're working on a
collection of related cool links. In the meantime, enjoy the
tunes. And remember, in order to hear the music you'll need a couple
things: a Pentium PC or PowerMac equivalent, a sound card, RealAudio
3.0, kind veggie burritos and a mean mix of falafel. Patchouli
optional.
