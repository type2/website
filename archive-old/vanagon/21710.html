Sorry to rain on your parade but the Extend rust eliminator will not stand 
the heat.  I tried it on the heater control valves and even that minor amount 
of heat made the stuff peel off completely.  The best stuff that I've found is 
standard high temperature engine manifold paint. Just go by the temp rating.  
I also use it on heater boxes and pipes whenever I have them out since there 
is a certain amount of erosion and these parts are getting very hard to find.

&gt; Sorry about the gripe letter before. had to get it off of my chest.
&gt; UPS can find me now! At last! And my second heat exchanger arrived
&gt; this morning. 2 pretty gray ones from Denmark. The cooling shrouds
&gt; went on the new engine a-ok last night. Sure looks spiffy! All the 
&gt; shrouds were scrubbed up, coated with Extend rust eliminator, and
&gt; have a base coat of BBQ black, and 3 coats of engine black paint.
&gt; Gosh this engine looks nice. Hope we can get it all in tommorow.
&gt; Dropping it took about 3 hrs. Hopefully the reverse will go very
&gt; smoothly. Looks like it will be running on Saturday or Sunday.
&gt; Will keep you posted!
