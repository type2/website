&gt; While in the process of installing an in-line blower in my 1972 Pop-Top, I

&gt; than I expected.  Any thought on fixing this?  

 Economical and effective solution: - ABS pipe (plumbing store) Can't 
remember the size...
                                    - Hot water pipe insulation wrap (also 
plumbing store)
                                    - Two part epoxy glue (hardware)
