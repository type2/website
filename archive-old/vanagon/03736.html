Subject:      first sighting: winnebago rialta (eurovan camper)

well, folks ... i guess that guy in mississippi now has only TWO of those
beasts left! i just saw one today on the way home. a genuine vw-winnebago.

and it is rather large! makes a westfalia camper looking kinda tiny. ;)
but i didn't get a really good look as it was going the other direction.
maybe i'll zip over there and take a peek over the weekend.
