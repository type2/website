RE:	Copy of: 85 Westy For Sale

&gt;This bus has an extra seat so can seat 6, plus an additional extra single
&gt;seat, so can be used to seat 5 and still acces refrigerator.  It also has
&gt;the childs bed which goes across the front seats.

I'm confused.  Do you mean you took a middle seat out of a 7 pass van, and
bolted it to the floor?  So I guess it fits in there, but you just can't open
the fridge up?

Regarding the single seat - is that one of those removeable jumpseats that fits
behind the front pass. seat out of like a wolfsburg van or something? Wouldn't
it be a grey velour?

the childs bed across the front seats - did you add this out of a '70's westy??
I've never heard of a Vanagon westy w/ a childs cot.

interesting custom options.
good ideas though!
