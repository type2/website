Subject: HELP - Front end noise 

        It was suggested that the reoccuring yet unpatterned squeek that I
have up at the front end of my '83 may have somehting to do with my
suspension bushings or my wheel bearings. I must solve this little problem
pronto as I leave in 2 weeks, and  I think its reaking havoc with Mr.Fuel
Mileage.
        Suspension Bushings: They look awfully hard to get at according to
the Bentley diagrams, are any special tools needed. Also, on page 40.5a of
the Bentley there is a thing on Checking Upper Control Arm Bushings, and I
was wondering wether or not this would be worth checking. Would it be
related to my problem at all?

        Wheel Bearings: I havent a clue what to really look for here folks,
so I was wondering if I should check the outer wheel bearing or the inner
one? And even if Im able to get at either one what should I look for in
terms of wear and fault? It also looks like, according to the Bentely
manual figures, that I may need some special tools to get at the bearings.
        Am I even close on this having anything to do with the mileage and
noise??

        Thanks everyone. Work is going full tilt right now, and will right
up until I leave for holidays so I unfortunately dont have time to check
all sorts of options. AAAArgh its very frustrating.
