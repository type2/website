&gt;unfamiliar with vanagons/VW),

Familiarity with Vanagons is important to me.  I would be just (maybe more)
as concerned with the mechanic's experience with Vanagons as I would be about
the part itself.  Many shops wouldn't even know how to refill the Vanagon's
coolant!

&gt;So, fellow vanagoneers, what's been your experience with the various
&gt;brands of (new/rebuilt) water pumps?  Any suggestions for brands to look
&gt;for - or look *out* for?  

I've had 2 water pumps (1 on each Vanagon) replaced.  Each time by a VW
dealer.  I didn't inquire about their use of rebuilt or new, but both hav
many miles (like 30-50K) on them now, and I haven't had a problem.
