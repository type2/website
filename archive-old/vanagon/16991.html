&gt;So, if you want to do good by your van.  Don't be hoisting your-

&gt;the price.  Will you?

which is why i added another pull-up handle on the driver's side (like is
already on the passenger's side, on the A-pillar/windshield frame/door-jam).
it's not THAT difficult, but you MUST BE CAREFUL when drilling the holes ...
there is a BIG bundle of wires inside that pillar!!! and splicing them
back together is NOT fun. i've got some instructions for those who would
like to try it.
