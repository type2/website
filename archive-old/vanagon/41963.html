OK, I agree with all you guys, I can save money, and get a tan at the 
same time, and not risk anything breaking...I'll put in the effort and 
wash my bus myself.  I guess I just wantedto get out of it the easy way.

&gt; Paint is usually a permanent kind of thing.  Once it's on there, it's
&gt; going to stay.  You may have to pay a little extra in prep work when you
&gt; have it professionally painted.  Someone has to sand all that paint off.
&gt; Choose a durable exterior latex type paint and follow the directions.
&gt; Be prepared to paint the entire bus 3 times - primer, coat#1 and coat#2.
&gt; Match up the color.  Not exactly, but don't expect to cover a red bus with
&gt; green paint and have it look nice in a couple years.  Remove all the trim
&gt; that you can before you paint.

My dad and I are planning to sand it down this summer anyways, and have 
the color changed from dirt brown, to sky blue;), or something like that, 
we haven't decided exactly on the new color, anyways, before that, my 
friends and I wanted to paint it(only the bottom half, and leave the top 
white), but paint creatively, not to look professional, but artistic 
instead, so if the brown paint is going to be sanded off anyways, and for 
our own painting jobs, we don't care about how many brush strokes can be 
seen, is the only thing I'm giving up is the money inorder to buy the 
paint, which my friends have helped and chipped into the paint Dallas' 
bus fund?  Don't worry, Im not going to do this without thinking it over, 
ALOT and anyways, if I do decide to do it, I still have to get Dad's 
permission, thanks for the replies everyone...Dallas
