Subject: water repellant for canvas


Saw this in the June 1995 issue of Camping &amp; RV magazine, and thought
it might be of interest to some of you.  The usual disclaimer applies.

Switch to Aqualon (R) Keeps Campers Dry

If it seems like your canvas tent camper doesn't repel rain very
well, you may be right!

Traditionally canvas has been treated with a fire retardant and water
repellent.  In the past both of these treatments worked welrepellent tended to deteriorate with use.

More recently the chemicals used to treat the canvas were modified in
order to make them more environmentally friendly.  The net result is that
the canvas is not as water repellent as it was in the past.

The switch to Aqualon has solved that problem.  Aqualon is a 2 ply textured polyester duck fabric, coated with a PVC resin.  Unlike laminated vinyl,
Aqualon won't separate, crack or peel.

Aqualon has been used by the marine industry for boat tops and covers
for many years.  It has proven to be durable, stretch and shrink
resistant, color fast, stain resistant and water repellent.

During hydrostatic testing Aqualon 302 had no leakage at up to
85cm of water.  In comparison a competitive tent assembly replacement began
leaking at 38cm.

Aqualon is manufactured by the Graniteville Company, Graniteville, SC.
It carries a 5 year warranty against material defects and workmanship.  It
is exclusive in the RV industry to Starcraft Recreational Vehicles.
