Subject:      S&amp;S headers (part two)

Hi all, I just wanted to point out to those of you who looked at the photo
of the S&amp;S headers at http://members.aol_dot_com/rubatoguy/vanmods.htm, that
the header is actually 3 pieces. If you look very carefully at the rear
header pipes you can see they are two-piece and have a press fit into the
main header section.  So it is easier to install that you might have
thought if you believed it was a one piece header.

Also, I wanted to let everyone know that I have had superb response for S&amp;S
about my query that the muffler does not seem to fit. Though I've been out
of the office and have not yet been alble to call them back, S&amp;S has
emailed and called me to help out.

They seem like a company that really believes in customer service - so I
wanted to pass the word on. I will post the resolution tomorrow.
