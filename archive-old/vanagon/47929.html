Subject: Speed racer vw ad

Has anyone else seen the new Speed Racer spot that's running? Its quite 
good.  it shows Speed and his chums poking about a smoking Mach-1 which 
has been sabotaged.   A mysterious man steps forward giving Speed a set 
of keys to a new GTI.  Speed of course wins the race with all his buddies 
in the car with him, all the while singing the praises of the GTI.
Sorry no bus content...
