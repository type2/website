How about sharing your fridge secrets with the rest uf us!! :)

I'm still having a tough time getting mine to light (having tried everything
except dousing the whole thing in gasoline!!)

PS I've been meaning to say this... isn't the 'net unbelievable! Such a
valuable conduit for info exchange.. thanks to all who keep this particular
base interesting &amp; relevant!!

&gt; My new/old 88 westy has a 12 litre or 3 gallon lp gas bottle...  I know 
that
&gt; this question will depend on it use but how long, with reasonable  use,
can I
&gt; expect my 12 litre supply to last.  I will be using the fridge  on propane
. 
&gt; The fridge... another story!  What a drag getting that thing  to light.  I
was
&gt; getting blisters fropm pumping that &quot;a&quot; dial.  Make a  long story short, I
read
&gt; some postings on the list and tried them out...  the thing now works like
a
&gt; charm.  Gotta love the list!
