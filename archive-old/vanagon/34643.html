&gt;Then of course, there's the LAST bolt, the one that's rounded so badly I
&gt;can't get a grip on it with the allen wrench for love or money, the one
&gt;that's soaked to death with WD40 and Liquid Wrench and still won't budge...
.....
&gt;Driving a Dodge Omni automatic is the pits. I want my bus back!!  So tell me
&gt;all your big bad bolt-removal stories.. looks like I'll have a couple of
&gt;rainy days to ponder the situation  :)

Here's my tale of the one bolt that wouldn't come out after rounding. Even
Mole grips couldn't get a grip on it so I had to hacksaw the head off it. It
wasn't much fun in such a confined space but it eventually succumbed before
my arms did. The CV joint then came off over the bolt with a little
persuasion and, as in your case, once the pressure on it was released I
could turn the bolt out with my fingers.
