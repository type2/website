&gt; Hi all,
&gt; 
&gt; Here's my vote for March: Death Valley. It is so beautiful, and not to 
&gt; hot until April. Much to see and do and, or course, photograph. The bad 
&gt; news: it's a long way from the bay area. I'm not sure just how long it 
&gt; would take.

Death Valley is beautiful during that time of the year, however, the only 
reasonable campground with at least some vegetation, and decent restrooms 
- no showers! - is Furnace Creek, which fills up very quickly, and has to 
be reserved well in advance. All other campgrounds in the Valley are huge 
gravel parking lots with barely any facilities!

Driving from Sacramento (Route HW 50 over the Sierra to HW 395, then down 
south) usually takes 10 - 12 hours (with a lunch break at Mono Lake)!

I think the Valley is worth a visit, but I would rather like to have 2 or 
3 days to spend there....
