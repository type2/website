Subject: SHOCKS FOR LOWERED BUS

BACK IN 1990 WHEN I WAS YOUNGER AND MORE FOOLISH I LOWERED MY
64 DELUXE SUNROOF BUS. I UNDERSTAND THAT BUS BOYS(YOU KNOW, THE
PARTS GUYS YOU CAN NEVER GET) HAS AN UPDATED SHOCK FOR THEIR LOWERED FRONT
END, I HAVE TRIED TO ORDER THESE TO NO AVAIL. HAS ANYONE HAD ANY EXPERIENCE
WITH A LOWERED BUS WHAT IS THE BEST FRONT SHOCK TO USE. CAN I USE A STOCK
SHOCK IF THE BEAM IS ONLY TURNED ABOUT HALF WAY DOWN? ANY HELP WOULD BE
GREATLY APPRECIATED.                                              GERALD
