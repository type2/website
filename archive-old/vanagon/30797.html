Subject:      Road Test: 1991 VW SA 2,5i Caravelle

you engine transplanters might want to read this carefully ... it tells
a little more about the problem of a big tilted engine in a bus!

VW Caravelle 2,5i
CAR, May 1991

Now fitted with a superb motor, it earns its place at the top of the
minibus market, despite a five-speed gearshift with agricultural
character ...

When we road tested the then recently introduced VW Caravelle, back in
August 1987, we rated it tops in looks, handling and comfort. &quot;If it
had air-conditioning it would be a long distance cruiser par excellence&quot;
we commented, &quot;but ... something needs to be done about that gearshift&quot;.

By the time we assessed another 2,1-litre Caravelle, this time in Syncro
4x4 form for December 1989 CAR, it had gained a powerful and
sophisticated roof-mounted air-con system and today, the new 2,5-litre
100 kW vehicle lords it over the local minibus market, as this test will
show. Along with improved styling and enhanced comfort, it has gained a
more muscular five-cylinder engine which has contributed 22 per cent
more power and 15 per cent more torque.

This is the first locally built ten-seater to offer such lively
acceleration, along with zesty throttle response and a top speed of
159 km/h - 8 km/h fleeter than its predecessor and very close to the
magic imperial &quot;ton&quot;. But unless he opts for the automatic drivetrain
or the Syncro (which retains the 2,1-litre flat-four at this stage),
the Caravelle owner must still make do with a five-speed gearshift with
&quot;agricultural&quot; characteristics (see comment later in this report).
Four years on, the transmission problem remains unsolved.

Although, as we shall see, there are a few residual flaws in the
Caravelle's luxury package, they are all minor and easy to rectify apart
from the gearshift, which we rate as a serious shortcoming, at this
price level. The vehicle's R79420 tag makes it R18000 dearer than the
similarly-powered Microbus, for example, and R18845 more expensive than
its nearest true competitor - the R60575 Toyota Hi-Ace GLX Executive.

That's a lot of money for a ten-seater bus, but then the market for
up-market versions of VWSA's profit-spinning flagship has always been
strong and is likely to remain so in its improved form, unless stiff
competition appears. Toyota owners, of course, would hope to see that
provided by the sleek 2,5-litre 99 kW Previa - the MPV (multi-purpose
vehicle) we tested for our March issue - but Toyota SA has stoutly
denied that it might be in the pipeline for this market.

MPV DESIGN STRIDES
That Previa test highlighted the tremendous strides made in MPV design
in Europe, the US and Japan in recent years. But for the foreseeable
future, at least, the locally revamped Caravelle will remain firm
&quot;top dog&quot; in South Africa.

In fact, some buyers dislike swoopy styling like the Previa's,
preferring the blunt, conservatively boxy lines of VW's current minibus.
But it must be remembered that VW, Germany last year unveiled its
successor - a much more stylish, all-new people carrier designed to
compete with MPVs like the Previa and the Renault Espace.

Replacing the Transporter range in Europe, that vehicle is powered by a
transverse five-cylinder motor driving the front wheels. As it would
have cost R150 million to introduce it here, VWSA chose instead to
re-engineer and facelift the existing vehicle, (as explained in our
January news feature), deriving their 2,5-litre motor from a research
project begun in 1980 and then shelved.

While Project 1020 (to re-engine and restyle the Microbus/Caravelle)
has underlined the depth and refinement of the production engineering
facilities now available in this country, it also highlights the
technology gap that increasingly separates some South African product
ranges from overseas developments. Pressured by the Local Content
Programme, South African motor companies are tending to extend the life
of existing model ranges and in addition to the VW buses, the trend is
evident in products like the Toyota Cressidas, the Opel Rekords and the
Mazda 626s.

The Caravelle's new high torque, long stroke five-cylinder motor has
been ideally tailored to its role in an extensive development project
carried out at the Uitenhage factory with assistance from Wolfsburg.
Based on the fuel-injected Audi five-cylinder unit of 2,2 litres, it
was given a larger bore and a longer stroke, along with a modified
injection system and a new camshaft timed for low-to mid-range torque.

Installed on its side at an angle close to horizontal, it made it
necessary to raise the height of the engine compartment by 100 mm,
which reduced the size of the luggage space by a small amount. As the
effective roofline has been lowered a little at this point by the
overhead air-conditioning installation, the vehicle's luggage space has
decreased by 24 cubic dm, from 736 (the same figure as the Toyota
Hi-Ace) to 712 cubic dm.

ZESTY THROTTLE RESPONSE
Along with increased fuel consumption, up by 13,4 per cent, this is one
of two items on the debit side of the equation but neither will concern
the average Caravelle buyer, in view of the major benefits this test
reveals. These include remarkably zesty throttle response, overtaking
and cruising performance and the additional transmission stress that the
bigger motor entails has been allowed for in a larger clutch and uprated
cv joints.

The comprehensive revamp deepened side windows by 55mm and included
modified side panels to achieve a more rounded look, along with striking
new alloy wheels, a revised grille and bumper treatment. In the interior,
the elimination of painted surfaces has created a softer, plusher look,
enhanced by an imported steering wheel and an all-new facia.

This provides an improved cubby, storage recesses and full
instrumentation and involves a switch from slide to rotary controls for
setting temperature, fan and air distribution. Access and seating
comfort have been improved by a locally developed folding &quot;jump seat&quot;
which converts to a useful table when not in use, or can be removed
altogether. Though few Caravelle owners are likely to sleep in their
vehicles, the facility has been made much more attractive by the fact
that when the rear seat is folded flat to form a double bed, it now
levels off with the raised and thickly padded engine compartment floor.

The Caravelle spec includes power steering and front windows, central
locking linked to an integrated alarm/immobiliser system, twin halogen
headlights, striking new alloy wheels shod with 205/70 rubber, the
air-con (which now features overhead controls), electrically operated
and heated door mirrors, colour matched bumpers and a four-speaker sound
system. On our light blue test vehicle, only the metallic paint was an
optional extra, raising the price by R400.

A major charm of the Caravelle is the rigidity and solidity of its
structure and although the overall mass has risen to 1720 kg in its
latest form, ready-for testing, compared to 1580 for its 2,1-litre
predecessor, this is still 40 kg inside the mass of the Toyota Previa
(for example). While this contributes to the excellent ride quality by
making unsprung mass relatively small, in relation to the total, it
requires firm control in the suspension department and here the VW
engineers have done a superb job and given this bulky and heavy vehicle
first class dynamic characteristics.

Ergonomics are generally good, too, with supportive and substantial
seats offering a commanding view, a well designed dashboard and buttons
for the front windows placed conveniently to hand on the door panels.
Though interior lighting remains rather weak, limited to three tiny
units, the new steering wheel is perfectly proportioned and the
handbrake is far superior to the under-dash controls used in some
minibuses.

TOO FAR FORWARD
The snags arise in the gearshift, whose problems are compounded by its
location too far forward, up against the foot of the facia, and the
interior rear-view mirror, which is mounted too high to provide an
extended range, for a driver of average height.  The problem here is
that the rear-mounted air-con features a significant bulge at the rear,
where it sucks in air through a central duct, and this limits the range
of the mirror, which requires a longer mounting bracket. As a result,
you have to rely on the side mirrors for a long range view.

The five-cylinder motor is easily the best in any locally-built ten-
seater, running smoothly and quietly from a cold start and producing
a surging flow of power across a wide speed band, on demand. Applying
its torque through a smooth and cushioned clutch, it wafts the vehicle
away from rest with disdainful ease and responds to sudden throttle
demand, as for overtaking, with immediate enthusiasm. Although it is at
its best in mid-range, it will rev happily, to the 6250 r/min caution
zone, when required.

As the steering is accurate and sensitive, offering easy low speed
action and exceptional control as speed rises, the driver's confidence
builds rapidly. As you swing past slower traffic and explore the handling
and road-holding on the open road, you find the Caravelle just asks to
be driven with a verve that you'd normally reserve for a smaller
vehicle; and if you should misjudge your line and make a guilty
adjustment in mid-corner, you'll find it responds like a thoroughbred,
with minimal speed wobbles or oscillation.

Even under full-throttle demand to rush past a couple of slow-moving
vehicles with unlikely ease, for a minibus, the Caravelle remains quiet
and relaxed. Indeed, its cruise mode has much in common with a
jetliner's: just a rustling whirr from the propulsion system and a muted
hiss from the overhead air-con trunking.

The wide, flat torque curve provides satisfying range in the intermediate
gears but exposes a disappointing &quot;gap&quot; between the too-short third and
fourth, although the problem is masked to some extent by the tractability
of the motor, which makes fourth usable from well inside the 60 limit
right up to 150 km/h.

INSTANT CRUISE POWER
This nearly all-conquering ratio offers instant, zooming cruise power
whenever a major gradient looms on the open road and the gap between it
and third becomes obtrusive only when you're accelerating hard through
the gears. Having taken third gear up to red line, which is worth only
104 km/h, you drop almost 2000 revs as the lever finds fourth. While
there's ample torque at 4300, we believe a longer third ratio offering
a wider speed range would suit the Caravelle better.

The peace was disturbed just a little, on the test vehcile, by a tinny
vibe that arose at intervals in the left-hand facia, particularly when
decelerating through the lower gears. Such intermittent faults can be
difficult to run to ground because they tend to surface only in the
hands of the customer, and this bus had another one of them - a tendency
for the screenwipers to go on the blink, leaving only one speed
available and parking whenever they had a mind to.

The gearshift, the worst in current South African production, represents
an unfortunate handicap in a luxury vehicle of such outstanding dynamic
qualities. Although the gate is unusual, (with reverse to the left and
forward, first to the left and back, second and third in the middle
&quot;throw&quot; and fourth and fifth across on the right) this is not the
problem. As with a similar layout used on some BMWs, that pattern is
easy to learn and offers definite gains &quot;at the top end&quot;.

In the Caravelle, you have to grope to secure heavy, clonky gearchanges
with forward section of the gate at the limit of your reach and little
or no feel or assistance from the spring-loading. If you don't push the
stick far enough forward you can easily miss the &quot;cross&quot;, in which case
no amount of sideways pressure will work your case: you'll end up in
third instead of first, though the super-tractable motor will still let
you pull off unobtrusively. Similarly, it's all too easy to get fourth
instead of second, when you're groping for a lower cog in traffic, and
although you learn to &quot;drive around&quot; the gearshift, in time, that's not
an acceptable answer.

The abundance of husky torque, excellent brakes and fat-free handling
makes the 2,5-litre Caravelle and attractive proposition for towing
caravans and trailers of various kinds and if VW can improve the
gearshift - a vital component of a sound tow vehicle - its sales to this
market would be limited only by its price. But there is one other
improvement that is long overdue in VW's current minibus, the need for
adequate security of the spare wheel which is located in an under-floor
tray.

As many Microbus/Caravelle owners know to their cost, this tray requires
only a wheel spanner to release, applied beneath the front bumper. And
when we checked, two-thirds through the test, to see whether the test
vehicle had a fifth alloy wheel, a steel one or perhaps some form of
space-saver, we found the tray empty.

In fact, it was hanging loose by its safety clip (which accounted for a
light front-end rattle audible only with the window down) and even the
fastening bolt was missing. VW confirmed that the vehicle had been fitted
with a spare when delivered (something that some VW dealers make a point
of demonstrating to customers) but there had been few opportunities for
theft during the test. Although an accessory lock is available, it does
not offer a complete answer and a designed-in solution is needed, along
with the 2,5-liter power, in this high risk market.

LUXURY PERFORMER
As our test figures show, the seven/ten-seater, five-speed Caravelle
2,5i excels as a luxury people-mover with exceptional performance. It
will cruise effortlessly at the 120 speed limit and negotiate traffic
with unusual agility, for a vehicle of this type. Despite the mass
increase, it sprints from 0 to 100 km/h in 14,4 seconds - nearly two
seconds faster than its predessor - and, more importantly, is 2,3
seconds faster from 100 to 120 in top and 8 km/h faster in top speed.

The South African-built, specifically profiled power unit is superb in
its rear-mounted role, providing power and refinement equal to the
16-valve, purpose-built unit used under-floor in Toyota's Previa,
while providing much easier access for routine maintenance. Although the
increase in capacity involves a rise in fuel consumption, which now
ranges between 8,33 l/100km at 60 km/h to 14,16 at 120, this is well
inside the minibus ball park and in view of the lively performance of
this heavy ten-seater, is quite creditable.

TEST SUMMARY
Conservatively styled with an authentic up-market aura that extended to
its luxurious interior, our test vehicle was well built, trimmed and
painted. Its new jump-seat has enhanced both seating flexibility and
the walk-through advantages of the VW design, reinforcing a market
leadership which has no real challengers in sight, at the present time.

Volkswagen Caravelle 2,5i   -   20,000 km Test
CAR, December 1993

For those who can afford it, this luxury seven-seater offers an
unrivalled blend of performance, comfort and low-stress travel;
dispite a few niggles ...

The bit they don't tell you when laying out the bucks for a Caravelle
(or a Microbus, for that matter) is that it has to be one of the finest
over-the-counter stress relievers available. Just a week or so in the
peak hour traffic will convince you of this VW bus fringe benefit.

Once you have ceased to be intimidated by the sheer size of the vehicle
(and this was always a problem,  when going for a tight parking spot)
you will be absolutely captivated by the panoramic view afforded by the
giant windscreen. Being perched up high above the traffic with that
eagle-eye view of what lies ahead enables the Caravelle driver to plan
his moves well in advance. Jam-ups are no longer the gut-tightening
source of humour-failure that they are in conventional cars.

That is not to say that our Caravelle experience was a magic carpet ride,
or that the vehicle, good as it is, was without its faults, when
delivered to CAR's editorial offices in mid-1992. We immediately
noticed a slight wheel balance problem, the rear door or tailgate
rattled and the interior light activated by the sliding side door began
flashing on at odd moments.

The other major factor with this vehicle, apart from the width, was
getting used to its forward cab position. Drivers un-used to these
vehicles tend to turn into parking places or cut kerbs too sharply, and
it is all too easy to side-swipe a pole or a parked car until you
realise that the pivotal point of the vehicle is way behind you, unlike
in a conventional car. Other factors include the low nose ground
clearance, which puts the Caravelle's spoiler at risk when entering
driveways or other sudden gradient changes. And then there is the
gearchange.

Very early in the test, we decided to treat the vehicle as a four-
speeder. Hooking first requires a major rib-muscle stretch, while the
change from first to second proved to be just as difficult. With plenty
of torque on tap, we soon began pulling away in second and most
Caravelle owners we spoke to during the period did likewise.

There is no first service listed for VWs at the 1000 km mark. At around
the 5000 km mark we took the car in to Barons of Claremont, asking them
to attend to the interior light, the rear tailgate, the wheel balance
problem, and more ominously as it turned out, a rumble in the brakes.

Despite the vehicle being under warranty, we picked it up the following
day with a bill that detailed R28,00 for wheel balancing (which we
accepted as it was an &quot;outside job&quot; by a specialist), and R72,00 for
adjusting the brakes - which we certainly had no intention of paying.

The service department also advised us that the &quot;rumble&quot; we had thought
was emanating from the brakes was caused by a poorly adjusted wheel
bearing, which had been put right at no charge. The total bill, with
VAT, came to R110, the tailgate and interior light having been fixed
free of charge.

We refused to pay the R72 for the brake adjustment, after pointing out
that while the front brakes were in fact self-adjusting, a problem with
the rear brakes had been identified as a factory problem, covered by a
service bulletin. This required a simple modification to the bolts used
to locate the rear drum brakes to the hubs.

Nevertheless, the rumble was back with us almost immediately. Again, on
consulting other Microbus/Caravelle owners, we discovered that this was
indeed a typical Volksie bus problem.

The brake rumble usually made itself heard when braking from highish
speed - say 120 km/h down to almost a standstill. It sounded as if there
was brake pad flutter, not as if the brake pads were wearing out.

Not satisfied with the situation, we returned the vehicle to Barons,
telling them we were sure the problem was in the front brakes. They
then did some work on the pad installation and for the next two weeks
or so the brakes were quiet, but then they started to rumble again.
We decided to live with the problem until time was on hand for us to
take the vehicle in and get it properly sorted out.

Rumble apart, we were really enjoying the Caravelle's ability to perform
with, or even ahead of, the traffic. The Audi-derived 2,5-litre five-
cylinder motor was at its best when short-shifted, making use of the
hearty spread of torque. It would rev out to 5000 and beyond, but we
found that it was not comfortable when revving high, as an induction
resonance, possibly introduced to safeguard the transmission and
discourage high revs, made the engine a bit rough at higher speeds.

IMPRESSIVE ECONOMY
Fuel consumption was immediately impressive, weighing in around the mid-
13-litres/100 km range, well below our fuel index for the Caravelle. In
fact, running up towards the 7000 km mark, we returned our best
consumption of the test with an average of 12,5 litres/100 km, which was
truly outstanding for such a high-powered vehicle, capable of hauling
seven adults and lots of luggage over long distances.

However, much as we appreciated the dynamics and the general high
standard of body-work and quality materials used, niggling faults
continued to bug us. One morning, the ignition went dead in Fish Hoek,
and the vehicle was towed to Clarks, a local service station, where
the fault was diagnosed as a faulty starter motor.

Clarks charged us R85 for vehicle salvage and the diagnosis. Barons were
then notified and they transported the vehicle to their Claremont
service centre, some 20 km down the Main Road, and later notified us
that the problem had been caused by a voltage drop.

The Caravelle was returned the next day with everything in working order
and no bill attached and two days later, a woman from the service
department called to enquire if everything was in order. She also
assured us that Barons guaranteed its workmanship for 12 months. A nice
personal touch.

However, our electrical troubles weren't over. With 12000 km or so
logged, the main light switch began to play up, the low beam being the
first to go on the blink. Then a few days later, all the lights failed.
The only way to get illumination was to pull back on the high-beam
flasher.

Barons told us they would need the Caravelle for two days, presumably
because they would need to farm some of the work out to an auto
electrician. At the same time, I mentioned to the service staff that the
brake problem was far from cured. In the end, the job took three days,
but as we had alternative transport, we weren't that hassled.

When the vehicle was returned, a new light switch had been fitted as
well as new front discs. Interestingly, the new brakes rumbled a bit
for the first 100 km or so and we thought &quot;uh huh, here we go again&quot;.
But then they settled down and remained noise-free until the end of
the 20000 km test.

With the holiday season approaching, we decided to slot the vehicle in
for its first major service (due at 15000 km) with only 14000 on the
clock, to avoid the big rush. Another reason for doing this was that
some play had developed in the steering column which clearly needed
attention, and the right windscreen washer nozzle needed some
rejuvenation: its squirt had dwindled to a drizzle.

On completion of the service, we found the play in the steering column
was still there, so instead of driving off in the vehicle we left it
there, requesting that it be fixed as soon as possible. The next day
we returned and sure enough, they had managed to fix the play by
replacing a bush.

However, the man who had worked on the car was obviously not familiar
with the VW logo, as he had mounted the steering wheel upside down!
All very amusing, but driving back and forth to Claremont from Pinelands
was now becoming somewhat tiresome.

The next day we picked the car up with everything completed and in due
course, a bill arrived at our offices for the 15000 km service. The
total for labour came to R190,00, while the parts and fluids bill was
R160,02.

UNWANTED ENGINE FLUSH
We pointed out that our order had specifically requested no engine
flush to be used and so we paid for the parts, oil and engine cleaner
and deducted the R17,91 charged for this product, which effectively
meant a parts bill of R142,11.  The standard items, such as an oil
filter, gaskets and spark plugs were fitted, while transmission and
engine oil were changed. The total bill for the service, once we had
pushed through our R17,91 deduction, came to R376,46.

The steering column plastic surround had been rather poorly refitted,
after all the ministrations to the light switch and the steering
column bush, and it now squeaked a bit when the steering wheel was
turned. But other than this, the Caravelle performed superbly,
especially when we took it on a holiday trip to the Eastern Cape.

Doubling as a camper back-up to a hiking tent as well as a daily
sightseer, the Caravelle proved to be the ideal choice for such a
venture. The step-through front seat configuration makes the acres of
space at the back instantly accessible and when we really needed to use
fold-down seats in the rear, after a cloudburst had sent us scuttling
from the tent, we found the sleeping accommodation as comfortable as
The Ritz.

Another aspect that surprised us about the Caravelle was the outright
road-holding of the vehicle. The steering is extremely accurate and the
bulky bus behaves like an outsized go-kart when pushed to the limits,
with extremely neutral handling characteristics.

The rear engine location does get the front end walking around a bit in
gale-force crosswinds, but we never felt nervous behind the wheel and
we would go with the benefits of the rear engine location any time -
quietness, excellent traction and lack of cabin space intrusion - in
preference to the theoretical handling benefits of a front/mid-mounted
layout.

We were never really happy with the air-conditioning system, although
the agents assured us that it was working properly, as we felt it didn't
cool the bus nearly enough in hot weather. Despite some really hard
driving at times, tyre wear was acceptable, with 50 per cent wear (front
and rear) after 20000 km.

Two more niggles that occurred before we very reluctantly handed the
Caravelle back were that the spare wheel was finally stolen (almost
every Caravelle owner we spoke to had lost a spare wheel to theft), and
it was replaced at a cost of R426,48 for the alloy rim and R341,39
(fitted and balanced) for a new Goodyear 205/70 steelbelt tyre.  We
still can't understand why VWSA don't supply hefty spare wheel locks as
standard equipment, when they are fully aware that the problem exists.

The other minor niggle was that the steering column trim suffered a
fracture, due to the poor fit after so many removals during the 20000
km. Once a small piece fell away, the squeaking stopped. We were
impressed by the low overall fuel consumption of just 13,76 litres/100
km, by the effortless performance and most of all, by the stress-free
ride, seated high above the rest of the traffic.
