Subject: 

&gt;There is a place in Texas, called VW Canvas (see their ad in HVW), that
&gt;claims to use superior quality canvas (I have not actually seen their 
&gt;product).  What I would do is call and ask for a sample of material before
&gt;buying anything.

I have seen the VW Canvas stuff (as mentioned in my earlier message).
They have standard heavy canvas in sort of a greeninsh grey, or for some 
extra bucks, striped awning material, which could look pretty spiff if you 
get the colors right.  It's a one-man shop, and the guy there is real nice. 
I used to live a couple of miles from him.  Ahh - Austin, what a great town...
