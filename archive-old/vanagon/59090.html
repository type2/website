Subject: Re: propane gauge?

&gt;I too am having troubles getting the fridge to run on gas.  Have tried all
the &gt;easy suggestions, now I guess we have to get down to the serious stuff.

Ditto.  Mine won't light either.  I have tried most of the usual tricks
including: blowing in drain hole, pumping like crazy, bleeding propane
lines by running stove several minutes, trying to light fridge while
running stove, pumping like crazy on just one foot, precooling fridge on AC
before lighting, blowing compressed air through drain hole, pumping like
crazy while singing Deutschland Uber Alis, ordering the LiMBO's Dometic
Fridge manual (for a 182 B, I actually have a 182 C), pumping like crazy
with both hands (don't try this one at home), praying to an assortment of
Gods.

I am now convinced my piezo isn't sparking.  I think I will try to remove
the fridge this weekend.  I don't know what good that will do even if I do
get it out. 

Still waiting for a Dometic miracle......
