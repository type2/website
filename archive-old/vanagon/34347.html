Subject:       Re: Late Split VDO Clocks..

&gt; You folks are spoiled by your modern solid state quartz clocks to the point
&gt; that you don't remember the old electromechanical clocks described above. 
&gt; Detroit (shudder) used them for years, and they generally lasted the length of
&gt; the vehicle's warranty or 1 year, whichever was less.  And long term
&gt; accuracy?? HA!

Hah!  I'll have you know the clock in the Pioneer loses no more than 
20 mintes a day!  &lt;Big Grin&gt;

It still looks cool though!
