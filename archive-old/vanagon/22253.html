Subject: Engine pulling nightmare(s)

Greetings all,

I thought I would give and update on this weekends engine pulling.

All of you that suggested that my fuel starvation problem was caused by
foriegn matter in the tank get a medal! I found several credit card sized
peices of neophrene rubber inside the tank! AND, the cone shaped screen on
the bottom of the tank had not been intalled, which explains the leakage I
smelled; the screen has a gasket for the flange in the union nut at the
bottom of the tank.

Getting the engine out was a real drag. The previous owner, who is a
partner in a VW shop in Santa Rosa, was a real turd. almost every nut and
bolt was stripped/rounded over/missing. There were no engine bearer bolts
nuts on the tranny mount. I had to butcher the studs getting the motor out,
and as I rolled the engine away from the bus on the jack, the insides of
the generator came out! A  bunch of rotten windings and other misc.
&lt;&lt;stuff&gt;&gt;.

I got the gas tank out, removed the sender-which had no gasket, further
expaining the gas leakage and reenforcing my suspicion that the bus's old
master is a boob. Much to my horror, the new sender from Rocky Mountain
Motor Works was sans gasket!!!! I told them that I wanted the gasket more
than the sender, I was only replacing the sender 'cause my gas guage was
off by about 1/4 tank.

I was also missing most of the engine tin screws, so I bummed a ride to
Donsco (air colled shop in the area) and arrived just in time to see them
locking up. They closed at three. AARGH!!!!!!!

I piddled around Sunday, replacing broken studs and soldering hokey wiring.
Called in broken down to work monday, got the parts and put it all back
in-new fuel gauge sender, generator, clutch bearing, and a bunch of little
stuff.

Everything works great exept, half way home the fuel guage went from 3/4 to
1/1! when I got home, I pulled the connection off at the rear and guess
what? The wire is grounded between the fire wall and the tank!!!!!! now I
have no guage at all. I'm thinking of drilling a hole from inside the car
to see if I cant replace the wire and then bondo up the whole.

What a pain for nothin'
Ken
