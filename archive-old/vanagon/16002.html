Subject: Speaking of batteries...


This is a complement to the message I posted in rec.motorcycles, if 
anyone happens to be strange enough to read both this list and that group 
(like me :) ).

I have several pounds of EDTA kicking around my office that I'd like to 
get rid of.  When used according to directions, EDTA will reduce and/or 
prevent sulfation of battery plates, the number one killer of young 
batteries.

I'm selling enough to treat two car sized batteries (48g) for $5 plus 
$2.50 shipping.  I also have several papers I glommed from rec.moto and 
an alternative energy bulletin board that praise the merits of EDTA in 
extending battery life, if anyone's interested in them.

Reply direct if you have any questions or just send a check to:
Jack Reed, 2932 Swing Station, Fort Collins CO 80521 and it'll go out the 
next day.

Jack
