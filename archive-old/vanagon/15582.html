&gt; Yea, the engines are the same whether 2wd or syncrhro. I think head jobs were
&gt; common in 84s,5s,6s&amp;7s due to pitting which caused leaking at the head
&gt; gasket. Wrong antifreeze was blamed by some but I don't buy that. I used
&gt; &quot;Autobahn&quot; all the time and it still happened to my 87 at 77K(head job
&gt; courtesy VW). I would't worry about a head job--if that's all it was--as long
&gt; as someone didn't overheat the engine beforehand. I know 2 people who ran the
&gt; engine out of coolant and needed much more major work.
You are right on the mark about this. I think all of us who owned those
waterboxers from those years had that problem. 
After I decided not to take my bus back to the dealer and started to do all
the repairs myself, this was what I found.
     Pitting on the lips of the cylinder heads. It could not be the coolant
     since most coolants today are already designed for aluminium heads.
     Anyway not to take any chances always use the VW &quot;autobahn&quot; which
     cost 3 times the regular coolant. Its a lot of vw crab  but who knows.
   I think its the sealant that VW uses that caused the corrosion. Most of
   these stuff contains some kind of acetic acid which may attack the 
   aluminium. I just replaced the gaskets and have substituted the silicone
   with the permatex sealant. ( Caution: Make sure you use the blue variety
    which is designed for aluminium heads. The red variety cannot be used)
    So far no leaks. Keeping my fingers crossed. 
    Also I heard from the dealer that those two parts push-rod tubes which
    saves you from removing those heads and thus a major job are no good.
    They will leak again. Any experience from anyone who had used these
    retrofits ?
&gt; One thing I'd check is the exhaust system integrity--but a 86 may have that
&gt; all done over. Mine (now 119K) was mostly replaced at 70K, but our salty
&gt; roads are murder on those pipes hanging at the rear.
&gt; Mine is almost gone. I have rewelded thebugger so many times due to the
  severe rusting. 
  Does anyone know where I can buy a stainless steel version replacement
  if it its available. Or perhaps if enough people wants it we can 
  convince a mfr to make it and give us a quote.
  Once a diehard vw fan I dont bother with vw anymore other than to buy
  replacement parts from them.
