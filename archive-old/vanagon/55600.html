Subject: FW: SA Rear windows- hey, they open!
Date: Thu, 6 Feb 1997 11:14:36 -0700


Looking at this image of the South African Vanagon,  I see the rear most
windows are sliders, not solid.  Does anyone know if these are
available?  Same window opening in body?

Also, Just so no one gets too excited, these are right hand drive.

&gt;
&gt;Hi, All -
&gt; 
&gt;I'm currently sifting thru the feedback, looks positive.
&gt;
&gt;here's another website you can punch up with a pic of a brand new SA
&gt;&quot;Microbus&quot; 
&gt;( I know - thats sacreliege to call a Vanagon a &quot;Microbus&quot;!!, but hey - I
&gt;didn't
&gt;name it)
&gt;
&gt;So, as you know - any reference to &quot;Microbus&quot; &quot;Kombi&quot;  &quot;Caravelle&quot;
&gt;&quot;Volksiebus&quot;
&gt;etc.  is all referring to the current Vanagon bodied 5 cyl rear engined  Vans
&gt;that are still being made there. (this was forwarded to me by a someone in SA
&gt;-
&gt;he thought the name &quot;Vanagon&quot; sounded strange...) I don't blame him  :&lt;)
&gt;
&gt;Anyway - here it is: ( &quot;R&quot; is the South African monetary unit, the Rand)
&gt;I must tell you - the pics take a long time to load, and there was a bunch of
&gt;&quot;schrapnel&quot; on the finished image...
&gt;-Notice how the lower rad. grille goes all the way to the turn sigs....
&gt;and the bumpers are different too, and I believe those are the European
&gt;version
&gt;of the Carat alloy wheel....
&gt;try it out.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Check out a pic of a current Microbus with the new-style dual round
&gt;&gt;headlight grille at:
&gt;&gt;http://www.mg.co.za/mg/oldvolks/newmicro.jpg
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;If you're on the vanagon (awful name!) list you might want to point them at
&gt;&gt;it as I gather there is some interest in the Audi-engined SA Micros. Just
&gt;&gt;to update you, VWSA still builds the old rear-engined Microbuses (as you
&gt;&gt;know) with a choice of engines: 1,8l carb-fed Golf engine, 2,3l FI Audi and
&gt;&gt;2,6l FI Audi. They come in Panelvan (1,8 only), Volksiebus (1,8 and 2,3),
&gt;&gt;Microbus (2,6) and Caravelle (2,6) guises. The Volksiebus version is the
&gt;&gt;equivalent of the old Kombi, tho nowhere near as spartan. They are also not
&gt;&gt;cheap -- the 1,8l Volksiebus costs over R80 000 (R4,50 to the dollar) with
&gt;&gt;the Caravelle starting at nearly R150 000.
