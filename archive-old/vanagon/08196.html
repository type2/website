Subject: Re: Non-stock Bosch O2 Sensor

Does anyone have a make/model/year of a Ford product that takes 
the 3 wire sensor?  All the FLAPS folks want to do is look it up
on the computer and are generally unwilling to play around trying
to match a part.

 &gt;&gt;So what's the consensus of opinion.  Since I have the one-wire connector,
 &gt;&gt;is the Ford dealer out?  I definitely want to stick with Bosch equipment
 &gt;&gt;so the aftermarket suppliers are out.  Is the Ford part cheaper than the
 &gt;&gt;VW issue part?  Is the Ford part a three-wire or one wire?
 &gt;&gt;Should I worry about this after I find out what the oil pressure
 &gt;&gt;situation is?
 &gt;
 &gt;definitely go for the Ford dealer or the local parts store. you get Bosch
 &gt;parts anyway (i don't think anybody else makes those things) and it's a
 &gt;helluva lot cheaper than the vw dealer. the FLAPS here sells one-wire bosch
 &gt;for about $30.  Ford uses both 3-wire and 1-wire, but on different years and
 &gt;models (just like vw). so you'll have to ask.
 &gt;
 &gt;i dunno. it's kind of a side-issue to the oil pressure; something you can be
 &gt;doing while you wait for an idea or part on the oil pressure. :)
