Subject: Head Gasket help?

Try the &quot;Bars Leaks&quot; product (the version with the pellets).  It
seems to have worked on my '82 diesel -- no trouble after about 4 months.
The mechanic here at the dealer told me that this stuiff will not hurt
the cooling system, at worst it will not solve your problem.

 &gt; I advised all of a coolant problem I was having (dripping anti-fireeze) which
 &gt; was properly diagonsed as a leaky plastic coolant tank.
 &gt; 
 &gt; While having this replaced my mechanic advised me  that my head gaskets were
 &gt; leaking slightly.  He suggests a complete repair...(.maybe $1500)!  Should I
 &gt; wait untill the problem is major?  Are there any economical fixes?  I'll
 &gt; probably get another quote but I'm bummed.  I've got 90,000 miles on the 87'
 &gt; Vanagon Westy...
 &gt; 
 &gt; Any thoughts appreciated,
