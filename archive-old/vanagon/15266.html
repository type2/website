Subject: Universal Cases

Does anyone know how to identify a universal case.  I need to find a
motor for my '69 squareback, and am wondering what to look for when I go
searching through junkyards.  Type III's are much rarer than busses, so
assume it would be easier to find a motor from a bug or 68-71 bus.  Am I
correct to assume that most newly built motors are built with the
Universal Cases?  
Actually before I go shelling money out for a new case, I'd be curious
to know if anyone thinks that my case is rebuildable.  When I bought the
car it ran okay, but leaked lots of oil.  I suspected push rod tubes/oil
cooler etc, but when I took the engine tin off, I noticed that all of
the bolts that held the cases halves together were loose(one had
actually fallen off).  One mechanic I talked to said that because the
engine had been run &quot;loose&quot;, the case would never seal right again.  I
never actually cracked the case to assess the damage, I just bolted it
back together, but it didn't really help the oil leak problem.  Has
anyone ever had this happen on a vw motor.
