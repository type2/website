&gt;&gt;Sounds like you have a great relationship with your dealer! I wish I had a similar one, unfortunately,
&gt;&gt;I don't think many people do.

In my dictionary, dealership means rip off. You don't need to figure that
out by looking at my dictionary. By talking to the dealer, it is said so
over and over in the conversation.

I bought a battery from my local dealer. It was clearly said 3 years warranty.
Two years later the battery was dead. I called the dealer asking about the
warranty. They said &quot;come and get ripped!&quot; over and over in the conversation.

They told me I had to bring in the car for a charging system checkup. It would 
cost me $85 for labor. If it turns out that the charging system is fine they
will pay me something like less than $10 for the warranty. I still have to 
pay the $85 for the checkup. They were just unaware that I am an EE major
who knows exactly if the charging system is at fault.

I did not bother to bitch. I bought a new battery from Costco and it has been
fine for a long time. BTW the same dealer tried to sell me Repco brake pads
for $70/set saying their mechanics recommended it. I looked at the &quot;Genuine
VW Parts&quot; sign and asked how much the Audi pads cost and was told they don't
have it in stock.

Ripping people off is the business. Can't avoid it completely if you fall in
love with the car they made for such business.
