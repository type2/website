&gt; I...ah, uhm..., well, I don't know what a timing belt is. There, I said it!
&gt; The one on my wife's Accord had to be changed to prevent major trouble if
&gt; it breaks. The only engine I'm more or less familiar with is in my bus and
&gt; never did I read anything in Muir, Bentley, The List about such a device on
&gt; our beloved air-cooled ones.

Timing belts are usually found on overhead cam engines.  They drive the
camshaft(s).  The VW van engine (through 83, probably later) has a gear driven
camshaft.  And I thank God for it :)
