&gt;  Went to have my propane tank filled on &quot;Leslie&quot; 87 Syncro Westy in
&gt; preparation for the upcoming three day weekend, and Kim my friendly Madison
&gt; area propane expert coudn't get the gas to stay in the tank. Seems the
&gt; o-rings are shot or possibly the entire valve.... Hank (I mean Kim) says
&gt; &quot;you can't get these o-rings or valves anywhere&quot;.... Bill VW dealer parts
&gt; guru says &quot;I can get you the whole valve from VW for 6 pints of blood and
&gt; one of your vital organs ($320).&quot;  Me says NO!
&gt; 
&gt;  Any wisdom from the list? Part sources for these pups? This valve seems
&gt; pretty simple...
&gt; 
&gt; Much Thanx!   R.
