So Joel Walker says:
&gt; 
&gt; Jon Peters went on about the barndoors again, so i say:
&gt; 
&gt; ok. barndoors are a separate &quot;generation&quot;. then so are Syncros. they have
&gt; more physical differences from other 2wd Vanagons than Barndoors have from
&gt; later Microbuses. and Syncros drive very different (especially in the dirt!).
&gt; 
&gt; so now we've increased the confusion to what ... 6 &quot;generations&quot;??
&gt; 
&gt; joel
&gt; 

I'm sorry, but I can't buy that.  It's the same basic body style.  It has
nothing to do with what kinda doors are on it.  Those differences are
just features for that generation.  A split is a split, period.  Same
with the vanagon.  You were right the first time Joel.  Oh, IMO.
