Subject: Seal around sliding door

I'm looking for the door seal for the sliding door on my '78 bus, it's
about $300 here.  TOO MUCH FOR ME!  Anyone use anything else to do the
job?  Maybe rubber tubing or something?  If so, could you please explain
what you did and with which materials, all help appreciated!  THanks.
