Subject: '71 bus camshaft question
Date: Thu, 13 Jul 1995 16:40:44 -0400 (EDT)

Hi folks,

Thanks for the many responses to 'The Dirty Work'.  The variation
 of suggestions was amazing.  I ended up taking my crankcase
to be 'tanked', though it cost $35.  The smaller shops here in
Tallahassee have gotten out of the business because of
environmental protection regulations.  I've been through a gallon or two
of Simple Green on the engine compartment...it's no miracle cleaner,
but it smells good and is kinder to our mom.

Question:  When disassembling my crankcase, I compleatly scrambled
the cam lifters (followers?). Didn't read not to in the Idiot's guide.
The mechanic that I took things to for general inspection and boring
caught this and said that they should stay matched, and gave a very
reasonable explanation why (won't go into it for time's sake).

Is this true, or am I getting the _shaft_?  Ouch! sorry about that:)

Do I get new camshaft and lifters?  The shiny part of the camshaft has
some dark streaky areas, but _looks_ OK otherwise to a rookie's eye.

TIA!
