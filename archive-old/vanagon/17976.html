Subject: Another Possibility for East Coast Gathering


In my on-going attempt to try to get a Northeast and or East Coast
gathering this summer, here's another suggestion (as I haven't
heard anything further on B&amp;Js):

Saturday &amp; Sunday - July 15/16

CVA's 11th annual meet, Lime Rock Park, CT.

Saturday 7/15

Ruced rate admission to the SCCA Regional Races - including
FORMULA VEE!!

Drive the Track during the Lunch Break

CVA campout co-sponsored by LiMBO

Sunday 7/16
All VW Car show and Swap Meet - This year's featured Vehicle - TYPE 2s!!!

Free Dash Plaques (as opposed to dental plaque) for the first 150 entries
in the car show

For more info call John Kelly (203) 250-9119 - event chairperson


So anyone up for this one? Or should I shut up? ( ok Steve Johnson...
I just gave you an opening  ;-)   )

Ric
