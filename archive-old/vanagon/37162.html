Subject: Tires for '88 Westy

Hi all,

Another question which is probably in the archives... but..

My new '88 has two new Conti's on the rear, but some shiny new 
Autopar cr*p on the front, which makes cornering, ummm interesting. 
So far, I've found the following choices for tires:

Conti 185/14 Reinf.  $145 at VW dealer
Michelin LTX 195/14 $118 
Yokohama LT 195/14 $118 (unsure of model, but LT rating)
Cheapo Korean 195/14 LT $85... 

Questions:
Is is possible to get a 195 or 205/70R14 profile and still get the 
proper load rating?
Of those mentioned, which have shown good results?
Any others which are not mentioned which should be?

Thanks.

I haven't lost my mind;  I'm sure it's backed up on tape somewhere!
