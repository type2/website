Subject: Head gasket/spacer on T4 engine?

OK,

        I took the engine out of my '72 to find the oil leaks, and wanting
to find TDC (once and for all).  I took one head off and found no seal,
gasket, or even spacer between the head and cylinder.  There was evidence of
&quot;blow-by&quot; on both heads, and it appeared that the piston and head were
keeping close company at the bottom - both were shiny - unlike the rest of
the head and piston. 
         Do I need to stop here, not pass go, find the proper parts, or is
this how a VW T4 engine does?  
        Bob Hoover was kind enough to answer an earlier posting in which I
mentioned the blowby, and he said it shouldn't be in any engine.
        I guess my main question is: is there something supposed to be
between the cylinder and the head?

        I wait with that old stinky 'baited breath' for the collective
wisdom to educate me.

        Thanks in advance.
