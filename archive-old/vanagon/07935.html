&gt; 
&gt; It would certainly be a boon if many of these parts are shared, as 
&gt; there are probably more Audi Quattros sitting in wrecking yards around 
&gt; the country than the total number of Vanagon Syncros imported into the 
&gt; US. And in the Seattle area, I've seen low mileage Quantum Syncros

&gt; 
&gt; Any ideas?

Paul,

I have a quantum syncro wagon and a vanagon syncro westfalia and I can 
tell you there is probably not one part that is interchangeable, except
perhaps for the bulbs and oil (and off course the cheesy vw doodads - 
lamp housings, ash trays, etc.)

The quantum syncro used the audi quattro style 4wd (in fact it really was 
just a poor man's audi quattro wagon - with an identical drivetrain), while 
the vanagon uses the viscous-coupled arrangement.

If it only were true....
