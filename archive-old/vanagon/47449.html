Subject: Re: Muffler &amp; pipe patches

&gt;I've had some on-going diologue with several listees concerning my muffler
&gt;system. 
&gt;I figure that there may be a way to buy an exhaust pipe to connect to the
&gt;muffler over the opening (assuming I can find a square or triangular flat
&gt;piece attached to the exhaust pipe) and either bolt or weld the piece over
&gt;the opening to create a new solid pipe.
&gt;
&gt;I've also been told to weld a patch on the pipe. My question is how do I go
&gt;about this? Do I go to an automotive shop or seek out someone who does just
&gt;welding?
&gt;
&gt;If anyone else has been doiwn this path I sure could use some advice!!

Hi Bill,
     You would benefit from finding a good welder.  I am a compitent welder,
and have made a new muffler for my syncro.  I cut the flanges for it from
3/8&quot; cold roll and shapped it then welded it to a $25.00 glass pack.  I used
a 2&quot; curved pipe that I purchesed from FLAPS.  I have also welded cracks in
the exhaust pipes, at the 2 into 1 collector and also on the pipe between
the collector and the cat.  Check all the mounting points, one of mine was
broken and it caused the cracking.  Good luck, exhuasts are expensive.
