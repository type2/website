Subject: will SO drive the '56

Hey Thom,

I see that you're trying to sell the 911T...

&gt;'56 VW Sunroof Kombi
&gt;'72 Porsche 911T Targa  (For Sale?  Make offer!)
&gt;'78 BMW 530i
&gt;Desperately seeking '51-'55 Barndoor Deluxe Project

Does this mean that when the '78 BMW 530i breaks down your
SO will be driving the '56 VW Sunroof Kombi??? As I recall
you were pretty bent out of shape when she had to drive the
Porsche.

Just curious,
