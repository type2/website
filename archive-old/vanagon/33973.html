Subject: VW death machine?


        Just crawled out of bed... turned on the radio to see how c-c-cold
it is outside...

        ...the first thing I hear:  &quot;A body was found inside of a
Volkswagen van... Oakland county officials have not said yet whether they
suspect that Dr. Jack Kervorkian was involved...&quot;
