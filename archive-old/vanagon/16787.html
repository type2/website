Subject: sway bar?

I was looking through some automotive catolog yesterday, and I saw a
anti-sway bar or something for old volkswagens with the swing axle rear
suspension.  Does anybody know anything about it?  Are they worth it?
(price-$60-70)  Are the swing axles that bad, especially at higher speeds? 
Oh, and I am still planning on towing that 58 double cab home, but I
thought I should probably have the bearings regreased.  Does anyone know
how much this should cost to be done?  And one final question, how much
would a new wiring harness cost?  Could I go with a used one at all? 
Thanks
