&gt; I have a 1990 Synchro Westie.  During the last month it has developed a 
&gt; loud, low hum and strong vibrations.  They get worse with higher 
&gt; speeds, but seem worst between 40-50 mph, and above 70mph.  Engine rpm 
(snip)&gt; 

   Been there done that just a mouth ago! Start by removing the
   drive shaft and driving. If the vibration is still there put
   the rear axle up on jack stands, and run the motor thru the gears.
   My problem turned out to be a tire with an internal bubble. As 
   the tire was running it would get hot and the vibration got worse!
