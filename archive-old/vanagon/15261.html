Subject: Read Print Magazine 


Check out the March edition of PRint Magazine (one of those expensively
glossy rags for graphic artist types- $7.00) for a great article on the
most successful car ad campaign ever: VW. 

It's a fascinating account of VW and it's advertising efforts, and a good
history lesson on our beloved mobiles for those of us (ahem) who were not
around to watch VW come into existence.
