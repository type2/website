Subject: Re: oil light

&gt;My '84 vanagon oil light always comes on when coming to idle after a
&gt;highway run. Normal,I think,mentioned in the owner's manual. When it's wet
&gt;out, my oil light glows dimly, I always thought due to the placement of the
&gt;oil sender and the road/moisture. I never pursued it because nothing ever
&gt;became of it. 130k on the car.
&gt;
No they really shouldn't do this.. bad vanagon bad. The oil pressure sender
is really quite amazing on the Vanagon. It consist of two pressure switches
that must respond in the correct sequence during startup within a specified
time frame. Whew! Failing either of these parameters causes the bell and
light show.

Althought many things can go wrong one of the most common and easiest to fix
is corrosion/loose connectors/moisure. Get some contact cleaner from say,
Radio Shark. Clean the switch's male connection and the connectors female
socket. Before reassembling apply a generous coating of silicon dielectric
paste, this will seal the moisure and oxygen out. Viola, no more corrosion.
Now Mr Vanagon can hear what the sensors are saying and all will be well.

Darn near all electrical connectors should be treated this way to start with.
