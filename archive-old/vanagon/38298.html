Subject: RE: End play (was: Siezed pancake on table)


&gt;Speaking of end-play. How does everyone check their end play?
&gt;
&gt;Do you have a fancy gauge, do you do the goofy Muir thing, or do you have
&gt;some other method?


Sorry for the lack of detail in this reply, but...

Many years ago, I got a small, simple gadget for measuring crank end-play
at the flywheel. Don't remember where I got it-- one of the mail-order
firms that advertise in DBs&amp;HVWs, I believe-- it was a long time ago.

It was a machined piece of steel that bolted to one of the engine mount
holes, and held a free bolt over the surface of the flywheel. You gave
the pulley a firm shove to extend the flywheel out to its maximum distance
from the engine. Then take your multi-bladed feeler gauge, put the
.015 blade under the screw, and screw it down gently until it just presses
the blade against the flywheel. Then you turned a stop nut down on the
bolt to hold it in this position. Make sure the .015 blade is still
snug, but not crushed of course.

Then yank hard on the pulley to pull the flywheel snug against the engine--
hopefully it will only move a few thousandths of an inch if your end play
is correct. Without moving the screw, start trying thicker blades under it,
till you find the one that now fits as snugly as the .015 one did.

Subtract the thin one from the thick one, and that's your end play.

I don't remember where I got this gadget-- has anyone seen one advertised
by any of the mail order outfits or FLAPSs?
