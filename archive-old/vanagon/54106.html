&gt; &gt; We were using cheap injector cleaner ($6.00 for 5 applications) not
&gt; &gt; OCTANE BUSTER. The cost increase in minimal. A smooth running and
&gt; &gt; efficient engine is a happy engine so a small cost is worth it.

&gt; That's interesting I was going to ask you if you were using something
&gt; inexpensive.  What was it? 

Its EXTRA-STRENGTH - ECONOMY SIZE - Fuel Injector Cleaner - 500 ml -
treats 5 Fifty Litre Tanks - from MOTORMASTER. Motormaster is the house
brand name for Canadian Tire Corp., known locally as &quot;crappy tire&quot;. This
is the biggesy FLAPS in Canada sort of like a Home Depot and Wal-Mart
jointed together and provides cheap products for anything.
