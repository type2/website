Subject: Leaky head gasket (wasserboxer)

Hi everybody,

  Well, I have my '91 Vanagon Camper in for 60,000 mile service and -- 
surprise, surprise -- the service guys found oil in the coolant (or was
it coolant in the oil) and are quite sure I have a small head gasket
leak. I've heard enough about this on the list that it isn't entirely
unexpected. :-(  I'm not too pleased, though, since I have always kept
an eye on the coolant level, used nothing but Autobahn coolant, had it
flushed and replaced by the dealer after two years and I'm now on a one-
year schedule for this.

  The service guys are recommending head gasket replacement as soon as
possible since the worse it gets, the more likely that pitting will
happen. They are also saying that it is likely that the head will need
replacing. (No kidding. Wouldn't the head warping be the most likely
cause for a leaky gasket? Gee, I wonder if the head warping is from
hot spots due to not &quot;burping&quot; the cooling system after refilling by
lifting whichever end of the vehicle...)

  Obviously, I'm not too thrilled about paying for a big job like this
when it's probably due to either bad design by VW or improper work by
the dealer. One way or the other I will have it done since I love my
camper! :-)  I thought there was mention on the list of some sort of
VW &quot;secret warranty&quot; on this, and I even remember something about special
pricing on a replacement engine for (I think) was this. Does anyone
remember what I'm talking about?  Please drop me an email if you know
anything on this...
