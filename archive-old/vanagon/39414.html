Subject: VW Bus stigma

The list made me laugh the last couple of days with all the letters about 
Deadheads, drugs and Garcia. One thing is for sure, people will always assign 
a stereotype to you if they see you get out of a VW.They may think you're a 
hippie or a druggie or a flower child or whatever,people will cop a view.I've 
actually had people ask me if I just like to travel slowly! Little do they 
realize that I have a motorcycle that will do 160mph that I ride. Lastly to 
stir the pot a little further; no one has said anything about the fact that 
Dr. Kervorkian drives a old bay window .Do you suppose that every time people 
in Michigan see a bay window rolling down the street they will say&quot;there goes 
Dr. Death&quot;?  Tom Czerniak.    85 Westy, 66 Deluxe
