Subject:       Need timing advice (upright aircooled)

Hola,

I need some input on where to time a stock upright (1600) engine with 
a 009 distributor.  I know I should run it and see if it pings, etc. 
but I would like to know where to start.  I'm thinking 7.5 deg btdc, 
since that's where it seems engines w/o vaccum advance were generaly 
set, but I'd like a little reasurrance.  Any takers???  Thanks!
