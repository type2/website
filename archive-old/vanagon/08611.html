Subject: Grundig radio.

Just had to share this with everybody. For the last two and a half months
I have been trying to to get my local mechanic to sell me this old
Grundig radio he took out of a customer's car. It has been sitting on the
shelf for a long time, but before he would sell it to me he wanted to check
with the old owner to make sure he didn't want it.

This mechanic operates at the speed of molasses, and each time i'd got in
to see him about the radio he'd say &quot;i want to check with the owner before
i sell it to you&quot;. This has been going  since mid October. I must have
checked with him 20 times, and the same answer.

Well today he sold it to me.......for $5.00 :) :) :)!! It is a Grundig
AM/FM/SW radio, all complete and working in VG condition.

Boring technical stuff.... this is a Grundig radio with VW part #
111.035.103E stamped on the side of it, and is an Emden Model IIIE. This
radio is a 12 volt model and came out of a 67' Bug (i think).

The only thing i think i need to do to fit it in my 12 volt 65' Westfalia
is to find the correct face plate for a type II. The chrome face plate I am
looking for should look like this:

__/----------\__
|               |
--\__________/--

Bus/Type II faceplate


the Beetle faceplate (which is currently on the radio) is more
rectangularlike the crude picture below

-------------------------

Anybody out there in Type II land have one of these chrome faceplates, or
have any info on the part #?

BTW, thanks for the LIMBO classified's Joel
