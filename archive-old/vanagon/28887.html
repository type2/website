Subject: Hot engine acceleration.

Hi,

I have a quick question for the group (if there is such a thing). My 87
Westy has been having a hard time accelerating. When it its cold it runs
well, lots of power with steady pickup.  As soon as it warms up to operating
temp I have to add a lot more gas to bring the van up to speed. Consequently
I burn a lot more gas. I've recently bought the 0.5$ 10 uF capacitor for
$170 so I don't feel its related to that problem.  Has anyone else had the
same sort of lack of power? If so, how did you address the problem.

Ed.

Thanks to everyone that shed light on the ISCU issue. Its been really
snowing hard here lately and I haven't been able to work on the engine just
yet. I'm looking forward to trying the suggestions as soon as Mother Nature
gives me a chance.
