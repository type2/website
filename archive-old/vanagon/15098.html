&gt; 1986-1991 fiche, the gasket is listed and notes that a sealant should also
&gt; be used. this sealant is also specified in the Head Gasket Replacement
&gt; Procedure in the tech bulletins and elsewhere.
&gt; 
&gt; ok. so what's funny about that? well, the 1980-1985 fiche does NOT have the
&gt; sealant noted. it's not even listed. ??? why would the 2.1 liter engine need
&gt; the head gasket sealant, but the 1.9 liter engine would not??

As I changed my head gaskets last year I used this sealant. I do not know 
wether the sealant was mentioned on the dealer's fiche, but I asked for 
it and they sold it without problems.

No problems since then.
