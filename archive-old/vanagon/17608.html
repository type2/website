 	i am planning to travel in mexico, central and south america in my
	74 camper, how's the availibility of engine parts for that
	year?  i am now making a list of things to buy for my trip
	if you have any suggestions please share!
	i am doing the following things

		1)i will try to buy as much oil before i leave the u.s.
		
		2)phase II tool kit
	
		3)talking on the internet about what makes a vw  tick
	
		also, i have only owned my vw for 7 months now and 
		haven't had any major problems, but i plan to take 

		about a month and check the brakes, steering, and 
		engine, (possibly remove it to fix that pesky
		oil leak).  

		this is my plan i hope it comes works out.
