Hi Dave,
	While you make some good points, I still think that the ability 
to blow up the planet once should have been enough.  My question is why 
didn't it stop there?  

I'll gladly conceed on the VW point, and add that Hitler's demand for 
easy troop movements gave Eisenhower the idea for our interstate highway 
system.  Of course this program has its opponents for what it did to 
small towns and two lane highways like Route 66.  

And I guess that back to the military spending question, why did this 
congress try to give the military more money than they had even asked for 
while advocating cutting social programs?

Have a good holiday,
dave.

&quot;Those who forget their mistakes are bound to repeat them&quot; (or something 
close to that)

&gt; &gt; And I always thought that Porche was just a car designer who happened to 
&gt; &gt; have designed a &quot;peoples car&quot;  that Hitler decided fit into his plans 
&gt; &gt; pretty well. 
&gt; 
&gt; You thought wrong, at least according to my sources.  From the May 1969
&gt; &quot;Autocar&quot;, reprinted in &quot;How to Hot Rod VW Engines&quot;, I quote:
&gt; 
&gt; &quot;The request from Hitler to design a People's Car gave him (Porsche) the
&gt; chance to bring the low-drag, low-power (Beetle) to fruition.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; It seems clear that without Hitler there is a good chance the VW Beetle
&gt; would have been stillborn.  I am not condoning Hitler nor trying to
&gt; imply that he was anything less than the murdering villian he was, but
&gt; he *did* play a significant role in the history of the VW.  I know how
&gt; tempting it is for people to want to believe otherwise.
&gt;  
&gt; &gt; &gt; and the same technology that destroy Nagasaka and Hiroshima cured cancers
&gt; &gt; &gt; in thousands of people and powered submarines that deterred war for many
&gt; &gt; &gt; years. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; If I remember correctly, among survivors of the bombings there were 
&gt; &gt; astronomical  cancer and birth defect rates.  And just think about all 
&gt; &gt; the people who could have been assisted with funds which were used to 
&gt; &gt; build up a nuclear  arsenal which is capable of destroying the planet 
&gt; &gt; many times over. Not to mention the Reagan-Bush national debt growth.
&gt; 
&gt; BUT, if we had used the money for humanitarian aid, we might have ALL
&gt; been blown sky high by the former Soviet Union in World War Three.
&gt; Shoulda Woulda Coulda.  Hindsight 20-20.  Armchair Quarterback.  Get my
&gt; drift, Dave?  BTW, my own mother is one of the ones treated for cancer
&gt; by radiation, and she's still with me.  I applaud the coming of the
&gt; nuclear age.  It's like anything else - abuse it, and it will hurt you,
&gt; but that's no reason to ignore it.
