&gt; What someone needs to do is to replace whatever aged gunk is living in
&gt; their tranny (aged gunk? not us on vanagon-L, no, no, no, no, no, no) with
&gt; brand spankin' new organic (as oposed to synthetic?) lube and give it the
&gt; shiftin' test. Then, drain this and replace with synthetic.
&gt; 
&gt; Now at this point, is any difference observed?

Well, I've done part of this at least and counting my experience with
other vehicles I'll elaborate. Last winter I replaced the origional '76
VW fill in my old Bus for the first time, had never been replaced only
topped off over it's life.  Put in standard parts store regular
non-synthetic oil, 80W90 GL4 rated.  I experienced absolutely no
improvement in shifting but had had no real problems before doing
the service, just did it for peace of mind since it was under $2
a quart, did make me feel good as there was a lot of crap on the
magnetic drain plug including 1 real good size piece that may have
been the tip of a shift fork or something, but like I said, it had
no problems, shifted smoothly as any Bus and didn't jump out of gear
or anything so I ignored it.  In my '86 Quantum I replaced the oil
which was nearly 3/4 qt low when I bought it (oops) with Synthoil brand
75W90 GL5/6 rated stuff.  Now before doing so I had trouble getting
out of 5th after a long high speed (average 85 mph) drive, after 
changing that problem dissapeared but like I said it was so profoundly
low on oil likely any change would have helped, of course I also
got rid of the car about 1 year later when some internal bearing
in that incredibly expensive 016 Syncro tranny started making
intermintent howling noises, still the guy I sold it to heard the
noise wasn't concerned and has put 40,000 on it since then.  Now
a potential problem there might have been the GL5 rated oil BTW,
discussion in the H20 FAQ and on the Corrado list says that the GL
rating does not work like, GL4 better than GL1 and GL5 better than GL4,
etc.  Now I haven't gone over the engineering library and seen if this
is true but people claim it actually indicates what type or wear
additives are in the oil, hence what type of synchro rings it is
compatible with, etc.  If anyone knows the truth on this it would be
nice to know, the root of this is that VW wants GL4 ONLY people say,
in fact one of the biggest synthetic manufacturers REDLINE formulated
MT90 in 75W90 GL4 specifically for FWD VW applications as they already
had a 75W90 Gl5 and GL6 product.  I mention this less people make a
potential mistake in their Buses and Vans, two synthetics are locally
available in most places, Valvolene (sp?) and Mobil 1, both are 75W90
which may be a little light for vans but probably good cold, but one
of them Mobil 1 (I think) is GL4 and GL5 the other is GL5 and GL6,
now I personally would make sure I got the GL4 rated one just for safety
sake, and some people on the Corrado list said even this is suspect as
the oil should be GL4 PERIOD.  Anyway, I'll admit I have been using the
Mobil 1 since last fall in the Corrado and it improved shifting ease
greatly particularly when cold, plus it reduced the incredibly loud
Corrado gear noise somewhat so I have been quite satisfied.  For more
info I urge everyone to consult the H20 FAQ's at lenti.umd_dot_edu, there
is a dated but good discussion on the topic, I think in a file called
trannyoil or somesuch.
