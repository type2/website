&gt; Can a Westy that was not cared for be OK with good

Ed,

I have an 85 Westy andl love it.  Its got its problems, more than you
mention, but not knowing the condition and the rod knock would be my biggest
concerns.  I would say take it back and look for an 86 or later model.  They
had the more desireable 2.1 litre engines and the later the model, the better
the interior features such as power door locks, windows, mirrors, etc....

Good luck,
