Subject:      Re: using vanagon bench seat in a Westy

&gt;&gt;  On our way home we had to access the fridge several
&gt;&gt; times.  No problem, we just opened the sliding door and slid the seat 1/4
&gt;&gt; of the way out.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;errr . . . hopefully, you pulled over to the side of the road first? :-)

No, but with seatbelts on I felt everyone was safe.
