&lt;&lt; I figure the solution might be to add a seat, perhaps removable somehow,
 facing backward directly behind the front passenger seat.

VW thought of this long before you did...
get a rear facing jumpseat out of a junked '87-'91 Wolfsburg edition, or
Carat Van...

also, FYI, the 2 pass middle seat out of a regular 7 pass. van will fit in
your Westy....
