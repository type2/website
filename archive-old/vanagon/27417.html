Subject: RE: Endorsement for Jay's Bugg House

Recently I journeyed to Kansas City to pick up the 84 Vanagon I'd 
purchased there (the Viking Edition).  i couldn't resist the $700.00
price that I negotiated for a Van with no dents and a deluxe interior
with no rips or tears.  Joel - take note as I have two '84 Vanagons 
now, this was not reflected in your last set of statistics.  

At any rate, a fellow listserve member - Jon Christensen - agreed 
to install an engine in the Vanagon, as the original motor was 
partially siezed.  I send down the old engine out of my '84 Vanagon
in Fairbanks that I refurbished with rod bearings, rings, and a set
of reconditioned heads.  I arrived in Kansas City after a short 
hiatus in California to visit daughter #1.  Jon picked me up at the
airport and we drifted over to his house to check out the Van.  It 
needed to be bled, some light bulbs and a few other incidentals 
before I took off for the North.  Unfortunately, neither water temp
gauge nor the gas gauge worked, so I estimated the mileage based on
165,000 miles with my other '84 Vanagon.  Not a great idea, as it 
turned out in retrospect that the fuel pressure regulator was inter-
mittently going off scale (100+ psi) and my gas consumption increased
to between 7-10 mpg.  After running out of gas once in the middle of 
Kansas in the middle of the night (2 1/2 miles from the next service 
station) I stumbled into Colorado Springs.  I knew that I needed 
assistance or I'd never make Fairbanks.  I spotted a bus enroute and
queryed the owner for a good shop.  He signed to follow him and drove
me over to Jay's Bug House.  Jay was sympathetic to my plight and took 
the Viking Edition under his wing.

Jay fixed the engine, blew out and reconnected the cobbled-up exhaust 
system, fixed a fuel tank overflow vent leak, manage to get both gauges
working, replaced a broken wheel stud and in general checked out the 
vehicle from stem to stern.  He worked on the vehicle for two days, 
charged me for only 6 hours and parts and kept me entertained with
tales of his hill climbing days of yore.  You know a shop that has a
double cab powered with a Porsche 911 for a shop truck has to have
their heart in the right place.

Turns out that Jay has about 8 Vanagons. for you wanabes, he will have 
one available soon with a rebuilt engine for around $5,000.  One of the 
vanagons is a right-hand drive with the sliding door on the left and 
middle windows that both open.  Anyway I highly recommend Jay's Bugg
House at 306 Tiajuana Street, Colorado Springs, CO (719) 520-1888.  He
is extremely knowledgable, reasonable, and fair.  I'd appreciate it if 
any of the listserve members in the area could give him a call, tell him 
you saw this post, that I made it to Fairbanks and sure appreciated his
assistance.

On a similar note, what are the chances of posting a list of shops that 
are known for good work throughout the country?
