i have a 68 bus with orig. wwstfalia camper interior
(wood oaneling and headliner). it is a sweet van that has taken me
on numerous long road trips. it has been my rv for
the last 4 years and my everyday driver for 2 before
that. i put a factory rebuilt long block with all
new parts except case in it 20,000 (at the most)
miles ago. body and motor are strong(no floor pan rustthrough!)

i will sell for $1200 or trade for an excellent
restore on the top of my new bettle convertable.

i am in atlanta
