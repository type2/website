Subject: Suspend Mailings - how?

Hate to send this to everyone, but lost the discreet address.
I will be gone from contact the 15th through around the 25th. In that 
time, I can run my allocated message storage right out of its limits and 
having the sysop yelling at me.
How can I suspend the message flow for 10 days?
Jack
