Subject: Re: High altitude starting problem

We lived for many years in Flagstaff, at 7000 feet of elevation.  This was
a common problem for visitors, and we were told at the time that gas is
formulated differently for higher altitudes.  Fill it up with local gas,
and the problem will probably go away.

&gt;My wife just called from Rocky Mountain National Park. (altitude around 
&gt;8,000 feet or higher)  It seems that when she went to start the van ('84) 
&gt;in the morning it died while backing out of the campsite.  She tried to 
&gt;re-start it off and on for about 20 minutes and it finally started when 
&gt;she gave it a lot more gas than normal.  The van has been working fine 
&gt;since.
