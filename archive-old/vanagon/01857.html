Subject: CO adjustment?


Is there any way I can do the CO adjustment myself on my [A] vanagon?
You know, the adjustment under the childproof plug.  I was thinking of 
two possibilities:

  a) Rent/borrow/steal a CO tester.  Anyone know where to go for that?

  b) Buy an oxygen sensor for one of those new fancy FI systems and use
     that to get the &quot;ideal mixture (tm)&quot;.

Any other ideas?
