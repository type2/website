&gt; 
&gt; 	There are three on each front door, two underneath the back
&gt; 	seat/bed, two within the AC compartment above the pullout	
&gt; 	seat/bed and under the pop-top bed (does that make sense?)
&gt; 	and two tweeters -- here goes -- mounted on the metal divider
&gt; 	between the front section (the front seats) and the back...on the 
&gt; 	same plane as the pop top screen that allows access to the luggage
&gt; 	rack....The amp is located behind the glove compartment and the
&gt; 	equalizer (also a Blaupunkt) is the old style movable one attached
&gt; 	to a bendable metal coil - VU meters and all, located underneath 
&gt; 	the driver's seat and projecting out above the parking brake...
&gt; 	_killer_ sounds...! - I'm quite lucky to have come across this 	
&gt; 	already installed.

Where did you say you park this? :-)
