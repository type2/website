Greetings-

When I first bought my 85, the following weekend I had
all kind of starting problems. It started fine, then I drove downtown
(about 10 minutes) and when I tried to start it back up, it wouldn't
start-different symptoms, from not even turning the engine to
turning, but not enoguh. This was in September, on a nice warm day.
Left it, came back later, started right up. Drove home,
wouldn't start. Next morning, went out, started right up, and I drove it to
a repair shop. Seems at some point in its previous history it may
have overheated, and whether it did or not, the electrical
connections to the ignition/computer got burned out, and
when the engine got hot later, the connections would act as if
they were broke. When it cooled back down, the connections would
kick back in again. BAsically he cut the old terminal connectors
off and soldered on new ones, and it has been fine since.

Just another Point of View...
