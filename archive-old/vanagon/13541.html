Subject: Re: Syncro Westie With the Fr...

I had a similiar problem with my 87' syncro at approximately 55,000 miles.
 The problem was with the left rear.  I changed it myself.  Changing the
front is more difficult and requires removing the drive shaft.  One other
interesting note about CVs...  after i replaced the rear one i started having
problems with the two front ones.  It sounded like someone was bouncing a
golf ball off on a cement floor, and usually occured when there was someone
in the front passenger seat.  After replacing all four tires, the original
owner had four different ones on, the problem with the cv joints has not
occured in the past 15,000 miles.  Could having different tires in the front
and rear affect the read of the viscous coupling???
