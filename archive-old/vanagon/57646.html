Subject: 87 Wolfs. Power Door Locks.
Date: Wed, 26 Mar 1997 08:08:24 -0800

I was checking out the VW Dictionary  in the archives &amp; noticed for the
87 1/2 Wolfs. Ed Vanagon under E. Miscellaneous .....   Power door locks
including side door and rear hatch.  I'm the 3rd owner of an 87 Wolfs.
Ed Vanagon &amp; never realized that it should have power door locks.  I
always have to lock the passenger door, side door &amp; rear hatch manually.

1)  What do I have to check to get the Power door locks to work again?

2)  Is it going to cost an arm &amp; a leg to have the dealer get it to
work?
