Well,  I'm back. After taking essentially 2 days to get over
Washington/Rainy Pass, and having to stop much too frequently while out in
Central WA.
The van made it though, I just had to stop and let it cool down a lot!
For those who know the route - this was North Cascades Highway, with two
passes at around 5000 ft, coming back over Stevens Pass which is about 4000
ft.
Edmonds -&gt; Marblemount : 4-5 hours (I left late, 1 stop to cool down)
Marblemount -&gt; Winthrop : 4-5 hours (3 stops to cool down)
Winthrop -&gt; Leavenworth : 2-3 hours (2 stops to cool down)
Leavenworth -&gt; Edmonds : 3 hours (early morning start - no stops!)

In my Volvo 240 (2.3L 4 cyl FI) I've made the Edmonds -&gt; Winthrop trip in
about 4-5 hours, so I'm a little bummed that it takes me twice as long to
get there!

While I didn't have much trouble keeping the head temperature in line
(usually below 450F, always below 550F) I had a lot of trouble with the oil
temp &amp; pressure.  Sometimes it would exceed 250F, although if it stayed up
there for
very long I would eventually shut it down and rest it for awhile. In part I
suspect the hot highways, in part just the amount of climbing I did - it
always shot way up on those inclines! I always kept a watch on the oil
pressure as well, and when it started falling much below 20psi when greater
than 3K RPM this was also my clue to shut the damn thing down!
This is all on Castrol 30W oil.

So now I'm wondering:
- do all air-cooled vans/busses behave this way when confronted by hot dry
weather and/or serious inclines?
Also, does any know what is *the max* oil temperature? I've seen 225F mentioned.
Anyone know what *the min* oil pressure should be? St Muir mentioned that
the engine was designed to operate at 28 psi. Any other info?

When the engine got this hot, I'd look under it and find oil on the right
(passenger side) heat exchanger, and a little bit on the underside of the
tin
on that side. But not really any on the valve cover or around the engine.
It would drip while it was hot, then stop as the engine cooled down.
Haven't figured out where this would be coming from yet. Maybe a valve
cover gasket? head gasket?

Maybe an aftermarket oil cooler isn't such a bad idea on a camper van?
