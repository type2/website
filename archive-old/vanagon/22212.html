Subject: Re: crankcase sealant



Mitch,

St. Muir is about 25 years behind the times when it comes to sealants.
 Permatex will work but it's wise to thin it slightly; it forms a pretty
thick barrier. 

If you want a really drip-free engine you may wish to consider using Loctite
#518 sealant on the crankcase flange.  This is the 'red stuff' I mention in
several posts.  Don't use paper gaskets around the base of the pistons.
 Instead, use Loctite #599, the 'grey stuff.'   Also use the grey stuff on
the washers for the crankcase and cylinder-head studs.  Just a dab will do ya
but make sure the dab forms a continuous bead.

For a dry oil pump installation, coat both sides of the paper gasket with
Hylomar (Loctite #819, the 'blue stuff').  There is a similar product that
comes in a spray can that I can't find at the moment; ask the guy at the
parts place; it's less expensive than Hylomar and works just as well; follow
the instructions on the can (let it get 'tacky' before you use it, and be
sure to spray both sides of the gasket).

To keep the sump from dripping takes a bit more work.  First, make sure
you've got real resin-impregnated gaskets and not that cardboard crap sold in
the cheap 'oil-change' kits; oil weeps right THROUGH those things.  Next,
make sure the sump sealing surface is not pitted. Then use a generous bead of
hylomar on all of the mating surfaces of the gaskets (or the spray stuff, as
above).  If the casting is pitted you'll have to use the gray stuff.  You'll
also have to use the gray stuff if all you can find are the cardboard
gaskets.  And you'll have to coat both sides of the gaskets, a very messy
operation.  The problem with the sump is that you're making up a sandwich of
steel-gasket-aluminum-gasket-magnesium.  With that many different expansion
rates in one stack, nothing is going to maintain a perfect seal for long.
 The gray stuff is an RTV compound.  It not only fills voids, it cures to
form a rubber-like gasket that will conform as the 'sandwich' goes through
its heat cycles.  But be sure to get the sealant on the EDGES of those
cardboard gaskets as well as the flat surfaces.  Because of the small size of
the fasteners and their distance apart, the oil will soak right through the
cardboard.  And over-tightening the nuts only makes the problem worse. 

If you plan to remove the sump plate (ie, if you don't have a full-flow oil
filter), install it with new copper washers and the acorn nuts.  It will weep
oil around the nuts.  But if you have a full-flow oil filter there will be no
need to drop the sump (be sure to use one that has a drain).  In that case,
get some properly sized steel washers and Nyloc nuts.  Install the washers
with gray stuff and there will be no weepage.

All of these sealants must be installed on clean, oil-free surfaces, which is
why you can't use them if you have to drop the sump; it's impossible to get
all the oil off the six little studs without turning the engine upside down.

I still use Permatex #2 on the cam plug, oil pressure sensor and
pipe-threaded oil line fittings.  It seems to perform better under pressure
than the red stuff.  

Tom Wilson's method of dobbing ALL fasteners with gasket shellac definitely
makes for a dryer engine, but also a messier one.  This is what VW appears to
have used, judging by the gobs of sealant you see on stock engines... which
still leaked.   My engines aren't completely dry; the #1 seal weeps a bit (as
all of them do), but they are dryer than most.

Although I've listed a lot of Loctite products there are probably competitive
brands that work equally well; I tend to stick with what works and these
things work better than Permatex #2 for their particular tasks. 

I'll go ahead an make this a general post; there may be some other folks out
there who'd like to get rid of those spots in the driveway :-)
