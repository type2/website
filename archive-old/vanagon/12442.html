Big Orange had cancer just below the bottom edge of the windscreen.
Flakey, crusty spots that pushed the window rubber up a bit. Yeccchh.

I took it to a local VW body shop and had them remove the rust.
They removed the glass and ground down through the rust to shiny
metal.  I think they used lead to 'build up' the areas with where the
rusty parts were excised.  New rubber and glass.  It's been rust-free
for the past 4 years here in Southern Calif.  I think this ran me
about $150, not sure.
