Subject: '88 Power Steering - ATF Dexron ??

I know this one was discussed a few weeks back, along with a good 
procedure for flushing the power steering system, but it was 
mentioned that a special VW fluid was needed. I just checked with the 
local VW dealer and they said standard ATF Dexron is fine. What 
gives? Is the special stuff only for certain years or certain types 
of steering pump/rack? 

My fluid looks clean, and is a nice bright blue colour, but I do get 
some dead spots in the steering, usually at low speeds. I thought 
Dexron was red or purple, so I'm a little unsure about dumping the 
stuff that's in there now.

Also - I'm having trouble finding a GL-4 rated 80w or 80w90 gear oil 
- they all seem to be GL-4/5, or GL-5/6. I've heard that the GL 
rating is important for proper syncro operation. Can someone 
recommend a brand which is known to work well in an '88? I'd prefer 
synthetic, but I'll take what I can find here (BC).

Thx.
Shawn
