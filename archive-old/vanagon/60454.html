Subject: coolant leak/temp (WSilva)

Saw the initial post, and this response.  I think the coolant problems
warrant more than disregarding.  There IS a problem, sounds like the
internal head gasket leak (worst case) or a bad pressure cap (best case)

bye, Tim




&gt; I drove home from there (about 4 miles) and watched the gauge all the way.
&gt; It was in the normal area and the van ran fine.  Do I need to worry about
&gt; this? 

Nope.

 Does this fan just come on when the engine is overheating? 

Yes, I live in Texas, and I only here it on hot days stuck in traffic.

 How do
&gt; you keep from loosing the coolant?

Don't put so much in.
^^^^^^^^^^  what! ???????????????


 Why have I never heard this fan
&gt; before????

You are a Yankee!


Ahem, but aren't you all Yankees?
Time to go cook some back bacon now.
See ya, eh?   A. Canuck
