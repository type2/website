You might try removing the vent terminal and see if there's an
obstruction, such as a spider's nest. This befell me. Another tip is to
remove the drain plug at lower front left and shoot some compressed air in
there with a compressor or tire/ball inflation pump. This may displace
residual products of combustion (?).
