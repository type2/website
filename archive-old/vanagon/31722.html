Yo,

	Well, yesterday I got the new year off to a good start
by adjusting the valves, putting in new plugs, and of course
changing the oil.

	Just for the heck of it, I switched to Castrol DuraBlend,
their semi-synthetic, and switched weights from 20w-50 to 10w-40.
My motor has just over 9,000 miles on it now, and doesn't leak
in any significant quantities.

	The bus runs a lot quieter, and I don't think its from
the valve adjustment, as only a couple valves were off (#1 and #4
exhaust, just a smidgeon tight)  It has more power too, but I
attribute that to the plugs, which had 9k miles on them.

	Anyone care to comment on my choice of oils?

Thom
