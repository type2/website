Subject:       Re: Help on 1776 overheating?

&gt; Your clues are key, I believe.  I think you have a fuel problem.  Especially
&gt; since the engine was fine before.  I've had this happen on engines when I
&gt; used the little silver &quot;pressure regulator&quot; which I'm pretty sure just
&gt; restricts fuel.  Berg clued me into this a little too late.  I could melt
&gt; heat exchangers with this set-up, even though the car drove incredibly well,
&gt; I could do 85 mph in a '63 bus, this was also a 1776 engine.  I just hung,
&gt; like, two huge oil coolers on it and drove at 280 degrees.  Needless to say
&gt; the engine didn't last long.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, put a fuel pressure gauge on that pump, it should be at least three
&gt; psi.  Is the pushrod too short or too long?  Maybe get a new one with a new
&gt; filter and check the lines from the tank that they aren't kinked or
&gt; restrictive in any way.  VW's like fuel, lots of it, whenever it wants.

Thanks for the info!  I remember someone saying that if the engine 
does not get enough fuel it will overheat.

Being a layperson, it sounds odd to me.  What is the rationale?   

It definately could be the problem.  The last fuel pump on there was 
a BIG unit, and this is just a little dinky sized one.

Thanks!
