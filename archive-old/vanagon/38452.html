Subject:       Shaftola again!

A little mid-week non-humor:

I've mentioned it once I think, but a couple of months ago a friend 
discovered a wood-slat roof rack sitting on an old bus by the side of 
a house.

I desparately want a roof rack for the Pioneer, so about two weeks 
ago on a nice saturday afternoon we both got in our busses (he has a 
'64) and drove to the house.

Knowing most VW people are very cool and love to chat, I had high 
hopes to chew a little VW fat for a while and show each other our 
busses, or even better, we'd find a nice old lady who would be more 
than happy to dump the rack, or even the whole bus for cheap.

The tv lit up the blinds and it was apparent that someone was home as 
we approaced the door.  My chest tightened a little as I was slightly 
nervous hoping I'd walk away with a roof rack.

Knock-knock-knock.

No answer.

Ding-dong.

No answer.  Movement in house.

Knock-knock.  Stand patiently.

Very disappointedly give up and start back to the buses.  As we 
discussed our plans of where to go next, I caught out of the corner 
of my eye someone peeking out the blinds.  Having learned my lesson 
previously in past religous proselyting efforts, I chose not to go 
back to the door.

A week passes.  Again I'm at the same friends house, and we decided 
to try again.  We loaded into his bus and headed over.

Knock-knock.

Tough looking cowboy woman answers the door.

&quot;Hi, is that your old cool VW bus back there?&quot;

&quot;Uh, yeah, why?&quot; she says in very defensive, accusitory voice.

&quot;Well, me and my friend and I drive by here all the time and I 
noticed it has been sitting there and hasn't moved, and I was 
wondering if you want to sell the roof rack.&quot;  I felt myself 
nervously say knowing I sounded like a punk creep.

A stern &quot;No.&quot; is the reply.

&quot;Oh....  Umm, well thanks.&quot;

Door shuts.

We leave depressed.

Rich my friend on the way home comes up with another plan to get the 
rack. He suggesed I go down there with 10 $20 bills and hold the 
money out and say &quot;I want your roof-rack.&quot;

I plan to do so in two weeks.

Is $200 outrageous?  The rack is in superb condition!
