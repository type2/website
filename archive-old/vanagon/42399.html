Subject: Busless in Boulder?


Has anybody kept up with that guy in Boulder, the fellow who was living out
of his bus and then it broke down and he couldn't fix it, so he was trying
to sell it? This post doesn't do him any good, I suppose, but I'd sort of
feel better if I knew he was alright. Or not. Seems like we could figure
out what's wrong with the bus and walk him through it one way or another,
maybe...
