Subject: Re: ECI rebuilds

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;I have an 82 Vanagon that needs a rebuilt engine
&gt;
&gt;I have been quoted from ECI for $1249 for a rebuilt or they can rebuild 
&gt;mine for the same price. ECI out of Corona CA. Has anyone ever got a 
&gt;rebuild from them??
&gt;
&gt;Appreciate
&gt;

&gt;82 Vanagon

Give the dealer a try they only list for 1950.00 and they are very nice
