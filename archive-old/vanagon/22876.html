&gt;Message-ID: &lt;30310BE7_at_gismtpgate.gi_dot_com&gt;
&gt;The '70 VW engine in my '71 bus, is drawing the ire of the local
&gt;revenooers-- namely the California Air Resources Board. It's an
&gt;engine from a '70 bus (I believe), with Solex 30PICT-3 cab, vacuum
&gt;advance distributor, standard bus muffler, and at least one leaky
&gt;pushrod tube. Runs great, passed smog test a few months ago (even
&gt;by '71 standards)... but it's illegal according to a law that says
&gt;that a '71 vehicle must have an engine with '71 (or newer) smog
&gt;equipment. For this bus, that MUST include the dual-port heads,
&gt;34PICT carb, stock dual-port manifold-- or CARB approved substitutes,
&gt;The guy who gave it the most recent smog test, was apparently happy
&gt;to see a single carb with SOLEX on it, and no 009 or extractor.
&gt;But repair shops in the area have expressed surprise that I got
&gt;away with this transgression of having a '70 single-port engine
&gt;in a '71 bus.
&gt;Anyone out there have, or know of, a strong-running dual-port engine
&gt;for a creature like this? I'd greatly prefer a &quot;bus-mount&quot; or
vuniversal-case engine-- I don't trust those oil-pump-cover adapter
vplates. It would also be nice if it had the doghouse oil cooler
&gt;and an alternator. Modified large-displacement engines are not
&gt;out of the question... (dream on).
&gt;Would anyone consider a trade? I can transport the engine for most
&gt;parts of Southern CA, and maybe NV or AZ. Hear/see/feel it run!

Hi steve,
First off- I live in the San Francisco Bay area. =

I've got a 71 super beetle that needs some work (I was told that it needs=
 a
new carb).I was going to pull the engine, rebuild it and swap out the eng=
ine
from my 68 camper (which I'm having a hard time getting to  pass smog, si=
nce
it was only recently brought into California). I was then going to have t=
he
body towed away. I would be interested in swapping the bug (engine and al=
l)
for a smog passing bus motor. The bug isn=92t pretty but it has all it=92=
s
mechanical parts. It passed smog the last time we registered it (which wa=
s
year before last). Right now it=92s got a non use waiver registration and=
 it=92s
just sittiung in our drive way.
If you, or any one else would be interested in such a swap, please let me=

know.
I also have a rear bench (Both pieces-not sure which year). It's been lay=
ing
around for a while but it's at least recoverable.

Louis&amp;Lisa&amp;Katya
68 =93ArtCamper=94	Temporary registration - awaiting smog :-(
71 SuperBeetle	Betsy (We either swap her or she becomes an organ donor)
84 BMW 318i	May soon be sold so we can get a 65 or older bus
