&gt; This type of conversion aroused my interest.  Has anyone heard or done a

&gt; to hard to do yourself, and too expensive to have done?

My roommate (at the time) and I swapped a Westy interior from a 77 bus into
his empty 73 van, and it wasn't that big of a deal to do.  We got the whole
sheebang from the junkyard for about $120.  No pop top, though.
