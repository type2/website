Two words, sir:  DUCT TAPE.

That's how I manage to contort the paper/metal-coated hoses into place so 
I have heat.  Works pretty well--though you will have to replace them as 
the tape gets cracked and worn.  Doesn't sound like this will be a 
problem for you if you replace your motor within a year or so.

So you hokies are getting out soon.....same with us &quot;Lobos&quot;; and I 
have a similar bus-fest planned for my off-time.
