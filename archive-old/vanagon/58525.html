&gt;&gt;&gt;Unscrew your door sill and remove the carpet. Peak under the floor boards
and look for large flat plastic domes with Phillips head in them.  Carefully
cut the flooring parallel with the corrugation in the sheet metal with the
domes in it. This is to remove two strips same length as the floor rails you
scrounged.  Take out the plastic screws, bolt down the rails and slide in
your new middle seat.&lt;&lt;


&gt;Second, if peaking under the floorboards means viewing from underneath

GO LOOK INSIDE THE GODDAMN CAR AGAIN, RIP ALL THE FLOORING OUT IF YOU HAVE
TO, BUT GET A GOOD CLEAR LOOK AT THE CORRUGATED TIN FLOORING FOR THE PLASTIC
BOLT HEADS . FUR CRISSAKES, THIS LIST CAN&quot;T HELP YOU IF YOU DON&quot;T WORK AT IT
YOURSELF A BIT.  Tim
