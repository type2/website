Subject: bus colors

Hi 
	Well, it seems I'm getting closer to obtaining a bus, but I
	don't know yet for sure.  At any rate, I am looking at a certain
	bus which has a touch of surface rust on the lower body (under
	the doors, a little on the back, below the engine lid) and so if
	I should obtain this bus I am going to sand and repaint the
	lower body.  The bus is currently all white with brown vinyl
	seats.  I want to leave the top part of the body white (seeing
	as how there's not really any rust there) and paint the bottom a
	different color.  I now appeal to you, the vanagon list members,
	to help pick a color for the bus that Sean may or may not get
	but if he does, it needs a color.  It's good to plan out these
	things :) .  I'm currently thinking of a nice cherry red on the
	bottom half, which would look pretty sharp.  I also saw one once
	that was a really nice gray color and it looked really nice so
	I'm considering that.  I've thought about that famous avocado
	green which I dig but is not one of the top choices.  I think a
	darker green, like hunter green would look nice.  I'm trying to
	picture colors that would go well with the brown interior.  I
	believe the van originally was that hideous brown/beige color.
	Yuck.  Anyway, suggestions would be appreciated.  By the way,
	please do not reply directly to this message.  Use the address
	sbart7kb_at_mwc_dot_edu to send your replies and color suggestions.
	Also, Kelly Barthlow, where are you????  Many things are coming
	together so hopefully you'll contact me SOON.  Anyway, we'll see
	how things go.  I also want it to be known that I haven't bought
	anything yet nor have I committed to.  I'm still shopping
	around.

	Thanks,
	Sean
