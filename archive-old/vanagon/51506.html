Subject: Re: Door Lock Removal?

I just did this -- it's easy.

Well it is for the front doors...

Remove the single Phillips screw just behind the hhandle.  The rear edge
of the door is conveniently shaped for this.  The door handle goes forward,
out, and back to remove.  Inside, the lock cylinder has a two-eared pawl
attached to it.  This is held by a small roll pin that runs in the vertical
plane.  Drive this out with a very small (1/16&quot;) pin punch.  You may need to
insert the key to slide the cylinder out.
