I have just made my first cross-country odessey in my '77 van.  During the
course of the three week, Texas to Washington epic, the van broke down two
or three times, and in Flagstaff, Arizona, I even took it to a garage for
a &quot;tune up&quot; (this was a mistake).  Anyway, the guy was of the opinion that
I was increadibly lucky to have gotten that far, and that there was no way
in hell that I'd make it here to Tacoma.  He said the &quot;valves are just
spinning around man, this f*****'s burnin!&quot;  
Further, he said that I needed &quot;at least a top-end rebuild&quot;, to the tune
of $1200.  I said thanks anyway, and continued on.
When he worked on it, he said the timing was off the scale, and set it
back.  After he did his tune up, the van ran worse than it had been
before, so I checked the gap on the points, and then just turned the
timing back where it had been, and it runs a lot better now.  (If the
timing is &quot;off the scale&quot;, how can it run better than if the timing is set
right?) 
Anyway, the van is not a completely happy creature at the moment.  How
would I go about checking for myself if it needs a rebuild?  The fact is
that it just made a 3000 mile trip with minimal problems (it didn't blow
up, anyway).

I realize that I'm probably destroying my van by driving it if it does
need a rebuild, but I have neither the money nor equipment to do a rebuild
myself. 

In the end, the point of this post is to ask, how does one know if an
engine needs to be rebuilt?

Thank you,
Ben heavner, now of Tacoma Washington (for the next four years, anyway)
