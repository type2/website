&gt;         Hmm. Anybody know about this? I used to run SAE 30 when I lived in
&gt; LA, but after arrival here in Austin I read in bentley that the recomended
&gt; oil for somewhat tropical conditions (seldom goes below 70 in summer, 90+
&gt; during the day) was SAE 40. FLAPS don't got Castrol 40, only no name brand,
&gt; so I am running 20-50. I'll go back to 30 for winter use. Any ideas about
&gt; any of this? Especially from those of you in the &quot;hot&quot; states/localities?
&gt; Thanks in advance.
&gt; 
I have tried Castol 40 following the recommendation of a VW mechanic and
in terms of pressure and oil temperature there was no difference between
it and 20W50. The only noticeable difference was at cold startup - the 40 took
much longer to &quot;run through the system&quot;. I was also told that 30W should
be used at engine break-in (500 miles)...which I followed, then switched to
10w30 (for 1000 miles) then 20w50/5W50 (for 15000+ miles).

With today's quality multigrades why would anyone want to use a single weight
oil?
