Bill Abbott and Bradley M and I have been e-mailing, and have
decided to get together here at my house for a pretour pretour,
if that makes sense.  Anyway, it's to be March 18th for potluck
supper.  Further, some friend's of Bill's are going to the Behring
auto museum in nearby Blackhawk the following morning, so there's
even talk of making this supper, slumber party, breakfast,
lunch, museum. 

Any takers?

As long as there aren't like, uhm, 30 of you, I probably have
space in my driveway and on the residential street for several
people to park.  Alternatively, my living room floor has
seen many slumber party sleeping bags, and as many as can
fit are welcome.  We're in the midst of a kitchen remodel,
but if you can stand it, I can.  :)

rsvp asap,
/m
