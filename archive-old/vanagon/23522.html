Subject: air scoops on splitties

Can anyone prove to me that the scoops that people drill/weld/poprivit
to the sides of their poor splits actually work? I'm (ahem) purchasing
a `67 `weekender' with this modification, and my `66 had them to start
out with, but I just can't see how this would improve air flow, as it
doesn't seem like the air will flow, esp. if your engine compartment
is sealed properly like it should be. (Boy, that's a run-on sentence.)
