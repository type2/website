Subject:      83-85 might be interested: curtains

i was down at calera, al, at a junkyard getting some stuff and was nosing
around some of the vanagons.
inside the 84 bus, i found a set of what looks like factory curtains ... in
that same dark blue as the bus color. two long curtains (for the middle and
rear side windows), one fat short one for the rear hatch, and another short
fat one for behind the front seats (this one had two small tears and was
a little dirty). PLUS a rear hatch mosquito netting!!! (looked like it had
never been used). if you are interested, he said folks should call and haggle
a price (i have no idea what they are worth) ... he put them on top of the
honda starters (so he'll know where to find them again). :)

it's at Graham's Foreign Car Salvage,
(800) 826-6116      (205) 668-1169   (205) 668-0361
ask for Billy Graham III or Jon Graham (no, they are not related to the
preacher by the same name).

in alabama, it's 25 miles south of birmingham, off interstate I-65 (actually,
just off old US highway 31).
970 Hwy 202
Calera, AL 35040
