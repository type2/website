Subject: cops and busses


Since I am new to owning a bus and haven't even had the chance to
drive it around yet, I am curious as to what the attitude of cops have
been for people driving VW busses. Are you picked out and searched
often? Do you sometimes &quot;fit the description of someone&quot; they are
&quot;looking for&quot;? Do they assume you have drugs in the van?

I live in the mecca of VW busses called Santa Cruz, so it might be a
unique place where the cops don't look twice at them. I was watching a
cop driving the other day, trying to see if his head would swing
towards the bus in the other lane. But I soon realized that with the
bus on his right, and the one driving the other direction that there
are just plain too many busses in this area to stick out that much. I
can't drive for 30 minutes without seeing half dozen busses or more,
some pulled off to the side of a quiet country road, some left on road
dead, but many being used as a daily driver. I saw one the other day
with the plate 1DEADRV (or ADEADRV, i forget). God I love CA ;)
