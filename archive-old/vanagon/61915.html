Subject: Oettinger Flat 6's

I have some aquaintainces who have one in a beautifully re-built
'88 Crew Cab here in Australia.It is used for towing a large boat.
Fits neatly in the engine bay and is very impressive in terms of it's
power and low down torque.

They were lucky,got it from a Camper at an auto wreckers who didn't
realize the value of these things (sounds like an urban myth but I
kid you not!)Not sure how it came to be there however.
These guys have a VW restoration/repair business and are also one of the
local agents for all the Oettinger stuff like high performance chips for
WBXs,T4s,Golfs and Polos.They have also done the training for this 
technology in the Fatherland so they know their trade.

All Oettinger gear is good quality but very expensive.According to them,
an Oettinger 6cyl WBX costs about DM45,000 ...Gott im Himmel!!!
Go do a conversion into $US then scrape out your trousers.

Oettinger also do a 2.5 litre conversion for 2.1l WBXs which is very good
but that aint cheap either.I think it's about $8,000 Aus,but they're out
there as I see them sometimes.Wish I had that sort of money....

Cheers,
