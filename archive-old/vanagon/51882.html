Subject: Re: need to &quot;See the light&quot;

Joel Walker said the following in reply to the issue of instrument 
panel lighting (much is snipped here for brevity):
&gt; 
&gt; i don't recall if there was a light on the gearshift or not ... :(
&gt; 
Actually, if you remove the &quot;PRND21&quot; cover from the automatic 
transmission shift console, you'll find two tiny, tiny lamps that 
move with the shifter.

Mine are also blown out, and I'd sure like to know whether or not they're 
removable, since I'm sorta reluctant to apply overwhelming force to 
these fragile little bulbs without someone telling me that I'm not 
going to &quot;break the transmission&quot; by doing it.
