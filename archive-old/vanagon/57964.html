One more time.... &lt;grin&gt;

The Rialta is not the Eurovan Camper.  The Rialta is the $45K to $55K 
beastie sold by Winnebago dealers.  Parcel delivery box looking thingie 
put on the chassis and cab of an EV.

Eurovan Camper is the $35k beastie based on a van shaped extended Eurovan 
sold by VW dealers.

&gt; 	I recall the sticker one the 97 EVs at Autohaus in Lancaster, PA to
&gt; more like $35K, maybe a few more.  $55K or $45K are both absurd.
