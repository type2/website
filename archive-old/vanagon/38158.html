Subject: SW BUG-IN II (Phx,AZ - Sunday)

Anyone who is in the Phoenix area this weekend  is invited to attend a VW
swap and show.
WHEN: Sunday 3/24/96  (07:00-14:00hrs) figure it out
WHERE: 15th Avenue and Thomas Rd./ Phoenix College Parking Lot
COST: $1.00 whole US Dollar and /or a can of non-perishable food. Swap
spaces and Car show entry fees are something like $12-15.
WHY: To benefit St. Mary's Food Bank and to clean out everyone's garages.
WHAT-UP?:  Although last week's swap by the Az VW Club was a bust (Due to
lack of promotion me suspects)  this one is expected to be better/as well
attended than the upcoming Phoenix Bug-O-Rama.  The SW Bug-In I which was
held in October was a huge success.

Look for the tattered single cab with the canvas top! Stop by and say hello
to or take shots at Rusty VanBondo (whatever the case may be). 

FURTHER INFO: Jerry/Melissa  Jess  (602) 867-7672  tell 'em VanBondo said to
attend!
