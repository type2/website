Subject: re:  VWoA warranty - any recent experience?

Yesterday was the day I took the EV (26K) in for the &quot;warranty repairs&quot;.  
I asked about the EV window recall mentioned here, and they said there 
wasn't one (only for Passat).  Apparently they took the door apart, did 
some adjustments and lubed it, and it seems OK.  They said they couldn't 
hear the speedo noise, as I expected 'cause it's intermittent, but they 
would replace it for about 50% off the $300 estimate, not 80%.  The other 
few things they took care of with labor, but I had to pay the whole thing.
I thought materials *and* labor were covered.  I better get the Bentley SOON!

&gt;I just had my 93 EV in for replacement of the instrument cluster voltage
&gt;stabilizer. I had 28K on the odo.  I paid $7 + change, or 20% of the total
&gt;charge.  The service manager referred to it as VWoA &quot;good will&quot;.  Whatever
&gt;it is, it's OK by me -- many other brands you pay 100% after expiration of
&gt;warranty.

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;My 93 EV is coming up on the 2 year expiration of the date it
&gt;&gt;was &quot;put into service&quot; (as VW says).  I have until the end of October 
&gt;&gt;to get all my nit-picky things taken care of - or so I thought.  I
&gt;&gt;suddenly remembered that the warranty is 2 years or 24K miles, whichever
&gt;&gt;comes first, and I've just hit 26.2K.  What a sickening feeling.  Besides 
&gt;&gt;being mad at myself for spacing on the miles, I'm not too happy with the
&gt;2 dealers I've called 'cause they're not cutting me much slack.  They're
&gt;&gt;both giving me the same line : &quot;bring it in, we'll look at what needs work, 
&gt;&gt;then see what percentage VW will pay.  And by the way, don't put any more
&gt;&gt;miles on it, or the percentage VW *might* pay will go down.&quot;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Anybody been through something like this?  Is there a &quot;percentage they'll
&gt;&gt;pay formula&quot; anyone knows the details of?  They're being very vague.
