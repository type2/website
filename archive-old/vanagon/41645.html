Subject: Auxiliary A/C?

Has anyone ever put an auxiliary air conditioner on there Westfalia?
I was checking around a couple of years ago about it.  Since I would NOT
want to put it on the roof because of garage height, it was suggested that
I either put it in the front luggage rack cavity or put a window unit
in the rear drivers side window, in front of closet.  I am seriously
considering getting an air conditioner so I can sleep comfortably this
summer.  Thank you for any help.
