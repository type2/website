Subject: Re: westy H2O-tank key?, oil lev

I called delta six industries on the phone and told them I needed about ten
spare keys in case I lost some and they sent me five for free in the mail!

The oil level in your van should be kept at the minimum mark, not the maximum
mark, since the oil temperature at the minimum mark is much lower.

You get the cup holder at an RV store--any rv store. Just be sure to get the
slightly larger size or most coffee cups won't fit in it well--only cans will
fit unless you are careful on this one. I put in two on each of the front two
doors, and two more for the rear passenngers.
