Subject: Rebuild Calipers?

OK, 25-point tossup question here (am I dating myself?)

Awhile back, I picked up a front disk caliper rebuild kit,
since the rubber in mine is  more or less non-existant. St. John
makes no mention of the job, and Clymer mentions blowing the
pistons out with compressed air, and don't screw up or you'll  
never get the thing back together again (slight gloss on my 
part ;-&gt;).  The recent thread on rebuilding clutch cylinders
brought this to mind.  Am I best off scheduling some down time
and take the calipers to someone, or does someone have a 
reassuring shade-tree procedure for this?

TIA and Cheers!
