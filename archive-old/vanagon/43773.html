Subject: The !New! Bungee bus (was:Type 2 Engine Mount)


&gt;&gt;I don't like the idea of adding stress at the oil pump. Just doesn't seem
&gt;&gt;natural.
&gt;
&gt;It's just not the way God intended engine mounting to be!!  No one has
&gt;mentioned the possibility of bungee cords yet--with enough bungee cords a
&gt;man (or woman) could rule the world [Warning: this was a joke--don't try
&gt;ruling the world with bungee cords or securing an engine with them...]


Wonder what the properties of bungee cords are, in the transmission of
torque from clutch plate to tranny input shaft. This may be the Divine
Inspiration needed to get the V6anagon to stay on speaking terms with
its clutch for more than the usual 6 months...
