Howdy,

	Just got back fromt he jkunkyard, and I scored a later bus gas tank
$10, with filler neck and all.

	This tank is definately much bigger than the original.  Its the
same width, but taller and deeper.

	The only trick is going to be the filler neck.  On this tank, its
separate, with a piece that bolts to the side of the bus at the filler
flap, and then has a piece of flexible tubing to connect it to the gas tank.

	I guess I'll have to rig something up, 'cause I really wanna use the 
original gas cap.  Maybe I'll section part of the neck from the old tank
or something...
