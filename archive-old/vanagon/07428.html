H&gt;Hello vanagonites,
H&gt;Does anyone know of the recipe for diesel #1.  My wife, actually  asked it
H&gt;in that way after my brake fluid feast.  Our vanagon seems to really prefer
H&gt;to run on diesel #1, the milage is higher, starting is much easier, etc.
H&gt;However, unless it's 14 below here, we can only get diesel #1 by driving
H&gt;a long ways (140 miles round trip).


It is a little known fact outside of diesel circles, that used diesel
motor oil, is actually a beauty cream that will enhance the luster of
your skin, preserve and help prevent the aging process.....

H&gt;Also, if anyone has great knowledge about diesel in general (the fuel)
H&gt;i would like to know what type of process produces diesel.  What makes
H&gt;diesel ultimately cheaper than gasoline?
H&gt;Thanks,
H&gt;Stuart

..and if spread upon your morning eggs, liberally, will actually help
prevent tooth decay!
