&gt;Subject: The Weekly Car Talk Opinion Poll
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Welcome to the first edition of...
&gt;
&gt;THE WEEKLY CAR TALK OPINION POLL
&gt;&quot;Profound insights into the burning issues of our time&quot;
&gt;
&gt;Created by Paul Murky of Murky Research, Inc.
&gt;Funded by no one yet. Are you interested? Send money!
&gt;
&gt;This Week's Car Talk Opinion Poll Question:
&gt;
&gt;       Should a 16-year-old kid own his or her own car?
&gt;
&gt;America is dying to know!
&gt;
&gt;To answer this week's question, or to suggest a question of your own, hurry
&gt;up and scoot your little browser over to:
&gt;
http://cartalk.msn_dot_com/Poll/index.html
&gt;
&gt;Quick-- while the boss isn't looking!  Results of this week's poll will be
&gt;released Friday morning, at the same address.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks for killing a few moments to share your opinion on this matter of
&gt;tremendous import to all of us. Remember--every vote counts. (Okay, not for
&gt;much. But it does.)
&gt;
&gt;See you next week,
&gt;

OK, OK, OK - the VW/Vanagon content is/was an absolutely hilarious account
of a lady who pranged her Vanagon in a parking lot backup maneuver &amp; was
asking the bro's how she could avoid trouble with her SO ....Hey, at least
she wasn't asking how come it ran so crappy &amp; leaked coolant!!!

In the SF Bay area the boys can be heard on fm 88.5 on sat's &amp; sun's _at_
10:05 am; the saturday show is a repeat of the previous sunday's program
(or check your local NPR station to see if/when they carry it).

No, I don't work for NPR or CarTalk (wish I did, tho)
