Sign me up for your list first-aid group.  I know many decent mechanics
(and a few of the other kind) here in Minneapolis.  It sounds like a decent
idea to me.

&gt; I think it would be a good idea if list members submitted their names to
a &quot;traveler's assistance&quot; list.
&gt; For example I would be willing to point the way (for a fellow list member
who was traveling in the DC
&gt; area and had problem)  to a mechanic for repairs.  Now I know it's pretty
easy to look in the phone
&gt; book but I've had some experience here.  I am not good mechanically so I
would not be able to help
&gt; inthe repairs.  But if it was Sunday night I would be willing to provide
a port in the storm, a shoulder
&gt; to complain to, a place to have a beer.  I would keep a hard copy of this
list in my van.
