Subject: Are Michelan MX4s comparable to MXLs?

&gt;I was calling around to see about getting new tires. Seems MXLs have been
&gt;dicontinued according to my sources. MX4s are supposed to be the
&gt;replacement tire. Anyone put MX4s on and like em? Peace,

MXL's and MXL's with Reinforced Sidewall are not the same.  I did a lot
of &quot;calling around&quot;  and found many tire dealers to be clueless when I asked
about a &quot;Reinforced Sidewall&quot;.  If you go by size and max weight, passenger
car tires (non-reinforced sidewall) will just make it against the gross
vehicle weight.  Clueless tire dealers will try to convince you that the
tire they have for you (not reinforced, of course) is fine.

In all my callings, I never heard of a MX4 with reinforced sidewall.
