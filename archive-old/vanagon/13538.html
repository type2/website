Subject: Re: Reinforced Sidewalls and EuroVans...

        Ric -
The original tyres (like the spelling?) on my Transporter were 'van tyres' with
the strong side walls.  However, when I put on the cooo-el alloys, I went up to 
205s from 185s.  The tyres I chose were Hankook (yukky, I know, but I am not 
wealthy enough for Goodyears, Michelins, et al.)

They were CAR tyres.

Now I've got Marchal (Marshal?) Power Pace on the rears - soft and grippy -
and they were excellent on front but wore *extremely* quickly.  On the fronts
now I've a pair of Nankangs which are total ****.  They are very hard-wearing
alright, but their grip in the wet is very suspect.  (Check my posts of last
Dec.
20th for confirmation...)

The gist (a lovely Irish term) of this is that the thinner sidewalls have
not impared
the safety of the vehicle or, indeed, the handling.  On the other hand, the
quality
of the tread is ALL important.

Oh, my tyre vendor warned me not to fully load the 'van - keep it under the
tonne.

        Norman -
I've got 14&quot; alloys on my beastie.  I'd love to get the 16&quot; ones in the
catalogue. (Drool...)

        All EV drivers -
Do any of you notice uneven wear?  I'd like to know.

&gt;Ok, here's the dilemma...the tires on the EV are about kaput...they
&gt;were $hit to begin with...Contis...they cracked early...they wore
&gt;funny. Unfortunately the only &quot;stock&quot; replacement tires I can seem
&gt;to get for the EV without having to mortgage the house and wait
&gt;for tires to come from Yurrup are Contis thru my VW dealer...YEEECH!
&gt;
&gt;A couple of you have stock Michelin MXLs on your EVs...unfortunately
&gt;they are scarce hereabouts and $$$$$$!!! My tire dealer suggested
&gt;Michelin MV4s and another Michelin tire in the 205/65/15 size, both
&gt;4 season tires (which I like). The problem is that they don't have 
&gt;reinforced sidewalls....
