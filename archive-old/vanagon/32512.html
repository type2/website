Subject: Re: Second battery solution?

Can these be happily recharged by your alternator? Anything about them that would make them unhappy in an automotive application?

&gt;Sorry to keep going on and on about this, but I may have found a nice
&gt;solution to my second battery search, and I wanted to run it by the
&gt;collective wisdom of the Vanagonners...
&gt;
&gt;There is a 12-volt deep-cycle gel-cell battery designed for wheelchairs that is
&gt;5&quot;w x 7&quot;l x 6.5&quot;h.  It's a 12 volt battery with 32 amp-hours reserve.  Cost
&gt;is around $80.
&gt;
&gt;The cool thing is that *two* of these would fit nicely beneath the drivers'
&gt;seat on my 1990 Vanagon (12&quot;x7&quot;x7&quot;h).
&gt;
&gt;My question is, does this make sense?  Would they deliver enough power to be
&gt;worth the effort?  (I want to run a laptop with a draw of 1.5A, as well as
&gt;the lights in the van.)
