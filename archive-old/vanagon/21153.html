&gt;Has anyone on the list ever heard of a flower vase that originally came
&gt;with VW buses (set on the dash)? What would originals be worth? My nephew
&gt;swears there was such a thing, but I've never heard of it.

Yes, those are the Blumenvasen. I remember as a kid in Germany, my
grand-father had one in his '69 Mercedes Diesel. I believe it's a typically
German thing, that romanticism and pantheism as in: &quot;blau, blau, blau,
blueht der Enzian...&quot; On Sundays, we would take picnic trips &quot;in den Harz&quot;
or &quot;in die Heide&quot; (pretty parts of Lower Saxony); my gramps would pick a
few flowers while warming up his Diesel, stick them in the vase, open the
sunroof and light a fat cigar and off we went: &quot;Ach, die frische
Naturluft,&quot; he would say as we were engulfed in the heart warming mix of
diesel and cigar fumes...

The Bus Stop has them if you want to reexperience the German Aufschwung :)
