There's a guy with a web page who installed a water cooled toyota motor
into a breadloaf westy. It's painted like a cow, pretty wild. I can't
remember the url but he goes into some detail of the transplant on his
page.

Hope this helps,

tony

&gt; 
&gt; I was just curious if anyone has ever turned an air cooled vanagon into a
&gt; water-cooled one.  I never hear much on the subject so I imagine it is
either
&gt; next to impossible or very expensive.  I have an 81 Westy and I am always
&gt; thinking about this.  It is one of those things I would probably never
do,
&gt; but that doesn't stop me wondering about this.  The talk about installing
&gt;  suburu engines in the vanagon is what really sparked my curiosity.  I am
new
&gt; to the list and vanagons, so forgive me if this is a dumb question.
