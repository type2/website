Subject:      2.1L in an '85?

Hi Volks,

I'll be getting the '85 Westy from Lon Herman today to begin resto. I have
a line on a 2.1L and was curious if it would work with the '85's auto
tranny. Any other differences I should be aware of? I know the 2.1L uses
the Digifant FI (way to familiar with that set-up!) and I believe the '85
used a Digijet like on my old '83.5. I'm assuming I would just carry all
the Digifant stuff over to the '85? Any other details. Didn't Jim at
Sherwood recently do all this? Guess I should have been reading all the
posts :-)

I know everyone has been talking of the Subaru/Kennedy conversions of late,
but I don't think I can afford that. Unless it could all be done for around
a grand.

Thanks to eveyone who has inquired about the '86 currently for sale, guess
I need to post a price.

&gt; &lt;&lt;   I am interested in installing a Weekender-style pull out bed.  Is
this
&gt;  possible (the van is a 84) ?  Are the fittings the same for the normal
seat
&gt;  and the puul-out seat ?  Has anyone done this ?
&gt;
&gt;      The rear bumper is missing, and I was quoted &gt; $800 for a new one.
Will
&gt; I
&gt;  have trouble finding a good bumper at the junk yard, and how involved is
it
&gt; to
&gt;  replace this ? &gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; yes, you can put a weekender interior into a pre 85 van (BTDT, and BTW
I've
&gt; got 2 weekender interiors for sale.. anyone interested?)
&gt; and as far as the 800 for a back bumper..... YEAH, RIGHT!!!   whoever
told
&gt; you that was really yankin your chain....
&gt; You can get NEW ones for about 100......
