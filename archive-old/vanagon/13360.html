i don't think so ... i think it's a preventative goop only.

&gt;want to use something that will act with the rust to form a seal, so I don't
&gt;have to try and peel, sand the current rust down (in some parts the pipes
&gt;are pretty rusted.) A while ago I used some spray on my GTI that somehow
&gt;reacted to the rust and formed a seal, but I cannot remeber what it was or
&gt;if it worked. ( Is old the car a month after I fixed all the rust with the
&gt;stuff) I seem to remember that it was a spray in a black can.)

3M makes some stuff called Rust Arrestor (? i think that's what they call it).
and Naval Jelly (pink stuff in a plastic bottle, at wal-mart and k-mart) works
well.

BUT!! none of the rust-stoppers work well if the rust is &quot;deep&quot; ... i.e., you
are supposed to remove as much of the rusted metal as possible, and on your
pipes, that might be unsafe (cause leaks). the later model water-cools have
large plastic pipes under there ... you might want to gird your loins and
call a few dealers to see what replacing your rusty steel with plastic would
cost. :(
