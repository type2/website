Subject: RE: conduit for your bus?

Where to run the wires.  I ran the bundle right down the center underneath
the van, over the tank alongside the shift rod, up behind the grill to
the driver's side, where there were two extra holes, with rubber grommets,
so I didn't have to drill to get the wires from outside to inside.
