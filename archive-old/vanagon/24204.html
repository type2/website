Shoulda, woulda, coulda... it's all crap.  I'm sure a VW thing would 
drive better, and resist rolling if only it _was_ a Porsche.  But it's 
not, it's a vehicle with extra ground clearance, and that requires that 
it's higher off the ground, and that means a higher CG.

I'm positive my bus would be more stable if I lowered it about 5 inches, 
moved the drivers seat aft of the front wheels, and cut the roof down 
about 2 feet.  Kinda like a Porsche really.  :)
