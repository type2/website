Subject: 6cyl Vanagon Update

A quick update since several on both lists (Porschephiles, Vanagon list) have
aided and abetted:

My 81 Vanagon is back on the road, now with 2.7 liters rather than 2.2 (still
with the 2.2's Zeniths tho', while I get the CIS FI organized).  Half a liter
is a noticeable difference.  In a sense the bigger breakthru is using the 
stock Porsche muffler.  This time I hung the engine about 2.5 inches lower,
at which height the Porsche muffler does fit.  With the six at the VW engine's
height the Porsche muffler would not fit, and no aftermarket solution I found
was at all satisfactory.  Now the engine is low (muffler 9+ in. from the
ground, 1.5 inches lower than it is in a Targa) but no problems in one after-
noon's test drives.

The 2.2 liter engine is excess to my needs now -- I would even listen to offers
on the 2.7 if someone wanted that market-forsaken size instead.  Email me
direct if you have a 914-4 or a bus or Vanagon that is waiting for this step
up.
