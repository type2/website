&gt; I'm real interested in hearing what others of you did to get better sound
&gt; and what brand names you recommend.

I just put a set of Blaupunkt 5 1/4 speakers in my scirocco -  they sound
great with only a limited amount of power.  Plenty loud enough - even without
an additional amp.  Just to give you an idea of my standards (I know people
who think the stuff that comes with a car sounds good),  I have $700 Bose
speakers in my house.  These speakers sound supprisingly good.  Especially
considering the price ($50 at Costco).  They fit (with a leeetle cutting) in
the door of my '80 scirocco.  I think that you should have no problems getting
them into the door of a vanagon - more room there.  Depth is not a problem.
If you want, I can post the model number tomorrow.
