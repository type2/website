Subject: '85 Temp. &quot;Warning Light of Doom&quot; - Question

Is/are there more than one source of input for the infamous &quot;warning light
of doom&quot; in the center of the water temp gauge?

I am under the impression that it is a single source of input -- that of the
coolant &quot;float&quot; in the main coolant tank.  If that's the case, mine needs
replacing, since it has gone into &quot;flash--pull over now&quot; mode without other
provocation twice in the past week.  I then religiously check the level of
coolant in the main and recovery tanks (both OK), and even check the
radiator bleed screw (no bubbles).  After I start up again, the light is gone.

If there is another source for the flashing light, it would be extremely
helpful to know it, so that I could trace it back...

As always, thanks in advance!
