Subject: Bus Sightings...

In this mornings Washtington Post, there is a wonderful picture
of a tow truck in a snow storm. Hooked to the back of the tow
truck is the worlds most famous VW Camper, used as the 'waiting
room' of a one Dr. Kevorkian.

He used said Bus again, and has been arrested. The Bus was getting
impounded, and might be there a while. (Well, after a 'quick' and
'speedy' trial). 'Death by carbon monoxide poisoining' was
the treatment for the good Doctors patient.

Morbidly enough, this might be a great chance to pick up a 
real piece of history at a police auction in the near future.
