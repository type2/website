Subject:  Re: FOR-SALE: 2 VW's/New Orleans

&gt;: Not to mention the fact that almost any *brand new* car is better than
&gt;: most 13-year old any-car.  Let's see how those Frauds (er... Fords) are
&gt;: doing in just *10* years...

        yep. I had an '84 Ford LTD wagon for about a year ('93-'94). Junk.
When it rained, spent $750 for a new computer brain. Engine died about 2
months later. Don't even want to *think* about the cost of a new engine.
Had the bus for about 2 years now, and the same engine came from my old
rusted out ghia before that. Still runs. Had to buy a generator for $40.
Brain-$750, Generator-$40. You do the math. ;-)

Peace,
