Subject: King Of The Van Heap

The problem with this question is that it could cause some people to
proclaim that their year/model of van is King Of The Van Heap, thereby
introducing a no-win situation into the Vanagon list. I remember a horrible
thread I started back in early summer saying that some VW vans were true
vans and that some VW vans were not as good and the thread went on for *a
month* and nothing got resolved. 

So, so...perhaps someone who doesn't have a stake in a particular model year
or type of VW van can tell this guy which is the King Of The Van Heap. Those
of us with an obvious stake in a particular model year have difficulty
wanting to get pulled into this, partly because they cannot, ultimately, be
objective, and partly because they may not want to come off as pushy or
egotistical. 

This has prevented me from trying to correct that horrible FAQ on VW Vans
carried in the REC.AUTOS.VW archive too, by the way, which seems ok but sort
of peters out in the 1985 model year.

On second thought, perhaps nobody should answer him on the list. Answer him
by privzate e-mail.

&gt;Along this thread, perhaps I could get a few opinions from the list.  I've
&gt;been saving my money for five years now, hoping to get a VW Camper.  I'm
&gt;currently trying to decide whether I want to go cheap and look for a used
&gt;camper in great condition, or be patient and await to see what '96 brings.
&gt;
&gt;Though I think that the older busses are beautiful, I'm not a mechanic, so I
&gt;think I will shy away from buying one of those.  I'd prefer something that
&gt;doesn't require lots of technical maintenance.
&gt;
&gt;If y'all had $30,000 to spend, what camper would get get?  A late-model
&gt;syncro?  A late-model non-syncro?  An earlier camper? Or should I wait?
