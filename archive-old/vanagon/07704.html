	Tracey,
	On Type IVs there's a thermostat on the bottom of the engine
that drives a couple of flaps at the top to control the flow of
cooling air. I think your 72 has an 'upright' Type II motor, which
may or may not differ from a Type I. I just bought the Bay Window/Breadloaf/
68-79 Bus Bentley book and I'll look-up thermostats tonight.

	Thermostats are popularly left off aircooled engines by 
silly people who assume that more cooling is always better- which makes
it hard for the engine to warm up, blah, blah.

	My 914 came without a thermostat and I installed one, but
I can't say I noticed any difference. It just made me feel better :-)

	Bill
