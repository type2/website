Subject: conversions

I asked this question last week, and due to something I was 
unsubscribed.  So let's try it again.  Has anyone had or know of the 
costs and pains of converting a bus (esp 71 and before) to a westy 
camper, either one that's already a camper to a pop-top, or a transporter 
to a camper?  Can some of the work be done at home or must all of it be 
done at a shop?
