This past year I have been rear ended twice in my '86 GL  on the freeway here in
Dallas, TX. -yes tail/brk lights are working- ;) I have been very pleased with
the cash performance of the van. With relatively hard hits the damage was only
cosmetic. The second hit was an uninsured in a Chevy Blazer who pushed me
-wheels locked- about 30 feet into a stopped truck in front of me. The impact
mashed the bumpers, buckled the rear panel below the tailgate and destroyed my
driving lights but only minor damage to the front sub-bumper. Wearing your
seatbelt is obviously _very_ important!

Commercial 1: All Import Auto Parts (salvage yard)(817-654-0719) in Dallas,TX
has about 12 Vanagons and 1 burned EV in the yard. I bought a slightly damaged
rear bumper for $40.

Commercial 2: The Bumper Mart (214-263-3676) in Dallas, TX. straightened and
rechromed my front(normally just polished aluminum) and rear bumpers for $135
each. An absolute perfect job. Amazing job actually.
