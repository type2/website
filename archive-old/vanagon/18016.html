Hello VWers,

Does anybody have a schecmatics or literature about Boach's AFC Fuel Injector
system for 80 vanagons? I have the unit out and doing a bench testing on it.
I have the Bentley manual, I need further detail. Just the schematics of the
Fuel Inj Control unit faxed to me would be of great help.

Regards,
Vahid
