Ideally, no.  In actuality (at least in the Mustang) there is nothing that
pulls the t/o bearing off of the pressure plate when the pedal is not
depressed, and it tends to rest against the pressure plate and turn, without
being under any real load.

&gt; When the clutch pedal is depressed, it puts tension on the clutch cable, which
&gt; in turn, pulls the lever attached to the T/O bearing forks, which, in turn, 
&gt; presses the T/O bearing against the pressure plate ring (or fingers), thus 
&gt; releasing the clutch disk....  When the clutch is disengaged in a TI/TII, the 
&gt; T/O bearing does not spin as it is hanging on a set of forks and does not 
&gt; engage the output shaft from the tranny.  It is entirely possible that the 
&gt; Mustang T/O bearing spins w/ the output shaft, unlike VWs, thus creating the 
&gt; bearing noise you had to repair in your Mustang.   

No, the t/o doesn't spin with the output shaft in the Mustang.  The two
setups are very similar.  As you know, the t/o bearing really has little 
to do with the tranny output shaft, except that the output shaft happens to
pass through it.  And I haven't repaired the Mustang yet, because I don't
feel like dropping the transmission again, having just done it a few months
ago.  

&gt; I've been wrenching on these puppies (TI/TII) for over 25 years and have NEVER
&gt; heard a T/O bearing make noise without having pressure applied to it via the 
&gt; clutch pedal.  I have, however, had a number of trannies that have final 
&gt; drive/input carrier bearing noise as they get worn.... 

Well doggone, then you must be right, and I must be wrong.  Okay everyone,
let it be known that if you hear a squeaking noise, and it goes away when
you press in the clutch, it is *not* the throwout bearing!!!  :)

Seriously Jon, I'm not trying to discredit your years of experience with
VWs, but give me a little credit too.  I'll say it one more time - &quot;I am only
trying to suggest *another possible cause* for the noise.  I am not saying
that it is not the carrier bearing!&quot;.
