Subject: Ron's Parts, 1.9 Diesel Engines, etc.

Sorry, a couple of people requested a number for Ron's Parts, BC, and 
I lost their addresses as I wanted to call and verify it was Ron's 
who sells these things.  It is.  The 1.9 diesel is about $1850 with 
the D Port head or $1950 with the standard 1.6 head (which must 
apparently be harder to get in good shape) both hydraulic lifter I 
assume but forgot to ask.  Why for would you want the 1.6 head, well 
it seems that you must of course match your intake manifold to the 
head, which will require welding and porting of your stock manifold 
or simply in a Golf/Jetta will require a later manifold.  The block 
is like 10mm taller FWIW which should not hurt in a Vanagon.  Other 
thinks include an acessory kit you must buy to the tune of $175 
including flanges, mounts, etc, and OOOF, a $300 vacuum pump as the 
vacuum pump drive changed entirely and is no longer the standard 
distributor drive.  So say about $2500 like I guestimated for 78 or 
so horses, your 1.6 injection pump being in OK shape.  He says people 
have done it, it is a nice conversion.   Or for the slightly more 
daring, a guy is trying to sell through them a 10,000 km used 1.9 
TURBO diesel, everything included, end to end (turbo injection pump 
$$$, turbo, pipes, etc) out of a Golf for $4k, should afford 100 
honest hp and likely the INCREASED mileage typical of pressurized 
diesels, now short of TDI, THATS A CONVERSION, could you imagine 
maybe 35 mpg, and the ability to blow off a Wasserboxer!!!  Would be 
worth working out the piping for vanagon use.

Anyway they are at
