&gt;Hey all,

BTW: michael heron was extremely nice to turn me onto one of these babies
earlier in the Spring. The one that michael sent is in fair shape but needs
a little attention. If I can't find one in better shape I'll try to
delaminate some of the pinish wood formica and reglue it to the proper
particle board/wood. Thanks again to micheal, tim and everyone for listening
to my endless requests for this petty but neat item. The truth is that life
will go on if I never find one nicer than what I have. Thanks again!

&gt;tim the table you are referring to is not the spicerack. the spicerack that
&gt;a 65' camper is vastly different from the pull out table that is used on
&gt;the side of a coldbox for a 1971 Campmobile. the spicerack for the 65' was
&gt;desigend to fit on the rear cargo door of the split, it remains stationary
&gt;on the rear cargo door. The rack that tim is referring to (the one i think
&gt;he is referring to) is designed to fit on the side of the coldbox and
&gt;pullout (not remain stationary). the two &quot;racks&quot; is two vastly different
&gt;beasts!!

&gt;
&gt;out &gt;&gt;&gt;Just for the fun of it ask if he has a spicerack/L shaped whatnot
cabinet
&gt;&gt;&gt;for a 65-71 westy camper. It has gotten to be my standing joke but I still
&gt;&gt;Ok, will do. Is this spice rack the little side cabinet with the flip-up
&gt;&gt;table top that used to be bolted to the rear facing seat by the sliding
&gt;&gt;door.? Good for making sandwiches while standing outside. I have one with
&gt;&gt;table, one without if so. I'm fond of them, very convenient units to mount
&gt;&gt;anywhwere.  tim s.
