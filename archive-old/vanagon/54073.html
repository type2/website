Subject: Syncro: miles/gal trip log

FYI here are the gas consumption results from our Christmas trip to Tom
Forhan and south through the mountains of Giorgia, Tennessee, Alabama
and West Virginia. 

I tended to travel at 100 to 100 km/hour (63 to 70 miles/hr) on the
interstates, 90 to 100 (56 to 63 miles/hr) on rural roads and 50 to 80
(31 to 50 miles/hr) in the mountains (uphill 2nd and 3rd gear). I have
not found any correlation with the route or terrain we covered.

I used only high octane unleaded gasoline (92 to 94 octane) and added
injector cleaner/gasline antifreeze three times along the way (I don't
trust octane boosters).
