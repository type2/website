Subject:      Re: price check on 85 westie

In my searching through local Boston papers I have not seen an '85 Westfalia
for as low as $2,000.  For that price I have seen much older ones.  Have I
been looking in the wrong (high roller) places?   I entered some data into
Kelly Blue Book, using a Brunswick, Maine zip code (had to choose some nice
place in Maine!) and came up with a cost of $7850.  Jim McCarthy, '87 Westy,

&gt;&lt;&lt; In all, $6200 is a pretty good price for a vehicle that can drive you

&gt; Good luck.

&gt;depends on where you are....west coast prices are higher than east coast
&gt;prices....
&gt;in the northeast, a '85 westy GL in nice shape can be had for around $2000
