Subject: country decals


Other than taking a LONG trip, does anyone know where I can get
those decals (not sticky paper, but more like plastic or metal)
that represent different countries, and affix to the front grill
of the vanagons?  I have a hole I'd like to cover up, and this would
be about the right size; am trying to avoid replacing the whole
front grill.

Thanks.....
