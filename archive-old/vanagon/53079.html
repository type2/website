&gt; &gt; Hey folks,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; My acclerator cable is sticking when it is cold...Last year it never did
&gt; &gt; this (even at -30F).  This year it does it at any point below freezing...
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; How do I fix it?  Is there a lubricant that can be applied with cable still
&gt; &gt; on the van?  Where is it most likely freezing up ?...
&gt; 
&gt; Mark:
&gt; 
&gt; As you probably figured out, the throttle cable is a steel cable, very much
&gt; like the kind you find on bikes.  As long as it is, I don't think you can
&gt; effectively lubricate its entire length with the cable in place.  To

at motorcycle stores they sell special propellant based lubricant with a
fitting to seal of the end of a cable.  with this system you just have to
be able to get this small fitting onto the end of a cable (it seals
around the sheath and has a little rubber hole for the cable that is
sealed through clamping action, and a hole for the little plastic
propellant hose.) then spray lube into it until it starts coming out of
the other end. I have used this on motorcycle clutch, throttle and brake
cables with great success.  I don't, yet, have a vanagon/type2, so i
cant offer testimony as to wether or not this would work but this
gizmo is pretty inexpensive and might be worth a shot.
