&gt;What kind of load can the poptop handle?

I mounted my racks to the poptop of my '84 Westy using the Yakima bolt on
rain gutters that mount on the _side_ of the top. I forget what the name of
this adaptor is but it was made to mount on a Bronco and mounts with four
bolts per plate. Very important as the load will be in shear rather then
tension.  I mounted them as far back as possible to get the load out of the
windstream created by the front windshield. The back set is touching the
rear hinge.

This is the first of your messages that I have rea., I don't know what you
are palnning to carry but here is what mine has carried since '85 (yes at
one time):

A Yakima Rocket box loaded with five sails, two booms, three wetsuits, and
all the other the windsurfing gear.  Three masts attached by Multi mounts.
A tower like the Yakima Windready tower and two sailboards.  I takes two to
comfortably raise the top and lock it into position.  But the weight also
helps to keep the top down while driving.  Only in extreamly high
crosswinds (50+ mph), have I noticed the poptop front corner lift and then
only slightly.

I would estimate the load to be in excess of 275 pounds including the rack
and Rocket box.  I have used this system for close to 150,000 miles and the
only problem I had was when I did not fasten a board down well enough :(
