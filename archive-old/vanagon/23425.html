Subject: RE: VW Engine Fires (was: seat belts, fuel gauge, &amp; a firey death)

If you own an air cooled VW of any king look into automatic fire 
suppresion equipment. I firmly beleive that you should install or have 
installed automatic fire suppresion equipment for this reason. If you 
are driving down the freeway and you have an engine fire that fire is 
going to go very fast due to the amount of air that it is getting along 
with its fuel (your gas).

I used to work on off road cars where it was mandatory that there be 
fire suppression equipment on board. A friend of mine is looking into 
starting a business installing firesupression equipment in the engine 
compartments of motor homes. I had a friend that had a 1970 bug that he 
thought was pretty cool. He had the offset hinges on the decklid to 
help keep the engine cool. He had his engine catch on fire while 
traveling 50 miles an hour. He pulled over and grabbed the fire 
extinguisher and unloaded it and it still would not quit. A passing 
motorist unloaded his extinguisher and the fire was finally put out, 
but not before doing extensive damage to the car.

A good source to talk to about fuel lines is the Speed shops that 
specialize in racing products. Those shops cater to the alchohol and 
methanol folks but they usually carry a line of products for those that 
are more budget concious as well.
