Subject: Earl Scheib's RED (paint shop in Bay Area)

thanks for the advice. I had my 62 bus painted by Earl Scheib in LA in 1972
and it was great for about 5 years until I sold it. I now have a 70 colorado
red westy and am afeared that the red by earl scheib will fade. Anyone have
comments on Earl scheib's red. ????
