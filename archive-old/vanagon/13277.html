Subject: UGH! new VW/FORD/SEAT minivan

 Automotive News -  March 6 - page 23

Article on Geneva Autoshow

&quot;VW's Sharan VR6 Minivan and the Ford Galaxy are the results of a joint
venture between the two automakers.&quot;

&quot;Ford of Europe will feature...the new Galaxy minivan, the joint venture
vehicle built with Volkswagen in Portugal.  The galaxy's engines are a V-6,
a 2.0-liter four-cylinder, and a 1.8-liter four-cylinder diesel.&quot;

&quot;VW will show it's range-topping Sharan minivan equipped with the VR-6
engine and luxury trim.  A more basic version wears the SEAT badge; this
version may go into production next year.&quot;

Two photos of absolutely identical  minivans (one with a VW grill, one with
a Ford oval).  The vans look very conventional with snouty noses and four
conventional (not sliding) doors.  They look a bit like the result of a
breeding experiment between the GM BuLumina van  and the Honda Odyssey.
