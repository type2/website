The PO took the VIN plate out of the engine compartment in my '52 Standard!
(God only knows why)    
    So I don't have anything to go on besides the VIN #  which I found
stamped in another place.  (20-029 105)  
     It looks like this bus has gone threw 4 or 5 paint jobs, so it took me a
while to uncover the original paint.  
     The top half looks chocolate brown and the bottom half looks to be
white.  Does anyone know the actual names for these colors?   Also, my
speedometer goes up to 80km.  Not mph.  So does this mean that it came from
Europe?  Canada?    One more thing, the headlights look like they take
halogen type bulbs and not the sealed beem type.  Is this odd?
                                               
                                 Later,
