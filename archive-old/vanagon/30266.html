&gt; anyway, before i was taken off the list, i had posted something about a New
&gt; Year's Eve trip down to the keys. don't think this made it out to anyone. would
&gt; anyone be interested? let me know....i was thinking about dec 27- jan 3. maybe
&gt; take the back roads down to florida....think warmth!
&gt; 

I've been thinking about warmth all week.  It is currently, with the wind, 
-44 Celcius.  Thats -40F if my conversion is right.  Can anyone confirm 
how to convert Celcius to Fahrenheit?

I would love to come with you, but it is a 5-7 day drive to Florida.  Have 
fun, we *WILL* be thinking obout you.  We expect some great stories when 
you get back.  (No Pressure though..)

BTW, my wife ripped the door handle off of her '84 Rabbit yesterday.  No, 
she is not a WWF wrestler, it just shattered!!!  I think it is quite 
funny, but she doesn't think so.  She's got quite the grip, but that is a 
different story!! ;-)

I won't be laughing when I am fixing it this weekend.

Cheers

Tony
