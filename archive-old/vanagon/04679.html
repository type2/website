&gt; What's REALLY funny are the spare tires themselves.  What a joke.  And some
&gt; people drive around with these tiny skateboard sized wheels/tires like they
&gt; are the regular ones.  I'm amazed when I see some of these people accelerate
&gt; out on to the freeway and speed into the fast lane!  Absolutely crazy! 

We have a autocross member who showed up at one event in a Mustang SVO with
two temporary spares mounted on the front!  I commented that he looked like
he should be at a drag strip.  He did say that that it pushes a lot but I
forget what his reason was for putting them on.  Fortunatly he drove another
car in the event.
