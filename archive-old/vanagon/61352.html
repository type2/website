One more thing that just struck me, the old '86 did not have any 
symtoms at its death in '92, maybe because it was still young but 
also maybe because it had always worn a bra for protection.  The fine 
mesh of the bra may have prevented the bad stuff from intruding.  
The water spray might hit the mesh and run down the outside a bit 
more.

Anyway sort of like your mother always told you, and I always did
have trouble getting the damn thing on and off :-)
