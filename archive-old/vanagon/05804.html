Subject: If People Bought Cars Like Computers
Date: Fri, 28 Oct 94 7:04:34 PDT

 
  General Motors doesn't have a help line for people who don't know
  how to drive because people don't buy cars like they buy computers, but
  imagine if they did....

  HelpLine: &quot;General Motors HelpLine, how can I help you?&quot;
  Customer: &quot;I got in my car and closed the door and nothing happened!&quot;
  HelpLine: &quot;Did you put the key in the ignition slot and turn it?&quot;
  Customer: &quot;What's an ignition?&quot;
  HelpLine: &quot;It's a starter motor that draws current from your battery
             and turns over the engine.&quot;
  Customer: &quot;Ignition?  Motor?  Battery?  Engine?  How come I have to
             know all these technical terms just to use my car?&quot;

  HelpLine: &quot;General Motors HelpLine, how can I help you?&quot;
  Customer: &quot;My car ran fine for a week and now it won't go anywhere!&quot;
  HelpLine: &quot;Is the gas tank empty?&quot;
  Customer: &quot;Huh?  How do I know?&quot;
  HelpLine: &quot;There's a little gauge on the front panel with a needle
             and markings from 'E' to 'F'.  Where is the needle
             pointing?&quot;
  Customer: &quot;It's pointing to 'E'.  What does that mean?&quot;
  HelpLine: &quot;It means you have to visit a gasoline vendor and purchase
             some more gasoline.  You can install it yourself or pay
             the vendor to install it for you.&quot;
  Customer: &quot;What?  I paid $12,000 for this car!  Now you tell me that
             I have to keep buying more components?  I want a car that
             comes with everything built in!&quot;

  HelpLine: &quot;General Motors HelpLine, how can I help you?&quot;
  Customer: &quot;Your cars suck!&quot;
  HelpLine: &quot;What's wrong?&quot;
  Customer: &quot;It crashed, that's what wrong!&quot;
  HelpLine: &quot;What were you doing?&quot;
  Customer: &quot;I wanted to run faster, so I pushed the accelerator pedal
            all the way to the floor.  It worked for a while and then
            it crashed and it won't start now!
  HelpLine: &quot;It's your responsibility if you misuse the product.  What
            do you expect us to do about it?&quot;
  Customer: &quot;I want you to send me one of the latest version that
            doesn't crash any more!&quot;

  Customer: &quot;Hi, I just bought my first car, and I chose your car
            because it has automatic transmission, cruise control,
            power steering, power brakes, and power door locks.&quot;
  HelpLine: &quot;Thanks for buying our car.  How can I help you?&quot;
  Customer: &quot;How do I work it?&quot;
  HelpLine: &quot;Do you know how to drive?&quot;
  Customer: &quot;Do I know how to what?&quot;
  HelpLine: &quot;Do you know how to drive?&quot;
  Customer: &quot;I'm not a technical person.  I just want to go places
             in my car!&quot;
