    You forgot: ...

around here, rust lowers it pretty good, and real reliably

the driver seat in my '64 bug lowered itself a good 6 inches
and the whole front end of the '73 squareback lowered about 4.

and then there's the time i couldn't restart the '66 after a
taking a break in a multihour drive over Maine logging roads
and i eventually figured out that the battery had lowered itself
right out of the car.
