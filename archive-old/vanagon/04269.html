&gt;It's interesting that WA is #2 (of the real states, that is).

Ya,

Washington is a wierd place alright.  Just wierd enough to have a lot 
of bricks about.  There are neighborhoods in Seattle where it seems 
that the pre-requisite for
living there is to own a bus.  And then there are the other neighborhoods =)

I think that maybe we're second to California because half the 
population of the now Washington migrated from California.  There are a 
lot of locals here who wish they would migrate back.  I'm kinda 
indifferent to the whole thing.  I hope they like rain though =)
