Forwarded message follows:

I could use some help with a problem that been nagging me for awhile.
I have a '93 Eurovan Westfalia and I'd like to have an awning or
screenhouse attached over the sliding cargo door and in a position that
does not interfere with either the cargo door or the pop-up top.

I asked several VW dealers and several RV dealers about this and I've been
turned away. The main justification has been that manufacturers of that
equipment need the vehicle to have a rain-channel gutter to which they
attach their equipment. The Eurovan does not have a rain-channel gutter.

I have seen another Eurovan on the highway with just the equipment and
configuration I desire. Unfortunately at highway speeds and dodging crazy
drivers, did not allow me opportunity to ask about the source. I noted a
brand name, APOLLO on the unit.

Can someone help me with this?  Please don't pass this up since ANY
information can be more than I know right now!!
I need to know the source (name, address, telephone), model ID, Price(??),
or ANY detail or lead to follow.

Even though I'm in the USA, even if I could get information from some
other area, it may help.

If I know it (the awning or screenhouse) exists, some industrious soul or
business here may be able to order it or make it for me.

Thanks
