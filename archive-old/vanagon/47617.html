&gt;Well, this is some interesting stuff. It looks problematic for Syncros.
&gt;Here are some of my quick observations:
&gt;
&gt;&gt;4 disc brakes recommended DM 3,600.00
&gt;
&gt;A disk brake kit! That is about $2400 (plus shipping, duty, etc).
&gt;I wonder what it really is: ideal would be bigger disks up front, and
&gt;a drum to disk conversion for the rear!

I like to give some details from the Winkler catalogue:

The disk brakes are originally sold by Oettinger. That are complete kits 
including all you may need.
The rotors for the front are inside aircooled. The disks for the rear 
supports also the emergency brake.

This kit is NOT compatible with 14 inch wheels, you have to mount 15 or 16 
inch ones.


Original Oettinger Ordering numbers are:

For regular Vanagons: OE 350 601 00  DM 3,600.00
For Syncros         : OE 350 602 00  DM 4,285.00
