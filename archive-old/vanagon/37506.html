Subject:  81 chirping/compression test?

thanks for all the suggestions, here's a list:
check fanbelt/alt bearing (just put new belt on in august&amp;it is tightened to
spec), no grease where the points rubbing block and distributor can
make contact (?), loose plug, trash in shroud, loose head, hole in muffler
(don't think this is it).  i'll check these to the best of my abilities, and hope
that it is something this simple.  somehow i have the feeling it is more
serious.

i'm planning on driving a little this weekend (if it is dry) to check the
mileage via the hoover method.  i also just got a compression tester and
plan on checking compression.  the idiot book just says to remove all the
plugs, insert the device, and crank 6 times (for each cyl).  bentley sez to
disconnect terminal 4 on the ignition coil and connect it to ground before
performing the test.  having never done this before, i thought i'd check if
there was anything else i should know/do.  the only dumb question is
one that is not asked, right?

thanks, matthew (and mobius the adventurewagen)

p.s. - i called the tire rack yesterday to check on their price for the
michelin 185r14 xzx reinforced tires and they said they are out of stock
and no longer manufactured.  know anything on this?
