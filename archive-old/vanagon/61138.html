&gt;      2. I'm betting that wear of the Nylon slides is the reason my windows
&gt;      sound like the dreaded &quot;fingernails-on-chalkboard&quot; when I open and
      close them.  Garth seemed to intimate that the required number of
      these thingies is 8 per vehicle; true?

Hi Blaine,

One van requires 4 of these guides--I bought 4 for me and 4 for a friend
who was told by our local VW dealer that these were no longer available.

Sorry for any misunderstanding.

Garth
