Hmmn, in regard to my previous post, another bit, I'm not even sure 
if that seal somehow seals ATF going to the converter or is more 
likely a seal on the gear oil in the final drive.  The residue smells 
a bit ATFish but it's hard to tell and I get a slight ATF smell in 
the engine compartment, but it might be oil.  Is it possible for the 
converter itself to somehow leak a little ATF without failing 
chronically.  Hell what does a converter look like inside, what does 
it do, I'm clueless on these things.  Have not yet checked the final 
drive oil level, will do that tomorrow.
