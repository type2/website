Well, I'm afeared that my '56's motor is not long for this world.

I'm on the tail end of moving, and I needed to get the bus (which was
full of odds and ends to move) to my new house, which is about 5 miles
away.

I haven't been able to start it up lately, and I though it was the battery
going west.  I put in a brand-spankin new battery this AM, and still
no start - barely turned over.  I had my friend with the '59 bus try to jump
start me - he has 2 6v batteries in parallel - nothin!  I jumped the 
starter contacts manually with a screwdriver - nothin'  Sounds like
its time for a new starter!

Anyway, we got it started by pulling it with his bus, and then he was
gonna follow me to my new house.  Talk about no power!  I swear, every time
I drive the thing it has 5 fewer horsepower!  Any ideas?  It took me
45 minutes to travel less than 5 miles, and there wasn't any traffic!

The engine stutters on rev-up real bad.  We took Ray's carb and put on my
bus, and there was no change.  We put his distributor on my bus (with
and without his carb) and no change.  I've alread put in new points, plugs
condensor, cap, rotor, coil, fuel pump and rebuilt the carb - what next?  
He thinks it might be a toasted valve.  We can't check the compression
because it won't turn over fast enough!

Any ideas, or donations for the transplant are welcome.  I'll even give
you a tax-deductible reciept!  Make checks payable to &quot;Save the Dove-Blue
Whale Foundation&quot; c/o this address.

Thank you, and may St. Muir guide you in your travails.
