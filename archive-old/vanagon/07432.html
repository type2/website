Subject: Re: Recipe for Diesel #1


I don't actually drive a Vanagondiesel, but between my '70Kombi and my 
'92 JettaEcodiesel, I may be able to help.

According to Chevron,

Diesel #1 is a winterized fuel, and as thin as diesel gets.  Usually only 
sold during the winter and/or up north.  

Diesel #2 is your standard truck/auto diesel.  Normally, this is sold 
spring/summer/fall and then replaced with #1 for the winter; however, 
some dealers in southern climes simply sell a winterized #2.

Diesel #3 and #4 I believe are only for tractors and other 
farm/industrial equipment.  

I asked the local truck-stop guy, and he said, &quot;It's winterized after 
mid-November.&quot;  #1 or #2, He/I didn't know.  To be extra-sure, I add some 
&quot;Diesel Fuel Supplement&quot; at every tankful and have had no problems, even 
in -10 degree weather (with block heater plugged in).
                       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

&gt;From what I understand, diesel is a less-refined version than gasoline, 
requiring less processing because of its &quot;crudity.&quot;  Cost-wise, I've 
heard that gas companies are gouging us diesel owners by not charging a 
cost relative to the lesser degree of processing, but............

&gt; Hello vanagonites,
&gt; Does anyone know of the recipe for diesel #1.  My wife, actually  asked it
&gt; in that way after my brake fluid feast.  Our vanagon seems to really prefer
&gt; to run on diesel #1, the milage is higher, starting is much easier, etc.
&gt; However, unless it's 14 below here, we can only get diesel #1 by driving
&gt; a long ways (140 miles round trip).
&gt; Also, if anyone has great knowledge about diesel in general (the fuel)
&gt; i would like to know what type of process produces diesel.  What makes
&gt; diesel ultimately cheaper than gasoline?
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Stuart
