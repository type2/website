&gt;i just had the $%_at_#  exhuast system crack again, this time at the 
&gt;entrance to the converter.  successfully welded for $15.  so far, the 
&gt;exhaust has cracked and been welded successfully at the following 
&gt;places (it's turning out a little like lightning, never twice in the 
&gt;same spot):


I guess I've been much luckier (or maybe it's the dry weather) but I've only
had one crack on my 87 and none on my 88.  On the crack I had, I had a shop
weld up the crack and then weld on a slab of metal over the crack, kinda like
a permanent band-aid to help assure that the same crack wouldn't continue
through the weld.  I think the shop charged maybe $10. and took about 10
minutes.
