Subject: A few questions about '86 Vanagon

I'm thinking of buying an '86 Vanagon Westfalia with 150k miles on it, 
and have a few questions:

1) Its an automatic.  How well do these hold up?  It works fine, but I 
would expect 150k to be about the end of life for an automatic.

2) The exhaust manifold has  a hairline crack in the bend where it goes 
up to the head, on both passenger side sections.  I have heard exhaust 
components for these are VERY expensive.  Any comments?

3) The air conditioner clutch and pulley are missing.  Anyone know if 
these are readily avaliable at a resonable price, or is it likely to be a 
problem?

4) The A/C looks to be an add on unit (it has the same controls as the 
dealer added air on my '81 Rabbit)  Does the air ducting extend to the 
dash, or does this produce cold air only from the rear vents?

5) Other than these problems, the van seems to be in nearly perfect 
condition, with the heads replaced in the last year or so, and new tires. 
 Any guess at a fair price?  (remember, its a Westy)

Thanks,

Bill
