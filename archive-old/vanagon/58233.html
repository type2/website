Subject: Thanks, Volks! for Re: Recs for oil wt, tires

Thanks to many on the list for helpful suggestions.  I've put together a
plan based on the suggestions received plus my past experience, and will
report back if I learn anything that might be of use to others.   Most
interesting to me, is that after hearing widespread cautions about not
trusting the oil changes to gas station types, and most importantly with the
guidance of a detailed list of instructions from Don Gibbons, I'm going to
do the change myself.  No big deal to all you ol' greasemonkeys, i'm sure,
but a step for me.  So, here's my plan:

        1. make sure i have correct wrench, etc, plus recycle receptacle

        2. get Bosch or Mann oil filter and drain plug gasket

        3. 20w50 oil, enough for the change, plus a qt or 2 to carry around 

I think i'd rather spend less on &quot;dino&quot; oil and change it more frequently,
at least for now, especially since I haven't seen any indications of any
inordinate leakage [i.e., 1 qt/2500 mi sounds ok for consumption].

TIRES:
Having been really alarmed to discover how inadequate my tires are [676# wt
range], i'm replacing them ASAP.  for those interested, the highly
recommended Yokohama Y370 LT 195 75/R14's are *back-ordered* per Yokohama,
and will not be available for 6-8 wks, *if ever*.   This info is direct from
Yokohama, obtained w/ assistance from Al Knoll of this list, who has been
kind enough to help me check it out.  Yokohama is offering in place of the
Y370 a Y356, another 8-ply light truck tire reportedly exactly the same
specs and capacities, differing only in tread pattern.  The customer rep I
spoke to stressed that this is a &quot;niche&quot; tire, and that those who care might
choose to call in to Yokohama to stress their interest in having it
available.  Cust Svc is 800.722.9888.  America's Tire Co. here is offering
the tire for $69.99 each, total out the door $345.74 for 4, mtd, balanced
and w/ free rotations.  There is no &quot;official&quot; treadwear warranty for these
lt truck tires, per both Yokohama and America's Tire Co.  There is
apparently a 3-5 workday delay to get a full set in.

Guess that's it for me for now.  Thanks again to all who took the time to
respond.  I really appreciate the members of this list!
