Subject: Super Nice 1990 Westfalia Synchro For Sale

I got a call from someone who wants to sell her 1990 Westfalia Synchro 
today, but it's a bit too rich for my blood.

Here are the deets: Complete camper interior, all options, diff. lock, 
alpine 5th gear, about 45K miles, dark blue. Was in recent fender bender 
in parking lot, but exterior is being completely done over. Intereior is 
excellent. $22,000. Call Page Hodel: (415) 647-8258. AM is best, but 
other times, too. Vehicle is in San Francisco.

Wish it could be mine. Maybe it could be yours.
