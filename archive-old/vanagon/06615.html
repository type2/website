I use a propane Olympian heater myself, but have seen another fellow in a 
Westy who carried a large clay flower pot in the van. When he wants heat, 
he puts it upside down on the burner... thus capturing that heat and it 
slowly emanates from there... more heat, longer lasting. He said it 
worked well even in snows.  This is supposedly modeled after the Indian 
idea of using clay ovens because clay captures and stores heat.
