Subject: rebuild, temperature, fuel injection, and crankcase seal

Sometime back I posted a question.....
I did my first rebuild.  Everything seemed OK, except that I mismatched 
the new cylinders and the new pistons.  I've been told they should kept 
as pairs.  No big deal.

My engine runs warm - like 350-375 cylinder #3 temp (VDO guage).  Why is 
this, right after a rebuild?  So i took it to a local VW man.  He said 
that the engine itself checked out OK.  He said my high temp (which he 
argued was not close to overheating, which is like 450....)
1- the box.  I have this tall (2 foot?) tools, parts box bolted to the 
from of the roof.  He said that not only does it have bad aerodynamics, 
but it bolks the air flow that goes to the air intake chutes.
2- the engine seal.  My engine seal is about 2' short, and I happened to 
leave the gap in the rear of the engine compartment.  (front is front)
Right above the muffler.  So when the engine doesn't get air from the chutes
(See #1) it gets hot muffler air. 

OK, I can buy these.  I guess I'll build a smaller, trapezoidal van box.
I'll also find some engine seal.  (Does anyone have any extra?  A foot or 
two?)  What do you think of these ideas?

Furthermore, I mentioned the fuel mixture, which was a suggested issue 
here on the net. He said that my FI system (I have a 76 with AFC FI) 
automatically adjusts the mixture.  He said that the two adjustment 
screws (one on the throttle lever and one on the air flow meter/sensor) 
really only affect the idle mixture.  Is he full of it?

Finally, he noted that I used the orange RTV stuff to seal the crankcase, 
as recommended by another VW guru at the time.  This VW man said that 
this kind of RTV left too big of a shim, and would cause early (about 40k 
miles) wear  on the bearings and case.  He recommended some kind of 
aviation RTV.  I do not buy this arguement.  What do you think?

Thanks-
Jesse Reynolds
