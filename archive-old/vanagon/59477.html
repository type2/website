Subject: Catalytic Converter failure

   Midas agreed to replace the muffler &amp; Cat they installed 34,000 miles
ago, but stated I would need to get the engine checked as &quot;convertors do not
wear out&quot;.  I asked for specific things to look for--and he stated the
either the O2 sensor or an engine that &quot;runs too rich&quot; could prematurely
burn the cat out.
Any truth to this?  and if so, what might the procedure be to check out O2
functioning and/or &quot;richness&quot;?
TIA,
Jim
