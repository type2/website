     &gt;I just heard that the ratios of the reduction gears varied across the 
     &gt;pre-'68 years of buses.
     &gt;
     &gt;Can any one confirm or deny?
     &gt;
     &gt;If this is the case, does anyone know what the ratios were for 
     &gt;various years?
     
     I attempted to identify the ratio by counting the number of teeth on a 
     photograph in the manual and came up with a ratio of 1:1.6 !!
     
     &gt;I'm thinking that (hopefully) an earlier year reduction gear might 
     &gt;reduce less (tho its probably the other way around given weaker 
     &gt;engines).
     
     Probably the later, although I think that the late buses (1500 option) 
     didn't require reduction boxes at all.
     
     I you want to get rid of this pointless reduction system you should 
     fit either an IRS conversion kit or a Straight Axle conversion kit.
