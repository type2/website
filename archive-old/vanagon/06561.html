Subject: Wanting to buy a VW....
Date: 14 Nov 94 14:59:21 -0500

Hello all,
        I am looking to get a VW.
        I would prefer the following:
        74 autostick bug or ghia.
        But, here is what I also would like to buy.
        post 67 bug, or ghia
 ***    post 67 camper bus
        or a thing.
        Anyhow, I will warn you my upper limit is $2000 U.S.
        Driveable condition and in Indiana a plus, as I don't have the
time or perhaps a good enough vehicle to get me across some states unless
it is a really sweet deal ;-)
        I can be reached at the following:
