&gt; Interesting considering the small amount of oil and cooler size used in
&gt; the stock setup.  Of course, you can invest all kinds of $$$ into a
&gt; aftermarket oil plumbing/cooling but I really think it is a waste of
&gt; money myself.  Others, I'm sure, disagree fanatically.  

Well, I have a problem with my oil overheating.  Still.  After all the
things I have tried to solve the problem.  I don't really know what
else to do at this point, so I am considering an aftermarket system.  I
agree that the stock cooler is woefully small.  When my bus gets warmed
up the oil pressure will slowly drop and begin to fluctuate (this may be
a separate problem, I know).  Eventually, the pressure will drop to a
point where I am no longer comfortable running the engine.  Allowing
the engine to cool restores the pressure, so I must conclude that the oil
is overheating.  Cylinder Head Temparature remains rock solid at a
comfortable temperature (???), usually around 200-250 fahrenheit.
I just changed my oil and put in straight 30 weight instead of the
20-50 I normally use.  The pressure goes down a lot faster now.  Ugh.
I'm gonna give synthetic a try next oil change...

&gt;							It's amazing
&gt; how much people will spend to maintain what really is a throw-away
&gt; engine.  But hey, who am I to judge?  Air is what is being used to
&gt; primarily keep the engine cool but oil is supplimenting this.  I guess
&gt; I can buy this.  Oh well....

Perhaps the book is overemphasizing the importance of the oil in keeping
the motor cool.  I will try to look up the sections and type some of it
in next week.
