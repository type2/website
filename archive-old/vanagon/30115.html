Subject: re:Any sources for vinyl flaps up front?

Ken Stevens is Working on the interior of his '79 Westy and has a
couple of questions.

&gt;1. Does anyone know where I could get another set of the
&gt;vinyl flaps that wrap around the bottom of the front seats?

If anyone has this answer I would be interested in the info as well


&gt;2. Can anyone recommend a good dye for the curtains.

If you are going the single color route use RIT dye in your favorite
color, in the wash(be sure to run the washer empty at least 1 time to
get the dye out so you do not stain your next load of wash). Available
at you local grocery store, instructions printed on box.  The stuff is
cheap so if it bleaches, reapply.

&gt;3. Does anyone know of a source for the weatherstripping around
&gt;the front vents under the grille?

Put a towel under the grille. Actually I have found that the air is
not coming from there alone, It is coming up from under the front
somewhere, I just haven't found out where, if you find out where, I
would be interested in knowing.


Cheers,
