&gt; 
&gt; Also, where's a good place to get VW and Vanagon parts in the Boston

&gt; 
&gt; Was I surprised when I did a Net search for &quot;Vanagon&quot; and found this

  Welcome,
     I just put a outer boot no my Syncro, thrusday. Had a time of
     it just to find the right boot. Cost me $28. Took a week to get.
     But that's here in Pgh. PA.  You may find the parts there are
     more plentiful.
