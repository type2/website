&gt; &gt;I was looking for new pad that covers the engine and completes the lower

&gt;  You ought to be able to find a pad at a junkyard, that's where I found
mine.

Also, try Sorin Benjenaru on the list at:
103164.3373_at_CompuServe.COM

He's got more Vanagon parts than ant junkyard I've visited.

Good luck,
