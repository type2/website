Subject: Windshield Wiper Sudden Failure - Ideas?

In San Jose, my wipers have been doing more in the last week than in most 
years and were working fine last night. Got in this morning and turned 
them on - NOTHING!
I read the manual and pulled fuze #17 - fine, said that the rear window 
wiper was on a different fuze, but right now nothing works - front of 
rear. Sure sounds electrical to me - took it to my trusty repair folks 
and all seem to think it is the switch - dealer cost $71 - looking at the 
switch, it seems pretty simple (hard to break) and there is no obvious 
strange things dangling, or falling from the switch. 
That exhausts my ideas - anyone have this sort of a problem before and 
have this WONDERFUL simple and elegant solution that will get me back 
slogging through the rain.

BTW, bought some of that &quot;Rain-X&quot; after reading all the glowing comments 
- instructions say the glass has to be DRY!! - sigh
Jack
