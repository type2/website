	I've done various rust repairs over the years. I've
seen the &quot;Rust converter&quot; stuff Plastikote sells- paints on
milky white, turns dark blue-black. Nothing's rusty on the
Corrado, yet, so I haven't experimented with it yet...

	On earlier cars, and other metal objects, I've had
pretty good results with Rust-oleum brand stuff. They
make primers for rusty and lightly rusted steel, and 
a wet-sandable primer. These are brown, yechy yellow
and gray, respectivly. Probably the most demanding use
I've made was the custom-painted medicine cabinent in
the bathroom- my late wife wanted a yellow cabinent
to match the yellow paint I'd put on the walls, and 
didn't much like the new cabinents we saw in the stores.

	So we bought a used medicine cabinent from an
architectural salvage place, and I disassembled it, wire-brushed
the rusty parts down to shiny metal, brush painted the whole
thing with Rustoleum for lightly rusted metal (yechy yellow-
zinc chromate?), sanded and then top-coated with Rustoleum
yellow from a spray can. Four years later, in the only
bathroom in the house, it still looks like I just
finished it.

	Lori painted a metal chair frame with their
primer for rusty metal (it was!) and then topcoated with
black and its still fine too, sitting outside for the last
4 years or so.

	your milage may vary, etc.
