&gt;Other than taking a LONG trip, does anyone know where I can get
&gt;those decals (not sticky paper, but more like plastic or metal)
&gt;that represent different countries, and affix to the front grill
&gt;of the vanagons?  I have a hole I'd like to cover up, and this would
&gt;be about the right size; am trying to avoid replacing the whole
&gt;front grill.

Wolfsburg west has them, and I think RMMW does, too.
