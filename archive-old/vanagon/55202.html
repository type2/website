&gt;  Thanks.  Tim

Yes.  In December I added this exact Amsoil setup to my 87 Syncro.  There
were no leaks in the system throughout my Christmas 2,900 mile trip or since.
 I've been waiting a bit before posting a full evaluation.  I'll do this in a
couple weeks or so.

Also, this external filter arrangement provided me convenient places to mount
my ne oil temperature and oil pressure sensors.
