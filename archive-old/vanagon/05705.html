Subject: Re: front end woes

&gt;Using one of our local 8&quot; curbs, I managed to reset the front end
&gt;alignment on my '78 to the point where it cannot be set correctly. (the
&gt;long way of saying I bent it beyond repair). In search of a solution, I 
&gt;went out and bought a really nice looking used front axle beam. After 
&gt;hefting it, I have decided that if I can get away with replacing only the 
&gt;trailing arms, I will be way ahead of the game (and may even avoid a 
&gt;hernia).  Before I do, I wanted to check the replacement trailing arms 
&gt;for straightness.  The manual shows a jig that VW shops are supposed to 
&gt;have that does this check, but none of the DC/MD/VA VW dealers have the 
&gt;jig.  Does anyone (are you listening,joel?) have the correct dimensions 
&gt;for the arms?  that is the x and y offsets from the centerline of the 
&gt;shaft at the insertion plane to the center of the ball joint?  Does 
&gt;anyone know where one of these jigs might be found?  Am I better off 
&gt;replacing the whole front beam?  OK, Joel, Ric, David, David, etal lay the 
&gt;WORD on me....  
&gt;

Well I don't know what the dimensions should be but I do know that swapping 
front beams is a back-breaking job. The complete assembly is heavy and 
awkward so I ended up taking off the trailing arms anyway, just so I could 
get the beam lined up with the holes in the body. If your existing beam is 
OK, leave it well alone and just swap the arms. Now, all you need is a jig 
to check that the beam is straight :-)
