Subject: 76' westies price

It seems that i forgot to include the price in my last post.
The one with the bad paint is $2100 and the other is $3000.  
Since these aren't mine, i can only set you up with the seller
who is not on line.  The price on the nicer one seems high, but
i have to admit that it is in nice condition for its age, mind
you not pristine.
Thanks for all the responses.
