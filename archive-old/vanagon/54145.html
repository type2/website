Hi.  I have a block heater on our Syncro.  It is a flat aluminum 
mounting plate with two &quot;stove element&quot; type bars that lead up to it 
from the electrical plug.  I ordered it with our van.  It is actually 
made in Canada and a VW part.  It just bolts under the engine to keep 
the sump warm.

&gt; Hi: I don't know how common block heaters are in the States. The Tristar
&gt; I have came from Canada and it is equiped with a block heater that is a
&gt; 3/4&quot; thick plastic block with heating elements in it that fits under and
&gt; against the engine block. I could climb underneath to see if I can find
&gt; any markings or part numbers if I was coaxed. I bring this up because
&gt; this is the only one I have ever seen and assume it is a VW piece.  Todd
