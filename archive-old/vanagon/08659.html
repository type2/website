&gt;&gt; To your first point, I don't agree. Cylinder #1 is further rearward in the
&gt;  car (okay, okay, it's only a couple inches). You can check this on your
&gt;  Vanagon by looking where the spark plug wires go through the sheet metal.
&gt;  
&gt;  I have heard mention too about welding up something in Type 1 cases around
&gt;  cylinder #3, but I don't understand why it is done. Could it be related to
&gt;  pulling studs?

If you look at the case, you will notice that there is a lot less material
between #3 and the bell housing.  What they do is weld an extra chunk of
metal in there to beef it up.   The AS21 cases have a lot more metal in
there to begin with.
