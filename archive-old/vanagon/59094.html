RE:     Copy of: leaking propane tank fill valve

I tried to fill an 84 propane tank and the &quot;thumb screw&quot; valve could not be
closed enough to stop the propane from leaking out.

Has anyone repaired this unit or knows where to get a replacement fill
valve?

Also, I have been told that the tank must be recertified after 12 years and
then every five years.  As the tag is long gone from the tank, it is
impossible to get it recertified.

Does anyone know where I can get a new tank?

Thanks
