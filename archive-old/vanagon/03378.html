To me this sounds like an electrical problem or an air flow problem - You
might want to check the integrity of all your hoses including the one to
the 
air regulator and also check the air flow sensor. It sounds as if it is
sticking or that a vacuum hose is off. Also check your plugs and rotor.... DC
