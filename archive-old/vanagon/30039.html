Subject: extended warranty

&gt;- finally, they *did* offer me an 'extended warranty' deal, through GE I
&gt;think. I told them I'd think about it. My initial reaction is that this
&gt;would just be a waste of money. But there *are* a lot more things in this
&gt;thing to break. I'm wondering if any of you have experience with this. Did
&gt;you wish you bought it? Or are you sorry you wasted your money on it?

I had one on my '83 Westy, did no good whatsoever when the waterjacket
problem developed. I have heard that the best thing to do is put the same
amount in an interest yielding bank account and let the money grow until
you have a problem. If you bought a good van, any problems that come up out
of factory warranty should be paid by the account, or at least a good sized
chunk of it.
