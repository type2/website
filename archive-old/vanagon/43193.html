Dori,

Scrub it.  Start underneath.  Use a bristle brush and as much fresh water as
you can afford.  Rust's chemical 'engine' is driven by chloride ions from the
road salt.  A good scrub-down will remove most of them, slowing the 'engine'
to an idle.

Go down to Home Depot or a good paint paint store and buy a couple of quarts
of Jasco Prep &amp; Prime.  It is a phosphoric acid solution, identical to the
stuff in the hi-buck rust 'converters' such as POR-15, but without the
lacquer.  Read the instructions.  Do what comes naturally.

While you're at Home Depot buy a quart of Rustoleum Rusty Metal Primer, a
gallon of paint thinner and half a dozen cheap brushes, 1-1/2&quot; or 2&quot; wide.

After scrubbing the rusty areas, get them perfectly dry then start doping
them up with the phosphoric acid solution.  It will convert the fast-moving
red oxide into a more a stable black oxide.  It's still rust but you will
have slowed the progress from miles per hour to inches per year.  When the
acid has done its thing wipe the area with mineral spirits and let that dry.
 Take a stick and mix you can of Rustoleum for at least ten minutes.  Now
start painting.

There is no cure for rust.  You must cut it out and weld in new metal, and
thereafter do considerably more to prevent its occurance, such as washing the
underside of your vehicle each time you drive on salted roads -- and at least
once a month in the summer because the salt is still there.

Painting over rust doesn't cure it but it will slow down the rusting process
and buy you some time to figure out how to deal with the problem.
