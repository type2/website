Subject: Re: Freeze plug leaking coolant, Leaking head gasket-diesel

&gt; My '83 camper has about 90k miles since factory &quot;CS&quot; longblock installed. 
&gt; I have added additional stress by adding  85' qntm turbodiesel intake and
&gt; exhaust, however boost is kept at 8 psi,and EGT below 1150 F.
&gt; 
&gt; Engine is running well now, headbolts were retorqued about 30k miles ago,
&gt; coolant replaced _at_ 2 yr interval with vw brand.         
&gt; I am wondering if I should replace the head gasket with a &quot;turbo&quot; head gasket
&gt; to avoid a possible breakdown far from home.
&gt;  
&gt; Any experiences with adding a turbo to a non-turbo car?
The turbo head is cast from a stronger alloy than non-turbo models, 
and the pistons are also different composition. Turbos also use 
audi-style piston coolers to squirt oil on the underside of the 
pistons. Based on this, it is wise to monitor exhaust temps since 
you presumably don't have the piston coolers. How are you measuring 
boost &amp; EGT?
I'm not sure about head gaskets being different - when I did mine, I 
*think* the gasket was the same for turbo &amp; normal diesels, aside 
from the 1,2 or 3 notches indicating thickness.

&gt; Much warning before the head gasket goes? 
In my case, the gasket was leaking oil badly from the main oil 
gallery between 3 &amp; 4. Upon removal of the head, I found indications 
of minor coolant seepage into 2 cylinders. The oil leak had been evident 
for 2+ years, I just finally got tired of the mess. 

&gt; Thanks for any info.
