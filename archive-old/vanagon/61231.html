Hello Gary:

I have a 1995 5-speed Eurovan Winnebago.  

We have traveled approximately 35,000 km to date, and leave
in 2 weeks for Colorado and Utah (4 weeks).

We typically consume 12 litres per 100 km on the highway -
you would have to convert that into American &lt;g&gt; I guess.

I am not sure what you mean about &quot;recycling&quot; the furnace.
We set the thermostat and it turns itself on and off all night.
Is that what you were asking?

By the way, I purchased a 7 year extended warranty - having
owned a 1979 and a 1988, parts prices make the extension look like a
bargain.

Dan
