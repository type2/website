Subject: RE:  Carpet availability


I know there was a post several weeks ago regarding seat uphosterey.  I
wonder if any members have located a reliable source for carpet for
Vanagons.  I know there are many companies that supply carpet for the
busses, but I'm in need of a new carpet for an 84 Vanagon.  Thanks in
advance for the leads.

I have only loafs (loaves?), but I always go to regular floor-carpet
places, get the thickest, tightest-knit &quot;plush&quot; carpet I can find that I
like the color of (Colorado-mud-brown is very good), and put two
layers of 1/2&quot; dense foam padding under it. It's soft and luxurious,
sound-insulates well, and you can sleep directly on it without winding up
with corrugated skin-- a major consideration in a breadloaf.

Do Vanagons have corrugated floors too?
