&gt; Now I am ready to do welding. I looked into renting an arc stick
&gt; welder. The
&gt; guy says, stick wleding on car sheet metals is really difficult. He
&gt; is
&gt; talking about some other kinds (Mig or Heli-arc) that I don't have
&gt; any experience with. Anybody knows what these things are?
&gt; 
&gt; Here is my questions:
&gt; 
&gt; 1- Has anybody done stick welding on VW's. If yes what current would
&gt; you use? I think Herb mentioned an 18 Gauge stick welding. (Thanks &gt; Herb) At what current though?

It is *difficult* for me to &quot;stick-weld&quot; on thin guage sheet metal. I 
prefer Oxy-Acetlyene weling over the stick. I usually end up burning 
holes right through the metal. Even better is MIG (Metal Inert Gas) 
welding for the thin stuff. A MIG welding tip is surrounded by a gas that 
displaces oxygen, and help cools the surrounding metal. Argon is a common 
gas when welding with MIG.


&gt; 
&gt; 2- I've found this welder at Orchard Supply for $200. It goes up to
&gt; 225 Amps. It is a single phase 220 V AC. I can hook it up to my
&gt; dryer outlet. Would this do the job?

Well, it is plenty big! Overkill for sheet metal, though!!! Does it have 
AC as well as DC output? DC welding will deposit more metal from the rod 
while the torch is &quot;lit&quot;, as opposed to AC, which will burn deeper into 
the metal. BTW, I have plugged my welder into the dryer outlet, but 
please keep in mind that the welder will come with a 50-amp plug on it, 
and the dryer is either 25 or 35 amps. You will need to make and adapter 
for it. The breaker did pop whenever I tried to make long welds.

Here's a quick rule of thumb on amperage and metal thickness. Use the 
same amperage as the thickness of the metal. For example, to weld 1/4&quot; 
steel, use 250 amps. (1/4&quot;=.250&quot;, get it?) For 1/8 inch, use 125 
amps...and so on. On 18-20 ga sheet metal, you will need to use the 
lowest amperage that you can still get the torch to maintain an arc. 
Maybe 60 amps on a thin rod.

Also, choose the type of rod carefully! Not only diameter (thinner rods 
are for welding at low amps), but also the properties. For example, a 
#6013 rod will deposit a lot of filler material, but a #6018 will cut 
into the surface.

&gt; 
&gt; 3- If with stick welding you can easily melt the metal, then how
&gt; about gas welding?

Takes some practice, but that is the way the body guys did it for years 
before the MIG.

About 7 years ago, I took a welding class at a local vo-tech program run 
by the county government. Classes were at night, three nights a week. It 
was for six weeks, and cost less than $200. We were taught flame, stick, 
MIG and Heli-arc welding in that class. That $200 has been paid for many 
times over! Before embarking on your project, I would recommend the same!

Good luck!
