&gt;I used to commute in one of those Dodge Ram 15 passenger commuter
&gt;vans, 20+ miles (that's 35+ red lights) up route 1 here in NJ - we
&gt;saw drivers doing everything you could imagine - TRIMMING TOENAILS,

well, i THOUGHT i had seen just about everything ... but TRIMMING TOENAILS
takes the cake. good grief. and we wonder why there are 40,000 folks killed
every year on the highway!!! i wonder just what sort of dollar-totals
there is in the fender-fixer business every year, what with the toe-clippers
banging into the newspaper-readers or the deodorant-appliers. gad!

it just goes to show: there's always somebody that'll do something you NEVER
expect! :)
