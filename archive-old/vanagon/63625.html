Subject: Re: Projektzwo Raising Kit

But this is stunning news--a Projektzwo raising kit!

This is what I want even more than the new springs and shocks right now. So
I will call them and see about ordering a raising kit for the front since I
have already raised the rear.

I'll also cc this to get it into the archives.

&gt;Hi Derek.  
&gt;
&gt;It sounds like Peter is the expert.  Projektzwo has a lowering kit for
&gt;standard vanagons, and a raising kit for Syncro's.  They use the factory
&gt;available shocks.  I did not get pricing.  It sounds like Projektzwo likes to
&gt;deal with more current stuff, T4 eurovans, other watercooled Jetta, GTI,
&gt;PAssat, etc.  Projektzwo deals in the US with VW Sports, Springfield PA. 
&gt;phone 703-451-5135.  Projektzwo is shipping a Jetta package next week to VW
&gt;Sports, and mentioned that parts could piggyback on that if a person acted
&gt;swiftly.
&gt;
&gt;I called VW Sports, they had pricing on T4 Eurovan stuff, but no pricing on T3
&gt;stuff.  They are sending me a catalog of Projektzwo stuff.  
&gt;
&gt;I read you report on Peter, and Thomas's reply and the other guy about
&gt;springs.  I am interested primarily for now, only in the Shocks.  That's
&gt;'cause mine are shot.  (DPO had SyncroBeast for 120,000 miles, and may never
&gt;have changed)  Springs could come later, unless there was some compelling
&gt;reason to get now, such as significant cost savings, and I'm not sure I'd ever
&gt;be interested in a &quot;raising&quot; kit.  My interest is not to go so heavy toward
&gt;offroad capability as a raising kit might imply.
&gt;
&gt;So where do we go from here.  I'm good at digging up info, but  little short
&gt;on knowledge of how to buy overseas.  It occurs to me that the idea of group
&gt;purchase is a good one, if we can save some $$, what do you think.
&gt;
&gt;Ch
&gt;'89 Syncro Beast
&gt;'87 GTI 16V
&gt;'86 Scirocco (SO's)
&gt;
&gt;p.s.
&gt;a usefull reference page, from Bilstein.  Note that the T3 shocks are listed
&gt;as heavy duty. (and 2 wheel only, Front and Back.)  I understand that the
&gt;Bilstein back fits the Syncro.

&gt;
&gt;p.p.s.
&gt;yes, I responded to Thomas's new VW survey address, did you.  I figure/hope
&gt;that maybe if I &quot;comment&quot; enough times they will let me be a test driver, ???.
&gt; Long ago, I put in an order for the first Turbo Scirocco, the first Syncro
&gt;GTI, etc, etc, with my dealer, and they never showed.  Maybe I can get first
&gt;in line for a new Syncro van.  It would be nice to see VW regain a decent
&gt;position in some of the markets they CREATED.
