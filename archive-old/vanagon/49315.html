&gt;&gt;Jim,
&gt;&gt;How 'bout sketching some diagrams and layouts of your designs?
&gt;&gt;Better yet, take some photos, scan them and put them on as
&gt;&gt;attachments for us to see!  Your hard work should be visual....
&gt;&gt;people around here appreciate stuff like this!
&gt;
&gt;Ummm... fine except for the part about attaching photos.  If that isn't
&gt;forbidden by the list charter, it should be.  We'd love to see photos of
&gt;your stuff, but please just make them available by anonymous FTP or put
&gt;them up on a web site.  Thanks!

Does one of you with a web site want to host a few pictures of the items I
built?
