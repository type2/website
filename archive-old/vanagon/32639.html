Subject: from VW Germany

A couple of months ago I wandered around the VW Germany web server.  I don't 
speak German, so I just was looking at the pictures.  Anyway, I came up on a 
page that looked like a form to request info, so I filled it out (in 
English) and asked about the Eurovan and trucks.  I pressed what looked like 
the send button and it came back with a message in German that looked like 
an error message - I thought nothing had happened, until yesterday when I 
got a packet from Germany.

They included the English language sales brochures for the Multivan, and a 
brochure for the Taro.  The Taro looks like a small Japanese pickup with a 
separate bed and cab, unlike the Rabbit pickup.  It looks like it is purely 
for the work market.  It comes with one engine - a four cylinder diesel.  
The interior comes in one color - grey.

So I called my local dealer about both of them this morning.  They know 
nothing about the Taro, so I assume it is for other markets.  The update on 
the Eurovan is that they don't know when it will be back in the states.  
They first thought it would be in January, but now they just expect it 
sometime this year.  And this dealer didn't sound the least bit excited 
about it.

FWIW,
Dean
