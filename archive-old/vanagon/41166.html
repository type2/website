Subject: Re: news group


&gt;&gt;There is no polling, there is no discussion.  It's Gerry's mailing list.
&gt;&gt;If someone wants to make a Newsgroup, then do it.
&gt;
&gt;I resent the idea that this is one persons' mailing list.  If this is the
&gt;case, I'd rather not be here.  I don't want to be intruding on someone's
&gt;personal territory.


Of course it is. Gerry's gone to a lot of effort to set up and maintain
it, and has graciously invited us into his house as guests. Same rules
apply here as in the case of a guest in your house: If your host invites
you in, you're not intruding. If you become obnoxious, he can kick you
out. You can start your own list any time, with or without anyone else's
approval (except your ISP).

I am thankful to Gerry for providing us this forum, and I try not to abuse
his hospitality. Occasionally I succeed. Most list members (&quot;guests&quot;) are
very good about this, and we make a great big happy family. If someone
wants to start a newsgroup (or another list) to try to lessen his burden
(or Gerry's burden), that's not a terrible thing. Go for it!
