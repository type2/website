Subject: Re: Help? test fuel injector, 78 Westy.


The Muir Idiot book says to pressurize the ring main (with injectors out)
by just running fuel pump (few seconds of ignition on, turn off, repeat--
more than 2 or 3 drops of fuel coming out of injector, the seat is worn;
you can try cleaning it by pushing on the end to let gas spray out, and let
close. Repeat pressurization for each injector.  Check spray by killing
coil wire and turning over engine as injector is watched- will spray for
2-10 millisec. and stop.         MB in NJ
