Subject: Re: 9-pass vanagons

&gt;James:  I note you have an '83 9-passenger vanagon. Is &gt;this one with a 
&gt;bench-style front seat and a partitian behind selfsame &gt;front seat?  If 
&gt;so, I just got myself a similar '82, which is serving me &gt;well.But I'd 
&gt;never seen one before, or had many other whom were asked &gt;about it.  Know 
&gt;anything about these?  (Like, intended as, say, crew &gt;vehicles for 
&gt;gas &amp; electric companies or something?) Cheers, Art McGinn &gt;(San Francisco)



I'm not sure what you mean. Does the partion which you refer to go all the way 
to the ceiling?  If so, mine does not.  

But, ALL 9 passenger busses and vans have a solid partion which runs the width 
of it just behind the front seats.  This was used to give the bus/van frame more 
ridgidity.  By the way, the busses (breadloafs and splities) had the ability to 
turn the middle bench seat around so it faced backward.  We liked that 
arrangement so much we had the floor drilled so we could do that with the van!  
It makes entering the back easier, gives more cargo room, makes more a more open 
feeling in the back, and allows the rear passengers to talk to each other.  It's 
probably safer too.  

Just thought I'd throw that in.

James
