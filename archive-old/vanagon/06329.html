No answers here, only commiseration!  I've had very similar problems, 
even in less forceful winds, in my '91 Westy.  VERY nasty at times;  
indeed I think truly hazardous.  Have had to reduce speed to 40 MPH to 
accomodate the problem.  

Actually, this was the problem that prompted meto post the inquiry 
regarding tires a few weeks ago, but apparently (at least for me) the 
answer lies elsewhere (I'm running the, generally, highly regarded,  
reinforced Michelin MXL's _at_ 35/40 PSI).  The effect I experience is  
actually more like a ducking and bobbing, combined with lateral 
&quot;feinting&quot;  - sort of like a boxer - rather than pure lateral 
motion.  It's even a problem in nearly still wind conditions (though not 
so severe as to be hazardous - just annoying and tiring), when there's a 
lot of semi-trailer traffic ahead of me.  Sort of like the &quot;clear air 
turbulence problem caused by large jet's at airports.  The dealer claims 
this is normal!  Curiously, my '82 camper (w/o pop-top) handled much 
better - really not a problem at all.  Different tires too (Continentals 
_at_ about 40/50 PSI).  One tire shop suggested that it could be a tread 
pattern factor, rather than sidewall stiffness.  Claimed that the 
Michelin MXL's were naturally &quot;squirelly&quot;.  I'm also considering some 
suspension mod's, such as a sway bar, but don't expect that would do much 
for the ducking and bobbing effect.  Shocks, BTW, seem excellent (and of 
course this has been a problem since the vehicle was new).  I don't know 
what else to say, other than DRIVE CAREFULLY!
