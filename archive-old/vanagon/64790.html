Subject:      re EV Camper Tires

someone local recently recommended these tires as good for a 95 EV:

&gt;Tires: Mounted Michelin MXL 205/65-14 (reinforced) tires. Much improved
&gt;ride, quieter, smoother compared to Goodyear.

are you folks with tires going &quot;out of round&quot; rotating the tires at regular
intervals? is the van sitting for periods of time (say 1-2 weeks) between
driving intervals?
