Oh let me answer this.  I have two boys that wear this tape into the  
ground.

Hakuna Matada is a song that came from the movie &quot;The Lion King&quot;.  It  
means &quot;no worries&quot;, and sticks in your head like that  &quot;It's a small  
world after all&quot;  remember that?  I'll bet you do, and now you can  
all thank me for reminding you.   All together now, It's a small  
world after all

&gt;Ahhhh! there it is again!  Everyone has been saying that this week!
&gt;What language is it?  What does it mean?  Why have I never heard of  
&gt;it
&gt;before this week and suddenly hearing it everywhere?
