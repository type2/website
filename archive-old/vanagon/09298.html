Subject: Re: ADVICE NEEDED.

&gt;&gt; Please advise on:
&gt;&gt; 71 camper top bus, has no propane tank under door like I've seen before.
&gt;&gt; Has 1 very well siezed motor, 1600 dp rebuilt once, and will need new heads, 
&gt;&gt; one has a spark plug hole
&gt;&gt; which has been helicioled and blew out.
&gt;&gt; Body good, little rust, one ding in door, but small.
&gt;&gt; Can anyone ID. the vehicle for me- that is whats the type of camper?
&gt;
&gt;I'm not sure what you mean by &quot;type of camper&quot;.. on a '71, if  it
&gt;has a fiberglas top hinged in the front, with a tent and a single
&gt;cot up above, a sink, table, bed and closet inside with no stove,
&gt;it is probably a Westphalia Campmobile (check for a metal tag by
&gt;the bottom of the closet door), the most prevalent camper top bus,
&gt;as you put it.  There were a couple of other firms which modified
&gt;VW busses into campers. If it is a one-piece fiberglas top with
&gt;windows, that doesn't tilt, it is probably one of these.
&gt;
&gt;What's most important it whether you are right for it, and is
&gt;it right for you.  This sounds silly, but the people here will
&gt;tell you that keeping an old bus alive is a labor of love. Yeah,
&gt;other bussers will wave at you on the highway, and people at
&gt;McDonalds will tell you how neat the old bus is, but are you
&gt;ready to embrace the fact that you will be fighting a never-ending
&gt;battle with entropy, that you will go everywhere slowly, you
&gt;will always drive with at least one ear open for bad noises,
&gt;you will spend many weekends with the darn thing apart in a
&gt;million pieces while you try and track down the one piece they
&gt;haven't built in 20 years, &amp;c &amp;c &amp;c....?? How important is heat
&gt;to you? If you live in a cold area, be prepared for arctic
&gt;conditons inside the bus.

Thanks Todd-
I am currently the owner of a light cream (impossible to match paint) 76' 
Mercades Benz 300D.  With 163K on the all original engine which has just 
sprung a leak from the front main seal.  Here's the catch- you can't buy one 
seal... you have to buy the whole gasket set.  Wanna know how much? $260.  I 
know about hard to find parts and so on.  It still has all orig. exhaust on 
it which needs to be replaced. Around $550 for parts alone!!

Until about 4 weeks ago the car had no blower motor.  The heat had to be on 
par with that of a VW.

&gt;Have you been around VWs much? Why do you want one? I'm not
&gt;trying to give you a hard time, but this is important.  If
&gt;you've been lurking here for any time, you have a glimpse of
&gt;what it means to own an old VW.  If you go for it, we'll all
&gt;be behind you and supportive, but we want you to know what
&gt;you're getting into! :-&gt;

When I was very young my dad rebuilt VW's all the time.  He had a 64' bug 
and a 72' SB.
I'm hooked.

&gt;As for price, I paid $1550 for my '71 five years ago, with a
&gt;decent engine, so that price sounds pretty good to me.
&gt;
&gt;I don't mean to speak for this esteemed assembly, but I feel
&gt;pretty confident that my sentiment is fairly representative.
&gt;
&gt;Know also that everyone here will willingly give encouragement,
&gt;but you're the only one who can decide if it is right for you.

Thanks
Chris Bridge.
