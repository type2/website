Subject: I'm so dizzy

What is the correct distributor for an '81 Vanagon.  I thought these were 
supposed to be pointless (don't say it), but as I slapped the new cap and 
rotor on, lo and behold, points.  Would this be a concern as to which cap 
and rotor I should have?  Hard to tell which one this is, but the numbers 
I *could* read were: Z42 / 0 231 170 093 / 022 905 2055  (this while 
standing on my head).  BTW, the reason for the recent downturn in the 
Vanagon's state of tune seemed to be a &quot;nipple&quot; (be careful now) welded 
on the points that I *think* was caused by the cigarette lighter being 
stuck in the &quot;in&quot; position for a couple of days.  Would this do something 
similar to the radio being left on in a car w/o an accessory position in 
the ignition switch?  I *told* my 7-year-old not to touch it. :(  I'm not 
a mechanic, nor do I play one on TV.  Thanks in advance for any light 
shedding. :-)
