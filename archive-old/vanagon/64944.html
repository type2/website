Subject:      Idle air regulater/stabilizer

Hello;  I visited my F(not so)LAPs to pick up an idle air stabilizer for my
87 GL.  I rang the bell after waiting 10 minutes, and watching the parts
guys in their little room ignoring me. When he did finally come out and
looked up the price he said $334.36 and that he would have to order it from
Toronto.  I can't help but wonder what the price would have been if I'd
patiently waited for him to get around to me. This was a VW dealer in
Victoria BC.  There's got to be a better way to do this.  I've lubed up the
old one, but it only lasts for 2 weeks each time I do it.  Or how much
should this cost?  Would it be a good idea to check the local auto wrecker,
or do these things wear out completely?  TIA  Larry Carter
