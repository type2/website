Subject: VW Interest

I was in an Antique shop the other day and came across a bunch of 1950's 
magazines. I was flipping through one called &quot;PIC&quot; (March 1955) and there 
was an article on the Volkswagen.

The article detailed VW's pre-war, war, rebuilding and after war history.

The most interesting part was the photographs of the old VW Bus. One photo 
show a family having a picnic outside their Bus. Both middle doors are open 
and there is a handy shelving unit on the rear middle door. There is also a 
canopy (if a canopy can be flat) coming out about four feet from the side of 
the bus, Everyone in the picture is having a GREAT time. It also showed the 
bus as an ambulance and the Swiss family Robinson taking a drive in the 
Rhineland. (I counted 5 adults and and 3 children) The bus had a canvas 
covered sun roof in the middle and the Microbus(?) windows at the top going 
down the sides

Other pictures show the amphious VWs, Pictures of the Wolfsburg works before 
during and after the war and Dr. Porsche with Hitler. If anyone is 
interested, I can scan the pictures.
