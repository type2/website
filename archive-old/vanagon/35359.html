Hi All-

OK, so now I have a '67 single cab to go with my 70's ('71 bus, '73
'vert) VW's.  It's got some differences, and I've got some questions.
I'd appreciate any feedback that some of you out there might have:

1. I did the two-nut front wheel bearing adjusting dance the other
day, and I sure do like those later model allen clamping nuts better.
Can I retrofit them?  Are they the same on bus and bug?  Do I have to
change the washer or anything?

2. The fresh air tubes go straight to the heater boxes; there are no
little bulbous things over the #2 and #4 exhaust pipes (BTW, it has an
extractor.  [sound of hand hitting forehead] Maybe that's my answer,
huh?  Why didn't I think of that before I started this message?).
Anyway, the heater works way better than either of my others,
especially in terms of air volume delivered into the cab.  I think I'm
gaining more in lack of air leakage than I'm losing by not scavenging
that extra heat.  Opinions?

3. I have the single bulb, two-filament tail lights, and I'm not sure
that they are working right.  My guess is that the one (lower wattage)
filament is for the running lights, and the other somehow does
combined brake/signalling duties.  This is what it seems to do, except
that with the brakes applied, the turn signals go crazy,  The rears do
not blink at all, and the fronts either cease blinking as well (left)
or blink at double speed (right). And the hazard lights blink the
indicator rapidly, but the outside lights don't go at all :-).  Much
of the wiring is non-factory and looks suspect to me. I have a wiring
diagram en route, but I would love to hear from somebody who can tell
me what they're _supposed_ to do....

4. I've got new vent wing latches and they look like they want to be
screwed in.  The (broken) ones in there seem to have some sort of
(press-fit?) plug/pin holding them in, and look like they'll need to
be drilled out.  Anybody BTDTGTTS and want to make any suggestions?

5. What's to know about trannies?  The fact that mine likes to pop out
of reverse makes me think I'm probably going to have to learn more
than I wanted to know :-). Does my '67 share with other years/models?
Can I adjust the linkage or something and fix it?  Any other info
you'd like to share?

Thanks in advance, 

-Mitch
