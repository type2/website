&gt; 	&quot;create a mini news group for coordinating meeting, repair plans

&gt; 
&gt; 	&quot;a sick-bus detail, maybe we can chip in for a stash of spares to
&gt; follow us around&quot; - assuming all of our busses require some repair 
however modest, we should be using this list for these problems. NOW 
is the time to start, why not state your needs and problems on this list, 
that is why we subscribe isn't it?

&gt; &gt; 	&quot;master list of repair shops (user  
recommended)&quot; again why not use this list for that purpose -we all have a 
stake in this information;
 &gt;
I for one have posted four or five technical questions without response 
(except from Joel who seems to know quite a bit). While preparing a trip 
is quite exciting it accounts for only a third of the people on this 
list. Sharing non-trivial information is the key to communication.

Please take this in the positive sense it was intended. 
 
&gt; just some ideas - DC
