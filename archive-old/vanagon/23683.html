Subject: key numbers

Hi all,

the lock of my sliding door is broken so I have to renew it. I only want a=
=20
new lock for my existing key. But there is a bit of trouble.

This small tag which is attached at one of the keys says &quot;VB 8767&quot;, but my=
=20
dealer stated that this key number is not a vanagon key number.

Does anybody know the exact sytematics for these numbers?

TIA

T.S.
83=B4vanagon
