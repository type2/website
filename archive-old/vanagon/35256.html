Subject: Re: gas heater fuel pump needed

&gt;There were two types of Eberspacher BN4 heaters, the 1971 and earlier model
&gt;and the 72-up.  The earlier model uses a diaphram pump while the later style
&gt;uses an in-line metering pump. Make sure you really need a new fuel pump
&gt;before buying a new one.  Run the pump straight off the battery and see if
&gt;it vibrates/pumps.  If it does, make sure voltage is getting to the pump at
&gt;the right time.  If you have the earlier style heater, it could be that your
&gt;temperature regulating switch is dirty or the cable has come loose leaving
&gt;the switch in the off position.  This will break the 12v to the pump.
&gt;
&gt;In any event, good luck.  I don't have a spare pump, but I'd be happy to
&gt;help you troubleshoot it if you have any more problems.  Maybe Tom Johnson
&gt;has a spare pump?  Tom, you out there??
&gt;

You rang?

Yeah, I've got pumps--but I'd bet that Ron is right in his diagnosis that
the pump isn't getting juice.  And even if the pump is broken it can often
be fixed.
let me know which BN 4 you have and I'll tell you how.

BTW the best source I've found for late model pumps and glow plugs is are
wrecked/junked 411's and 412's (which, last time I checked, is every last
one produced)  They all had BA 4 heaters which share quite a few parts with
the BN 4's and the BA 6's.
