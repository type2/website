&gt; one could pull the fuse behind the drivers seat to stop it.   or just 
&gt; live in a cold climate like some of us  :)
I just had to throw in my 2 cents worth regarding the cold climate ...
For all of you vanagon people whose fridge fan runs even though the fridge
is off, here in Bozeman right now it is a very nice 65 degrees. :)
