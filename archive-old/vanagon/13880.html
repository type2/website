Subject: tire chains

I put tire chains on my Vanagon for driving in mud and deep snow. They fit
just fine. I bought a set of &quot;cable chains&quot; from JC Whitney. These chains
are supposed to be for tires that have limited clearance situations but I
have found that there doesn't seem to be any clearance problem at all, so I
don't know why the manual says not to put chains on a syncro. I think you
can probably disregard what the manual says, at least based on my
experience. *And* I am running oversize tires which are a full 2&quot; taller
than the 205/14s that come on Vanagons with alloy wheels.

Anyway, I now feel that cable chains are sort of rinky dinky--I tend to
break them driving through rock filled mud holes--and so I want to buy a set
of more traditional chains. So my recomdndation is to buy more traditional
chains thinking that they will probably fit or if you want to be absolutely
sure then buy the cable chains that I have.

I must 'a paid about $60 for my cable chains at whitless.

&gt;I'm looking for a set of chains for my bus (205/75R14).
&gt;
&gt;If this is a vanagon, there is a note in my Syncro drivers manual NOT to put 
&gt;chains on this size tire, 195/75/14 is stated as OK. Those rear wheel wells 
&gt;are huge, lots of clearance but I don't have 205s on so I can't check. Nor 
&gt;do my snow chains reach that big (195 max). I can look here for chains, it's 
&gt;spring, they may be cheap, the Canadian dollar certainly is!  lemme know 
&gt;
