I have a copy (or most ot anyway) of the Official Service Manual I think.
Sounds like the same Green/blue covered one.  :-)

&gt; 
&gt; 	Tracey,
&gt; 	According to the green-cover Official VW Bus Service Manual
&gt; from Robert Bentley, there is a thermostat the engine of a '72, or
&gt; any other air-cooled, Kombi engine. 
&gt; 
&gt; 	I've got the Bentley and the Idiot's book. What are you 
&gt; using for reference?
