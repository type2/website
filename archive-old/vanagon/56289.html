Subject: Need Westy little doors...

Rats.  I scraped the side of my '80 Westy in a parking garage.  Didn't touch
the metal on the concrete column, but instead clipped the three little plastic
covers on the side.

Happily, the covers were all already missing, and the plastic was already
totally shot, so the damage was to parts that really needed replacing anyway.

It just upped the priority.

I need all three of the little covers and the plastic frames that attach to
the body.  Any help would be appreciated.  Even if you know a place to get
these new (I just gave away my WCM catalog).
