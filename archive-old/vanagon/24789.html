Subject: Re: Info for new engine?

I have only ordered one engine and that came (eventually) from MoFOCO. I 
had a lot of trouble with them send the wrong studs and not tapping the 
threads for the oil sensor.  My uncle order engine parts from them also 
and they forgot totally about him.  The delay was aggravating.  On the 
good side I haven't had any problems with the engine performing, but I've 
heard much better things about GEX.
