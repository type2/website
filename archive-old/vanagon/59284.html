Yes, stand very clear of it!  I know that's not what you meant.  VW engines
are hard to put out and the gasses are poisenous.  Engines on fire are an
extreme danger.  If there is no threat to life, I prefer to let them burn.
 Bumpers on cars are shock supported which under heat can turn the bumper
into a projectile, the fumes are leathel and then there is always the danger
(although less likely) of an exploding gas tank.

My preference of fire extinquishers for burning engines (any car) are (in
order):
1.  200 gallons per minute of water through a sheet metal probe
2.  Stand clear and cry while it burns
3.  A type D fire (burning metal) extinquisher 
4.  A toss up between chemical and CO2 extinquishers

The best solution with Vans/bugs, etc... I've found is 1) replace fuel line
hoses/clamps on a regular basis (&amp; make sure they are securly attached), and
2) keep the engine compartment clean from insulation, debry, etc...

Just my .02.
