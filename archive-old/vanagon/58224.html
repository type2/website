Subject: Handling Improvements

I have an 87 &quot;westie&quot; that is in dire need of tires, wheels, and a new
suspension.  Here is what I would like to do with it.....

1)Replace trashed steel wheels with 15&quot; alloys.
2)Use lower profile 60 or 70 series tires.
3)New shocks (or is it struts??) all around and potentially stiffer
springs.  I would like to lower the front end slightly from its stock
configuration.
4)Potentially add anti sway bars.

Questions for you fellow VW fanatics...
1)Does anyone have any comments, ideas, experience with any of the
above???
2)Does anyone know where I can find performance parts to do a job like
this???
3)I am concerned about finding suitable tires if I go to 15&quot; wheels.
I have met several people that have done this to there vans and they
said that handling improved significantly even without the heavy duty
Mich 205/70 R14's.
4)Also looking for the stock wolfsburg front air dam and side skirts to
round out the upgrade.  Anyone know where to look for them???  Since my
bumpers are trashed I would like to get the molded covers that go along
with all this too....
5)Do the KYB shocks that I have seen advertised for the Vanagon allow 
the ride to be adjusted??  I want to be able to around corners in a 
decent fasion.

I know I have alot of questions here....but hopefully you can help me
out.

I greatly appreciate any help!
Thanks,
Chet
