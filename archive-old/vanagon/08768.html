So J. Meade says:
&gt; 
&gt; I mentioned at the very onset that I had a slight coolant smell that I 
&gt; associated with the rear heater.  I think I was told this could wait, but 
&gt; now I'm wondering if it isn't intimately related with letting air in the 
&gt; system?  

I'm almost positive your bleed screw for the rear heater is leaking Jim.
Your above mentioning about the slight coolant smell tipped me off.  I
don't know if you have a drain hole for the underseat compartment, but
another tip-off is a slow drip on the drivers side just behind (FIF) the
propane tank, there might be a puddle of coolant.  I found this before
I realized I had a leak and thought it was either excess water dripping
from my car.  Later I thought I might have a leak in my roof.  Finally
after checking under the bench seat and removing the heater cover, the
lights came on in my head.  I wouldn't let this situation continue for
too long.  Just get the $2.00 bleeder screw and replace the old one
ASAP.  I didn't experience any overheating problems with this leak
although you sound like yours has been going on for a while.

And I'm the fifth one I think to ad nauseaum to the raise the front
of the van theory when bleeding the system.  Just do it! ;P
