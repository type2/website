Subject: Re: passed by a jetta


I was passed by a Jetta today. I was merging from hwy 85 into hwy101. 
I thought I was driving really fast (near 65 mph). But this Jetta GL behind
me thought I wasn't fast enough and decided to pass me. He suddenly moved
next to me at my left. And again he suddenly was in front of me. All
these happened in a blink quietly. I realized that vanagon must be really
slow no matter what speed I was at. On the other hand, I was amazed by the
speed of this Jetta. Maybe the ramp of the merging hwy is a down slope
that makes it able to move so fast without much engine rumbling.

I have been driving 50 miles a day commuting with my vanagon for a year.
That is too much a waste for vanagon miles. Maybe it's time to get a Jetta?
