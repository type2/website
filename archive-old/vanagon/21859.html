Subject:       Re: Tools &amp; Xenophobia

Yes, I agree with Thom here.  The Asian tools, in general, just don't 
do the job right.... wrenches are loose fitting, adjusters don't hold 
their settings properly, breaking, ... just not high quality stuff, 
IMHO.  I usually never buy Asian tools unless I have to.  I've ruined 
too many bolts, etc with ill - fitting tools.... but then I'm not a 
mechanic, either ;)

&gt; Is it me, or are all taiwanese/chinese/etc tools CRAP!  
&gt; (if its not scottish...)
&gt; 
&gt; I destroyed all three of the chinese body hammers I bought last weekend.
&gt; The sad things was, one of them was the only one I'd found with this
&gt; particular style of head...  
&gt; 
&gt; Now I wonder if I'll break the dollies.  I didn't think I could, but 
&gt; after I shattered (thats right, shattered) one of the hamme heads I'm 
&gt; not so sure.
&gt; 
&gt; This is not my first experience with such implements of self destruction.
&gt; I see some tools in the stores and wonder what they were thinking when
&gt; the designed them.  Sheesh!
&gt; 
&gt; I have never had a problem with an american tool, or german, for that matter.
&gt; reasonable success with a japanese ratchet, until I put a 4 1/2' cheater
&gt; pipe on it... (D'oh!)  My Astro (Japanese, I think) paint gun is pretty good.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyone else feel the same way?  It seems the market it flooded with this
&gt; crap!
&gt;
