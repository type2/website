Subject:  Re: dashboard alters

        Everything I put on my dash flies off when I corner like some kind
of crazy moron in a sports car. Great fun in a '70... Although it doesn't
matter how fast you're going-if you're in a bus you *must* be going slow.
&quot;Hurry up Marge, pass the slow hippie bus so we can go 55mph in front of
it&quot;. Never mind the fact that it's doing 65... ;-)

        I *do* have a picture of Mother Mary up by my rearview-has the
Magnificat on the back *in spanish*! Left over from the PO, I kinda like
the wierdness of it...

Peace,
