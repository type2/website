&gt;&gt;I notice from reading the manual that the A/C compressor is prevented from
&gt;&gt;coming on if the outside temperature is 50
&gt;&gt;degrees or less. Does this mean that if you plan to run it every
&gt;&gt;two weeks during the winter that you should do so inside a
&gt;&gt;heated, inside garage or you are not benefiting your system?

&gt;hmmmmmm. hadn't thought of that! :)  i keep forgetting that lots of folks
&gt;live up there in winters that never get about freezing. ;)  i would think
&gt;that if you heated up the interior of the bus, and then turned on the a/c
&gt;with the temp control (a/c, that is) turned to max, it should work. i think
&gt;the thermostat is inside the bus and the compressor kick-switch is controlled
&gt;by that ... that is, it's the inside temp that controls it, not the outside
&gt;temp.

As I posted earlier in the fall, I use the A/C in conjunction with heat for 
heavy-duty dehumidification (the kind you need when 4 soaking adults and 2 wet 
dogs climb in the bus after a mushroom foray).

My observations are that the inside temp is the critical factor in kicking in 
the compressor, not the outside temp. I've definitely had it running with 
outside temps in the upper 30s, but have had difficulty getting it to kick in 
when the inside of the bus is below what I would guess to be about 50.
