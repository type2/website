&gt; 
&gt; Regarding the late 70s fit:  The Porsche engine is taller than the Type 4 pan-
&gt; cake, especially if you use a CIS engine.  On the Vanagon, all the extra 
&gt; height is within the bounds of the engine lid, so you need to modify an engine
&gt; lid, not the van.  The breadloafs either have no hatch over the engine (&quot;Gen-
&gt; tlemen, start your Sawzalls&quot;) or a hatch that I think may be too small.  So
&gt; you would need some bodywork on the back deck to get the extra inches of air-
&gt; space you need over the engine.
&gt; 
&gt; Your van's a little lighter and more aero than a Vanagon, tho': Could be hot!
&gt; B.

  The engine compartment on the 70's bus is tall enough to accomodate an 
  upright-fan VW engine (similar in dimensions to a 912 engine). Is the
  911 engine taller then the 912's?  The height of the rear &quot;deck&quot; in a 70's
  bus is taller than that of the Vanagon, but I don't know by how much. How
  much height clearance did you have to add to the Vanagon engine lid?

  Did you make any notes of drawings of the rear engine bearer that you made
  so that it might be copied? What about the sheet metal engine surrounds?

  Thanks!
