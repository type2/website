Subject: Mill Supply battery trays for Breadloafs:

	Folks,
	Got the Mill Supply catalog of VW rust repair pannels
today. They list sheet metal for Busses, 50-67 and 68-79 and Vanagons.

	You'll recall that The Bus Stop and The Bus Boys sell battery
trays that fit my '70 single cab for $70-75, while the comparable
pannel for a regular Bus/Transporter is $25-27 from Bus Stop (RMM)
and probably $30-32 from Bus Boys.

	You'll also recall that I bought the Bus Boy's part, and
it proved to be about 1 1/4 inch (30mm roughly) too narrow!!! A call
to The Bus Stop got them to measure theirs and it's the same part,
with the same shiny, dark-red, primer on it. So there I am, out $75
and with a repair part that's better than nothing, but not perfect.

	Mill supply lists the same three battery trays that Bus Stop does,
but check the prices:

	Part:			The Bus Stop:		Mill Supply
Battery Tray, 68-72		85104  $26.95		402-68-71  $30.25
Battern Tray, 73-79		85103  $24.95		402-73-72  $30.25
Battery Tray, Pickup, 68-79	85105  $69.95		406-68-73  $25.56 &lt;-

	Whoopee! There is SOME justice!! Assuming this isn't a misprint
of course. I've checked, and Mill Supply don't list a 402-68-72, so
the obvious misprint isn't the answer!

	So, feeling like I have little to lose, I called Mill Supply
this afternoon and ordered one of their pannels. In theory, I have
an appointment to weld in the replacement this weekend, but I bet
we can remove the old and do the clean-up and wait a day or two
to see which is better (Or if they're the same!).

	My 30 days to return the ill-fitting tray to The Bus Boys
has probably passed, and who knows, their tray may be better! So
I'll sort this out when I've got both in hand. Given the effort
required to weld-in the replacement, getting a good part in the first
place seems like the right move.

	I'm going to have to learn how to weld one of these days...

	Does anyone have a recomendation on a source for the
large, rectangular, cargo-hatch locks that go on the under-bed
doors of my single-cab? They match up to a door-style striker,
and appear to be a unique part. Both were locked when I bought
the truck and I had to drill one out for access. :-(
