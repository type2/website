Laurie, there's a guy in North Carolina that makes screens for vans.  I
bought a pair of front window screens from him about 14 months ago and
they work fine (about $35).  When last I talked to him, he also said he
makes the rear hatch screens and screens for the sliding door opening
(about $50 - $60, I think).  However, he mentioned that they are a bit
more cumbersome than the other types he makes.  I think he might have
said they have a zipper up the middle of them so you can leave them in
place, but I don't remember.  I'm also pretty sure that he sells them to
JC Whitney.  He is:
	Cloyce Buchanan
	Triad Magnetic Van Screens
	4155 Friendship-Ledford Road
	Winston-Salem, NC 27107
	910-769-2427

Also, several of the list members have one of those awnings.  Or ask an
RV dealer or get a Camping World (Camper's World ?) catalog.  They are
easy to fit to a vanagon.
