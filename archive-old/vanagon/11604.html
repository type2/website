Christopher Bridge quoth:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;now, do any of you happen to know where this company called Sportsmobile
&gt; &gt;actually is?
&gt; 
&gt; I don't know, but I think I have one of these on my 71 bus.  I mentioned 
&gt; that mine pops straight up and nobody had heard of it.  Anyone have any 
&gt; pic's or something like that?  I really want to get mine on the road to get 
&gt; to a get-together, maybe someone can ID this.
&gt;  
I've seen two of these designs at shows (BTW thanx for posting the article, 
Martha!).  One was a canvas affair with two long narrow cots; another was 
a sort of accordionized plastic.  I'll try to get 'em scanned in &amp; put up.

This gives us:
Westfalia
Dormobile
Sportsmobile
anyone know of other poptop vendors and their respective years?  More 
anal-retentive trivia for the FAQ!

BTW saw a ford van with a poptop yesterday.  Cool.  Didn't catch the mfr 
name, tho.

**ANNOUNCE** New Account!  Westy Tent pages will be moving!  Owner tired 
(but appreciative) of slow Freenet machine!  Look for details here!***
