Subject: RE: Buses on the Blue Ridge

        Can't do the Blue Ridge :( this weekend as it's the last weekend 
        before school is out for us (too many snow days!) and I have to 
        get all of the d/p stuff ready to record grades and shut down for 
        the year.  That's in addition to teaching my 2 classes and riding 
        herd on our 100 8th graders.  Bummer, because it's just a bad 
        time for me but good for every one else.  See you the 25th for 
        sure.
