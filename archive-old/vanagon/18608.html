Subject: three '71 busses at Great Basin National Park
Date: Fri,  2 Jun 1995 12:07:13 GMT


A few weeks ago my wife and I took the kids to Great Basin National
Park (formerly Lehman Caves National Monument) in norhteastern
Nevada. When we pulled up to the visitors center there were two '71
busses parked next to each other with a vacant space on the right.
Well, I just had to park next to them. We got out of our '71 bus and
took some pictures of all three '71 busses in a row.  Then we went
into the visitors center, and when we came back out a little later,
the owners of the other two '71 busses were taking pictures. So we
all took pictures together and recited the littany of the greatness
of the '71 bus.
