&gt;You could get rich doing this for a living...
&gt;What year-model is yours?  I doubt that you could do the reduction-gear
&gt;years in this time, or I'd pay you next time (other than the shipping and
&gt;handling charges across The Big Pond would be prohibitive).
&gt;
I've never tried it on a bus with reduction boxes, but on bay-window buses 
(and beetles) it is an easy job. It takes a bit of wresting (and a knack) to 
get the springplate off the splines without first dismantling the backplate, 
but this saves a lot of time and you don't have to worry about messing up 
the alignment.
