Subject: Need HELP in Northern California!


My wife and I have always talked about flying West from Philly, and 
driving a Westy back east to see the country. Well, the right deal 
turned up and I took the plunge.  

I just bought an '83 water-cooled Westy in San Francisco.  My wife 
and I plan to fly there from Philadelphia near the end of the 
summer, and use this Westy to drive east.

Now I need two things on very short notice:
1. 	Somewhere to park the Westy for several months
2. 	Someone who can go over the Westy thoroughly and determine	
	what, if anything, needs fixing in preparation for a 		
	cross-country drive.

I am having difficulty making these arrangements from Philly. The 
previous owner is leaving town Thursday, and will drop the Westy 
wherever I tell him to (or I can have it hauled if the destination 
is too far), but I don't have any leads on where to send it.

If you know of someone who has room for me to park this van there 
for a while, or who can check out the van (and repair or arrange 
repairs if neccessary), I will pay a fair price for either.

The possibility has even occured to me of allowing someone to use 
the Westy a bit, in exchange for holding it (or even renting it out 
for the entire spring and summer), if there is a way to do that 
with regard to insurance, etc.  

Can anyone provide advice or assistance?
