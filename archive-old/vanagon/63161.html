Subject:      detail

Janet-

If you decide you wanna go the &quot;pro&quot; detailing route, BE CAREFUL!  Here
in car-crazy L.A., I see victims of cruddy detail work, namely SWIRL
MARKS on brand new Porsches, Bimmers, etc.! Thanks for ruining my clear
coat for $200 on my $50,000 car dude!  Swirl marks are caused by
detailers using the wrong products with the improper equipment, thereby
&quot;cutting&quot; or swirling the clear coat.  The Clear Coat is the ONLY line
of defense the paint has, so proper care is key.

Swirl marks are easy to spot on a sunny day.  The paint SHOULD be like a
mirror when finished (&quot;hey, I can see myself!&quot;); swirl victims will look
like, well, swirls.

If you decide to do it yourself (or w/helpers), you'll spend only around
$20-40 for products, and maybe a buddy has a buffer you can borrow.  My
system:

1. Use products by Meguirs (paint cleaner, polish, wax (in that order))
2. NEVER use dish/other detergent--only CAR wash stuff
3. Never wash/polish/wax in direct sun
4. Always towel/chamois/etc. dry; don't air dry
5. Depending on climate/useage, wash twice a month, wax 4-6 times year
or so.
6.  It's a big van with a big roof--don't forget that roof!

Have fun!
