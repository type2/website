Okay...
Here are a few ideas from the nasty little mind of SStones...

#1:

You'll need an ignition coil, a spark plug, a short straight length of 
exhaust pipe, and some gunpowder and ballbearings that fit snuggly in 
the pipe.

seal one end of the pipe with a metal plate welded on, drill and tap the 
plate to accept the spark plug, mount the pipe to the rear of the van
like an extra exhaust pipe, stuff in some gun powder, pack it down tight 
with the ball bearing...
wire the extra coil to a button on the dash...

You get the idea.

Only fires once per trip unless you pull over and re-load...
You might be able to claim it as a rusty backfire if it goes to court...?



#2:   Much safer.

Drill two holes in to an oil bottle lid, epoxy the lid to somthing in the 
engine compartment, run some tubing through them...
Set up end of one tube where it'll drip on either the exhaust manifold
(may be messy) or on the catalytic conv (hey... Etra rustproofing for 
the engine compartment.

You could either hook up the other end to a compresser and switch,
or leave it near the dash where you can manually blow into it.

Seal the lid holes up well...
Screw on an oil bottle...

Instant smoke screen device

note, to make it even better, you could make it run through a hole to the
inside of the exhaust (preferabla after the lambda)... Then it'll look 
like you've simply blown a seal (Uh.. No that's just Mayo from lunch).

#3 

Hook up an electro magnet under the rear bumper, wire it to the dash
so that you can turn it off, stick an old used rusty muffler to it...
When the tailgator gets sweet, drop it...

You may save hundreds of VW vans from thess particular 'gators with
each bombadier run.  
Works better with the NEVER magnets mounted.  :)
