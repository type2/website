Subject: Low mileage 81 Westy for sale
Date: Tue, 6 May 1997 11:45:47 -0700

Why would anyone pay this price for a 16 year old car.  The Kelly Blue
Book Retail in Excellent Condition for an 82 is $6150 with the stove.  I
recently purchased a clean 82 GL Vanagon with engine problems for $1000.

&gt;For sale 81 Westy at local vw dealer. Spoke to salesman who told 
&gt;me: Beige, 59,000 original miles, pop top with all camping except stove
&gt;(looks like it never had one). Smith VW is located in northern Delaware 
&gt;near where I live. If anyone would like more info I will try to get over 
&gt;to drive/look at it. If interested call Pat Smith at Smith VW (302)
&gt;998-0131. $7900.00 Pat says is in great condition in and out and why
&gt;would a salesman lie?
&gt;Dave 84 westy (same color)
