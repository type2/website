&gt; Greetings!
&gt; Would like to thank all those who responded re: Oil switch. We still have
&gt; not located the problem, but we have many more things to check now. Thanks
&gt; again.
&gt; 
&gt; More propane questions:
&gt; 
&gt; Pilot light viewfinder in fridge has been melted and patched with epoxy.
&gt; How would one know from there after if the fridge lights on gas?
&gt; (It has never been known to work on gas. Owner never got it going.)
&gt; 
&gt; There is a PIP (pilot) tube laying down on bottom left hand side, inside
&gt; the air vent across front of bottom of fridge. It has a small brass plug
&gt; that unscrews.
&gt; 
&gt; What is the tube's purpose? Can one use this to light the fridge, if the
&gt; ignitor doesn't light?  Fridge does work on 12v and 110v. He has basic
&gt; manuals, but
&gt; nothing mentions this.
&gt; 
&gt; Any suggestions?
&gt; Thanks in advance.
&gt; 
&gt; Louise
