Subject: Re: Advice needed: Trouble after engine rebuild
Date: Mon, 26 Dec 94 18:06:50 PST

So Dave Phillips says:
&gt; seemed fine for the first 50 miles, and then I started to
&gt; lose power.  Now there is a loud growl from the crankcase and she
&gt; doesn't idle so good.  Can anyone offer advice as to what might
&gt; be wrong, and how I could have caused this?  Second, I'm currently
&gt; 35 miles from home -- should I call a tow truck, or have I already
&gt; done the damage I'm going to do and just drive it home?
&gt; 

I'll bet it's your valves that need adjusting.  Be sure to tow it.
I've heard too many times in the past that just after an engine
rebuild that people have blown up their engine because no-one was
checking the valve clearances during the break-in period or the
heads loosened enough to screw up the clearance.  Get that baby
home or to your rebuild mechanic and get the heads re-torqued and
the valves adjusted.  And yes, this can happen within 50 miles of
the rebuild.  I've seen it before.  If no damage was done, be sure
to keep a sharp eye on those valves until they wear in properly.

Hope this helps,

Steven
