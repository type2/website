Subject: vanagon brakes

My brakes on my 84 vanagon are acting funny.  With the engine on, the
brake pedal hits a stop of some kind and the vanagon slows down but I
am unable to make the tires skid.  If I pump the brake pedal once, I
then able to make the tires skid.  If the engine is off, I do not feel
a physical stop with the brake pedal and the brakes seem to work correctly.
I took the vanagon to a vw service expert and he said that he had never seen
anything like it before.

I suspect that there is a problem with the vacuum assist in the master
cylinder.  Since the brakes work correctly with the engine off, I do not
suspect low brake fluid or air in brake lines.

Has anyone seen this symptom before?
