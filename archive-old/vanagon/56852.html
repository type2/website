Subject: syncro front cv joints

Hi everyone-

I've been out of touch for quite a while.  We just moved into a new house
with lots of room in the garage to work on the syncro.  I've got a problem
that i've had before but would like to fix myself.  My front CV boot is
ripped and the outer driver side joint is beginning to knock.  I've purchased
the boot and all the goodies thinking it wouldn't be that bad to fix.  I've
replaced boots on my previous 78' bus without any problems.  The syncro is a
different animal.  I've been told that the entire bearing housing needs to be
removed before the shaft can be taken out.  Whats the scoop??  If so what
tools, will i need and what things do i need to look out for??  your help
will be appreciated much more than the look i get from the local dealer.
 ching ching. :)

Thanks
Mike
