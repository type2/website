Subject: (headsup) wasserboxer cooling system failure dujour

I followed with much amusment the recent thread on whether the
cooling system is adequate to the task keeping the beast cool,
especially in warm climates.  The answer is yes and no.  

If EVERYTHING is in working order, then even in 95+ &amp; high humidity with
the AC running, all is well.  The trouble is, the whole thing is so damn
FRAGILE.  

Today, after seeing a new puddle under the engine, I started chasing the
leak.  Turns out that yet another plastic piece (cheaper than metal
which works) has failed.  Directly above the drive shaft (passenger side)
is a black plastic &quot;tower&quot; where the left and right hoses connect to
both the heater hose and the main radiator hose. 

The heater hose connection was &quot;loose&quot; and upon wiggling it, broke off
in my hand.  It's bloody obvious that a piece of plastic this small
simply cannot withstand the stress from a length of hose hanging off
it!   

I urge all of you to carefully check this connection next time you are
peeking under the car.

*whew*  I feel better now ...
