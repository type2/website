Subject: My Kombi is now official!

Hi volks--

I'm proud to say that my '62 Kombi has now fulfilled its destiny of being
both a passenger and commercial vehicle.  I had a gig last night and I
transported my harpsichord to it in the bus.  The Westy bed makes a great
cushioned platform for transporting fragile stuff.

Of course, VW A.G. might not have envisioned typical deliveries being made
in black tie.  :-)
