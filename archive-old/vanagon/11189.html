    I have an '81 westy and was thinking about a auxillary battery for 
    camping. I have a auxillary heater, so this would come in handy as well 
    as using the radio and lights etc. Is there anyone who has done this 
    procedure who has an opinion? I went to JC Whitney and there set-ups do 
    not accommodate a stock Bosch alternator. ---Steevo---

My dad always had a couple of batteries
in parallel in his '63, no other mods.
Or are you talking about how it fits
mechanically?
