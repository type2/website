Subject: 71 westy

A while back, I posted Advice Needed about a 71 westy.  Well, yesterday I ....

Snagged it!!  drug it home With the Benz 300D.  Amazing what a 3 liter 
diesel will do.  

Dropped the motor last night, and am taking it apart today.
I'll keep everyone posted about the progress.

I do have a question about parts suppliers though.
There seems to be many companies selling rebuild kits.  Like includes: 
Rebuilt Rods, crank, etc.  I am concerned about the quality of these parts, 
as the price varies so much.  Has anyone insight on who sells good quality 
rebuild kits??
Thanks
