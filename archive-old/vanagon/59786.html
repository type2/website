     Why doesn't your battery discharge when you leave your refrigerator on 
     for months?
     
     That's one hell of a deep cycle battery you got there.

I know this contradicts other advice you have received, but this is my 
experience... I nearly always forget to turn it off, sometimes leave it 
on for months.  No harm done.
