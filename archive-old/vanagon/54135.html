&gt;| The &quot;Y&quot; ends are plastic, also, and they dry out and crack with age, I am
&gt;| told.  The &quot;Y&quot; ends are pressure applied or laminated in some way to the
&gt;| plastic pipe. They may or may not come out of the ends of the pipe,
&gt;| according to how deterioriated the &quot;Y&quot; elements are.  So you may have to
&gt;| buy the whole unit from VW for about $32.00, including grommets for the two
&gt;| ends each on the &quot;Y&quot; fittings.

	I haven't looked into the Bentley so I may be talking out my *** here,
but this seems like one of those tasks where suitable metal Ys could/should
be substituted for the plastic ones. Otherwise one would be just crawling
under the car again in a year to replace the replaced dried out Ys (especially
if you live in an area that has reforumlated gas which is know to advance
degradation of certain rubbers and plastics (but none is making new cars with
these so it is not a &quot;problem&quot;)... Again, just thought...
