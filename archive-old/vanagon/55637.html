Subject: EV Piston Slap Wrap-up

I picked up the &quot;Milk Truck&quot; (White EV MV with Berkeley Farms license plate
frames) up from the dealer.  New pistons and crank bearings replaced under
warranty.  The very loud diesel noise is gone on starting but the motor is
still noisy (I'm not complaining just making a point that this isn't a
purring motor).  I got hit with paying one hour of labor at $75 to diagnose
the problem.  Yea, I feel nickle and dimed but reflecting on it I got a
needed oil change and an exterior and interior wash out of it.  I can live
with paying $75 dollars for 2K parts, labor, and the oil change and wash. 
Thanks to all for the info and E-mail me if I can help with your situation.

Ken
