Subject: brick aerodynamics



	While I'm babbling on...

	Anybody have any opinions as to the effectiveness
	of the vanagon chin spoiler?

	And what about the the big pan that covers
	the aux. gas/diesel heater under the van, do
	you think it improves airflow under the brick?

	My friend has an 82 westy that he cut the bottom out of
	the luggage rack and installed a flip up type sun-
	roof. With the glass panel removed, your hair is sucked
	up through the roof - quite strange if you have long
	hair. I can sort of visualize the airflow up over
	the van, with a big eddy/void over the luggage rack.
