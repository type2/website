Steve, i have on of the early ones that bolts to the bumper mounts and 
then to the bottem of the bumper.  i would be willing to part with it if 
i could locate a early westfalia unit.  this is the one that extends back 
to the swing arm area and comects also someware in the engine area.  the 
ball is curved up from under the car.  can anyone help out there?
thanks and God Bless
matt
