I haven't done the switch idea as has Sami (great idea) but I did move the
sender from the FI head sender location to the actual no. 3 plug and the
change was quite remarkable. original run temps were 220 F with idle at
200; at the plug head temp is 340-350F. This change is only 4 inches across
from the side of the head to the top. DC--
