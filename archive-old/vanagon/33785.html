Subject: Post-mortem on Vanagon Stalling

The distributor replacement seems to have done the trick.  Mechanic traced
the break in the circuit to the magnetic pick-up in the distributor.  I am
assuming he is referring to the Hall effect sensor.  We agreed that
replacing the entire distributor (with a remanufactured item) was the most
appropriate thing to do considering its 11 year age and 150,000 mile use.
The fuel pump was not the cause but deemed to be marginal.  I had him
replace this as well.

The result of the distributor being replaced is not only a cure for the
intermittent stalling (which became not so intermittent after I left the van
at the shop, BTW) but the van seems to idle more smoothly and has more
low-end power.

Perhaps the more I replace on the van, the more reliable it gets, eh?  I
still think I am ahead of the game from my '92 Passat Wagon in terms of
cost.  Just got the tag bill for the wagon that I don't own anymore: $275.
My insurance (including collision--which I don't carrry on the van) was over
$1,000 a year.  The Vanagon tag is $75, my insurance bill is now less than
$300 (liability only).  So I don't have car payments anymore--just an
intermittent large repair bill here and there!
