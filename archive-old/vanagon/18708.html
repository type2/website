Well, I got a few responses most wanting the wheels
which are unfortunately no longer available, sorry
everyone, but instead of mailing people seperately
I'll sum up what's left. It turns out it actually is a
'54, unfortunately he sold 4 of the 16&quot; wheels at
Mannasas last weekend, he still has 1 left (spare?).
He has the steering wheel and horn button but will
not separate and wants $200, he wants $200 for the
gas tank.  Other parts include front axle, pedal assemblies
hand brake assembly, tranny with right side reduction
box in unknown condition, and none of the body is
useable, not even the nose for a display case.  I really
should have mentioned the thing a little earlier and somebody
might have got the wheels, sorry again everyone.
