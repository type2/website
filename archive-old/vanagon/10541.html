So Sami Dakhlia says:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;You mentioned you've
&gt; &gt;already replaced the fuel pump so you've got some money in the FI system so
&gt; &gt;that would be a point in favor of keeping it.  
&gt; 
&gt; Sunk costs are irrelevant. &lt;Sorry, Pat, the econ-geek in me just HAD to say
&gt; that :) &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; HOWEVER: FI is definitely a superior feeding mechanism. More power, better
&gt; response, cooler engine, better mileage, less pollution. Generally fewer
&gt; problems. Parts are cheap IF you shop at the junk yard.
&gt; 

Yeah, I remember when in the 70's that most of the back yard mechanics
condemning FI cause they didn't understand how to work on it.  &quot;Yeah, it's
really junk&quot;

I agree with you Sami, it's an excellent system, you just have to change 
your repair tactics.
