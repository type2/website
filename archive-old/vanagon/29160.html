Subject: Re: Water Pump (Coolant) Replacement

&gt;So, fellow vanagoneers, what's been your experience with the various
&gt;brands of (new/rebuilt) water pumps?  Any suggestions for brands to look
&gt;for - or look *out* for? 

This may or may not help. I bought a rebuilt pump for my '87 from a local
import auto parts store over a year ago. The problem is, I don't know what
brand it was--they handled a lot of Beck-Arnley stuff, but I'm not sure
that's what I bought or whether Beck-Arnley is a brand or just a reseller.

Here's what I do know. The store gave me a choice between a cheaper part and
a better part for about a $15 diff. He recommended the more expensive one as
being a better casting and more like original. I bought it and found it to be
similar in casting quality to the original pump---price was $85. It wasn't
VW, but it was real close. It's been on my motor for 25k miles--of course,
the original lasted for nearly 102K, so it'll be a long time before I know if
this one is as good!

The part number was 025-121-010C  -- maybe that would help determine a brand?
The store went out of business, but it looks like they may have recently
opened up. If you want me to check further here, email me directly.

Good luck!
