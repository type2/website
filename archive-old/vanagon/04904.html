&gt; Ok, here goes
&gt; 
&gt; Leave Jan 1st 1995:
&gt; Vancouver, BC to Longview WA, cross the Columbia R, head for the coast.
&gt; Hit coast around Tillamook, OR and bop on down 101 to somewhere near SF
&gt; Cruise the wine country
&gt; Head to Reno, then down Hwy 95 to Las Vegas, detouring for Death Valley.
&gt; Las Vegas to Grand Canyon, along Northern roads into NM to Santa Fe, to 
	       ^^^^^^^^^^^^
&gt; Alamogordo, back to San Diego along southern routes through NM, AZ, CA.

Having been to the Grand Canyon several times it is my opinion that the
best way to appreciate it is to hike it.  From the top it looks like a 
big post card to me, but the hike in and out is like nothing else I have 
ever experienced .  Accommodations at the bottom range from primitive
camping to lodging with showers.  The Phantom Ranch at the bottom serves
breakfast and dinner.  You can also buy a cold beer, mail a letter and 
make a phone call.  All planning must be done in advance and in writing.  
If this sounds like something you would be interested in drop me some email 
and I can give you more details.
