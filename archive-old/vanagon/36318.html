Subject: Brake job: '83 Westy

Just called around for prices on getting the brakes done on the '83 Westy.
I am anticipating thin drums. Was advised that they could be thin from
conversation with the mechanic when the CVs were recently done.

Phoenix Dealer prices were:

Chapman VW-
front $210.00 
rear  $250+  (plus grease seal)
-Price includes repacking and replacing the rear seals as well as the fronts.
-Drums and rotors turned as part of the labor charge.
-unsure if pads and shoes were included
-Drums and Rotors are extra if needed.

Camelback VW- ~DOH! (DOUGH $)!
front $179.75labor
rear $169.00 labor 
-unsure if pads and shoes were included
-add &quot;about&quot; $150 per side to replace the grease seals and repack bearings.
-drums if needed: $215.75 *EACH!!* no guarantee of origin!!!!
-would have to order the drums.
-&quot;VWOA uses so many parts that it would be impossible to tell the true
origin of the drums.&quot;
-rotors if needed: (Didnt bother to ask)

A popular VW parts and service place (with two locations)
Location A $225 for all four
Location B $300 for all four &quot;about&quot; ~ the guy was real rushed...
-New grease seals/ repacking  were included in the &quot;front&quot; price.
-Drums and rotors turned as part of the labor charge.
-Repack and replace rear seals only if leaking. &quot;Add about an hour to each
side.&quot;
-drums if needed &quot;about&quot; $60 ea. (German only)
-rotors if needed $60-70 ea.

Found a parts place that the dealer uses:
Shoes $10.50 plus $13.00 core
Pads-BPR $18.95
Pads-Mintex $13.95
New German Rotors $51.25 ea.
New German &quot;Bremstatler&quot; Drums $47.75 ea.
Total $228.45* plus labor, plus the front seals.
(Add cost of having the rotors cleaned up if new rotors weren't needed)

The FLAPS said that they supply only German or Danish Drums.

*If the rotors and the drums were needed and purchased.
