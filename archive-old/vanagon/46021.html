Subject: cracks in head (cylinder head, that is)


Woo-hoo! First post! Hi all!

I'm wondering if anyone has had a problem with cracking in their 
cylinder head or block. What were the symptoms and how did you locate it?

Im doing a thesis at the University of Toronto in collaboration with 
Volkswagen Canada Remanufacturing to test cylinder heads for leaks and 
cracks.

If you know the particulars of a test like this, technical details such 
as mounting hardware or test process/design, that would really be 
appreciated. Specifically, how was the apparatus mounted to the head/engine?
