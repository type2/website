Dave, I am taking your advice, I subscribed to the list a few days ago.
Tons of mail now.

&gt; Based on the fact that the harness failed twice I would think that something else is causing that.  Maybe all you need is a fuel filter, the injector harness could be getting clogged?  The O2 sensor should be replaced ever 80k miles, I doubt you drove your van 80k miles in a year, but I could be wrong.  If you want more help I would strongly recommend posting to the vanagon mailing list, send an email describing your problem to vanagon_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu .  This is a great source of information,

&gt; Hi Dave, thanks for taking the time to reply.
&gt; 
&gt; This problem existed once before, and finally went away when my mechanic
&gt; replaced the Fuel Injector Harness about a year ago. I recognized the
&gt; symptoms right away when they returned a few weeks ago, having lived
&gt; with it for a couple of years the first time around. So, I am suspicious
&gt; of the Oxygen Sensor.
&gt; 
&gt; But I am extra suspicious of the part having possibly failed twice. Are
&gt; these sensors well known for needing frequent replacement?

&gt; &gt; You my want to check your exhaust system for leaks, look for cracks at the
&gt; &gt; weld joints.  If this is your problem when you disconnect your O2 sensor the
&gt; &gt; idle should return to near normal.  Another possibility is the idle stabilizer.
&gt; &gt;  The idle stabilizer is the cylindrical unit located in the top center of the
&gt; &gt; engine compartment, disconnect the power (on the left).  You also might want
&gt; &gt; to check the idle stabilizer control unit. It is located behind the right rear
&gt; &gt; taillight, it looks like a big relay.  I don't know how to check one, but the
&gt; &gt; fail sometimes.  The black smoke could be a couple things, check the cold
&gt; &gt; start system, there is a fifth fuel injector that may be damaged.  Another
&gt; &gt; possibility is that the rest of your injectors are not functioning properly.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; If you have any questions email me, dfilcoff_at_stlnet_dot_com or the Vanagon mailing
&gt; &gt; list, vanagon_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu .  If you want to subscribe to the list go to

&gt; &gt; &gt;Somebody here must've had this prob besides me...
&gt; &gt; &gt;Engine will sometimes assign its own (higher) idle speed at random.
&gt; &gt; &gt;Accompanied by rich running and black smoke. Worse in winter.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;Since prob is intermittant, my mechanic has almost never seen it.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;Anybody else ever had this?
