Subject:      Weakly Stats (sort of) ...

well, actually i'm kinda reposting these (updated) stats to jab at the
Unknowns ... there are ENTIRELY too many of you! :) when the Unknowns
exceed the Microbuses, i start harassing the list to get folks to tell me
which year and model buses you have out there.

so fess up! if you don't have one yet (and are semi-sorta-maybe looking to
buy one in the next ten years), that qualifies you to become an Official
Wanabus. :)  so send them cards and letters in, folks ... mostly it'll be
the folks who have joined up in the last two-three weeks.

for the newbies, this is what i &quot;do&quot; with that info requested in the Welcome
Letter.
