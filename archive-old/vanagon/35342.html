Subject: RE: cheap Syncro Vanagon Tires?


&gt;I switched from the POs Michelin MXL 205s to 185R14C 8PR, 100/102P 
all-season
&gt;blackwall 8 ply tubeless steel belted radials.  Whew!  They're 40,00 mi.
&gt;warranty, made by Kelly but called Jupiters YP-821.  I hope you'll agree 
that
&gt;I got a bargain _at_ $43 ea. plus mounting, balancing, tax and Merchant's 
&quot;Tire
&gt;Protect Policy&quot;- repair/rotate/balance for life of tire for $64.87 total.

Yes! Please let us know how they handle-- I've heard that in general
the 8PR tires handle much better than passenger car tires on
a VW van (less blowing around in gusty winds, less steering
effort at low speeds etc.) as well as having higher load capacity.

Do you find your handling/steering is better?
