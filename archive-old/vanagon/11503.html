Subject: Bleeding clutch??

Anyone care to decribe how &quot;easy&quot; it is to bleed the clutch lines
in an '84 Vanagon?  Bently says to pressurize the system (from the
resevior??) using a &quot;special tool&quot;.   I'd rather be able to use the
low tech method of pumping on the clutch pedal.

BTW, my mechanic charged me $100 to replace the clutch master
cylinder in my '84 vanagon.

&gt; Hello,
&gt; 
&gt; My slave leaked first.  After I replaced that, the master died within a 
&gt; month.  British Auto Parts in Phoenix had both new for about $60 each; a 
&gt; little more for one, a little less for the other.  While both looked nasty 
&gt; to get at to replace, it was quite easy, about 1/2 hour each.  Of course, 
&gt; the system had to be bled afterwards, but that was a snap as well.
