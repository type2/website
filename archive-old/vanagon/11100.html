Last night I put 1 3/8&quot; foram pipe insulation on my heater tube, and I'm 
sure its making a difference, I just haven't been able to test it real
good yet.

I bought 2 pieces, and put i on the top of the tube and 1 on the bottom,
and ended up with about 1&quot; of overlap.

I used 3M trim adhesive to stick them to it, and I'm also going to put
wire ties around it for good measure!
