Subject: Solar battery chargers


J.C. Whitney sells a solar powered charger for $35 that they describe as
having a max current output of .05 amps and 12.2 volts. Is that worthless or
could it actually keep a van battery charged that was otherwise being used
for radio and interior lights while camping? They also have a heavy duty
version at 13.2 volts; would that make any difference?

In that same vein, would it be safe to rely on the battery indicator panel
where yellow indicates you still have starting power? Both questions assume
spring/summer conditions and not this -48 business the Minnesotans are
enjoying now.

Thanks,
