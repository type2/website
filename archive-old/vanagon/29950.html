I have not done this conversion, but I played a carburator once on T.V.

The Parts Place lists Weber carb conversion kits for 75-83 busses for 
$289.00.  This is a single carb set-up, and I wonder about provisions on 
this carb for intake air pre-heating--carburator icing can be, ah, 
inconvenient.

I've often thought of doing a conversion on my 2.0 L FI bus, but only for 
long trips in Mexico or further afield (Central/South America, or 
overseas) where mechanics may not have the familiarity/tools/experience/ 
available parts to repair FI problems.  I've had no problems with my FI 
so far, and see no reason to convert for normal driving conditions in 
Canada or the US.  Passing emissions testing would likely become a 
problem with a carb conversion, too.
