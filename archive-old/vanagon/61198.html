Subject: No odometer or gas gauge, what now

Hello everyone
	The gas gauge on my van has never worked as long as I've had it,
have always used the trip meter as an alternative.  Well, now the trip
meter has called it quits

The symptoms: When the tenths of a mile ring reaches nine, it freezes.
This also freezes the odometer.  I could use it for a while by pulling the
wand out a little, this trick no longer seems to fix.

The gas gauge symptoms: if full, reads half empty or a quarter empty.

Has anyone tackled these two problems before, barring or in lue of that,
any suggestions

Desperate in Madison
Chris
