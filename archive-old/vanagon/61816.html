Subject: Aux. Battery 1980 westy


Does anyone know of any info on the internet that explains how to install 
a second battery in an '80.  Mine doesn't have the connectors already set 
up for connecting like the later water-cooled.  If you know of any 
addresses to info, or if anyone has any info themselves it would be very 
helpful.

Thanks,

	Kyle
