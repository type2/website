Subject: Re: Westy/Vanagon/xover parts sources



I'm forwarding a copy of the message I sent to Bob (pmail), since another
subscriber (Lotus) had commented on the original &quot;x-over pipe&quot; thread.

&gt; Also, I need a cross-over pipe. What years are interchangeable for the '83
&gt; Westy cross-over pipe? I have located a used one in Ca from a company called
&gt; help for  $397, but that was two weeks ago and it is probably gone now.

If it was a x-over pipe for a Federal (non-CAL, CAN/USA) vehicle it's
proabably gone! I just ordered the $397 part for my 82' Vanagon ... I need
a functional CO test port and EGR filter connection to pass CAL smog
emmissions requirements.

If you are not located in CA (don't need to meet CA smog requirements),
there is another place in Canada that sells used x-over pipes. I don't
have their address and phone at the moment, but can send later if you
want. If you need parts that will meet CAL exhaust requirements, be very
explicit in conveying what you want/need to the used parts place. It's
been a struggle (especially with CAL suppliers) to get them to understand
that there IS a difference between the exhaust systems of CAL and USA/CAN
late model VW vehicles. You must also be very specific about having a
COMPLETE unit. I was just sent a USA/CAN used x-over pipe in which the CO
test port and EGR filter connection where removed and Bondo'd (?) over.
This part is completely useless to me, and even if I could use it I
seriously question how long the &quot;band-aid&quot; Bondo treatment will last.

If you haven't noticed yet, functional X-over pipes on older model VW's
are a rare find. VW no longer makes them, and apparently nor does any
third party manufacturer (as far as I have found).

Good Luck, Chris 

P.S.;
Another good source of exhaust parts houses is the California Bureau of
Automative Repair (BART). Just tell them what your vehicle is, what you
need, and they give you a list of places to call for potential parts.
Can email this number also, if need.
