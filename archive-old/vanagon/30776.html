     what so you mean that '67 single cab that I am doing the 'barndoor'
&gt;     conversion on (really!) is a big no no ????     
&gt;     I've got the bumpers, the roof section, semiphores, little lights 
&gt;     etc.. and an angle grinder ;)    
&gt;     '64 samba

Lee,
Do your thing mate.  I disagree with taking a candidate for rarity and
turning it into a worthless bit of horse apples. If you stopped half way
through you project, lost or threw away all of the parts and never completed
the &quot;conversion&quot; or if the '67 was really nice as it was prior to hacking
then I would *personnally* think you as a fool for screwing up a possible
runner. If you complete the conversion of  the single to the point where
only the pickiest guru could tell the difference *and used the vehicle* then
I'd say &quot;Good Show!&quot;  You still will not have either a barndoor '50 or a
nice '67. You will have an altered '67 that may look real cool but it won't
be a '50. Possibly rock soup. Do you have the split tranny, 36hp and dash
sections? Are going to alter the floor/shifter position?  What about the
barndoor front door side window curtians (USA= windows)?  Barndoor steering
wheel and pedal assys? Hmmm... If any vehicle is already beyond reasonable
salvage then I'd say that I was glad that the vehicle was being used. If the
'67 is really rusty and was had for free and the barndoor donor was toasted
then what is to be lost by having fun and being creative? &lt;Nothing much
beside parts for true barndoors&gt;.
 As it turns out, someone wrote me and defended the fellow by saying that
they know the bloke and that he is VW hardcore to the point where he
wouldn't mess up a vehicle unless it was pretty thrashed. Fine.
I personally beleive in keeping any vehicle stock/vintage if possible or
altering only to the point where it can be easily refitted. I am not a
&quot;vintage only&quot; snob but I have my personnal preferences. Variety is what
makes the world go 'round. 
I have developed  a &quot;sore spot&quot; due to seeing tons of  hack jobs to
perfectly good buses/bugs that were attempted by unprofessional unthinking
morons.  Typical scene is the old &quot;hippie bus&quot; with stinking old shag carpet
that smells like dog piss and bong water, a bench sawzalled into a walk
through, cut wheel wells, 197ish home wood paneling, smashed nose and no
engine tin. Center seat thown away, salt and pepper upholstery ripped out
opting for a cheap crushed velvet tuck and roll (ala Velevt Elvis) look.
&quot;It's NIIIICE 'ese!&quot; 
One bus I saw was taken away from a teenager by his parents when the side
popout windows were kicked out at a desert beer party. The teen logic was
that the popout latch clearence was insufficient to push empty beer cans
through the opening in order to thow them out of the bus and on to the
ground below. It was a basic design flaw as seen by the kids!
Other kids recently purchased a local late 50's  7door (double door) panel
van. The bus was soon &quot;slammed&quot; for that kewel look. Another trick was the
removal of  the cab divider because it because it was too hot in the
rear-cargo area during a return trip from the lake. The divider was tossed
off of the top of the bus by the wind and smashed into a jillion pieces as
it spun into the roadway due to insufficient strapping. Did they stop and
pick up the pieces? Nope. party on Garth! =(
This is the type stuff I object to. Conversly I object to the yuppie I
talked to who only brings the megabuck resto 66-67 Westy out to the SOTO
meets on a trailer only if the weather is nice. I'm not talking about the
1HIPBUS guy.
