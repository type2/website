Subject: Re: Rear Hatch struts

The brand &quot;Strong Arm&quot; (which is sold at Big A flaps in the NE) makes
prefectly good hatch struts specifically Vanagons at about $25 each.  I
believe the part # for an '83 and up is 4634.  I have some and they work
just fine.

&gt;When mine failed, I removed it and went into flaps.  Although none were
&gt;listed for vanagon, I found two the same size, with similar connectors.  I
&gt;think they cost about $20 ea.  Have worked well for two years.  If you want
&gt;part number, I could go look.
