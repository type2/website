Subject: exhaust systems

After reviewing the 97 Archives and recent postings on exhaust systems, I am
still left with a basic question for my 86 vanagon. So, what is the best
compromise in a full exhaust replacement given the following criteria?  It
needs to have a long life for our very corrosive Southeast Alaska
environment, mabey a bit of additional horsepower, a price that won't
require a second mortgage on my home, and a vendor that will ship.

An email address, or phone number for the vendors that you think would be
best, would be appreciated.
Thanks
