Hi all.  At the coaxing of a certain member of this list I thought I 
would relate my recent engine installation experience giving 
particular attention to the subject of carburetion.

I just installed (about four weeks ago) a brand new 1600DP in my '71 
bus.  I read a big chunk of literature while I was buying tools and 
saving money for the motor.  The old motor was so tired that I 
couldn't even begin to figure out what was bad and what was worth 
reusing.  I decided to buy as many new parts as I could.  This thing 
is going to drive me to the ends of the world.

It was easy to figure out which distributor and fuel pump to purchase.
The difficulty came with the fuel delivery system.  Gene Berg and many
others had me leaning heavily towards dual Kadrons.  Not a bad setup 
in itself.  Many many have run it with great success.  It was near the
ordering point that Bob nudged me in the direction of a single 
carburetor.  A Weber Progressive DFEV 32/36 to be exact.  One carb, 
one idle adjustment, one air mixture screw, etc.  So far (650 miles) I
have not had to touch anything on this motor outside of standard 
adjustments on a new motor.

Finally, a comment on performance.  My old motor was very old so I 
don't have a great comparision to make.  However, this setup has 
'tons' of power in the top end and will actually pull away from a 
light once you get it into second, first is very low.  I am running a 
009 distributor.  I have no flat spot once the motor warms up.  This 
is the same that Gene reports with the Kadrons.  I am getting only 
slightly more heavy footed.  With the motor well warmed I can actually
feel the acceleration in third from 25 to 40 or so.  I am getting 
24-25 MPG on highway runs of about 50-55mph.  This with all the 
camping stuff and a couple of hundred pounds of tools.

One last thing to consider is cost.  My whole kit was $225.  I found 
at least three places selling the kit within $25 of this price.  If 
you are thinking of putting it in a bus make sure your manifold has a 
vacuum port for the brake booster.  I think this applies to 71 and 
later busses only.  So, for the price of the Kadrons you could have 
the kit and enough money left over for a spare carburetor.  And you 
only have two screws to adjust.

Maybe this will bring a few progressive users out of the closet.  I 
mean no ill will towards those with dual carbs.  I just wanted people 
to know my experience with the single.  There is a performance 
alternative, and it can be cheaper and easier.  Feel free to ask me 
any questions about this.  I will tell you what I can.  Jim
