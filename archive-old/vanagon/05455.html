&gt;What is the correct (initial) timing for a 009 on a 71 (1600)?
&gt;
&gt;A parts house told me to time it the same as the stock distributor, which in
&gt;my case equated to 5 degrees ATDC -- not a good choice I soon found out.
&gt; Acceleration ceased, for one thing.
&gt;
&gt;Since realizing that setting couldn't possibly work, I've gone to 10 degrees
&gt;BTDC, which is palatable.  But what is the 'spec'?
I've got a 009 in a '71 so I guess I should have the answer, right?  Well, I
haven't driven it much since I bought it and have been restoring the interior
and body and so far haven't looked into the engine much.  But the wisdom on the
net for timing non-stock configurations is to set the TOTAL timing to about
30 degrees or so (by revving the engine until all the distributor advance is
in).  And I think the 009 is supposed to have 19 degrees of advance so setting
it _at_ 10 sounds pretty close.  Like I said, I haven't tried this myself, but it
sure makes sense.
