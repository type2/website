Subject: help.  trouble with turn switch.

I was trying to hook up my turn signal switch yesterday in my 60 crewcab.  i 
was having all kinds of trouble getting the right rear light to flash.  
maybe you all could help.  i am possitive that the wiring is correct.  i 
have switched both bulbs and housings to confirm that the work.  i have 
switched the left and right side wires from the switch to check out the 
circute.  no matter what i switch, it apears that the black/purple wire 
from the SWF switch is not transmitting a signal.  i basically isolated 
it to theis wire and the switch.  all other directions work fine.  
everything worked befor my resto.  anyone have any ideas to diagnose this?
how about anyone out there have a extra one they are not using?

thanks in advance.
matt
