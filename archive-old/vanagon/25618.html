Subject: Alpine (TM) antifreeze

following in Gerry's footsteps, i bought some &quot;Alpine&quot; brand 
antifreeze at Target today...

the bottle lists ingredients and a phosphate compound isn't on there, 
nor 'other corrosion inhibitors'.  i'll try contacting the 
manufacturer and see if it is truly phosphate free.

anyone know?
