Jim, I faaced the same problem and went looking through MANY cell phone 
shops until I found a 3db gain antennae that sticks to the inside of the 
windor. I mounted mine on the windshield, dead center. I travel all over 
the west and southwest and have had excellent coverage.
This thing is called a &quot;Delta Plus&quot; and is shaped like a dart. If you can 
find it (I haven't seen another) it will work just fine.
