Well, I went shopping all the local magazine emporia I could think of,
and all I could find was a Brit magazine.  I didn't think this would
be very interesting since all of the adverts would be for across
the pond.  Where or how does one get a single copy of one of the US
rags to see if it's worth the subscription?
