So Still in litigation says:
&gt; For all those camping crazies out there, me and a few of my friends (or 
&gt; for those English language buffs amongst us, a few friends of mine and I) 
&gt; will be camping out at Leo Carillo State Beach next Friday. For those of 
&gt; us who live by their dayplanner, that is March 22nd. I just made my 
&gt; reservations today and from the sound of it, there is a high probability 
&gt; that there are quite a few campsites still available. If any of you guys 
&gt; can make it it would be great to see some happy pyromaniaical faces for 
&gt; some good old campfire fun...

So where is Leo Carillo State Beach??
