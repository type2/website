Subject: Thanks (Ga Vintage VW show)


I want to thank everyone who came out to this years Ga Vintage VW 
Show.  I met about 4 listmembers there, &amp; if others of you were 
there &amp; I missed you, I apologize.  It was a very busy day for me.

I ended up only bringing 3 vehicles, my 59 single cab, 64 T34 Karmann 
Ghia, and 65 Sundial camper w/ roofrack.

There were many great deals in the swap area.  A mint condition late 
model bus tent went fast at $200.  I picked up a NOS high hinge early 
panel van cargo door for $15!!!  I also got a complete set of 4 OEM 
late 55-63 front wheel cylinders for $30.  There was a good selection 
of Official VW Sevice Manuals and Parts Lists.  I didn't buy much 
because I was broke, but when I got home my state income tax refund 
was in the mailbox (only a month late).

The show was about half the size of last years with about 40+ buses, 
10 Karmann Ghias, 15-20 Beetles, a couple of Things, and a few Type 
III's.  The area we were allowed to use was completely full between 
11am-1:30pm though.  We chose not to advertise in Hot VW's &amp; VW Trends 
this year due to the small venue we were using.  Next year we won't 
be constrained by Olympics construction, etc., and will be able to use 
a larger venue again.

Thanks again for coming out!

Dave
