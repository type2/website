Subject: Buzzing Fuel Pump

Hello,

	I just found this list and have learnded quite a lot so far.  Maybe
someone has some insight into my problem.  I have an 85 Vanagon Camper
and about two years ago the fuel pump began buzzing(like a digital alarm
clock under the floor) when the weather conditions became very hot(i.e.
&gt; 90's).  It only occured under those conditions and usually would take a while to occur after the engine had been started and warmed up.  Early this summer the pump started to buzz in cooler and cooler weather until it was buzzing all the time, right from ignition.  It is now very difficult for passengers to sit back there comfortably.  I have hesitated replacing it because of the cost($199) and the fact that I have noticed no performance problems.  Any ideas on other options or another diagnosis?

	James
