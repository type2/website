Subject: Free van to good home

       In this morning's _The_Davis_Enterprise_ there is a car ad that
       reads:  &quot;1974 VW Van.  Needs new engine.  Free to good home.
       753-8111.&quot;  That phone number would be 916-753-8111, including
       the area code.

       I can't take it because two of my four VW's are not running. 
       Besides, I only have parking for three!  If I get a chance to
       talk to the owner, I'll try to get them to hold it for one of
       you.  Someone on this list should be able to give it a good
       home.
