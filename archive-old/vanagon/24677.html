Subject: Re: 1987 Vanagon Question

Peter asked (and i violated his privacy by posting to the group):

&gt; Is their anything specific to an 87 Westy with 82000mi I should be looking 
&gt; for before I buy?  I am quite familiar with the head problems, but can you 
&gt; think of anything else I should consider or look for in terms of typical 
&gt; failure areas?

well... mine has 169K now and still going strong, despite drippy 
heads.  i think you'll find problems in the following areas, more as 
a function of time/mileage than care:

--cv joints (seems everyone replaces them about this time, 'cept joel)
 --rear hatch struts
 --front heater fan switch (many have replaced the
blower to find it was only a $12 switch, nearly did it myself)
 --radio antenna replacement (poor reception)
 --plug wires (definately)
--maybe a starter
 --probably has a bad idle and need cleaning of engine grounds among 
other ellusive black magic
--several people have had to replace heater hoses, i
had the metal coolant mainfold rust out (left side of engine).
--broken wires inside drivers door for speaker and/or remote mirror
(common to several on this list) 
--EXHAUST (heh heh, you're in for a treat with this one)
--maybe a water pump

you're on your own as far as the engine goes... could be great or it 
could be toast depending on care, overheating, etc.

good luck and let us know!
