&gt; Yeah... the local VW dealer guy said I would probably fail the smog test

He's right.  

====================================
The totally ridiculous thing about this is that the purpose of the restrictor
was to prevent the use of leaded gas.  Leaded gas has been unavailable for 4
or 5 (?) years now.  This is an example of the kind of mindless bureaucracy I
vented about a few days ago!
