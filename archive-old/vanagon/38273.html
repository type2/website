Subject: Got the single cab, yeah

     hi all, 
     
     I finally went down to London and picked up the '61 single cab on 
     Saturday.
     
     It was a 3 hour train journey then a 5 hour! drive back at an average 
     of about 45mph (230miles).
     
     It used about a pint of all so I was quite impressed, though I wasn't 
     impressed by the lack of heat, my legs nearly froze :(
     
     The damn thing is so rust free though I can't believe it :)
     
     It's got all the correct bits in the cab, black knobs etc. It has NOS 
     tilt and canvas which I put up yesterday and it looks cool.
     
     I went round the bus and oiled just about everything and it works so 
     much better, all the doors and flaps and lips and stuff all work 
     smoothley now. I also adjusted the tick over speed as it was running a 
     little high - it's actually got the carb off of an early bay on it.
     
     All I need to do is replace one if the reduction box outer seals as 
     it's leaking a bit, although the bus is suffering from general neglect 
     and just needed someone like me to get hold of it - i can't wait to 
     fill the drop sides with oil! :)
     
     The gear shift is a bit ropey though, I think something must be worn 
     along the way, because the gears are perfect it's just the shift on 
     1st , 2nd and reverse. 3rd and 4th are fine.
     
     Just some questions:
     
     Where does the spare wheel go ?
     Where is the chassis plate ?
     
     Lee.
