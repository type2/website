&gt; &gt; My 85 Westy has been diagnosed  with a leaky head gasket thru a pressure
&gt; &gt; check followed by a visual check. It looks like this will be an expensive
&gt; &gt; repair although the repair costs seem to vary quite a bit depending on wheter
&gt; &gt; or not the heads are pitted. I am praying that the block is not pitted. I am
&gt; &gt; told but don't know why the heads/block cannot be shaved to remove the
&gt; &gt; pitting. I have the following estimates:
&gt; &gt; Dealer #1 - $1800-2400 assuming pitted heads and depending on repair of parts
&gt; &gt; that
&gt; &gt; disintegrate durring disassembly
&gt; &gt; Dealer #2 - $500-700 heads not pitted, up to $1800 if heads pitted
&gt; &gt; Local VW Mechanic - $1100 using an special sealant which seals the pitted
&gt; &gt; heads from an aftermarket guy in New Jersey
&gt; &gt; My questions are:
&gt; &gt; 1. Has anyone had experience with any kind of sealant that seals pitted heads
&gt; &gt; 2. Which comes first, leaking gasket or pitted heads
&gt; &gt; 3. If only one head gasket leaks, why replace both head gaskets at the same
&gt; &gt; time
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; If the heads aren't pitted it's $5-700 but I don't know if they are pitted.
&gt; &gt; The special sealant saves money if the heads are pitted but it is also a bit
&gt; &gt; of a risk.
&gt; &gt; Anyone's experience on this problem is welcome.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Thanks

&gt; I have had this problem for about 2 years.  Now at 137k miles.  A good coolant sealant 
&gt; added to the antifreeze has bought me two years but I do face head replacement soon.  
&gt; My shop has indicated all of these engines they have worked on needed to replace the 
&gt; heads due to pitting.  The problem is the phosphate coolant we use rather than 
&gt; the not so common phosphate free coolant recommended by VW.  Rebuilt head have been 
&gt; quoted to me at $315 to $488 each which included new valves.  I suspect if you do not 
&gt; do your own work you would be wise to put in the rebuilt heads, paying for the job only 
&gt; once.  That is what I plan to do in the next few weeks.

Here's my two cents worth of experience.
Most heads when dissassembled will show pitting. There is still a
controversy about the coolant causing it. Many people like myself who
had stuck faithfully to VW Antifreeze exhibited the same symptoms. 
There is speculation that the sealant that VW used originally contained
corrosive ingredients that exacerbated this condition. If this was not the
case why did VW change the sealant to a new type from its original type.
Anyone care to shed some light on this? 
There is an outfit in Alabama who said he can sell me new heads for
under $500.00 each. I dont know whether these are VW originals.

The sealant for the pitted heads are most likely J D Weld epoxy
compound. I would not take a risk on that unless there is no other
alternative. New welding technology has made available aluminium
welding that can built up the heads but precision milling must be done
afterwards to ensure trueness. The problem is looking for a welding
outfit that can do this work correctly. 
 
My suggestion is go for the new heads if you can afford it, since I
dont really trust those rebuilts unless its from VW which also means high
prices.
