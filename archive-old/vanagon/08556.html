Was _anybody_ able to properly view the ASCII file I posted yesterday?
I tried it on my PC, and it does work, although I had to edit a couple
of lines out to keep it from setting my terminal to 40 column mode.
(edit out the very first and last lines, and there is one in the middle
but ya gotta know how to find it)

On a VT100, VT220 or ansi terminal, it works perfectly!

At least the complaints here were not as bad as on the Posche list - I
got a zillion flames cause the wannabe techno-weenies with their AOL
accounts couldn't figure it out!
