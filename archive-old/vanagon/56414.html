Subject: Audi Quattro List?

Hello all,

Someone posted an address for an Audi Quattro mailing list last week, 
I think it was related to the VC discussion.

I carefully &quot;filed&quot; it for later reference I can't find it now, and 
the archives didn't help...

Can someone pls e-mail me direct if they know it?

Thx
Shawn &amp; Janis Wright
