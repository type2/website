&gt; Tim,

&gt;   You mentioned &quot;a circulation problem, my '87 Syncro creeps up in temp
&gt; at standing idle, but front heater temp output actually goes down.  I
&gt; have to rev the engine to push hot coolant up to front heater in
&gt; winter/parked_at_idle or I start blowing very cold air. But rear heater
&gt; always warm at idle due to shorter pipes thus less flow constriction.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt;   You may risk being flamed by Jim Davis (Syncrohead address) for
&gt; suggesting that those Vanagon long water coolant pipes impose any
&gt; meaningful flow restriction as your experience report clearly
&gt; illustratates they do.  He estimated that they account for no more than
&gt; 2% of the system's restriction, and comment or evidence to the contrary
&gt; has put him into personal attack mode rather than address this issue.
&gt; I'm sending this message only to you as a personal note and not to any
&gt; other list member in case you'd like to know that you're shining a light
&gt; on a truth that some don't want to be recognized.  Just beware that Mr.
&gt; Davis may have his ego attached to VW design and if he notices what
&gt; you've said, may decide to attack you.  Please do not cite any of this
&gt; note on the list as I'd prefer to only deal with VW issues rather than
&gt; this curious behavior.
&gt; 
&gt;         Respectfully,
&gt;         John Wakefield
