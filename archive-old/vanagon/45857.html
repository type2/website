Subject: power window troubleshooting

Dear Vanagoners,

	I have a 91 Vanagon Carat with a balky passenger side power 
window. The driver side one works well, so the fuse should be OK. 
Bentley is not particularly helpful. Anybody have any experience 
troubleshooting these units? 
	There has been intermittant failure in the past. That would 
point toward the usual diagnosis of: loose wire. I suppose the next 
step is, take off door panel and inspect the mechanism. See if motor 
works when unconnected to window.
