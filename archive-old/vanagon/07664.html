&gt; &gt;Whitney's doesn't have a 3 window unit for a '75, how about
&gt; &gt;others?
&gt; You might try &quot;Pop Top Campers&quot;.  They advertise in LiMBO's newsletter and
&gt; also HVW.  AND they have a BBS dedicated to poptop campers.  They claim
&gt; lowest prices anywhere and from what I remember they weren't too bad.  But
&gt; I've never ordered anything from them so I can't really give much of an
&gt; opinion.  Anyway, their number is (800)248-2719 or via modem at (310)457-3033.
&gt; They're in Malibu, CA.

I am in the process of having my tent canvas replaced right now.  The
tent comes from West Coast Metric.  I went and looked at it this weekend,
and to tell you the truth, the material doesn't seem as good a quality
as the original.  It is thinner, and very soft, almost like cotton instead
of canvas!  I'm going to call them and ask what the material actually is.
There is a place in Texas, called VW Canvas (see their ad in HVW), that
claims to use superior quality canvas (I have not actually seen their 
product).  What I would do is call and ask for a sample of material before
buying anything.
