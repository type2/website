This should be the second to last report on the top-end rebuild of a '75
bus, tomorrow being the big day.

I separated the rehoned barrels and the pistons one more time, again
cleaned them all in hot, soapy water, this time VERY thoroughly, until
smooth to the touch. Realigned the rings and fitted the pistons back into
their respective barrels, this exercise being much easier now that I'd
done it 8 times already before... The friction was now considerably less,
so I obviously *lied* when claiming that the p/c's had been well cleaned
in a previous post. 

The heads still had aluminum shavings in all hooks and crannies, including
under the valves (!), and took a while to be cleaned. Also the cylinder
head temp sensor hole was not tapped with care and had burrs in it, which
is why the old sensor didn't fit. And finally, I also noticed that one
stud at the exhaust ports was missing. So back to the machine shop... :(

After that, things went very quickly: basic engine got put together on
Sunday and yesterday I added all the accessories. The story goes much like
Joe Fournier's and I also kept working at it until 2 am both nights. This
morning, a friend came over and helped me carry the engine from the
basement to the parking lot, where the engine got installed back into the
bus. It took us about two hours and it was not entirely easy, but nothing
worth e-mailing the list about.

Tomorrow, hoses and wires will be hooked up, the whole exhaust system
(including heat exchangers) must go on, oil be added, and a few other
misc. things. And then.... fingers crossed.
