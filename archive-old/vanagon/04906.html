Subject: Trip Plans

The Westy is ready (rebuilt engine broken in) - the owner's a bit anxious - and
I'm taking off the week of October 8th for a trip along the New England Coast.

Will be traveling from MI to NY, VT, NH, Maine then down the coast to Philly to
visit relatives before heading home on the 15th.

If anyone has any advice on &quot;must sees&quot; or cool camping sites,  please let me
know.

Would also appreciate the names/numbers of friendly VW mechanics along the way
&quot;just in case.&quot;

Will have complete trip report when I return.

Cheers,

Tam
