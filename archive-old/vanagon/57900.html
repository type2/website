Subject: Re: Heat/Fresh Air Cables broke

More on this subject 
When the cables on my 85 wasser stoped working I(being a bicycle mechanic )
went down to the shop I work at and got a length of &quot;Index derailure housing
&quot; also known as S.I.S housing . 
The inner diameter of the housing is larger than stock vw housing .
The o.d . is small enough to use the same clips that hold every thing in
place 
A bit of teflon lube and Viola as good as new .
I did this about 6 months ago and no problems yet .

good luck
