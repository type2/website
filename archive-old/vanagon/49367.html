Glad to see some other Texans, I've run across a bunch of
Vanagons/westfalias at Texas Campgrounds, all very nice people.
I've found most of the parts I've need right here, just bought a trany &amp;
Instaled it.
What are you doing on AOL, American Internet 1-800-BE A Geek $19.95 Mo.
why net just $9.95 mo.
I tried Flashnet but gave up and changed.
I design internet pages http://www.volder_dot_com
Also have another deal going http://www.volder_dot_com/fastrack
Do you need parts or inspiration to get your vanagon going.
83 Westfaila Aircooled
71 MG Midget MKII
86 Olds Custom Cruser (land yacht) still weighs in at 600lb less than
westy.
If you hear of local VW events drop me a note.

&gt; &gt; I'd like to make contact with other Texas Vanagon/Westy Owners, purpose,

&gt; &gt;
&gt; Stan,
&gt; 
&gt; I am a Vanagon owner who lives in the DFW area (Plano to be
&gt; specific.)  But my Vanagon is not in great shape at the moment.
&gt; However, I'd be happy to help w/ parts and I often could use help
&gt; too.   I happen to have a source for factory OEM VW parts provided
&gt; they have an AUDI application as well.  The source is pretty good on
&gt; price.
&gt; 
&gt; Lemme know how I can help,
&gt;
