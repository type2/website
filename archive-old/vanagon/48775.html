      If you didn't just let the fluid pour out, you can let the system
      bleed it self, for the small amount of fluid loss is minimal. 
      Keep a close eye on the over flow, and the temp. gauge. It will
      run hotter until all the air is out of the system. You will know 
      when the air is out of the system because there will not be air in 
      the top on the expansion tank.
