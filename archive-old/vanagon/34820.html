Subject: Wondering if you can point me in a direction?

I have an '89 Vanagon Westfalia which I bought a year ago which I really
enjoy.  I use it as a part-time RV and kid shuttle.  However, since it was
made for 4 people and I have 6 (4 kids) I'm looking for a way to add
another seat (preferably removable at the campsite) and a center seatbelt
for the rear seat, so that I can get the whole family in safely.  Do you
have any idea where I might find help on this?

I also have a 63 Bug Cal-Look resto, and get a couple of the VW
magazines, so my other option is to try to call around from the ads...

Thanks for any leads.
