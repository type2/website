Subject: 75 westy for sale/trade.  So. Cal

i have decided that i do not want to keep my new 75 westy.  so it is for 
sale.  i thought i would give you all the first crack at it.

spects:

the good

1975 Westfalia campermobile
1??? cc motor.  manual says it is a 1800
full auto trans
Air conditioning
54,000 orig miles
camper apolstry is untouched.  looks like it hase never been used.
	rest of interior is real nice.  just one rip on side of driver seat.
	missing a few of the westy pieces.
	canvas is unused as are the beds. (probably the stove,fridge, etc too)
new brakes
passes smog

the bad.

body has been repainted.  it looks like the bus was in a rear end 
accident some time ago.  that with the rust in teh front window caused 
the insurance co to salvage it.  hence title.  sameone else bought it and 
fixed the rear and the rust and repainted it.  it looks real good.  no 
rust anywhere on it.
the motor has a air leak in the main induction hoses.  it stalls when 
cold, but runs like a dream when cold.  needs a little TLC.

the ugly.

rims need repainting




basically, i would like to sell it or trade for another bus.  i am after 
a 1960 westy.  if anyone out there is interested, write back and lets 
talk.  the bus us in huntington beach, CA.

take care and God BLess
matt
