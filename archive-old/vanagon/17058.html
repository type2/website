Subject: RE: The Bus Stop

Anybody out there ever heard of or recieved anything
from The Bus Stop catalog?

  They had an ($20!) original 1976 owner's manual that made my socks
  roll up and down. Another manual consisted mostly of reprints from
  a south African car magazine (not too impressed with that).
 
  The parts appear to be good quality -- if I win the state lottery
  I'll order all the ones on my wish list and let ya know how good
  they turn out to be!!!
