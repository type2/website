Dave &quot;Voice Boy of the Net&quot; Carpenter writes ( as reported by Tim Smith):

&gt;But most of the folk are very helpful. Like every group, there are a few
&gt;snots (he's a lawyer and owns a Eurovan), but the group just ignores them.

&gt;PS: we really don't ignore you Bill, I mean Ric


Oh Dave, I am so humbled by your description. Especially by one whom
I consider a Vanagon God, considering ALL of the wit and wisdom you
have provided this group! Your contributions to this list make those
of Joel, Thom, hell even Gerry pale by comparison. Wasn't it your
genius that got Joel to creat the list...or prodded Martha to
start those westcoast gatherings.

Yep, Dave, being &quot;slammed&quot; by such a major contributor to this
list is a humbling experience. 

But Dave, get your terms straight... first off I am NOT a &quot;snot&quot;,
I am the &quot;ever vocal self-appointed defender of EuroVans&quot;, and
if I have something to say about a topic or a person, I have
the testicular-fortitude to say it directly. Unlike some folks
(hint...hint...Dave the &quot;vanagon voice-less&quot;) who have to
go on another list to whine.... &quot;Ohhh mommy, mommy, Ric
is saying mean things again&quot;...

Bottom line Dave, got a problem, address it to me. If not then
I would appreciate it if you would keep your &quot;lurker&quot; opinions
to yourself....If you don't participate...dont bitch!


Ric (in my best tricky dick voice: &quot;I am not a Snot&quot;)
