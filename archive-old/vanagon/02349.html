&gt; ps. Now if we could only get the National Enquirer involved...wait...

If we marketed the trip as spiritual trip, visiting all the channeling
hot spots and places of high psychic energy (instead of saying the 
route was planned to pass near a bunch net dweebs!) we could probably
get some press.  Heck, there's probably someone predicting the end of
the world next fall. We could say we were doing the trip to gather
psychic energy to save the world!

And if that doesn't work, I envision some of the cellular-phone wielding
fanatics as &quot;guest Psychic Friends&quot;, giving psychic advice live from
the nations wellsprings of crystal power, live on the Psychic Friends
Network!  Does anyone have a FOAF who knows Dionne Warwick or LaToya?
Let's set this up!
