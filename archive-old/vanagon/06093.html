&gt; &gt; I'm looking for someone to say &quot;I've got a 009 on my bus, and it's been
&gt; &gt; fine for X years =)
&gt; 
&gt; How about this:
&gt; 
&gt; 	&quot; I had an 009 on my bus for several years, and never *could* get
&gt; it to run right.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; I'm sure there is a source out there for a stock replacement distributor.
&gt; Find it, buy it, and be happy.  :)  If nowhere else, call Vee Parts here
&gt; in San Diego at (619) 477-4787.  They should be able to help.  I would
&gt; recommend avoiding the 009.
&gt; 
Interesting, as I have run a 009 on my '67, which has a 68 Beetle
engine, for at least 4000 miles, and it's been great. I put it on at the
beginning of this year, and if it's as bad as some are saying, I'd love
to get an old one- I'd be flying! :)
Anyway, no complaints here.
Richard
