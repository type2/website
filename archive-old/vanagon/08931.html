&gt; How about &quot;caravaning&quot; down to the site from somewhere in the bay Area?  
&gt; Probably someplace at the South end of the bay would be a good meeting 
&gt; place, so's folks from both East bay and the penninsula can get there 
&gt; without going out of the way.

How about caravaning from the South too?  Is anyone going to be driving up
101 on Friday afternoon?  Please e-mail me!
