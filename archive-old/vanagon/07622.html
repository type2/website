Subject: RE: Do I need professional help?

I've been in both places - as a penniless PhD student I've had to keep
transport alive (one kid at that stage) under time pressure with no bucks to do
it - this is where there is very little  pleasure associated with doing things
mechanical on VWs or anything else......

The secret to enjoying working on a VW is when you get to do it for relaxation
/ interest / enjoyment rather than out of necessity. My 62 is pure hobby - we
have  other transport (too much! going to have to be rationalised soon I think)
and every moment is blissful relaxation.......

Think about the Norton.  I sold my last guitar (Gibson Les Paul) when we were
utterly stuffed for repair money and I still wish I had it now.....

PS. Melbourne is in its 4th day of +35C temp with north-easterly winds.  'Down
south' (Port Campbell, twelve apostles) was off its face last weekend with the
BIGGEST glassy barrels 8-)........
