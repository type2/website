Subject: DC Area Gawk Meet Thursday 


[Forgive me if I'm breaking some sort of list rule here; I'm not selling
anything. :)  I'm trying to reach any folks on vintagvw and vanagon who might
not be on aircldvw.]

A few of us here in the MD/DC/VA area are getting together to eat ice cream
and admire one another's VWs.  If you're interested:

Date: Thursday, July 20th
Time: 9pm 'til everyone goes home
Where:  Baskin Robbins in Yorktowne (Giant) shopping center, Merrifield, VA

Take Beltway Exit 8 to Route 50 West
Watch closely for the &quot;Gallows Road&quot; turnoff--it's immediately after the exit
At the light, make a right onto Gallows
On your right is the Yorktowne Shopping Center
You'll see Giant, Grevey's restaurant, CVS, etc.  
Baskin Robbins is on the wing facing Gallows Road

If you have any questions, comments, or want to let me know you're coming, go
ahead and e-mail me.  Hope to see you there!!

Monica :)
