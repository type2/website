&gt;............. for two or three years now, it has a
&gt; knock coming from the rear, and seemingly more from the left rear. I have had
&gt; two mechanics check out a wheel bearing or cv failure, but they both said
&gt; they were o.k. It has 68,000 miles. Sometimes I will drive it 20 miles and
&gt; not hear it, then another trip will bring out the knock, which seems louder
&gt; under load. Turning right or left does not seem to make a difference in the
&gt; sound. 

Had exactly the same symptoms 9 months ago with my Westy - very 
expensive sounding it was, I sympathise!  Down to the local VW shop 
with great trepidation , to be told &quot;not enough grease!&quot; - the joints 
were apparently dry (but had looked OK to me before).  Very cheap 
solution and no re-occurence since.

Hope it's as simple for you.
