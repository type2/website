Subject: RE: Westy Mystery Bracket

'76... table? what table? where does the table live in your '75?
_______________________________________________________________________________

What year is your Westy. My '75 has such brackets and they hold the swing
arm for the table. -- Sami

&gt;
&gt;Located to the left of the sink, two aluminum braces fastened
&gt;to the side of the cabinet, one over the other, the upper one
&gt;with a round handle made to fasten something in place.
&gt;
&gt;The folding
&gt;bench seat does not make use of this as a support (an initial guess)
&gt;
&gt;It appears to be original equipment, or at least is as old as
&gt;the Campmobile. Was it made to hold a fire extinguisher?
&gt;
&gt;Feel free to reply with guesses, answers and late flames.
