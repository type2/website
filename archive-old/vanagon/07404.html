&gt; 2. The ordinary thermostat that controls the ac operation is not the main
&gt; issue. The problem is the special thermostat that prevnets the compressor
&gt; from coming on at 38 degrees (according to Joel). This special thermostat I
&gt; thought was inside the van but it was mounted directly against the sheet
&gt; metal so in effect it reads outside ambient air temp, not inside air temp. I
&gt; think the sheet metal against which it is mounted is in the left rear up high
&gt; in the vehicle, possibly inside that cavity in the far upper rear where fresh
&gt; air comes in. 
&gt; 

Well, I suppose all you need to do is warm up that area of van.  I suggest buying
a 99 cent Whopper from Burger King, and duct-taping it to the appropriate spot.

That should warm up the sheet metal, allowing the compressor to engage.

Facetiously yours,
