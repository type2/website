Dieter:
Yeah, you're right.  It is a concern (by the way, what's the &quot;D&quot; stand for
in DPO?).  I may have just had that much space in there that it didn't
bother me as much as it would somebody with tight, new tin 8').  Another
thing that works, or at least slows the wear process, is to take a piece of
hose that's got the same ID as the OD of the regular fuel line, cut a slit
longitudinally to fit it over the fuel line and locate it so as to protect
the fuel line from wear.  Works only if there's room for the larger tubing.

However, I *really* like Dieter's idea of shutoff valves in the fuel line.
In my 60 Singlecab, I set the reserve lever between &quot;tank&quot; and &quot;reserve&quot;
positions.  this reduces the flow quite a bit, though it won't stop it
entirely (in fact, it's a cheap security feature if you're ride is kyped
(sp?) by an idiot unfamiliar with the valve - he'll run out of gas pretty
quickly).

which is also the fuel tank!)
