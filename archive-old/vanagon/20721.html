This reminds me....

We were looking for a &quot;kinder, gentler name&quot; for Dave Mancuso's 
&quot;Big White Appliance&quot;  -- any suggestions ???

Candidates:

Yeti (Sasquatch?) (of the kinder, gentler kind, of course!!!)
The Polar Bear (or maybe Klondike???)
The Big White Dove (How about &quot;La Grande Paloma Blanca&quot; to make it sound
                    exotic :-)
(Sorry, &quot;Falkor&quot; is taken... )
Just some ideas....

 &gt; I am curious...
 &gt; 
 &gt; Are there other people, like myself, who remember peoples' Bus-names
 &gt; but not the peoples' names? I will use as an example, &quot;Das Boot&quot; and
 &gt; &quot;Bozo Bus&quot;.
 &gt; 
 &gt; It would help *me* a great deal if we could get a mapping of vehicle
 &gt; names to people names...Does anybody else feel this way?

 &gt; NuBus - '82 Diesel
 &gt; 
 &gt; p.s. NuBus got its name to differentiate it from the &quot;old bus&quot; which 
 &gt;     was a '76. NuBus is actually a nickname.  The proper name is:
 &gt;     &quot;NuBusNuBusNuBus&quot;.  She was named before I got her. Don't blame me.
 &gt; 
 &gt; P.P.S. I engendered NuBus as a &quot;she&quot; because like my wife, NuBus gives
 &gt;        me trouble and costs me a great deal of money... (but I love them both)
