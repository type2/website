Subject: Re: bleed valve

18.5 quarts.  I have never put that much coolant in a vehicle before.
I have read about the proceedure so much I was looking forward to doing
it.  My only question is how much coolant is remaining in the system
after emptying the rad. and coolant tanks.  I had the correct amount of
new fluids measured out.  I added the new antifreeze and then the water.
But the system would not hold the last 4 quarts of water.   Does that
mean I have  4 Quart air buble in the system?  A little Joke.  

In several hours I raise both ends of the van to bleed the system
several times.  My neighbors thought I was crazy.  One of them asked if
it would help, if they picked it up and shook it.  I said no thank you.

Your response will be appreciated.
