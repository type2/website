Subject: RE: Tie Rod Ends


&gt;with what they call a &quot;Pickle Fork&quot; than using a puller.
     &lt;snip&gt;
&gt;Its a two-tined fork, like a BBQ fork
     &lt;snip&gt;
&gt;Once the tie rod end is free of the steering knuckle,

Uh, sorry, guys. INNER tie rod ends, for an '80-'89 VANAGON. It has
rack-and-pinion steering, and the inner ends are the parts that connect
to the rack, not to the steering knuckles on the wheels.

There is a ball-and-socket type joint that seems to screw onto the end
of the rack. Your inner tie rod starts here. Inner tie rod then ends at
the adjusting sleeve, which then connects to the OUTER tie rod end, which
goes to the steering knuckle as you described.

When you buy a new inner tie rod end for this car, it comes (I'm told)
with the complete ball-and-socket joint, and the piece that goes out to
the adjusting sleeve. A long rubber boot goes over the ball-and-socket,
and one end fastens to the rack. On the Vanagons, I'm told that the inner
tie rod ends for left and right side, are identical and can be swapped.

Sorry about the confusion.

Still need to know, tho... anyone ever replaced the INNER tie rod ends
on a Vanagon? I glanced at one, and it looks like you simply unscrew
(or unclamp or...???) the ball-and-socket from the end of the rack, and
unscrew the other end from the adjusting sleeve.

This seems too easy... there must be a secret gotcha, waiting to bite me
when I'm 1600 miles from home, up against a deadline, with no money, and
all the shops closed on a Friday night. Sorta like Hoover, only I'm not
that experienced, and probably not that stubborn (But close-- being
Irish helps IMHO).

Anyone been there, done that? Or even tried-and-died?
