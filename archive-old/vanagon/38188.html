For a few months now I have been a &quot;sniveling lurker&quot; but I've got an
opportunity to buy an '82 Vanagon and I need some advice.

In high school I had the '71 Orange Bus from Hell that I loved until a police
officer in a Mexican border town decided he loved it more (long story). Right
now I've got a '73 Thing that I manage to keep out of the shop more often
than not so I know a little bit about basic VW maintainance. But I'm not sure
what to think about getting a Vanagon with F.I. and a T4 motor that I know
nothing about. I'm sure the principles are the same but when I lift up that
engine cover and see all the stuff crawling around under it I get a headache.


The thing is the guy only wants $1000 for it. It's an L model with a nice
interior that's dirty but in very good shape. The body has a ding or two but
NO RUST which is amazing for this part of Texas. Other than a few cosmetics
it looks good. Motor wise it runs ok but it's rough until it warms up, no
smoke or horrible noises. The motor is original and has 113,000 miles on it.
The compression checked out as around 105 for all four cylinders give or take
a few pounds. It stops, shifts and rides ok. 

So I guess what I need is advice and/or moral support. For $1000 I can't
expect a perfect Bus, I'm just wondering how much it will cost me down the
road to make it a daily driver and weekend camper (rebuild$, parts$, etc$).

As usual any comments/advice are welcome. E-mail me directly if you like to
avoid clogging up the list.
