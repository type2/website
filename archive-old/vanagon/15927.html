I have often wondered about the purpose of putting a tach in a Vanagon-
putting one in the KG was hard enough since the top end is rarely above
4500 - though it does provide a sporty look. A tach is very useful for
setting the idle. 

I am wondering if the length of wire running from
front to back creates significant resistance and if so does this disrupt the
ignition system? DC
