Subject: Re: STICKERS AND T-SHIRTS and greed and so forth...


Skip's Hypermail archive seems to have been purged, so I can't quote.
Working from memory, here:

--&quot;You might have thought of how much the list would cost before you
started it.&quot;

I did think about it. What I concluded was that hopefully I could make list
stickers and T-shirts, and sell them if they were cool enough to buy, and
help to pay for the list that way. If not, I'd take the hit. This seemed to
me to be an excellent way to do things, as the list stayed free for
everybody regardless, nobody had to buy anything, and nobody (I thought)
would object to me making list stickers and list T-shirts for my own damn
list.

It still seems to me to be a good way to handle it. So secrets, no lies, no
subterfuge, no hidden costs borne by anybody who doesn't volunteer.

--&quot;Nobody charges for web pages, howcome you charge for the list?&quot;

No. There are no web pages that carry the kind of load that v_at_l &amp; type2
carry, that *don't* charge. How many times do you think 375 people check
their mail in 24 hours? Total? Those would be the hits on the page. Now
imagine 100K uploaded, another 100K downloaded, and 100K stored for the
digest. Daily.

The only web pages that get this kind of traffic either charge (the sex
sites) or are underwritten by a corp or university. No ISP will stand for
this kind of load without substantial upcharges.

--&quot;Other administrators don't charge for mailing lists.&quot;

I'm not charging. I haven't proposed charging. I have no intention of
charging, or wheedling for donations, either. I have simply proposed to
make some lousy stickers and T-shirts available. You wanna buy, buy. Don't,
don't.

I think the folks who are indignant over this are well aware that lists
cost money; they're only concerned that the costs of the list not be borne
by them personally. Who is greedy? Sending beer is an awfully nice
gesture--Gerry spends far more time on us than I ever imagined before I
started doing it myself, it's like herding cats, and he's very kind to do
it--but it does nothing at all to mitigate the cash cost of the list for
the people who pay for it.

Richard is okay with this. I'm okay with this. Evidently everybody on the
dry list is okay with this (you know what they're doing over there?
Chattering merrily away about gas heaters. No flame war).

All the squealing is coming from two people who, to my knowledge, have
never subscribed to the dry list or contributed to it in any way
whatsoever. Which makes me think that this isn't about &quot;concern&quot;, or
&quot;sadness&quot; over my &quot;greed&quot;. It's about sanctimony. And it's getting pretty
tiresome.

I think I'm done now. ;)
