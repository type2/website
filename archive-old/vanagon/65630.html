Subject:      More trouble

OK, I know that you guys are probably getting sick of me poping up on
the list and announcing that my 82 is fixed and then coming back in a
couple of days moaning about how its broke again, but here I am.  Here's
the deal:

Bought the Bentley book
Did the testing of the FI system
Replaced the bad Temp 2 sensor
Did all checks per the book
All checks are in spec

Engine starts cold (of course down here in West Texas that means
approximately 70 degrees in the morning),
Drive it to work (approx 5 miles) with no problem.
The day warms up (80-85 degrees) by lunchtime and when I get in the
beast to go home, it runs really rich, smokes and hardly makes it home.
Disgusted, I leave it at home and drive the wife's Hyundai back to work.
The day continues to heat up (approx 90 or so by 5 pm) and when I get
home, I start the beast and there is no problem.  No smoke, no rough
running, nothing!  WHAT AM I MISSING HERE?  (sorry to shout, but I'm
REALLY frustrated).  Has anyone got a clue?  I've searched the archives
to no avail.  HELP!!

Thanks in advance
