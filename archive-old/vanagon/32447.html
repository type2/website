My Netvergnugen experience is now compleat. I now feel like an official 
oldtimer. When I first joined this list, I got involved in the two great 
debates  of the mid 90's....

  - The heat &quot;Lever&quot; debate (some people only have THREE HAHAHAHAH!)

    -and- 

  - The little round silverish plug thing..what is it?

If I am not mistaeken, Martha is the official &quot;Keeper of the Silver Plug 
Thing Wisdom&quot;.
