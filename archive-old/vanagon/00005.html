&gt; This is a rather trepid announcement of my installation of the

&gt; 
&gt; The list is still called vanagon_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu, but you can send 
&gt; help,subscribe,unsubscribe,set vanagon digest messages to 
&gt; listserv_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu
&gt; 
&gt; As soon as I get a welcome message together, I'll post it to the list 
&gt; so you can forward it to your friends.
&gt; 
&gt; If there are any problems, I'll probably see them, but please send mail 
&gt; to me as gsker_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu if you see them first or you need some 
&gt; help with something.
&gt; 
&gt; Also, if you can spare a few seconds to quickly respond to this note so I 
&gt; know it got out there somewhere, that'd be nice (I can do that while the 
&gt; list is still small. &lt;smile&gt;)
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
