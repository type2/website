I come back from a conference and you guys are trashing my reputation 
in absentia.

You are both sick, and need to review the use of commas as 
parenthesizers (I just made that up!).  Rusty, my fiancee, should 
know better.  Or was that: Rusty, my fiancee should know better?

&gt; Rusty sez: 
&gt; That wacky Joe Clark, workin' at the prison, collecting bus tents and
&gt; polishing that sentence struture. Speaking of things that make you go
&gt; hmmm... (Not to mention burning rear ends.) Oooooh, JOE!!!!!! ;)
&gt; rvb\(not!)
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Thom mused:
&gt; &gt;You're getting married to _Rusty_?
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;because Joe Clark wrote:
&gt;  Rusty, my fiancee is asking me funny questions about you.
