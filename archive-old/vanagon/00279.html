I have frig. problems:

I've got an '85 Westphalia. I've used the refrigerator a lot over the 
years, and it was generally reliable. During the past year that has 
changed, and I can't seem to find any experts to fix it. Any suggestions?

I've had RV places take the frig. out, clean it, blow out the little tube 
underneath, replace some of the parts, but no go. I get the same response 
whenever I take it anywhere, which is that it was badly designed in the 
beginning, they usually never work, so it's not surprising it doesn't 
work after severl good years.
