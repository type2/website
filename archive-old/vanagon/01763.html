Subject: stripes

I don't know the easy way to get stripes off, if there is one.  Heating the
stripes with a hair dryer gets a little more of the stickum to stay with the
stripe rather than with the car, but it's a wash, I think, since the hair
dryer slows down the first pass (stripe off) and doesn't save that much on the
second pass (stickum off).

Best approach I know is to do the first pass on a sunny afternoon and the 
second pass the next morning when it's cool.  Also use a stool for both passes
if you're my age.

Obviously if there's a magic trick to make this easy, I need to know it too.
