Subject: Re: Syncro CV Madness..

I'll butt in since I'm in the middle (one axle done, one to go) of putting
new boots on the front of my synchro. In calling around about boots, I spoke
with a local NAPA dealer who said they show a new listing for rebuilt front
axles for the synchro. He called his supplier (Rayloc) and found out NAPA's
selling price will be $175(part no. 50-3471). Will be available soon, but
obviously not as cheap as Tim's price--especially with the great exchange
rate. At least it's another option as installing a rebuild sure sounds like a
good idea.

I bought a hypodermic type end for a standard grease gun. Wouldn't want to
use it for an insulin shot, but it probably would squeeze under the edge of a
boot--or even poke right through it if need be. Sharp tip, approx 1/32&quot; dia,
not expensive. Think I bought it a Wheels or some discount auto store.

VW dealer quoted me $44 for outside boot kit and $70 something for inner.
&quot;Can that be?&quot; I asked the parts guy--&quot;I don't want the whole joint&quot;. He
understood when I said I check around. Bought both boot kits for ten-fifty at
Univeral Joint Sales--wish they were the blue ones you guys mentioned--but at
least they're not ripped and cracked.
