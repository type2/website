I just learned that there are two varieties of air filters available for my 
'87 syncro. The standard filter is round and costs about $11. Then there is 
a heavy duty model for dusty environments that costs $68. It is oval 
shaped. Both filters fit in the same housing. Do any of you off-roaders use 
the expensive dusty-environment air filter? Seems pretty hard to justify 
the 6X cost factor over the standard filter.
