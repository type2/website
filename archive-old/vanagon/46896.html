Subject: Re: List Vultures/Parts Dealers and the List

WRT the points made by Tim Smith, Ron Salmon and Kyle Wade, I think there's
been enough discussion on the list.  There are a number of people interested
in the topic, but it's list management and NOT VW related.  Feel free to cc me
on your discussions if you think I can be swayed, but I'm going to be off list
for the next couple of weeks and I'd rather big flame wars and discussions of
the ethics of buying and selling on the list didn't go on ON the list.  It's a
good sticky discussion, but nothing is going to change with list management at
this time. 

Please take it up with each other and your lawyers.
Thanks.
