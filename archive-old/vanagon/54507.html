Subject: Re: Pop Top Seals - SAVE $15 NOW


&gt; I can get the original-style poptop seals at a good price from my
&gt; wholesaler, but I have to buy them in large quantity.  To do so, I would
&gt; need to sell at least a few of them quickly.  I'd be willing to offer them
&gt; to the list at a really cheap price if I could generate 3 or 4 orders out
&gt; of it, thus making it possible for me to order them.
&gt; 
&gt; How does $45 (plus UPS) sound for the pop-up section seal only, or $60 for
&gt; both the pop-up section and the luggage rack section?

A bit steep.

&gt; 
&gt; These seals use the metal clips like original (although I think they're
&gt; no-rust aluminum, if I'm not mistaken), and look similar to the original.
&gt; They replace the 3 vertical sides (where the poptop meets the side of the
&gt; bus).
&gt; 

SAVE $15 (at least)

As I've posted before, I have a cheaper solution, the exact same 
seal offered by WCM, Whitney, VW Canvas, and what I'm sure
Ron is offering  is available by the foot from McMaster-Carr Supply
company.  The price is $1.32 the foot for under 250 feet but goes
down above 250 feet.  A vanagon uses about 32 feet, say 34 for safety,
a Bus a bit less.  That puts us at $45 FOR THE ENTIRE VAN if
you want to order it today (well during business hours) yourself or
about $40 FOR THE ENTIRE VAN (after I had to pay individual
shipping) if we bulk order.  If you want to save yourself $15 and order
right now just call McMaster-Carr at (908)329-3200 and order part
number 1120A23 with bulb position &quot;A&quot;.  Their description (sometimes 
they ask) is Vinyl Protective Trim with Sponge Rubber Seal, and the 
bulb position &quot;A&quot; determines which side the bulb is on relative to 
the clip position and water seal.  Go out and measure and order 
exactly what you need for your particular van, I'd imagine a Bus will 
be under 30 feet so $40 (but its too cold for me to go look at the '78)
McMaster-Carr is open during normal east coast business hours and 
takes all major credit cards, and that price is shipped (and although 
they ship UPS ground, stuff from them never takes over 2-3 days 
anywhere in the US they got some kind of deal with UPS).

Now although Whitney supplies the same stuff for the part between
pop-top and luggage rack I'd re-use the part on the van (as Ron suggests)
for between the pieces as its clips do not rust and it will be OK 
plus this stuff does not fit well there.  WCM does supply a glue on 
piece for this in their kit, if you need that piece (wide 1.5&quot; flanged lip
seal) I'm afraid you better belt out the $70 or whatever WCM wants
for the set although their profit must be at least 100%. Anyway this
is the vinyl edged sponge rubber bulbed aluminum clipped, EXACTLY
as WCM provides, stuff I'm talking for  $45 total for a vanagon.  I've 
ordered the WCM kit for the '77 and this stuff is already on the '81 
and the mmaterial is IDENTICAL.  Go get it.

Oh one final alternative as of late last year VW Canada still sold 
the Bus and Vanagon OEM molded seals for like $350-$500, I'm actually 
going to order one if they are still available for the '77 for 
autenticity and collector (ooh I hate that word) purposes.

One more thing, for the front piece Whitney sells a possiblility, 
steel clipped and $29 for 25 feet, is a 13/16&quot; flap lip seal on an edge 
like the WCM stuff, part number 81FA2914B, in my 593C catalog, looks 
to me like it might work well, but I can not vouch for it, if someone 
would order, it would do about 4 buses for the pop-top to luggage 
rack seal if it worked out.
