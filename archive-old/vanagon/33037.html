Subject: Re: odd brick

 anyone=
&gt; have any guesses as to what it was..?

mebbe a mexican bus, they lok like 70's era bay window busses w/ a
professional black rad cover on the front. these vans (70's style are still
being made in mexico, they don't meet d.o.t. regulation in the usa so
importing them is out of the question. this subhject has been rehashed re:
importing beetles from mexico into the u.s.a.)

either that or someone did a good job installing an aftermarket engine on
their bus
