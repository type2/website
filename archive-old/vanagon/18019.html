Subject: Need fuel filler hose for '76


I took my gas tank out to replace a bad sending unit.  I had to cut the 
filler hose to get it off the tank.
NOW I CAN'T FIND A REPLACEMENT! :(

The hose I need is the one that connects to the tank.  Its about 2 1/16 
inches inside diameter.  It has one curve in it.
I've called a VW dealer, RMMW, and Bus Boys.

Does anyone know where I can get one?
