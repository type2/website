Subject: Re: #1 firing position on 009? (2.0 l FI)


The power curve for a 009 is usually described as more &quot;performance 
oriented&quot;: perhaps slightly earlier advance for better acceleration at 
the expense of slight (theroretical?) engine degredation. I doubt most of 
us would notice it....

Also, I was not referring to firing order, but rather firing *position* 
on the distributor cap.

Specifically, is the scratch on your distributor (that is supposed to 
mark #1 firing position) a few degrees *clockwise* or *counter-clockwise* 
of the notch that has to line up with the distributor cap ???

Also, adjusting valves is very important if you change the firing 
position such that #3 fires at the point where you had adjusted #1...
And BTW, our FI computers don't play with spark advance, but I'm 
considering installing a CDI module to do just that...

Hey WAIT A MINUTE ! If I install one of those CDI modules in my faulty 
distributor, it won't matter if the little centrifugal weights are 
advancing the timing correctly! I don't need to replace my distributor...

Boy, am I slow. So, is this a classic case of me talking enough that I solve 
my own problem? Comments please....

&gt; Wait, wait, wait -- you sound majorly confused. First off, I don't notice 
&gt; any  power curve problem with my 009 in my '73 w/'81 engine, nor did I in 
&gt; my '69 bus w/1600 engine (1750cc actually) --- secondly, there can't 
&gt; possibly be a difference in firing order, or the thing wouldn't run. 
&gt; Thirdly, valve settings have absolutely nothing to do with it. 
&gt;    However, I don't know that the 009 is going to work real well with 
&gt; fuel injection, since the FI computer will want to alter the spark advnce 
&gt; as well as the fuel delivery. Perhaps someone has tried it, and it 
&gt; doesn't significantly matter. I'd try it.

&gt;     All is impermanent, but this too shall pass away, and the way of the
