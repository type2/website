Has anyone here ever had to replace the rubber on the gas tank filler tube
on a '73 or there-abouts bus? Do you have to take the whole tank out to do
it?

   Please e-mail me as I read the list only on the web site. Thanx.

Microsoft isn't the answer. Microsoft is the question, and the answer is NO.
