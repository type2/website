Subject: Wiring diagram needed for 67 Rusty [T1]
Date: Sat, 29 Jun 1996 20:50:35 -0400

Evening all!

Hope everyone is enjoying the summer so far.  I am except for one thing that
has been particularly vexing...the tail/turn/brake lights on the 67!!!

Ok, the PO (or maybe PPO or PPPO) decided to see how many wires he could
splice together without starting a fire.  I've successfully isolated the
blinker wires and what acts like tail lights and what acts like a brake
light wire but don't think it's the correct wires.  For example, if I turn
on the light switch and have the dimmer all the way on, the tail lights
work.  If I adjust the dimmer, they (along with the instrument panel light)
go out.  Bummer.  Of course, the wire coming off of the headlight switch
gets spliced umpty-squat times before it makes it to the rear of the bus...
I can deal with that, though.  I just won't adjust the dimmer.

Brake lights are another story.  I'm going to assume that the brake light
shares the same filament as the turn signal, right?  Ok, in my bus I only
have one wire that gets +12V when the brake is on.  I can splice (shudder)
this wire to both of the turn signal connections and my brake lights work.
Of course, if I turn on a signal, both sides blink.  Doh!  My emergency
flashers don't work either.

What I'm wondering is:  is the wire coming from the brake switches supposed
to plug into the flasher relay somehow?  That would make some sense but it
doesn't explain why I have an extra wire going to the tail lights.  This
wire is inside the original wire loom, too.  &lt;sigh&gt;

Any help would be appreciated.  Any scanned wiring diagrams will be
rewarded!  Actually, there was a guy at http://www.oden.se/~fh/T2.HTML who
said he could provide any service manual sections for $3.  Anybody heard of
him?  The link is down now, I'll try again later.

L8R,

Bob J.
