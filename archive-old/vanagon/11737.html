Subject: instruments, interviews

	Folks,
	Since I haven't put my new engine in yet, it seems like 
this is the perfect time to be thinking about engine instruments.
I recall Martha Rubin had head temp, on one side, oil temp and pressure
and one other, in an upholstered binacle. 

	I'm thinking head temp with two senders- one from #3 and one from
#2 (opposite corners) and either a selector switch or two gauges, 
plus oil temp and pressure. Doesn't the head temp sender sandwich with t
he spark-plug washer? 

	Of course I'll use a dual sender pressure so the oil pressure idiot
light works. 

	For oil temp, I guess I use the 'dipstick' sender- anyone
have experience with this? Does it really work? How does it work?

	And, of course, a tachometer. I figure this can go in the
blanked hole the factory provided for a clock, and the rest can go
in one of those nice VDO rubber block mounts either below the dash
or maybe above the dash... view over the dash of a '70 isn't
going to be compromised by instruments above the center section...

	Other possibilities include volts and amps. Wacky possibilities
include transmission oil temp, exhaust gas temp, manifold vaccuum, 
a VDO clock... and an altimiter! :-)

	Anyone have suggestions/experiences/instruments you wished
you'd had or once saw? My engine is a single-port 1600, stock carb.


	I drove my 914, a very ratty looking 914, to one successful
interview. In fact, I recall, I wore a tee shirt and yellow shorts to the
second interview. But that's silicon valley for you!

	Cheers!
 
	Bill Abbott
