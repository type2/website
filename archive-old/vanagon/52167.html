Subject: Re: Good AND inexpensive tire pump, where to find?

&gt; If you want to skimp, then just buy 2 of these. The second one adds
&gt; insurance against the first one breaking, as one of our folks pointed 

So what ever happened to St Muirs super, screw into the spark plug pump
anybody know?  I think he detailed it as some sort of impulse thing
seperated from the actual cylinder charge but why not use one engine
cylinder itself instead, not a bad idea as disabling gas to one
cylinder a joke with FI.  One VW cylinder pumping is more than anyone
would ever need along with a good piece of hose, in fact maybe worth
a roll your own try using the remains of a $15 compression tester 
combined to a quick disconnect and then a piece of air hose.  Thoughts
anyone?  This is academic for a diesel owner unfortunately.
