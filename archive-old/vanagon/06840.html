Subject:      in case you don't receive any vanagon list stuff ...

something i just noticed:

if you don't receive any vanagon mail for a few days, you may have been
dropped from the list. it seems that if your mailbox fills up, some mailers
will return the email ... and it looks like listserv_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu will
drop you from the list (in order to protect itself from a flood of bounced
mail). so if you get lots of mail from other sources as well, and go off
for a few days (like holidays, hint hint hint!), then you might want to
check it out when you return.

assuming you'd still want to associate with this bunch. ;)
