Subject: DEF: Mini-Van?

Can someone tell me what the definition of a &quot;Mini-Van&quot; is?

A week ago, a headline on 5/12/97 &quot;The New York Times&quot; caught my eye and I
fed a dollar to the machine to snag a copy.

It read: &quot;For Mini-Vans, a Mid-Life Crisis at Age of 14&quot;.

&quot;Hmmm...&quot; I thought, &quot;The Bozobus is 36...&quot;

Why is it that the now-fifty-year-old product of Volkswagen is not
considered a 'Mini-Van'?  Is the Microbus too small?  Is the Vanagon too
large?  Every Type II (except for the Eurovan) is older than the vehicle
that one of the &quot;Big Three&quot; pretentiously calls &quot;the first Mini-Van&quot;.

I'm surprised that VW let this ridiculous claim slide by.
But, then again, I'm not...
