Subject: alternators-Bosch or otherwise?

the alternator in my 79 is about to die.  I have called around to get
price quotes on rebuilt ones.  Pep Boys has one with a lifetime
guarantee for $62.  It is not Bosch, though.  Another place has a 
Bosch one for $131 plus $30 core charge.  I then called to get a quote
on a used one from a VW mechanic.  I told him about the Pep Boys
product and what it cost, and he basically screamed saying &quot;They
just keep breaking and cause harm to the fuel injection system.&quot;
   
Anybody have experience with the off brand alternators with a lifetime
warranty?

Thanks, 
Paul
