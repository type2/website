&gt;The 4 cylinder 914 engine is a basically VW engine that was installed in 
&gt;411, 412 and buses starting in '72.  Size kept growing.  Added water 
&gt;jacket after a couple years in a Vanagon.

I have to disagree, there has never been a watercooled T IV engine.
The wasserboxer is based on the T1 design (not much left of it)
they share quite a few parts, the WB crank can even be used in a T1
case if the #1 main and flywheel seal groove are modified.

The heads of a 914 are different from a regular T IV in terms of
port design and valve sizes i believe.

Brian.
