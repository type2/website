Subject: inadequate cooling

Is my '86 Wasserboxer's inadequate cooling partly due to trapped air in 
upper engine compartment?  In aircraft baffling you must allow as much 
air exit as entry; so I would think 3 loouvered cutouts each side of oil 
tube access door extending to tail lights would help.  Has anyone else 
ever considered this?  Rawson Murdock
