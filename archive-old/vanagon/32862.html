Subject: Help Find the Oil Leak
Date: Mon, 15 Jan 96 11:08:00 PST


OK, I have now gotten to know my bus much more *carnally*  after spending my 
first weekend underneath it.  Just like any other first time experience, I 
have many questions about it, so here goes.

I knew I had an oil leak, but just guessed that it was the valve cover 
gaskets, I guessed wrong.  I did find a large amount of oil drip coming from 
the area around the cylinders, above the pushrods (on both sides of the 
engine).  This seems to be coming from around the heads, but they don't leak 
oil, right?  Any ideas?

During the compression check, #2 came up at 100, while everything else was 
at 115-120.  I did the oil in the cylinders thing and bumped it up to 115, 
which means a bad ring or something like that.  This engine has 35k on it, 
is a valve job this soon normal?  How long can I wait to do it?

BTW, this stuff is *FUN*.

TIA,

Bill
