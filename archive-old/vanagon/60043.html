Subject: Re: Road trip

Mike -
	Drove from Western MA to Southern Utah via Canada/Detroit/Nebraska/
Colorado last summer. Then headed North to Waterton, Alberta. Back across
North Dakota/Minn/UP/Algonquin. 8500 mi RT. Found many good places to camp
can recommend along traveled paths.
	Can't remember if your route is similar enough, but really recommend
the one I took out as excellent - have done it 3 times over last 12 years and
believe that it is exceptional as vs other more southerly routes. Keeps you
out of all that &quot;city&quot; traffic congestion, is cooler and more scenic. Have made
Denver in 2-4 days, this time elected shorter distance days to enjoy trip
more. Depends on your preference and what you want to see. Can probably provide
trip itinery for you with destinations/mileage. Please advise.
