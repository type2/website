Subject: Appropriate VW musicians....

 Jerry Garcia DID drive a beemer.  I wonder why all those Deadheads 
didn't.  I mean, he used drugs and the deadheads did.  Everything is causal 
isn't it?  Hey, why didn't all deadheads weigh 300+ pounds?

 So which musical groups should we sanction?  Hey,  the Beastie Boys 
early in their careers made VW emblems trendy fashion attire!  
Unfortunately, the Gap didn't stock them, and some of our Busses became 
unwilling donors to the fickle world of fashion....

Drugs:  Who cares.  It's a personal decision and a victimless crime; one 
willing seller and one willing buyer.  I don't see why the government 
should be in the business of protecting people from themselves, and if 
you are against drug use, then don't use drugs.

p.s.) I'm still looking for that VW promotional album from the early 60's;
  _Music to Build Cars By_.  Jazz with machinery noises in the background.
  
p.p.s.)  Saw the Dead at least a dozen times.  Amazing musicians.  
   I hope my sarchasm about Garcia's weight wasn't offensive.
