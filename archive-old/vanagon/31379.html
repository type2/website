**  Rant On **

I am out replacing the headlights and repairing a front signal light 
on my 85 Vanagon last night.  I pull the front left signal light to 
change the bulb and discover that the socket and connectors are 
rusted bad!.  I pull the socket out and begin trying to clean it off. 
 After a few minutes and not much luck, I decide to call the VW 
dealership nearby since it is really cold and due to get colder.
  They are open till midnight mon thru fri and I 
think to myself:  &quot;Hey, how much can a socket be?&quot;  Parts guy takes 
15 minutes looking up the part while I wait over the phone, comes 
back on line and says: &quot;I don't have it in stock but it is $45.00 and 
I can order one for next week.&quot;    What do I do?  I get out my files, 
sit down with coffee and cigar and get to work.  1 hour later it is 
clean enough to my satisfaction, I plug it in and it works.  

I hate to be crank but these prices coming out of VW dealership are 
ridiculous.  I have purchased (within the last year) a whole rear 
light lens and socket assembly for my BMW for about $50.  

** Rant Off **

Sorry guys, I just had to vent over that one.
