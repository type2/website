Ric fumed forth:

&gt;Jim....you and I have been calling Bentley on this one! I'm
&gt;just getting a little tired of their responses...besides they
&gt;have the arrangement with VWUS to publish the manuals here
&gt;in the states...so as they say &quot;$||it flows downhill&quot;. I
&gt;figure that VWUS now needs to get into the act.

Well, Ric, if it makes you feel any better, the story's the same
over here on the left coast, too.  Bentley probably figures the 
potential market for an EV manual is so small that we'd all die
off and they could move onto something more profitable, like,
uh, A3 Golf and Jetta manuals, or something...

With regards to your original post re: the AC fan kicking on 
high....  I gave it a shot and it appears that my fan comes on
at the low speed with the ignition on and the control lever
being moved from outside fresh air to bi-level AC.  Fan speed
stays constant regardless of which of the three AC settings is
selected.  
Also, when cruising on the open road, the temp needle hovers
around the 1/2 mark; the only time it goes above is if it's hot
and I have the AC running, and even then, it's only a fraction
of a hash mark.
