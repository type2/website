I had a new compressor and one new hose replaced last summer on my '85 and
it is terribly loud, most noticeable at idle.  It has seemed to have quieted
down since the new installation but it is still louder than I would like.
Oddly enough, the groan that I hear doesn't seem to come from the compressor
and is more apparent inside the car.  Listening at the engine, I hear no
groan at all.

My problem with the air conditioning is that I can never seem to get the
outside air cut off (yes I have checked the connection to the air box, that
lever is as far as it will go).  I end up stuffing the air inlet with foam
rubber for the summer to shut off the fresh air.  Unfortunately, this means
I can't use the fresh air on those days where it is occasionally cool enough
to not bother with the AC (which isn't all that effective, especially on
short trips).
