Howdy,
	Yesterday I went to pull and save (the same one that has the oval)
and saw a '58 single cab. 

	Sadly, all the good bits were gone :(  Visors, windsheilds, gas tank 
valve, door handles, seats.  It looked like all these things were there 
recently 'cause the paint was fresh underneath them all :( :( 

	I did get a wiper motor, and a door panel and a roof panel (the inside
cover thing) to use as patterns for my new ones.  I also got a smoothie
wheel with a bias ply tire.  I paid $8 for the tire and got the rest of
the goodies free!
