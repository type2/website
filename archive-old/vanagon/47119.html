Subject: '93 Eurovan

We, like Tim have had lots of trouble with our 93 EV (46K &amp; autobox)
however for the last several months it's been fine and we &quot;back in love&quot;
:). It survived a trip from New England to central PA  (visiting in-laws)
with much more grace than I did, actually.....

&gt;I've had lots of trouble with my 93 EV in the past (thankfully), but it's a
&gt;5-speed.  Lately I love mine.  It just turned over 42K miles and is still
&gt;running well.
