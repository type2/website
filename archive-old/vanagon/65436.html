&gt; Geez, I know I'm short and all, but how do you guys load bikes on
TOP of a
&gt; Vanagon with a roof rack?? A Synchro no less??

This is my first posting so bear with me.
I am able to load my santana tandem solo on the roof of my 85 vanagon
(and anything else with rain gutters) by placing the front fork dropouts
into the gutters, slowly climbing on the roof, standing on the rails of
the roofrack and rolling the big bike up the side of the van.
So far no complaints, no deaths.
To remove reverse the procedures.
For singles, I either stand on the roof rack and have them handed up,
or  the bikes or light enough that I can just stand in the driver or
passenger door frame and toss them into the bike mounts.
Another handy gadget is a foldable ballistic nylon ladder that hooks
onto the rack towers, clamps underneath the body and is pulled tight.
Adequate and compact.
Hope this helps.
Onward thru the fog
