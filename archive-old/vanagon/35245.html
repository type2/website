Subject: Oil Change/Car Wash Blues. (new antenna time)

I got my oil changed today, which is something i am going to do myself from
now on. 
(its just convenient, especially when at school)

One thing you should do before getting an oil change from a service station
is call the place and make sure they are not anal about you standing in the
service bay while they &quot;work.&quot;  Usually they do not know anything about
vanagons, and don't really care.  The best is being told to wait in the
lobby, and then having to tell them where the oil fill neck is.

Well on to the subject, i got a free car wash with the oil change and since
i had tons 'o mud on my van from the previous weekend (see earlier post) i
got my bus washed.  I tucked my 8' whip antenna under my luggage rack and
tried to put my AM/FM antenna as low as possible (do these go all the way
down??)  Well, in the wash this spinning wash &quot;monster&quot; tore my antenna
right off, while i watched 3 feet away helplessly.
