So martha rubin says:
&gt; Whatever you use, get the STRONGEST stuff you can find, and use a lot of it!
&gt; Mine looked *great* until the weather turned cold and damp, and things
&gt; slowly decended into a &quot;canopy.&quot;  :)

Funny, I always thought that if you sniffed it and it gave you a good buzz,
then that's what you wanted to use.  ;)
