&gt; connections last night and tried it out today...it doesn't work! the water
&gt; doesn't feel at all warm! I guess I should have used a longer bit of
&gt; 
&gt; Alistair, back to the drawing board
&gt; 
Of course this probably in retrospect might not work since the water
standing in the copper tube will not circulate and will hence be
colder than the rest of the radiator, only getting what it does
by conduction, still seemed a real good idea when he thought of it.
How about just coiling an extra long washer tube spiraly along a
radiator hose for a couple of inches, holding it on with electrical
tape or something, a long spiral should give a lot of surface for
heat transfer if it there isn't too much of a back up for the pump
to push it through.

My thoughts
