Subject: vanagon waterboxer leaks and leaks
Date: Wed, 14 Jun 1995 05:23:40 GMT


I have a sister-in-law who is struggling to survive financially. She
bought an 83 or 84 wasserboxer, new. And she has has to have the engine
pulled TWICE to fix leaks or a failed pump. The thing still is quick to
heat, she says.

I had heard that Volkswagen of America was admitting to some sort of
defect in these things. Is this true? Is there any chance she could get
an adjustment? She paid $800 for the first fix. It sat for a year or two
while she saved her money (she is a waitress, and she and her husband
are raising seven young kids (from two marriages). Her husband works in
construction and hurt his back and was out of work for  a LONG time. In
short, they need a break.

Any advice on how I could help her?
