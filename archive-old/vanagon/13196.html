&gt;
&gt;Man, this one really ticks me off.  I'll be passing someone going a few MPH
&gt;less than me and all-of-a-sudden, they can't stand the thought of a VW
&gt;Camper passing them and so they speed up.  What's with these people?

it's the bulk and shadow of the bus as you pull alongside of them. they do
it to the big truckers too. you ought to hear them bitch about it. something
about &quot;if i let that big thing pass me, i won't be able to see!!! agggghhhh&quot;

the ones that get me are the left-laners that come up on you from waaaaaaaaay
back very fast, then simply will NOT go on around in the left lane (we're
talking about an interstate 4-lane here). this, i have found, is the Horse
Syndrome: horses like to run in a pack, and it take special training to get
them to run off and leave the rest of the horses (like in race horses). so
the next time some left-laner comes up and stays beside you for five or six
minutes (or more), just remember: he's a horse('s butt!). :)

i'm trying to learn to Zen these things out ... there are just TOOOO many
idiots out there on the road, and i can't keep getting all bent out of shape
about each and every one. my ulcer just won't stand it. :) so i'm trying to
just relax and recognize that they are idiots, and that they have no idea
what they are doing or even that there is anyone anywhere around them.
ooooooooooommmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.

but don't you just love the ones that fly up beside you, then finally pass,
then slow down!!!!???   :)
oooooooooooooooooommmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmyasss. ;)
