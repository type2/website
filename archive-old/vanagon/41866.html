Josh,

Oops, I forgot to add that you *could* move the discs from the '73 to the
'68 with no problems, but as I said earlier, you will have problems if you
don't move the power assist servo too, and looking at the book, the '68 beam
makes no provision for the servo.  You might be best off moving the whole
'73 beam to the '68.  A big job, not technically difficult, but those beams
are VERY heavy.
