Subject: deer slepping

ive always found it odd how some animals can sleep so peaceful by the side
of the road. like deer and squirrel seem to have a passion for it like dogs
and cats.  

when i die, i want to go in my sleep, like my grandfather, not yelling and
screaming the other passengers in the car.
