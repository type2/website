Subject: almost finished with me crew cab resto. (needed parts)

i finally got to grive my bus last weekend.  it has been 9 months in the 
makings and the end is near.  i got the wheels finished and installed 
friday, teh electrical finished saturday and the engin sunday.  At first 
she did not want to start up.  varnish in the carb.  after rebuilding the 
carb and fuel pump, she started right up.  what a feeling of joy to here 
that old 40HP Bastard motor come to life.  after making sure it was not 
going to blow up on me i took here out for a little spin around the 
block.  oh how i miss the feeling of safari windows open driving down the 
road.  i drove it around the block and showed here off to a few 
neighbors.  one in particular, dustin retz (the guy who used to own the 
53/4 ambulance in hpt VW's a few years ago), he was impressed and wanted 
to know how much i wanted for it.  not for sale w/o some big bucks.

anyway, all i have left to do is finish the safari latches, head lights 
and radio.  i still have to find a tail light cover (anyone have a nice 
one) and get the engine crome cover from england (dave, do you know where 
it is?).  after that it is a few adjustments here and there and i think i 
will be done.  well, it will never really be done, but i will have alot 
more free time to devote to other things.

well, i am excited that it is almost done and that i have done a good 
job.  maybe i can get some pictures out there for the rest of you to see.

take care and God Bless
matt
