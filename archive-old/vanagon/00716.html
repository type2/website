Subject:      Today is a Holy day...

Today is a Holy day! I just payed off our 85 Vanagon Westy Camper. However, to
keep my happiness in check, a few days ago I had to go through a narrow area
at a loading zone at the University of Louisville. It is by the planetarium
and thus, they park 10 or so school buses in the middle of the thoroufare. As
it was rather narrow I was going about 2-3 mph. As I was nearing the front of
a bus, a woman was running to class and popped out from the front. Rather than
bump her, I moved a few inches to the left and a 3 ft high concrete post
scraped the tiny panel over my left rear tire. It should be no problem to
fix... it's just a little ugly... right on the part that is turned outwards.
If they hit me with a rather large body work estimate (aren't they all?) I'd
like to know what it would cost to get the little panel replaced.

Also, I tore up the damn window pull trying to get it off the driver door. I
tried to pry the little brown cover off where it is attached to the door. I
now need to get another one (anyone know where?) and I'd like to know the
proper way to get it on &amp; off w/o trashing it.

One last thing... I need to replace the CB/FM/AM (AM?) antenna. My CB is in
dash and the ant. I had was a combo job. I don't want a 2nd antenna because
you may as well advertize your &quot;free CB&quot;. Anyway, at the last Westfalia
Wanderers shindig someone had a regular AM/FM antenna and a unit in or on the
dash he called a &quot;transformer&quot; that let the CB work off the regular antenna.
Will this type of setup be very powerful? I've also seen the in-dash CB
antennae advertized in J.C.WhipMe and don't know if they'll be powerful
enough. Any answers?
