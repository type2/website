Subject: Re: 71 Westy and Door Handles

Hi folks,

&gt;Regarding broken door locks on '71 type II's.  Mine is broken on the 
&gt;drivers side.  My solution is to only unlock it from the outside.  If 
&gt;it won't open I have to turn the key, several times, to the lock 
&gt;position, then unlock.  Basically, turn the key back and forth until 
&gt;it opens.  

I also have this problem on my 71.  I've procrastinated the repair and do
the &quot;key back and forth method&quot; of unlocking.  Unfortunately, the torque
generated from this puts a strain on the pot metal lock barrel, and I broke
the barrel on one door--it split in half and came out with the key.  I did
have a spare barrel around that matched the grooves in the key, so all I had
to do was switch over the brass tumblers from the old barrel and do a little
filing.  Since I don't have any more spare lock parts lying around, I should
replace the spring soon.

As I remember, the spring we're talking about looks like a winding spring
you would find in an old clock.  Does anyone have the specs on that spring
so I can just buy a couple and put them in at my liesure?  In my case, the
springs aren't broken, just worn out and not doing their job of returning
the push button in the door handle.

Thanks,
Ron
