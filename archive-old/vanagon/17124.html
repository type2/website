&gt;&gt; Subject line says it all, Dave Schwarze has a line on a '63 back bumper

&gt;&gt;
&gt;Nope, the '63's have a slant at the front of rear bumper blade and the
&gt;66's had more of a pointed edge:

&gt;    side view:   63 =        /     66 =     \
&gt;                        ___/            ____/
&gt;
&gt;This start of the non-slant was late 64 as far as I could
&gt;tell, but it this is not an 'exact science'.  Of course you
&gt;could use the '63's whithout hurting anything.  It will fit
&gt;fine.
