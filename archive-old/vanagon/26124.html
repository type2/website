I have not been able to access the picture.  Is the address correct?

Also, Jim, where did you &quot;hear&quot; it's not coming to the US from?  C'mon, 
share your sources...

&gt;On the up side, I hear it's supposed to be available w/ the VR6  :-)

On the down side, I hear it's NOT coming to the USA.  Finally VW produces a
minivan with a potential for mass USA market appeal (it has that
all-important style thing) and they won't sen it to the USA.  :-(
