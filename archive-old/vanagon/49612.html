  Minor Correction, Red Rock Canyon is about 30-45 minutes 'South' of the
395-14 intersection.  If you are coming up 395, take a left (West) at the
Garlock turn off, and when you hit 14 take a right (North again) and you
are 5 minutes from RRC.  The Garlock turn-off is just after the bottom of
the long hill after you've passed Randsburg.


have fun
