&gt;Side note: Tech 2000 antifreeze has the same chemical composition as
&gt;the &quot;phosphate-free&quot; Pr#st*n# brand.
&gt;
Is that good or bad?

----
I've seen lots of talk about phosphate free prestone, zerex, etc, but 
I've yet to find any around here that *says* phosphate free on the 
bottle. Can anyone in BC tell me what they've found?

I've used the VW stuff on my Jetta, and don't mind the $15 /gallon, 
but if there's better (ie: longer life=less potential corrosion &lt;?&gt;) stuff
 out there, I'd rather use it on the Westy if I can.
