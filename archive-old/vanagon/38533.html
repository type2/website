Subject:       '71 SB for sale

A professor of mine has asked me to post this for him.  It's no bus, 
but if you know anyone that's interested, feel free to contact me or 
forward the message.

'71 Superbeetle for sale
New interior
manual choke
good compression (110 all around)
one owner
CDI with spare module
originally purchased in California 
$1500 OBO
 

The interior is very, very professional.  Some rust in heater 
channels, but pan is solid.  Includes tow bar and two snow tires.  
Also has a new pedal cluster.  

I offered to buy it, but the wife said no sale.  

I think he would be willing to arrange transportation to LA, the bay 
area, or Vegas.  The car is in Utah.

--Shaun
