&gt;      Here we go again,
&gt;      
&gt;      After a long (80 miles) drive last week I decided that something
&gt;      had to be done to my '64 heating system. It's got brand-new heater
&gt;      boxes, with new pipes and it's all wonderfully sealed and it's CRAP!
&gt;      

Hey Lee!

Does your van have the air control flaps removed or disengaged?  And how
about the thermostat.  Is it hooked up and functioning correctly?  I also
think that 6 miles in a bus really isn't very far to go and doubt that
it could heat up that big interior in sucha short trip.  It's probably
just getting warm when you get to your destination.
