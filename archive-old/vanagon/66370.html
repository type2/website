Todd:
You might consider Michelin LTX 195/75R14 M&amp;S. These have a slightly
larger diameter than the 205/70s, but fit fine on my syncro, and I
assume will fit on any Vanagon.
This is the Light Truck series from Michelin: 6 ply, reinforced
sidewalls, etc. For some reason, most tire stores don't think of these
when asked about tires for a Vanagon.  I'm very pleased with the dry
road handling of these tires.  They seem firm and grippy and pretty
quiet.  I haven't tried the M&amp;S aspect in the snow as yet, but I'll
post a report after our first ski trip this winter.
