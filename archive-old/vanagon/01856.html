 Hi,

 MAJOR Crosspost alert! This is posted to r.a.vw and the vintagvw
&amp; vanagon mailing lists- sorry for those who get fed up with it!
It should probably go to rec.autos.antique, too, but I don't hang
out there. If someone thinks it appropriate then feel free to
replicate it there.

&gt; I recently purchased a new book on transporters that has recently been
&gt; published and I am rather impressed with it.  I would recommend it to
&gt; anyone interested in VW transporters--the Splits, Bubble Windows and Wedges.
&gt; 
&gt; 'VW Bus Custom Handbook' by Laurence Meredith
&gt; Published in 1994 by Bay View Books Ltd.
&gt; The Red House
&gt; 25-26 Bridgeland Street
&gt; 100The Red House
&gt; 25-26 Bridgeland Street
&gt; Bideford, Devon  EX39 2PZ  (England)
&gt; ISBN 1 870979 47 8
&gt; 
&gt; The caption on the cover reads, &quot;Buying repair Tuning Custom&quot; and it's $15.95

 I got my copy this morning &amp; can confirm that it's a neat book.
It's brand new (listed as published in August '94) and has lots
of pictures and information about working on aircooled VW vans. It
doesn't cover anything watercooled, though. It has a strong UK
bias. The UK phone numbers are:

 Fax:	(+44/0) 237 421286

 I ordered mine yesterday &amp; it arrived this morning. They didn't
charge me for postage or packing. UK price is #12.95
I also got a catalogue from Bay View (small) which lists other
books in the VW section:
