I got mine, '81 Vanagon 2.0L, at Hoy Fox in Texas (1-800-289-4697)
for about $315 a couple three years ago.  Ouch.  Turns out I didn't
really need to replace it, the place where it had &quot;rusted through&quot;
was actually where some trailer-hitch installers cut off that
little pipe thingamajig.  Could have just patched it.

Hoy is usually pretty good price wise -- I seem to end up getting
most dealer-ish parts from them.
