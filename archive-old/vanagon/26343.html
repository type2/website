Subject: 1973 bus engine questions

hi everyone,
ok, i have a question or two.  i have a 1973 bus with a 1700 type IV
engine.  the books say i should have dual carbs, but i have only one
(a new weber, before that it was a solex).  did they make single carb
1700 engines or more likely someone switched.  how did they do that?  

since a few modifications seem to have been made how can i tell what
type of distributor i have?

thanks for all the help, one day i'll figure all this out:)  the last
mechanic i took it too totaly ripped me off so no more mechanics for
me if i can help it!  i just need to get a clue.

take care,
	brandy
