&gt;Just wanted to add that the new title says SALVAGE prominently, so there 
&gt;is no mistaking what you're getting. Some states don't do this.

Good point Bob, but I've heard of DMV screwing up and NOT putting it on 
there.  There are also problems with some insurance companies not 
covering salvage vehicles for certain types of policies.  I'm a bit
fuzzy here 'cause I haven't actually done it...
