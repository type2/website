&gt; DOH!!! Found the atlas. WOW now I know why they call them Camping Crazies.
&gt; This is going to be one heck of a drive for a two day weekend from Phoenix.
&gt; Does anyone know how long it takes to get to Red Rock from San Bernadino?
&gt; Would it be better to go from Barstow to Tehachapi via Mojave and then
&gt; north? or Barstow, Johannesburg and down. The second route looks longer on
&gt; the map.

You definately want to go Barstow -&gt; Four Corners -&gt; Johannesburg -&gt;RedRock.
I think it would be much wiser to take 60 out of Phoenix up to 93 to 40
and over to Barstow.  That way you would avoid the whole mess of San
bernadino and avoid climbing over the pass to the North of there.  My
first sentence assumes you are coming from 40.  Doesn't look like that
bad of a trip at all!
