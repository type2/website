Subject: Hes..Hes..Hesitation Problems


When you look up complete idiot in a dictionary, my picture is beside it. 

I'm new to the vw scene and slowly learning how things work on my '71 
bus. It runs fine except when I first start to press the gas coming out 
of a dead stop and shifting gears I get a hesitation and then it kicks in. 
I've set the timing,put a new fuel filter on, adjusted the points, and think 
I've adjsuted the fuel screw correctly. Could my my problem be in the 
vacum  lines? I'm clueless.  

Any advice would be much appreciated!!
