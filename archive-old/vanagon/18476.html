Has anyone delved into the mysteries of ECU's? I've got a spare one for
my '85 that runs the engine very rich. It would be nice to have a good
working spare. I'm speculating that the power transistors that drive 
the injectors are getting lazy and the injectors
are staying on longer than they should. Then of course the problem
could be caused by various other reasons.

I've taken it apart and found that it is easily serviceable. I'll do
some real troubleshooting when I get the time. Looking for a quick fix,
I thought I would just replace the transistors. Only one problem... the 
Phillips part numbers do not seem to cross reference. One parts person 
said this may have been done for proprietary reasons.  Thought I would 
seek some net wisdom on this. I'll list the numbers I see on the
transistors below. Also it uses an Intel 40 pin device that has 8425
printed on it. Anyone heard of it?

Identification as seen on transistor:

PH
ON823
m 8431

The second transistor is ON946 or ON945

Thanks for all help,

Steve
