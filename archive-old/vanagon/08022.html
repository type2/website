I am to my last straw on my carb on my 71 bus so I am now going to 
rebuild it.  I have a couple of questions.  RMMW shows rebuild kits 
for various Solexs but not mine.  Is that a typo?  If not where do I 
find a rebuild kit?  Also, I notice the price of the float is listed 
seperately.  Am I correct in assuming that I should go ahead and 
replace it at the time of the rebuild?  Also, Muir would have me 
remove the electromagnetic cutoff valve and the autochoke.  Ideas on 
this?  If removing the former is a good idea where do I get the plug 
he talks about for filling the hole?  I have pulled it and checked it 
and it does work.  Thanks for the help.  Any other advice about what I
should be looking for or doing while I have this thing apart would be 
appreciated.  Jim
