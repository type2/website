Subject: RE:  Weld heads


Regarding welding heads on wasserboxers.  I've had good luck with RIMCO.  
They charge $150.00 a pair to clean, resurface, install new valve 
guides, grind valves and seats, and leak check.  It's an extra $100.00 if 
both heads need to be welding prior to resurfacing.  The trick is to find 
a spare set of heads and have them reconditioned as necessary to minimize 
the down time.  A set of gaskets (MOFOCO charges $150.00), rings ($29.95 
- again MOFOCO), and rod bearings ($7.95), a long afternoon or perhaps a 
weekend, and most engines should be good for another fairly extensive 
number of miles.

If someone is interested, I'll be picking up the &quot;Viking Edition&quot; in 
Kansas City for a mad dash to Fairbanks, Alaska.  I'll have the original 
engine from the Viking Edition available for loan after that.  I'm not 
quite ready to part with the engine yet, as I still have plans on 
installing a wasserboxer in a VW Bug some day.
