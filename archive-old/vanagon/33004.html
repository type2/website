So Kevin Nugent says:
&gt; 
&gt; Hi all
&gt; I am watching a friends Westy ('84 'ish?). For the winter. Any suggestions
&gt; for maintenance besides keeping the tank full and starting it weekly? I am in
&gt; Colorado where it will be kept covered but outside.

Take it for a drive weekly.  Don't just run the engine.  Or the tires will
be flat on one side.  It also keeps the tranny and bearings lubed and burns
the corrosion off better.
