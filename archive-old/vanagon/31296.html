Subject: EV Engine Noise Relief

Hi All:

I have moaned to the list about the diesel-like clatter
which my new (1100 km) EV makes at idle.  Went in today
to have a few things put right.  Prepared for a fight,
armed with copies of V_at_L e-mails about piston slap and
engine rebuilds.  

Now please understand that OWASCO in Whitby Ontario is
one of those 'reference' dealers that VW actually listens
to.  They were familiar with the problem, and had a fix.

Seems that the return line to the gas tank has a sensor-
equipped valve in it, and it vibrates.  The assembly is
plastic.  The computer turns it on and off, and it is
the source for the clatter.

OWASCO has worked out a rubberized version with VW which
eliminates the noise.

My heartfelt thanks to Ralph Speelman, Service Manager,
and OWASCO.

Usual disclaimers apply.
