Subject: Autobox flush/fill ??

Getting ready to do this on the weekend, got the gasket/filter kit.  Any
words of advice before I douse myself and the drive with ATF? Bentley show
the torque converter being drained, once removed.  But no mention of
refill/quantities.  I can't tell, but I'd guess draining the trans is not
going to drain the torque converter, or is it.  Any advice about how to best
empty/flush this sucker? thanks, tim
