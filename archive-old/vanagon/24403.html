Subject: door roller hooped

Last week my sliding side door pretty much fell off when I opened it.
The metal wheel that the lower corner door bracket rolls on had fallen
off. I found it with the bearing race, but the bearings were gone. Does
anyone know if these bearing can be replaced and the wheel pressed back
onto the bracket? Or do I have to get a whole new bracket?

TIA,

Mark
