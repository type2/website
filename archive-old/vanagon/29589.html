A word of experience -- using something rigid but flexible is much
better than using something rigid and inflexible.  If you don't
already know how fast the piston is going to come up when you turn the
engine over, it's quite possible to have a screwdriver get caught at
an angle, with the possible consequence of scoring the cylinder wall
and or damaging the rim of the spark plug hole.

A drinking straw works, as long as it isn't one of those that are
designed to bend.  Straw as in a piece of alfalpha (or yard grass, if
you mow as often as I do) works, too.

Note that it's a little tricky to figure out the exact TDC using this
method, as there's some tolerance in the mechanical parts involved.
Besides normal tolerance, the piston will sit effectively still for a
few degrees at the top and bottom of the stroke, while the crankshaft
decides to push/pull instead of pull/push.  My solution has been to
repeat the experiment several times, noting where movement stops and
starts each time.  I then declare TDC to be the average of all of
those.

The above may have some level of misinformation in it.  It is based on
my experiences and reflections upon them.  The reflections are many,
but the experiences are less so.
