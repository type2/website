Subject: RE: Leaky Syncro

Hi Bob,

My NTM 87 Syncro is also leaking from the front of
the transmission where the drive shaft comes out.  Mine
is leaking at the seam between the very front housing
and the transmission casing.  I checked with the parts
and service departments at Valley Imports in Fargo, ND
and found out there isn't a gasket at the seam where
mine is leaking.  There is a sealant used instead.  I asked
service for an estimate to stop the leak and they told me 
it would be a minimum of 1 hour.  They also told me it 
could be longer if loctite was used on the drive shaft flange
bolts.  They have found this out from working on Audi
Quattros which have almost identical transmissions.

If it's the front transmission seal on yours that's leaking, it is
replaceable.  I have had Valley Imports replace it on my 85
Audi 4000 Quattro which now has 196,000 miles on it.  You 
must remove the bolts I spoke about above and drop the 
drive shaft at the end that comes out of the transmission. 
Then you can  remove the front transmission housing which
will allow you to get at the front seal to replace it ( at least you 
can on an Audi Quattro and the service manager thought you
could on a Vanagon also).  I found all this out last week from
the service manager at Valley Imports.

I haven't fixed my leak yet, but I intend to do it myself within
the next week.  I've been concentrating on converting my
Syncro into a camper this past week and haven't been driving
it much so it may actually end up being next weekend when
I get to the leak(s).

Oh, by the way, if you go to a VW dealer service department
and ask them about servicing your transmission leak they will
not have a microfiche that tells them the amount of labor for
working on the Syncro transmission.  I found this out at Valley
Imports also.

Please let me know how you come out and I'll do the same.

Kevin
