Subject: Killer VW web site!

Just in case that this is not old news to you all &lt; y'all &gt; here it is!

&quot;The Volkswagen Homepages Collection&quot; is located at:

http://www.powertech.no/%7Ejornhaug/vwindex1.htm

This is one of the nicest urls that I have seen. Congrats to whomever
designed it! ...and thanks for your efforts.
