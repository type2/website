Hi Brian (and Jon)-
	I am sending this response through Jon, as it is easier for me to 
do it this way.
	First, the 122 engine is an industrial engine. Industrial engines 
were first produced in 1952 and were numbered from 122-00001 up. It 
sounds like your engine was a &quot;B&quot; type engine, made in 1959 and 1960, but 
the engine number would be needed to make sure.
	Hope this is helpful.
