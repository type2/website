&gt; Hello,
&gt; 
&gt; Another solution to avoid dunking the engine is to mount a second trailer 
&gt; hitch on the front.  You get the idea.  A side benefit might be the ease 
&gt; that you can maneuver a trailer this way.

And why not just keep it that way.  You could drive the Vanagon 
around in reverse.  

Better yet, you could install that Corvair engine, and get the 4 
gears in reverse one in forward as was described earlier!  Cool!
