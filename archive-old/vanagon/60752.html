&gt; &gt;I am 5ft 10in and have no trouble adjusting the driver's seat to a
&gt; &gt;comfortable position.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;However, my wife, at 5ft 3in, has real problems.  The causes are the height
&gt; &gt;of the clutch and brake pedals and the long travel of the clutch pedal.
&gt; &gt;She has to lift her feet to reach the clutch and, if she sits at a
&gt; &gt;comfortable distance from the steering wheel, she has difficulty in fully
&gt; &gt;depressing the clutch.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Has anyone met this problem and can anyone offer any hints on modifications
&gt; &gt;to help.   (I thought of looking for a taller wife but that has certain
&gt; &gt;difficulties :-)  )

Related to this issue: Does anyone else have a hard time having a clear
view of the top portion of the speedometer while driving? The steering 
wheel is always in the way. I wish the westie had an adjustable steering
column.
