subject: Bubble cars, &amp; scooters

&gt;I got my first glimpse of something called a &quot;scooter car.&quot;  I only
&gt;saw it for a moment, but it was sorta like a motorcycle-sized thing,
&gt;but wrapped in a car body.  It had I think 2 wheels on the front,
&gt;and one on the back.

&gt;I'm fascinated!  Does anyone know anything about these cars?  When
&gt;and where made?  STill available?  Specs?  Success?  I'm told there
&gt;may even be some sort of scooter club, either on the 'net or off.

Yesterday I came across a classified add selling a Messerschmitt KR200 from
1961. The picture I'9m looking at shows a pretty sharp looking model. It kinda
looks like a - well a Messerschmitt fighter missing the rudder section and
wings. The text describes &quot;6new paint, passed state inspection, ready to drive
away. Many new parts&quot;9. The price asked is 38,000 Swedish kroner, which I
figure to  be about $5,200 U.S.A. 
	Unlike the BMW bubble car this has a long, narrow form, with place for two
persons inline. A plexi-glass dome top hinges to the side when crawling in
and out. 
	I also found two club listings in England: The Messerschmitt'9s Enthusiasts'9
Club, 5 The Green, Highworth, Wilts, SN6 7DB, England; and the other, The
Messerschmitt Owner'9s Club, Birches, Ashmores Lane, Rusper Horsham, West
Sussex, RH12 4PS England. tel. 0293 871417.	
	Hope this helps you out.
