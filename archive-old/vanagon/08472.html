Subject: Re: easier shifting in the rain

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Mine always shifts easier on rainy days.
&gt;&gt;I've tried to fing out which joint likes the lubrication, so that
&gt;&gt;I could pack a bit of grease on it, but I haven't been able
&gt;&gt;to determine where it is.   It must be near the back (if your letter is
&gt;&gt;any indication), I've always looked up closer to the front.
&gt;&gt;

Mine is just the opposite. After rainy days my shifter always became very
hard to shift, especially shifting from the 1st to the 2nd. I have not been
able to identify the cause and whichever joint to pack a lb of grease to
cure it. Any idea where I should look for?
