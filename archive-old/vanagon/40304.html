On the truckfone (CB19) I had a little discussion with on of the professionals.

Seems his view is that it's all political.  The &quot;cleaner&quot; gasolien (no sic)
won't move into the pipelines until June.  The monopolies hit the consumer
with an across the board 35% price increase for no obvious reason.  And as 
proof of this he offers the sidebar that diesel isn't changing at all but 
its price rise has matched the gasolien price.  So...the sooner we get Pres.
Clinton and her usurious husband outa there the better.  What if Lee Iacocca
ran the...naw too easy.  We'd have no deficit, be making record treasury    
profits and dominate the world in something other than CP Minivans.

One useless man is a pity, two's a law firm, three or more is a congress....

Put a businessman in the drivers seat and nationalize the greedy fu...rs.
