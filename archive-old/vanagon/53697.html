Subject: Re: (stant press test done) Coolant Bleeding Blunders

on a related topic...

i finally got around to pressure testing my system over Xmas after
replacing my waterpump.  had the test gear since last summer but been
putting it off.
i picked up a stant cooling system tester cheap in a pawn shop then got
vanagon tank/cap adaptor p/n's from the list (fdyen actually).  napa had
the belkamp adaptors in stock.  i'll include the #'s below if anyone's
interested.

the test was a good news, bad news kind of thing.

good news was my pump install held pressure and i found 5 hose leaks at
14.5 psi (1 mondo, 4 minor) and a cap that doesn't hold any pressure -- all
the leaks were just loose clamps.

bad news was dampness showed around the base of the cylinder cooling
jackets on each side.  i'm guessing a drop formed every ~3-5 minutes.

Question:  any experience out there w/ cooling jacket leaks/any recommendations?
torquing, barseal, r&amp;r topseal to reseal...

wife's now talking seriously about selling our beautiful brown baby.
arrgghh! the pressure's on (pun?)

OBTW, have done Master Haynes 2500 rpm bleed twice now w/ good success.  no
jacks, fast, easy, only slightly messing :-) and can be done solo w/ a
hammer handle stuck between front seat and throttle pedal.

many thanks,
dwight
