Subject:  Replacing rubber 

filler neck on '77

I noticed yesterday that the rubber part of the filler 
neck in the '77 
seems to be cracked.  I saw this mentioned before as a 
cause of fuel 
odors in the cabin, but I don't remember seeing what was 
involved in 
replacing it.  Is it very difficult?  I couldn't find a 
replacment part 
in the WCM catalog, so I guess I'll have to ask my local 
place and hope 
they have it.
