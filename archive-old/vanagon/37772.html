Subject: Looking for bus in Western MA

I am looking to buy my first car, which I hope to be a volkswagon bus,
preferably one of the cool looking 60's busses.  I know virtually nothing
about cars though, but am willing to learn how to fix things up.   Please
email me with any info you can on advice about buying a VW, or if you know
where I can find one in the Western MA area.

Thanx,
DaVe
