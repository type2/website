Well here is goes!
 I've been working on my homepage this summer.  My idea was to create a
visual manual with pictures and advice on how to maintain your 182B
Dometic Refrigerator.  Not just the basics but really how these
refrigerators work.  Go to this URL and look under Dometic Fridge Repair.

This page is continually being worked on so be patient.  If you have
anything that you think should be added then please e-mail me and let me
know.

 Wishing you all happy do-it-yourself projects!
