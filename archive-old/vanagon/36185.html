&gt;Once a guy made a still for the purpose of fermenting cow sh*t. He would
&gt;shovel cow flops into this little still and add water and let them rank,
&gt;and he rigged up a valved system to capture the methane in inner tubes.
&gt;Then he injected the methane into the throat of the carb on his lawn
&gt;tractor and rode around on it for about one minute until the tube went
&gt;flat.

the visual imagery conjured up by the above paragraph absolutely boggles my
mind. i can just picture the guy's neighbors, looking out of their windows
at some hick with an inner tube tied to his lawn mower.  :)

i tell ya, folks ... the government is putting something in our water!! it's
affecting everybody!!!!
