Subject: Re: Aux. Gas Heater -Eber...


&gt; Hi all:  Are Eberspacher gas heaters the only ones found on Vanagons
&gt;from the factory? I have come into possession of a complete Gas heater
&gt;from a aircooled Vanagon. It is flat and apears to be made of stainless.
&gt;I have never seen one before and am not sure what kind it is.

You probably have an Eberspacher BA6, which was the optional gas heater for 
the air-cooled Vanagons.  This was a relatively flat unit which mounted 
under the van. The fuel pump was mounted separately, as were relays and 
circuit breakers (under the dash), and dash control.  These are neccessary 
for the correct operation of the heater.
