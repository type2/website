I'll add another question to this note.

My temperature control levers are not lit up, so it's hard to see what the 
temperature controls are set at, when driving at night.  One of the two fan 
control dials is lit up.  What else is supposed to be lit up on an 84 
vanagon?  Are the temp control levers lit up?

&gt;Anyone know how to remove the speedo dash light on a '81 vanagon?
&gt;I have the plastic clip/housing out which is attached to the electrical
&gt;'ribbon' cable.  But I don't see how to pop out the bulb.  Thanks.

 -Scott.
