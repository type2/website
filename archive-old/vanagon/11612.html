Subject: Re: '90 better than '86?

Thanks for the info on the differences between the '86 and the '90 Westy 
= ZIP. The ones that I have seen wanted nearly 20K and I paid 11 some 3 
years ago, so if the total upgrades are heated mirrors and power lock 
doors - you have more than answered my question. I'll stick with my '86.
Thanks Steve.
