Subject: RE: HELP!!-Pricing for '87 VW Camper


     &gt;I have been wanting a VW Camper Van for over a year. I just found out
     &gt;about a '87 VW Camper van, GL model, that is for sale 5 miles from my
     &gt;house in the SF Bay Area. It has only 39,500 miles on it has the pop
     &gt;top, fridge, stove and sink, automatic transmission, air
     &gt;conditioning, cruise control. It hashad only one owner and has been
     &gt;kept in the garage.

     &gt;He is asking $19,500

     Jeesh! Even in California, that is  high! There was a (generally
     accepted as) much more desirable Syncro Westie in San Jose on the list
     yesterday:

     &gt;For Sale '87 Westfalia Synchro Camper. 4WD, AC, 67K, Clean, $15K
     &gt;415 424 8964

     You can look up the current retail and wholesale used car values at:
     gopher://gopher.enews_dot_com/11/showroom/edmunds.

     Check it out to get a feel for it, call your bank or credit union to
     find out what the local wholesale and retail values are, including the
     low mileage allowance, and at least try to hit a mark between the
     two...
