Subject:      mail archive for Aug

To out esteemed list operator,

I noticed that the mail archive for August 1997 stopped as of Aug 21. Thought
I'd mention it as I also saw no archive started for September 1997. The archive
shows;

-rw-r--r--  1 2925       641311 Aug  6 01:30 97.07.Z
-rw-r--r--  1 2925      1302990 Aug 21 01:30 97.08
-rw-r--r--  1 2925        27793 May  6  1995 gzip.exe
226 Transfer complete.

thanks

Richard
