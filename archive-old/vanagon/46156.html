Subject: 90 Vanagon Engine Woes

Seeking advice......1990 Vanagon--has sat at dealership for over 20 billable
hours; Master certified VW mechanic &quot;can not get to run any better&quot;.
  Problem:  when first starts, stalls several times.  Once running, engine
always stutters and sputs at idle while tach drifts up and down by several
hundred revs.  Gets really bad with a.c. on (Which is a lot in Phoenix in the
summer time).  HELP!!!!!!!!!  hope we are not damaging our motor--have
already gone through 3 motors in the 71' campmobile this year and am out of
repair cash!!!
