According to rapalmer_at_unity.ncsu_dot_edu:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; It is obvious that Joel needs things to do on Fridays, so here's some
&gt; &gt; additional fields of data for his list:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 7. Highest number of people carried in the van
&gt; 
&gt; 11 fairly comfortably for a 45 minute drive
&gt; (78 camper without refrigerator)
&gt; 

  17 fairly (un)comfortably for a short drive....my muffler has the 
  scrapes to prove it!!!!  I'll never do that again lest the underside
  of the bus be destroyed from bumps!!!  This one also counts for the
  # of drunk people without tossing their cookies  :)

Ken, '79 bus
