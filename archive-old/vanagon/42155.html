Subject: Selling EIGHT Corvairs, cheap!


Today is the day for those of you who yearn for high displacement to put up
or shut up. I am not making this up:

    CHEVROLET, 1961-65 Corvairs (8), (1) is 4 dr., needs restoring.
    $375 each. [901] 327-5162

All craft lying West Tennessee. I have not called, my DPs are fast enough
for me.

If the owner will split the cars and the drivetrains are out, I can go and
get the drivetrains and strap them to a pallet and send them to you common
freight. If he will split the cars and the drivetrains are still in, I'm
willing to do a limited amount of dismantling but I won't have any idea
what I'm doing. I've never even looked inside the boot of a Corvair.

If he will not split the cars, I'm not sure what to tell you. No way is my
wife going to let me put eight dead Corvairs in the yard, assuming they
even roll. Maybe two or so for a limited and well-defined period of time.

I'm at 901-371-9619 if you need me. Please don't call me before you call
the owner. That's all I know about this.
