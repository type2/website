Subject: '75 in CV hell (epic - part 1)

... so armed with $15 worth of grease &amp; gun, I ventured off to lube the wild
CV joints in my tok-tok-ing mango colored steed.  &quot;This will be a breeze&quot; sez
i, pondering deeply the good words i had found here and in the well thumbed
and cherished Idiots Guide to the VeeDub Galaxy.  
&quot;With Tom's notations on the home-based quikLube, I am poised to avoid
terminal hammering of my cv's and costly repairs projected by joel the good
vw wizard&quot;.  i mused while negotiating the slime pits and mud holes of Ray's
auto wrecking, run by inscrutable Calvin.  Cal sold me a sliding door hinge
complete with nylon rider and a pair of gen-u-whine lambskin seat covers
(from the black sheep) for $5. Joy! Not to mention a handful of spare dash
lamps; i haven't found the perfect passenger side mirror, but it's OK because
warming my hands around the oil drum of scrub oak and old plywood with Cal on
what became Ladies Day was satisfying to the hobo in me.  And then, more
complicated times reared their medusa's heads...

first I spent 45 minutes wrestling with my new, less-than-manageable moly
pumping grease gun (yes, it's black, it's slimy, it's *lubricant* and
everything it touches becomes slick as... well you know.) and watching the
dim light of day fade.  At least it isn't raining and this should'nt take too
long...

I finally got the behind jacked up ( bent a stand - oops, time for a *heavy
duty* pair, sorry pop...) and light rigged, and got comfortable down under
the *noisy* left outer joint.  Pushed and pulled, no play; side to side -
yep, there's that sound of Cap'n crunch between two rocks...  boots on both
ends are beginning to crease, but not leaking yet.  &quot;New boots in Spring&quot; i
thinks.  Over to the right side to do same and.... uh, oh some leaking here -
some *major* leaking here - some BREAKAGE here!!!  With rear held up, there's
a gap between the case-side joint and trans case.... and one plate hanging by
one *loose* allen screw, the other having been sheared off !!  Every single
screw was so loose I could turn them easily with fingers, and one I could
pull straight out..  and I've been _travelling_ in this condition!?!?!  I
can't even imagine what I'm going to find inside when I open 'er up... 

yes, I left the Pumpkin right where I can find her next weekend, when I pull
the wheels, tear apart, lube and clean and inspect cv's, replace (or not, I
hope!) bearings and all, definitely new boots, and probably a brake job into
the bargain.  No joy, this is my daily driver!!  But the VW deity has decided
it's time for me to learn a lesson.  Yes, Bob, I'm here for my religious
experience now...

If anybody's got this far and has an appropriate prayer or some sage advice,
I'm all ears.

One of the faithful...
