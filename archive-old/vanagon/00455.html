&gt; anybody else keep track of their mileage? anybody anywhere close to being as

I'm not quite that obsessed, but I do write down my miles and my gallons and
the cost whenever I fill up the tank.  I've gotten 22 mpg on a mix of 
highway and 17-19 mpg on just city driving.  I'd like to know how to 
improve that.  25 on the highway would be nice.  I also KNOW that if I drive
it a little hard in the city, the mileage goes down pretty quickly.  I drive
real conservatively.
