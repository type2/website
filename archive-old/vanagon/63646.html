&lt;&lt;  Found a place that carries A/C hose in
 bulk (made by Goodyear).  I bought about 30 feet, and got some special
 clamps.  The clamps look like regular hose clamps, but they're a bit
 sturdier and have a small metal hook tack-welded to the band.  The hook is
 used to make sure the clamps are installed at exactly the right position on
 the hose end.  I went home and cut off the OEM crimp clamps (they cut off
 very easily with a hacksaw, but be careful not to damage the metal
 connector pipe underneath the hose.)
 
 The Goodyear hose has thicker walls than OEM hoses, but the inside
 diameters are a teeny bit smaller.  I had to work hard pushing the old
 metal connectors into the new hose.  But once I finished, I was really
 pleased.  Kept A/C in the car for about two years...
 
 I've lost the charge again, but this is due to the compressor connectors
 coming loose.  I haven't figured out a way to keep those connections tight.
 Over time, engine vibration and motion seems to loose the connections.
 Then the O-rings get beat up, and the gas escapes.  With today's R12
 prices, I'll probably just go without.  So I've got nice hoses with no
 freon ... sigh. &gt;&gt;

Similiarly I had a A/C specialty shop make me up a new hose using my existing
connectors.  They have the &quot;factory&quot; style clamps and a special clamping tool
that crimps these clamps onto the hose like the &quot;space shuttle&quot; priced VW
hoses.  My new hose has lasted about 3 years so far.  My advice:  For A/C
stuff, go to an A/C specialist or do it yourself.

Good luck,
Jim Davis
