Subject: 87 westy

howdy all....
          ive got an 87 westy...drives great!  my question to anyone who
recognizes the symptoms...is, my alternater light is on now for at least 20
minutes before it finally goes out.....when it does go out,all is fine(camper
battery lights indicate correct voltage, green light).  does this sound like
my alternater is going?   or perhaps my voltage regulator?   because it
eventually kicks in...i keep going with the hope that it will correct
itself...;)   am i wasting time hoping its all right , when im clearly
experiencing a failing alternater?  if i need  to replace the
alternator..should i go with new? or remanufactured?  Im still trying things
to remedy my sliding door which opens a notch while im driving along....;( .
 any experience with this problem would be much apprecciated.
