 The sound of a single Vanagon horn is just too darn wimpy.  It sounds just
like
 the horn on my 66 Bug. The dual horns on my Audi sound alot better. Has
anyone
 added a second horn? Would it blow a fuse because of added current draw ?

I have added dual horns on my Vanagon.  I used a relay as the orn ground
circuit is through the steering colunm which creates a large voltage drop for
two horn applications.
