Subject: Re: Opinions on WCM/WolfsBWest?

Wolfsburg West:
I bought most of the rubber for the RFH from Wolfsburg West. I had mixed
impressions. The grey square-ish door trim for the cargo doors was sectioned
together so often that I had to juggle the pieces to minimize the visual
impact of the glue joints, the rear hatch seal didn't fit right and had to
be cut and superglued after a teeny minor-minor length trim. (Consideration
could be due to my inexperience). The front door kit was all wrong- not even
close in appearence- was all same grey square-ish type as cargo doors, tail
light seals didnt fit real well, fresh air vent flapper rubber was iffy, the
knee knocker trim piece was way too short to reflect stock appearence.
Several non repop items such as German visors were of course perfect. Window
seals and other items in the order were great.

West Cast Metric:
WCM was great about sending out a correct set of front door rubber and
correct looking knee knocker piece. Squarish rubber was darker grey black,
matched adjacent pieces in color but less beefy (depth) than the Wolf's grey
square-ish counter part. I have never had a bum deal with WCM.

I have never had a bum deal with WCM or Wolf'sBWest.  Both seem to operate
in an appropriate professional manner.
