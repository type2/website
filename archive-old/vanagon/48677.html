Subject: Brake Lights or lack therof

I had a fellow traveller notify me that I had no brake lights.
Checked the fuse, wiring, &amp; bulbs with nothing found wrong.
After re-reading the Bently, I found that the brake light switches, 
yes two of them, are actuated directly off the master cylinder.
Pulled the connector, jumped them electically and all worked ok.
After considerable grumbling about having to replace switches, 
re-bleed, re-fill hydraulics, I took a walk.
Upon further reflections I check the brake fluid resevoir, AH HA
it was way down low.  Filled it up and viola, brakes lights.
I figure that there was enough pressure to work the brakes but not 
enough to work the switches due to low fluid.
I know I know, I should find and fix the leak.  Later.
Anyway, if no brake lights check your fluid level.
Karma returned as the next day I was able to inform someone of the 
same lack of brake lights.
