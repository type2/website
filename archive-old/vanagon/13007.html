&gt;i am in the midst of restoring the body of my '73 bus (porsche under the
&gt;bonnet) and was wondering in anyone has seen spray masking material.  i

simple vaseline works for this ... but is not easily cleaned completely off.
check with home-repair places for a stick of stuff, used for masking the
glass for windows and doors.

&gt;also, how hard is it to take it the windows out.  that seems to be another
&gt;option.

actually, it's not THAT hard to take them out ... except for the front doors.
BUT ... then you'll be spraying all over the inside of the bus.

the best job is to take the windows out.
the next best is a really good tape masking. check for 3M masking tape with
  some plastic sheets attached ... allows you to mask a much larger area with
  much less effort.

it sounds hokey, but it's really true:
a good paint job is 90 percent preparation.
