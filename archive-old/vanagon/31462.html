Subject: Re: Class III Hitches; Skid Plates

Hello Fred, Derick,
Beleive it or not Derick,  the extra clearence hitch is fabricated excet for
the extra brackets needed to support the late model bumpers, (plastic trim
pieces).  The person that is doing the welding for me is getting slower and
slower for me.  I guess he isn't getting enough incentive.  I,ve just
completed 6 more college credits and with the long hours I put in at work and
all the vanagon work i've been doing,  I just haven't had the time to take on
making the hitches myself.  I am condidering it.  Right now, in addition to
the normal load of repair work,  I have a backlog of 4 Vanagon tranmissions
to rebuild.  One is a synchro that is almost done.  
By the way, you few nuts that abuse your vehicles are the only ones that have
even condidered the loss of &quot;Departure angle&quot; an issue.  the hitch as
originally designed does not extend below the bumper.  However, Having the
receiver extend from the cross brace instead of from below is not a problem.
 It should be noted however, that this change increases the distance from the
vehicle from to a hitch ball or mounted accesory.  This does slight decrease
the tounge wieght capability of the hitch.

I hope everyone has a Happy Holiday and I hope to talk to you both soon.

PS.  We did travel to Alaska in July, 93.  We toured all the usual spots and
we drove the Dalton Hwy. to Prudhoe Bay.  Believe it or not, we drove 11,700
miles without a flat.  However, the rear tires were pretty well worn.  I love
those Bridgestone Potenzas,(HP-41, 215-70-14).Now have over 60.000 miles on
front pair.
