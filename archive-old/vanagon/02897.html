&gt; Impending valve failure [$$$$] - that's the bad news.
&gt; 
&gt; Now I have to decide whether to just have a valve job or bite the bullet and
&gt; swap for a rebuilt engine.
&gt; 
&gt;I am leaning towards the rebuilt engine [$$ouch$$].  Given the frustration I've
&gt; had with my local mechanic, I want to choose the supplier.

Why have the whole engine rebuilt??  Are your rings or bearings shot?  Do
you have 200k miles on the motor?  If not, my advice to you is to leave
well enough alone and just get the heads rebuilt.  When you buy a rebuilt
engine you never know what you are getting.  You should be able to have
the valves, seats, and guides replaced for a few hundred dollars, plus a
few hundred more for labor.  

&gt;The only supplier that leaps to mind is Gex - are they ok?  Any other suppliers

Don't know about Gex, except that they mass-produce rebuilt engines.  Not
necessarily a good thing.
