Subject: Third time's the charm... 

I should have known that when people started talking about 
crashing VWs, and only two Transporters were mentioned, that I 
would have to provide the third one for the jinx.

Yup, I've redesigned some metal.

Saturday night last, after a great training session with the 
sub-aqua club, I was tearing home in my usual boisterous 
manner.  I got to one of the traffic lights, behind a '88 
Cavalier.  The lights changed to amber as the nice person in 
that car was *almost* on the junction.  He stopped dead - a 
complete standstill.  Now, I had judged that he would continue 
around the junction like every other sentient being on the 
planet, but no.  He was squatting on the junction itself.  Of 
course, I threw on the anchors but the road was really wet and 
greasy so I slid gracefully into the rear of the car.

Oh shit.

I'm in the wrong, naturally, being the crasher and not the 
crashee.  We got out and surveyed the damage.  Thank gawd, he 
had a tow-bar and I have a wonderful bull-bar and these 
immovable objects took the brunt of the impact. His car was 
squashed on the left rear and I broke his lights on that side 
too.

The Tranny suffered no more than a bent rib on the bull-bar!  
(phew!)

There were five people in his car at the time so I'm living in 
fear of a stream of whip-lash cases.  Thankfully, he seems to 
be an okay-type and is happy just for me to fix the car.  My 
body-shop man (who gives me a quantity discount - TRUE!) looked 
at his car today and said it will cost me about two hundred 
pounds.  Just what an unemployed Bushrat needs at Christmas - 
more expense.

So that's that.  I'm starting to get over the annoyance over my 
*extremely* stupid driving.  I'm just releaved that my 
pride-n-joy survived.

I'm off to England tomorrow, for three wonderful weeks of fun 
and over-eating.  So I'll take this opportunity to wish all of 
you a merry Christmas and a very happy New Year.  I look 
forward to filling the list with more rubbish, next January 8.  
(and if you want to rob my house while I'm away, note that I'm 
taking the hard-disk and hiding the Transporter.)

Three weeks away from the Internet, my computer and (gulp) my 
Tranny.  I'll report on VW cold turkey (!) when I return.  :)

Schponfirkle from the Bushrat,
         ;P.J.

*** Kent, England (tomorrow).  Ennis, Ireland (tonight).
*** Viva the Bushrats!    ***   Go Dale, #3!
*** Deck the vans with boughs of holly ...
