Subject: Plastic bag over distributor..

Hi All.  My '90 has a black plastic bag that is designed to fit over 
the distributor, and ignition leads.  It has elastic at the bottom, 
and at the top of the &quot;T&quot; where the ignition leads go.  

Over time, this bag is now starting to tear, and the plastic is 
getting brittle due to heat/age.  My question to the list, is this 
bag really necessary?  Is it worth replacing?  Any problems running 
without it?  I've never seen the distributor of any car covered like 
this before... kind of makes we wonder.

Appreciate any comments on this.

Harry.
