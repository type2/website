&gt; Does anyone know much about camping on BLM land?  I'm thinking
&gt; this will be a very useful resource for our group campouts.  It
&gt; means:
&gt; 
&gt; a.  no Winnebagos
&gt; b.  no generators
&gt; c.  privacy (and do we ever need it)
&gt; d.  no problems with reservations/space
&gt; e.  cost-free!!!!
&gt; f.  unadulterated land often in the wilderness and off the beaten
&gt;     track - away from businesses, tourists, etc.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, will be getting into reading this very soon, and curious
&gt; as to what other listmembers can add...
&gt; 
Well, My family spent one night on BLM land this summer, so I'll relate
my experience. 
BTW, from what I understand from some folks out there, BLM land is the
land taken back from the Indians when the government revoked their
community land grants. 
Anyway, what we found-
It was pretty cool, being free and all, but that also means no
facilities of any sort whatsoever. There actually were a lot of people
there, but not enough to be crowded or anything. You can have fires,
within fire circles, and can stay for like 2 weeks in the same spot. We
shared an area with 3 gentlemen who I guess you could classify as
nomads.
They, and their 4 dogs, were all living out of their vans, and seemed
fairly happy. They were nice fellows. 
Anyway, I recommend it, if you can find a good location. But don't
expect for everyone to just show up and find a spot together. Check it
out beforehand, so you know what to expect.
Richard
