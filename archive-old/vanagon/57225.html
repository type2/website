&gt; Hi all.
&gt; Does anyone know of a good source for sheepskin seat covers (front),
&gt; for
&gt; a '91 Westie? Thanks in advance,
&gt; Cris
&gt; '91 Westie (Trying to preserve its original upholstery)
&gt; '66 Kombi (getting ready for Tierra del Fuego)
&gt; '67 Deluxe (parts car)

No, but tangentially, I bought a wool mattress pad for the Westy GL
bed.  Expensive, but it will last a long time; it's much nicer than the
foam pad that was there before.  Was manufactured by:

Snug Fleece International
851 North Main
P.O. Box 1177
Pocatello, Idaho 83204

Their &quot;RV Full&quot; size pad is the same size as the Westy GL lower bed,
47x72 inches.  The Camping World chain store had &quot;Full&quot; size but not &quot;RV
Full&quot; which was only available in the mail-order catalog.  I don't know
if Camping World still sells them.

The &quot;SnugFleece&quot; pad stopped shedding wool fibers after a couple of
weeks of use, which is normal.  It has 4 elastic anchor straps on the
corners.  I have a &quot;TravaSak&quot; on top of it, which is a sort of wide
sleeping bag with removable sheets.
