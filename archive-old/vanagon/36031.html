Subject: VW Bus Heaven--Glowing Review


There was a message here less than a week ago concerning VW Bus Heaven of
Kingston, MA, to the effect that the phone no longer seemed to be in
service there. This sort of thing can really hurt a man's business, so in
case anybody got the impression that VW Bus Heaven is defunct, I want to
report this:

I ordered a bay-window rear apron from them last Wednesday, five working
days ago, and it was delivered today. The part is as described on the
phone--it's straight--and for $45 I think it's very fair. Nice people, too.
I don't know what went on with their phone, but don't count them out.
