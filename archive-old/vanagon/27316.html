Volks:  nearly EVERYONE has dropped out of our proposed camping trip.  Some
of you have had car problems, other familial problems, others schedule
changes beyond your control.  Nonetheless from the 30+ who originally
signed up to go in eagerness to Baja, we are now down to the following:

Bradley Prunehead          bradleym_at_netcom_dot_com                   
Martha Rubin               nrubin_at_s1.csuhayward_dot_edu              
Jack Stafford              stafford_at_alcor.hac_dot_com
David Schwarze             des.teleport_dot_com (but only for 24 hours)

Now, about 15 more of you told me at one time you were interested, but
either haven't responded, or told me you're on hold (but still haven't
responded).  If the &quot;maybe&quot; people could solidify, we'd know whether
this trip is a go or not.

The other option is to wait until 2 weeks later for Panamint Springs.

What's the concensus?
