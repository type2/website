Subject:      noodlin', PEE-cans, and JOEL

Actually, the description of noodlin' was nearly correct (sans alcohol). Here
in KY, there is a season for NOODLING as well as TICKLING. For the life of me
, I can't figure out the difference. However, this &quot;activity&quot; involves
reaching up into holes, undercut banks, and &quot;dens&quot; for both fish and... now
get ready. .. SNAPPING TURTLES. The latter is one of the more insane things
I've ever witnessed. Some of those guys have scars and may even be missing
digits. Also, contrary to what you may think, fish have teeth. Also, once
something gets to the size of the fish these folks pull from holes, painful
bites are very possible.


RE: culinary info... Joel, I'm so ashamed. I thought you were a southern
gentleman. Those rumors of CIA LSD testing on you during the late 60s may be
true. If it ain't PEE-can, it ain't edible!!! Puh-KAHN is for the frozen
northerners and those left coasters. Joel, I know a guy who knows a
deprogrammer that might be able to help you with that pronunciation problem
