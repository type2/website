Subject: Idle problems


    After replacing the transmission in my '71 camper, resetting the  
points and the timing, I have found I have a problem with the idle. 
The idle is set at around 850 rpm and normally runs fine apart from 
when comeing to a fairly rapid stop at lights and such, when it cuts 
out. Does anyone have any suggestions? I can't quite figure this one 
out. Thanks in advance.

                        Cheers
                                Jon
