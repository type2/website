Subject: VDO 0-70 PSI OP Sender Part Number Wanted

Hi folks,

I purchased an aftermarket VDO oil pressure gauge at a swap meet a few weeks
ago.  Unlike 99% of the VDO OP gauges out there that range from 0-80 PSI,
the gauge I have ranges from 0-70 PSI.  The VDO Part # on the gauge is:  350
271 / 2 / 4 12V.

I've tried emailing Busboys and faxing VDO directly to get a matching
sender, but I haven't heard back from either of them.  I probably could get
away with using a sender for the 0-80 PSI, but I'd much rather have an
accurate reading, not just a relative reading to go by.  BTW, if anyone can
provide me with the correct VDO sender number to match my gauge, I'd prefer
a dual terminal sender so I can retain the stock dash warning light.

Thanks,


Ron
