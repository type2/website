Subject: Re: Elec Ig and low revs

&gt;I have a question about electronic ignition.  I understand the benefit
&gt;derived from these in terms of better spark throughout the rpm range. 
&gt;Better being stronger and more even.  Now, besides the obivious of not
&gt;having to set points, would I get the same increase in spark benefit 
&gt;from a motor that will hopefully never be run much over 4,400 rpm?  
&gt;Will the stock system provide an even enough spark in that rpm range? 
&gt;I am thinking an 009 and a tach might be all the ignition I need.  
&gt;This would be the same stock 1600DP with dual kadrons, extractor and 
&gt;SINGLE springs.  Thanks, Jim

Shimmed, Heavy Duty singles I hope.  

The 009 does a great job, get the stripped wire with the stronger spring.
Go with David there, get the stock system 105% and it'll be happy.  

So, while I'm here, may I suggest that you get the heater fix kit for your
headers.  I feel so good about having flanges brazed to the heater/extractor
connection that I want to encourage anyone who has the engine out to go for
it. Just think, no more leaking, loud VW muffler system.  The total cost may
seem like alot (torch, 4-5 oxygen bottles, kit, etc.) but I have never been
able to get that connection tight and keep it tight over the life of the
engine, or even the headers!  Brazing not that hard, like soldering, except
hotter.  I had never brazed anything before I did my oil pick-up tube and
headers.  Though I have done alot of copper water pipe soldering.  Set-up is
the most important part.

Sincerely,
Eugene
