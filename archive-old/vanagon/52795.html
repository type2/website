&gt;Hey! Now just wait a minute!! What a great life! Anyone know how one becomes
&gt;a deer?  Is it a club or something?  Do they have a secret handshake? Do
&gt;they wander over the highway to have sex?  or to look at vanagons? I just
&gt;want to be deer...

... you'll always be very deer to us. :)

&gt;PS: it's still friday ain't it?
&gt;PPS: now moose, they're altogether different I hear.

yup. folks want to be Elk or deer, but ain't nobody ever said they'd rather
be moosed.

which reminds me of the old joke:

Antlers in the Treetops
