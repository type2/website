Subject: Re: Towing a Bus


&gt;The bus
&gt;has little loops welded to the front of the frame intended for towing use.
                                                            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Actually I think these are for chaining the car to the deck of the ship
that brings it over from Germany to the US, and for similar securing
to the truck that brings it from the port to the dealer. Still work for
towing, though.
