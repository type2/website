&gt;As an ex-jeep racer, I am familiar with fuel pressure gauges, and 
would like &gt;to offer a word of caution as to mounting mechanical fuel 
pressure gauges in &gt;the drivers cockpit.  If the gauge developes a leak 
you will introduce raw &gt;fuel, at pump pressure into the passanger 
compartment.  
&gt;Just a word of caution.

Good words.  I neglected to mention the desirability of having a flow 
restrictor in the line.  I run a sheet metal screw into a brass fitting 
until it just drips fluid at op pressure.  I then cut the head off the 
screw so the fitting can be assembled and mounted near the main line.  
I do the same with oil pressure gauges.  Hot oil in your crotch is even 
less friendly than cold gas.  

For the Djet and Ljet fuel rail connection, I have just slotted the 
plug screw's threads so it leaks and then put the hose over it.

&gt;    No idea is so good it can't be improved.
