Subject: Tents for Vanagons German exchange rates

I checked out the web site dedicated to VW tents.  Very cool!  Does anyone
have experience with the Reimo tents for Westy's?  The Gemini, Vento and
Premavera models all look great.

Can someone help me with the German exchange:  How much is $1800 DM for
example?

Thanks
