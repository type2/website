About that V6anagon... Don't know if you are aware, but up here in the LA
area, there's an outfit that advertises in the Recycler, Brand New complete
Chevy 2.8L engines, with or without AC for something like 900 bucks.  I
went off to find the Recyc (notice the pause?) to get the name of the
outfit and the actual price, but the spousal unit must have thrown my last
week's issue away (or the bird is busy shitting on it).  They're advertised
for Troopers and Blazers and stuff, and I'm not sure about using them in a
Vanagon (Kennedy's catalog recommends that the engine not be newer than
about 5 years above the vehicle's age).
