Subject: RE: safety/liability questions


&gt;There was a case of a VW Thing overturning
&gt;during an evasive manuveur.  Based on a computer simulation, the accident
&gt;could have been avoided if VW had designed the thing with a CG 1 inch
&gt;lower.


Also coulda been avoided if he hadn't hit that curb sideways...
