Subject: FS: '85 Westy Camper Interior, Price Reduced 

The '85 parts Westy GL just made it to my house, after a stop at a 
local shop where the engine was transplanted into another list 
member's Westy.

My wife and I are leaving for a long cross country trip at the 
start of the Labor Day weekend, and I hope to strip &amp; junk what's 
left of the Westy before we leave, as I have nowhere to store it.

That being the case, I'd like to reduce the asking price for the 
complete interior to $675, if I can sell it quickly. Since I 
described it before I won't waste bandwidth again, but basically it 
includes everything behind the front seats.  Sofabed, sink, stove, 
fridge, tables, all cabinetry, etc., all in nice shape. I'll help 
you remove it. I'm located in Pa., between Phila. and Allentown.

Also have the poptop, with good canvas, if anyone is interested.

Thanks,
Ron Salmon
