&gt; Yep, buses are certainly suspicious vehicles :) I lived in the Southeast US

&lt;As the cops&gt;  &quot;Yuh mean cuzzin Jim-Bob?&quot;

Most of the fuzzy-dice folks are the good-old boys same as the cops 
backgrounds.  This is all of course in the 'red-neck' portions of the 
state (SW and SE).  In the snobbish portions (NoVa) they don;t go so much 
for fuzzy dice.   I grew up in the Shenandoah Valley (red-neck) and now 
live in Northern Virgina (Snob) so I've had to deal with both parts.

The red-neck sections don't rightly like them hippie folks and the 
snobbish folks don't often see them.  I've been hassled by troopers 
before - long hair and software engineer clothing whcih also happens to 
fit drug runner profiles.  But this was in my old sports car not the 
Eurovan.  We'll see when I get the Things running.
