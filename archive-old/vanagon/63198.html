Ivan -

I don't have the Pocket Mechanic for the Vanagon listed in my book
supplier's inventory list but I will call them anyway tomorrow (Tuesday)
morning as I have to refill stocks because of selling them over the past
few shows I've attended as a vendor.  I'll see if they have it available
or if it will be available soon.

What I do have is Brookland's &quot;VW Volkswagen Transporter Workshop Manual
82-On&quot;.  Description says it &quot;Covers all VW Vehicles in Station Wagon,
Transporter and Bus Range (Type 2 Vehicles) with water-cooled carburetors
or fuel injection engines&quot;.  I have not seen the inside of the book and
is only about a 1/2&quot; thick.  People who have bought them from me have
said they like it because of it's leanings towards models imported into
the UK.  Price is $29.95 plus $4 shipping (Order ZAB-VW82WH).

The VW Bus Custom Handbook is another book that I consistently sell out
and will be re-ordering tomorrow morning as well as I am out of it right
now.  Should have more at the end of the week.  Price is $15.95 plus $4
shipping (Order ZAB-119942).  This book however treats the Vanagon as an
afterthought in my opinion.  It deals heavily with Splitties and Bay
Windows?Breadloafs.
