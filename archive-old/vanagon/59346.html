Subject: Re: the lure of the Syncro

Hi David, check this out, 
http://pwp_dot_usa.pipeline_dot_com/~tforhan/swhome.htm

and  the ol' blue book at,
http://www.kbb_dot_com/buynew.html

 My decision to buy syncro was justified on my 1st trip down to S.Utah
for some early spring biking/hiking. Welll, it snowed sideways almost
half the time but the syncro handled it beautifully. NO price for peace
of mind.
Luck, 
Jay

&gt; I've got a lead on an '87 syncro w/113K westy (base camper - fridge,
&gt; poptop).  (I haven't seen this yet.....was this configuration produced?)
&gt; 
&gt; First, how much does the syncro add to the selling price of these typically?
&gt; (I knnow that this is kind of a ridiculous question, but I just haven't
&gt; seen any syncro westies that weren't full campers)
&gt; 
&gt; Second, how do you test whether or not the syncro works properly?
&gt; 
&gt; I've readd enough to know the rest of the deal, but I've generally
&gt; ignored the syncro posts except those that mention how much tranny
&gt; problems cost.  Actually, for those who know, is there a typical tranny
&gt; repair that syncro owners encounter at some point analagous to the head
&gt; gasket problem?
&gt; 
&gt; If it's in good shape (and I've been told that there's a complete set of
&gt; repair records), then it may sell fast.  So, any replies that y'all can
&gt; make today would be appreciated.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks  for the help.
