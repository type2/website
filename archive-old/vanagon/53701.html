--  Listees,

  This Vanagon For Sale, If interested e-mail me or phone me a I can give more 
details!

  7 passenger, Light blue over Dark Blue.  Brown interior in fair to good shape.
  1.8 GTI engine, Blown-up.  Converted about 6 years ago.  $1200.00

  A great van We've serviced it for a Number of years and If I needed another van I'd 
be grabbing this one for me!

  If I don't get interested people quickly on this van I'll probably be parting it
