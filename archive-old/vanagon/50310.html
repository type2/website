When I buy a gallon of coolant I buy a gallon of distilled water too.
        I was mixing it 60/40 or 70/30 for my 86. When I found out that the
&quot;richer&quot; mixture caused my coolant lite to blink all the time I went to
50/50 again. Lite works good now, I just hope the 50/50 will make it thru
our winter.
