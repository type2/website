Subject: Re: Wierd emblem..

Hi Chris,
you found an emblem of the K 70 L (75 PS)! It has an front motor (but
watercoooled) 4 cyl. inline engine (75 or 100 PS). Looks like the frist
passat (4 door) models but have their own platfrom, not very successful
her in europe, I think VW starts the production in early 70 and stoped
it 76 or so. I saw one or two at my visit at the VW museum in Wolfburg,
maybe you find some webpages with fotos from there.

Greetings from old Germany
