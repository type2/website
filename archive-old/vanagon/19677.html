&gt; 1. I recently moved to Dallas and the Van doesn't have air-conditioning.
&gt; As far as I know, it is not possible to hook this engine up to an
&gt; air-conditioner. Does anybody have any information about this? Is there
&gt; any other way to do anything about this problem? What do our air-cooled
&gt; friends do in this country?

I've never seen a diesel van with air conditioning.  I suppose you could
use the plumbing, condenser and evaporator paraphernelia from any vanagon,
but finding a place to put the compressor may be a problem.  Some diesel
rabbits have air conditioning.  They use a high alternator mount that
positions the alt. up next to the injector pump.  The air cond. compressor
is then mounted low, about where the alternator would have been.  When the
engine is leaned over to the left in the Vanagon position, I'm afraid the
engine cover may hit the alternator.  I would suggest looking in wreaking
yards for various types of compressor mounts from diesel rabbits or
jettas.  There might be a mount, compressor and pulley system that will 
work. You also might try calling some aftermarket airconditioning dealers 
or manufacturers to see if they know anyone who produced an A/C system 
for the diesel Vanagon.  It's a long shot...  Good luck Joerg.

Has anyone out there tried to convert to A/C?
