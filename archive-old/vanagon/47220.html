&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Well the crazies have struck again!!!! I have the opportunity to buy an 86 
&gt;&gt; Westy Synchro w/55k miles, original owner - third car in fleet, for approx 
&gt;&gt; $10k. The body is straight, the interior has hardly been used, etc...etc...
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; 1. Am I crazy??? (ok.... as it applies to the above dilemma....)

I never thought I would see it--Ric and Steven piloting the same type of
transporter. Does this mean they'll have to find something else to argue
about now?
