&gt;I tried this, but netscape said the request didn't have a DNS entry.
&gt;Are you sure the info was ok?

Ellis says:
Although I was originally given the address only as &lt; http://www.tig_dot_com &gt;
you may want to try using &lt; http://home.tig_dot_com/cgi-bin/genobject/index &gt;
which is the complete address as shown once the site displays.

Once in try looking up your home address. I did and got an immediate
neighborhood site map with my home identified at the 40 acre level! =)
Good thing I wore a robe when I was in the back yard this AM ;)
