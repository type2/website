Subject: 79 Bus For Sale

Time has come to sell my 79 bus.  There is a hole in the gas tank, and I
don't have the time to fix it.  Here are some facs about the bus:
-1979 VW Bus Original Red/White
-Original Motor Transmission 205,000 miles and still very strong
-Many new parts, including starter and alternator
-driven daily-12,000 miles a year.  Very dependable
-running great up until 5/17/96, when the gas leak began
-body is in fair condition.  Rust in normal spots but not bad yet
-interior is extremely clean

This bus is located near Baltimore Maryland.
I am now accepting any offers on it.
Please make an offer!

Paul
