Subject: f/ derek's packing list


So, good ol' Derek Drew writes that he takes the following in his camper, and 
busgirl just can't resist commenting on the items in the packing list...

in the camper proper:
  Shot Glass
  Vodka - beer isn't good enough already?
and in the pantry upper shelf:
  Shot glasses (two) - but you already HAVE one in the other section!  Why not 
drink directly
       from the bottle and save space/weight?

general:
  Tool Pouch - since when are pouches necessary?
  Tape Measure - length or girth?
  Armrest - doesn't it get in the way?
  Rolaids - guilt causing stress?
  Seabands - you like the Navy ensemble playing Sousa?
  Anti Fog Spray - wouldn't you welcome the privacy?
  Toilet Paper (2+ rolls) - you didn't mention a porta-potti
  Little John and Lady J Attachment - is this like a venus butterfly?
  Bungie Cord - kink thrills, huh?
  Duct Tape - no gerbils or hamsters?
  Rubbers for Shoes - nothing is safe nowdays
  3m rubber protector - the more precautions the better
  Car Bra - midlife sag?
  Spare Razor Blade - just in case the tranny bites the dust after all

Roof Shelf Bag
  6 condoms - 6?????????????????????????  on the roof???????????????????  oh 
my...
  EAR plugs - for you, or for the campers in the next site?
  2 eyepatches - see above
  6 more pair EAR plugs - how many sites away do you feel guilty about the 
&quot;sound&quot; travelling?
  Antacid - chronic anxiety problem over the exhibitionism, huh?  
  Earmuffs - I guess if you're on the roof, you might want to pass out 
blinders, too.
  Kleenex (2 Or 3) - is this REALLY enough?  
  Paper Towels (2 Or 3) - ditto
  Pom Pom - I'm not going to touch this one with a 10 foot pole.
  Front Windshield curtain - why?  I thought you were on the roof
  Rear Hatch Screen - doesn't this impede access?
  Chapstick - I can just imagine  :)

Forgive me, brethren, I couldn't resist  :)
