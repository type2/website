&gt; Just a few questions / thoughts..
&gt; 
&gt; 1) I'm almost done the lastest bus engine. Muldooned from several engines,
&gt; but it should be good for a while. This summer I'm building a good engine
&gt; (stock, but high quality).. Does anyone know where New/NOS T4 cases could
&gt; be found? How much?

I wouldn't waste my money on a new case (well, &quot;waste&quot; may be a little
strong).  Aluminum does not fatigue like the magnesium T-1 case, so an
old one should be as good as a new one.  I have no reason to doubt this,
having done two successful T-4 rebuilds.

&gt; 2) I've heard that the T4 case (being aluminium) is much more tolerant and
&gt; produces better quality than a T1 when align bored. True?

Hmmm... I would suspect that is true, but I didn't have my case align
bored.  The people I talked to said it was not a good idea, but I don't
remember their reasons.  If your old case is within specs, don't worry
about it.

&gt; 3) Seeing as Berg don't do T4's, can y'all recommend someone who sells top
&gt; quality full rebuild kits? (crank, cam, etc.)

I don't remember seeing any such kits, although I didn't look very hard 
(they were everywhere for T-1's though).  I am wary of rebuilt parts,
*especially* heads!!  I have heard too many horror stories of people
buying rebuilt parts that are not rebuilt correctly.  I bought a *new*
camshaft and lifters, and new pistons and liners.  I took in my old crank
and had it reground.  I bought a complete engine gasket and bearing kit.
I took my old heads in and had them completely reworked (i.e. new seats,
guides, valves, seals, etc.).  A good idea is to replace the stock type
exhaust valves with the sodium-filled valves that were used in the 914.
A set of 4 will cost you $100 but they run much cooler than solid valves
and we all know what a problem exhaust valves are in the air-cooled VW's.
I was motivated to do this after my #3 exhaust valve broke off, prompting
my first rebuild.  

Check out &quot;How to Rebuild your Air-cooled VW&quot;, the red HP book.  I used 
it as my &quot;bible&quot; while rebuilding.   &quot;How to Hot-rod your VW&quot;, also
an HP book (yellow) has a lot of good, general information on cooling
and proper tuning of the VW motor.  Don't let the title fool you, this is
a good book :)

I would also recommend replacing the stock oil pump with a Melling high-
volume one.  My oil pressure went up noticeably after the swap, and it
was less than $50, if I remember correctly.

If you still have money left, consider getting a counterweighted crank.
If you spend a lot of time in the higher RPM ranges it helps prolong
the life of your bearings.

Have fun!
