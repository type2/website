&gt;:  Of course, you need to be good with the

&gt;
&gt;Use the clear vinyl available at ``lumber yard department stores'';
&gt;places like Home Depot.  It's not optically clear, but it's good
&gt;enough that you can tell when something's coming up behind you.
&gt;Admittedly, backing up is still best done with side mirrors.
&gt;It's kind of expensive if you buy an entire roll and have no other use

a cheaper possible alternative is a clear shower curtain (or shower-liner,
whatever they call them in your area) ... and it already has hook-holes in
one edge.

and, if you are REALLY into &quot;decorating&quot; your bus, think of all the weird
designs you can get on these curtains. :)
