&gt; &gt;  wrt the silver socket secret, there are few things of which we are sure:
&gt; &gt; they seem to appear only on aircooled westys built in 1980, 1981, 1982.
&gt; &gt; This in itself is baffling....Dc --

&gt;  
&gt;  My '74 Westfalia has a 12V silver socket beneath the glove box. The owners
&gt;  manual shows it in use, running the compressor that was included to fill the
&gt;  collapsible spare tire with which the vehicle was originally delivered.

whoa! we seem to have stumbled on an answer to the silver socket secret.
how many people's westys came with said socket, a collapsible tire and a
compressor? mine did not but then it was used....
