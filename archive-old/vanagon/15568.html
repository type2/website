Subject: GNATT update
Date: Fri, 14 Apr 1995 17:13:07 -0700 (PDT)

Friends,
	Following this message is the latest plan I have as to the route
the GNATT tour (Western leg) will take.  I am posting it to the list in
hopes of getting a few more people interested in attending.  The list of
participants is shrinking at this point, and I am starting to worry that
I may be doing portions of this trip alone.  I hope it doesn't come to
that!  Future updates to do with GNATT will only be sent to participants
to avoid cluttering the list.

	A reminder - if you are interested in participating in *any part*
of this trip and have not done so already, please notify me (schwarze_at_nosc_dot_mil)
or Martha (nrubin_at_s1.csuhayward_dot_edu) immediately.  The trip WILL happen,
cause I already have the month off work.  =)

	Of course, comments, criticisms, and suggestions are welcome, and
will be incorporated into the plan if possible.

-David

Fri, Sat, Sun. May 26-28
	Busses By The Arch, St. Louis, MO

Monday, May 29th
	Head northwest on Route 61 to the Iowa border, then North on 394 to
	218, hang a right at Washington (92), pick up 61 North again.
	Cross into Illinois at the small island town of Sabula, go North on
	84 to Galena, a well-preserved river town.  Footbridge across the
	Galena river leads to Ulysses S. Grant's home.  Riverboat museum
	in Dubuque.  That's probably enough for one day.

Tuesday, May 30th
	Continue North on 52 with a stop at Guttenberg (gotta keep the list
	administrator happy!).  On the way is Balltown, where there is a
	tavern called Breitbach's, where there is a horse blanket left by
	the James gang, supposedly.  Pikes Peak State park is supposed to
	be worth a look. Continue West on 52 to the 16, to 90.  90
	West until we feel like stopping for the night.  Option - Go up 35
	in Wisconsin all the way to the 90.  Supposed to be a beautiful
	Birch and Oak lined 2-lane road along sheer bluffs.

Wednesday, May 31st
	Drive West on 90 to Badlands Nat'l Park.  Stay the night.

Thursday, June 01
	Spend the morning looking around Badlands, short drive over to Custer
	State Park ,Black Hills Nat'l Forest, and Mt. Rushmore.  Spend rest
	of the day sightseeing.

Friday, June 02
	Look around for the day. 

Saturday, June 03
	Get up early and drive to Yellowstone NP.

Sunday, June 04
	Spend the day in Yellowstone

Monday, June 05
	Get up early and drive North on 89, to 90, to 93 North into Waterton
	Glacier park.

Tuesday, June 06 Sightseeing in Glacier - perhaps a day hike into the high
	wilderness?

Wednesday, June 07
	Up route 2 into Alberta, Canada.  Drive to Calgary and then West on
	Route 1.  Camp somewhere near Revelstoke.

Thursday, June 08
	Meander slowly West on Route 1 towards Vancouver.  Camp off Route 1
	again.

Friday, June 09
	Drive through to Patricia Bay (Alistair's place!).  Take the ferry 
	to Victoria?  Stay the night in Alistair's orchard (Thanks Al!!).

Saturday, June 10
	Take the ferry from Whidbey Island to Port Townsend.

	Head back up route 3 to 104 West to 101 West.  Stop at Sequim
	to see the Dungeoness National Wildlife Refuge.
	Camping options include KOA at Port Angeles - $22/night - hot tub!
	Also tons of cheap/free campgrounds in the local mountains.

Sunday, June 11
	Stay in the Olympic penninsula area.  Lots to see here, including
	the Hoh rain forest, Solduc hot springs, Hurricane penninsula.
	Drive out to La Push, where there are supposed to be great beaches
	and a rain forest.

Monday, June 12
	Down 101 into Oregon.  Stay at one of the State parks on the coast,
	such as Honeyman or Sand Dunes.  Supposedly there is a &quot;Dunes hike
	every Monday at 10AM in the Oregon Dunes Nat'l Rec Area.  I don't
	anticipate a problem finding a place to stay - I called the Oregon
	Parks and Rec. dept. *and* Honeyman state park and they both said
	I wouldn't need a reservation, and to save my $6 (costs extra to 
	reserve).  Fees for Honeyman are $18/night with hookups, $16 without.
	They said they are right next to some huge sand dunes.

Tuesday, June 13
	Cut inward on route 138 to Crater Lake.  Stay at a State Park nearby.

Wednesday, June 14
	Drive down 199 to 101 South, stop at one of the Redwood parks to
	camp for the evening.

Thursday, June 15
	299 East to Redding, 44 East to Lassen Volcanic park.  Stay the
	night in Lassen.

Friday, June 16
	36 E to 395 South, through Reno to 120 West (Tioga Road).  Camp
	near Mono Lake.

Saturday, June 17th
	Hike up to the Tioga Mine in Eastern Yosemite.  Drive into the high
	country, stay at one of the campgrounds there (Tamarack, Yosemite
	Creek, White Wolf, etc.  No reservations needed for the high country.


One comment, we really need to get to Yosemite a day earlier.  Arriving on
a Saturday is not a good thing.  I don't really want to cut any part of the
trip out, but there is not really any time unless something is cut out.
Right now, I am thinking about getting rid of the stop at Crater Lake in
Oregon, even though it is beautiful, cause it is really kind of out of the
way.  Comments?
