&gt;The modification appears to involve a new one way valve and drilling out
&gt;the pump and valve.  It also suggests a new &quot;O&quot; ring (available from
&gt;hardware store).  Has anyone any knowledge about this mod.  Should I do it
&gt;while it is out?  Is it to correct difficult lighting?  What is it to
&gt;correct?

Make sure that check valave still functions.  if it does not, hot gases from
the flame will travel into the pump melting it.  It can be tested by
blowing/sucking into it.  The ball should seat firmly.
