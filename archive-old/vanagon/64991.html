&gt;That big space under the driver's seat is calling to me to fit another
&gt;battery.
&gt;I want to put in a second battery, but I am not sure how to go about it.
&gt;I want the battery to drive the fridge and lights and I want the engine to
&gt;charge it (Naturally).
&gt;But, I don't want it to crank the starter - I don't want to put in the
&gt;heavy duty cables.
&gt;
&gt;My Bently manual (Section 97.9a) shows what seems to be a simple wiring
&gt;job, but there is no detail.
&gt;It look like all I have to do is to hook up the new battery to the battery
&gt;cut-out relay.
&gt;
&gt;I can't find the cut-out relay.
&gt;
&gt;Has anyone out there done this? How do I do it? Where is the relay?

Tony,
