I dug up the article on the 911 powered syncro crewcab vanagon from
Projektzwo and scanned in 3 photos to be seen at
http://wuecon.wustl_dot_edu/~samid/bus-stuff/projektzwo/

The article is photocopied and I don't know the publisher. So I'll leave
the pix there for a few days only.

Btw., the price for this double-cab is $170,000 DM (not 100,000 as I had
previously stated). That's about $100,000.
