Subject: 86' N. Amer. Van for use in Europe

I'm looking at buying an 86' Westfalia camper.
Am new to VW's (and new to this list) but think its in very 
good shape. 69K miles, no rust, sounds fine.

One question is that it was originally purchased as a &quot;North 
American Van for use in Europe&quot;.  Was converted from leaded to 
unleaded gas upon import.  (Catylitic Converter &amp; O2 Sensor 
added)

Any problems I should be aware of?
Anything to ask the previous owner?
Any other chronic problems with this model? 

Thanks
