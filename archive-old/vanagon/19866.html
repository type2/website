Subject: Re: 79 Bus--re unplugging drains and fixing turn signal

I too could use some advice on unclogging SR drains in my '81.  I'm tired 
of the Bus &quot;peeing&quot; on me on that first downhill stop after a good rain. :(

&gt; I've got a 79 bus with a metal sliding roof that I just rebuilt so that it is
&gt; now functional.  I, however, have been trying in vain to clear out the four
&gt; drain pipes.  I've tried flexible cable (video coaxial), air pressure, coat
&gt; hangers, to no avail.  
&gt; 
&gt; Any advice or tips on how to clean out these pipes would be appreciated.
&gt; 
&gt; Also, just this evening, my turn signal started acting up.  It blinks a few
&gt; times, then stops.  The little green indicator on the dash stays lit, but the
&gt; lights outside do nothing (not lit).  
&gt; 
&gt; How should I troubleshoot this problem....better yet, does anyone know what
&gt; the problem is?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks.
