Subject: 70's camper engine questions from a potential newbie
Date: Tue, 26 Mar 1996 01:02:18 GMT

Hello
 
I'm thinking of taking advantage of a recent demise of my non vw auto
to fulfill a long dream of getting a vw westfalia camper (70's) model.
i want something I can work on myself (and learn how to in the
process) and not too expensive (read: cheap).  the questions are:
1.  can an earlier stand-up engine be fit into a later pancake
equipped bus.  i understand from digging around the net and the list
archives that they are much cheaper
2. can the rear welded apron be modified to a bolt on like the '71 and
prior to expedite maintenance when the engine needs to be pulled
3. i'm told mexico and south runs on old vw's..  i would love to spend
much time there in mine on a student budget.. i am thinking there
would be no problem getting parts/repair for the standup engine .. is
there much use of the pancake engine there though...
4. any general thoughts on the pancake vs. stand up engines..  costs
vs. power or reliability.. whatever.. i'm easy to interest.
5. any one got one for sale cheap in northern colorado..  (to be soon
driven to ny so it has to run at the get go)
6. thanks for everything in advance..  i await my education. :-)

thanks 
Mike

p.s.  did any of the model yrs have front seat that could swivel
toward the rear?  when?  could they be retrofit? or did all yr.
campers have the &quot;wall&quot; behind the front seats?
