Subject: Philly Area VW Stuff?


We're going to do a short road trip with the EV this weekend and
take the kids to Philly, Great Adventure, Sesame Place, etc...
In order to keep my &quot;sanity&quot; (which we ALL know is minimal to
begin with) I was wondering if anyone knew of any neat VW-oriented
place to buy VW &quot;toys&quot;...or a place that had some decent plastic
or die cast VW models in the Philly area.


Thanks...

Ric
