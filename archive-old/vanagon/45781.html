Subject: SYNCRO - 4W drive problems you know

Hi,
I just found your &quot;You Beaut&quot; list. I've bought a 88 SYNCRO with a TRAKKA
Camper conversion to go round OZ for 6 months.
I'll be going into some rough country up North. Since I'm a new hand with
the SYNCRO, I wonder if there are any problem 4W driving. I've got other 4W
drive experience and the usual gear. Any other potential problems you can
forsee?

Any info would be appreciated.
Cheerio
