&gt;Does anyone out there know where the brown/blue wire from the ignition
&gt;switch plugs up?  Can someone go out and have a look?  It does not show up
&gt;in my Bentley at all, the first time this BOOK(tm) has left me high and
&gt;dry.
&gt;

I replaced my switch with a unit from RMMW this past week. Here is the wiring 
configuration I used.

WIRE		FROM/TO				DESCRIPTION	
Red/Black		switch to starter			12V when in &quot;START&quot; position	
Black		switch to fuse box and ignition coil	12V when in &quot;ON&quot; and &quot;START&quot; 
position	
Black/Yellow		switch to light switch			12V only in &quot;ON&quot; (not &quot;ON&quot; &amp; &quot;START&quot;)?	
Red		battery to switch			12V at all times (straight from battery)	
Brown/Blue(1)		door buzzer				connected to GND when key is in ignition	
Blue/gray		not used		

(1)This wire is shown as Brown in book.
