Subject: 71 no start

I just rebuilt my 71 1600dp and installed it into my bus and it will not
start.  in checking when the rotor is at the #1 position the plug for #1
sparks, the piston is at TDC and the valve clearance is at specs.  The firing
order is correct. The thing will not even make a noise.  It just turns over
and over.  nice and smooth but no fire.  I did just for kicks twist the
distributer half way around and got a puf of smoke.  I installed the
distributer gear correct with the # piston at TDC  Sometimes I think no gas
but the filter is full.  I get no real smell of gas from the plug.  should i
throw sone gas directly down the carb or just all over the bus and burn it to
the ground.


PLEASE HELP I AM AT NEAR BREAKDOWN
TIM
71' BUS
