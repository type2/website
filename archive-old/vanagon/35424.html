Subject: RE: '68 pickup,clutch,what happened?


&gt;Wednesday I was backing out of the garage and when I put the clutch pedal
&gt;in, it went in and the clutch did not disengage.  The clutch pedal stayed
&gt;down and I was late for work, so I pushed it back in the garage and 
expected
&gt;that I broke the cable.
&gt;
&gt;Last night I got underneath to change the cable, and it is not broken.  The 

&gt;pedal actuates the cross shaft, but nothing else is happening.  I will drop 

&gt;the engine tomorrow to take a look.  What can I expect?  Pressure plate
&gt;replacement?


Maybe. Other possibilities: Your throwout bearing fell off the cross shaft
arms (those little spring clips have given me problems before). Or, the
cross shaft's arms have broken, due to the clutch getting worn and the
cable being tightened byt the PO more and more, until no more travel was
left in the cross shaft and the throwout bearing was jammed against the
pressure plate (happened to me on a newly-purchased '64 convertible).

Also, once I put in a diphragm-style clutch for a '74 bug, into my '69
bus which had a '69 tranny and a '74 bug engine. Big mistake-- there is a
circular ridge on the clutch housing, which sawed through both the little
spring clips holding the throwout bearing, as neatly as you please.
