  Question:  DId or do Campers come in only 1 color each year?

no

i dont know for all years, but in 64-67 you could get them in velvet green,
also white, I've seen a dove blue 64.    

My 65 camper was originally velvet green below, white on top.  (now it is
pinto metallic blue and primer brown - blech)   I have seen a couple othe
stock two tone westys.,  they were european market buses, as is my 65.
