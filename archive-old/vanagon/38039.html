&gt; Champaigne Edition bus that was in someone's backyard.  Also saw a 
&gt; pair on a '73 bus once.  Don't know what years they were available 
&gt; on, or whether they're genuine VW or aftermarket. You can still get 
&gt; replicas from Bus Boys, although they are somewhat expensive as I 
&gt; recall.
&gt; To second your opinion, I found them to be a great use of otherwise 
&gt; wasted space, and besides they kept the top of my dash clear of 
&gt; junk.

&gt; '76 Westy (for sale, if anyone's interested)
&gt; '77 Westy
&gt; '85 Westy
&gt; etc. etc. etc.    
&gt; 
&gt; 
How do these package shelves attach on the late breadloaves?  WCM has
them but they are $$$$$$.
