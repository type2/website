Subject: Journeys under difficult conditions


Last Friday I received the Technical Recommendation from VAG
as an August 1984 Edition.

Contends:

I BEFORE THE JOURNEY

General
Basic equipment - for all areas
Additional equipment (for journeys in countries in Group 2,
  particulary difficult conditions)
Additional equipment (for journeys in countries in Group 3,
  desert areas)

II DURING THE JOURNEY

Driving over difficult terrain
Driving when using low quality fuel
Driving when using low quality engine oil
Standard Service, maintenance

III SPARE PARTS

IV INSTALLATION OF REINFORCEMENT PARTS, PROTECTION PLATES
  AND STONE GUARD EQUIPMENT

V INSTALLING CYCLONE AIR FILTERS AND REROUTING INTAKE PIPES

VI DRAWINGS FOR THE MANUFACTURE OF REINFORCEMENT PARTS,
  PROTECTION PLATES AND STONE GUARD EQUIPMENT


This book covers following vehicles:
 - Beetle
 - VW 181 (Thing)
 - Volkswagen Transporter with 1.6L engine up to June 1979
 - Volkswagen Transporter with 1.6L engine from July 1979
 - Volkswagen Transporter with 2.0L engine
 - Volkswagen Transporter with water-cooled engines
 - Volkswagen LT

A lot of photos and small drawing and 17 technical sketches
allows to make up most parts by yourself. Others are
defined by VAG part numbers.

I got the last available copy and I like to share it with
the community. The best will be scanning the pictures and
retyping the text to offer this on a web server. But the
copyright on this document has to be cleared at first.
