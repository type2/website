&gt;I've asked for these before, and i still need them!  Many of you have
&gt;suggested ways to build them and i will try that as time permits...
&gt;however, being essentially a person that seeks the easy way out i'm
&gt;still hoping to find someone who's dog has shredded their tent but
&gt;has the poles lying around.  i specifically need the 4 angled braces
&gt;that form the top corners of the perimeter supporting the tent.  i
&gt;have the big tent with a floor, orange (mango??) canvas, and a
&gt;blue/white striped entrance.

a thought that comes to mind: those aluminum handles for roller painting.
the extending kind for painting the ceiling. you can adjust the length and
they are pretty strong and lightweight.

just a thought.
