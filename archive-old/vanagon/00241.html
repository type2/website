This is probably my biggest complaint. However, I understand the design 
reasons, and I feel that it's a tradeoff.  I always get in the sliding 
door anyway because I have two kids.  Now that I think about it, I might 
anyway because it's easier.  It's funny, but my wife has NEVER complained 
about it.  In fact, when I mentioned it, she defended it.

When I went looking for vans, I was looking for vans.  The minivan is not 
a full sized van, and would never replace the Vanagon.  A &quot;Eurovan&quot; is 
not a full sized van either, and is no replacement for the Vanagon.  
Basically, VW doesn't make a real van anymore.  The competition for 
Vanagons is full sized American vans (here).  My sister is always 
complaining because she loads her minivan full of kids and goes to the 
grocery store and doesn't have any room for the groceries.  That'll never 
happen with the Vanagon.

&gt; * the front seats are directly over the front wheels. this gives a strange
&gt;   feeling to one's butt when one slams on the brakes. :)  you don't get this
&gt;   in a 'regular' car or chrysler minivan.

I think this is a really **Cool** feeling -- like fun!

&gt; * it doesn't fit into most american garages very well. or automatic car
&gt;   washes at the gas station.

Fits better than my Chevy Van did. And the turning radius is MUCH better. 
(note the 1920's style garage with the nose added later for the long 
cars -- anyone else have these?  They're pretty abundant here.)

&gt; and that's the way the Eurovan strikes me: no 'personality'. and the wheel-
&gt; well makes my left leg uncomfortable.  and i kept hitting my head getting
&gt; into the driver's seat.

I had the foot problems with the Chevy.  I'm SO glad to not have that now.
