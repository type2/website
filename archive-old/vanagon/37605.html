Subject: Why I bought a Westfalia (was: Tires)



	Thanks to everyone who shared their knowledge with me about the 
BFG All-Terrain tires:)  I wish that I could get such good info on every 
other desicion I had to make!  
	The background is as follows...for the last 2 years I have 
managed to save enough money to take the summers completely off (sublet 
apartment, postpone job, etc), and just sort of wander(read drive) around 
the US and Mexico in my Pathfinder.  Well, this summer (yeah I managed to 
pull it off again:), I decided that I wasn't even going to attempt to 
live in the Pathfinder for another 3 months, so I started looking around 
for more suitable contraptions.  First I was going to tow a camper around 
with me, but then I saw the light, er, Westfalia.  These campers where so 
cool. I couldn't believe that I hadn't considered one of these before.  
Then, after a little more research, I discovered the Syncro...I was sure 
that I had discovered the perfect automobile. AWD, high ground clearance, 
house, etc...Book Value around $8000 for an 86.  $8000 was a little much 
for me, but if I could find a really good deal I might be able to pull it 
off.  Yeah right!!  Today in the Denver post there are 4 '87 Syncro 
Campers for sale. Prices are: $20,000/best, $18,000/best, $16,000, and a 
Cheap(?) one for $13,000. Book Value for an '87=$9,500. If you ever have 
a Syncro Camper you would like to sell, sell it in Denver.
	Anyway I got a good deal on the 86 Westy that I got.  $4,800, 
129K, white, no rust, mechanics thumbs up. I could likely sell this car 
tomarrow, given my location, and time of year, for $8,000.  But that 
wouldn't buy me a Syncro, so what's the difference.  Someday, man, I'm 
tellin' ya...I'll have a syncro.  But in the mean time I'm going to slap 
som BFG All-Terrain's on the &quot;average&quot; Westy, and take it as far away 
from cement as I can.
