Subject: Re: Lost all mail since 2pm tues

&gt;Hi, _at_#$%*&amp;?!  compuserve was upgrading (finally) to their new e-mail system
&gt;yesterday, and I was unable to get/send any e-mail since 2pm on tues

Gee, Chris, never look a gift horse in the mouth. Some people would pay to get
off this list.  ;-)
