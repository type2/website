Volks,

While my exotoextraengine is apart to clear it's sinusis and replace the
flattened cam, I proceeded to re-install 'The Old War Horse' in order to
actually drive the car around and perhaps pass smog.  

The Old War Horse is an AS41 case that was originally from a 1970 squareback
that got it's galleries opened up, was line-bored and has a Berg 69mm CW
crank, it is a 1776cc.  The list of things I've gored this thing with is
truly sick, allow me to elaborate;

When I first put it in the builder forgot the gallery plug at the front of
the case behind the flywheel and I had to pull it right after I started it,
the shape of things to come.

It was originally rebuilt at about 8:1 CR and could hit 280 in under ten
minutes.

It had the silver fuel reg-stricter on it and was running lean the whole
time it was used, another reason it could heat up like a griddle.

I put the type three fan house in the '63 bus in an effort to get more
cooling, it didn't help, though I doubt it hurt, and when hammering up to
Oregon I melted the heat exchangers.  I think oil temps were around 280+,
but exhuast temps had to have been 1400F+.

The ported and polished heads cracked in under 10,000 miles from the abuse.

It had incredible torque due to a dual lift cam that was advanced on the
gear, as well as the high CR, etc.  It could climb serious hills in third or
fourth in the squareback.  The valve clatter was so bad I thought the engine
was falling apart and tore it down in under 10,000 miles.  Also, I was using
the stock 1970 fuel injection on it and it idled goofy. I put resistors on
the air and head sensors and it smoothed out and did, incredibly, pass smog
with flying colors.  The smog tech said he'd never seen one run so clean.  I
put in a stock cam, with high lift rockers after that.  There wasn't
anything wrong with the cam, but the gear was wearing alot due the fact that
the builder used a '0' gear and it was too tight a fit to the crank gear,
his dressing the gears down didn't help.

Later on I put some fancy dual spring big valve heads on it and dropped the
compression.  It ran OK for quite while till it broke a valve coming back
from Oregon at over 70 mph.

In it's next incarnation I forgot to tighten the gland nut (I thought I was
going into the lower end when the valve broke but decided not to) on and
banged out the dowel holes.  Let it sit for year or two, then drilled them
out to 3/8&quot; and fit oversized ones in. 

It ran great for about 750 miles then started to burn oil badly, turns out I
forgot one of the wrist pin keepers and it gouged a big slot in one of the
liners. 


So here it is about ten years later and I've decided to revive it _once_
again.  I got a new set of P/C's and used the old liners from the
exotoengine, honed for a fresh finish.  I'll use the new liners on the
exotoengine later.   I put new rod bearings in since one of them was worn
from the wrist pin dragging on the liner wall in it's last life.  I used all
the old junk parts I had lying around and figure this is it's last life,
after this, it's trash.  It has an old fan house and old narrow fan.  I had
quite a time getting the alternator to fit because it had generator tin and
I had to find real alternator tin and a new hub to get it to clear and sit
straight on the stand.  Those pieces are not interchangeable.  I set the CR
at 6.8:1 and torqued the 10 mm headstuds to 23 ft lbs.  In my last
conversation with Berg they said the head studs should NOT be locktighted at
the nut!  And, of course, both Berg and How to Hot Rod yer VW say 18 ft.
lbs. only.  Too bad, I'm doing this one with locktight at 23 anyway.  The
stock intake was installed with an old header that fits the .2&quot; wider
engine.  I was very careful about fitting the fuel pump pushrod to the pump,
but didn't actually measure the pressure because I figured I had it right.

Start-up was a bit rough, getting oil pressure took alot of time, propably
scuffed the bearings, even though I had the spark plugs out and rockers off,
oops.  When I tried driving it, it ran hot , so I fiddled with the timing
alot, starting out at the stock 5 ATDC and working foward to 10 BTDC when I
thought I was getting better performance.  At this point I took it for a
drive to work about thirty miles away (Concord).  This sucker ran like messy
smelly excrement, I barely made it, oil temps hit 250 on small hills and it
bucked badly.  It also knocked when it was hot.
Backing off the timing didn't help the performance significantly.
 
Hopefully I didn't crack the heads in those sixty miles.  In any case I
figured that it was running lean so I installed the old platinum plugs from
the exotoengine and an electric fuel pump rated at about 12 psi.  Low and
behold it turned right around and is running rather well.  The idle is still
a bit goofy, but pushing the accelerator pump to the max stopped the intake
snapping.  I have to put a fitting in the exhaust if I want to use my O2
sensor so that may take some time.  I'm sure this size engine is running
lean in the higher rpm's.  Until then I'll stick with the stock jets, even
though I've heard you can't get replacements for the 34PICT-2 anyway.  I'm
off to the smog tech soon and will likely run it for several months in this
state if it continues to feel good.  

The exotoengine remains in pieces, though new parts have started arriving.

I remain anxious to get to the point where I can drive the car up mountain
passes in 100 degree heat without overheating.  I wonder if it is really
possible, especially after reading Tobins account of the Mexican passes with
his type 4.  I've just returned from a backpacking trip in the Trinity Alps
and we took four people up route 3 to Callahan over Scott Mtn summit (elev.
5401)  Sweeties '85 Golf got hotter than I've ever seen it, and it had a new
radiator.  Conditions like that are seriously hard on any engine and I hope
I can build one that can really do it.

wOw
