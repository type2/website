Subject:      additional fuel tanks ...

well, i'm nosing around the January 96 issue of 4-wheel drive &amp; sport
utility magazine, and i see this ad for additional fuel tanks. now it
didn't say that they had vw buses, but it did say they &quot;have over 234 tank
listings for different vehicles.&quot; hmmmmm.

so i called and asked for info. he said he'd send me a brochure. he also
said they had made up some &quot;saddle&quot; tanks for a vanagon (remember the one
Brad saw??), one on each side of the &quot;frame&quot;. one filled via the &quot;normal&quot;
filler and the other one filled via a wheelwell filler.

so anyway, he claims to have made bigger tanks for the older buses, and
if you send him the measurements, he'll work out a tank for you.

so if anyone is located around and wants to go check him out, or call and
talk to them ...
