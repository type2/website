Subject: RE: Copies of '68-'72 Westy parts manual

Hello all,

	I just picked up on this thread, and Joe, if you could make one 
more copy of your parts manual for a '71 Westy owner I would much 
appreciate it.  I've felt guilty ever since I put the rear facing seat from 
a '70 in my '71 (I sort of like that tissue box style storage over the more 
practical one).  This summer I'll be working to dess it up properly.

	Let's see, I can offer copies of my '71 Bus owner's manual (not too 
exciting) and I have a copy of the manual (I think it's all there) for a 
Eberspacher BN4 heater.  Fill me in on your expenses 
(copying/shipping/aggravation factored in).

	Thanks,

	Ron Van Ness
