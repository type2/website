Subject: VW Oil Filters for $5.45

In case anyone is interested ...

Russel Motor Cars is offering genuine VW oil filters for $5.75 each for orders 
of 1-4 filters and $5.45 for orders of 5 filters or more.  Air filters are 
$9.95.

I have ordered parts from them before, but not VW oil filters.  They are 
probably just above average for a mail order parts place (7.5 out of 10).  
Handled returns OK.
