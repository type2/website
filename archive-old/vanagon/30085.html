&gt;Any opinions on the definitive ski/kayak/bicycle rack setup on a Westfalia
&gt;('87 to be specific)? I've done a bit of research and come to the following
&gt;conclusions:
&gt;
&gt;For bicycles, a three-bike carrier on the trailer hitch (ball-style) seems
&gt;optimal. There are several manufacturers of such racks, Bauer is one. With
&gt;a 2&quot; receiver hitch, you can carry four bicycles. These racks generally
&gt;will fold out of the way to allow access to the rear hatch. If you don't
&gt;have a trailer hitch, it might be worthwhile to install one if you carry
&gt;bicycles very much. I don't really like those racks that rest against the
&gt;rear hatch and hang from 1&quot; webbing.
&gt;
&gt;Skis are problematic. The above-mentioned bicycle racks have attachments
&gt;for skis to allow them to be carried standing vertically. However, on
&gt;Vanagons there is not enough clearance between the bottom of the skis and
&gt;the ground. I guess you could fabricate some sort of extension to give the
&gt;rack more clearance. Thule and Yakima make attachments to allow their
&gt;gutter racks to be used on Westfalias. These attachments must be bolted to
&gt;the fiberglass poptop and you can't carry much more than skis. I would be
&gt;hesitant to put kayaks on this setup. The roof rack isn't optimal in my
&gt;opinion because it's too high to access without standing on something.
&gt;Someone must make some nifty ski racks just for Westfalias...
&gt;
&gt;For kayaks, the only solution I see is Thule gutter racks with the long
&gt;feet. These will attach to the gutters on the Vanagon and rise above the
&gt;poptop. The main drawback is that you have to remove the racks to raise the
&gt;top. Not a big problem really when you consider that you will most likely
&gt;be driving to a destination and then removing the kayaks for a while. I
&gt;carried two triple sea kayaks with this setup on my '74 this past summer.
&gt;Cruised to Lund, BC from Seattle with no problems at all--the racks were
&gt;rock solid. I wouldnt want to use this setup for skis because the racks
&gt;interfere with raising the poptop.
&gt;
&gt;Any other opinions out there?

Why do you recommend the Thule gutter racks attached to the Vanagon gutters
and not the bolt-on fake gutters?  When I bought my Westy, it already had
these fake gutters attached.  I bought a Thule rack and am fairly satified.
You're right that it's difficult to put things on or take them off without
standing on something, but I have carried surfboards on the rack and you can
still pop the top without taking them off (kayaks also although I don't own
a kayak).  I also bought a ski attachment and can easily put skis or
snowboards on the rack without standing on anything.

I'm pretty sure I will never be able to manage putting bikes on this rack
but since I have a 78 with the spare tire mounted in the front I can put a
bike rack on that (same as the hitch one you mentioned but a little
sturdier).  The only thing that worries me about this is that if I have 2 or
3 bikes they might block out my headlights too much for night driving.
