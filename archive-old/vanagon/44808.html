Steve,

Thanks for clearing up the pulley-notch anomaly, and for all the other
tips which are very useful to know (I didn't know about the not-turning-
the-engine-backwards thing).

&gt;Aye Yie Yie... sounds like my old college days, when I used to scrounge
&gt;for change to put gas in my Type-3. Yes, if your points are old and have
&gt;a big stalactite on them, then the contact can vary somewhat, and the
&gt;apparent point gap (and timing) can vary with each spark. Filing them back
&gt;down can cure that for a while, but your points are on borrowed time.
&gt;I'd get some new ones soon if possible.

I was under the impression that this 'stalactite' formed quickly after a few
sparks anyway, even on new points ?? What counts as a 'big' stalactite in 
this case (i.e. when do points need renewing)?

&gt;Gotta ask-- what is a Dormobile? An English/European version of a Kombi?
&gt;Inquiring minds want to know.

It is/was the camping conversion by Martin Walter of Folkestone, England.
The Dormobile roof was also put onto some Devon campers. It's the one which
elevates up hinged along one side of the van, with stripey red canvas and
glass windows in it. The complete Dormobile conversion is rare -- apparently
only 4 splitty ones in the U.K. I've never seen another one. Unfortunately mine 
has had some 'home improvements' made to it in the past &amp; is incomplete. 
I'm hoping to add a Dormobile page to my website some time soon. If there 
are any other Dormobile owners out there (not just splitties), get in touch.
