Subject: Progress on Rumba's Rebuild

hey now,

welll...some good news and bad news on the rebuild. good news...engine is out,
heads off, cylinders off...heads don't look as bad as i expected. definite
valve seat drop though. gonna send the heads off to California to be worked
on...gonna start ordering parts soon so my friend sean can do the rebuild.
while i learn! :-) cylinders gonna be replaced, some slight wear.

ordering gauges...oil pressure, oil temp, and voltometer. also gonna order
the center console and a battery tray from bus boys...doing both a top and
bottom rebuild, hopefully the rods and everything is okay.

bad news...looking at the case today Sean noticed some major gunk in a
particular pattern. scraped that off...saw where someone had welded a crack
in the case...about 4 inches long...looks like a rod had been thrown or heat
damage...so, i'm gonna have to get another case. another $250....oh well.
if you are gonna do it, best to do it right. no use in rebuilding the engine
just to use an old, semi repaired case. i think this is where my mystery oil
leak that's been bugging me for about year came from.

other then the above, the engine looks clean. will update as progess moves on!
