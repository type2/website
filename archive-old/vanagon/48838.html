Subject: Re: Help: Oil Pressure Light ('89 Vangagon)

&gt; A 'heavier' than stock OP switch will inform the driver sooner than the stock 
&gt; switch, thus the driver knows sooner and will react sooner. Of course, if you
&gt; choose a switch that switches above the idle OP, the light will light up when 
&gt; your engine idles, so the new switch can not be much heavier than stock unless
&gt; you add it to your stock system, include an extra light actuated by the 
&gt; heavier sender and leave the stock sender and light in place, now you have a 
&gt; two stage OP warning system.
&gt; 
This is exactly what VW installed on the w/c Jetta engines - my '85 
has a sender at the oil filter housing which switches at ~28psi at 
and sends a warning if the OP drops below this, but *only* when the 
engine speed is over 2000 rpm. A second switch on the head is a much 
lower ~8psi or so which lights the OP light at any speed. The 
highpressure 'dynamic' switch also controls a loud buzzer which gets 
your attention *real* fast. 
I removed the low pressure switch and replaced it with a manual OP 
gauge since and left the dynamic system active.
