Subject: Re: Interesting Discovery about my '54

Hi, Thom--
Yes, indeed, your wind-up clock was standard in the Deluxe. There were at 
least two kinds (maybe two manufacturers?). Your style, where it seems 
almost the whole behind-part of the clock rotates, first appeared in '54 
(I've seen a few other '54s, so I am extrapolating here). '53 and earlier 
came with a clock with a small winder, on a &quot;stalk,&quot; out to the right 
side of the back of it. Yours says 8-day 'cause it supposed to wind up 
enough for a 8-day run. I am hesitant to wind mine up to the max, though, 
because of it's age and fragility. I don't know when the electric clocks 
were introduced. I'd guess they appeared in '55, when they were rectangular.

Of course, the electric clocks are neat, themselves, in how they operate. 
They are not always drawing current, but only every minute or so when 
they &quot;zip wind.&quot; The ticking after the &quot;zip wind&quot; is the release of the 
spring under the next time the contact points touch for another zip wind. 
Listen, and you shall hear. . .

&gt; I was putzing around with my '54 bus tonight, and I started playing with the
&gt; clock.  I set the time to high noon, and noticed that there was a knurled
&gt; ring underneath the clock body, so I turned it - its a windup clock!
&gt; 
&gt; For some reason I assume it was electric.  Are all deluxe clocks
&gt; windup, or are the later ones electric?
&gt; 
&gt; Kind of a cool feature.  I'd been wondering what it mean by &quot;8-day&quot;
