Subject: REMINDER - Woodstock VW Gathering



The Woodstock VW Show is this weekend - Saturday and Sunday...

I know that there are a bunch of people from the list planning on 
going...I was one of them...the operative word here is WAS...
My wife's uncle has decided to donate a Sunfish to one of my
sons...and it has to be picked up Saturday... So much for Woodstock..

I'll try to be there on Sunday....if not see you all next time around.

Ric
