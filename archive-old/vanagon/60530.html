Subject: Voltage Stabilizer

Okay....so in response to my question two weeks ago about the gas and temp 
gauges quitting simultaneously it was suggested that I replace the voltage 
stabilizer (aka vibrator) behind the instrument pod.  $13 part, three minutes 
to change, worked like a charm....until Friday night.  Started the Ark up and 
got nothing from either gauge (no flashing of the temp warning light either.  

Now what?  Best I can guess, either the vibrator was defective, or something is 
spiking through the electrical and burned it out.  I do know that the 
directional relay is dying; I get different flash rates, and sometimes I can 
hear a buzzing behind the left side of the dash like the relay is sticking(?).  
Could this be putting enough strain on the vibrator to burn it out.....or do I 
need to take the Ark somewhere and have some serious checking done on the 
electrical system?
