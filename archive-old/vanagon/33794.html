Tim,

I just called the dealer.  He couldn't find the Y370G 8ply.  It could 
be an 'older model' or not on their list.  He mentioned some other 
load range D tires in the $90-100 range.  The 185/R14 6ply are expensive, 
but given that I don't haul too much weight around (non-camper) I think 
the 8ply would be overkill (they are also larger diameter?).

Thanks for the tip.  I volunteer to maintain tire info on my web page if 
folks will kindly send me information, experiences, approx. pricing, 
dealers, etc.  Please specify model and make of your van (I'm only 
familiar with Vanagon specs).
