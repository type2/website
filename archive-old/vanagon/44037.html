Subject: Help: Vanagon - stiffer springs available?

Hi,
Anyone know if stiffer springs are available for Vanagons.  My '89 seems a
bit saggy.  The refrigerator's (driver's) side is about 1.5&quot; lower than the
sliding door side.  I understand the weight difference, but it seems that
some stiffer springs might help.

Suggestions, comments, noise?
