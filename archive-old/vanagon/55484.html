Hello from the Independent Traveler!  There are only a couple more days l=
eft
of the current airfare war (it ends Feb. 4), and the airlines have been q=
uiet
for the past few days, and we suspect it's the quiet before the next stor=
m,
so keep your eyes on the Bargain Box, where we guarantee to post all the
details before anyone else but the airlines themselves (and sometimes we =
beat
even them)!

Recently, after looking through our mail, we've become aware that there i=
s
some confusion about the purpose and function of this newsletter.  The
newsletter is a service we provide to keep you informed about everything
that's happening at The Independent Traveler.  However, we don't have the
resources to reply to requests for specific fare quotes, and we don't boo=
k
fares or function as a travel agent.  Everything you see mentioned in thi=
s
newsletter is available in complete form in The Independent Traveler at
Keyword : Traveler, or IT.  Additionally, you can find our chat schedules=
,
airline 800 numbers, and all the great deals listed here, as well as much
more.  So, for instance, if you have a specific question about the bargai=
ns
listed here, go to the Bargain Box for the complete info.

IF YOU WISH TO BE TAKEN OFF THE LIST, PLEASE READ!  There is no charge fo=
r
this mailing, and you will receive mail only from the Independent Travele=
r,
not from other recipients of the list. =20
However, if you wish to be taken off the list, DO NOT HIT REPLY.  Simply =
send
the following message to LISTSERV_at_LISTSERV.AOL.COM
1. In the *TEXT* field, type the following exactly as shown:
     SIGNOFF TRAVELNEWS-L &lt;user-name_at_aol_dot_com&gt;
Do not include the brackets.
Example:  SIGNOFF TRAVELNEWS-L travelgal_at_aol_dot_com

User-name is the screen name at which you receive the newsletter -- if yo=
u
are not on AOL, use your actual email address.  It doesn't matter what yo=
u
put in the subject line.
That should do it, but we hope you like the newsletter enough to stay wit=
h
us!
