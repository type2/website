Subject: Jump Seats

I have wanted a Westy for a long time but I have 3 kids and it only has 4 
seats.  (Please no suggestions about getting rid of a kid!)  At a dealer I 
once saw jump seats in a Wolfsburg edition that mounted to the rear of the 
front passenger seat pedestal.  I was told that these could not be ordered 
from the factory, but occasionally were available when a Wolfburg Vanagon 
was modified for wheel chair use.

1.  Does anyone know how to get these jump seats?

2.  Has anyone ever seen one installed in a Westy?

3.  Does anyone else with a 5+ person family have an alternate solution?
