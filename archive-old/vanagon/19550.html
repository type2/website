Subject: Fresh air fan and A/C stuff

ad230_at_freenet_dot_carleton_dot_ca (Sean O'Neil)
&gt;My repsonse was to go out and buy a Bently manual. Has anyone had to
&gt;replace their [fresh air] fans? Before dismantling the dash and breaking 
&gt;the welds on the airbox I would like to eliminate other possible causes. 
&gt;Fuses have been checked.

My fresh air fan switch caught on fire once.  I'd check the switch/wiring
first before replacing the fan.  The vanagons tend to fuse electrical 
components closer to the ground side of the circuit than I'm used to.
For instance, on my '84, the fuse for the headlights is AFTER the switch
but before the lamps.  If you have a short before the fuse (near the 
switch) you get a fire until the circuit opens or your battery blows up.  
I'm used to Japanese wiring which puts fuses as close to the battery as 
possible.  Much safer.

&gt;good A/C look for one of those.  Oh, BTW I was always told that the
&gt;pre '85 [A/C] systems with the unit behind the front passengers heads was
&gt;even more pitiful than the '86-? but don't know for sure.

My '84 AC works great if you start in the shade - or - if you give
it five minutes, fine if you start from the blazing Texas sun.  However,
I have an after market compressor, replaced most of the hoses, and near
opaque tint on the windows (big bucks invested...).  Van color is the 
enviable beige/brown.

Friday's VW grin and bear it...
Wasserboxer heads never last long enough to need a valve job...   ;^)
