Subject: Re: Looking for a bus

&gt;I'm looking for a VW bus.  I will be travelling throughout the Yukon 
&lt;snip&gt;
&gt;need to be at all camperized, as I will be tenting most of the time 
&gt;anyways, I just need the enclosed space for my equipment if the wind 
&gt;or weather is really bad.  So, if you can help me out in any way, 
&gt;that would be really grand.



Hi, I am selling my van now, about to buy another one. It would seem ideal 
for your purposes. I am in Fredericton, NB, so you can check it out if 
interested.


1985 Transporter, 1.9 litre water cooled gasoline engine
4 speed transmission.
161,000 Km, primarily highway (Ont-&gt;NB trips)

colour white/black trim, no chrome as this is a 3/4 ton utility vehicle
this is a panel van, no windows in sides, except for
a louvered/fine-mesh one in sliding door
interior: panelled in white plastic surface board,
          properly insulated with 3 1/2&quot; fiberglass pink and vapour barrier
          fold down double bed, front hammock (for gear or small child)
          sink/pump/6 gal. H2O tank
          &quot;fridge&quot; using an electric Koolatron unit, OK but a bit weak
          swing out table, seats 4 for dinner
          storage bench and storage seat, plus under-bed storage
          clothes wardrobe
          (all of this can be removed in &lt;2hrs, leaving a HUGE cargo area)
          Not a pop-top (or it wouldn't be for sale!)
exterior: solid 'as new' condition, Rust-Checked, undersprayed etc annually
          surface (sun) blemish and slight seam rust.
          this van will last another 10 years without any problem
          all doors slide/open smoothly
          one long scrape along drivers side, cosmetic only
          no other dents, even the bumpers are straight.
driveability: water pump and front brakes replaced 2 years ago (&lt;6,000 km)
              good tires 6 ply rating, 20-22 mpg on highway
              cruises 120kph effortlessly, no shifting to 3rd. on hills 
unless                fully laden (and going too slowly to begin with). top 
speed 145kph 
              very smooth/stable vehicle, suspension and steering excellent
              very good ground clearance, about 9-10 inches

Needs nothing really, I normally park it all winter, but it is on the road now. 
Please feel free to phone me directly if you wish more info. It's been in 
the local paper and I have one person I consider serious looking at it. He's 
also going across Canada next spring.   tim s.
