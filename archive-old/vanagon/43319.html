Subject: Re: ? poptop storage

Hi Pat.  I wouldn't leave anything on the top bunk that would 
restrict airflow.  There's about an inch of air space with the top 
folded down so that some air can circulate.   A sleeping bag would 
restrict air circulation further.  I live in BC where it rains, so 
this is a concern here.

Hope this helps,
Harry.

&gt; Learned Volks-  Just before closing the poptop, I put my sleeping bag behind
&gt; the folded top bunk.  Although crushable, I couldn't distribute it evenly in
&gt; the space available.  The top latched shut with no problem, but despite it
&gt; being logical bag storage (so I &quot;don't leave home without one&quot;) am I taking a
&gt; chance of straining the hinges/top/mattress?
