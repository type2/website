&gt;negatives:
&gt; loud, underpowered. no A/C.  No hydraulic valve lifters --
&gt; needs valve adjustments pretty often.

valve adjustments pretty often? My Diesel has now 150,000 km
and I had no need for valve adjustments. I would not say any
wrong, but there should be hydraulic lifters.

&gt;a quick note:
&gt; gas mileage is not as great as it is said -- maybe a savings
&gt;        of 5 mpg.

I think it's a little bit more.

&gt;what to look for:
&gt; have someone drive it (hard), and follow behind.  Too much
&gt; diesel smoke may mean at the very least neglected valve
&gt; adjustments.

Black smoke on full acceleration means worn-out injection jets.
I still have the first jets in, pushing out the black smoke.

&gt; Look for signs of excessive blow-by: too much engine oil
&gt; dripping.
