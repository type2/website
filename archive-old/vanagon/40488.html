Subject: Brochures from Westfalia and Dometic Fridge question

I just received some new ctalogs from westfalia in Germany.  They include
a conversion done on a Ford called a &quot;Nugget&quot;, a Mercedes conversion called
the James Cook.  They also sent me a 150th anniversary brochure.  Needless
to say, we are being deprived of very, very excellent vehicles.  If any
body wants the address it is Westfalia-Werke KG
                             Postfach 26 40
                             33378 Rheda Wiedenbruck
                             Germany
Also, some one was having problems with their fridge.  i have always had problemn the vehicle is moving.  Someone said that this might be due to a leak?
The rubber on the outside fluvent also smells like it is burning after a couple
hours.  Any assistance would be great.
Thanks
