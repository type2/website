&gt;&gt;How does this prove anything?  You have given no proof that running too
&gt;&gt;cool was responsible for the engine wear.  It could have been that the oil
&gt;&gt;was never changed, for instance.  And furthermore, you should be banned
&gt;&gt;from the list for even implying that a volvo engine has anything in 
&gt;&gt;common with an air-cooled volksie.  :)

Please Dave, don't ban me from the vanagon list. I depend on it to keep up my
vanagons to give me rides and it is too important for me. 

I guess Volvo is indeed watercooled and obviously is not an air cooled Porsche 
or VW. I do believe my Volvo engine was ruined by the previous owner by running 
with broken thermostat. And I am suspecting my 83 westy's engine is also ruined 
by the same reason.

How dare I was to link between aircooled Vee Dubs and watercooled Volvos. But,
anyhow please don't ban me from the list. I won't mention a word about it ever
again.

BTW, I read an engine rebuilding text book, used by schools of mechanical 
engineering, some years ago. In the book there was a graph which showed 
that, by statistics, most engines suffered much more from cylinder wear in the 
first cylinder than the 2nd and the third and the fourth... The book reasoned 
that the first cylinder is right behind the radiator and the fan and is cooler
than other cylinders. 

Just curious, Dave, if you don't have the flap how do you konw if your engine
is over cooled, especially in winter? I guess it is constantly cooled at maximum
cooling. I am worrying about your engine for you, you know. Yeh, that's it.
You live in San Diego and it's always hot there. But isn't it that with a flap
your engine would warm up faster, may be in a minute instead of several minutes?
And besides it will stay at constant temp most of time. Never mind, it has 
worked for you that way so just ignore this please. Do I get to stay with the 
list?
