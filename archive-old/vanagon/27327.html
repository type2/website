&gt;From the thread that lives on:  Last night I saw a Tempo with 2&quot; gold 
letters on the trunk lid, the kind you might buy at the hardware store
to put your address on your house, or your license number on your boat
or something.  &quot;NO TAILGATEING&quot;  Honest, I saw it.  I turned at the 
next light.  Jim
