Hi folks

Time has come for me and my '84 (Cherise) to part ways, as my flock of autos
is getting a little too big. The van is a daily driver, and is in good
condition. Cherise has been very good to me, and has been well-maintained.
I'm asking $6250. Here's some details:

4 speed, beige (pale yellow) color, 135k miles on original engine (as far as
I know), no leaks, AM/FM/cassette. Includes 180 amp-hour house battery
system, window screens, tables &amp; curtains, Bentley manual, and snow chains.
No A/C. 
Original carpets in great shape (always covered). Decent paint, good interior,
trailer hitch (great for bike rack).

Recent : brakes, plug wires, catalytic converter, muffler, water pump, fuel
pump, filter, and regulator, 6-ply tires, skylight. The PO had some tranny
work done. 

Known problems : the fridge runs only on gas (no 12v or 120v operation).
There is a rip in the bug screen of the pop-up.  Cherise has the same
fuel-pump noise problem as Gerry Skerbitz's van. I have received a new
(used) gas tank, and will have this problem fixed before I sell her.

I am located in Manitou Springs, Colorado, just west of Colorado Springs.
Please contact me directly through e-mail at felix_at_sisna_dot_com. Thanks!  Jim Felix
