&gt; I was checking out the VW Dictionary  in the archives &amp; noticed for the
&gt;  87 1/2 Wolfs. Ed Vanagon under E. Miscellaneous .....   Power door locks
&gt;  including side door and rear hatch.  I'm the 3rd owner of an 87 Wolfs.
&gt;  Ed Vanagon &amp; never realized that it should have power door locks.  I
&gt;  always have to lock the passenger door, side door &amp; rear hatch manually.

I thought that all 87-1/2 WLEs had them, but perhaps you don't have them??

To check &amp; see if you do, look on the rear side of the passenger side 'B'
pillar.  This is the pillar that the front passenger door latches to.  On the
back side of this pillar (where the sliding door closes to) there should be a
black plastic rectangular thing (about 2&quot; tall x 1.25&quot; wide) with 4 brass
cylinders (about 1/4&quot; dia) protruding out from it.  These are the electrical
contacts where power for the locks enters the sliding side door when it is
closed.  If you have these contacts, you have power door locks.

&gt;  1)  What do I have to check to get the Power door locks to work again?

Check the fuse.  After that it's amater of knowing how to troubleshoot
electrical systems that would be too long to describe here.
  
&gt;  2)  Is it going to cost an arm &amp; a leg to have the dealer get it to work?

Depends on the problem &amp; how long it takes to find.  If it's a loose wire
that they find quickly it shouldn't cost much.  Then again, it could take
them ours to sort it out and that would cost bucks.

Good luck,
