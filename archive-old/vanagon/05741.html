&gt;It would be wonderful if someone made a plastic, weatherproof, enclosure

&gt;Does anyone know if there is such a thing?

it's possible that you could draw up something like you want, and have one
of these canvas awning makers (that make these custom awnings for businesses
and restaurants) make something up for you. anybody else think of someone
else who might custom make such a thing?
