&gt; &gt; OK, let's have a show of hands.....how many campers are the
&gt; &gt; boil-in-bag types, and how many of us keep a dutch oven under
&gt; &gt; the jump seat and charcoal under the bed?
&gt; 
&gt; Well I know of one person that has just a can-o-prunes!

Must be David S., I already threw mine out... seems they need to be 
fidged after being opened.  I think David mentioned something about his 
cat dying when he finally opened his can.

And on the serious side (do we have one?), I always carry PowerBars for 
emergency food. A few of them and some water will last ya for a day or 
two.
