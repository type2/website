Subject: List administration announcement

VW Brick List Members,
I'm going to be unavailable Thursday April 7th and Friday April 8th CDT,
so the list will be running by itself.   If there are problems, 
they'll be taken care of when I get back on Sunday the 10th.

Let's cross our fingers.  The list has been running very well, and I'm 
really excited about the level of participation.  Thanks for your 
cooperation in making it happen!  And to all the thank yous I've 
gotten -- &quot;You're Welcome&quot; and thanks in return for your support.

If you see anything remotely funny in the next 12 hours, please let me 
know before I leave.
