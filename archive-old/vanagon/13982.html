I'm not on a tirade against dealership mechanics 'cause there is a 
good one in Bemidji... HOWEVER, on this '87 i bought from St. Cloud, 
MN (no dealership names mentioned but its the only one) here's what 
i've noticed from their 'factory trained' servicing:

oil cooler nut loose and old style o-ring despite persistent 
complaints from P.O. regarding leakage

non-blue goo antifreeze

loose spark plugs, fitted into dirty holes

and just yesterday i noticed the #$%&amp; fuel filter is installed 
BACKWARDS!!!

all this work was done at the dealership as it *is* shown on the service 
records...
