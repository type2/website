&gt;  &gt; When I saw the above notation, I envisioned *four* gauges,
&gt;  &gt; one for each cylinder.  Is this overkill?  Is this
&gt;  &gt; obsession?  Is this insurance?  Is there a 4-cylinder gauge?
&gt; 
&gt; So, yes, you can just go out and buy one.  Go to your local BIG newsstand and 
&gt; get a copy of &quot;Trade-a-Plane&quot;, and browse the ads for guages and sensors...
&gt; 
&gt; Mind you, none of this stuff is cheap.  Single CHT or EGT guages for aircraft
&gt; typically cost on the order of $200.  Yow.   It's the paperwork, see, it has 
&gt; to exceed the weight of the part or it's not safe for an airplane.

A plug for &quot;How to HotRod your Air Cooled VW engine&quot;.  They discuss this
topic.  One thing they suggest to save money is to mount four senders
and have a switch to toggle a single gauge between them.  Or, you can do
what I do.  Go to the junkyard every weekend, and eventually you will
find four CHT gauges.  I found a VDO gauge last weekend - got it for $2.
I have three of them now.  Just need one more.  If you are patient enough, 
and don't insist on matching gauges, you can get four gauges and four 
senders for chicken feed.  :)

Even if you buy all VDO it should be under $200.  Let's see...

4 VDO CHT gauges (4x$25) 		$100
4 VDO Senders	 (4x$18)		$ 72
								----
								$172 + tax

Yep, under $200.  No small chunk of change, to be sure, but if it allows
you to spot an impending engine meltdown it will be worth it.
