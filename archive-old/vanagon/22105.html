Subject: Electrical Questions (alt vs gen &amp; more...)


Two questions:

1) Alternator vs Generator
Currently I have generator of questionable origin and history.  I haven't
much faith in it and would like to replace it.

What should I replace it with, an alternator or another generator.  My car is
a '66 bus (1600dp) and is slowly requiring more juice (interior lights, CB, 
phone, radio, fog lamps, spot light, cooltron, maybe even a reverse light! etc).

Further, (and this relates to #2) I'm planning to put in a second battery
to run most of these accessories. (and still be able to leave the campground
under my own power; my gf dented the front pushstarting me:-)

2) Bought a battery seperator from JCW (about 17$US) that has three little
terminals on it and instructions for alternators.  Can this be used with a
generator?  The little terminals are puny when compared to the big honkin'
units on the battery.  Whats up with that?

Thanks for the help,
...Markus
