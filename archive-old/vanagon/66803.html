Subject:        Eurovan brake vibration

My 95 Eurobago has developed a pulsation of the brake pedal
when applied at speeds above 50 mph;  feels like something is
out of balance between the pedal and the road.  My original
Goodyear tires have 20k miles, cann't see any uneven wear.
VW replaced the front brake rotors; this didn't change anything.

Has anyone had a similar problem, or know the cause of such resonance?
Thanks,

Andy Mera
