Subject: CV Joints Thrust bearing (Jetta)

Hello all,

Finally got around to dropping the right axle on my Jetta due to 
horrible but intermittent CV noise. I haven't checked the Vanagon 
Bentley, and haven't yet done this on my Westy, but do bus type CV's 
use thrust washers? If so, is it common for these to explode? Turns 
out my horrible crunching sound was due to pieces of the washer 
flying around inside the joint! I've done 5-6 CVs on FWD VWs, but 
have never seen this before. What would cause it?
Can these washers be found easily? Since my new lobro joint didn't 
come with them, I'm assuming they're not normally replaced.

I'm hoping this isn't one of those dealer only things...
