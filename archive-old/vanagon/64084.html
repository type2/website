Subject: Re: waving

I've noticed that in parts of the country where VW buses are relatively
rare-in the midwest or south, for instance- drivers invariably wave and/o=
r
honk and flash their lights when encoutering another bus.  On the west
coast,  where one regularly encounters other buses, it's practiced less
often.  It's definitely something to be encouraged.  =
