Subject: 3 axle Syncro-ing?

Hi All,

Thanks to Sami D. I have found an 87 Syncro not too far from home that I
am possibly buying.  I have yet to check it out, but I have delt with the
guy on some VW deals before and he seems a pretty decent sort.  The Syncro
is a 4 speed with 160k miles on it and has rec'd decent care.  The few
problems initially reported were:

rf CV clicking
Muffler nds replacing

Later, the clutch slave cyl. needed replacing after the temps went to zero
around here.  Once fixed, the rf clicking CV went out which he is now
getting fixed.  He mentioned that he could still drive it with 3 axles.
How much he is doing this, I dunno.  Can this hurt the running gear?  Is 
this cause for alarm?  Just curious,
