I have a request.  I have noticed that sometimes questions are answered on
the List and other times just by e-mail to the Listee that asked the
question.  I may be really out of line here but don't you think that a lot
of people could benefit from reading the responses on the list?   I know
that fairly new listees like myself haven't had good fortune of reading the
wisdom of all the List members over the years  and maybe it is boring to
people who are well versed in VW problem solving but just speaking for
myself, I see new people joining the ranks every day and I would think they
would get a lot out of &quot;published&quot; responses.  We have saved a lot of time
and money with the help of fellow Listees.  Just a though.
