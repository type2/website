Subject: '85 Starting Problem


I have an '85 that isn't starting sometimes. The problem is erratic. It 
has only happened a couple of times.._dot_usually after a drive of a couple 
of hours.

Something that may be totally unrelated is the sound that I heard just 
before the first time it happened. I was stopped at a friends unloading 
stuff when I heard a &quot;pop&quot; sound. It sounded like a glass breaking (but 
making a &quot;popping&quot; noise&quot;), only no sound of glass tinkling on the 
ground. I was standing a few feet in front of the car and it sounded like 
it came from the rear.

Right after I heard that sound, the car wouldn't start...planty of battery, 
but nothing when I turned the key. Just rolled it down the hill to start 
it. It happened again 20 minutes later at home. 

I just had it happen again 3 hours into a 6hour drive. I could see the 
people in the restaurant laughing at a 5'2&quot; girl and a 6'3&quot; guy pushing a 
big loaded van back and forth a couple of times to get it started.

If I let it sit for a while (25+ minutes) it will start fine.


Would it be the Starter?
Any Idea what the &quot;popping&quot; sound might be?

Sorry this is so long.
I didn't see anyting in the archives on &quot;the sound&quot;

Any help is appreciated.
