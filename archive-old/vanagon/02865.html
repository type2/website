Subject: GD AC went out!
Date: Thu, 11 Aug 94 11:19:40 PDT

Well... I was driving home last night with the windows rolled up
and was slowly gettin' warmer.  It was in the low 90's, not too
bad.  But as I was getting closer to home I thought that I should
be cooler and not sweating.  Typically the AC air doesn't get to
the front too well on a short drive but I can usually feel it on
my back.  When I got home, I left the AC switch on and found out
that nothing was blowing out of the vents.  So I check to make sure
the belt was okay.  The fuses...well I did't really get to those
because they are well hidden.  My guess is that the freon level has
gotten low enough to where the system just won't kick on at all.
I think this system works like that but I'm not certain.  

Any useful tips before I take it to VW?  

Thanks,

Steven
