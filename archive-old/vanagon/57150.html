Subject: Re: WTB '81 Vanagon Oil Temp Gauge

&gt; motor with an oil temperature gauge. The local VDO dealer is asking
&gt; around $70 for them. That's a lot of gas and food money if you know what
&gt; I mean, so I was wondering if anyone knows of a cheaper source for these
&gt; invaluable little gauges. Possibly mail order? If anyone is interested

RMMW (800)258-1996 is getting $29 for the gauge, $14 for the sender 
and there are better prices out there, but probably not much better 
than $25 and $12.
