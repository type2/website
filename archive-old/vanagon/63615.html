	In my '79 westphalia, I've got some kind of fuel injection
problem that has been befuddling me for a great while.  It starts up
fine but as soon as it warms up and the cold start valve starts turning
off, it gets way weak and sometimes even dies if I don't up the RPM.
When it finally gets warmed up and driving, it's fine, runs like the
happy beast it is while it's temperature is in the medium range.  But
within twenty minutes of driving--I'm guessing when the temperature has
reached full operating temp--I stop at a stop light and the RPM is too
high, probably around 1300-1600RMP, though I haven't tested it yet.

	I've replaced the temp head sensor and fixed a weak ground
connection and now just finally got a spiffy new Bosch air flow meter
(aye, this cost a pretty penny, but I needed it for smog check anyway)
and each thing has actually improved the driving in other ways--lots
more power now--but I still have this problem.

	I can't think of anything left it could be except the control
unit, ye old computer itself.  Visual inspection shows hoses and such
are fine, no cracks or nuthin.  Has anyone ever seen anything like this?
