Subject: update from rusty van bondo (


List member Rusty van Bondo sent me an e-mail today on account of a
car part I shipped to him.  He says he'll update the list when he
returns from his &quot;vacation&quot; on the 9th, but in the meantikme asked 
me to fill you all in on his progress:

He writes:

&quot;Please pass the word on to the list that Rusty's '67 &quot;Westy Resto from Hell&quot;
finally went green today!!! I saw it with my own &lt;oversparayed&gt; eyes. I
mentioned to Michael Heron that this hopefully means that it will be color
sanded by June. ;)&quot;
