&gt;the engine sounds great. we determined that the starter is okay..but the
&gt;solenoid is bad. we could get power to the starter by hooking it to the

&gt;boot is cracked and will have to be replaced. i have a whole extra
&gt;transaxle for a '74...will that work on a '77?

Woahahahaha!!!!!  Well, I might just have something to say about that, but
seeing as how you got such a good deal, and didn't even offer to sell me
your '74 tranny when I so desparately needed it, I'm not gonna tell ya!
How about that?  :-)

No, really.  The 74 tranny will work in the 77, but why would you want to
swap them?  The '74 has a lower final drive ratio, so you won't be able to
go as fast in each gear with it, but you will accelerate quicker.  Some
things to be careful of - you will have to swap the bellhousings on the
trannies because the 77 has a larger flywheel and will hit the '74
bellhousing, and the starter won't fit unless you do.  Also, the mount at
the front of the transmission may be different, so look at that also.

Hey, I know!  Swap the trannies, then sell me the one out of the 77!  Yeah!
