&gt;Wow, lost anyone yet? Hey where's Mom?  There was a recall on my '85 slider
&gt;for the very same reason, maybe VW is recycling recall parts now :o  Tim

My wife's 88 had this problem.  It seemed to bother her alot.  I don't know
why, we could have more kids.  I SOLVED THE PROBLEM by replacing the latch at
the rear of the door.  I couldn't detect anything wrong with the old latch,
but replacing it solved the problem 100%.

Helpful suggestion: This can be done without removing the whole door panel.
 You'll need to detach the locking rod from the handle at the front of the
door.  Then attach something to it like a straightened coathanger.  Next,
remove the latch mechanism.  To disconnect this end of the rod, you'll need
to pull it away from the door and the coathanger at the front end will keep
you from losing it in the door.  Replace the latch.  Pull the rod back to the
front with the coathanger and re-attach it to the front handle mechanism.

Good Luck,
