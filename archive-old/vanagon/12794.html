Aha Gotcha! &lt;Carb and DP Cyl Head Advise Wanted...

I am in the process of restoring a '67 Westy and have run into unexpected
delays in building a 1776cc. The short block is together using a 20 over
case, Balanced crank, 110 cam and 90.5s. Delays have been caused due to
confusion as to the best choices for heads and carbs. Availability of the
options in each category are also troubling. The goal is to build a very
dependable motor that has a little extra poop without attempting to be a
&quot;Ricky Racer&quot;. 

Heads:
3/4&quot; reach vs Stock
I thought I'd go with a 3/4&quot; reach with 35.5 and 40. It appears that new DP
3/4&quot; reach heads are next to impossible to get... 040 and 041s are history,
Bernie Bergman heads are unavailable, Several inquiries into the infamous
(massively advertised) 045s have been met with &quot;We expect them in 'middle of
NEXT month (since August, '94). A couple of gurus suggested that the 3/4&quot;
reach is unnecessary and a stock dual port with a mild increase in the
exhaust valve coupled with extensive porting/matching would better serve my
purpose. This is still expnsive! They said that the bigger valves are not
needed unless a 2 liter race/performace motor was the goal. Other engine
building pros scoff and mention about breathing and efficiency of the larger
valves blah, blah.

Carbs:
Should I use a stock carb, a set (pair) of baby del 32,34? singles that I
have but need shafts done, use a single 44 and choak the jet to death, pay a
billion $ for dual 40s or take the advise of one guy that thought a single
45 DCOE Weber side draft was the best option!? Availabilty of these treats
are also elusive. Electric choke would be nice but not really necessary
where I live.

My purpose is to build the motor once, do it right and be happy. My ego (and
budget) doesnt require to be cool for cool sake or to get into the latest
thing. I'd much rather go fishing/camping and not break down on the way.

Sorry for the long post but real advise (technical) would be very appreciated.
