Subject: Re: EV oil change to EV lugs...

&gt; Speaking of factory guys w/ a sense of humor, I would also
&gt; recommend that all you EV owners/drivers take a look at the
&gt; bolts holding your wheels on;  if you've never taken them off,
&gt; you best look at them soon, at least BEFORE you get a flat on the
&gt; road because ALL of my bolts were put on at the factory bone dry.
&gt; This generally translates to being fused to the hub and if you
&gt; find this out at the beginning of a long awaited trip, you will
&gt; be p-r-e-t-t-y pissed off....  Now, granted, I'm not a big guy,
&gt; but it took a Yakima rack crossbar acting as a cheater bar to
&gt; break the lock on these bolts  (OK, you can stop laughing now,
&gt; Kevin).

I'm laughing only in agreement.  I have blowout (road debris) and I could 
NOT get the lugs off.  Had to call AAA and HE had trouble with a four 
foot wrench...
