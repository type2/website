Subject: Bus/Vanagon Mirror List Deal - They Made It!!
Date: Wed, 14 May 1997 14:37:37 -0400


The German Vanagon and Bus Mirrors that I promised you at bargain-basement
prices are finally in the US from Germany, and are on their way to me via
UPS; I'll have them in my hands within a couple of days.

The exception is that I will be short five left-side Bus mirrors, which
will follow next week.  So I will fill the left bus mirror orders on a
first-come basis and send the last five out a week later.  (If you order a
pair of bus mirrors, and miss the first batch of left mirrors, I'll send
you both sides the following week when the remaining lefts come in.)

I believe that I have responded to everyone individually to confirm
interest, quantities, etc.  Some of those e-mails I sent today.  If you
wanted a mirror and did not receive an e-mail from me, then I missed you so
please let me know.

If you did not order mirrors, but want to, there will be some extras.  If
interested, please send me an e-mail specifying what you want and what your
ZIP code is.

To recap, these are real German Mirrors, not the lower quality Mexican
ones, at a fraction of the dealer price. 

Bus Mirrors (1968-1979 only, chrome)  $18.50 each 
(does not include the part that screws into the door, which is another
$3.50 ea. if you need it).  

Vanagon mirrors (pre-89 style, non-electric, black, flat glass),  $19.95
each. 

Mirrors for Beetles ('67-on), Golfs, Jettas, Audis, etc. are also
available; e-mail me.  Pre-67 bus mirrors and late style electric Vanagon
mirrors are, unfortunately, not part of the deal.
