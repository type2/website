If I understand correctly you sat for 45 minutes with the engine idling?
I would guess that you &quot;loaded up&quot; the spark plugs during this time
causing your engine to perform poorly afterwards. If it is not already
better try cleaning/regapping the plugs. 
As for the brake light, I would guess it had to do with the emergency
brake and freezing temperatures. Sometimes they do not mix.
Good Luck

Questions:
&gt;&gt;        1.  Are these two connected?
&gt;&gt;        2.  Any ideas as to what is causing them and how to fix?
