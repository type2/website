?1;0c&gt; Then the next time back to near normal.
&gt; 
&gt; On a trip last weekend, we had driven about 80 miles and the Oxygen sensor
&gt; and alternator lights lit up but very dimly (it was dark), about 15 seconds
&gt; later, they pulsated and became dimmer, then went out! I pulled over and
&gt; found a mist of coolant on the rear bumper, and when I opened the inspection
&gt; door behind the license plate, again, the coolant was full to the top and
&gt; apparently had blown excess out the top which the engine had apparently

    Sad to say, you have a blown head gasket. The combusion gas is leaking
    into the cooling system, forcing the coolant out!
