Subject: Re: magic coolers


I bought one--but returned it a few days later--having
decided to stick with my cooler.  It can only get the
interior to 40 degrees (F) below &quot;outside temp&quot;.  So
in the sumnmer, when it is ~100+ in the parked Vanagon,
it would be ~60+ and that's not cool enough to keep
the food.  Plus it would be running all the time.

I thought--well, it could run all night, get the interior
cold, then I could cover it with a blanket, etc, etc.

In the end, I decided that buying ice every three days
was the way to go--still.

If others have used them and like them, I'd like to hear
how they do it.
