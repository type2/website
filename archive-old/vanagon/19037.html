Subject: How sweet it is

Volks,

Having just spent some time over in rec.autos.vw I must say I am glad that
this group is as cordial and responsible as it is.  Some people seem to
think the net is for insulting, it's so much easier to rag on somebody when
you don't have to meet them.  The line between debate and arguing seems
often violated.

Eug,
