Subject: Wiring on power steering pump

 
While poking around at the engine on my '89 Westy I noticed a sort of 
plug at the back of the power steering pump. The naked prongs of the plug 
definitely looked as if something was supposed to be hooked up to them 
and sure enough on closer inspection I found two dangling wires.
 
One wire was red and white and the other was sort of white or yellowish. 
Does anybody know which wire goes on top and bottom or does it matter ? 
Also what function does this connection serve ? I've had no trouble with 
the steering.
