&gt; Hello all-
&gt; 
&gt; Recently my '86 Westy has developed a problem with the clutch. After I have been
&gt; driving in stop-and-go traffic for awhile, the clutch begins to &quot;chatter&quot; when I
&gt; try to start from a stop.  The only way I can prevent this from happening is to
&gt; rev the motor up to about 3000 rpm while I let the clutch out. Any ideas on what
&gt; is causing this, and what needs to be done to fix it?

Hey guys,

My 86 GL does the same thing when hot, I've just been living with it but
would love to hear some ideas about this.
