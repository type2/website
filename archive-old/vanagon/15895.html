  David Carment asks:

  BTW it is normal for there to be a delay in idle drop. 4-5 seconds is not
  abnormal. DC Since we are in the topic: is there anyone who can convince
  me that the full throttle switch actually does something? DC

  Bentley says that the full throttle switch tells the injection control unit
  to ignore the oxygen sensor. This info. is for the '79 California model
  breadloaf, but I think the injection system is the same for Calif. model
  80-83 Vanagons.

  Eugene asks:

  What is the rev limit on a dual spring type IV?


  I don't know about dual spring type IV motors, but on a stock single spring
  engine, the rev limiter is set at 5400 rpm. Carbureted engines have &lt;or are
  supposed to have&gt; a rev limiting rotor in the distributor and F.I. engines
  have a limiter built into the injection control unit.
