Subject: FW: Extra Gas?

PLEASE- Do not put or carry gasoline in a ziplok bag!

If  you want to carry extra gas in the car, do it in an approved
container only.  Other containers may be subject to breaking down from
the petro-chemical make up of gasoline, let alone impact resistance,
legality, etc.  Also, I would recommend purchasing a container that is
stronger than the $2.98 metal cans, and make it a small size- just
enough to get you to a station; this would be safer.

&gt;
&gt;     No I do not believe it is safe.  I have read that gasoline fumes are a 
&gt;     carcinogen.  Understand that what constitutes prolonged exposure may 
&gt;     not be the levels experienced while traveling in your van. 
&gt;     
&gt;     Why would you want to smell it?  A great number of people experience 
&gt;     far more immediate side effects of gasoline vapor inhalation such as 
&gt;     nausea.
&gt;     
&gt;     Why not just strap it to your roof?  That's what I do.  I've never had 
&gt;     anyone steal my container, and it just looks cool up there.
&gt;     
&gt;     But if you are hell bent on keeping it inside your van, search out 
&gt;     some type of vapor containment device.  Several outdoor companies make 
&gt;     dry bags for rafting/kayaking that you could certainly put a small 1 
&gt;     gallon gas can in.  It would certainly save you the stench.  Maybe 
&gt;     even a giant zip-lock back.
&gt;     
&gt;     Hope this helps.......

&gt;I was wondering if it is safe to carry an extra gallon of gas in a gas 
&gt;canaster inside my 1980 camper.  I'm sure some people do it.  Could you 
&gt;put the canaster in one of the cabinets?  (since my gas meter is broke, I 
&gt;have to judge the level on milage)
&gt;     
&gt;Any advice would be great.
