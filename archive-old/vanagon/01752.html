I was the one that had posted the original question about bike racks. 
I was looking for something that would not go on the back as I need to
get to the engine to keep the oil level up.  The roof rack is 
expensive even for a guy who works at a bike shop so I had decided on 
something for the front.  Nothing to worry about on top, like ripping 
the bikes off at the drive-thru.  Now, someone points out that it 
might be illegal to put them on the front in some states.  Back to the
drawing board unless someone has a better idea.  :(  Does anyone know 
where the bikes on the front might be illegal?  I sure do see a lot of
vehicles on the road with this set up.
