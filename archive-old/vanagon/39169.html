Subject: Anti theft device??



My nice Blaupunkt cassette radio was stolen from my 84 Westfalia this morning!
The the thief forced the right front quarter window and opened the door.
Lets face it, a Westfalia is not difficult to break in to.  Does anyone on
the list have experience of propriatory or home made alarms?  A guess a 
vibration type would work but would probably wake the neighbors 
at 3:00 am as well...
