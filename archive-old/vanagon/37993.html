Sorry Dennis, I disagree with you here.  I have the original alternator 
still in my 77 Rabbit.  I replaced the brushes 6 years ago and have never 
had to touch the bearings.  This alternator has slowly gone from 23 
Amps output 3 years ago to its current (little pun, there) 10 Amps.  

Obviously the diodes are going and while I could get another diode pack 
and put it in, I'll probably opt to buy a lifetime warranteed rebuilt 
unit just so I don't have to go through this again (in another 10 
years...:) ).   

Electronic construction processes being what they are (ion implantation) 
any electronic device will _decay_ or lose it's effectiveness over time, 
particularly one in such a hostile environment as an automobile engine 
compartment.
