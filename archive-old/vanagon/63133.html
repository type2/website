&gt;I'll call the bus depot and talk with them about some help. The
&gt;preliminary assessment from the vw dealership--&quot;You've got oil
&gt;pouring out of the heads.&quot; Sounds like new engine time to me. Thanks

Ask the dealer for more information. This could be a leaky valve cover
gasket (very easy and cheap to fix) or leaky pushrod tubes (moderately easy
and not too expensive to fix). I can think of no other condition that would
cause oil to leak from heads except for some catastrophic failure in which
the head was cracked or punctured somehow. Head gasket problems are
associated with coolant leaks, not oil leaks.
