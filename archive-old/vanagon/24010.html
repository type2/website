&gt;&gt;&gt;Because, he explained, as I drive home from work,
&gt;&gt;&gt;   And I drive at the speed-limit posted,
&gt;&gt;&gt;All the cars on the road zoom by, faster than me,
&gt;&gt;&gt;   So the speedo just has to be toasted!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;What part of Southen California does this guy live in?
&gt;
&gt;actually, it happened in birmingham, alabama ... and is a true story.
&gt;the guy actually brought his car in because people were passing him on the
&gt;interstate when he was driving the speed limit!!!
&gt;

This _really_ happened???

Actually, we who drive air-cooled bakery products are all too familiar
with this situation, especially when going up long, gradual hills. But
you have to wonder if this guy was as clueless as he sounds, or was he
indulging in a little bit of pompous righteousness, trying to force
other to declare how &quot;right&quot; he was...

A clue would be, which lane was he in? Fie on you veedubbers who do
your thing in the fast lane-- &quot;keep right except to pass&quot;, remember?
Goes for non-VWs, too, of course-- I had to pass a Corvette on the
right who was doing about 60 in the fast lane of an interstate. No,
not in my bus at the time-- that baby LIVES in the right lane.

Actually, with the occasional airbrain like that vette jockey, the
right lane sometimes turns out to be the fastest...  :)

No, my driving is far from perfect. But I try not to get in the way
TOO much... deliberately using the laws, to mess people up, is
beneath contempt. Leave it for OJ's lawyers.


&gt;and the worst part is that the mechanics took his word that something was
&gt;wrong without checking first. old Tom spent several hours on that one.

Hope Tom charged the dweeb full rates for the educational value.
Whether he actually got any was up to him, IMHO.

Sorry, this is one of my hot buttons. Now resetting... reloading human
attributes.
