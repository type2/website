    And so, I'm lookin' for other ideas.  Anybody painted their bus
    anything but stock color?  Any interesting design suggestions?
    (This bus is far from stock with no chance of returning to stock so
    I'm not worried about keeping it the original color.  I also hope
    to get a chance to paint the '66 and that one I'll keep stock,
    Titian Red bottom, Beige Grey top.  And the paint on the '73 is
    still good (Orange).)

Well, I painted mine the same hue but
a much lighter tint as the &quot;doorframe&quot;
color (before it was dirty yellow above,
brown below -- now it is butter yellow
all over).  At first I thought I would
dislike it, but I like it more and more.

If I had my real druthers (i.e., if I
didn't give a rat's ass whatsoever about
how embarassed the kids would be), I'd
have an artist friend paint it like the
panel van the Mass Horticultural Society
has -- rain forest canopy peppered with
a riot of colored birds perched hither
and yon.

Did see what I can only call a Jackson
Pollack bus one time.  Is the owner on
this list?
