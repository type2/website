&gt;Hey, I had the same type of problem when I used the flush made by the
&gt;one and only greatest Pr#st*n#.
&gt;
I believe the stuff I used was  Pr#st*n# also.

&gt;I had to have the radiator rodded out and I had to pull a round 
&gt;scraper
&gt;thru the pipes to get out some kind of crud stuck inside of the pipes.

I wanted to have this done but no one around here had the end gaskets.The
shop used a this &quot;sonic?&quot; machine to blast/boil it out. worked good.
&gt;
&gt;Side note: Tech 2000 antifreeze has the same chemical composition as 
&gt;the
&gt;&quot;phosphate-free&quot; Pr#st*n# brand.
&gt;
Is that good or bad?
