Subject: RFI - slightly off-topic - old VW ads on the net


     A minor glitch, but when the address for the &quot;Baywatch&quot; crew cab and 
     bus were posted last week, I ran out and copied the picture down to my 
     WindowsNT &quot;wallpaper&quot;.  What I didn't realize at the time was that my 
     actions nuked the previous wallpaper out of existence.
     
     Anyway, where is the &quot;Mass Transit&quot; ad?  It's the one with the nine 
     Nuns getting into the '66 or so red-and-white deluxe.  I scanned my 
     saved links, but couldn't come up with a logical path to check out.
     
     Any help would be appreciated.
