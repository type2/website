&gt;I have a yellowy-beige Vanagon 1985.  I am considering selling it because
&gt;it takes my attention away from my '71 bus.  The Vanagon has about
&gt;125,000 on it.  It has new rubber all around.  Its heads have been
&gt;replaced within the last 60,000 miles and a new stud kit installed at the
&gt;time.  CV joints are 20,000 miles old.  No middle seat, and the interior
&gt;could use sprucing up.  Nice non-stock stereo (Nakamichi).
&gt;Body has a couple of dings but only a couple of pin sized rust spots at
&gt;the site of some rock nicks.
&gt;General notion of what I should ask for such a thing?

it really depends a LOT on what section of the country you are in. in the
southeast, an 85 automatic, solid-beige, brown interior (fair shape), with
135,000 miles was on the lot at an asking-price of $3000. it had a good bit
of surface rust on the exterior, and the coolant tank didn't look too good.

i'd suggest at least $2500 for starters. the best thing to do is to call a
bank or credit union, tell them that you want to BUY such a vehicle, and
see what they think it is worth. :)  &lt;USE the bastards!!!&gt;
