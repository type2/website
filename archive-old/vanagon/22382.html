                      RE&gt;Seat Belts                                8/8/95

A follow up on this - Pertains to Vanagons (at least, maybe the &quot;lofs too)
that have the middle seat, with the handrail on it's back.

Some friends in the neighborhood, in their vanagon, had an accident that
wasn't too serious, except the son in the middle of the third seat
&quot;flopped&quot;forward from the waist, restrained by his lap belt but smashed his
face into the hand rail.  He has some significant facial injuries/broken
bones.

I removed the handrail from the back of my middle seat.

Harvey
