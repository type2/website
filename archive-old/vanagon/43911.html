Subject: Vanagon look a like
Date: Fri, 7 Jun 1996 23:50:33 -0400 (EDT)

&gt; 
&gt; Several years ago when I visited the UK , Toyota or Nissan was marketing 
&gt; a van called the ACE which never made it to the US shores. It looked very 
&gt; much like the boxy Vanagon. When I visited Japan I also saw similar type 
&gt; vehicles.
&gt; During that time the only family type vans  available in the US was the VW 
&gt; Bus. The GM Ford and Chrysler products were more of a tradesvan rather 
&gt; than for family use and lacked the interior refinements unless 
&gt; customized by a third party . When Toyota brought in their first Minivan, 
&gt; I said to myself, the Japanese must have made a deal with the US Auto Mfr or
&gt; their Unions by only bringing in those minivans when they they could have 
&gt; brought in those Vanagon size vehicles with enough interior and exterior 
&gt; refinements. It would certainly have captured a big slice of the 
&gt; family van market before Chrysler introduced the Minivan. If any one can 
&gt; share their information or knowledge on this topic, it will be interesting
&gt; to find out what really happened.
