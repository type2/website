&gt; So Thom, you're gonna get a club.  Where are you gonna get the spare steering
&gt; wheel?  The local trick is a hacksaw through the perimeter of the steering
&gt; wheel and poof the club is off and so are they.
&gt; 
&gt; Of course, they might just move to the next desirable split down the way if
&gt; there is one.  A hidden switch that grounds the points works mucho better.
&gt; Engine cranks, everything seems normal to the hotwirers but hey no spark.   

I think that I am dealing with very unsophisticated thieves here.  If they
were so smart, they'd a already had the bus :( :)

I have talked to some other bus owners with similar problems, and they have
a good idea who it is, its just hard to prove it or catch them at it.
There are a lot of young guys (16-21 +/-) that are getting into the bus
scene and have no cash or scruples, and have no qualms about swiping a
bus for the cool parts and then dumping it in the river.  Its happened a 
few times already.  They especially seem to love safari windows.
