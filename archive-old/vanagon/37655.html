Subject: valve stem seals...

Volks,

Not sure if my first post made it... I'm installing new valves in a set
of new heads.  I Ordered the valves, etc. from MOFOCO. I also asked them
to send me a set of valve stem seals.  They said that these are not needed.
Is this so?  Won't I be burning the oil that leaks down along the stem?  If
I do need them are they included in the standard engine gasket kit?  BTW,
this is a 1600 DP I'm werkin on...

TIA, 

christian
