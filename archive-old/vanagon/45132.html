  High volume oil pump?  Nice idea.
  Now what I want to know is if there exist any higher volume VW water 
coolant pumps for Westy diesels.  Naturally this same inquiry would be 
appropriate for the gas motor water cooled boxes.
  I've recently leaned that both Ford and Chevy have produced 12 volt 
motor driven water pump equiped vehicles, so the duty cycle should be 
just what water cooled VW boxes need, and the volume is supposed to be 
considerably higher.  Speed shops sell a &quot;universal&quot; equivelant.
  I think others are amazingly forgiving for being told that you 
shouldn't let it idle too long nor run it as fast as the motor is 
DESIGNED TO RUN CONTINUOUSLY or it will over heat and hurt itself. 
Sounds like the kind of engineering I'd expect and forgive from a 
bunch wearing big black rubber ears and singing their Mickey Mouse 
song.
  So, if we added a powerful 12 volt water pump, should we trigger it with 
an engine heat sensor and use a check valve to avoid having it drive some 
of its flow backward through the inadequate stock VW pump at idle?  Then 
again, perhaps we could just remove the stock pump while saving the 
plumbing access.  Thoughts?  I can hardly wait to hear that I shouldn't 
expect it to be able to fast-idle long enought to recharge coach batteries
or that we shouldn't expect it to run with normal interstate trafic flow.
