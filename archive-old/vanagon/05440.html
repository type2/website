&gt; &gt;Sorry for the delay, this is the first time I've driven the Rabbit since
&gt; &gt;the question came up and I just haven't thought to look prior to this.

&gt; &quot;Well, if it worked when the car was new, and it doesn't work now, is it really
&gt; a design deficiency? Were the engineers at VW really that clueless, or could it

You're right, that is the _correct_ solution.  The thought of crawling through miles
of wire to find the ONE connector that was causing the problem made my nose
bleed.  So I went looking for another answer.  Both ways work, but it happened
that I had a spare relay kicking around and it was simple to put in, so....

In addition, I've noticed that once these things start to corrode, they continue
to do so (duh), so I decided it would be best to just fix the damn thing and be
done with it ;).

&gt; This was on a '72 Beetle. I thought about writing to VW to complain that after
&gt; 22 years, the inline spade connectors they used had developed enough electrical
&gt; resistanse to prevent enough current from getting to the solenoid, but then I
&gt; thought about it, and decided that a class action lawsuit was a better
&gt; alternative. But after paying a lawyer $2500 to research the case, and being
&gt; advised that I was a fool for paying $2500 for something any foole would know,
&gt; I decided to write this instead. :-) :-)
