&gt;  lets hear some
&gt; good news such as how long some of you list member's old high milage 
busses
&gt; have run without any real problems.

My old '69 bus in Dillon, Colorado (Altitude 9,000 ft.), went for three
months of DAILY commuting (incl weekends) to Boulder, CO-- about 100 miles
each way, in winter, over the Cntinental Divide (11,000 ft. in those parts).
With a '74 bug engine (DP. doghouse, 009, Solex 34PICT-3, single Tbird
Quiet pack) that I pulled out of a rolled bug, it had no, zero, zip, nada
breakdowns for the whole period. I often passed 4x4s stopped (in the middle
of the freeway, why do they do that?) to put on chains, making sure to
smile and wave as my &quot;Piece of sh*t&quot; whizzed merrily past them on its
cheap all-season radials. And the heater-box heater kept the bus toasty
all the way, sometimes in below-zero weather.

Now, my '71 bus I bought here in CA, well... you don't want to know.
I sold that one.
