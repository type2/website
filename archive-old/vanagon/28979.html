Wuerth's All-Cleaner is a solvent and is used sparingly in conjunction
with paper towels. Cleaning an entire engine with this may not be the most
efficient approach; it would be more like painstaking detailing. Since you
have a waterboxer, hence no engine seal, hosing it off would certainly be
the easiest method (after putting a plastic bag over the distributor cap). 

(But aren't Syncros *supposed* to be dirty??) ;-)
