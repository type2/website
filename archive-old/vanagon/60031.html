Subject: Troubleshooting help, please

My epic journey to vanagoness continues...

'85 GL continues to stump me.  Now it won't even idle for more than 
10-15 secs. (I wouldn't even call it idling)  I went through Bentley 
chap 24 (.17 through .37) with my trusty multimeter.  All checks were 
within spec's except for the pin 4-7 on the ECU plug which tests the 
idle cutoff switch.  I read an intermittent break in the circuit 
(infinite ohms).  Wiggling the middle connector revealed that area to 
be the main suspect.  I saw a similar connector (for a GM product) at 
the parts store today and will replace it.

Questions:

Will that switch have that great an effect?  It was mis-adjusted 
before which caused a surging just above idle, but that was 
corrected.  Now it won't idle and won't run at all above idle.

How does one test for CO content?  i.e. ... Where does one get the 
equipment (or access to it)?

Does anyone have any other tips that I could look into (Besides the 
one my wife continues to give me)?

Thanks for the help.
