Subject: Re: 92 Eurovan transmissions

&gt; Driving home this evening, it just died, with 3/4 of a tank of gas in it.
&gt; I was in rush hour traffic and it stalled.  Even in gear, it wouldn't fire
&gt; back up again, so I coasted into a wide spot along the freeway and waited
&gt; for a tow.  Lights and everything else work.  I can crank it and it'll
&gt; fire, but won't run.  Got it towed to the dealer I bought it at and left it
&gt; for the service idiots to mess up in the morning.  There was no clue that
&gt; anything was going to go wrong... except, and this is the ONLY thing amiss,
&gt; the clock was off a few hours when I got in it yesterday morning.  Then
&gt; last night it was off again!  I just reset it this morning and went to
&gt; work.  Note:  The stalling feels exactly like the problem I had last year,
&gt; which resulted in the dealer replacing the battery, the computer, the fuel
&gt; injection system and the exhaust system.  What's left??

How good really is the ground lead from the battery?  All of this could 
be electrical on a modern car.  You'd think the mechanic would check the 
wiring for real quality but might not have.  I suppose problems on the 
positive side of the electrics could be bad as well.  I'd have to get to 
the van to look but are there disconnects - intermittant disconnects or 
high resistance paths that are between the battery and the frame?

Just posulating...
