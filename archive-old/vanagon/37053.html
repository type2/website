Subject: Re: MIG welder advice needed

Be cautious about the Century units.  I have heard reports of them 
developing 'bird nests' in the wire spool and frustrating service.  
but the price IS attractive.

if you are a craftsman/woman and will be using it alot, i would save 
for a Lincoln or similar unit.  I would suggest the highest amperage 
unit that can run on 110v.  this gives you extreme portability for 
taking to other peoples homes and making them indebted to you.  the 
&quot;Weld Pac&quot; units in the Lincoln line are their bottom line and i 
would go up a few steps, tho their cost almost approaches the 
Century's at certain stores/sales.  In contrast, i have heard only 
very positive reports from people actually using the upper-end 
Lincoln machines.

If you are a discriminating sort, this advice should put you in a
dilemma.  I too was watered up for the Century units sold at Sams
etc.  Dug deeper information-wise and THEN wanted the Lincoln.  Dug
even DEEPER and bought a Miller ac/dc stick welder.  Still want the
Lincoln MIG unit and maybe should've bought that in retrospect for 
the bulk of the type of welding i do.  BUT sometimes there's just no 
substitute for amperage, gobs of it.
