Subject: &quot;Sierra &quot; Brand Acceptable Vanagon Coolant

Volks,
Is the &quot;Sierra&quot; brand an acceptable substitute for VW dealer coolant for 
use in a wasserboxer. I will have to drive 50 miles and pay $15/gal for 
VW coolant. The local VW shop sells Sierra rather than VW coolant due to 
the cost they say. Tell me volks, what to do. Also, what of the pink 
Toyota phosphate-free coolant? Is this more acceptable? I heard from one 
source that Sierra does not have that good of an anti-corrosion package 
and this is the last thing I want, even though it is phosphate-free. Any 
and all feedback appreciated.
Regards
