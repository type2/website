Responding to your letter to Joel...
Yes I know that I'm not Joel but...

After reading that diag. list that you posted you'll know.  The 
overflowing recovery tank makes itself obvious.  The only question I have 
is why didn't the mechanics at my dealership know about it.  They didn't 
know what was wrong with my Vanagon and futilly replaced many working 
parts before I suggested the gasket leak to them. I guess it wasn't 
futile for them... I paid for the replaced parts.  :(

If there is a lot of air in your pressure tank (and the rest of the 
system), but your recovery tank is overfull (coolant level way above the 
cap bottom) that has to be the problem.  The only way for air to get into 
a pressurized system (cooling system) is to come from a place of higher 
pressure (combustion chamber), the only way to do that is to slip under 
the head gasket.)

Believe me... If you have that problem... It will make itself obvious.
