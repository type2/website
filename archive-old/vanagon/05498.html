Dave Carment comments:

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; Pardon me for intruding, but what makes a syncro great and desireable?

Everything!

&gt; Does it handle better in the snow/rain/mud?

Since all four tires get power, traction is much better in inclement
weather and on crappy roads.  However, if you lock up the brakes, you're
screwed as in every other car.  The trick is to use the transmission to
slow you down, so braking can be distributed to each tire, without locking
up all four tires at once.

&gt; Is fuel economy better or worse?

Since it has to drive two differentials, fuel economy is worse.  But not
much, I think the syncros get around 19mpg.

&gt; Does it ride smoother?

Depends on your driving.  :-)  But the front suspension is a double
wishbone setup, which I think can provide a better ride (if it's built
correctly).  I've never driven a normal Vanagon, so I can't say if there's
much of a difference.

&gt; Does it handle better?

Same as with riding smoother, except you also have your driving forces 
distributed between the front and rear axles, so handling is different
acclerating out of curves.

&gt; Will it go off road?

I've never been, but have been on fairly steep (well, steep enough so that
I couldn't climb in first gear, and had to shift down into Low), muddy, 
and snowy logging roads, and even with balding MXLs on it, have never lost 
traction.  The syncros also have a higher ground clearance than vanilla 
Vanagons.

&gt; Is it expensive to repair?

for the drivetrain, very much so. Very very very very expensive.

&gt; Is it peppier?
&gt; 

Heck no!  Not unless you drop in something bigger.
