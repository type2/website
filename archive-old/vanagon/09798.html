Dan,

Let me tell you another story about my '73 Westy.  Had been driving it
daily for about 6 months with no problems.  Suddenly started running
rough and stranded me.  Would not idle &amp; ran rough.  Though it felt
like fuel starvation so I questioned the fuel pump.  Got a new fuel
pump &amp; installed it in a Wall Mart parking lot.  (there's nothing like
the feeling of your skin burning from gasoline as you are trying to
get a pencil to plug a fuel line.)  Crank it up, same problem.  Next
suspect, clogged fuel lines.  Replaced every inch of fuel line with
new German hose.  Crank it up, same problem.  Didn't want to leave it
in the parking lot overnight so I drove it 3 miles to my ex-girlfriend's
apartment &amp; she drove me home.

The next day I went on to my next suspect, vacuum leak.  Replaced all
intake manifold gaskets.  Crank it up, same problem.  Spray ether all
around manifold, no leak.  Next suspect, carbs need rebuilding.
Rebuilt both carbs. (man do those 1700 stock carbs have enough parts or
what?)  Crank it up same problem.  Next suspect, faulty emmision
equipment.  Take out dual carbs, intake manifolds, air pump, exhaust
gas recirculation, plug extra holes in heads, put in new manifold &amp;
Weber 2 barrel progressive.  Crank it up, same problem.  Gave up.

About a month later picked up 2 barrel Solex, decided to give it a try.
Same problem.  Decided I was not going to let this thing get the best
of me.  By now I am convinced it is a vacuum leak somewhere.  The only
other vacuum line that I haven't replaced is from the carb to the vacuum 
assist brake servo.  Replace with German hose (expensive).  Still no
help.

Well I decided this weekend to put new brakes on the beast and sell it
to get it out of my yard.  Crawled underneath to take a look at the
master cylinder.  FOUND MY VACUUM LEAK.  There is supposed to be about
6&quot; of rubber hose going from the hard plastic brake vacuum line to the
brake servo.  I haven't been able to drive this thing for six months
because I am missing about $0.50 worth of f%cking rubber hose.  

Replaced hose, cranked it up, &amp; it ran fine.

Aren't VWs fun?
