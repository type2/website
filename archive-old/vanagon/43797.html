To Jim and the List,

My comments with regard to forced air circulation were with regard to
cold-weather camping in a tightly sealed bus, allowing incoming outside air
to be tempered, and dealing with the condensation produced.  In warm weather
I just leave everything open, drape a mosquito net around whatever parts of
me I don't want to become red &amp; lumpy.
