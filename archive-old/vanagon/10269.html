Subject: I have some Gas Heater Manuals

I know I'm gonna regret this :-)

I have the following gas heater manuals:
&quot;South Wind Heater Installation Instructions&quot; for Transporter, dated 
7-63, model 8332 (the instructions say they can be used for model 8333 - 
one is 6V, the latter is 12V).  10pp with line drawings and black and 
white photos.

&quot;Volkswagen 1961-1965 Sedan Heater Kit Model 8345-C&quot;  (also 
South Wind) Installation, heater checkout, parts list, graphics as above.  
6pp.

&quot;Supplement No. 2 to Service Manual 05-1163 (Rev. 7-63)&quot; (nope, not the 
one above).  2pp typed info, apparently introducing changes to heater 
8345 B for 64/65 when it became the C.

Misc pages from Eberspacher Heater manual, type BN2, models 20-1215 (6V)
and 20-1216 (12V); these are for 1500-1600cc type IIIs.  Total 9pp,
medium-quality non-original (xerox), with 5pp on description and
operation, 2 pp on installation (missing much of this section - starts
with step 21 :-(, and 2 pp on troubleshooting. 

South Wind Service Manual for 1956-1969 Types I, II, and III.  32 photos 
of installations in all models (bw), 85 line drawings, 50 pp.

OK, folks: I'd like to help out anyone with a heater, but _please_ no 
idle curiosity requests, OK?  Hate to be a curmudgeon.  I'll also be 
happy to pass along info from these manuals if needed.

Please email for details.

BTW got these from a dealer who was having a &quot;garage sale&quot;.
