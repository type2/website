Subject: no start/road trip part 11

I am posting this question again because when my husband left on his road 
trip he unsubscribed and I have tried to subscribe several times with no 
luck.  I would appreciate it if you could reply directly to E-Mail as my 
poor husband is stranded and trying to get home.

I am posting this for my husband who has broken down on a road trip.  
While crusing down the highway, he experienced intermittent loss of 
power.  He pulled over and turned of the engine and when he tried to 
restart, the engine would crank but not start.  He is wondering if this 
is the ECU.  He installed new ignition wires, cap and rotor.  Last week 
he installed a new oxygen sensor to correct a low idle problem.

It is a 89 westie (watercool).

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Phil's wife, Carol
