&gt; California doesn't charge a &quot;sales&quot; tax on used car transactions or new

Use tax is normal.  Anything you mail order and don't pay sales tax you 
are supposed to file and pay use tax on.

For a car in VA once you pay enough sales or use tax to some state(s) to 
equal the original VA sales tax you don't pay anymore.
