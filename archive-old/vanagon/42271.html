&gt; Try a Ford instead. The Chevy 2.8L has weird balance characteristics that
&gt; make it hard to track down vibration problems if you ever have any. I know
&gt; they're smooth in Citations and Celebrity's, but if something goes wrong
&gt; and you start getting vibrations, it's hard to prove they're NOT the
&gt; result of putting the engine where it doesn't belong. The Chevy 2.8L
&gt; is designed to be integrated into a certain drivetrain. Put it anywhere
&gt; else, and you're on your own. The Ford V6's I've heard of, don't have
&gt; this problem.

Steve!  I can't believe I am hearing this!?  Sort of like the Pope 
telling people to visit a protestant church!  &lt;grin&gt;

But I did have a question for you.  Did you ever track down the 
fellow with a similar Chevy conversion that someone posted a message 
about.- Mike White
