Subject: Value of 66 Kombi as scrap


I thought some of you might be interested in the value of a bus as 
scrap metal.  Before I get a hundred FLAMES for this, you should 
know that this vehicle had been rolled and was not saveable.  I 
TOTALLY stripped it and cut out any re-useable metal panels (even 
spent an hour at the scrap yard pulling the transaxel).

Total value of bus, minus transaxel, filled with old (un-useable)
engine cases, pistons &amp; cylinders, mufflers, twisted bumpers, and 
any other piece of metal I could find:

$41.50
