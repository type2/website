Subject: Re: 205/70 or 205/75 tires (correction)

Sami's corrected computation of tire diameters is more what I expected.
When I computed it, I got a projected 6% change by going as far as 
changing from 14 to 15 in. wheels.  

This didn't look worthwhile -- hundreds of dollars to get the rpms at
70mph down from 4000 to 3750.  YMMV; literally.
