Subject: thermostat

If the thermostat fails in an air cooled VW engine, it fully expands,
opening the flaps fully. That engine likes the thermostat and flap system,
because it hastens the warm-up period. I don't think I've ever seen the
flaps themselves seize up. With all that disconnected, however, all will
work fine.
