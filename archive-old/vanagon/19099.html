&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;BTW, the BBB Autoline refused my claim.  The reasoned that my 
&gt;&gt;vanagon was too old and had too many miles ('84 with 102,000
&gt;&gt;miles).  It was worth a try.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Thanks for your input.

Dave:

Do you feel power loss at all from the vanagon? My 83 westy has the same
problem as yours and I noticed that it is fairly weak in power.

I have just started the BBB autoline thing last week. I am still waiting
for any result to come back. My westy has only 61k miles. I have several
repair bills to prove that it had the problem beginning at 30k miles.
I hope the Autoline will make a favorable arbitration for me.

For all list members, believe it or not the gaske problem will attack your
vanagon sooner or later. It's better to start a class action suit now or 
it would be too late to protect us...
