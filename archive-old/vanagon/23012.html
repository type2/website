 then a couple a years later I bought the Old Volks Home, ya know, the company
that invented the &quot;Cal Look&quot; (yeah I know &quot;Cow Look&quot;) Window Rubber and also
made a lot of replacement window rubber for Bugs and Buses as well.  Still have
the company, but I mostly wholesale in quantity to Bus Boys and the competition
these days.

 Jim- Just a thought. I was under the impression that the Old Volks Home went
out of business! I spent several hundred dollars there, for a few Beetles I was
restoring! When the ad stopped appearing in Hot Vw's, I just figgered it was
gone. I'm so ashamed for not actually calling,though.Sorry-your products are
top-notch!
