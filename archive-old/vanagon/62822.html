Subject: the kids made it, Buffalo to CA

Just wanted to let those who might be interested know that my kids, and my
'91 Vanagon (125k) made it from Buffalo, via several SW stops, and are now
camping at one of those &quot;skinny dipping&quot; beaches on Monterey Bay.  They are
in awe of the number of Vanagons on the road in the West and the
friendliness of all you Vanagoons out there.  They hope to be headed up the
coast soon.

Their only problem has been an occasional starting problem which maybe is
the ignition switch.  Sometimes nothing happens when the key is turned even
after several tries.  An hour later it will turn right over.  The next day
it will be fine.  Camping in the mountains they resorted to rolling it down
hill and popping the clutch to start it a few times.  They are looking for
a shop to check it out in the area but if anyone has any thoughts about
this I'd appreciate hearing them.

Also, and please excuse my flat lander ignorance, is it reasonable to
assume that the different elevations they have traveled through would cause
the coolant level in the overflow tank to vary?  They say it has been
between max. and the top of the tank at times.

Thanks,

John Nyquist
