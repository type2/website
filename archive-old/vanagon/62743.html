&lt;&lt;         Lately, every time I have some little thing done, they leave some
 part of the job undone!  This last trip was worse! I had the front brakes
 done and drove the 100+ miles home only to discover that my chrome lugs had
 been switched for black ones! chrome on the back, dingy black on the front.
 There were no other Vanagons in the shop that day so I thinking the swap
 was intentional, and I'm really steamed.  Never the less I call the service
 manager whom I think of as a friend, and suggest that a mistake has been
 made.  He gets a little huffy and sez it could not happen, no other vans in
 the shop that day and Vanagon lugs are unique to Vanagons, must have been
 that way when I brought it in. I know that's not the case.  I washed the
 van two days before: chrome all around.  Now I'm not only angry I'm
 worried!  What if these are not the correct lugs and they were just forced
 in?  I might be in danger of them breaking or coming out because they are
 stripped.  Will I have to buy new hubs?  in the face of the service
 manager's denial do I force the issue over eight lug bolts or just order
 new ones for one of the suppliers on the list and then find a new
 mechanic??
 
 thanks for any advise any of you can offer.

you forgot to say if you had alloy wheels or not.
that makes a difference.
