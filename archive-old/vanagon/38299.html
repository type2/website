Subject: Re: Request for consensus on Head Leaks

James Glenn &lt;jmglenn_at_grove.iup_dot_edu&gt; wrote this about head gasket leaks:
&gt;Lurking, listening, sometimes questioning, the consensus SEEMS to be
&gt;
&gt;1. Try BarsLeaks first. If that doesn't work,
&gt;
&gt;2. Try a very good cleaning plus epoxy and new gaskets ($250+). If that
&gt;doesn't work,
&gt;
&gt;3. Try adding metal (TIG weld) and remachining down. ($?) If that doesn't work,
&gt;
&gt;4.  Bite the bullet, get new heads and gaskets (~1000.)
&gt;
&gt;Would you folks say this is accurate?

No, I wouldn't. My '91 was recently diagnosed with a leaky head gasket. The
consensus I detected was to fix it properly, i.e., put in new gaskets and
replace the heads if necessary. If the mileage is so low that this could
be considered premature failure, then pursue at least partial compensation
from VWoA. The cost for parts for my '91 is $190 per side for the gasket
kit and $560 each for heads, or $1500 for the whole thing. Note that the
new heads are cadmium plated to improve resistance to corrosion.

I received/read just one suggestion to use BarsLeak. Perhaps it would work,
but I always worry about what else will get clogged that shouldn't when using
products like that. I don't know about the other ideas, but I'd hate to go 
through all the work to tear apart and reassemble the engine only to find
something like that didn't end up working...
