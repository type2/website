Subject: Torn Camper top

I have a 74 Westy and the top has some tears in it.  My biggest 
concerns are the tears at the zippers.  The actual zipper has torn, 
not the canvas.  The zipper is white and then ther are two white 
strips along the outside of the zipper. These white strips are then 
sewn to the canvas. The rips have occured inbetween the plastic 
zipper and the seam where the white strips are sewn to the canvas.  
Has anyone had the same problem?  Is it expensive to have top repair 
done? Thanks.
