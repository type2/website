&gt; Hello VWers,
&gt; 
&gt; I would like to get a pressure gauge to measure the gas pressure after 
&gt; the fuel pump and before the pressure regulator on my 80 westy. I think
&gt; all FI vanagons have this T hook up for this measuement on the gas supply

Construct a tester by using  a 0 to 100 psi water pressure guage
available at hardware stores, a 3/16&quot; barbed hose connector with a
female 1/4&quot; pipe thread that fits the guage, and a length of fuel
line to make a guage.

a fuel injection cleaner can be made from this set-up... search the 
'95 archives under 'houg and fuel and injection and cleaner'
