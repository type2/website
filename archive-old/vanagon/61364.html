Subject: TGIF: The Bus Bug's Still Biting Me Now (song parody)

This one was performed by Celine Dion and written by Meatloaf (of &quot;Bat Out
Of Hell 1 &amp; 2&quot; fame.) Since the copyright date on it is so much earlier
than the other songs in the Celine album, I have to wonder if it was
originally meant to go on a Meatloaf album. Anyone got any idea? Anyway,
enjoy. :) It's long and good, just like the rest of Steinman's work.

Original Music  : Jim Steinman

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

There were nights when the bus was so rough
That I could only freeze right there
If I just listened to it
Putter oh so roughly

There were days when the road was so cruel
That the drivers glared at me
And I heard on the CB that I was
Tying up the traffic

I finished trying to put the engine back in the bus
And I can remember where and when and how
And I cherish every memory
The bus and I have made -

But when it breaks down like this
And I fix it like that
I just have to admit that
It's the Bus bug biting me
When I paint it like this
And it shines bright like that
It's so hard to resist and
It's the Bus bug biting me
(It's the Bus bug biting me, it's the Bus bug biting me now)

There were days on the road
And there were star-filled-sky nights
There were things I'd always do again
And yes, they've always seemed right
There were nights of camping pleasure
It was more than any laws allow
Fellow Bussers

If I post this message
And if you reply like that
It started long ago
Yes it's the Bus bug biting me
If I need help 'bout this
And if you sell stuff like that
It's the way things should be
and it's the Bus bug biting me
It's so hard to resist,
that it's the Bus bug biting me
I've been loving it all
And there's that Bus bug biting me now

There were those busy days and sleepless nights
And whenever my bus had to break down
I got out my tools and fixed it
Time and time again

There were trips that just went on for days
Then at last we'd pull up in the campground
And fell asleep exhausted

That bus was history with the accident today
But I'll buy another bus real soon somehow
And I'll not be wasting any of my time on an old one

But if I buy a red bus
And it turns out I like blue
I won't know what to do
But the Bus bug's still biting me
I guess I'll buy green
Yep, the Bus bug's still biting me

If it breaks down like this
And if I fix it like that
I'll be gone with the wind
And the Bus bug's still biting me
(Bus bug's still biting, the Bus bug's still biting me now)

There were moments of gold
And there were wonderful nights
There were things I'd never do again
And some things always seemed right
There were nights of endless cruising
It was more than all laws should allow
Hey VW lovers

When we see shows like this
And we restore like that
We'll always be winners
And the Bus bug's still biting me
When my bus shines like this
And the judge smiles like that
Then we win what we hoped to win
Bus bug's still biting me
The work and the fantasies
Bus bug's still biting me
I can barely recall
But the Bus bug's still biting me now

If you remember all this
If I remember all that
We go on and have fun
While the Bus bug's still biting us
And when I see you my friend
We go cruising in our Dubs
Bus bug's still biting us
The dreams and the fantasies
Bus bug's still biting us
I can barely go on as the Bus bug's still biting me now

(The Bus bug's still biting me now)
And when we dream on like this
(The Bus bug's still biting me now)
And when we make friends like that
(The Bus bug's still biting me now)
We all help out like friends
(And The Bus bug's still biting us now)
And if we ...
