Our 87 makes a similiar noise, on ours it is the cable. It has become a game
somehow to see how long it will last and can we keep it quiet. 

We have lubeed the cable with a product called &quot;Cross-Country&quot;, yes it's
made for bicycle chains. Sometimes this would work. What we have discovered
is that if you gently twist the cable about 1/4 of a turn clockwise ( if you
were looking at the back of the speedo from the cables point of view, the
noise goes away.. But it gets louder if you twist it the other way. You
rotate/twist the plastic clip with everything attached and in place.

There appears to be a replacement cable available that will eliminate the
&quot;counter&quot; and both cables. It's about $45 and we are tempted to just break
down and install it. If anyone has used this cable please let me know. It
you do replace the cable(s) make sure to replace the rubber grommet in the
hub and to reseal the hub/grease cap.
