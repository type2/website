Beauty is in the eye of the beholder...

The higher center of gravity is an illusion, as the weight remains low. 
With the extra weight of the Syncro transmission (AWD), and the camping
equipment, much is which is mounted under the van, it is pretty stable. 
Last year, during a high windstorm, I drove at freeway speeds without
problem and saw three passenger cars blown off the road in about 15
minutes.

The interior is quite different from the Westfalia.  This conversion keeps
the rear Vanagon seat, with armrests, rather than replacing it with a
narrower bench seat.  There is less open interior room, however, because
the refrigerator and stove are built into a cabinet which stands just
inside the sliding door (behind the passenger seat).  We like this, though,
because it allows cooking and access to the refrigerator either from inside
the van or while standing outside.  All of the appliances are, imho, more
useful than those installed in the Westfalia:  larger refrigerator
(although it only runs on 12v and 120v - no propane), much larger auxiliary
battery, serious interior lighting, 13 gal. water tank.  It also has some
stuff not even found on Westies:  holding tank and propane  furnace with
thermostat.  We have done a lot of camping in tandem with Westfalias, and
all agree that the Adventurewagen interior is more convenient.

I do think the Westfalias look a bit nicer, though.  However, I am usually
inside looking out and wouldn't think of trading mine for a Westie.

&gt; John,
&gt; Thanks for the information.  Actually, I thought it looked kinda ugly :)
. 
&gt; I just don't like the look of the Vanagon with the high roof.  I can
stand
&gt; the sight of a Bus with the high roof but it still doesn't sit very well
&gt; with me.  Nothing like dramatically raising the center of gravity to add
&gt; fun to your commute :) .
&gt; 
&gt; What's the interior setup on these like?  Is it more convenient/less
&gt; convenient than the Westy?  What's your take on it?
