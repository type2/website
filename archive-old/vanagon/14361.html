Subject: easy clutch cable replacement

&gt;
&gt;How hard is it to change the cable.  The other day the pin shattered on mine 
&gt;just as I was about to head on a nice 120 mile road trip.  At least my bus had 
&gt;the sense to break down in my driveway.  I've decided to replace the entire 
&gt;cable any pointers would be appreciated.

Brad,

Changing the clutch cable is dead easy (heck, I even did it!).
When you go to the friendly VW dealer to buy the new one, note
that the package should contain a *new* flex-tube.  Next, buy
some good grease.  

Approach in the actual cable change varies.  But the method I
use is failsafe.  First hack off the end of the cable by the 
pedal assembly and tie a strong string at the end.  Draw the
cable out at the tranmission end.  You should be left with 
string running the length of the cable run  Almost done!  Now
tie the string to the end that will end up at the tranny.  Go
to the rear of the bus and pull and push and grease, grease,
grease!  The more grease you can get in with the cable the better.
Use the new flex-rod (new because I found for some reason that I
couldn't set the proper deflection with the old one &lt;shrug&gt;) and 
then attach the cable at the front/rear and adjust.  --Ralf
