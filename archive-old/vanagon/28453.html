Subject: Take it easy, guys

&gt;&gt;The best part of you (excess deleted)

        Gentlemen, gentlemen. If we find it truly neccessary to make such
derogatory remarks to one another, can we at least do it privately? While I
choose to side with no-one, I am certainly uninterested in observing a
flame war. Why waste the bandwidth charring all 400 of us? (aplogies to
Joel/Gerry if I got the rough estimate wrong) Really, it seems easy enough
to flame each other privately, so's the rest of us can continue our day
without setting off the fire alarm.

Peace,
