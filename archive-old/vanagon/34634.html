&gt; Dear VWers,
&gt;
&gt; In my previous email I mentioned about the damaged nose panel on my 80 Westy.
&gt; I got a few replies that were very helpful. Appreciate it.
&gt;
&gt; I managed to pull the nose sheet metal panel instead of replacing it, for
&gt;now.
&gt; It doesn't look perfect, but it has a character. The chassis as well as the
&gt; inner panels were in perfect shape.
&gt;
&gt; Now I am ready to do welding. I looked into renting an arc stick welder. The
&gt; guy says, stick wleding on car sheet metals is really difficult. He is
&gt; talking about some other kinds (Mig or Heli-arc) that I don't have any
&gt; experience with. Anybody knows what these things are?

&gt; Here is my questions:
&gt;
&gt; 1- Has anybody done stick welding on VW's. If yes what current would you
&gt;    use? I think Herb mentioned an 18 Gauge stick welding. (Thanks Herb)
&gt;    At what current though?
&gt;
&gt; 2- I've found this welder at Orchard Supply for $200. It goes up to
&gt;    225 Amps.  It is a single phase 220 V AC. I can hook it up to my dryer
&gt;    outlet. Would this do the job?
&gt;
&gt; 3- If with stick welding you can easily melt the metal, then how about
&gt;    gas welding?

You'd be much better off with an automatic-feed wire welder.  More
expensive, but rentable.  I've done a lot of welding with a smoke wrench,
cause that's what I have, and it's a PAIN to weld sheet metal, because the
lower operating temperatures for oxy-acetylene than spark wrenches causes
sheet metal to warp.  You can compensate for this by &quot;hammer welding&quot; but
that requires a lot of practice (I'm pretty good with the 'wrench, but
still haven't gotten THAT down too well).


&gt;
&gt; BTW, pulling the sheet metal was a lot of fun. I used a turn-buckel hooked
&gt; to a steel cable. Worked very well.

I used a 2-ton bottle jack and a bunch of 4x4 chunks of wood to push the
passenger side doorway back to shape on my 60 Singlecab.  Works well, but
you have to plan in advance and watch the dimensions.

60 Singlecab (welded in a new top section for this, plus filled holes cut
for antennas and similar stupid add-ons)

butchered!)
