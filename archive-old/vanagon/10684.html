Howdy,

	First of all, I wanted to tell everyone that I've been driving my bus in
the rain, and the sunroof isn't leaking!  Yahoo!  I'dbeen worried about it...

	Anyway, I saw a guy I know at the FLAPS, with a new bus, an early '67.
He was telling me how he paid $1500.  While I'm standing there, he's 
making arrangements to sell it to soemone else for $3000!  Sheesh!  And
he'd only had it for a couple of days!
