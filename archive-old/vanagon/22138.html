 Subject: 1977 VW WESTFALIA - MINT

  	I have a 1977 VW Westfalia pop-up camper in mint condition.
  This vehicle has been garage kept since 1977, has a sink, ice box,and
  sleeps 4.  Canvas and interior is in excellent shape. Paint looks like
  knew. This is a once in a lifetime find! I also have most of the records.
  If you are interested perhaps I could send a video.
  Asking $4,500		86,000 miles
  This would be great for &quot;dead heads&quot; or fisherman.
  If your interested please e-mail at:

  Thanks,
  Scott
