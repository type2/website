Subject: Stalling '87 Syncro

I have a stalling problem that has to due with loss of spark.  I have
replaced the coil and the problem remains.  I have been told the problem lies
in the &quot;ECM&quot; or &quot;ECU&quot; (the same thing I am told).  This part has a $700.00
price tag.  Any suggestions on other possible problems?  The fuel system is
in good shape and the van runs like a champ.
