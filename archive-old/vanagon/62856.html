Subject: FS 87 westy in NH

FOR SALE in classified pages of today's (Lebanon, N.H.) Valley News:

1987 VW Westphalia (sic) camper, PS, PB, PW, A/C, recent new engine,
clutch, paint, tires, exhaust, brakes. $6,000/bo. (603) 632-5508.

The number is in Enfield, N.H., near the New Hampshire/Vermont border at
the intersection of I-89 and I-91. That's 2.5 hours north of Boston and
Hartford, Conn. and 1.5 hours southeast of Burlington, Vt.

I can't be much help on assessing the mechanical end, but I'd be willing to
test drive it, check the condition of the body/interior, and ask the kind
of questions this list has taught me need asking if anyone would like.

I've got a clean 84 with 72,000 miles on it or I'd be going to look at this
one for myself.

Bruce
