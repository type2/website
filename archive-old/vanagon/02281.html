&gt; &gt; There's only one reason they replaced the air-cooled engines.  The stricter
&gt; &gt; emission requirements forced them to.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; If this were true then how is it possible for these engines to pass 
&gt; today's CA smog tests? 

The older engines are only required to pass emissions base on the
requirements for that year.  The later the model the more stringent
the requirement.


&gt;Also, Europe (the bulk of the market)  never had 
&gt; any of these tough emission requirements until the late 80's? 

True, but the auto industry new that what the trend was.  Maybe
I'm wrong, but the temperature of the engine has to be maintained
carefully in order to meet the more recent emission standards.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; -- &gt;Isn't it more of a case that VW had tried to get away with putting 
&gt; an old engine (carry over from bus) in a new much heavier body and found 
&gt; that the hp was simply not up to snuff? -DC

I wouldn't rule that out completely.  It certainly doesn't hurt.
