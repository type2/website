&gt;  I have a 1987 Syncro Westie.  When the heat turned on, heat comes out of
the
&gt;  &gt; vents up front.  If I open the fresh air vents (the ones that can be
&gt;  &gt; redirected) on either side, Cold outside air comes in.  My parents-inlaw
&gt;  &gt;have a 1990 Multivan and when their fresh air vents open and the heat is
on,
&gt;  &gt;warm/hot air comes out.  Whay gives???  Did VW get smarter and add more 
&gt;  &gt;vents for heat to keep the windows clear.  I would be interested in
hearing if 
&gt;  &gt;others have noticed this.  Is there a valve that I am missing in order to
redirect 
&gt;  &gt;heat to these vents.  I checked all of the piping but have found
nothing...  
 
&gt;  I just discovered lately that these vent on my '88 seems to blow 
&gt;  either fresh cold air, or heated air depending on valve position, and 
&gt;  whether heat is directed to dash from the heater panel.

This is exactly right.  The heated air from the dash vents was one of the
enhancements in the 1988 model year vans.
