&lt;&lt; Do you have an oil pressure gauge? The main problem I've seen with 
 10w30 on all my VWs is low(er) oil pressure, not overheating. Does 
 anyone know if the type4 AFC engines use the same oil pump as a w/b 
 engine? From some comments on early bus oil pressures, it seems that 
 the a/c engines get better oil pressure. If the pumps are different, 
 is it possible to exchange them?
  &gt;&gt;
Beleive it or not, the WB have more oil pressure problems due to the oil
getting hotter due to ther running at high RPMS longer and putting more load
on the bearings,(the extra horsepower).  The Waterboxer actually uses the
same oil pump as a 71 up type 1.  Using oversize oil pumps will create
problems as the relief valves can not handle the extra volume at cold temps.
 This will oil filters to blow off etc.  Use the proper oil and keep at the
proper levels and all should be well.  When buying rebuilt engines, find out
if the case has been align bored or at least if the bearing journals are
measured.  High mileage cases will have oil pressure problems just like type
1's.
