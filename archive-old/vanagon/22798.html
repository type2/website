&lt;These characters have been transformed into a printable form.&gt;

Good Morning,
For WinNT:
This subkey is used to define the appearance and behavior of the Mail =

program. This is the Registry path for this subkey:
  HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Mail\Microsoft Mail
StripGatewayHeaders     REG_SZ      0 or 1
If this entry is 1, message header text that appears above the dashed =

line is stripped from PC Mail messages that arrive via a gateway. Set =

this value to 0 if you want to see the extended information supplied by =

the gateways, which typically includes items such as message =

identifiers specific to the foreign mail system.
Message header text supplied by native PC Mail clients is always =

stripped. Only the PC Mail transport supports this entry.
Default:  1 (That is, you don=92t see gateway information.)
BTW we do use the MS Mail Gateway&lt;G&gt;
Feel free to visit my homepage at www.microsoft_dot_com/technet. this has =

links to our product support database that you may find of use.
