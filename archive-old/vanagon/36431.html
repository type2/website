We towed one of our busses from Lost Hills near Bakersfield
over the Grapevine all the way to San Diego back in 1985
using the normal bug towbar a fat pipe and some big U bolts
to attach the pipe to the front bumper mounts.

It was safe enough.

&gt; &gt; I towed one of clara's buses either to of from Santa Cruz over the HWY 17
&gt; &gt; Hill. I think we got a bug towing attachment and attached it with U-bolts in
&gt; &gt; a non standard way. One of the U-bolts came undone &amp; I remember fixing it in
&gt; &gt; a shopping centre parking lot.
&gt; &gt; So the bug unit can attach to the towing eyes with U-bolts.

&gt; &gt; Isn't that right clara

&gt; &gt; .-This doesn't sound very safe to me. I have always been in favor of the 
&gt; TOW DOLLEY method, I have seen some very strange ways of towing 
&gt; cars&amp;buses but it is much safer to do it correctly than not.  Maybe 
&gt; there is a reason why a bus tow bar is made of unobtainium?
&gt; 
&gt;    I know HWY 17 &amp; you are a brave soul to have done that, I'm just 
&gt; trying to figure out which parking lot!
