Subject: '70 Clutch Cable Clevis Pin failed!

	Aha!
	RMMW advises us to buy a complete kit for $29/30 rather than
just the clutch cable for $6.25... well guess what? My '70's 'broken 
clutch  cable', when I finally got down into it to fix it, turned out 
to have been  a broken clevis pin ($2.25 separately) and grotesquely 
worn lever arm ($ 15.75)- can you say Total Lubrication Failure? 
The hole that the clevis pin goes through was elongated to a length
of over twice its original diameter- it was near to worn through
when the pin itself failed.

	The cable itself appears to be in fine shape.

	So tomorrow morning I'll order a new arm and clevis pin. And
a spare clevis pin because the arm could be reversed, two nuts used
in place of the wing nut, but without the clevis pin, life would be
ugly. A bolt-and-nut would wear both the lever and the end of the
clutch cable, and you've have to have 'em with you in the first place.

	I suppose I could be really conservative and replace the
tube at the back and get a new wing nut for a spare, eg get a complete
kit now. I think I'll leave the tube for the time being, as a study, but 
definately pickup a wing-nut from pick-and-pull next time I'm there. 

	For those making a long trip, if you can't remember whether
you've lubricated the clutch cable clevis pin, take the 10 minutes
to get in there and check it, the throttle cable, parking brake cables
and master-cylinder.

	And don't forget the the little plastic nipple back at the
tranny end that keeps dust out of the clutch cable tube. I suspect there
should be one of those at each end of the rigid tube, actually... Hmm.
we'll see how ambitious I get. take it all apart, swab-out the tube
clean and lube the cable and re-install with dust nipples at
both ends? Do I HAVE to?? :(

	Might just.

	Happy Motoring!
	Bill
