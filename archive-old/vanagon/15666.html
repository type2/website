Subject: 71' bus manuals

good manuals for stock VWs include the classic Idiot manual, the Haynes
manual (UK) and the Bentley manuals, which are the official VW thing. As
always, it's good to have all to compare (they do disagree). The Bentley and
Haynes are available exclusively for the bus, and both contain essential
pictures and photos. The Idiot guide doesn't have many photos but is written
in an amazingly efficient and articulate and casual style. Real title:&quot;How to
Keep Your VW alive...a manual for the compleat idiot&quot; John Muir Publications)
