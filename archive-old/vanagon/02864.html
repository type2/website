&gt;junkyard axle, two needed to be pulled off with the heavy duty puller, but
&gt;the other two just slid off by hand. Which is right?  Does it matter?

after seeing vw get rid of that massive C-clip on the ends, and having had
a brand new cv-joint on a brand new bus drop off the axle into my hand, i
have concluded that it doesn't matter. i'm a bit surprised that the
tolerances could be that wide, but it doesn't seem to care.

the 71 bus cv-joints were very tight on the axles. the 80 bus was so-so: you
could pull them off easily, but they didn't slide off. the 86 bus and the
88 bus and the 91 bus all mostly slide off easily. but not ALL joints on the
same bus acted the same way. that's why i think it is just a very large
acceptable tolerance in manufacturing ... like plus/minus 1mm or some such.
