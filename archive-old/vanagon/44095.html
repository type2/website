Subject: VW '78 2ltr experts, figure this?

Hi all

calling all VW experts, what do you think?

My Westfalia had a problem with the fan in that the three bolts fastening it to the 
crankshaft sheared off. At the time of the accident it was a dark January evening so I tried 
to manoeuvre the fan out of the way so as to get to a petrol station just up the road. 
However about 20 feet onward another lound bang again forced me to stop. On trying to start 
the vw it was just as if the starter motor was not working. 

Having posted messages to this mailing list previously it was evident that I had to drop the 
engine. Here is what we found:

Having removed the starter motor you could turn the flywheel by hand! On removal of the 
engine we found that all five bolts that hold the flywheel to the crank had sheared. We then 
proceeded to see if the engine could turn by hand... it could. However when you turn it 
there is some play, not just back and forth but as you turn the engine. The crankshaft will 
not move in and out by just pulling and pushing it, but as you turn it. I wondered if this 
was a design feature!? 

Here is a theory. The fan worked loose, thus shearing the bolts. Then with me positioning it 
in a manner that caused it to catch and jam the engine, the five bolts on the flywheel 
sheared. Presumably this is the week link along the motor and gearbox.

If this theory is correct, I want to know if I can just replace all the sheared bolts. Is 
the play in the crankshaft right? If not any ideas as to why it is doing this. Should I 
check certain things before putting the engine back together?

Thanks for any help.
Ian
