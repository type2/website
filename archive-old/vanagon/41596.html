Hi There,

Does anyone have a good source for rubber Vanagon Floor Mats?  I checked the 
Parts Place Catalog and there are some for $39.99 US  === ~$65.00 after 
conversion/duty/GST and shipping.  Ouch....  There are some up here that are 
$100.00 CAN!!!!  ($20.00 floor mats with and $80.00 VW logo!)

I can always try and &quot;Macgyver&quot; some FLAPS ones, but I would rather not.

Thanks
Tony
