&gt; &gt;Hi all,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I'm about to rebuild the carburator of my '73 bus and was wondering
&gt; &gt;what you guys recommend for a thorough cleaning. Specifically, I want
&gt; &gt;clear  all passages with compressed air, but can not do this with the
&gt; &gt;normal air hoses provided in gas stations 

You can buy cans of compressed air at camera shops.  I've even
seen refillable aerosol cans, which have a regular tire valve
to pressurize them; take that to the gas station!  I'm pretty
sure Harbor Freight has them.
