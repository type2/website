Subject: Handicapped EV Siting

I was at the local drug store today and saw a white EV that was equiped with
a wheel chair lift in the sliding door.  I seem to recall that VWoA had
(probably still does) a program where you could order &amp; finance a handicapped
package for your new EV.  This one looked very professionally installed.
