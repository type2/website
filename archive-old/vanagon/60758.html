Subject: Problems that need solutions...

I own a 1986 GL Syncro, manual trans, AC, PS, calif. emmisions w/108,000
miles. 

Problem #1... I like to change ALL fluids in a used van that I buy. It
gives me a little piece of mind.  Everything is done except the
transmission and differential.  I found the plugs on the differential
and the drain plug on the transmission, but I can't find a fill plug.
The differential lockout valve seems to be located in the position one
would find a fill plug on a manual trans..  Do I have to remove this
valve to fill it or is it somewhere else?

Problem #2...  The fuel tank keeps pressurizing on me.  Bently doesn't
give much in the way of operation theory, however, after studying their
diagrams, I assume that this is a closed vent system.  If this is true,
I have to assume that there is a blockage somewhere.  There is a vent
valve on top of the tank and a charcoal filter that might be the cause.
If the problem is in the vent valve, do I have to drop the tank in order
to change it?  In a recent posting on the list, there was a
recomendation that all of the vent hoses should be changed from time to
time.  In my case I agree since I know very little of the past history
of this van but all of the hoses are on the top of the tank.  Is there a
way to change these without dropping the tank?  Also, would a clogged
charcoal filter cause the tank to pressurize?

 In the mean time I have made a temporary fix by drilling a #40 hole in
the backing plate and seal on the gas cap.  This allows the tank to vent
to atmosphere just like my old beat up Ford pickup. 

I want to get all of my ducks lined up before I start tearing things
apart.  Any parts that have to be ordered have to come from the lower
48.  Camelback VW has been real good to me in the past but it doesn't
come cheap.  

Up here in Alaska, the summers are to short to have my main mode of
family transportation down for long.  I would appreciate any information
and/or recommendations . You can E-mail me directly or reply to the
list.  I read the it every evening.

Thanks in advance for a great source of information and comraderie.
