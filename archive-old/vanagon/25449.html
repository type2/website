&gt;1. How do you get &quot;sports stripes&quot; off without taking the paint with them?

3M (and probably other brands) makes a solvent specifically for this type of
job.  The 3M item is called &quot;General Purpose Adhesive Remover&quot; I think.  I
bought a quart of it a while back for removing some stripes from my Vanagon.
 It worked o.k. on the stripes with no apparent problems for the paint.  It
did require quite a bit of elbow grease though.  Older paint might not hold
up as well.  I bought mine at a local automotive paint supply store.
