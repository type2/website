Subject: Can transmisson be rebuilt?

I am looking at a 1959 bus.  The owner says that it has a bad transmission.
I talked to a local VW mechanic and he says to make sure that it is the
transmission and not the gear boxes out near the wheels.  He says that
neither the transmission nor the gear boxes can be rebuilt.  He says that a
transmisson can be found if it is not a split case, but the gear boxes can
not be found.  He told me that the gear boxes are not made by anyone.  He
has a couple of bus transmissions on hand with bad gear boxes and says they
are junk.  Is all this true?  I just find it hard to believe that no one
rebuilds these things.
