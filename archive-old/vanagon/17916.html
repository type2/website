&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;You want to know what the real cost of owning a EuroVan is....
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I blame it on Joel.....being of Polish Ancestry...I figured in order
&gt;&gt;for me to get on the &quot;vanagon&quot; list I had to have a vanagon...
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;So as I figgure it Joel and Gerry owe me $21k for the price of admission
&gt;&gt;to this list, and Joel, and others owe me punitive damages in the amount
&gt;&gt;of $1,000,000 for the pain and suffering of having to read about
&gt;&gt;wannabusses, to deal with the Friday Follies...the late, lamented
&gt;&gt;Wil Self's ascii doodles...etc...
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Pay up! or I'm gonna git you sucka!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Ric
&gt;&gt;

&quot;But that's impossible&quot; at $21k...
