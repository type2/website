Subject: Re: Vanagons: accelerator cable

&gt;cable can be identified by a white plastic sheath enclosing the length
&gt;of the braided cable.  This sheath protects the braided cable from
&gt;outside elements.

&lt;snip&gt;

&gt;note: that VIN is a 1988 model vanagon, so all pre-1988's have the old style
&gt;cable. 1989 and later have the new one. 1988's will have to check their VIN.

&lt;ditto&gt;

I have this cable on my '85, which I owned since '86 1/2, so it must be OE. 
Perhap the true north strong and free (and frozen) got these goodies early?
They still bung up. The white tube is translucent enough to tell when its 
been reamed clean BTW.
