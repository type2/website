Subject: More Website Pictures of V6anagon


Well, I've finally gotten some pictures scanned, of the '80 V6anagon and
its engine and radiator installation. The URL is:

   http://www.lookup_dot_com/homepages/76242/home.html

I'll someday make the page prettier, with flowing script, links to
other peoples' pages, etc. But for now, there's the raw stuff!

Also stuck in, some more pictures of the '71 bus I just sold (R.I.P.),
and the '66 Mustang Coupevertible, before and after its hardtop was
cut off.

Enjoy!

BTW, please let me know if these newer pictures, seem kind of dark to you.
They seem too dark to me, but that might just be my monitor. If these
are truly too dark to everyone, I can use Paint Shop Pro 3 to lighten
them up. Works for me!
