Subject:       checking fuel system pressure

Hot suggestion for a rich engine.  check it out.

Here's how to make an easy guage:
1.  get a pressure guage from the plumbing store 0-80 psi is fine.  
While you're there pick up a brass fitting that screws onto the 
bottom of the guage and has a 1/4 inch hose barb on the other.

2.  get 3 feet of 1/4 fuel line and 2 hose clamps for same

3.  use teflon tape and attach the hose barb to the guage, add the 
hose and hose clamp.  you're done.


To check system pressure, DEPRESSURIZE the system first by pulling 
off a wire on the fuel pump and letting the engine die.  then remove 
the tiny bolt sticking up out of that in-line &quot;T&quot; connector just to 
the right of the distributor.  Some gas will spray out so have a rag 
handy.  Hook up your guage with a hose clamp 
onto that T and you're ready to go.

The fuel pressure should INCREASE when the vacuum line is pulled off 
the regulator, check the book for specs but it is like 29 psi with 
the vacuum line attached and 35 psi with it off.
