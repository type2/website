&gt; 83 westy diesel &quot;radhaus&quot;My '82 Westy Diesel was rebuilt about 10k ago.  Smoke is relatively 
benign except on cold start, and at full acceleration.  It never has the 
opacity of a Big rig diesel.  However, If I'm driving in the mountains 
at 4-6,000 feet of elevation, it smokes MUCH more.  If you have 
considerable problem with smoking, a good diesel shop could adjust your 
injector pump stroke to inject a bit less fuel.
