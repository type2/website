&gt; you CANNOT do it alone. windshield takes two on outside, one on inside. and
Also try WD-40, a little water in Dawn (or another dishwashing liquid.), or
used oil, if you're really cheap. But that don't work so good.
You CANNOT do it by yourself!!!!!! This is the point that needs to be 
stressed, IMHO. I cracked both of my windshields in my `66 before I
unstubborned myself. And they're SMALL, comparatively!!!!
