Subject: Got the filter...and a leak somewhere

hey now,

i found the filter i needed at the local VW parts place..Thof. (don't you love
it when a buisiness knows they are the only ones in town that have the parts
you need and treat you like shit?) anyways....picked up a new fuel filter and
some fuel line also.

i took off the old fuel line...it looked okay but figured i'd change it just
in case. the old fuel filter was nasty..rust colored and such. so i put all the
new fuel line on and the fuel filter...

then i took out the old air filter and sprayed the carb cleaner on the outer
parts of the carb.....then let things dry off and made sure there were no gas
leaks. after awhile i started the engine.....fire extinguisher in hand. i
sprayed some more carb cleaner in the intake valve...varrooom varroooom. i put
the carb back togther and let the old van warm up.

drove around...was amazed at how better she was idling and the increase in
power. much much better. checked for fuel leaks, smell of gas, etc.....nada.
got back home and looked again at the engine compartment. this engine never
leaks and is very silvery shiny. on the right hand side as you look down i
saw a small puddle of black oily looking gunk...not thick like oil, but more
watery...and it doesn't smell like gas. couldn't find any obvious leaks. oil
level was fine. i figured it was just some of the carb stuff that accumulated
on the engine. i cleaned it up and made my engine all shiny again.

i drove around some more and when i got back it was dark, so what i did was
put a piece of newspaper under the back end, specifically under the fuel
pump/hose and then engine to check for leaks. there were none this morning.
i hopped in and cruised to work. check for leaks and guess what? there was that
stuff again! about 1/4&quot; deep and 3&quot; long...collects right where the dip is
on the engine between the carb and the frame.

i don't think it's gas...i've tripple checked the fuel lines from the filter
to the carb and from the filter to the pump. the arrow points towards the carb
because it's above the fuel pump right? i added maybe 2 extra inches to the
hose then the priveous one had...is that a problem?

considering that this engine has never leaked i'm concentrating on looking at
two possibilities:

a) i knocked something loose while cleaning the carb/changing fuel filter.
b) increased air pressure from the clean filter/carb is blowing this stuff
outta the crankcase breater box. it looked kinda oily (oilyer) than i remember
when i looked at it yesterday. didn't have time this morning to really inspect
it.
c) blown seal on the oil cooler? (kinda doubt this one, but who knows)

any ideas? suggestions? everyone i've shown the engine to has been impressed
at how clean and shiny it is...i'd like to keep it that way. no leaks before
i did the carb/fuel line work...maybe i screwed something up.

thanks once again.
