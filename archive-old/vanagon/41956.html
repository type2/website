Subject: Question: Polishing Glass

I know there are compounds that are sold specifically to remove scratches 
from glass, but in my ever-thrifty quest for solutions, I wonder if 
polishing or rubbing compound would lead to the same result. Any 
experiences, thoughts, rebuke? Thanks! Joe ('71 campmobile) - on digest.
