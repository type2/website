ALERT FOR EUROVAN OWNERS

I am the owner of a 1993 Eurovan MV (weekender) that experienced severe
engine overheating requiring complete engine replacement ($5000). The only
alert I had of trouble was the blinking of the 'temperature indicator&quot;
(idiot light) on the instrument panel. The temperature gauge read only
slightly above normal. The engine was destroyed within 1-2 minutes of the
onset of the blinking light.

The problem was a factory defect in the connection of the hose feeding the
heater core(exchanger). The hose part # is: 701819 and can be located right
of center,behind the engine, against the firewall where it is beside the
return hose from the core.

The defect is quite simple. The feeder hose is secured by a &quot;pinch&quot; clamp
that was not placed over the &quot;collar&quot; of the heater core feed-in line. I
was able to go 74,000 miles before this hose came loose and resulted in
catastrophic damage.

VW does not, at this time ,acknowledge the defect. To save yourself engine
damage have this hose checked immediately. If your temperature indicator
blinks  - PULL OVER AND STOP THE ENGINE ASAP.

You can help me convince VW of this defect. If, upon inspection, you find
that your hoses have been incorrectly joined,  please notify me as I am
coordinating an effort to inform VW- and attempt to recover my loss.

Thank you
