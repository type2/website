Subject: new vanagon engine

Dear Vanagoners,

        This is a follow up to the &quot;dead vanagon engine&quot; post in April.
Recap: 91 Vanagon Carat (&quot;weekender&quot; package) blew engine at 80K. Local
dealer (Mobile AL) replaced engine March 95 ($3800.) Several major problems
over the next year, culminating in another complete engine failure, April
96; oil and coolant all over the highway. Local dealer says, &quot;tough.&quot; 
        Towed vehicle to Pensacola dealer (Pete Moore Imports) for a &quot;second
opinion&quot; and &quot;autopsy.&quot; Upon review of the records, the service manager,
after discussing situation with VWoA, offered me another new engine,
compliments of the factory, if I'd pay for new cooling lines. I took it. I
never had my curiosity satisfied by an engine dissection, but they said the
factory wanted the dead engine back, and besides, with lawsuit out of the
question, I didn't NEED the info. 
        They didn't say it in so many words, but my first dealer done me
wrong. Of course I get low points for ignorance and naivete, since remedied
by this list. The factory was doing this &quot;...not to bail out Dean's, but to
keep my good will as a customer.&quot; Fine. Either they're great guys or they
thought I had a pretty strong case.
        All new hoses: $1222 parts, $325 labor. The factory &quot;paid&quot; $2417
parts, $367 labor. The actual engine (&quot;long block&quot;) VWN 025 100 031 EX
*ngine-MV   $1833.00. 
        Plan to drive it regularly around town, replace coolant yearly, use
the 20-50W oil, tidy it up and sell it if I can get anywhere near wholesale
value for it. 
        One question: do the heads need to be retorqued at 1000 miles?
