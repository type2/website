Subject: body parts


Someone asked some days ago about a source for early model bus body
panels. Well, this might? help - I have a slim catalogue from Bow-Wow
parts here in Victoria, (I think there is a Seattle outlet too), for Van
Wezel International. They list replacement panels, sills, pans etc for VW
beetles, rabbits, sciroccos, golf, jetta, T-2 from '68, and vanagons. They
might be able to help with earlier buses, unfortunately there is no Dutch
address, maybe Bow-Wow can help? (head office Vancouver, fax 604-594-8354, ph
604-594-4300).
