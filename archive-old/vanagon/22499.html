Subject: Need Eurovan Info, Please Help.

First, to all who responded to &quot;Should I Buy&quot;, your responses are greatly 
appreciated and very helpful.

Update, I did not buy that '93 GL, at least not yet, I'm trying to let 
the dealer simmer for a while.  So far I've only been able to get them 
down to 15,600 from 15,900, kinda irritating.

However, I did find a '93 MV about two hours away.  I went and checked it 
out last night.  It has 36,000 miles, is in generally good shape and they 
are asking $17,000 for it.  I haven't been able to contact the original 
owner yet and the dealers story is that a 50 year old woman owned it and 
traded it in on a Passat.

Here is my problem, I have only driven three Eurovans, this being the 
third.  One was a stick and the others were automatics.  The long and the 
short being that I do not have a feel for these things yet.

Question #1 --
I don't remember how the other Eurovan with an automatic that I drove 
felt, but the MV that I'm looking at (and really, really want) seemed 
kind indecisive about which gear to use, and jerked quite a bit when 
changing gears.  Could this be the reason this MV is $1,500 cheaper than 
any others I have found? Is this anything normal or characteristic?

Question #2 --
Regarding the dual A/C, the air in this one felt great in the front just 
like the other ones, but the rear A/C blower seemed kind weak.  Here 
again I don't really have anything to compare it to.  Can the rear air be 
diverted to other vents, reducing the flow?  Could it be all six roof 
vents being open, that makes it seem like it dosen't blow that hard?
What are your experiences with this?

Question #3 --
What temperature do the engines usually run at?  Most the time while 
driving the MV it hovered about the half-way mark. Then I let it idle for 
about ten minutes in hot FL with both A/C's running.  The temp rose to 
about 3/4 and stabilized.  Is that about right?

Question #4 --
Has anybody had any CV Joint experiences with these things are they more 
difficult to change that Vanagon CV's?

Question #5 --
I really want to pull a 19 foot boat with this thing, does anybody have 
any towing experiences with the EV, and is a stick or automatic better?

Any responses would be greatly appreciated.  I really don't want to pour 
$17,00 down the drain.

Thanks,
Trace Choulat
