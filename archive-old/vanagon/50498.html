&gt; Can you see the screws from the outside, and where is the &quot;VW&quot; logo on the
&gt; speakers?  It's just that I've never seen any front Vanagon speakers that had
&gt; exposed screws.  The speaker grills are plastic, right?

Yes, the screws are exposed black round head philips, and the grill 
is plastic molded with the speaker itself (not removable from 
speaker). They bear the part # 251 035 411c, on a VW Germany sticker, 
and also say Blaupunkt in the magnet casting. The same ones are used 
in the rear. This is a Canadian Westy - maybe that's the difference?
