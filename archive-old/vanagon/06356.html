Yes, dogs.  Take lots of them.  If you can get around the smell they 
should keep you nice and toasty.  Watch out for those three dog 
nights!  As for me, I camp during the winter in my apt.  Like my dad 
said, I have to work in the cold, why the hell would I want to play in
it?  :)  But seriously, there was a huge discussion on this a month or
more ago.  I would check the FAQ.  Anyone have the address?
