Subject: EV manuals

Well, I finally called back the dealer that was supposed to order that EV
factory manual for me (I don't have the part number now, but it was the
1995 General Engine, Ignition &amp; Fuel manual that Trace said he got.)
Anyway, dealer says that the part number has been &quot;superseded&quot; by VW and
there are none available in either USA or Canada. But that there is no
successor to it.
Does this mean they pulled it off the market because the Bentley is finally
in the works?

Anyway, the parts guy suggests I talk to the service guy to see if I can
convince him to order me a 1995 microfiche. When I do, he says that there
is no microfiche for that year - it's all in manuals! Rather than give me
the part numbers for these manuals (the title I mentioned above is one he
said sounded like the same thing) he suggested I call VW Customer
Assistance number (1-800-822-8987). I haven't bothered yet, I'll probably
try tomorrow but I'm not very hopeful there.

On a related note, he DID give me a part number for the Winnebago Factory
Training Manual for the 95 Camper - 701674/18/000. This covers all the
stuff they added and *sounds* extremely useful for things like that the
levels panel readout problem mentioned earlier. I'm not sure if I can order
that directly from Winnebago or if it has to come through VW. I'll probably
try Winnebago as soon as I can dig up a phone number for them.

If anyone else manages to find a copy of these manuals available, please
let me know.
