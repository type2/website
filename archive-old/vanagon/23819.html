Sorry to waste the BW here but I can't reach Tim Smith at the return address of
his mail message (smitht_at_jupiter.sun.esd.unb_dot_ca). Tim, yes I posted the sight-
ing of a cherry '84 in a Rockville junkyard in this list a few weeks ago. Do
you still need the name of the place?  If so, reply to schlaile_at_lfs.loral_dot_com
