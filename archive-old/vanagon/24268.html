Yes, it is true.  Last night we had to make an emergency trip to Sears
for a new battery.  I bought the biggest mother they had that would 
fit in there.  That is one big battery.  I ran through a tuneup one 
more time.  Checked the timing, gap, valves and all the wires once 
more.  After turning the engine over a few times with the coil 
unplugged the oil light went out.  I still don't have an operational 
throttle cable so I had to have Heather hit the starter while I ran 
the throttle.  It started first hit!  I ran it for a couple of minutes
and shut it down.  It smelled real wierd.  All that paint and gaskets 
and stuff.  Also, oil was just about pouring out of the right hand 
valve cover.  I thought that bail seemed a little soft.  I robbed a 
good one from the old motor.  Also, about one minute into the run it 
started putting out a little white smoke.  Very little.  I am not 
going to worry about it right now.  I assume it was the thin oil 
burning off.  Somebody tell me if I should be nervous about this.  The
engine had trace amounts of break-in fluid or something in there.  It 
was kind of clear red.  It turned the oil a funny brown color.  I only
found the tinest of metal flake in the oil I drained.  Again, I think 
this is normal.  I had the ears on full alert when it roared to life 
and it sounded very solid.  It sounded beautiful.  I didn't know a vw 
engine could sound so good.  Not a knock or rattle or ping anywhere.  
Tonight I am running in the new throttle cable and then it is off for 
the first drive.  It seems strange.  I was coming to think of my bus 
as something that sat in my garage and grew spider webs.  Jim
