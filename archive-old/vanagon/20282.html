Michael, if you're lucky ... you may only have to regret asking about the generator. ;(

I have a generator (one of the supposedly quite ones). Last year it was a big hit with 
my family ... going out and doing things ... and having enough power to play with the 
'toys', what ever they were.

I mentioned that, here on the list and, after a couple dozen or so messages, I was glad 
to let the subject die!  I can get a few of them to you if you have an interest about the 
opinions from the list.
