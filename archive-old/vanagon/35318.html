Hello Michael,

&gt;A way back when the panel van had some really cheesy camper windows &gt;hacked
&gt;into it above the &quot;beltline&quot; on the drivers side.

&gt;I am _considering_ replaceing the panel with the windows hacked in to it
&gt;with the _correct_ replacement panel from a 66' panel van that i found in &gt;a
wreckers. my question is has anyone ever undertaken this procedure? &gt;aside
from the obvious job of cutting out the old panel and welding a &gt;&quot;new&quot; one
back in, are there any other unforseen difficulties? (i.e. unibody &gt;sagging
etc) Maybe it is easier to simply fill in the exisiting holes where &gt;the
windows were cut in and just repaint the panel?

The 'panel' is actually the skin part of a complex of vertical and horizontal
ribs spot welded to the panel.  If you try to take the whole panel out, you
will also have to cut or chisel out every one of the spot welds on both donor
vehicle and your van -- not a job to be undertaken lightly.  The alternative
could be to weld in just the parts that have been cut away, or to put in
somewhat larger patch(es) that make it easier to hide the seams.  It is going
to take a lot of labor to make the patches invisible.

I have a '65 camper conversion on a van body.  It is fairly nicely done, and
the camper windows are stainless instead of aluminum, but the windows are
just shoved into pretty ragged holes cut in the van's sides, and I have
thought seriously about patching in regular bus window openings.  I have the
parts to do the job, but haven't taken the plunge, yet.  I guess one
horizontal seam line should go on the belt bulge.  Maybe we could hide the
upper horizontal seam just under the rain gutter molding.  

Keep us posted if you try it.
