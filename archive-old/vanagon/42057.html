Subject: Access to fiche for Vanagon?

Do any kind souls have access to the fiche that would show an 85 vanagon? 
Specifically, I need to know where the exhaust support braces connect.  (A
FAXed or snail-mailed printout would be IDEAL!).  Secondarily, I'd like to know
what the piece that the coolant expansion tank bolts onto is connected to (all
I can figure so far is towards the bumper end where it slides into the bolts?).

Thanks!!

David
