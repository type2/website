&gt;Is there a way to Lubricate the cable with out removing

&gt;How can I solve this problem quickly before the cable breaks
&gt;or something else happens.

&gt;This is in my 76 Westy.

&gt;Any help is appreciated.

On my '67 and my '84 all I have to do is unscrew (or unclip)
the cable from the back of the speedo under the dash and
apply lubrication at the end of the cable.  It has been ten
years since I worked on a bubble-window bus, but I don't
recall it being much different from my split or my Vanagon.

I've been using a spray Teflon lube which is thin enough to
roll down the cable and eventually lube the length of the
cable.  Gravity seems to work.
