Subject: Re: NetWisdom Needed: Rear Engine Carrier


&gt;Query -- can I put on one of those bug engine -to- bus
&gt;adapters (the ones that bolt to the oil pump cover), even 
&gt;though my case does have the casting bulges for the carrier
&gt;bolts? It would seem to be the best way to get the thing
&gt;home, where I could do the job right at a more convienent
&gt;time, but I'm worried about the adapter and hardware fitting.
&gt;If the collective wisdom is to pull the bus the 30miles home,
&gt;I might do that on Saturday.
&gt;
&gt;Lemme know what you think, eh?  Thanks

I think that the &quot;kit&quot; you are talking about includes 4 longer studs for the 
oil pump.  I assume that the old studs would have to be removed for the 
adapter to work.  I would tow the baby, and work on it in a more convienient 
place.
