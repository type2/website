&gt;Although I'm not the kind who takes drugs I'd swear that when I drive my
&gt;vanagon through snow (which is falling rapidly) that around 25-30 mph,
&gt;the world takes on a different sence.  Instead of me driving on the road,

it's the Magic of the WonderBus. :)  but you're not the only one who notices
it. i think it has to do with the size of the interior of the bus and the
lack of any nose/hood on the bus. cause i noticed in chicago that you do
NOT get the same sensation in a beetle or other 'cars' (specially LARBs ...
Large American Road Barges). :)

&gt;another vehicle.  For those that have noticed this, what do you do to
&gt;return your concentration to reality?

move your eyes around a lot. don't 'stare' out the windshield: it is somewhat
hypnotizing. fer real.  look around out the sides and up at the roof/sky,
and at any other people in the car.

&gt;Perhaps it is just that the vanagon runs so smoothly at 30 mph.  Perhaps
&gt;it's too much propane.  Who knows?

yeah, that's it: too much propane. heheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheh.
