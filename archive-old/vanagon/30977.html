Subject: Syncro Madness Pics

To all those who wrote asking to see pictures of my van driving through deep
water, I am thinking of sending these pics off to David Schwartz for him to
scan in and add to the Syncro Madness page he has. In the meantime, those
who have a web browser can see about 10 pics of the van in various states of
horror at the following address:
