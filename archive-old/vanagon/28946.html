Subject: Re: How I got home from work (broken clutch cable)

&gt;The problem so far: I'm wearing slacks and a tie. OK, I ditched the tie,
&gt;but the white shirt is now all greasy. I'm on a budget, and a shirt costs
&gt;as much as the labor I'm trying to save here. I'm going to suggest that we
&gt;all throw a pair of COVERALLS behind the seat. Also, I'm on the street and
&gt;cars are whizzing past me frighteningly close. Flashers mean nothing to the
&gt;commuter maniacs rushing home to six packs and television. Since I'm trying
&gt;to save money, getting hit is out of the question. My medical insurance is
&gt;$3000 deductible, more than the cost of my bus. I put some FLARES right
&gt;next to the coveralls.
        My solution was army surplus camoflage. With pants and jacket it
keeps all but my hands and face clean. The dark green kinda hides most of
the grunge, too. Makes me look like some kinda gun totin' freak, but I'm
used to that. Unca' Joel knows about gun totin' freaks...  ;-)  Whenever I
break down on a busy road and have to crawl under, I get ALL of me under.
Most of the morons on thier way home would roll over my legs, wonder what
they hit, and not bother to stop and find out. Flares are a good idea
though. Just my $.02. Mebbe I can get a few others wearing cammies, look
real funny when someone breaks down on the way to Inuvik...    ;-)  Glad to
hear it all worked out-these are the reasons I drive a bus. Real nice to
fix the problem with a $10 part and 30 minutes of my own labor. My friends
clutch cable went out on his truck, cot $42 for the new cable-all 2.5 feet
of it. Ouch.

Peace,
