]These problems with the '85 engine surge on idle remind me of the problem
]whereby the fix is to install the factory auxiliary wirinig harness between
]the air flow box and the regular wiring. Most dealers do not know of this
]fix. This is, like, a $20 part or something. Try this next. E-mail me if you
]must for the part number.

Hmmm....  Might this problem also exist on an '84?  Mine does some weird
stuff just off idle, particular if the weather is cold.  What does this
auxiliary wiring harness do?  If this isn't an '85-only problem, please
post the part number to the list for all of us with 1.9 wasserboxers.
