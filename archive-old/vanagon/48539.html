Subject: Only in Alabama!!

Joel, (and list)
I recently read this on 0ff-road mailing list.  I thought of you when I saw
the Alabama connection: (I couldn't wait til Friday)

&quot;Dave &lt;or Joel&gt; so-and-so of Anniston &lt;or Tuscaloosa&gt;, Alabama, was injured
recently after he attempted to replace a tubelike fuse in his Chevy pickup
&lt;or VW Vanagon&gt; with a 22-caliber rifle bullet (used because &quot;it was a
perfect fit&quot;).  However, when electricity heated the bullet, it went off and
shot him in the knee.&quot;

(Yes, I know Vanagons don't use that shape of fuse)
