I replaced 3rd/4th sliding hub gear a couple years ago. The hardest part
about the rebuild was getting a special tool to get into the gearbox. If
the problem is in the differential it is a lot easier. I would highly
recommend a Bentley manual.
Good Luck

&gt;Here's the story:
&gt;
&gt;Newly bought 1979 Westfalia with a bad main bearing in the 
&gt;transmission (manual, not automatic).  Local (San Luis Obispo, CA) VW 
&gt;mechanic estimates $800 for a rebuild job.  I think this is very high.
&gt;Any option?  I was told that it didn't have to be rebuilt for a
&gt; while-- the noise is not very bad right now, but the mechanic 
&gt;said it would get much worse. 
&gt;
&gt;I am not very experienced working on VW's.  Is it a good idea for me 
&gt;to buy a manual, a rebuilt tranny, and go for it?
&gt;
&gt;Anybody know of a place that will do a rebuild for cheaper in the Los 
&gt;Angeles, Ventura, Santa Barbara, Orange County area anywhere?
&gt;
&gt;Any and all suggestions and comments are appreciated.
&gt;
&gt;TIA,
&gt;

&gt;
&gt;P.S.  Update the statz!  I am no longer a wanabusser.  1979 Westfalia.
