&gt; I have an 85 Vanagon GL and here's my question:
&gt; What's the maximum highway speed I can cruise at without jeapordizing
&gt; my engine? I live in Utah and the freeways out here now have 75mph
&gt; limits. I'd like to travel at 75 but I worry about the rpms hovering over
&gt; 4000 for extended periods of time. Should I worry?

 Well I have run the Ohio roads for hours at 4,500 RPM, with out a problem.
 Thats with a oil change every 3,000 miles. And about 85 MPH. Factory motor.
  I would say no.
