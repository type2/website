&gt;  Yes, strange as it may sound, VW teamed up with Winnebago to create the
&gt; most expensive camper-van yet! The one that I am familiar with is called
&gt; the Rialta. It looks like a Winnebago that someone grafted onto the cab
&gt; of an EV. From what I've recently learned (this string of posts) it does
&gt; have a well disguised but roomy pop-top. That's about where the
&gt; similarities to a Westy end, the rest is *pure* luxury. Spacious,
&gt; ergonomical, and well equipped with amenities rarely seen travelling
&gt; behind a VW hood ornament such as a really neat fold out shower stall! 
&gt; 
&gt;  There is also a EuroVan Westy, but that's different (and cheaper).

ACTUALLY, (and correct me if I'm wrong, EV owners), the Rialta is the
BIG version of a EV camper done by Winnebago, it's a real RV, not a
camper van.  There is no pop-top, it's like one of those Ford RVs that
looks like a Ford van from the nose to the rear of the front doors but
after that it's pure RV. 

Winnebago also does the conoversions for the regular EV camper van,
which does have a pop top.

Westfalia used to do it, but no longer.
