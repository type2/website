 The only three differences I can think of compared to previous trips was 
 1) my switch from Castrol Syntec 5-50 to Mobil1 15-50
 2) driving at highway speed for more than an hour (it takes at least 30
 minutes to reach steady state temperature)
 3) hot climate (95F)
 
 I would like to blame the different oil as the main culprit. Have others
 had a similar experience?

It may also be possible that the oil level is too high.  I have found these
things run best with the level between the marks.  I have been using the
mobil 1 for years and have not had any trouble.  In fact, my wifes rabbit
just turned 239K on it.  Started using the mobil 1 at 123K.  Change every 10K
miles if I remeber.  She drives it 90+ miles a day.
