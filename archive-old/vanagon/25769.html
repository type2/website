Subject: wasserboxer exhaust welding

Arrrg-
i just had the $%_at_#  exhuast system crack again, this time at the 
entrance to the converter.  successfully welded for $15.  so far, the 
exhaust has cracked and been welded successfully at the following 
places (it's turning out a little like lightning, never twice in the 
same spot):

-front brace joint (6&quot; section of pipe replaced and just welded to the 
clamp)

-flange where both cylinder banks come together

-tailpipe rusted out/fell off (new one bent and welded on)

-entrance to converter

On the positive side, the repairs have been inexpensive and have not 
failed.  i think one can get quite a few repairs to the system before 
replacement is required as the metal seems fairly substantial to 
weld.
