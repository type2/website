Since I am a new list member myself I believe that a lot of new members
may get the idea that old VW busses (and new ones) are not that reliable.
Hearing everyone's problems can be somewhat discouraging.  So lets hear some
good news such as how long some of you list member's old high milage busses
have run without any real problems.  Has anyone out there been able to go  
one year (everyday driving) with a 15 year old or greater, high milage bus
without any breaksdowns or problems (besides regular maintanence)?  I would
be interested in the reliability one can get out of these &quot;classics&quot;.

My 61 corner window deluxe (no sunroof) was a reliable daily driver for a
year and a summer.  This included two summer road trips of over 3000 miles
each.   Driving down the road in the summer heat with the safari windsheids
open,   winding through the U shaped valleys in Glacier National Park,
 Seeing buffalo under the full moon in Yellowstone, camping in the lodgepole
pines,  exploring   the Bitterroots,  what more can you ask for?  It required
the usual maintenace, and there was a problem with the ignition switch, which
had to be replaced.    It was great until a dufous head ran into it.  (doh!)
 so it awaits repair  .........

well, i guess that's not that positive,  but i have met a couple of guys who
have owned their buses for over 25 years!!  how's that for dedication?
