&gt;evaporator temperature reaches pre-determined value&quot; ... the pre-determined
&gt;value being what you set the dash/overhead temp switch to).
&gt;
&gt;now ... the picture shows the ambient temp switch INSIDE the car, but maybe
&gt;it is poking through a hole to the outside of the car. it would be exiting
&gt;somewhere behind those plastic grills for the air intakes.
&gt;
&gt;unfortunately, bentley does NOT have any 80-85 vanagons or any other buses
&gt;.. but we all know that lots of other years had a/c. so where is the same
&gt;stuff on them?  none of my books have any info. :(

This is how our 85 is set up.  The temp control is in the overhead front 
overhead panel.  There's a wire/prob/sensor that goes to the a/c unit
behind the front seats with the end going into the inside unit.

Of course the only way to get at it is to take the entire unit out.
Not easy when doing it by yourself.  :-(
