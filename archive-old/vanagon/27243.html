     Instead of a V6, how 'bout an Audi 5?

     These are 300K mi bulletproof engines, that run with a turbine like
     smoothness, due to some peculiar balance characteristics of the 5cyl
     configuration. They are available at great prices from unloved (the
     ones without Quattro) Audis from the 80's.

     You can get normally aspirated engines with about 135HP, turbos
     with anywhere from 168HP to 227HP.  Typically, these are 2.1 or 2.2
     liters displacement.

     They already fit. A variant of this engine was installed in Vanagons
     outside the US (maybe our SA collegues can chime in with more
     information).

     Flying with the fantasy, once the list helps you get the details
     sorted out all those diesel owners could upgrade to the diesel version
     of the Audi 5cyl  (also sold by VW to Volvo, which put them in 240s
     and 740s for awhile) and be able to keep up in the Bus caravans AND
     enjoy airconditioning!
