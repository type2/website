&gt;Just over half way through the fill up, I heard what sounded linke a
&gt;waterfall under the Van, so being the curious type I stopped filling to
&gt;take a look. Sure enough there was a waterfall or should I say gasfall
&gt;running out from somewhere above the middled of the van where the tank
&gt;is. Yikes!
&gt;I managed to get home with out blowing anything up and will climb under
&gt;there this weekend to take a look. Has this happened to anyone else?

yup. doofus dealer &quot;fixed&quot; my car on a recall ... and the idiots left off
the fuel tank sender gasket!!!! but mine did it when nearer to full than
about half ... my guess for yours would be the filler neck gasket, except
that would be more toward the front of the front wheel on that side. ??

maybe a rusted spot on the seam of the tank?
