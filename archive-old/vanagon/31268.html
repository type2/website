Subject: 80 vanagon heat duct


Hello,

	I have a quick question for some of the air-cooled experts out 
there. I am missing the heat ducting elbow that extends from the heater 
blower down thru the sheet metal fitting into the right heat exchanger.  
This is an 80 Vanagon bye the bye.  Don't ask me how i lost it, but 
my question is can I drive without it?  I have called every dealer in 
the area and I leave tommorrow (24 hours) on a trip to Wyomming.  Without 
this piece I have noticed that the right heat exchanger gets much hotter 
than the left one, seemingly since no cooler air is blowing thru it.  I 
realize of course that i am sacrificing some of my van's heating 
capabilities without this piece, i think i can deal with that, I want to 
know if i am possibly hurting anything else?

	I would greatly appreciate any help and advice any of you could 
give me.  Happy Holidays.

Peter Ruggiero
