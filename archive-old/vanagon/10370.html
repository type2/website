&gt; I don't remember seeing this discussed anywhere, so does anyone know
&gt; if replacement gears are available for my tranny to lower the revs at 
&gt; 60 mph?  It seems criminal to make that poor engine turn 4000 rpm at 60 
&gt; when the torque at 3000 rpm is probably sufficient for the job.  It's 
&gt; nice to have the real low first gear for jeep roads in the mountains, 
&gt; but in the flats I wind through the gears pretty fast.  The ultimate 
&gt; solution would be a five-speed tranny.  Are there any possibilities 
&gt; here?  Or were the German engineers pretty smart when they designed the
&gt; factory gearing?

  The calculations we did for the now infamous &quot;wear index&quot; indicate that with
  stock gearing and stock size tires, the engine in a '69 should be turning 
  3484 rpm at 60 mph. If your bus has ended up with a gearbox built in 1973
  with a numerically higher 4 th gear, the result could be 3781 rpm at 60 mph.
  The Haynes manual for 1600 buses also talks about something called &quot;mountain 
  gears&quot; which has a numerically higher final drive.
