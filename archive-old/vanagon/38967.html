Subject: Re: Wretched Excess

&gt;my copy from the list.  At least two people did, and wrote to me to say
&gt;that the return address had been changed to kennedy_at_their server's name,

Yeah I bounced off you too yesterday.  Wondered why!
UPDATE: just bounced again, now.  

&gt;which is a pretty good trick when you are not even attempting a hack.  I'm
&gt;interested in how that could happen, and back on the original topic would
&gt;of course love to see and hear a V8anagon if one of you wasserpumperfahrers
&gt;wanted to &quot;see my six and raise me two&quot;.

That unit would fit perfectly inside the '85 CrewCab I'm lusting after, give 
enough power to make up for the auto trans, bet I could do wheelies (well, 
maybe one  :(  )   It would of course fit better into my '66 912, whose 
engine rebuild will cost $4500 or so.   Tim
