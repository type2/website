Subject: What is a 1965 Westy worth?

&gt;Can someone familiar with early buses one give me an
&gt;approximate price range for what this '65 westy in fair (but
&gt;needs lots of work) condition is worth?

I suspect price ranges go all over the place.  I just bought
a '67 Westy for $750.  It is complete, runs, needs
clutch/brake work, has holes in the front floor, has rocker
rust and needs new canvas/seal for the poptop.

The camper equipment shows wear, but is all there and
functional (except pump for water).  All the jalousy windows
work and it is missing one screen.

It's not pretty, needs new windshield seals and has bright
red carpet, but hey! it came complete with an
AM/FM/CB/8-track in the dash that works!

Also, I looked in the latest Old Cars Price Guide I have
(June 1992--time to buy another).  They do not have a camper
listed for 1965, but all type 2 models for that year are
listed at between $600 and $750 for Condition 5 (restorable)
and between $950 and $1300 for Condition 4 (Good, read
driveable).  Does that help?

p.s.  Sorry for the delay to answer your question.  I just
looked and realized I responded to your question on the
wrong list.  Duh.
