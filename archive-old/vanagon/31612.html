Subject: EV needs good home....


While doing my last minute errands prior to departing for Europe, I
stopped by my local VW dealer. On the lot was a 93 EV GL which 
came in yesterday, so I thought I'd pass along the details if
anyone is interested.

93 EuroVan GL
Light Sahara Beige Metallic w/beige interior
A/C
Power Package (Door locks, windows, and cruise(?))
Automatic Trans &lt;--(yeeccchhh!!!)
31K miles

Looks to be in good shape...probably former VW lease car, considering
its about 3 years old...

Its at Pearson-Miller VW, North Dartmouth, MA, (508) 999-4573 
ask for Ken.

FWIW,

Ric
