Subject: Re: coil over shock info 

&gt;
&gt;      Hey there folks.
&gt;             Well here it is.  Type II '68-'79 (that's all I checked, mine's
&gt;a '72) take rear shocks of the same dimensions, so these SHOULD work on
&gt;those years with a few modifications.  Well here goes with a few specs.
&gt;
&gt;              original                                coil-over 
&gt;    
&gt;lenghth ext.  22.875&quot;                                   22.5&quot;
&gt;   collapsed   13.5&quot;                                    13.375&quot;
&gt;mount hole dia  12mm                                    5/8&quot;
&gt;
&gt;      Well as you can see the length difference shouldn't have any
&gt;significant impact on they're installation.  The diameter of the mounting
&gt;holes are the same top and bottom on both shocks so a couple small sleeves
&gt;should solve that.  And guess what, the sleeves on the shocks that were on
&gt;my bus (although a real chore to remove and install) fit nicely.  Now for
&gt;the biggest but still relatively minor problem.  Since the shock has a coil
&gt;spring around it, it's approx. 1&quot; larger in diameter and wouldn't clear some
&gt;sheet metal down there in the nether regions.  Fortunately a spacer about
&gt;1/2&quot; thick slid on before the shock solved that.   Remember to put one top
&gt;and bottom to keep the geometry correct.  It left me with about a half a
&gt;thread showing but why would you possibly need more than a full nut's worth
&gt;of threads?  You wouldn't.  I hope this helps all your draggin' ass buses.
&gt;By the by,  as I mentioned earlier I manage a FLAPS here in Florida. I sell
&gt;these for $30.81 ea.  You should be able to get them for that at any larger
&gt;auto parts store. They list for $73.95 ea  and installer price is $45.31 ea.
&gt;The price I quoted is jobber price and smaller stores may be reluctant to
&gt;sell them that cheap because some may pay that themselves.  
&gt;                   Happy hoisting,
&gt;                        Doug                  
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;I just realized that I forgot to give you the part #.  Monroe 54497.
                   Doug
