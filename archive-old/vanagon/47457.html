Subject: Gas odor - '78 Westy

I have just bought a 1978 Westfalia (beautiful GREEN color!) which has 
been stored for the past several years. I bought it from the estate of a 
man who was unable to drive for some time prior to his passing. The bus 
is in really good shape cosmetically, and drives really well also. The 
only problem is that from the time I filled the tank with gas I have been 
able to smell gasoline while driving.  I have stopped several times and 
examined the gas lines into the engine compartment (both through the rear 
access lid and the top access over the engine) but have found no leakage. 
The line is dry, both the metal line and rubber connectors.  It seems 
that as the gas gauge dropped below the 1/4 mark, there is no more gas 
smell. I am concerned first of all from a safety standpoint, and secondly 
it is doing my miles-per-gallon no good.

I can only see the back of the gas tank from the access ports. Is there a 
way to examine the rest of the tank? Is there an overflow which might be 
backed up/clogged? Can you see or access the tank by putting it on a 
lift? I certainly would appreciate the thoughts of you Westy experts.
