Hi there. I have a syncro bus for sale that I'd like to list on the Syncro
website that you're involved with.  Can you tell me how to do that or could
you do it for me? I'm pretty much of a net know-nothing.  If you can,
here's the info:

1990 Syncro Vanagon 80k miles, vg cond. pwr. locks, white. $9,950. In
Boston: inquiries by phone only 617-625-0454

Thanks.
