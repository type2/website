Tonya:
The cheapest possible cause would be the valve cover
gasket(13%pobability).
Next would be the oil pressure sending unit.(27.2%)
Next is a pushrod tube cover.(22.3%)
Next  is front oil seal .(12%)
The most expensive would be rear oil seal or oil pump cover seal since
this reqiures the removal of a major item i.e transmision,crossbrace
etc..

&gt;Hi all,
&gt;
&gt;Now that the 1st has past and I've spent my paycheck on all the bills
&gt;already, I notice that my beloved vanagon has sprung an oil leak.
&lt;SNIP&gt;
&gt;So, with this flimsy amount of information, before I bring it to the
&gt;dealer to be fixed (mine is reasonable most of the time), am I looking
&gt;at a major expense or minor?  It's time for the oil to be changed, but
&gt;doubt seriously that that is causing the leak :)
&gt;
&gt;Thanks all!
