Subject: JCW oil cooler

Well, as I alluded to in my post on brake squeal, I put the oil cooler on and
it worked wonders but leaked. As it turns out the aluminum cooler and the
brass bayonet fittings really weren't compatible or possibly required more
delicacy in the fitting than I utilized. I tried cleaning up the threads etc
and just couldn't make any headway. Both fittings made it to the same point,
about 4 turns or 1/2 way in, and then seized. Not good enough.

JCW's response, not to my surprise, was exchange or refund? Rather than go
through this exercise for several more weeks, I pulled it off tonight to just
send back. I'll just try to find something locally. Too bad really since the
cooler itself is a slick item and fit the space perfectly.
