Subject: syncro front shocks
Date: Thu, 11 Jul 1996 18:51:20 -0700

I recently replaced the rear shocks on my 87 syncro Westfalia. The old, 
original ones were just about shot, I could easily move the piston in and 
out. The difference in how the van handled was quite noticeable. Now I'm 
figuring the front shocks are in similar shape and am considering replacing 
them as well.

Have any of you syncronauts done this before? Bentley calls out several 
special tools for the procedure including a spring compressor. I figure I 
can rent one of those, but what about the others? I'd appreciate any info 
from anyone that has replaced the front shocks on their syncro.

BTW, non-syncro folks need not respond as the syncro shock installation is 
quite different from the normal Vanagons. Cost way more too of course ;)

Also I've determined from scanning the archives that the front shocks are a 
dealer only item. Anyone know differently?
