The new refrigerant being mass-installed in cars today is R-134a.  The old
refrigerant, called Freon, is R-12, not R-112.

Freon is being phased out due to the fact that it contains CFCs which are
thought to damage the ozone layer.  

Freon is not being manufactured anymore, at least not in this country and
importing it is illegal.  What is sold now is the remaining existing stock.
 

At the garage where I work, we do A/C services.  Inspecting and testing the
system runs $24.95, and charging the system runs $149.95, not including any
parts that need to be replaced to stop leaks, etc.  The current going price
of Freon is around $30 per pound.  It is NOT cheap.  

Our garage is thinking of discontinuing A/C services, as it's getting to
the point where we're really not making much of anything on them, due to
the high price of Freon.

Our garage is not capable of handling R-134a, so as a note to those who
will convert, many places may not have the equipment to deal with it yet.

&gt; Well If ou have the original in, you will soon have to replace it anyway 
 
&gt; as the new federal laws require a different type of refrigerant ( 134A?) 
 
&gt; .  The old compressors can't use the new &quot;green&quot; stuff.  However, have   
&gt; you determined if the compressor is bad or just simply low on freon?
&gt; 
&gt; You might still be able to get the old refrigerant ( R 112), however,   
&gt; since it is illegal to manufacture it, the price will almost be   
&gt; unbearable.  You can still use the old stuff legally, it is a big   
&gt; problem, however, finding it at an earthling price.
