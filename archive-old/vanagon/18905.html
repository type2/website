Subject: Fuel Pump Conclusion and other stuff

Well, with several hose clamps and some creative use of other bits of 
metal, I mounted and attached the fuel pump.  It leaked the first time I 
turned it on, but it was mostly because the fuel lines sizes are not 
exactly right, so I just tightened up the clamps some more and it 
stopped.  It was the right fix too, because now the car is running like 
it was instead of hesitating all the time.

Got my trailer hitch put on.  $106 installed, but it's really only rated 
to 1000 lbs and not 2000 as they told me on the phone.  I bought a tent 
trailer (haven't picked it up for lack of a hitch) and I hope that it's 
enough hitch to pull it.  I expect it is -- it's a small trailer.

The installation looks pretty clean: Install by Hitchin' Post on
University Avenue in St. Paul, hitch by Rigid Hitch in Bloomington, MN. 
This hitch bolts onto the two loops under the bumper.
