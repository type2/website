Subject: Best deal on KYB's?


Hi All,
	I am going to replace the rear shocks on my '86 Westy.  Looking
through the archives led me to think that the KYB Gas-A-Just were the way
to go.  There was a entry that spoke of them being on sale somewhere for
under $30 ea., that was quite some time ago and they are no longer
available.  So I am wondering if anyone out there has a hot source for
these at a low low bargain price:) Or any other price for that matter. How
about you BusBoys or Ron Salmon Inc.?  What are your prices? Thanks a ton.

Cory
