Subject: Eurovan Tire Questions


Its come time to replace the Continental Tires that came stock on by EV.  I
cought a little info a while back on EV tires but need more.  Initially my
local FLATS (is this a new acronym?) tried to sell me non-reinforced
Michelins and said they'd do just fine.  I said nope.  If thats what it
came with there must be a reason for the reinforced sidewall.  The dealer
agreed.  Dealer also wanted $120 apiece for Continentals GAG!!!.  Anyway I
have Michelin MXL's with reinforced sidewalls on order for next week. 
Anyone have experience with these tires?  What are other EV'ers using for
tires?

Ken
