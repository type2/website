Couple more points...

flip the axles end for end so that the &quot;other faces&quot; of the
cv joints are taking the wear (when driving forward!).
Maybe get more life out of those joints?
If you are just replacing one cv per axle, I think there is some
merit in placing the new joint at the end which doesn't make
the sharpest, (most acute?) angle... inboard?
 An ex vw mech, (Werner), told me those two hints. I trust him, he likes
working on breadbox buses, what can I say!
