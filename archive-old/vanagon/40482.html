Subject: Engine rebuild startup

What does an engine sound like and feel like when it's started up for the
first time, with new pistons and cylinders and rebuilt heads? Does it feel
tight? Sound kind of rough at first? I seem to have a bit of valve clatter,
does this settle down with time (hydraulic valves) ? I let it run for a few
minutes, but it seems to want to die and I'm afraid to let it run anymore.
Do I need to just grit my teeth and bear with it for 20 minutes according
to &quot;How to rebuild your aircooled engine&quot;?

Is it just that the rings are a little tight and need to wear into the
cylinders? And the valves need to wear in also? Any advice as to what to
listen for, to do, and not to do when breaking an engine in for the first
time would be GREATLY appreciated, I'd rather not make an expensive
mistake!   Thanks  Tom
