Subject: '80 Vanagon Tranny runneth over
From: shea_at_xmission_dot_com (Gary Shea)

Here's a weird one.  My tranny has been sitting on the floor
of the garage for 3 months, waiting for the engine to be done.
I put both back in the beast couple days ago, didn't bother to hook
up the CV's, and started it up.  Afterwards, noticed a bit
of trans oil at the front of the tranny, on
the drivers-side corner where the tranny mount is.

The oil continues to appear, looking a bit foamy; the amount
seems to be proportional to how long the engine is run.
Nothing like this has ever happened before!  There is
a certain amount of suspicious looking old greasy dirt around
that area but then that's true of the entire rear end so go
figure.

Think this is just because the CV's are off, and the gears in
a possibly indeterminate state?  The linkage is a bit funny,
I played with it a bit while trying to figure out how
to get it off, months ago.
