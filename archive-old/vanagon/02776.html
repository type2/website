Subject: Chips

OK, if I ask too many questions, somebody whack me in the head {`_~} !

Now for one more. I know from glancing at all those &quot;Hot VW&quot;/&quot;European Car&quot;
type magazines that there are all sorts of aftermarket (and illegal once
installed, I presume) engine-computer control chips available for
hot-rodding yer GTI, etc.

I am curious as to whether anyone makes such reprogramming chips for
Vanagons? Something that would broaden a stock waterboxer's torque curve a
bit might really enhance driveability.

Anybody?

Paul
