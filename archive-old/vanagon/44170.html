&gt;&gt;       Maybe I didn't make myself clear.  The problem is, when the
&gt;&gt;motor is OFF I do not have to press the clutch pedal to switch gears.
&gt;&gt;When the motor is off, I can easily move the transmition into whatever
&gt;&gt;gear I want without pressing the clutch pedal.  Whith the motor
&gt;&gt;running, you need to press the clutch pedal down to switch gears.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;So yeah, I am going to replace the clutch cable
&gt;
&gt;Well, I guess I'm still not clear on whether the original poster on
&gt;this one, is pulling everybody's leg, so I'll stick mine out a little
&gt;further.

Maybe this was a Clevis and Butthead gag.
