Well I can answer only with what I did at the Richmond (Dinwiddie) VA Bug 
Out.  Middle of the summer and I have a Eurovan full of kids including my 
4 month old baby.  We caravaned down with a herd of Beetles and a Ghia. 
(no not a Dodge Caravan... yech) When we finally got there (a few 
missteps by the lead beetle  oops...   They all headed for the parking 
lot we went toward the show gate.  Wepad our admission and got in.  They 
had no idea what  a Eurovan was at the gate but don't matter - we had a 
VW on the hood and paid our money.

This was in the middle of a heat wave and that day there were major heat 
advisories - the Chicago news was breakign around that weekend if I 
remember.  We only wanted a place to put the baby in the A/C if he got 
too hot.  The Dinwiddie spot was a HUGE parking lot with acres of asphalt 
and NO islands or anything to break it up.  BOY DID IT GET HOT.  But we 
parked the EV at the far edge of the buses  we were in 'competition with 
the vanagons and even the Bay windows - not many buses showed so they 
compacted them all into a single class.  We fired up the EV asnd cranked 
the A/C put up the privacy curtains when we needed to cool the kids.  The 
judges came by.  The kids were there and the judges merely asked if we 
were really competing or just parking.  Kids said &quot;parking&quot;.  Judgfe said 
fine and was happy we didn't waste his time.  No problem.

We were the only 'cool' people there. ;&lt;)
