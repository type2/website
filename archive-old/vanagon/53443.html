Subject: Quad Round Head Lights on SA Vanagon

Item Subject: Text_1
     Hi All,
     
       A few weeks back I and others noticed a VW Web site (I think it was 
     VW of South African or South American origin) that had a picture of a 
     late 80's early 90's Vanagon with four normal round head lights in the 
     grill.  Has anyone found out any more about these grills?  I would 
     love to get one and put it on my '85 Westy (if it will fit) and use 
     the extra holes (the '85 has the two round lights) in the grill to 
     mount off road Baha type lights to augment my high beams.  This would 
     give a slick factory look to an after-market addition!
       If anyone has attempted to find more info. on these grills, please 
     pass it along what you have found (even the dead ends or I'll get back 
     to you later responses that were give would be helpful).  If I don't 
     see any posts, I will look into in after the new year and post what I 
     find.
     
     Regards,
     
     Vince.
     '85 GL Westy
