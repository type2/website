&lt;&lt; All VW needed to do is determine the proper engine coolant operating
 temperature, and choose a radiator mounted switch with an appropriately
lower
 setpoint to account for the temperature loss in the hoses between the engine
 and the radiator.  I believe that they have done this, but perhaps a
slightly
 lower temperature switch would be helpful. &gt;&gt;

It took Volkswagen awhile, but they finally did just that in the past couple
of years by superseding various Waterboxer Fan Switches to the present one
being offered that turns at about 72C (I believe).  VAG # 251-959-481K.
 Can't get this switch yet outside of VW, but we're trying.  The old
321-959-481 &amp; 251-959-481 Series switches listed in ye old microfiche films
turns on at about 82 to 85C.  Makes ya wonder why they took so long.  I'm
putting one in my 84 Westy when the engine's finished rebuilding.

My .000002 cents worth
