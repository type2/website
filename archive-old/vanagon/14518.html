Subject: Re: Need Information about Eurovan(s)/FFFFF

Mantis shows his ignorance of things VW in the following ways:

1. His comment re: Eurovans not looking like nothing more than a
Dodge Caravan....obviously the only similarity is that both have
the letters &quot;v...a...n&quot; in their names...

2. His almost purchasing a 1990 vanagon with a 5 cylinder engine while
in college...Wow...a flat 5 what a concept...what did it have...three
cylinders on one side of the engine, and two on the other...perhaps
some one stuffed an old Ranger 5-cylinder radial from a Waco biplane
in the back of a 90 Vanagon....

Sorry Mantis...no five cylinder vanagons...no matter how footed in
reality...or dream world you are...sorry...no cigar!
