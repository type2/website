&gt;Should I stop driving it in order to save it-  This doesn't seem to do 
&gt;her justice.
&gt;Any advice or philosophical discourse (to drive or not to drive) (to 
&gt;restore or not to restore)  would be greatly welcomed.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,

I struggle a lot with the same concerns.  I purchased my bus in original 
condition and only 60,000 miles.  It seemed much easier to keep it in nice 
shape when I only drove it &lt;5000 miles/year in commute, but in the last 
year, due to a move I have put 24,000 miles on it.  I sometimes feel that it 
is a valuable vehicle to me and I want it to last a long time and I should 
try to save it, but then I realize that letting it sit does it almost as 
much harm as driving it, parts that wear out are generally available (they 
are still making new breadloafs in Mexico - saw one last Christmas - they 
look the same) and the bottom line is that I love to drive it, use it, camp 
in it, etc.

I used to have Corvettes ('61,'62,'68,'74) and struggled with not only 
&quot;using them up&quot;, but getting them in a wreck, stolen, vandalized, etc.  I 
finally got rid of them because I couldn't enjoy driving them anymore.  No 
matter how much you put into the restoration, there is always someone who 
can afford more - most non-driven, restored Corvettes are over-restored - 
they are tons better than when they were new.

Anyway, a middle ground for your bus might be to drive it, but not in the 
salt of winter.  Restore as you have time and money.  Enjoy driving it!!!  
It's one thing to see a nice bus at a show, but there is a lot to be said 
for a nice daily driver also - and you will probably get more credit for the 
daily driver.
