&gt;&gt; You guys had better pray that the person doing all these dastardly
&gt;&gt; things doesn't read vanagon.lenti.med!  :)

I doubt any of the low lifes in my 'hood are on the 'Net, other than the
&quot;safety net&quot; known as &quot;welfare.&quot;  BTW - the ice cream man who comes thru
out 'hood takes food stamps - no joke!

&gt;And that he/she doesn't get their own revenge by destroying an innocent 
&gt;old VW bus when his/her mechanic says &quot;yeah, someone put sugar in your tank&quot;.

I'm moving this weekend.  I did take that into consideration.
