Subject: (f) Vanagon Westy Scale Models

Hi,

I was just at the local hobby store and I noticed in one the magazines
that Revell/Monogram is re-introducing the air-cooled Vanagon Westy model.
Doesn't look too bad.  Similiar to the old 'Magnum PI' Revell Vanagon that
I have.  The Westy is coming out in March and can be mail ordered through
Hobby Heaven in MI, (616)453-1094 for $9.95 in March, or through your
local hobby store.  8-)
