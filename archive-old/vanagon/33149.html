Okay Steve,

I won't rack up any points with this one.  My wife was going to take my van
to the grocery store while I took her car to National Guard duty 120 miles
away, not to return for three days.  She went out to the van to go shopping
when she came back in minutes  later and said she smelled gasoline.  I went
out and sure enough the fuel line was cracked and leaking fuel.  In a hurry
to get out of town before the rush hour, and not enough time to replace the
entire hose, I put a pair of vice grips on the fuel line, cut off the old
section and used a double coupler to 'splice' in a new section.  Closed up
the engine and sent my wife on her way.  

When I returned on Sunday evening, she was fuming.  The car had broken down
about a mile down the road, I had taken the car phone.  She walked to a pay
phone to call me but I had already left and forgotton to turn on the car
phone.  She ended up calling a tow truck that towed her to a service station
($65) and left it there for the weekend because the mechanic would not be in
until Monday.  All her plans for the weekend were shot.  She was starting to
forgive me until Monday night when she found out the mechanic simply removed
my vice grips.  She told me in no uncertain terms that since I like to tinker
with my van so much (instead of having a 'professional mechanic' do repairs)
that I should spend more time with it ... starting that night!
