IS THERE ANY INTEREST IN AN EASTERN LEG?

how about a shorter, maybe week and 1/2 long tour planned to meet
up with the westerers in St Louis, just some of the eastern
US say start in NY or PA then down through DC into Virginia on
the Blue ridge mountains paralleling the Appalachian Trail
(beautiful) down into North Carolina then up across I64 
(I think maybe I60) to St. Louis.  I am very interested as it
would be the first big trip for my recently aquired '71 and
the buyer of my old '76 would love to come as well, that's 2
but both of us can't blow more than a week as I figure many
of you can't.  If people want a longer eastern leg, could we
plan it so people could easily join in as time permits? Most of
the trip could use National Forest campgrounds which are nearly
free and some of the Appalachian Mountain Chain is truely
gorgeous, though might be truly interesting in an older bus, I
last drove it with the '76 2.0 the poor 1600 could have problems.

If any easterners are interested lets get together and figure it
out already, time is a wastin.
