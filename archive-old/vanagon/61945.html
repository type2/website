Subject: Tech tip:::

       Here's a technical tip for the old timers who worked
       on big old V8 motors:

       When installing spark plugs into your Vanagon, or any
       Aluminum head engine, always lubricate the plug threads
       with anti-seize grease. This will prevent the threads from
       galding together, next time you change the plugs. If you
       are in a pinch, and cannot get anti-seize grease, use 
       wheel bearing grease. It's better than nothing. Make sure
       you don't get it on the electrode.  I personally use 
       anti-seize grease on everything that rust, heat, or corrasion
       could cause a thread problem.
