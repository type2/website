&gt; A set of circlip pliers (one that squeezes open and one that squeezes
&gt; shut) or a pair of those fiddly &quot;screw it together one way to squeeze open
&gt; and the other way to squeeze shut&quot; are a great investment. Spend less time
&gt; on your hands and knees, head resting sideways on the garage floor,
&gt; shining a flashlight parallel  to the floor hoping to find that damned
&gt; circlip that sproinged off because you were using an awl or screwdriver!
&gt; 
&gt; Really, they work!

I have a set of circlip pliers, but none of the ones I have seen are
large enough to handle the rear wheel bearing circlip.  This circlip is around
three  inches in diameter.  I ended buying a pair of long handled bentnosed
pliers from Sears to to the job.  The jaw ends fit into the circlip holes (if
they hadn't, I would have ground them until they did).  On the circlip pliers
I have seen, they tips are angled to far to grip the circlip by the time they
are spread far enough to reach the holes.
        BTW, I have everything back together except the outer bearing.  The
inner bearing went in pretty easy.  I'm going to freeze the bearing and stick
the housing in the oven to get them to fit easier.
