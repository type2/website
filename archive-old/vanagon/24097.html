Subject: Repost: 1978 Westy Restoration Project

Hi all! Several days ago I sent a message asking for some parts for my 1978
Westy. Luckily I received a message from Scoob, who sent me a pair of knobs
for the side windows (for free:) Now I'm asking again for these parts:

1. Upholstered storage box/trash container between front seats.
2. Small removable table in driver's cabin
3. Plastic base for the city water connection outside of the bus.

If anybody knows where to find these parts or if anybody has them for sale,
please reply this message. I would thankful forever. 
Adios amigos!
