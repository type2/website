&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;BODY bgcolor=3D&quot;#FFFFFF&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size=3D2 =
color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;Try going back under to your sending =
unit and pulling it out. &amp;nbsp;When it is out take the rod and bend it =
DOWN. &amp;nbsp;How much, it's hard to say. &amp;nbsp;But with a little trial =
and error you can make your empty mark were ever you want it. &amp;nbsp;I =
have not done this with the Vanagon but my 82 Chevy pick-up had the same =
problem and it worked great, I set it up to the Empty line on the gage =
had 2-3 gal. left.&lt;br&gt;Looking through my Bently it looks like this would =
work just as well. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Ronald P. Mc Donald =
