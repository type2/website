	Mark,
	The oil consumption confirms it. You need, at least,
new oil seals on you valves. That's why the seller is supposed to do
the smog check, and you've just convinced me that I'll have anything I
consider buying smogged BEFORE I make a final offer. I didn't have this
problem last time I bought a used car, but I DID never try it in 5th until
it was mine (D-U-M-B) and that's when the pinion whine was loudest...

	Your 'lost' oil is going out the tail pipe, and you and your 2.75 million
closest friends here in the SF Bay area get to breathe it. So I'd like to
encourage you to get it fixed, but I dig the near-doubling of the cost...

	Does anyone know about replacing Vanagon valve seals without
pulling the heads? It might stop the oil loss, even if everything is worn out.

	Bill
