Subject: Eurovan Crew Cab Pickup

Maybe this is old information.  I suspect that Ric has sales brochures that 
show this, even.  But my parents just got back from a trip to Germany.  I 
told him to take pictures of any VW pickups he saw and he returned with 3 - 
two yellow vanagon crew cabs, and a really nice blue Eurovan crew cab 
pickup.  I didn't even know these existed in a crew cab version (Michael 
Heron has a picture of a single cab).

So, it appears that they still make Vanagon pickups in the synchro models, 
as well as Eurovan pickups.

I haven't looked at the VW web site, so maybe this isn't earth shattering 
news....
