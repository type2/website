Subject: Re: Fuzzy Gasket

The Blue lever on the doors opens the cab to the outside air, allowing 
fresh air ventilation from outside to occur. As our vanagons are so air 
tight, air would not flow easily (in theory) if there was not some 
release for the air pressure. The ventilation does flow easier if it is 
open.

&gt; I'll try this one.  The Vanagon (and I presume Caravelle) versions had
&gt; vents in the upper rear cabin area for fresh air.  There are four levers
&gt; on the dash control.  The fourth (bottom) lever opens a fresh-air flap
&gt; at the bottom of the heater unit.  This allows air to travel through a
&gt; metal channel in the dash (which makes it a bitch to get to anything
&gt; under there, through the doors, up the door posts and through to the back
&gt; vents.  The Transporters all seem to lack this lever, flap, gaskets and
&gt; vents.  The early Westfalias were built from Kombi models, and also lacked
&gt; these.  Later Westies were built from &quot;Camper&quot; bases, and this feature was
&gt; on these.  I have only seen the vents on the passenger side, and the
&gt; driver's side probably does nothing (I don't have a late westies, so please
&gt; correct me!).  The passenger versions have vents on both sides (two per
&gt; side in the rear).  I am busy adding these vents to my doublecab, but have
&gt; not started to change the heater unit to one with the proper flap.  The
&gt; DC has fixed rear windows (as does the Kombi) and really *needs* the
&gt; ventilation.
&gt; 
&gt; The blue lever on the lower doors does not connect to this system on any of
&gt; my versions.  It is also not covered in my owner's manuals.  I have no idea
&gt; what (if anything) this contraption does!  I am a believer that VW never
&gt; spent a cent they did not have to.  Anybody know what the blue lever does?
&gt; My '80 is in the Bay Area so I can't check, but I thought the function of
&gt; this thing was covered in *that* owner's manual.

&gt; &gt;  I just replaced both fuzzy gaskets on my 87 westy. i bought them from a
&gt; &gt; wrecker for $5cdn each - they connect the vent (blue sliding heater
&gt; &gt; control on bottom) passages to the rear (above sliding door in Westy).
&gt; &gt; Why there is said passageway on drivers side door I have no idea - where
&gt; &gt; does it go? No vents in left hand valence. I believe they are available
&gt; &gt; from VW for about $30 or something.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Listees:
&gt; &gt; &gt;             I'm looking for the 'fuzzy gasket' that goes between the
&gt; &gt; &gt; drivers (or passengers) door and the door post. I assume that it is for
&gt; &gt; &gt; the heat or air transfer from rear to front. This is for an 86 Westy.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks if you can help, or even if you can't. You are all the greatest
&gt; &gt; &gt; and am learning a bunch..........
