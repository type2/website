&gt;Yes, it's true.  Here in the Bay Area a 1971 bus has successfully passed
&gt;it's biennial inspection, late news at ten.


My '71 Bus did that a while back, too... with a stock 1970 single-port
engine! The inspector was evidently happy just to see the appropriate
air cleaner, bus muffler, fewer than two carbs, and a vacuum muffin
on the distributor. Technically, this engine would be illegal in San Diego,
since it didn't have the '71 carb and manifold, and heads etc. But I
forgot to remind him of this.  :)

Of course, if he could see it now...
