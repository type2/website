So Christian Pittack says:
&gt; Vanagon drivers don't wave because aircoolers have attitudes towards &quot;yuppie
&gt; vanagon drivers&quot;....sellouts if you will!  I love love old aircoolers and
&gt; wish I had the time restore one.....but until till then my daily driver is my
&gt; reliable '82 Diesel.

Well my experience with waving is that in all versions, there are some that
wave and some that don't.  I've waved at all the types and have gotten funny
stares or completely ignored.  Others wave back and smile.  This is with the
splits, breadloafs, vanagons &amp; EVs.  I'll tell you one thing.  While driving
to the coast of Oregon from Corvallis, I got so many waves from other VWs
my arm got tired.   :)
