&gt; Yesterday was not a good day. First my 75 bus failed to pass the annual
&gt; inspection because of leaks in the exhaust. Fine. But then, a few highway
&gt; miles later, a hub cap (from the one wheel they took off to check the
&gt; brakes) fell off and with it one of those shiny aluminum beauty rings my
&gt; wife just offered me a couple of weeks ago. &lt;sob!&gt;

Instead of replacing the beauty rings, why don't you consider painting 
your rims white?  I did, and was very pleased with the result.  Still use
the hub caps, though.  An added bonus is that the paint doesn't fall off!
Well, maybe a little bit...

Here is my contribution to the VW ascii collection, a representation of 
DA BOAT, which is a bubble top, in case you were wondering...  :)
