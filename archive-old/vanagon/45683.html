Subject: smoke from the hot air output
Date: Tue, 2 Jul 1996 03:24:06 +0300 (EET DST)

hello,

occasionally some grey smoke flows from my '72 kastenwagens hot air
output to the cabin. this is somewhat annoying as hot air 'open/close'
lever seems to be broken too so we can't stop it. i think that it smells
like steaming oil but my friend thinks it smells more like gasoline. any
suggestions what it could cause and how can i repair this fault?
