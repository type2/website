Subject: Re: 1965 Westy Question


I sent this directly to Michael, but though it might be of interest
to the list.

&gt;can anyone explain what the numbers mean on the metal tag that is pop
&gt;rivted to the bulkhead behind the front passenger seat on my 1965
&gt;Westfalia?
&gt;
&gt;Here are what the numbers on the tag look like
&gt;_____________________________
&gt;|  191                       |
&gt;|  425 A42 002 080 108 168   |
&gt;|  UH 2312 523907 5091317    |
&gt;|____________________________

Hi Michael!  I'm going to take a stab at this.

The first line is the manufacturing date:

January 19, 1965

The second line has the M-codes for options.  The ones I can figure
out are:

080     Separate Front Seats for Panel or Kombi

108     With SO-42 Camper Kit

168     88 Ampere/Hour Battery

The third line has the point of entry:

U is for USA, H is for point of entry

231     is the model, Kombi

The next number is for color codes, can't figure out

The last number is the VIN number (add 23 for model)
(23)5091317

&gt;Ultimately I would like to find the original paint code for the bus (i.e.
&gt;an &quot;L&quot; number), basically i think i have the original paint narrowed down
&gt;to being either pearl white or Ivory (not 100% sure that if that is the
&gt;right name)

The paint codes should be on a silver sticker below the metal plate.
If yours was originally white it should be Pearl White (L87) or
Ivory (L567).

Hope some of this helps.

&gt;thanks!!!!!!!!!
&gt;
&gt;it helps tons, you are the first one to respond to my query, so yes your
&gt;response is very helpful. i never knew that the middle line stood for &quot;M&quot;
&gt;codes. you are entirely accurate with all of the &quot;M&quot; codes, my bus is a
&gt;walk thru with a s0-42 interior. i am very much indebtted and will check
&gt;out the rest of the &quot;M&quot; code options tonight.
&gt;
&gt;keep ya posted!
