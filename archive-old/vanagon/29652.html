&gt;
&gt;A word of experience -- using something rigid but flexible is much
&gt;better than using something rigid and inflexible.  If you don't
&gt;already know how fast the piston is going to come up when you turn the
&gt;engine over, it's quite possible to have a screwdriver get caught at
&gt;an angle, with the possible consequence of scoring the cylinder wall
&gt;and or damaging the rim of the spark plug hole.

Uh, guys... you ARE turning the engine over by hand, aren't you?



&gt;Note that it's a little tricky to figure out the exact TDC using this
&gt;method, as there's some tolerance in the mechanical parts involved.
&gt;Besides normal tolerance, the piston will sit effectively still for a
&gt;few degrees at the top and bottom of the stroke, while the crankshaft
&gt;decides to push/pull instead of pull/push.

Here's an old Indian trick:

Turn the engine clockwise till the piston touches the screwdriver, and
make a mark on the pulley next to the crankcase crack. Then turn the engine
COUNTERclockwise (backward) until the piston once again touches the
screwdriver. Make another mark on the pulley.

Split the difference between the two marks, and that's TDC.

Detail stuff:
Obviously, you must have the screwdriver inserted a little farther than
exact TDC. Doesn't matter how much, as long as it's &quot;a little deeper&quot;.
But you must be careful not to move it AT ALL between forward and
backward crankings. Again, obviously.

Try this several times, to make sure. When your split-the-difference mark
comes out in exactly the same place each time, you're there.
