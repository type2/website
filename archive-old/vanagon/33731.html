&gt;That said, with all the buses burning to the ground, engine and electrical
&gt;problems I've read about, I'd like for list members to tell us why they
&gt;stay with VWs -- some more positive messages, for balance.

By the same token, Jim, you would have to conclude that airline travel
is terribly dangerous, since all you hear about are the crashes. But it's
a well-kept secret that many planes take off, fly to their desinations, and
land just fine-- lots of buses do this too!   :^)

Of course, all the air-cooled ones are at least 13 years old, and have the
typical problems and maintenance requirements that any older car does.


&gt;4WD would be great, I thought, so why not a Syncro? Not so cheap, those.

Sure, if you need it. Personally, I drove my first bus ('69) for three years
in Summit County, Colorado, mostly at 9000 feet and above, where they
average 160 inches of snow per year, and foot-thick dumps are routine.
In that time, I carried chains-- and never once had to put them on, even 
when
towing other (lesser) cars out of snowdrifts!

If you're going to do a lot of off-roading in rough country, then yes, you
may need 4WD. Other than that, I wouldn't bother if I were you.


&gt;Camping's fun too! -- also a premium.

Baloney. Leave your center seat at home, throw a sleeping bag or two and
a hibachi in back, and head for the high lonesome. Been there, done that.
You can sleep in or out of the bus, but use the hibachi outside only.
Bring a friend.


&gt;post what it costs them to own a wasserboxer. Insurance costs, oil/gas,

I've never owned a wasserboxer, and have only the same info you have, from
this list, which as I've pointed out isn't a comprehensive evaluation.
I do have an '80 Vanagon, formerly air-cooled, but now it has a Chevrolet
2800 V6 engine in it, and a radiator up front. Keeps up with traffic nicely,
handles well, and doesn't have some of the problems that seem chronic to
VW watercooled engines (fingers crossed!). Try it, you'll like it. It's a
big job, but you get bragging rights afterward.

I didn't do this conversion, BTW-- bought it this way from the previous
owner who did it. He did some things well, other things a little sloppy,
and I'm cleaning up stuff as I go. But after some introductory pain, it's
been VERY solid and reliable, on two 1,000-mile-plus trips. Quiet, too,
and it didn't even notice the snowstorm over the Grapevine last Christmas.
