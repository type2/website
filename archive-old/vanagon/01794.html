Subject:      hi-speed hijinks

well, i am ashamed to admit it, but i have 'cruised' for a while at 85mph
in my 80 vanagon. it was really screaming, though ... i think it was up
around 5000 rpm or at least in that neighborhood. really felt strange to
watch the road and countryside fly by at that speed, especially sitting up
so high.

i've also gone that fast in my 88 bus, but not for very long.

now, in that mercedes 300E, we got up to 120mph before i chickened out ...
smooth, quiet, and still had 2000 rpm left before redline!!! whooaaaaaaaaa!
(can you say 'Alabama Autobahn?!!)   :)

p.s. oh, yeah, there were 95 nekkid wimmen, 3 goats, and a large watermelon
in my 80 bus when i made that speed run. ;) you bet. fer sure.
