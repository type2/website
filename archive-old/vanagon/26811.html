Subject: Re: Syncros and Winter

Matt,

I've had extensive experience with my 87 Syncro in winter conditions and find
it to be amazing. On a couple of occasions, I've had friends leave their 4x4
trucks (toyota, full size chevy) by the road and ride home with
me--especially on ice.

The Syncro seems to have great balance &amp; stability, not only for forward
travel, but in braking and cornering. And the one thing I really like is
having the all wheel drive already working before you actually need
it--unlike typical systems that require you to engage the 4-wheel drive.
Often, it's too late &amp; you're out of control by the time you realize &quot;I
should have had this in 4wd&quot;!

Mine has the locking rear diff, but I generally don't need it unless I'm on
bare ice. I do a lot of towing in the winter &amp; find the extra weight is no
problem whatsoever, though I have noticed a difference in traction due to
tire design. Last winter (and now) I had on tires with a closer rib pattern
and I noticed some spinning--which was unusual--and less stopping traction.
It wasn't bad, just worse that than the old set.

Another theory I have is that the vehicle is not overpowered, and therefore,
it's more &quot;graceful&quot;, making it a better balance for pulling on bad surfaces.
That may be nonsense, but I'd sure put the thing up against any other 4wd
vehicle I've ever driven. I would drive circles around my Audi Quattro on bad
roads!
