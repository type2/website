Putting on my best Hans &amp; Franz impression:

Ja, Herr Ric, eef you weren't such a gurley-man unt changed der oel 
yurself, you vould haf plenty of oel under yur nails...(unt skin, unt
hair,
unt on zee eyeballs, up zee nose....)  Ja, unt best of all, yu'd
probably
haf soft tissue damage in yur lower baack, too, ja?!

OK, enough of that; I'm due up for that padset change too, so if I don't
read about the exploits of Ric inhaling asbestos dust on the list, I'll
drop you a line and fill you in on what you're missing...

PS-what does it mean when you get this metal-on-metal screeching sound?
