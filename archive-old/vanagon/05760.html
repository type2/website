Subject: Re: Dealer offers 10K for 91 Carat with 11.8K book value....is it a rip....
Date: Wed, 26 Oct 1994 23:32:07 -0500 (CDT)

&gt;
&gt;A ford Dealer offered me 10K for my 91 Vanagon Carat that has a wholesale
&gt;blue book value of 11.8K...Are they trying to rip me off?? They say that there
&gt;is not a market for VW Vanagons...and didnot believe that the blue book value
&gt;is realistic....(my van is in good shape).....Does anybody have any advice??

Blue book, schmue book. They have a different book for each occasion. I
found 5 publications listing used car prices: the Edmunds, the Red book,
the blue book, the NADA (yellow) blue book, and another which I can't
remember. All give a wholesale and a retail price, yet even within these
categories, prices vary substantially. I just sold our (very nice) 87
Civic. Wholesale price in those books ranged from $1450 to $3500; retail
price went as high as $5025 (all prices after adjustment for miles and
options). The dealer offered $1700 (second bid) and I refused. A week
later, he advertised an 86 Civic for $3995!

For your information, here are the prices of the NADA Official Used Car
Guide - Retail Consumer Edition (the yellow &quot;blue book&quot;) for Oct., Nov.,
Dec. 94:
