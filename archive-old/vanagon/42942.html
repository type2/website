So BusBoys_at_aol_dot_com says:

&gt; 
&gt; Originally, 80 to about 83 Westies had a Two Stage Regulator that was Round
&gt; (in fact it was also used on the 74-79 Westies as well).  Starting in 84, the
&gt; Regulator changed to a square style due to Federal Regulations dealing with
&gt; Motorhome-type gas appliances becoming more stringent to promote safety.
&gt;  Either is interchangeable, but I strongly recommend upgrading to the Square

So what makes the square valve safer than the round one?
