&gt; I got a call from a guy this morning who has an '85 Vanagon
&gt; with a problem.  *He* says his transmission (3rd gear) is
&gt; bad.  Do I know anyone who will work on it?  I ask what
&gt; happened to it.  He says he was driving along, smoke began
&gt; coming out behind him and from that point on he couldn't go
&gt; over 35 and into 3rd gear.
[snip!]
&gt; Are there any circumstances under which a manual
&gt; transmission will smoke (except after sex)? 

Is it that he doesn't have power to hold 3rd gear, or is it that he 
physically can't get the van into 3rd?  Smoking tranny: any oil in that 
puppy?  Sure it's the tranny?  If it's really a power problem, I'd look 
at the engine, but I doubt I needed to tell you that.

I wasn't aware of any chromosomal differences in transmissions.  This 
must have been a feature added in Vanagons--I couldn't find any reference 
to it in my '68-'79 bus Bentley manual.
