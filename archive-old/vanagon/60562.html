Subject: wheels and a headache

I cannot not seem to find someone who will know the answer to this
question. I hope that maybe you can help me. I would like to find nice
looking alloys rims for my van, hwever everywhere i've tried I an met whith
the same answer, &quot;nope, not a thing, sorry it looks like your out of luck.&quot;
Needless to say I am not happy with this answer. I understand that factory
Mercedes-Benz rims will fit just fine, from this can I assume that after
market rims that fit mercedes will fit vanagons?  If you have any
information on this subject or know of somebody who might know I would
really be grateful.
			thanks Scott Quinnett
