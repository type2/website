Subject: 	Pushrod tube seal question

Hi All,
Part of my preventive maintenance chores for this year are to change out
the (slightly) leaking pushrod tube seals on my 81 Westy, which I did
this past weekend.  Noticed that there was lot of silicon sealant around
the seals, but chalked that up to sloppy work on the PO's part.  Well now
they leak MUCH BETTER than they did before and I'm wondering if there's a
technique to this that I'm not aware of.  Any advice would be greatly
appreciated as I plan on staunching the flow this coming weekend.
Jack
