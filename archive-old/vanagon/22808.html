Subject: Re: Drug Caution: Old Vehicles

     When I bought my '78 VW from a Portugeuse gentleman who said he had 
     used it on a trip to Morrocco and back (oh yes!) I found an old needle 
     behind the spare tire - so beware!
     
     My van has sliding doors on both sides - what does that suggest its 
     former prupose might have been as it was not a camper before.
