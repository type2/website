Instead of banging on it, I used a long enough bolt so I could just screw 
it in and gently pull it out.  I also put a bar across the face of the 
flywheel and put the bolt through that and put a nut on &quot;this&quot; side of 
the bar and screwed on the nut to pull on the washer which pulled on the 
bearing. (Took mine out without destroying anything).  I can't remember 
which one worked better, but I bent the bar and really had to torque on 
it.
