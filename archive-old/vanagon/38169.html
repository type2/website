Subject: Re: Vanagon Side step


&gt;&gt; Hi Volks,
&gt;&gt;    I was wondering, is there a side step for a Vanagon like they have for
&gt;&gt; the Bubble window buses?   I've been racking my brain to remember if I've
&gt;&gt; ever seen one.  If they did, does anyone have one they would like to sell?

This thread about side steps reminded me about a passing thought I had a
while back about using the jack points to mount &quot;L&quot; shaped brackets so that
you could carry large (long and wide) sheets of plywood for roofing or any
other project.  You'd need something on the rain gutter or mounted to the
roof to secure the top of the wood and probably something rubber against the
side of the van to protect the paint/bodywork.  I'm curious if anyone rigged
up something like this.
