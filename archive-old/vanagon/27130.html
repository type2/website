Bob,

It's a coincidence that you mention making a roadtrip to DC area, as I
am planning a road trip through that area during the Thanksgiving week.
I am going to Connecticut. I used to live in Charlottesville,Va and am
planning a stop there.

If it is not too much to ask, would you mind looking out for inexpensive
campers.  If I am not mistaken there are a number Vanagon listmembers in
the DC,MD,VA area. If you or anyone in the area come across a Camper
that is inexpensive, and are willing to check it out for me let me know,
would be eternally grateful.

Cheers,

David
