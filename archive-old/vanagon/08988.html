&gt; Seasons greeting to all,
&gt; I still have a bit of a problem with my van ('73 kombi 1700), the blue smoke problem
&gt; of a week or so ago is fixed, somebody competent is working on the van now :), at
&gt; the same garage though... It was tappets and they fixed it at no more cost....
&gt; BUT. Compression on Cylinder on right at back (No 2?) was 0. So my engine is
&gt; now out and head off. The piston in question looks as though Christmas was a
&gt; good one. It is melted? curved closest to where the plug is. The plug also seems
&gt; to be longer than the one on the adjoining cylinder.
&gt; What is it that could cause the excessive heat that seems to have done this?
&gt; Is it now just a case of getting a new piston, rings etc or is there something
&gt; more deep and meaningful that needs doing...
&gt; Is there anything else I should look at whilst the engine is out.
&gt; I know, I know, lots of questions so near the new year, but any advice,
&gt; erroneous or otherwise will be lapped up.

Hmmm a single  melted piston could be due to a leak in the cylinder head
brought on by that head running hot (ie this usually happens when the head
has come loose, the valves are set too tight or the mixture is lean). You
may want to consider having case savers installed and also checking if
plug inserts (helicoils) were installed or need to be installed. The
question of what to do depends largely on what kind of mileage you expect
in the long run and the money involved. To replace one piston and its rings
makes little sense (and may be dangerous); so the right route to go would
be to consider replacing all four pistons their rings and at least the
exhaust valves (and possibly the valve guides if they are worn). Others are
better suited to tell you the prices involved in doing this kind of
project. The long term perspective is to consider splitting the case and
having a look at the bearings for wear. This advice is based on the
assumption that the engine is already out and the additional labour of doing
this work is not that great if a) you don't need the engine right away and b)
you do it yourself. 


Th next thing to do would be to look into the range of compression for the
other cylinders (are all but the one at the high end? are some also
marginal?)  How long have you had the engine and how long do you want to
keep it? DC
