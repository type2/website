&gt;Boy, that's an understatement.  Gosh, I sure love paying my CA taxes
&gt;when I hear about the DMV paying 40 big ones (that's 40 million folks)

Steve,

	You're wrong.  That was one-hundred-forty million.  Sad, but true. And 
recent reports indicate that it is much higher.  Hmm, looks like I'm
in the wrong business.

	Another DMW horror story:

	I bought my '56 without title.  This necessitated me doing some
legwork, contacting the 3 previous owners and getting the paperwork
together.  I turned everything in August 3rd.  I also ordered Historical
Vehicle plates.

	Last week, I called to ask why my plates weren't here yet.  It seems
that since one of the previous owners had died, there was a totally 
different form to fill out, but nobody mentioned that when I was in the
office, and I did mention it and it was stated in plain writing on the
returned envolope from the guy, and the lady who sold it to him also 
mentioned it in  her letter.  But the dimwits at the DMW office where I 
went didn't know that.   

	THen the kicker.  They sent all of my stuff back to me, and to the 
wrong address!  In fact, it went to an address that doesn't even _exist_!

	So, now I have to start over, and they won't accept photocopies of the
stuff I already did!

	But why didn't they tell me anything before the end of September, when
they mailed it all?  They had my right address for the registration!  How
could they possibly send it to the wrong address?  When I made a follow
up call, they told me to wait two weeks and &quot;we'll see if it shows up.&quot;
Yeah, right!

Thom
