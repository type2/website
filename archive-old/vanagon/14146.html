Subject: RE: 6v wipers on 12v bus


&gt;&gt; twelve volt motors are two speed, so not only do they work right, but
&gt;&gt; they work better than the old single speed six volt wipers.
&gt;
&gt;My 6V has two speeds.  And on 12V it's fast, and really fast.  But they 
&gt;don't work very well anyway.
&gt;

Type II's went to 2-speed wiper motors in 1966.  My 66 Westy's 2 speeds
are very slow and barely creeping (still 6V).  Running a 6V motor at
12V will reduce lifespan of wiper motor.  Better to use a voltage drop
or get a wiper motor out of a 67 (ha! good luck!).
