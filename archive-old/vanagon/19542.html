So thom fig-fitzpatrick says:
&gt;
&gt;       She slides in around 9 or so,  to find me asleep on the couch.  When I
&gt; hear her come in the door, I jump up excitedly and start telling her about my
&gt; new find.  She is in absolute disbelief!  SO I take her outside to show her
&gt; &quot;close your eyes&quot; says I!  And we go out, and the bus is gone.  The whole thing
&gt; was a dream!  And if you got this far into the message, take the hook out of
&gt; your mouth and go have some more nite crawlers.  Happy friday.

Aw Thom!  You had me hook/line and sinker!!!!  :[  How can you BE SO CRUEL!!!!
The whole time I'm reading, I'm going, what year? Whats the YEAR?!?  I should've
known with that tip-off...  :I   You DOG!  Well, I think you deserve to be
sent ALL of Martha's pickled figs!!!  ;)
