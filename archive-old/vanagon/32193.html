Subject: Heat Exchanger repair

Howdy,

While working on my 78 westie I noticed that the heat exchanger tin is 
 corroding around the front of the unit. The flanges and all other 
 parts of the exhaust are a bit rusty but still solid. My question is - 
 does someone make a kit to replace just the outer tin and if not, can 
 you weld a replacement portion up to the remaining tin?  I would hate 
 to have to shell out $400 for a replacement set. Also I have a bonus 
 question- is there an easy way to remove a brake drum? The left side 
 came off like a charm but the right side is stuck. I have beat on it, 
 backed one adjuster (the other is frozen) all the way off, but it is 
 still stuck, anyone got any ideas?

Thanks again
Clay

78 westie
