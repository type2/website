&gt;          hey there.  today's my first day on the list and i'm just
&gt;          gonna go fer it.  i have '66 kombibus with six pop out
&gt;          windows.  all frames are rusted to where they cant be used
&gt;          and they leak.  Help!  i've heard that the inner seals are a
&gt;          pain so i guess i'm looking for intact
&gt;          windows/frames/hardware as best case scenario.  frames alone
&gt;          are second best as i can get new seals from west coast
&gt;          metric and use my glass.  anyone got some they'll sell and
&gt;          ship to florida?  anyone know of aftermarket availability?
&gt;          not desperate, but very desirous.  thanks

Calm down.

First of all, it is not very difficult to redo the seals in the frames
at all, not even a little bit.

If you can have the windows off for a few days, then this is what you 
should do (and I have)

1) disassemble the windows.  Take the outside rubber off first,
   and then you will see the little screws that hold the two
   pieces together.  If they are real rusted, do Step 2 now, and
   then try to get them out.  If they still won't come out,
   or someone has hosed them, then drill them out with a small
   bit and then get the screw out with vise grips.
   There are 2 sets of screws on each window, get both sets off
   before you start musclinganything!

2) soak the frames in your favorite stripper (chemical, not human :)    
   and/or de-ruster.  I user either CLR (Phosphoric Acid) or San Teen
   (Hydrochloric Acid) Naval Jelly (Phosphoric Acid) or Blotter (LSD)
Acid poem:
	
	We had little Johnny,
	Now Johnny is no more
	For what he thought was H20
	Was H2SO4

3) When the frames are spiffy, pain them your favoritew color, or the
   color of the bus.  I use an enamel paint 'cause  they take some
   abuse.  If you have the bread ahead, have them powder coated! 

4) This is the perfect time to tint the glass if you feel so inclined.  
   I don't think there is an easier tint job than a small flat piece
   of glass!

6) Assemble:

	Wrap the inner (glass-to frame) rubber around the glass.   
	Get some dishwashing liquid to make it easier to slide on
	Hold one frame half with one hand and slide the window w/rubber
    onto it, and then slide the other frame down onto that.
	Once you have the two halves together, put the screws in.
	Using liberal amounts of dishwashing liquid, put the frame-to-body
    rubber on.
	Install the window.
	Glue the outer seal to the body, and you're done!

It took me a about 3 hours to do 6 windows to assemble.  The first one 
took the longest 'cause I had to figger out all this stuff I'm telling you.
The cleaning and painting will be the longest part, and that will depend
on what materials you use.  The HCL works much faster than the CLR, but
its nasty to work with.

You can figure that the window seals you have are prolly the originals,
so the new ones will prolly last another 25 years or so.

&quot;Jeff&quot; at Wolfsburg West told me thet are going to start offering repro
popout frames, but they will be getting $60 _each_ for them!  OUCH!
