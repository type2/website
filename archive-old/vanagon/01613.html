Subject: Re:  Joint Thoughts

&gt; 
&gt; It used to be that when a joint went bad I would replace it and that was it.
&gt; Now I get into the habit of looking at all of the joints and just checking
&gt; them to be sure.  I think that it should be part of regular maintenance of
&gt; checking the joints instead of waiting until the damage is done.  If a joint
&gt; is not badly damage I have been able to extend its life by cleaning up and 
&gt; repacking it.  I have done this several times.  I did this on my rabbit truck
&gt; (the noises were LOUD especially driving for 50 miles) and got 20K miles out
&gt; of one bad joint before replacing it.  I have not tried flipping the joints
&gt; around but it seems to be a good idea.

 One of my cv joints started banging so loudly, it sounded like someone was
hitting the side of my Bus with a baseball bat!  I removed them, cleaned
and inspected them thoroughly, repacked them with grease, reinstalled them
in the same orientation, and so far they've lasted almost 10,000 miles.
When I inspected them, a few of the balls had started to turn slightly
blue (hmmm....taken out of context, this would sound like an entirely
different subject!), but, given the price of new ones, I decided to go for
it anyway.  So far, so good.
