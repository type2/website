I sent this off last night, but apparently, it didn't make it. Sorry if
this is a repost after all.

&gt;The new BBTA flyer came in the mail today. Here's the reader's digest:
&gt;
&gt;BUS EXTRAVAGANZA
&gt;	DOUBLE RIVER CROSSING
&gt;		GREAT NEW LOCATION 
&gt;			SEPT. 1, 2, &amp; 3RD, 1995  O'FALLON, MO
&gt;
&gt;The new site is at Cherokee Lakes and Campgrounds just about seven miles
&gt;of the old location. This privately run facility is located on Hwy. 79
&gt;seven miles off Interstate 70 and is about 35 miles west of downtown
&gt;St.Louis and the Gateway Arch. The area reserved for our event has both
&gt;open, grassy and shady, wooded camping areas.
&gt;
&gt;Event fee is $7 and the campsite rate is $10 per vehicle and per night.
&gt;
&gt;More directions: 
&gt;
&gt;If coming from the West (Interstate70), get off at exit #217, O'Fallon and
&gt;turn left going under the overpass and proceeding North on Main St., which
&gt;turns into Hwy. M, three miles. Turn left onto Hwy. 79 and go three miles
&gt;to campground entrance on right. 
&gt;
&gt;If coming from the East, get off at exit #220, Hwy. 79/Elsberry/Louisiana
&gt;and head North 7.5 miles to campground entrance at right.
