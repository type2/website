Subject: 73-79 Bus items for sale

A mystery.  I saw my list of items for sale (which I orginally posted about
two months ago) on the list dated 6/1/96.  I did not post this.  Most items
are sold.  Here is what is left.

Roof Rack, 1/2 size all metal
Trailer Hitch, bolts to the bumper bracket, the bumper then bolts to it.
Front window channels, new
Starter/Alternator Wiring Harness (New OEM)
Steward-Warner Gas Heater(perfect for summer use)
Pair, Valve covers (72-79)
Fly wheel (from 76 MT)
Bead for sliding door cover (new)

If interested, please contact me.
