Subject: Insurance Co. Regulation (was RE: BUSES, VALUE &amp; RESALE)

Public Citizen, in Washington DC, the group founded by Ralph Nader, is very
active in lobbying government to control insurance company rates, etc.  Many
states have their own chapters of this organization.  In Texas, it's called
Texas Citizen Action, based in Austin and Dallas.
