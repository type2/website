Subject: Front hub dust caps -- stuck!

Folks:
I'm replacing the front brake rotors on our '88 Westy for the 
first time, and I can't get the dust caps off!  The ones that
cover the spindle nuts, that is.  The Bentley
book calls as usual for Tool XYZ39555Q; Haynes just says
to use &quot;judicious tapping and levering&quot;.  Well, I've tapped and
levered until I'm weary and disgusted.  I don't want to haul off
and batter the things, but I've applied all the force I dare.

To add a note of mystery, on the driver's side the cap has a
little square hole in it (a little less than 1/4&quot; square) and
there's a, uh, thing sticking out of it, bright metal,
square in cross-section, with a little groove around it
and a C-ring in the groove.  It looks something like the 
back end of a small machine tap.  There was silicone sealant
smeared over the thing to keep water out.  We bought the 
van almost new (7000 miles on it), so I assume the dealer
did this, whatever it is.  (The passenger-side cap has no
such ornament.)

I've never had trouble getting these things off any other vehicle
I've owned.  Any quick tricks?

Also, does anybody know offhand what size socket I'm going to need
for the nut?

Thanks...
Ted Zateslo
