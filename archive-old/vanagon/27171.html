OK, here's some more from the same article, &quot;The Awakening and Deliverance 
of a Cold-Weather Kombie Zombie, Part Four:  Und so weiter,&quot; by
John Lago.

[Our story so far:  John has progressed from a wood-burning stove
heating his van to trying gasoline (uh, big mistake, his friends
keep asking him &quot;What happened to your hair, already, and how come
you ain't got no eyebrows?&quot;) to using fuel oil.]

There was an added benefit to using fuel oil.  It's a 
benefit I later called &quot;The Great Anti-American Smokeout.&quot;  Even though
I was now driving in total warm and fuzzy winter comfort, there was
still the annoyance of close-following drivers of American cars.  
If they insisted on taking too much fun out of my winter driving by pressing
their big, sweaty grilles too close to my virgin little tailpipe,
I'd &quot;ink&quot; them.  I'd reach down and momentarily twist the fuel
valve full on, which would send a huge cloud of greasy black smoke
up the stack.  In the rear-view mirror you could watch the dirty
mass surround the car behind you.  Sometimes you could even see
the wipers start up.  One thing you didn't see though, was them
trying to hook back up to your tailpipe.  Not the same day, anyway.

A friend of mine, Al, took it one step further.  &quot;Oh, yeah?&quot; he said,
when he heard of my setup, &quot;I got me and all-season jobbie.&quot;  His
inker worked right from the engine.  Winter, Spring, Summer, and Fall.
What he did was pull a windshield washer assembly out of a junk
vehicle.  Then he installed it in his own vehicle so that the
washer line fed into the throat of the carburetor.  Whenever a driver got
too close, Al would hit the button and high-rev the engine.  Of course
he had diesel fuel in the wash bottle, instead of windshield washer
fluid, which would get sucked into the racing cylinders
and be converted from a little squirt of yellow oil to a 
giant cloud of choking black smoke.  The engine would dog back,
momentarily, Al would say, but would go on to say that
fouling the plugs for a few seconds was worth it.  For him it
was the ultimate ongoing prank.  He even had a motto.  &quot;One small
squirt from mankind, one giant step backward for tailgaters.&quot;
