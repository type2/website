Subject: 78 westie to buy or not?
Date: Mon, 17 Jun 1996 21:02:42 -0400 (EDT)

I am thinking about buying a 1978 westie having only had experience with vanagons i have a few questions for all you experts out there:

1. What is a fair going price for 1978 westie with fairly clean interior, good sounding engine, bad tires, rusty drivers door (needs replaced) some rust but solid under rear fenders, needs painted ( chunks of old paint are starting to fall of has been stored outside for last 10 years, canvas on tent has some holes but rest is solid.

2. What kind of availability and pricing on drives side door?

3. How expensive and easy is it to replace and reglue rubber around top seal?

4. Can the fiber glass top be painted or refinished? Do you need special paint or sealer.

5. Any inheriant problems with 78 or its engine to double check or fear for future problems.

thanks anthony
