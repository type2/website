Hello,

This VW location has changed owners many times in the 20+ years that I have 
lived in Phoenix.  I have not been impressed with the competence of their 
parts folks, but haven't been in to see them for the last 2 months when it 
changed from Verdone to Walser.

However, I don't think that it's too important that they know what they're 
doing if they are given a list of VW part numbers to work from.  Of course, 
with the history of the location, there could be some risk that company A 
collects the money, and company B takes over and says &quot;what money?&quot;

I would hate to get in the middle of things, but I live about 3 miles from 
them.  If you have specific concerns send mail to me and I'll check it out.

BTW, how do we qualify for these prices?

Mike
