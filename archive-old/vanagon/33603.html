&gt; Today I priced a new set of tires for the 81 camper and found that the
&gt; reinforced sidewall specification adds about $25 to the price of each. My
&gt; question is does the higher load range tire benefit normal daily driving or
&gt; does it anticipate loading 9 people with all their luggage on a 70 mph desert
&gt; run? In other words, is the heavier tire necessary for safe operation in
&gt; light to medium duty?

Both.  The reinforced sidewalls will help in cornering and high wind 
situations, as well as max load times. 

&gt; 
&gt; The PO had regular tires, two of which would be keepers. If the right answer
&gt; is to upgrade to the reinforced tires, would it be a problem to mix two and
&gt; two until those need replacing?

I've done it on my van without problems until I could afford to upgrade 
the tires to reinforced.

&gt; Thanks for your opinions,
