Subject: '90 watertank float diags... help

Hi Everyone.  I've been having problems with proper led indication of 
water level on my '90 Westy, and I've been doing some diagnostics to 
determine what has failed.  

I used a digital Ohm-meter to measure the resistance of the float at 
the three points along the rod, and I have recorded the following 
values:

green 0.3 ohms
yellow 0.6 megaohms
red      1.0 megaohms

My display panel only shows green and yellow... *sometimes*.. all 
with an empty tank!  The '90 model has a long rod that has a float 
that goes up and down indicating the water level by some magnetic 
type switches inside the rod (my theory).  

&gt;From my diags, it would seem the float assembly is OK.  If someone 
could verify these settings for me, that would be great.  It *does* 
require some work by emptying your stuff out, and removing the float 
assembly, and unhooking the wires (use long needle nose pliers to 
unhook the wires).  

Personally, I think there is something wrong with the display panel, 
but I need to know if this is OK first.  Any other ideas are welcome. 
 The Bentley diagnostics for the display panel are NOT for the '90 
model panel.  My panel is different in design than what is displayed 
in the Bentley, and the diags don't work for me. :(

Any help would be appreciated.
Harry.
