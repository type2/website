About the curtains for your Westy:
I made a replacement set for my boyfriend's '71 camper. I don't
have a pattern for them, but you don't really need one - measure
all the rails (n.b. some rails have two curtains on them) , add
three inches to each curtain measurment for hems, measure for 
required length (n.b. some need to be longer than others).
Very important: sketch the van, noting which measurements are
for which curtain, and when you make them up, label the actual
fabric aswell. 
Alternatively, muddle them all up, lose the sketch, sew the 
header tape to the wrong side so the groovey pattern faces
the wrong way, lose all the little plastic runners, lose the
little metal retainers so they fall off every time you draw the
curtains, and have a huge row with your girl/boy friend about it.
And cry.

The curtains look great now, by the way. Even it the pattern does
face inwards. We like it that way, really.

more Prozac)
