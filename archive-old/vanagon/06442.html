&gt; There is a place in Laguna Beach that rents 'falias.  But you
&gt; said you'll probably fly to Oregon or Washington.  But if
&gt; you have some big goolies, you could fly to Orange County
&gt; and RT up the CA coast to Oregon or Washington.

I'm a wanabus down in San Diego, but am interested in getting
a phone number for the place in Orange County.  Haven't checked
for this sort of thing in SD, but plan on it.

Mind posting that number?
