&gt; Hi, if anyone has either of these tires could you describe the tread pattern 
&gt; for me. The dealers here don't know exactly what's what.  ie. Yoko is 
&gt; 'ribbed', well, so am I FWIW! Any other 8ply tires out there, barring 
&gt; Gislaved (sp?) which I can't get here. TIA   tim s.

Hi Tim.  I have the Yokohama Y370 tires on my Syncro.  They are a 6 
ply rated, 1765 pounds _at_65 psi, and are excellent.  They have an 
all-terrain/all-season tread pattern.  Generally very quiet, and very 
strong.  I run them at 43 psi front/53 psi rear, and am very pleased 
with the traction and performance they give.  They can handle these 
vans very easily, and have a very strong sidewall.  I am on my second 
set of the Y370's, and highly recommend them all Vanagon owners.  
They have near perfect balance (one tire has NO weights on it, and 
the other 3 have less than half ounce), and are nicely made.  They 
may be a little more $$$ but they are worth it if you push the van 
hard in corners, etc.  They are excellent in winter, summer, mud, and 
good for 4-wheeling.

Harry.
