Subject: Re: A 90 Diesel? What the heck is this?
From: alun jenkins &lt;alun_at_krypton.win-uk_dot_net&gt;

 
&gt;We don't got no 90 diesels in USA. This is the only 90 diesel I ever heard
&gt;of. Wow. 
&gt;
&gt;Makes sense that you are posting from the UK. 
&gt;
&gt;EXOTIC fellow on our list.
&gt;
&gt;Now to get serious: what kind of manuals do you dudes over there in the UK
&gt;use? It must not be the Bentley manual that we got here in the USA, since
&gt;there is no Bentley manual here for your car.

The VW is a 1990 Brick (about the last made before the eurovan)
looks just like any other but has a 1700 normally aspirated oil
burner in the back. I have a real good manual for it published by
Peter Russek in the UK, he does manuals for all the range of VW
trannies and I will post more details here about where you can get
it from. The manual covers all aspects of the standard VW kit even
the turbo, although dire waring are given about playing with it
yourself !
My van was orginally owned by the local VW delaer (guess what no
service history) and was coverted to a 4 berth by Leisuredrive,
2 Doubles, Kitchen (fridge and cooker) and  blown air heating (Joy
oh Joy, toasty on winter days and nights).
