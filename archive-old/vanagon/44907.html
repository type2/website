I did indeed by it from Transform.

I don't remember the details of the warranty when I bought it, but it
certainly wasn't for five years.  Even if it was, I don't have the
documentation to prove it, so there's not a whole lot I'd expect to
get from calling them.

Also, there's some chance it was installed incorrectly.  I know I
didn't do anything about adjusting the shifter after I got it in, and
if it wasn't pulling all the way forward, there's a case that that
caused the problems I'm seeing now.  It seems unlikely to me, but
I can't prove that that's not the case.

At this point, I think the right thing for me to do is simply replace
what's in there, and make sure I do it right this time (vendor choice
and installation).
