Subject: First Plea for Advice


Greetings, campers:

I am new to this group, but not to VWs.  I currently have a 77 Westphalia 
with a history of many miles and engines; and many problems.  Here's one 
that I could use some advice on...

I appears that the flex connection from the fill port to the tank is 
broken, resulting in gas sloshing out when I make hard left turns with 
more than 1/2 tank.  Any ideas on how to fix it without taking the engine 
and gas tank out to get at it?  Has anyone come up with a way to slip 
line it from the inside via the fill hole?
