Subject: continued chrome shop story


so i go down to charlie hammils today to get my new safari latches that
the chrome shop lost and were paying for.  i get on the road to go and get
re-embursed but decide to call them first.  the guy say's, gess what, we
found your parts.  well great, but now i have extra parts that i don't
need.  well, at least the found my old ones since i made them by hand for
my safari's.

aslo, just got 2 new set's of safari's this weekend.  both are real nice
and complete.  now if i just had a couple of nice bus's to put them on.

hope to see many of you So. Cal residents at the Spring Jamboree on the
5th.  look for my crewcab in the show.  

take care and God Bless
matt
