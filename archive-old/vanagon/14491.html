The &quot;How to Rebuild your VW&quot; book describes a procedure to test the
pumping ability of engines. A vacuum gauge must be connected to some
nipple on the intake manifold and the engine cranked (ignition wire
grounded). It says not to connect the gauge to a &quot;ported&quot; vacuum source,
whatever that means. (Don't have the book here, but I think that's what it
said.) This is probably what I did, though, because I got very low and
erratic readings. 

Could some kind soul describe to me where exactly I should hook up that
gauge on a late fuel injected bus (1975)? BTW, the engine is fine;
compression test gave me 110 psi on #3 and 120 psi on all others. 

Cheers!
