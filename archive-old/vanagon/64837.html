&gt; &lt;&lt; The terms Vanagon and EuroVan are to my knowledge exclusively North
&gt;  &gt; American labels. They are unknown over here (in the old world). They
&gt;  are
&gt;  &gt; genericly called  'Transporter'. The 8/9 seater versions are sometimes
&gt;
&gt;  &gt; labeled  'Bus'  and the more luxerious versions 'Caravelle'.
&gt;
&gt;  And in South Africa 'Microbus' and 'Kombi'.  Are these the original
&gt;  German names - Helmut? &gt;&gt;
&gt;
Here in Australia we have the Transporter (I have a 2.4 deisel one) and
the Caravelle.  We used to have kombi but the import duties these attract
are tose for a passenger car so they only import the plain van and the
Caravelle.
