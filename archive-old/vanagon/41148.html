Subject: RE: Vanagon Shocks


&gt;Just replaced the original shocks with a Monroe product called the
&gt;&quot;Trailbuster Gas LT&quot;  I am finding them to be more of a &quot;buttbuster&quot;
&gt;becauce they do offer a nice firm ride.  All in all though, I am very
&gt;impressed with this product.  Highway control is improved 110%, as is
&gt;braking control.  I no longer float between lanes.
&gt;
&gt;For those of you in the NW states, Les Schwab is offering these at
&gt;$27/shock, or $35/shock installed, Lifetime Warranty.  For those of you
&gt;familiar with the Gabriel shock, these seem to be a bit heavier-duty and
&gt;a bit of a firmer ride.

I find this interesting. A few months ago I replaced the shocks on the
'80 V6anagon with inexpensive shocks from Sears, made by Gabriel.
$16.99 each, and I installed them. They are a fairly soft shock, adequate
but not great, with lifetime warranty. If I had it to do over again (and not 
flat
broke like I was then), I'd use a firmer shock. These sound good.

Anyone know how much KYBs go for, for early-80s Vanagons?
They make a GR-2 for the rear, and a Gas-a-just for the front (or vice
versa-- do I have it backward?)

How about Konis? Bilsteins?
