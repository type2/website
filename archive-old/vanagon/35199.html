Subject: Mag. Screens(sliding door)

&gt;&gt;&gt;To those who responded I gave you the wrong Area code
Triad Magnetic Van Screens
910-769-2427&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;

To all those contemplating purchase of the magnetic screen which covers the
sliding door. We purchased it thinking &quot;what a great idea&quot;. It is, but only if
you have no hips. It only unzips enough to catch my hips &amp; I usually manage to
dislodge the stupid thing every time I go in or out. It is however, a good idea,
once you are firmly ensconced in the van for the evening!
