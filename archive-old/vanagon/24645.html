&gt; A nagging problem I have had with my 81 Westy through several engine
&gt; replacements (see 81 Westfalia Blues, posting) has been the sticking
&gt; starter solonoid.  On long trips, the transfer of heat from the engine to
&gt; the starter housing seems to overheat the solonoid, causing it to fail to
&gt; engage.  The cure is to crawl under with a tire iron and rap on the case,
&gt; then cross the hot leads to force a revolution.  Then my baby usually
&gt; engages and starts.  Anyone else had this problem, and found a cure?  Also,
&gt; if you know of a good retrofit air conditioning compressor fit, I would be
&gt; grateful!  Last rebuild my boat anchor disappeared.

I had this problem for years in my '79 bus as well.  What I eventually did was
have an aftermarket Ford solenoid put on IN ADDITION to the VW one that is
in there.  The advantage is that the Ford solenoid can be attached far 
enough from the enging area that the transfer of heat is avoided while the
VW is attached to the starter and so is limited to being next to the engine.
It has worked great so far, but I've only had it on there for 2 months or
so, so you might get a second opinion from some of the other list members.
