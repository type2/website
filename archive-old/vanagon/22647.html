Peter,

You don't need air; it's an unnecessary expense for restoration of one
vehicle.

Low-pressure, High-volume paint sprayers do a better job and are easier to
live with.

Unless you're chipping concrete, sand-blasting, riveting or have some
safety-related 'pneumatic-only' application, electric powered tools are less
expensive overall.  Besides, the smallest practical air-compressor starts at
about 3 hp; pneumatic tools demand high volume AND high pressure.  

Pneumatic tools were direct replacements for steam, mostly used for mining.
 Pneumatic hand tools came into vogue with the advent of all-metal aircraft.
 Not only was air the ideal power source for rivet guns, it was much safer;
trailing a lot of electrical power cords around an aluminum airframe isn't
exactly a good idea.  While still a standard in factories, pneumatic tools
have largely been replaced by inexpensive but powerful electrically powered
tools, partly because modern electrically powered tools are more durable than
their air-powered cousins, although pneumatics still have the edge in power..

It's very convenient to have compressed air piped around the shop, with the
220v, 5hp compressor and its 70 gallon tank tucked away in an out-building
where the noise won't bother anyone.  But compressed air would be pretty far
down on my list if I were planning a restoration.  What would come first?
 Probably a coffee pot.  

A used gas welding rig, including bottles and cart, costs about as much as a
cheap air compressor but is the kind of tool you'll use the rest of your
life, and one vital in any restoration.  Besides, you can heat your coffe
with it.
