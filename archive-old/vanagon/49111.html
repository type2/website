Subject: 85 Westy power steering rack

just had to replace the power steering rack and pump in my newly 
acquired 85 Westy. the job cost me about 575. the guy there said he 
got a great deal on the rack for 275. it sounded good in comparison 
to what he said the dealer would charge and from past dealer quotes 
I'm sure it's a bargain. anyhow the Westy runs great now and is a real joy 
to drive, still getting used to adjusting cornering speed tho...any 
suggestions? wider tires maybe...Thanks for any comments, 
information, etc.
