Subject: Eurovan exhaust rattles.

This message come t me from Member Jeff Adler.  Thought some of you
might be interested.  If you haven't heard of it before. Take care

To  all  eurovan owners. Does your  exhaust system rattle against the
cat.convertor ?. A  quick and easy repair is to rotate the hanger in
front of the muffler 180 degrees   and reinstall the rubber dounut. this
will hold the system away from the heat shield.   the whole job takes 5
minutes and the only tool needed is a 13 mm  wrench.  You' ll    enjoy
the quiet ride and people won't ask you &quot; what's wrong with your
van?                  Jeff  Adler
