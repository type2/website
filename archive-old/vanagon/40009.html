Subject: Re: Temp. gage

The quick and dirty answer: depends on where you put the sender.
I tried both at sparkplug and under the temp sender for the FI.

At the sparkplug: regular, city driving temp is 350F. Highway with 
headwind can take it up to 380-400F. Uphill towards Flagstaff, AZ, hot 
day, it actually hit 500F; that was probably stupid. Have no idea if this 
is justified, but I get uncomfortable when the temp stays around 370 and 
compells me to double-check valve clearance. You have hydraulic valves, 
so wouldn't need to do that, though.

At other location: about 50 degrees less also because more exposed to 
cooling air. So when you turn off the engine, the needle goes up. I don't 
remember this happening at the sparkplug.
