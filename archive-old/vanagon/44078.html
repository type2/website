Subject: 1968 VW camper Bus (cute!)

 I have a 1968 VW camper bus for sale:
 -white
 -good body- very cute
 -camper interior (lots of cabinets, fold out bed and fold out table.)
         fantastic for camping-we know from experience.
 -the catch:  the engine seized up on us a while back, and we don't have the
 money, time or experience to fix it.  Looking for someone who can.
 $800 obo
 I am in Eugene, Oregon.
