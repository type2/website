Subject: EV coolant leak - how to best deal with VWoA?

I posted a note last week describing a coolant leak in my 93 EV.  The leak
is in a plastic pipe that feeds the rear aux. heater.  Another lister,
Jack Lowry, has experienced the exact same problem and has since
posted a note to the list asking if others are losing coolant.  The fix,
as experienced by Jack, is extremely expensive, so I'm trying to get
VWoA to pay even though I'm 6K miles out of warranty. I feel the part 
is garbage for its intended use, and the replacement of it is impossible
without way too much labor.   If successful, maybe Jack can recover some 
money too.

So, my question to all you folks is: Do you have any recommended ways of
dealing with VWoA Customer Service?  Is there a way to negotiate with them
beyond just accepting what the Customer Service Rep.  tells you?

I've already got my case number assigned, and am waiting to hear from the
dealer now that they've verified there is a problem.

Thanks for any advice!
