Subject: Vanagon towing HEAVY loads


G'day all

The moment of truth has arrived! I am about to sell the trusty F100, but, 
my wife has suddenly got cold feet.

My neighbor, who is a great fan of american iron, says that the F100 will 
still be towing heavy loads when the VW is scrap!

Has anyone had experience towing heavy loads (1 ton or more) 
repeatedly for long distances, and has it had any dire consequences on 
the VW engine or transaxle?

Thanks for the advice as strangely?? my wife seems to have &quot;faith&quot; in 
your collective experience ( funny, she never listens to me ;))
