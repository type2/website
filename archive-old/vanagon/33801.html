Subject: AllData CD-ROM Shop Manual Campaign
Date: Fri, 26 Jan 1996 08:59:12 -0800 (PST)

Hi,

	This is not a plug, its a plea.

	As some of you know, I work for a company called AllData,
which sells shop manuals on CDROM.  The manuals have all the parts
listing, diagrams, shop times, repair procedures, diagnostic procedures,
etc.  The price is $25 for a particular year make and model 
(ie '91 Vanagon GL)  There is a Windows and DOS version (no Mac yet...)

	What I want to do is get a &quot;write-in&quot; campaign going to
convince them to carry old air-cooled VW stuff.  I talked to the
powers that be, and they said it would be a matter of determining
the economies of scale.

	So, what we need to do is demonstrate that there is a 
demand for it.  I asked if it was ok for people to e-mail him
to request it, and he said OK.  His name is Jonah Howells, his
email address is jonah_at_alldata_dot_com.

	Please e-mail him, tell him what kind of car(s) you have,
and to please consider carrying early air-cooled VW's.  We need to
have enuf people to make it seem like it's worthwhile.  If you have
friends who are not on this list, but are on the net, have them
e-mail him too!  Vote early and vote often!
