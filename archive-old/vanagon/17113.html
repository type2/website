Subject: Re: Wanna 90-91 syncro westy

&gt;Dream time....how about lo miles, primo condition, air cond., diff lock, 
&gt;and a poptop to boot!  Thanks to those who've come forward with 
&gt;suggestions or are looking out for me....

Roy Mathers at Hoch Motors in Santa Rosa, California (1hr north of SF) had
tracked down a 1990 Syncro for me with an insanely low mileage, something
like 24k miles.  You might want to give him at call at 707.584.1199.
