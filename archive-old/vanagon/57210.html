&gt; Excellent description for a sound that's kind of hard to describe.

Why, thank you. 

 This all reminded me of a short lived TV show that was the brainchild
of Sophia Coppola (spoiled daughter of Francis Ford Coppola) called
&quot;High Octane&quot;. It was on real late so I doubt that anyone caught it, but
in this one episode they asked a bunch of the local Hollywood air-heads
what 'high octane' meant to them. Well, as one might expect, the replies
ran the gambit from the ridiculous to the inane. 
 Based on my experience I'd say that most Americans are under the
impression that: more octane = more power. This wouldn't be a myth that
petroleum product advertisers are trying to perpetuate, now would it?
Hmmm?...

Just a thought,

Noel

don't wish to be uncouth. :)
