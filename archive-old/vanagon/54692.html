Subject:      Re: Blizzaks on the EC

Ric Golen notes the exceptional ice/snow traction on his EV using Blizzaks.
When I asked about them last year for my EV (When I bought a set for our 87
Audi 4k), I was told that they were not made in the 205/65-15 size for the
EV. This fall I asked the Tire Rack guys about Blizzaks for the EV and before
we could even get to the available sizes, I was told that Blizzak does NOT
make a REINFORCED tire (i.e. 7 plies total, 5 on tred, 2 on sidewall). SO....
Ric.....are your new Blizzaks 205/65/15's and are they REINFORCED? If not,
why did you feel ok about putting  non reinforced passenger car tires on the
2-ton EV?

As for the Nokian Hakkipeletas (sp?) I've heard they are excellent, but they
also do not come in this EV size and they are EXTREMELY hard to find in the
smaller size (185 or 195? 70-14's?) used on Vanagons.

I do concur with Ric's experience on the Blizzaks: in our Audi the traction
difference was like day and night.
