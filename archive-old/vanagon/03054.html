&gt;I haven't noticed one in mine.

but, yes, they do. it's the little silver box just above the oil filter.
it's 'cooled' by the engine coolant swirling around inside that little silver
box. remember: it's the thing with the rubber seals that can get brittle in
really cold weather and leak all your engine oil out!  someone on the list
had that happen to them a while back. :(
