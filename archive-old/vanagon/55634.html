Subject: Re: Changing tranny in 80 vgon options (fwd)

&gt;i found 2 , yes two, 1985 vanagons at my local salvage yard. 
&gt;one is a complete burnout, no tranny, has shortblock. 
&gt;
&gt;the other has the tranny(yaay) and all the other parts id need, save for
&gt;the hockey sticks for the shifter lever. Half shafts are gone, all
&gt;sheetmetal is there, has a shortblock...

You can't use a watercooled trans in a aircooled V-gon.
