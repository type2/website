&gt;A friend of mine just bought a '96 Grand Caravan with the 3.8 (?) L  V6.  
&gt;         a walk-thru.   :)
&gt;
&gt; 
&gt;- the side door has a 'new' latch that holds the door open on  inclines.....  
&gt;hrumpf.  new.  yeah, right.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;I also like the &quot;new&quot; driver's side sliding door.

There's lots of new things since Chysler INVENTED the mini van
I usually tell people I drive the 'original' minivan.
Unless of course they are a Pontiac type. Then I tell them I drive
a '76 Transport which confuses the hell out of them. They go to great
lengths to explain that Pontiac didn't start making them until 198x.
I then ask if they have mentioned this to Volkswagon, and if they are
right, who do I go see to get my money back Volkswagon, or Pontiac?
GREAT FUN!
