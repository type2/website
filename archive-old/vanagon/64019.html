Subject: looking for a Westy in NYC

Sorry to put this on the list, but it is VW related.

 I am looking for the fellow I wrote to a few weeks ago regarding the Westy
near the Bronx, NY. The e-mail address was something like
&quot;kirkus_at_sprynet_dot_com&quot;.

We have lost your number, but not lost interest in the Westy in Fleetwood.

Please write or call back!
