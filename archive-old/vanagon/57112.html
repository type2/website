 NO!! DON'T SAY THAT!!! I think that I tossed a couple of those things
into the spare VW parts piles in my horrendously disorganized garage.
You know, the kind of piles that have been known to hide spare parts
until years after you've already sold that vehicle!! Oh no, that means
I'll never get them back! Oh why did I have to remove that useless shelf
underneath the sink that hides the water pump...oh woe is me...what a
world...what a world...I'm melti n  g  ..  .

 Which brings up a good question, you didn't pay $9.00 for those
glorified thumbtacks, did you???
