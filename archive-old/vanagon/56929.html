&gt; I was hoping that in the near future I can make an adjustment in
&gt;      in the Syncro speedo for this error. Have you check into this
&gt;      at all?

No I haven't.  I do know that speedometer specialty shops can provide gear
ratio changes that allow a wide variety of tires to produce accurate odometer
readings.
