Jake and others:

I wasn't going to say anything, because I couldn't think of anything nice
to say today, because my EV GL REALLY tweaked my gain this evening!

It'd been running flawlessly for the past 8 months or so.  I'd ALMOST
forgotten about all the trouble I'd had last year, until...

Driving home this evening, it just died, with 3/4 of a tank of gas in it.
I was in rush hour traffic and it stalled.  Even in gear, it wouldn't fire
back up again, so I coasted into a wide spot along the freeway and waited
for a tow.  Lights and everything else work.  I can crank it and it'll
fire, but won't run.  Got it towed to the dealer I bought it at and left it
for the service idiots to mess up in the morning.  There was no clue that
anything was going to go wrong... except, and this is the ONLY thing amiss,
the clock was off a few hours when I got in it yesterday morning.  Then
last night it was off again!  I just reset it this morning and went to
work.  Note:  The stalling feels exactly like the problem I had last year,
which resulted in the dealer replacing the battery, the computer, the fuel
injection system and the exhaust system.  What's left??

On the transmission:  Look up my post from last Dec or Jan on the troubles
I've had with this car.  Transmission had to be dismantled twice and gears
and shifters replaced (manual), and I'm not convinced it was done right.

I tell ya, if the problem is the same as it was last year, I'm baggin' it!
I really like the layout of the EV, but I'd buy another of those silly
Jellybean vans, or maybe even one of those ridiculous Chrysler Depot Hacks
before I'd put up with worrying about this thing just dying on me on a
two-rut road in the middle of the Utah desert or someplace (the kind of
places I like to go).

I'll find out tomorrow...  I hope.  Maybe I'll be civil then.

93 EV GL (possibly for sale, soon...)
60 Singlecab (unfortunately, I may have to sell this too)
29 Model A Ford (no way I'm selling this!)
