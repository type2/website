Subject: VW Thing Mailing List


Ok, with a little encouragement (pressure?  :), I've decided to
have a go at reviving the VW Thing List.  As I'm no real
nerd/hacker/geek, I'm going to attempt to do this manually, at
least initially.  Given the lack of activity on the previous
list, and relative low number of subscribers, I'm not expecting
a high volume number of messages.  If that changes, I'll look
into having .procmail run the list, or even into having netcom_dot_com
set up a mail alias for me and use their listserv.  In the meantime,
however, if you are interested in joining this list, please use
the instructions below.

To subscribe to the VW Thing list, please send regular e-mail
to me (busgirl_at_netcom_dot_com), indicating your desire to be a member
of the new list.  My plan is to save the incoming messages to
a file, and send them out to the subscribers one a day, possibly
more often as my schedule allows.  Should you wish to unsubscribe,
please use the above method as well.  I apologize that I'm not
yet adept at all this to be able to run the list in a conventional
way, i.e., with listserv, but I think it would be good not to
let the previous interest in this list-topic die, nor to lose
timely interest.

Thanks!
