Subject: MSDS; also, &quot;Who was that masked man?&quot;

Finally remembered to bring address for Martin Schneider Designed Systems.
They sell a kit that solves *some* of the problems involved in installing a
Porsche 6 in a Vanagon.  They assume some financial stability on the part of
the owner, as the kit itself is $1700 and they recommend an expensive 3.2liter
engine.  Their brochure shows a 6-cylinder Synchro lifting its front wheels.
They also sell a neat brush guard for the front of the Vanagon, and &quot;Bullet
Train Brakes&quot; including drilled rotors.

Also I forgot to get the name of the individual who suggested drilling and 
tapping broken Vanagon front stabilizer bar downlinks.  Please identify your-
self for the world's thanks; works like a champ.  I did one pair myself, badly,
drilling freehand, and then having proved the concept had a machine shop do
my other broken pair, which now look like they came that way from VW.  I used
a 10mm bolt.  The savings are substantial, as these parts are $65 apiece from
VW.  In my case the spacer tube that the downlinks fit into was rusted to its
seat -- probably the original reason for my repeated breakage.  Make sure that
it is free, or new, or omitted, when you put each side back together.  I
chose omitted.

Thanks again.
