Subject: 6V - 12V


Hi

I get the digest, so sorry, no quotes. You heard it all before anyway :)

A while ago, Thom asked r.e. 6V - 12V. Yes it is possible, and I would 
not recommend going 6V -&gt; 110V AC -&gt; 12V. Much too inefficient. I have a 
circuit somewhere that converts 12V -&gt; 24V. Something similar should 
work. But the best solution, methinks, is to use a switchmode PSU based 
on a Linear Technologies LT1070(?) requlator. This should give you 12V at 
about 1.5A from 6V _at_ 3A. I'll check using SwitcherCad, a program from LT 
do design these things.

Anyway, the real question is...

Thom, how do you get those _neat_ .sig quotes in your mail. _NOT_ by 
hand, I hope... I want it too....
