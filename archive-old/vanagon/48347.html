Extreme heat, cold, and chemicals (atmospheric pollutants) all conspire to 
destroy rubber and vinyl. UV in sunlight also contributes. The more you 
protect against these elements, the longer your rubber and vinyl will last. 
Periodic use of silicone-based conditioners will prolong the life of this 
stuff.

Wow, weird. My '82's were all cracked up at the corners and I just swapped
in the '84's.  I wonder what makes them do this?  Heat? Cold?  Some kind of
chemical getting on them?  Why was my '84s in such good shape?   Anyone 
else
seeing this or know why they disintegrate?
