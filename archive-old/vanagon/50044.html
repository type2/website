Subject: gas heater transplant from '78 bus to '81 vanagon?

Hi folks -- I have access to a gas heater in a '78 (or so) bus
for a reasonable price, and have thought about putting it in my
'81 Vanagon.  How similar are the two installations?  Anyone
know?

On another front, I have been unable to figure out how to
subscribe to the air-cooled list (or any other lenti.med.umn_dot_edu
list for that matter).  The listserv claims to have no lists
at all!  What am I missing?  Is it majordomo?  Help!  (I am
mailing this from a link at the archive site).  I used to be
on the vanagon list, then one day I stopped getting mail.
Never knew what happened...

Thanks :)

	Gary
