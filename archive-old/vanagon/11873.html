Subject: East coast gathering; me, Ko and the rain

Well, I showed up at the campground at about 6pm Friday night in soaking 
rain, circled the whole campsite loop, but nobody except the campground 
host and one other non VW party was there. Drove back to the gate to see 
if somebody was late and couldn't get in any more. The campground host 
had offered to unlock the gate in such case. When I met the park ranger 
she told me that two more VW's were there a few minutes ago and had left 
just before they closed the gate. I decided to stay set up camp and 
started working on all the food and different kinds of beverages I had 
brought 
with me. My four legged friend Ko (a 160pound great dane) also started to 
demand some food and wasn't to keen at all to get outside the bus. It 
even was to wet for a camp fire and a little lake was slowly developing 
around LILA. But nevertheless the mood was still up high since it's 
so nice laying dry inside listening to the rain hitting the roof with a 
full stomach of pasta diabolo and certain other liquids. So I finally 
faded away to the world of dreams and woke up the following morning. The 
weather didn't change a bit. The tarp I had attached to the rain gutters 
was broken down during the night because of all the water it had 
collected. I decided to drill holes into the rain gutters at the sliding 
door soon so that the tarp can be attached more easily without that gap 
between 
the roof and the tarp where for some reason the water likes to flow 
down. BTW this trip also prooved the performance of that rainX stuff. I 
had applied it on my windshield a few days ago and it's pretty impressive 
to see the water droplets running off the windshield like a water droplet 
on a hot plate. But I also agree that it can make you drive faster since 
you don't realize the rain that much any more. So I finally cleaned 
up the campsite and headed back home which is only about 20 miles away. 
I'm definitely in for another gathering in April at Umstead State park.
