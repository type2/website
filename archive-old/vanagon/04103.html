Subject: 6V to 12V gauge again!

Bradley M writes that he converted his 6V bus to 12V,
but didn't change the Fuel Gauge or Sender unit and
it work fine (I assume that also means it reads correct).

Can anyone else tell a similar tale ? I'd like some more
feedback before frying my Gauge and Sender.

Hey Bradley it's not that I don't believe you, it's that
my Delux Micro Bus wouldn't look neat in a kind of charcoal
black color scheme. Coz I figure that if you double the volts
then you double the current as well - gulp.

My solution is to make a 12-6V dc-dc converter to power up
the fuel gauge system (and the clock). But hey since Bradley
hasn't had fried gauge for breakfast yet then I'll go with
his knowledge.

Lee.
