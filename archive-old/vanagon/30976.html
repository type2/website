Subject: Dennis Haynes Is Coming! (&amp; syncro hitch run)

Important news, folks.

Long Island's legendary Vanagon mechanic/expert Dennis Haynes has finally
bought a computer and as of a few days ago I think he's on the list.

He is quite time pressed, but his knowledge of Vanagons is, incredibly,
probably better than (or at least equal to) anyone else on the list. His
address seems to be DHaynes57_at_aol_dot_com but I am going to suggest he change
this to DennisHaynes_at_aol_dot_com.

Anyway, if he actually begins to post here, you are in for a mind-expanding
experience. I think he's trying to learn Windows 95 and the AOL software all
at once, this being his first computer, so it may be a while until he gets
to posting. 

Dennis has an 87 Syncro Camper and has owned many other cool vanagons, like
a rare sunroof model. He told me the other day he's got at least two
Vanagons in his shop for repair and that he's rebuilding a syncro tranny, of
all feats. I hired him to install a custom gage panel in my van and to put
in a pre-luber for the motor and other cool stuff.

By the way, I have been trying to get Dennis to design and produce a special
run of his Class III trailer hitches just for us Syncro owners and other
Vanagon owners who like to drive off-road. He sounds willing. The idea
behind this special run is that the new hitches would not impede the
vehicle's departure angle the way his standard Class III hitches do. 

All who are interested in this improved Class III hitch are urged to write
to me so we can see how many units should be produced. As far as I am aware,
syncrohead_at_aol_dot_com was interested and I've got a guy in New Jersey but I'd
like to hear from some others. Dennis produces, to my knowledge, the only
Class III hitches sold in USA for Vanagon.
