&gt; 
&gt; I wish to mount this in my Vanagon and have been charging it with a
&gt; 5W solar trickle charger, which has already taken it from about 8V
&gt; (not charged since early winter) to about 11V.
&gt; 
&gt; So when do I stop charging it?  Do the charge indicators measure
&gt; voltage, e.g. do I stop when it hits about 13-14 V?  I don't want to
&gt; cook off the water.

I would find it very hard to believe that a 5 watt charger will ever
overcharge your battery. As the battery approaches its full charge state
its input impedence will rise and the charge rate will slow. Any
residual current will be too low to matter.
