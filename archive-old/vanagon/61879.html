&gt; Just would like to share this you folks....

&gt; My fuel pump got quite noisy last week and since I'm heading into the=20
&gt; backwoods for a couple of weeks of trout fishing I checked into prices
for=20
&gt; a spare.
&gt; Checked out 4 FLAPS and got prices ranging from $329 to $395 (Canadian)
for=20
&gt; the pump..._dot_decided to risk going without one.
&gt; Went to my local VW dealer to pick up some curtain hangers at noon toda=
y=20
&gt; and asked about fuel pump prices as an afterthought.
&gt; Surprise!!!!.....$219.00....and I quickly ordered one.
&gt; After being on this list for about a month I had stopped checking price=
s
at=20
&gt; VW dealerships because I had thought they would always be more expensiv=
e.
&gt; Maybe the parts guy made a mistake! Hope not though.
