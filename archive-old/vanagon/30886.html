&gt;I've often wondered about this: Do Buses tend to get pulled over more than
&gt;other vehicles because of supposed police prejudice?  I don't mean really
&gt;obvious, Grateful Dead style buses, just regular ones.  I'd hate to have to
&gt;deal with this, as I have been known to transport various &quot;magical&quot;
&gt;substances for friends.  I like those Owsley Bear stickers, too, but I
&gt;wonder how many folks are hip to the meaning of them. . .??

I have been pulled over several times in Utah by troopers who all say 
 the same thing &quot;I didn't see your front plate so I wanted to check , 
 by the way can I see your license and registration&quot; it almost sounds 
 rehearsed.  I am not your typical 'dead head', short hair, 
 conservative white male, and my van was a restored very clean 71 with 
 National Guard plates. The UHP has had a lot of success with profiles 
 in catching drug runners on I-15 and I-70 but is taking a lot of heat 
 from the ACLU for it.  Someone out there has a signature block that 
 says something along the line of if &quot;a nation that sacrifices freedom 
 for security achieves neither&quot;.  Amen brother.
