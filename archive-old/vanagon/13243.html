'87 Syncro 7 pass. with: tah dah... gas fired hot water heater!

I kid you not, it's tied into the coolant system, and has
a 24hr digital clock control panel on the dash for pre-warming
the van / motor when camping on the tundra. Heater fans must be ON to 
operate it. Supposedly runs for 1/2 hour max. Too bad it don't work!   tim s.
