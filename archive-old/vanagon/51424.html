How many times is someone going to &quot;discover&quot; this?

We oughta put in the FAQ the mention of the Electric bus  on the
Simpsons, the bus that gets squashed on the Simpsons, the bus in
Star trek, the bus in Back to the Future, the bus in Fast Times at
Ridgemont High, the bus in Mr Holland's Opus, the bus in the 
Dominoes commercial, the bus in the Sears commercial, the bus in...

And some poor guy thus wrote:

&gt; Well, for those who haven't yet seen this weeks Star Trek Voyager, there's
&gt; a bay window bus used as the &quot;getaway&quot; vehicle in one scene. It's got a
&gt; hatch on top too.
