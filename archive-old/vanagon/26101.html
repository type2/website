Subject: MI meet: Daly's Drive-in, Sat. 10/7

Howdy everyone,

	this is a reminder for the next southeast lower Michigan not.a.vw.club
meet, or &quot;Drive-in Meet II:  The Burger's Revenge.&quot;  The Chick-Inn meet
was so fun that we had to do it again!  New location this time; read on.

	We'll be meeting Saturday, 10/7 at the Daly's drive-in restaurant
on the corner of Ann Arbor Rd. &amp; Main Street in Plymouth, Michigan.  The
time to show up is between 5:15-5:45pm.  We'll be meeting rain or shine,
since there is an indoor seating area at the restaurant.  If the weather
isn't convertible-friendly, bring VW photos/toys/books/whatever to pass
around &amp; share!  If you need more detailed directions, visit the Web page
later today or email me.

	You can get the latest details on upcoming &amp; past events on
the not.a.vw.club Web page:

	http://www.umich_dot_edu/~gregm/not.a.vw.club

	Note that this coincides with the VW show in Indianapolis... if
you're interested in joining up with other folks who're going to Indy, 
contact Craig (clemoyne_at_umich_dot_edu).

	If you're a lurker, come join us!  No need to have a show-winning
VW, a dozen splitty busses hidden in a barn, or anything like that; just
come and hang out w/ fellow VW lovers!

See you Saturday!
