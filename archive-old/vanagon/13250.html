For those driving SOUTH on 680  (i.e. from Sacramento, thru Concord, Walnut 
Creek, etc.):
Merge onto Highway 24, going towards Oakland/Caldecott tunnel.
Take the turnoff entitled &quot;Central Lafayette/Moraga&quot;
        -       Turn Right (Southbound) on First Street
                --      Proceed past overpass to first stoplight
        -       Turn Right (West) on Mt. Diablo Blvd.
                --      Get into left lane ASAP
                --      Proceed one block to first stoplight
        -       Turn Left (Southbound) on Moraga Road
                --      Proceed 3.5 miles on Moraga Rd
        -       Turn Right (Westbound) on Devin
                --      Devin is first block past the stoplight at Donald
                --      House is third house on right (counting the corner 
house)

-----            

For those driving NORTH on 680 (i.e. from  San Jose area):

        -       Proceed Northbound on Interstate 680 to Walnut Creek
        -       Turn Left (Westbound) on Calif 24 toward Lafayette/Oakland 
(NOTE:  the turn is                      more of a split or &quot;Y&quot;  in the road 
than an offramp per se)
        -       Take third turnoff entitled &quot;Central Lafayette/Moraga&quot;
        -       Turn Right (Southbound) on First Street
                --      Proceed past overpass to first stoplight
        -       Turn Right (West) on Mt. Diablo Blvd.
                --      Get into left lane ASAP
                --      Proceed one block to first stoplight
        -       Turn Left (Southbound) on Moraga Road
                --      Proceed 3.5 miles on Moraga Rd
        -       Turn Right (Westbound) on Devin
                --      Devin is first block past the stoplight at Donald
                --      House is third house on right (counting the corner 
house)

-----      

For those coming thru the Caldecott tunnel from the OAKLAND side:

Take the third exit after the tunnel, called &quot;Orinda.&quot;  A
At the bottom of the exit, turn right onto Camino Pablo, which eventually 
changes names and becomes Moraga Road.  Proceed on this for approximately 4.5 
miles from the freeway.  It dead-ends in &quot;beautiful downtown Moraga,&quot; which 
doesn't contain a lot:  Safeway, Lucky, etc. 

At this light, turn left onto Moraga Road, and stay in the left lane.

Go approximately a mile or two, then turn left onto my street, Devin.
House is the third house on the right (counting the corner)

101 Devin Drive (has white wrought iron gates)                                 
  
Moraga, CA
