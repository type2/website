Subject: Valve Cover Slips...

Recently when I adjusted the valves and stuck the cover back on, I noticed
after I warmed the engine up that the right(front) valve cover was leaking.
Suspecting a faulty gasket, I replaced it immediately.

It leaked again, and then I noticed that the left side of the spring that
holds the valve cover on was not really sitting in the valve cover...in
fact, I could push the left side of the cover around...not good...

As it was late and dark and I wasn't sure how to remove the spring lever, I
took a cat food can and cut a piece of tin, shoving it between the valve
cover and the left side of the spring.  It holds it tight, but I was
wondering if anyone has ever had a similar problem and how I could go about
fixing it.

Regards,

Johnny
