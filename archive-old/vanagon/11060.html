&gt;   Because it hates you, of course. More seriously, if dirt got into the seal/
&gt;   shaft interface it may have worn a groove in the shaft which will contribute
&gt;   to the problem. Another thing to check is the breather vent for the trans-
&gt;   axle - If this has become clogged with grunge or mud [been out 4-wheeling?]
&gt;   the pressure increase inside the gearbox when it heats up may drive some
&gt;   oil past the seal.

Dave, thanks for the insight regarding the breather vent. I wasn't
aware that such a vent existed so tonight I'll check Bentley to see
where it resides.
