Vic;
If you want to test the core pinch off the lines then remove them from
the core. The core can then be slid out the side of the fan unit. I then
submerged the core in water and applied about five psi air pressure. If
you repair the core you will have to clean it good to get the smell of
anti-freeze out. 
Good Luck
