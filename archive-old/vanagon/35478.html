&gt;What I meant in my reply... was... how many people out there would get
&gt;it?

once you find out about someone who strangled themselves with a sports car,
it's a little hard to forget. :)  regardless of their previous accomplishments
and so forth, that's the sort of thing that sticks in your mind. like the

Won Wing Lo, the chinese pilot who invented landing in cross-winds. ;)
