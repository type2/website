Subject: rebuild or not to rebuild

On my way back to San Diego from Yosemite last week I blew the head gasket in my 82 westy. One of 
the piston rings is shot as well, so I'm agonizing over whether to rebuild the engine, buy a 
rebuilt engine.  

Anyone know a inexpensive, reliable (mutually exclusive?) place to have either option done down in 
San Diego?

thanx
