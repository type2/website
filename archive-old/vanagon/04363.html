Subject: Re: Shop Problems

&gt; 	My SO took her BMW 530i to the shop on the 9th (Fri) of this month to get
&gt; it adjusted to pass smog.  At the end of the day, she gets a bill for $95
&gt; and they tell us that before it can be smogged, we have to clean the EGR
&gt; valve, or they can do it for her for $XXX.00  The next day, I took it off
&gt; and cleaned it, no sweat.  The car ran good, but now the idle was low.
&gt; 
&gt; 	She takes it in the next Monday to have them finish up the smog.  She
&gt; gets the car back that night, and its running like shit (no power) and 
&gt; running way too hot.
&gt; 
&gt; 	She takes it back the next day, and tells them to fix it, so they have
&gt; it all day Tues and Wed, and she gets it back Thursday.  Its the same, now
&gt; only worse!  Only difference is that she's another $500+ poorer!
&gt; 
&gt; 	She takes it back Friday.  4:45pm I get a call from the shop asking me
&gt; to come down and look at a piece that was broken.  Turns out they decided



&gt; to disassemble the entire cooling system (rad, fan clutch, hoses, thermo
&gt; housing) and now are saying that we need a new thermostat, fan clutch, and
&gt; thermo housing, 'cause the bolt head on the thermo housing broke off.  The fan
&gt; clutch had some of the fins _freshly_ broken off.   They told me that it
&gt; was gonna cost $150 for a new thermo housing unless I either fixed the
&gt; one they broke, or got one myself.  I got one in a (PRICEY) BMW junkyard
&gt; for $35.
&gt; 
&gt; 	Monday comes and goes, and they still don't have the car together cause
&gt; they are waiting for a fan clutch from some place in Hayward.  You see, they
&gt; didn't want to get one from the dealer 'cause it was too much, so they are
&gt; gonna charge us $99 'cause thats what they would have paid the dealer, but
&gt; of course they are getting it for much less than that!
&gt; 
&gt; 	Tuesday comes and goes, and the car is s'posed to be done, but they won't
&gt; let her have the car 'cause they think now its the head gasket! (Blown?)
&gt; 
&gt; 	By now we are pissed, 'cause its been in there for a week and 1/2, and
&gt; it keeps getting worse!
&gt; 
&gt; 	What recourse would it seem we have here?  At this rate, she'll have a
&gt; new car in a matter of months!  We are guestimating that the most recent
&gt; set of repairs will cost around $500 or so, but they won't tell us yet.
&gt; 
&gt; 	She's thinking about stopping payment on the VISA charges for the stuff,
&gt; any ideas on that?
&gt; 
&gt; 	Now who gets to pay for getting the thing right?  She doesn't want to
&gt; keep having these geeks f**k with it, but she needs a working car!
&gt; 
&gt; 	Would she be entitled to have them spring for all of the stuff they broke?
&gt; People have told me that if a shop breaks a part, they have to fix it. 
&gt; Hell, what would keep them from breaking stuff at random to get the
&gt; labor and margin on the parts?   
&gt; 
&gt; 	Any suggestions would be appreciated!
&gt; 
&gt; 	She is already opening comm channels with Bureau of Auto Repair.  Would
&gt; the Better Business Bureau be of an help?  Small claims?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks in advance!

Man! What a can of worms!  

Regarding the broken part.  Did you or your wife give authorization for them
to fix or replace the broken part?  If so, I'm not sure you can do anything.
What's the name of this place so I can avoid them like the plague and also
let my friends know not to go there?  

Regarding the gasket leak, I'd have them put the car back together and get
it the Hell out of there and go elsewhere.  Even if it wasn't drivable.

They are just milking you for all they can.  I definately would not authorize
any more work other than to get the car put together and out of that garage.
