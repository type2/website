I have this thing too. We are doomed!

Big $$ to replace the Viscous Coupling. But you can drive around for a long
time like that. Just make the air pressure in all your tires exactly the
same and avoid tight turns!

&gt;my '89 westy syncro binds up really tight when its hot and i make a
&gt;sharp turn...like to turn around in a parking lot...the binding seems to
&gt;be more than what one would expect from the vc on a tight turn....its
&gt;almost like the brakes are on...the vehicle will not roll freely...and
&gt;it does not bind to this extent when not hot....
&gt;
&gt;am i doomed?  will changing the fluid help?  hurt?  i appreciate any
&gt;response....to this most disturbing symptom...effect....whatever...
