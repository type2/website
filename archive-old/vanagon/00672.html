&gt; 
&gt; P.S. I think the factory vent covers actually decompose automatically in the
&gt; presence of sunlight and then crack and fall apart. I bought some from Delta
&gt; Six. Delta six of north hollywood California. They told me at Delta Six that
&gt; they will sell at a huge discount in quantiy. Perhaps we should assemble a
&gt; group of us to buy 100 of these covers at the quantity price (along with some
&gt; skylights). 
&gt; 

Sounds good to me.  What would be the cost per cover after the discount?  Ditto
for the skylights?
