Subject: Re: gas mileage

&gt;We have been getting about 16 mpg on our '81 Westy for both town and city
&gt;driving.  This seems a little low to us.  How are your vans doing for
&gt;mileage?

Well, this should make you feel better......

I have a 1973 Campmobile that used to get a best of 17mpg, until the 1.7 
engine dropped a valve at 99,995 miles.  I replaced it with a 2.0 equipped 
with a Web cam, hydraulic lifters and dual Dellorto 45s.  The power is 
great, but now I get a best of a little over 15mpg and an average of about 
14.5mpg.  Based on other posts I've seen, I should be able to get 
better.....perhaps I'll start some tuning experiments soon.
