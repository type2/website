Sounds perfectly reasonable to me. Modern cars and trucks are so cloely 
similar to each other that an air cooled, rear engined micro bus really 
appears radical. Your typical modern passenger car has: front wheel 
drive, plastic bumpers, flush fit glass, streamlined look, etc. Your bus 
has character, which comes from having the courage to &quot;go your own way.&quot; 
a modern car only says &quot;me too.&quot;
