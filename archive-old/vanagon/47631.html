Yes, you should have a &quot;pro&quot; look at your particular installation.
This particular one you talked to probably is not a &quot;pro&quot;.

It seems he likes to make sure you _understand_ how complicated
his job is, and how big a dope you are because you can never
hope to comprehend this material; I run into these types at Radio
Shack sometimes. 

Try to find a no-nonsense place to look at your installation, who'll
put it to you in very simple terms (yes, it is possible) rather than
dazzle you with BS.

(listen to me -- I sound like I've lost my patience :-)

&gt;I had the same type of questions when trying to install a radio.  I 
&gt;took said radio to a local radio installer and asked them.  Very 
&gt;friendly and offered some advice.  Turns out on some of the newer 
&gt;equipment has to &quot;pull&quot; power rather than be &quot;fed&quot; as we usually 
&gt;do.  I has something to do with having a separate pwer supply or amp 
&gt;or something, anyway if in doubt have a pro look a your particular 
&gt;installation.  Same with speakers, more money  = more wires ! ?
