Subject: Gasoline/Exhaust Smell Advice Needed

I would like some advice regarding a gas/exhaust smell that seems to enter 
the interior of my '71 Westy via the heat channel.  My muffler, muffler 
gaskets and fresh air hose are leak free as far as I can see.  Also I have 
new &quot;rubber doughnut seals&quot; clamped firmly within the plastic 
accordian-like tubes to the heat exchangers.  So where's the leak?--Well, I 
have 2 possible suspects: 1) While my rear engine seal is perfectly mated 
to the engine tin, the front seal does not make contact, possibly providing 
a source for contaminated air to get sucked into the fan shroud (and of 
course this is bad for engine cooling).  But I don't think this is as 
likely a source of my problem (especially when the bus is cruising) as 2) 
The probability of a cracked or well-rusted pipe *within* my heat 
exchangers.  The heat exchanger sheet metal has no rust or perforations, 
although my control valves have rusted permanently open.  
	Has anyone out there ever dissected a heat exchanger and found such 
otherwise good heat exchanger? Any similar exhaust smell experiences or 
troubleshooting tips?  Your suggestions are much appreciated.  Thanks.
