Hi,

My sweet little '87 Syncro has the following peculiarity...

Sometimes, when pushing down the accelerator, the engine hesitates
and doesn't seem to be firing.  This behaviour is worse when rpms
are less than 2000.   Makes those burning-rubber starts a little 
difficult.  Engine must be under load in order to have it stumble.

This problem seems to be worse when the ambient air temperature is
&quot;warm&quot;, that is, over 65 degrees.  I _never_ have the problem when
I first start driving, although it will usually start within 30
seconds or minute of driving.  Cold weather keeps this behavior away
as well.

Any ideas?
