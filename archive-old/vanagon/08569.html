I put a 2 litre in my '70. The '70 should be the same as the '68
as in it has a cross panel at the back.

1) the tinware is different on these busses, (up to '71) from the later
versions . I hacked mine around, but if I did it again I would cut the later 
tinware from another bus and install it in mine. This way you would have
no problems getting the foam seal to work properly.

2) The engine mounting bar is different. On the early versions it has 
mountings spot welded to the chasis(sp) rails. The later mounting bar
is bolt on. I had to drill all the spot welds out and wave an angle
grinder at the old mounts to get them off.

3) The chasis rails are slightly closer together on the early bus. Not
a problem except that the mounting bar will have to have a couple of
inches cut off and new holes drilled. Easiest problem to remedy so far.

4) The biggest problem for me. The original 1600 gearbox bellhousing would
not except the 2 litre flywheel without fouling. (Not by much mind
you-some machining of the housing might do it?). I had to fit a flywheel 
from the 1.7 or 1.8 (I don't know which) to get round this one. 

5) The clutch release (throwout?) bearing on mine (and presumably on a '68) 
has a short body and on the clutch cover plate there is a spacer in the
center. On the later models the release bearing was longer and there was no
spacer on the cover plate. You can either use a later release bearing
or have the spacer fitted into the clutch cover of the later engine. 
Sounds wierd, but I went this route and it has been fine for almost 3 years.

The gearboxs obviously have different ratios in 4th, and you will find
that the bus is probably reving too high on the motorway and dosn't do
as many mpg as it could. On the plus side it will go up hills like you
won't believe and accelerate (as opposed to gradually gather momentum).

All in all I'm pleased I did mine, but in retrospect I would fit the
matching gearbox and engine bay tinware and remove most of the problems.

cheers
