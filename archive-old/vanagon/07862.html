Excerpts from audi: 8-Dec-94 Transporter Ute by &quot;King, Robert&quot;_at_tanelorn. 
&gt;   The company has produced a ute version of the Transporter based on the
&gt; chassis cab model which is priced at $27,490 for either a petrol or a diesel
&gt; version.
&gt; 
Does anyone know if the diesel engines in Eurovans in Europe, Australia,
etc.  are 4 cylinders or 5 cylinders like the one in my '81 Audi 5000
diesel?
