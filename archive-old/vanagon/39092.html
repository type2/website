&gt;what is a list sticker

it's a person that STICKS to the LIST, no matter how foolish or antagonistic
the email becomes. no matter how silly or angry or diatribical (? is that a
word??) the responses to a simple request for info about tires ... no matter
now idiotic certain lawyers get about their particular vehicles ... no matter
how much magnesium is thrown into the fire (or tuna fish, for that matter) ...
this person STICKS with it!!! that's a list sticker! :)


hey!! it's Friday, remember??? :)

(all you &quot;newbies&quot;, Friday's are reserved for stupid stuff and silliness. if
you feel like it. or not.)

in actual fact, a list sticker is a little stick-on emblem, made up by Richard
Palmer, for members of this list. a miniature version of the t-shirts he made
up previously. the t-shirts are great. i haven't &quot;gotten round&quot; to getting my
stickers yet ... :(   i'm still in groundhog mode ... waiting for the warmner
weather to thin my blood and get me moving.
