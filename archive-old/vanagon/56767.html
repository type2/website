Suggestions needed!  My oil light is flashing on idle after engine is
warmed up.  Oil level is OK.  Has not done this in the past.  Using
Castrol Syntec for last 60K miles (changed about every 5-6K).  Runs
fine.  Heads done at 55K.  107K on it now.  Should I be concerned?
RPM's at idle have not changed. It flickers a little, and as soon as the
engine comes off idle, it goes out.  Thanks in advance,

Ed
