Subject: RE: Air-Cooled Email list? 

There is a low volume list for air cooled VW's that is mainly for selling/buying.

Just send an e-mail message to:

		mailserv_at_cc.owu_dot_edu

In the body of the text write:

		subscribe aircldvw

Leave subject field blank.

I subscribed a week ago and, other than subscription confirmation, have recieved no traffic.

&gt;I recently unsubscribed from VintageVW, couldn't handle all the mail :-(
&gt;
&gt;But a friend mentioned that he heard there was an air-cooled list that was
&gt;mainly 'for sale' items. Has anyone heard of this? Does anyone know how to
&gt;subscribe?
