Subject: MICE in my 82 Westy


I posted this in the general vw group awhile back, and only got a reply 
from joel sying I should try it here.

While on a recent trip in Canada, I was visited just about every night by
mice in the van.  While they were generally easy to lure into my cooking 
pot and pasta strainer for easy removal, I would like to prevent them 
from getting inside in the first place.  Any similiar experiances? If so, 
how did you solve the problem?  

I have a 82 Westfalia.  I suspect that they are getting in somewhere in 
the front part of the van.  One night, I got underneath with a flashlight 
in hopes of shining the light through somewhere that my friend would 
see.  No luck with that method.  Joel mentioned the battery cable holes  
in the passenger seat battery box, but those are secure (rubber plugs)  

                       Thanks and Later,
                             Brad
