Just a warning to you people who insist on perpetuating these off-topic
strings, if you don't (please) exercise better judgement about what
_actually_ pertains to VWs, I WILL have no choice but to start posting
ultra-detailed descriptions of the lovely Moto Guzzi V50 motorcycle that
I just bought. Don't tempt me, I'll do it. There's only one thing that I
love gabbing on about endlessly (regardless of reader interest) more
than Volkswagens, and that's motorcycles! So just watch it, grrrr!
 
 If I wanted to hear discussion about the EPA and our unfair government
I would just turn on CNN! 

Meanwhile...

 Does anyone know which Rabbit/Golf/Jetta/etc, 90 amp alternator will
replace my '81's 65 amp. Like what year should I look for, and is it a
bolt on fit? Has anyone out there done this conversion? These are a
dime-a-dozen in the local junkyards. 

Thanks,
 
Noel
