hey there-

burned my clutch once on the grade goin' up hwy 80 in auburn once.  went to
&quot;yergen's shop&quot; in newcastle.  little german guy, seemed to know his stuff
although his shop was a mess.  real honest, stopped everything to replace my
clutch that morning, made it to reno that evening, that was 35k ago and
everythings been fine since.
