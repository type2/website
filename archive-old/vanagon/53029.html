&gt; As I recall, they
&gt;  have been examined in North Carolina, Missouri (Bap?), and Seattle (Rick
&gt;  Gordon). My local dealer says there are no plans to bring them in here
&gt;  until at least next spring and that they haven't even gone into production
&gt;  yet in Germany. He was told that at a New England regional sales meeting.
&gt;  This does not seem to jibe with the above info. Are the ones people have
&gt;  seen only Winnebagos? That could explain it.

I looked at a 97 EV at a VW dealer here in Southern California a couple weeks
ago.  And, yes it was the Winnebago camper conversion.  Not to be confused
with Winnebago's Rialta version.
