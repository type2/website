Subject: front wheel bearings

Brake Time.

i need to either resurface my rotors or replace them on my '87 as they are 
warped and pulsing when brakes are applied.  i'm not fond 
of resurfacing 'cause they seem to warp easily after that.  if i 
replace rotors, they come as a unit with the hub.  THIS means bearing 
replacement.

i'd done this on my '85 and it was a bugger of a job to get the old 
races out and new ones in.  i used a brass drift and a steel one at 
times.  didn't feel real good about the job because of the pounding 
it took to get the races to seat. i'd used some heat from a profane 
torch but it didn't make much difference, aside from making the hub 
greasy AND hot.  i felt like an amatuer and i was.

any hints on doing bearings?
should one just take the assembly to a shop and have 'em press them 
in?
opinions on rotor resurfacing?

ps.  'loaded' rebuilt calipers, ones with pads included, cost about 
$84 from the FLAPS.  i've been very pleased with just exchanging the 
questionable, somewhat sticky old calipers on high milers with 
rebuilts... and it seems when rotors start warping, a common reason 
is a sluggish caliper.
