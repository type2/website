Subject: Am I NUTS?????


Ok I went thru the same thing this past February when we bought my wife a 
Subaru Outback....back then I was willing to sell the EV to buy the 
subaru...

Well the crazies have struck again!!!! I have the opportunity to buy an 86 
Westy Synchro w/55k miles, original owner - third car in fleet, for approx 
$10k. The body is straight, the interior has hardly been used, etc...etc...

I've spoken to Tom Forhan, and he says its a good deal....

But the problem is that I have to sell the EV....so that begs two questions:

1. Am I crazy??? (ok.... as it applies to the above dilemma....)

2. Any one interested in a well taken care of EV/MV w/47k miles?


HELP!!!


Ric
