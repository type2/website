Subject: Thanks for diesel advice.

A quick note of thanks to the many people who
came out of the closet last week and admitted
to being diesel owners, answering the questions
I posted on starting up a '78 Rabbit that hadn't
been run in a while.  I found my tattered Bentley
manual and have just got in the Diesel Purge and
new glow plugs and will probably give it a go this
weekend.  I can't thank you all individually so
I post to the list, I'll tell everyone how it turns
out later.  Anyway thanks again, this outpouring of
info about something so evil as a Rabbit question has
me truly thankfull this list exists once again.
