Subject: I-95 CaraVAN to the Manassas BUG OUT

Another cool thing I forgot to mention about the BUG OUT is that there is a
Caravan of Volkswagens that starts with VW clubs up in Maine and they are
joined by other VW clubs as they progress south on I-95 to Manassas. Some
clubs try to coincide their times to join the procession, so you basically
end up with a long line of all kinds of VWs traveling south on I-95 at the
same time. Quite a sight to behold to see nothing but VW's in a line a few
miles long...

(Really pisses off the truckers, tho...  :&lt;)
