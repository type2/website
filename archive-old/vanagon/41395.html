Hello again, Volks...

First of all, I would like to extend thanks for the posts re:top speed of '81 
Vanagon....I would also like to clear up the matter of the query about the 
air-conditioning.  It is not that I would like to cool the interior....I was 
suggesting a thermostatically-controlled air temp. regulation system for the 
cooling of the engine!  Would this be too much like the perpetual motion stuff 
that I've been trying to figure out for years?  The alternator drives the 
inverter, which drives a pump that circulates coolant through the coils, which 
are mounted in the engine's cooling air ducts....switched on by engine temp. 
reaching &quot;bad trip&quot;......what dost thou think?

I am about to try to register this thing(from Washington) in California.  It has 
lived here before, but I am not sure about the &quot;impact fee&quot; and whether it means 
that I will be forking over even more to the DMV creeps, regardless of the fact 
that it passed smog....any info?

Lastly:  What is involved in replacing the original poptop canvas?  Edward has 
the one-window variety....is $350 for a three-window replacement through JC 
Whitney a good price?  

		Thanks from Michele and Gene
