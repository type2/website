Thank you all for your help, I just had the main seal replaced (again)
yesterday. This time the dealer had to pick up the cost under warranty. I
stayed with the van this time to watch them. It only took them 4 hours to
complete the job, this disturbs me because the first time they did it they
kept it and billed me for the whole 8 hour day. Is it customary for the
dealer to bill you for hours that they don't even spend on your vehicle?
Seems like a really bad way to do business if you ask me. Are there any
honest mechanics left out there? I should have the rest of my parts soon I
hope, then everything should be squared away for awhile. Has anyone had any
experience with changing the clutch master cylinder? All the Bentley gives
me is a diagram of the system. The help from Joel (thank you for your
opinions) on the slave cylinder should help there. I guess I am a little
crazy for my van too, it is VERY fun to drive, I drove the dealers loaner
Jetta (97) yesterday. I still prefer to drive my van, even compared to the
new vehicles that I driven lately. I guess some things just find their way
into your heart, but nothing does it quite the same as a VW van.
