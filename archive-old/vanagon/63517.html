&gt; Hi, anybody know of any websites w/ tent info (colors,etc?)
&gt;  I found a &quot;bus side tent&quot; but don't know what years it was from or if it
&gt; is even made by Westfalia.
&gt; anybody know anything about tents?  Joe Clark?
&gt; heres the specs, the seller doesnt know anything about it other than his
late
&gt; brother used it w/ his VW camper...
&gt; 
&gt; Color - Grey w/ 2 to 3&quot; stripes made up of red, green, blue &amp; blackSide
&gt; panels (2) - 68 x 102&quot;.  Snaps on top to fit w/ roof panel.  Tie down
loops
&gt; on bottom.   Roof - 54 x 99 x.  White fringe around edge.  Snaps to
connect
&gt; to side panels.  Ties to attach to frame. 
&gt; 
&gt; any help would be appreciated,
&gt; chris
