This is a way cool vehicle, saw one at the vintage meet here in Seattle a 
few weeks back. I talked to the owner and he said there were only 3 of 
these imported into North America. As he has one and imported another for 
someone in CA, this would be the third. May be a real collectors item in 
about ten years!

Saw in the Buy &amp; Sell today:

88 VW Doublecab, all wheel drive, 1of a kind, $18,995, Westminster VW

Is this a synchro?

Note that these are Canadian dollars.
