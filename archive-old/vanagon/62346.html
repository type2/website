&gt;         Sorry I can't help on the N.west repair question. However,
&gt; Eugene,OR
&gt; probably has the most aircooled buses on the West coast,IMHO.
&gt;  My travels will soon take me to San Fran via I-80 &gt; Tahoe&gt; Sac.&gt;SF.
&gt; Any
&gt; honest shops in that area anyone would care to recommend?
&gt; Not that I'll need 'em :0

    Here's one  in Tahoe:

    German Motors
    2750 Lake Forest Road
    Tahoe City
   (actually  in the Lake Forest subdivision a few miles east of
TahoeCity, very close to the
    municipal campground and beach at Lake Forest as well as a county
park)
    916 583 6220

    The guy guy that runs it is George Ritchey. They're a VW &quot;authorized
service&quot; place
    and are experts on Vanagons (especialy of the syncro variety) as
well as Audis. Their labor
    rate is  more reasonable than in the Bay Area.

    George seems to REALLY care about his customers' vehicles... We
spent a bunch of $$
    putting my wife's  91 Carat right while vacationing at Tahoe, last
year...a good thing we had
    two vehicles!
