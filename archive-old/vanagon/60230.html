Subject: Dometic Fridge

Conventional wisdom says the fridge should be operated only when the
vehicle is level.   What does this mean, and for how long.

Presumably it's not a problem if driving up a steep hill for 5 minutes.
What about parked on a hill for 25 minutes, or 2 hours?  After how much
time is there potentional damage being done to the unit?  Is the danger the
same, regardless of which of the 3 power modes is being used?

Also, how much off level are we talking.  My recently acquired 82 Westy
came with  front-back and side-side bubble levels.  Is a 5 or 10 degree
slope a problem for the fridge?  Anyone know at what degree there is
potential damage?

Many thanks
