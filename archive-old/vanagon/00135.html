Subject: Vanagon recalls...

I visited the dealer today about the recalls on our '90 Vanagon GL. The A/C
vent repair looks to be implimented intelligently. From the drawings it
looked like they put in a metal plate that runs the full width of the
inside of the duct and is about 4&quot; wide the other way.  Spring-washers
under the mount screws to keep them from backing out.  This design
precludes the need to repair any cracks that may already exist in the duct
- it captures the entire surface, instead of just a tiny area around the
screw.

The other recall is on the fuel injectors, they may leak air, making for
poor performance and stumbling.  The fix replaces all of the wet hardware
after the injector pump.  All of the tubes and the injectors.  The guys at
the dealer said this is about $1000 of work for free (a pretty good deal
for us for a vehicle with 95k miles on it).  I just hope that they don't
break something else in the process...
