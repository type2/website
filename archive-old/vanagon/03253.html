....and another thing. Don't get me wrong, there's nothing wrong with 
Eurovans. In fact they're probably the best made vans in their class. A 
Eurovan is faster, more reliable, more economical, quieter, more 
comfortable, has more space inside and is more practical all round than my 
old bus. But I don't want a van, I want a VW. They're just not the same thing.
