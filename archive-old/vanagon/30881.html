In the original Dirty Harry movie, toward the end, the Bad Guy commandeers
a school bus to blackmail the SF Mayor. Dirty Harry jumps on the roof, and
the Bad Guy grabs the wheel and slews the bus around trying to throw him
off. During the slewing around, he clobbers a formerly-pristine '60's
vintage bug.  R.I.P.

BTW, early in the movie, Eastwood is shown walking down the street in
San Fran, and you can see a gas station to one side, with gas prices
around $.35/gal!
