Lee,

You checked many items, but never seemed to suspect the starter.  I had a
slow cranking bus twice.  It was the starter.  What you described sounds
exactly like what happpened to me all winter.  I knew it was the starter,
because the generator checked out fine, and the battery was new.  I nursed
it along, trying to squeeze ever last bit of life out of the old starter.
Finally, I banged it a little too hard trying to get the solenoid to get
unstuck, and broke it.  It was very easy to replace.  Found out that the
previous owner was too lazy to put the two upper engine mounting bolts in.

Good luck!

Wolf
