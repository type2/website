Subject: Re: LHS Shower in Westie?

Plowed (or is it ploughed?) thru John Wakefield's discourse on showers for
Westie- I've taken kids to the shore and used a SUNSHOWER, a black plastic
solar heated container you place on the roof rack and take water from a
gravity-fed hose.  For a curtain, I've used (1) Split hula hoop with shower
curtain hung on it; fit into permanently fastened pipe ends on my roof
rack. (2) Another option is the blow-up shower curtain, which uses air
tubes and corners to suport the shape; hangs from a rod extending from
roof, from K-Mart. (3) Now we use our awning extended real low so people
can't see you, with towels hung over the ends and simple 3 qt. handled OJ
jugs also stored and warmed on the roof- does fine job of washing off the
sand!  A tube stuck over the faucet also works, it even siphons out by
itself for washing feet, but is cold water!  On rare occaision, for washing
hair, I heat up water in 2 qt. pot on stove and stick it in a large bicycle
water bottle and run it over the head for washing- works fine also.  In my
book, whatever takes the least space and is technologically simplest, or
util;izes what you already carry is best....Mike Benthin
