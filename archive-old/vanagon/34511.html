Subject: brake fl leak

I have what is now a big leak between the two brake fluid reseviors(?) on 
my 71 westy.  It is coming from the connection between the upper res (in 
the bus) and the one on top of the master cylinder, it seems the little 
rubber gasket gave up. I have looked around but have had luck in locating 
one. Does anyone know if they are available or an alternative solution.  
Thanks.
