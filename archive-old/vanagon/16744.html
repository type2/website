Glad to hear everybody's safe, sorry for your Westy...

We've always felt that the 'Bricks' were just about the safest
form of transportation, aside from Suburbans and 18-wheelers.
I guess the silver lining is that your poor Westy did not get
smacked in vain; things could have been a lot worse if your wife and
kid were in a Corolla or something...

 &gt; Hi y'all- 
 &gt; I've been pretty quiet lately... i work under somewhat the
 &gt; same atmosphere as Thom.  However, i need some consolation... our
 &gt; &quot;new&quot; 87 Westy just got pasted yesterday by an old man that didn't
 &gt; see it (TITAN RED mind you).  After he smacked into the middle of the
 &gt; drivers side his wife jumped out and said &quot;he just ran right into,
 &gt; didn't he.  i try to watch for him but he didn't stop&quot;  My wife, who
 &gt; was driving, and our 3 year old son are unhurt and safe so it
 &gt; could've been much worse.  now comes the frustration of insurance and
 &gt; repairs.  The worst part was that the man was totally self-centered 
 &gt; on his vehicle and did not apologize nor inquire if my wife and son 
 &gt; were hurt.  Not all old people are nice, grandfatherly types.
