Subject: Tranny Oil Question '66 Westy

Okay, I'm working on my '66 Westy which hasn't been driven in 13 years.
I'm replacing the axle boots because they're crumbly and one is actually
leaking oil.  I have both of the new boots and I'm wondering if I should
drain the oil completely and then refill the tranny with new oil.  My
manual says to use SAE 90 hypoid oil.  First of all, is this something I
can get at my FLAPS? and secondly, can I refill it myself?  The engine is
out right now so I can probably get to the fill plug from above.  All of
the pictures I've ever seen about this have a funky filler pipe thingy
that looks very professional (i.e. VW extra-super-duper-once-in-a-lifetime
tool #whatever).
A somewhat related question: I need an automatic transmission dipstick and
tube for a '73 bus.  Somehow, mine was lost in my mother's garage.  Does
anybody have one they don't need?

Thanks in advance
-Erik
