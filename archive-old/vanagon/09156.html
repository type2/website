&gt; Greetings,
&gt; 	I'm in dire need of a Digifant ECU for an '87 Vanagon. The
&gt; part number is &quot;025 906 022&quot; (it's not th 022A or B). Any help will
&gt; be greatly appreciated.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,

Gene, 

At this point, I really don't know where you'd get this ECU except
maybe at the local wrecking yard or probably one of the 'VW recycler&gt; 
type places down off of Sunrise Blvd in Rancho Cordova.

One question.  Are you sure you need this ECU?  If you're not, then
it may be a continuity problem or something else that may have been
discussed on this list.  Give us some background so that it can be
tossed around here for a bit.  We might come up with a solution.

Cheers!

Steven
