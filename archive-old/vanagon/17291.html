Subject: Re: Syncro Ball Joint

Derek sez;

&gt;I had a ball joint replaced on my syncro. It made a klunking sound.
&gt;
&gt;It cost about $2,000 to replace plus another $2,000 of diagnostic time.
&gt;Plus, of course, about $50 in parts plus other parts they replaced but
&gt;didn't have to.
&gt;
&gt;I am not kidding you--I have the receipts to prove it.
&gt;
&gt;All under warranty, of course.
&gt;
&gt;

I'm beginning to think that your dealership is running some sort of scam
whereby they fabricate ridiculously inflated labor charges for warranty
work on your Syncro (while they're actually doing non-warranty work on
someone else's car) and then pass the bills onto VoA for reimbursement.

There have probably been just enough problems with Syncros (and Corrados &amp;
other VW exotics) that it's easy for them to get away with this. VoA has
probably given them a blank check to fix all problems, &quot;whatever it takes.&quot;

It's either this, or the dealership's mechanics must have a really good
dealer themselves (if you know what I mean).

It would have been interesting - if you had the time - to actually sit
there for the 80 or so mechanics hours they claim it took to fix the
problem and just watch what was really done to the vehicle.
