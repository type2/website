&gt; I have a 1973 Campmobile that used to get a best of 17mpg, until the 1.7 
&gt; engine dropped a valve at 99,995 miles.  I replaced it with a 2.0 equipped 
&gt; with a Web cam, hydraulic lifters and dual Dellorto 45s.  The power is 
&gt; great, but now I get a best of a little over 15mpg and an average of about 
&gt; 14.5mpg.  Based on other posts I've seen, I should be able to get 
&gt; better.....perhaps I'll start some tuning experiments soon.

I used to get 19-21 on the highway with stock rebuilt solexes on my 73
bubble top, then I went to dual Webers and my mileage dropped to 14-16.
I recently got another set of Solexes and am eagerly anticipating the
return of good gas mileage...

p.s. Anyone wanna buy the Webers (dual carbs, manifolds, linkage, new air
	cleaners (chrome)) for $100 + shipping??
