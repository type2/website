Umm, my fires never get out of control.  But then I've never tried to put 
them out either. :)

On the sticker thing, I'd need at least 2, and 4 would be better for 
future buses, or aging of the old sticker.  Also... if I sell a bus to a 
non-computer, non-listy type... do I have to scrape the sticker?
