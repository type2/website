Is this the 6 cylinder unit or the higher compression 4 cylinder type 4 motor?
The 4 cylinder unit is essentiall that used in the '72 to '78 bus with some mods
to make it fit in the 911 and stand up to higher g loads and such.

&gt; Chris Gilbert inquires about price of conversion, which could be less than
&gt; $1000 not including the engine.  The engine itself is going to be in the
&gt; $2000 to $5000 range, higher if you &quot;need&quot; a Turbo or a late-80s engine.
&gt; 
&gt; Scary, but note that the engine will hold its value better than the van
&gt; does.  Unless you really blow it up, the engine is always going to have
&gt; a parts value of nearly $1000.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;From my reading, this is the easiest conversion for an amateur with an
&gt; aircooled van.  Waterpumper owners might do better with a waterpumper
&gt; conversion.
&gt; 
&gt; Go for it.
