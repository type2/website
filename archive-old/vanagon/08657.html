I dont think your one bit crazy!  I would love to own to vans, one from the
70's and one from the 80's.  
If your not in a hurry you can shop for a mid to late 70's bus that is in
good condition.  You will still have plenty of things you could do to it.

You might at some point want to add a micro bus to complete your impressive
looking driveway!
