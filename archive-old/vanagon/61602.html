David,
 After spending many months of pulling apart my fridge and cleaning and   
pulling everything apart to see how it worked I did get everything   
running (gas, fans).  After playing with it I have become very familiar   
with the design and operation of the unit.  I have put my refrigerator   
back in my van.  It works on the bench but gas still isn't cooling like   
120V.  I was able to get the fins to freeze on 120V but not with gas.  I   
didn't actually check with a thermometer.  On the 27th I'm going on a   
trip and after that I'll be able to report more completely on how it's   
operating.
 I do know that my thermostat is opening up for the second stage flame.   
 When you fridge is running there is always a pilot light that is burning   
supplied by a bypass gas jet that is attached to the thermostat.  When   
the cooling fins warm enough, the pressure sensor bulb which is in the   
refrigeration compartment expands and inflates a billow which opens the   
burner gas valve.  When this valve is open the cooling will happen.  In   
essence, it is dumping more gas into the burner creating a larger flame   
in order to heat more of the ammonia need for cooling.
 I would love to pull more of this type of information together in order   
to create a very complete and accurate archive on these Dometic   
refrigerators.  I have some text material on these mobile refrigerators   
with excellent pictures explaining the whole process in depth.  I don't   
have a scanner but would be willing to mail them to someone in order to   
do this.  From reading this tread for about 3 weeks it seems that people   
really want to learn about this stuff.
 If you want to go straight to the source here is Dometic's address and   
phone.  Maybe they have repair manuals or info.  ( I haven't talked to   
them yet)

 By the way, David, you said you paid $126 for a new thermostat.  What   
did that include (part wise) and did that include labor to install?  How   
did that come out.  I know that it was only the 14th that you posted that   
but I'm intrigued.  I know much of the stuff I just said you had already   
talked about previously.  Not trying to be redundant, just trying to get   
it out in the open for others to read.  Here are some good articles on   
Dometics that I found in our own archives.
