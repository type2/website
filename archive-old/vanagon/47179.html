&gt; Here we go with my THIRD (and last) post of the day, and hopefully of
&gt; the week:
&gt; 
&gt; My '87 Westy, 2.1 L wasserboxer engine, is getting only 17 mpg
&gt; highway.  That seems low to me.  Is it typical for the rest of you
&gt; guys with vans of similar age and equipment?
&gt; 
&gt; One contributing factor might be that it has the wrong tires --
&gt; 205/70R14 car tires, max load 1400 pounds.  It should have light-truck
&gt; tires, like the ones it was shipped with.  And having the wrong tires
&gt; often means lousy gas mileage.
&gt; 
My '88 w/165k on new engine gets 21-23 hwy, worst case about 19mpg 
hwy. I don't think tires should make that much of a difference if you 
run them at full pressure. I believe a bad O2 sensor can cause rich 
running and poor mileage - the Bentley should tell you how to test it.
