Vanagoners:

	After my new (rebuilt) engine at Pete Moore in Pensacola, FL, I asked the
service manager whether I needed to bring it back in so many hundred (or
thousand) miles for head retorquing. He told me that this was not needed.
	With the seals, etc... loosening the heads and then retightening would
mess up the seal, I would think.
	Does Yokohama make a 205/70 R14?  The Y370G is a 185/70 R14 isn't it?
