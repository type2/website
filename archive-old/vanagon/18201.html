Subject: Re: '87 westy surging ?

&gt;My wasserboxer motor is surging at idle.  I think I remember reading about
&gt;this problem on the list before so I will try the archives.  Meanwhile if
&gt;any of you have a clue as to what is happening the help would be welcome. 
&gt;The symtoms are constant surging between 900 and 1200 rpm after hot and at
&gt;at idle.

You're running between two 'set points' in the FI system. The idle 
stabilizer will stop controlling things around 1200 RPM, but won't let you 
drop below 800 or so. Below 800 it switches on and boosts gas flow into the 
injectors. It  switches off at 1200 and the main system would normally take 
over, but my main system didn't want to due to a bad airflow box. The engine 
then dropped off to 800 RPM at which point the stabilizer kicked in and 
repeated the cycle. When I had this surging, the dealers first cure was to 
jack up the idle rate to 1000RPM. It got the system working again. This 
prevented me from yo-yo-ing back and forth, but was too high. As the idle 
stabilizer and airbox failed more, the problem came back. Try the idle 
tune-up suggestion, check for a sticking flap or broken tracks in the air 
box (in a current topic/post). Do you have the updated harness? My '87 idles 
steadily but roughly, died once at highway speed, so I've got to get one 
soon.    tim s.
