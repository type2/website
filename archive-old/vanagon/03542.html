Subject: HELP! Need a Seattle mechanic!

	Like the header says, I'm in dire need of a new mechanic. I just 
blew a wad of cash to put a newly rebuilt 1600 into my 60 micro and I've 
got zero (read: 0, 0000.0000, zilch, nada, zip, NONE!) power. I mean half 
the power of my old engine which was overheating, running on three 
cylinders, and using a single port carb on a dual port engine. 
	Needless to say, I had a few words for this mechanic and we have 
parted company. This was the first time I worked with him. Now I'm in 
dire need of a recommendation from you wonderful folks out there for a 
good, reliable mechanic in the Seattle, WA area. 
	Please help before this road hazard I'm stuck with gets me a 
ticket, causes an accident or worse!

Thanks,

--Jonny

P.S. The culprit is:
     Mark
     Karma Ways
     8733 Greenwood Ave. N.
     Seattle WA 98107
     206-78-6376

If you've had good luck with this guy, that's your business but...

I WOULD STRONGLY RECOMMEND AVOIDING THIS MECHANIC!!!
