An Excellent Idea.  Here's my two bits worth:  

  Michelin MXL Reinforced  205/70R14    6/B/40          Horrid (squirrely)

However, I think the database should contain some additional fields, 
including:  

	Name of Submitter
	Vehicle Year/Model
	Date of Submittal
	Operating Pressure (as used)
	Traction (Good/Average/Poor)
	Braking  (Good/Average/Poor)
	Low Speed Handling (ie. turning)
	High Speed Handling (ie. tracking/stability and cross-wind resistance)
	Ride (Good/Average/Poor)
	Comments (Free form field;  won't be able to collate data, but 
	   might suggest other data fields for future inclusion).  

As I think, the difference in impressions regarding the MXL's shows, 
we're dealing with more variables here than just make and model of the 
tire.  Other &quot;system&quot; parameters, as well as &quot;performance&quot; parameters, 
must be taken into account.
