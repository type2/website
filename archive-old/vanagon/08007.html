Subject: vanagon cold oil warning system
Date: Mon, 12 Dec 94 10:03:00 EST

I and my trusty 87 vanagon have recently acquired a cold-oil warning
system that works as follows:   In weather colder than 45 deg, after van
sits more than 8-10 hours, get in, start, drive away.   After revs go
over 2500-3000 for a short period, combination low oil pressure and dive
warning horn comes on.   After the van is warm, warning light/horn never
comes on.  (the current solution is to idle the van until warm before
driving away).   

I dropped the van off in a panic at the dealer on the way to the
airport (since as we all know, these problems only appear right before
or during trips.)   They verified the cold behavior, checked the
pressure after it warmed up (apparently ok) and then changed the oil and
filter, and said maybe it was fixed... 

Predictably, this hasn't changed anything except my desire to return to
the dealer. So before I dig into things (and, yes, put a real pressure
gauge on it), does this fit any known problems?   Could a sticking
pressure relief valve behave this way?
