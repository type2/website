&gt;&gt; If they're not also gone from rust or whatever, that is. How does one
&gt;&gt; lose seat mounts due to rust??? Aren't they INSIDE the bus? That
&gt;&gt; must be one rusty vee-hick-yool. Is this the one that's getting its
&gt;&gt; cargo floor sections replaced?
&gt;
&gt;Yes, this is the same Bus that is getting the new cargo floor sections,
&gt;rockers, and outriggers.
&gt;
&gt;The mounts look like they were physically removed when one of the previous
&gt;owners put in the false Westy package mickey-mouse style.
&gt;
&gt;I repeat, I do not see *ANY* mounts on the floor for any seats/seat
&gt;belts.  I wish I did...
&gt;
&gt;I guess once I have the new floors in, I could put in whatever I want?  I
&gt;just would like to find out what was originally in this MicroBus.  Just
&gt;call me difficult. :-)


I prefer &quot;exacting&quot;. I'm that way about my bus sometimes.

I don't know any details about bus seating options, except for the obvious
points such as, 8-seat non-walk-thrus have a short 2-person middle seat
(like mine), while 9-seaters have a full-length middle seat.

I do wonder (speculation here) if the floor mounts are identical for
either configuration. Maybe the nine-seaters just have more sticking
out toward the sliding door, and maybe an extra seat-frame support
that extends down to the floor but isn't bolted down like the rest of
the supports are? Anybody out there have one of these full-length middle
seats, and can check and let us know?
