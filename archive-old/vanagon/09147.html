Subject: How to split case?

The 1700 type IV engine has almost reached a state of maximum entropy in my
basement but I am having trouble splitting the case.  All the bolts are
out, so I assume it is just the 20 year old gasket/sealant holding the case
together.  Is there an easy way to split the case without resorting to
potentially destructive measures?
