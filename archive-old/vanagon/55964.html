You mean a Westy weekender - not just a weekender.

Time for the weekly definition of a Westy weekender....
Lemme clear this up ONCE and for ALL... (that's what I said last time....:&lt;)

Westy weekender:
-Has poptop
-No stove/sink
-Has full length rear sofabed
-Has table that folds out from left wall.
-has fixed jumpseat behind driver
-has 1 cabinet in LR, and one overhead in back (if no a/c)
-has large removeable floor mounted fridge behind pass. seat

Weekender 
-7 pass. regular passenger van model
-middle seat w/ split fold down back
-rear sofabed with cushion over the engine

Verstehe??
