Subject: Re: FW: Milwaukee Auto Show--VWoA has no plans for Eurovan

Well, just chancing that VWoA may have some info I called them.  I asked 
the representative if and when a Eurovan (non-camper) would be available 
in the US market.  She said that the camper would be available later this 
year (thats funny, I just saw a '97 camper at a local dealer two days 
ago) and that a decision has not been made as to wether or not they are 
going to reintroduce a passenger van.

Personally, I'm ready to forget VW and my next vehicle will be a Land Rover.
