Subject: Website has moved - PLUS new additions

Well, it took all of today (Saturday) to change all of the page links and now
we are firmly entrenched at our new Website address.

New address is http://www.bus-boys_dot_com/  Please make a note of this if you
have your website(s) with our old link.

If you do go to http://www.c-zone_dot_net/jim96003/busboys.htm there will be a
&quot;moved&quot; message with a link to the new address.

If you have problems connecting to the new site, please E-Mail back to me.

New items added to the on-line catalog:  Steering Parts 3/55-79, Brake Parts
50-95 including Eurovan and the Fuel Infection Pages have some new goodies as
well.

More stuff to be loaded later next week (Westfalia, VDO, etc..)  Appreciate
the tremendous response, comments (both positive and negative), suggestions
and compliments to the work done thus far.  Burnin' alot of midnight oil on
this.
