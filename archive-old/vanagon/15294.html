Subject: Converting Bus motor to Upright

Somewhere in print i saw that someone was selling instructions for 
converting a newer bus motor to an upright one. Didn't need the info at 
the time but now I am considering sticking one out of an '82 Vanagon in 
the back of a Thing and would like to find that info now.

The plan would be to stick the bus's tranny in too. I have some info on 
that and a source for parts needed with no welding involved.

Anybody converted one to upright? Thoughts on the subject?
