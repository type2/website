So RGOLEN_at_umassd_dot_edu says:
&gt; 
&gt; Now all we gotta do is get one over here to this side of the
&gt; pond...and get Martha to pose in flannel in the fold-down
&gt; rear seat, and find some blond-big-breasted-bikini-BUS-bimbo
&gt; to pose in front, and guaranteed, we'll get into VW T&amp;A...oops
&gt; Trends yet!!!
&gt; 
&gt; ;-)
&gt; 

Now Ric, all you have to do for the blond bimbo is get yourself
a breast implant and a blond wig and just be yourself.  ;p

&quot;Payback Time!&quot;
