&gt; advance distributor.  I've traditionally set the timing to 0 TDC using a
&gt; timing strobe and all vacc. lines attached at 850 RPM and around 48
&gt; degrees of dwell (gas is always Shell Super Unleaded). 
&gt;

 If you are setting the timing at 0 degrees with the hoses attached, you are
 already advanced 5 degrees ahead of stock. If you want to set timing for max
 power, you may want to set it when it is fully advanced: It should be 
 something like 28 - 30 degrees BTDC at 3000 RPM. Advancing much more than 
 that is asking for trouble from detonation when the engine gets hot, IMHO.
