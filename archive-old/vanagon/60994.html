The O2 sensor is not working.  CO should be maintained below 1% at all times.  
Full throttle should bring it up to about 1.5%.  The rang you show indicates 
no regulation, or the ignition timing is too far advance causing air 
starvation at idle to maintain low RPM. These measurements are before the CAT. 
 After the cat, if all is okay, CO and HC should barely be measurable.

HELP ! 2.1 Digijet much to lean at higher rpm and load....

I have tested my 2.1 DJ Digijet engine on a Motor Teststand
(Rollenpr=FCfstand in German). At idle rpm it have 2.4 % CO 8 (thats OK!)
but when we pushed it to higher rpm like 3 - 4.000 and we put it under
load, it goes down under 0.3 % CO!!!! Thats not good, you can hear the
knocks inside !

After that we disconnect the Air connection from the fuel pressure
regulator, so the system have more fuel available the CO rise up to 0.9
%!=20
OK thats not they way to fix this problem, but where is the real defect
???

Any ideas ?
