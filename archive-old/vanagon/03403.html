Subject: anitfreeze

I called around asking for phosphate-free antifreeze yesterday and 
everyone said &quot;nope - ain't got none of that....&quot;
So, I went to Target to do some other shopping and stopped in at the 
automotive section and actually looked at the containers.  There were 
three brands, and two of them were phosphate free, Alpine and some 
Ecologically sound one..._dot_can't remember the name now.  Alpine said &quot;safe 
for Aluminum&quot; on the front, so I read the ingrediments and it was just 
alcohol.  Hope they didn't just leave it out. About $3.50 a gallon.

Also, the cooling system is supposed to hold just over 16 quarts;  16 
quarts=4 gallons, so I bought 2 gallons of antifreeze.  Is this going to 
be enough, or should I go back and get more?  Just wondering.

Since I found the stuff, I've decided to flush and refill the system  as 
long as I have to replace the water pump anyway.
