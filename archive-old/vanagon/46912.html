Subject: Wanted:Awning and trailer hitch for 1985 Westy

Hello Vanagonlist, I am looking for an awning for my westy. I placed an
order for an A&amp;E awning from Camp World and after a couple of weeks, I
called and found the order had not been sent. (Problem = billing address of
credit card different from shipping address) Problem was taken care of
(they said). After another 2-3 weeks still no awning. I called and they
stated the same problem. So I canceled the order! So does any one have an
awning for sale? Has anyone tried fabricating an awning using a tarp? If
so, could you give me some ideas for connecting to the van. Also looking
for a trailer hitch.
Charles
