&gt; Hi:
&gt; Three of us from the Pacific Northwest are starting to organize a
&gt; camping trip for mid to late September. If anyone else is interested
&gt; please contact me.
&gt; Gracias
&gt; Cris.


So far, we are three Washingtonians, two Oregonians, one British
Columbian and one Californian plus family, pets, etc. As far as a
location and duration I am totally open to suggestions. Northern Oregon
sounds like a good midpoint that would put everyone interested within a
day worth of travel. Due to the wide range we are covering, some of us
might need to take more than a weekend to do this.
I suggest the Cascades (Mt. Hood area) or even better: Eastern Oregon's
high altitude desert.(a little more adventurous, better chances of sunny
weather, and some really good spots). I can do more research if there is
interest in any of this.
Mt St Helens area was also mentioned.
Please keep on posting suggestions for location and dates. See if we can
all organize this. It would be nice to have this pretty much resolved by
the first week of September.
Also, I am going to announce the camping trip project in the Type II
list, see if there is any interest there.
Later.
Cris.
