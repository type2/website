Spotted in Auburn, CA:
'85 Westi 145K miles, with pedastal seat for 5th person.
$5900  at a used car dealer, call them direct not me 916-888-1515

Though if interested I could check it out further.
Was on lot for a day, was gone for 2, then back again,
don't know why, but worth asking. I drive by daily.
