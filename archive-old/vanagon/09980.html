Subject: Re: Bleeding cooling system

Alistair,

It's not pressurized?  It darned sure blew back in my face adn gave me 
some nasty burns when I foolishly unscrewed the cap once.  I'm talking 
about the cap on the coolant reservoir.  The one with the bleed hose that 
leads back to the overflow tank.  I'd assume it overflowed only over a 
certain pressure.  Now I'm going to have to look it all up so I know what 
I'm talking about.
