Greetings -

Since getting into the rear top hatched cabinets was impossible with 
the table stored over the hatches, I removed the hatches.  The kids 
can store their books, tapes, games, etc in there, and have access 
whilst driving.  Since I don't trust the screw tightening to hold the 
table in position, I added a hook on a bungee to the side wall to 
assure the table doesn't swing out into my kids.  With a long atrap 
affixed to the upper storage tray and to the same mount as the table 
bungee, I can store pillows and blankets on top of the table, readily 
accessible to the kids, and not fall over onto them.

The front table is stored behind the driver seat.  Since the empty 
battery slot under the driver seat is almost impossible to access. I 
removed the cover.  The table (corner anyway) fits into the hole laying 
against the door jamb.  Be sure the post is facing backwards, don't 
want a surprise in the backside.  The post is then lifted out and 
replaced between the table and the driver seat.  This also allows the 
battery space to be used for storage of a fire extinguisher, 
binoculars, etc.

&gt; My '85 came with one table. The height of the table was high enough to
&gt; fit either above the two top loading drawers next to rear seat or in the
&gt; front it could be slid partially above the stove leaving rear hatches 
&gt; accessible.
&gt; Getting into these storage areas is less convenient than before.
&gt; 
&gt; Where and how is that smaller table supposed to be stored for travel?
&gt; I see in the owners manual how it is set up for use but there is no
&gt; picture for where it belongs during travel.
