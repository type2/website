Hi from the east coast.

I had a similiar problem with my 84 westy with a 155k on it. I had the 
same sweaty palmed fear of leaky heads and the sick stomach thing of 
driving with the temp needle buried on the right side of the gauge and 
the damn red light flashing.

So for what it is worth try this:

Sometimes the problem is with the coolant level sensor itself. If you 
have the engine hatch off it is a black cap that screws into the top of 
the coolant reservoir (not the one you can see from license plate hatch, 
the other one to the left of that). It can fail and when it does it will 
give the symptoms of imminent meltdown of your engine. The part is cheap 
($15-20 Can) and you can do it yourself. 

You should also check, by removal and visual inspection, that the 
reservoir hasn't split along the seam. Mine did that. When that happens 
the only thing preventing meltdown is a plastic bladder inside the 
reservoir. You can't see the split because it happens on the side that is 
hidden from view. Maybe if you used a mirror and flashlight...?

Hope this helps. You can't really expect many scary vanagon episodes to 
be so easily and cheaply resolved but if it works for you I'll be happy 
with the good karma.

Good luck
