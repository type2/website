&gt; &gt; I retyped the document and I have it in TXT format should anybody want
&gt; &gt; to see it.  I didn't want to send the attachment to all 500+ of the
&gt; &gt; list as this information is only relevent to diesel owners.  If
&gt; &gt; anyone is interested, send me an email and I'll forward you a copy.
&gt; Yes, please... Thx.

&gt; I had noticed the ratings disappearing also, but had not seen any
&gt; official word about using SH in diesels. Some brands no longer
&gt; mention diesel in the desciptions on the bottle, which makes me
&gt; wonder. I had heard that CC/CD ratings also indicated an extra
&gt; additive package in the oil designed to combat the corrosive
&gt; conditions which build up in diesel engine oil over time.
&gt; Anyone know more on this?

You might want check around alittle more.  If you visit a truck stop,
you can find several bands of oil with CD/CE/CG/CH ratings.  These oils
are also approved by Cummins, Mercedes, Military, and (most important)
Caterpillar.  These oils surpass the SH rated oil.  Even Walmart has
special diesel oil that meet the above standards.  I have a friend who
put 190,000 miles on his car engine and 230,000 miles on his farm truck
engine; he always uses Wally's oil.
