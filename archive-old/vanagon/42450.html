Subject: '77 Westy: Interference between Bed and Table

In my '77 Westy the large table and its support pipe (which mounts on
the rear of the main cabinet) must be removed before the rear seat can
be converted into a bed.  Has anyone modified the rear seat bottom to
eliminate this interference?  It looks as if all it would take would
be an oval cut out, about one inch deep, in the plywood base -- the
upholstery would compress when the bed is pulled out against the
support pipe.

I am reluctant to take a saw to my camper, but it would sure be nice
to be able to pull out the bed without removing the table when I pull
dog tired off a highway into a rest stop.  I would greatly appreciate
advice from those who have considered this modification.
