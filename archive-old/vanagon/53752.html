Subject: Re: Need Advice on repairing rust areas


Here's what I did...first I took a screwdriver and scraped all the seam
sealer that I could out of the seams(both fronts, alittle in the rear).
Then I took my el cheapo sand blaster ($35) and blasted all teh rust that
I could see, then lasted a little more.  I was tempted to use a sanding
disk but I thought thet I would just end up cutting through the spot
welds.  Then I used One-Step rust converter/primer.  This stuff seems
really cool to me...it supposedly turns residual rust into some
non-harmful substance while protecting against future rust.  Of course I
dont know if it actually does what it claims.  I picked the One-Step up at
K-Mart.  Then I wet sanded the primer that One-step leaves.  My camper is
an '86 I looking at the archives I found that the only white in '86 was
Alpine white.  I went down to the FLAPaintS and they mixed me up 8 oz in
an aerosol jar.  I also picked up a tube of seam sealer.  When I got
home I filled the seams back up ith the seam sealer then painted over
the primer...I didn't use tape because I didn't want any lines.  All in
all the job looks very good.  The paint does not EXACTLY match, but you
wouldn't notice it if you didn't know to look.  I just did this procedure
so I can't say how long it will last.  I hope that helps.

&gt; What is the best way to do small areas of body rust-a few at a time?  
&gt; What should I use to sand with-what to prime with?  Our camper is white 
&gt; and has the typical small rust areas near the seams and on the front.
&gt; Does anyone know if they used &quot;clear coat&quot; over the paint on '85s?
&gt; Any advice would be appreciated.
