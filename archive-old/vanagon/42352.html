&gt;Jack and Jill went up the hill
&gt;to park the Karmann-Ghia,
they started to neck, they brake they didn't check,
and now the ghia's a wreck

Hickory Dickory Doc
A rod is starting to knock;
Green light too, oh what to do?
Bam!  Now I gotta get out and walk!

A is for apple,
B is for bush;
when you ride with Bradley,
ya gotta get out and push!

There once was a man from somewhere in Mass,
whose wife's super ran out of gas,
she was gone for a spell, 
and when she came back, the super looked like hell

Next!
