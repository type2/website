Subject: For Sale 95 EV Camper


There is also a 95 Eurovan camper at McNevin's Cadillac and Volkswagen
in Berkeley, California. I do not know anything about it except that it
is a 95, has an ultra thin pop top (so I assume it is a Westy?) and is
sitting in their showroom (went in to see if I could get more info on
either a golf or jetta TDI, those passat's cost a bit!)...

Anyway, if anyone is interested the number is: (510) 528-5900
