Subject: NO-start, after my tweaking ('85)

Hi all,

ANY HELP APPRECIATED!!!

A little history first:

Did a top-end overhaul (head gasket, valve job, rings, rod bearings, 
etc.) about 4,000 miles ago.  A couple of weeks ago, noticed loss of 
power; also had heard a dull knocking noise (just a few knocks) when 
starting.  So......this weekend I:

	changed the fuel filter
	removed the catalytic converter
	retorqued the heads
	readjusted the valves

Now, it won't start!  Tries to turn over, but just sounds like somebody 
wheezing!

I've checked all the obvious things I could think of (plugs, rotor, what 
else?).

I BEG FOR HELP!!!!!!!  I REALLY wanted to get more than 4K out of this 
last repair!

Becoming desperate,

David Bradshaw
Asheville, NC
