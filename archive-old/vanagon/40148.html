Subject: Re: '81 Vanagon, stumbles after warmed up

Thanks for the advice.  Based on what you and others have said, I plan to:

1.  check the air flow sensor flap for sticking
2.  replace fuel filter (replaced 3 years, 15K miles ago, along with fuel pump)
3.  add fuel injector cleaner to the gas tank
4.  replace the plugs (Bosch Super (non-resistor) W8CC installed 8K
miles,1.5 years ago)
      anyone know the exact name and # of the best plugs to put in?
5.  buy a timing light (finally) and set the timing (4-6 degrees ATDC)
6.  check O2 sensor, cylinder head temp sender + connections
7.  clean all electical connections
8.  clean fuel injector power relay

I hope it does some good.

Also, to answer the question about when it happens ...
It has happened as early as within about 10 minutes of driving around, but
is very intermittent then - every 10 minutes or so, it might stumble for an
instant.
A few times after driving for an hour or so, it will stumble more violently
(again for a fraction of a second) and will occur up to about once a minute
while cruising on the freeway at a steady 60-65 mph.
Hills do not seem to matter either way.
It happens when the oil temp is anywhere from 200 to 250.
It seems to occur most often after the bus has been stopped temporarily
(like to get gas)
It happens in city traffic as well as on the freeway.

Any more ideas?


&gt;&gt;Second, my '81 Vanagon has been having problems for almost a year now:
&gt;&gt;After it has been running for 1/2 hour or more (and especially after it has
&gt;&gt;been running, then stopped for gas or something, then started), it will
&gt;&gt;&quot;stumble&quot; while cruising along.  &quot;stumble&quot; means that the engine will lose
&gt;&gt;power for an instant (fraction of a second), which can be felt throughout
&gt;&gt;the bus.
&gt;&gt;Any clues as to what to look for?  Is this something I need to take to the
&gt;&gt;dealer (for their diagnostic equipment)?
&gt;&gt;I rebuilt the engine about 2 years ago, so hopefully there's no problem there!
&gt;
&gt;hmmmm. how often does it do this? like only once per trip? every few minutes?
&gt;it could be a failing or corroded fuel injector relay. or a failing fuel
&gt;pump. but they should do it fairly often.
&gt;
&gt;it could be some water in the gas tank that gets trapped in the fuel filter.
&gt;
&gt;cheap diagnosis:
&gt;- replace the fuel filter. it probably needs it anyway. :)
&gt;- clean ALL electrical connections you can find around the engine.
&gt;- locate and clean the contacts of the fuel injector power relay (i think it
&gt;  is in a black plastic box, back in the engine compartment, with a bunch of
&gt;  wires going into it). follow the injector wires and they should lead you
&gt;  to it.
&gt;
&gt;it sounds electrical, and them are the hardest intermittent glitches to track
&gt;down, cause you just have to do one wire/component at a time. :(
&gt;well ... ok. squeeks and rattles are harder to find.
&gt;
&gt;good luck.
