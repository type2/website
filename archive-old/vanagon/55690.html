Subject: Re: Is there a 5-speed out there?

&gt; Is there such a thing as a five speed that would fit in an 81 air-cooled
&gt;Vanagon?
&gt;
&gt;  How much are they? (new/used)

There were no 5-speed Vanagon trans sold by VW in the U.S. (except for 
Synchros with a low gear and, I think, some diesels, neither of which would 
easily fit an '81.)
However, there is another option. My friend Jon has just purchased a used 
Porsche 914 5-speed trans, which he plans to put in his '78 Bus (same 
engine as a Vanagon).  The guy he got it from (not sure if he's on the 
list, but I don't think so) has an 81 Vanagon that he put a 914 trans in.  
He had to reverse the ring gear in the trans, and weld in a bracket, but he 
said that the swap was relatively straightforward other than that.  (The 
914 uses the same basic motor as an air-cooled Vanagon, but it is 
mid-engined, so it sits in front of the trans, thus the need to reverse the 
gear.)
