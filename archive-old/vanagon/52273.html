Subject: VW Newbie...
From: fineguy_at_juno_dot_com (Richie B Urban)

	Hello...I'm a 15 year old who is interested in VWs.  What I am
planning on doing is buying a car in bad shape and then fix it up.  Of
course, I'd like to get it done before I turn 16 because that is when I
will recieve my full license (write now I have my Restricted License). 
I've been doing a LOT of research into VW busses and bugs, but I prefer
the bus.  I do have one problem....I am assuming from what I have read
that there are different kinds of VW busses.  Which would you suggest to
be the best for me?  I heard that there was one (I believe it was called the camper) that came with a refrigerator, but I'm not sure.  So, if
anyone could fill me in on the different kinds that I might be
interested in, PLEASE DO...8)

	One last question, how much money should I expect to plunk into
this car?

Thanks In Advance...

Richie
