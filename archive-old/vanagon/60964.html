&lt;&lt;      I disappeared for a bit, and never got an answer to the last
 question I had posted. So...here it  goes again: My analog clock died a
 couple weeks ago, and Im wondering if I can replace the clock with another
 gauge. Are there any gauges that will fit in exactly where the clock was, or
 do I have to mount them elsewhere?
         And....my Tach is currently placed directly to the right of the
 gauge console, held in place by velcro tabs. Its getting pretty warm here
 finally, so the sticky goo on the tabs is softening, and tipping the Tach
 over. How else can I adhere the Tach to the console without doing to much
 damage??
  &gt;&gt;

why don't you just get a speedo cluster out of a '85 up Van?  It will solve
both your tach, and clock problems.
