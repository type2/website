Subject: Extra(?) holes in rear engine tin

	I belive one of those extra holes is for the little extra
warm-air-pipe that blows warm air on the carb and intake. My '70
needed one, and ECI didn't ship it so equipped, so we scavanged
from the junkyard. I'll bet the SECOND extra hole is for EGR
feed for later model busses, but probably I'm wrong about this.b
