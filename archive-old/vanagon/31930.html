Subject: 81 troubles...air box?

The 81 Vanagon ushered in the new year with misbehavior and attitude. After
presenting it with a new muffler and four (count 'em) CV joints and boots
for Christmas I thought it would be thrilled. Instead it decided to sputter
and jerk about ten minutes into any trip, highway or city. Slight dripping
of gas near the right rear (heat exchanger?) was the only clue for me, a
expert at oil changes and tire inflation but not much else. Trusted
professional mechanic (TPM) suggests replacement of the fuel filter which
seems to stop the gas drip but is not effective for behavior modification.
If the Vanagon sits with motor off for 5-10 minutes it will usually go for
another few minutes before it flat out will not go. It idles, but won't
move, unless to lurch somewhat violently. TPM suggests replacing double
relay and fuel pump. What is $ but to spend, right? OK, sounds good,
yesterday Vanagon takes me home from the TPM with new pump and relay, a 10
minute trip, without incident. On the way to work this morning, same
symptoms. What's left to pursue? Is it possible to test the airbox with a
volt meter? TPM says &quot;it's old, things wear out, replace it&quot; (the part, not
the Vanagon). His assistant seems genuinely puzzled. Thanks for any ideas,
or input on other TPMs in San Diego.
