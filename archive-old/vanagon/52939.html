Subject: Re: vibrations

&gt; Hi,
&gt; my 85 Westy has a nasty habit of creating a very loud vibration right 
&gt; above my head when I take her up over seventy. I thought it might be 
&gt; the bungy cords I have up there but when I took them off it was much 
&gt; worse...sometimes it creates just a slight vibrational noise, other 
&gt; times like a jackhammer...what's going on? Thanks for any advice,
&gt; Rick

Check the four mounting screws on the luggage rack over the cab - 
they come loose quite often. I've seen Westy's driving down the hwy 
with it flapping up &amp; down...
