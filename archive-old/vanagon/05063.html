I'm glad this tire was finally mentioned.  The local tire shop that I
patronize (Ingold Tire) looked up the Vanagon in their tire book and this
was the only tire (that they sell I assume) that is recommended.  I was 
quoted a price of $76 per tire and can't wait until I can afford to get
them.  My '84 has some shit Patriot Ultra Supremes that are the worst
handling tires I've ever had the displeasure of rolling down the road.
