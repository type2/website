Ditto!

For several reasons, including but not limited to:

1) Spamming. We've lived a very sheltered life with regard to spamming on
our &quot;private&quot; VANAGON list. Want SPAM!, convert to newsgroup!

2) Jerks and Querks. Accessing our &quot;private&quot; VANAGON list is an ACTIVE
process. Accessing any newgroup is a passive process ... anyone browsing
the newsgroup list can and will send practically anything they want to any
group. I will not elaborate on the &quot;what&quot;, suffice it to say some of it
could give you real nightmares.

3) Control. With a listserv group, we (the list administrators) can
control who and who doesn't get access. Perhaps some may not like this
feature, but it gives us (the whole group) the OPTION to exclude or
restrict access to those whose words and demeanor on the group become a
problem.


etc., etc. ...
