.&gt;&gt;In a message dated 96-05-18 17:41:59 EDT, you write:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt;     Does anyone have a syncro driveline they would like to sell. It dosn't
&gt;&gt;&gt;have to have good joints,or any joints for that matter, Heck, it dosn't even
&gt;&gt;&gt;have to be streight! If you do please let me know.
&gt;&gt;&gt;                                                                            
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Drivel ine or drive shaft?  I have a few driveshafts.  Good joints but
&gt;&gt;probabaly need balance.
&gt;&gt;

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Thanks for the response. I need the shaft between the transaxle and the
front diff.  All I really need is the front 10&quot; of the shaft. My driveline
has been freshly rebuilt (the bronze bushings inside) but in the process the
front yokes got crushed eggshape (I got stupid for a second). I would like
to find a front yoke and weld it on to my shaft then have it balanced. You
can't buy that size yoke from a driveline shop. I would like to use my shaft
because I am trying a experiment with the material I replaced the bronze
bushings with. I used molly filled nylon for the bushings. I think this
stuff will last far longer than the bronze that VW installed and it won't
cause wear on the stub that sticks into the bushing. If I can't Locate a
used up shaft that would be suitable to be cut then I will need to get a
good one. I'm getting ready for Inuvik so time is flying by. Please let me
know.

Thanks again Todd Francis
