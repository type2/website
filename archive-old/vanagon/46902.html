Subject: 2.1 vs. 1.9 Crankcases?

Hi,

What are the differences between the 2.1 and the 1.9 liter Wasserboxer
crankcases?  I know the there is not much difference in the heads.

Why am I asking?  I am working on a deal for an 86 2.1 wasser that has
some heat damage to the flywheel side of the case and I have several 1.9
core motors.  The motor was not run since the fire which didn't get 
to the engine.  Thanks! 8-)
