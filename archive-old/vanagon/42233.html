Subject: '87 syncro: what are those donut-like rubber bushings?
Date: Thu, 16 May 1996 07:55:37 -0700

I was checking out the underside of my '87 syncro yesterday and noticed two 
large rubber bushings located either side of the driveshaft by the front 
drive unit. They appear to be a part of the suspension. The rubber has 
shrunk to where there is an 1/8&quot; gap around the rubber. Bentley doesn't 
have much to say about these, the only place I see them mentioned is on 
page 40.27 where they appear in a drawing. Anyone know the function of 
these bushings? Any experience with replacing them?
