Subject: Can't adjust lifters, help.


Well, here is a engine rebuild update, and a question.  The engine in
question is a 2 liter air cooled Vanagon engine.  I have just started
putting things back together again.  All the parts are scrubbed and 
cleaned.  The sheet metal is getting a new coat of paint (red, to make
it go faster!).  I just finished installing new pistons and cyliders, and
a pair of rebuilt heads.  The hydraulic tappets have been bled successfully.
Now for the problem:  when I tighten down the rocker arms at TDC in 
compression, the valves start to open even with the adjusters all the
way out.  In other words, I will not be able to follow the reccomended
initial adjustment procedures for the valve settings because I will not
be able to set the screws so they are &quot;just touching&quot;.  Any ideas?  Do
I need to put shims under the rocker arm supports?  Also, what keeps my
tappets form getting air in them again as I am doing all of this?

Hope somebody can help here.

P.S.  I thing these engines are of the devil.  Seems like most every nut
      is a 13 mm.   Maybe I shouldn't try working on the engine on Fridays.
