Subject: Re: Oregon Bashing

...i can't believe you folks are really serious about this. i came to oregon
5 years ago from germany and i found the people here to be some of the
friendlyest people i've ever met. of course you find morons in any state.
and if you floor it on I-5 and only stop to get gas i guess you meet the
people you deserve. not that i like the stupid gas-pumping-law here. they
filled up my diesel rabbit with gasoline twice last year... but i like to
leave the doors unlocked when i go shopping, and i like to hitchhike and pick
up hitchhikers and i can do these things in oregon without worrying about
it. try that in southern cal...
   sorry, had to get that off my chest...feeling better now. no offense to
anyone !

&gt; &gt;&gt; Most of my prior visits to Oregon were in the more arid two-thirds of the
&gt; &gt;&gt;state east of the Cascades.  If given a choice, I'll avoid your state in
&gt; the
&gt; &gt;&gt;future.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Oregon is also the state that gave us the Oregon Citizen's Alliance, that
&gt; &gt;neo-nazi group that is (like a virus) attempting to infect neighboring
&gt; &gt;states.  But at least it gives Lon Mabon's family a job and keeps the whole
&gt; &gt;gang off welfare.
