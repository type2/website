Subject: Re: wiring harness, stalling

&gt;Well, yesterday my 84 died while going down the road around 40 mph.  It
&gt;just cut out and died just as if I had turned off the ignition.  I turned
&gt;the key a couple times before I came to a stop and it wouldn't start.  I
&gt;pulled over and waited one or two minutes and it started right up.  There
&gt;were no problems after this.
&gt;
&gt;What I am wondering is, does this sound like the wiring harness fix that
&gt;i've read about in the archives?  Is it worth spending the $100 for the
&gt;harness if that is the problem?
&gt;
&gt;thanks in advance for any help
&gt;

Blake,
It could be...I had the same problem on my '84 and bought the harness while
on a trip. My mechanic later fixed the problem with the turn of an idle
adjustment screw. My understanding is that the harness works with  digifant
fuel injection systems but not necessary with digijet systems.  As a result
I have a new wiring harness  that I don't need.  If anyone wants it, I'd
sell it for 60$.  A 40$ mistake is easier to swallow than a 100$ one.
