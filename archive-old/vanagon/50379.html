Subject: Temp Indicator On Dash rises to max: 84 Vanagon 

Re: 84 Vanagon (gas engine)

I just changed the coolant to a Prestone non-phosphate &quot;looks like
orange syrup&quot; coolant.  It looked pretty appetizing ;-)

Anyway, I think I broke something because when I started the engine, the
temperature indicator rose very quickly while the LED sensor blinked
rapidly.  The temperature LED sensor has not yet stopped blinking, and
the indicator is all the way to the right (MAX temp) even though the
engine was cold.  

What part do I need to replace?  There's a two female prong wire covered
with insulation that attaches to the coolant reservoir.  Is this what I
have to replace?  OR there is also an attachment onto the coolant water
reservoir itself.  Is this instead what I have to replace?  I think I
made a booboo because I did not disconnect the battery prior to changing
the coolant.  I wonder if not-disconnecting-the-battery was the cause of
the temperature indicator going up rapidly?

TIA!

John
