Subject: Advice on VW power/RPM range 2.1 l

I'd like to research the various hp and torque available for the RPM range
on my 2.1. Futher I plan to research the manifold vaccum I'm pulling at
various road conditions.

I'd like to post the results as a guide to amount of engine strain. Ie if
your rig's motor is good and you pull more or less than average vacuum,
then your improvements or --err-- problems would be worth considering by us
all.

Additionally, I believe we could set a kind of guidline for how hard,
manifold pressure wise to run the engine. A typical example would be
running in a headwind or on long grades.

Anyone with piston engine aircraft experience could shed some light.  Since
they guage the power setting by the vacuum guage.  I have turbine engine
experience, but its not of value here. Help.

Sincerely
