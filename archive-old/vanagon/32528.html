I believe that Melita also makes a filter which fits on top of a coffee 
cup for making single cups.  One of the nice things about Melita is that 
you can also purchase a wire filter to replace the paper ones.  Just 
rinse and reuse for an environmentally friendly cup o' joe.  The only 
drawback with ours is that it lets some grounds past through  
dave.
