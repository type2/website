Subject: vw dealers refuse (conspiracy)
Date: Mon, 16 Jan 1995 20:00:29 -0800 (PST)

So Joel Walker says:
&gt; i get the feeling that the vw dealers are involved in a conspiracy with GM
&gt; .. those Chevrolet people in the VWOA started it! ... to just be so mean
&gt; and rotten, that they run everybody away from VW.
&gt; 
As usual the cause is greed and money.  They want you to get rid of your
older cars (any brand) so that your forced to buy the new more expensive
and almost impossible to work on new cars.  Even the Japanese companies
are wise to this.  Remember those great high mileage cars of the 70's 
and early 80's?  They're all gone.  I remember when the CRX first came
out it got 65 mpg!  Now the highest mileage Honda gets roughly 40 mpg.
Now why would Honda do this?  Well, IMO they got the US buyers to buy
into there quality, reliability and great gas economy.  Since the US
cars have come a long way in quality/reliability, the Japanese have
kept up their relentless manufacturing of Q &amp; R cars, but since the
US has not improved the fuel mileage in their cars, they Japanese have
backed off the high mileage cars part of their onslaught.  But they
still have a large part of the US market.    

But fear not!  We with this list and other mediums are just as relentless
and will outsmart these fiends by sharing information about the newer
cars so that we will know how to work on them and how to handle most
problems.  Well, at least until we get too lazy to do so.  ;)

Unfortunately, the aircooleds air slowly dying off.  What a lost.
A whole generation of history slowly rusting into the past. :(
