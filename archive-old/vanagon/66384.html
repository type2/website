Subject:      96 Eurovan

I recently purchased a 97 Eurovan.
It leans to the left due to all of the camper gear, propane tank, water
tanks! etc. placed on the left side. The gas tank SPOUT is on the left
side also, however I have not looked to see if the tank is mounted in
the middle.
          The Van does not drive symetrically.
I had a 1980 Camper with the propane and the gas tank spout on the
right; stove, water, sink, and fridge; and cupboards on the Left. The
1980 set flat on the ground and drove like it.

Has anyone with the new van resolved this???

I have talked to Winnebago and www.winnebagoind_dot_com

&quot;talk to VW&quot;

VW says the problem is &quot;all of the camper gear is on the left, that's
why it leans to the left&quot;

Thqank you

EEro Volkswagon is looking in to it...


        Winter driving ahead, have a gas!

Kris
