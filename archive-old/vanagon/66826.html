Subject:      Speedo cable noise

I had to remove the instrument panel to fix a problem with a windshield
wiper.  (This included diconnecting the speedometer cable) After
reassembling, I noticed a grinding / rattling coming from the instrument
panel, disconnected the speedometer cable and that's the culprit.
Problem is, I can't figure out how to fix it, and it's very annoying.

It appears that something in the connection is grinding, but I can't
figure out if that connection comes apart w/out breaking.  I tried
blowing it out w/ high pressure air.  I tried a squirt of WD-40.

Has anyone experienced this?

Can I remove the plastic 'spinny part' (Technical Term) in the connector
without breaking it to see what could be making the noise?

Any suggestions?

Thanks,
