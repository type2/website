Subject: Re: Leaky Filler Tube 75 Campmobile

 Patrick Flynn inquired about repairing a leaky filler tube to gas tank.
The tube actually consists of 3 parts- a plastic flange with screws around
it, what you see when you take cap off, which is clamped to a metal tube
about 1.5 ft., and a rubber connector about 4 or 5&quot; long which is
hoseclamped to the tank.  The latter can crack and eventually leak- I too
had gas &quot;smells&quot; when tank was filled too high or when making left turns,
and took the opportunity to check it out when I pulled engine to replace
clutch disk- The cover to tank compartment had screws that were impossible
to reach when engine was in car, and I left them out when cover was
replaced.  Before trying to remove the rubber connector I checked dealer-
$90 for a stupid piece of fat hose, and had no time to wait, so I took a
piece of tin can cut to allow an overlap on itself; glopped it up with
silicone, and clamped it over the rubber connector with plenty more
silicone.  Works pretty well with filling tank; still some smell with hard
lefts, so I don't totally fill the tank, especially after first &quot;click&quot; of
pump. To replace the hose, you probably have to dissconect the flan ge at
the top, allowing tube to be &quot;lifted&quot; so lower rubber hose can be slipped
over tank and end of filler pipe.  MB in NJ
