Subject: FS '93 VW EV MV

You can say a lot with just 2 numbers and 8 letters, can't you?

As seen today in the Saint Paul Pioneer Press:

'93 VW Eurovan MV.  Hard to find w/rear facing seats, table, bed, curtains,
dual air &amp; heat, cass, tinted glass, 5 spd, only 29K mi! (Exclamation point
is theirs)  Sale $17,898.  Countryside VW  484-8441.

At least this one didn't have anything about a tilt wheel! :-)

Usual disclaimers apply.

1972 (SLOWLY getting together) Westfalia
1987 (drip...drip...drip) Syncro GL
