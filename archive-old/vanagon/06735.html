&gt;ANYWAY, I thought I'd mention that there's an event in the St.
&gt;Louis area on Memorial Day weekend called Buses By The Arch.  They do it
&gt;twice a year--Memorial and Labor Days--and I stopped by for a couple of
&gt;hours this Labor Day and it looks like a pretty fun thing.
&gt;SO this might be something to consider in planning the BIG TOUR or the
&gt;SMALLER midwest thing.

Memorial Day weekend is at the end of May, so this wouldn't really make a
good substitute for a Midwestern Winter excursion. But I would like to go
to the BBTA thing anyway. (Was about to go on Labor Day, but my bus
refused :-( 

Now what about doing something during Spring break? Ours is from March 5
through March 13, 1995.
