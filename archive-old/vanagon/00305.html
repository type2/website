Subject: More list problems.

Brick Owners:
At 9:55 this morning, our system administrator, in an attempt to automate 
the restart of the list after power down, restarted the list manually as 
root.  This caused several of the files to become owned by root, so when 
I restarted the server in the correct way, the server was not able to 
write to those files and so it died.  That's why you got the weird 
messages like

554 &quot;|/home/halfdan/server/listserv/catmail -L VANAGON -f&quot;... unknown 
mailer error 1

The problem should have been resolved.  Please attempt to resend those 
messages to the list.

Sorry, and thanks for your patience.
