Subject: Re: Any VW Halloween Ideas?


Back in 1970 I had just been given my first VW - a 1957 Oval Window Beetle. 
It owner was a friend of my father's and had just bought a new 1970 beetle 
so he gave the '57 to me. The '57 was originally painted Polar Silver 
(probably the BEST color ever to be seen on an oval), but in 1960 or so he 
decided to paint it that HIDDEOUS Coral color that VW used from 58 thru 60 
to match his wife's 59 beetle.

By 1970, the Coral had faded to a pinkish-orange hue. For halloween, I 
bought a large jar of water-soluable black poster paint and painted the '57 
to look like a  jack o'lantern. The hood had the facke of the jack 
o'lantern. Two days later, I washed the paint off....however some of hte 
pigment had been absorbed by the coral paint, so there was a faint outline 
of the pumpkin remaining. It remained there for about a month, when I 
convinced my father that it would be a nice birthday/christmas present to 
paint the beetle...BRIGHT YELLOW!!
