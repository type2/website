&gt;money and time.  My advice is to simply buy a known-good unit and swap it
&gt;yourself.  Just make sure that your differential hasn't crapped out on you
&gt;first.  You'll be reusing it if you cross-breed.

I rebiuld these automatics all the time.  Only part questionable is the
valave body as I cannot fully test it until installed. hardly ever a problem
in the VW though. Normal repair of all soft parts, (clutches, bands, steels
pistons, bushings, seals, gaskets and rebuilt torque converter should be
under $400.00 patrst, 3 to 4 hours labor including seals on th final drive.
If you want you can send it to me and I'll repair it for you.

Dennis.
