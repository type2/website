&gt;Here's a question- A friend of mine has, among his collection, a 57
&gt;Westphalia, with what I would swear to be a factory installed removable
&gt;roof section. It is basically the same size as the roof of a single cab.

but is it in the middle of the full roof? or do you mean that the roof over
the front seats is removable?
