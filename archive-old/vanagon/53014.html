Subject: Re: French Syncro Club-Oettinger TD engine 

  Philippe,
      I am interested in info on the Oettinger TD engine with intercooler.

      The standard 1.6 TD motor has 70 ps?  What is the rating of the
Oettinger TD?

      Where is the intercooler mounted? 

      Is max boost greater than .7 bar?

      Are there internal changes such as head gasket or pistons?

      What is the cost for this conversion kit? 

       Thanks for the info
