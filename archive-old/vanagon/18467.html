&gt; Please be more specific regarding your 23 window request. Do you need the

&gt; there a size difference with the deluxe hatches compared to the Kombi
&gt; hatches of similar year during this vintage ('59-'63)? I admit that I'm
&gt; unclear about this point.

Yes, the rear decklid window is what we're looking for--and they are 
quite a bit different from the glass on kombis and micros. The deluxe
glass is taller (and I think wider). I don't know if the glass off the
rear decklid of a 15-window will fit. Anyone?
