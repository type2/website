Subject: Help!

I just bought a 1981 Vanagon Camper.  I made the mistake of not geting it 
checked out before the purchase... Anyways, not being too familiar with 
the vw air cooled van engines, this is what happened.  On the way home, I 
noticed big (and I mean big) clouds of smoke coming out of the pipe.  It 
only did it about four, five times, nevertheless a disturbing sight 
considering I just bought it.  Upon arrival at home, I opened the engine 
compartment and noticed a puddle of oil collected on the right, end 
side.  Under greater rpm's it seemed to be geting pushed out from a black 
what looks like a valve cover (the #2 spark plug is on this black 
covering, about 5 inches back.  That too seemed to have oil.  The left 
side was ok.  The van did currently does not run and there sems to be a 
puudle of oil under it.  What the hell happened? Any advice would be 
appreciated.
