&gt;      My '84 Vanagon camper has this problem where every 30,000

&gt; the water  cooling system.  This first appears as a rising coolant
&gt; level in the overflow tank next to the oil dipstick. Next the
&gt; dashboard heater quits because it fills with gas.  Finally (about
&gt; 2K miles later) the leaking gas literally blows coolant out of most
&gt; of the cooling system and the temperature sensor begins to signal
&gt; imminent meltdown!

It sounds to me an awful lot like your head bolts/studs are 
stretching.  This used to be a big problem on the rabbit diesels.  I 
would ask your dealer to look for a service bulletin on it.  Also call 
VWoA, they may have one of those (unpublicized) recalls going, even ten 
years later, or you may want to discuss &quot;lifetime warantee&quot; with the 
dealer, if it is indeed the head bolts.
