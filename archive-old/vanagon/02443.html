Subject: Re: A strange devoted group

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 	What a devoted group of afficianados (sp) and 
&gt; 	enthusiasts this is. Hard to imagine a bunch
&gt; 	of people getting excited over Caravans or
&gt; 	Aerostars.
&gt; 

	Naaah...you ought to hear my excitement over my Villager.

	Or better yet, JUMBO the ~25ft ClassC minimotorhome that sleeps 
	six, has a built-in shower AND toilet AND hot-water heat, along 
	with a 15cuft LP/12v/115v refrigerator/freezer, 4 burner stove 
	and oven, dual A/C, forced air heat, 40 gallon fresh water tank, 
	separate black and gray water holding tanks, and 4KW generator... 
	Plenty of storage space for a family of 6 and it's paraphernalia
	for extended road adventures.

	460cu.inch V8 with appetite to match (~7mpg) :-(

&gt; 	Still babbling... 
&gt;
