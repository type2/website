&gt; clue for a 1700 please let me know.

  The rev. limiter on a type IV is set at 5400 rpm. Your 1700 may or may not
  have the rev limiter installed &lt;it's a $30.00 distributor rotor&gt;. But
  5400 may be a good place to set the redline. Peak horsepower on a
  1700cc type IV is developed at 4800 rpm. The shift points that VW 
  publishes in the owners manual generally correspond to the peak horsepower
  rpm in a given gear.
