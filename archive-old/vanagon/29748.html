Subject: RE: '71 BUS REAR BRAKE DRUMS

&gt;&gt; slacken the e-brake cables.  I was under the impression that I could 
&gt;&gt; remove the drums without removing the 46mm nut.  Is this true?  
&gt;
&gt;NO! You have to remove the nut. Get the right tool and use a hammer
&gt;on the tool as well as a long breaker bar. I usually put one foot on
&gt;the breaker bar while banging with the hammer. Even with a 5 foot
&gt;breaker bar, you still need to use a hammer. The 46 mm nuts on both
&gt;sides of the car remove counter clockwise. Don't forget to remove the
&gt;cotter pin first.

71 and later buses have two piece drums which can be removed without
removing the mother of all axle nuts.  Only the 1970 and earlier buses have
the one piece drums necessitating the axle nut removal (a task that often
requires the team of oxen and a breakfast of Wheaties).
