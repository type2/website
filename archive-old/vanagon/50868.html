&lt;&lt; Sat, Oct 19: Assemble foldable engine hoist just purchased from Harbor
Freight Tools.  While not nesc for engine removal from van, will definitely
come in handy when removing  the 1.8l gas engine from the donor 1986 Golf. &gt;&gt;

The Bentley manual shows engine removal by supporting from underneath with a
device like a transmission jack.  I removed my wasserboxer this way and it
was a bit of a pain!  When I installed the engine, I used a hoist and it
worked much better.

Good luck,
