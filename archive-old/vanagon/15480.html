&gt; Uh, well I can't help you there, BUT since you addressed the Jack issue, 
&gt; I'd like to find a replacement Jack for my '70.  I would suppose that a 
&gt; Jack that raises a Vanagon could also raise a bus, so for those about to 
&gt; Jack, please offer advice!!
&gt; 
&gt; BTW the stock one is frozen solid with caked grease and crud.

Jacks are different, square post on a bus, round on a Vanagon, I'd like
to note the OEM Bilstein jacks used to 7?' with the nut you turned by
your lug wrench were much much stronger than the one that came stock in
our '76 with the built in crank handle, I've never seen an earlier one
broken, so if the one from that '70 is just frozen up, soak the head in
Varsol, clean the threads with a paint brush and varsol then dry and
regrease, it should last forever.
