Subject: RE: '64 Weekend Addendum!


&gt;I probably wasn't clear in my message.  What I meant to say was that
&gt;the engine was over 3/4 full (dip-stick read over 1/2) of oil when
&gt;Rich took the bus in to get the tune up.
&gt;
&gt;On top of that the mechanic ADDED 2 quarts!  I guess the dip-stick
&gt;mechanic couldn't figure out how the dip-stick worked! (Pun intended!)


I was pretty sure you COULDN'T have meant that-- a &quot;mechanic&quot; who can't
read a dipstick, is like a secretary who can't read single-spaced typing,
or an electrical engineer who can't read a schematic!
Sometimes you gotta wonder...
