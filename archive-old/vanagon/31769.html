Subject: Odd syncro
Date: Tue, 2 Jan 96 12:55:02 PST

So there wuz I.  Motoring gently into the crowded sunset over the now nicely
restored bridge on SR40CA past the Donnerspitz hutte and towards the venerable
WPA era Rainbow lodge when what to my wandering eyes did appear but a tiny
syncro.  

Now my syncro sleeps four + cats and dogs and goes anywhere slowly but this 
syncro...GTI motor, quite small, nicely colored with two doors and a snowbored
rack on top...said syncro on the back.  So ye of great knowledge and broad 
travels here's the question.  What was it?  I know, do you?
