Subject:      WTB: headlight and mirror

In an attempt to help the US balance of trade, I'd like to find a right
low-beam lens assembly and a right power mirror housing for an '89.  That's
$420US at the dealer.

Any out there for substantially less than that?

The headlight had a rock hole in it and water got in.
I removed it and crazy-glued a small piece of mica over the hole.
Then I put a 20W halogen lamp next to the lens to dry it out, with the 9006
bulb removed so it could vent.  I had it glass-down with the light about
one ince away.
After about 15 minutes I heard a noise from the headlight assembly.
Headlight assemblies are not ordinarily noise-producing items.
The glass of the lens had cracked, diagonally from corner to corner.
So I dropped crazy-glue on the new crack...
Gonna need a new one now *sigh* and I'd like to avoid giving the dealer
$160US...

I'm going to drill a longitudinal hole through the broken mirror housing to
hold it on, sans wires. I paid less for The Bozobus itself than that mirror
assembly costs...
