Subject: 81 Westy poptop fs in PA

Our local paper had the following ad [I'm not selling it,nor
have I seen it]

  &quot;VW 81 westy popup camper, slps 4 stove refrig sink $5500/BO
     (412)530-2266&quot;

seems a bit steep to me for a van from salty PA [haven;t seen it though-
it might be perfect!?]
  There's also a 
 '77 vw bus-runs well,needs work $800,Steve 367-0519


Hope some of you find these of interest,
Bill Layton
