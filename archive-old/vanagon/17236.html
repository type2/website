Subject: Fwd: Syncro Ball Joint


&gt;        I think the passengers side joint is going. If anyone has
&gt;replaced 
&gt;one of these, how much did the part(s) cost, and what did it
&gt;sound/feel like 
&gt;when worn out? I

I had an upper ball joint start making noise on my synchro. First noticed a
slight clunk on the right front when going around a left curve and hitting a
bump that bounced the van up. (You had to be there  :)) There was a
particular downhill curve that it happened on regularly.
Anyway, I was able to feel a little slop by raising the wheel off the ground
and wiggling it in and out.

I don't know if the lower would do the same thing, but suspect it would if
it's bad enough. The joint was $45 back in 10/93--looks like an aftermarket
because its appearance is different from the other one. Not hard to replace
is things aren't rusted too badly.

Can't help on the wheel bearings on the rear. Vibration could be coming from
various areas--bearings, ujoints on driveshaft, etc.

Good luck!     Dan
