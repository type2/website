Subject: Tools, Stripped CV bolts, etc.


Talkin' tools...

	With regard to tools, I have to say that life is too short to 
use *cheap* tools. When cheap tools bend and break they often damage 
parts and the user as well as themselves. 

	Maybe it's not cool to say it, but I really *like* my 
Craftsman tools. I've got Craftsman tools that vary in age from about 
1982 to about last month, and they all work well and feel good. 
They've been with me through everything from engine rebuilds to clutch 
jobs to suspension work to LOTS of maintenance. The *only* time I've 
broken a Craftsman tool is while *grossly* abusing it- but of course I 
failed to mention my four-foot cheater pipe when I returned those 
breaker bars, heh heh!

	We go through a lot of hand tools in the processing areas here 
at work, lots of both Snap-On and Craftsman. I've got to admit 
that the Snap-On tools are polished nicer than the Craftsman tools, 
but in heavy use 'n abuse I don't see a noticeable difference in 
durability, precision, etc.

Talkin' Stripped CV Screws...

	Most of you read my brother Bill's anguished post about the 
stripped CV screws on his '70 single-cab. Bill's got a bad cold, so in 
the interest of getting him up 'n running ASAP I went over and 
wrenched on his truck for a while myself. 

(See? Kid brothers CAN be useful...)

	I got all six of the stripped CV bolts out successfully, 
without resorting to excessive violence. Four of them succumbed to 
finesse- I rotated them to where I could clean them carefully and then 
tap the 12-point socket in DEEP with the hammer before turning gently. 
LOTS of WD-40 was used as penetrant, which didn't hurt- not quite 
liquid wrench, but WD-40 is pretty good stuff. Two of the bolts were 
really stripped, but I got both of them with Vice-Grips applied to the 
outside, without any need to file flats on the bolt heads or anything.
I love happy endings!

	So now the axles are out and ready for re-booting and 
re-packing. I also pulled the transmission out, as we are going to 
mate it with the engine to simplify re-installation.

	Further bulletins as events warrant...

	Happy Motoring!
