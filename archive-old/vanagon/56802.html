&gt; Suggestions needed!  My oil light is flashing on idle after engine is
&gt; warmed up.  Oil level is OK.  Has not done this in the past.  Using
&gt; Castrol Syntec for last 60K miles (changed about every 5-6K).  Runs
&gt; fine.  Heads done at 55K.  107K on it now.  Should I be concerned?
&gt; RPM's at idle have not changed. It flickers a little, and as soon as the
&gt; engine comes off idle, it goes out.  Thanks in advance,
&gt;
