Subject:      Trip Rpt, stat change, &amp; Syncro towing Warning!

Hi All,

Just finished my whirlwind vehicular transfer trip from KC to Stillwater,
OK to Tulsa, OK and back without major incident other than a few delays.
Bill Keating has a real nice place and my 4.5 yr old and I saw a Bobcat
mama with two kittens crossing the road not far from their house.  Bill
had really worked hard getting his garage cleaned out for the 64 Single
Cab.

My 82 Diesel is now at my storage yard outside of KC.  I hope to get it
going and possibly driving in Sept.  On the way back from the storage yard
40 miles from home, I decided to pull the U-haul car transport trailer
with my Bug hauling single axle trailer with my 86 Syncro.  Since the
trailer was back-heavy and I had a heck of time keeping the Syncro from
getting wishy-washy on the interstate--a real nightmare in busy
traffic.  Made it back okay though. 748 miles, mostly in a gas guzzling
Ford F-250.  I'm ready for a Vanagon diesel sipping trip soon!
Hope to see many of you at BBTA!  I'll be in my blue 86 Syncro GL with my
4.5 yr old boy in tow.   8-)

Current stable:
86 Syncro GL Silver (thrown rod)
86 Syncro GL Blue Driver (for sale, $5200 obo)
86 GTI Other driver (for sale, $1200 obo)
84 Vanagon Automatic, std. passenger (for sale, $1500)
82 Diesel Vanagon
66 Deluxe Non-snrf Bus (possibly sold for $75)
63 Camper (slowly returning to the earth in Iowa)
60, 61, &amp; 63 Bugs  (keeper projects)
61 Double Cab (ambitious project)
58 Panel (awaiting a buyer for Florida)
