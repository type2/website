Subject: Friday curtailing.

The friday lightness was never intended to forgo the obligatory VW
content.  Please don't just post humor on this list because you think it's
funny.  People who want to sign up to humor lists will. If you know a
funny thing that's VW related, or you like to write poetry or songs, OK,
but not just humor.  It's still the Vanagon list.

Thanks.
