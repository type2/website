How about worst shape but still legal daily driver?  Brings to mind 62 Ghia
I had back in mid-70's- total rotout of headlite area- I bought bucket
lights and bolted them Upside-down in what was left of fender wells. The fr
ont h-beam had no support left in the sides; I remember using sign-post mat
erial (the square tube with holes spaced all along it) bolted across the tu
bes to keep them together.   Tailites also rotted and I stuck on those
K-Mart running lights of different colors to = brake lites vs parking
lites.  The spare tire well was gone- used rope back and forth between
torsion tube and some other part to keep tire from falling out. The door
posts were history- you had to LIFT door as you opened it.  The giant holes
under your feet were bridged with nice solid steel BACKS of WASHING
MACHINES (my fav. source of free sheet steel).  It was nicely painted red
by Krylon spray cans.  This eyesore got me 40 mpg and unbelievably, passed
inspection in upstate NY!  (If it STOPPED and all lights worked, it
passed).  This was used in Ithaca to Syracuse trips constantly in the worst
of winters!- ah those push starts with the 6v ignition!)
