Subject: junkyard lady w/shotgun &amp; barndoor bus

an update to the Orcas Island trip. . . 

on the way to Anacortes, just north of Everett, I remember a friend saying he
had been to a junkyard about five years ago where there was a barndoor bus.
  I don't get in the neighborhood much, and last time I went to the place
there wasn't anyone there.  Actually it just looked like an old fashioned
farm, but i figured the buses were around the back of the barn or something.
 As he told me the man had died, and the old lady who ran the place greeted
him with a shotgun, i wasn't poking around.

this time i couldn't find it.  (no, really, it's just around the corner)
  there had been a lot of new houses built in the past year, too.  we stopped
at the local funky old antique shop.     There were two good old boys there,
spreading  out over their chairs.    I asked them about the junkyard with the
old buses, up the hill, and the old lady with the shotgun.   They chuckled
and said that did sound like Billy Bobs ma, but they had all the cars hauled
off three or four years ago, and there isn't anyone there now.   Jan looked
for a cheesy touristy ashtray, and the good old boys started talking about
the cars polluting the soil (I hadn't figured them for environmentalists)
 Decided not to go back up to the farm/junkyard.   

Anothere wild goose chase for barndoor parts.    it was pretty, though.  Saw
an old house with a great porch that wrapped around two sides.
