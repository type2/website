&gt;I think Joel's taxonomy is for the later years, or else I have the wrong badge
&gt;on the back.  My 1981 thinks it's a Vanagon L, but it has chrome bumpers,
&gt;cloth seats, carpeting, and originally a black pinstripe at the beltline
&gt;between elfenbein and orange.  Now it's elfenbein (or as close as Maaco could
&gt;get on a bad day) all over.
&gt;If I remember right, L was as good as it got in the first two years of Vanagon.
&gt;Anybody else's 80 or 81 L as &quot;loaded&quot; as mine?  L also means squeezable brown
&gt;shift knob, instead of black plastic, right

whoops! bill's right. for the 80-8?, the L was the top of the line, with cloth
and carpet and chrome. anybody know when the GL started showing up? 83 water-
cools?
