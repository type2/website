Subject:  oil filter wrench 

I use a mechanic to remove my oil filter. I believe that if I give him
a regular, small cash flow, he will: A: still be in business when I 
need a transmission rebuild, and B: give me a better break on the 
'big one'. I may be naive?

However, on a serious note, I believe you can buy the large plastic 'socket'
type oil filter wrench in various sizes. Just drop by your local
Canadian Tire. They are sure to have it. IF you don't know where it is, 
it is usually next to the beer store on the highway just outside of town;-)
They  have EVERYTHING!
I assume you DO know where the beer store is?

PS: To whoever runs the digest. Is it possible to cut them off at 30KBytes
    and issue more digests? My mailer only lets me see the first 30K of a
    message. Thanks for the info guys.BC.
