DyHow,

	Just a qwik update on da bus:

	I;ve done some more vinyl'ing on the upper parts, like around the rest of 
the windows and the back hatch.  I also did the hardboard pieces above the 
driver and passenger's skulls.

	I got a new mirror, NOS, from WW for the passenger side.
	
	Turn signals stopped working.  Looks like relay is finally kaput :(

	Right side taillight needs internal work.  Inside bulb spring/contacts
very week, won't wold bulb firm enuf.  Really need a new one :( :(
(bubble taillight)

	Installed wiper motor and wipers, and did related wiring.

	Did a test fit of new back bumper and brackets.  BTW - I think this
may be a pickup bumper, but I'm not sure how to tell the diff.  This bumper
needs a lot of straightening, tho!  

	Bought a set of 3 body hammers and 4 dollies for $10.  I'll prolly 
break the hammers (Chinese) but the dollies were a good deal.

	Acid dipped the new bumper brackets and splash guards and painted them.

	Painted the back and &quot;tire area&quot; of six wheels, of which the best
5 will go on the bus with new tires.

	Bought 4 14&quot; bus wheels, with good tires, only to realise that they
were 14&quot; and not 15&quot;  These are for sale now.  Don't know why I bought
them in the first place -)

	Maybe tomorrow I'll put the real paint on the wheels...

Thom
