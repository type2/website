Subject: Bus queries


Here are a few questions for the collective net wisdom--

1. Lots of talk lately about oil temperature measurement.  What about
   keeping the stuff cooler in the first place?
   On my last bus, the 1973 that made it to and from Yucatan faithfully
   and was mercilessly put on the auction block on its return (ARRGGGHHH!--
   a long story involving air conditioning, cruise control, three 
   children, a non-Spartan SO, and a *&amp;^%   T******  mini-van), I had
   installed one of RVEECO's oil coolers.  You know, the kind that mount
   outside the engine compartment and have the bypass valve at the filter.
   It seemed to work very well and got us home.  Alas, I didn't have the
   good sense to pull the thing before selling the bus, and now that I'm
   back in the bus business for the last four years (and the SO still has
   the nameless mini-van), I'm wondering what ever happened to RVEECO and
   those coolers.  Anybody using external mount auxiliary coolers with
   good success?  

   It seems to me that temperature measurement is sort of like autopsy?

   2. Anybody having good luck with piggyback solonoids to solve hot
   starting (ahem, non-starting) problems in the old buses?  My '79 does
   fine around town, but after a long (i.e., &gt;100 miles or so) trip I
   have to roll under there and do the screwdriver across the terminals
   routine before she'll start up.  What are folks doing, short (hmmm...)
   of starter rebuilds?

   3. A weird question.  I developed the habit of shifting occasionally
   without the clutch (dating to a period of a couple of days when I had
   to drive with a broken clutch cable--long story).  I still catch 
   myself doing this occasionally.  Does this damage stuff?  It seems to 
   me that if one possesses sufficient coordination not to grind too 
   much tranny metal, this is relatively benign.  Perspectives welcomed.


GREAT list.  De-lurk mode off for a while, I guess.
