Subject: Snap on Tools

Hi all. Does anyone have access to a Snap on Tool dealer? There are a few
items I would like to purchase and my local guy doesn't seem to want to
deal with me. I called him, my friend called him no -dice. I need some
inpact sockets and that nifty spifty &quot;S&quot; wrench. TIA
