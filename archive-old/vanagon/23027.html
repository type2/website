well, with the body work anyway.  i just had to tell someone that after 2
1/2 months of sanding, the body work on my 60' crew cab in done.
                                           ^^^^^^^^^^^^


A sixty-foot-long VW crew-cab???

Let me guess: 12 seats and a 30-foot bed, right?


I'd love to see the tires required for that one...
