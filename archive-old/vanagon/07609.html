Hi Alice,
We may just be able to trade info here, how nice.
Yes, I've dropped the tank in an 81 more times than I care to remember.  
If you want a write up, please write me at jreed_at_ag_dot_gov, rather than the
address attached to this message.  The editor over there is better for long
tracts.
Jack
