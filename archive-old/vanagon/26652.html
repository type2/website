So GOLDBERG_DAVID_at_mpd.tandem_dot_com says:
&gt; All,
&gt; 
&gt; Tonight while watching CNN, they did a story on the latest
&gt; Nobel Peace Prize winner Josef Rotblat.  At the ceremony he
&gt; arrives in none other than a brown Vanagon.
&gt; 
&gt; Thats got to count for something

Huh?  I always thought that the venerable VW bus was the vehicle
of choice for proponents of peace everywhere.  I thought this was
pretty evident with all the peace signs and the flashing of the
&quot;V&quot; peace sign from the drivers of all buses.  Kind of ironic
with the VW being the child of good ole Adolph.  :)

BTW,  I'd like to see Chystler make that kind of claim for it's
shit-box, er, caravan.  ;)
