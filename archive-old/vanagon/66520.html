Subject:      Question

Hello,

        I am a new owner of a 88 Westfalia (camper version). I am looking
for an additional middle to bench to add to my camper when I need to
transport more people in my van. I know it exist but cannot put my hands
on the specs in order to know that I am looking for the right stuff. Can
you help or can you tell me where to find the info (the Wolkswagon
dealers are not a big help on this one since all they say is that it has
to be custom made and cost a bundle)
        Can you help? I would appreciate any bit of info you could
provide me with.
        Merci beaucoup...               Delphine
