Subject: Re: 71' engine update part 2 -- please help!


&gt;When I got my bus it had some wierd adjustment screws in it.  They had
&gt;small ball&amp;socket joints on the end of them, and a flat surface on the
&gt;ball.  Pretty clever, cause it allowed a consistant flat surface against
&gt;the tip of the valve.  Maybe you can find some of these for your engine?
&gt;Maybe they were Porsche parts?  Anyone know?

These are sold in the bus stop catalog.  I have considered going this route, 
but do these adjustment screws &quot;spin&quot; the valves?  I know the stock ones are 
designed to hit the valve stem off center and spin the valve.
