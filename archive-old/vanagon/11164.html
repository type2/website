Subject: Got manuals &amp; checks.  Agog now.

Thanks to Ron and Pat and Michael for your generous recompense for the 
Westy manual copies.

Ron, your check's already in the bank.  Dinner was excellent, thank you.:-)

Pat, now I see what Sami (I think) said about keeping your tent from 
filling up with water.  Thanks for the bux, too.

Michael, you dog of a Canadian, you.  I'm coming up to rob your house.  That 
brochure like, totally _roools_, Beavis.  Thanks for spending $645.00 CDN 
for the postage to send it here.  'Course that's only about $1.98 US. ;-}

Who was it that wanted a copy of the gas heater manual for their early 
60's bus?

Heh-aheheh.  This list is _cool_.

Busshead.
