Dan Houg asked:

&gt;anyone have experience with the &quot;PC 300&quot; model 110v inverter?  They 
&gt;are about 70$ now and was wondering if anyone has used it.
&gt;
&gt;it is rated for 500watts intermittent and i've heard either 300w or 
&gt;150w continuous...  seems there's a disparity in the rating.

I just tested the PC300 inverter. It clearly says 300 W continuous, 500 W
intermittent, but 150 W is probably closer to the truth.

I ran two gadgets, an old 12 inch black and white TV and a small Black and
Decker sander. The TV is rated at .75 A and ran fine. The 1.6 A sander was
turned on and off repeatedly and sometimes the inverter would deliver and
sometimes it would not. 

&quot;300 W&quot; means that the inverter should be able to deliver 300W/120V=2.5A.
The deep-cycle battery is in good shape as far as I know and should be
well charged thanks to the solar panels. (Bob Hoover: the charge
controller is working and I'll report the good news to the list this
coming week.)

Conclusion: I wish I could return the whimpy PC300 and get the next larger
model. Unfortunately, I already cut off the cigarete lighter adaptor from
the cord for a more permanent installation. :-(
