Subject:      Re: CB Antennas and stuff

I have been struggling with this one.  I don't WANT another antennae that
can be seen.  I used to have a great antenna before some person with no
genitals broke off most of the antenna. I have another on now but my range
isn't good.  What I wanted to do was put full length antenna (maybe 2?) up
under the long edge of my poptop.  This would leave them horizontal and I'm
not sure what problem that would be.  My CB is in-dash.  The only thing you
see is the handset and cord.  The original owners specified this at the dealer
and traded the tape player for the option.  I like it a lot but need some
more power.  Is there a booster I can add?
