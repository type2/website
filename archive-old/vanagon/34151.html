Subject: re:M-codes

All,

I wonder if we might be able to convince VW of America, or better yet
VWAG to put that info up on thier web page, thus saving one of us from
doing the work, and they would have every M-code available to them.  As
long as we're at it maybe we then could work on them to make their
micro-fiche/CD-ROM thingie accessable from thier web page as well, for
part # lookups, so that we no longer need to pester the dealers for the
info.

What do you think?

Cheers,

David
