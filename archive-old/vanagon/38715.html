Subject:       '88 Power Steering - Update

After studying the Bentley trying to solve my uneven steering 
resistance problem, I decided I'd try the method they suggest, 
although without the fancy gauge.

So with wheels off the ground, engine off, the wheel turns and gets 
stiff at about every 1/2 turn throughout. Hmmm. Start engine, same 
thing. Listened for bearing noise in column - very little. So I'm 
thinking, it doesn't seem like a rack would do this if it were going. 
Seems like a sticking universal joint or something. Then I spot the 
&quot;transfer gear&quot; housing as the book calls it. It mentions to grease 
it with steering gear grease (?) and that it's not repairable - must 
be replaced. It does *not* say how to get them d*mn thing out...

So: Does it sound likely that this thing is the cause?
Has anyone removed it before? Where do I get the special grease from?

ps: I also have a bit of a dilemma - I've got a few more days to 
claim stuff under the dealer warranty where they will cover 50% cost, 
so I'm wondering if I should tell them to replace the rack, gearbox, 
pump, etc &amp; pay  the 50%, or just wait &amp; do the work when it does go 
for good, and get the parts at a wrecker. Although the steering seems 
to be original with 320K km, the pump is quiet &amp; no signs of leaks. 
Any advice?

Thanks!

Shawn :)
