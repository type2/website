Subject: re EV clutch ped. tension spring

&gt;
&gt;could one of my fellow EVers w/ stick shift tell me where the
&gt;upper anchor point for the clutch pedal tension spring is?
&gt;i know where the lower anchor point is, but the upper part
&gt;of the spring went rocketing up into the lower part of the dash
&gt;somewhere...

Well, looking at the pedal cluster assembly picture, it's going to be
hard to describe! But I'll try:
There is a large metal piece called the mounting bracket through which a
pivot pin runs that holds both the clutch and brake pedals in place.
Attached to the passenger compartment side of this bracket is another piece of
metal, somewhat L-shaped,  with 4 holes on the large side, and  a smaller
hole on the bent side. It looks like the spring either fits into that hole,
or else fits over a pin sticking out of that hole.

The front of the plate looks something like this:

-----------------+
|  0    0     0  |
+-----------+    |
            | O  |
            +----+

and the view from the top:

|
| &lt;&lt;&lt; - spring hooks in over here
|
+-----------------

Okay, I went out to look just to see for myself - the right holes of this plate
line up with the brake pedal, and has a switch hooked to it; the left-most
hole contains some sort of electro-mechanical plunger attached to the
clutch pedal, and thus lines up with the clutch pedal.
Anyway, the hole where the spring goes is pretty obvious - it's that big
one right over the pedal. A bit of grease around it.

While I was looking under there, I found this piece of paper stuck under
some wires. Has a VW logo, some German labeling, and a bunch of code
numbers.
Who knows. I put it back - maybe somebody was stopping a rattle with it!
