Subject: Re: model 235

does anyone have a suggestion on what vendor makes the best 
repro vinyl pullback rooves for a 1960 bus?
 
basically a bus (model 235 komb w/ factory sunroof _and_ bellypans) i am 
hopefully soon to own has a cracked pullback roof that will need to be
replaced 
and i need to know which vendor to go w/

also i may ave rehashed this thread but does anyone have any idea what the 
relative scaricity of model 235 is nad if the 60' would have come w/ a
&quot;bastard&quot; 
engine??                                                ^^^^^^^^

nice score!

Wolfsberg West makes good sunroof vinyls.  I have used one and it fits well,
looks good.

There aren't many non deluxes sunroof splits around, I'd say they are all
fairly scarce, whether they came with the 'bastard' motor or not.
