Subject:      Oil Plug, Where get sleeve?

Rats!  The new replacment plug won't work.  The engine threads are stripped!
So many list folks have advised the sleeve to be inserted.  Where do I order
it from? In the mean time what is the proper way to use the rubber plug and
I use it several times?
     I want the engine to be right, but I also hate that the lowest point on
the engine is now the stem sticking down from taht oil plug.  I can just
picture som rock knocking into it and all that oil coming out!
