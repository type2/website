Subject: OEM cupholders/Wal-Mart

Due to Wal-Mart's new sensoship policy they will no longer be offering
cupholders that have ties to VW campers. A company spokesperson says VW
OEM style cupholders reflect on the past days in which VW campers
symbalized drug use and free thinking. Everyone will have to go to
K-mart.
