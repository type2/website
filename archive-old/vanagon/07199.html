Subject: Re: replacing old pop-top screen
Date: Mon, 28 Nov 94 17:22:31 PST

&gt;Alice Gibb asks:

&gt; Does anyone have any suggestions on how to replace/repair the pop-top
&gt; screen for an '81 Westfalia?  Ours has numerous holes in it, but the canvas
&gt; of the top is intact, so I don't want to replace the entire thing.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;  The screens on my pop-top are patched in several places (by the previous
  owner). The screen material is available in tent repair kits at places
  like REI. I think I remember seeing bulk amounts available in the Campmor
  catalog.

  Where the screens are torn, a new piece of material has been placed over the
  tear and stitched around.
