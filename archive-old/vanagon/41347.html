&gt;J-tubes and a merged header system with a bung welded right after the

&gt;might be a great solution?  Could get the bigger tube performance bug
&gt;stuff to match ports better.  Anyone want to touch this, I am
&gt;admittedly WAY
&gt;out here.  But with the extracto pipe and muffler and J tubes totaling
&gt;about
&gt;$100 for reasonable quality stuff, and hell you can get the O2 sensor
&gt;bung
&gt;ready to weld on from anyone selling the Haltech O2 sensor add on kits
&gt;for
&gt;maybe $10, pay somebody $10 to weld it on, and you got the whole system
&gt;for about 1 tube cost (whoops, minus the converter, but one might work
&gt;it
&gt;in as well).

Two flanges on the WB in th wrong direction for the J pipes to fit.  DANSK
pipes are not as heavy,(flanges and pipes) as OEM.  Don't fitt as well and
even more prone to crack at the flanges, but they do work.
