Subject: RV battery for vanagon
Date: Tue, 16 Apr 96 11:14:55 PDT

OK, what is going on??!!  I am checking out my newly acquired '80 vanagon
Westphalia and I notice that the auxilary battery is low on water; the plates
are partially exposed.  Also I notice that the battery is NOT a deep discharge
type.  So I think to myself, &quot;This battery is probably damaged (because the 
plates are partially exposed).  I will replace it because of the probable 
damage and because it should be a deep cycle battery, not a conventional
starter battery.&quot;

To my amazement, and horror, I discover that the battery well is VERY shallow;
only 7&quot; deep.  The only battery which will fit is a group 42 which is NOT
available as a deep cycle!  Was Volkswagon really that dumb or were there
suitable deep cycle, group 42 batteries available in 1980?  Short of modifying
the battery box, does anyone have any suggestions?  Is there a supplier of 
group 42 deep cycle batteries which I have been unable to find?
