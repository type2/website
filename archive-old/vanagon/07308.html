Subject: Re: Gas mileage

The fuel gauge in my '81 westy seems to work progressively and
correctly.  I nearly always fill up (and I use super) when it registers
1/4 tank full, and at that point, my trip odometer usually registers
175 miles.  This is with a fully loaded camper, just after an engine
rebuild, and in combination city and highway driving average.
