Subject: 91 Vanagon w/ large gas leak!!

I have a 91 gl that has had limited problems until now. When I fill the gas
tank to the top as I have always done in the past with no problem the tank
overflows all over the gas station floor. I can not see where it is
overflowing but it is coming from the top of the tank somewhere under the
car. This only happens when the pump hits its full mark and stops. It is kind
of scary because there is gas everywhere. There goes the environment. It just
started this week. Has anyone had this problem and know what to do. Could it
be a recall problem that was never fixed. I am the second owner. Thanks
everyone!!
