A number of people have asked me about the Parts Catalogue detailing every
part available from VW.

It is entitled:
VW Genuine Parts Illustrated Catalogue
Typ 2 Mod. 80 -&gt; 85     000.7340.74.89

I ordered it from VW Heritage Parts Centre, Unit 5, Freeman's Road,
Portslade, Sussex BN41 1SL, UK. Tel: (0044) 1273 424330. It was GB#4 plus
postage plus VAT.

It shows every part labelled by page number and illustration number, but
does not give the part number itself. The VW dealer's microfiche version
has the numbers as well.

Other models listed are:
Typ/Mod                  Order No
Typ 2 Mod. 68 -&gt; 79      000.7340.82.89
Typ 2 Mod. 80 -&gt; 85      000.7340.74.89
Typ 2 Mod. 86 -&gt; 87      000.7340.64.89
Typ 2 Mod. 88 -&gt;         000.7340.92.89
Typ 2 Syncro             000.7340.57.89

I presume they are all the same price.

BTW thank you for the recommendation about the Bentley manual. I have now
bought one (GB#60) and it looks great. I will just have to be careful about
the difference between the USA models and the UK ones eg UK is carbs not
FI.
