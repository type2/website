Subject: Value of '66 camper

        I just came accross a 66 or 67 bus and asked around, found the
owner and got a price. All is in relatively good condition. Has minimal
rust in all the usual areas, hasn't been run in a year but the engine seems
fine. I would like to know what a reasoneable asking price is.

PS I'me in WI if that makes any difference
