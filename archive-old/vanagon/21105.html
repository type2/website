&gt;&gt; I got the crew cab home this weekend and the heat riser tube on the dp
&gt;&gt; manifold is rusted thru and broken on the left side. Is there a way to fix
&gt;&gt; this or do I need a new manifold. I know this is important for
&gt;&gt; driveability, warmup, etc, so I want to have it working.
&gt;
&gt;I'd rather have it, than not.  DP intake manifolds should be cheap at
&gt;junkyards.  I have several I couldn't sell for $1 each at a swap-meet.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Can the stock, cheap beetle mufflers be used on '68-'71 type 2s?
&gt;
&gt;Yes, they can.  If the tailpipes rub on the bumper, bend them down.

I've done this too.  Twice.  No problem.  From what I understand, it'll
even goose a few more hp's outta your engine.  Less restrictive or some
such.

&gt;&gt; Also, what causes the trans to jump out of fourth gear when it gets worn.
&gt;&gt; What parts need to be replaced to fix this. It would be nice to have it
&gt;&gt; right instead of using the bungee method, although the bungee method is
&gt;&gt; probably much cheaper.
&gt;
&gt;You answered your own question.  Wear makes these transaxles jump out of
&gt;gear.  I'd get a rebuilt transaxle, or buy William Claspy's, wpc_at_po.cwru_dot_edu,
&gt;good used box.

You *could* drain the tranny, refill it with good tranny oil, maybe some
STP or similar tranny additive and see what happens.  But personally, I
like Richard's solution ;-)  I might even have a DP intake manifold I could
add to the deal!

Cheers!
Bill
