Subject:      85 VANAGON starters

I am getting warning signals from my starter/solenoid.  Sometimes (not
always)the starter engages but cannot turn over the engine for a second or
two.  So far it has started each time.  Replaced the starter and solenoid
at 70k miles I think for a similar problem but don't remember details.  Now
at 145k miles.  The battery specific gravity still shows in the full charge
 range in warm weather on all cells and is less than one year old.
Terminals all are clean.

Anyone out there experience a similar situation?  Do Vanagon
starters/solenoids have about a 75k mile life before needing brushes or new
solenoid contacts?

Larry
