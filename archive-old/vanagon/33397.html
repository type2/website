..
Saw &quot;Riders of the Purple Sage&quot; last night. Couldn't help noticing
that the brand on top of the gate to the lady's ranch, was a V perched
upon the center peak of a W. All it lacked was a circle around the
whole thing. Any truth to the rumor that Volkswagens were only 3-volt
back in those days?   :^)
