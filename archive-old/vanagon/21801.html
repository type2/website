For Sale:
1958 Bus. *Original* safari windows. '65 Tranny, '70 engine. Rust along 
the bot
tom, but I have all the replacement panels to fix it up. Never been hit. 
No rea
r seats. I have new body panels, ALL new rubber seals, four new low 
profile tir
es, new chrome rims, and a box full of original odds 'n ends. (Door 
handles, et
c...)
$2500 into it so far, part with it for $1500. It's in Longmont, Colorado; 
which
 is by Denver and Boulder. I'll negotiate a bit on the price too.
