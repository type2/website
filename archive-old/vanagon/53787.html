Hi All!
I've been off for a while, but just graduated, so I'm planning to spend some time with 
my '85 Retrowestie (the Duckmobile) while I'm waiting for a job offer to come through 
from Singapore :-)

Problem: the Duckmobile is at 92.5 k, the exhaust system needs replacing, and it has 
developed the &quot;head leak.&quot;

Symptoms: oil on left two spark plugs (right ones always black)
	-decreased gas mileage
	-engine uses about 1 qt oil every 500 mi
	-oil on the underside of the engine block, where the two halves meet
	-THICK blue smoke (like in the cartoons, when the bad guy gets away)

I recall some people mentioning that they got this problem repaired, on VW, through some 
kind of warranty or recall. Does anyone know the deal on this?
Otherwise I would like to fix it myself, with Bentley and luck by my side.  Reading 
through the archives I learned that two possibilities would be to either repair head and 
replace seals, or replace both.  Do I decide when I get the thing taken apart?
What other parts should I replace, since I'l have the engine disassemlbed (piston rings, 
etc.?), what should I look out for, and how long should I plan for the job, once I have 
all the replacement parts I need?

Congrats on the Inuvik trip! I only wished I could have gone!

TIA
Mark
