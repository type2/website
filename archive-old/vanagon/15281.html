&gt;That is too much a waste for vanagon miles. Maybe it's time to get a

Generically speaking, any VW 1.8 with at least 90bhp should be spunky
enough for you to use as a daily commuter/beater car.  

I think Jettas (A2) are pretty cool; I drive my wife's every chance I get...

Driving a type 2 is all about a frame of mind; I'd be nuts to drive the
EV like I do the GLI, but every now and then, I get a case of Ric-itis  ;)

BTW, that wasn't me that went zipping around your vanagon, as I don't do
that commute...
