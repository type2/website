Sorry, David, but it is just the other way round. The proper German brand 
name is Westfalia. It is derived from Westfalen, which is a region and a 
former county in the West of Germany. The firm is located in
Rheda-Wiedenbrueck, a small town in Westfalen.

BTW, the Westphalian Peace was signed in Muenster, which is also located 
in Westfalen.
