Subject: Worth it all

We all know the feeling, that after thousands of hours slaving over our 
buses to get them running just right, of started them up and driving 
around.  The satisfaction, joy, and excitement.  for me none of it ever 
goes way.  Every time i have to drive I look forward to it, and even try 
to drive more often then I sometimes have to.  But sometimes things 
happen that make it all even more enjoyable.  This happened a couple of 
days ago when i was driving on a major interstate in slow moving 
traffic.  I came up behind a chevy &quot;boat&quot; in which two children were 
sitting.  They were just hanging out enjoying the ride.  The one of them 
turned around and looked at me, quickly he turned and swatted his 
sibling and they both excitedly started pointing at me and yelling at 
each other.  Then they started giving each other the peace sign, oh boy I 
thought here it comes.  Sure enough they gave it to me, and when i 
returned it I unleashed the biggest smiles I've seen in a while.  I saw 
an opportunity to move a lane over and get further along in the traffic, 
and when I did so i passed their car.  The kids shouted beep beep at me 
as i passed, so i returned it with the classic VW horn.  That little 
incident kept me smiling for the rest of the trip.  Man I love driving my 
bus!
