Subject: Got me a T1 Type 2


Question my sanity...go ahead! I just bought a somewhat rusty (the 
roof has holes in it) 1962 Type II. Why? Because it has cargo
doors on both sides! Also because 1963 was the last full year
for Type 2s having the 40 hp engine, the small rear cargo
hatch, etc. Besides having the dual cargo doors, this one still
has the cardboard/glass divider between the cab and the 
cargo area.

Now all I have to do is to find some place to store it, as well
as a whole T1 Type 2 roof section. Oh, yeah, it has its original
bumpers (sitting in the van).

Joel Walker...you can add another entry to your van list for me!
