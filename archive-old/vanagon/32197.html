        Hi YAS          

        While roaming the highways this week.

        I finally stopped at the All Star Auto Wrecking,

        In corning Ca. Ya can see it from I-5, just north

        of the microwave repeater towers.

        I have driven past it a lot.

        Spent an hour browsing, Hardly any thing Volks wise

        4, 1970-80 model busses with hardly any thing left on or         
        in them and about twice as many Bugs.

        While there I picked up a copy of 
        
        Northern Ca. Auto Dismantlers Association

        Membership Directory. 106 Members listed.

        Not all yards are not members I guess.

        Some of the list seem to Auto,type orentated too.

        ie... All Dodge Truck &amp; Van, All Japanese Auto ect...

        This list covers 209, 707 and 916 area coads

        If any one is interested in this I'll scann it 

        and it post to the list.      

        Laurie
