Subject: Re: How I got home from work (broken clutch cable)

&gt;Why stop to fix it at all?  When this happens to me, I just drive it home
&gt;and fix it there.  You just gotta (look both ways first) put the bus in
&gt;first gear, turn the starter over until the bus starts and give it some gas.
&gt;You just gotta get the revs of the engine just right (so that the rpms of
&gt;the engine match the rpms of the tranny?) before you make a decisive shift
&gt;into second and so on.  When you get good enough at it, the gears hardly
&gt;grind at all..

And double-clutching is no big deal: I learned how on the family '39 Ford.
Only took a couple of weeks and a bit of gnashing of teeth, both automotive
and paternal. But it is fun in a VW! Best of all was the VW Standard which
I don't think ever made it to these shores: it had a non-synchro
transmission, and double-clutching was absolutely necessary for
down-shifting.
