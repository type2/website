i might add my $0.02 (rapidly depreceating Canadian dollar) i think the
pans we are referring to are slightly different. Some 68-79 Kombi's and
Westy's had the belly pans that fit under the middle of the van to cover
the heater tube etc. whereas the splits had a pan that bolted underneath
the front pedals etc. to keep the cables free of road grime. do others know
more than i (entirely likely!!!!!!). Were there &quot;skid plates&quot; or whatever
you want to call them available on post 68' vans (i,e,the pan that bolts
underneath the the cab section's pedals and cables?

Da belly-pan only covers the area underneath the driver's feet.
