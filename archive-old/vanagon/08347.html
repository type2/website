Subject: Re: galley plugs

&gt;if they pop out (due to extremely high oil pressure), then you lose all of
&gt;your oil very quickly. :(  but i've NEVER heard of one popping out. and i
&gt;would think that the pressure required to blow that plug out would have
&gt;already split the filter and damaged a few other things ... before the plug
&gt;let go.

I had one pop out in my '72 bus. I had less than 100 miles on a factory 
rebuilt engine back in 1985 or so and I was parked overnight in Mount
Snow ski area in Vermont. I went outside at 8am at -15 degrees F and 
turned the key.

The motor ran OK but after about two mins I noticed that the oil light was
still on and I want out to look. All the oil had splurshed out of the engine 
into the snow and a little metal plug had poped out. I picked it up and 
it still sits here on my desk as I write. 

The end of the story is that I had the van towed back to the dealer and they
put a new plug in.
