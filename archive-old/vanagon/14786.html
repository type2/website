  Well, while we may never rival the West Coast gatherings, at least a
few of us made it at the same time this weekend. My friend Sean and i
arrived Saturday around 4-ish, and soon after were joined by Mike, in
his '84 Vanagon. After a while, Dave and Janet showed up in the most
beautiful '76 Westy I have ever seen. As all you air-cooled folks know,
the front floors are among the first to go, well, their front floor
still had SHINY paint. not even a rust bubble in sight. Man, it was
beautiful. 
   Anyway, we all hung out for a while, until the ranger began
instructing us on the differences between camping, and picnicing, and
so, because of many different reasons, we all headed home before the
gates closed. 
  So, at least we are getting more folks each time. perhaps next time...
  Also, anyone going to the Farmington VW show this weekend? Ihave been
trying to get in touch with a campground near there, and perhaps anyone
else going could camp there...
Richard
