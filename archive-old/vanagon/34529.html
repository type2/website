    In a message dated 96-02-04 13:36:05 EST, Some Poor Schmuck writes:
    
    &gt;I'm not getting any VW mail.  Would someone please explain.

two possibilities:

(1) A dedicated amateur mechanic, vehicle conservator
and investor in spare parts was describing on this
very list an anatomically impossible act that he
wished the thief of his semaphores to perform and
your ISP, frightened by Senator Exon and the CDA,
had installed trapdoor filters on your mailfeed
that were triggered thereby.  A bill for this
protection will arrive on or about 15 April.

(2) &quot;S.P. Schmuck&quot; is a nom de plume and really
belongs to a logician turned epidemiologist who
wondered if anyone would fail to notice that in
so positing that he can receive no mail, a reply
thereby self-identifies those respondents having
no logic to spare this month.  A prospectus for
an investment opportunity for people with no money
will doubtless arrive by the evening post.
