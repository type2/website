&lt;&lt; Immediately I have received several questions about digest mode and I 
 know nothing about it?
 
 I have not heard from anyone regarding my post to the list asking for 
 information.
 
 I hope some kind listee who has digest experience would look at 
 yesterdays post and answer the questions I put forth.  I will collect the
 &gt;&gt;


I used to get the &quot;other&quot; bus list in digest, before I got booted off that
OVERMODERATED list..... ( do you realize on the aforementioned list, they
have &quot;public floggings&quot; where it is announced to the whole list by the &quot;Man
in the Big House&quot; that an &quot;offending&quot; listmember is being canned....)

anyway, I digress...  grrrrr...

I saw no real advantage to digest, as you cannot directly respond to
postings, and you get everything late.  The only reason I got digest at the
time was that I had compu$erve and the mailbox limit was only 100. On a busy
Friday between the &quot;other&quot; bus list and V_at_L I used to lose messages on CSi
before I switched servers to &quot;wonderful&quot; AOL.....  ;&lt;)
