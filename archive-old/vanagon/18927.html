Subject: your '91 Syncro

Hi Ethan,

I'd love to know how you and your '91 Syncro are getting along.  I'm in
northern VA and due to our winters and my occupation, am searching for a
reliable '89-'91 Syncro poptop.  I know they're scarce, so I'm open to all
suggestions.

&gt;From my experiences so far with VW volks, I'm going to enjoy camping with a
diverse and good group of people.  Tomorrow I'll settle for a day cycling
trip on the C&amp;O canal...

Tally-ho      :-)
