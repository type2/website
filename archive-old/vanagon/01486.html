Subject: Re: Door handles

Hey I bought an 82 Westfalia in Palo Alto (post doc at Hoover) and drove 
it back to Canada. Stanford is a great University. We lived near Santa 
Yinez  on Campus. Do you know a guy named Roland?

Sorry to hear about your break in, but livingin E. palo Alto what did you 
expect? Try either Fred's Garage or Greg's VW both in Menlo Park for 
parts And also look for a guy named Hans in a 71 bus. He too lives in E&gt; 
Palo Alto. -----DC

&gt; Folks,
&gt; 
&gt; Since someone else brought up the subject (even though it was 
&gt; originally on the newsgroup), I thought I'd add my question/
&gt; comment on the subject of door handles.  I found it annoying
&gt; when I got my bus that the side door cannot (apparently) be
&gt; unlocked without the key.
&gt; 
&gt; That was until (I think) I left the front passenger door open
&gt; with a bicycle in the back.  I live in East Palo Alto, a 
&gt; high-crime area near Stanford University, so bicycles are
&gt; very sought-after items when left for the taking.  Some
&gt; person tried to relieve me of the bike, but was thwarted
&gt; when he realized that the side door would not open no
&gt; matter how hard he cranked on the handle.  The reason I know
&gt; this is that the next morning I found pieces of the handle
&gt; in the back of the bus!  The bike was still there, as was 
&gt; about $200 worth of (non-camera) photographic equipment.
&gt; I am thankful both that the door did not open and that the
&gt; would-be thief did not realize the value of the equiment
&gt; despite a remaining price tag.
&gt; 
&gt; My problem now is that _I_ can't open the door from the
&gt; inside, with or without a key.  Anyone have an idea how
&gt; easy it might be to get a replacement door handle?
&gt; ..and while I'm at it, how easy is it to replace the
&gt; window crank (on the front door)?
&gt; 
&gt; I appreciate any help/advice/comments....
