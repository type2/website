Subject: Re: Drivability issue revisited-intermittent stalling

&gt;Tim,
&gt;I too have has in intermittent stalling on my 86 and have replace the harness
&gt;on the air box.  This did not solve the problem.  They are very easy to
&gt;replace.  I also had a new throttle switch installed. I was told that this
&gt;could resolve the stalling. It didn't.  Yesterday I was told over this very
&gt;net service that I could check the fuel injection and fuel pump relays.
&gt; Located in the black box above the coil. Two little square fuse like dealies
&gt;inside the box, check for corrosion. I just replaced mine.  It was late so I
&gt;didn't drive it, so I should know the prognosis today.  I also noticed that
&gt;the harness wires for the O2 sensor had been on the header pipes and burnt
&gt;through in one place. I'm not sure wether it was recent or not. These
&gt;harness' are expensive, $ 129.00 so make sure that the wiring is zip tied to
&gt;the frame and other wires and doesn't hang free to allow it to touch any part
&gt;of the exaust.  Maybe that was the problem all along.  Will know later.  If
&gt;you find anything new about your Van that remedied the problem let me know.
&gt; This has been driving me crazy for 6 weeks now.
&gt;

Eric,

I bought the harness today and will install it the next time I change oil.
With regard to the fuel injection a friend of mine experienced a similiar
problem to mine and all he did was start to use injection cleaner additive
to his gas for a couple of tank fulls and stalling/sputterring problems
went away.  BTW my friend also had to replace these O2 wires because they
fried on the exhaust system and he also had a bad O2 sensor--all of which
when he fixed these problems the sputtering and driveability problems
resolved.

Let me know if your problem is fixed.
