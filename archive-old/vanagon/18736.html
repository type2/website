&gt;What is a GOOD brand of spark plug wires that could be used on  an
&gt;82 Westy? It seems that the air-cooled engine gets so hot in that little
&gt;compartment of his, that the wires get &quot;fried out of service&quot; after about
&gt;6 months or so.  I need a set of spark plug wires that are good

?? six months!!??  in 6 years of my 80 bus, i only had two sets of wires
(and only changed them cause i had an end connector go bad, so, according
to paranoid maintenance thinking ... the wires must have caused it! ;)

yeah, i know the vw brand is outrageously priced, but you should be able to
get bosch brand from somewhere else. surely they would last longer than
six months.  hopefully?

&gt;BTW, the 82 Westy is gasoline powered... not diesel.

:)  i wuz gonna say something, but i won't.  not this time. nosirreeebob.
not me. ;)
