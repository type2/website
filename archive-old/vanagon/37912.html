Subject: RE: new category on the stats?


&gt;Ellis and his alter ego are rallying around the new category of
&gt;&quot;Retro-rust.&quot;  Take a vehicle that has been restored to original condition,
&gt;submerge it in salt water for a full year then drive it in Michigan for a
&gt;winter or two. I guess the next step would be to sell it to either
&gt;D.Easterwood or B. Hufford! ;)

Or Hoover-- it would be in as &quot;good&quot; condition as Grendel was.

Sounds like a plan...   :^)
