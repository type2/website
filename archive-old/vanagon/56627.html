Subject: Tires for VW Buses

Over the last couple of months there has been a lot of interest in what tires 
to use with VW buses.

This is a tough subject to address since VW buses do not use mainstream tires. 
 Finding the right tire can be difficult.

If you would take a minute to fill out the following form, I'll be happy to 
produce a summary of bus tire use on the two lists and post it.


                 Bus type (passenger/camper/commercial):
                                            Year (1977):
              Engine type (air/water/diesel/conversion):

                                     Tire size (185R14):
                    Load range (blank/reinforced/6PR/C):
                                  Tire brand (Michelin):
                                   Tire design (Loredo):
                             Type of rims (steel/alloy):

Front inflation pressure, indicate psi/kPa/bar (44 psi):
 Rear inflation pressure, indicate psi/kPa/bar (44 psi):

                              Wear (bad/good/excellent):
                          Traction (bad/good/excellent):
                              Ride (bad/good/excellent):
                          Handling (bad/good/excellent):
                             Noise (bad/good/excellent):
