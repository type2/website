&gt; 
&gt; Regardless of where I set the levers on the fresh-air and heat controls, air
&gt; continues to come through the vents in my '85 Vanagon.  Anyone else have
&gt; this problem? Will I have to go through what Gerry is going through with his
&gt; malfunctioning heater (i.e. dash removal, separating heater housings, etc.)?

This may be a silly question, but which vents does the air come from.
You do know that the dash vents are not regulated by the fresh-air and
heat controls, but rather are opened and closed via a lever beside each
vent.  When I close everything off I get very little air flow, just a
nice whistle.
