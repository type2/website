Subject: unusual sightings

Just got back from Casper, WY, where my daughter was playing in the western
regional soccer championships.  (they lost in the 1/4-finals - darn!)  While
traveling to and fro, I took a few detours thru some of the small towns
along the way.  (Hope springs eternal in the heart of this wannabus).  

Saw a couple of interesting busses in Casper, but not for sale.  

Also saw an interesting Bug in Douglas, WY - had a small Chevy v-8 installed
up front.  

And - in the small town of Wheatland, WY - I saw what appeared to be a
salvage yard with 80-100 '56 - '57 chevy's.  2 drs, 4 drs, convertibles, and
station wagons.  All lined up nice and neat.

keep smiling
