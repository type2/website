Subject: Re: BusBoys~catalogs and more...(less?)


&gt;
&gt;I have an idea on how to deal with outfits like busboys, etc....
&gt;
&gt;Is it possible to get a &quot;collection&quot; of the bus boys traffic that has gone 
&gt;on this list lately, and first off &quot;sanitize&quot; the individual e-mail messages 
&gt;by dropping off the e-mail addresses and anyother personal identifiers.
&gt;
&gt;Next we take a copy of Joel's weekly list. To that we add a letter that 
&gt;basically says: &quot;there has been a bunch of negative traffic regarding your 
&gt;product/service. It is obvious that you have a practice of ignoring 
&gt;individual customers, requests, etc. Can you afford to ignore such a large, 
&gt;world-wide group of potential consumers?&quot;
&gt;
&gt;I would also CC copies of the packet to VWTrends (T&amp;A) and DBHVWs....
&gt;
&gt;Just a suggestion....sort of guerilla warfare against a$$holes.
&gt;

I have been folowing this thread but I haven't saved the actual messages.
If some one wants to put together something coherent I will be driving
through Redding CA this friday and I can hand the complaints to them,
sometimes haveing someone standing in front of a person with a written
complaint gets a reaction (of course their reaction might be rather
unpleasant...hmm...).

Just a thought, but I will be driving past thier store friday.
