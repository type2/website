&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone know of a way to grease a throttle cable without removing it.?  My
&gt; cable in my 1987 Syncro is beginning to bind and makes some weird noises when
&gt; the accelerator pedal is depressed. The problem seems to be worse during colder
  You may want to take it out for a look. One likely source of binding and 
  noise is that some of the strands of the cable may be already broken and
  getting &quot;tangled&quot; in the guide tube. I don't know how hard it is to change
  the cable in a Vanagon or how much they cost, but I'll bet it's more 
  convenient to change it at home then have it break on the road somewhere.
