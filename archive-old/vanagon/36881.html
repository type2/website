Find out exactly what the zoning laws and car registration laws are.
I used to have a neighbor in North Carolina who had several semi-
operable cars in the street in front of his house (surprise surprise).
The cops ticketed those cars, but he just drove them onto the lawn.
He got away with this for awhile, until they got on him about
&quot;unlawful storage sheds&quot; or something.  Anyway, the local law was
that unregistered cars could be behind the house but not in front.
Maybe there's a loophole for you somehow.  Get some local artist
to sign them and declare your yard a &quot;sculpture garden&quot; with
work in progress.
