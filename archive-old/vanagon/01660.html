Subject: Re: delta six industries

say,
derek sez he called delta six.  say do you have the number.  i could use a
new city water connection for my '84 westy.  i called them once and got an
answering machine and they never called back.  so i put it aside since i had
a jillion other projects (transmission, engine, a/c)

also, the blinking coolant warning light.  mine started blinking and wouldn't
stop.  after weeks of trouble shooting and reverse engineering the idiot
light circuits.  i found a bad capacitor in the actual guage that is a time
out circuit for the comparison circuit that allows the LED to flash for 5
seconds at startup.  well it was a ton of work but i saved a hundred dollars
in parts and labor (i recall the guage is $130 at the dealer), someone elses
labor anyway :)
