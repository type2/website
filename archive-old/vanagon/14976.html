&gt;Here's my &quot;me too&quot; to the list of who's going to the VW show this Saturday
&gt;in Farmington NC.
&gt;
&gt;-gary

The information I have on the Farmington, NC IVWA show is for Sunday
April 9.  Since there seems to be some confusion about the date, does
someone know for sure what the actual date is?

Inquiring minds with too many buses want to know.

Dave
