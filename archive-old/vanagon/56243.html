Subject: Mileage.....


Regarding the mileage thread:

The beauty is *finding* a treasured bus with low mileage from someone who
was not a VeeDubber at heart! (Or was, but lovingly cared for it). You all
will have to admit that you'd rather buy one with the sought-after lo-miles
rather than the one with 2-300k. C'mon, admit it now! ;*)

I just found (in Jan '97) this '89 that had been stored by the original
German owner here in his warehouse, with the 46k. Whenever he came over
here from Genmany, it was used, so at least he has a *legitimate* excuse!
Apparently, he is about 70 years old and does the Iron Man (masters) level.


The interior/exterior is basically as if right from the lot. Time Warp! I
was really *happy* to find this! And at the right price too! Esp. because
of lo miles.

!my 2 cents.......&lt;g&gt;
