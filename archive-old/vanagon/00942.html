     Hello Netters,


         This is my first time posting to the net! Ten years ago I owned
a '69 VW Bus and this year our family needs a low-budget trip out west on
which we will camp every night. So it hit me that a VW camper just might be
the thing. I have already received some very informative files outlining the
bus and vanagon (thanks again), but more info from you would be greatly appreci
ated. My price range will be 3500 or less preferrably. Thanks!!
