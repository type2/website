Subject: Vanagon pricing


I have a yellowy-beige Vanagon 1985.  I am considering selling it because 
it takes my attention away from my '71 bus.  The Vanagon has about 
125,000 on it.  It has new rubber all around.  Its heads have been 
replaced within the last 60,000 miles and a new stud kit installed at the 
time.  CV joints are 20,000 miles old.  No middle seat, and the interior 
could use sprucing up.  Nice non-stock stereo (Nakamichi).

Body has a couple of dings but only a couple of pin sized rust spots at 
the site of some rock nicks.

General notion of what I should ask for such a thing?

Thanks
Tom
