&gt; &gt;About octane:
&gt; &gt;I agree that the VW spec of 91 RON is equivalent to 87 octane available
&gt; &gt;at a US or Canadian pump. But, the syncro 2.1L engine runs VERY MUCH
&gt; &gt;BETTER on 92 to 94 octane.
&gt; 
&gt; My father tried on his '90 2.1L both high and low octane gas. He
&gt; found, that on high octane the van have higher milage and the
&gt; engine have a little bit more power during acceleration.
&gt; 
&gt; I guess, the computer shifts the point of ignition forwards on
&gt; high octane gas and you will take full advantages of the gas firing.
&gt; This is one function of the knock sensor.
&gt; 
&gt; In Germany it is cheaper to drive on the expensive high octane
&gt; gas than using the low octane because of the higher milage.

On the other side of the big wet, we don't get knock sensors. I can't
think of any way that the computer (ECU) would be aware of what octane
is being used. Here in Canada the cost advantage is to use the low
octane 91 RON gas (87 octane). The higher octane costs 17% more and
gives about 10% better milage (if that) but I use the high octane
anyway.
