Subject: Attacking Heat

I'm getting ready to attack the heating problem in my 85 vanagon.  Many 
of you have followed the posts.  

I need to do this on one day - this coming Saturday - and have time to 
get to parts stores if that is an issue.

I'm going to see if I have the right bleeder screw for the rear heater 
and if needed I'll have that on hand.  I'll also get some anti-freeze - 
anyone know off hand how much for a complete refill?  

I expect my Bentley to be here by then so I'll have a book to look at.

The overheat problem is still intermittent, but in the case it's a head 
gasket what do I need to check for there to try to isolate it?

If its a head, I'm obviously not going to fix it on Saturday, but if I 
cna be sure it is not a head (I'd like to isolate that first) I'll try to 
get the van fixed in one day - any reason why I shouldn't?

I'm prepared to replace the thermostat if necessary.  Also, any hoses 
etc.  None are leaking now, but suggestions on replacing any that will 
come up in the course of checkign everything out are welcome.  I'm not 
going to gratuitously replace items that have life left in the, so please 
factor that into any suggestions.
