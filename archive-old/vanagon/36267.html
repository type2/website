Subject: re: 88 Westy - high miles - what to check?

Well,

I have pretty much decided on a 77-83 Westy once I find one... but an 
'88 just came up at the local dealer for $9995 - looks *very nice*.

Has been repainted, but no major rust on seams. New Conti tires. 
Interior looks good. Mileage, well 320,000 km...!

I haven't spoken to them yet, but should I even be considering this 
unit? I believe it has a new or rebuilt engine, but may not have 
papers to prove, and it's from out of province, so I'm thinking I 
could get them down on price.

Is this too much mileage? ie: are there too many other wear related 
items to worry about?

TIA.

Shawn.
