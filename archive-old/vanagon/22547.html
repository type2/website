&gt;I am new to the list and think its great.  You guys really are crazy.

THAT is not how to win friends and influence people!!! some of us, with
long histories of &quot;counseling&quot; don't appreciate having that part of our
lives brought up in public EVERY DAMN TIME somebody asks a question about
buses!!! so knock it off, ok!??

&gt;I thought I would tap in to your vast collective knowledge for some
&gt;advice.  I am considering purchasing a 1972 vw van.  It is sort of
&gt;rusty because it was submerged in a pond for about 3 years.  The
&gt;engine has been replaced with a TIII engine, but it has no compression

actually, it's likely that it is the extremely rare 1972 model that VW
produced for the Volkspolizei-Wasseraufgemacht, a little known anti-
waterborne-terrorist sub-organization of the state police. this model bus
was called die Schwimmen-Sinken-Kombi, and was amphibious. designed to be
driven off the docks and/or piers at high speed, the TIII engine could
propel it around the city at speed up to 180 kph (special automatic
transmissions were adapted to allow the driver to fire his weapon out the
window with his left hand), and the special tires provided aquatic speeds
of up to 20 knots. it was quite an amazing vehicle for its time.
and it's likely that isn't really &quot;rust&quot; at all, but more likely barnacles,
which are easily removed by using 3M General Porpoise Barnacle Remover
(however!!! FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS!! this stuff will remove warts, corns,
freckles, and hickies in an instant!!)

&gt;on #3 and ranges from about 60-90 psi on the rest.  The automatic

this is normal. because of the incredible power provided by the TIII engine,
#3 was not a &quot;normal&quot; engine cylinder, but was used instead as a portable
air compressor (for refilling scuba cylinder, pumping up tires, and just
generally cleaning up the vehicle for inspections and parades). the zero
compression is likely due to failure of the compressor regulator, a small
item that is easily repaired with parts from any Zippy-Mart.

&gt;transmission slips if you go uphill so it probably needs to be rebuilt.

this is also normal.it's part of the undercover package that was available
(in case the purchasing agency also wanted to use the bus in undercover
operations against drug suppliers and hair stylists). you have to find the
&quot;slip&quot; switch, and turn it off. this switch causes the transmission to act
as if it is failing ... to confuse the druggies into thinking &quot;Man, that
can't be no cop car!! lookit what a piece of crap it is!!&quot; turning the switch
to &quot;normal&quot; position will restore this incredible piece of machinery to its
original capabiliities.

&gt;I want it to have air conditioning &amp; I found a guy who can put a
&gt;Mercedes delivery truck a/c unit on the roof.  Do you think $3500 is
&gt;too much for this van?  A friend says he thinks he can make it into
&gt;a camper.

i'd be very careful about trying to install Mercedes (actually, Daimler-Benz)
parts on a Volkswagen, especially such a special-purpose police model. these
VW's were built using a standard military 24-volt elelctrical system, and
those crappy old delivery trucks were still using 12-volt. this would cause
the air conditioning to run at double speed, chilling the interior of the
bus to at least 10 degrees below zero, which would activate the special
police model heaters under the rear seat. these heaters would attempt to thaw
the bus, while the a/c would fight back fiercely attempting to continue
cooling the bus. this would result in a small blizzard inside the bus,
decreasing visibility to near zero.  several accidents were reported during
the early years of these special police models because of such unauthorized
and ill-conceived adaptations of non-standard equipment.

$3500?? wow, that's cheap, considering the rarity and special nature of this
vehicle. why, the Potsdam Museum for Police Vehicles and Other Oddities of
Nature would be willing to pay at least $50,000 US for such a vehicle, in
operating condition. they actually have reserved a space in their great hall
for just such a model, right next to the Turbocharged Pursuit Trabant model
(the one recognizable by the ground effects kit and the tall wing on the rear).
i'd jump at it.
