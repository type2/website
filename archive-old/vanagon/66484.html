Subject:      Re: Sagging on one side - Westys

I was thinking of a stranger option. What about adding a set of air
shocks in the rear and having 2 valves ( 1 for each shock ) then just
add 20-30 lbs more pressure in the left shock for the added weight. It
would let you level the car with any load. Has anyone tried this? What
will it do to handling (if you can call it that in a vanagon)?

&gt;
&gt;Okay gang. Tell me to what degree of craziness this idea is:
&gt;
&gt;I have a liberal Westy (It leans to the left). (1988, 104K miles) It is
&gt;noticeable when the van is empty, more so when the water tank is full.  My
&gt;thinking is that the left springs have sagged a bit because of the extra
&gt;weight.
&gt;
&gt;So, what would happen if I got a spring compressor and swapped the springs
&gt;left to right? The weaker left springs would go on the right. Would this
&gt;have the result of leveling out the Van?
&gt;
&gt;Or is this an exercise in futility?
