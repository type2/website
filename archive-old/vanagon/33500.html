To All,

If you read the fine print regarding lead-acid batteries you'll note that
they lose about 1% of their charge per day due to chemical action caused by
impurities in the lead, water and acid.

A small solar panel capable of delivering half an amp at something over 13
volts can offset this loss, while panels having larger outputs can actually
recharge the battery if given enough time.

Unfortunately, anything that can recharge the battery is also capable of
overcharging it unless some form of control is present.
