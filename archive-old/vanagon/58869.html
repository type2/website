Subject: eurovan paint finish rust

I purchased a 1993 Eurovan almost four years ago.  Recently I noticed 
rust developing in all four wheel wells and along the vertical edge of 
the sliding door.  I have contacted the dealer to pursue a warranty 
claim since the warranty for rust perforation is six years.  I am 
concerned, though, that once rusting of this sort has begun it may be 
impossible to eliminate it entirely.  I am interested to know if any 
other owners of a Eurovan have run into problems with rusting.  I am 
especially interested to know if anyone has any experience with the 
best approach to dealing with this problem.
