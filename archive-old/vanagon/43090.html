Subject: RE:  fuel lines

Vanagons do have factory installed fuel line clamps installed.  However,
they are some kind of special clamps.  I had one of these clamps come
loose and spray a 4 inch wide strip of gas for about a mile down the
freeway.  Fortunately it did not catch on fire.  I replaced the factory
clamps with stainless steel hose clamps.  If you have a Vanagon I would
recommend checking these factory installed clamps to be sure that they are
tight.
