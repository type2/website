&gt;Great work Derek!!
&gt;
&gt;Now we just need to find the settlement for Syncro transmissions (lest 
&gt;our Syncros all wind up on blocks in our front yard while we look for 
&gt;2nd jobs to cover the repair bills).

Well, my syncro is on its 2nd transmission (a $4,000 part) and I only have
40,000 miles on the car!

But actually, this might be because I drive the car through rock-filled mud
boggs, across ranging streams, up unplowed snowmobile trails, over abandoned
stage coach roads over mountain ranges, etc. But I didn't tell VW this
before they signed off on the warranty order!
