Subject: AOL sucks... Help!!

As of friday, I'm outta here.  AOL is a major rip off.  What I want to know
is where else I can go.  Any suggestions??  I don't want anything spiffy, I
don't need online shopping malls or online pet stores or any of the other
shit that AOL has.

Any Suggestion Will Help!

I'm planning on picking up my last mail on Sat. the 9th, so drop a line.  
Thanks a bunch,

Brandy
Eugene, OR
