&gt; something i just noticed:
&gt; 
&gt; if you don't receive any vanagon mail for a few days, you may have been
&gt; dropped from the list. it seems that if your mailbox fills up, some mailers
&gt; will return the email ... and it looks like listserv_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu will
&gt; drop you from the list (in order to protect itself from a flood of bounced
&gt; mail).

In defense of listserv_at_lenti, occassionally it's gsker_at_lenti who deletees 
you because those bounces come back to me.  After about 3 messages saying 
&quot;your mail was undeliverable for 3 days&quot; I remove the name from the 
list.  Imagine 3 people whose mail bounces for three days on the vanagon 
list.  Some days there are close to 100 messages on this list, so that 
means that I get 300 messages saying the mail didn't get through -- EVERY 
DAY!. I can't contact you because all I have is your email address.
