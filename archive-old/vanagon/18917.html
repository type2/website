    Speaking of Corvair Vans, imagine my suprise to see this...
    Coincidence, or fate?  Think my wife will kill me if I get a 6th car?

    350?  Is that displacement?  Air Cooled?  Yikes!


    BTW, if anyone is interested, this is located in:

    PORTLAND, OREGON   USA

You got, it's a corvair van.  Circa '63 or so.  They'd run circles around
the vws of the day.  Frank, an old Vietnam buddy had one with the corsa
140HP motor.  It did go well but left a trail of oil that would do a Hardley
Abelson proud.  Handling was testy.
