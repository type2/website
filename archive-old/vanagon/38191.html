Subject: Rambling vanagon story

Howdy,
just sifting through all the rubbage of vanagon info..
..I won't be as wordy in the future, but I have the 
uncontrollable urge to vent my Bus Story...

I've got a 85 vanagon that's a repo resto..   ?
I mean, it's been parked a _lot_ for financial reasons
..so far as I can tell, the original 3rd owner drove
it till 'it made a noise', parked it, and it eventually 
got repo'ed. Guess they figure they got their money's 
worth.. 
	Anyways, I see this van for sale by the bank; $500 and 
a description of a 'seal problem'..I pass on it, being 
leery of such things. After later months of 
restructuring the mechanics of my Super Beetle, I felt,
&quot;Yes, someday, I'll get a van..&quot;. But that one got 
bought by, let's call him owner (a).
..months pass;  a particular tune rambled onto my radio 
just as I notice this van for sale on the side of the 
road..karma was screaming at me that day..
..anyways, took a test drive; no temp gauge (later 
fixed), and impossible shifting. Excellent negotiating 
tools :).. 
	This guy has bought it from owner a. He tells me (a) 
got a $400 tuneup by our local vw mechanic, took his
finely running machine and promptly trashed the 
transmission, provoking the resale (Not enough patience, 
I guess). Since it was on the highway and within 3 miles 
of the tuneup, I suppose it wasn't stunt driving..
 
 So guy #2, call him owner b, he gets it and finds
a transmission in Atlanta for $450. Installs it, and
puts the van in the lot where (c),me, finds it.
	The problem, which I don't know what parts were 
re-used, at least what I found was the shifter linkage
was worn out and tended to fall out of the socket.
$25 part, I ordered it and installed it (later) on the 
spot. Good planning, selling a car in a parts store lot!
I just wonder if that $25 part trashed the old 
transmission... 

So, what did I take up all your time for this?
anecdote? amusement? well, the funny thing is,
years ago.. I saw this van when it was new, hundreds of 
miles away, and while conspiring someday to own a 
vanagon, never thought it'd be the exact same one.. :)
