Subject:       vanagon A/C hose damper

Import Service, Jan '89, Vol 2, No1

&quot;1986 Vanagons up to VIN 25HH003407 had a damper/restrictor installed 
in the high side hose coming from the air compressor.  Occasionally, 
these dampers would cause compressor head pressures high enough to 
actually blow the compressor head seal.  The tube in question is 
about 17 inches long.  Make sure you remove all of it and discard it 
if you find it still in place, especially when replacing a compressor 
seal that was blown by excessive head pressure.&quot;
