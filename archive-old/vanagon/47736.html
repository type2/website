 do some thourough oil filter testing as a project.  Where I went to school
 each senior was required to complete a &quot;Senior Project&quot; in order to
graduate.
  It was kind of a mini &quot;thesis&quot;.  This would likely be a fine project for a
 mechanical engineering student.

Actually, consumer reports did this type of testing a number of years ago.
 They rated rated the Fram at being the most effecient at retaining dirt with
a very low forward pressure drop.  I personally use the Fram and have no
problems.  My Camper has over 132 K and the engines holds 15psi at idle and
45 psi at 3500 rpm.  This is with the oil at about 200F,(Yes I have a
thermostatically controlled oil cooler).  Even after taking long grades and
getting the oil up to 250F, I have no problem with the light coming on and
the VDO sensor activates at 10psi.  Take this for what it's worth.  I
ersoanlly do not trust CR but the Fram filter is a good product.  I also
belive that one should never need to use the bypass valve in the filter.
 This is only a safety in case the filter gets clogged.  If th filter is
clogged, save your money for an engine.  You will need it soon.
