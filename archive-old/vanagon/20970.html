&gt;I am glad you get the same kind of reading as me with a Single port 1600 in a
&gt;70 westy. When it gets real hit (over 90) and I am on the freeway it always
&gt;runs just over 250.
&gt;
&gt;   I'm in a '76 Westy and if the temp gets over 230, I'm lookin' for a shady
&gt;spot to rest for  a while... last year I took it down south to the beach, got
&gt;the oil light on AS I coasted into a parking space: zero oil! walked to the
&gt;market and bought several quarts. Runnin' a little hot that day, I guess... had
&gt;it brought closer to spec _at_ the mechanic, now it runs below 200 (knock wood)
&gt;and we're both happy...

I made my own gauge, and I put the upper limit at 250.  I have never had the 
opportunity to run over 200.

I think that it should be noted that it seems that T4 engines always run 
hotter than the T1's.  If my 1600 went to over 220, I'd be real concerned.  
My personal opinion is that heat comes from poorly built engines.  Bad 
line-bores and unbalanced parts don't help either.  I wonder if anyone has 
ever really tested the VDO gauge to see if it's accurate.  I sat by the 
stove and simply went 20 deg. increments and marked the scale.  I know it's 
right.
