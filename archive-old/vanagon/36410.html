&gt;Does anyone know how many (if any) of these parts are interchangable

&gt;Reasonably priced used parts are hard to come by around here for VW busses, 
&gt;and any straight across compatability would help me in my search.

&gt;From my limited experience, the fuel injection parts on your bus are common
to the '76, '77 and '78 year models = Bosch L-Jetronic with no lambda (O2 sensor).
Someone correct me if I'm wrong, please.

I presume that passing an emission test is not required where you drive.  
If that's the case, I'd stay with the Weber carburetor and not bother with 
putting all the ~rare and expensive f.i. plumbing back on your motor.

I must give you credit for attempting to make your bus as close to stock 
as you can.  Kudos.  Mine is somewhat an aberration with the newer motor.

Here are some places in Calif that will sell you those obsolete smog/fi parts:
HELP (800)544-4357
Economy (800)327-1449
Specialized Auto (800)398-4985
No affiliation with any of the above other than being a customer.
