Subject:       Re: Splittie Reduction Box Trauma

&gt; I had similiar experiences.  My solution was to disassemble it down to 
&gt; the swing tube, take it to a machine shop and have them put thread 
&gt; inserts into the soft metal inner casing of the reduction boxes.  It is a 
&gt; good idea not to use any 'screwed' up bolts when you put it all back 
&gt; together.  8-)    Good luck.

Yuck.  Well I'll tell ya, don't go looking for a 13mm tap!  Just not 
a common object.  Finally found a place that will special order one 
for me.  $25 for a one time deal is pretty steep.  (At least it isn't 
my money! =-P)  Is a 13mm the answer to my problem?  Hmmmm.

Sounds like your solution would be the better thing to do.  Richard 
is looking around for a good reduction box as we speak so that he can 
just lose his current one.
