&gt; [brake fluid leak question]
&gt; 
&gt; engineering! So, yes, the fluid was low, but there was also a leak near
&gt; the brake pedal from what I believe is the (or one of?) master brake
&gt; cylinder - the leak is small, but noticable. Is this thing the master
&gt; cylinder? If so, does a leak usually mean a replace of the cylinder or
&gt; perhaps a loose screw and/or seal?

The master cylinder is behind the instrument cluster, which is easily
removed per Bentley diagrams.  If it is leaking you should be able to 
follow the trail of brake fluid from the pedal up to the master cylinder.

The clutch master cylinder is down towards the bottom near the pedals.
The clutch system is hydraulic and shares the same brake fluid reservoir.
