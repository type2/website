Steve, on Thursday, April 04 you said:
&gt;I have been looking for a bike rack for the back hatch of a 1993
&gt;Eurovan Weekender.  The products I have seen so far either rest on the
&gt;glass window which I don't trust or attach somehow off the frame and
&gt;block the hatch from opening.  I don't want one on top because it is too
&gt;high.  I recently saw a bike rack on a Eurovan that attached to the top
&gt;and bottom of the hatch. The owner said the rack had been purchased fro
&gt;the VW dealer in Vancouver BC.  The VW dealer in Santa Barbara where I
&gt;live had never heard of it.  Does anyone have information on VW bike
&gt;racks?  Send information to Steve Mack, email address sbwater_at_rain_dot_org.
&gt;Thanks

Hi, I bought my bike rack from our local Target. It's cost is a lot
less than the $300-400 for the German rack and it doesn't press
against the glass. It cost me $40 as I remember. The rack (when
mounted) sits on the body down where it joins the bumper and uses
straps to hold the rack in place. The rack mounts and dismounts fast,
so fast that I keep it inside the van unless it is in use. Holds my
son's and my mountain bikes although I don't think I would be
comfortable trying to put a third bike on it (the package said it was
a 3 bike rack).
