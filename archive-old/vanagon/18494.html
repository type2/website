Rusty...

Your problem was actually due to bad karma...or bad vanma as the
case may be...its because you have used the word &quot;resto&quot; without
using the magic words &quot;sano&quot; or &quot;bitchin&quot; within the same
sentence of your message!!! 

You do realize that without using the magic phrases &quot;sano&quot; &quot;resto&quot;
and &quot;bitchin&quot;, you will not be able to attract any bikini bus
bimbos, and any advertisers in VW T&amp;A and DB&amp;HVW (Dumb bimbos &amp;
Hot VWs) may refuse to sell their products to you!

So Rusty, get with the program, Dude!

;-(
oops....;-)
