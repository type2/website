Eugene,

David's point is valid.  Porting and polishing is done to
optimize air flow, and works very well.  But the flow bench is
pumping air, not a mixture of air and fuel.  

If I had a Cray instead of a PC perhaps I could resolve the
matter but until then I'm forced to use empirical evidence, such
as signs of liquid gasoline at the manifold gasket flanges . . .
and the fact such evidence is missing in those manifolds I've
smoothed.

Despite Conventional Wisdom, polishing is only of benefit where
heat is involved, such as the combustion chamber and exhaust
stack.  As a youngster one of the most frustrating aspects of
trying to break the land-speed record in my '41 Ford was my
inability to reproduce the marvelous improvements claimed in many
magazine articles that would result from polishing the runners of
my three-carb manifold to a mirror-like finish.  For years I
thought I was a bad mechanic, outside the privileged circle of
super-wrenches who could get 500 horsepower from a lawnmower
engine just by polishing everything in sight.   
  

I felt better after discovering a paper by Pratt-Whitney on
wall-effects of fuel-air flow in smoothed vs cast induction
runners.  The bottom line is that no significant improvement was
found beyond surfaces smoothed with #600 grit paper/flap wheels. 
This confirms some of my experiments using epoxy coatings as a
means of achieving a glass-smooth surface inside a cast aluminum
manifold.  (Perhaps St. Muir read the same paper.)


With dual-port manifold ends it takes about an hour with a
die-grinder and flapper wheels to achieve a uniformly smooth
inner surface.  The use of clay and other tricks lets you 'see'
the match between the manifolds and the heads.  (Insuring a
smooth transition is a necessity.)  With no other mods, you'll
discover your engine idles smoother with a lower volume control
screw setting yet maintains the same rpm.  A slight drop in the
hydrocarbon count tells me the thing is burning a little cleaner.
