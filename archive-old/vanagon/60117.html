On Thu, 15 May 1997 21:42:49 -0500 you said:
&gt;1.  How do I figure the road horsepower on a vanagon.  I've got a 91'which
&gt;I'm told is lower to the ground.  I've read that for a syncro which sits
&gt;highest, its above 60 hp. at 70 mph. Can this be true?

not sure what you mean by &quot;road horsepower&quot;. the &quot;brake horsepower&quot; for the
2.1 liter engine is 92 bhp at about 4800 rpm. max torque is at 3200 rpm.

&gt;2. Stock 2.1L motors a listed as are a 9.0 :1 compression, can an increase
&gt;be made to up the umph?

there is a 2.5 liter upgrade kit available from a german company. about
$3000. :(

&gt;3. Since the road hp. is seemingly high in ratio to the available power, is
&gt;the VW pwrplant considered a high or constant duty cycle motor? Which would
&gt;explain the expensive parts in part, but its sounds like der deutchlander
&gt;is makin a Dm here and there too!

i don't think it's high duty. my fan comes on rather rarely. i think the
large volume of coolant helps keep the cycle low.

&gt;4. Is taxing the cooling system really a problem, folks in Kennedy
&gt;Engineering say the system is &quot;a massive thing that can cool a very big
&gt;engine?

again, you have a very large volume of coolant. 18 quarts. about three times
as much as most other 2.0 liter engines.

&gt;5. Is an oversize water pump pulley a route to increase coolant flow velocity?

i think it would probably cause cavitation, and just create problems.

&gt;6. I've heard that there is dissimilar metals in the motor which sets-up a
&gt;galvanic corrosion process.  Does the phosphate free stuff have an additive
&gt;that acts as the sacrificial anode? Or is this VW's secret ingredient,
&gt;which is why the stuff is exhausted every two years? Four gallons of
&gt;coolant is a lot of volume, it seems that cooling the beast is the least of
&gt;the system's deficiency, although as think, cooling a motor that's pumpin
&gt;50 plus horses, twice the road horse power of a car, to move you to your
&gt;destination at the speed limit plus 10 probably requires a massive thing to
&gt;cool it.

what i heard is that the anti-corrosion additives in the coolant wear out in
about three years. after that, the phosphates in the coolant begin to react
with any aluminum around (heads, radiator, etc.) and create a sort of acid
sludge, that can clog the radiator and dissolve the head gaskets and pit the
metal of the head. so the coolant NEEDS to be replace/renewed every two years.
every year would be better. and it's not just vw's ... toyota trucks have
the same problem (if you run them a long time without replacing the coolant).
also mercedes-benz engines with aluminum heads. MB doesn't even ASK ... you
bring the car in for 30,000 mile service, and wham! you get new coolant!
