Subject: Going back to Wolfsburg!!


I just recieved a fax and I've been invited back to Wolfsburg (with a couple 
of my students) for another one of those VIP tours of the factory and 
musueum like I did a couple of years ago!

I'll be in Germany (mainly Stuttgart, Munich and Frankfurt) from 6/6 to 6/20 
with a group of students and another professor on a grant from the German 
government....so I figured, what the hell...it's only a &quot;train ride&quot; from 
Munich to Wolfsburg (compared from getting to Wolfsburg from Massachsuetts). 
There are a couple of VW &quot;nuts&quot; in the group of students who are going with 
us, so we are all going to visit VW-halla..

I understand that the museum now is selling NOS and repro parts for vintage 
VWs, so the '56 beetle should have some new goodies when I get back.

According to my list of VW shows in Europe, there's a VW show at the Porsche 
factory on 6/8 as well!

I'll have a full report when I get back.
