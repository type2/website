To which mantis replies:
&gt;ummm wouldn't that be a &quot;'93 EV MV Winnie&quot;


Nope....the EV MV Westy is the Weekender package available in 1993
in the US and built by Westfalia....the Winnie or Winnebago
version of the EV is a 1995+ Model and is the full camper package
similar to the Westy packages of yore...The EV Weekender has
the poptop, a small fridge under one of the jump seats, a table,
sliding windows, flourescent light..
