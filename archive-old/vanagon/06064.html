&gt; Hello all, 
&gt;  
&gt; On my 70 bus, the steering is binding.  The effect is particularly noticeable  
&gt; when I am parallel parking.  This is because the bus is completely stopped  
&gt; when I am turning the steering wheel (very difficult).  When moving the  
&gt; problem is not so apparent.  Now, I have located the source of the problem   
&gt; which is the worm gear? connecting the steering wheel column to the front  
&gt; wheels and have loosened the gear according to the idiots guide.  This action  
&gt; has helped some but I fear the problem is to get worse.  According to the  
&gt; idiots guide breakdown of the gear should be left to the dealer ( aghh!) 
&gt; Does any one have any experience with this problem.  
  
 My 70 bus also has rather nasty steering. You can sort it to a certain
 extent by playing with the peg/locknut as you`ve done but if the box
 is really worn this won't do very much to help. I've stripped my box
 twice, its not a problem (the Haynes manual for instance gives the
 procedure), but unless that shows an obvious problem like worn bearings
 it will probably be down to playing with the shims at the bottom of the
 gear. This can be a real pain and unless you know what sort of gap you
 want I would leave them alone. (I didn't on the second rebuild and now
 I will have to do it again).

&gt; Is it really that bad or  
&gt; can I break it down myself on the work bench.  Is it advisable to get a used  
&gt; one or rebuilt, i understand they are rare......or is there fluid in there  
&gt; that I let get too low ?  Goodthoughts anyone 
&gt;                                                                         
&gt; TIA 
&gt;  
&gt; John 

 Certainly over here the early (68-71) boxes are very hard to find, and are
 normally just as worn as the original. I keep meaning to find out how
 much work is required to fit the later box (probably my best bet) as a
 way round the problem.

 Yes, there is fluid in there, I would check it. If your box is anything
 like mine then it will gently dribble the stuff out through the bottom
 four bolts, and over the years will probably loose quite alot!

 Good luck..

 Marcus
