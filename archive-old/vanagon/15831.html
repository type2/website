Hi everyone.  Just FYI here that Westfalia's are still available in 
Canada.  Apparently the Winnebago will be coming north as a 1996 
model.  This information is from my dealer as of yesterday.  They had 
a white one listed at $38,025 CDN in the showroom... 5 speed, a/c, 
cruise.  No ABS.

Cheer$,

Harry.
