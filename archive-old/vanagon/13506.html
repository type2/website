Subject:       Re: Ignition Wires...


&gt; If your wires are 5 years old, I'd go ahead and swap them out for new ones
&gt; (preferably with bright yellow silicone jacketing...)
&gt; Is a proven engineering principle that brightly colored spark plug wires
&gt; are good for another 7 mph in top end!   ;-)

Hi Rob.  Are there aftermarket sets made up the Vanagon specifically? 
ie. correct resistance, etc.  I can get the same make (BREMI) at the 
local FLAPS (Canadian Tire) for $73 versus $143 at the dealer.  
There appears to be so many variables 
out there... what works for some may not work for others, etc.  The 
good  ol' days were so much simpler.  I believe the Vanagon uses 
solid copper core, and would those super silicone injected neon 
yellow coloured wires work well?  Are they resistor type?

Thanks,
Harry.
