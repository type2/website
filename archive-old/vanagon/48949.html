Update on CV joints-
Both the below are for NEW CV joints with used axles.
Everyone who sells CV joints separately sells Lobro brand.
Prices vary from $55 ea to $89 ea plus about $15 for boot kit 
including bolts, washers, and boot. Everybody swears by Lobro brand.
Most listers would opt to get whole axle, packing CV's being such a pain.  
BTW would one get busted at the Canadian border for packin' a CV?

New Moog $99.99 ea per side whole axle exchange
Lifetime warranty, no bolts or washers
BTW this is from Southern Auto Parts, a national company (US anyway)

New MPR $99.75 ea per side whole axle exchange
12mo or 12K miles, no bolts or washers

2 outfits don't know what brands are used, so I didn't follow up.

If you need a whole axle they figure that you can use your old bolts 
and washers!  I'd get new ones anyway, I've had mine get loose on me 
before, what a wild noise loose CV attach bolts make!  And with some 
having torx fittings and others using hex . . . make them all the same.
