&gt;3)  This may be a stupid question:  So I changed the oil for the first time
in 
&gt;the week or so since first purchase...cleaning the strainer and I found
sizeable 
&gt;chonks/grindings of metal...is it time to start building another engine, or
am I 
&gt;just paranoid?
&gt;

Every (used) car I buy gets a complete maintenance 'going over'.  I look at
the factory maintence schedule and make the assumption there has never been a
single maintenance item performed.  Fluids are changed, filters replaced,
tune the engine.  Inspect all items on the service schedule.  May sound a bit
overkill, but lets me get to know the car &amp; it saves time later down the
road.  (Oh yeh, I kick the tires, too!)

Sooooo,  with that in mind, When you find shavings that is usually a sign of
metal friction parts wearing out.  (shims, spacers, bearings).  Basically,
its rebuild time.  There are several components that could cause this but if
it turns out to be your crankshaft, the damage could be expensive (compared
to distributer shims, for example).  I would recommend stop using the van
until either, A) you make a solid determination what the metal filings are
from, or B)you rebuild the engine.

If you truely found chunks of metal, stop using the engine now.  Something
has died and you need to find it (This may or may not mean an engine rebuild)
