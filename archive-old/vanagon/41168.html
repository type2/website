Subject:       Re: news group

&gt; &gt;There is no polling, there is no discussion.  It's Gerry's mailing list.
&gt; &gt;If someone wants to make a Newsgroup, then do it.
&gt; 
&gt; I resent the idea that this is one persons' mailing list.  If this is the
&gt; case, I'd rather not be here.  I don't want to be intruding on someone's
&gt; personal territory.


Read in a deep macho voice:

It's back... and this time with a vengence...  YES, its the sequel:

REVENGE OF THE NEWSGROUPIES PART XVII!

Feel the wrath!  Feel the power.  Feel the bits and bytes!

(End Voice)

I feel this is going to get heated.  Let's please stop it before it 
starts.

Ron, you make your newsgroup.

Gerry, please keep the list as is.

People that complain about traffic:
    a) Use mail filtering (my _simple_ solution)
    b) Get a threaded mail reader
    c) Go hang with the homeys on VW.AIRCOOLED
    d) Hook up with Ron's newsgroup
    e) UNSUB!
    
There.  Everyone has their option.  If you can't take the heat, stay 
out of the engine comparment...
