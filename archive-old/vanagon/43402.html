I have a 600W inverter installed in my Westy. It's a cheapie from Damark 
(made by Power to Go or something like that), but it's generally worked 
fine for me so far. I've used it to run my PowerBook and a reading lamp. 
The only problem I've had was when I temporarily put my computer speaker 
system in the van to see how the subwoofer sounded. The noise generated by 
the square wave output of the inverter was quite audible through the 
speakers. You have to pay major major dollars to get an inverter with a 
nice rounded sine wave output.
