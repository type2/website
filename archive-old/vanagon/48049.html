Subject: [wanted] Uncle Hippy's Chucky Bus

Dear Listies,

I got this off a local bb in N.C.  I like the bit about &quot;Uncle Chuck's Hippy
Bus,&quot;
it's got a nice ring to it.  How about Uncle Rusty's Hippy Bus??

W.


&lt;Good day All,
&lt;        I am looking for OLD VW's.  Bugs, busses, karman ghias, fastbacks,
&lt;squarebacks, things, etc.  If you know of any I will greatly apreciate
&lt;any and all tips.  Does Grandma have one behind the barn.  Did Uncle
&lt;Chuck's hippy bus get parked before he went to 'Nam?  Let me know.
&lt;
&lt;Thanks
