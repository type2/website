Subject: Re: Grendel's nose

I had a sudden inspiration  last Saturday, as I was pulling the engine out of
my friend's beautiful 66 velvet green pop top camper.  (One day I'll have a
shiny bus.)  Oh my God,  I yelled,  I know who Grendel is!  The only person
in hearing had no clue what I was talking about,  and thought I was
blitheringly incoherently as I tried to explain.

So I must apologise to Bob,  if I had realised earlier you were in Shelton,
 I would have extended invitations and spare parts.   But I didn't  know
  till I read the trek for home saga.  Well,  I live in beautiful soggy
Olympia where all the buses have rocker rot, about 20 miles  from Shelton.

   And I saw a painted up 67 in the value village parking lot this summer,
 with mashed nose,  was it colorado plates,  and a 600 dollar price tag.
  Then, some time in August,   Earl from Shelton  told me of a bus, sounded
the same,  with a bad clutch,   and the lady wanted $300 to take it off her
hands.   No, thanks,  I was going to go to Canada,  with visions of barndoors
and split window sunroof bugs dancing in my head.

      Much congratulations!!!!  Are they that hard to find in So Cal?   I'm
sorry,  but I only starting in to this Vanagon group thang recently,   since
the Grendel saga started,  so I missed the beginning.    ( If anyone kept it
and would care to send it, I'd be eternally grateful.)  

  Oh,  and my  two cents on windshield seals:   no one makes them with the
same contours as the originals.  Failing that,    i've heard bad things about
west coast metric  ( the rubber is too hard,  wrong contour).  I've done fine
with rubber from Wolfsberg West.   (rust repair panels too)  They send stuff
very quickly.   I like to glop the bottom  and bottom corners of the window
ledge with Black Jack roofing tar (mix in a little oil if its too thick)
 especially if it needed rust repair.   

Hurrah for another one!     We must save them.

Clara the crazy bus fiend
