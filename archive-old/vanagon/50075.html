Try calling Kyle Wade at the Volks Cafe ((408) 426-1432) for the muffler and 
catalytic converter, he's got good German stuff that not as $$$$ as the OEM.  
That elbow pipe that connects to them (the O2 sensor is in this) is $185 from 
the dealer so I suggest hunting down a used one.  Maybe someone on this list 
can supply the number for one of those &quot;VW dismantlers&quot; that advertise in the 
VW mags.

Subject:  '83.5 wasserboxer exhaust parts sources

Looks as if my being rearended has hastened the need for exhaust 
repair. To make a somewhat long story somewhat short, the PO installed 
a one piece welded system (I mean ONE PIECE) at some point and I now 
have to replace the catalytic converter, muffler, and appropriate pipes 
as they were damaged in the accident (thank god for uninsured motorist 
coverage!).

So, any advice at all would be appreciated. Especially parts sources, 
new vs. used, replace the whole thing, etc.

Thanks,

tony
