Subject: Re: Why there are so many cars with &quot;rebuilt&quot; engines for sale?



	My two cents on the rebuild question....I am right now shopping 
for a '71 bus which is basically a tin box with a lawn mower engine in 
the trunk. It's going to be 25 years old and there is no way the original 
engine is going to be in there. So I always ask if they have the 
paperwork (&quot;well, uh, no but THE LAST GUY  had it rebuilt--he told me 
so...&quot; yeah whatever.) So I slap a compression gauge on there and when it 
fails miserably I say &quot;See yeah!&quot; (Can you tell I'm getting REALLY 
frustrated?)
	I've looked at 7 or 8 busses in the last two months and still 
only own one VW, my golf.I am seriously thinking of flying out to 
southern CA to hang with my sister for a week in order to find a bus to 
drive back to Colorado. (CO is a bummer state to look for a bus--they 
either have been lived in for too long, neglected by a dead-head, or 
bastardized to the point where you look at the engine and can barely 
recognize it!)

	My other solution is this: I graduate from CU in ten days(!) and 
I figure a collection can be taken up on the list and/or someone out of 
the kindness of their heart will give/donate to me a '71. Hey c'mon this 
has been the best 6 years (heh heh) of my life and I have damn well 
earned this sweet graduation present! (reply to your hearts content, but 
e-mail only if your helping me to acquire that bus or donating to the bus 
fund---BTW I have the money for it so anything you give will only help 
sweeten the deal.)

P.S. Busless but damn, life is still pretty cool...Have a good one!
