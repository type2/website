 Peter,

   How does the 4 wheel drive work? Is it the same as a Vanagon,
   with a vicous setup? Can you lock or unlock the coupling? Can
   you get it with axle lock? What is the rear axle like? Is it
   independent suspension? Are they avalable with automatics?
   What is your gas milage?  

    I think I want one but can't find info on them.

                        Thanks, Eric Zeno
