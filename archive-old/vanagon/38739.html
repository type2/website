Subject: '67 Westy Resto from Hell Completed (FS)

Finished the resto last night and am negotiating with the Japanese to ship
it to Kyoto. Can't wait to get that new Geo Metro...



HONK! (Not in this life time on all accounts)
April Fools!

Real Update:
Gas tank and heater boxes painted over the weekend.  Completed the hook up
of the engine's thermostat, tested-cleaned and painted a self supporting
starter and finished the major wiring. Purchased R-21 insulation with vapor
shield on Saturday.  Will install this week. Will measure the wood headliner
panels and report to the list if anyone is interested.  Just about ready to
do/redo all of the wood. Slip sheets ( larger than 4'x8 ') of the 1/8&quot; white
birch are nonexistant at the local HomeDepot. Need to install the starter,
engine, and start plumbing the external filter and zillion pass electric fan
cooled oil cooler. Expecting tons of joy in that regard. Time to re-read a
Hoover Sermon or two.

Saw another running/ driving &quot;perfect everything&quot; '67 Westy walk-through
including &quot;what-not&quot;cabinet on the WWW for $3,800. obo.  DOH! Wonder how
much for just the &quot;what-not&quot;? ;-)  I coulda saved two years, tons o green
and had a life.   Naw, I'm sure it needed at least a valve adjust...
