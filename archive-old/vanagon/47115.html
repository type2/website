They are not imported into US. You'll have find one that an individual has 
brought in or find one in Canada and bring it in yourself. I talked to a 
man yesterday at the Vintage VW show in Seattle that had a syncro crewcab. 
He said that about 2/3 of the Vanagons in Canada have the CA emissions 
sticker in the engine compartment. If they are CA emissions approved, it's 
apparently pretty easy to bring into US. If not, it's not worth the trouble 
and money to try.
