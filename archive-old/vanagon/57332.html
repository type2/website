Subject: Vanagon needs new tires

Subject says it all -  currently runnin a set of  Michelin XCH4  LT195/75 R
14 tires that have given really good service (in excess of 60 K miles). 
Find out that these are discontinued, the replacement by Michelin is called
LTX and $90 each!.  

The Price Club offers a Uniroyal Larado AWP for $54 each, anybody had any
experioence with these?  Wet and dry traction, road noise,
handling/crosswind sensitivity, wear, etc ???

Also recommended are Bridgestone LT for $75  again same questions???

Thanks
Harvey
