Subject: drums to discs.

	Change front axle beam?
	The DFO of my truck had a complete 71 front axle, beam, etc,
which he was planning to use on the truck. Steering knuckles are probably
different, I'll look in my parts book beyond that.

	The VW drum brakes were self-energizing- that is, the forces
generated by applying the brake shoes were cleverly directed to keep the
shoes pressed against the drums. This reduces pedal effort and is
a standard feature on every drum brake I've ever worked on, at least
for fronts. 

	The disc brakes don't have this servo action and so VW installed
a vaccuum booster. If you want the stock pedal effort, Lee, you'll need
the booster + the matching master cylinder (different I believe) and
a vaccuum pipe back to the engine. 

	Let us know how it goes, and I'll check the parts diagrams tonight.
