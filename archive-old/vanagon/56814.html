Very curious, as I found neither.  The Winnebago design makes much better
use of space than at least some of the Westfalia conversions I've seen.  And
for one direct comparison, Winnebago put screens on three sides of the pop top,
whilst Westfalia did just one side (on the 93 MV), which makes no sense to me.

The EV-C design is certainly not perfect.  Many compromises must be made in
fitting a conversion to an existing body.  I think Winnebago handled the
trade-offs very well.

Just wondering.
