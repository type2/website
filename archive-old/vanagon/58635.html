&gt;      7 times and pray and and a whole bunch of other stuff.  I don't know 
&gt;      if you heard but the &quot;Jihaad&quot;, or holy pilgrimmage was held just a 
&gt;      couple of weeks ago.  2 million people go to this place every year and 
&gt;      stay in this HUGE tent city.  This year a fire killed a bunch and was 
&gt;      all over the news.
&gt;      
&gt;      Three times a day, all Muslims, regardless of where they are in the 
&gt;      world, stop bow and pray towards Mecca.  
&gt;      
&gt;      So if your customers were calling your facility Mecca, take that as a 
&gt;      big complement.  In our vernacular, mecca is loosely used to mean any 
&gt;      place that must be visited once in your life.
&gt;      
&gt;      If you already knew this, sorry for the intrusion.  Just thought you'd 
&gt;      like to know what they were talking about.
&gt;      
&gt;      Have a nice day.
&gt; 
&gt; 
Just a couple factual errors in this post.  I have to chime in as my
world religions class this semester focused a lot on Islam.  The
pilgrimage is not called &quot;Jihaad,&quot; it's called &quot;hajj.&quot;  

Muslims must pray five times a day, not three:  1) before sunrise, 2) at
noon, 3) in the afternoon before sunset, 4) in the evening after sunset,
and 5) at night before bed.

&quot;Jihad&quot; can be translated as &quot;doing your best.&quot;  The Greater Jihad is
the struggle between a Muslim and his own ego/worldliness.
