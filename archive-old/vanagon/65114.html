Subject:      An apology (was: RE: Hot VWs Artical)

Ok,

I'll be the first to admit when I screw up....and I'd like to apologize to
Ronald McDonald and the rest of the list on the flame that was directed at
Ronald. There's something about the mention of Hot VWs &amp;/or VW Trends  being
great sources of information that send me into a rant....unfortunately the
keyboard got away from me a bit. Again, sorry.

However, I will NEVER apologize for my position on VW T&amp;A and Hot VWs as
being anything but thinly disguised advertisements. VWs, whether they be
bugs, busses, Things, Golfs, Jettas, etc., are extraordinary cars. They are
well designed, long lasting, and have one thing that Japanese or American
cars lack - personality. That personality is what attracts all of us to
these cars, face it. This list is one manifestation of this attraction. The
advise that is given here, the stories told, the camaraderie, the care we
put in our VWs all show this.

Unfortunately the editors of the above mentioned rags seem to be of the
opinion that we are mindless beings who are easily swayed by flimsy
editorial content, bimbo photos, etc. I resent being treated by an editor as
some mindless oaf who is willing to shell out $4 or $5 for drivel and in
turn be thankful for the drivel. This is my main bitch at these magazines.

There are three VW publications in this world that are, IMHO, worthless...
Hot VWs, VW Trends and Chilton Manuals. It amazes me that the BEST VW
writing and information comes form some of the less commercial
sources...this list....club newsletters. I'd rather plunk down $20+/year for
a membership in GASS, LiMBO, Connecticut Volkswagen Association, etc. than
to plunk down $10/month on the commercially available rags (and from what I
see the so-called &quot;new&quot; mag - VW Customs and Classics seems to be a clone of
VW Trends, et al).

Why is it that this list and club magazines are better sources of
information on VWs than the magazines? I'll give you two reasons:

1. The folks who are on this list and put club newsletters together are
driven by one thing alone...their love for VWs

2. Revenue to the clubs is driven by the value these clubs are to their
members, not by advertising revenue.

That's all I have to say...and again, sorry for the personal flames.

Ric
