          A Great Big Bus

When I was young and in my prime
I bought me a volkswagen bus on time
I drove it far and without much fuss
And I loved the feel of a great big bus.

I drove it east, I drove it west,
I drove it long and without much rest,
I drove in day, I drove at night,
I drove it wrong, and I drove it right.

I drove the damn thing everywhere,
&gt;From way down yonder to way up there,
And every road I chose to run,
The little bus would make it fun.

But people age and pressures grow,
We must conform ... it's best, you know.
We must fit in at home and work
And look like every other jerk.

And so we buy a LARB, you see,               &lt;Large American Road Barge&gt;
To carry us and family
Conformedly to work and school,
To PTA and swimming pool.

But now the kids are gone from home
And I am left the world to roam.
Conformity no longer feels
Like something I should do on wheels.

So, now i'm old and in my prime
I've got me a volkwagen bus this time.
I drive it far and without much fuss
And I love the feel of a great big bus.
