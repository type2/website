Subject: Re: New Top Seal - ' 71 Bus

&gt;Has anyone had any experience replacing the top camper seal on  a 1971 Bus?
&gt;I just received the after market seal from Bus Boys (not a bad price either
&gt;- $69) for my Westy, and as soon as it stops raining, I plan to approach
&gt;this job in the proper Zen-like manner.  Ha!
&gt;
&gt;(BTW, If anyone knows what the proper Zen-Like manner is, please let me know.)

I did mine on an 83 Westy a few years ago, and it invoved a lot of baby
powder, a careful attempt at not stretching the rubber too much (but you
will have to pull it a bit) and finally a few dabs of black RTV to fill in
a few gaps and cracks. Have fun, and figure on working a few hours to get
it even.
