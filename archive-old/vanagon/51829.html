Subject: Coolant sensor--thanks!!

THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!!!

Great thanks to all of you that offered such detailed instructions to
this novice regarding the coolant temp sensor for FI.  Thanks to your
information, I found the little bugger and successfully swapped it out
for the new one.  Must have had my vanagon at just the right angle too. 
(Sarcasm here)  Must have been a good two gallons of coolant that came
rushing out!  Didn't have to worry about local pets n such though, I had
some environmentally friendly/non-phosphate stuff that won't kill the
kritters in my system.  Anyway, refilled it and bled the air out.  Will
maneuver in my driveway quite well.

Will keep you posted on the second problem (lack of power after driving
extended period).  Can't test it to see if sensor helped until Monday. 
Thanks for the info Joel on technical bulletin, but I already knew about
it and had it installed.  That harness was the 'magic sensor harness'
that I was referring to in my original post.

The old sensor was original (based on what appears to be a date stamp on
the side &quot;3-86&quot;).  And boy did it look ugly--all rust color instead of
shiny silver color.

Thanks again for your words of wisdom!
