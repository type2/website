Subject: EV Stays...Minor Mid-life Crisis Averted

Ok, I admit I was stupid even thinking of selling the EV...and even stupider 
posting it here, but I was at least a source of entertainment for those who 
replied to my posting on Friday night...so it wasn't all a total loss!  ;-)


Here's the story. 10 days ago, my wife's 944 got T-boned. Thursday I had the 
adjuster look at it...he said it was totaled. Now for those of you who are 
long-time &quot;vanagon&quot; list-types, the 944 replaced the 1979 Beetle 
Convertible, which incidentally was also cut down in the prime of its life 
around this time last year. 

Back to the 944. Visually, it doesn't look like much damage...the passenger 
door is trashed, the rear quarter panel ditto, and the front fender is 
kinked. Its fixable...but as the adjuster said..&quot;parts are going to be too 
expensive for a 1984 car&quot;....

We had figured that the 944 would last us until the Concept 1 came to 
market. Well, that was not to be. So Thursday night we discussed the 
purchase of a replacement. We made a list of cars to be considered. The cars 
had to be unique, interesting, fun to drive, German, carry at least 2 
comfortably and 4 in a pinch at minimum.

Cars made the list if they met 3 out of the 5 qualifications. On the list 
were:		used Audi 90C
		Golf Cabriolet
		Mazda Miata
		Subaru Imprezza
		Plymouth Neon (over my strongest objections)
		Jeep Wrangler (ditto)
		Passat

The plan was made...I would do a quick once over on the cars on the 
list Friday afternoon...and on Saturday my wife and I would then go 
shopping..she would drive each of the cars and we would make a decision 
together.

In theory, it sounded like a good plan. Off I went on Friday..drove the Audi 
90...nice...a bit mushy on the suspension side. Next the Subaru dealer. Now 
mind you I've rarely set foot into a dealership which sold the products of 
the rising sun...let alone considered buying one. My list of potential cars 
has always been very simple...VW/Audi/BMW/Mercedes period.

The unwritten standard in our plan was the car was to cost under $18k. So 
for Subaru that meant Imprezza. The salesguy brought me to the lot to see a 
four-door AWD sedan...BORING. But next to it was a red wagon. Upon closer 
look it was an Imprezza Outback wagon...the sibling to the Legacy Outback 
wagon that is on those Crockodile (or is it Crock o'$hit) Dundee 
commercials.

I read the sticker....ABS, 4WD, Air Bags, four wheel steering, sport 
suspension, etc...etc..  I figured what the hell..lets take this one for a 
spin. The salesguy was a bit hesitant...it came off the truck the day before 
and hadn't been prepped. I replied...its this or I'm out of here.

The plate went on, and off we went. After turning the salesguy three 
different shades of green while I test drove it...I have to see where the 
handling limits are...I came back convinced....I can give up further 
shopping..and meet the guys for a Friday afternoon beer! Life is good. Over 
a beer I could also rationalize why I'm buying a Japa...Japan...Japanese 
car.

So I call my truly understanding wife. I explain what I've done. She 
responds that she's had a change of heart...she doesn't want any of the cars 
on the list....she wants a used shitbox or a Hyundai...she wants to spend a 
minimum amount of money.


AAAARRRRRRGGGGGGGGGG!!!!!!


Then it set in. I HAVE to HAVE this car!!!! What can I do to get this car. 
Hmmmmm...I could have her killed. Nope, I'll get caught, and NEVER be able 
to buy the car. Hmmmmmm....the EV is worth about 16 to 18K...I got the 
salesguy to drop the price from 18K to 16k...maybe I could arrange an even 
trade. NO...I could send the EV to a good home to some one on the 
list...this way my mind would be at ease, and I wouldn't have to deal with 
the anguish of buying a Japanese car for the first time, and the guilt of 
dumping the EV. Its a(nother) plan!

So I fired off my posting to the list. My wife came home that night and I 
explained my new plan. She was not pleased. I couldn't understand why...she 
could buy a $hitbox, and I'd get the Outback. What's wrong with that???

Saturday morning arived, and she had a change of heart. The EV stays...we'll 
go looking for a new car. We drove the Subaru first...then most of the cars 
on the list. At the end she said, she loved the Subaru at &quot;first drive&quot;, but 
didn't say anything...she wanted to &quot;torture&quot; me by going to look at other 
cars.

So we bought the Subaru...we're keeping the EV!

How did the EV think about my dis-loyalty? Well, I got paid back. As we were 
heading home late Saturday aftenoon after putting a deposit on the 
Subaru...one of the brake pads decided to retire... So as they say &quot;payback 
is a bitch&quot;, or in the case of the EV...&quot;payback is a scored disk rotor&quot;!


Back to my &quot;normal&quot; level of (in)sanity,

Ric
