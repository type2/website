&gt; also has the green knob (gas, er i mean diesel heater)!!!!!!!!!!

Ahh yes, I am also the benefactor of a very pretty green knob...
Don't we *all* wish we had one? Of course, the dirty little secret
that Mr. Smith and I share is that our aux-heaters no longer work :-(

Quickly changing subjects:

My wife made it &quot;there and back again&quot; yesterday (250 miles roundtrip).
The Vanagon was the hit of the convoy. People were jockeying for 
a seat in NuBus, even though there were two new Caravans in the convoy.

Now, how many *other* 12 year old vehicles (diesel at that) would 
be preferred over brand new minivans?

The other day, I was driving in my community and I passed a few
teenagers walking along the road. As I passed, one of girls yelled
&quot;I like your car!&quot;. So, how many times has *that* happened to people
in Minivans?
