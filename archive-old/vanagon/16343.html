Subject: Re; German Wants To Join!

Jerry Dunham &lt;dunham_at_devnull.mpd.tandem_dot_com&gt; sagt:

&gt; What's the big deal about getting (or not getting) Germans on this list?
&gt; The Atari groups I frequent have nearly as many Germans on them as
&gt; Americans, and that's an American product, fer cryin' out loud.  I'd
&gt; think a list devoted to a German product would find Germans dominating.
&gt; Where are they all hiding?

Jerry, mein Freund, weiszt du nicht that for us, Germans must be der 
Uberleute?  As important as, say, the French to folks in alt.fan.jerry-lewis?

And not to minimize the contributions of those Volk (und Halbvolk, Sami)
now dwelling 'mongst us speakers of a diminished and mongrelized version
of der Vatersprech, but a real, live, Deutschlander _in_ Deutschland --
should he be able to make himself understood :-) -- could be a handy
addition, especially if we can get him to trot over to Wolfsburg and get
us some free brochures or something from the museum. 

Wilkommen!
Josef
