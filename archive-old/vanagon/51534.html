Subject: 1980 air cooled engines

 I recently purchased a 1980 westy and now it needs a motor job. Ever since
I bought it I've only had problems. First an oil leak. Next (after I had a
seal job done) the motor blew oil everywhere and &quot;BANG!&quot; that was it. There
is little compression and it needs new sleeves and pistons. My mechanic
said it would be quite expensive to rebuild and that volkzwagon 2 litre air
cooled engines are not easy to come by in Nova Scotia, Canada. How much
would a new engine cost? Can anyone out there help me find one? Or at least
a half decent rebuilt one. I don't want to sell it but at this rate yet,  I
don't believe I have much of a choice.
                                        Help!, Shawna
