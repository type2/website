Subject: Diesel Vanagon questions
From: chawk_at_juno_dot_com (j g shepard)

I'm going to look at an 82 diesel this weekend. It has a new engine and
the trans is stuck in 4th gear. Is anyone willing to take a guess what
the problem is? The guy wants $800 for it. It sounds worth it. Should I
go for it?
