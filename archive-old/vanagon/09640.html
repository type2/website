Subject: Re: Heater Fan Needs Home...

I have an extra such (squirrel cage) heater fan for sale to the highest
bidder. I used it to beef up my 72 bus' heating system. I installed it the
way the other poseter mentioned as being up front to help speed the hot air
up to the vents. Now I have water pumper van so fan is up for sale.
