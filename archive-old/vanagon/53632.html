Subject: VW SA redesigned Bus www site


VW of South Africa redesigned their web pages. They
offers the *new* VW Kombi with the known Vanagon
body. The VW SA site is nice to see and needs a lot
of time to load. Gamblers and Vanagoneers not working
on their cars should try

http://www.vw.co.za/vw_dec/html/bushome.html

For playing the game you should know a lot of South
African sights. I tried it but I only could answer the
VW related questions.
