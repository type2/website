&gt;And with the engine stopped and the bus sitting still, yes you *can*
&gt;move the shift lever from gear to gear without pressing down the
&gt;clutch pedal. So can all the rest of us, in our buses.
&gt;
&gt;Tell me again why you believe there's something wrong with your bus?
&gt;

OK, OK, Call me a fool, but before I had this little adventure today I
had to press the clutch pedal down to switch gears *even* with the
engine off.  So I figured this was the norm, and since it was
different than before, I figured I broke something while fixing my
problem (since breaking one thing while fixing another seems to be the
norm for me:).

Oh well, one day I'll have a clue, and until then maybe you all will
continue pointing out the errors of my ways.  Until then I'm getting a
little closer each day.  Thanks for the advice and all else.

take care all,
	brandy
