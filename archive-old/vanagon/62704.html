This is one of those questions that I could as easily put to my therapist,
if I had one, the car guys, if I could ever get an open line, or you lucky
stalwarts of the Vanagon list!

here goes, it's auto-psycho-sociological: opinons please!?

       I have a reasonably good relationship with the dealership service
department where I purchased my Vanagon new, six years ago.  I know, that's
mostly because I mostly, quietly allow them to fleece me about once every
six months.

        Lately, every time I have some little thing done, they leave some
part of the job undone!  This last trip was worse! I had the front brakes
done and drove the 100+ miles home only to discover that my chrome lugs had
been switched for black ones! chrome on the back, dingy black on the front.
There were no other Vanagons in the shop that day so I thinking the swap
was intentional, and I'm really steamed.  Never the less I call the service
manager whom I think of as a friend, and suggest that a mistake has been
made.  He gets a little huffy and sez it could not happen, no other vans in
the shop that day and Vanagon lugs are unique to Vanagons, must have been
that way when I brought it in. I know that's not the case.  I washed the
van two days before: chrome all around.  Now I'm not only angry I'm
worried!  What if these are not the correct lugs and they were just forced
in?  I might be in danger of them breaking or coming out because they are
stripped.  Will I have to buy new hubs?  in the face of the service
manager's denial do I force the issue over eight lug bolts or just order
new ones for one of the suppliers on the list and then find a new
mechanic??

thanks for any advise any of you can offer.
