Subject: RE: Synchro


&gt;I am looking to move up from an air cooled westy to a synchro. If anyone
&gt;knows of one for sale near the SF bay area please let me know.


These are available, but quite rare I understand. Syncros that were
ordered with the optional &quot;h&quot; in the name, were special-order vehicles
that took a minimum of 10 weeks to arrive from the factory. They had
a large increase in price with no discernable improvement in performance,
safety, interior room, or appearance. As a result, few were ever ordered
with this option, and are very hard to find as used vehicles.

Syncros without the &quot;h&quot;, though, are relatively plentiful. And this list
is an excellent place to start loking for one!

     :^)
