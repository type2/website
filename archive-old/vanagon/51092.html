&gt;Thom,
&gt;
&gt;	I am in a very wonderful situation.  I am purchasing my fisrt
&gt;vehicle after college graduation adn have narrowed the choices down to a
&gt;synchro Bus a synchro bus and another synchro bus, the only problem is I
&gt;have had a terrible time trying to find any for sale.  Eventhough I live
&gt;in MD I will fly anywhere to get this dream machine.  Do you have any
&gt;suggestions???!!!
&gt;
&gt;	Please let me know...
&gt;
&gt;	Warmest,
