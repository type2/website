Yep... now that I've done it, and called parts places here.  Call:

Paul Walser Volkswagen
Phoenix, Az 85016
800-876-5199
fax: 602-265-8768
20%-over-cost. be SURE to mention this, and your Internet connection! 
vw parts, ask for Bill

I think there are two versions, one for unleaded (cost me $36) and one 
not for unleaded (I think $15).  I'm in California... so I have to have 
the &quot;duckbill&quot; one that only allows unleaded fillers to be used.  And 
only about 30% of them fit all the way in... it sucks.  
FYI, the local VW dealer wanted $56, paid in advance to order the part.
