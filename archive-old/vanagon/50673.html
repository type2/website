&gt;&gt;I hate that too.  I remember one time I was behind this culo-hole driving
&gt;&gt;an 84 brown and tan aircooled.  I waved at him from behind and he, for
&gt;&gt;the duration of the trip home, stuck his middle finger at me.  I wanted
&gt;&gt;to kick his culo and slap him a few times ( being from the South Bronx,
&gt;&gt;slapping another guy is the most disrespectful thing you can do to
&gt;&gt;someone), but he looked like a miserable slob.  Maybe his life is taking
&gt;&gt;care of him for me.  Upstate NY people!


Heyyyyy!
      Watch it with the &quot;upstate NY people&quot; generalization. 80 per cent of the 
buses I wave to (I live in the Catskills)wave back; vanagons, loafs or splits.
I do get the middle digit from some following my diesel brick;but they usually back off when I floor it and smoke 'em.
