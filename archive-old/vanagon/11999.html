&gt;2.  Machine heads down (The heads are factory, so I'm sure there is a crack 
&gt;starting somewhere between the        valves, the increased compression 
&gt;would only make it worse, so that's out)
&gt;
&gt;3.  Clean out the pits, seal them with &quot;Black&quot; silicone, then replace the 
&gt;heads (DING!)
&gt;

Have you considered taking the worst head to a good reputable machine shop 
that specializes in aluminium alloy work, and get the pits built up by 
welding, then resurfaced (milled) to give a flat deck. They could Zyglo 
(crack check) the heads for hidden stuff also. The machine shop would likely 
not be automotive type, rather a fabrication type place. They don't have 
fixed concepts about repairing vs. discarding components, they do what you 
ask, and you pay what they ask! Could be $$$, I just don't trust silicone as 
a structural material. Will your mechanic stick by the repair, or is he 
going to hose you with &quot;well I guess that didn't work..... now pay me 
(again) to really fix it&quot;? What's the hourly on this job BTW, $1000 is big 
bucks to me, about half of $2350 for a new long block from VWoA. A previous 
poster had done this route and advertised his old core with NEW heads 
available to anyone for the $600 that VWoA was going to credit him.    tim s.
