In a message dated 95-07-19 11:54:20 EDT, you write:

&gt;For type IV engines and air-cooled vanagons, VDO sells an adapter plate
&gt;for the &quot;oil drain&quot; plug. Part # 240 827, listed at $33. This is not the
&gt;part BusBoy Jim referred to in an earlier post; I saw the part he referred
&gt;to as being only for all *other* air-cooled engines (bug, pre-71 bus, type
&gt;3). (Jim, correct me if I'm wrong.)

Sami - 

The piece I'm referring to is our replacement for the VDO discontinued
240827.  Our # for it is 240827B and is for the Type 4 based motor, not the
1600.  We get 19.95 for it or you can drill your own, if you've got the
proper drill bit.
