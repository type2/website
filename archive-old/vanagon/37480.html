&gt;It doesn't stop.  Three weeks ago, new heads and then the new 
&gt;muffler and now a roar that I'm told is a wheel bearing. Now the 
&gt;question: 86 synchro, how is the best way to find out which wheel 
&gt;has the bad bearing? Can't seem to locate where the noise is coming 
&gt;from.  Sherwin

Put van on lift,  Let all four wheels run under power and use stethoscope
against housing to locate noisy bearing.  This should find it with out taking
things a part.
