Subject: temp sender position


I just picked up an external temperature sender from bugpack.  you know, 
one of those nine dollar jobs that attach to the #3 cyl. tin shroud 
screw.  Is it o.k. to attach the sender on top of the tin, or is it 
necessary to remove the tin and attach the sender directly on the head?
