Todd sez:

&gt; FWIW -- I might think an outing in the Gold Country would attract
&gt; non-SFO bay residents.  That would seem to be a summer activity,
&gt; however.  I can think of a couple of good spots in Arizona, but
&gt; that would preclude the California people (especially since
&gt; the spots I am thinking of are in the Central and Southeast AZ
&gt; areas).

Good idea for me! (I'm in Tucson)  I'll bet we wouldn't get very many people
though.  I know some good, free, places to camp near Zion National Park,
specifically, in the Coral Pink Sand Dunes State Park (UT).  This would still
be quite a drive for most of the Cal. people though (a good 100 miles
past Lost Wages NV).

&gt; Can one of you database phreaks come up with the central spot
&gt; on list, weighted for number of people and and average
&gt; cruising speed of Micros, Busses, Wasserboxers, Diesels, &amp;c...?
&gt; 
&gt; That would probably end up being somewhere just east of Muddy
&gt; Gap, Wyoming! ;-&gt;

And probably too far from *anybody*!

Well, we've got four people in AZ now, maybe we could have our own little
get together??
