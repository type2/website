Subject: valve adj,vent window

I've got a 2.0 in my '73 with hydraulic lifters and cam.  I seem to hear 
lifter clatter when it runs, but Muir's book just says that they '78/'79 
type IIs with hydraulic lifters aren't adjustable.  Is there any adjustment 
possible?  How are they adjusted, i.e. what clearances?

Also, the vent window on the rear left side won't stay open.  I know that 
the front vent windows have a friction adjustment - do the rears?  Since it 
is a camper, there is the wood panel side trim - does this need to be 
removed (along with the bed, overhead, sink, table, seats, etc. to get to 
this adjustment?

TIA,
