Subject: Type IV Overhaul: Status Report


To All:

Aaron the Air-Cooled Engineer from Florida has hit the road with his recently
acquired bus and the engine he overhauled on a hurry-up basis, the object
being a lazy tour of the country with a pair of his college chums to
celebrate their graduation.

Aaron called me from Flagstaff, Arizona Thursday evening.  Despite 100+
weather crossing the Staked Plains, there has been no problems with the
engine.  We discussed tuning and shifting points.  It was obvious Aaron was
driving with his head instead of his foot, which bodes well for the success
of the trip. 

The bus has now accumulated about 3,000 miles since the overhaul and managed
to rack-up 26mpg cruzing at 50mph to keep the oil temp below the red-line
during the hot weather.   He's running a Weber progressive on a 1700 engine
so he might be able to do a little better than 26 once the engine is fully
broken in.   We also discussed oil, tires and suspension but it seems
everything is working out pretty well for the trio, who are meandering toward
a wooly weekend in Tijuana, via the Grand Canyon and Las Vegas.

-Bob
