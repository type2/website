Subject: &quot;Fow Vay&quot;

Somebody asked privately...

&quot;Fow Vay&quot; is how a German pronounces VW.  But that would be its
spelling in English.  In German, I believe, if you spelled out the
letters, it would be &quot;Vau Wee&quot;, or maybe it's &quot;Vau We&quot;,but, understand,
still pronounced &quot;Fow Vay&quot;.  (Classier than &quot;vee dub&quot;, nicht wahr?)
