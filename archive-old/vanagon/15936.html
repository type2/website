Subject: Re:Tach was The Berg and springs

&gt;I have often wondered about the purpose of putting a tach in a Vanagon-
&gt;putting one in the KG was hard enough since the top end is rarely above
&gt;4500 - though it does provide a sporty look. A tach is very useful for
&gt;setting the idle. 
&gt;
&gt;I am wondering if the length of wire running from
&gt;front to back creates significant resistance and if so does this disrupt the
&gt;ignition system? DC

I don't think that there will be any significant loading effects on the 
ignition.  The impedance of the tach is very large, and will look like it 
isn't there at all.

I am in the process of putting a Sun tach in my 71.  It will fit in the 
clock space with no major modifications.  I just have to make a bracket to 
hold it there.

While we are at the topic of gauges, has anyone installed a oil pressure 
gauge with the 1/8&quot; plastic hose type sender?  I was wondering if it is 
worth doing, with the long run.  

The other question is : is the oil pressure sender hole on the VW case 
tapped 1/8&quot; npt?  Are we talking something strange?  I know that there are T 
adapter out there, but I was wondering if I could go to my local hardware 
store for one.

Thanks all.
