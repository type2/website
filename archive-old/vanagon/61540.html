Subject: Speaking of jacks . . .

     I still don't have an owner's manual. . .
     
     Where should the jack be stashed on a '91 Westfalia?  (FWIW I won't be 
     surprised to find that I don't have one.)
     
     I did find some other literature that I'd be willing to trade for a 
     Vanagon/Westfalia dealer brochure from '91.
     
          1982 Vanagon and Vanagon Camper - 16 pages
          
          Early eighties brochure for ASI camper conversions.
          
          1984 Wolfsberg Limited Edition brochure (covers all models)
          
          1984 Vanagon brochure
