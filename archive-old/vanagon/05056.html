Subject: Coolant Change
Date: Thu, 6 Oct 94 8:10:49 EDT

 I'd like to change the coolant in my 86 Synchro this weekend.

I've saved previous messages from the list posted by Joel in which he
recounts James Lu's techniques using a flush tee. I've also reviewed
Tim Smith's techniques using a plastic tube from the radiator into a
two liter coke bottle to remove air bubbles. (What diameter tube do I
use for this?)

I'm not really interested in putting in a flush tee. So I was
wondering if anyone had any further tips, comments, or gotchas about
draining the coolant using the steps outlined in Bentley.

Also, when the coolant is drained, do you just let it drain onto your
driveway and into the environment?

I know about using phosphate free antifreeze which I am picking up
this morning.

Since winter is coming here in the Northern Hemisphere, this topic
should help not only myself, but also anyone else interested in
changing their coolant.
