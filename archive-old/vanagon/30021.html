Subject: RE: Gas Heaters

Help:

This morning it was -37 and predicted to get colder.  I have a BN-4 gas 
heater installed in one of the '84 Vanagons.  Last winter I sent the fuel 
pump for the heater to JB's Heater Service to have it rebuilt.  The 
heater only worked twice since then.  This morning I checked out the 
heater and it was receiving no fuel.  Removed the fuel pump and it no 
longer pulsates, just clicks once - therefore no fuel is being delivered to 
the gas heater.

Does any one have any suggestions on what fuel pump can be used to 
replace the original pump (P/N 311 261 467C).  I'm not too excited about 
sending it out for rebuilding again, and I understand a new one is 
several hundred.  As it was, I think JB charged over $100 to &quot;fix&quot; this one.

Thanks for your assistance.
