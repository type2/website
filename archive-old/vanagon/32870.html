Subject: re: Re: Oil Warning Lamp (Was: CB Radio Oil...)

Hey... my '85 did this for the first time ever last week after about a 
week of no driving. It slowly dimmed out on my trip to work (~25 min). Has 
not happened since. Not sure if it had rained or not. I live in the N.W. 
It all kind of blurs together after awhile.
