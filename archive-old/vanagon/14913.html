I just got a EV MV last fall.  I LOVE air cooled buses having grown up on 
them but this is a fantastic vehicle.  I looked at the Fords, Chryslers, 
even Japanese and nothing compared to my tastes.  The $17k does sound a 
little high.  I paid closer to the $19k for a brand new leftover '93.  
The price could be reasonable though if the EV MV has all the goodies I 
didn't get.   Cooler seat and CD changer for example.

I'm not qualified to comment on the Synchro.  I hope to get a Cyncrho 
Westy myself sometime though.
