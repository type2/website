&gt;&gt;The install of this 2.0 engine was a work of art!  A Air-box instead of 
&gt;early
&gt;&gt;injection as we usually use.
&gt;
&gt;Would be nice to find a picture of this one day on the web. What is the 
&gt;'Air-box'?
&gt;What is the 'early injection', CIS?
&gt;
&gt;&gt; The tech told me that it was hard to get it slowed down!  He said it 
&gt;totally
&gt;&gt;overpowered the braking system .
&gt;
&gt;The tech should know about the 4-disk brake system.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;  I will be informed as soon as the &quot;KITS&quot; are ready to be sold.  I WILL 
&gt;inform
&gt;&gt;everyone on the list as soon as I get the word.
&gt;
&gt;Will be nice, we're waiting for more info.

Why Why Why is a 2.0 liter inline engine stronger than the 2.1 boxer that
the bus comes with???

PS - Kyle; I got my air filters today.  Thanks, &amp; you might want to tell the
rest of the list that these filters fit 'regular' Vanagons in addition to
Syncros (looks to me like the filter area is about doubled!!!).
