Subject: 74 Westie-Auxiliary Power Wirng diagram needed
Date: Wed, 29 May 96 09:53:00 DST


Can someone provide me with an electrical diagram for the second battery, 
relay, charger and fridge? The owners manual has nothing and the local 
dealers microfiche has a nice perspective picture of all the components and 
their locations but no connection info. When I connect 110v there is power 
at the charger, the sink pump works, the fridge gets cold (on 110v) but 
there is no voltage at the battery terminals. Also the charger negative 
doesnt appear to be connected to vehicle ground.
