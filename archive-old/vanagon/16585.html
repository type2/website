&gt;I would drain it after the trip and check for metal, but have been told
&gt;that it's a real pain to get new fluid back in the unit, that you have to
&gt;&quot;pump it in&quot;.

It has helped mine.  I think I might even do it again.

My FLAIRS did it for me for $15, I think, a good deal considering everything.

Of course he already recognizes me as a steady source of income.
