Mick,
I aclle

xxx (can't get back to correct that...)

I called a store here in Tucson (a chain) called Checker Auto Parts and
they had the system as of last year (although I only needed the cat
and the muffler). If there's a Checker Auto Parts in your part of the
country, try them. If not, try other chains like Pep Boys, Auto Zone,
etc. They might have it, too. (BTW, I have an '82 Westy).
