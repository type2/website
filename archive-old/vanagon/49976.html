Subject: Re: Westy safety / car talk

I have to give the car talk pair credit for being 
'equal opportunity offenders'...  They enjoy putting down just about
every manufacturer.  They do have an especially big bone to pick
with VWs, but they are quite a lot of fun to listen to.  About taking
their technical expertise seriously, forget it.

We talk about quarts of oil/coolant per 1,000 miles, they talk of
'dozens of eggs in the radiator per 1,000 miles'   :-)

i've never heard the Car Talk show, but from what people have told me that
they've said, i don't think i would believe ANYTHING they said about
Volkswagens or any other &quot;foreign&quot; car. it seems (to me) they have some sort
of personal hatred for anything other than GM, Ford, or Chrysler.

i don't suppose one of their sponsors would be Consumer Reports, would it??
