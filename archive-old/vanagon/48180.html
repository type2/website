Subject: Going on 'Vanacation'

Hi Volks,
  I just wanted to let everyone know that I will be signing off the lists
for a while.  I'm going on 'Vanacation', camping for a week in my Vanagon.
Great word hey!  If anyone needs to get in touch with someone at LiMBO
during the next week or so Call Dale Ward (508) 842-2121.  If not just
e-mail me and I'll get back to you.   BTW, if anyone is going to the
Vacationland VW Assoc. car show in Auburn Maine, stop by the DJ booth, that
will be me.   Take care.

                        Keep on Busin' -Jim
