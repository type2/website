Subject: Re: Tach in VW Bus (was The Berg and springs)


I just put an $18.95 JC Whitney special tach to the left of the steering
column in my '71 bus. Four wires (one really long): +12V, Ground, light,
and cold side of the coil. Cut an old 2x4 hanger (a thin galv steel plate
from the local hardware store) to mount it to the big bolt to the left
of the steering column where it comes past the dash, worked first time.

I have to look down a long ways to see it, so it's not perfect. But it
was quick, cheap, and easy, and actually looks quite nice. And yes, 50 in
third is about 4200 rpm and a LOT of noise. same with 70 in fourth. For
those of you who think 45 is too LOW a speed to downshift into third on
a hill, and prefer to do 60+ up that hill in 3rd: Either you have one hell
of a race-built engine, or you will be needing one soon. I wish you luck!
