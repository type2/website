  I don't think you can get an EV anyway, with any engine. The last I heard
  was that the only EV for sale is the Eurobago and that is only available
  from a subset &lt;100 nationwide&gt; of VW dealers. The lot at my neighborhood
  VW dealer supports this info. - there isn't a single Eurovan on it.

&gt; Sorry, got some bad info in previous post.  The TDI will be offered in 
&gt; the PASSAT (not VAN) and the golf/jetta.  I presume, though, that the 
&gt; Passat gets the 2.4L.  Damn shame that the EV won't get one, here in the 
&gt; USA, anyway.
