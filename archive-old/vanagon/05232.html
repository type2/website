&gt; Regarding Matt Rathke's dead odometer on his '73 Bus:

...

&gt; So, can I buy one?  Nope.  &quot;It would be a violation of the federal
&gt; odometer-tampering laws for me to sell you one, you obvious criminal type,
&gt; but _I_ can rebuild your odometer for you.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; So, he rebuilt it, for about $60 in 1988 dollars.  And it has worked
&gt; happily ever after.

Let me know if this comes up again.  I've bought those gears from a local
speedo shop for about $5.  I'd be glad to pick up some more.
