&gt; &gt;   Thom...why don't you order a Gene Berg dip stick thermo.?  They are cheap,
&gt;     very accurate and connect to your oil light.._dot_causing it to flicker when
&gt;     the temp. starts to get high (225-227 degrees).  The part # is GB227a-228
&gt;     depending on year of bus.  Gene Berg is at (714) 998-7500
&gt; 
WARNING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
before you put your engine's life into the hands of one of those, check
it CAREFULLY first.
A friend of mine who works on cars bought 5 of those. Just for kicks, he
tested them out, in a pot of cooking oil on the stove.
Using a highly accurate scientific thermometer, he found only 1 to be
accurate. 1 came on about 15 degrees too low, and the other THREE came
on about 10 degrees AFTER your engine has been damaged.
Soooooooooo, be very careful about trusting your car to one of those.
YMMV
IMHO
