If I had $30,000 to spend...Hmmmm.....

I'd buy a barndoor bus, preferably a 53 or so. Then I'd buy a wrecked
synchro and a wrecked Porsche 930.

With an airchisel, I'd cut the body of the barndoor off of its chassis. I'd
do the same thing to the body of the synchro, just leaving the ladder
frame.

Next I'd take the engine out of the 930 and replace the synchro's
engine. After that I'd drop the body of the barn door onto the
synchro's ladder frame and weld the sucker up!!

That night I'd go into town and steel those chrom 13 x 7&quot; rims with
the 50 series tires I saw on that lowered Toyota Corolla with the
powerful stereo, and primo-primer paint job and the ball fringe on
the windows. I'd re-drill the synchro drums/disks to fit the
13 inch wheels.

After that I'd spend the rest of the money on a bitchin' stereo,
and shag carpeting which I'd put on EVERYTHING inside (sorry
Martha, no flannel). With the remaining $50 I had, I'd go to
the auto parts store and get 10 cans of spraypaint and put
down a sano-coat of paint.

As a final touch, I'd dump my wife, and find a 18 year old (to
avoid statutory rape laws) Blonde, Big Breasted, Bikini Bus
Bimbo. 

Of course after doing all that, my bus would be guaranteed to
make it to the cover of VW T&amp;A...oops Trends!  ;-)
