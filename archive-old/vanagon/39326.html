Subject: Re:rack, or pads

Hey!  I'm just the typical lurker, and I need your help... I want to buy a
canoe (wt 58lbs.) and carry with me on 89 Westy.  Any advice on using a rack
to tote, or just using canoe foam pads, and gutter clips?  The last thing I
want to do is ruin pop-top,  and the first thing is not losing canoe on the
freeway! Help!  reply to Ron Katz, e-mail direct Goodfolk1_at_aol_dot_com
         ... thanks..ron
