&gt; 1) What is a reasonable price for buying such a vehicle from a yard? This is
&gt; separate from whether the guy'll actually sell it. I know that in WI there is
&gt; a title transfer option for junked vehicles.

Here in California, I have asked about this several times, and have always
been told that once a vehicle has been &quot;salvaged&quot;, there is no legal way of
ever registering it again.  Such a shame, too, because there are so many
rust free vehicles that end up in the junkyard because their owner abandoned
them or something was wrong with the engine.  *sigh*
