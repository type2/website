Subject: need advice re: rebuilding 84 Vanagon engine

     My winter project is to rebuild a 1984 Vanagon engine to 2.1L specs and
put it into a 1985 Vanagon.  I have rebuilt air colled VWs but not
wasserboxers.  

     Where do I get a copy of the Bentley Manual everyone is talking about?

     Does anyone know anything about sandblasting the heads using plastic
pellets instead of sand, and then coating the heads with enamel top keep down
the electrolysis corrosion that occurs between the block and the heads?

     Do I need any special tools to take the engine apart and put it back
together?  I heard someone say that a special tool is needed to get the
pistons out but I don't see how that would be necessary if you are going to
split the block.  Am I right?

    I will have other questions later, but these are my initial ones.  Thanks
for any help.
