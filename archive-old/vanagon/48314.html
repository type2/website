Subject: FS:  Complete '85 Westy Camper Interior

For Sale:  Complete Camper Interior from an '85 Pop-Top 
Westfalia Vanagon GL.
	- Sofabed and rear mattress (tan)
	- Sink, stove, and fridge (AC/DC/LPgas) in cabinet
	- All other cabinets (Air cond. unit mounted in top cabinet 
	  not included.)
	- 2 tables (front and rear) plus associated mounts
	- Top bed, if you need it
	- All misc. panels, etc.
	- Basically, everything behind the drivers seats from a 	
	  poptop Westy except the carpet.

This would be a good opportunity for someone to convert their 
Vanagon to a Westy, if they were so inclined.

Everything is in very good condition.  Asking $800.00 complete.
Would separate if I cannot find a buyer for the whole package.

Also have the poptop with good canvas, and other misc. stuff.  
(Sorry, the engine is already promised to a list member.)

Thanks,
Ron Salmon
