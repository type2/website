Subject: RE: how do clean it?

&gt; 
&gt; For this '83 beast, its battery leaks and white power is forming wherever
&gt; the metal is touching the fluid. What is the easiest way to clean it up
&gt; without a surgery? Because the battery is right on top of the fuel tank's
&gt; pipe, I can see the &quot;white stuff&quot; build-up on the pipe too. It bothers
&gt; me....

First, get that leaky #$%!$%*(# outta there.  I'd use a pair of rubber gloves.
The crystals are some sort of acidic deposit.  They also form on the battery 
leads and terminals of non-leaking (normal) batteries.  In this case, there 
is nothing wrong, that's just the normal function of the battery.  I like to 
use a solution of water and baking soda to neutralize the acid.  Keep applying 
the dissolved soda until it stops fizzing, then flush everything clean with 
plenty of water.  The terminals will probably need a good cleaning, then apply 
a little vaseline to coat the terminals, and slow the buildup of more deposits.
