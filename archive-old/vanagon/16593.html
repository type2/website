Markus Benne suggested we Ottawians get together for a Pizza and meet one
another.  Sounds good to me.  I&quot;m good for next Thursday and the SO and kid
will come.  Bells Corners ?  Just a suggestion as to where.  I'm in
Kinburn and that's not too bad of a ride for me.  The place should have
&quot;good&quot; draft beer, maybe &quot;East Side Marios&quot; ?  Whddaya say  you other
Ottawaian Vanagon Listers ?

Cheers

Frank
