Subject: Lug nuts and mirrors

Went to take the snow tires off the van; they are mounted on separate rims.
For the first time in 12 years of such changes they are frozen in place.  I
am soaking them daily with WD40, any other ideas?  Contributing to the
problem is the stock lug wrench that over the years has egged out making it
tend to round off nuts.

Further 12 year woes, the right mirror went limp.  A hex lug bonded into the
plastic housing pulled out.  My assumption is this is not repairable.  Two
possibilities for repair would be 24 hour epoxy, or super glue.  Has anyone
ever tried either on a mirror repair?
