I've seen Packard-Bell PCs for sale in stores like Service Merchandise, Best 
Buy, etc.  in the MPLS and Chicago area.  The brand appears to be the 
computer that non-computer stores sell.  I know that I've met a few people 
who have them, but I'm not really in tough with those people anymore.

I recommend you contact big retail stores (Sears, Target, Best Buy....) and 
see if they can help.
