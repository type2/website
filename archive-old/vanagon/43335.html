The Car

1949-66 VW Transporter
&gt;From delivery van to road-trip stalwart
by John F. Katz


     &quot;Prophetically, Volkswagen called it &quot;the shape of trucks to
come&quot;—and it was that revolutionary shape that guaranteed
success for the world's first minivan.
    
      Maj. Ivan Hirst, the British officer who managed the
Volkswagen plant during the postwar occupation, believed that
an inexpensive truck would help rebuild the shattered German
economy. So did Heinz Nordhoff, the ex-Opel executive
hand-picked by Hirst as his civilian successor.
    
    Hybrids with Beetle front ends and van-like rears had been test-
ed before the war, and served the German post office afterward.
But the VW's rear engine limited the room that was left for mail-
bags and other cargo. Under Nordhoff, who took over in
1948, the design staff considered a radical change: If the
driver was moved ahead, over the front wheels, then
cargo could be placed in the large, flat space where the
seats had been. Loads cradled at the center of the wheel-
base could weigh nearly as much as dhe truck itself with-
out affecting handling, and side doors could provide
curb-side access. Large commercial trucks and buses
had been built that way for years, but no one had applied
a &quot;forward control&quot; layout to a compact vehicle for the
small-business and consumer market.
    
    Assembly started slowly in November 1949.
Volkswagen classified the Beetle and its variants as
Type 1, so the truck was Type 2, although from the start
it was also called the Transporter. The truck shared the
Beetle's 94.5-inch wheelbase, but aside from the engine
and transmission, few parts were interchangeable.
Instead of the Beetle's simple backbone, a full ladder
frame supported the Transporter. The truck's independent, torsion-
bar suspension looked like the passenger car's, but every piece of it
was bigger and stronger. The Transporter gained low-end grunt
through Kubelwagen-style reduction gears built into dhe rear hubs.
    
    With only 30 horsepower from 1.1 Iiters, the Transporter could
climb a 24 percent grade and cruise at 50 mph, fully laden. It
weighed only 1900 pounds empty, but could carry a payload
of 1650 pounds—650 pounds more than a full-size American
half-ton pickup. It was slow by American standards, but easily met
European expectations for a working vehicle.
    
    VW offered the truck in the United States in 1951, the same year
that passenger-carrying Kombi and Microbus versions debuted.
Pickup variations, with folding gates at the sides and rear, joined
the lineup. Owners could fit the spacious interiors with cabinets or
shelves or with whatever suited their needs.
    
    Nordhoff made anxious dealers wait for Beetles while he shifted
factory capacity to trucks, and soon the Transporter outsold all other
commercial vehicles in Germany. In 1956, VW opened a new
facility in Hanover that was dedicated to Type 2 production, and
in 1960, the one-millionth Volkswagen truck rolled off the line.
    
      Before a new body arrived in late 1967, VW had sold two mil-
lion Transporters worldwide. Performance improved along the
way, with a 36-hp, 1.2-liter engine in 1954, 40 horsepower and
syncromesh in 1961. A 1.5-liter engine producing 53 hp at 4200
rpm arrived as an option in 1963 and became stan-
dard the following year. By that time, Volkswagen
had increased the van's carrying capacity to 1830
pounds in base trim (VW called it a 7/8 ton truck),
with a full one-ton version available.
    
    Our 1965 panel van belongs to Larry Holbert—
avid VW and Porsche collector, brother of the
late Al Holbert and vice president of Holbert Motor Cars in
Warrington, Pa. Larry bought the vehicle eight years ago, restored
it and painted it to resemble the service vans used 30 years ago
at his family's dealership.
    
    Getting in means wiping your butt on the wheel well, but once
inside there's enough room for anyone under six feet tall, with flat
but adequately comfortable seats. The eight-foot distance between
the driver and the engine mufffles some of the racket; it's quieter in
the truck than in a vintage Porsche. The shifter feels wobbly in
neutral but slips cleanly into gear. Just off idle, the air-cooled flat
four generates enough torque to inch the van slowly forward, but
perceptible acceleration requires an aggressive driving style. Mash
ing the throttle to the floor and shifting just beyond the recom-
mended points works well; the engine trills happily at this treat-
ment, but bogs down between gears when driven more gently.
    
    The suspension bounds over a bumpy back road. The steering
wanders, the body squeaks and rattles fiercely. But the ride is com-
fortable on a smooth highway. The hydraulically damped steering
offers low effort with adequate road feel, and, driven with respect
for its high, narrow dimensions, the van corners nimbly. The
brakes require little effort, and they can be used with confidence.
    
    Back in his college days, Larry used to commute across
Pennsylvania to Ohio State in a Microbus. &quot;You're having so
much fun you don't notice the discomfort,&quot; he laughs. &quot;It has
plenty of soul.&quot;
    
    But the main selling point for VW trucks was economy, not
soul. One advertisement tabulated costs for a VW van vs. a
&quot;usual truck&quot;—presumably an American pickup—showing
how, in less than three years, the operator of the Volkswagen
truck could save enough money to buy a new Beetle. By 1964,
Volkswagen was selling more than 50,000 trucks annually in the
United States. But during a trade dispute with West Germany
over U.S. chickens, Washington slapped a 25 percent tariff on
German commercial vehicles. Volkswagen trucks were no longer
economical—and U.S. sales never recovered. 


[  Black &amp; white photo shows a the 1965 panel van mentioned in
the article with VW, Audi, &amp; Porsche logos on the side.  The
printing on the side of the van under the logos reads:  ]
HOLBERT MOTOR CARS
US RT 611
WARRINGTON PA
343 1600
    
[Photo caption reads:]
VW ads noted fow the van’s slab sides provided more advertising
room than the side of a conventional commercial pickup or
panel truck.
