&gt;this must be that Southern sport referred to as   *noodl'in*
&gt;(actually, noodl'in is far worse-- copius amount of alcohol followed
&gt;by a trip to a river whereby one reaches his/her hand and arm up into
&gt;holes in the bank with the hopes of grabbing a 30 pound catfish.  nevermind
&gt;the cottonmouths, gators, etc.--  but I'm a northerner and really
&gt;couldn't substantiate this.  they drive to the river in a VW van)

nah. they call that kind of catfishing: Grabbling. they really do it, too.
i saw a 40-lb catfish the fellow had caught that way. BIGGGGGG damn fish!!!
it's amazing it didn't drown him ... or at least swallow his arm. but they
don't have much of a set of teeth. now, i do NOT think i'd want to go
Grabbling for Pike!!!! :)

the noodle thing is an old expression about the difficulty of a situation
or thing: why, i'd rather try to stick a wet noodle up a wildcat's ass!!!

so, yeah. you're probably right: if it's difficult (or crazy), and you do it
anyway, you're probably just 'noodlin' along. :)
