Subject: rust on a long block

I've gotten a long block and have yet to put on the head. The problem is
that some rust has started on the top and has edged down into a
cylinder, not much and not very far.

What is the best way to deal with this stuff?  I screwed up so far and I
dont want to make it any worse.

Any help would be appreciated.  Thanks.
