Sometime this week, some a-hole drained the gas out of my bus, while I was
at work and it was parked in my driveway at home! $&amp;$&amp;*$  I went to work
on the problems I'd describe earlier this week, and the thing started, then
died.  After much fussing, I realised I had no GAS!  Last sunday I'd put 5
gallons in, and don't tell me you use that much running in your driveway 
on and off for half an hour!

So, I did them one better.  I took an old piece o'shit gas can a friend gave
me, put 2 gallons of gas in it, along with 3 cups of good ol C &amp; H (pure
cane sugar), and put the gas can on the roof rack, with a couple of bungees
to hold it down. 

This AM, the can, and 1 bungee are gone.  I made it a point to theatrically
be mad when I left for work this AM and &quot;discovering&quot; it missing.  

I can't wait to see whose car in the neighborhood fizzles out!  I suspect it 
was someone in the 'hood or one of their home-boys!
