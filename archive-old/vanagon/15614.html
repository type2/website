Subject: Re: neat vw brochure at dealer

&gt;Volswagen has a new video available to commemorate their 40th
it is available by calling 1-800-444-vwus. 

&gt;I was just in at my local VW dealer yesterday, and picked up
&gt;a brochure which might interest some of you.  It's called 
&gt;&quot;Volkswagen in America: Chronical of a Car Company,&quot; and is put
&gt;out in honor of VW's 40th anniversary celebration.  Inside, it 
&gt;gives an interesting synopsis of Vw's history for the various
&gt;decades, and outside, there's a lovel picture of all different
&gt;makes/models/years of different VWs.  The dealer has a poster
&gt;of this same picture enlared and hung on the entry door.  Don't
&gt;know whether the poster is available to the public, but the
&gt;brochure itself functions as a small version of that.
