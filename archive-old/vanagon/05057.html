Subject: Was: YES:6-ply tires, what about 15&quot; wheels

This has probably been beaten to death also, but what about 86ing the
damn 14&quot; wheels and going to 15&quot;?  The tire options for 15&quot; are at least
10x ...

As long as the bolt pattern AND offset are correct it'll work okay.
I don't think there will be a clearance problem in the wheel well.
The speedo will be off, but that can be dealt with also.  

comments?
