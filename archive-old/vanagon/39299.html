Subject: I buy Syncro?

Hello, All, 
     I hope to get response on this matter.  I am looking at a 1987 
Vanagon Camper Syncro at a dealership.  The body is in great shape as is 
the interior.  There are no problems with the engine...it runs strong 
and there is 66,000 miles on the thing.  The dealer is asking $11,300 
for the camper and is not budging at all.  Do you as individuals or 
collective feel that this is a fair asking price?	
	I know that the N.A.D.A. book value for resale is $8250 and that 
the Kellie Blue Book retail price is $13,000.  Which one is more 
realistic?  What are some prices you have spent (if you have purchased a 
wasserboxer)?  I am in a conundrum.  I need help.  I will not disclose 
where the Vanagon is until I decide whether to buy it or not...I want 
the first chance if it is a good deal.....
	Please, help me out on this one.  I am using my '86 Volvo for 
trade if I get it.  I was offered $2000 as trade in for the Volvo and 
the remainder is $9300  &quot;out the door&quot; (tax, tags...etc.)
	What do you guys think?
	Thanks in advance for your feedback.
