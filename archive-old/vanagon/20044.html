&gt; Try diesel fuel....  or foaming GUNK (brand) spray solvent.

Agreed.

&gt;From my experience the other day in cleaning off the bus engine, the 
Foaming Gunk is &gt;&gt;MUCH&lt;&lt; better than the plain Gunk.

They were the same price so I bought one of each, and quickly 
realized that the foaming variety actually worked, whereas the normal 
took quite a bit of scrubbing on my part to get an equal job of 
cleaning.
