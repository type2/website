Subject: Re: Altitude adjustment

&gt;Anyone familiar with altitude sickness in a Vanagon? We're headed to
&gt;higher elevations and I'm wondering what, if anything, needs to be
&gt;adjusted when we get there. What are the symptoms? Can I do the
&gt;adjustment myself?

I just took my camper up to Crater Lake (7000') for 3 days.  Not a bit of
trouble, despite the cold and 20' snow drifts.  (I did wonder aloud what
'vapor lock' is.  I hear it's a problem at high altitudes.)
