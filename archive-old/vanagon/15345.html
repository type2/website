Noticing the post from nrubin, our glorious rangleder, I'll offer a testimonial
from a long time pyromid user.

Their literature is a bit embellished, first off.  Yes, it's definitely light
weight, easy to set up, simple to clean (dishwasher), impressive with it's    
shape and assembled portability.  No you can't cook a haunch of moose but it
does well with chicken, steaks, grilled vegies, feesh, and so forth.  They 
come in small (8&quot;) medium (10&quot;) and large (12&quot;) and pack away to ~1.5&quot; by 
8,10, or 12 inches square.  The thermal efficiency drivel seems a bit over
rated by my experience but the critter is the easiest to use grill/hibachi
sort of thing I've seen.  Functionally more difficult than a trench lined
with aluminum foil sided by bricks but easier to pack than the bricks and 
you can set it on the camp table to raise it to usable height.

A company in Hobart, Indiana makes a squarish aluminum camp dutch oven
that fits the 10&quot; to a tea/tee/T.  I've used the combination for several
years and other than the initial price, heartily recommend it.   My original
purchase was for a grill device that would fit easily into a Krauser Bag for
a BMW motorcycle.

I'd be happy to demo at the next feeding frenzy.
