Subject: bizzaro...!

There was a 1960's bus in the comics yesterday...in the comic strip called 
'bizzaro'...for those of you that don't get that one, it was a bunch of 
people in a bus driving towards a nude beach...with a ton of other cars 
backed up infront of them...the people in the bus were saying..&quot;I'm not 
sure this is gonna be worth it guys.  Every single one of these other 
cars is filled with squirrelly losers just like us.&quot;  Oh yeah, another 
thing...I was driving behind a VW today, a jetta to be exact, and it had 
a bumper sticker that said &quot;I may be slow, but Im infront of you.&quot;  It 
just gave me a laugh, and I thought I needed one of those on my bus!
