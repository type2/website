&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 	There are three on each front door, two underneath the back
&gt; &gt; 	seat/bed, two within the AC compartment above the pullout	
&gt; &gt; 	seat/bed and under the pop-top bed (does that make sense?)
&gt; &gt; 	and two tweeters -- here goes -- mounted on the metal divider
&gt; &gt; 	between the front section (the front seats) and the back...on the 
&gt; &gt; 	same plane as the pop top screen that allows access to the luggage
&gt; &gt; 	rack....The amp is located behind the glove compartment and the
&gt; &gt; 	equalizer (also a Blaupunkt) is the old style movable one attached
&gt; &gt; 	to a bendable metal coil - VU meters and all, located underneath 
&gt; &gt; 	the driver's seat and projecting out above the parking brake...
&gt; &gt; 	_killer_ sounds...! - I'm quite lucky to have come across this 	
&gt; &gt; 	already installed.

&gt; Where did you say you park this? :-)

	Believe it or not in downtown Atlanta (rated one of the highest
	crime/capita) cities in the country...not an easy feeling to live 
	with.

	The radio itself (again a Blaupunkt - don't mean to be so
	brand name conscious :) ) is a face removable type which makes
	things just a little better...

	So - Da Truck Club..you think?
