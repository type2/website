Subject: Can One Test the Piezo?

After collecting methods, hints, tips and techniques for starting the
Dometic fridge on LP, I still can't get my fridge working.  Thanks to all
who offered advice.

Last night I went out in the dark and tried starting the fridge again.  In
addition to not getting any &quot;ticking&quot; noise from the ignitor or any light,
steady or flashing, from the indicator lights, I didn't see any light
through the &quot;view hole&quot; in the lower left corner of the fridge.  I thought
for sure I would see something in the darkness.

Yes the fridge works on battery and A/C.  I have tried pumping the air pump
to death.  I also had compresses air blown through the drain hole. I
checked the two fuses for the kitchen, both are ok.

Is there any way to test the piezo without removing the fridge?

Any help, next steps, oversights, possible tricks are welcome.
