Subject: Re: Any musicians out there?

Bob and Penny Lee ask if anyone else has had the nerve to play
a wind instrument at a campsite.

On a cross-country trip several years ago, I
took my bass trombone along and did quite a lot of practicing --
I wanted to be in good shape for the fall playing season.
We managed usually to find isolated campsites, but there were
a few times we had to pull up next to occupied sites.
I asked permission, and usually got it.  I tried to avoid
the more distressing-sounding etudes (pedal-note practice,
for example)...

I usually perched myself in the top bunk of the Westy and played out 
the front screen window.
