Subject: re:my first adventure

&gt;Meanwhile, gas is
&gt;going EVERYWHERE, running all over me, all over the blank I'm using as a
&gt;creeper, down the gutter. I hear cars whizzing by and wonder if anyone
&gt;is about to throw a butt out the window. (Remember the scene from The
&gt;Great Waldo Pepper? I sure did?!)


I my limited experience of working on motor cars.  I have learned two thing
about fuel systems.

1) Burn all the gas in the tank be for you pull then engine and put the body
in storage.  (I wore gas and had to by several gas cans to empty my 72 loaf.)

2) When installing fuel injectors be sure not to clip the rubber o-rings.
  (did this while replacing a chry 2.2 turbo.  fuel tends to spray  every
where) 

Hmm make that three
3) gas and tar driveways don't mix. well acually they do.

also a question.

I live near chicago and need to by some parts please let me know if JCW is a
bad place to by pistons, cylinders, and cam shaft.

Thanks and be warned
