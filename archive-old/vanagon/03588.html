Subject: Re: spark plugs

joel...According to, what Derek, and now I, calls LI's legendary Vanagon
mech, Dennis Haynes, he doesn't think its such a good idea to use the bosch
triple-pronged plugs in an engine not designed for them. He's had problems
with them in different cars.
 
He says, for instance, the cars that use them have coils designed to pump
out more voltage. Adding a new coil to a Vanagon could cause even more
problems in that the computer isn't tuned for it. Hope I didn't burst your
bubble.
 
Anywho, I did pick my 88GL up from him this evening after he fixed my
exhaust system for $187. The dealer wanted to charge me $1200. He said that
another dealer that I no longer use, didn't bolt the manifold back on
correctly when they swapped the cylinder heads for that recall notice.
 
He's also gonna try to squeeze me in for his 100K special for fluids and
plumbing. He mentioned some other stuff like an oil cooler if I was keeping
the thing but I'm sorta set on getting the 96 VR6 EV, hopefully camper, if
and when it comes out...Joey
