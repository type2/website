&gt; 
&gt; Also I am looking for 1 hub cap for her, does anyone have an extra or 
&gt; know where I can get one?
&gt; 
&gt; Also I would like to get a set of the silver caps that are on the older 
&gt; vans, now will these fit on my 82? Where can I get them if they do?
&gt; 
I am fairly certain that the flat late model hub caps will fit. If
indeed they do, check junk yards, swap meets, etc, or order some from a
VW magazine, they're not too expensive.
