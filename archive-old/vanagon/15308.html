&gt;I suppose by that you mean that you're suppose to just bend over and
&gt;just bite it right off the spit and shake till you get a chunk of meat

as any cultured and refined person would know, one simply grasps the bar-b-cue
with one's fingers, extending slightly the smallest finger of each hand as one
might while lifting a teacup.  It is considered acceptable in Polite Southern
Genteel Society, to slightly mash and flatten the bar-b-cue prior to lifting.
This helps keeps the meat from falling in your lap.
