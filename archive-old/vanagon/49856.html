Subject: Dust- thanks, I DID need a mask


	Volks,
	Thanks to all the folk who replied to my earlier posting about
cleaning out my 10 dusty year's accumulation in the garage. A number
of people worried about my wife and child-to-be, and they're safe- 52
miles or more from this place already and not helping. 
	I changed the filters in my pretty-good breathing mask and
tried that without gloves- guess what? No funny taste. I was wrong,
stuff wasn't coming through my finger tips, it was the dust that I
was breathing. (My nose stuffs up and I become a mouthbreather :) )

	I'm still going to make a point of not generating nasty dust
inside, and try to collect what I do generate and send it off to
the land fill in the future. (brake dust, old rust and paint)

	Cheers!
	Bill
