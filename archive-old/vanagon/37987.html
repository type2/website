Subject: 88 Surging &amp; Idle updates

After studying my new Bentley book over the weekend, I now have a 
much better understanding of what's what in my 88 Westy. (one comment 
- I was a little disappointed by the Bentley, as compared to the one 
for my Jetta - at 1/2 the price, the Jetta one has much more descriptive 
text on the procedures)

1st I checked the timing - it was right on the mark.
I then did a quick idle adjustment without disconnecting the stuff 
listed in the book, just to see how it drove home from Vancouver. 
Idle seemed to stay between 850-1000 cold &amp; hot now.

Last night, I did the full idle check - unplugged O2 sensor, 
unplugged idle stab. plug near thermostat - it was *very* dirty (not 
sure what effect this would have...), pinched PCV hose, then checked 
throttle switch with a meter. Hmmm. Switch is still open at idle 
position. Full throttle - closes ok. Slowly reduce throttle - 
switch opens.... stays open at idle. hmmm. Tried a few times slowly - same 
thing. I then tried snapping thottle closed quickly - the switch 
closed at idle! This may explain why problems only occur during slow 
steady driving. Tried to adjust switch but small screw is stripped &amp; 
corroded.

How hard is it to remove the throttle body/switch? Is the switch a 
sealed unit, or can I clean it up?

Also another note: I noticed chirping noise &amp; some missing. Checked 
plugs - all were looser than 15ft/lbs, so I removed, applied moly 
grease &amp; torqued in. It nows purrs at 900 rpm!

I haven't lost my mind;  I'm sure it's backed up on tape somewhere!
