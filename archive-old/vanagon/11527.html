Subject: ITS FIXED!!!


 	Thats right, after months of bitching and moaning,
and replacing my entire ignition system, I finally got
my FI to work correctly (or good enough).

	I broke down and took apart my air sensor.  Sure enough, this 
was th dog.  I bent the wiper a bit, and viola, it was fixed.  No dead spots,
and my new coil,rotor, and cap make it run even better.

	Gotta get me cold start fixed, and injectors checked out(12 mpg is not good),
some lube in the CV joints, set the brakes, and then I shall road trip 
in complete confidence and style :)

	As my brother said &quot;You know, if you weren't manic depressive, you'd
probably be really happy right now, wouldn't you?&quot;

Thanks to everyone who offered advice, and encouragement. 
Its really wierd being able to turn the key, have it start,
and then drive it without it running goofy or dying.
Someday I may even get the funny rear end noises fixed.


Has anyone ever went to a job interview drving their breadloaf?
(oh, in my vehicle dynamics class, the prof calls our models
&quot;bricks&quot;.  I think its kinda funny....)
