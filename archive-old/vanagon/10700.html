Subject: Re: Coolant disposal

I asked my wife about what happens to the antifreeze that you pour down
the drain.  She knows more about this sort of thing than I do.  And pretty
much everything else, except maybe mathematics.  Anyway, she said that
there are bacteria that eat it, break it down into harmless substances
in the disposal ponds.

She said, incidentally, that the real headache for the sewage treatment
people is heavy metals.  They're a lot harder to sort out.

I'm all in favor of environmentally conscientious practices, but I think
we should use our conscience thoughtfully.  (But don't think too hard, or
you'll end up getting rid of that beautiful Westy and switching to more
primitive modes of transportation....  :-)
