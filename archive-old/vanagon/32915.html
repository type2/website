Subject: trans?


 has anyone ever experienced this,
 upon taking up drive with a four speed gearbox (86up &quot;ACW')
 ever noticed hearing a not so happy sound, like a crunch.
 i have noticed this with my gearbox. it doesn't happen very often
 and i believe that it is in the differential.
 i have resently replaced all four cv joints, so they are very good
 and i just pulled the trans and replaced the clutch completely.

 so, though the clutch is new the noise could be the clutch
 springs reacting to torque?
    and while the trans was out i was sure to check the condition of
 the cross shaft which the TO bearing rides on and it was in very good
 shape ( i have had to fix many of these they like to go bad).
 i know that this is very vague and i hate to throw it out to you
 but if any of you have any idea let me know.

 i really want to rebuild my original gearbox which is now in my
 basement along with my original motor. The original gearbox
 in my truck had a much better ring and pinion ratio for
 city driving and low end power. my current trans is out of
 an 87' van. it's a little better on the highway, but
 i miss the street racer feel that i had originally.
 so, the original one is still good, but i was getting real
 noisey and i didn't want to destroy it.
