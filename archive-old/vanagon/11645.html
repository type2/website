&gt;anyone know of other poptop vendors and their respective years?  More 
&gt;anal-retentive trivia for the FAQ!

Last year a lady retired and took her Vanagon on the road w/her daughter.
It was a white vanagon with a camper conversion by AST (I think).
There was a 2' high fixed fiberglass roof and the name ADVENTUREWAGEN
in the red pinstriping.

These same folks created a version for the 'breadloaf' style bus.

It sort of looked like David Schwartze's blue '73. (seen it on www)
