Subject: FS: '63 Notchback


Saw a white Notch driving along in the north part of San Diego this
morning, with the following sign in the window:


      FOR SALE
   '63 Notchback
   (619) 271-0804


It was white in color, and looked very clean and straight from where
I sat, two lanes over. Didn't see any smoke, and it seemed to be keeping
up with traffic OK. I couldn't see the interior, and couldn't see if
it was a standard or automatic etc. (Did any of these even come with
automatics? It's probably a standard, I would guess).

That's all I know about it. I called the number, and got an answering
machine. Anyone is interested, I suggest you call the guy directly at
that number.
