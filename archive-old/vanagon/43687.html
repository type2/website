Subject: Busses in the Bushes... kinda long...

Talked to the Owner of the (now comfirmed 2) busses I spotted 
the other night, 1) a late '67 pop-top westy 100+ miles, fella is 
original owner, last registered in '73, has been sitting since, complete
interior parts sitting inside Large post and beam barn... custom 
modified Full roof rack(center was removed to fit over Pop-top, very 
well done) several windows on passenger side were removed, resulting 
in Rust damage to floor and door sill, frame looks solid(cursury look)  
2) '63-'66  11 window Deluxe &quot;parts bus&quot; complete... front bumper $ 
over-riders have very minor surface rust...all glass is VGC... latches 
for pop-out windows GC... Jailbars in rearmost windows complete and VGC 
Floors in GC couldn't look under it due to Huge wasp nest...he also has 
1/2 dozen Trannies, at least two set of Reduction gear boxes, numerous 
fenders, hoods, bumpers and such for early Bugs ( his Brother was 
Heavily into mid-50s to mid-60s Beetles before he died), also has 10-15 
6v starters/generators... several &quot;running&quot; 40hp, 1 1300, and 2 1500...
3-4 40hp long blocks unknown condition, and last but not least 2 OE wood 
slat Bug roof racks!

		Heavy negotiations are under way!!!

	Hope to come to terms with him by early next week... he just 
wants to reclaim the Barn storage for his custom wood shop... wants it 
ALL gone by the end of the month...

		
		will keep ya informed, as a good bit of it will be for 
sale... ( I might keep one of the roof racks for my '64 Deluxe bug..)
