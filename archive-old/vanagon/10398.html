&gt; &gt;&gt;another weirder answer to the missing brake fluid could be that the BRAKE
&gt; &gt;&gt;master is leaking into the booster, hence the dissapearing fluid.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;Anyone???

&gt; 
&gt; This is highly likely. My old volvo 264 had this illness once. I first
&gt; noticed that brake fluid was low. Filled up and then went low again in
&gt; a couple of weeks. Eventualy the car did not want to stop when I
&gt; commanded it to. The booster was identified to be failing. So I replaced
&gt; it and found that there was some liquid in it and I believe it wanted
&gt; to tell me it was stuffed with brake fluid.

I had a 66 122 volvo wagon that had the booster sucking brake fluid
problem. I kept adding fluid but there were absolutely no leaks to be
found anywhere in the system.

One side effect of the brake fluid getting into the booster is that
the fluid would sometimes make it into the engine and burn in the
cylinders.  This would produce the thickest white smoke I have ever
seen coming out of any car's tailpipe. It was so thick the car behind
would be completely enveloped and could not see a thing. I thought it
might make a neat James Bond style car mod to add this &quot;capability&quot;.

Considering the distance to the vanagon engine, I don't think you
would see the large smoke cloud if the booster is sucking brake fluid.
