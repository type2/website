Subject: VW parts houses

All,

Fortunately, I've had to order parts 2 times, once was from  The Trim Shop, and
the second was from Wild Thing Parts. The person I talked to at the Trim Shop
kept me from making an expensive mistake with my order, and I got everything
withing 3 days. The order from Wild Thing parts was faxed in late in the
evening, and when I called the next afternoon to verify that the order was
filled, I was told that it was all shipped that morning, and he read off my
order from memory.
Wouldn't it be nice if all parts houses remembered your order almost 24 hours
later, without searching through a pile of paper for 5 minutes, just to verify
that it will be shipped in 2 months?

hey everyone,
        i remember someone posting a story where somewhere in their
travels they recieved a ticket for sleeping in their camper at a rest
stop.  i've never had any problems before, but my girlfriend and i are
going to be sleeping at at least one rest stop in washington this
weekend.  anyone have any bad experiences in that state?

hope everyone gets at least one chance to sleep in their buses this
weekend on a wonderful trip with beautiful friends!!!!


take care,
        brandy
                (and his much loved '73 camper)
