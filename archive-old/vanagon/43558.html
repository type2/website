Subject: road trip report and strange happenings.

Hey all,
This past Thursday I drove from here (Johnson City, TN) to Roanoke VA to pick up my girlfriend and then drove back.  I repeated this trip on Sunday evening.  The trip is about 3 hours each way, traveling all interstate.  So here's how it went.
