Yes, Thom, in many areas truckers just don't ack the old headlight flash 
anymore.  Depends on region and type of truck I found on our 'round 
North America trip last year.  Best places for getting acks: rural areas, 
espeially across the great plains or long desert hauls.  Worst: urban 
areas, especially in the East.

Best trucks: Professional lines like J.B. Hunt or Schneider 
International.  Greyhound busses can be good too.  Long-haul truckers in 
general.

Worst: Dump trucks, logging trucks, 5-tons.  Local trucks in general.

I tend to get more acks at night than during the day.  This is probably 
because my flash is more noticeable at night (even though I don't flash 
until the trucker checks the right side mirror), and because I always 
drive with lights on, even during the day time.

This IS VW bus related content, since flashing to let folks back in is a 
big part of helping out the traffic situation as we drive highways 
with average traffic speeds of 65+ mph yet many of us older air-cooled 
people bop along at under 60.
