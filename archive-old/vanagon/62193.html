&gt; &gt; Hey, my brother tried to pass inspection yesterday w/ his 1980 Vanagon
&gt; &gt; air-cooled and he failed because of CO2 emissions.  What could be done
&gt; &gt; to pass inspection quickly, then what should we look for to repair?

&gt; Hey, me too! Must be an epidemic!  I'm getting desperate, bot a bottle

  We had luck with putting about 60% racing alcohol in the tank. Just
enough to get to the inspection station. Fill with gas on the way home.
 Type one engines are a lot easier. A lot of shops here have engines
around the shop that always pass. They just trade engines and take the
car to inspection and then change the engine back.
