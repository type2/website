Thanks Dave,

Of course you know, your discussion of the Subaru has now qualified you as
one of us on the &quot;Subversives&quot; list.

I've been in Thailand since December and will continue my invstigations when
I return to the Seattle area.  I expect Kennedy has learned more since I left
and I'm eager to see what they have come up with on the oil pan question.

I was asking about the resevoir idea before I left.....   My main concern
over the air intake is not about water,  but about the tremendous amount of
dust ingested by the air cleaner if allowed to breathe from the engine
compartment.  Should be an easy solution,  just a little nervous about
recieving a kit by UPS,  spreading everything out only to find all those
nasty little surprises you forgot to think about.

I've done many successful and unsuccessful engine projects with the
air-cooled engines over the last 25 years....  I'm just not ready to go
through that lesson with the Vanagon engine.

Thanks,
Curt Long
