&gt;Just got back from a week in the Rockies. I think I have found the US 
&gt;town with the most VW bus/ vans per capita. It is Crested Butte, 
&gt;Colorado. There are about 1000 year round residents and I saw in one 
&gt;day:
&gt;1 split
&gt;2 Westy Syncros
&gt;1 reg Synchro
&gt;8 Baywindow Westies
&gt;3 Vanagons
&gt;5 Vanagon Westies
&gt;6 Baywindows
&gt;1 Baywindow with a Bug body top welded in the roof.
&gt;Some were in various states of dis-repair but overall most looked 
&gt;real road worthy. The most noticable feature on most were the custom 
&gt;bike and ski racks. I noticed some real interesting installations 
&gt;including a Thule roof rack mounted on the rear hatch.
&gt;I traveled many other towns in the area and didn't see near as many.
&gt;This town was a VW owners heaven!

Charles:

Open your eyes man!!!The law of percentages is way out of kilter here!!
The (V)W to person(?) ratio is way of!  Did you happen to notice a pod
in the back of your westfalia?
Has your wife been acting strangely? 

Keep watching the skies.
