&gt;Is there any way that I can find out if my 86 GL has been serviced for all
&gt;known problems? I know on my Ford, they always put a recall sticker under
&gt;the hood and it was reported back to them that the vehicle had been
&gt;serviced. They keep a database for such information, does VW have a similar
&gt;program?

Washington, D.C.  20590

Depending on the number of TSBs issued to date for your vehicle, it will
cost $20 to $40 to have them reproduced and mailed to you. You'll need
to send a written request, but first call to hear the recorded message
for instructions. &quot;
