Subject: Westy restoration

Back in 1990, Hot VW's did a series of articles on the restoration of an
early ('71, I think) Westfalia, that covered everything from engine mods
to replacing the canvas top.  I have a couple of articles (canvas top
replacement and torsion bar adjustment), but sure would like the whole
series.  Does anybody have the whole series by any chance, or know which
issues these ran in (and how many there were)?

Thanks!
