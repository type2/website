Subject: Re: Collapsing Westy Tents

&gt; got my 83 westy from a buddy who got a job as a VP overseas so had to quit
&gt;all his cars and move out. He gave me a large cloth bag and said it's a camping
&gt;tent inside. I have never had a chance to open it up and see what it is yet.
&gt;Now all the messages on this net wanting a westy tent has gotten me curious.
&gt;So what is a westy tent? I am going to go home to find out if I got one too.



Errr... I wouldn't open that bag up, just call Purolater and tell them to 
send it to me asap, I'll handle it for you.... and if you don't buy that...

well, you should have two bags, one tent, yellow orange, 18&quot; x 30&quot; bundle, 
and a tent pole bag, 40lbs! in green. Not backpacking material. I don't know 
if a vanagon tent was available, I've never seen one, just the old style bus 
version, which just barely mates to a Vanagon.   tim s.
