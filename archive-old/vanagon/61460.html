          We finally have our fridge working in all three modes but I have 
          never heard a fan running in it.  Wouldn't we hear this at night 
          when there are no other noitse?
     
     Last Saturday in Alamogordo NM, I went to sleep to the peaceful hum of 
     the cooling fan running (Fridge on AC).  I woke up at 3:30 AM to the 
     distraction of the fan cycling on and off at about 30 second 
     intervals.  I'm gonna pull it out and have a look.
     
     By the way, running on all three modes at various times, we kept the 
     fridge in the 30s and 40s all weekend.  Nice.
