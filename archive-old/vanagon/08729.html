Subject: Re; Getting 1 piece drum off

I've had this problem as well. Fortunately the local VW parts store rents 
a gizmo they apparently made up (called a drum puller) which resembles a 
gear puller, but attaches to the drum by the lug nuts. You then tighten a 
center bolt to force the drum off the spindle. Check your local 
VW/imports parts shops for this type of deal or else rent a gear puller 
from an equiptment rental shop (the kind of place you rent heavy duty 
equiptment to work on your home/yard).

Good luck!
