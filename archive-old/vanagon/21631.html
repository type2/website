Subject: '59 Bus, '67 Bug to trade or sell 

Howdy all, a friend of mine in COlorado is moving back to NC, and needs a way
to get here. She has a '59 panel van conversion, in good shape, with all the 
necessary parts, she just hasn't been able to get it together. She also has
a running '67 Bug, with a perfect interior. (I have never seen them, this is 
just from phone conversations).
Anyway, she wants to trade them for a sturdy camper, which will carry her from 
Boulder to NC. IF she can't find any trades, she will probably sell them.
So, if anyone is interested, please call 
Nicole, at 303-499-7587
