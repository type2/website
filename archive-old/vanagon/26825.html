Subject:       Re: New '56 Sunroof Cover

&gt;     Put a new sunroof cover on the bus yesterday.  A lot easier than
&gt; it was the first 2 times...
&gt; 
&gt;     I'm too tired to go into all the details right now, but if someone
&gt; wants the procedure, I'd be happy to detail it.
&gt; 
&gt;     The only bummer was one of the nylon riders for the head bow
&gt; broke, which lets the front bow come off the rail.  I'm not even gonna
&gt; try and find a new part, gonna buy a chunk of plastic and fab a new one...

Thom,

Your post did not go by unnoticed.  I am about to purchase a canvas 
cover for the '57 and would love some pointers on how to do it.  My 
current vinyl cover is coming to pieces.

In fact the whole mechanism eludes me.  I see pictures of these buses 
with the top all tidily folded perfectly at the very end of the roof. 
My top just seems to bunch up and go about 8&quot; up into the air, apart 
from the fact that you can't get the last foot or so open.

Anywho...
