Hey all,
I've had a little time now to spend with my new westy out camping.  
Everything worked just fine and it withstood the severe storms that went 
through central Indiana last weekend (with no leaks at that).

I am wondering if there is something I should do to help preserve the pop 
top (similar to regular waxing done to paint).

I searched the archives for a bentley for my 86, but did not come up with 
anything I felt was a sure lead.  I went to amazon books, and they said 
it is out of print.  Any ideas?

Is anyone out there still parting out vanagons (westy's).  I have a few 
things that were missing on mine that I want to replace and would like to 
find used (I have already found many new).

Anyone have a pattern of there original front curtains?  Anyone willing 
to measure them for me?  I have decided to make some, (although I found 
an auto shade called 'Wings' for vans that covers all three front windows 
very well).  The problem I have with getting started on making some is 
that I have never really seen any and want to make them as close to 
original as possible.

TIA
Gretchen
