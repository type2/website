Subject: 1997 EV/Winnebago

I just got some info from a local dealer on some of the changes from the
'95 EV Camper to the '97.

new VR6 engine
new engine and transmission mounts (3)
140 hp  (was 109)
177lb-ft: torque  (was 140lb-ft)
Dual airbags added
ABS made standard
Traction control system added (low speed)
4-wheel disc brakes (rear added)
Automatic transmission (4-speed) made standard
Any thoughts on any of these changes???
