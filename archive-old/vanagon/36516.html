Subject: Re: Oil temp sending unit location on a type 4

&gt;Howdy,
&gt;Does anybody know of a great place to mount the oil temp sending unit 
&gt; on a Type IV? With my upright motors I would mount them in the drain 
&gt; plate or tee off the pressure sending unit hole. I don't want to tee 
&gt; off the pressure unit because I would need to modify the tin and I 
&gt; don't think that it is the most accurate place. Could I drill a hole 
&gt; in the sump(?) plate on the bottom- the one right beneath the oil 
&gt; tube- or is there a better location.
&gt;
&gt;TIA 
&gt;Clay
&gt;

VDO suggests drilling a hole in the sump plate and mounting the sensor
there.  It would probably make sense to remove the sump plate first, so you
don't get any metal shavings in the engine.  Some say that the oil sump is
where the oil in the engine is at its hottest point, though.
