Subject: Overheating - 86 Syncro

(Trying this again, sorry if it posted twice)

Listee's

Hola, My Syncro is in the midst of overheating problems and I could use
some advice before going to a potentially costly mechanic.

Two days ago while on a short highway journey (10 miles) I looked down at
my temp gague and noticed it was completely maxed out.  I pulled off the
highway, somewhat near my destination, as I looked at the engine I noticed
coolant shooting out at about the point directly below the overflow tank
(about the same point where the water pump lies as well).  Shut the van
down and let her cool for a spell before driving the short distance home.

The next day a friend and I conducted a litany of tests:

1.)  Made sure there was adaquate oil in the engine.

2.)  Checked the coolant hoses for leaks under pressure, with vehicle
running (not a pressure test), there didn't appear to be any (my hoses look
like shit and definately need to be replaced).  The hose leading to the
radiator was warm (not hot) and the return hose was cool, but the radiator
was cool.

3.)   Tightened the alternator belt which incidentally was loose (we hoped
the loose belt caused the water pump to work inefficiently and would in
turn cure the vans ailment).  That didn't fix the problem either.

4.)  We bled the radiator to the spec's of the Bentley.  There was some air
in the system - removed the air, it didn;t solve the problem.

5.)  Checked the fuse for the radiator fan, it was good.  (It should be
noted that the radiator was cool even when the van was overheating, so I
guess teh thermo switch wouldn't kick in anyway.  Should that clue lead me
to the water pump????)

6.)  Thought about the thermostat, but haven;t replaced it yet, when the
van is hot it still blows warm/hot air out of the rear heater.

Today I drove the van short distances and the overheating problem still
ocurred, though interestingly when I stopped and let it idel the temp came
down to normal operating temp after a few minutes

I think I should replace the water pump but don't want to spend the money
if that isn't the problem.  Any ideas?????

Many thanks,

Paul
