Subject: Mystery wire on '73 ignition switch

As you all no doubt know, I am a big fan of Bentley, especially for the
wiring diagrams.  Well, Bentley has let me down :-(

Does anyone out there know where the brown/blue wire from the ignition
switch plugs up?  Can someone go out and have a look?  It does not show up
in my Bentley at all, the first time this BOOK(tm) has left me high and
dry.
