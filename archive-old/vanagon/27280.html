                  Hard Shifting in the VW Bus

The Volkswagen shift linkage provides a crisp, positive feel.  In
the bus, positive engagement is achieved with no more than finger
pressure.  If your bus is difficult to shift it is good evidence
there is a problem in the system.

The shift linkage used in the bus is slightly longer and more
complex than that used in the sedan and has two additional
friction points.  The longer gear-shift lever provides the extra
energy needed to overcome the additional friction.

There is a significant difference in the shift-linkage mechanism
used on buses built before August, 1966 and those of later
vintage.  I've no direct experience with shift-linkage for buses
younger than 1968; these comments may apply in a general sense
but are specifically directed toward older buses.

The condition of the transmission mounts is the most critcal
factor in how well your bus shifts.  The three mounts, one front
and two rear, support the transmission so as to align the shift
rod in the nose of the transmission with the shifter-rod attached
to the gear-shift lever in the cockpit.  An elastomeric coupler
is used to join the two rods at the transmission and any
deterioration of the mounts or coupling will make shifting more
difficult.  Original equipment couplers are available from a
number of suppliers.  Use of after-market urethane couplers is
not recommended due to poor quality and high noise transmission.

Running under the cargo bay, the shifter-rod is contained in a
housing, supported by two nylon bushings attached to the shifter-
rod.  The 'lifetime' bushings wear out and must be replaced after
about 100,000 miles of service.  Replacement calls for removal of
the transmission, disconnecting the shifter rod at the front and
removal from the rear.  The bushings are available from Wolfsburg
West and are not expensive. (211 711 185A for buses up to mid-
1962, -185B for buses built between 1962 and Aug, 1967.  Cost is
$2 and you need a pair of them).  If your bus has accumulated
over 100,000 miles it may be wise to plan for removing your
tranny the next time you do the clutch and to pull the shifter
rod and replace the bushings. 

The bus shifter-rod is a two-piece affair with the shorter front
piece extending from under the cockpit floor to just behind the
front axle, bent so as to clear the steering gear and torsion
tubes.  The two pieces are connected with a rigid coupling and a
locking screw that is safety-wired in position.  This is where the
coupling rod is disconnected prior to removal.  The shorter front
piece may then be removed to the rear once the gear shift lever
is removed.

On early buses the front section of the shifter rod was very
similar to the system used in the sedan, with the same Guide
Plate and Bushing (P/N 111 701 259A -- see my sermon on &quot;That
_at_#%* Bushing&quot;).  Fortunately, the bushing is very easy to replace
on the bus.

On buses built after Aug, 1966 Volkswagen used a different
bushing arrangement and Guide Plate, the latter having a pin on
the Guide Plate on the same horizontal plane as the shifter-rod
and engaging a nylon bushing installed in the end of the shifter-
rod.  The new bushing part number is 211-711-197 and costs a
buck.

           Visualizing the Linkage System

Your shift linkage is basically a straight rod extending from the
bottom of the gear-shift lever to the nose of the tranny.  Any
deviation from that straight line will contribute to shifting
problems.  The shifter-rod is supported at each end and by two
bushings along its length.  Any wear in those supports will
contribute to shifting problems.

The transmission is secured to the chassis independently of the
shifter-rod.  Any misalignment of the tranny will cause a kink
in the shift linkage system at the shifter-rod coupler.  And will
contribute to shifting problems, etc. and so on.

                  Tracking Down the Problem

If your bus shifts with difficulty or does not have that clean,
crisp feel that is one of the delights of driving a Volkswagen,
you are probably experiencing the result of accumulated wear or
deterioration in the linkage system.  The various manuals explain
how to check for deteriorated tranny mounts and couplings, and
dismantling your gear shift lever and inspecting it will tell you
if the shifter plate or lever is worn.  Replacing any worn parts
will restore the system to like-new operation, assuming the
problem is not inside the transmission, something you can check
by disconnecting the coupling and running it through the gears by
hand.

If the transmission is properly lubricated, which means changing
the lubricant every two years immediately dealing with a leaky
boot, the tranny is capable of delivering 500,000 miles of
service.  (When was the last time you changed your tranny's
lube?)

If you've dealt with hard shifting by replacing the stock gear
shift lever with an after-market shifter, you may have simply
masked a problem in your linkage.  Most after-market shifters
alter the leverage ratio, allowing less shift motion at a cost of
greater effort on the part of the driver.  But that greater
effort could also be scrubbing the life out of your bushings or
bending your shifter rod.  Before installing an after-market
shifter it would be wise to do a complete overhaul of the
linkage.  And when you overhaul the linkage, the odds are you'll
find you've no need for that expensive shifter :-)

                      Sermonette

It is the nature of parts that move to wear out but in a well
designed system, one provided with a comprehensive schedule of
periodic maintenace, the wear may progress at such a slow rate
that we will tend to forget reality:  If we use it, we are
wearing it out.

When we begin to take reliable service for granted we are
courting catastrophic failure.  The only thing we should take for
granted is periodic maintenance, and even them to question it
closely.  Volkswagen built their vehicles with many 'lifetime'
parts, such as the grommets in the shift linkage, for which they
provided no periodic maintenance nor recommended overhaul period. 
Having used up our vehicle's designed 'lifetime' we now have an
obligation to repair what we have worn out.
