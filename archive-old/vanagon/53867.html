&gt; Larry,
&gt; 
&gt; Your explanation of the effects of a dirty injector do not conform with the
&gt; symtoms that I am experiencing.  The motor starts up fine and runs well until
&gt; its hot.  Then the problems starts with black smoke, mis-firing, and no power. 
&gt; Then I turn if off, and then back on again and it runs fine for a short while
&gt; and then the problems starts up again.  Would a dirty injector contribute to
&gt; such behavior?
&gt; 
To me, this sounds more like an electrical/electronic problem, since 
the symptons disappear after a brief power off, then reappear soon 
after. Try checking all electrial connections, especially those from 
engine sensors, etc, leading to the ECU.
