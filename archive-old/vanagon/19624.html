So Sean O'Neil says:
&gt; Does plugging in to 120v disable the 12v system? The interior lights won't
&gt; work as long as I'm on shore power. Seems sort of silly to me. 

No, it should not inhibit the rest of the 12V system.  Does this happen
when you turn on the 12V power to the fridge?  Or does it happen when
you plug in the 110V?  This should help you track down where the problem
is.

&gt; A different but related question: What are the odds that the shore power is
&gt; charging the battery during plugin time? If it doesn't work that way is
&gt; there any way I can get it to? For some reason I have minor nightmares
&gt; about camping in some remote location, using battery for various things
&gt; and discovering that I don't have enough juice to get started again. It
&gt; would be reassuring to know that shore power=trickle charging so that I
&gt; can have a relatively clean conscience about battery upkeep. Wish I had
&gt; that dual battery, only drain one for camping, other for starting, kind of
&gt; setup.

The plug in will not charge your system.  It's only for the fridge and
the power outlets in the galley area.  The second isolated battery is
the best idea.  

Cheers!
