Subject: Still looking for a '71 Westy

Volks,

Hi y'all, I've been off list for awhile, very busy in the job world.

I'm still looking for a replacement for my smushed '71 Westy, haven't found
a single one in months.  I am considering getting a '68-'70 body and
swapping over the front end.  Can't believe all that work is out the door
though, I had just rebuilt both rear wheels, bearings and all.  

Still have the 2.0 liter exoto engine in the basement awaiting time for
assembly.  In the mean time I'm driving around the terribly smushed bus to
the amazement of all.  The old war horse engine is actually doing pretty well.  

I still have a 1600cc dual-port engine lying around in case anyones blown
theirs lately.

Eug,
smushed '71 Westy
