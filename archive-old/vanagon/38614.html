Subject: re New Westfalia Brochure

&gt;
&gt;I just received the new Westfalia catalog from Germany.  I sent them a letter
&gt;knowing I was in the market for a new Westfalia, and they sent me the new
&gt;catalog for the 1996 VW EV Westafalia along with many other conversions.
&gt;All of the text is in German, but there are some GREAT pictures.  Does anybody
&gt;know what the differences between the Westfalia EV Camper and the Winnebago
&gt;EV Camper are if any?  Thanks a lot
&gt;                                                  Jeff Layton
&gt;                                                    89 Westfalia

I recently saw pictures on some Web site of &quot;Der California&quot; and Der
Florida models. The surprising thing was that Der Florida sure looks like a
Vanagon!
But Der California is an EV with a fixed &quot;high&quot; top, not a pop top. Not
very attractive to me. Is this the one you have a brochure for, or is the
EuroVan CV with the pop top?

Its interesting that they would send you a Westfalia brochure, I wonder if
they're having thoughts about shipping them over here again?

In the past, from what I can tell from reading the manuals, some of the
differences include:
- locking struts on the poptop, as opposed to gas struts;
- curtains instead of pulldown pleated blinds;
- hinged  tables instead of ones that slide in and stow behind the driver;
- two auxiliary batteries instead of one;
- a &quot;Camper Central Electronic Display&quot; up above the mirror instead
  of simply level LEDs on the kitchen module; configuration options indicate
  that it could also come with a single aux battery;
- a different configuration for closets;
- storage under rear seat looks a bit different;
- the sink is on the right instead of the left;
- the Westie does not have a furnace

In other words, not a hell of a lot of difference. The Winnebago has a big
breaker panel in the rear; and has a lot of plastic inside lining around
the windows and such, but in overall configuration seems quite similar.
You can go to the vw web site and see the pictures of the current EV Camper
if you want to compare.

Hopefully you'll be posting some pictures from this brochure?
