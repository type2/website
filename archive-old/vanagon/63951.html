Steve,
You just described the symptoms of my 84 turbo diesel Jetta. I went round
and round with it for quite some time (replaced the oil pressure circuit
board, about 200 bucks) before I finally borrowed a pressure gauge and
hooked it up outside my hood so's I could see it while driving... What it
showed was there was nothing wrong. I'd replaced all the oil pressure
switches (the turbo uses different switches than the other engines). To
this day, it does the same thing after a long hard run. I just tap the gas
peddel and keep on going... Good Luck,
Bob Bellanca

&gt; Eric, using 20-50 wt, the water temp gauge read normal.Outside temp
&gt; wasn't too high today. I'm leaning towards a malfunctioning warning
&gt; unit.. Really hope it's not a bearing going out. Thanks for the
&gt; suggestion.
