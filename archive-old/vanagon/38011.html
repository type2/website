&gt;I'll probably opt to buy a lifetime warranteed rebuilt
&gt;unit just so I don't have to go through this again (in another 10
&gt;years...:) ).

Make sure you get it from the earlier-mentioned Reputable Rebuilder.
I just put the fourth power-steering pump in 3 years in my Mustang, all
under Kragen's  &quot;Lifetime Warranty&quot;. I've come to realize that, with
some shops, &quot;lifetime warranty&quot; means you'll spend the rest of your life
replacing the thing.  &lt;sigh&gt;
