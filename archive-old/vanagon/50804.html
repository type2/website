Subject: Primary Battery Removal:  How to?

I need to replace my primary battery underneath the passenger seat in my '87
Westy.

Trouble is, I can't get my hands or even a finger down inside the battery
compartment to get it out.  The battery just barely sits inside the comparment.
There is no handle on the battery, and nothing to grab on top but the posts.

Can anyone reccommend a neat trick to get the bugger out of there?  How about a
trick to make sure that it will be easy to get it out in a few years should I
need to replace it again?

Thanks in advance.
