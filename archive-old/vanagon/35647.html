Subject: Microfiche, Microfilm, I got yer reader!
Date: Mon, 19 Feb 1996 16:58:11 -0800 (PST)

Volks,
	I was wandering around the swap meet Saturday looking for some
playboys^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^Hsunglasses and came across a microfilm reader.
I instantly thought of the vanagon list and the need for something to
read microfilm.  Or is it MicroFiche?  I can't remember what form those
things Joel is giving out are in.  Anyway, the microFILM reader was $10,
but I didn't buy it because I had already spent all my money.  :)  I did
get the guy's card (runs a surplus store) and I called him today.  He
has one microfilm reader for $10 and about a dozen microFICHE readers
for $25-30 each.  He says they have the capability of printing too, but
he's not sure if that works or not.  If anyone is interested, his phone
# is 619-746-0712 and he is in Escondido, California.  Shipping is not
likely as these are kinda bulky.  Now you know as much about them as I
do...
