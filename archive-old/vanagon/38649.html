&gt;&gt; Hi, I'm Amy and I am now the proud owner of an engineless, rust-enhanced,
&gt;&gt; beautiful 1970 Westfalia.  Unfortunately, I don't know where to begin!  I
&gt;have
&gt;&gt; enough money saved up to buy an engine and put it in or do bodywork.  Does
&gt;it
&gt;&gt; make more sense to do one before the other?
&gt;
&gt;My $0.02 worth is get it on the road first.  Engine first, then body 
&gt;work.  If you do it th e other way around, you might have a 
&gt;prettier-looking bus, but you won't be able to do much more than look at it.
&gt;
&gt;Keep us up to date on your project, and have fun!

Here's my $.02 (US) worth.  I second what Tobin said.  If you start to spend
on it and all you can do is look at it, prety soon you'll get REAL
discouraged, sell it, and hate VWs for the rest of your life.
