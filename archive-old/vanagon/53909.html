&gt; The engine runs fine right after I start it back up.  Then the rough running
&gt; starts again, with black exhaust.  I am going to check out the O2 sensor,
&gt; coolant sensor, vacuum lines, and air mass sensor first.  I'll keep you posted,
&gt; after I do some tests.  Do you know where the coolant sensor is located.  I've
&gt; also had problems with bad connections, since the Vanagon has been setting for
&gt; over a year without being started.

&gt; Thanks,

 WEll from what you have talked about, I would say it has a bad wire 
to the temp. sensor. I have seen several wire breaks in the engine 
   compartment. It's a common problem.  
     
       I Posted this about 10 months ago.

       I had a very similar problem that the dealer could not fix!
       It was the middle of the winter and I didn't have a place out
       of the snow to work on it. So I thought a VWoA dealer was the 
       best thing. Man was I wrong. They wanted to put a computer in.
       6 weeks later after the snow was melting I fix it by replacing
       a wire. I simply traced out every wire in the engine compartment
       from the computer to the engine. Found the temperature sensor
       not making a connection. Pulled on the wire right there in the
       engine compartment where the engine rocks and found the break.
       I then replaced the entire wire to the computer. I haven't has 
       that problem since.
    
       Your symptoms sound just like mine. The only other thing I 
       know of that will can cause these symptoms is the O2 sensor. To
       check this just disconnect the single wire plug. This is a good 
       temperary check. Or a temerary fix to get you home.

                 let us know what you find
