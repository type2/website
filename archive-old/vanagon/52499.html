&gt; How's this for a new twist on the air bags.  As opposed to the passenger
&gt; side 'switch', there should be a sensor in the passenger seat to let the
&gt; puter know if someone large enough to benefit from the airbag is sitting
&gt; there.  For example, there must be 100 pounds or more sitting there for
&gt; the airbag to deploy in an accident.  This would be beneficial in two
&gt; ways.  1)  Small children, weighing under 100 lbs, would not set the
&gt; sensor off, so the bag would not deploy.  They would be protected from
&gt; the force of the airbag.  2)  The airbag would not needlessly deploy
&gt; when there is only a driver in the vehicle.  Do you know how expensive
&gt; it is to get the durn thing stuffed back in the dash?  If no one is
&gt; sitting there, it doesn't need to go off.  If a child is sitting there,
&gt; it shouldn't go off.  And an adult wouldn't get hurt because the
&gt; theoretical 'switch' was turned off.
&gt; 
&gt; I personally think that this is the best option.  The 100 lb mark was
&gt; purely theoretical.  I know some adults weigh less than this and some
&gt; children weigh more.  But, it seems like a good guess of an acceptable
&gt; mark.  I'll write my stupid government people.  Anybody else?
