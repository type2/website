&gt;Yes, once I took teh cooler lines inside and moountes a fan behind it. Worked
&gt;well but was always ON! Kinda kludge but if you took some time it could work.
&gt;Maybe have a electric bypass so you could turn it off.

R U talkin' about the fridge?  

With just a minute's worth of experimentation, I discovered I can piggy
back the fan on the existing switched circuit, so when the fridge is
working, the fan is working.  And they use screw connectors, so I don't
even have to hack anything!
