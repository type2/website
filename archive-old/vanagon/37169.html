Subject: '88 lurching at 2500-3000 rpm

Drove the new baby to work today - first time in some traffic - and 
noticed some lurching in 2nd &amp; 3rd gear at around 2500-3000 rpm. ie: 
trying maintain a steady speed in slow traffic would result in a 
surging or lurching motion. Accelerate to a little over 3000 &amp; it 
would mostly go away.
It seems to be related to part throttle power delivery - ie: 3/4 or 
more accel to 4000 in each gear is smooth, but a &quot;lazy&quot; foot with 1/2 
throttle or so causes a similar lurching during accel.

I have a new cap &amp; rotor which I have not tried yet, and plugs are new, but I'm 
wondering if anyone else has encountered this - it doesn't seem like 
an ignition thing to me, more like timing advance or fuel delivery. 
Any ideas?

Note: This is not the mystery power loss at speed problem (I don't 
think anyway) and the van has had the harness put on by a dealer a 
while back to fix that.

Shawn.
