Hey Ya'll

Glad to see the list back up!
I was wondering if anyone has ordered a rebuilt engine from GEX International
out of California?  A neighbor of mine put one in his bug and has put over
70,000 miles on it and it runs strong.  I have visited their website and have
their catalog and they seem to have a very good set up.  Has anyone ordered
one of the engines and if so did you ever have to test out their garantee.
 Before I lay down 2 grand I'd like some feedback. 
  By the by, I've have a 80 Vanagon Camper with the 2.0 aircooled engine.
 GEX offers either a 2.0 stock rebuilt or what they call a Power Master
series 2.0 with Mahl pistons and Cylinders, 44mm intake - 38mm exhaust valve
heads (oversized), Torque special cam,new hyd lifters,resurfaced flywheel,
steel push rods and new rod tubes for an extra 400 bucks.  Is it worth the
extra bread and what would the extra performance or life of this engine be?

If anyone has any input I would be grateful.

Carpediem,

Don
