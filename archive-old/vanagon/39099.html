I was always under the impression that a smaller circle would accelerate
faster, but would also decelerate more quickly.
 In the world of bicycle racing there are a few people that are putting 26&quot;
road wheels (versuses the 700X23C's) on their bikes for criterium racing,
saying it allows them to have a better jump in a sprint finish. 
Am I way off on this one?
