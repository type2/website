&gt; I've had my '71 Westfalia for about 4 years now, and drive it daily to
&gt; work; from Sedona to Flagstaff and back.  I work in a rather remote area,
&gt; and I really enjoy having my lunch in it, and taking in the spectacular
&gt; scenery.  I've also been able to sneak in a nap or to on the folded down
&gt; bed--it makes the rest of the day very pleasant!  
&gt; 
WHAT A LIFE! Sometime in August, think of me stuck in traffic
on the Superstition at 118 F. trying to get the last drop out
of the ol' sports bottle filled with ice chips while you're 
pleasantly coasting down the switchbacks on 89A with a cool breeze
off Oak Creek coming in the window.....ya bum!  ;-&gt;

&gt; I always carry some spare parts, lots of tools, tire chains, extra gasoline,
&gt; camping equipment, freeze-dried food, a backpack stove w/fuel, water, 
&gt; sleeping bag, extra clothes, etc, etc, etc....I could stay on the road for
&gt; several days, if I needed to (hopefully, I won't)!
&gt; 
Sounds like my days in Alaska -- the only survival gear I tend
to need nowdays is my gas can and my tow rope! :-&gt;

&gt; What advantage is there to having AZ vintage vehicle plates?  I've been 
&gt; considering this myself for some time (I still have CA plates on my cars,
&gt; even though I've been here several months).
&gt;
I doubt there is much advantage to it financially - they look
pretty cool. Also, you have to be over 25, so we've got a 
couple years yet.....

&gt; Hope you enjoy the list as much as I do!
&gt;
