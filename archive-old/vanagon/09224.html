Subject: Clutch slave cylinder rebuild/replace

	Thanks to whomever posted about honing/polishing the bore
of the cylinder when rebuilding- I COMPLETELY *forgot* that part!
There's no sense in fitting a new seal to a scored and worn cylinder. It'll
shred in a week or two and there you are again!!

	So remove your possibly bad slave cylinder, do like &lt;whomever&gt;
said and clean the outside to shinyness BEFORE you disassemble it, then 
disassemble, clean the inside and inspect. Make your rebuild/replace 
decision with the parts right there in your hand- no sense in buying the 
rebuild kit if the metal parts are beyond hope.

	What is that guck in the cylinder anyway? Its mostly water that
comes through or around the rubber seals, and dirt and bits of the seal
that wear off. In all hydraulic systems, water and crud get into the 
fluid down at the slave end. For example, water gets through any flexible
hose (such as at the wheels, and I assume a short length to the clutch
slave too).
