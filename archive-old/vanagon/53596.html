Subject: Re: carrying canoe on camper top

Re the canoe rack, been there, done that.  The best system is the Thule Super
High Feet with 65&quot; (or longer) inch bars.  It's a safe, rain gutter mount
system that can also accept bikes.  With the really long 78&quot; bars you can
mount the rack over the luggage rack AND pop the top with two bike on as they
can be placed near the end of the bars.  No holes to drill - utterly safe.
 Price:  about $150 complete.  
IMHO are notsafe IMHO.  I am a Thule, Mad River Canoe and Valley sea kayak
dealer and I've seen many boats damaged by people not using the proper rack -
especially on Westies with the wind issues to contend with.

Good luck
Craig Charles
