&gt; I just called and ordered a bottle. Costs $4.00 for an 8 ounce bottle
&gt; (aerosol or non-aerosol). If you use a credit card, they don't charge you
&gt; shipping!

How about shipping to Canada? Where are they located? This stuff 
sounds too good to be true! Even *with* the right tools I've had 
trouble removing some VW parts (starter bolts for one...)

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Last night, I found myself in the difficult predicament of having to
&gt; remove 
&gt; &gt; a Vanagon AC compressor, held on with an allen-head bolt, without the 
&gt; &gt; proper allen key.  All I had was a pair of vice grips, and the bolt head
&gt; is 
&gt; &gt; completely round, so they just kept slipping.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Then I tried a product that Kyle Wade turned me on to, called Kroil.  He 
&gt; &gt; swore it was like liquid wrench times ten. I put a couple of drops on the
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; bolt, and it practically slid off by itself.  Tried it on some other
&gt; tight 
&gt; &gt; bolts, same results.  
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I believe they sell direct (615-833-4101). Anyone else ever try this
&gt; stuff?
