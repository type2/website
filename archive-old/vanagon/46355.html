Subject: Re: List Split Announcement [IMPORTANT]

Ric said:
&gt; &gt; I appreciate the effort someone else is going to put into an aircooled van
&gt; &gt; list...however, I think that there has ALWAYS been something special on
this
&gt; &gt; list which transcends air v water v T1 vT2 v T3 v T4 vans, and I would hate
&gt; &gt; to see this disapear when the split window/loaf/early brick crowd has spun
&gt; &gt; off onto another list....

To which Steve responded:

&gt; I don't think this list will lose it's integrity as much as you think.
&gt; I believe that those that enjoy the comraderie and general 'family' feeling
&gt; of this list will log on to both.  And the rest will log on to the separate
&gt; list of their choice.

To which I must add:
ARGH! I've not even been back a day, and all this is going on! Geez, I can't
even leave you alone for a few weeks without you getting into trouble!
:)
But seriously, I would definately subscribe to both lists, mainly to stay in
touch with our glorious family. As a split window owner, a great deal of the
technical info doesn't really apply to me, but I just delete it and move on.
Whatever happens, hopefully, the family will survive. And as Ric mentioned, I
would have to make new t-shirt designs, but then that means *everybody* would
have to buy a new one, right???
