Subject: Sliding window gasket

Does anyone know if there is a way to replace the gasket or seal on the
sliding side windows short of removing the entire window from the van? 
My seals have deteriorated from UV exposure and leak, I bought new seals
before thinking about the actual job of relacing them.  Has anyone done
this job, of figured out how to do it?

Any advice would be appreciated.
