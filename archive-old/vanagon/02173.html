Steve!  You think that &quot;being in the kind of vehicles we are in
kind of limits us to doing too many crazy things?&quot;  !!!???  :)

Look at the grateful deadheads.  Look at Ken Kesey.  Look at
the &quot;reputation&quot; of VW buses - the bumperstickers:
     &quot;If this van's a rockin,' don't come-a-knockin'!
            or
     Don't laugh - your daughter might be in here! 

If these don't suggest some great craziness, it would be hard to
find another car that would do so any better!!   :)
