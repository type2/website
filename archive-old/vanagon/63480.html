good to hear from you, Bill!!!

Sounds like your sensor may now be  : (.  Test it by turning seeing if the
little spade carries to ground when the motor is off, and does NOT carry to
ground when the motor is running. OR just replace it, cheap and easy.  Also,
check the bulb... I've replaced a few over the years.
