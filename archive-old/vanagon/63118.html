&lt;&lt; We just took delivery of our (new to us) '86 GL and we would like to have
it
 detailed inside and out.  We have never had this done before------ is there
 any guidance anyone can give us on selecting a detailer.  Are there any
 questions we should specifically ask when contacting a shop?

          Hi, Janet, I assume you cannot clean your Van yourselves due to
lack of time (personally love cleaning my cars, make me feel like they run
better afterwards  :&lt;)
But if you do select a professional shop, make sure they have insurance...
a friend of mine had his classic American car detailed at a shop, and the
person doing the high speed buffing was a novice, and burned the paint w/ the
buffer.
He took them to court, and it was a mess...
Also, be wary of pressure washing the engine...
this has been known in some cases to cause electrical problems..

good luck, and remember, a clean VW is a happy VW  :&lt;)
