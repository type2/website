Subject: Re: throttle bodies - older motor with 85 tb?? 

&gt; The first question I have is about the throttle body.  On mine there is ONE
&gt; switch for idle and wide open.  The engine now, has two switches, one for
&gt; each. Can these switches hook up to the same wire as mine?

Digijet changed in '85 perhaps twice, from open and full throttle 
switches to just one, then my late '85 is switchless period.  Change 
the throttle body, and ask about where the vacuum lines should go for 
a configuration as your origional one.  The changes are somewhat 
detailed in Bentley though I can not find my no switch configuration 
detailed.  Mine is a very late '85 build.
