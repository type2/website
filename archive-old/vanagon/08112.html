&gt;It looks like my '76 Westfalia is going to need to have the engine rebuilt.
&gt; Does anyone know if it's worth having hydrolic(sp?) valve lifters
&gt;installed.  It costs more, but does it make the engine last longer, require
&gt;less maintanence or anything like that?  Or should I just go with the
&gt;original specs.   Are there any other modifications I can do at this tme to
&gt;make a better engine?

well ... hydraulic valves DO make life easier on you, the mechanic/driver. :)
but there are some DISadvantages to them (nothing really serious):
- you tend to forget about the engine (cause you don't have to crawl around
    underneath to set the valves). so 'things' can go longer before you
    notice that something is broken/needs-fixing.
- because you no longer adjust the valves, you forget about the valve cover
    gaskets ... and they tend to dry out after about 6000 miles or so. and
    start leaking. you'll have to remind yourself to replace the gaskets every
    so often to keep the leaks from starting.
- when the engine is cold, especially if the bus was parked on a sideways
    lean, the lifters can make quite a racket when the engine is first
    started. this goes away in a few seconds but it is scary until you get
    used to it.
on the up side,
- you never have to get dirty adjusting the valves again.
- the valves are ALWAYS adjusted, so the engine doesn't have the problem of
    misadjusted valves.

just a question: have you considered maybe just replacing the engine with a
later 78-79 engine, that already has the hydraulic lifters (and is a tiny
bit bigger in size)? :)

other suggestions: since it's a camper, maybe an external oil cooler? they
make some kits that attach really easy (a little adapter plate that fits
in place of the oil filter). it would help keep the oil temp down a bit,
especially in summer. and you can get a thermostatic return valve to fit
into the oil hoses (to the cooler) that allows the oil to just return to the
engine in cool weather (so it doesn't use the cooler and get too cold).
