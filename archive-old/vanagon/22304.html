Glad to hear about another BarlLeak success. I was feeling like the
lone ranger!  Not sure what to tell ya about the water leak though.

P.S. You have one adventurous wife!

   BARSLEAK SUCCESS
    This van has 170k mile on it and had just started having the heads leak in
the last couple of months. it was losing quite a bit of coolant(400-500 ml a
week).i was more than a bit apprensive about sending them out with such a
potential problem, but i  bled the cooling system before they left and added
barsleak. amazing!! the leaks are almost completely dried up and they've only
lost a tiny bit of coolant driving from san francisco to la, through and
around arizona and new mexico(HOT!!), to texas, then north, and they're now at
mt. rushmore. yellowstone is next, then salt lake city, and then back home.
the van has given them absolutely no trouble except the soggy seat problem,
which probably is not the van's fault.
Thanks for any input and wave if you see them - gold '87 vanagon.
