Subject: need parts will trade

Hi All,
I have a 1990 GL and I need a few parts and I have extra parts that I
will trade. I will pay cash for the parts if you don't want to trade.
I need a rear fiberglass bumper and the right side bumper extension, the
side moulding behind the right rear wheel. I also need the front lower
grill.
I have a wrecked 90 GL with many parts and specifically I have 2 new
chrome front bumpers; both the left and right side fiberglass front
mouldings that match the front fiberglass bumper. They fit on the front
doors.
Thanks           Jay L Delozier

PS I live in the Harrisburg Pennsylvania area.
