&gt; as far as i know, the campers were referred to as Campmobile or just Campers.
&gt; i had never heard them referred to as &quot;Westy's&quot; before this list or LiMBO.
&gt; and i've never heard a salesperson refer to them as anything but Campers.
&gt; but they were all made by Westfalia. in europe, i think they were called
&gt; Wohnmobile or Wohnwagen.

I have the original owners documentation--It is officially known (at least
in '71) as a 'Campmobile'.
