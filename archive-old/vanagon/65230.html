Yes,
They have a bathroom w/shower and a microwave (I think) , at least my son's
inlaws does and they are going to be selling theirs.  One very large
drawback, you can't stand up in them.  He is 5'-10&quot; tall and he has to bend
his head, no pop top!

&gt; I've seen a couple of real live motor homes based on the EV chassis.
These
&gt; are called Rialtas.  Anybody know anything about them, who makes them,
how
&gt; much they go for?   Though small for a typical motor home they are much
&gt; larger than a EV Winnebago camper.  Probably a bathroom and microwave in
&gt; there somewhere but I haven't gotten a peek inside yet.
