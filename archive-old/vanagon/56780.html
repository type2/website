Subject: Re: Crazy Oil leak-86 2.1 L Syncro

Check the seal around the oil heat exchanger.    It's at the real drivers
side, near the water pump, right under the oil filter.   I had the seal
(square-section  o-ring) blow out after a very cold night with too-thick
oil.    Best case, the heat exchanger body is only loose.     If that's the
leaking area, first try taking the oil filter off and tightening the nut
inside that holds the filter seat and heat exchanger on.

&gt;My 86 Syncro developed a new and unusual problem recently.  While running
&gt;(only while running) oil streams out from the rear of the engine (close to
&gt;the bumper)  It seems to be flow according to the speed of the engine.  I
&gt;know that my rear oil seal is bad, it always leaks oil.  I usually just
&gt;check the oil level and copmpensate accordingly, but this problem is
&gt;strange.  Could this be the same seal accelerated to drastic proportions??
&gt;Or, is it something else?
&gt;
&gt;I'm getting nervious, this van is supposed to take me back to work in only
&gt;1.5 months, I'd hate to fly.  If it can't make the journey around the city
&gt;of Minneapolis it certainly can't make it to Denail Alaska.
