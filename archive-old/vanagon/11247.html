&gt; i would also like to put an additional 12 volt deep cycle battery in my
&gt; buses (65' and 73' both 12 volt) so that i can run my accessories without
&gt; killing my startup battery. Has anybody performed this (what i hope is)
&gt; reasonably staightforward operation. If so i would like to hear about it
&gt; too.

Okay, I'll talk if you promise to truncate quoted material in your posts. :) :-)
Actually, it's really easy with the 73 (not sure about the 65).  I put
two large deep-cycle batteries to the left of the engine, opposite the
normal battery, and separated them from the normal battery with an RV
battery switchamabooblethingey which looks like a standard starter solenoid 
(SSS), but has a metal case and is a continuous-duty unit unlike the SSS.
The solenoid is actuated via a wire run to the front of the bus and
hooked to the ignition switch so that it is only on when the bus is
running, not when off or starting.  Once that is done, just attach your
accessories directly to the aux. batteries, and you are good to go.  Oh,
a voltmeter is helpful to monitor the condition of the extra batteries.
Remember, fully charged should get you around 12.7 volts, and when you
get near 12 volts you know the end is near - don't drain the batteries
any further (or they will die prematurely).  Preferably use a digital
voltmeter, and if anyone can tell me where I can find a digital voltmeter
that fits a standard gauge mount (2-1/4&quot; or whatever it is) I will, uh,
ummm... I'll shake yer hand prodidgeously and punch ya in the arm he-man
style.  Oh, JC witless has the digital voltmeters but they are expensive
even before you include the shipping charge.  
Oh, the solenoid is avaliable at Camping World for under $10.  Look next
to the battery isolaters (but don't buy the isolator!!).
Cheers,
