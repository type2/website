Subject: Re: much as i hate to admit it ...

Grovel you Son of a Bitch...I was right all a long....go ahead Joel, say it again so 
EVERYONE can hear...

&gt; Ric, and the other EuroVanners were right...EuorVans are the BEST thing since the 
Porsche 911...or at least since sliced white bread!

&gt; Yep...EUROVAN...no longer worthy of defending as Joel put it the other day when I 
called myself the defender of EuroVans...

The rest of you EuroVanners, while Joel is grovelling...start singing &quot;We are the 
champions my friends....&quot;

WAIT...that sound too much like the end of Revenge of the Nerds (the movie)...we are 
definately NOT Nerds...

Hmmm...(in my best singing voice)...EuroVan, EuoVan Uber Alles...

Today Car &amp; Driver....tomorrow VW T&amp;A...oops Trends...

Yep...sano custom EuroVans on the cover of VW T&amp;A with Big breasted blonde 
bitchin' bikini bimbo babes ...  aliteration....hell I'm a litterary genious!!

Seriously, however, its nice to see the EV getting the recognition it deserves.....I WAS 
RIGHT!!!!!!!!!   :-)
