Subject: ?motor deal

hi volks

have a question 

found a motor head to head with alt. for 100.00 smackers. person said it ran
great before the van was totalled (front end). its been sitting on the
concrete floor for 2 years. it wont spin by hand we will be taking tools the
next time we stop over to the guys house. is there anything special i should
look for as far as problems? i mainly deal with air cooled motors for my
type 1-2-3 but this monster is a bit different. and if the heads are good
i.e. crackless than i was planning on replaceing intake and exhaust valves
and guides install new head gaskets and such and be on my way.

reason i ask is my 86 vanagon (i.e.terrorist bus) with a mere 160k miles
seems to have a problem with compression. say 120,121,147,168psi per cyl. i
say she is just getting broken in. good thing is she burns no oil. heads do
not leak external but believe theyre leaking internal. i loose power after
warm up.
is there anything that i should know before starting this fun project?

any input would be greatly appreciated
thanks Jonce
