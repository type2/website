 &gt; Since I seem to be in the minority (hey, I have orange hair; can't help
 &gt; it), I thought I'd share some more info on sources for the 12-points. Bob
 &gt; Hoover, in a direct reponse, noted that JCW sells a kit of 6, 8, 10 &amp; 12mm
 &gt; 12-pointers for about ten bucks.
 
Everyone can make their own choices, of course, but I've developed a profound 
mistrust of cheap tools over the years.  Too many times I've bought a cheap 
tool &quot;because I'll only need it once&quot;, had it break while lying on my back 
under the car or with my arm deep in the bowels of the vanagon's engine 
compartment and gash open my knuckles and then had stop the whole project to 
go and buy the expensive one ANYWAY.

Me, I just don't buy cheap tools anymore.  I can't afford them.
