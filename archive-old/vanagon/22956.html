&gt; Forgive me, but I have a minor quibble -- if the bus has had its height 
&gt; shortened by taking a slice out of it horizontally so that the roof is 
&gt; closer to the floorboards, it's been &quot;chopped&quot;.  If it had its length 
&gt; shortened by taking a slice out vertically so that the front bumper is 
&gt; closer to the back bumper, it's been &quot;sectioned&quot;. If it had its height 
&gt; shortened by having the body lowered on the frame so that the frame is 
&gt; the same distance from the pavement but the lower edge of the body is 
&gt; closer to the pavement, it's been &quot;channelled&quot;.  If it had its length 
&gt; shortened by pushing the whole vehicle at high speed against a large 
&gt; object, it's been &quot;crashed&quot;.

And if one diagonal has been shortened and the other lengthened by
being flung through a deep space wormhole at an angle, it's been
&quot;warped.&quot;
