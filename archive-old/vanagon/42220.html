&gt;Okay, I'm working on my '66 Westy which hasn't been driven in 13 years.
&gt;I'm replacing the axle boots because they're crumbly and one is actually
&gt;leaking oil.  I have both of the new boots and I'm wondering if I should
&gt;drain the oil completely and then refill the tranny with new oil.  My
&gt;manual says to use SAE 90 hypoid oil.  First of all, is this something I
&gt;can get at my FLAPS? and secondly, can I refill it myself?  The engine is
&gt;out right now so I can probably get to the fill plug from above.  All of
&gt;the pictures I've ever seen about this have a funky filler pipe thingy
&gt;that looks very professional (i.e. VW extra-super-duper-once-in-a-lifetime
&gt;tool #whatever).

Go to your FLAPS, and purchase an oil suction gun (~$10). This tool looks
sort of like a grease gun, but is made for fluids. Then you fill the gun
with 80W90 hyploid oil, crawl underneath, and squirt the oil into the
tranny. It should take about 6 gun's worth of fluid before the tranny is
full - make sure you don't overfill it. It's much easier if you have a
helper filling the gun for you (been there, done that). At least you will be
able to crawl under your vehicle without too much trouble. I changed the
tranny oil in my bug - reminded me of doing the limbo...
