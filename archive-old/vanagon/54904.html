Subject: RE: Temperature needle low: thermostat or sensor?

I did have a problem with my temp indicator, sometimes I never even saw the
needle, sometimes it barely clumb to the white block. I replaced the
sensor. No luck. I pulled the dashboard to check the wiring, and found that
a connector &quot;finger&quot; had been bent by some (other) weekend mechanic. I
fixed that, and lo and behold, the temperature indicator started to behave,
_and_ the battery stopped going flat in two weeks. There was some weird
kind of back-current running.
