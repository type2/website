Subject:      installing a vented catalytic heater (L)

In response to a couple of inquiries, I'll post this to the entire list. =

After agonizing over various types of heaters, such as the Suburban and t=
he
Propex, I opted for a  VENTED catalytic heater from Thermal Systems in
Tumwater, WA.  I hated giving up the space under the rear seat or a
cabinet.  Relocating all the stuff stored in those places would have
required a box taking up considerably more floor space than the box I bui=
lt
to hold the heater.  If my memory is correct, the box the heater fits in =
is
about 29x14x3 inches-tall, but taking up little floor space.  I put it
behind the front passenger seat at a 45 degree angle, roughly facing a
person sitting at the left end of the rear seat. After covering it with
gray formica to match the rest of the interior, it fits in nicely without=

looking out of place. Putting it at a 45 degree angle also makes it
possible to turn the front passenger seat almost all the way around.  The=

top of the box then makes a handy small table for a person using the fron=
t
passenger seat facing rearwards.  I should mount a cup holder there, but
haven't done so.

The manufacturer's address and phone number:

Thermal Systems Incorporated       =

2757 29th Street S.W.               =

Tumwater, WA  98502 =

360-352-0539      =


Venting is also very easy with this installation, requiring only a 1 1/2
in. hole through the raised area under the passenger seat (r. of the
battery box) into the wheelwell.  The rubber hose provided with the heate=
r
reaches through and past the wheelwell edge to vent nicely.  I ran the
propane line from a tee on the propane tank, under the gas tank plate,
through the wheelwell wall to the heater.  This type of heater draws 1 am=
p
and so far I've gotten away without an aux. battery, although I will
probably install one eventually.  By removing one bolt, unplugging the
thermostat and power wires, and capping the propane line, I can remove it=
 ,
box and all as a unit, in about five minutes, although I seldom do.  I've=

used it a lot and am very happy with the heat it produces and also with i=
ts
miserly propane and electricity use.

I ran the thermostat wire around the edge of the cabin and installed the
thermostat on the wall of the closet.  =


I'm pretty happy with this arrangement.  It has both advantages and
disadvantages compared to the underseat Propex, which is also a very nice=

solution and is discussed at length in the archives.  Anyone desiring a
completely out-of-sight solution should go with furnace-type heaters like=

the Propex or Suburban.  I think the vented catalytic heaters are cheaper=
-
about $330 for the 6000-btu size- and a bit easier to install.  =
