Subject: Re: stripes

&gt; 	My striping along the side of my 84 is getting a little old and is
&gt; starting to peel up and become brittle.  Consequently, when it peels up
&gt; and becomes brittle, it also chips off and looks bad.  Has anyone here
&gt; removed their stripping and replaced it?  I'm worried about cost so I
&gt; might just remove it and replace the stripes later.  I removed the stripes
&gt; on an old rabbit I had and it took me forever to remove all the gunk that
&gt; held the stripes on.  If someone knows of a better way it will undoubtably
&gt; save me buckets o' time.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt;

Alan,
I've had good luck removing stickers, duct tape and pin striping with
WD-40.  You could also use kerosene (parafin to you Brits).  That is pretty
much what WD-40 is.
