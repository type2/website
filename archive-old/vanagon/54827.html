Subject: leaky rings '85 wb

I took the Duckmobile to an independant garage yesterday to have the
situation diagnosed (no charge for diagnosis :-))
It seems the engine is blowing oil through the piston rings, causing smoke
sometimes, decreased gas milage, and 1qt/500mi oil consumption.
Their suggestions:
	-replace engine with a factory rebuild which they have in stock
	for $3000
	-full ring/gasket replacement for around $2000
	-keep on driving (I highly doubt it will pass emissions, for which
	it is overdue)

Does the $3000 for the rebuilt seem high?  I have never bought an engine
before.  Does anyone know of a good replacement engine in the NY, CT area.
I'm thinking of replacing the engine, and fixing up the old one myself.  
After reading the head gasket posting on the FAQ, am I to believe that I
can get VWoA to pay for the work, with enough prodding?

TIA 
Mark
