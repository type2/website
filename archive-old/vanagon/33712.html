Subject: Re: cleaning greasy/grimy parts ...

I used a lot of paint thinner (the cheap by-the-gallon kind) to clean
engine parts...with toothbrushes and paintbrushes. Cleaning the tin was
the real chore. Lots of soapy water (the warmer, the better) in a kiddy
pool in the back yard. And LOTS AND LOTS of elbow grease. It's not the
quickest method, but it's friendly and cheap (the pool cost us $2 and now
I have a permanent tin-washing pool). 

Also used plastic putty knife to scrape off caked on junk. Tried some 
Gunk I already had, but that was next to useless.
