Subject: Re:Help with syncro driveshaft?

Mario asked about replacing the u-joint in his '87 Syncro.

I posted some info a few weeks ago about this issue, since it happened
to my friend Larry's '87 too.  Thanks to everybody who responded to that
original post.

Larry got lucky: he ordered a new u-joint (two in fact, only the rear
was hosed but he replaced the front as well) from the DriveLine folks in
Oregon (about $25 each), and when installed it worked great the first
time, with no balancing required.  

Larry was very careful to mark the original orientation of the
transmission output shaft, the drive shaft, and the final drive input
shaft and to reinstall with that orientation; if you believe your
mechanic might not have maintained that alignment, you might try the 4
possible (actually, 16) orientations between those 3 components. (Uh,
come to think of it, multiply that number by 4 again since the yoke can
be installed on the driveshaft 4 different ways...)  

A good driveline shop *can* balance a Syncro driveshaft, so it's
definitely worth looking for one.  However, last year Dan Williams
(SkiDooer_at_aol_dot_com) lost his u-joints and went through grief as he 1)
installed new ones, then pulled them out since there was still some
slight vibration, 2) put in yet another set AND had the shaft
&quot;balanced&quot;, 3) pulled the shaft off again since the vibration was even
worse and 4) finally got a new driveshaft, for about $500, I think, from
Parr VW in WA. His report was that he was now a &quot;happy camper&quot;, since
all the vibration completely dissappeared.

BTW, you can drive your Syncro in 2WD indefinitely with the shaft
removed (also a viable emergency towing configuration.)  Good luck!
