Subject:       '57 Tranny trauma!

Hello good friends!

One quick question on my '57 before I get under it this weekend.

I think my transmission is loose, as the back hops up and down when I 
let off of the gas and am slowing down.  (It looks rather wierd when 
it does it.)  I can also feel the stick shift move around a little 
when this is happenening.

I suspect that the transmission is loose from the frame in the front.

How does it attach to the frame in the front?  I only remember seeing 
some big rubber looking block that was split in half between the 
frame and front of the tranny.

Are there any obvious bolts that typically fall out?

Oh, BTW, thanks to all that have visited my little website and seen 
the old Deluxe.  You all know, she doesn't have a name yet....

So what shall I call her?  I would call her &quot;The Pumpkin&quot; but I used 
that on a '77 Datsun Orange 810 Wagon we used to have...

Thanks!
