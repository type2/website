Subject: Additives


Hey

I was just over at the vintagvw list and there was a short discussion about 
the type of oil used with various opinions attached.  I have used Castrol HD 
30 always and a one time treatment of Slick 50.  Once I used one of those oil 
thickeners, Honey oil as I recall, without any ill effects.  In previous H2O 
cooled engines (Honda, Datsun, GM) i've never had any problems with 
additives.  Of course I am keen enough not to put a deposit removal additive 
in an engine that is has oil burning/leaking troubles.  Those deposits might 
be the only thing holding the majority of the oil in.   My question is what 
are your opinions!, specifically about oil thickners that quiet lifters and 
reduce oil loss. 


JOHN 70 bus and looking after a friends  78 camper.

ps my bus burns oil just fine it is the 78 i'm worried about and may detail 
at a later date ---we shall see.
