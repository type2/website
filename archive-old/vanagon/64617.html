Brent,

I just recently had my rack replaced because it had leaked fluid from the
pistons(bad seal) but the problem is still not fixed, repair shop has put
in 2 rebuilt racks, both of which leaked, the latest only hours after
getting the van back, fluid drained from the input shaft connection where
the steering column connects. the rack rebuilder asked if my pressure was
checked? I had no idea that the rack needed approx. 1200lbs pressure in the
system to drive power steering!, there is a valve in the ps pump that is
supposed to regulate this pressure, and am exploring getting the valve
replaced. the seal at the input shaft my also have to be replaced, if
anything it has shown me the value of a warranty on a rebuilt part. (but
hey they charged me $630.00 can originally)

Racks are available for less money and was desperate, worked out ok, the
shop didn't charge me anything to replace the second time.

My shop that repairs the van does not have the pressure gauge to check
anyone know of a work around to test the power steering pressure?

&gt; I recently got my 87 Westy Syncro realigned and the mechanic told me I
&gt; needed a new Rack and Pinion. I don't have the $700 required to fix it.
&gt; What happens if I don't get it repaired?
&gt; Thank you in advance,
&gt; Brent Gardner
&gt;
&gt; P.S. Does anyone know of any good Vanagon mechanics in Eugene, Oregon?
