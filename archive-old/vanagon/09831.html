Subject: RE: East Coast Location and the choo choo train

Richard:

&quot;Choo choo train&quot; is one of the nicer more civil things the local bus club has 
been called when we meet at a local city park!  The police circle constantly; I 
guess they figure with so many &quot;hippie vans&quot; and so many Willie Nelson 
lookalikes, somebody must be using some sort of mind altering chemical 
substance.

In any event, I shall consult the atlas and my database of VW shops and see if I 
can attend.  I am also willing to help with planning as much as I can.  Looks to 
be about 400 or so miles.
Skip
