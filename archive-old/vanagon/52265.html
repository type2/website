Subject: Door locks

Does anyone out here have power door locks? If so, how is the wire to the
sliding door routed? I am installing  an aftermarket kit and am stumped at
how to do a sano installation, all the other doors have hinges so this is not
a problem. Is there slack in the wire when the door is open or ?

Thanks
