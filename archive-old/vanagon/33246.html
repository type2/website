&quot;But, the $64,000 question: Does this kit have an at-sign (_at_) for email
addresses such as vanagon_at_lenti???&quot;

I just checked the leftover from my kit.  No, it doesn't include the &quot;_at_,&quot;
but this would be easy to &quot;paint&quot; on, using a metallic silver felt-tip
pen, which would just about match the color of the letters.
