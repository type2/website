Thanks for the info. I'm going to try and check out an 85 camper at some 
place in New Hampshire. Power's Motors in Hampton. It's a full camper and 
supposedly a real beaut. He's asking $8990 though, which seems a bit pricey 
for an '85 (book value about $5200). I'll check it out anyways.

My friends have a '77 Westie (which inspired me to begin this quest for the 
ultimate VW) and they have a bike rack which connects to the trailer hitch. 
I guess it's pretty secure. I don't know the manufacturer off hand but can 
get the info if anyone wants.
