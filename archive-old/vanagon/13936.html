Over here, a type 2 guru called Alan Schofield makes a set of weld in
strips that run the length of the screen base and a couple of inches
up the piller. So you basically replace the bits that always seem 
to rust. 

If that seems a bit like major surgery, I've seen at least
two busses that have had the area rebuilt using fibreglass and 
aluminium mesh. This method is fairly easy and gives good results,
but if the `lip' is rusted out and rebuilt this way, it will probably
crack when trying to put the screen back in.
