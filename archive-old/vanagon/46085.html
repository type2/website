Subject:  Re: Auxillary Bladder 

&gt;Part of my preparation for the Inuvik run was to design,
&gt;fabricate and install a pair of 15 gallon saddle tanks for my 1965
&gt;Microbus.  I also replaced my stock 10.7 gallon fuel tank
&gt;with one from a 1972 breadloaf, upping my total fuel capacity
&gt;to about 45 gallons.
Well at least you can use the whle drum when you buy one;-)

&gt;When I've moved the nail four times I've
&gt;transfered between twenty and twenty-five gallons of fuel -- and
&gt;have been driving all day.  If I keep the speed under 50 mph I
&gt;have an unrefueled range of about 1,200 miles.

All I can say, is your bladder is a lot bigger than mine!

Also I think you will find gas is pretty reasonable available every 200
miles or so. The furthest I've ever seen with no gas (or anything for that 
matter) is 165 miles, and that is considerd a long stretch. 
Of course that isn't in the arctic.
