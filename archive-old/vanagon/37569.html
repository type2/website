 &gt; If anyone has not yet purchased the Bently book I can't say enough good 
 &gt; things about it.  I put it off because of the price, but recently got it.  
 &gt; It is the best book. 

Hear hear!  If you have trouble justifying the price think of it as an 
important tool you just have to have, because a really good manual is the best 
tool you can have.
