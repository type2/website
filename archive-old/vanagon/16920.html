Subject: VW Sighting, what was it?

Last night my wife and I were returning from an errand in the '83 Vanagon
camper. Ahead of us was a '80s vintage (redundant?) Vanagon model camper
with what appeared to be a non poptop fiberglass top that had to be two feet
taller than the standard Vanagon Westy top. The top was the same outside
texture of the std Westy top- not the smooth surface of the bubble
window/bubble top vans of the '70s (ugh). I followed the camper into the
neighborhood hoping to ask the origin of the tidy awning hanging on the
side. (I'm still looking for one). 
My intentions were quickly thwarted when the Vanagon decided it was &quot;being
followed&quot; and kept driving and driving... I figured that the van (bearing
California blue and yellow plates) was threatened and possibly worried of
being &quot;'jacked&quot; so I gave up before the situation turned into an old
Keystone Cop episode. If he didn't want to talk (or wave!) then let it go...

Does anybody have any insight as to what it was, what conversion it was, and
where I could get a tidy looking awning for the '83 Westy that doesn't
require the substructure of the Brookln bridge to support it? The size I saw
last night looked to be slightly larger than the movie screens in our old
elementary school classrooms, without massive holes drilled into the body
and was the length of the bus minus the front door. It did not appear to
have any awning arms hanging down the side of the bus and attaching to any
mounting brackets.
