Fascinating story about your FI travails!  My '89 Syncro has not yet 
experienced the intermittent cutout problem you described, but I've only 
had it a couple of months and it may not yet have appeared.  I *have* had 
intermittent missing that  was clearly due to bad gas (see the thread 
Techron Saved My Tush.)  The Bosch FI system seems very sensitive to the 
quality of the gasoline.

It seems that there are still at least 2 competing theories for the cause 
of the intermittent cutout problem: 

1) Bad circuit connections (ie cold solder joints on power resistors) in 
the Brain.  This was the theory promulgated by Don Lancaster in his 
Electronics Now article from Jan 1995, and which seems to match your fix 
and the observed condition of your ECU.

2) The air flow meter oscillation problem which is cured with the 
addition of a filter capacitor on the wiring harness.  This theory (See 
Tech Bulletin 92-02) is promoted by VW, who has a harness adaptor (VW 
Part No. 025 906 302, $100) to fix the problem.  I have heard from 
Vanagon owners for whom this fix did nothing - on the other hand, a new 
list member from Sweden, Lars Herrnsdorf (100340.2265_at_compuserve_dot_com) 
said this harness fix completely cured his problem!

This suggests that there are at least 2 independent problems with a 
common symptom, which is that the ECU basically throws up its hands and 
refuses to deliver fuel to the engine (how many different problems will 
cause your *PC* to just crash?).  It would be nice if there was a way to 
distinguish these various problems by the symptoms, but the symptoms seem 
to be identical.  Popping the harness adaptor on your airflow meter would 
have been a cheap first try (presumably you didn't know about that fix), 
and being able to swap a known good ECU into your van long ago would have 
saved you alot of grief (though you still had to cough up for a new Brain 
eventually...).

I think the ability to swap-in known good parts would be a powerful 
debugging aid for intermittent problems in the Bosch FI system, but of 
course the problem is that you can rarely get anyone to loan you *any* 
electrical part to install in an automobile.  

I for one would be willing to kick $100 into a pool for vanagon_at_lenti 
subscribers so that we could buy at least one of each of these expensive 
Bosch parts as swap units to help diagnose our (common, it seems) 
problems with late model Vanagon FI systems. Ten of us coughing up $1000 
might cover the major stuff.  We could UPS them around to each other as 
needed (Hmm...too bad you can't email a throttle switch...), and when not 
in use by any member we might designate a physical repository for them 
(Joel?).  If someone found that the swapped-in part worked for them, they 
would keep it and buy another known good part to recycle back into the 
repository, keeping our stock &quot;fresh&quot;.

What say ye, fellow FI victims?  Is this utopian pie-in-the-sky, or could 
such a scheme be viable?  Does anyone know any precedent for such a parts 
cop-op?
