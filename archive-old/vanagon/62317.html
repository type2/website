Subject: need help w/ wiring harness problem ? / loss of power

It's the holiday weekend and where else would a good vanagon owner 
be but working on the van?  &lt;g&gt; 


I had spitzen sparken on the aux battery circut several weeks ago.  
disconnected aux battery, 
 Had the van in to be tuned up / Emissions 
check and failed. timing, afm etc all check out ok. 
got a waiver on the emissions.  
van runs like doody since the spitzen sparken , no power, rough, now 
won't even start. Tried the local dealer, what a joke. I checked the 
archives and ran into the wiring harness fix. so I beghan to check 
mine out. I had 4 ohms resistance between the ecu and the idle 
stabilizer, 2 ohms between the ecu and fuel pump relay. All other 
values 0 . Is 4 ohms enough resistance to cause the problems here? 
should I look closer at the fuel delivery system? 

Also this is a replacement engine where do I look for the id # I 
can't seem to find the crankcase ventilator. 

Thanks 
Steve
