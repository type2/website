Subject: [Syncro/all]  PS pump winch

Ok, another camping item to rival Marthas collection.  A 9000 lb. capacity 
hydraulic winch that operates off the PS pump.  Now you can camp in a tree, 
just haul yourself up!  Good for clearing parking spaces too.  Looks neat, 
see Elaine at:

I asked for info and they sent their $5 video along. See bubba covered in 
mud.  Price is about same as electric of same power, $600, but without the 
overheating/dead 2nd. battery problems.
