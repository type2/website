 Howdy all, as of this Saturday, my family is flying to Albuquerque NM
to rent one of Tom Brouilette's Vanagon Westy's. I'm not sure what year
it will be, but I do believe it is water cooled...
We'll be there for almost two weeks, driving about Utah and other such
exciting places, so I'll post a full report when I return. 
Anyway, I look forward to lotsa fahrvergnugening, even though it will be
water-cooled, :) and returning to 2000 or so happy messages.
Oh, thanks for all who offered words of wisdom on body work for my
Deluxe...
Richard
