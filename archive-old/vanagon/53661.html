Hi,

I forgot to mention that I did originally have 20W50 oil in there when
the buzzer &amp; oil pressure light came on.  The oil definitely felt
'thin' to the touch, as well as smelling of gasoline.

As to why there are two sensors, I guess VW engineers work in strange
and wondoreous ways...

 &gt; Hi there,

 &gt; I have experience problems with my oil light and buzzer coming on while driving
 &gt; my 86 Vanagon Syncro, and I've concluded that it was because I was using too
 &gt; thin oil for the temperature outside.  When I use 20-40 it rarely happens.
