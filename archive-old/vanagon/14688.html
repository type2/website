Here in California, all busses since 75 (or is it 76?) have them,
so it is certainly feasible!  If it is convenient for you to do
so, then go for it, since we all have to use unleaded now anyway!
I'm not sure that it is because of catalytic convertere (I suspect
it is) but lately I have noticed that every time I smell exhaust
fumes when driving, I look up and there is a really old car or
truck (obviously without catalyst) close in front of me.  I can't
quite remember, but it must have been horrible driving in traffic when
*all* cars were without catalytic converters!
