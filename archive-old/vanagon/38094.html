Subject: Re: WTB 68-71 Crew Cab

All,

Thanks for the responses to my post &quot;WTB 68-71 crew cab&quot;. Tom Johnson
appropriately pointed out my &quot;lower 48 centric&quot; view of the world. I forgot
that Alaska is also part of the Left Coast. Perhaps I'm a candidate for a
subscription to National Geographic? Anyway, thanks for the invite Tom, if you
can provide copious amounts of mosquito repellent I may take you up on your
offer.

I think that part of the allure of getting a fixer upper is anticipating the
journey itself. I mean if you've only got to travel a few miles to pick
something up, where's the adventure in that? Then again, to look at the other
side of the equation, there's the cost of traveling to pick something up. 

Joel Walker gave me a very detailed description of his '68, for which I am
grateful. I fear though that I would have to get down on my hands and knees to
convince my boss that I need to fly to Alabama for some trade show, and then
convince him that I need a week off for trailering a car back. Hmmmm, it's
enticing Joel, but we'll see.

So thanks again to all, I'm putting up a map with pins for each location that
contains my possible dream machine.

Certainly if any of you run across anything, please let me know.

RAMBLE = OFF

thanks,

Bren
