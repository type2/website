Subject: Re: Should I Buy this Synchro?


&gt;&gt; The kicker is this, brand new 2.1 Wasserboxer, dealer installed, with
&gt;&gt; new clutch etc and new front exhaust manifold at the same time, with
&gt;&gt; labor bill for $3500 last fall (ouch).  The guy said will sell $8000
&gt;&gt; firm,
&gt;

Seems like a decent deal, what's the warranty on the new engine. 65K miles 
to lose the first one seems low. You seem safe from major $$$s, except the 
drivetrain, so look for leaks/shot CVs blah blah. Tires/brakes? Power 
steering, front sway bar links? Working diff lock. Dicker quickly, before 
someone else asks the same question and he says $7500.   tim s.
