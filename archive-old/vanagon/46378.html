&gt; Air-cooled's are still in production.  Advances, improvements are continually

&gt; 
&gt; Water-cooled's are orphans, not even supported by VW any longer, save in the
&gt; peripheral sense.  Valient efforts by a few to keep them alive thru engine
&gt; transplants generally get short shrift from their peers.  
&gt; 
&gt; Over the last couple of years of Vanagon list activity I've gained a strong
&gt; impression that the typical owner of a water-cooled VW van is not only less
&gt; mechanically adept than air-cooled owners, they seen less willing to acquire
&gt; the skills and invest in the tools that would keep their orphaned vehicles
&gt; alive, a failure of spirit -- or Fear of Grease -- that virtually assures
&gt; such machines will end up on the junk heap.
&gt; 
I must say I'm a bit surprised by your black and white summary of 
things, Bob. I agree the average waterbox owner may be less adept 
mechanically than the average airbox owner. But I don't believe many 
of those waterboxers on the list fall into the 'average' category, 
myself included. If they've taken the interest to find out about VWs 
on the net, and join in the voluminous discussions, then they are 
likely the type who prefers to do their own work and takes pride in 
learning things along the way.

By condemning w/b owners as you have, and recommending they be kept 
separate from those with the 'spirit', I feel you are creating an 
unnecessary rift between the groups of owners, assuming such groups 
exist in the first place.

Look at it this way:

600+ list members, right?
-subtract those currently owning a vehicle from both 'groups'
-subtract those who at one time owned an a/c, but now own a w/b (did 
they lose the spirit..?)
-subtract those who now own a w/b, and plan to own an a/c someday 
(myself included :)
-subtract those wannabussers who joined the list to gain 
valuable insight on both w/b &amp; a/c buses (which I used to be)

What do you have left?
My guess is not many people.

I am a waterbox owner. I *never* let anyone work on my vehicles if I 
can help it. This includes several engine swaps, clutch rebuilds, 
shocks, brakes, etc. I plan to keep my '85 Jetta away from a scrap 
yard as long as possible - sure I'd love to drive a '56 to work every 
day, but I drive 120km/day over a steep curvy mountain road which 
is better suited to the Jetta, which does nicely and gets 55-60 mpg as 
well. I figure the money I save in fuel on the Jetta can go towards my 
'projects', which I hope to include a 71 bus soon.

So do I not have the spirit, simply 'cause I own a w/b? I think 
not. It's not my fault that a/c vws are at a premium around here. But 
I will continue my search for bus(es), yard space and spousal 
acceptance allowing...

You speak of failure of spirit, well the spirit I have come to know 
and love on this list is one of helping others with a common love of 
VWs. It seems to me that your spirit in this area may have failed 
you, briefly I hope.
