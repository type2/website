Subject: EV w/MXL in snow

The first snow of the season has happened in New England. We installed
Michelin MXLs last summber. conclusions:

a) These tires are MUCH better than the OEM Conti tires. Grip is very good
(2&quot; of wet snow over ice) to the point where it was hard to &quot;break away&quot;
the drive wheels in 1st gear under power (autobox).
b) New England winters are  &quot;vacuum enabled&quot;. If anyone has/knows of a job
for a middle aged peddler in TUCSON pls. advise :)
