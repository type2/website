Subject: Re: air scoops on splitties



Eric,

I found that air-scoops provide a slight over-pressure in the engine
compartment.

This doesn't have anything to do with engine cooling.

The engine's blower is a pump, perfectly capable of sucking in all the air it
wants.  A slight overpressure in the engine compartment might make its work
easier but the scoops also scoop up other stuff, such as rain, leaves and
what-not.

I installed air scoops on my '65 because my oil cooler is mounted
horizontally on the engine compartment floor in the corner opposite the
battery.  The overpressure provided by the scoops is enough to promote a good
air-flow through the oil cooler, enough to do the job at normal speeds and
loads.  When climbing hills or going fast or hauling a heavy load, a electric
fan is needed to push enough air through the oil cooler.

Might as well leave them on.  You'll just have to find something to fill up
the holes.  :-)

-Bob
