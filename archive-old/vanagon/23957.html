I'm a recent owner of a '80 Westfalia and want to know where to
order(either mail order or local) inexpensive, reliable parts, both new and
used, both mechanical and cosmetic.  Also, what is the manual of choice for
this vehicle?  I understand the Muir book goes up to '79 only.  All replies
welcome and TIA.   (xtra info:  I live in the LA area).
