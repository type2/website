&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Speaking of CA emmissions restrictions, is there any problem with bringing
&gt;&gt;an non-CA-approved Vanagon into California for three months on Missouri
&gt;&gt;plates?  The vehicle would probably be parked in the same place most of
&gt;&gt;the time.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Thanks,

Shouldn't be a problem. If you were stopped by a cop just say you are visiting
with proof of out of state driver license. I did not register my car right
away until something like 6 month later.
