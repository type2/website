Subject: self-adjusting brakes?
Date: Wed, 27 Nov 1996 06:00:15 +0000

I replaced the rear brake shoes on my '84 Vanagon GL.  The Bently manual
says they will self adjust and not to adjust the emergency brake linkage
until they do (I think).
A mechanic with VW said they won't self adjust, that you have to manually
adjust them through the backing plate adjusting hole. He said not to adjust
the emergency brake linkage, the brake shoe adjustment will take up the
slack.  I attempted this but seem to have had each turn returned by the self
adjusting spring and lever.

I searched the archives and found discussion of self adjusting by driving in
reverse and braking hard? 

I'm concerned about driving without an emergency brake.  When replacing the
brake shoes, I shifted the wheel cylinder piston and some fluid leaked from
one side. I hope this was because I pushed the piston out too far and not a
failing wheel cylinder?

Thanks,
