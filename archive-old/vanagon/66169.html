&gt;  Hi, These urethane bushings are notorious for squeeking. We use them for off road use because they are less spongey than the stockers and that allows us to control the movement of the trailing arms closer (if the bushing gives too much the trailing arm will drop farther and cause more CV angle than the setup might allow thereby breaking the CV joints). In one race some cars will pound out the torsion bushing enough to add 2 or 3 degrees in the CV angle. That is why they sell urethane bushings. I wouldn't put urethanes in a street car, no need and they are squeeky. We don't put any lube on them because it will just attract more dirt and it will just grind on the bushing and spring plate. Has anyone ever tried dry Molyibnium (?) on urethane? I remember a liquid product that had moly in it that after it was applied the liquid evaporated and just left the moly(like the talcom process that was discussed earlier).
