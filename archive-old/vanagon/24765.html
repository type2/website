Subject: cost of inuvik trip


OK - clarification on parameters.  My '81 westy is gutless even when
just tuned/serviced.  The camping cabinetry and stove/sink, etc. I&quot;m
told adds an additional 1600 lbs. of weight to the thing, and that's
not counting weight of driver, passengers, plus the ADDITIONAL 2K
pounds of camping toys I gotta bring on every trip.  :)  Anyway,  on
a GOOD highway run without the AC on, if I'm lucky I might get 18 mpg.
On around town stuff, stop and go, with the AC on, on a BAD day, I've
gotten as low as 14.  I'd assume therefore to be as pessimistic as around
8-12 mpg on bad roads going slow on the Inuvik trip.  

Also, I forgot to clarify that I, at least, am supposed to always super
high octane in my westy.  I was told that TODAY's super has the same octane
rating as regular of yesteryear, since the octane ratings were changed.  That
is why the owner's manual recommended regular, which is now equivalent to
super.  

Also, to make matters futher complicated (will some understanding left-
brained person volunteer to transcribe and keep track of all this?), I
meant to say that it would of course be helpful to have all the dollar
estimates ALL in either ALL Canadian dollars, or ALL US dollars, so that
we stay consistent.  Staticians?

Thanks to the many who responded to my query about the cost, both on
the list, as well as privately.  Estimates for gas have ranged from
$650-$1,000, and estimates for food from $200-$800.  Either way, I
guess Joel's got a point:  it woudln't be a bad idea to plan on allowing
$100 per day, and that would pad things in case you needed parts, tire
window replacements, etc.
