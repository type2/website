hi everyone, I have a slightly different problem, my power steering is
making a whining noise when the steering wheel is turned. Is it in need of
a new power steering pump? or do I need to top up the fluid in the resevoir
? I would be grateful for any comments and help as I have been quoted £200
for a replacement pump?

regards,  Ralph

&gt; Bought a 89 vanagon and on the head where the screws go in to hold the 
&gt; powersteering pump, the casting broke off the head and now there is 
&gt; noplace to screw the screw into.  Is there an aftermarket bracket to 
&gt; bypass the head mounting or do I have to get a new head?
