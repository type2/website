&gt; No good either. For winter use, a 110 volt heater is not adequate to heat
&gt; the interior to comfy warm conditions--the BTUs are simply insufficient, I
&gt; have found.

I respectfully disagree, kind sir.  We have a 1500W 110V forced-air 
heater for cold nights in our westy, and it keeps us nicely warm, even 
when it's as cold as -20 C.  And, no, just because I'm Canadian doesn't 
mean I'm acclimatized to cold weather--when it gets below 23 C (75 F) in 
an interior space, I get grouchy.  The electric heater keeps me happy in 
cold weather, with the big drag being that you have to stay at a dismal 
'RV Park'-type place to find hook-ups in the winter.  And no worries 
about CO poisoning, so we sleep cozy through the night!

When it's only a little below freezing, we have to turn the heater 
waaaaay down, or the temp inside the camper gets up to 85 F or higher.  No 
kidding. 

If Derek has problems with electric heaters below -20 C, he may be 
speaking the truth about insufficient heating capacity since we've never 
camped in the camper at colder temperatures.  If this is the case, and he 
was referring specifically to temps below -20 C, then I take back my 
libelous accusation and hope he doesn't sic Ric on me.  ;-)

If you're thinking of trying to run one of these off your batteries, 
forget it.  Watts= Volts x Amps, right?  With 1500 Watts from your 12 
Volt system, you're looking at 125 Amps draw BEFORE taking into account 
loses from the inverter and whatnot.  You won't have heat for long at 
that rate!
