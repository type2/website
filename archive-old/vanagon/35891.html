Subject: Re: How a thermostat can fail closed. [f]


&gt;&gt;       I have an '81 Westy, ie. air cooled, not much to bleed. It's funny
&gt;&gt; the box my thermostat came in also told me to bleed my cooling system
&gt;&gt; and fill the radiator with the engine running. These thermostat must
&gt;&gt; be used on water cooled engines too.
&gt;&gt;       Thanks for the information, I'll look at my Bentley.

&gt;Hey Johnny,
&gt;
&gt;May maybe he meant your own bodys cooling system.  Have you been
&gt;properly bled yet?  ;)


And *where* do you put the thermostat again? No, guess I don't wanna know...
