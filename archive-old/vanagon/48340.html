Subject: Boulder, Colorado

Hi Everyone-

Don't know what to expect from this list but I was told it was the place
to be...I recently bought a 1970 Bus (some of you may know it as &quot;Matty
J's bus&quot; which he took on a little trip and ended up here in Boulder)...

Anyway, this is my first time owning a bus...anyone have any suggestions
on who or where to get valves adjusted etc, in the Boulder area??

Thanks!!

-Mike
