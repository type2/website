Subject: fridge (again)

Ok, my previous message about the camper fridge was a bit premature. I
have now checked the heater element once again and, as far as I can tell,
it's working. BTW, the measured resistance between the 2 (functional)
wires is about 4 Ohms. Nevertheless, the fridge is not getting cold,
although it has been running for about an hour now. Any suggestions what
else can be checked?
