&gt;Well driving my new '78 home Sunday I really noticed how
&gt;much better it (136k miles, origional ball joints, old shocks)
&gt;handled on its worn reinforced XZX's than the mint '77 I
&gt;brought home last weekend for my parents (88k miles, new ball
&gt;joints, recent shocks) did on its regular XZX's all other things
&gt;equal,
&gt;(snip)
&gt;For starters if anyone does not know, Buses and Vanagons
&gt;up to the Syncro/Alloy era should have
&gt;
&gt;185R14C or 185R14 reinforced these work out to 25.65 x 7.28 inches
&gt;(diameter x width) with a C or reinforced or 6 ply load rating.
&gt;A D load rating or 8 ply is even heavier duty.  Tires like these
&gt;carry a 40+ psi maximum inflation rating and a load rating typically
&gt;over 1500 lbs a tire.
&gt;
&gt;195/75R14C is another good choice with dimensions 25.52 x 7.68
&gt;
&gt;205/75R14C may be a bit big for a Bus at 26.11 x 8.08
&gt;
&gt;27x8.5R14C might be run for added ground clearance but would be tight
&gt;in fact I don't know if they work or not.


I recently replaced the (old, cheap, worn) 185/75R14 passenger car
tires on my '71 bus, with 215/75R14 BF Goodrich passenger car tires.
I know, they're not reinforced or C-rated or anything-- a no-no
according to the manual.

There seem to be two main reasons for using reinforced tires on VW
vans-- load carrying capability, and handling. The stiffer sidewalls
of reinforced tires seem to noticable improve straight-line driving
over car tires. These (big) BFG's certainly improved mine! It may be
because they put more rubber on the road, or possibly they are simply
big enough that they are made for Cadillacs, and proportionately
stiff (I'm guessing). I never put much load in this bus, so I'm not
too worried about load rating. If I ever have to haul firewood or
the results of my son's Little League paper drive, I'll make two trips.

When I hit a bump with the wheels fully turned, I do get a slight
zzzzip as the tire rubs in the front, so I'm evidently a little
over what VW had in mind for tire clearance. But this happens
very rarely, and it's nice haveing the slight added top end speed
on level ground these oversized tires give.

Torque and acceleration? .....       How 'bout those 49ers????

My $0.02...

P.S. there was a VERY long thread about a month ago, on the
advantages/disadvantages of using car tires over LT or other
recommended tires on VW buses. Check out the archives.
