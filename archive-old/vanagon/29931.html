Subject: Tranny Nosecone

After all the good advice from you folks, I have narrowed my shifting 
 problems away from the linkage and in to the transmission. My question 
 is, can I pull the nose cone off and get to all the essential guts 
 with the transmision in place or do I need to drop the powertrain to 
 do it right? This will be my first experiance with removing a VW 
 engine and transmission and the major internal work that follows. I am 
 looking forward to it with dredded anticipation, similar to a sexual 
 encounter with your high school buddys mom.  

Thanks
Clay
