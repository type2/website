Joel, et al:

I sent the orginal message to Rose. This was her response. 

Thought it'd add some humor here.

	Is there a place in your virtual garage for a pack-rat gadgeteer?
	Maybe parts manager or assistant to Joel?
	Course we know who's known as the gadgeteer, right?  :)

How 'bout it? Can I be the Gadegteer (Director of Gadgetry or some thing like that)?
