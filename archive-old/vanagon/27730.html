Try the following:

Auto-Mat   516/938-7373

Carpet set:   (includes everything, it woulds seem, looking at the 
diagram...)
Bus/Transporter: $350-$900, depending on nylon or wool, or several 
in-between)
Vanagon (less cargo mat): $400-960, depending....
Vanagon Cargo mat: $80-$195

the materials range:
Nylon pile/nylon loop:  Cheapest
plush pile-Tweed loop:
Porsche fur-german loop:
PG Blend/Sq Weave/Wool
Wilton wool: Most expensive.

They also do seat covers, upholstery, headliners....interior stuff.
I havn't used them yet, but I have heard good things from 1 or 2 people who 
have.  They seem a little pricey....but I have nothing to compare it to.

Oh yeah....I get a discount.  from 20% to 50%.  If they quote you full 
price, let me know, and I'll see what I can do.....

I know there was a post several weeks ago regarding seat uphosterey.  I 
wonder if any members have located a reliable source for carpet for 
Vanagons.  I know there are many companies that supply carpet for the 
busses, but I'm in need of a new carpet for an 84 Vanagon.  Thanks in 
advance for the leads.

Fred,

84 Vanagons
