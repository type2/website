&gt; 
&gt; All,
&gt; 
&gt; DeLorean(Stainless Steel car man for those who haven't followed the thread
&gt; too closely) was arrested for trafficing cocaine. Since his assest were seized
&gt; he did not have enough money for his defense.  To raise the funds he had
&gt; the DeLorean built.  Ironically he didn't make enough money back to recover
&gt; the startup costs for the car.I guess that's why he went to jail
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,
&gt;

I thought that he was busted for cocaine smuggling AFTER building the
DeLorean.  Rumor was he was smuggling cocaine in the car's door panels.
Damn those cars are neat, wish I had one.
