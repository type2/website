Subject: Vanagon cold weather problems

The last two days in NC have been *cold*.  On both cold days I could not start my bus.  I took the battery out and had it checked and recharged.  The service 
tech said it was ok.  I have a few ideas from the Muir book I will try when it is warm enough to crawl under the bus including:
1.  Check starter bolts
2.  Install ByPass solonoid
3.  Do starter and solonoid check.

But until then, what is the deal with jump starting a Vanagon with F.I.  Muir says DON'T DO IT.  The VW Vanagon owners manual shows a procedure.  Can someone 
clear this up for me.

Hello to all NC Bus owners.  See ya next gathering...
