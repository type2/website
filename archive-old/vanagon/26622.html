Subject: end of oct. camping (CA) (was baja)


One of the jobs of a good pyromaniac is to scout out campsites which
are a little bit &quot;removed&quot; from the beaten path.  They are less likely
to arouse suspicion when one burns engine cases, sends up rocket
flairs, performs lawn chair and circuit board melt-downs, etc.  

While we discussed earlier on this list to have our campsite at Isabella
Lake, our very own resident flame-wrestler, Bradley, pointed out
to me that a lake a bit further north might be preferable for this
group's &quot;needs.&quot;  It is still off 99, and in the same general area,
but a bit more north; just east of Visalia.  It's called Lake
Kaweah (we figure it's a good idea to have water nearby, just in case),
and is near spots on the map named Lemon Cove, Woodlake, Three Rivers,
and so forth.  There are only two campsites here, and it looks at
least from the AAA map not to be a highly touristed area, so I
move we take Prunehead's suggestion and locate our campsite to
this location.  If we get there and don't like it, it will be
easy enough to progress on up the highway (which is 198), further
into Sequoia National Park, and find other campspaces higher up.
&gt;From Lake Kaweah, there's a vast array of directions we could 
go and find alternate camping grounds in a relatively short
drive.  

The favored campground looks to be one on U.S. Army Corps of
Engineer's property, AAA campground #664, which has EVERYTHING
except riding stables.  They DO have showers! Yeeeeeeehaaaaaaaw.

Anyway, the place is called the Horse Creek Recreation Area, on the 
SE shore of Lake Kaweah.  The phone there is:  209.561.3155.  The
places is open all year, and charges a humble $10.  There's RV
spaces galore, but no hookups for AC, etc.  

I know that some of you may not be able to arrive on the traditional
Friday evening, so we're setting up a phone line with answering
machine for you to call before you set out, to make sure you'e
going to the right place (in case we get there, don't like it,
and change location).  This phone machine can have the outgoing
message altered remotely, so we'll change it as necessary.  Don't
lose the number - (ha!)...it's 510.783.1194.  It will be 
set up to give you the information you'll need by Friday, the
first day of the campout.

Here's some of the people who've responded, indicating they plan
to go.  If a &quot;?&quot; is by your name, it means you probably will, but
are not quite certain.  There are several others who are less certain,
and several from whom I've not heard.  Please let me know as soon
as you can, so that we can plan the potluck thing...
