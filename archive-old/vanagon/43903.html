Subject: 75 westy engine flames..literal..

well, going back to the old subject of flame in the engine compartment, i 
guess i should describe the problem with my bus.._dot_causeed me to &lt;!NO!&gt; 
abandone the project fo the moment...a long moment while i try to get a 
car that moves again..

anyway, the tranny dies in my 68 bug, so i..umm..force it home, and get  
friend to help get the bus started. rip the dizzy off my bug, and stck it 
in the bus.. after finding parts that i thought were gone for good &lt;i.e. 
the timing mark ring thingy&gt; and making sure the fuel system was working, 
we started cranking the egine over. a few soft wooshwooshwosh sounds, 
then a pop, and a soft woosh..this one though was different. FLAME shoots 
out from UNDER the engine. big ball of yellow directly under the enigne. 
i yell WHOA! and rip the battery cable of. he's like what?! cause the 
flame was quite silent. no explosion or even a pop. anyway. i pull the 
battery out, set it on the bench, and clean up the tools. we then back to 
bus out of the garage. &lt;you may remember the problems trying to get it IN 
the garage, so this was a drastic measure..&gt;

anyway, anyideas on why it did this??


thanks..
