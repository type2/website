[An ungraceful but honest subject line.] Greetings to all on this list;
I've been reading it since I gave a home to a '70 bus in March, but now
it's time for me to speak up. 

[Bus background: Neglected for several years by PO and no record of its
treatment before he got it.  Some projects left unfinished by PO.  Still,
body's in good shape and after some tuning-up (or tooning-up, depending on
your point of view) it's been running pretty well.  AE block number
indicates a '71 engine; that's a long story for another post. My plan is
to gradually get it back to pretty-good (but probably not excruciatingly-
correct) stock, and use it regularly for around-town. Now to The Problem:]

The Problem appeared yesterday, when it refused to idle when cold. I got
it home and inspected it today to see if the cam on the choke was
engaging.  In point of fact, it was down in the well under the main
pulley, along with a 10mm nut and a thin flat washer.

I may be a little new at this, but I knew this was clearly not good. On
inspection, at least one part still seems to be missing from the assembly:
A hook-shaped drive arm, about 3cm long, that fits over the same shaft as
the cam and appears to seat on the half-round threaded portion of the
shaft and hook over one edge of the cam.  [It's a Solex 30 pict 3 carb.]
The Haynes manual includes this thing in some drawings and photos of the
carb, and not others, but never seems to discuss it.  My questions: 

1. Does this doodad have a proper name?  &quot;Hook-shaped thingie&quot; isn't going
to cut it, nomenclature-wise, when/if I call the FLAPS.

2. From my [probably imperfect] description, does it sound like there are 
any other parts I lost in the process?

3. Just how screwed am I?  How hard will it be to find a replacement for
the missing piece[s], and at what likely cost? 

4. When I got the bus from the PO, I inherited its former SB engine,
including its dual carbs [see above, re: long story].  That engine's
stored across town so I haven't checked--but might I be able to find the
part[s] I need there, as well as an assembled carb to study so I'll know
how to put everything back on in the correct sequence etc.?  

5. Is there anything else I should know about trying to replace it all?
Carburetors spook me a little. 

Thanks in advance for any suggestions. 

best,
Bill Nothstine

p.s. I get VANAGON in digest mode, which affects when and in what order I
see postings.
