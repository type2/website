Subject: Save That exhaust!  try POR-15

A few Weeks ago I painted my exhaust using POR-15  black exhaust paint.
 After over 1000 miles of highway and rummaging through the Mud at Hershey, i
am surprised that the paint is still intact.  Not a hint of bubbling off.  I
don't know how lon it will last but it went on real easy and hardened after
driving for a while.  A $12.00 can will do the exhaust, all brackets with
some left over.  I'll see how it works over the winter.
