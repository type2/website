Subject: Re: Need advice for head gasket leak


So, is there any concensus on whether or not there would be any external 
indication recognizing that what I might be calling the head gasket is 
not the head gasket?  Also, for those who've had external indications, 
under what temp. and operating conditions was the leak apparent, and what 
was the rate of the leak?

THanks for any clarification.

&gt; &gt; 	If your &quot;head gasket&quot; was leaking you would have no external
&gt; &gt; indication. The head gaskets are on the inside. They are small metal
&gt; &gt; rings/washers that seal the top of the combustion cylander to the head. I would pin-point the leak before jumping to any conclusions. I am
&gt; &gt; betting on the crossover tube from the water pump to the right case.

&gt; HI,
&gt; 
&gt; I'm afraid I'd disagree.  Though technically not a traditional head
&gt; gasket, what most folks are referring to are the large odd-shaped rubber
&gt; gaskets which ARE visible externally.  Also, they MUST be replaced anytime
&gt; the heads come off; so, if you replace the thin aluminum seals and the
&gt; small o-ring gaskets on the cylinders, you should replace the &quot;head
&gt; gaskets&quot; as well.
