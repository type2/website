&gt;Does anybody drive a Syncro Wesfalia up to Tahoe or other ski area
regularly?
&gt;Does Cal Trans let you through like a 4x4 truck when chains are required?
I visit Mammoth Mountain every winter.  Since I've had the Syncro, I've been
let through with the other 4x4s both times that chains were required.  Once,
I had to tell the guy to look under the van if he didn't believe me about the
4WD.  I think that a requirement is to have snow tires in addition to 4x4.
 My Goodrich All-Terrain T/A radials aren't officially snow tires, but I
think they lump all-terrain tires in as O.K.

&gt;
&gt;How slow are the Syncros going up up hill compared to a regular westfalia? 
More weight = slower speed.  Unless,  2WD are having trouble with traction.

&gt;Maybe it worth it to just put on chains and be able to go faster?
Chains were NOT designed as an aid to go faster.  They're to add traction.  I
would advise going slow and steady, chains or not.  Going up into the Sierras
to ski I would always bring chains, even with a Syncro or traditional 4x4.
