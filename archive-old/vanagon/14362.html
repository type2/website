I take the engine and transmission out as a unit myself.  I've done it 3 or 4 times 
now.  It involves more unhooking since your have to take off the CVs and 
electrical stuff as well as clutch, heater valves, shiftlinkage and such but I
find this a lot easier than trying to get the clutch splines and pilot shaft
to mate with the tranny in the van.  Also if you have the engine and tranny out
as a unit you can put it on a wooden pallet and start it on the ground (pallet).

I also use a &quot;non-muir&quot; removal proceedure.  First I get the van up on steel ramps
under the wheels and then use a &quot;come along&quot; lever winch from the top to raise or 
lower the engine and tranny as a unit.  I use crossed railroad ties cut to length and 
mounted in a cross box pattern in the back cargo area of the bus.  Engine sling
is rigged using some nylon rope (braided NOT THE CHEAP GARBAGE) slung from the top 
of the clutch end of the engine using a bolt through the case holes there to the 
lift hook in the case on the front part of the breather box by the distributor.

Balance point for the engine and trany is about 4 inches from the clutch end of 
the engine.

You have to swing the big piece of tin above the engine out of the way to get at 
the bolts at the top of the tranny but since you have to remove everything off 
of the top of the engine this isn;t too bad.  Label all the wiring and if in 
doubt take some pictures of what the top of the engine looked like before 
taking it apart.  I find it remarkable how hand these pics are.

&gt;  I poked around last night for a few minutes surveying what I will have to do
&gt;  to remove the engine from my '74 Westy. Can anyone tell me whether it is 
&gt;  easier to remove the engine and transmission together, as a unit - which would
&gt;  go more or less straight down -  or to take the engine out by itself - back 
&gt;  and down - . There doesn't appear to be much room behind the engine to pull
&gt;  it clear of the transmission input shaft. Has anyone tried it both ways?
&gt; 
&gt;  Thanks in advance,
&gt; 
&gt;  Dave
