I was investigating a slight water leak from the auxiliary passenger heater
under the rear seat on my 1984 Caravelle GL. I tried tightening a couple of
nuts around a gasket but they were slipping so I thought they were
beginning to thread so I backed off. I lacked a workshop manual (Haynes
don't do one for watercooleds) so I looked in the Parts Catalogue and all
the parts were illustrated. I saw that the nuts I was tightening had
counterparts on the other side where I could not see (it is very cramped to
work under the rear seat). Then I was able to tighten them against each
other. This solved part of the leak. I also saw that a seal was available
for a little plastic tap which was the other culprit. I shall be ordering
this, maybe even the little tap depending on price and then I hope all
should be well.

Does the Bentley manual go into such minute detail? At GB#60 here it is
quite an investment.
