Subject: Re: CV joint grease: moly vs. lithium??

&gt;Hi folks, any opinions out there on this topic?  CV grease I can buy is
&gt;lithium based, light blue-green colour.  Bentley say use G6 grease, duh OK?
&gt;the dealer says their grease is black, so I'm sure it's moly based.
&gt;Problem, what's best, type and brand-name? And, since I am only topping up
&gt;the joints, what if I guess wrong and end up mixing them? Sage advice
&gt;appreciated.  Thanks.   Tim
&gt;
Moly grease is called for, not lithium, although the manufacturers of many
synthetic greases insist that their synthetic grease works fine with CVs.
