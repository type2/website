Dave (and anyone else)

Sorry I think I mistated something.

The injectors open as soon as the double relay give juice to the 
system.  either while cranking or while the engine is running.  But 
not with just the ignition on.  Sorry

    Also you mentioned trying to find the 12V source/short that could 
be bypassing the ECU.  Well I am a mechanical engineer and I get 
chills down my back when it comed to this kind of stuff.  I have 
limited experience in this area.  How would I go about trying to find 
that little short.  What I did last summer was to hook up a multi 
meter, about the only electronic thing I know how to use, to the 
injector connector and did a continuity test to the all connections 
going into the ECU.  I found no continuity where it shouldn't be.  At 
least from that I could tell.  How else could this be done better ?

Thanks
Brent
