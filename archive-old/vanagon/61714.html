Subject: Universals on driveshaft-syncros-

HI again....well I just got back from the Litchfield show.  Found out a few
interesting facts about the universals or the cv's on the driveshaft which
ever you like to call them.  The noise I've been hearing i've concluded is my
univesals goin and the shakeing is makeing it even more evident that I need
them.  Well while at the show I talked to 3 differnt syncro owners and many
others to find out how not to go through the 700 dollar process that VW wants
us do ........One person said that if you take the universals off the
driveshaft and bring them to a bearing shop(make sure you call them and tell
them your comming first)..they will measure them and match them up perfectly
to another universal....VW lies to us about there not being a replacement or
aftermarket part.  I was told it takes about 2-4 days to recieve the
universals.  This guy only paid $12.00 a joint....thats 24.00 bucks for both
beats the 700 dollars right.  His syncro runs fine and dandy so just thought
I'd tell ya all bout it....

Also one question does anyone know if the cars that have syncro in them have
the same size drive shafts?......
