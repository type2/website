Subject: Re: Fuel Inj Sync

&gt;Hello Dear VWers,
&gt;
&gt;I have a general question about how the injectors get synchronized with
&gt;the sparks. If you start from the Hall generator, it doesn't have any
&gt;idea which cylinder it is generating the pulses for. Then it goes to the 
&gt;coil &amp; at the low tension side of the coil, there is no info about
&gt;the cyl #. So, then these pulses go to the fuel injector control unit,
&gt;and there the control unit has to fire up the injectors at the right
&gt;time. How does this get synchronized?
&gt;
&gt;Regards,
&gt;Vahid
&gt;

My Aftermarket injection system, and I think most others, are 'multipoint'.
This means they all fire at once.  I wondered about how it would affect the
engine as well, however, I think the injection timing pulses are so much
faster than the engine, it just doesn't matter, the fuel is ready and
waiting at the inlet port and it doesn't have to shoot right down through
the open valve.

Eug,
