&gt;i know for a fact that double sliding doors WERE available for the 1971
&gt;model year ... cause when i bought mine, i *almost* ordered one that way.
&gt;
&gt;anybody out there ever seen one?

Yes, a white one (from the front blinkers) looked to be 1970 vintage.

In the parking lot at a California Grateful Dead concert.

Jack.
