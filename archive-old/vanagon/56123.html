Subject: Re: Cleaning plastic wheel covers?


&gt; What do people recommend for cleaning (but not damaging) plastic wheel covers?
&gt; 
&gt; I tried scrubbing mind, but after several hours, there are still some black
&gt; patches that won't budge.
&gt; 
My uncle just mentioned to me that he got some stuff at the dealer 
for this (he has an '89), which is designed for the plastic covers. 
He also got the paint code for having a paint shop mix a batch of 
spray for these covers. Once I get it, I'll post the info.
