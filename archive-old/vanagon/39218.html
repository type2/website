Subject: Original colors

I have a 1971 bus, that is brown bottom, and white top.  I am trying to 
figure out if that was the original paint or not, does anyone know if 
those colors were used for that year/model.  Also, where the paint has 
worn off, like under the door handles, and where it has been chipped off, 
is an orange color.  On the roof, where the white has faded, a lighter 
orange shows through, is this a primer, or possibly the original colors, 
painted over.  Is there any way to find this out...any help would be 
appreciated...just curious...Dallas
