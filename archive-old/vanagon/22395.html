So Stuart Hutton says:
&gt; 
&gt; Hello vanagon gang,
&gt; Here is the promised part 2 of leaks.  My diesel seems to leak in the
&gt; area I imagine to be related to the auxiliary heater.  Has anyone had
&gt; this problem before?  My vanagon is a 1982 diesel.  Thanks.
&gt; Stuart
&gt; 

Oh yeah, I've had that problem before.  Mine turned out to be leaking
out of the auxiliary heater bleed screw.  I verified it by running the
engine and checking under the cover.  When Linda revved the engine, it
peed straight up like a baby.  If it's coming from the bleeder screw,
just get a new one with a new gasket and the leak be gone.  I've read
that others have leaks in the core itself.  Check the archives for 
how they fixed theirs.

Cheers!

Steven
