Subject: Mirror Glass

If you'd like to replace the mirror glass only inexpensively, try YERGER
INDUSTRIES in New York at 716-684-4330. They provide replacement glass
for just about everything and will send you to their local distributor
or ship directly to you (if you whine). Under $15.00 the last time I
tried them. 

You may need a tube of elephant snot to install.
