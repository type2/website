&gt; Does the relay click when you pull the switch? If it clicks, but does
&gt; not change, or the other lights go out, the switch is at fault. If
&gt; it does not click, the diode or relay is out.

I am having a similar problem in my '67.  To activate the high beams, 
it usually takes two or three clicks on the switch.  I took apart the 
switch, thinking it might just need to be cleaned.  It all looked 
ok, so I decided to manually touch the wires.  It did the same thing 
as before, only switching on occasion (but hearing the relay click 
every time it was contacted).
