Subject: door tent for my 82 Westfalia?

 Hi all, just getting ready to pull the bus out of the barn for another 
summer of fun and I'm looking for one of the tents that fit on your sliding 
door. If anyone has any info about these I'd love to get it.  E-mail to- 
sdhall1_at_students.wisc_dot_edu            Thanks,  Tim in Madison,Wisconsin
