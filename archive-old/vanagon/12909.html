Subject: wiring in VW's

What a rash of humor that has broken out on this list!

something more serious:
        I am installing my fresh engine tomorrow, and was looking around in 
the engine compartment, looking at the wires, and thinking of where they 
will go. I found a wire which is very thin and isn't on the wiring diogram.  
It's white with a green stripe, and is most definately factory installed.  I 
couldn't figure it out and had composed a message, then my terminal locked 
up, so all was lost.  By chance I looked at the 1972 T2 wiring dio, and 
there that little wire is!  It turns out that my 71 which is a very late 71, 
built in 7/71, has a test network, with that big plug in jobbie. This tiny 
wire goes to the coil on the condensor side, so information is available at 
the control plug.  I have since resolved to make a diogram and a pin-out to 
get the various information in a instant, with just a VOM.
        While I was there, I was thinking about the size of the wires in 
german cars.  The size is given in mm squared cross sectional area of the 
wires.  I calculated the AWG size for the various wires in the VW:
area in mm^2                    AWG
------------------------------------------------
0.5                                     20
1.0                                     17
1.5                                     15~16
2.5                                     13
4.0                                     11
6.0 (generator)                     9
25 (starter~battery)              3   

This is all interesting, because the generator wire is 6.0mm^2 or 9 gauge, 
and 10 guage will carry 30 amps, so that works out alright.  The other 
thing, is that all wire is commonly carried in even sizes, so don't go to 
the local FLAPS and ask for a bunch of 17 gauge wire.

Thats all for now.
