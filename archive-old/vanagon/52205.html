 Dear EV Owners,

          I was just wondering what your experience with the exhaust
system has been. At what mileage did you have to replace which part of
it? Where did you get the system, dealer or aftermarket? WHich aftermarket
business? Given the scarcity of parts and the problem of having to wait
until local dealers receive them is it wise to buy the most likely part
of the exhaust system to need replacing in advance of the inevitable
breakdown?

        So far at 38K miles I've had only to weld a hole in the exhaust
pipe just in front of the muffler.

Thanks in advance for your responses,
