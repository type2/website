Subject: bodega specifics


Ok, folks, it looks like June 2-4th weekend is the winner of the dates for the 
Bodega Bay camp gathering. I propose another potluck, and since I think no one 
else much relishes organizing this part, I'm suggesting-

------
Friday nite:
seafood/fish appetizers
clam chowder (white)
side dishes:  caesar salad, fruit salad, veg. casserole,
sourdough french bread
dessert
coffee
-------
Saturday nite:
guacamole/salsa/chips
taco buffet/assembly line
rice
beans
salads:  green, fruit
dessert:  buenuelos, flan, churros, etc.
kahluah coffee

If this menu doesn't suit you, e-mail me with your flack, and I'll take it 
into consideration!

Things to bring, in order of priority:
one weird object for the pyromaniacs in our group to burn (it's a TRADITION)

beer, wine, or other &quot;substance&quot; of your choice
     (gak - I KNOW I'm gonna regret listing this last one)
