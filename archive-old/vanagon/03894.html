&gt; screens? I figure I could just mount a motherboard, powersupply, etc.,

Cool idea!  Things I'd be careful of are: dust, heat, water and vibrations.
Make sure your electronics get enough air but not too much of these other 
bad things.  If you COULD mount a computer somewhere inside a wall it would
sure cut down on the space requirements.  Are you going to mount a telephone
jack somewhere on the outside so you can plug into a phone line and connect to
the outside world?


I often play with the notion of having a huge yard sale and selling off
all my crap and moving into my bus.  One of the main sticking points to this
scheme has always been that I don't want to give up my computers and
phone connection.  I know this makes me sound like a computer nerd,
but.. oh well..  In reality, there are many other problems with the
scheme, but that's the one that I use to talk myself out of trying it.
