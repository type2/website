&gt;Now the news, NOONE HAD MEASURED A LATE TANK FOR ME,
&gt;come on people I do not have one at my disposal, I'm talking about 5 
&gt;minutes work with a seamstress style tape measure, get circumference 
&gt;and location of output flanges.  The 6 X 30 on mine has obviously 
&gt;about a 19&quot; circumference is this is the case on a late tank LET ME 
&gt;KNOW.

Sorry about that.  The tank on my '90 Westfalia is also 30&quot; long and 6&quot;
diameter.  I really think that an 8&quot; diameter tank will not fit without
both hanging down too far below the van.

I expect that a 36&quot; long tank *will* fit, but only if it's extended 3&quot; to
both the front and rear.  It won't extend much further in either direction.

A 7&quot; diameter tank *may* fit.

&gt;The other alternative is the other supllier, I just finally finished 
&gt;the prints on my &quot;wish list&quot; 7 X 36 tank which is I think a better 
&gt;size compromise.  4.8 gallons at 80%, over 150% origional capacity 
&gt;and less ground clearance loss.

I agree that this is a better size.  I don't think I would add an 8&quot;
diameter tank to my van.
