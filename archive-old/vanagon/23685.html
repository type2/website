Subject: Re: 93'-EV Help!!! piston slapperoo

I bought my EV about 4 mos. ago and at the time noticed a &quot;diesel type sound&quot;
at idle and on acceleration.  I had some concern with this noise.  So the
salesman had me start two brand new EV's that were sitting on the lot (Winni.
campers) Both had the same noise, so at the time I chalked it up to the
hi-torque characteristics of the engine.

Now I will be sending the van to the dealership for investigation.  Of course
they aren't going to believe me at first, so I will have to prove that this
noise isn't normal.  

Any suggestions on who the dealer will be able to contact to confirm that
this is a problem with the EV's?   Does VOA know about this problem?

Thanks For your help,
