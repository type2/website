Subject:      need locate brake part for 69



Its a real bite, these simple parts. I need the handbrake levers for my 69
bus, you know, that lever that attaches to your rear brakshoe and your
handbrake cable attaches to it. I also need the connecting link for both rear
brakes, the bar that fits between the two shoes that always slips off when you
are trying to put the shoes back one the cylinder.

Such a basic little part, so hard to find. When I got the bus it they were
both off, there is some jerk out there who is bearing the load of a 1000
curses. I spent all day in a junk yard pulling some of a newer bus, they
didn't fit. I guess it has to fit a bus from 68 - July 71. I put in an order
at the Parts Place in MI, so far they haven't found any, and the other things
I have ordered from them have been for post 71 buses, guess they are having a
bad hair month? Any help is a help, thanks.
