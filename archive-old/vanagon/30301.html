&gt; &gt; Hi all, 
&gt; &gt; 	I just have a kooky question which came to me the other day while 
&gt; &gt; going to sleep in my bus.  Which way does everyone sleep?  Personally, I 
&gt; &gt; sleep with my head to the rear but I have to be careful not to hit my 
&gt; &gt; head on the shelf.  That's when I wondered if anyone else slept the other 
&gt; &gt; way and why.  This is assuming you'd be sleeping in the lower level 
&gt; &gt; (downstairs) of course.  Actually, now I'm curious about the upper level 
&gt; &gt; as well.  Well???
&gt; &gt; -Erik (who only bumped his head once)
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; I sleep in either direction, depending what's up hill and down.  I have 
&gt; seen one VW ad that show a sleeping bag with its opening up front.

I don't know how anyone could sleep up top with their head to the back of 
the van. (Except for the guy who' 6'4&quot;.)  I'd smoke my head every  
morning and never learn. &quot;Downstairs&quot; should  be way too small for anyone 
over 6' isn't it?

ps I read awihle back somewhere about a women wanting to order a front 
spare tire cover with the &quot;VW&quot; logo on it. Cheap way to make one is to 
buy a plain (insert color of choice here) spare tire cover from ( I don't 
know too many stores in the states maybe &quot;Fred Myers&quot;) and then go to 
the  yellow pages and look up  a sign making shop. Have them  scan in the 
vw logo of choice onto the computer and make you a sticker from it. 
Really adds to  the look of my '77 Westy.
