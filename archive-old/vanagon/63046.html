Subject:      using vanagon bench seat in a Westy

I'd like to add more seating to my 85 Westy using the vanagon
bench seat recently put up for sale.  I've got a single seat that
slides in on the floor rails which are full width.  Since I'm not
located near enough to the vanagon bench seat to try it myself does
anyone know if it will fit with the Westy stove, etc?

Regards,
Don
