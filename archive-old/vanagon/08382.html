&gt;...    everything seems to be back to normal.  I plan to run another
&gt;tank of gas with dry-gas added, then change the filter again and add
&gt;some Chevron Techron.

one thing to mention: those folks that make Chevron Techron recommend that
you NOT run more than TWO bottles through your system without changing the
oil in the engine. apparently, the stuff tends to dilute the oil more than
just gasoline. so after you run the tank with the Techron, it might be a
good idea to change the oil. just a thought.
