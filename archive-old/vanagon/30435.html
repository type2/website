If Greg(?) or anyone else is going to be traveling through the 
Chicagoland area over the holidays, I would be willing to give them the 
phone number at my in-laws (where I will be for a few days --not sure 
of the exact dates yet.) place for any emergency assistance that might be 
needed. If you want to grab it before hitting the road, just contact me 
offlist at my email address.

&gt;Since I only subscribed last night, what is The Old Bus
&gt; &gt;Rescue Squad?  I will be traveling the length of Illinois on
&gt; &gt;December 26.  St Louis to Milwaukee via Bloomington and
&gt; &gt;Chicago &gt; 
&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;From your description, you will end up going north on
&gt; Interstate 55 from Bloomington and then around Chicago on
&gt; 294.  Make sure you time your arrival to avoid rush-hour on
&gt; 294!  Alternative route (unless you WANT to see the windy
&gt; city) is to take Interstate 39 north from Bloomington to
&gt; Beloit, Wisconsin and then Int. 43 to Milwaukee.  The Int.
&gt; 39 route also (By The Way) also puts you within about 10
&gt; miles from my *bus and breakfast* here in DeKalb.
