&gt; fear that the Florida Keys may be a bit too expensive for our
&gt; student budget.

If you do go to the keys, there's a great public camp site on the left 
just BEFORE the seven mile bridge. I was on my way down to the keys and 
stopped there kind of late one night in my old '70 campmobile. Only two 
other campers in the park. I slipped into a spot right next to the 
shallow ocean and listened to the tide roll out. It's great to sleep in 
the soothing arms of the ocean's voice! Don't know the price of the park. 
There was no attendant (or signs) when I arrived...or when I left the 
next AM. Wish I'd gone back with snorkel and mask and spent a day or two 
there, though. Also, there's a little stop-off on the right just after 
the seven mile bridge (a mile or so later) where I saw a big school of 
dolfyn swimming in good viewing distance. A small crowd was already 
there, so I take it this is a &quot;regular&quot; spot.

Have fun! Joe
