&gt; &gt;He said he filled it up until the pump shut off.  Put in $.30 more gas
&gt; &gt;to round it off, and went to pay for the gas.  When he got back to the
&gt; &gt;bus, he noticed a puddle of gas on the ground, and could see some gas
&gt; &gt;dripping behind him as he drove away.
...
&gt; disconnected or loose, you'll get gas running out of the tank. i think
&gt; Matthew has the same problem on his diesel (but for rust-hole reasons).

Ayuh,

 I repaired the rust-hole (using $4.00 worth of epoxy putty) an spread
the rest of the putty over the top of the tank where water could collect.
I then sprayed undercoating all over it...It stopped THAT leak.

 When I reassembled the magilla, and got fuel, the *same* symptoms as
above happened. I had not done a good enough job pushing hoses back on.

 If my memory serves me, there are 3 holes on the top-front of the tank, two
on the passenger side and one on the driver side. You can reach in and feel the
&quot;T&quot; joints going into the tank. Next time you fill-up, go Full-serve and
bring a flashlight. Look behind the front wheels into the bowels of the
fuel tank asembly. As you fill the tank, you will *see* the leak on the right
of left side. You can then figger out what to do. I shoved my hand in and
pushed the vent-hose back on correctly.

  BTW, my family has resigned themselves to me fixing NuBus. NuBus will
live once more!
