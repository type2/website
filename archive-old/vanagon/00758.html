 that is, the dimensions of the hole are 71mm x 38mm (2-13/16in x
 1-1/2in). but the front edge of the hole is 203mm (8in) below the top
 edge of of the luggage area trim panel, while the rear edge of the hole
 is 210 mm (8-1/4in) from that same edge. the hole is slightly tilted.

 the notch is cut in the bottom to accomodate those three bolts that
 hold the retractor assembly to the metal of the body.

also notice that this does NOT say anything about those 1986-1989
vanagons with air conditioning. the upper belt guide attachment point
will be behind the air conditioning housing that runs vertically over
the D-pillar. so you would have to cut a hold in the plastic a/c
housing to pass the belt through. (it helps to look at a 1990 or 1991
model, to see how the factory installation looks). in order to prevent
damage to the belt, the little plastic edging (that covers the edges
of the hole in the a/c housing) will have to be installed.
