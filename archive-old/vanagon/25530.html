&gt; Personally, I like pyrotechnics, from firecrackers on up, and have done
&gt; stuff with them a lot. My concern arose from the vision of what I would
&gt; have done myself, if I saw this post, with the complete list of ingredients;
&gt; and didn't know what the result would be. If I had some time, I might
&gt; have tried it, just to see what would happen. This is what I wanted to 
&gt; prevent
&gt; in someone else... belatedly.

Agreed.  Your warning was very appropriate.

I tried some stupid things as a teenager.  Gunpowder with 
various oxidizers was a favorite.  I was very lucky.  I saw a friend 
blow his hand up good with a dry-ice bomb, and one friend shot a 
metal pipe in the air which went through an old lady's roof!

But you are right; anyone who is intellegence impaired, given the 
wrong information is prone to hurt themself and others.
