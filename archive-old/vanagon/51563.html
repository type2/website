Subject: 86 westy-good price?

Hello volks,

What is a good price for an 86 westy GL(its the full camper not a
weekender).  Its in good shape ie: body straight-no dents, small surface
rust on front spoiler and inside front doors, 115K, interior very clean,
engine runs good. 

Also as this would be my first vanagon westy, what things should I be on the
look out for?  Any particular quirks or problems with this year or model?

Thanks :) 

Tom Jones
