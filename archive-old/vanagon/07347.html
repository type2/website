&gt;My 84 vanagon's steering seems getting heavier. This is not good ...
&gt;Is this a common problem or what? Or am I really getting too old? My 83 westy's
&gt;steering wheel is not as heavy but it has brand new tires on all four wheels.
&gt;I am planning a trip to Las Vegas during Christmas. I am worrying if I will
&gt;have the needed arm strength for the round trip.

if yours is a wolfburg edition with the power steering, you might be suffering
from a power steering pump failure.
