My fridge will generally keep the inside temperature at 34 degrees,
according to the thermometer.  What generally keeps fridges from getting
this cold is lack of air circulation both inside the fridge and over the
fins on the outside of the fridge.  With adequate ventilation, the fridge
should be able to cool more than 40 degrees below the ambient temperature
(although it will work hard to do it).
