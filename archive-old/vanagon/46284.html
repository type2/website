Subject: Re: Firearms and Inuvik?

&gt;VanBondo...&lt;snip&gt;...had a random thought go off.

If you follow the basic safety rules, such an AD (accidental discharge)
won't occur. ;)

&gt;Let's suppose &quot;someone&quot; wanted to pack while on the Alaskan Hwy. Let's also
&gt;suppose that it's illegal to carry firearms into Canada.

Last time I was to Canada, handguns could NOT be brought in, but long guns
could be.  I suspect that concealed carry is outright prohibited, since the
Canadian govenment is more paranoid of citizens with firearms than Teddy
Kennedy and Charley Shumer combined.
 
I've got a compendium of US state and fed gun regs, but it doesn't cover
Canada. [They're still resisting annexation, but I bet we could get the
Quebecois to join if we hold off on the English First legislation and let
them have their own &quot;en francais&quot; state. ;) ]

Try posting to rec.guns and rec.hunting.  There are many Canadians who read
those newsgroups who would be glad to give you current info (there were some
changes in the last few months, I believe).  The rec.hunting group includes
Canadian outfitters who routinely deal with hunters who are bringing in
their personal firearms to the various provinces.

&gt;How does &quot;someone&quot; get the weapons (protectors of the ass) into Alaska?

Smuggling them through Canada is the WORST way to go.  In some areas, the
local gendarmes and magistrates can be REALLY nasty with scofflaws. (Even
worse than a Flatlander in a Cheesehead speedtrap.)  It could result in a
long-term stay as a guest of the Canadian government.  Also, to some LEO's
the combination of a VW van and a firearm screams &quot;free-lance pharmaceutical
distributor!&quot;  One could then expect a total disassembly of the vehicle to
search for contraband.

If an hypothetical person wanted the firearms in Alaska *only*, then
shipping the gun via common carrier can be done between FFL (Federal
Firearms License) dealers in the respective states.  The weapon could be
awaiting the owner's arrival in Alaska, which is relatively unrestrictive in
its firearms regulations.

It might also be worthwhile, to ask what the Canadian reg's are on Bear
Repellant, a.k.a. pepper spray.  The large size canisters can be very
effective, even on non-Ursidae species. ;)
