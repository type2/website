Subject: Re: Owner's Manual for '73 Westphalia?



&gt;
&gt;Does anyone have an owner's manual for a '73 westphalia they would be
&gt;willing to photocopy for me?
&gt;The utility of some of the contols still eludes me.  For example, there is
&gt;a round knurled knob on the center of the front seat frame (drivers side
&gt;only) that seems to tighten a rod against the back of the seat frame, but
&gt;which seems to have no effect.  Also, there is a knob on the floor of the
&gt;bus, next to the front right corner of the driver's seat.  This knob is
&gt;connected to a (sticky) bowden cable that runs through the floor of the
&gt;van.  Is this some sort of heater/fresh air control?  At first I thought it
&gt;might be a manual choke, but the van has an automatic choke, so it isn't.

	Knurly knob is for seat back rake adjustment.
	Little knob for flap valve to distribute warm
	air into main compartment, (through those
	slots at the back of the area between the front
	seats). The wire gets rusty, the flap gets rusty,
	and the paper/aluminum hose (under van) gets
	holey. You can free up everything with penetrant-
	lubricant, try getting it down the wire from under
	the drivers seat, (through holes in the sheet metal
	box that the seat rails are attached to).
