&gt; So why does my van die when out in the rain? can be driving along nice

&gt; just sucks, will have to pull over because of a loss of power, keep
&gt; revvvving the engine and it might come back to where it sounds like a
&gt; normal engine, other times it just drops like someone turned the key
&gt; off(although this only happens when my wife drives it?)
&gt; 
&gt; Just had a tune up, that got me new plugs, new filters, new cap n rotor,
&gt; and $100.00  less in my pocket.
&gt; 
&gt; Any suggestions appreciated.

Mine does the same thing.  (83.5).  I am guessing it is bad wiring
harness.  Either main or air-flow sensor.???
