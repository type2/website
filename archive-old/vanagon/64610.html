Subject:      Re: Heat Exchangers replaced by VWoA

My suspicions were apparently correct. List members have revealed that
there are numerous people doing the work. So far we have the names of
Hans Gelke, Mr Anderson and a VW Dealership Employee. Tomorrow my heat
exchangers are scheduled to be replaced by a fellow by the name of Nick
who is coming to my neck of the woods to do the work at a local VW
Dealership. I initially contacted Mr LeCoz in June to make arrangements
to get in on this program. I'll let you know how it comes out tomorrow
