doesn't seem to make much difference, does it? brand-wise or octane-wise.
so what i see is that buying the higher octane is just wasting money. i'm
not finished with getting the 89 and 92 octanes into closer numbers of
gallons, but i don't expect it to change much.

a couple of things to consider (since you can't really take this data at
face value):
1. why so much shell? cause it is the closest station to my house.
2. there are only three (3) gasoline suppliers in this town. they all
   provide gasoline to all stations. that is, you'll see a shell truck
   pumping gasoilne into an amoco station, and vice versa.
3. why only these brands? cause those are the only credit cards i have. :)
4. some weight must be given to the fact that BP and UNOCAL are generally
   (but not always) used for highway trips ... cause they are the closest
   to the interstate. likewise, SHELL and AMOCO and EXXON are closer to
   work, and would tend to be higher in city driving miles. i've tried to
   spread it around as best i can, but i'm pretty sure it's not very
   accurate.

since i got a 2nd car two years ago, the mpg has risen a whole 0.1 mpg on
average (cause i don't run the bus back and forth to work any more). so
that affects the averages.

also: technically, the mpg calculated is just totally wrong. i mean, when
i fill up with SHELL, i write down the mileage i just drove on the last
tank, and calculate the mpg. but the last tank was not likely SHELL. so
technically, that mpg belongs to BRAND-X (whatever was in the tank before).
but how much of BRAND-X was left in there? how diluted was the SHELL for
my next mpg calculation?

anyway, it got really screwy, and i finally said to hell with it. it's
averages i'm after, and hopefully it will smooth out in the long run.

hope it helps.
