&gt;&gt;is that for real? i thought that was just a myth ... put out by the tire
&gt;&gt;companies. do the little sticky beasties really eat tires and rubber hoses?
&gt;
&gt;I have read sometime ago about certain animals in Europe eating lower 
&gt;water hoses.  I guess when they are finished they have something to wash 
&gt;down the rubber.  Yum!
&gt;
I was always told that they go for the salty taste.  Anyone ever taste a
brake line?

When my dad and I used to go hiking, we'd drive in his bug into the
mountains past all the 4X4's that chickened out or couldn't keep going, and
park the car. Then we'd build a fence around the bug with a roll of chicken
wire we'd bring.
We never had a problem, but we were always being told of some other poor
soul who didn't know, and had to borrow a chain to drive down the mountain
without brakes.

I'd keep you in suspense, but why waste bandwidth?  The chain was for
fastening a log to your back bumper so that it would drag you to a stop if
you stopped driving down the mountain.

I never saw this, but I have heard about it from many people.  If anyone
wants to find out if it is just a backwoods myth,  I'll tell you where to
leave the car.  On the other hand, if it's not a myth, can you afford the
rad hose, fan belt, and brake lines?
