&gt; There is a brown wire leading from the wiring harness at the left of the

&gt; disappearing *down there* somewhere.  :-) 

if it's brown and it's german, then it's a ground.

&gt; I always thought it was a head
&gt; temp sensor that it was going to, but now looking at the Bentley's very
&gt; carefully, I can find no mention in the electrical diagrams of a head temp
&gt; sensor for my van.  Is there such a thing on my van?  If not, what is that
&gt; wire doing?  Whre does it go? 

bosch d-jetronic uses a head temp sensor. don't know about the other types.
