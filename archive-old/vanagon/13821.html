Subject: Kombi Konfusion

I have to apologize for this bastardized reply, but the digests make quoting
a pain.  Thankfully, the digests are a thing of the past, and I can now
reply normally. :)

Ok, my '67 is a Kombi.  It's got a 237 vin number, 3 windows on each side,
is/was a single color (a pale ivory/white), and doesn't have headliner clips.

The camper conversion, well.. I couldn't say.  My bus had a previous
owner that fancied himself a carpenter.. he had gone through the bus
covering it in this _ugly_ paneling from hell.  He covered the floor in
particle board, and had truly disgusting curtains in it. After I bought
the bus, I found that what wasn't wet rotting was dry rotting, or didn't
look right in the first place.  So, I proceded to remove the entire
interior. :)  It's now down to sheet metal throughout the entire bus.

The good news is that the rust isn't everywhere.. which I think is
remarkable for a bus that spent most/all of it's life in the Pacific
North Wet.  The bad news is that it needs a new inner/outer rocker
under the cargo doors, the first few inches of the cargo floor replaced,
floor pans, and the rearmost side cargo door.  The bus was hit once in
the passenger door, and the dog leg there needs to be replaced.  Someone
put a jerry can holder on the rear upper corner as well, so bondo will
probably become a necessity at some point of this saga. :(

Anyone know a bodyshop in the Seattle area that'll do a good,
inexpensive job?  (if there is such a thing)  I'm going to do the
sanding and painting (with the help of a relative), but I can't/won't do
the sheetmetal work.

My current plan calls for body work, sanding, complete repaint inside
and out (probablly going with a 2 color scheme like the deluxe models),
then the install of a '72-on Westie bed.  I'm going to add a fridge,
inverter, and a gas heater as well.  I believe that the engine
is shot, and plan to go to GEX or a similar outfit.  Tranny is still
good, but pops out of reverse occasionally.  I think I'll deal with that
one afterwards, however.

Someone mentioned about contacting the factory people at VW for
information.. does anyone have the address, people I need to talk to,
etc?  I'm very intrested in finding out the history of my bus.
I didn't/haven't seen a plaque in mine, but it could (at one point) been
a westfalia.  I doubt it, however.

I learned something else while scanning the messages, which was that
'67 busses have different gear ratios than other years.  Damn, I'm glad
I joined this list. :)

Thanks for listening to me babble.  Off to work!
