&lt;&lt; My '87 Syncro GL is a little bit difficult to get into 2nd gear when it 
 is cold (the vehicle and/or the weather).  After warming, it slips into 
 gear just fine.  What might I do to improve the ease of shifting? &gt;&gt;

Due to the cold in your area, I would strongly recomend synthetic lubes.
 Especially for the gearbox.  Using the Audi power steering fluid should help
the cold steering problem also.  Difficulty warming the engine in cold
weather is also caused by the low temp air being drawn into the engine for
combustion. Insulating the coolant pipes may not help much.  As the front
heater only draws outside air, another recirculation type heater like the one
under the back seat will help heat the interior.

Hope this helps some,
Dennis
