Subject: RE: drum brake adjustment


&gt;in regards to the poundy thing (there must be a name for it (I call it a
&gt;poundimiform, actually), i also have a pair of sockets in the appropriate
&gt;sizes, 3/4 &quot; drive, a slider breaker bar the same, also a converter to 1/2&quot;
&gt;so  i can use it with the 1/2&quot; ratchet or breaker bar, as the urge strikes,
&gt;but the poundymiform is cheaper to buy than that pile of stuff.

When an axle nut and I couldn't reach agreement, I went to a local welding
shop and had them weld a 3/4&quot; drive bit at right angles, to the end of a
five-foot long, quarter-inch wall mild steel pipe. Haven't lost an argument
with an axle nut since.   :^)

     &quot;There's nothing wrong with the economy-- plenty of jobs are
              available.  I have three of them myself!&quot;
