&lt;&lt; &gt; VW no longer stocks replacement nylon window slides.  All they stock is
a
 &gt; complete window glass with the aluminum bar attached with nylon slides as
 &gt; part of the aluminum bar.  This requires replacement of the entire window.
 &gt; 
 &gt; Does anyone know of a source for the nylon slides that will just slip in
 &gt; where the old ones fell out? I need them for my 88 camper.

I don't know what kind of line of B.S. some people are getting from their VW
dealers, but I just called up my local VW dealer and had them order 4 of them
(2 for each window) and they came the next day. total cost, under 4 bucks. (
actually, that was even too much for 4 itty bitty pieces of plastic IMO,
but.....)

took an exacto knife and took a little bit off each tab ( and my
finger.....there was blood everywhere....  :*&lt;(  boo-hoo... and tapped them
into place w/ a little block o'  wood and now my '84's windows lock again...
 :&lt;) 

On the '88's (?) up you don't need to cut any off the tab, I'm told. 

gotta big Band Aid on my finger....
