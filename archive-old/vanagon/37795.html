Subject: Sorry, Tires Again?

Hi,
I've got an '89 Westy and its got some 185/??/14 passenger car tires on it.
Not good, but they were on it when I got it a couple of years ago.  I'm in
the market for tires and I'd like to get something bigger.  Like 205/70's.
I know they'll fit, but aren't they too wide for my 5&quot; wide steel wheels.  

My Merc 300D has 6&quot; x 14&quot; steel wheels with the same bolt pattern.  Anyone
have experience with these on a Vanagon.

While I'm at it, what about shocks.  I need some.  What shocks are
recommended for a stiffer ride?

Thanks,
Bo Kersey
