Here in parts of Sandy Eggo, it all depends where the lane came from.
If you're driving on a four-lane road (Two in either direction), and
airbrains are driving side by side at the same speeds in the two lanes
going you way, there is obviously no &quot;fast&quot; lane.

If the road widens, and another lane opens up on the left, the guy
behind the leftmost slowpoke, will pull into the new left lane, and
continue on at the same speed as the original two slowpokes. So there
STILL is not a &quot;fast&quot; lane.

But if the two lanes gain another lane on the *right*, the guy behind
the rightmost slowpoke will pull into it, and accelerate up to a decent
speed. (And there was much rejoicing).

So, the moral of the story is: The RIGHTMOST lane is the fast lane.
Sometimes. Except when it isn't.    :^)
