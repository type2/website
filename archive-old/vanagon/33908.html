Subject: Re: 50's White-walls?

        Coker Tire is in Chattanooga, about 2 miles from my house.  His 
        politics (far right wing Republican) don't appeal to me but he 
        has sold my family tires for years.
        
        He has a division which specializes in antique/speciality tires 
        and they tend to be very pricey.  As a local dealer, he gets high 
        marks from me and others; I've never used the other division so 
        can't tell you much about that.  Mr. Coker is on the local County 
        Commission and restores antique cars.  He has a really nice 
        collection of pre-1920's vehicles.  Last week, we had his shop 
        align the EV front end.  The dealer referred us there which I 
        thought was unusual.
