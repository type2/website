Subject: 009 and carb leaks
Date: Thu, 1 Dec 1994 09:49:20 -0600 (CST)

I have what I hope is a quick little question.  I have a 009 dist on 
my otherwise stock 71 bus.  I hope I am right here:  there are two 
tubes coming out of the carb that I assume were for the stock dist.  
The PO 'plugged' these by putting a small section of rubber hose over 
each and then plugging the end of that hose with a screw.  In my 
never ending search to my idleing problems I was going to replace 
these and hope that it fixes what acts like an air leak.  Any ideas on
the best way to do this?  Thanks, Jim
