Subject: Canada trip

I purged the letter but this is to the person going to Canada from Nashville.
This is a long shot but if you have any interest in military airplanes, the
mother lode is in Dayton, Ohio at Wright Patterson. There is one of most
militry planes from the first to latest.
To take a dog in and out of Canada, you should have a copy of all shots and
vacinations. Most likely, you will not be asked for them, but have them in
case.
What kind of dog? Write me directly.
Tom Hubbard
