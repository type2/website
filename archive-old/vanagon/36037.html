Subject: Re: oil filter wrench

&gt;2) The Barbarian Method: get your big, ugly screwdriver, and ram that
&gt;sucker right through the filter, THEN start turning.  No way that thing
&gt;can resist your superior power.  Works best if you're lying directly
&gt;underneath the stuck filter when you hit it with the screwdriver.  ;-&gt;

        I hd to do this with my (recently sold) dodge when I first changed
the filter. The DPO had the bastard so cranked that I actually opened a
gash about 2 inches while pulling on the screwdriver. Once it broke and
started to turn, it went 3/4 of a turn before it was loose enough to be
done by hand. That PO was a real moron-all muscle, no brain.

Peace,
