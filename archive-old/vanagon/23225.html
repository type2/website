&gt; rebuilt engines. The question would be: what causes premature breakdown of
&gt; the valve seats? It is understandable that valve seats would go on a
&gt; engine with a fair number of miles but under 50,000 seems a bit low. Is it
&gt; simply luck of the draw? Are those with high mileage type IV engines doing
&gt; anything special? It was mentioned earlier that the engine should not be
&gt; &quot;lugged&quot; -perhaps that is one answer.....


     Probably not.  Lugging isn't good, but shouldn't cause that -- more 
like wear on bearings than valves. Valves -- and valve seats burn from 
too lean a mixture, or air leaks causing a lean condition, or too short 
of an exhaust pipe (not a problem on street vehicles). Valve seats break 
however, because, primarily, they were put in badly or shoddy materials.

    All is impermanent, but this too shall pass away, and the way of the
Samurai is death --- so speak your mind now, or forever hold your peace!
