Subject: RE: Cv bolts replace or not?

&gt;From: anon869_at_vt_dot_edu (Christopher Bridge)

&gt; I ordered boot kits today, but they didn't come with bolts.  Do I absolutely 
&gt; have to replace them?  I'm planning to start this project tomorrow.

In most cases, no.  You should replace the ones that may be damaged from using
the wrong removal tool or have been rounded in the bolt head.  It will make it
easier to remove them next time.  You should keep some on hand in anycase.
