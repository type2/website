 Alistair,

 va&gt; Jack, are you talking about the drain plugs/caps on the underside of
 va&gt; the van? 

 Those are the ones...

 va&gt; If you are, then matching the thread size won't be (I'm guessing) to
 va&gt; hard. I picked up a &quot;corrugated&quot; a plastic tube that directs the sink
 va&gt; dirty water to whatever receptacle under the van. It screwed right on
 va&gt; to the van, much to my surprise. I have seen similar tubes at RV
 va&gt; centres, so maybe a cap could be found...

Well, I haven't had much luck locating them (which is why I asked you
all 8) ). I've tried some of the local plumbing outlets but they just
look at me like I had 3 eyes when I told them it had a metric thread.
I've called some of the RV places but they haven't been much luck
either.

Maybe it's because you're in Canada (which had the good sense to go
metric long ago) that you had no problem finding something that would
bolt right up.  I suspect that you could find the caps at a plumbing
supply house with no problems as well.  Care to try for me?

Barring Alistair's help, does anyone else have any suggestions on
finding the caps in the US?

Jack
