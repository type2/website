Subject: Don't Buy This Syncro!!!
Date: Tue, 17 Jan 95 14:43:50 PST


With a sad heart, I recently said goodbye to my Syncro.  I recently 
traded it in to buy a tiny (tinny?) rice-burner.  After driving many
cars (golf, jetta, saturn, impreza, neon, samurai, etc) I came to
the conclusion that the Syncro has a most awesome suspension.  It's 
much quieter than any of the above mentioned vehicles.  Also, even
though there's lots of body lean, I could corner faster in it than
in either a Jetta /// or my new car, a ummm,  gulp, Suzuki Swift GT.

Well, maybe corner faster isn't quite accurate.  I could take certain
curves on my commute and local highway off-ramps at higher speeds in
the vanagon than in the above mentioned cars.

Anyway, why did I sell, instead of fixing it?  Well, here's what was wrong:

Head gasket leaking
leaking oil cooler (coolant)
noisy water pump
low (125psi) compression
clutch slipping
brakes soft and spongy
a/c contained no freon
no power with O2 sensor attached and running closed-loop
helicoiled oil drain plug leaked
tranny noisy
119K miles
------------
add these items up and you get Big Repair Bill


Also, the transmission did not come equipped with the differential lock.
My plan is to buy a Syncro Camper in the next few years, with the diff
lock and fewer miles.  They seem to come up for sale fairly regularly
here in the Bay Area.

I assume that the dealer will either wholesale it right away, or maybe let
it sit on the lot for a while, and see if anyone bites.  I doubt that the
dealer will fix any of the above problems, since none of them (except the
lack of freon and soft brakes) are apparent during a test drive.  The clutch
only slips when starting out on steep San Francisco hills.  The leak from
the head gasket is only visible when the engine is running, and then it's 
so slow, that you need to run at a fast idle for 5 minutes or so to get a
drip to come out onto the pavement.  At highway speeds, the coolant dribbles
out a bit faster.

I didn't feel comfortable about selling it to a private individual with
so many flaws.  I didn't feel bad at all about trading it in, though.

So, if you happen to be looking for a Syncro, and see one at Bob Lewis VW in
San Jose, CA (or any other car dealer) that fits this description, get it 
discounted:

1987 Vanagon GL Syncro
Titian Red (burgundy)
long scratch (with touch-up paint applied) on passenger side at rear
No differential lock (unusual, it seems)
California plates
Vin #???? (I can email to those interested)
No wheel covers, or non-stock wheel covers
Black 3-piece carpet mat in front
New michelin MXL tires (left rear is French, balance are Spanish)
black dash-mat (carpety thing to protect the dashboard)
Awesome kenwood stereo (pull-out am/fm cassette)
	graphic equalizer/amp by steering column, 6 speakers
119000+ miles

I feel really bad about getting rid of it, but not as bad as having another
$3-$4000 on my visa cards...
