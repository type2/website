&gt;  I poked around last night for a few minutes surveying what I will have to do
&gt;  to remove the engine from my '74 Westy. Can anyone tell me whether it is 
&gt;  easier to remove the engine and transmission together, as a unit - which would
&gt;  go more or less straight down -  or to take the engine out by itself - back 
&gt;  and down - . There doesn't appear to be much room behind the engine to pull
&gt;  it clear of the transmission input shaft. Has anyone tried it both ways?
&gt; 
If it is an automatic, you pretty much have to remove them as a unit,
since the torque converter is almost 4&quot; long, and makes it pretty much
impossible to pull it and the engine back to lover. If it is a straight
drive, Ithink either way is possible, but I would still say connected is
the easier way...
