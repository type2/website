&gt;&gt;        Now why the heck cant the BP just buy Mexican busses???!!! Probably
&gt;&gt;cheaper, and if they *really* want stealth busses, Mexican plates will
&gt;&gt;really make 'em look innocent. I dunno if the Mex. Government would be cool
&gt;&gt;with the idea, but it would certainly be worth a shot...
&gt;
&gt;Same reason we can't-- illegal to bring them into the U.S. Don't meet
&gt;federal standards for emissions, taillight size, restraints, etc.

wait a minute here!!! :)  this is our chance!!  somebody go down to mexico
and tell the mexicans about this ... tell them that they need to &quot;sneak&quot;
across the border in mexican buses!!! that way, the border patrol will think
they are other patrols!! and we get new-old buses into the states!! :)

of course, they'll have to get brand new buses and paint them up to look
rusty and damaged, ;)  ... that way, they can sell them to somebody on the
american side for a big profit.

yeah. i don't think it would work, either. :(
