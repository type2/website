&gt;&gt;I was heading West on I70 from Columbus towards Dayton, OH when I got a
&gt;&gt;glimpse of a LATE model bus (?!?!?!?!?!???).  It was heading east so I
&gt;&gt;only got a quick look.  The bus was a silver colored 'Loaf with a newer
&gt;&gt;looking silver Westy roof (Like on my Vanagon).  The kicker...this Loaf
&gt;&gt;had what I believe to be a radiator in the front.  A black grill about
&gt;&gt;four foot square.  This was not a retrofit add on?  Was this one of the
&gt;&gt;Mexico/Brazillian or somewhere else bus?
&gt;

sounds like you are describing a mexican bus, the busses that are
currrently FS in mexico sound like very much what you describe, it looks
like a bay window era bus except that the roof has been somewhat squared
off (looking kinda like a &quot;bricks&quot; pop up roof), has a black radiator
mounted on the front as well it has very vanagon-esque mirrors and impact
absorbing (is this the correct term) &quot;safety&quot; bumpers.

it is my understnading that these busses couldn't mean US DOT safety standards
