&gt; Sure sounds like auto tranny fluid to me.  If the torque converter

&gt; On the subject of refrigerant leaks, has anyone else noticed oil
&gt; weeping from the A/C high pressure line in evenly spaced spots along
&gt; the hose (about an inch apart, all around the hose) as if it were
&gt; designed to do this?

Refrigent lines, especially the high pressure ones will loose their 
resistance to diffusion of refrigerent through the rubber with age.  The 
oily appearance is a sure sign this is happening.  Eventually you will 
have to replace these lines.  No this is not a design feature, just a 
fact of deterioration with age.  Sort of like the human body with age.
