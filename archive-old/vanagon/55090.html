Subject: Re: '91 Vanagon engine fire

In response to the following:

&gt;How do you find out if you westy has had the recall procedure done?
&gt;
&gt;This fire thing is really starting to get to me!!.
&gt;
&gt;Charles Michaux
&gt;'91 Westy (37K)

Supposedly you can call VWoA and have they query your VIN# for known informa-
tion. If you purchased your Westy from an individual or a dealer, you should
ask them if they received a recall notice and, if so, was the work performed.

The person I purchased my Westy from just happens to be a German Stock Broker
who is not in the country very much - thus the vehicle with only 10K garaged
miles when I bought it. I have a call in to him, but he has not returned yet.

If you have ever had work done at a dealership, you can have them check the
records for you. Unfortunately I trusted VWoA to inform me if there was
anything I needed to know - that failed.

When I purchase a replacement Westy - believe you me, I WILL have my local
trusted dealership check all of the fuel related parts and replace any that
have been on recall or look worn in the least.

I too am concerned about this fire thing!

PS. The investigator did find 2 other similar reports of engine fire listed
with NTHSA as reported by the owner/investigator of 2 Westies. One was in '91
the other in '94. The one in '94 was almost identical to mine -

drove 2 miles, heard a pop (in mine the driver noticed the engine miss), and
then noticed flames coming from both wheel wells. total loss.

Perhaps there are only a few real incidents, but when it happens to you it is
VERY PAINFUL to watch your beautiful Westy burn to death and know there's
nothing you can do but cry!
