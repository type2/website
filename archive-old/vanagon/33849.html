&gt;
&gt;&gt; there!), while I was fishing years back.  We weren't catching anything,
&gt;&gt; while he pulled all kinds of fish (well, trout, actually) out of the water.
&gt;&gt; As he was leaving, he suggested I try spraying the worms with WD-40.
&gt;&gt; Didn't have any with me, so I couldn't.
&gt;
&gt;Maybe a Utah Urban Legend?  I've heard it, and tried it last summer
&gt;too!  We were trolling on Yellowstone Lake last summer using those
&gt;little tripple teasers.  I shot them with some WD-40 to see what
&gt;would happen.
&gt;
&gt;Final results:  I caught lots of trout with or without it!
&gt;
&gt;Reasons:  Well I doubt the WD-40 could help in this situation.  I
&gt;understand the fish bite the triple teasers because they glitter, not
&gt;because they are shaped like little fish.  I doubt they could smell
&gt;the WD anyway since they are moving along fairly fast (unlike a worm).
&gt;
&gt;I think a new experiment is in order!

WD-40 works well for bottom fishing with bait.  The attraction is the oily
film that lures the fish, like a natural bait would produce.  WD-40 is
outlawed in the State of California for fishing, as well as a lot of other
effective methods of catching fish.  I always carry a can in the Westie
weekend fishinwagon, strictly for maintenance. ;)
