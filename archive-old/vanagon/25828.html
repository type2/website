Subject: FS: 30 Vanagon Seats

MediVan has about 30 center two person Vanagon seats
with seat belts available to the highest bidder(s).  These
seats were removed when their 30+ Vanagons were still
new so these seats are in excellent condition.

MediVan would like to sell them all at once or one by one
as long as the buyer(s) pay the shipping.  I believe all have
head rests, flip forward backs and most are grey fabric of the
'87, '88, '90 and '91style.  There are some blue and beige
from '84 and maybe '85 Vanagons.

Sorry, they don't any other style of seat available.

All those interested please e-mail me with their offer,  how
many and what color and I will communicate it to MediVan.
If you know of others that may be interested please let them
know as well.

Thanks in advance   :-)
