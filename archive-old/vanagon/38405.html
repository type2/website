Subject: Weird engine sounds!?!

My engine is making weird buzzing noises, and I was wondering if anyone 
has any suggestions of what it might possibly be...it sounds like as if 
you were to blow on a piece of thin plasic, there is a vibrating noise, 
so fast that it just sounds like a high pitch buzz.  This happens when I 
get to about 2-3 mph past where I was supposed to shift, for example, I 
usually shift to third at 20mph, but if I get to even 23, then this 
buzzing begins, and as I slow down, it gets louder...then it just goes 
away...it happens around 23, 37, and 55mph
It is a 1971, if it matters any...any insight would be appreciated...thanks
Dallas
