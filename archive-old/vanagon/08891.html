&gt; A couple of days ago someone mentioned that hormones that might be 
&gt; eaten in treated turkeys revert to their &quot;component proteins&quot;. NO, 
&gt; NO, NO! These things do (sometimes) get chemically modified by the 
&gt; metabolism processes, but for the most part, they get pissed away - 
&gt; they're steroids, not proteins - that's how they do steroid drug 
&gt; testing on athletes, as the steroid (sometimes modified) comes out 
&gt; the other end.

I always thought that the only thing of worry about Turkey consumption 
was the presence of the amino acid L-tryptophan (sp?) in large 
quantities.  L-tryptophan tends to make people fall asleep--so if you 
became sleepy after Christmas or Thanksgiving dinner, perhaps it was the 
Turkey, not the company you were keeping, that was to blame.
