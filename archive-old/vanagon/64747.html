Subject:      Re: Shrinking Parts

My '87 Westy has the same problem and I've been bugged by it ever since
I've owned it.  I would venture to guess that all Vanagon Westys have the
same problem and I sure would like to find a solution.  The idea someone
had of glueing in pieces to fill in the gaps sounds fine but where can we
get the pieces of trim ?  Junkyards ?  Westfalia ?  Does anyone know of a
source for these trim pieces ?  How about a collective complaint letter
campaign to Westfalia ?  Personally, I think Westfalia should come up
with fix to get back their previouly good reputation, with me anyways !

Cheers

Frank
