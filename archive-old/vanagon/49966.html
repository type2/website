Subject: Syncro shifting, &amp; belt noise



My '87 Syncro GL is a little bit difficult to get into 2nd gear when it 
is cold (the vehicle and/or the weather).  After warming, it slips into 
gear just fine.  What might I do to improve the ease of shifting?

Also, a new water pump did not cure the squealing coming from that area 
when the engine is started cold.  Yesterday I changed the belts (first 
time for me); how tight should they be?  I could not find the recommended 
deflection in Bentley.  Could a properly adjusted belt still make noise 
when cold?  Any hints on how to adjust their tension are welcome.  It 
carried us 100 miles in the snow today, so I at least installed them well 
enough to operate the van.  

Lastly, does anyone know of modifications that would  make the Vanagon a 
more Fairbanks winter-capable vehicle?  It has a good grille cover, and 
that helps keep the coolant warm enough at -10 to make the defrost 
effective.  But if it gets much colder that that, it never warms up, is 
difficult to steer and shift, and while this keeps the mileage down I 
would rather be able to use it more often in the winter.  Building a wall 
behind the front two seats to trap heat hs been suggested, as well as 
insulating the coolant and power steering hoses along their long journey 
to the front of the van.  

Thanks for any suggestions.  Winter is here, and the studded tires are 
going on tomorrow...

By the way, I have forgotten who sent me the brake bleeding procedure, 
but it went smoothly.  Thanks!
