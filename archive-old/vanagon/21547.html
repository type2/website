Subject: 1954 &amp; 56 Deluxe FS in Toronto

Hi,

to all those people that have a hankering to tinker with reaaaaaaaaaaaaaly
old busses, here is  a good opportunity (the fellow wants to sell the 54'
and 56 busses as a package i.e. together)

*discalimer, i have no affiliation with the seller other than talking with
him on the phone. I have only seen the 56' in person (at dusk) and haven't
seen the 54' in person, so please bear that in mind)

1954 23 Window Deluxe (serial number unknown). Bus is in primer &quot;ready for
paint&quot;, body work has been done and all rusted panels cut out and new metal
welded in. Bus is complete (according to owner) and is only missing

*clock
*front and rear floor mats

otherwise complete 54' Deluxe

1956 Deluxe serial number 198 949 (i think) this sucker is really
rough!!!!!!! plenty o' rust, but all trim is there, interior prety much
gone

also had lots of misc. trim, glass, rims metal weld in panel etc. etc. etc.
(other parts too from a 67' deluxe)

He is asking $6,000 CANADIAN for the whole shebang. If you want to talk to
him, his name is Pablo Garcia

your questions
