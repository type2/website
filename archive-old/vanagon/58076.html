Subject: Where's the hubcap?  F

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;   WHO HAS THE  HUBCAP?
&gt;    In Germany, the young assistant pastors do not live in the
&gt;    main rectory.  That is reserved for the Pastor and his
&gt;    housekeeper.
&gt; 
&gt;    One day the pastor invited his new young assistant pastor
&gt;    to have dinner at the rectory.  While being served, the
&gt;    young pastor noticed how shapely and lovely the
&gt;    housekeeper was and he wondered...
&gt; 
&gt;    After the meal was over, the middle-aged pastor assured
&gt;    the young priest that everything was purely professional
&gt;    and that she was the housekeeper and cook and that was
&gt;    that.
&gt; 
&gt;    About a week later the housekeeper came to the pastor
&gt;    and said, &quot;Father, ever since the new assistant came for
&gt;    dinner I have been missing one of my hubcaps from my beloved
&gt;    Volkswagen. You don't suppose he took it, do you?&quot;
&gt;    The Pastor said, &quot;Well, I doubt it but I'll write him a letter.&quot;
&gt;    So he wrote, &quot;Dear Father, I'm not saying you did take the
&gt;    hubcap and I'm not saying you did not take the hubcap.  But the
&gt;    fact remains that it has been missing since you were here
&gt;    for dinner.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt;    The young assistant received the letter and he answered it
&gt;    as follows: &quot;Dear Father Pastor, I'm not saying that you do
&gt;    sleep with the housekeeper and I'm not saying that you do
&gt;    not sleep with the housekeeper.  But I do know for sure
&gt;    that if you slept in your own bed you would find the hubcap.&quot;
