Subject: Re: Westy/Vanagon parts sources

&gt; &gt; Syncro is VW's term for their all-wheel-drive system.  In the USA VW began
&gt; &gt; selling Syncro versions of Vanagons &amp; Quantums.  Although they were both
&gt; &gt; called Syncro by VW, the Quantum actually used Audi's Quattro system.  Other
&gt; &gt; than both of them being all-wheel-drive, they have nothing in common.  Since
&gt; &gt; then VW has had Syncro versions of numerous models, but none of them in the
&gt; &gt; USA.  :(
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; The Vanagon Syncro was sold in the USA in model years 1986, 87, 89, 90, &amp; 91
&gt; &gt; in both regular and Camper versions.
&gt; 
&gt; Do you mean that a model was called Vanagon Quantum or was it called 
&gt; syncro, the audi version?

The Quantum Syncro was a US only version of the Passat, and used the 
Audi quattro awd system, but was not sold in Canada (none of the 
Quantum's were, to my knowledge). Then later, the new Passat G60 
syncro was sold in Canada, using the Corrado engine, but I'm not sure 
of the origin of the awd system. I don't think this model was sold in 
the US, but I can't be certain.

Confused yet?...
