Just got in LATE last night from the Farmington VW show/ swap meet/VW
drag racing event. It was great, although the busses weren't too strong
in presence. Actually, my friends and myself accounted for about 1/2 the
split window delegation. Especially noteworthy were a friends pristine
'67 deluxe, which of course won first place. His '64 bug also won first
place in the bug class. I suppose it really helps to own your own body
shop... :) Also interesting was the '60 panel van, with cargo doors on
both sides. The fellow had recently imported it from Arizona, and the
body was near perfect. There was almost NO rust, and only a small dent
on the nose. There was a '59 double cab, but it was in pretty rough
shape, as was the '68 single cab. 
     Ialso talked to a guy with a '66 kombi, who had stuffed a '75
Westfalia interior into it, and put a '74 sundial long pop-top on top.
He hadn't added any roof reinforcements, and still slept up there with
no problems. A very rugged machine...
    I got a all-metal crew-cab sized roof rack for $50, which I was
rather pleased with, so now I have a place for a spare tire finally. 

    Anyway, I had a great time. It was only $5.00 to get in, and was a
lot of fun. The next one is somewhere around the 9th of April, so more
of us should go...
later
