Subject: Re: Odometer rerpair, 1985

&gt;Help!  My odometer is frozen.  I think it is related to the trip meter
&gt;which, when you push the button, clears to zero, but then only moves 1 to
&gt;2/10ths.
&gt;Can someone share your experiences about fixing this problem or replacing
&gt;the unit.  Junk yard? Rebuilt? If you have to replace the unit, can I swap
&gt;for a tach unit also? (Mine has an analog clock).

Bill,

I don't know if you want to spend the bucks, but I've heard of a speedo
repair place in Southern Cal. Let me know if you're interested and I'll
send you their info.
