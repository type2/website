Kyle, I want to blow 5 liter mustangs off the road from a standing start as I
pull my 35 foot travel trailer, uphill.!!!!!

ok, ok, I'll be satisfied to just be able to keep up with traffic pulling a
row boat.

Kyle you MUST keep us posted on this engine deal.  Please, please, please.
I've known for years that you could hop up the engine, but you were on your
own to find and/or build parts, it's good to see someone respond to what I
have always figured was a definite market.

If you have info you can send me, e-mail me and I'll send you my snail mail
address.

re: disks rotors, and the rear.  I've got a set of new rotors for the front of
my Syncro, and a set of loose rear trailing arms from a 2 wh dr..  Sure looks
like the rotors will &quot;bolt&quot; right on in place of the drums back there.  The
problem then becomes one of securing the calipers, and I can't imagine that
would be to hard to do.  I'll try to pull the drums tonight and see if this is
do-able.

  The Larger discs are being &quot;created&quot; for the 2.0 Longstroke engine
stall that will be offered before the end of the year!!!!!!!!
