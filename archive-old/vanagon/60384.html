 BatSubject:     Weekender package uncomfortable, help  5/23/97    8:57 AM
Hi, 

Both my  original '90 Carat (rolled in 1995) and now the '89 Syncro have the
fold down rear seat.  (Weekender package? I guess that is what it's called)
We've tried camping several times over the years and been very uncomfortable. 
The seat seems just not made for comfort when folded down for sleep.  

Any one got any suggestions of how to / what to do to make it a bit more
comfortable?

Other problem was the lack of ventilation.  Rain in the Badlands makes for a
muggy night, and since we don't have screens on the windows, we can't open
without the nightlife intruding. (bugs)  Does anyone know of screens made for
the standard Vanagon window, or has anyone made some?

I've also thought that I could hook up the ventilation/heater fan to a deep
cycle battery with an extra dropping resitor.  This could get the fan running
at low speed, and might help with the ventilation/air movement.  Anyone done
something similar?
