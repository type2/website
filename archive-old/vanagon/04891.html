Subject: Re: 2 year no-cost maint?

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I just took my EuroVan in for its 15K mile maintenance.
&gt; My dealer is saying it is $135.  My recollection is
&gt; that the '93 Eurovan had a 2 year no-cost maintenance
&gt; package.  Is this true?

	Don't know about the package, but my 15K maintenance ran me about
$20.  All it needs is oil change and lube.
