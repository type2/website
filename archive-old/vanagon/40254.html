Subject: Eurovan cracked seems
Date: Mon, 22 Apr 1996 11:38:39 -0400

I seem that there is recall on Eurovans for cracks in seems somewhere around the front doors.
Does anybody have a copy of the recall letter?
Does anybody know if this recall includes other cracked body seems?
On mine I have rust bubbles and a crack in the seem between the left rear fixed window and the
left center fixed/sliding window.

Needless to say this a very disturbing observation on a vehicle that is 2-3 years old and never
been hit in that area (yeah all right I rear ended another car but did not bend any frame etc.)

Does anybody have a comments on success with getting the other seems repaired?
