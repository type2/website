Subject: Pilot bearing replacement tips?

Thanks to all who offered advice on my '88 pilot bearing troubles. 
&gt;From the number of responses I got, I'm fairly certain the pilot 
bearing is on its way out, although it seems to be in remission right 
now.

For when I finally find the time to pull the tranny, are there any 
tips to replacing the pilot bearing? The Bentley shows a few special 
pullers, etc, so I'm starting to get worried...

Thanks for all your help so far.
