Subject: Re: sliding door cover plate-baywindows

In a message dated 96-03-11 00:00:21 EST, you write:

&gt;Above the sliding rails for the side door on the baywindows is a 
&gt;cover plate.  It's held in place by two screws.  My question is, 
&gt;after these 2 screws are off, how do you remove this plate?
&gt;There is one on the opposite side of the bus, too.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,

You remove this cover plate by gently prying out the bottom side of the plate
so that the screw tabs clear the screw bases (paying very close attention to
the forward tab).  While gently prying, lightly bang the plate upward with a
RUBBER hammer.  Installation is naturally the reverse of removal.  You will
most likely find rust under this cover.  If your planning a restoration, you
may want to have a rear quarter window gasket in hand before you get started
on this.
