&gt;When is the next swap meet gig in the east, preferably southeast.
&gt;
&gt;jason

For those who don't already know, the next big show in the southeast
is the 3rd Annual Vintage Volkswagen Show &amp; Shine.  It will be held at 
Southern Tech in Marietta, GA on June 25.  All air-cooled Volkswagens 
are welcome (sorry water-pumpers, you have to park with spectators).

Last year we had about 30 split buses &amp; this year we want to get over
50.  If you have a bus, we want you to drive it, tow it, push it, or 
whatever it takes to get it here on the 25th.

If you have any questions or want me to mail you a flyer, drop me a 
note at deasterw_at_st6000.sct_dot_edu.

If I find out you have a bus, live within 250 miles, and don't show up
I will find where you live and come to your house and pee in your roses.

Dave
