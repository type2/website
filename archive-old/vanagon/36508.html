Subject: '78 Westy vs '88 Westy ?

I now have a tough decision to make between two nice Westies (or 
maybe neither):

1&gt; a '78 with 37K on rebuilt engine, 137K total. New paint, interior 
original and complete but in poor to fair shape. Paint job of average 
quality only (ie: poptop painted, but failed to remove seal first...)
Will need: 4 new tires, poptop seal right away. Canvas, brakes and 
shocks will need attention soon.
Calif. bus, so no major rust (or *very* good body work to hide it)
Drives well, clutch feels good, throttle &amp; trans linkage good. 
Steering feels tight, but shocks may be gone, as it dips &amp; leans a 
lot. 3rd owner, but has all receipts.
Asking price $5800 CDN, may get it for $5000-5500
Add in $500-1000 for new parts needed = $5500-6500 CDN

2&gt; an '88 with 320K total, 160K on new engine, trans &amp; driveshafts. 
One owner, all receipts. Looks immaculate, new tires, new paint on 
front section.
Have not driven yet, so can't say much more.
Needs new poptop seal.
Asking $9995 on dealer lot, would offer maybe $8000 if it checks 
out ok.
Total price, maybe $8000-8500 incl new parts needed.

So, my questions are:
1. I like the '78, but I'm having a hard time believing it's worth 
only ~$3000 less than one 10 years newer. Does this seem a bit high 
for a '78?

2. I would buy the '88 mainly to get more space, a 3 way fridge, and 
better hwy driving. My thinking is that when the heads/gaskets go, I 
would spend the $2000+ on a conversion to a Jetta 4cyl engine, either 
gas or turbo diesel, instead of putting more money into a poor engine 
design. Is this sound logic? How hard is it to find the engine 
mounts, tranny, etc from a diesel van to complete this conversion? My 
thinking is that $1000 will buy a very good used or rebuilt 4cyl engine, leaving 
another $1000 to complete the conversion.
(I know the above topic's been discussed a lot, I'm just wondering 
how feasible the idea is without going into the details.)

TIA.

Shawn.

I haven't lost my mind;  I'm sure it's backed up on tape somewhere!
