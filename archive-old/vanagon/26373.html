Subject: six cylinders, no waiting

There was a mostly-Porsche concours and swap meet this past weekend in
Princeton, NJ.  Great weather, great people, but no shark-like feeding
frenzy of parts buyers.  Consequently I'm now offering my 71 911 T engine
for $1k as is, $1.2k with 30 day no questions guarantee.  Also available,
at reasonable extra cost: the KEP adapter flywheel to put the engine in a
Vanagon, and a good oil tank.

Email for more info.

Interestingly, mine was one of TWO six-cylinder Vanagons at the swap meet.
The other was from the Baltimore area, and was literally done in one day
about four years ago.  There was also a six-cylinder 356 and a very enviable
Vanagon crew-cab from New York.
