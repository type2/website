In a message dated 96-09-27 04:23:02 EDT, you write:

&lt;&lt; This happened to me by using a rebuilt key.&gt;&gt;

Now we are  really getting down to the nitty gritty when the  vanagomers out
there rebuild keys!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

 &lt;&lt;... key didn't slip deep enough into the cylinder&gt;&gt;   ????

Is this a personal problem or what? You may need to see those key enlargement
folks who advertise in the sports section of the newspaper, for the less well
endowed.

OK OK enough Saturday Humor.....only joking Helmut.
