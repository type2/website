Subject: Autohaus, in Harrisburg PA, OK?

Has anyone on the list had service done at Autohaus, a VW dealer in
Harrisburg PA? That's where our '81 Campmobile was towed to for
service after the flex plate blew apart on the PA turnpike. They 
seem to have the regular dealer mentality - get it up on the lift,
put the replacement parts on as fast as possible, and get it off of
the lot. They don't seem to interested in trying to figure out why this
van is chewing up and spitting out flex plates at 1,500 mile intervals.
I could be wrong, but that's my impression. Anyone out there have any
repair experiences with this dealer? I'd like to hear, good or bad. Thanks!
Lisa
