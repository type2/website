&gt; It's still mostly a pleasant state.  We've got our fair share of gangs and

&gt; in L.A., New York or Chicago.  There has been only one recorded
&gt; freeway-retaliation shooting since the right-to-carry law went into effect
&gt; (around two months ago).

Only one freeway retaliation shooting in two months in one state?  You don't 
really think this is passable do you?  OK so maybe in Scotland you'd have to 
listen to the drunk until the police showed up but it was also be much, much, 
much more unlikely that he would have a gun.

Apologies if everybody was kidding.
