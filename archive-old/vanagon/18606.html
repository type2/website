Subject: RE: Roof Racks

check out the VW Trends or Hot VWs ads, I saw one in there that looked nice,
wood rack... maybe that was the $3 Wolfsberg West catalog... anyway, it sure
looked nice (but I've got a camper)

    I should like to get a roof rack for Ramona since this trailer plan seems
to be disolving as I learn more and more about the traumas I'd be subjecting
her to by forcing her into trailer slavery.
    Does anyone know of a local place I could shop for one of these??? (New
England) Is there a universal rack avail. thru some RV dealers, or do I have
to buy a custom rack? I didn't see one avail. in my Bus Stop catalog, nor in
the JC Whitney I've got. Are these just impossible to come across??????
    (You guys sick of my incessant questions yet???)   Rach
