&gt; All this talk about Brazilian busses has got me wondering about the 
&gt; busses currently manufactured in Mexico. I know that they are a hybrid 
&gt; of styles - 70's era bus body with water-cooled rear engine and front 
&gt; mounted radiator.
&gt; 
&gt; What I don't know is if that engine is the same &quot;Wasserboxer&quot; engine 
&gt; found in our late model Vanagons or (in typical VW fashion) some 
&gt; completely different design altogether?

I think it is a type I design with dual carburators.  I have scanned some
of Dave Black's pictures of this engine.  They can be had via anonymous FTP
at bolo.nosc_dot_mil, or on the World Wide Web at 

http://papaya.nosc_dot_mil/~schwarze/vw.

I have scanned in a few pictures from the Pfeiffer trip and they are
currently on the ftp site but not up on the web yet.  They should be there
in a few hours though.  I have another 40 pictures to scan, and I just 
received some photos in the mail today from Derek Drew of his synchro and 
hope to have them all scanned and available sometime next week.  Oh, and
the pictures on the FTP site are now stored in both tiff and interlaced
gif format.  The tiffs are full color, while the gifs are reduced to 256
colors and may not look as good on your system.  They are smaller, however.

Is anyone going to send me pictures from the pizza gathering?
