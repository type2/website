Subject: VW do Brasil on Web


Howdy Volks,

	as the subject says... here you go:

	http://www.volks_dot_com.br

	There are a few pictures of Beetles &amp; Splitties, and this nutty
truck that (as if I can read Portugese!) seems to be exported to Europe.
(Apologies if this has been covered before; I'm sooo behind on the lists
that I just deleted about 1,000 unread VW messages from my mailbox this
morning...)
