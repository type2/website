Subject: Safe highway speeds


I have recently purchased a 1979 Westfalia with the 2.0 liter motor 
and a manual transmission.  Becasue there is no tach, I have no idea 
what a safe, long trip highway speed is.  Can I cruise at 65 with no 
worries?  Can I go faster (downhill with a tail wind :) )?  Please let 
me know what you think.

TIA,

Matt
