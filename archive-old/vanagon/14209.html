Subject: WAIT! - was Re: cheap fix to vanagon hesitation problem (harness fix)

I just tore into the VW harness.  It's FAR MORE than one capacitor.

It may be that the tantulam alone helps or maybe solves some other 
problem but:

There is a PC board inside with an IC (probably an op amp) and 7 SMD's.
At least two wires are involved.  I'll post a GIF as soon as I draw
the schematic and decode what the SMD's are.

BTW - this thing does indeed make the engine run better.  Looks like it
may be worth the $75 it costs at discount.  At least I don't feel too
ripped off anymore ...
