Subject: RE: TDI Eurovan

Hi Everyone.  The 2.5 litre engine in the Eurovan is an Audi diesel 
power plant.  It has no turbo, and is not direct injection.  This 
engine was available in Canada as an option.  I believe it had around 
77 hp.

The TDI in the Eurovan will have 105 hp from what I have read.  I 
believe that torque is over 150 ft-lbs from a 1.9 litre power plant.  
I have some brochures coming from Holland on Westfalias and hopefully 
about the TDI.  I'll post specs when they arrrive.

Harry.

&gt; While cruising the VW dealers on the WEB, there was one in Canada, which
&gt; listed the Eurovan with a 2.5 diesel engine.
&gt; Hope that helps.
