I saw an interesting video on Discovery Channel's &quot;Invention&quot; once of a 
Bug being driven off a cliff. It rolled over a few times, then landed 
upright with nary a scratch on it. Buses were built much the same way, so 
that if they got hit, their convex shape just rebounded and reflected the 
kinetic energy of the impact. VWs, in fact, had some of the earliest 
safety cages...
