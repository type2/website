Concerning the GNATT and summer travel in general:  I will not have my
bus going much before July 1.  I won't even have the garage until June
1 and I still have the get the motor ordered, etc.  That said, I am 
touched by the personal mailings from people concerning the plight of 
my bus and my possible participation in the tour.  So, while you are 
darting about this summer keep me in mind here in the center of the 
country and do give me a call.  I can offer a porch for a beer or a 
bed for a nights sleep or a garage for a tuneup.  Lincoln is a pretty 
typical college town that is surrounded by several state lakes for 
camping or boating.  We are right on Interstate 80.  Jeez, I sound 
like the tourist office or something.  Anyway, you get the picture.  
The number is (402) 438-6599.  If that number changes with the move 
then just call my ever helpful father (JB Sr.).  He's in the book and 
should have my new number.  Jim
