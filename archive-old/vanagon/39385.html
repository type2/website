Subject: Re: Beckys' Drive In


&gt;Caron and i took Lief to the drive in last night.  In between shows we
&gt;made  popcorn (the little pie tin, foil covered Jiffy Pop one) on the 
stove.
&gt;
&gt;Try doing that at the Cineplex.


There's a company around here that sells popcorn to movie theaters,
7-11s, etc. It comes in individual packages called Naks Paks, which
include a measured amount of popcorn, salt, and *coconut* oil. Greatest
stuff on earth, especially combined with butter, and the six-ounce size
is small enough for my Stir Crazy.

Bring a medium-large aluminum pot in the Westie to the drive-in, toss
in a package of this stuff, and shake shake shake. Also bring a smaller
pan for butter if you want. In minutes you'll be surrounded by drooling
people with distended nostrils and bug eyes, and you'll get kicked out
for disrupting the movie. But it will be worth it!   :^)
