&gt; My immediate thought was flooding, so I searched in the Bentley book but
&gt; could only find &quot;Engine stalls when accelerator pedal is released
&gt; suddenly&quot; (page 3-12) but this obviously isn't it.

Usually the word &quot;stalling&quot; means the engine stopped running, i.e., you
had to use the key to start it up again.  I would use the word
&quot;bogging&quot; for your symptoms.

Could be the accelerator pump, which is a little pump on the side
of the carb which is supposed to deliver a little extra gas
when you step on the pedal hard.  It has a little diaphragm in
it which can get brittle or rupture, or it could need to be
set to deliver more gas.  Parts to fix it are included in
carb rebuild kits.  

Is the bus is basic good tune otherwise (timing, valves, etc.?).

Good luck!!!!
