&gt;Is this the engine that was used on many American fighters, such as the
&gt;Chance-Vought F4U Corsair, Republic P-47 Thunderbolt, Grumman F6F

Lots.  F3F3, F4F, TBM-Avenger, B-17, B-25, B-24, B-26, A-20
The B-29 had four engines, each engine had two banks of nine cylinders each.
That's a lot of cubic inches.
The P-47 had one engine, with four banks of nine cylinders each. (36cyl)
Take a bullet in a cylinder - so what?

Makes for a very interesting crankshaft, and a very distinctive sound...

Whenever I hear it outside my house I try to get to a door before whatever
it is gets away (we have contingents of the Confederate Air Force in the
region).  The last one that I caught was a DC-3.  Got to see (and hear)
Fifi (the last remaining flying B-29) at last fall's &quot;Wings Over Houston&quot;
air show...

The Kee (sp?) Bird story, about the B-29 sitting on the lakebed in
Greenland, was also in a Smithsonian magazine within the last year.  It's
not so much a story about the plane itself as it is about the obsessiveness
of the team leader...

A lot of planes had what might be considered fairly pedestrian V-12s (the
Allison and Rolls-Royce powerplants in the P-51, P-38 (two, turbocharged)
and Avro Lancasters come to mind).

If you want really weird - check out a WW-I vintage aircraft in which the
cylinders (and propellor) rotated and the crankshaft stood still...

The current Continental and Lycoming powerplants in many private aircraft
are a lot closer to what we see in air-cooled VWs than the radial
behemoths.  Hmmmm...
Who needs a Corvair when you could have an unmuffled Conti...  (cooling
might be a bit of a problem without that BIG fan :-).  And with the right
carburetor you wouldn't have to worry about running while inverted ;-) !
