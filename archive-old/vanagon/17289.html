&gt; &gt;It seems like the gas gauge is calibrated for a 16 gallon tank rather
&gt; &gt;rather than the bigger 18.5. Any other syncro owners notice this?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; I've had mine down so that there was only about a gallon left in the tank.
&gt; The gauge was pegged below the reserve area. When I touch the bottom of my
&gt; reserve area, it ususally takes about 16.5 gallons to fill the tank.

When my gauge touches the bottom of the reserve area, it takes about 6
gallons to fill the tank.  Stop complaining.  :)
