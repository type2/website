Best features:

floor, all jack ports work, new rear tires, strong battery, new front 
brakes, MD inspected within the last 30 days, rear seats in good shape, 
cot for front, working jack.

Worst features:

Hole in block with engine parts sticking through ( all the engine 
accessories are good though like the gen, carbs, ect.) Needs cosmetic 
intior and exterior work, no canvas on poptop or cot in poptop.

I want to get as much as I can for her, some guy came by and offered a 
thousand, then reliezed he couldn't afford that much, but he's still 
interested in her engine, all the accessories are new. So if your 
interested and want to make me an offer or have any questions let me 
know, thanks.
