&gt; Bakersfield, to orient you all.  OUrs will be Campsite #5, off
&gt; to the left on the road we take up to get there.  Please fill

&gt; of offroading.  As I mentioned, I'll be coming early on, but those
&gt; of you wishing to come later, may want to try and meet somewhere
&gt; ahead of time and do this en masse, especially with one of us
&gt; who's been to the stie before.

UGH!!  It's to your right as you drive up the road.  As you progress the 8
miles from 10 you'll see camping areas number... starting with 1... and
it'll work up 5. :)
