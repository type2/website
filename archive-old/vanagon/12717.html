Subject: Re: Accumulated Mileage

&gt; My neighbor's '84 Vanagon has just over 120,000 miles and has had the head
&gt; gaskets, water pump, expansion tank and muffler replaced. Other than that it 
&gt; has been trouble free and he is very happy with it. 
&gt;
&gt; Sami suggested that this collection of statistics not be limited to just 
&gt; wasserboxers so here's some more from my experience:
&gt;
&gt; '74 Westy  77K on first engine &lt;prev. owner&gt;, 108K on current engine.
&gt;
&gt; '72 Westy  Heads done at 95K &lt;prev. owner&gt; had 165K on it when I sold it.
&gt;
&gt; '64 camper Sucked the #3 exhaust valve every 40K, like clockwork! Sold at 
175K.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Best Regards,
&gt;
&gt; Dave
How about those air cooled ones out there!  C'mon you guys, speak up.  Just 
imagine, I'm sitting here rebuilding my engine with the greatest of care and 
making sure everything is just right and boom, that topic of valve hungry 
engines comes up.  Why do VW engines eat valves?  My oldest brother's SQB 
ate one once, but I don't think he adjusted them much.  Dave, have you been 
adjusting those valves?

As a PS, I'm about 3/4 of the way finished with my rebuild, and if I could 
just get through the last week before spring break, I'd be set.  It should 
be on the road by next week.
