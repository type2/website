Subject: '56 Kombi Expense Report
Date: Thu, 12 Oct 1995 21:50:08 -0700 (PDT)


Here is the most recent version of my expense list for da bus.  I've 
forgotten some things, and I'll add them when I remember.  In fact,
I'm sure I've forgotten a lot of things!  Like off the top of my head,
the muffler, $125!

Some stuff appears twice because I bought it twice - usually the first
one broke or was the wrong one...

Anyway, for what its worth....
