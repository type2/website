I think before I send in another request I think I better introduce myself and the
the bus. Names Geoff, wife &amp; 2 kids ( as Alexis Zorbas says 'the whole catastro
phy', it is when they're screaming in the back), that one is for the oldies and 
cinema fans. Domicile N.E. UK, just outside ancient city of Durham, small village
ge overlooking 1000yr old Cathedral. So who needs sunshine when you've got 
history and culture.
	The van is an 82 camper, high top conversion, with 70,000 miles on the 
clock. Chasis Nr. VW2ZZZ25ZCH127361, engine stamped with CU138132, this is for 
Joel's database if he didn't get my letter.
	I do have a history of VWs, even goes back to a couple of split screens
in my hippy days.
	Back to present problems. I've looked around and read a lot of the stuff
but I'm still little confused as to whether it is ok to use unleaded in the bus.
At present I use leaded and no problems. If I get the right octane fuel ( 91 I th
think ) will I be ok on unleaded alone, or should I mix, putting it in only 
every other tankfull. I know most of the stuff is on US imports, can anyone 
tell me are there any major differences between the European and the US engines.
Just point me to the page in John Muirs book if that is a stupid question.
	It's nice reading the stuff and I hope I can get to some of the rallies
next time I'm visiting relatives stateside.
	If there are any locals reading, please drop me a line, I want to compile
le a list of scrapyards I can visit.

	cheers
