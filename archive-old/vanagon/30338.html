Hi all
my wife and I just bought a '93 Eurovan and have taken it into Utah, around
Colorado, all that stuff. I was wondering just how many of these things are
out there. I haven't seen many on the road. If you have one what do you think
of it? I've been pretty into mine so far. Any probs I should expect down the
road (so far it only has 30K on it)?. Let me know......
