This was given in a report done in Southern Ontario (St. Catherines I 
believe) that IS on the net but I don't have a link to it.  Somebody posted 
the web address to this list (this is how I found it).  So maybe that 
person is still around and can dig up the address?

It was a very interesting report.  It dealt with the actual cost of owning 
a car (which drivers only pay a VERY VERY small portion of in gas/tire/etc 
taxes).  You'd be surprised to find out what gas prices would have to be to 
make car owners actually pay for the associated costs of having their car 
on the road.  These costs are paid from general taxes on all people whether 
they drive or not.
