        Reply to:   RE&gt;&gt;How to Steal VW Vans Quickly

Since we're on the subject of breaking into VWs and such, a few years back,
after my very *last* final (or so I thought, at the time), my brain was toast
and my mind was gone, but a couple of my housemates and I felt devious enough
to break into some woman jogger's Type III (same way as the busses, through the
wing window) that she wantonly parked in our parking spaces.  Seems she'd drive
up, park, go for a jog around the greenbelt, jump back in her car and drive
off.  
Well, some of us were getting a little steamed about the parking space thing,
so one day we break in, pin up a Playboy centerfold (I don't recall the
month/yr) smack dab in the center of her dash, and then lock the car back up
and wait.  Well, she gets back, unlocks the car, gets in and notices 
the fine calling card we left behind.  Long pause, takes it off the dash, looks
around nervously, then drives off, never to be seen again.
