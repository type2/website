Can someone tell me what a fair price is for an early '80s
Vanagon air box and wiper motor?  I'm in a relatively isolated
area, and have no access to either VWoA or a wrecking yard that
knows anything about such critters. 

Thanks.

PS:  I'm doing the selling, and don't want to shaft the guy.
     Last air box I bought was for a 911 and it was rather
     pricey.
