You might want to pop the fridge out and clean the coils, and check the 
ventilation.  My fan cycles off and on when I have it on full cool, and 
it's over about 75 degrees, especially if the refrigerator side of the 
westy is in the Sun.  Another thing you may want to do is put in a deep 
cycle battery to run the electrical auxillaries, even tho the 
refrigerator fan really  doesn't draw too much amperage. 

Good Luck
