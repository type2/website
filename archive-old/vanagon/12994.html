   Yup, '68 gas tanks came be installed in a '67.  I've done that.
It's not too hard.  After taking the '67 out and laying it beside
the '68 , it's pretty obvious what is needed.  Use the '68 sender
and all will be well.  If you put the '67 sender in the '68 tank, 
it will act as if you have a 14 gallon tank.  Which means you CAN
go an amazing distance after indicating empty.  Approximately 2
gallons worth.  I ran out of gas once with this setup, and vowed
to install the '68 sender the very next time the opportunity arose.
I sold the car to my brother before it did.  It had a very faithful
engine.
