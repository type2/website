&gt;   These are the tires that I am using on my '81 Westy and I like them. I
&gt;  originally chose them for their obvious price advantage and really
&gt;  wasn't too concerned about road handling charachteristics, and I doubt
&gt;  that I could evaluate them from that srandpoint. I practice 'low impact'
&gt;  driving in my van, which is: to drive slowly, anticipate sharp turns
&gt;  well in advance and never over estimate the performance of your VW
&gt;  Vanagon. Therefore I'm of the opinion that the Uniroyal tires seem to be
&gt;  plenty sufficient for carrying the weight of these hefty vehicles. To be
&gt;  honest I've read plenty of long winded rhetoric on the advatages of
&gt;  using the Michelins, Bridgestones, and Continentals, but I really don't
&gt;  see the advantages that justify their prices. It makes me wonder what
&gt;  sort of driving some folks are doing??? It's a Vanagon--it's sloooowww,
&gt;  under powered, handles like an aircraft carrier, and it likes being that
&gt;  way!

Much of the differences between tires can only be determined using careful
testing, but the test results can show considerable differences between
tires, especially in safety areas like handling, traction, &amp; braking - both
in wet &amp; dry conditions.  Testing like this is done on a periodic basis by
most major car magazines.  I can't say that the particular tire in question
is good or bad, but I'd say that cost as the primary determination of a
tire's value is short sided.

While you might drive very carefully, tires can play an important role in
your ability to avoid an accident.  Say for instance the best method to avoid
a child darting in front of you may be to stop as soon as possible.  From
35mph, stopping distances can easily vary by 10 feet.  The difference in this
case is just missing the child and hitting the child and dragging them for 10
feet.  If the best way to avoid a deer on a highway is to steer around the
deer, the differences between tires can mean the difference in having a
couple wheels run along the shoulder or your whole car going over an
embankment and rolling over.  The $100 saved on tires would seem pretty
inconsecuential at this point, no?  To think that an average driver could
&quot;feel&quot; these differences just by doing some normal driving on each set of
tires is just kidding yourself.  I'd get the tires that are shown by testing
to have the best traction and roadholding abilities and worry much less about
cost, comfort, noise, and treadlife.
