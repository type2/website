Subject: Trading time-'58 Ghia Coupe for a '56 Panel (w/ brake light)

Hi All,

I'm in a trading mood and am in search of a '55 or '56 Panel Van in reasonably 
good shape (good original paint/repaint, no rust, no cut wheelwells, and no 
major dings) with Cab Divider, either the original 36 horse or a 40 horse motor 
(must be running and driveable from wherever to Silicon Valley area) and 
working electrical with original taillights/turnsignals(or semaphores)/ 
headlights.  I've gotten permission from my In-Laws to use their old logo (H&amp;E 
BMW, Palo Alto) on this van as H&amp;E was one of the early BMW dealerships in the 
silicon valley area....the plan is to show this van and occaisionally use this 
as a working truck (and if I am lucky, my In-Laws may even let me park it in 
their BMW showroom to attract attention).

What have I got to trade?  I have a very straight 1958 Karmann Ghia Coupe with 
a 40 horse/tunnel trans driveline (great daily driver), original wood roofrack 
(wood slats are good but need restoring), Repro EMPI 5 spoke wheels AND the 
original wheels (w/tires).  I've put new reflectors in the taillights 
(coffin-shaped....  pre'60), repro cloisennet VW badge on the nose (nose has 
NEVER EVER BEEN HIT....  unbelieveable) and the interior was redone prior to my 
acquisition of this car....  It also has the original passing light relay (high 
beams flash every two seconds or so when you pull the turn signal lever back 
and hold it) that was put on European models, the baby diaper horn boot is 
original and in excellent shape, and the horns work. 

I'd really rather not let go of this car, but in order to have space for this 
next project of mine (and to preserve harmony and peace with my wife), I've got 
to do some housecleaning/horsetrading.....  My home # is 415-965-2599 or drop 
me an E note...  TIA

      Jon
