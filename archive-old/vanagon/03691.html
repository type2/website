Chris: Thanks for your advice which I think I will follow. The reason why
I chose the alternate spring/slash plunger in  the first place is because
the Haynes manual shows a grooved piston for both the 1600 and 2000
Vanagon air-coooled engines. If Bently confirms this (can anyone who has
the manual please respond?) then we can be pretty sure that the grooved
piston was stock and the straight piston (which GEX may have installed
&quot;accidently&quot;) I have can be replaced.

This may also be of interest to all those who are suffering low oil
pressure/high oil temps/loss of power etc.

BTW what kind of pressure/temp changes were you getting with your setup?

Thanks in advance - DC
