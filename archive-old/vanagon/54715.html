Subject: Re: Buzzing Fuel Pump

&gt; Hello,
&gt; 
&gt; 	I just found this list and have learnded quite a lot so far.  Maybe
&gt; someone has some insight into my problem.  I have an 85 Vanagon Camper
&gt; and about two years ago the fuel pump began buzzing(like a digital alarm
&gt; clock under the floor) when the weather conditions became very hot(i.e.
&gt; &gt; 90's).  It only occured under those conditions and usually would take a while to occur after the engine had been started and warmed up.  Early this summer the pump started to buzz in cooler and co
&gt; ler weather until it was buzzing all the time, right f
&gt; rom ignition.  It is now very difficult for passengers to sit back there comfortably.  I have hesitated replacing it because of the cost($199) and the fact that I have noticed no performance problem
&gt; .  Any ideas on other options or another diagnosis?
&gt; 
&gt; 	James
Two things: I think the design of the pump is such that the fuel acts 
to cool it, which may explain the noise in hot conditions. Also, I've 
seen /heard this problem on two different cars with similar fuel 
pumps (77 Rabbit, 82 Scirocco) where the noise was caused by rust in 
the fuel tank making its way into the pump.
