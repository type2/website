 We had a thread a while ago about several people not knowing about the oil
 filler extension tube on the Vanagon.  While camping at Yosemite a few
 weeks ago I met a Westy owner who did not know that the front seats
 revolve!  Any others out there?

I met someone who had a 1984 Westy since new.  They didn't know about the
nice storage box below the drivers side seat if it is not being used for a
second battery.
