Subject: Re: How do I put a Vanagon mtr in a late Bus?

Ron -

The only year of Bus Heater Boxes that will mount to the Square Exhaust Port
Vanagon Heads are from a '79 Bus.  Since you're in PA, I assume the Vanagon
exhaust is of the Federal variety, ie: CAT Converter IS NOT next to the left
valve cover, so the 79 Federal Heater Boxes should work.  Hard buggers to
find, but I have a few possible sources for good used:  Blair &amp; Sons in
Phoenix, AZ 602-243-1238, Russ' Recycling in So Cal 818-303-4366, Averre's in
Longview, WA 360-425-1119, Quantum Ent. in Portland, OR 503-760-8081, Sunray
in Dade City, FL 904-521-5660 or Recycle Auto Parts in Boulder, CO
303-443-2887.

The 2L motors of either model are otherwise basically the same (breather box
is different), so using the Bus Engine Tin shouldn't present a problem
although I'm sure that there will be little things here and there to slightly
modify.
