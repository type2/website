Subject:      In The Gutter

Hi,
Has anyone found a good replacement for the trim beading or molding that
fits on the edge of the rain channels along the roof (in black for my crew
cab).  Is it accepable to leave it off altogether and repaint the gutters
or will this cost me big points at the Vermont VW ass anual show.
Thanks, Lloyd
