Subject: BBTA/Maiden Voyage: 84 Vanagon GL

Hi Listernauts,

Just back from Buses by the Arch in St. Louis.  570 miles in the 84 GL 
brown Bus, smooth sailing.  18-21 mpg _at_ 68-75 mph.  No trouble keeping up 
with the I-70 traffic or barreling through a thunder shower!!!!!!  About 
70 Buses (at my guess) so far at BBTA, mostly newer ones.  It was really 
pretty neat, esp. the Caravan--about 50+ Buses all lined up and ready to 
cruise in the St. Louis heat.  8-)  Too bad we had to split early.  8-(

I guess I'm officially 'sold' after this Vanagon Wasserbeast experiment.  
It'll be my daily driver now and perhaps I can find time to work on my 
air-cooled projects.  My thanks to the list for enlightening me towards 
Vanagon ownership.  Heck, even my wife *and* mother-in-law like it!  8-)
