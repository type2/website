So Bren Smith says:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;And near the Tioga entrance to Yosemite, there was a '68 or '69 camper for
&gt; &gt;sell for $400.  My wife just said, &quot;Keep on driving&quot;...  :(  (insert puppy
&gt; &gt;whining noises here)....
&gt; 
&gt; I saw that one. It had Texas plates on it, and donuts in the back seat.
