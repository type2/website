Subject: 1987 Vanagon Question

Dan's list of potential problems to look for on a 1987
Vanagon looks familiar to this '84 owner.  I would add one
word (in the same vein as &quot;The Graduate&quot;)

              PLASTIC

Driver door pocket, front heater core cover, steering wheel
column cover, rear speaker bracket, instrument cluster
cover, instrument cluster base.

All of those on my '84 have cracked, broken or fallen off
entirely.
