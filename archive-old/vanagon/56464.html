Subject: Re: I'm a Thule Roof Rack dealer

Hello folks.

I try to stay out of the roof rack debate since I'm a Thule Dealer.  Since
I'm also a Westy owner and a sea kayaker, biker, etc I know the systems.  You
don't have to drill holes in your pop top with Thule.  I've sold this system
to a list member and you can take his word for it's performance.  Pluse
here's the deal to list members 10% off retail.  No tax, no shipping.  I drop
ship from the factory directly to you.  You must have a credit card since I
have a retail outdoor shop.    The shop is Life Tools Adventure Outfitters in
Green Bay, WI .  My name is Craig.  We're a North Face, Patagonia, Moonstone
dealer climber, hiker type shop.  We also sell Mad River Canoes etc.

Hope this helps.

Craig
