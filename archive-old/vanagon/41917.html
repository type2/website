Thought I'd announce that Stephen Connor Boleyn was born May 7, 1996.
He weighed in at 7 lbs 9 ozs, and measured 20 inches long.

Some of you may remember me carrying around a cellular phone at French
Creek, just in case my wife needed me--but she held off a couple
weeks!  And so a new family begins...
