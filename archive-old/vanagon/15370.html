Subject: GNATT West route?

	I hope to have Little Martha on the road by May- sheesh!
and so might spend a day or two with the GNATT if it passes by the
bay area. I haven't seen any route info for this leg though. I'm
too scatter brained to coordinate, so if someone will simply tell
me when the tour is passing by, and where it stops and starts, I
will try to connect.

	Speaking of tours, has anyone heard from that nice
Canadian couple with the vivid yellow breadloaf, the Copleys? 
Last I recall, they had returned from Baja and were headed east along
the Southern US.

	Cheers!
	Bill
