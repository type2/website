_______________________________________________________________________________
There you have it. My Van Idles Too Dern Fast.  To refresh my
memory, its a fuel rejected two liter.  It will idle slower if
I do something with the timing, but then my mileage goes south,
and I lose some peppiness.  I am actually considering paying
someone actual money to look at it :( 

Anywhay- ideas on the runaway train?  Checked my auxillary air,
the idle screw is _all_ the way in, throttle cable slack, etc etc.
Air Leaks?  How would I find these? 

My neighbors anxiously await an answer....

    I was trying to figure out my 2000 with a similar end in mind,
    my engine idles too slowly... it's not as easy as it was with
    my '69 bug Type 1 engine, spent some time with an oily copy
    of the Bentley manual. There are three or four things that
    need to be simultaneously tweaked. My son woke up before I
    could memorize them, much less try them out...
