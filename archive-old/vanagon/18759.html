Hi Martha,

Misty Mountain Van Club of the Northern CA Van Council sounds perfect!  I'm
here in northern Virginia and a big wanna-be.  I'm talking to anybody I can,
so...   Could you help get my ad in newsletters and on the Van Net? - and
relay any member or other Club addresses that I should contact?  My brother
is in Huntington Beach, CA, so combining a visit with shopping for a VW is a
possibility.

The basic info...  Wanted- trustworthy '90 or so VW Syncro poptop Multivan or
Weekender (camper OK).  Body, mileage, mechanics, etc. OK for everyday plus
travel use.  I'm in northern Va. but will travel for bargain.

Who knows?  Maybe I can someday go camping with your club?!  (I don't do
drugs- just love nature and people)

Thanks for any help or suggestions,
Tally-ho        ;-)
I'm not too smart about lists, etc., so maybe email me at
