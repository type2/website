Subject:      Eurovan AC

On the Transporters to the tunnel trip I saw a few EV's with a potential AC
problem (just like mine)

On EV's there is a receiver dryer (R/D) just infront of the right tire. Its
VERY CLOSE. Many at TBT had R/D's that were getting ready to fail. Heres the
problem:

The R/D has a safety valve that is EVEN CLOSER to the tire then the R/D in
general. On the early ones its a aluminium hex with a spring and valve
inside. Its job is to open at about 500 psi and save the rest of the system
from damage. But, since its REALLY CLOSE to the tire its subject to road
damage and corrosion. When it goes the whole AC charge goes with it.

Note: late R/D's have an improved valve (its a blow out plug)

I Called VW and they looked into it but only offered me &quot;at cost&quot; repairs.
Instead I made a stainless steel sleeve and epoxied it in. Still OK.

Another list member (Rick, I think) has another fix: the valve is same as
used on some Dodge cars (gasp!!) and is cheap and available. As you may
guess VW does not offer the valve, only the R/D for $180. I will try to find
the part number from dodge.

But here is the rest of the picture: If the charge goes then the oil went
too. This means that the compressor has no oil and if you drive like this
long enough it will free-wheel and get ruined cause its running with out
oil. If it blows get it fixed or else!

Fan resistors: They are located in front of and lower then the battery. When
the EV has ABS the ABS unit is on top of them. Combine this with the cover
over the whole battery compartment and temps will get high. They dealer
mechanics have sugested (un-officially) that adding louvers or a small fan
by the resistors will fix it.
