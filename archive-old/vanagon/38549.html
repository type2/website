Subject: Check those fuel systems, folks

Hey now,
        Here's the scenario: bus' been running pretty lousy for about 5
days. Took a look-see at it on Tuesday, ignition was all kosher, meaning it
had to be a fuel problem. I replaced all my gas lines and fuel pump about 3
weeks ago, so I know it's not them. Must be the carb. Sure enough, I look
at it and it's got a wee bit of gas on it. Must be bad gaskets. Have to
rebuild the spare. Guess I'll get to it ths weekend. So much for going
fishing.

        So I'm back on the road Wed. PM driving a friend home from chior
practice, and suddenly the bus runs almost as fast as molassas in January
in Inuvik. Kinda like one of those trucks at a tractor-pull, tryin' real
hard, not moving very fast. Problem is, I don't have one of those several
ton trailers on the back, and I'm on concrete. Not good signs. So I pull
over and grab the flashlight to take another look-see.

        Suprise! The sediment drain plug (bottom of the carb float bowl,
13mm nut) is gone. Gas is pouring out very quickly in great quantities, as
fast as the new fuel lines and fuel pump can supply it. Very efficent new
parts. I deduced that this was a good time to turn off the engine. Smart
guy, aren't I? After a very brief search for the missing plug, I just
pulled the one off of the spare carb that rides around in the back of the
bus waiting for a rebuild. The bus has run very nicely ever since, thank
you. About like molasses in January in San Francisco (meaning as good as
one can expect the old slow girl to go). Have to try some of Bob's fancy
tricks and see if I can get it closer to San Diego. At least Bakersfield...
;-) ;-) ;-)

        The moral of the story is: when checking fuel system integrity,
check more than just the hose clamps and fuel lines, check *everything*
that might leak. And carry an old carb around for parts at 9pm on the side
of the road.  ;-)

Peace,
