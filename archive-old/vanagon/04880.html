&gt; Okay, everyone, I think we should have our own &quot;Five Year Dream Car Pick.&quot;
&gt; Same rules, which for your convenience I reproduce here:
&gt; 
&gt; ..each was asked to pick the car, any car,
&gt; he wished. BUT! there's some gotchas!  (I think joel meant &quot;catches&quot;, but
&gt; I think maybe &quot;gotchas&quot; and &quot;catches&quot; are pronounced identically in
&gt; Alabamese.)
&gt; 
&gt; 1. they had to live with the car they chose for five years.
&gt; 2. it was to be their only automobile in those five years.
&gt; 3. they had to drive it daily to work, to the 7-11, across the country, and
&gt;       through michigan winters.
&gt; 4. after five years, they would give the car back, without depreciation
&gt;       affecting him in any way.
&gt; 5. they would, however, have to foot the bill for maintenance, fuel, tires;
&gt;       all non-warranty upkeep would be dollars dragged from their personal
&gt;       savings.
&gt; 
&gt; So quit bothering with that work you're supposed to be doing and send in
&gt; your choice.  Now we'll find out if this really ought to be called the
&gt; Vanagon list!

	I hate to admit it but I would get one of those Humvee (sp),
	jeep on steroids thing. Rig some sort of camper add-on, or
	maybe a pop-top, yeh thats it a hummer with a pop top!
	The attraction is a car that can go more places, tow things, and
	looks better when scratched.
