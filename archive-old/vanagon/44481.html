Subject: Installing Gauges...Where?


hey now,

i'm going to buy some gauges for Rumba, can't decide whether to put them 
under the dash or in the dash. i've heard bus buys makes something you 
can use to mount them between the radio and ashtray...i don't see how the
mounts would fit, much less the gauges...any advice?
