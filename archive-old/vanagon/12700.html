&gt; What year did they stop using the hand crank on the motor in
&gt; the Westfalias? My '56 has one. I don't know about '57 or '58.

I have a *very* early 59 Panel and it has the hand crank--along with 
ribbed bumpers, higher than other 59 taillights and other features common 
to 58's.  I'll guess that they stopped cranking these beasts in 60 when 
the oddball motor came out or possibly when the went to the plumber's 
delight bumpers, as the crank may have had clearance problems.

&gt; Wasn't '58 a one year only Westie? I know the '5? to '57 are pretty
&gt; much the same as are the '59 to '61.
&gt; 
I'm not sure, a friend of mine has a decent mostly original 58 westie 
though if curious about anything.  8-)
