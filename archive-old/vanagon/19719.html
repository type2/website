Subject: bus racing

&gt;  
&gt; &gt;  The other wonderful idea along these lines would be to
&gt; &gt; find a drag strip and go on 'grudge' night- match-race vans, for
&gt; &gt; the slowest 1/4 miles they'd ever have recorded!
&gt; 
There is a drag strip in Union Grove, Wis that will let anything race.(as
long as it passes inspection)  I have always wanted to race my covertible.
  After I fix my the bus-movingandstopping-bits I think i will take my
camper.
