Subject: Advice wanted: '65 vw 1300 convertible or not question?

Hi all

I have the chance to buy a '65 vw 1300 for about £1000 however there is 
a catch and thats where your advice would come in handy.

The current owners cut the roof of but did not put a canvas top on it. 
So basically they use it for summer day... which in Sweden is not always 
guaranteed!

What I would like to know is what are the costs and methods of making 
the car a true convertible. I believe the job they have done is quite 
good but none the less I would like to have a roof!

Thanks for any help
Ian
