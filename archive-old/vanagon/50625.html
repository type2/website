&lt;&lt; Is it normal for the steering to drift slightly to the left when coasting
 or driving on a flat road? Someone said all busses pull to the left - can
 this be true? If not what would be the most likely cause? In case it is
 relevant the suspension at the front of the bus is a bit lower than the
 rear - is this normal? &gt;&gt;


Bus should steer straight.  Have an alignment shop check out the caster.
 Incorrect castor angle will cause drifting.  It is easily adjusted.  Camber
and toe will have to set afterwards in that order.
