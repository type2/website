Subject: hourmeter circuit needed

Group,
I'd like to install an hourmeter in my crew cab.  I'd like this to reflect 
the time that the engine is running, not that the ignition switch is on.

Does anyone have a circuit or diagram that would switch the hourmeter on 
based on the presence of oil pressure?

Thanks,
Dean &amp; Opie
