Subject: re:Major Child Problem


    
    My son (13) had a hissy fit last night about NuBus ('82 Diesel).
   
    He threatened to ignore us if we picked him from the 
    school dance tonight in the bus...

1. He's 13 just watch his attitude when he gets nearer to the legal driving
age and wants help acquiring any car. It will remind you of how sweet kids
are between December 20-25.

2. Keep his complaining &quot;bum&quot; home from the sock hop and force him to suffer
through VR.5 and Leno's lamest jokes. Or really scare him and make him read
something!!!! OOOOh Scarey!
