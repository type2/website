Sounds like a decent price to me;  wouldn't you
REALLY rather have a used '93 EV for &lt;$15K?
Think of the benefits:

Cheaper than your house (but probably not by much)

Inline 5 cylinder engine (hey, everybody's got a 6,
but how many people have 5s, hmmm?)

Last I heard, the VR6 EV comes in a camper package;
heck, you don't need that camper stuff; pitch a 
tent and hang with the racoons!  :)

BTW, where can I get me one of them houses for less
than $31K?...  ;)

San Jose, CA  (where closets cost more than $31K)
