Deciphering Abbreviations on a Snowy Evening
(with apologies to Robert Frost)
by Will Mengarini

 Whose code this is I do not know.
 He's with another firm now though;
 I wish right now that he were here
 To explicate his data flow.

 My manager must think it queer
 A senior software engineer
 Proclaims short names a big mistake
 And says they leave the code unclear.

 She gives her puzzled head a shake;
 She thinks this job's a piece of cake.
 But I'm the one who flounders, deep
 In global date, all opaque.

 The code is ugly, harsh and cheap,
 But I have promises to keep,
 And hours to go before I sleep,
 And hours to go before I sleep.
