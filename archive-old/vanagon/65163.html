Subject:      FS: 87 Syncro in Albuquerque

     This may be the car for someone out there!

     Over the weekend, I saw a nice looking Syncro (non-westfalia) parked
     along a main drag in town.  It's a 1987, gold with the silver stripe,
     bone stock, good interior (one arm rest has fallen off, but it's in
     the car; probably needs new screws), one small ding on one of the rear
     fender lips.  Tires looked okay, but I'm not sure if they are the full
     whiz-bang 164 ply construction we all need.

     I peeked underneath, and all seems in good condition and in order (no
     hanging parts, no visible scrapes, etc.)

     Five speed w/single differential lock.

     Air conditioning.

     Stereo w/cassette.

     All seats.

     Mileage is 77K!!!!!!!

     Price is $5,950!!!!!!!

     Phone number to call is (505) 881-6899.  It's a business, but the
     receptionist seems to know all about the car.

     If it were a Westfalia, I wouldn't be telling y'all about it!

     Unsolicited testimonial: I haven't driven it, but I maybe could for
     anyone who is SERIOUSLY interested.  I bought my '91 Westfalia over
     the 'net in South Carolina, and if this car runs as good as it looks,
     I would buy it sight unseen as well.

     (I can see my future - If I ever find a '91 Westfalia Syncro in as
     good a shape as my '91 2WD - I just may have to sell.)
