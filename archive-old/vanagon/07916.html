&gt;   never had a car called Christine, but have been told that FIAT stands for
&gt;   &quot;Fix It Again Tony&quot;

I heard another one: Feeble Italian Attempt at Transportation :-)
                     -      -       -          -

Having owned a few Fiats, however, I must say I have really enjoyed them...
They were always a joy to drive, and too easy to get yourself killed in.
Later in life, I decided to separate the two:  I bought a 73 VW bus for
'comfortable' transpotation, and a Kawasaki 550 gpZ for the thrill...

&gt;
&gt;   &quot;duct tape- is there anything it can't do?&quot;

My wife used to use duct tape to seal the places where the outside air
managed to get into the '73 bus during PA winters...
