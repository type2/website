Subject: Re: Who sells VW mechanics overalls?

Thought I'd post the name of the party, since several people e-mailed me 
directly asking me to pass the info on once I found out.  Price is $20 plus 
shipping for all but largest sizes.  Name is Rex Eastmann, at Sunbugs, 
(209) 742-6789. Thanks to Robert King for the info.

&gt;A while ago, someone mentioned a person who sells VW dealer-style
&gt;mechanic's overalls (used, I think).  Can't find any info on it in the
&gt;archives.  Anyone know who this is?
