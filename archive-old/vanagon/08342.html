Subject: '56 Kombi progress: junkyard &amp; New motor

Wie Ghetes!

Yesterday I skated out of work early and made the rounds at the local
junkyards.  At one of the biggest ones, &quot;Pick n Pull&quot; I made a 
startling discovery:  Every single air cooled motor was GONE, along with
all of its attachments!  The only ones that were left were the ones
that had obviously grenaded.  One such example had a hole in the top of
the case I could put my hand in, and I have big hands!

There is definitely a plot afoot here!

I did score some goodies!  At PnP, I got a speedometer w/working odometer,
(found in the back seat of a BMW Bavaria) a very clean, near new heater 
box (found in the trunk of a volvo) and a doghouse cooler, which was still
bolted to a grenaded engine.  $7.50 for each goody.

I could not even find a scrap of engine tin, or an intake manifold.

At junkyard B, which has much migher prices, I actually found a complete
motor, albeit it was in the cargo area of the bus it came out of, which
made it all the better.  Got my manifold and top engine tin I need for
todays new engine install.  These came out of a '63 bus that still had the
rear hatch, 2 popouts, doors, and 1 windsheild.  There were no splits at
junkyard A.

I wandered over to the bug section, and lo and behold I found another
doghouse cooler _and_ the fan shroud!  Whoohoo!  Snag!  They charged me
$40 for the tin, manifold, cooler, shroud, and a bus reverse light assy
minus the lens.  If you are wondering what the heck I want with the 
light assembly... Thats the same assembly for the center brake light for
my '56 - all I need now is the red lens!

Of ancillary(sp) interest, junkyard B had a morris minor for sale, in
excellent condition, &quot;$1100 - leaking head gasket&quot;  I also had to watch
a late '60's or so westy get crushed :( (moment of silence, please) :(

Got everything home, degreased it, and painted the shrouds, tin and
manifold.  I did the sheetmetal black, and the manifold a soft glossy
gray - looks almost new!  I used the leftover grey on the heater box,
which by the way, is the type with the internal fin thingys!

I also pickup a clutch yesterday (new, PP/TOB/FD) and then I'm picking
up my motor at 8:30 this AM (PST).   By this afternoon, I will be mobile
with my new motor!
