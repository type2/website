At a theatre Sunday, I spied some Pine plywood, that looked to be just the right
thickness, being used to hold up a landscaping contraption.  I started to steal
it right then and there, but reconsidered given the eyes on me.

Of course you guys are focusing more on the replacement of birch, than
the sheer availability of thin plywood, correct?

Personally I rather like the ability to put poetry magnets on the roof ;-)
