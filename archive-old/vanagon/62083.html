Subject: Rebuilding of FI components
Date: Sun, 29 Jun 1997 20:14:57 -0400

Has any one ever tried repairing any of the vacuum, electronic or 
electro-mechanical  components in FI system?  Rebuilding the air box looks 
pretty easy, if you could find the parts and the ECU would be a snap, if a 
schematic could be had.  But what about the aux. air regulator and the 
vacuum solenoids used in the A/C and power steering boost circuits?  These 
seem to go bad all the time and they, as with everything on Vanagons, are 
not cheap (at least in the monetary sense).  Also, beware of new ECUs from 
VW.  I went through 3 bad ones, before getting a rebuilt from Bosch. My 
guess is that the old electrolytics are breaking down.  Electrolytic 
capacitors have a long service life, but short shelf life. They must be 
kept charged or they have the tendency to leak. Also, if you guys are using 
stabilant on your connections,  then you should also be concerned with the 
condition of the contacts that you are enhancing. Stabilant will improve a 
connection, bad or good, but if your contacts are bent or weak, replacement 
would be the better answer.  Then you can wave the stabilant over the 
connection and say the magic words.   Has anyone ever considered going to a 
medium (or perhaps an exorcist) to find the answers to our problems?  I 
heard something about a Subaru conversion.  They do make good engines...

Remember, if we can't laugh at our problems, we'll miss out on all the fun.
