Subject: weird problem w/ poor 85 Westy gas mileage

Soon after replacing my plug &amp; wires and throttle switch due to hesitations,
my gas mileage went through the floor.  One tank would take me 120 miles.
 Ouch.  After looking for something I may have messed up around the engine (I
checked all the sensors into the ECU) I crawled under looking for a leak.

I found that the vent tube that runs from the fuel tank overflow bottles
(near the gas tank) to the canister (forward of passenger side engine) had
become disconnected at a junction by the frame.  Easy find and easy fix, huh?
 not so fast.  Now my mileage has improved dramatically but is still only
about 16 mpg around the city?

Any clues where to look.  The vehicle runs great except it idles at around
2000 occasionally.  The only other symptom is that I think the exhaust pipe
is too black and there's black specs in the snow, indicating too rich a fuel
misture.

A test light on the injector conectors flicker as I believe they should.  All
sensors were static checked OK per Bentley (that how I found the bad throttle
switch).

So, did the open vent tube cause something else?  I don't know what to check
next?  Any clues anyone?
