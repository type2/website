Bug-Out 34 is being held on april 21, 1996 in Dinwiddie VA at the 
virginia motorsports park (below richmond).  I'm organizing a group to head 
down from Fredericksburg VA in the morning.  All VW's are welcome.  If your 
interested in the caravan or are attending th show and would like to meet 
up with us at the show let me know and I'll send the details.
