Subject: Re: Heater Cables

&gt;Anybody know of a permanent fix for heater cable problems on a '83 Westfalia.
&gt;The valve is stuck open from kinked cable which is fine in the winter but need
&gt;a fix by suymmer and this will be the second one to be replaced.  Do they only
&gt;last a couple years or is there a better fix?

I suspect that you will find that the problem is in the flap spring itself,
which was the case with my 81.  The spring becomes weak and will not close
the flap, regardless of whether the cable is properly positioned.  To fix
the problem I first adjusted the cables properly with new cylindrical lugs
on the cable, then purchased an auxilliary spring at the FLAPS from an
ordinary stock bin.  I then bored a small hole in the rubber face of the
flap directly opposite the stock hinge, fed the straightened end of the
added spring through and bent a hook over the metal backing plate of the
flap.  You have to be a contortionist, and very patient to do this.  I then
drilled a small hole in the metal flange that accepts the boot forward of
the flap, on the same side as the hinge, to accept the other end of the
auxilliary spring.  Visualize this as a spring under tension inside a
cylinder crossing from one side to the other, end to end. It works great,
holding the flap tightly closed and not impeding airflow or the cable from
opening for heat.  The rubber on the flap holds the spring tightly against
the metal flap without having to get it apart and drill a hole at that end.
I did the job under the van, without removing anything but the rubber
boot.
