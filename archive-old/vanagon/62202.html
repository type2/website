Subject: need for '84 Vanagon parts
Date: Thu, 3 Jul 1997 09:40:40 -0500 (EDT)

Hello,

I'm new to this list, so I hope this request is okay to post.

Having just purchased a '84 Vanagon base model with A/C and the 1.9L
Wasserboxer engine (wow, more than 80 HP!!!), I need a few parts that 
the former owner didn't notice were damaged or missing...

- a Flower Power sticker for the rear window (a peace symbol is
already there)
- a rear bumper, complete with end caps.
- front bumper end caps
- rear side marker lights (red)
- a leak-less gas tank

I am located in New Jersey, but close to Pennsylvania and upstate
NY.

Thanks,
Paul Henderson
'84 Vanagon Wasserboxer (137k miles)
