Subject:      EVC first trip

Hello Volks-characters!

Splendid trip this weekend.  Everything works as described, even the silly
fridge did AC, DC, and propane (used only for a short time).  The cooling is
slow  tho; took list person's advice and plugged in the night before we left.

Saw a beautiful '70 Westy from New Hampshire in Litchfield, Maine attending
a Blue-grass festival.  There is another festival in Brunswick, ME on the
28'th.   Maybe there will be more nice vans there, too?

The EVC's tranny is eager to please and takes a light foot to keep in the
&quot;over-drive&quot; program.  The minute I tried to push it the thing would jump
down and rear up to race away.  If you are gonna take a test drive on one,
keep your foot light and lug the little devel down to 35mph and your mileage
will be good.  Otherwise those six cylinders know where the gasoline could go!

Anyone tried using 87 grade gas with the VR6 engine?  I hate to use the 91
gas if I don't need it.

Gary and Belle from Maine
97 EVC
