Subject: some vanagon questions.

Greetings,

Just purchased my first vanagon, an 87 westie synchro.  I Have a few
questions:

1.  Any suggestions on the best motor oil to use?

2.  Whats the brand name of the suggested coolant (the kind thats easier
    on the heads as far erosion is concerned).

3.  Where can I find the EPA emissions label?  I bought it out of CA
    (where i live) and am trying to find if it was ever certified for CA
    emissions (will save me $300).

4.  I have very slow leaks from heads 1 and 3 (not enough to even drip
    on the ground, but can see some coolant).  Must these be replaced
    immediately?  Will waiting a while increase the chance of
    significant erosion that could cause the need for engine
    replacement?  The mechanic that inspected the van said i could (its
    a crap shoot) get 20k before needing to replace...this worries me..

5.  Guess thats it for now, but any helpfull hints or info would be
    greatly appreciated!

peace,

jeff (gilbert_jeff_at_tandem_dot_com)
