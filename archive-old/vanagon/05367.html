&gt;Is this a big problem? I remember reading pop's hotrod mags and I've seen what
&gt;happens to a chopped roof. Good ole pop is pretty handy with welding, so I
&gt;thought, hmmmmm...

It could probably be straigtened.
 
&gt;Three broad question groups:
&gt;1) What is a reasonable price for buying such a vehicle from a yard? This is
&gt;separate from whether the guy'll actually sell it. I know that in WI there is
&gt;a title transfer option for junked vehicles.

Tell him you'll take it away for $50.  Start from there.

&gt;2) For those of you who are repairing/restoring, or who have ... an old bus,
&gt;what kind of condition was it in when you began? Was there some sort of minimum
&gt;condition below which you said forget it? I guess this is a function of time,
&gt;money and desire.

My '56 was missing a lot of parts, most of the windows were craked, and it
had a lot of rocker panel rust.  I used to not even allow rust on cars I
bought, but since this was so old, I bent my rules.  On my previous bus, I
looked for months 'til I found one iwth NO rust.

&gt;3) What kind of mechanicals are on that era bus? I'd be interested in putting
&gt;in a early 70s drivetrain. I'm thinking, basically, of using later model parts
&gt;that are sitting around my pop's so I could keep the price down yet still have
&gt;an oh-so-sexy split to drive around.

I don't think you're gonna have an easy time with putting 70's stuff in except
for the engine.
