As if there weren't enough horror stories about mechanics working on 
your car. . .I was sitting around last night talking to a friend who 
used to work in a transmission shop when he was in high-school.  He 
said that the owner told him to tighten everything within a half turn 
of breaking the bolt.  I asked if they didn't use or own torque 
wrenches.  He just laughed kinda sick like.
