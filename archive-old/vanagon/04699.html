&gt; Have been told and confirmed through experience that Vanagon lug nuts are
&gt; self tightening. After a while on the road you will need either an impact
&gt; wrench or a 3 ft torsion bar to get them off no matter if they were hand
&gt; tightened in the first place. DC

	I haven't found them hard to remove, but I wonder if you've
	touched on part an answer to a question I probably should've
	posted a while back.

	Why does VW use lug bolts versus lugs &amp; nuts? Does it have anything
	to do with self-tightening or tightness?

	The reason I wonder is because I find mounting a wheel to be a pain
	in the quads and back with VWs and pretty easy with Detroit iron.

	I've only had to change wheels in good weather, on hard surface
	and in friendly space. I've dreaded having to mount a wheel on my
	van in the dark, in the shit, on the freeway shoulder.
