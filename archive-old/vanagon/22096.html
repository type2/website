&gt;&gt;I am currently having an engine built for me for a '60 Kombi that I am
&gt;&gt;getting.  The engine is a short block 1600.... can the stock exhausts from
&gt;&gt;the old bus be fitted onto the newer engine?  I would like an all
&gt;&gt;&quot;original&quot; exterior and interior look to the van but have the power of a
&gt;&gt;newer motor.
&gt;&gt;I am also new to the game of VW bus managment so any help here will be much
&gt;&gt;appreciated.  Thanks

        I don't think so. When I put a 1600 into my 65 Bug 'vert (40hp/1200cc) I
had to buy a new muffler. The 1600 has a longer distance (due to longer stroke)
across from exhast port to exhaust port. You can still re-use the old heat
exchagers, though. Also, on the Bug, it was a little tight getting that engine
back in there.
