Subject: FW: Classifieds2000 found 1 van ATTN. MARTHA
Date: Wed, 12 Mar 1997 11:01:02 -0800

Hello Martha and everyone else,

In my (perpetual) search for an EV, I submitted a request to Classifieds 
2000. Over the last month, it automatically sent about 3 dozen ads to me 
via email. (Granted, I did specify a nationwide search.) If nothing else, 
it gave me a lot of info regarding price and mileage data.

Martha, this van looks like it might be near you, and seems to be a decent 
price with low miles. Good Luck.

PS. I have NO commercial interest in Classifieds 2000. (I sell bikes, not 
vans.)
