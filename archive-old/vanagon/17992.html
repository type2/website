Subject: GNATT and gauges and batteries

Do you remember when I said that the U.S.S. Missouri was closed to tourists?
Well, they just had dedication ceremonies today and are reopening it while
Bremerton &amp; Hawaii argue over who gets to keep it docked. (My warnings
about driving *to* Bremerton still stand however - but if you really want
to check out that ship I wanted to make sure you knew it had been
reopened!)

Now about gauges:
I'd like to &quot;enhance&quot; the instrument cluster. I can't believe this thing
('80 Van) doesn't have a tach - although I guess the engine is so loud you
can sort of tell where it is after awhile, eh?

what is more useful for electrical system: ammeter or voltmeter? Voltmeter
just shows me that the voltage across the terminals is sufficient to
charge, yes?
Any advantages to knowing current instead?

Where does one find the 'cylinder head temperature' gauges I've heard
recommended for air-cooled motors? What temperature range is sufficient?
Is it worthwhile getting oil temperature as well, or instead of, head
temperature? How about a separate oil pressure gauge? (I'm really paranoid
I'm going to blow this thing up on the mountains around here!)

I've still got to futz around with my add-on secondary battery some more.
I'm suspicious that the cable from alternator to secondary is too long for
its gauge, because I'm not getting enough voltage across the terminals to
charge.
Say, has anyone had luck using 2-6V deep-cycle batteries in series - may
fit under my seat better.
I'm almost tempted to just hook a manual switch between the primary battery and
electrical box so I can run the fridge while driving and then simply make
sure its turned off. That may be my &quot;workaround&quot; until I get around to
pulling the plate off the bottom and rerunning the charging wire.
