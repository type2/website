Subject: loss of power

I recently purchased a '77 westy with the stock 2 liter and fuel injection.  
It was also a California car so it has the emmisions stuff.  I the suspicion
that 2 of the cylinders had low compression and that an engine rebuilt was
in the future.  Well today on my way to work/school it seems to have lost
power, e
[sorry]  I couldn't even get it into fourth gear.  I still starts beautifully
and idles well (maybe a little rougher than before).  It seemed fine last 
night.  Could it be time for the rebuild or should I try something else first?
I spent all morning trying to jump start another car, could that have something
to do with it.  I've heard that jump starting a fuel injected bus was bad, but
I never heard that jump starting someone else with the bus was bad.  Finally,
I have a '73 parts bus with the duel carbs.  How much of the engine (parts)
are compatible with the '77.
Thanks so much for your help,
Brett Thorsland

'77 westy (maybe out of service for a while)
'73 bus (parts)
'83 rabbit conv.  (maybe back in service)

ps  What is the difference between a Kombi and a station wagon?  Sorry for the
    bad grammer up above!
