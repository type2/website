&lt;&lt; Your story about hitting 85 up a grade is great! I'd love to get to 220k
mi. on my motor! How did you &quot;custom tune&quot; your engine? &gt;&gt;
AJ, I had been fortunate in working on cars and collecting tools since I was
15.I worked at various German car dealers during college and the after lean
years and have worked on cars as an independant private enterprise.In the
ensuing years I acquired a Scope and Infrared machine(both necss. for an
accurate tune.).When I moved from San Diego to Portland in June some thieves
broke into my garage and stole every tool I had including all the custom made
ones for VW.Anyway, to set the van to euro spec, 1st disconnect o2
sensor(digifant/digijet) and plug together  idle stabilizer(digijet).I reset
the ign timing to approx 10 deg btdc( you need to make another mark on the
pulley as it is not there on US versions)open the airbox and recalibrate the
spring tension( most airboxes develop a flat/worn spot on the circuit board
from running at the same setting so this will prolong the life of the box) to
acquire a 2% co at idle, reset your idle speed with the screw in the throttle
housing, then fine tune the co to remain at 2% at idle w/ the airbox screw.
Reconnect the idle stab. and you are done.I donot run w/ o2 sensor.I have
found on all cars since the sensors came out in 76 on Volvos, that it makes
the mixture too lean and too hot.OK the van spews out a tad more co% and HC,
but no less than any car of the late 70s-80s, considering the fact that the
o2 is supposed to keep the mixture at .07%, but it really just leans the
 hell out of the engine.This procedure is very effective on the digifant as
well.The engine runs like the dickens.no flat spot, no hesitation, all go
right to redline.I also run w/ a test pipe ala euro. I routinely run the van
every year on a continuous ski trip of 1800 mi at about  200rpm shy of
redline for 36 hrs straight.I think the vanagon engine is pretty amazing
considering the fact that this 1.9 engine pushes my 4000lb box around at
85mph+  all day.Unfortunately this procedure requires some way to read the
exhaust gases, and, unless you have a machine, or access to one, you will be
shooting in the dark.A dwell tach will not be accurate enough to read the
subtle changes in co%. I also installed a custom 70C t/stat to keep engine
temps in line( see posting to Todd) 
Of course... I only use the vehicle off-road in order to comply w/ EPA rules.
