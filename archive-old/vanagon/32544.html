Subject: FS '71 Sportmobile


Hi All,

I picked up  a 70 westy last month and got this beast thrown in on the
deal. I'm gonna try to sell it or parts of it, Here's the info:

'71 sportmobile camper, minus engine/ trans.
complete interior that is in good shape.
pop top with good canvas.
complete gas heater.
the body is rusty underneath but the rest is decent with the exception
of somebody putting a quad headlight setup on it... yuck.
the title is clear and it's towable.

let me know if it, or some of it interests ya.

I live near pittsburgh pa., and yes it's buried under lots of snow!

RJ.
