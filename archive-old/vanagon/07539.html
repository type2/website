Subject: Re: Synchros

The Eurovan actually is sold as syncro in europe but is nowhere near as good
off road as the Vanagon Syncro. This is clear on the face of it, and also
according to test reports in the UK off-road press.

Here is a bit of killer trivia:

The vanagon syncro wasn't actually assembled by VW!!!!

It is made by Styer Diamler Punch in Austria in the same plant that makes the
Mercedes G-Wagon. 

There are a plenty of Mercedes G-Wagons around here in Manhattan and I always
look fondly on them as brother vehicles for this reason.

By the way: fuel economy 2WD vs. 4WD is not really different: probably within
1mpg.
