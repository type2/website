I'm just shocked to hear about Chris Bridge's and Dave Black's miseries
with their recent rebuilds. And they're not the only ones. My bus' second
engine had the same fate, rebuilt by an official VW garage (VWoA agreed to
pay for the third.) Here we got obviously bright and patient people with
access to a lot of information, yet their engines self-destruct within
1000 miles. What is it about those VW engines and their precious
fragility?? Not to discourage Dave Kautz, but to rebuild on your own looks
like a gamble to me. Purchased rebuilts may not be better, but at least
they usually come with a warranty.
