Subject: REIMO online WWW site


The camping supplier REIMO got its WWW site online.
The URL is:

http://www_dot_camping-online_dot_de/REIMO

I don't know what to find. Someone hacked around in
our network and all German WWW servers are not longer
accessible for me.

..
Oh I did it with anonymous FTP, loading all files:

 - Special offers
 - Used Campers
 - Addresses

You should have some German knowledge, a lot of text,
few (not nice) pictures. If you are interested in EVs:
lR means long wheelbase
mR means medium wheelbase (for Mercedes only)
kR means short wheelbase
