Subject: Stuff on my '77

Well, I just thought I'd take a little bandwdth and say what I'm doing to
my '77 bus.

Last Monday I adjusted the rear torsion bars.  Went smoothly once I figured
out how I was going to remove both wheel assymblies.  I decided the
best/easiest way was to undo the CV joints and the brake line and to let it
hang from the emergency brake cable.  Then I used a jack to hold the
stress on the spring plate, and used a large pickle fork to move it over
the stop.  I managed to do it without removing any fingers.  I figure if
you take things slowly and and think ahead about what can hurt you you can
avoid bodily damage.

I plan on repacking the CV joints and replacing the boots.  My favorite
local shop said that they have the boots for about $10 each.  And they have
some 14oz cans of moly-graph grease that says it can be used on CV joints
for $3.30 each.  Does it sound like I should use this stuff, it's what the
store said to use.  Seems like a good price for a tub of CV grease.  and
I'll need to repack the CVs in my sister's fastback soon.

I also want to stop most of the oil leak in my bus.  I replaced the little
rubber bootie thing on the dipstick.  But that seems to have only stopped a
little of the leak.  So now I'm going to replace the pushrod seals.  My
store says about $16 for the set.  And since the replacement of them has
just been thoroughly discussed on the list I don't have any questions. :)
