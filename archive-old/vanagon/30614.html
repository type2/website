Subject: Gas heaters in Splitties


Brrrrrrrr...

All this talk of gas heaters and the fact that I have a 5 foot drift behind
(and on top of my bus) has started to get me thinking about auxiliary heat 
in my bus (which is currently off the road).

How is the duct-work for the gas heater hooked up in a splittie?  Does it
hook up to the main heater tube (and crack windshields:-}  This sounds 
particulary good given that a wall behind the cockpit is a frequent 
temporary cold-weather addition.

On the topic of in-line fans, does anyone know how well these small 
units stand up to heat?  The marine supply stores have small in-line units 
for 15-20$US but the ads don't say anything about heat tolerance.

Thanks,
...Markus
