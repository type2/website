Quoth Cheese:

&gt;Reminds me of the Furry Freak Brothers driving their old VW hippie bus

That would be Freak Brothers #4 (&quot;Brother, can you spare 75c for the 
Freak Brothers?&quot;), inside back cover, specifically an episode of Fat 
Freddy's Cat:

panel 1: FF's Cat reminiscing.
&quot;Don't let anyone tell you that tumbleweeds aren't dangerous!&quot;

panel 2: FFFB's splittie bus tooling through the hot desert.

panel 3: Phineas to Freddy (at wheel):
&quot;Watch out! You're gonna hit that tumbleweed!&quot;

panel 4: Tumbleweed tumbles underneath van.  Freddy:
&quot;Ha ha ha! A tumbleweed can't do anything to you! They're light as a 
feather!&quot;

panel 5: Closeup of Franklin, Phineas, and Freddy's disturbed faces 
and a loud SCRAPE underneath van.

panel 6: Van on side of road, Phineas reaching underneath engine:
&quot;It's stuck under the frame!&quot;

panel 7: Smoke curling up from underneath van.  Phineas with 
worry-sweat coming off his head:
&quot;It's gotten way up beside the muffler!  Ow! It's Hot!&quot;

panel 8: Phineas leaps away from van.  FWOOP! Flames appear.
&quot;EEEYAAHH!  We're on fire!&quot;

panel 9: FFFB's running for lives as van goes BA-DOOM in background.

panel 10:  Forlorn FFFB's sit beside charred ruin of van.

panle 11: Two tumbleweeds on ridge overlooking plume of smoke 
underneath full moon.  1st Tumbleweed: &quot;Another blow for freedom!&quot;  
2nd Tumbleweed: &quot;Soon, the highways will be ours!&quot;

(no bobware in sight, btw)

Of course it's all so much funnier with the pictures.  Helps too if 
you're 19, living in the dorms in Gainesville, with a towel stuffed 
underneath the door to keep the RA from smelling that smoke.

Or so I've been told.
