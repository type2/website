Subject: westy woodstove


Ok, I know it sounds crazy, but I got this flash of an idea tonight
on the way home from work.  Have been thinking about this issue
of how to &quot;heat&quot; the camper while camping, without having to
rely on electricity and/or propane.  What about some sort of
custome made, small woodstove that vents to the outside?  I've
seen something similar to this made out of mexican pottery,
sometimes used atop a kitchen counter and vented externally,
so why not in the van?  This would allow the use of wood,
perhaps even pellets, prestologs, whatever one could find.

Any ideas on if this would work, and if so, how to make it?
