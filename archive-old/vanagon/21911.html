Subject: august campground location


Does anyone know anything about a BLM campground called Wailaki
(pronounced why-locky).  It is part of the King Range Nat.
Conserv. Area over on the coast, kind of northeast of say, Chico.

It was suggested to me by the BLM that we camp there, and I'm awaiting
printed snail mail about the area.  All input appreciated!  :)
