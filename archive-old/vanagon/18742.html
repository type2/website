Subject: Boiling radiator light and tailgate gas struts

The wifemobile (87 Westy) has two problems for which I hereby solicit
advice:

(1) The overtemperature indicator light comes on when the engine reaches
    operating temperature. Although the light is on, indicating an 
    overheated engine, the temperature gauge is in the normal operating
    area, and there is no loss of coolant. Belts are normal.
    How does the circuit for the light work ? What is it *really* saying ?

(2) According to service records, the tailgate gas struts were replaced
    when we bought it, but now the gate won't stay open.
    Is it likely that one or both failed early, or more likely that
    they put the wrong part in (too weak) ?
