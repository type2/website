Subject: Need subscription to air cooled V.W

Can anyone on the list help me find air cooled VW stuff at
listserv_at_home.ease.lsoft_dot_com ?
I can't seem to raise them and I have an old '78 type two, and most of my
stuff is related to this genre, even though the Vanagon net is great for
learning.
