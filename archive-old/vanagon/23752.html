Subject:       '85 engine problems

Donald-
You might try several things, i had an '85 an had some 'challenges' 
too.  First of all, are you SURE it's a rich condition and not 
something else that makes the engine sound rich?  Anyway, lets assume 
it's rich.  If you don't want to attempt anymore fiddling yourself, 
check around for a garage that has a '4 gas analyzer'.  This tests 
for CO, O2, HC, and NOx.  An exhaust stream analysis can tell a 
mechanic an awful lot of where to look for the problem, based on the 
balance of these 4 constituents.

Another approach you might consider is that some basic elements of 
the idle setting are out of whack... i had this on mine.  The 
Digijet system has the infamous 'idle stabilizer' to try to keep the 
engine idling at around 800-900 rpm.  It does this by changing the 
ignition timing.  So, if the *idle speed screw* on the throttle body 
is way off setting, the idle stabilizer will change the ignition 
timing to either way advanced or way retarded to try to get the idle 
to 800-900 rpm.  this causes a host of running problems, mostly right 
at idle.  get this back to spec by following the idle 
setting/ignition timing procedure in the manuals.  essentially this 
entails unhooking the 2 connectors on the idle stabilizer and 
connecting the male+female ends together.  this by passes the work of 
the idle stabilizer and allows one to set the basic idle speed with 
the idle speed screw on the throttle body.  THEN disconnect the 
vacuum advance and set the basic ignition timing at the specified 
rpm.  only then should the idle stabilizer plugs be plugged back into 
the idle stabilizer control unit.  NOTE: one can 'fine tune' the idle 
ignition timing by *slightly* adjusting the idle speed screw with the 
idle stabilizer connected.  this won't change your idle speed BUT it 
will change the idle timing a little and one can smooth a rough idle 
a little bit by varying the timing.

good luck!
