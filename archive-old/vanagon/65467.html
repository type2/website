Subject:      '86 Vanagon GL Weekender FS

Hi Volks,

A local mechanic not on the net asked me to post this:

1986 Vanagon GL
Weekender package - this includes HUGE rear bed and split folding middle
seat
Dove blue color - the body and interior are in excellent shape!
2.1 L - recent REBUILT with new heads!
130K
Auto tranny
VW/Blaupunkt am/fm/cassette
AC
$3500 obo
*call Bill at Vogt Auto, 1754 Cleneay Ave, Cincinnati, OH, 45212, (513)
731-8830

- I can honestly vouch for all this being true. This shop is the only shop
here in Cincinnati that actually advertises as working on Vanagons. They do
excellent work and charge for it! In fact, they work on the majority of
Vanagons brought to the DEALERS to be worked on.

- Call Bill, not me
