Subject: Tables for '86 Westy


I am looking for both tables for a Vanagon Westfalia.  Someone earlier
stated that they had found one(?) for $125, but I cannot remember where
they got it from.  Does anyone out there have an idea where to get these
cheap?  Or live near a junkyard where a Westy rests?  I will be
travelling around the western U.S. in a few weeks and could pick them up.
Thanks a lot.

Cory
'86 Westfalia

P.S.-Oh!  They are the beige with brown trim variety.
