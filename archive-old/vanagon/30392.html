Subject: Re: Sleeping in Campers

&gt;        I just have a kooky question which came to me the other day while
&gt;going to sleep in my bus.  Which way does everyone sleep?  Personally, I
&gt;sleep with my head to the rear but I have to be careful not to hit my
&gt;head on the shelf.  That's when I wondered if anyone else slept the other
&gt;way and why.  This is assuming you'd be sleeping in the lower level
&gt;(downstairs) of course.  Actually, now I'm curious about the upper level

        Well, my Mom has a '78 that we camped in a lot when we were kids.
Me and my sis always slept with heads toward the front (FIF), made it
easier to get at food (or the door) without getting out of sleeping bags.

Peace,
