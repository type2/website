Subject: Bleeding Vanagon Radiator/Change High/Low Beam Bulb

Volks,
First and foremost, Merry Christmas all on Christmas Eve. Shall I recite 
&quot;Stille Nacht&quot;?. No, we won't submit ya'll to such, however it would be 
appropriate owing to our commonality German things.
Sorry for the holiday question, but a road trip has entered the scene 
and I could use some Vanagon street wisdom.
I am suspecting an air pocket in the radiator of my 87GL after a recent 
radiator changeout. I have read the Bentley and conversed at length with 
my local Dieter and Wolfgang on this. Everytime I get a different story 
on the easiest way to bleed air from the radiator. 
#1 Do I have to elevate the front end?
#2 Can I access the bleeder screw by just removing the front upper 
grill?
#3 Is 2000 RPM sufficient to blow out the bubbles?
Fill in the blanks for me if necessary.

Question Number Two. How to change Rectangular Quartz bulb in High/Low 
Beam: Not covered in the Bentley.
#1 Can I access the socket for my high/low beam bulb by removing the 
upper grill for my problem #1 above?
#2 If not, how is it done volks?
Thanks for All.
Merry Christmas.
