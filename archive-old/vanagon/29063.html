Well, I've only pushed our Westy above 60 mph once (steep downgrades 
excluded), and it was on a flat interstate freeway run across Iowa, when 
I was late to Grandma's house.  (Yeah, just call me &quot;Red&quot;)

Our happy 76 Westy wound up easily to 80 mph, and I had plenty of pedal 
left.  Bet I could have hit 85 or better if I dared.  Drove at 80, or a 
little faster, for over an hour.  I felt bad pushing our Westy like that, 
but I think it wanted to meet Grandma too, so I guess it was OK...
