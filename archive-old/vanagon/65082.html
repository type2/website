&lt;&lt; Good questions, but what is the URL for white lips?

 I never saw any white ones.

 Also, I gather this means the Winker lips are different from the factory
lips? &gt;&gt;

all it is is Coyote's Vanagon_dot_com site...
click on &quot;info&quot;..
there they are whitish grey or whatever....
paint 'em any color u like.
nope the Winklers ain't the Factory ones..
Factory-2 piece..
Winklers -one piece..

would someone tell us if they're gonna fit on a late vanagon w/ the
fiberglass rocker trim??!!??
