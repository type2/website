&gt; Hey folks,
&gt;
&gt; Well, I got up this beautiful Sunday morning, here in Northern California,
&gt; me and the wife got dressed up in our Sunday best for church and when I
&gt; went out to start up the Westy I heard the &quot;sound&quot;.  Sounds like an exhaust
&gt; leak, but I have not checked her out to be sure (going to do that right
&gt; now). Sounds like a loud external ticking, much like the normal motor sound
&gt; amplified. Can anyone concur with such little data? She only has 6k on a
&gt; brand new motor.
&gt;
&gt; Anyway, assuming this is in fact an exhaust leak how serious is the matter?
&gt; To put things in perspective I am planning on a trip to Medford Oregon next
&gt; week (600-700 miles) and I am not sure I can fix it unless I have to.
&gt;
&gt; Any advice?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks!
&gt;

Chris,
With a recently installed engine, I would suspect that you have a
leaking flange or other bolted connection.  Chances are that you can
resolve this leak by simply checking and tightening all of your exhaust
system hardware.  This is a good practice with a new engine as the
thermal cycles do tend to allow the cylinder head flange gaskets to
relinquish some of their installed torque.  The more you drive it with
the leak, the less of a chance you will have of not requiring a new
gasket as the exhaust gas causes quick erosion past any leaks.
