I thought I read somewhere that Steyr-Daimler-Puch invented the original
technology.  That was the leverage they had to force VW to let them do the
assembly of the Synchro versions (lower royalties if they assemble). VW
already had high-tech all-wheel-drive technology for the Audi Quattros that
they'd developed in house, but it would have been very difficult to adapt
to the Vanagon in comparison the the SDP system.  I knew the Honda RealTime
system was very similar, but didn't know it was the same.  I assume they
licensed it from SDP, too.
