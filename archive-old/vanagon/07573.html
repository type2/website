&gt; If the computer really does need this extra second to calculate before
&gt; allowing startup... Push starting would be a bad idea wouldn't it?
&gt; I always thought that the Do Not Push Start warning on the visor was just
&gt; to deter morons from fucking it up through stupidity.

My understanding of the reason for not &quot;roll starting&quot; vehicles was that 
one runs the risk of filling your Catalyst with raw gasoline, not a good 
idea for your very expensive Catalytic Converter (provided your hasn't 
been hollowed out like some who shall remain nameless).
