&gt;&gt;There was some some discussion in another forum as to whether or not the lead

&gt;
&gt;according to the Nascar drivers, the lead vehicle DOES derive some benefit,
&gt;but not as much as the following vehicles. i'm not sure our buses are big
&gt;enough (or fast enough) to do any 18-wheelers any good. and besides, most
&gt;of them do NOT like being behind 4-wheelers for very long. imho. :)

DISCUSSION:

When two vehicles travel linearly in close proximity, a small pressure
system is formed in the &quot;slot&quot; between them, creating a sort of &quot;Venturi
Effect.&quot; The air being forced more quickly to move between the vehicles
creates a  mini-high pressure system, and a low pressure in front of the
vehicles, resulting in a forward vector PULL, effectively causing both
vehicles' forward vectors to combine, resulting in further forward thrust
(i.e. acceleration).

But this &quot;slot&quot; is distinctly related to vehicle sizes, placement, and
shapes (read: air flow patterns). There is a point where you are out of the
slot, and simply being buffeted in &quot;trash&quot; air (highly disturbed whorls).

Having once been the recipient of a rear tire blowing on an 18 wheeler as
it blew by me, I opt to avoid the questionable advantage any &quot;slot-riding&quot;
might afford!

Another 2 cents!
