Subject:      even more weakly stats ...

as i was putzing around, adding folks and changing things, i was a bit
surprised to find that i'd &quot;collected&quot; about 650 folks with buses. now this
is ALL the bus folks that i've &quot;seen&quot; on the internet, and some of them
have likely graduated/moved/sold/etc., so ...

so, anyway. for your entertainment:

the 1971 bus folks will be overjoyed, no doubt, to see that they still retain
the lead. and by quite a large margin. :)  somewhat curious patterns seem to
be there for the other years, though.  skewed data, what? :)
