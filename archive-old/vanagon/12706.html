So Joel Walker says:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Now can this system also be used for stationary uses e.g. camping?
&gt; 
&gt; as long as you don't park in a pile of leaves or tall grass.

You mean like with the same caution as with a cataclismic preverter? ;)

&gt; &gt;And why wasn't this option available in the U.S.?
&gt; 
&gt; i believe it was, but like so many 'options', our slimeball-salesforce didn't
&gt; care to mention it in most places (like california, alabama, etc.)

That figures.  I would have had that option installed without even
thinking about it. :(

&gt; nah. stupidity and slovenliness.

I should've known.  Doh!
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Can anyone enlighten me more about these systems
&gt; 
&gt; Enlightenment must come from Within, grasshopper. :)

How did you know I was spacing out?  :O

&gt; if you've got the money, honey, someone's got the time. :) check with that
&gt; Mirvis guy in new jersey and see what's available.

Thanks for the info Joel and to all those that contributed thus far.
Money and Marvis.  Okay, I'll give him a jingle.

Cheers!
