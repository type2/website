Subject: PO'd '71 Bus


A bit of wisdom has come my way, regarding the '71 bus that decided
not to run for prospective buyers. Bob Hoover had a look at it, and
found that a metal plug about the size and shape of a dime, that fits
into a hole machined in the Solex 30PICT-3 carb that this 1970 engine
has, was missing. His statement ran an instant bell with me, for I'd
seen something that looked just like that sitting loose in the engine
compartment around the time it started acting up.

It didn't occur to me to look at the carb-- I'd never seen a piece like
this, and had thought it might have been part of a tool or something.
Bob said that these plugs are known to blow out in the event of a backfire,
and asked if I'd had any such backfires recently. Answer was an emphatic
YES. He suggested I put it back in with some special-purpose black epoxy
type material available at a FLAPS, this being similar to the way they
are installed at the factory.

Volkswagen does it again! And so does vanagon_at_lenti, this time in the
person of Bob Hoover, who has probably forgotten more than I've ever
known about VWs.

He also suggested that my missing preheater hose, which is supposed
to come through the hole in the sheet metal next to the pulley, normally
blocks hot air from entering the engine compartment. Since mine's been
gone since before I owned the bus, this could contribute to the overheating
this car's been experiencing. Hmmm...

A word to the wise. Which someday I hope to be one of.
