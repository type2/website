Subject: '87 vanagon power steering problem
Date: Mon, 3 Apr 1995 07:21:46 -0400 (EDT)

My power steering has quit on my '87 vanagon.  I don't see any leaks and
the reservoir is full.  Any ideas  ?  Pump  ?   Is there a warning  signal
connected to this circuit  ?  Reason I ask is that about the same time the
power steering quit there was a buzzing from a signal in the dash and the
oil pressure light began blinking on and off.  After turning the ignition
off and restarting a few times the buzzing and flashing of the light
stopped.  I am still driving the van, without power streering now and the
buzzing and flashing of the light still happens at startup from cold
(overnight) but not always.  Starting and stopping the engine a few times
has so far stopped the buzzing and flashing.  After the engine is warmed
up the buzzing and flashing do not happen.  WHAT IS HAPPENING ??  Is this
related to the power steering problem  ??  I see that there is some kind
of electrical sending device connected to one of the power steering pump 
lines.  ??   Hoping for some illumination on this mater from the
collective minds of you VWers.

Cheers

Frank
