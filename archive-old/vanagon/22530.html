Subject: RE: Should I buy this bus?



&gt;I am new to the list and think its great.  You guys really are crazy.
&gt;I thought I would tap in to your vast collective knowledge for some
&gt;advice.  I am considering purchasing a 1972 vw van.  It is sort of
&gt;rusty because it was submerged in a pond for about 3 years.  The
&gt;engine has been replaced with a TIII engine, but it has no compression
&gt;on #3 and ranges from about 60-90 psi on the rest.  The automatic
&gt;transmission slips if you go uphill so it probably needs to be rebuilt.
&gt;I want it to have air conditioning &amp; I found a guy who can put a
&gt;Mercedes delivery truck a/c unit on the roof.  Do you think $3500 is
&gt;too much for this van?  A friend says he thinks he can make it into
&gt;a camper.


This is a joke, right?

Knock a digit off the front or back of that price, and it might be
worth it.

Or did you mean, $3500 AFTER the driveline is rebuilt, A/C is
installed, and camperization is finished? Now THAT is more reasonable.
