&gt;To prepare for the test I did the following things, installed
&gt;a new catalytic converter (old one was totally blown out), a
&gt;new air filter, new Bosch 3-prong W7DTC plugs, added Chevron
&gt;Techron FI cleaner, replaced the last few crimp on clamps that
&gt;where on the FI hoses with #24 hose clamps, and cleaned the 
&gt;engine's ground connection (just to the left of the engine).

Mechanic tweaked the mixture!!  O2 sensor sytem obviously not working
properly.  This is why EPA looking to have only certified mechanics work on
vehicles.  Something is still wrong.
