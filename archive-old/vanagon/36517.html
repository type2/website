Subject: Re: Oil temp sending unit location on a type 4

Hi Clay,
  I put my sensor into the sump plate of my 1800\type 4. Actually, there are
2 sumpplates. One is the one with the oil strainer, that's the wrong one.
You want the other one, the one with no apparent function (anyone know more
?). Take it out and drill a hole IN EXACTLY THE RITE PLACE. My first one was
off a bit and I had to get another sumpplate from the junkyard. I got my
sensor from RMMW. It's a german VDO thing and comes with pretty good
instructions concerning the location of the drilling project. I guess
another possibility is to get a dipstick sensor. I decided against that
'cause I wanted only one thing in my dipstick hole and that is a dipstick.
The only problem with the sumpplate sensor is you should plan carefully how
to route the wire in order to avoid hot engine parts...Have fun,

                    Gregor

                    &gt; Howdy,
&gt; Does anybody know of a great place to mount the oil temp sending unit
&gt;  on a Type IV? With my upright motors I would mount them in the drain
&gt;  plate or tee off the pressure sending unit hole. I don't want to tee
&gt;  off the pressure unit because I would need to modify the tin and I
&gt;  don't think that it is the most accurate place. Could I drill a hole
&gt;  in the sump(?) plate on the bottom- the one right beneath the oil
&gt;  tube- or is there a better location.
&gt;
&gt; TIA
&gt; Clay
