Subject: Re: Ecu &amp; Idle Stabilizer

&gt;I had the idle stabilizer replaced on our 82 at a VW dealership in Palo
&gt;Alto. The engine would cut out after a high speed run or when driving
&gt;around town, even though it would start flawlessly.
&gt;
I had the same problem with my 87 Synchro.  I took it to the dealer and they 
had just gotten some tech bulletin (4/94) that explained something called a 
&quot;ghost harness&quot; and it would be about $100.  I didn't get it fixed before 
selling it, but I did talk to someone else that had the same problem and it 
fixed it.
