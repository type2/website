Subject: Re: Volvo Coupes

     Just gotta add my bit for the Coupe.
     
     It was based on a Volvo 240 (brick) but had a roof chop performed by 
     Mr Bertone. They were (all the ones I've seen) silver and black with 
     leather interior. There is an owners club over here.
     
     As far as seats go I'm gonna look for some green Recaro style seats 
     out of something for my bus.
     
     Lee.
