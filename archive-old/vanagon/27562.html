&gt; &gt; Ran into a couple of problems, and being a complete novice I don't know what
&gt; &gt; to do about them.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 1) The adjusters on one of the rear hubs are absolutely solid. I bent my
&gt; &gt; screwdriver trying to shift 'em. I guessed it might be a bit rash to
&gt; &gt; squirt penetrating oil all over the place :) but how else do I sort it out?
&gt; 
&gt; Ok, I don't own a split window bus, but I've seen them on T.V.  Correct 
&gt; me, anyone, but what it seems you've gotta do is pull off the brake drum 
&gt; and get to the guts of the brakes.  You'll see the little adjusters there 

Odo told me he didn't have to on his, he does his from the inside.
