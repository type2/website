Subject:       Re: Click/Clack &amp; Vanagon safety statistics

&gt; &gt;Click and Clack (the Car Talk guys) railed on a woman about the dangers
&gt; &gt;of driving her '76 Westy (tippy, no side impact protection -- suggested
&gt; &gt;she wear a footbal helmet).  Anyway, I've heard that the Vanagons are quite
&gt; &gt;safe.  Does anyone have real stats on this?  Vehicle deaths per mile?
&gt; &gt;Or Insurance company type of data?
&gt; 
&gt; Gee if Click and clack think a 76' westy is dangerous i wonder what they
&gt; would think of my all metal (padded dash we don't need no steenkin' padded
&gt; dash!!!!) deathmobile 65 westy. about all that separates me from a front
&gt; end collision is some sheet metal and the &quot;Y&quot; shaped hater tube that runs
&gt; up to the dash. Am i scared? Hah i laff in ze face of death &lt;cackle&gt;!

Interesting,  I once heard them advise a young kid to get an old bus 
because: A) last forever B) so cheap to fix, and if it broke, C) you 
could just throw it away and get another, and lastly D) girls like 
them.

Serious!  Back then as a 17 year-old with my (now sold) '67, I 
remember feeling very vidicated to have Click and Clack recommend 
what I was driving!
