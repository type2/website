&gt; Subject: Cleaning plastic wheel covers?

&gt; What do people recommend for cleaning (but not damaging) plastic
&gt; wheel covers?

&gt; I tried scrubbing mind, but after several hours, there are still
&gt; some black patches that won't budge.

By black patches I assume you're talking disk brake dust that
blackens the front wheel covers.  I tried many household cleaners
to get that stuff off of mine and finally found the Lysol Toilet
Bowl Cleaner will do the trick quite nicely.  It will also do a
number on your hands, so wear gloves.  It has never damaged my
plastic covers but I don't recommend it on metal surfaces.
