Subject: Re: Bus vs. Bug generators

The only difference in the &quot;long&quot; bus vs. &quot;shorter&quot; bug generators is length.

If you look at the mounting adapter used on your bus, you will note that the mounting plate adapter is &quot;indented/concave&quot; slightly. This puts you in the position of needing the longer generator.

Now, as you change out the generator, change out the adapter plate to the standard bug type.
Now, you will no longer need the &quot;longer&quot; generator.

This &quot;trick&quot; is how I solved the problem with my 1969 bus.

I now use a standard length bug generator, and no longer need the one which is harder to find, costs more, and was made for only that short window of time when VW used that stupid &quot;indented&quot; mounting plate to support their &quot;longer style&quot; generators.
As to why VW used this adapter plate and the longer cenerator for just a couple of years, well, I don't know.
