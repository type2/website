Subject: status, mechanic kudos, bus for sale, Winterhook

Yeah, I just keep cramming them in here. Topics for today include:

- my van runs much better now. Once the timing had been readjusted, the
other item that was throwing things off was the FI head temp sensor. Runs
*much* smoother now. I still don't know how the timing got off by 25
degrees, hopefully it didn't damage that new head work. Seems okay so far.

- the guy who fixed it (alas it wasn't me - I did attempt to diagnose it
but didn't get as far as temp sensor - I did learn a lot about AFC FI
systems in the process though!) is over in Chico, WA. Goes by the name of
'Big Mike's Volkswagon Reconstruction' at 360-373-1810.
This guy came highly recommended to me, and I'll pass on the recommendation.
He's been working on these things for awhile, runs a small garage out of
the back of his home, seems to be a reasonable, trustworthy guy.

While I was over there today, he had just been going over a bus someone
else local has going up for sale in the paper tomorrow.
1974 Bus, excellent condition, original paint.
Asking price is $2900, contact is Darryl at 360-871-6055.

I didn't drive this bus, but I did look at it. There is one small spot of
rust in front of the left rear wheel - seems treatable. There is some
surface rust under the mats in the back but the floor is quite solid. It's
got an extra bench seat in the back - i.e. 2 benches. looks like all
original upholstery - worn but solid.  Odometer reads 59K, figure its been
around once or twice. My overall impressions of it was that it pretty good
for a 20 year old bus.

I was talking to him about this bus a couple of weeks ago, and he said that
the current owner had 'found' it locally, brought it over for a quick
checkup, and
is turning it around to resell. These buses are pretty popular with kids
around here, so he may be hoping one of them is willing to pay that much.
Or maybe someone lurking out there is.

And finally, the 1995 Winterhook Ale is shipping. Good stuff, but it tastes
a bit lighter this year. Then again maybe its just relative to the homebrew
pale ale &amp; Full Sail Amber Ale I've been quaffing lately.  Nice and hoppy
too.
Check it out.
