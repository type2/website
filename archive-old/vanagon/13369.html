Subject: Import Service Head Gasket Pics

I've placed scanned pics (Thanks to Dan Houg of Bemidji!) of the 
procedure for replacing the head gaskets and other seals on the gopher 
site in the directory HeadGasketProcedure. I've converted them to jpeg 
and ps.  The postcript print out readable and the jpeg are LARGE on 
netscape and readable via xv.  

I also gzipped the postcript files and put the gzip.exe program in the 
directory for PC users who need to get at the files.  They were just WAY 
too big in native format.

Let me know if you have trouble seeing them.
