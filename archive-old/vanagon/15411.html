Subject: Re: rusted vent-wings

To whomever originally posted this thread of thought-
	the rear left wing on my 78 Westy was rusted horribly when i 
bought it.  Living up here in the land of eternal drizzle, (no- not San 
Fran.- more north-- Seattle), the damn thing leaked so bad on the P.O. it 
rotted out the carpet, wood sink/stove/fridge cabinet back and bottom, 
and made the poor guy's interior a stinkin' mess.  Why he never addressed 
the root of the problem ( the vent wing had ancient-looking 
shipwreck-type rust corrosion), I do not know.
	But *I* did address it.  
	After garaging it and letting it dry some, I ripped out all the interior
stuff, replaced bad wood/carpet etc.
	Then came the fun.  Bye-bye frustrating leak- I kicked the *poop* outta 
that whole back side window- vent wing and 3/4 glass- and replaced it with a 
pretty-lookin' new seal encircling my 1-PIECE window.  
	No more leaks there, mom.

	Jeff
