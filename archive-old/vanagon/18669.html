Subject: Give This Man a Nose


I recently offered the nose off of my '67 parts Bus to Bill Killian 
(killian_at_gcr_dot_com) who is looking for one to build a display cabinet out 
of.  The problem is that he is in West Virginia (?) and I'm in Southwest 
Missouri.  He has planned a trip to Ohio and is willing to come to 
Missouri to pick (up) my nose, however I will be in Maryland that weekend 
(and he has no tools with which to remove my nose).  If anyone is near 
West Virginia (or along the route to Ohio), please offer your nose (if 
you have no use for it) to Bill, as he *really* wants one.
