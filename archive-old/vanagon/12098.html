&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;I think people are making a mistake here. &lt;snip&gt;

thereby removing a triply reposted section.

 I don't care which cylinders valves are being set, at which time, or in 
which order or direction the whole lot rotates. I set the ones closest to my 
face/hands when I'm underneath, then the next closest. Jacking up a wheel 
and rotating it back and forth, once you've located about where the valve is 
fully closed, lets you explore the gap easily. Just keep a slight pull on 
the feeler gauge and note the relative ease with which it slides as you 
rotate the tire backwards and forwards slightly. Your own feel will tell you 
when you have maximum gap position, and you can narrow this down by steadily 
reducing the amount you move the tire back and forth, ie bracketing in on 
the position. Remember, it's the valves you want set quickly, not an in 
depth exploration of the gear slop and backlash between distributor position 
and rocker/valve gap. Them books is all just too confusing!   tim s.


PS: For real fun, set the valves on a Triumph Spitfire, engine running, 
gauge in one hand, screwdriver in other, everything blurred by the rocker 
arm movement.
