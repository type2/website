Subject: replacing windscreen seals

&gt;From: martino_at_EARTHLINK.NET

&gt;If you've got twine (diameter?) in the groove of the seal
&gt;how do you pull it out? Do you grab one end and
&gt;pull...following it around the windshield twice with your
&gt;helper gently pushing on the outside?

Exactly.  As you pull the twine out of the groove and
in toward you, it has the effect of wrapping the inner
part of the rubber seal over the metal of the window
frame.

As for diameter, small enough that two passes of it will
fit in the groove, but large (strong) enough that it
doesn't break when you're pulling it.

Best concrete example?  Try curtain rod cord.

&gt;   What lube do you use?

As for lubricant, I use spray silicone because it's good
for the rubber and doesn't stain the upholstery.  Silicone
on the glass, however, makes for a smeary mess, so be sure
to clean the glass well afterward.  I've heard people
use dish soap (like for mounting tires) but I would think
it leave too much mess under the rubber (and may not be
good for the metal window frame).
