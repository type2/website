A 3-cell Mag-Lite flashlight.

First, because you seldom need to see things three miles away but often need
to check the numbers on a mail box or gate.

Second, because old buses don't have cigaret lighters to plug-in a hand-held
spotlamp.

And third, because your expensive spotlamp breaks all to hell the first time
you hit someone over the head with it.  A Mag-Lite has a 100-head guarantee
and is waterproof; you can wash off the blood.
