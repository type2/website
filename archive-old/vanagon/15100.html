Looks like it may be some kind of blockage in the system probably at the
check valve.    Some of you Joel, T.Smith etc. have mentioned  this
point.  I will try to flush the system and install new fluid.   I will
keep you up to speed as to what is the outcome.  And yes the pump price at
the local VW dealer was $537 and at a local FLAPS it was $569 odd but
true.  Anyway it doesn't look as if it is the pump, lucky me this time
'round.  I will try to take better care of my pump from now on !

Cheers

Frank
