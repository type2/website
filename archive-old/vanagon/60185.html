Subject: List donations update

Howdy,

After only 4 days of mail, we've got $249 in donations.  I'd like to
express my thanks to all those who leapt to action in their overwhelming
zeal to keep the list going.

We've still got a ways to go, so if you haven't sent in your donation yet,
please do so.  Make the check payable to 'Ron Lussier' and send it to:

     Vanagon
     c/o Ron Lussier
     10164 Parkwood Drive #8
     Cupertino, CA  95014-1533

Remember that all donations are logged to
http://www.vanagon_dot_com/links/list_donations.html as they are received, so
you can easily check the current status of the collections effort.

Ron
