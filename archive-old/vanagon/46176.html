Subject: Lowering a Bay


I have just cut-n-turned my '78 bay
front torsion bar by a severe 1&quot;. It is
now resting on the bump stop arms, so I
am going to cut them off and install
some beetle rear gas adjustable short
shocks.

Does this sound ok, the cut-n-turn was
fairly simple, just looking for
assurance that what I am doing is
right!!

Any help would be appreciated.

Duncan
