Subject:      Help re: car detailing

We just took delivery of our (new to us) '86 GL and we would like to have it
detailed inside and out.  We have never had this done before------ is there
any guidance anyone can give us on selecting a detailer.  Are there any
questions we should specifically ask when contacting a shop?
