&gt;
&gt;&gt; in 1964 the Deluxe no logner has corner windows.  And my '64 which is a
&gt;&gt; Deluxe (the kelly blue book says 'Deluxe Wagon' if I go by VIN number) does
&gt;&gt; not have corner window (or sunroof or portholes - sigh).
&gt;
&gt;What *does* it have? Seats? Glass in the Windows? DoeSPOONsn't sound  
&gt;very deluxe so far ; )

Corner windows went away with the wider rear hatch door....
