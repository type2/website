Subject: Eurovan/Winnebago - just a bad dream?

I heard rumors from a few sources that VW was going to be coming
out with a Winnebago conversion of the Eurovan in June of this
year.  Has anybody else heard about this?  The first reports
were that it was going to have a shower and toilet.  That
got dropped in later rumors.  A swimming pool would be nice.

Since it is now July, and I haven't seen any reports on this,
I'm willing to chalk it all up to a bad dream.
