Subject: Pull out refrigerator
Date: Mon, 30 Jun 97 13:24:35 -0400
From: howard_at_aur.alcatel_dot_com


My refrigerator works fine on 12V and 110V but not propane.
As of this season the pilot will light but no cooling. I spoke with
Dometic and they don't have a service manual but said to pull it out
and clean the pipes. Cool - I can probably do that.

My problem is trying to get the fridge out. I took the front frame
off and the wood screws on both sides out. I also took the two bolts
on the left side out. I can now pull it out a little and move it
up and down but it's still attached. As a guess it's the heavy
steel looking tubes attached to the back somewhere. Any hints on 
what else to do to get this beast out? Do I need to take the whole
cabinet with sink and stove apart?

Thanks very much in advance!
