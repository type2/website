Subject:      77 type 2 camper

The auxiliary heater in my camper is defunct.

a.  Should I try to fixit
b.  Let someone else try to fixit
c.  Leave it alone and wear another sweater
d.  remove it and wear another sweater

I dont drive it in the winter time only in the summer so I can justify
living without it if need be.

e.  Are they worth anything?????

Thanks
