OK,

	I don't know if I really want to open this can 'o worms again, but now
that I have a _new_ motor in my bus (the only thing used is the crank)    
I wonder is a synthetic is a good or bad idea.  I also have the doghouse
cooling setup, for what its worth.  I'm also considering a deeper sump setup.
I am not considering a filter setup, though.
