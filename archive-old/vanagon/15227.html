Subject: swamp coolers


I posted something about this about 8 months or so ago, but now
that our list membership has expanded so, I'll take a chance
and repost.  I'm looking for one of those car swamp coolers -
the type from the 40's or so.  One fills them with water,
or ice and water, and they work by evaporative cooling, but
mainly in non-humid warm climates.  I heard there were a few
for sale at the meet in San Jose this past weekend, but was
too late.  Anyway, if anyone has one for sale, or knows of
the whereabouts of one, I'm interested!


Thanks,
