Absolutely true story:
I have bought a 71 Mecrades 220 (2.2L gas) for $75.  It had a bad clutch and 
a number of other things wrong with it, but I pulled the tranny and put a 
new disk into it, and off she went.  She was later sold for $900.

Another true story:
My father in law bought a 75 240D for around $300, this had no floor from 
the pedals to the seat!  Needed a clutch slave cylinder too.  This one is a 
real rough looker- not to be sold very soon.
