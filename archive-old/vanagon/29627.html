&gt; I was thinking of replacing mine with coloured acetate from an art supply
&gt; store but wanted to get other opinions.
&gt; 

I asked this same question to a fellow vwber around here, expecting
to hear him say &quot;acetate from an art supply store.&quot;  What he said
was &quot;colored magic marker&quot;  :)  his idiot lights looked great,
by the way.  Mine are all a uniform medium orange color, except
for the high beam indicator, which is blue.

What color is the turn signal indicator supposed to be?
