Subject: Re: MatchBox bus.

There were a couple different 'camper-like' split window bus matchbox 
cars.  I seem to remember a greenish one and later a silver one.  Wish I 
still had them both.  I have seen them in flea markets.  Though the 
silver might have been a bay window...

&gt; I have been collecting them for more years than I can remember and if 
&gt; any one has one to sell or knows where I could get a pre '80 bus It 
&gt; would make an excellent addition to my collection.  A white '72 to 
&gt; match my bus would be the cats petunias.  I am not picky about 
&gt; condition and hot wheels and ertl have also made their way into my 
&gt; collection over time.
&gt; Thanks.
