Subject: 87 vanagon oil light when cold

Hi All

Fist off an apology for not making it clear on my first post that it was an
intro of myself as well as a reply to westies in the Maritimes.

After thinking that everything was solved with the oil warning it does not
seem to be completly cured.
Here is what is happening:
When I start the engine and drive away it will buzz at about 2200RPM if and
only if I do not let the temperature gauge climb to its full operating
temperature at an idle.  Once the light and buzzer come on it seems that I
have to shut off the enging and then restart it and all is fine.

Here is what I have done:
I have changed the oil to 20W-50 and replaced the filter with a new VW one.



This being a new van to me can anybody tell me if this is normal or if I
should be looking for another problem.  This did not happen when I took it
out for a test drive.

Thanks

PS We had a great trip and I love it as a camping vehicle and the drive is
super!
