dyer:

re: the 66' manual you are looking for. Are you looking for the owners
manual or a 66' Westy manual? I could trade you my a copy of my67' Westy
Parts Manual and a 65 Owners manual for copies of your 73' and 72' manuals.
Let me know.

Michael


&gt;I've got the both manuals that came with my 1973 Westfalia and the owners
&gt;for the 1972.  I have nothin' for the '66, darn.  Add me to the list...
&gt;(anybody willing to send me a copy of a '66 owners manual?  I'll pay.)
&gt;
&gt;Cheers,
