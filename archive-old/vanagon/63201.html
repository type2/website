Hi John, I just spent roughly two weeks on the go on less than one tankful
of propane. The fridge ran approx. 20 hrs. a day on propane and 4 hrs. on
12 volt. On average I used the burners for 1 to 2 meals a day.
Still haven't filled it up and it even made ice cubes for evening
libations.
Hope that helps....Harry (85 Westy)
