This came through my inbox, but I think it was intended for the entire
Vanagon list.

Let me explain my recent trip through Columbus to all my friends at the
vanagon mailing list.  I have a 1983 VW Vanagon-- the last of the
air-cooleds!!!  Had it been completely up to a Dr. James Cowan in Columbus,
the &quot;import doctor&quot; as he prefers to refer to himself, it would have lost its
status as last of the air cooleds because it would have ceased to exist. 

On my way from, Indianapolis to Philadelphia, I broke down on the outskirts
of Columbus and the good doctor appeared on the highway to offer assistance.
 He was very helpful and a member of LIMBO so I couldn't believe my good
fortune.  He had my van towed to his shop and promised to take a look at it.
 He did, and the situation was poor.  A previously improperly sealed gasket
had allowed the oil to vaporize resulting in the engine running on empty--oil
that is.  I had lost my black gold or texas tea all over the interstate and
unbeknownst to me at the time, my &quot;savior&quot; would prove to have the mechanical
prowess and professionalism of Jed Clampett.  I arranged to have Dr. Cowan
&quot;fix&quot; my van to the tune of $1500-- a sour tune as might be able to guess--
and I would pick it up at 5pm a week later. I understand delays occur, but I
must admit to have been a little disappointed to have found  the entire
engine still disassembled-- sweet dreams and german machines in pieces on the
ground.  He did not finish work until 2am.  From watching him &quot;operate&quot;, I
suspect this had less to do with his being a hard worker than the possibility
he had mostly squandered the first 3 days as by his  own admission he had
&quot;been working non stop on this the last 2 days.&quot;  To which I replied, &quot;you've
had a week.&quot;  Silence.  But, to be fair, things creep up to cause delays and
I paid him in good faith.  I was confident the van would be in fine shape
thereafter as he had promised both my father and I that &quot;now that it was done
right, the van will last into the 100,000s.&quot;  I should have asked if this
figure was calculated in miles or seconds.
Two weeks later, I broke down again.  
AAA towed me to a hotel and I called Dr. Cowan.  His assistant assured me
&quot;everything would be taken care of except transportation as no mechanic takes
care of that.&quot;  Well, she was partly correct.  Except that this mechanic
didn't take care of anything let alone transportation to another mechanic who
found slipshod work previously performed by the good doctor.  Jim promised he
would take care of expenses and in a gesture to prove his bedside manner
revoked on that promise and sent us a warm but terse note that he was not
responsible for any damages and that furthermore any inquiries should be
directed to his lawyer.  Warms the heart to know that there are such good
people in the world, huh?  Although he is a member of LIMBO, I do not think
he displays the qualities that most stranded travellers are seeking.  To be
fair, LIMBO has already sent their official disapproval of his actions.
 Please feel free to respond with similar stories, compassion, comments,
and/or advice.

Sincerely,
