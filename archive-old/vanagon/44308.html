Subject: [/f] VW hazard lights and flashing karma symbols

The other day when I had my clutch cable / cleavis pin problem on my
way to work, I also had a friend with me, carpooling and all that good
stuff (his brand new reliable truck is in the shop again, second time
in the three months he has had it.  He has stopped giving me greif
about the necessity of having a reliable vehicle, and realizes I have
one:).  Anyway, when we broke down (momentarily) he was amazed that
within two minutes of jumping out of the bus and shimmying underneath,
another bus arrived to give us a hand, or a push start in this case. 

I tried to explain to him that whenever VW busses turn on their hazard
lights, a huge karmic VW symbol is projected from the roof into the
sky, notifying all other buses in the area one of their bretheren
needs help, just like the BAT SIGNAL.  He was a little skeptical.  So
I asked him how many FORD trucks drove past him when he was broken
down on the side of the road, and of those how many stopped to help.
The next question was me asking agin how many miles he had to walk to
get to a pay phone to call for help.

He was a little more inclined to believe the karmic VW symbol in the
sky story, and is liking my bus more and more each day:)

take care all,
