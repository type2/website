Subject:       Re: fitting stereo advice needed

&gt;     Has anybody on the list fitted a stereo including
&gt;     amps etc. into their van, i was thinking about doing
&gt;     it, and could do with a bit of advice.

Yep!  Did it in the Pioneer ('57 Samba).  The secret:  
VELCRO!!! (tm) (R) (C) (etc)... 

Please don't cut a hole in the dash where the AM is!  A PO did it to 
my '67.  It was very conveninet, but I always wanted the origianl AM 
look.

Anyhow, I installed a deck on the shelf right below the AM.  A friend 
of mine had lots of velcro.  I stuck some on the shelf, and some on 
the radio, and the thing hasn't moved since!  And it is easily 
undo-able.
