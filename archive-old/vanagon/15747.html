&gt; couple of small rust holes) Also a bunch of glass. I am looking for
&gt; windscreen glass, if I cant get some soon I am getting saftey glass cut.

Congratulations! You will really enjoy this vehicle. You will also go 
crazy from thinking about it all the time. You will also get much help 
from people on the list, especially from me 'cause I have the exact same 
vehicle.
