&gt;I replace these in my cars all the time.  All of my cars have had Bosch

&gt;than $30.  $56 for a voltage regulator seems real high.

I just had to do this to the Syncro about three weeks ago.  Metric Auto Parts
in St. Paul wanted $65 for the Bosch regulater and about $30 for a Hong Kong
replacement.  Burnsville VW wanted $56 for the Bosch.  So, I figured that
since Burnsville VW was more on the way home from Fort Snelling than St. Paul
was and since my VW Club discount at Metric is 10% and Burnsville VW is 15%,
I went there.  Total with tax was under $52.

Work for me.
