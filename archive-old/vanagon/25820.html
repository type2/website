Well... I didn't get my license until I was 21.  I've got a few tickets 
when I was 21-22, but I got off a few by fighting them.  But I didn't 
have any convictions when I was looking for insurance.  :)

Leading a pure and virtous and rightious life, I didn't get a ticket until I
was about 38, in, of all things, a used diesel Rabbit I had just bought!!. 
Cop with a radar parked under the speed limit sign on a wiiiide 4 lane
throughfare.  Speed limit was 30(?) and I was just kinda goin' along - got
tagged for 48 mph.
