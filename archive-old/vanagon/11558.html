Subject: '71 Bus rear brake backing plate

Hey yall.

(After three days with a kaput net connection, all is well again. Wshew!)

My '71 Bus recently failed its inspection for two reasons.
The biggest (at least hardest to fix) is that the
emergency brake does not work on the passengers side.
It works fin on the drivers side, and will stop the bus from
30 MPH, and hold it on the hills, but the guy wants to
see it work on both sides. 

The cable is frozen in the tube that runs from the bottom of
the bus to the brake backing plate. The tube is welded to the plate,
and the VW dealer cant order a new plate because it is an obsolete
part. What do I do now? How hard is it to pull a new E-brake cable?
Do you think that would work, with some lube in the rusty guide?

Help, cant have my Vroomhilde grounded!
