&gt; &gt; Ha... my mail program (MS Mail) does just the opposite. It always names
&gt; &gt; the list as the sender, so replies go directly to the list with no
&gt; &gt; intervention on my part... and I wish it named the individual poster
&gt; &gt; instead! I guess the grass is always greener...

With Eudora (Macintosh, at least), there are several options available in
the &quot;Re: Replying&quot; section of the &quot;Settings...&quot; selection of the &quot;Special&quot;
menubar pulldown.

IMHO, &quot;reply to&quot; SHOULD be to the poster and one's mail program should be
set so as to require an extra step to reply to the list, so as to keep
traffic on the list from mushrooming even more.
