&gt; 
&gt; These tubes can actually be stretched back to their original length (Muir
&gt; describes the procedure). Better yet is to buy new ones with NEW seals of
&gt; course. DC -- 
&gt; 
  I think that only applies to the tubes for the 1600 and you have to pull 
  the head off to do it. Pushrod tubes are cheap anyway, so you might as
  well get a new one.
