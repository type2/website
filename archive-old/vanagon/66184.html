Subject:      Subaru engine swaps

I got info from Kennedy engineering (805) 272-1147 and they have a nice
table and information on the various Subaru engines you could place in a
Vanagon. Since I have not seen the info on the group - I thought I'd
duplicate it here for those interested:

a: reccomended
b: rare
c: due to milder cam and longer stroke may not be as suitable with Vanagon
gearing
d: Rare, takes the same basic adapter kit as the 4-cyl. Avoid the '88-'89
6-cyl as it
    makes only 145hp from 2672cc, does not have a counterbalanced crank and
requires
    different adapters.

Kennedy kit prices range from $860 to $1793 depending on what model Vanagon
you have and what transmission.
