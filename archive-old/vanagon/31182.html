Subject: carrying extra gas


I asked this once a long time ago, but the list was so small then, so
will ask again. 

You know those polyethelyene carriers for water which are collapsable?
I know that these are not suitable/safe for carrying gasoline, but am
wondering if something like it exists made out of some other material.  It's
the collapsable feauture I like - the fact that you could reduce space
when not carrying gas.  Anyone know of such a thing?

I'm aware of the &quot;hidden&quot; kind which fit into the spare tire, etc., but
what I have in mind is different.

Anyway, if anyone has heard of such an animal, or could invent one, please
let me know!
