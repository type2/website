Subject: Re: Split window brakes

     &gt;would not be fun.  I think the master has *never* been worked on!
     &gt;
     &gt;Have any of you made any cool upgrades to the brakes and what work 
     &gt;was required?
     &gt;
     
     You'd probably be suprised if you fitted a new master, new shoes, 
     cylinders, fluid and had the drums skimmed. That's what i did to mine 
     and it stops just fine.
     
     You could fit discs to the front as an alternative. You can do this 
     two ways. 1) Get hold of the kingpin, disc conversion kit - expensive
     2) Fit a '68 Ball joint beam straight to your bus, then replace the 
     drums and hubs with the disc setup off a later bus (&gt;'79), they just 
     go straight on. But beware, I've heared that changing to discs 
     requires an appropriate master cylinder, with a pressure release valve 
     in it (your brakes will lock otherwise).
     
     I would aggree that discs are better than drums, after changing from a 
     late bay to a split.
