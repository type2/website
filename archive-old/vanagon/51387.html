Subject: Re: Syncro Vibration problem

&gt;|  Well I think I have hit the last big problem with this Syncro.
&gt;|    At about 45 MPH the van vibrates. At 60 MPH, smooths out again. 
&gt;|    Sometime ago I had a car with a bent drive shaft, it feels 
&gt;|    the same. With the car, you could see the shaft as it turned, 
&gt;|    that it was bent. In the syncro I can't find any sign of a 
&gt;|    driveshaft problem. Has anyone had a vibration Like this?

	I had a similiar problem with a little Fiat. The tie rods had
gone...
