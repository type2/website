Subject: Power Windows
From: jcunning_at_snow.win_dot_net (John H. Cunningham)

        The right window in my '90 Vanagon GL goes down, but not up.
Neither the right or left door switch will bring it up. Any
suggestions? 
        Also the power windows do not work. The fuse is OK.The
circuit diagrams in the Bently book are sure difficult to read.
What is the trick?
        Thanks
