Subject: More Hiccups

In regards to the recent hiccup discussion, en route to Denver about two 
months ago, I experienced the infamous symptoms in my '85.  Pulled into 
Pendelton, OR where I proceeded to unload my entire life's possesions 
into my room at the Vagabond Inn.  (Dresser, Desk, Bed, Boxes, 
Bookshelf, etc.)  Housekeepers thought I had lost my mind, but I had to 
get into the engine compartment.  Swapped out harness on Monday morning 
when Obie's Import Repair opened up.  Never a problem since.

Kudos to Obie for having the part in stock.  So strange to find such a 
great VW parts/service shop in a land where us VeeWees get the scowl 
from 4X4 Ram Chargers with 35 inch Super Swampers.  If you are ever 
driving on I-84 through the &quot;Wool Capital of the World&quot; stop by and say 
hi to the man.  Great guy.

Later, 

Jon
