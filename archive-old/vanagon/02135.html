Subject: hooking up gas heater

D.W.Carment inquires about difficulty in installing a gas heater.  I've neither
installed nor removed a Type II heater, but did work with one in a Thing.
They are pretty self-contained.  They need the electrical connections from the
green timer switch, fuel (although they have their own pump separate from the
engine), and space to take in air and exhaust exhaust.  The one in the Vanagon
is in VW's own parts books and is discussed in the Bentley book so you can
read about it before you buy one.  It is pretty well protected behind the
van's belly pan, so only the exhaust pipe tends to rust badly, which mine has
done.

If I were considering one, I would hit the ads in HotVWs first, to see how
prices go for new/rebuilt ones, then contact the wrecking yards, LIMBO ads, etc.
