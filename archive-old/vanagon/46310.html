Subject: Re: Westfalia tent setup



&gt; 4) even with a tent for a good sized trailer camper (and the typical bunch
&gt; of loose tent poles that you have to match up), this procedure requires a
&gt; maximum of 2 people (and I once in a while did it alone), and takes about 10
&gt; minutes. It helps if you color-(bar)code (w/ tape) the matching ends of all
&gt; tent poles.....
&gt; 

As I recall the poles cames from the factory with red and green tape for just such a 
reason.
