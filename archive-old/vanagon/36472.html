Becoming  Breeders...

Rusty ended up with 8 on the property before Mrs. VanBondo laid down the
law. The buses kept on multiplying like bunnies after Easter.   It didnt
help that we were starving, I wasnt out of grad school yet and the part time
restaurant job didn't come close to floating the bills.  She finally went
postal on me and threatened nasty things (Bobbitt) if I didnt sit down and
finalize the Thesis.  That proved my hypothesis! ;) The thesis was easy to
write after that final bit of research was gathered!

BTW: We are &quot;down&quot; to three and have magically moved to a house with zip for
a back yard. Hmmm...
