Subject: For Trade: 1967 Camper

A friend of mine has a '67 camper he'll trade for a super beetle. Body is
straight, but has some rust. Mechanically, this bus is excellent. Has
professionally rebuilt 1600 engine with about 200 miles on it. If you're
interested, please e-mail him directly (Lloyd Fink: lfink_at_comp.uark_dot_edu).

The bus is in North Central Arkansas.
