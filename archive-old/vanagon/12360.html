Subject: Re: 67 &amp; Earlier TII Full Metal Roof Rack


&gt;I need some bucks, so I am offering my length metal roof rack for 67 &amp; 
&gt;earlier Type II's for sale.  It's in **very** good condition with all 
&gt;original hardware.  No ladder.  $175. I'd rather not ship it.

Jon,

I am interested.  I am not going to be in the St. Louis area until Buses 
by the Arch in May.  Are you going to any shows in the southeast before
then?  If not can you hold it for me?  How soon do you need the money?
Any rust?

Thanks,
