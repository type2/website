Subject: Re: Lousy idle and 009 dist.

&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I have seen a adaptor that lets you use a 30 pict carb on a dual port 
&gt;&gt; manifold, and believe it or not, he too was using a 009.  This engine idled 
&gt;&gt; really well. 
&gt;
&gt;if this adaptor is a metal spacer plate, about 3/8&quot; thick, then I have
&gt;heard bad things about it. If you actually look at the plate, it is a
&gt;sharp bend in the path of the gas down into the cylinders. This is badly
&gt;inefficient. On the good side however, I happily run a 009 and 30/31
&gt;pict on my single port '67.

I have recently put a 30 pict carb on my dual port ghia engine in my 71 bus,
with a 009  distributor. I used an adaptor plate and have had some
difficulties (gas oozing around the gasket), but I have not had any luck
with 34 pict carbs so I thought I would try the 30. I also installed a
header and a quiet pack muffler, which has worked nicely.  Richard is right
the adaptor appears to be inefficient, but anything is better than the old
peice o' crap I previously had on my intake.

I use the force when I time my engine and adjust the idle, I have tried with
the static and stobocopic to get it right, but I alway do it better by ear.
