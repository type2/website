&gt;According to Anthony, they didn't start making
&gt;walkthroughs till approximately 1963, so that
&gt;there were only about 5 years of splits (63-67)
&gt;that could have been a walkthrough.

My surfing buddy has a '59, and it is a walkthru
It also came with the synchronised tranny, and not the split case (he bought
the bus used in '68 and has driven it daily since - hows that for 
longevity?) 

I think 59 1/x is the changeover point for the synchro trannys...
