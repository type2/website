Have you checked your coolant level?
Does the van run ok after it has warmed up?
How many miles are on the van?

I don't want to get you alarmed but I had a similar problem with my 84'
It turned out to be leaking coolant into the combustion chamber.  I
started noticing that it always blew white smoke particularly on cold
mornings, once warmed up whatever gap there was would shrink and the van
would run fine.

&gt; hello all,
&gt;
&gt; My '84 westy just developed an idle/stalling problem.  when I start the
&gt; van it
&gt; begins to backfire, run rough, and knock, then stalls.  if I give it some
&gt; gas it get slightly better but begins to blow white smoke.  It has run
&gt; fine upto this point, it started this just after a 4 hour trip on which
&gt; it performed fine.
&gt; I've checked all the wires and every thing seems to be fine.
&gt; any help would be great, I need to get my van running again!
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
