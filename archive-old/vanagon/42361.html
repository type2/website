Subject: RMMW part problem -- beware! :)

Hey all,
Just to let you know, I ordered the rear hatch panel from RMMW a while ago for
my '78 bus.  You know, the black panel that fastens to the back door.  Well, it
was backordered for a long time and today it finally came, looked really sharp.
However, it didn't have the holes in it for the clips -- don't know about you
but on my bus the old rear hatch panel was held on by thumbtack-looking clips
that went thru the panel into the holes in the door, not like the standard panel
clips that VW uses.  I've seen other buses like this, so I assume this is how VW
made it.  Well, RMMW's part has the standard clip type holes that don't go all
the way thru.  OK, I say, I'll just use my extra regular clips to put it on.

By now you know that it's not that simple.  I went out to the bus to put it on
and the holes in the panel don't match up to the holes in the door!!  They're
not even close at all!  So I say, hmm this is a very expensive poorly designed
panel.  

So I think, well maybe I can MAKE it fit.  So I get out the punch and proceed to
make four holes that do line up with the holes in the hatch.  Looks like it
might work, but then I take the thumbtack clips and push them in and the panel
is too thick, i.e. the part of the clip that holds the panel in the holes is
still in the panel, so nothing is holding this panel on.  

They advertise this panel as being for '68-'79 buses but things must have
changed somewhere because it does not even come close to fitting my  '78.  I
will send it back for a refund.  I hope they take it even with the holes in it.
They should because it's not going to fit on anyone else's bus either.

Wish me luck,
Sean
