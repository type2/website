Subject: Is owning a van probable cause?
Date: Thu, 15 Jun 1995 13:31:01 -0600 (MDT)

I'm planning on driving my '77 non-hippie, normal colored, van from here
in Lubbock to Tacoma WA for school.  What are you all's experiences with
getting stopped/harassed by police for driving a van?  Being an 18 year
old male probably doesn't help... have any of you actually been pulled
over and serched for drugs?
Since I'm not the original owner (it is only 4 months younger than me),
should I worry about someone's stach hidden in the seat cushin or
something? 
Or is it stupid to worry about that since I don't use drugs?

Ben


Remember:  just because you're not paranoid, doesn't mean they're not out
to get you.
