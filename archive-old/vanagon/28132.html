Does it strike anyone else as odd (or amusing) that my thirty-year-old
get-that-polluting-piece-of-junk-off-the-road-you-hippie microbus gets
better mileage than a brand-new van (it seems like the numbers Herr
Tommaselli quotes are typical for any of the major manufacturers'
vans)?  My last fill-up (yesterday) came out dead on 22 mpg (US
measurements).  This is with a mix of city and highway driving, mostly
with either some cargo or passengers.

Bemusedly,
