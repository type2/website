Subject: humming synchro


Test drove my first synchro at a ford dealership Sunday.  It was a 1989 
Carat with 168,000 miles, asking price somewhere between 10 &amp; 12 K.
After shifing into 4th it began making a fairly loud whinning sound, much 
like all terrain tires make at high speed, only I'm pretty sure it was 
coming from the transmission. The pitch varied with the speed.  The 
salesman said all synchros do this. Was he speaking with forked tongue?

Thanks for your help,


Mike Ransom, Wanabus(Synchro, straight vanagon)
