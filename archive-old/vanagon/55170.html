Subject: Re: TDC ?

You've got a good grasp on the definition of TDC. Don't try to confuse
yourself by reading books. :)

&gt;I've always understood TDC as position at which the #1 piston is at the
&gt;top of the cyclinder (viewable with a light down the spark plug or
&gt;air intake holes on the top side of the head), and the rotor is just
&gt;coming in-line with the notch on the distributor. This also coincides with
&gt;the 0 degree indendation in the fan (timing scale). All of this
&gt;corresponds to the end of the compression stroke (both intake and exhaust
&gt;valved closed and the pison has moved from the bottom of the cylinder to
&gt;the top compressing the air-fuel mixture) ... just before the plug is
&gt;about to fire.
