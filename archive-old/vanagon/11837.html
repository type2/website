So Ron Lussier says:
&gt; 
&gt; I'm very curious, and I haven't seen any questions to my last question: How
&gt; does one get into the upper bunk on a Camper?
&gt; 

Well, when Linda's there, I just have here bend over and I jump on her
back and Ali-oop it up to the bunk... ;)

Otherwise......

I just step off the front driver seat pedestal and the sink top and
up I go.  Sometimes I use the extra ice chest.

Cheers!
