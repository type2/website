Subject: Re: what is under the passengers feet? (subwoofer mounting)

It would be really nice to see a picture of your installation.

Would it be possible to have one posted on a web page some where?

I'd like to see just how much leg room this installation might take up.

&gt; Volks,
&gt; 	After much thought and many hours of crappy sounding music, I've
&gt; finally purchased a subwoofer for my van.  I don't really listen to loud
&gt; music (mostly bluegrass, really), and I already have a pretty good
&gt; stereo and speakers, but any bass I could hear at a stoplight went away
&gt; with the highway noise--you know how it is.  This subwoofer is a small
&gt; one, a six and a half inch round tube about 19 inches long that will fit
&gt; under the glove box in my 90 camper without really intruding on any leg
&gt; room (my girlfriend has short legs).  Its made by SAS Bazooka (stupid
&gt; name) and sounds great.  Anyway, I need to mount it to the floor and
&gt; before I do, I wanted to find out if I was going to damage anything by
&gt; shooting some sheet metal screws thru the floor under the glovebox.  To
&gt; give you some idea of where I'm thinking doing this, it would be about
&gt; toe level of anyone with their legs stretched out, maybe hidden from the
&gt; line of sight by the bottom of the glove box.  Anyone know whats under
&gt; there or if I'll screw anything up?
&gt;
&gt; TIA.
&gt;
&gt; 	By the way, I've looked into all kinds of possibilities for improving
&gt; the low-end of the music spectrum in that van.  I put a wedge subwoofer
&gt; behind the drives seat (not really enough room to sound really good),
&gt; boxes between the front seats (takes up too much space, although one
&gt; might make a nice console if cupholders were added), under the back seat
&gt; (too muffled and took up too much storage space), on the floor in front
&gt; of back seat (too noticable to would-be theives). And any speakers
&gt; mounted in the doors just can't deliver the low-end.  So I finally
&gt; decided on this SAS Bazooka tube.  Its has an 80 watt amp built in and
&gt; was very easy to hook up (5 wires) and is rather inconspicuious under
&gt; the glove box--and will be even more so with a little carpet thrown over
&gt; it.  I don't have any connection with this company or anything, but for
&gt; some of us I know music is important and I thought I'd pass this little
&gt; gem along.  Cost me $300.
