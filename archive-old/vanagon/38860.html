Subject: Antenna questions (Splittie w/Safaris)

The discussion regarding symbol anti theft stategies got me thinking about
antennas in splitties...

I am installing German Safaris in the '67 Westy Resto from Hell. I left the
antenna in the passanger sidestock location. Now I kinda wish that I had
moved it to the middle but it's too late. The bus finally got painted and
there is NO WAY that I am going to mess with the body and paint again if I
can help it.
*The questions are: 
Where can I get antennas that are bent with two 90 degree angles to &quot;go
around&quot; the safari?
 Is this a after market item or a garage/vice manuever?
Has anyone on the list done this or have recommendation one way or another?
Thanks, -ellis\
