Great!

My motor is leaking badly 1.9 DG gas wasserboxer 1984

It is the gaskets.

I am no routined mechanic, so I tend not to try to repair the heads with
epoxy as some did.

No.

I go for a good used motor.

Are there any German subscribers who have tips on where to get one in
good shape and with some guarentee. Or has one for sale. I'd be happy
for a reply.

Or anyone who is ready to lend a hand on the repair? I live close to the
german border and could go to somewhere in northern Germany for the
surgery.

Love from

Knud
