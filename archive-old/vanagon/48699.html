&gt;&gt;b.  On the trip I wore old, comfortable clothing, including lace-up boots and
&gt;&gt;suspenders.  (Americans tend to wear newer, more stylish clothing of a type
&gt;&gt;grossly impractical for the Canadian out-back.) ....
&gt;
&gt;Haaa hooo haha!! 
&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;c.  My smile is filled with dental disasters.  (Americans tend to have
&gt;&gt;prettier teeth than Canadians.)

&gt;
&gt;Cmon Bob, now you're hitting below the belt. The out-back stuff is
&gt;funny, but once you start insulting our teeth...
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;In both of these cases I assume the people thought I was Canadian based on
&gt;&gt;factors mentioned above since I made no conscious effort to 'appear'
&gt;&gt;Canadian.  I am an American.  And proudly so.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Have you ever considered that they thought you were Canadian because
&gt;you were IN CANADA??? Besides, most of you guys have such a heavy
&gt;drawl and can't pronounce 'eh' properly... :)
&gt;
&gt;Apologies for the waste of bandwidth..
