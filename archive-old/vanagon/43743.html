Subject: Coolant light flashing
Date: Thu, 6 Jun 1996 09:09:52 -0400 (EDT)


My coolant light started to flash all of a sudden. Normally it flashes
only initially during starting and stops flashing after 30 secs.
Temp seems to be normal and expansion and filler tank seems to be at 
right level
What could be wrong ?
Can anyone help ?
