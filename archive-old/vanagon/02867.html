&gt;Off the top of my head I remember reading 5-10 HP can be pulled from a
&gt;auto a/c, but looking at the other stuff up there that might be wrong.
&gt;
&gt;If you have 130HP then 10 HP isnt such a terrible price to pay .
&gt;
&gt;I think the problem with the Peltier approach is you have to ship
&gt;100's amps around the car in a way that Joe/Jane Citizen wont kill
&gt;themselves with it, not so much the thermo of the problem, but there
&gt;still are lots of things to look into here before giving up ....
&gt;


Yes but remember that 100 amps x 12 V = 1200 W
1200 W / (746 W/hp) = 1.6 horsepower

10 hp is 620 amps at 12 V

The key to making a system like this work is the trade-off of efficiency of 
the electric to thermal conversion vs. mechanical to thermal of a 
refrigeration system.  DC to DC voltage boosting will decrease the current, 
but create a voltage hazard akin to an ignition system and add another 10% 
of inefficiency.  I'm all for it but a lot of engineering is needed; it is 
not a &quot;bolt-on&quot; of an existing technology.
