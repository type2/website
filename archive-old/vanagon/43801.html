Hello,
Sorry to waste the bandwidth on a question for the list manager. A mailing 
list that I subscribe to for the Moulton Bicycles is looking to change it's 
address. Since subscribing to this list in digest format, I've been able to 
keep up with the flood of info in a timely matter. Could someone send me 
details regarding the program used by this list? I will then forward it 
onto the technical people in charge of setting up the new Moulton list.
Thanks,
Matt Dekker
