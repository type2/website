Subject: Re: Syncro air cleaners

 The Syncro air filter has a steel top and bottom and a larger paper element.
The whole element is much larger and incredibly heavy duty. It looks like it
was made for industrial use. I don't know if it makes any difference for day
to day driving but it gives you a feeling that no dirt is going to get into
your engine through it. It is a cheap way to feel invulnerable.
