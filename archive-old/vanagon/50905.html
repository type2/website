Subject: Non-Bus VW Service Manual (Bentley) Prices

As a result of my announcement of reduced Bentley manual prices the other 
day, I have received a number of queries from list members about non-Bus 
manuals. Since I've had so many requests, I thought I'd make it easier on 
myself and post the pricing on the books most frequently asked for:	
		GOLF/GTI/JETTA ('85-92)				$35.00
		BEETLE/SUPERBEETLE/KARMANN GHIA ('70-79)  $28.50
		BEETLE/KARMANN GHIA ('66-69)			$31.00
		BEETLE/KARMANN GHIA ('61'65)			$66.00
		TYPE 3/FASTBACK/SQUAREBACK ('68-73)		$29.00

I'll be placing a Bentley order within the next couple of days. Shipping 
and payment instructions repeated below from the previous post for your 
convenience.

&gt;	Prices exclude shipping &amp; insurance, as follows:
&gt;	East of Mississippi $4.00.   West of Mississippi, $5.50. 
&gt;	Priority Mail (&quot;2-3 day&quot; delivery) $6.75 anywhere in US
&gt;	Pa. residents add 6% tax.  Canadians, e-mail me.

&gt;I'll continue to accept list members' personal checks (haven't been burned 
&gt;once!), or can COD for $4.50 extra.  Usually can ship within a day or so 
&gt;of getting your check, especially if you e-mail me and let me know it's 
&gt;coming.  Can also get other Bentley's and Haynes manuals, but, alas, not 
&gt;the fabled Eurovan manual.

&gt;Send to:
&gt;Ron Salmon
&gt;619 Layfield Rd.
&gt;Perkiomenville, Pa. 18074
