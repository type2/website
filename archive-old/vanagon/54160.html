Subject: Optimal bus to bring to Germany, perhaps more realistic alternatives.

Ok, perhaps not everyone shares my enthusiasm for a TDI engine
conversion project. Here are some other alternatives:

In reverse price order:

1/New '97 EV-Winnie US$38k

2/Used '95 EV-Winnie around US$25k-27k

3/Used '93 EV MV around US$15k ??

4/Used '90 or '91 Vanagon Westy around US$10k

5/Used earlier (83.5-89) watercooled Vanagon Westy US$4-7k

6/Used earlier (80-83) aircooled Vanagon Westy US$2-4k

Notes: 3/ is not a full camper. The winnie conversion (1/ and 2/)
is not availible in Europe, so parts service on the camper equipment
may be difficult to obtain. 2/ and 3/ may be difficult to find locally,
since few were sold in the US. While new and newer used vehicles are
more expensive in Europe than USA, the price gap narrows for older
ones, so for 5/ and 6/ purchase price may be less of a reason to
bring a US vehicle to Europe. (You can instead sell your free
US -&gt; Germany vehichle allowance to me... ;-)

Also, do you need to register your vehicle with the German TUV, or
will they ley you drive a US registered vehicle? (As a tourist
you are allowed (by some old international treaty) to drive a
foreign registered vehicle, but if you live and work in a country
you are most likely required to register it locally, unless the
military has managed to get some special treatment by the Germans
due to the time limited nature of a military assignment.

If you need to register it in Germany, read Marcus' points below
on importing a camper to Germany.

For importing cars to Germany:

1. to avoid import taxes you have to have been in the US for at least one
year, and owned the vehicle for at least 6 months.

2. the car has to pass technical inspection (TUV) and smog inspection.

3. the car has to be modified to german standards - mainly front and rear
lights and instrumentation (km/h)

4. if that exact car/engine combination is not available (therefore unknown)
to the german TUV, then engine output, max. vehicle speed and noise level
(inside and outside, idle and certain speed) have to be determined since
they will be stated in the german title

5. if (in this case) it is a camper with propane tank, the whole propane
system has to be visually checked whether it meets german standards and
pressure-checked whether it is safe

6. US-campers are equipped for 110V/60Hz external power (and the US
connectors), this would have to be changed to german system (220V/50Hz) and
connectors
