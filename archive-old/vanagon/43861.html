Subject: Re: Thule stuf

Ian, (This may be of interest to all on the list...the same deal applies)

First of all Thule does have an 800 number , I'm not working today but I'll
get it to you next week and they'll get you a catalogue.  We can ship UPS to
you...with this offer, 10% off retail and free shipping. (Thule will drop
ship for its dealers.)

Ok, re the rack.  Here's what I do.  I have the super high feet which do
clear the westy rack.  With 65 inch bars mounted to the luggage rack area of
the roof rack you can mount one fork mount bike (or upright bike on each side
and still pop the top without removing the bikes. ( Thule also makes 78 inch
bars avaialable by special order only.)   When I carry sea kayaks and canoes
I slide the second bar back and pop the boats and the bikes on then remove at
the campsite along with the second bar.  This is the safest way to carry
boats and bikes.  I wouldn't mount fake rain gutters in the pop top.  I did
this to mine before the super high feet came out and it's alot of extra
weight on the roof with even one bar on.

I'll have the thule number for you next week....

Also we are a dealer for The North Face, Patagonia, Mountain Hardware etc.
 This list has saved me tons in repairs and I'll offer list members &quot;good&quot;
deals on great outdoor gear.

Regarding the thule awning..._dot_can't get it to work the the westy top up so I
don't advise it used for Westy's .  Great for other buses with Thule racks
however,

I'll be in touch
