&gt; &gt;Just for the record,
&gt; &gt;San Diego Spedo Tach , on India St, will sell the gear. I think I paid
&gt; &gt;about $9 for one about 5 years ago.
&gt; &gt;Bob Bellanca
&gt; 
&gt; I just called:
&gt; 
&gt; Speedo-Tach San Diego Inc 
&gt;                 1569 1st Ave 
&gt;                 San Diego, CA 92101-3001 
&gt;                 619-235-0314
&gt; 
&gt; The man I spoke with there knew just what I was talking about before I
&gt; really described it and said to send them the old little plastic odometer
&gt; gear as a sample and they would send back a new one, for &quot;about 8 bucks&quot;.
&gt; 
&gt; I was so surprised I forgot to ask his name, and if that included S&amp;H,
but I
&gt; doubt it could.  Anyway, there it is.
&gt; 
&gt; I don't know them and have no experience or anything with them, so Caveat
&gt; Emptor...
