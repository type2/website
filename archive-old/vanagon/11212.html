&gt;Has anyone else done this?  Should you use a deep discharge marine type
&gt;battery for the aux.?  Also, is there a way to figure the amount of time the
&gt;power will last before aux. battery drains?  Is it worth it, or will lights
&gt;and radio drain the battery in an hour or so anyway?

I set up twin batteries in the notcback I used to have, to power a 
monster stereo.  Worked great!

I am thinking about doing something like this in my 56, but with a twist.
The bus is 6V, and I wanna run a 12V deep cycle for the fridge and
any other stuff I decide to put in.  What would I have to do to get the
6V to charge the deep cycle?

I am assuming it _can_ be done.
