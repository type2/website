Subject: oil temp sensor opinions ?

     


     
     hi all - 
     
     This weekend's project is to put an oil pressure and tempature gauge 
     in my 82 vanagon.  Is a pressure gauge useful ? 
     
     I'm owndering what the common widom is on tempature senders.  
     Specifically dip stick senders vs. installing one in the oil plate 
     underneath the engine (having the sender on a T connector with both 
     pressure and temp was not recommended at a FLAP).  I presume that 
     all's needed to install the sender in the oil plate is to drill a hole 
     in the plate and bolt it on. 
     
     any opinions/advice ?
     
     thanks in advance.
     
     john clark
