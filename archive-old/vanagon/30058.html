For what it's worth, the name sounds very similar to a company that I
got a similar insurance/warranty from when I bought a motorcycle
several years ago.  When the bike died, they found an amazing number
of ways to weasel out of paying anything.  I'd at least insist on
several references of satisfied customers (i.e., those that have had
claims paid, that are not connected to the company's payroll).
Actually, you should do that no matter who's making the offer....
