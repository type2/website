Subject: Re: pfeiffer reunion! (big sur)

Since I need a shake-down cruise to determine if my 71 Westy is up
to the &quot;Inuvik Run&quot;, and since I have been planning a West-Coast run
during the Mid-West winter, I'll throw my hat into the ring for
Jan. 5th-7th.  If weather allows us to escape Missouri the last week
of December, we will be taking a southerly route to California.  We
will plan our timing to be in the Big Sur on the appointed days.
