Subject: ?Installing A Syncro Transmission?

    Dennis and all with interest,

    AS you probably known, if you have been reading the Vanagon list,
    I have my transmission out of my Syncro, for clutch repair.

     Could you please give me some advice:

    1 - Someone has said that there is an allignment required 
        to reinstall the drive shaft. I don't see this mentioned
        in the manual. Could you comment?

    2 - The starter had silicone sealed all over it. This had to be for
        water proofing. Did VW use silicone seal between the motor and
        the transmission also?  My engine has been changed. I found 
        vaccume lines going to the top of the clutch housing and 
        transmission case. I think these are to vent moisture? (cool). 
        What about the cutout (or drain )in the bottom of the engine, 
        in the clutch area. Is this sealed in a Syncro, somehow?  
    
    3 - I have a bolt in the head, that has striped threads. It holds on 
        the exhaust head pipe, (bottom bolt, next to the water pump).
        (An other fine GEX product). I am looking for ideas for a 
        &quot;in the car fix&quot;. How about this: drill and thread deeper into 
        head? or just Epoxy like &quot;J.B. Weld&quot;. 
        
        You maybe interested in knowing that I am taking 
        about 2 weeks to do this job, mainly so I can clean, rust proof 
        and detail all areas that are not accessable with the 
        transmission in.

                   Thank for your time and advice!
