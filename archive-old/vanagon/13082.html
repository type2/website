Subject: RE: Reinforced Sidewalls and EuroVans...

Ric,

In the off-chance that you haven't already done so, check out the local 4x4 
shops.  I was able to find and appropriately sized set of BF Goodrich off road 
T/As for our Syncro (w/ reinforced sidewalls).  They also had M/S treds in the 
same size and although you have 15 inch rims, they should be able to find 
something for you...

Ok, here's the dilemma...the tires on the EV are about kaput...they
were $hit to begin with...Contis...they cracked early...they wore
funny. Unfortunately the only &quot;stock&quot; replacement tires I can seem
to get for the EV without having to mortgage the house and wait
for tires to come from Yurrup are Contis thru my VW dealer...YEEECH!

A couple of you have stock Michelin MXLs on your EVs...unfortunately
they are scarce hereabouts and $$$$$$!!! My tire dealer suggested
Michelin MV4s and another Michelin tire in the 205/65/15 size, both
4 season tires (which I like). The problem is that they don't have 
reinforced sidewalls....

So, after all this....do I NEED reinforced sidewalls on my EV??
Whatchathink? If this were the GTI, hell I'd have no problems
finding tires and would know instinctively which performance
tires to put on...but the van is a whole different animal.

HELP!!

Ric
