&gt;&gt; Type IV engines are known to eat their young.  And their valve guides. So

&gt;&gt; new guides.  And install stem seals, although the engine will get you to

&gt;  You're not joking about the valve guides. I've got two 2000cc type IVs
&gt;  and both came to me in need of a rebuild because at least half a valve
&gt;  guide had been bounced around the head. The piston crown in each case 
&gt;  looked like a relief map of the Himalaya's and in one engine the bits had 
&gt;  managed to make their way into the ajoining cylinder too. I don't know 
&gt;  why this engine seems partial to doing this, but checking them during a 
&gt;  rebuild may stop an expensive crunch later.

You know the valve guides are loose when you take the valves out and the
guides come with them.  BTDT HTBNH (Had To Buy New Heads)
