check the braided strap on the left side of the engine. and any other
brown-colored (they are ground) wires you can find, especially back to
the computer. Digijet is very sensitive to bad electrical grounding.

the only other thing i can suggest swapping is the airflow meter (can't
recall if you said you did that already). it might have a bad connection
inside somewhere.

good luck.

grounds appear good, I'll check again.  How many are there?

Airflow was swapped.

Thanks again

John
