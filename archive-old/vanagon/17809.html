Don't want this thread to get too long for fear the envy of 'other' types will rise up but 
...

I completely agree with Ric's comments and assessment(s) of the Eurovan.

In two-plus years of ownership and operation this is one of the &quot;very, very, very few&quot; 
big-ticket items I've purchased that I have not lived to regret.

I have functionally 'lived' in this Eurovan, from time to time, and have convinced my 
family and others to 'feel' the fun of including the van in what we do!

Without the Eurovan, I would have never considered taking a long tour like GNATT.

My family is even planning a future trip into Central America &quot;with&quot; the Eurovan as a 
pivotal planning factor.
