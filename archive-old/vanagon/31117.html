Subject: Weekly Statistics

To All:

Whereas, all Type II owners are known to be brave, loyal, trusting and true,
as well as intelligent, kindly and thoughtful, it seems a mite odd that the
list remains so small.  And while we are but a small and happy band, there is
strength in numbers.

I suggest that when any of us attend any gathering of Volkswagen owners that
we carry with us and display in some prominent place, a placard or sign
telling of the existance of the Vanagon list with easy instructions on how to
join, how to buy a computer, how to rebuild the 3/4 clutch hub of a late
model tranny, and other useful tidbits other Type II owners have been lusting
for.

Submitted for your consideration.

-Bob
