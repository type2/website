So Joseph F. Fournier II says:
&gt; &gt;supplement which is usually a gas heater.  The two main supplement
&gt; &gt;heaters used on air-cooled VWs were/are the Stuart-Warner and the
&gt; &gt;Espracher.  These heaters are rather expensive to maintain.  Rebuilt
&gt; &gt;ones run in the $300 - $500 range.  So keep this in mind if you live
&gt; &gt;where it gets mighty cold.
&gt; 
&gt; You might want to add that parts are getting scarce for the older 
&gt; Eberspachers and that only a few reputable heater mechanics are known to 
&gt; the list.

Thanks for the spelling correction (I knew it wasn't right, but I'm on
my VT220 terminal at home and didn't want to stop and look it up.) and
the parts scarcity is also good input.

Thanks,

Steven
