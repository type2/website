My '73 is called Bert.
When I got him, he had no name.
My girlfriend at that time (now well departed) decided on the name.
I hadn't the nerve to argue at the time (sad huh?).

It may be going soon anyway to be replaced by a split I've heard of sitting in
someones garden. Don't know what year or condition but I'm finding out next 
week.


Stuart,
