&gt;Hi all, Can anyone direct me to Dennis Haynes article on
&gt;installing a 2nd battery. I think it was in a LIMBO issue.  I also

&gt;trickle charger with his 2nd battery which seemed like the way to go.
&gt;Are you out there?

Yup.  Go to http://www.vanagon_dot_com/ and look in the 'Info' section under
'Beethoven' or 'Articles'.

&gt;Is it just the kid in me or does a bus seem like a little clubhouse?
&gt;only better cause its got WHEELS!

You are not alone.
