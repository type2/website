Thanks for the reply.  What are the &quot;airflow lots&quot;?  Also, How do I get rid of 
the airbubble?  I've bled the system with both the front AND the back raised.

Thanks,
Bryan

&gt;where it belongs the whole time, right to the left of the LED.  What's 
&gt;happening is there is NO HEAT after the gauge passes over the LED, which is 
&gt;quite often on my slow mountain ride to work every morning.  If I go to bleed 



Airbubble!!!  the heater core goes dry first, this is an early warning.
Actually the defrost goes cold first, then floor.  At higher revs the pump
cam compress the airbubble enough to lower coolant level below pump inlet,
thus no circulation and high/rapid overheat.  If you aren't getting the max
overheat, it may be something as simple as weeak antifreeze mixture.  I've
had the coolant in the heater go to slush due to windchill, and no heat
despite engine being perfectly normal.  Try shutting down the airflow lots
prior to when this usually happens and see if that helps. tim
