 &gt; I have an '87 GL Wolfs. I have not had it very long. It seems to run rough
 &gt; at low RPMs. It idles at about 800. If I try to nudge it up to 1100 or
 &gt; 1200 RPM it seems to drift and surge. 
 &gt; Is this characteristic of anything in particular?
 &gt; Thanks and aloha,

           Yes, Throttle switch bad, or out of adjustment. There is
           a updated switch you need from the dealer. I have not
           found any of the original switchs working!

Thanks Eric, you came through again.  I just finished troubleshooting a
poor/cut out at acceleration to the throttle switch.  It didn't close at
idle.  I readjusted it and still didn't work.  I removed it last night and
found the whole switch assembly is so loose that it cannot possibly meet the
.002 to .004 inch spec.  For now I adjusted it all the way to the &quot;surge&quot;
position but at least I can accelerate. The knowlegeable dealer in another
part of the state did tell me that a new one was produced later, too.  I'll
order one ($65) for next week.
