&gt; 	Well, being like I am, I will

Well, it will work, sort of.  I don't know how other people installed
their temp senders, but mine came with instructions to drill a hole
in the plate and put the sender through it, and secure it from the 
inside with a thin nut.  The problem with this is that the required
hole is large, and the area in which to drill it is small, and quite
a bit of presicion is needed in order to have room for the nut on the
inside and for the tip of the sender to have room to reside, and for the
mating surface to be flat.  I was able to do it semi-successfully, although
the sender has leaked a bit of oil almost from day one.  I suppose a 
fitting would be even better, if it could be done.  One good thing about
the way I did it compared to the VDO plate is that it would appear the
sender resides farther away from the bottom of the sump, and theoretically
should provide a more accurate reading.  I think I would rather have a
dry engine though.
