Subject: tire diameters

Here's a table of tire diameters by width and profile, for your speedo cor-
rection calculations.  Eurotire, a nice-to-deal-with tire distributor here
in NJ, used to include this info and more in their catalogs.

Diameters are in millimeters, with tire installed on narrowest rims ap-
proved for that tire size.  Wider rims would give slightly smaller dia-
meter.  Just tell Santa what you want.
