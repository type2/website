Subject: Tobin's report


So, Tobin wrote about some place they were staying in the south:

...&quot;They had a cozy little fire going, with flames leaping four
or five feet into the air.  Nobody could get within 10 feet of it.
The fire made a lot of noise, so they had to turn the stereo in the
pick-up up real loud, otherwise they wouldn't be able to hear the
Judds wailing at each other.  They were throwing their beer cans
into the fire, except when they missed, which was often.  They had
no idea where Canada was, let alone British Columbia, and they
made it pretty clear they didn't care.  They weren't mean about
it--they just already had their brains full of other stuff like
dirt bikes, Coors beer, and Patrick Buchanan......&quot;

I didn't know there was a vanagon gathering around this time.  Why
didn't anyone tell me?
