Subject: help with carb!

I have a 1600 with a Solex 34 PICT-3 (I think). Anyway the engine runs rich
as indicated by carbon on the new plugs. It misses in all gears and there is
evidence of gas leaking around and from the carb. What should I do? How hard
is a rebuild? I just fully tuned it except for new plug wires - #1 wire is 
getting burned through from the manifold. 

mucho TIA
