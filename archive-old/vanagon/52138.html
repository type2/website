Subject: Re: Good AND inexpensive tire pump, where to find?

Very good post and I think I have some answers.

At 09:05 PM 11/22/96 -0600, you wrote:
&gt;Derek mentions that lowering tire pressure for better traction.
&gt;This is indeed standard procedure for the 4 and 6 wheel drive
&gt;Scania TGB 30 and 40 heavy trucks I used to drive. It makes
&gt;a great difference!

The reason I pound on people to lower their tire pressures when stuck is
that even *I* have trouble remembering to do it, and I am the king of stuck.
I get stuck and start thinking about every possible thing except lowering
the tire pressure. But lowering the tire pressure always gets me out.

I am going to put a sign on my 4,000lb winch that I keep under my back seat
saying, &quot;Have You Tried Your Tire Pressure First?&quot;

&gt;In my own Westy, lowering the pressure is no problem ;-), but
&gt;pumping it up again (in the &quot;field&quot;, far from a service station) is!.
&gt;I've tried:

I just ordered some little jobbies that make it even easier to lower the
pressure. You dial these things onto your valve stems, dial in a pressure
between 10 and 20 psi, and then drive off. As you drive, the tires deflate
to the preset value automatically, and then stop.

&gt;Hand pump: Forget this. My arms are worn out before adding 10psi
&gt;into ONE tire.

Right. Forget this option.

&gt;12V Walmart (or insert generic department store name here) pump:
&gt;Does pump the tire, but: 
&gt;
&gt;	Taking my four &quot;small&quot; LT195-75-R14 from 20 to 45 psi takes
&gt;	40 minutes!!! (including &quot;cool down&quot; intervals for the pump
&gt;	to keep it from smooking.) 
&gt;
&gt;	After 1 year of use (only maybe 10 or so of these cycles,
&gt;	plus occational topping off) the pump performance seems to
&gt;	have degraded significantly.
&gt;
&gt;The pump I'm talking about is the &quot;250&quot; psi 12v one. It comes in
&gt;a dozen different outsides (with and without: pressure gauge, extra 
&gt;12 V outlet, various color lights etc), but with the same pump inside. 
&gt;Prices range from $9.95 to 39.95. Surprisingly I havent found any alternative
&gt;to this pump. Any 12v &quot;candidate&quot; I've examined, regardless of brand name
&gt;contains the same pump inside the varuious shape housings.
&gt;
&gt;Two alternatives that comes to mind: 1/ Buy an inverter and a 110V
&gt;pump: Price &gt;$100, way more than my student budget can devote to
&gt;this. 

Right. This is the sensible route I am taking. I have a 1500/3000 watt
inverter I bought from CUC/Shoppers advantage ($350; lifetime warranty) and
I think I'm gonna try that 110Volt Campbell Hausefeld pump in Harbor Freight
(about $100), which puts out something like 4.2CFM at 40 psi, very respectable.

&gt;2/ Buy a foot pump: Real cheap ($5-10) but do they work? Do they last?
&gt;And how long would it take me to pump the tires from 20-45 PSI?
&gt;I hate to buy potential junk that break on me when I really need it.

Bad idea.

&gt;3/ Pressure tank (3 or so gal): Too bulky to motivate its place during 
&gt;extended trips, and how many tires does it fill on one &quot;charge&quot;? Less 
&gt;than four is my guess. 

Capacity for four tires requires too big a tank. CFM is the thing you are
looking for.

&gt;Any other suggestions?

Yes, actually, for the VAST bulk of you, the answer is to buy 2 or even 4 of
the $19 12 volt jobbies at K-Mart or similar and hook them up *at the same
time.* It takes about 7 mins for my Ames Dept. Store $19 special to bring
one tire up from 15 psi to 40, so I bought a little pile of these. With
four, you can bring all four tires up in 7 mins. This is the answer folks,
goofy as it sounds. 

If you want to skimp, then just buy 2 of these. The second one adds
insurance against the first one breaking, as one of our folks pointed out
the possibility of this happening.

I am impressed with the Ames units I bought moreso than the Whitless units I
bought. Anyway, the thing is to shoot for compactness.

&gt;/Martin and '82 diesel Westy. (2WD but never stuck so far! Had a close call
&gt;in a river bed once. Now wiser)
