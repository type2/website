Subject: Carlisle Import Car Nationals this weekend...

All, I just wanted to remind everyone that the Carlisle Import/Replicar
Nationals are this weekend (fri/Sat/Sun) in Carlisle, Pa.
I think LiMBO is having optional overnight camping too. See Jim DiGenarro
about that.
Multi import/replicar show (everything from Audis to Zimmers) and a huge swap
area (mostly geared toward the VW and Brit car parts) plus car corral (cars
for sale).
There is also a raffle to win a restored car (a few years back it was a sweet
triple black '79 bug 'vert).

should be a great show if the rain holds off.....
