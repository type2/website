Subject: Oil temp sending unit location on a type 4

Howdy,
Does anybody know of a great place to mount the oil temp sending unit 
 on a Type IV? With my upright motors I would mount them in the drain 
 plate or tee off the pressure sending unit hole. I don't want to tee 
 off the pressure unit because I would need to modify the tin and I 
 don't think that it is the most accurate place. Could I drill a hole 
 in the sump(?) plate on the bottom- the one right beneath the oil 
 tube- or is there a better location.

TIA 
Clay
