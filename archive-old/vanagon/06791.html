Subject: Split case to tunnel case conversion

I checked with all my local bus gurus, and they came up with this:
Can be done. But...the front mounts are going to be a pain. One 
recommendation: tranny strap.
another recommendation: Clara (of Oly, WA.) has a `58 that she was
going to do this to. She was told by hopefully competent authority
that if you use a T3 nosecone on the tunnel case you might be
able to bolt it on correctly. But everyone was in agreement that
you're going to have most of your problems in the front mount. She
didn't go through with the procedure, as she found a good split transaxle
before she was able to.
	Another thing she warned me about...if you do plan to put a
36hp back into the bus after this, the gearing will be really funky,
and might not be low enough for hills. (chugga, chugga....) You
might be able to find someone to rebuild it, for $$$.

Eric Oster (ekoman_at_u.washington_dot_edu) could not think of anything
for this week...I own two busses, both mostly broken, one drivable.:)
