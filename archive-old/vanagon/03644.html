&gt; I have a 69 westfalia van, no pop-top.  It has about 50k on an engine

&gt; 
&gt; In about the last 3k, it has begun to backfire occasionally on 
&gt; deceleration.
&gt; 
&gt; Is this indicative of any impending problems, or should I just relax and 
&gt; enjoy scaring the occasional pedestrian??

Checked your valves lately?  I think it might be a sign of a tight
valve - can't remember.  Or it could be unburnt fuel passing through
into the exhaust (i.e. engine missing).
