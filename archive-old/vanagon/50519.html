Subject: Juddering clutch in 1982 Bus
Date: Wed, 16 Oct 1996 22:39:51 +0100

1982 Bus (Vanagon), 2.0l air-cooled, 4 speed, 125k miles:
When you bring up the clutch the whole vehicle shudders. This happens 1st
and reverse, but also in 2nd. In fact it is easier to reproduce it in 2nd.
When there are enough revs and take up is slow its OK but when you are
trying for a quick getaway in 1st or 2nd its more noticeable.

How do you diagnose whether its a bad clutch or just what happens normally
because of the engine mountings?
