Subject: Re: Clicking in Wheels - Ideas of why?

&gt;OK, so now I got another wierd thing going on with my '86 Westy.
&gt;It is a heavy clicking that seems to be comming from the wheel(s) that is 
&gt;rotational (it speeds up when I do) and then goes away when there appears 
&gt;to be enough rotational speed to keep whatever it is in place. This is 
&gt;not a heavy metal sound, but neither does it sound &quot;tinny&quot;.

I had the EXACT same thing on my '56 bus after I did the front
brakes, and new wheel bearings cleared it up.
 
I had packed the old ones liberally enough to make Rush Limbaugh cry,
but it hadn't helped.
