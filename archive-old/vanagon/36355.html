Subject:  (lack of) EV reliability

Hey all,
I can't believe the reports I'm seeing of these problems with EVs.  It's
amazing to me that a vehicle that new has all kinds of expensive
problems.  Transmissions having to be dismantled, fuel injection, all kinds
of weirdness.  It's just not right!

It seems to me that VW has really slid a LONG way down in the reliability
of their automobiles when they once were king of the hill.

I used to have a 1989 Toyota 4Runner.  My folks bought it new in 1990. 
It's been six years and 70,000 miles (many of which I drove) and we've
had to replace the thermostat because it failed open, we had to replace
the front brake pads (the rears still look like new -- cause we bought
new ones to put on and they were the same size as the ones that were
on there since the car was bought), and of course routine maintenance
like oil and spark plugs.  The Toyota has never failed to start (except one
time when I didn't tighten the battery cable down enough) and has never
missed a beat on the highway or anywhere else.  Seeing these EV
horror stories has me worried about the future reliability of the vans
when they get to 100K+ miles or so.  Especially seeing how expensive
they are to begin with.

Now I know a Toyota doesn't have the personality that a VW has, which
is why I gave it back to my folks and bought a 1978 VW bus.  But if
you're talking about reliability....

Anyway, it's not just Toyota.  My folks own a 1985 Dodge Van that has
just turned 100,000 and I can't remember any time it's been down and out
except for when the starter died at a gas station in the middle of
nowhere.  However, the van is a stickshift so we were able to
push-start it.  I can't believe it myself that an '80s American car has done
this well, but it has.  The sad part is that a mid-'80s Dodge is scoring
better in reliability than a 2 or 3 year old VW.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not blasting EVs or EV owners nor am I trying to
sell Dodges or Toyotas.  I love the VWs as much as everybody else
here, that's why I bought one.  I just think VW needs to work a little
harder on improving their vehicles in the area of reliability.  I'm sure that
victims of the dealer &quot;replace parts 'till it works or 'till the owner is broke,
whichever comes first&quot; scam will agree.

SET RANT MODE=OFF

Sorry about that, volks, I just needed to express myself :)
