Subject: Bad Gas/Rust Solution: Comments Sought

Years back, a buddy of mine bought a car which had a rusty gas tank. Kept
clogging fuel filters, carburator, and generally causing the car to run
rough. The local junkyard mechanic told him to pour in 1 gallon (yes, I
said gallon) of DENATURED Alcohol with his next fillup (or was it 1/2
fillup). Anyway, it seemed to cure the problem. (BTW, his was one of those
landyachts with gigantic fuel tank). It was not a water problem. It was a
rust problem.  I can't, for the life of me, imagine how this helped, but
it did. 

Anyone else heard of this, have comments, etc.?

BTW, I'm on DIGEST, so I won't hear your reply 'til tomorrow unless it's 
direct. 8) Joe
