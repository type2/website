Subject: Just bought a Barndoor!!!

Hi everyone,
     I just wanted to announce that I'm the proud new owner of a barndoor
bus.  Owner said it's a '50 or '51, but isn't sure.  Does anyone know where
the ID numbers are on a bus this old?  We can't seem to find them.  Also, are
their any distinct differences in features, that would help me determine the
year?  The guy I bought it from found 29133 stamped behind the front seat on
the passengers side.  Could this be the chassis number?  If not, what is it?
 I still havn't seen the bus in person, so this is all I have to go by.
                                                            Thanks,
                                                                     Eric
