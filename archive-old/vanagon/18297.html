&gt; all this talk about pop top's popping inadvertantley got me thinking..

&gt; if people want aesthetics plus more pop top security, why don't people grab
&gt; a couple extra of these hold down brackets and clips off donor 73' and
&gt; older westies in the junkyard. install them towards the outsides of the
&gt; poptop (the one that come from the factory sits in the middle of the roof)
&gt; that way you could have two or three of those designer VW clips holding
&gt; down your roof as opposed to just one? whaddy'all think?
&gt; 

I don't have a Westy pop top, but the 3/4 (starts right behind the 
driver cab) top designed by County Homes, CA, that is guided by crossbars 
on each side, and goes up straight. Everything is worn out a bit, and the 
front of the top started to vibrate and rattle on the roof at highway 
speed. My quick and dirty solution was to use two 1 inch wide straps with 
metal clamps that hook into the rain gutter and hold the front and back 
of the top down while driving. I am thinking on permanently installing 
roof racks, and might change the design and bold the racks to the top - 
anti-theft device and, when the rack is clamped onto the rain gutter, 
pop-top downholder in one....
