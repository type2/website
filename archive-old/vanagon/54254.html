Subject: VW CV Boots=Short life

About 7-8mons ago replaced CV's and boots. Wanted to replace with all VW
OEM boots but partsman only had two VW, I used two others form parts house
they looked like they were made from neoprene or oil/fuel resistant rubber.
Well the after market boots look fine, but the VW boots are cracked and
need to be replaced. Stay away from VW boots! They must be made of real
rubber.Anyway they are trash.

I need to replace the boots on the steering rack, is after market Boots
better than OEM VW? Would hate to have them rot off in less than a year.
