Subject: RE: shower in a westy!

An attachment between the luggage rack tank and the main sink
could run both ways:  hot water from the tank to the faucet,
and also, the faucet could be used to fill the solar tank,
especially from the city water hookup.  

Adventurewagons in Fort Bragg, CA, who used to do their own
bubbletop VW conversions in prior years, now works only doing
them on the Ford Club XLT wagon.  THey use such a concept,
except that one showers inside the van, in not (to me anyway) th
most convenient way.  But, they have a permanent &quot;tub&quot; up
there of sorts to hold the water, and it is possible, with
their set up to have it solar heated WHILE driving.  However,
that vehicle is considerably heavier and more powerful than
a westy, so 80 pounds on the roof would probably be less
noticeable on the Ford.  

All ideas welcome!!!!!
