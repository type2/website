Subject: 65 bus won't start
Date: Wed, 18 Oct 95 10:55:51 PDT


This morning I went to start my bus and it turned over like every
other morning. But after a few seconds it just died. Tried again to
start it and everything is churning but it won't start. So, I let it
sit for 5 minutes(thinking maybe it is flooded) and try to start it
again. Starts right up but again in a few seconds it dies. Applying
the accelerator pedal to keep it idling didn't work.

I let it sit again for a few minutes and try once more but get the
same results.  I was late for work so I didn't get a chance to check
things out thoroughly.  I'm pretty much a novice mechanic, so any
ideas on what to check or if someone has had a similiar problem,
your help would be much appreciated.

Thanks,
