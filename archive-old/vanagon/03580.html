Subject: Hi, I'm back

Hi!

I'm back from vacation.  My backlog of mail--over 5 megs!--was so huge that
the UNIX mail couldn't handle it.  I managed to extract the last 40000 lines
from the mail file and sorta looked at them....

I think most of the mail was the vanagon list.  And what happened to all the
discussion of the 1995 trip?

I'm back but my '84 Vanagon isn't!  Full details after we're reunited on
Thursday.  Stay tuned!

Meanwhile, I want to change my Vanagon subscription to Digest Form, if this
is possible.  I seem to remember seeing something about it.  How
do I do it?  Just ask Gerry?  Yoo hoo, Gerry...
