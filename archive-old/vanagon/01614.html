&gt;While we're on the subject of c.v. joints, I have a problem with my '73
&gt;that nobody I've spoken to has experienced. There is a low frequency
&gt;shake from the transmission. It's intermittent, sometimes really bad other
&gt;times hardly noticable but dissappearing on the over-run or when not in 
&gt;gear. It feels like the engine and gearbox are wobbling back and forth on 
&gt;their mounts but these look in good condition. A parts shop suggested

I don't know about the joint but have you looked at the axle shaft?  It may
be slightly bent.  I had a rabbit convertible several years ago and
it had a vibration I could not find.  Eventually I found that the right
axle shaft was bent.  It seems the previous owner(s) had it was towed one
time and it was hooked up to the shaft.  I found that it was about less then
1/8 inch bent in the middle but enough to cause a vibration at any speed.
