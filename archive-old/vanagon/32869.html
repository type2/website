Subject: re:much mail

It was suggested that this list be split into separate lists for each
type of bus.

Gerry has said in the past that if you want a list for splitties, or bay
windows, etc. that you start the list yourself. Frankly I like the list
the way it is. Even better is that Tandems mail system can sort mail
easier than the other types, and I even have the option of retrieving
messages that I deleted (within a set time frame) in a fit of house
cleaning.

Yes I do work for Tandem, but don't let that stop you

Cheers,

David
