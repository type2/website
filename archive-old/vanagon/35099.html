&gt; I'm trying to find a location which is sort of midway between S. CA, and N. CA,
&gt; and need some suggestions.  Thinking about trying to do winter camping
&gt; in the snow, but will probably need AC for heaters, etc.
&gt; 
&gt; Give me your thoughts!

Bummer, I'll be in Colorado....

My wife and I just spent a great weekend in down around Morro Bay State Park, 
and Montana De Oro State Park.  Have a great time wherever you end up.  FYI 
any interested in a impromptu run to Sunset Beach State Park (outside 
Santa Cruz) next weekend.  Weather willing we'll be headed there.
