Subject: Going from 76 westy to 81 westy

Well about to take the plunge....

Found an 81 Full camper Westy  with more Grateful Dead Stickers that I care
to mention(Might have to remove a few...but I heard it is bad luck).  

Body good--Brown paint and they painted the Roof Green(OH WELL)
paint fair
interior all good except needs carpet replaced
115,000 miles on bus
Also has Catalytic Heater(yeah---no more freezing in the mountains)


10,000 miles(1 year) on GEX engine with 3 years 36,000 miles warranty(Is
this Transferrable??)

This is a Nevada Van(almost said bus) I will need to pay the Welcome tax as
well as get it registered and Smogged--have to figure out what this will cost.

They are looking for 2900 and I figure I can get it for 2500 or less.

Any input is appreciated

Thanks  Joe
