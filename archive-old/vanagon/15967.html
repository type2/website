Subject: Synchro Tranny leak

A couple months ago, I asked if anyone knew what could be causing a leak
in my Synchro tranny where the drive shaft for the forward wheels comes 
out of the front of the tranny.

There was one suggestion that perhaps a breather tube was clogged but
Derek said this was highly unlikely due to the location of the breather 
tube.

So...  some time has passed and now maybe there is a new person on the list 
who could shed some light on this problem.  I've had the seal replaced
twice and I still have a weekly half dollar sized drop of oil on my 
garage floor.

I am worried that this may be a precursor to a more serious problem.
BTW, the trans is original and has 110K miles on it.
