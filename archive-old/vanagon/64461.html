Subject:      Eurovan Timing Belt/ Waterpump seized!

The Water pump had failed and caused the timing belt to jump off the pullies and to
eat thru the timing belt cover:(

  This leads me to belive that replacing the water pump at the same time as the timing
belt Might not be a bad idea on the Eurovan.  Other manufactures say to replace the
water pump at the same time too if the belt rides on the pump.

  My $00.02
