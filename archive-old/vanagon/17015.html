Use the wrecking yard system, I just replaced mine in my '72 for $7.
 
&gt; so, here's the question. i also bought i little switch that when you press
&gt; in on it, it completes a circuit, when you let go it breaks it.  it i run
&gt; a wire from each termianl on this to the control terminals on the dimmer
&gt; relay, will it conrtol the lights?  i do not want to merely flash the
&gt; lights.  i want it function the same way the old switch did.

Thats all you need is a momentary switch... all it does is complete the 
circuit to a relay which changes it from bright to dim or vice-versa.
