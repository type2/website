Re: EV Brakes
             Haven't had to do this yet at 28,000 miles, so can't be of
any help. Just curious about how many miles Trace has on his EV and when to
expect to need to do front brakes.
             While I'm on, I'd like to ask EV owners if they've had a problem
of stalling out when stopping quickly. It only happens when the A/C is on and
it happens rarely enough that the dealers haven't been able to find anything
because it hasn't done it when their guys have driven it around. The frequency
is erratic, but averages out to about 1 in 15 time I quick-stop. Any ideas??
             I haven't had the piston slap problem, just the high speed fan
relay going and causing the A/C system to blow.
             Also my Conti's have about 4-5,000 safe miles left on them. Any
suggestions for new tires? I've been Goodyear Invictas, Conquests,Michelins
and Firestones in this size, but I haven't had good experience with Goodyears,
avoid Firestones, and think Michelin has declined in the past decade.
             VW IS making a revamped EV line for '95 according to Autosite_dot_com.
They will come w/dual airbags and feature a second sliding door on the driver's
rear. Later in the year they will also introduce a 6-cylinder engine for the
EV. THey sell a diesel in Canada but not apparently in the US.

All for now,


Hal Roth
