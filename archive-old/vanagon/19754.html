Subject: RE: Philly Area VW Stuff?

&gt;Let me know  if for sure you'll be n the Philly area and  where &amp; when
(days/time).
&gt;
&gt;I've been holdding off from a trip to that area to make a delivery; may
consider driving 
&gt;up there and meeting with yoyu as well!

I could swing by that way too, if you'd like some VW company.
I might be able to get my '85 Weekender friend (Kevin) to come by as well.

Don't know of any VW model vendors/retailers in Philly, but that doesn't
mean there aren't any. There is a hobbyist model shop near Kevin's house;
they may know of VW model sources.

Dave &quot;still haven't met anyone from the list or burned any magnesium&quot; Mancuso
