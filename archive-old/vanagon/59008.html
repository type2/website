Could possibly be a linkage problem where you really are selecting THIRD
gear instead of first. This happened to me on my 69 camper (were they
made by WESTFALIA back then?). That linkage was more likely to have this
problem due to the  type of coupling it used though.
Good Luck

&gt;Has anyone experienced the following problem on their GL?
&gt;
, we could not take off in first. (reverse would not
&gt;work either) The Van would buck severely (it felt like the engine was 
&gt;going
&gt;to fall out ) as if you were trying to start off in 4th gear.
