Subject: Trakkar Eurovans

     Has anyone ever seen one of these in person?  I came across them on 
     the Web and requested their info.  They are really neat looking.  
     Their stove in the Eurovan swings out so that you can cook outside! 
     They even offer one with all of the camping equipment located UNDER 
     the rear bench on ball bearings that allow it to slide out for outdoor 
     camping.  But one of the really great features is that they offer 
     solar cell panels for the roof to run your appliances in the middle of 
     know where.
     
     Does anyone have any experience with them?  They say they have been 
     converting vehicles into campers since 1973.  Why can't they be 
     imported into the U.S.  I'm first in line if they ever do.
     
     Scott
