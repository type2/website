&gt; Hey....
&gt; 
&gt; I've got that same problem.....does it have to do with the valve that
&gt; controls coolant flow to the heat exchanger not closing all the way?  Is
&gt; it hard to replace the valve if that is the problem?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Now that summer's finally arrived, this problem is more noticeable.  Even
&gt; &gt;with
&gt; &gt;the heater contols all the way on cool (blue), warm/hot air comes in.  Is
&gt; &gt;this
&gt; &gt;relatively easy to fix?  Will I need to do major dissassembly of the heater
&gt; &gt;unit?  Again, any tips or hints are wlecome.  Thanks.
&gt; &gt;
 
I just had a problem like this on my 86. If the control knobs feel kind
of goofy (they won't glide smooth and may stick in some spots or won't
go to the end of the slot in the dash) it is probably the control cable.
It is very short (I think about 18&quot;). I had mine replaced by a shop so I
don't know how it was done.
