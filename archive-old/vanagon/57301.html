I finally did it. 

I had been reading the digest for several weeks, getting more and more
interested in getting a camper again when I read the e-mail about an 89
Syncro Westfalia listed on E-pages down in SoCal. (Thanks for that posting.)

As a result I am now $5,700 poorer but the proud (and very happy) owner of a
Nautilus Red 89 Syncro Westfalia. It has 120K mi, new front CVJ's, new M/C,
brakes and rotors. The PO is a very nice School Principal, who took excellent
care of the van, never exceeding speed limits, having all service / repairs
done at the dealer. 
I just drove it back to the SF Bay area: no loss of coolant or oil. No drips
noticed either. 
This van cost me more than twice what I paid for my last vehicle, which was
until then the most I'd ever paid for a  car. I wish it had just taken my
life savings but it actually took that and I then had to sell my soul to the
credit card co. for a cash advance. Fortunately you get good wear on a soul
at 5.9% apr.  

I will soon be seeking advice on several points, but I will first try to sort
them out myself, after &quot;Eddies German Auto Repair&quot; gives it the once over.

Even though you probably weren't aware of it, thanks for your advice and
support.

JoE
