Subject: Re: Safaris?

&gt;Justr scanning through the list, and I realized that I don't know what safari 
&gt;windows are...I thought they were those oval things on the sides of the 
&gt;roof(usually matched with a ragtop)...I guess they are actually those slatted 
&gt;roll operable side windows?  If so, then what the bleedin' 'ell are them oval 

Safaris are framed front windsheilds that open up.

The windows in the roof are called skylights, or opera windows, or just roof
windows...

Despite the problems I've had with this setof windows, they are still
undeniably cool and fun to drive around with open...Even in the rain!
