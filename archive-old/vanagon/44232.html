Direct reply &quot;bounced&quot; with illegal address:

Mike - don't know the circumstances of the tow or diagnostics, but your bill
for an O2 sensor and regulator sounds kinda high - how well do you know this
mechanic?

An O2 sensor for my BMW ( not from dealer) runs around $35, and simply
unscrews/screws into the exhaust pipe near the manifold.  A single wire with a
connector plugs it in.  I bought an adjustable voltage regulator for my Bosch
alternator on the same car and it was also around $30 from a
starter/alternator rebuild shop.  It comes out with two small screws, also
takes about 5 minutes.

Front Disk Brakes - Pads for $40 is a bit high (surprise!  maybe $20 from a
parts store?).  If your rotors : 
 a)  are not warped, (do they &quot;pulse&quot; or vibrate  when applied?)
b) are not scored,
 c) are not worn (min thickness for my '82 is 11.8X mm  if I remember - If you
can't get a 12 mm open end wrench over the edge of the rotor it is ok)
then it generally is acceptable to do the following (yourself, takes about 20
minutes per wheel)  Consult your local experts, YMMV.  


1)set hand brake, in gear, block rear wheels
2) remover wheel covers, break wheel lugs loose
3) jack up front wheel, put stand under car and remove wheel
4)  remove 2 retaining pins and clip that holds pads in caliper and remove old
pads (they just pull straight out)
5) put one pad back, and using a screw driver between the pad and rotor,
gently push the caliper piston back into the caliper body, be careful not to
scratch or score the rotor.
6)  apply anti-squeal material, spray, pad etc. to back of new pads(surface
that faces Caliper NOT rotor)  and insert pads
7) reinstall retaining clip and pins,  and wheel, and wheel lugs,  remove
stand
8) lower vehicle, torque lug nuts, replace wheel cover, and repeat process  on
other wheel.

One piece of advice (came with doing drum brakes which are mechanically more
complex, but the advice is still good for disk brakes) :  Only take apart one
wheel at a time.  that way you have the other side of the axel as a reference
to see how to put things back together if you get confused or forget!!!

Actually $340 for front brakes including new rotors is cheap compared to what
the O2 sensor and regulator cost you, but you should be able to do the brakes
for a lot less yourself (maybe $50 max?).

Suggest you invest in a Bentley manual.

Regards
Harvey

PS - the rear drum brakes are a bit harder because of the emergency/parking
brake mechanism and special tools to get the springs on and off.  I HATE drum
brakes!!!!
