Tim,

First, I was running the van at about 2000.  Is that too low?  I ran it 
for over 15 minutes after having driven it till it was thoroughly warm.  
The fluid was well up the coolant reservoir so I assume there was plenty 
there.

Second, I don't have a bleed valve on my radiator - just a plain old cap 
screw in the top.  For me to put a hose on (like on a brake 
bleeder) I'd have to totally replace the cap screw.  That is certainly 
tempting if I could find the right valve.
