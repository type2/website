Well, hell.  I don't know about anybody else, but I'm
feeling left out, what with West Coast gatherings and
East Coast gatherings and all.

Maybe in the spring (Nov.-March being out for most of
us in the Heartland) the rest of us might want to give
a gathering a whirl?  Yes anybody?  Wisconsin, Minnesota,
So. Dakota, and, yes, even parts of Iowa have some very
pretty state parks.  In my part of the world y'all could
even go see the real bridges of Madison County!

Thoughts?
