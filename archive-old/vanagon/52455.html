Subject: Re: Golf Syncro ? ? ?

&gt; Driving around town today I came across an A2 bodied VW Golf Syncro - jacked
&gt; up ~ 6&quot; higher than normal, with  serious 'roo/brush bar assemblys front &amp;
&gt; rear, outside rear mounted spare, lotsa extra *big* lights front &amp; rear -
&gt; looked like it was all ready for Paris-Dakar !  Anybody have any info ? ?
&gt; (&amp; yes I know,where's the Vanagon thread; well, the word Syncro &amp; maybe the
&gt; fact that it's water-cooled ? ? ).
&gt; 
What you saw was a Rallye Golf, which VW motorsport ran in the Pikes
Peak a few years back (and the Paris-Dakar). It was a  Europe only
model, which came with different floorpan and (usually) a 2.0 16v
engine with supercharger. You may have seen one of VWs test cars,
as I doubt many others have made it across the ocean. Ron's Parts
built one in Vancouver which was covered in European Car, but
theirs was lowered &amp; had a VR6 in it. 
When it was selling, price was about twice that of standard Golf I 
think.
