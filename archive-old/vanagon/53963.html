Subject: Submersible Water Pump

Bob in Orlando was looking for a replacement water pump for his
Westy...If you want a place that carries LOTS of pumps of ALL kinds, you
might try the W.W. Grainger Company.  They even have their catalog on
line, along with a search engine.  Find them at http://www.grainger_dot_com  
I've seen 12v submersible pumps in that catalog.  Try looking for &quot;RV 
pumps&quot;.

I've not tried ordering anything from them, yet, so can offer no comments 
about their service, etc.
