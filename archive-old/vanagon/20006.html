Subject: Re: system malfunction...apology

Robb, 
thanks for the apology, but the listserv is smart and saw those messages 
and said, &quot;Hey -- I've seen these message before and I WON'T distribute 
them&quot;.  So, NONE of them got reposted.  Hurray for listserv!

&gt; So, all the old messages here, including those to the listserv, were
&gt; resent. My apologies to all for the wasted bandwidth.
