&gt; The products of perfect combustion are Carbon Dioxide and Water. Carbon 
  Monoxide is a result of incomplete combustion. All of these reactions 
  consume Oxygen and should not be used in an enclosed spacee without _ample_
  ventilation. Even with a vented heater some condensation will take place 
  since the warmer air can hold a higher partial pressure of water vapor than
  cooler air. When the warm air comes in contact with a cold window or pop-top
  some of the water vapor will condense to form a liquid. If your combustion
  exhaust is mixing with the air you can be sure that there will be a high
  level of vapor present  due to the combustion process. With propane, which
  I believe burns quite &quot;clean&quot; if the equipment is in good condition, I would
  guess that you major danger is from asphyxiation rather that Carbon Monoxide
  poisining. Perhaps someone else can comment on alcohol burners - I don't 
  know how clean alcohol burns.

&gt; Does anyone know much about alcohol burners?  Do they
&gt; produce as much condensation/moisture as propane?  What
&gt; about their consumption of oxygen?  Do they produce
&gt; as a byproduct of their combustion CO, the way that propane
&gt; does?  Therefore recommended to be ducted/vented?  Pros?  Cons?  
&gt; 
&gt; thanks....
