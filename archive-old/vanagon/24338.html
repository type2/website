     We will be having a &quot;VW Day&quot; Sunday, October 1st, at Raceway Park in
Englishtown, NJ. I write for their paper, &quot;The Raceway News&quot;. It's too
bad you don't live any closer, it's usually a good event. We have VW
drags, a car show and swap meet. If you know any VW people in the NY, NJ
and PA area, please let them know. Thanks!
Bill Schaible
