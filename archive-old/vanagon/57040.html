&gt; long-discontinued Vanagon.  I think VW never really understood the market
&gt; or marketing in the US -- the vehicles more often sold in spite of their
&gt; marketing than because of it.

I couldn't agree more.

&gt; the new VW's are not an option, as she refuses to consider automatics.
&gt; 

Evidently she has not had the thrill of replacing a clutch.
Do it three or four times, you'll change your mind.
