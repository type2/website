Subject: My maiden voyage!

Greetings,

At 3:00 PM PDT, my new 87 Syncro Westie and I will embark on our first
road trip together!  The destination, you ask?  No other place would be
fitting except Yosemite.  A weekend of awesome climbing in a gorgeous
setting...it doesnt get much better!  Wooo woooo!  East Buttress of
Middle Cathedral, here we come!

peace

jg
