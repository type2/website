Subject: Looking for Gas Heater Parts

I am on the verge of installing a gas heater in my 82 Vanagon and am on the
lookout for two parts:

a) the junction box that fits to the gas heater and takes incoming air from
both the stock heater boxes and the interior of the van. According to the
Bentley manual this junction box replaces the stock one and allows air to be
recirculated for faster warm ups;

b) the squirrel cage fan that sits alongside the junction box. This is a 12
volt fan that supplements the fan residing in the engine compartment
attached to the alternator. 

If you have these items for sale or know of a place where I can locate them,
please let me know.

Thanks - David C.
