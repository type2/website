Subject: (f) Is There a Honda List similiar to Vanagon?

Honda owners???  Aren't they the people who are
&quot;so busy they buy a Honda so they do not have to worry about their car?&quot; ????
Why would they even be interested in a mailing list :-)
Just kidding.....

&gt;A friend of mine wants to know if a Honda list similiar to this one exists.
&gt;Does anyone know of one and its address?
