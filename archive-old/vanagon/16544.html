well stated jim!

it is important that we keep things in perspective that the vans are meant
to be ENJOYED while being PERSERVED! I for one would rather see vans being
owned by enthusiasts (vanagon.lenti people :) than faceless corperations
with monetary profit being their bottom line! it is the people's car
afterall! ditto moi for avoiding vw politics ,(right up there with office
politics)!!!!!!!!

&gt; Look at the tool kits, roof racks and tents for examples.
&gt;Supply and demand. I agree that I'm sad that the market has gotten so goofed
&gt;up. I concentrate on keeping a balance on real responsibilities (spiritual,
&gt;family, job) and (generally) back away from vw politics and enjoy driving my
&gt;vw.
