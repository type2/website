                   Making an Exhaust System

A big-bore stroker is wider than a stock engine by twice the
thickness of the spacers used under the jugs, needed to
accommodate the longer rods which themselves are needed to
maintain the angle of the downward load imposed by the longer 
throw of the  stroker crank.  In the case of my 2180, the engine
is .80&quot; wider than stock.

You can't use a stock muffler with a wider engine, nor would you
want to.  But neither can you use most extractor systems since
they're sold already welded to the dimensions of a stock engine. 
You can buy a kit of parts and roll your own but it ain't cheap
and it ain't fast.  I recently needed a cheap, quick extractor
for a bored, stroked engine.

For more than a year J. C. Whitney has been offering an
inexpensive extractor that will fit any engine width and has the
tail pipe positioned low enough to clear the bumper on a bus. 
The stock number is 21-xx-3034-A, where 'xx' is the catalog code. 
The extractor costs between $45 and $70, depending on which JCW
catalog you're using, when you order, if you qualify for a 10%
discount, and if they'll ship it free.  There's a lot of luck
attached to any order placed with J. C. Whitney.   

Construction-wise, the extractor is a piece of crap.  The welding
is poorly done, the flanges are not parallel and the tubing isn't
very round.  The first time you fire it up you'll blow fiberglas
all over the neighborhood because the shoddy 12&quot; muffler has no
internal baffle.  Made in Red China.

Shoddy goods but you can make the thing work.  On the up-side,
the thing isn't very expensive and will fit just about any veedub
Ghia or bus up to '71, the -009 of mufflers.  On the down-side,
there's no way in hell to install a heater-pipe plenum chamber on
the left side.  There's enough room to jury-rig something
on the right side, which is okay for early buses since the right
heat exchanger feeds the cockpit, but the #4 exhaust stack on the
extractor comes out of the flange at a weird angle and makes it
impossible to get the heater ducting through the hole in the tin-
ware.  Good luck coming up with a fix.  Just remember frostbite
is better than asphyxiation.

                      Doing it Right

To make a proper job of it, when you order the extractor also
order four 1-1/2&quot; 2-hole exhaust flanges.  They cost about a buck
and a half each.  JCW p/n is 24-xx-0881-N.  Then go down to your
local hardware store and pick up some stainless steel nuts &amp;
bolts.  Five-sixteenths is about the right size, inch and a
quarter about the right length.  Get some stainless steel
washers, too.

The object is to come up with an exhaust system that does not
depend on clamps to maintain a seal nor provide structural
support.  So we throw away the stock veedub muffler clamp kit and
replace it with welded flanges.  

Your heater boxes are not 1-1/2&quot; diameter and the flanges will
just sort of sit there but three or five nails of the proper size
will center the flange on the pipe and hold it for tack welding. 
The El Cheepo extractor isn't inch and a half either so use the
same trick.  You'll have to cut the flare off the extractor's
heater-box connections in order to slide on the flanges but you
can leave the swage -- it will provide additional strength.

Bolt the flanges together in pairs using the stainless steel
hardware.  Position them so the parting line falls at the end of
the extractor's tubing, the swage of which slides over the heater
box tubing.  Insure you've got a gasket between the flanges and
don't torque them down just yet.  Inch and a half ID two-hole
exhaust gaskets are standard items at a real parts store whereas
the typical franchised FLAPS-guy will simply look at you.   Or,
if you can't find gaskets, make some using high-temperature
gasket material.  Fel-pro makes some good stuff, sorta like
ceramic paper that hardens when heated.  Makes a nice exhaust
gasket.

Get the entire intake and exhaust system assembled before doing
any welding.  In effect, you're using your engine as a welding
jig.  The only way things are going to come out straight is to
insure you've got all the kinks out before you weld-on the
flanges.  You'll also need to run a bead around the extractor's
tubing where it slides together.

The proper way to assembly your intake and exhaust system is to
get all the nuts on loosely and then tighten things down in a
logical sequence, starting with the heat exchangers, then the
carb. heat pipe and finally the extractor flanges.  (Indeed, the
secret to quickly installing a stock muffler is to loosen the
heater boxes.)

When everything is aligned -- and don't be surprised if you have
to persuade things with a rubber mallet -- tack-weld the flanges
in place, tack-weld the tubing, and after a final alignment
check, run smooth, gas-tight beads between the flanges and the
tubing.

The results will surprise you.  When the flanges are torqued down
on the gaskets, the system will be completely leak-free and
extremely strong.  Unfortunately, it won't be very quiet.  The
12&quot; glass-packed bullet-style muffler unpacks its glass the first
time you put your foot down, leaving you with a 12&quot; expansion
chamber that does nothing to quiet the exhaust.

                       Making it Quiet

It doesn't take a rocket scientist to see that if you can weld
flanges between the extractor and your heat exchangers, you can
do the same between the extractor and that silly little muffler. 
You'll need a bigger flange of course.  What you'll be doing is
sawing the thing in two just aft of where the four tubes merge
into the muffler, which is about three inches in diameter. 
Flanges with a 3&quot; ID are also stock items, as are high quality,
American made glass-paks that really do a nice job of quieting
the exhaust without squeezing the life out of the engine.

                       Living With Flanges

Once you've welded flanges to your heat exchangers it means
you've got to stick with flanged exhaust systems.  This isn't a
problem if you're forced to use an extractor since the flanges
are better than muffler clamps.  Flanges never leak while cheap
extractors invented the word.  But flanges work equally well with
a stock muffler, replacing those ridiculous muffler clamps and
ring gaskets with a leak-free joint that's as strong as the pipe
it's welded to.

                        Sermonette

You can't buy a well-made extractor for a big bore engine for
under two hundred dollars, and while the Chinese product
discussed in this article is an amazingly bad piece of
workmanship, it can be made to provide years of leak-free service
if you are willing to apply a little Yankee ingenuity to the
problem.
