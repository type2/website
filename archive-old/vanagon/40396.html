Subject: Air Deflectors

All,

Has anyone put an air deflector above the rear window of their bus/vanagon/ev?
Like the ones Blazers, and Explorers have that deflect the airflow down
the rear window to keep it clean.  It was raining here on Monday, and today
when driving to school I noticed how dirty the rear window was, after I had
cleaned it off a few days before.  I guess one would have to be taken from
a vehicle with one, and the mount modified to fit on the bus, but I wonder
how well something like this would work.  It could also potentially eliminate
the low pressure area immediately behind the van, and who knows, help with
cooling.


Just some random thoughts.

Lets hear what you all think
