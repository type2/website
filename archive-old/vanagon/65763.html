Brandon:

This summer I got an engine from FGA when our schedule didn't leave me time to
do a full rebuild on my own. It was built &quot;to order&quot; and arrived quickly. The
new &quot;German&quot; heads they said they use are Spanish AMC (the only heads in
production), but I expected that. I also ordered a clutch kit, and the block
came with a resurfaced flywheel and clutch installed. They include the rest of
the standard gasket kit to use for installation - but depending on year you
may also need a new seal for the oil cooler ('86^), and will need gaskets for
the end of the exhaust headers that join downstream.

You will also need to pull the v-belt pulley off your old engine and move it
over. This is the hard part, as it is torqued to 258 lb-ft. VW uses a special
tool to hold the pulley, which is a better idea than using a flywheel lock. I
made a &quot;pin-spanner&quot; from 1x2 steel tubing to hold the pulley while removing
or tightening the bolt. FGA may be able to provide one on your new block (for
a fee) to make this easier.

After filling with oil, be sure to crank by hand with the oil filter off to
prime the pump until oil comes out the filter inlet. Then pre-fill and install
the filter and crank another 50 turns before cranking with the starter &quot;no
ignition&quot; until you get oil pressure. Then start and run at 1500 rpm for 20
minutes (while you purge the cooling system anyway).

My engine runs fine - but after 3000 miles is still using a qt. of oil in
about 800 miles, even with careful startup and breakin. So I can't give a full
endorsement. Now that I have time I'm in process of a full rebuild on the
original engine and plan to swap out again and investigate the internals of
the FGA to see why it's an oil hog.

I'm new to the Vanagon scene having just purchased a 85 westy that has a
great body/interior but it does need an engine. The question I have is,
has anyone used the rebuilt engines from Fast German Auto in Santa Ana
CA? Or has anyone heard anything bad about them. They are one of the
only one advertised i Hot VW mag. I would also like to know the
difference between the 85's and 90's other than cosmetics.
