Subject: Re: Best VW Meet Awards (BEST COVERUP) 

My Dad's van, a '66 Hippie Kombi, is please to hold the 1995 Apple Valley VW
Show award
for Best Coverup.  As the the award goes..... It goes to the best car that
uses a unique
method to hid road rash, age, pot marks, winkles, zits and other blemishes
that have happened along to a old VW.  Our van has a few cresed panels, few
dents in the rear corners,  A botched up nose pull where all the drill holes
are still there but body isn't 
every thing.  It's painted blue base (krylon, we like the best driveway job
ya know), with oil based flowers, and grass all around.  Full lenght rack
with full lenght (longer then bus) sail board.  Bumpers are filled with
stuffed animals all around.  Anyways we were proud of our award.  
Check out Loaf on www.wolfenet_dot_com/~hoomon



The prevouis year a yellow Ghia coupe (nice car) received the award but
there coverup was a front bra to hide the recent nose damage.  Anyway got a
better one then this?

This show is the best you all should show up.  Yakima Wa, second weekend in
Sept.  I'll be there.  All the awards are hand made and it's a family show.
No Binki's, any VW can show and win.  Not like the shows in the mags where
every car gets polished twice a week.




&gt;
&gt;What are the best/funniest/most bizarre VW meet awards people have 
&gt;seem/heard about/fantisized about?  You know, every meet seems to have 
&gt;awards for stuff like 
&gt;
&gt;&quot;Longest distance driven&quot;
&gt;&quot;Best restoration&quot;
&gt;&quot;Interior remodelling most likely done under influence of really weird drugs&quot;
&gt;&quot;Most times dropping engine during meet&quot;
Hey at the show where Loaf got this award we almost did this to replace the
rear tranny seal, but we just topped off the gear oil and limped 200 milies
home.
