List Manager and VANAGON Members:

If this is considered instrusive, I apologize, but I believe
this is in the best interest of VANAGON and the free
spririts who inhabit the list.  We have already shown an
ability to police (if I may use the term) ourselves.  Would
you prefer the *gummint* prosecute us for discussing T&amp;A in
VW magazines?
