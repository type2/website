Subject: Atlanta Vanagon Mechanics???

I have an '85 Vanagon GL, it seems to run OK but it is running really rich.
I can't get the thing to time at spec so I have the timing advanced quite a
bit.  When the mark lines up with the seam on the engine case it refuses to
idle fast enough to run.  I had the Import Service Center in Little Five
Points look at it yesterday and they seem to think that my O2 sensor is
faulty (I replaced it when I did a tune up on the  van 8 months ago) and
they also detected rattling from my catalytic converter.  They seemed unsure
about telling me any of this, which leads me to believe that they are
probably fine to do things like clutch repairs, brakes and replacing my
starter, but the finer points of Vanagon ignition and fuel injection
probably elude them.

ISC's suggestion was to take it to a VW dealer and have them do an analysis
of it, then bring it back to them to do the work.  I don't like this
suggestion particularly and would prefer to find someone locally who could
do the complete job and sell me a converter for something less than the $750
I hear VW wants for one.  I'd like to save my money for a new engine from
GEX someday.

Any suggestions on someone in the Atlanta area who really &quot;likes&quot; working on
Vanagons.  I found a guy in Seattle but it's a bit far. :-)
