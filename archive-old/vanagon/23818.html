&gt; level when camping, without too much fuss and jigs.

I've seen people install little bubble levels inside their vehicles so 
they can see how close to level they are fore and aft, and right to 
left.  We just level by 'feel' from the driver's seat, and checked by 
eye-balling from outside.  We tend not to notice if we're a few degrees 
off one way or the other.

For the mechanics of leveling, we carry wood with us for this purpose.  I 
have a favorite piece I've had strapped in the westy storage area on the 
roof above the driver's head for most of the summer.  Because I've found 
that a workable leveling can be usually achieved by raising only one 
wheel (the lowest corner), my one big chunk of wood does it all.

This plank, BTW, was salvaged from a washed-out wooden bridge on a 
mainline logging road.  Huge off-highway trucks run this line, and my 
plank was used for part of the bridge deck, so it's a good-sized hunka 
wood: probably 2 1/2 feet long, 18&quot; wide, and 4 or 5 inches thick.  

It should be strong enough to hold the bus, I figure.

I'll put a fair-sized rock under one end, forming a ramp for me to drive 
up on.  I drive up the ramp until we're close to level, stand on the 
brakes, and Christa runs around and shoves large rocks to block the 3 
wheels still on the ground.  Christa and I can level our bus really 
quickly this way: probably no more than 3 minutes from arrival to 
cracking a beer with the top popped.

With our plank (and a few more rocks to drive on if it's really rough), 
we can get reasonably level anywhere we can drive without plowing our 
front bumper too badly or tearing our tailpipe off.

Camp on!
