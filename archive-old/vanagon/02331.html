Subject: Re: More trip talk

Hi all,

I'm just catching up to reading all of these messages after about a week
of being busy doing work (yes, actual work!).  I'm kinda wondering if 
a wannabusser such as myself would be welcome on this trip.  I'd promise
to drive my 80 Scirocco so as not to pollute the blood with a non-VW.
I do camp (in tents) and would be able to go anywhere you all decide to
camp.  So, whadya all think, would I be allowed to come or not (I promise
to be good and act properly reverential to all of your wonderful 
busses!)  

Please, please, please Unca Joe!!!! (and others)

Dave
