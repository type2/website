Rusty,

I don't remember your description of the early stages of the &quot;Resto&quot;
(happened too long ago)--Is that before picture really what you started
with?  It looks like the bus is welded to the chassis of an old truck??
Just curious if this is a joke picture or the real &quot;before&quot; scenario.  If
it's real, my hat is off, I'm at full salute, and I may or may not have
monkies flying outa my butt.
