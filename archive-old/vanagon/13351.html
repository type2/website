Subject:  Help on '57 Bus Purchase!

Hello Friends.

Out of the blue, a '57 23-window has become available, and I don't know if I
should buy it or not.  Here's the scoop:

'57 23-window.  No major rust, has all the chrome, good canvas sunroof, the
original interior, the jail bars, even the original glass tail-lights, etc.
No engine.  It is in superb shape.  The guy wants $3500 for it.  

It needs a new paint job, and brake work. (And an engine.)  I do have my
tricked out 1776cc for it though.

I have to go look at it and make a deposit by 2:00 MST or else another guy is
going to get it.

If anyone has _any_ suggestions, mail me now!  I really appreciate it!

Is this price in line with the rest of the country (excluding CA, of
course!)?

Thanks,

- Mike
