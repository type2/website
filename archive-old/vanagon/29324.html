Drew,

This is not VW experience, but rather old US auto experience.

Yes, the complaint about bonded linings was that they might squeak.  Some 
cars wrap the brake drum with a spring similar to that used to close a 
screen door.  This stops the drum from ringing which is the real cause of 
the squeak.  Perhaps you might try that.

Mike
