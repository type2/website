Subject:      Auxillary Battery


Could anybody give me directions OR point out how to find info in the
FAQ on Installing a 2nd/auxillary battery. Any personal experience
would also be helpful.

Also, has anybody out there ever lived in their cars for a couple of
months or more? I'm thinking of doing it to save money. I have access
to a shower and bathroom etc. but I would be interested to find out
the best way to keep warm in the winter as well as many other things
that I'm sure would happen in my living experience.

Any tips or information would be welcome.  Please mail me directly!
