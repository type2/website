&gt; A while ago, we had some discussion of how to lower your insurance rates
&gt; by declaring your camper a mobile home.  But we didn't really get into
&gt; what companies had good rates, etc.  Well, its time for me to renew my
&gt; policy and I'm going to check around here for better rates, but I
&gt; thought I might check with the list at the same time to see what others
&gt; are paying.  Of course, I understand that rates will vary by locality &amp;
&gt; state, so this info might be anecdotal, but you never know, we might
&gt; find a company out there making good deals...
&gt; 
&gt; By the way, my camper is my daily driver and my ONLY vehicle.  Here's
&gt; the skinny on my ride:  I've got a 90 Vanagon Camper with 92k (all the
&gt; extras), am 31, good driving record, $100 &amp; $250 deductibles, the van is
&gt; not used for work, and I pay $495 per year thru Liberty Mutual.
&gt; 
&gt; can anyone beat that?

Ian,

Interesting.  Here in Philly I pay (hope your sitting down) $750 a year
for the absolute minimum insurance as mandated by the state.  Believe it
or not this is only liability, no collision, no uninsured drivers and
limited tort which means I can't really sue for much of anything.

I have the opposite question, Does anybody pay more?
