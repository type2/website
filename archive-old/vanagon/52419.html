I agree, in Germany you have to use seat belts or you will be charged by
a high penalty. Air bags are optional features on cars and do not preserve
you from this penalty. Not every car comes with air bags but without it
cars are poorly to sale. If you have to order air bags as an option (and
everybody does) it will cost DM 400.- (only driver) to DM 1,200.- (both
sides). Most cars have air bags as standard.

&gt;Instead, we have to spend an additional $1,500 per car for something that
&gt;was not propely thought out,

Agreed, but only in that way that air bags comes out without an accident
or not coming out during an accident. Or often the electronics shows
failures like inoperable systems.

&gt;obviously is deadly to kids (as well as those
&gt;adults of below-average height),

I do not agree: Air bags are most dangerous to kids sitting in back faced
baby cases. When the bag comes out this cases are kicked to the back and
will hit the headrest. Adults of below-average high, not wearing a seat 
belts,
could be pushed below the bag. But wearing a seat belt, they have neck
musculature resisting the fall into the bag. I guess older kid would do
same but I will read the air bag articles again.

&gt;and is only in our cars because most
&gt;drivers are stupid enough NOT to wear seat belts. All in the name of
&gt;&quot;personal choice&quot;...bullshit...

Do you have details about this incident last night?
