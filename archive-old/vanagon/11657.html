Subject: Re: '71 Bus rear brake backing plate


&gt;The cable is frozen in the tube that runs from the bottom of
&gt;the bus to the brake backing plate. The tube is welded to the plate,
&gt;and the VW dealer cant order a new plate because it is an obsolete
&gt;part. What do I do now? How hard is it to pull a new E-brake cable?
&gt;Do you think that would work, with some lube in the rusty guide?

Yes! Yes! Yes!  JUST DO IT!!!  Work, work...
