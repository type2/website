Subject: early bus compartment under seat????

that should say enough.  does anyone know what this compartment was 
originally for.  both of my 1960 bus's have them as well as every bus i 
have ever seen.  it looks like there could be a cover for it, but i have 
never seen one.  walk through's even have a smaller version.   any ideas 
as to it's origin?
thanks and God BLess
matt
