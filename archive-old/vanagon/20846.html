Subject: [A] FI problem, [Q] where to get a starter

Hello-

First off, thanks to everyone who advised me on my van's fuel injection 
problem.  I now have the answer, in case any one is curious.  As you may 
recall, the van periodically would not start, and was apparently flooding.
It turned out to be a faulty temperature sensor, the one that attaches to 
the left cylinder head.  It was overactive, and was causing the cold 
start valve to flood the intake.  Also, the plugs had to be changed, 
because all of the buring of too-rich fuel.

Second, it seems that our starter is approaching the end of its life.
Well, at least according to my girlfriend, who has the van out west.
I was planning on getting a new starter ahead of time.  Where is the best 
place to get one?  J C Whitney?  A rebuilt one?  Autoworks-type parts stores?
A genuine Bosch?  Bus Boys?

Thanks-
Jesse
