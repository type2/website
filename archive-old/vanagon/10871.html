Subject: Vanagon heater controls - tip


Minor &quot;tip-o-the-day&quot;...

After spending hours trying to adjust the lever that directs air either to
feet or windscreen so that it would stay &quot;full defrost&quot;, I gave up and
attached a coil spring to the offending arm, the other end to the rear
mount of the radio. The spring gives the lever enough assist to keep it
where I slide it.
