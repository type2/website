Subject: Wiper problem...still

        I posted a mesaage a week or two ago regarding how I couldnt get my
wipers to spray properly, and have tried the few suggestions I recieved, but
to no avail.
        I tried using compressed air on each spray nozzle simultaneously to
clear the hose lines of the gunk Im 90% sure is in there blocking the fluid
from spraying properly. I did get some improvement on the passenger side,
but the drivers side is even more pathetic now.
        Im pretty sure that the pump itself is fine, as I dropped the
container and had a freind press the sprayer while I looked at what was
happening. You could see that the pump was trying to send the fluid up fine
but...it somehow doesnt make it to the other end that well.
        The hose itself is old, dry, and very very discolored, but looks
like its still intact...no cracks or holes, as I tried to follow the line
down with my hand and it was dry as a bone.
        So Im considering replacing the whole hose that runs from the nozzle
down into the resevoir. The crappy part about it is that I havent a clue how
Im gonna get in there and do it. Has Anyone else had to do this, or have any
suggestions on how to go about it?
        I have a feeling my eyes wont come in to handy on this little
adventure. It'll be a Helen Keller feely touchy experience.

ciao.
Mike
