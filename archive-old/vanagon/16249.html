Subject: Re: '77 transporter fan problem

Well, upon reading my mail, it doesn't seem as though the original question
went out.  If anyone is still willing to help me after all this confusion, 
thanks.  Here is the problem:

The bolt attaching the fan which drives the alternator belt broke.  I put 
a new bolt with lockwasher in, and she was fine for a few weeks.  Now, however,
the bolt comes loose every time she is driven.  I've heard you can spray some
stuff on which makes it impossible to get it out, but that would also make
it very hard to work on if i needed to.  Anybody had similar problems or know
something you could suggest?

goah
