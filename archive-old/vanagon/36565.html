&gt; &quot;ENERGY PAK is a patented on-board microship computer that continuously
&gt; senses electrical resistance across the sparkplug gap, thereby making each
&gt; plug an &quot;in-cylinder&quot; sensor to optimize each spark on each and every
&gt; stroke of the engine.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; So I called them and they happen to have a sale ending today. Their
&gt; &quot;BUG-PAK&quot; now goes for $340 instead of $480. Well, that's still too
&gt; expensive for me, but I thought some of you might want to know.

        You can get a &quot;computer&quot;'s worth of transistors
        on ONE microchip these days -- what's the $340 for??
        I would not be in a hurry to part with the cash...
