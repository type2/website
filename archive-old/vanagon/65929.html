Making my first posting.

Introduction: (Blab, blab, blab.  Those in a hurry skip to next section)

Overwhelmed by the amount of information.  Over 40 postings a day!
Thank God I used &quot;digest mode&quot;.  Could have used a lot of this info
before, but like most of us I learned everything the hardway, on my back
on my driveway.

I have a '85 Wolfsburg Westfalia here in Moscow (brought it over from
Houston) and used to have a '82 Diesel full Westfalia.  For a while me
and my wife were a &quot;two Westfalia family&quot;.  I drove the '82 (truck like)
and she drove the '85 with power steering and air (comfortable car like)
taking the kids around.

Like most Diesel Vanagon owners I bought it when the engine was burned
out because it was a &quot;bargain!&quot; and went through another two engine
rebuilds before I unloaded it.  It was good to me, but it did not like
mountains or hills, I cried non-the-less when I sold it.  (but replaced
it with a Cabriolet, fun!   It fit two baby seats real nice under the
roll bar, but it was hard getting the kids in and out with the top up.)


Also had to rebuild the '85 engine when one of the head bolts failed and
you know what happens then.  That's what we get for buying a air cooled
engine that was &quot;retro fitted&quot; with water cooled heads:  i.e. Head bolts
that are emersed in water.  Not too smart of a design.

But like most of you, I like the interior volume and the way they feel
and drive.  Originally bought it to put windsurfers and drums in but now
have acquired a wife and have three kids.   Even more practical now.  It
even started us camping.  We never camped before, but since we had this
van with a frig and stove and sink and beds, why not try it out??

Technical Question:

For the first few years I owned my '85 (bought in '92) I was going
through a new water pump every 12-18 months.  I first figured that it
was due to low quality &quot;after market&quot; water pumps, and then maybe from
tightening the alternator-waterpump belt  too tight.  It seems that with
a loose or tight belt, it does not make much difference in life.

(also frustrating is the fact that I would keep it loose and when
someone else would work on my van, though it was rare, they would always
tighten the belt to do me a favor and I would not always check it).

Now stuck in Moscow I have been blessed with waterpump life of 24
months, but now it looks like the bearing is going on this one also.
They are also a major pain to change since you have to strip just about
everything off the block to get to it.  (but practice makes perfect)

Anyone with a similar problem?  Any suggestions?

Desperate in Moscow (Russia),

Mike

P.S. Russia Report:  Loads of &quot;Transporters&quot; here as in Europe.  Lots of
commercial use.   The only Westfalia I have seen here are owned by
&quot;foreigners&quot; like myself (maybe only three or four in the city).   Parts
are available here, but like everything in Russia you need to spend
weeks looking for something and if someone does not have it, they give
you a list of 30 other places to check instead of ordering it for you.
Also prices are two to three times what they are in the States.  Oil
filter $18-20 dollars,  etc...  even at a outdoor &quot;fleamarket&quot;.

Having an APO (like a military base) here at the Embassy here I just
Mail order parts from Parts Place in Michigan.
