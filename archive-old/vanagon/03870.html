My wife's sister married her first cousin, and that wasn't down south at 
all, so I guess I'll have to defend the right to be from a place and not 
have ridiculous stereotypes applied.  On the other hand, what does this 
have to do with bricks?  We should be discussing the Dead Head VW 
driver stereotype instead.  Or, now that we all know what it costs to 
maintain one, the rich VW driver.
On third thought, maybe someone could come up with a riddle or a song or 
something ...
