So CLAYDO1_at_aol_dot_com says:
&gt; 
&gt; 1. What kind of Bike racks are out there that mount on the front or the rear,
&gt; I would like to keep them off the top. Can you mount a rack on the rear cargo
&gt; door?

I bought the Hollywood one.  It holds up to three bikes, maybe four.  I'm
not sure.  It basically is a foldable frame that is held to the hatch door
with some belts with plastic clips that you hook on the door edges.  Works
real great.  Won't mar the paint and easy to remove.  I paid about $50 for
it.

&gt; 
&gt; 2. Oil filters. The thought of not running an oil filter makes me nervous.  I
&gt; have seen a setup that runs the oil out of the pump and then back into the
&gt; gallerys somewhere, so it doesnt need any machining.  Does anyone run such a
&gt; unit? Recommendations?

Just change your oil often.  Every 1,500 - 2500 miles or so.  Keep the oil
screen clean and make sure the the relief valves are working properly.
