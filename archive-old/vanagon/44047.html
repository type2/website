Subject: My '83 lives again

        Just got a call from the shop guy and he said that the van started
up just fine when they did it. This means what? That theres some sort of
problem starting it when its hot?
        Im sure Ill hear from the mechanic later as to twhat the problem
was but Id like to hear any other suggestions from all you wonderful
knowledgable people.

(Im just so damn happy its alive again, I was scared.)

Mike
