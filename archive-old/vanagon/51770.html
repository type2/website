Subject: Ultimate Vanagon Bra

Hi Everyone,

After completing the not so epic North American Circle Tour 
(NACT) this year, I've decided to make a number of 
improvements to my '83 diesel Vanagon Westy (watercooled).   I 
logged close to 4,000 of the 27,000 miles on unimproved gravel 
roads, and my front end took a beating.  The next 2 years travels 
in Baja and Mexico will udoubtedly take me on many more of 
these roads so I am now looking for the ultimate front end 
protection - the ultimate bra.  

I'm wondering what companies make them, how well they fit, 
quality etc and what other volks opinions are.  I looked for one 
before leaving on NACT, but had no luck finding the right thing.  
My westy is watercooled so I have the 2 grills and the single 
round headlights.  I am also wondering if anyone knows of, or 
has seen a brush guard for a vanagon, something suitable for 
pushing those old land rovers out of the way ;-).
