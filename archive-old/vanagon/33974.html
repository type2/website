Subject: What's up with this engine?

I'm considering buying a 78 bus w/ 115K miles.  The engine runs kinda
rough, and blows black smoke out the exhaust--the bumper's covered
with carbon.  When driven, it seems strong, even peppy for a bus.
I did a compression test this weekend, and here's the result:

              1 - 138             3 - 110
              2 - 133             4 - 136

In three cylinders, compression is &quot;too high&quot; (out of the 100-130
range), and the fourth is really out of balance.  How should I
interpret these results?  What kind of work might this engine need?

This is the first and only time I've ever used this compression
tester, which I bought at Sears.  Could it be reading too high?

Also, a question about frame rust: There is a small but maybe
significant amount of rust where the frame is welded to the left rear
torsion bar tube.  If this rust is deep (I'm gonna have a mechanic
look at it before I buy), is there ANY chance of getting it repaired
within a normal human's budget?  What is involved?

Thanks for any insight,
Rodney
