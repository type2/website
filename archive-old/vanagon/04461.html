Subject: RE: pictures of &quot;Red&quot;, my 1966 microbus project

It's nice to see some bus scans - any more out
there (Lee G?) waiting for us to enjoy?

Please post URL's if there are any more!

If I had access to a scanner, it would be a
matter of which pictures to scan - there's only a
few hundred to choose from. My favorite would
have to be the two of us in front of the '67
camper. Anthony probably would be unable to
pick one favorite picture (my guess).
