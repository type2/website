&gt;&gt;I picked up a brochure on the Turbo Diesel in France this past 
January...its
&gt;&gt;about 9&quot; tall by 3 &quot; wide...
&gt;
&gt;That's a pretty small engine.  :P


Probably have to cut a hole in the hatch anyway, and build a box over
it to make it fit in a Vanagon.

At least engines made of 4-color offset glossy don't use much fuel.  :^)

And changing clutches would be a LOT simpler than the late, unlamented
example from the V6anagon. Take paper engine in one hand, tranny in the
other, and pull.
