The local paper had an add for an 87 Vanagon. He's asking $3500 and
must sell ASAP. (his words)

Its got AC, power steering, standard trans, 110k miles. He said the
head gaskets were done 100 miles ago, so you can read what you like
into that statement.

I haven't seen it yet but I'd be willing to go look at it if anyone
is interested.
