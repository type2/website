Subject: head liner fix and easy extra curtain project (long)

For ages the vinyl surface covering used throughout my van has been 
peeling-off and curling-up.  Recently, I fell into a temporary frenzy and 
started madly tearing it off the headliner.  This left me with patches still 
stuck on and diff. to remove.  I removed the headliner, handsanded 
and feathered the edges of the stuff I couldn't scrape-off and then 
painted it with 4 coats of some leftover flat white interior latex paint.  Looks 
great!  It brightened-up the interior and is washable.  Took about an 
hour.  
Now I would like to resurface the walls.  I don't think the paint idea 
would be so hot here.  I considered an interesting pattern of cloth (neat 
to look at and pleasent to the touch) but can't think of a way to attach 
it without glue soaking through.  I'd love to hear any suggestions for 
materials and attachment methods.

The curtain.  After the paint project I made a curtain which hangs 
directly behind the front seats.  I bought a length of velcro tape, used 
rubber cement to glue the &quot;hook&quot; side of the tape all the way across the 
rear edge of the headliner and down the door pillar a few edges on each 
side (I didn't like the look of this, but it was needed to &quot;seal&quot; the 
edges of the curtain, also the rubber cement is removable if one changes 
their mind).  
I searched the fabric store odds and ends bin and found a piece of cloth 
that was large enough (a nice brown guatamalan design).  My SO was kind 
enough to seam the edges and sew the &quot;loop&quot; side of the velcro tape 
across the top edge. Done.  Cost: $5. for tape and cloth.  Time: ~2hrs.  
It works very well.  It can be attached almost instantaneously.  I use 
it when I don't want to put up the original &quot;wraparound&quot; curtain, great 
for quick privacy and it can be left up when driving.  Sort of creates 
&quot;another room&quot; downstairs.
Possible improvements include &quot;splitting&quot; it down them middle and making 
some tiedowns to roll it up out of the way.
I'm probably not the first to do this, also, didn't some of the older buses 
have a factory curtain in this location?  If someone wanted the 
cloth measurements I used I would be happy to supply them.
