Subject: Bloomington, IN Bus &amp; Bug show

This is my first post to the Vanagon list, so go easy on me.  I've been
observing for awhile, and figured it was time to try it out.

I read in VW Trends that there will be a Bus &amp; Bug in south central Indiana
this weekend.  I'd love to go, but have familial commitments and won't make
it.  Is anyone out there planning on going?  I saw from the survey that there
are a few other folks from Indiana, and would love to get a report.

I just bought my first VW Bus about 3 weeks ago, and have begun the bonding
(not bondo!) process.  It's a 1979 Westphalia Camper, &quot;sage green&quot; exterior.
 Question:  What was the original color of the bumpers on this model?  The
guy I bought it from had it painted a very non-original nasty color of green
- and painted the bumpers the same color.  There are some serious amateur
runs, drips and errors in his work, and would like to have it redone.   Just
wondering, as I'd like to restore it to
as-near-to-showroom-condition-as-is-economically-feasible.  I've been quoted
around $1,200 for a some minor body work (rust around the lower perimeter)
and paint job.  Does that sound about right?

Look forward to hearing from any other Indiana (I'm in Ft. Wayne) VW
enthusiasts, so I can get up to speed on the ups-and-downs of ownership, etc.

Take care!
