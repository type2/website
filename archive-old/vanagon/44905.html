You don't say whether you bought it from Trans-form, did you?   Has anyone
else had problems with them?  I disappointed to hear this about them, I
thought they were good.

If you bought it from them,have you called them about your tranny problem?
Maybe they'll stand behind their work.

&gt;Knew I forgot to mention someone.  My current tranny, which is 5 years
&gt;old, is quite vehement about jumping out of fourth when put under
&gt;load.  It's almost to the point where I can't hold it in with my hand.
&gt;Others have reported that Transform seems to be lowering their
&gt;quality.  At this point, I'm quite reluctant to have anything more to
&gt;do with them.
