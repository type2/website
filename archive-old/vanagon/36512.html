[no apparent rust, drives well, all receipts]

&gt; 1. I like the '78, but I'm having a hard time believing it's worth 
&gt; only ~$3000 less than one 10 years newer. Does this seem a bit high 
&gt; for a '78?

I'll speak to just the loaf, since I really don't know much about 
bricks--I'll leave brick opinions to someone else.

The '78 sounds pretty good, but probably overpriced IMHO.  I'd offer in 
the 4200-4500 range, and think very hard if the owner wanted to go much 
above that.  I'd think mostly about the REAL rust situation (I'd hate to 
see you pay that much for clever rust-patching bodywork), and the 
difficulty/expence of fixing up the interior.  I don't know how the 
others feel, but the interior has to be a place you can feel comfortable 
in, or you won't get out camping and generally lazing around as much as 
you might like.

Sounds like the owner might be pitching it high, having just slapped a 
paint job on the body, and splashed paint on the pop-top.  Why do this?  
To cover up body work?  To try to get an inflated resale price?  Why do 
all this cosmetic stuff to the outside yet leave the interior in the 
condition you describe.  Puts up a few red flags (or big question marks, 
anyway) for me.

Whichever bus you get, be sure to have it properly road-tested this July 
and August on the unpaved roads of the Yukon and Northwest Territories!
