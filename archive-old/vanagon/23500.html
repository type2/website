Subject: &quot;The Car That Never Took Us To No Fun&quot;


  I've came across a newspaper article somewhat off the beaten bike
  path....  but perhaps by not that much.  It offers an unique
  insight into the mind of an European teenager in the fifties --
  sixties for whom the family car has never been a source of fun,
  freedom or the Saturday Night-type pursuit of, er, happiness. It
  should provide a refreshing slice of a reality that was the norm
  in Western Europe not so long ago, so unlike that which ya Yanks
  on this list are used to. A hint: it helps to read it with a map
  of Scandinavia at the elbow.

  The Car That Never Took Us To No Fun
--------------------------------------
      by Anne-Marie Berglund

  Father drives, Mother thrives, the child shivers in the backseat. 
  Whenever we were going home to Finland on vacation it was so wild. 
  And the party wouldn't stop until the money was all drunk up.  It
  weighted a lot in the pocket of a labourer who worked hard all
  year round.  It had to burn up, else there was no meaning of it
  all. 

  People like us took no cabin [on a ferry across the Baltic] at
  that time, but made their stead in adjustable resting chairs.  One
  went from Kapellskar to Nadendal, the cheapest route.  The aunties
  knitted frenetically, read Allers [a lowbrow family magazine] and
  solved crosswords like my mother.  The uncles snored loudly, those
  that did not get drunk.  We children were all forrest kids or from
  Vasteras or Eskilstuna [two heavy-industry towns near Stockholm]. 
  We socialized up on the deck, our mouths black of licorice.  Later
  with real ale and kisses. 

  Dad disappeared with the wallet and the car keys, we saw him first
  at six the next morning.  The nice, white nylonshirt was not so
  nice anymore.  He got strong mints not to smell that much, and we
  cleaned him up with wet napkins. 

  It was he who had to drive the car off the car deck.  And we had a
  new car.  We always had.  We did not go to Finland if we did not
  have a new car to show off. 

  Mother and I sit breathlessly.  The meekest word and he may end up
  driving our entire future to Hell. 

  Afterwards one's been thinking why has she not, not a single time,
  slapped his face.  Or gotten a driving license of her own.  But
  one knows the answer.  Deep inside one carries the same blockade.

  He makes it every time.  Presumably because he's so afraid to
  scratch the lack.  By the Aura river near Abo there was a coffee
  kiosk, we drank more coffee and then proceeded towards Esbo and
  the relatives.  The cousins are getting Dajm and Japp [chocolote
  bars].  And the oldfolks are having King's sardines in tomato
  sauce. 

  Grandpa sweeps a hand over the blank metal.  It is the light-blue
  VW 1500 this time.  The first car we came with was a second-hand
  black little Bug.  This one is third in a row.  A spit brand-new
  one.  Dad will be faithful to Volkswagen during all his time in
  Sweden.  Perhaps to signal that he isn't buying Volvo... 

  It's going well over there in Sweden! Oh yes, we could write a
  list of all the new that we got in a mere few years: electric
  Yule-tree lights, an almond grinder, enameled cast-iron casserole,
  heath-resistant baking forms, the TV of course, vacuum cleaner and
  lately all the furniture...  And the lass got a bike.  The lass
  has learned to swim.  The lass has been confirmed now.  Soon she
  will be able to take the ferry to Finland alone.

  That new car is paid for in monthly instalments.  As is all that
  other, even the &quot;Our Birds in Norden&quot; encyclopedia.  But it is the
  sake of the car that one has to stint for.  It costs more than the
  rent each month.  And if one doesn't pay up promptly, receipt it
  is called, they come and take the whole house. 

  We don't have a house, but if they take the car, we can't afford
  to live here any more.  Dad must have the car to go to work each
  day.  Like the chainsaw it is a worktool of his. 

  Unable to afford school excursions.  No color crayons or
  Wahlstroms' girl books before Christmas.  No black elastics and
  no new winter jacket.

  Buying a new car, preferably every second year, paid in the length
  he said.  How, we never understood it Mom and I.

  But whichever one it was, red black light-blue or chrome, we
  marked that that car never took us to anything fun.  And if
  sometimes against all odds we were given a ride, it was never
  convenient to stop by an ice-cream stand, park it near so one
  could go to a cafe, or drive slowly to watch the lanscape. The 
  windows were not to be pulled down however hot it was.  And if 
  one laughed, it could lead to a flat. 

  Our lot was to sit there all-serious, wishlessly, and listen to
  father's sermonizing over all the idiots that were out there on
  the Sunday roads.

  Nowadays we cycle all through the summers, my mother and I. It is
  our only possibility to see the world together. The world is Esbo
  and Grankulla in Finland.  And we stop precisely where we will,
  eat ice-cream and drink Jaffa of our heart's desire.  And we laugh
  and shout while we ride. Not even rain prevents us from cycling.

  Dad, he rubs and polishes that car which he has left.  The
  retirement check that comes from Sweden every month leaves hardly
  enough to afford a new car in his time any more. 

  He ponders why his daughter never acquired a driving license. 
  Yes, shouldn't she be getting one, she asks herself.  In order to
  be able to take father out for a ride one beautiful day.  When his
  driving days are over.
