Subject: List Must Mass VW On A/C



O.K., gang -- here it is:

I've got my 87 weekender on the road...

Now Ive got an '82 Diesel Westphalia for sale.  If I do not get any offers
in e-mail (or any interest), then I'll get the clutch fixed by my mechanic
(yes, I gave up on doing it myself--too little time too much to do) and
put a big forsale sign on it...  I also have an AUDI 5000 SW forsale,
although I doubt if anyone in this list or anywhere would want it -- I'll
still let you know the specs for the heck of it, see if there's any interest
in that one also.

I'll also appreciate if anybody has any idea how much I should be asking
for the 82 camper (with and without a working clutch).  here it is: 

82 Diesel Westphalia Camper
108,000 miles
few very small rust spots, no holes or rust patches.
somewhat weathered, but intact paint (12 yrs old)
No major dents, never in a major accident. Only nicks
from shopping carts, etc. 
Rear bumper hit once, straigthened out as much as possible
Has the standard stuff, the stove, sink, refrigerator,
stove and refrigerator work very well, the sink is missing
one small plastic piece ($10.00 according to dealer).
4-speed
good all-weather tires
serviced to VW specs all its life, including the valve adjustment
every 15,000 miles -- oil changed (20W50) every 3,000 miles.  The brakes
are quite new, the front disks replaced at 85,000 miles, the rear cylinders
re-built recently.


85 AUDI 500 StationWagon
5-speed
A/C broken  (I got one estimate -- $350.00)
175,000 + miles
engine in perfect condition, interior
in good shape, but exterior is run-down
looking.
