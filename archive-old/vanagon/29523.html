Volks,
	I got this email from a guy that is apparently pretty heavily
involved with VW diesels.  I checked out his web page, and although
it is full of typos and adverts for himself, he seems like an honest
bloke, and maybe someone on the list would be in need of his services.
FWIW...

&gt; Mr. Schwarze,
&gt;                    Please forgive me for intruding. I was given your email
&gt; address and told you may have interest in the VW Diesel, or know of peoples that
&gt; indeed do. If this is correct would you mind passing on my email and URL to
&gt; them. Thank you.
&gt; 
&gt; Sincerely
&gt;
