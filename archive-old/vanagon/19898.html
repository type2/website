Subject: I need info from UK'ers.

Hello, all across the water.

Would someone check with the nearest VW garage for the current asking price
for a '93 1.9 diesel SWB T4?  I discovered that it would only cost me forty
pounds to import it to Ireland and the prices in the UK are much much
cheaper than ours.

TIA (again)
