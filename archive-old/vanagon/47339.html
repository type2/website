&gt;BUT friends of ours had a horrible experience at the time we went

&gt;have ever had in Canada and Manitoba.  This individual was asked for
&gt;his license, had his # run and a DWI (Driving While Intoxicated)
&gt;came up.  The guard would not let him enter Canada tho his wife and
&gt;children could.  The man is black and his wife is white.  The guard
&gt;told him the &quot;We don't want your type here.  Leave and never try to
&gt;enter again.&quot; 
&gt;
&gt;I was dumbfounded when I heard this.  Can anyone shed light on this?
&gt;Is Canada restrictive of people with DWI or is this as bad as it
&gt;appears?

I haven't been paying really close attention lately due to some work
deadlines, but I think that some of southern cousins are forgetting
that the WAR on drugs started there.... 

I've known some Canadian customs agents, and they *luv* to see some
guy pull up in a bus. And they are payed to be serious type folks-
they do have to deal with people trying to BS them all the time.
If you get caught trying to bring something illegal over the border
then YOU ARE STUPID. It isn't worth it.....

And anyone arrested for driving drunk shouldn't ever drive again, let
alone across the border into our country. Some of us really don't want
that type here...

Just my opinion.
