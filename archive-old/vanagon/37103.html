I don't know if you have any &quot;real&quot; hardware stores in your area, but I
wouldn't personally go to the &quot;Home Despot&quot; for more than the basics.  You
should be able to find comparable stainless steel bolts at a well-equipped
store.  Note, however, that I'm not familiar with those bolts.  Are they
carriage bolts? as I would expect?...
