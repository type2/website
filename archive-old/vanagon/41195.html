&gt;Hi all;
&gt;	I am trying to repair my left hand carb on my '72 bus.  The carb

&gt;that I bought for parts.  However, they look a little different.  the old
&gt;carb has this square thing twards the upper right side nearest the front
&gt;of the bus.  it dosn't look like it is doing anything and appears to be
&gt;missing a cover and some parts.  the new carb does not have this.

I've seen carbs like that.  Can't remember if they are specific to a year,
but if I had to guess, I'd say your old one is a 72 carb.  The new one is
likely from a later year.  The jets in the carbs changed many times between
72 and 74 - the chances of them being the same are pretty slim.  I believe
your 72 should have 155 air-correction jets and 137.5 main jets.  The
former are in the top of the carb (you can see them through the throat if
you know where to look, otherwise pull the 5 bolts and lift up the top of
the carb to see).  The latter are in the bottom of the bowl.  You can see
the mains by removing the 13mm bolt from the bottom of the bowl and peeking
in (drain the gas out first!).

I don't know what the square part you describe does, but I thought the same
thing at first - that there was something missing.  Never found out what it
was that was missing, and the carb worked great.  When I looked closely at
that square part, I noticed that there were no holes or levers or anything
else in it that connected it with the inside of the carb.  I reasoned then
that the carb could operate without whatever it was that fastened onto
there.
