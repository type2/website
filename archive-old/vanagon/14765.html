'82 Diesel - NuBus

On Saturday, I was driving to the airport to do a little pleasure
flying. As I was cruising down the NYS Thruway, I was having
no problem holding 70MPH indicated (65 MPH calibrated) groundspeed.
I even had pedal left to push..

I was harumphing all you Naysayers...NuBus was really moving.

When I got to the airport, I found out why. NuBus had a 15 MPH
tailwind the entire way. The drive back, as you can imagine, was
different.
