So David with-temperary-bragging-rights Schwarze says:
&gt; 
&gt; Yeah, yeah, and I've heard it before.  I heard it last Saturday and the
&gt; weekend before that too.  People have been ragging on the Chargers from
&gt; day one, saying they would end up last in the AFC, yadda yadda yadda.
&gt; They were so cocky in Pittsburgh everyone was booking flights to Miami
&gt; and printing T-shirts before the game started.  The Chargers may be
&gt; underdogs for the Superbowl, but they have proven over and OVER again
&gt; that they never give up, and they WILL give San Fran a run for it's money.
&gt; So THERE!
&gt; 
&gt; GO CHARGERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
&gt; 

I have only one thing to say to you David...

BLOWOUT!!!!!!!    :( )
