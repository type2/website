Subject: '88 Westy Frig

        As a new owner of the outfit I am trying to get to know our unit.  I
am interested in any tips you may have on &quot;lighting the frig&quot;.  The frig
works well on 12 volts, 110 volts, and propane.  However I it seems to be
difficult to get the propane lit.  When we first bought the van, the frig
started nicely.  After a refill I couldn't get it to light.  Seemed like we
had spark but no gas.  I repalaced the thermocouple.  

        Any tips would be greatly appreciated.

        Thanks.
