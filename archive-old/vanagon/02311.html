Subject: Re: Sources for replacement mufflers

About a week ago I had a muffler put on my Westfalia '82 and it cost 
$120.00 for the muffler only. This price was for  an original  VW 
muffler, purchased and put on by a local VW (not dealer) mechanic in 
Toronto. 
The tailpipe was a carry over from the old muffler and cost 8 dollars 
with the clamp.

The 45 dollar price sounds very good. I know JCW has them for about 60 
US, but neither of these would be original VW if that is what you are 
after.... DC
