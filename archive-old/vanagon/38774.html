Subject: re: Redline MTL

    About using MTL in the '85 Jetta TD I WANT TO NOTE, MTL IS NOT
    THE CORRECT FILL FOR FWD VW's. VW WILL VOID YOUR WARRANTY FOR
    USING IT. FOR VANS IT IS GREAT STUFF, FOR FWD, SOME USE IT WITH
    SUCESS OTHERS CLAIM IT CAUSES PROBLEMS.
I'm curious about this - I called Redline direct &amp; was told MTL was 
fine for both the bus and the Jetta, although they did say MT90 was 
also ok for the Jetta.

    That said Redline solved the problem by issuing a fill specific
    for FWD VW applications like this Jetta, the correct stuff is
    MT90 in 75W90 as it should be, in GL4 only, for a new FWD VW
    application this is the choice, but the MTL at 80W90 might be a
    good choice for a high miles box, the thicker oil taking up some
    of the slop and backlash. 
My MTL says its a 75W80.... It definitely reduced gear clash when 
cold in 2nd &amp; 3rd, and if it'll help my Jetta tranny past 400,000 km, I'll 
be happy! As for the bus, I haven't really driven it since, been too 
busy with other stuff, so I'll have to see. I have the PO's bill for 
a new tranny at $2600, so I figured I'd spend the few bucks to make 
it last...
