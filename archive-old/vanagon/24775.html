Subject: Re: Doing the Seal

hi Gerry,
  can't help you with the end play problem, but i just changed my clutch
(endplay was okay) and almost overlooked the gasket ring inside the
flywheel. totally crumbly ! it wasn't in the clutch kit i got from rocky mtn.
motorworks so i had to get it locally. only couple of bucks. i don't think
this will fix your problem, but one thing less overlooked is one nightmare
less coming up, rite ???

&gt; Agreed on the GBG part.  I read this very carefully many times before my
&gt; last project.  The seal isn't leaking because I'm putting it in wrong.
&gt; It's leaking because the end play is way out there and I'm concerned
&gt; because I don't think I can fix it because the motion is not the flywheel
&gt; against the case, it's the bearing sliding in the case.
&gt; Thanks!
&gt;
