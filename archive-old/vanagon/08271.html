Gerry, please don't feel too bad for posting this to the group.  It is
nice to know that the editor of this fine mag can see &quot;no benifit&quot; 
from having the ear of 250+ VW enthusiasts.  Nice spelling by the way.
Maybe he was distracted by their latest centerfold.

&gt; 
&gt; Don,
&gt; I've removed your name from the list.  I was not responsible for the 
&gt; addition of your address to the list but I apologize for the manner in 
&gt; which it was done.
&gt; 
&gt; Please feel free to email me if you'd like something distributed to the 
&gt; list without being on the list.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks.
&gt;

&gt; &gt; Please take my name off the list. At this time there is no benifit for either
&gt; &gt; your group or ours. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; PLEASE UNSUBSCRIBE.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Thank you.
