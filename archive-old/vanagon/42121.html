Subject: relabeled Trooper

Does anyone here know about an Isuszu Trooper relabeled as a Volkswagen?

I passed one of these today on I495 (DC Beltway) and suspect it was 
someone with a weird sense of humor.  Looked like the various logos off 
of a vanagon.  Had a VW vinyl cover for the spare tire as well.

Odd....
