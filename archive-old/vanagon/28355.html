&gt; So why don't we drop the whole thing and get back to talking about

Amen!

This _STUPID_ thread is the reason I dropped VinatgeVW!

Arguing here isn't going to change these magazines.  ACK!

So, can anyone tell me when European busses ceased to have 
semaphores.  I saw a green kombi with the same taillights as my '57, 
but not turn signals, and I couldn't see any semaphores by the doors.

Odd!
