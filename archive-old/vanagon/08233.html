I once mounted what I remember as an &quot;airplane landing light&quot; behind the
front grill of an Alfa Romeo that I had years and years ago.   It had a
parabolic beam and it was bright enough to melt trees.  Problem was it drew
so much power that it needed about 5 seconds to come up to full brightness
so it didn't really work as an offensive weapon as far as oncoming traffic
was concerned.  This was probably a good thing.  But it was great on the
really deserted country roads where I was living back then.
