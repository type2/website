Subject: Re: speaking of paint

&gt;  Another option we considered was getting the entire shell shotblasted but 
this
&gt;  was very expensive, this takes it back to bare metal.

Some thought on sandblasting.  I asked about bare metal resto of a porsche, 
sandblasting all the paint off.  It is better to get it tanked clean after 
paint stipping the worst off (tanking is not a backyard job!) Sandblasting 
the surface hardens the metal producing a metal more inclined to crack than 
flex. This was not desirable as the cracks _could_ lead to fatigue failure 
of panels near joints etc. Bad for unibody cars.  Surface hardening effect 
is certainly real, but seemed far fetched as far as a daily driver goes, 
maybe on my next F-1 racer.....  tim s.
