Subject:       Re: Ques: squeak under passenger seat.

&gt; 
&gt; Conditions of squeak under front passenger seat:
&gt;         Squeak seems to be inside, directly under seat, when bus is in motion.
&gt;         Does not occur when bus is stopped, or when someone sits in seat.
&gt;         -Intermittent, and somewaht related to the road condition.
&gt; 
&gt;         It does not seem to come *from* the seat,
&gt;                  more from the &quot;box&quot; under the seat.
&gt; 

And within that &quot;box&quot; is the suspension bushings...
