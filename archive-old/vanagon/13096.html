Subject: To unlead or not

I think I definitely got an answer as to whether I can safely run my 82 bus on 
unleaded. I called one of my local VW dealers, the best in the area and he said
unleaded is ok, but because the bus had previously used only leaded fuel (the UK
has only had unleaded less than 10yrs, I think), I should fill up with a mixture of
of 1 leaded tank to every 5 unleaded. He actually had a lookup table where he 
could look up the +Pb/-Pb ratio for every age of vehicle. It seems the lead 
works as a lubricant and removing it altogether can cause some damage. 
	He also said I should just use normal unlead and there was no need for 
premium/super.
	Hope this is of interest and useful to someone.

Cheers
