Subject: Tow Bar for 78

I am looking for a tow bar for my 78.  I put out the word on the
vintagvw list and only learned not to get them from performance
auto.  If anyone knows where I can get one or have any sugges-
tions at all please let me know.  (I hate to admit it but I'm
too busy at this moment to work on it and I want to go
camping.  I need to tow it to Mad-town to see the good doctor.)

Thanks,

BC
