&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Just my $.02.  I bought a 1600DP longblock from GEX back in 1985.  It has 
&gt; &gt;been in three different vehicles and I've never had a bit of trouble with 
&gt; &gt;it.  It currently has about 75,000 miles on it.
&gt; 
&gt; What is GEX?
&gt; 
&gt; Ron
&gt; 
&gt; 
GEX is a company in the LA area that sales rebuilt motors for VW's.  I
just talked to them on the phone last night.  I am trying to nail down
prices so I can get to ordering.  The guy I talked with was professional 
sounding and seemed concerned about my concerns with the motor and 
such.  Given the sometimes unreliable nature of rebuilt air-cooled 
motors a company that a) knows what they are doing and b) will stand 
behind the occasional goof is c) worth their weight in gold.  People 
have had problems with their engines in the past but I haven't yet 
heard some the real horror stories I have heard about from companies 
like ECI or MOFOCO.  When they goof they go the extra mile to get 
things straight.  Or so it seems.  I think I will be ordering from 
them for the same reasons I will pay a little more for parts from 
Rocky Mountain Motor Works.  Indications are that you will get what 
you order and they will stand behind it after the sale.  Please insert
your opinion below.  I am about to spend a chuck of change.  Jim
