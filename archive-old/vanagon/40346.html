Subject: Re: Gas prices (NPR 4/22/96)

NPR's &quot;All Things Concidered&quot; mentioned last evening (4/22/96) that the main
rationale for the price increases has been the anticipation of the UN
temporarily allowing Iraq to sell crude on the world market. Also cited was
the increased usage of dino-products via popularity of &quot;minivans&quot; and trucks
and the associated lack of aerodynamics.
When I heard this I thought &quot;Huh?!&quot; To me, something sounds like our
dipstick is being pulled...
NPR's report also mentioned that an inordinate amount of crude was diverted
to the production of heating oil via demand in both northern continents (No.
Am and Europe) because of the harsh winter. THey played an interview from
some &quot;authority&quot; who said that it was unusual that &quot;both&quot; contintents has a
harsh winter in the same year... (OK...)
Barrel crude prices are supposedly at the highest level since the week prior
to the Gulf War. It was also mentioned that we haven't even yet hit the
seasonal demands.
Anticipated record setting 100F in Phoenix this week. I guess I'll have to
drive over to San Diego to &quot;get away from it all&quot; and see a dancing Sea Lion
wearing a pirate's hat or Steve Maher. ;-)   Oh well it's apted to cool off
by Halloween.
