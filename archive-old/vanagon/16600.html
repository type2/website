Subject: My new radiator



Got my re-cored rad back from the shop yesterday, (only cost Can$235, not
the quoted Can$275). Re-installed it this morning along with a new
expansion tank (the old one had a crack in one of the outlets, the new one
has metal sleeves inside those outlets, no more cracks?). The
re-installation went smoothly except for the
copper-tube-windshield-washer-heater gizmo I had soldered on, got hung up
a bit, nothing serious. Refilled the cooling system with Zerex (no not
Autobahn holy water) and distilled water. Took a heap o' bleeding. I
didn't install the lower temp thermostat, stayed with the 87 C one. The
van now has more reserve cooling capacity, and you know, I think it runs
smoother :)
I haven't tried out the windshield washer heater yet, still have to tap
into the line.

I recommend that all you watercooled folks check yer rads before summer.

While I was in the mechaniicking mood, I lubricated all the door strikers
and lock mechanisms with a teflon + oil lubricant. Its amazing what a
difference it makes, doors close easier and the sliding door opens and
closes like you think it should.
