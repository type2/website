&gt;Now for the coolant...'83 1.9 litre wasser boxer...great runner,  great
&gt;looker....no leakage of coolant any where....no &quot;odor&quot; of coolant from
&gt;the exhaust...plugs are a little grey {fuel additive}...coolant changed
&gt;yearly,  phosphate free.... VW says no leaks and exhaust analyzer shows
&gt;a healthy engine...why would I be loosing around 500ml of coolant
&gt;every 1500 miles or so???  It has never done this before in its
&gt;60K mile life.  Evaporation?  Bastard neighbors messing with my mind?
&gt;Am I worrying about nothing?  Help!

i had a similar problem on my 88 bus ... it was a leak, but an extremely
small and slow one. when the coolant had been replaced, they had failed to
tighten one of the clamps back correctly, and it took me several months to
find it ... it would leak just a few drops, and they didn't make it to the
ground.

the only way i actually found it was that i had just shut the car off  and
was looking for something else, when i noticed this little faucet-drip of
coolant hanging on one of the clamps. after i tightened that clamp just
one more turn, the &quot;disappearing coolant&quot; stopped disappearing.

so i would suggest re-checking all the clamps that you even suspect MIGHT
have been messed with during the coolant replacement ... maybe just give
them all another half-turn.
