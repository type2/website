Subject: battery venting

I am replacing the battery in my '87 Westfalia and have a question about
battery venting. The PO was using a gel cell battery as the primary
battery--I am going to use this as an aux battery and use a conventional
lead-acid battery as the primary battery. The battery that I purchased has
provisions for venting the hydrogen that is released during charging. There
are two 1/4&quot; attachments for a hose of some sort. The battery box (under
the passenger seat) has two 1&quot; holes that appear to be for battery venting.
My questions are:

Do I really need to vent the battery?
How do I vent the battery?

I can't find anything in Bentley about this.
