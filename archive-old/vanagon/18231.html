Subject: introduce myself

	Hello,I'm very new here and I would like to introduce myself.
	I have VW Transporter FWD 2500 c.c. long-wheel-base (you call it
 Eurovan,right?),8-seat ,the suspension kit from ABT is installed,
the wheel is MB 500SL's 8*16 with 225/55 ZR yoko AVS.
	The problem are
	1. the car is very underpowered ,especially when fully loaded with
	8 passengers ,are there any way to improve ?
	2. ride is the big problem too,very very stiff ride (too stiff for
	passenger car) even with stock suspension (I think 8*16 is a cause)
		If anyone has experience of modifying the Eurovan,please let
	me know (No nitrus oxide please) my car is 5-speed manual.
		excuse me if my English skill is not good,I'm a student in
poor country.
				Thanks
