Hi Mark,

&gt;    fine around town, but after a long (i.e., &gt;100 miles or so) trip I
&gt;    have to roll under there and do the screwdriver across the terminals
&gt;    routine before she'll start up.  What are folks doing, short (hmmm...)
&gt;    of starter rebuilds?
&gt; 

I've installed piggyback's on my Rabbit and Van and have had no problems 
whatsoever with starting since the operations.  I used a small (fog lamp 
type) Bosch relay for the Rabbit and a large, generic Ford solenoid ($5 _at_ 
Checker) for the van.  Prior to installing the relays I had to jump both 
vehicles whenever they were hot.  YMMV but It's a fix I recommend to 
anyone having problems with getting current to a VW solenoid.
