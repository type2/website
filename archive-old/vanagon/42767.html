If there's in only one wire to the sensor, then it depends on the head 
for ground return, so you need an electriclly conductive way to attach 
it. It's a thermister, which changes resistance with temperature. I think 
head temps get up to at least 300 deg F normally. A helicoil might be a 
good solution.
