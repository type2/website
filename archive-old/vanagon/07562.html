&gt; 	David, if indeed you've got nothing but gasoline Vanagons and
&gt; used to own bugs, then timing belts aren't an issue. If you have a diesel
&gt; Vanagon or any boxer water pumper, that ol' belt *DOES* need to be changed
&gt; every 50-65K miles. And VWs, unlike, say Toyotas, will break the engine
&gt; if the belt fails.

There's no timing belt in MY vanagon. The horizontally opposed 4 VWs all
have pushrods.  The deisel as I see in my manual is a straight 4 with a 
long twisted timing belt.  The newer vws - front engine types - may 
have timing belts -- I don't know, but generalizations are dangerous.
