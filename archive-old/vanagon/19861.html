&gt; but the question is: do you guys mind if i do this. i don't want to get
&gt; toooooo free and easy with what some of you might consider private info.
&gt; it's one thing for me to post the stuff like AL - 3  or NC - 14 on the
&gt; Weakly Stats, but this is a little different and some folks might be a bit
&gt; .. i don't know, &quot;uneasy&quot;???
&gt; 
&gt; see, i'm a little paranoid myself, ;) so i can understand any reluctance to
&gt; Little Brother spreading this kind of info all around.
&gt; 
&gt; anyway, if ANYONE has objections to it, i won't do it (or i can delete your
&gt; info individually) ... so any Objectees out there, let me know. i'll wait
&gt; until tomorrow or Friday to get the Digest Mode folks time to get a vote in.

  A little more geographical info would be nice. I was chatting with John
  Hugenard at the last bash at Martha's and felt somewhat embarrassed when I
  learned that we live about 5 blocks apart and it is HIS Vanagon camper that
  I have been coveting for the last year or so....
