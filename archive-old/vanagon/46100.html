&gt;         While returning from my long weekend bush adventure I noticed that

&gt; water we had consumed from the tank, so I know it wasnt that. I checked for
&gt; leaks underneath, thinking that I may have puntured a fuel line or some
&gt; damned thing, but it offered no greater insight. The hills were bad coming
&gt; home, but again, not a drastic enough change to account for the dimished
&gt; fuel. The trip home to Edmonton was about 300km, and I used almost 2 full
&gt; tanks. SOMETHING IS WRONG!
&gt;         I now turn to you for insight o' wise list members.

- Check your O2 sensor. If it hasn't been replaced in awhile, you
should replace it. ( &lt; $50 I think). A bad O2 sensor will drop your
mileage in half. My '84 Vanagon went from 10mpg to 19pmg when I
replaced the O2 sensor this spring. The 02 sensor is that cylindrical
thing screwed into the exhaust pipe. It should have a wire coming out
of it.

(p.s. the O2 sensor light only does not come on when the O2 goes bad.)
