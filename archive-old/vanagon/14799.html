Subject: Piston slap update

Hiya, Gang!

I've put some more miles on my just-rebuilt Westy engine
this weekend, and so far it runs fine!  I went down the
the fishin' hole in Cottonwood on Sunday, and today I
have it at work (Flagstaff).  I also stopped by the local
VW mechanic in Flag and asked for his assesment of the
noise it makes.  His opinion is that it's not piston
slap, or rod knock, but it *is* coming from somewhere
inside the case.

In short, nobody knows what the noise is.  I'm out of 
ideas as well.  But as long as it runs, and I don't
see any pieces of metal in the oil, I'm gonna *try* not
to worry about it.

On a side note, I was at the local Autozone parts place this
weekend looking for a Mann oil filter (ha!), and spotted
a filter labeled &quot;Duetch&quot;(sp?) at an incredebly low price
of $2.50.  When I got it home, naturally I discovered it's
made in U.S.A. by the Duetch corporation!  Well, what the
heck, the price was right!  Except that when I installed it
and fired up the engine, I hear &quot;BANG&quot; coming from the back,
and all kinds of terrible things race thu my mind.  I get
out to look and see oil splattered everywhere, and the outer
case of the filter laying on the ground!  I went back to
the Mann filter and haven't had any problems again.
