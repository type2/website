Subject: Re: Synthetic Oil (?)

A couple of months back, on the Porsche list there was a similar discussion on 
synthetic oil, I saved a huge diatribe on synthetic oil.  I didn't want to 
waste bandwith by sending it out without seeing if people wanted it.  Or, if 
someone wants it seperately I'll send it straight to them.  It really is quite 
informative, but, the main subject is SLICK 50 (horrors).
