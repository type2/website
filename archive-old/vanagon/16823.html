inspection time is coming up soon and i need some help.  i have a '73 loaf
with no headlight dimmer.  i am perpetually in bright mode.  i checked
that the wires from the switch [brn and brn/wht] actually go to the relay.
 i checked that all three wires are connected from the relay to the
headlights. all are.  i even yanked all the wires out of the fuse box
gizzmo [all the wires involved that is] and connected them directly to the
relay.  nothing.  what's up?  if i don't get this fixed, i'm gonna fail
inspection.  twenty-nine days and counting.

please help...
