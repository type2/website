&gt; i am new to the air cooled world (have a 82 scirocco, it has been a 
&gt; very mixed reltationship) i plan on buying a bus.  so the other day 
&gt; i drove a 79 at it drove great, had plenty of power.  my only 
&gt; concerns were two: one that there was a smell, the engine, when the 
&gt; heater was turned on, two there was a slight ( a few drops) amount 
&gt; of oil leaking from were i presume the two heads are.  how serious 
&gt; are these two things?

Neither of these seems bad.  The fact that the heater works at all is
a plus for it, in my book.

Depending where the oil leak is coming from, it may or may not be serious,
but those years typically leak from the pushrod tubes.  Take it to a
mechanic to be sure...
