Subject: Yikes! Leaking Fuel

Driving the urchins to day care this morning (cold) aned I see fluid dripping
from warming van.  Think, here goes my head gaskets, but no, it's coming off
the cv boot.  Drive kids short way and return, check fluid.  It's gas.
 Coming from a unit mounted at the top front of the engine, dripping down off
passenger side cv boot.

Looking in Bently and the fuel pump does not appear to be there.

Still looking, but I thought I'd throw out a call for help.  What it this,
and how do I cure?

Thanks
Peter Krogh
