&gt;           Actually, you're supposed to have the battery all connected
&gt;           when you short the solenoid/starter connections
&gt;           together...read Sty. Muir, as it helped me a lot with my
&gt;           current problem...I'm still tossing around the idea of
&gt;           trying the Ford Horn relay kludge, but its starting okay
&gt;           now...when it doesn;t start, I just get underneath the car,
&gt;           short the started switch wire to the battery connection oh
&gt;           the solenoid a few times, it makes a horrible noise, and
&gt;           then the car will start 5 or 6 times at the key. Also, make
&gt;           sure that your starter switch wire is actually connected to
&gt;           the solenoid...for a while, mine kept falling off.

We have the Ford/Chrysler solenoid in both of our busses. Because of
the length, hence the increased resistance, of the wire that goes
from the ignition switch to the starter, the extra solenoid saves
crawling under the bus to use a nickle or a quarter to get it started
on the days when the starter is stubborn. We highly reccommend Muir
solenoid trick.
