Subject: Re: Vanagon/Motor Home Insurance

John Seal,

I want to thank you for saving me almost 25% on my insurance.

I followed through on your suggestion and yesterday I  got my '86 syncro
westy reclassified as a VW MOTORHOME from a VW CAMPER VAN. The yearly
rate dropped from $Cdn 552 to $Cdn 428 from ZURICH Insurance in Ontario,
Canada.

Thanks,
Larry Johnson

&gt; 
&gt; Using $17190 as new cost of MY 85 Westy, Met Life changed my 6 month
&gt; insurance premium from $174 to $169. They changed the body type from VAN
&gt; CAMPER to MOTOR HOME.
&gt;
