&gt; And then there's my own personal favorite:
&gt; 
&gt; Aim it rearward, at the radiators of those who tailgate you in the slow
&gt; lane. They would benefit from some contemplative time sitting by the
&gt; side of the road enveloped in a cloud of steam, waiting for the tow truck.

Superb idea!  Most of us would be impervious to such a device too.  
Oh, but when do you see an air-cooled bus tailgating someone!  Except 
for maybe a cement truck or horse-drawn carriage...  :)
