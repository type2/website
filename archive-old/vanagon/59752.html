Subject: Removal of Cylinder Sleeves

First I'd like to thank all of those list members who have been active
participants in helping me get to know my Westie intimately.  With a
special thanks to AVP for all the time they've spent on 'hardware
support', great prices, friendly service et all..... THANKS!

But yes, yet another question.  How do I remove the cylinder sleeves? 
Do I really need VW Part 3092?  Can I just yank hard??

Thanks,

Dan
