Jon,
	I beg to differ.  :)  My mustang has a sqeaky throwout bearing which,
under no load (i.e. pedal OUT) whistles annoyingly.  When I push the pedal
in a little, the load that is put on the throwout bearing quiets it.  I did
the clutch replacement myself, and am very familiar with how things operate
down there.  FYI, the throwout bearing was a low-bid item bought at auto
parts club.  Next time I'm going Napa.

I'm not trying to say that your diagnosis of the input shaft carrier bearing
is wrong, simply that there are other likely possibilities.

One more thing, there should never be any load on the input shaft of the
transmission (only torque applied to it).
