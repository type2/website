&gt;&gt;Ok,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;        I've had a couple of replies on the 25hp vs 36hp
&gt;&gt;motor questions.  This much I knew going into it:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;        * The 25/36 hp motors both have the generator stand
&gt;&gt;built into the right half of the case
&gt;&gt;        * The 25/26hp motors both have the fuel pump on
&gt;&gt;the left side of the case with the big funky tube up to
&gt;&gt;the carb.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;        Now what else besides the case and the fuel pump
&gt;&gt;and a few cc's of displacement do they have?  Or is it just an
&gt;&gt;internal difference like the 1500 vs 1600?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;        What is the displacement of the 25/36 horse motors?
&gt;&gt;something like 1100, isn't it?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Thom
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Thom:
&gt;
&gt;Yes the displacement of the 36hp motor is 1100cc.  I am not totally
&gt;positive about the 25hp motor.  One of the things that I have noticed
&gt;about the 36hp motor that I have is the rocker arms.  The rocker arms
&gt;are the same for both the intake and exhaust.  In the later engines
&gt;the rocker arms are made at different angles for the intake and exhaust
&gt;valves.  In fact there are many stuble  differences between the 36hp and
&gt;later motors.                   ^^^^^^


&lt;g&gt; oh how the slip of the fingers can change the context of the sentence,

sorry couldn't resist, happy new year everyone!

(yes i did shave today!)



  I know that not too many people around the area know too
&gt;much about the older motors
