Subject: Help!! 1978 Bus won't start!!

Ok, here is the situation.  I took out my motor (2000cc FI) to fix some oil
seals and repair my leaky gas tank.  Fixed my seals and the tank and got
everything back in and hooked up.  The only connection I am unsure of is the
coil.  From what I can tell is there is four thin wires that hook up to it
(not including the fat one that goes to the distributor).  One of the thin
wires is green and it comes from the distributor.  Then there is a black
wire coming from the driverside from the back up fuse.  There is another
black one(18) coming from the heater blower area and finally the white one
(17) is from the &quot;brain&quot; plug.  The way I have it hooked up is the black one
from the driverside is hooked to the (+) side and the other three are hooked
to the (-) side.  Does that sound right?  When I went back to look at it the
green  wire looked a little bubbley like it was getting hot but it didn't
feel hot to me.  So what do you think?
   Could it be that it is hooked up fine and it won't start because the gas
hasn't worked its way through yet.  Before I took the engine out it ran
perfect and started almost instantly.  

Please reply to me personally because I am not on the list right now Thanks!!!!!
