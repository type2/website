Joel:

&lt;&lt;... you stick the wires into the holes until they go
past the resistance. THEN you can pull the radio out. the wires release
some sort of &quot;catch&quot; in there, and it's a royal bitch to get the thing
out any other way (i did it, but had to damn near dis-assemble my dash,
glovebox, heater panel, etc) to do it. THEN i found out about the wires!
&gt;&gt;

You forgot the last step:  HFWPOH...hit forehead with palm of hand.
Have I ever told you how much I hate that stupid coded radio?  Of course
the PO had NO idea what all code had been put into it, so
when it came time to put in a new battery I also  ended up swapping mine
for a reman at the dealers.  Of course, it wasn't an even swap, there was
also some money exchanged. &lt;G&gt;
