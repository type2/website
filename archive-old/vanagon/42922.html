Same here.  An '82 diesel just a couple of months ago.(It's back on the road)

        I had just puled into a parking lot and shut off the engine when the
first thing I noticed was smoke from under the dash (to be explaned).  While
riping fuses out(step one for controlling what I belived to be a small
electrical fire), I saw smoke coming from the engine vents.  While removing
the deck plate (engine cover? what is that thing called anyways?) the
starter started turning and started the engine.  Removing the deck I was
greeted by real 'honest to god' flames.
        At this point the first thing I did (I know, i've already done a
first thing, this is the secong first thing) was to grab a pair of wire
cutters (it helps to have an organized tool box, which mine wasn't after
looking for the wire cutters) and cut the wire (yes, reaching through the
flames to do this) going to the starter booster solinoid (don't have a
starter booster solinoid? good for you).  This stoped the starter but not
the engine.(oh, it's important to understand that I parked in netural)  To
stop the engine I cut the single wire leading to the top of the fuel
injector pump ( all this time fuel was spurting into the fire via. burnt
fuel return lines).
        To putt out the actual fire I ran into a restruant (they are
required by law to have an fire extinguisher accessable) and grabed thier
fire extinguisher (I did ask if I could use it first, but I didn't wait for
them to answer, remember, FIRE!)and put out the fire.  about three minunits
the fire dept. got there, if I had waited for them the van would have ben a
total loss, as it was, my father and I were able to limp it home apx. five
hours (and a lot of work) later.

        What I Belive caused the fire.

        The cold start cable contacted the fuseable link that is mounted on
the foreward engine bulkhead.  This allowed a dead short from the battery
through the cold start cable to the injector pump and the dash untill the
cable melted at both ends the other troubles (engine starting and not
turning off, ect.) were caused by shorts caused by the melting of various
wireing harnesses.
        
        I now use a push switch to energize a relay for the glow plugs, and
I cary a fire extinguisher.  I hope this will help someone avoid a loss.
