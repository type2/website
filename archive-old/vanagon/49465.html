Subject: Rear Heater Leaking on '85 GL

My temporary fix on the halves of the valve for the rear heater apparently
has finally reached its limit.  I've been noticing coolant loss from the
refill tank for a couple of weeks and now I know where it's going to--the
underside of the cork floorboard inlay around the rear heater is damp and
sticky.

Are parts available for this heater--I don't think the core itself is
leaking, but I'm pretty sure the valve is.  VW gave me a price last year of
$160 something for the whole heater, as if that was the only replacement
available.

If that's the case, has anyone just tried disconnecting the rear heater from
the cooling system entirely by just joining the two hoses either inside the
car, or finding couplings to replace the &quot;t&quot; fittings for the lines that run
to the front heater.  If this is a good idea, what are the dimensions of the
inside of the hose so I can find the correct size fittings.

Atlanta's pretty warm in the winter, I question the need for the rear heater
at all.  I rarely carry passengers in the van.

Thanks,

Donald Baxter
