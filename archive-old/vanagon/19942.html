Subject: '64 pickup FS

&gt;VOLKSWAGEN 1964 pickup, completely restored, $3000.  If &gt;interested, call 
&gt;(505) 821-7765.

&gt;JKH--Alburquerque, NM

&gt;p.s.  Shouldn't that be compleatly restored? ;-)

I looked at this pickup last weekend.  Mechanically it seems to be in very
good shape.  The interior has been nicely done.  The bodywork and paint are
extremely mediocre at best though, but it is still a pretty cool vehicle at
that price.
