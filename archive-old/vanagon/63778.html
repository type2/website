I just bought a 1988 Double Cab Syncro Transporter with 133,000 km on
it, no rust and the wood is still in the bed.  There are a few
customizations done to it but I'm not complaining.  There is one odd
thing about it, and that is the VW 16&quot; wheels on it.  There is 225/50
16 rubber on these wheels.  From what I understand there is a 16&quot;
version of the transporter.  How do I tell if this is it or not?  It
is not a Tri-Star, but it does have the plastic covered bumpers.  Any
thoughts here?

Thanks
