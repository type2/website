Again, the dates are June 14-16.  Originally I proposed the area
where we last camped, near Peppermint, north and east of Lake
Isabella, and this location is still fine by me.  A few of you
have suggested considering alternate sites, for various reasons.
Please let me know of your ideas/votes, and I'll keep track, tally
them, and let you all know.

For culinary karma (carma? :), Jack Stafford has suggested an
Italian theme.  More on that later...
