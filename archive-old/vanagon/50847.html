Subject: Pavneets ?  / 1.9l wiring


This is in response to a question from another Canuck on broken wire on a
connector coming off the big air intake hose.  I could only trace the wire
back to drivers side front corner of engine compartment, then it heads under
the van towards...(FI-CPU)?   I think it's the aux. air regulator, to aid
cold startup running.  bye, tim
