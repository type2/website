Subject: more on pfeiffer



As some of you have pointed out, I haven't said much about the food/potluck
thing for this coming weekend's trip to Pfeiffer.  Since some (see list below)
are up in the air, it seems problematical to have people sign up (or be assigned
to) special dishes, so my idea is that it would be good for you all to bring
appetizer/finger-type foods to share as much as possible (I can just see it
now:  9 bags of tortilla chips  :).  I know that you all know to byob.  (While
we're on that subject, please also bring, in order of importance:  firewood,
cool stuff to burn, lawn chairs, ice).  

Al Knoll is bringing some more of his famous fabulous chili for Saturday
nite, so if you have mex-type stuff that would compliment it, throw it in.  I'll
bring/make some cornbread.  I'll also bring stuff for breakfast (including
&quot;good&quot; coffee), but I may try to recruit one of the early risers to cook
stuff in the a.m. both days.  Volunteers?  :)

I'll make some sort of entree and probably some sort of starchy accompaniment
for Friday evening, since I plan to be in Pfeiffer early on, on Friday.  If
anyone can do a salad, vegetables, or fruit, that would be great.  Dessert
munchies welcome.

Lunch is do-yer-own.

Some have asked about reservations.  If you feel more comfortable, pleast feel
free to make them (Mixtix).  Many of us did so last year at the inaugural trip,
but in retrospect it seems unnecessary, as there was hardly anyone else in
the park last January (though this may have been due to the nasty weather
at the time).  Personally, I'm going to take my chances.

Directions: (vauge, sorry).  Pfeiffer/Big Sur is not particularly near any
other city, other than several other camping places, many of which, confusingly,
also have the name Pfeiffer in them.  Do NOT go to Pfeiffer/Burns - we are
at Pfeiffer/Big Sur, which, in my recollection is a state park.  It's on
Highway One, about 29 miles south of Carmel, on the east side of the highway.
At least last year, and I assume still, there are showers there.  They run
on quarters.  Bring LOTS.  The toilets are real.  The AC was &quot;iffy&quot; last year,
probably from the storm, and in any case, it's not available per site.  Water
in the bathrooms if I remember, and possibly a few other strategic locations.

When you drive in, especially if you come at nite, just follow the 5,000+
degree fahrnheit glow in the campground, you'll find us.  We like places of
to ourselves at the end - you'll find us.  You can also listen for exploding
cans of beans, bottle rockets, roman candles, and general obnoxious behavior.  :)
