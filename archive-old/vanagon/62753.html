Subject: 83 Fuel Injection fixed (I think):TY

Hey-

That pesky 02 sensor again!

Thanks to all the advice on my fuel injection problems on my 83.5 Westy. I
disconnected the 02 sensor and the ilde was less rough.And the surging at
idle stopped altogether. So I replaced the 02 sensor with the bosch unit and
set the timing. And, well it runs pretty darn well. Not quite 100%. But I'll
replace the spark plugs, cap, rotor, and wires, because I don't know when it
was done last. And the plugs were pretty carbon fouled. Not only from the
faulty 02 sensor, but I had a vacuum leak at the throttle body. 

I also found the fuel injector at cylinder #3 was loose. So I replaced the
mounting gaskets at all the injectors, and those seals. (the seals were dry
and not replaced when the new long block was put in just before I purchased
it. The DPO was more-than-willing to cut corners on the installation.) And I
replaced all the dry vacuum line hoses.

Oh here's a question: Do I have to do anything with the electronic ignition
since there are no points to gap? 

Incidentally while I had the injectors out I figured I check them for that
&quot;cone-shaped&quot; flow talked about in Bentleys. Because I didn't have a
stop-action camera I just decided to let it go at the fact that fuel was
coming out of each one. I mean c'mon. Is it me? That fuel squirts out so fast
and is basically clear--and well it could have spelled out the answers to all
of life's question and I'd still be in the dark today. (Which I am.)

Now we'll tackle the state emissions inspection part of the journey.

So thanks again for the help and support. I thought I'd be camping. But
instead I'm learning. Ain't life funny?
