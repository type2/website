Subject: Re- Gotta sneak this in!!!

Ric responded to Cetin with:

&gt;I had them check the brakes, shocks, replace the clips that hold
&gt;the trip pieces to the jump seats. They also did the &quot;free&quot; oil
&gt;change.

A couple of quick questions Ric; are those clips you mention the ones
that go on the &quot;triangular&quot; plastic pieces that cover the lower outside
portion of the rear-facing folding seats on the regular MV (non-Weekender)?

Also, how &quot;free&quot; are those oil changes?  I'd rather do my own, but if they're
footin' the bill for that filter, weellll, maybe I'll let them do it...
And how long are they &quot;free&quot; for?  2 years/24000 miles?
