Hello,

As has been mentioned before, the spring compressor is holding back a lot 
of energy, so be careful and deliberate.  However, you can do this job 
yourself.

Before you rent a spring compressor, inspect it.  If it doesn't look as if 
it can do the job, don't rent it.  Go elsewhere.  Also consider buying one. 
 The last time I did this type of work (10 years ago already?), it cost $25 
to rent one for a day.  JCWhitney had one for 1/2 of that and it was quite 
strong and safe.

Mike
