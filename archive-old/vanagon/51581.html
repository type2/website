Subject: Re: Westy year-to-year changes?


Just a couple comments/corrections to Jon's list of Westy layouts:

&gt;'68-'72 Gold Vinyl camper upholstery
&gt;	ice box no sink behind passenger seat -'71
&gt;	ice box/sink passenger side '72 + '73

'71 did have a sink behind the passenger seat.
&gt;
&gt;	'73 only Gold/Butterscotch Burlap type cloth camper upholstery
&gt;
&gt;	'74-'76 started with color co-ordinated plaids
&gt;		Deluxe campers had Fridge/stove beind pass seat with 
&gt;		sink/storage behind driver
&gt;	Non-Deluxe had icebox instead of fridge, and no stove..

This is '74-75 layout only (not '76).  Deluxe had fridge, stove, propane 
setup, city water hookup, second battery with charger, and (in '75) an 
additional seat on side wall next to sink cabinet.  
&gt;
&gt;	'77-'79 had camper console along wall behind driver
&gt;
&gt;	Deluxe had fridge and propane stove..and sink
&gt;	Non-Deluxe had icebox and sink ...

This was '76-79, not 77-79.  Deluxe also included city water hookup, 
propane, 2nd battery with charger, center jumpseat/storage box, 
dash-mounted table. Nicest layout, in my opinion.

&gt;	all years after '74 had somewhat color co-ordinated plaid camper
&gt;upholstery...

Also all years from '74 on had the new poptop style, which opened in toward 
the front and had a full-sized double bed up top instead of just a cot.
