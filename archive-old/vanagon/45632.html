Subject: reliable service in Ottawa, Ont?

Can anyone recommend a reliable garage or dealer/service place in Ottawa, Ont.  Any 
guesses on what replacement of an idle air stabilizer valve should cost (the idle is 
low and unstable on our '90 Westfalia (71,000km) and that what I've been told the 
cure is (I'm a bit skeptical).  E-mail if possible, please - I just subscribed to the 
newsgroup.  Thanks.  Neil Mitchell.
