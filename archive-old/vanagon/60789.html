Subject: Eurovan vs Vanagon

I am posting this just to tell Vanagon owners that they are not missing any
thing by not having a Eurovan.

I had 2 vanagons, a 87 syncro and a 82 diesel (converted to gas). Both were
lots of fun but had the well known typical problems. I went through the tire
thing and the head gasket thing and the engine stutter, stumble thing, and
the syncro drive shaft thing. All were fixed after a while.

Now I have a Eurovan. Hey, they have the tire thing to be worked out. And
they have the piston slap engine thing problem. You know how on Vanagons one
minor problem leads to another then to a larger one? Had this rumbling noise
in front the the EV. First did wheel bearings now CV joint and next month
maybe ball joints. 

t seems that where ever you go, there you are. Some things don't change.
Eurovans are much the same as Vanagons. I love them both. Gives me things to
do with my spare time and money. Does anyone have any spare time or money to
lend me?
