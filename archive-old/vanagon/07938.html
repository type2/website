&gt; I wish it snowed here.  You are making me feel hard-done-by.  
&gt; I'd love to experience the kinds of drive you mentioned below.
Well, I'd sure love to give you just a bit of it.  Seems we got plenty 
right outside.  The experience, actually, is quite scary.  Once this
begins to happen, it is such a neat thing that you really want it to happen.
But, the realization of what is happening pulls you away from it a bit.
The truth is that after some time (maybe 15 min or so) you'll have some
type of lasting effects from it too, I believe.

I believe it is extremely dangerous which is why I posted about it.
Crazy!  How can such a neat sensation also be so dangerous?  But it is.
