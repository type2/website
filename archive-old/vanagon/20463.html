&gt;I am in the process of removing the interior panels from my vanagon in order
&gt;to redo the wallpaper which was peeling.  Now that I have the back door hatch
&gt;completely bare, I think I should ask:  has anyone installed a device there
&gt;which makes it possible to open the rear hatch from the inside?

i gave this a lot of thought years back, and finally just decided it wasn't
worth the risk of the rear hatch flying open when some kid triggered the
device and falling out on his head in the parking lot (i DON'T drive with
kids in the rear!!). :) or some piece of luggage bumping against the device
and causing the luggage to fall out on the highway.

i still think it would be kinda neat to be able to do that, but i haven't
been able to come up with sufficient reasons for ME to NEED to do it.
your mileage may vary. :)
