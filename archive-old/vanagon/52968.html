&gt; 
&gt; I guess the bottom line is: What magic spirit do I use to un-seize the engine?

Remove all spark plugs and try to turn it again. You can try to turn forward or
backward to see if it is indeed seized. If it doesn't turn still then you might
need to remove head caps and remove all rockers. Then all valves will rest on
their seats. Try to turn it again. If it still doesn't turn then you have real 
serious problem. I don't think your engine would have such problem though.
