&gt;Subject:     VWs for sale!
&gt;'87 Westfalia, 4-speed, a/c, cruise, fresh rebuilt engine, refrigerator,
&gt;port stove [?], sleeps 4, $9500.  717-394-6553 (I have no idea what this
&gt;area code is.  Anyone?)

This is in Lancaster, PA. The seller is Jane Snyder, who seems to sell a 
lot of VWs, Westies in particular. I got mine from her and I've been very 
happy. I've seen others she had for sale and was not as impressed. If 
this is the one I saw, it was silver with some weird paint repairs and a 
gouge all along the passenger side of the car halfway up the windows (the 
windows are somewhat scratched). 
BTW, the 717 area code stretches forn the bottom of PA to the top, so it 
covers a pretty wid area.
