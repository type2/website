&gt;The instructions that I got from a VW expert were as follows:
&gt;Lift the BACK end of the van as high as possible.
&gt;Rev the engine to over 2000rpm and keep topping up the expansion tank =

I don't believe it!  This makes a low point in the system by the spare =
tire,
high point 3 feet up at rad/heater core.  No way is the pump pushing =
enough
water to blast any air lock at the top of the rad down 3 feet and out.
Raising the front puts all the piping pointing uphill from the engine, =
with
bleed screw at highest point. No traps for the air.  Tim Smith

Naturally, you must also bleed the radiator also, and maybe I should =
have said that. However, I can guarantee that this method of lifting the =
BACK end works. I got the tip originally from an authorised VW =
workshop!!
