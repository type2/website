Subject: Berg quick shift kit

I just got my Berg quick shift in the mail, and while examining it have a
couple of questions that I'm hoping that someone can help me with. 

First off, let me say that at first look, the quality is supurb. The
instructions even have photographs! What a concept. Well, this must have
lulled me into a false sence of security when I actually tried to follow
them.

The instructions say to slip the supplied metal ring down the shift lever to
use as a guide to drill a hole. Surprize one. The ring has such a tight fit
that it will not go past the bend in the shifter. Surprize two - the
instructions state that you can install it without removing the shifter from
the car - yet at one point in the instructions they have you slip the ring up
from the end of the shifter. Hmm, now how do they figure I can do that
without taking the shifter out of the car??

Anyway, has anyone installed this who is willing to offer the benefit of
their experience?

BTW: I got the shifter extension which for me (I have a 37&quot; sleve lenght)
makes the shift knob go from too far to too close - but it does make shifting
quite humorous having the shift knob almost as high as the top of the dash.
