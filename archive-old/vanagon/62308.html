I just have to put in my 2 cents!!! I have never, that's NEVER, seen an
owner (or anyone else, for that matter) respond to a car alarm. They seem
to be nothing but a source of irritation for the people who live near
where the vehicle is parked. My latest experience was with a mini-pickup
that owner liked to park as far away from his unit as he could so he
wouldn't be bothered by his stupid alarm playing seven different sounds!!
When we threatened to dismantle his whole truck be decided to move. I've
found the best way to minimize theft loss is to leave as little valuable
stuff as possible in the van. And as seen on Sixty Minutes, even with the
alarm blasting and people standing by, the thief goes about his business
of removing what he wants.
