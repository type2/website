&gt;        IE: r85/185/14 is a very tall 185mm wide tire on a 14&quot; wheel 
&gt;            r55/205/16 is a very low profile 205mm wide tire on a 16&quot; wheel
&gt;        NOTE: Both would be about the same outside diameter?
&gt;
&gt;What do I know?

Acurate except width is actually with of tire, not tread area.  Other points
to consider is the speed rating.  Often included in tire size.  Tires now
have another rating system the indicates spped and load.  Look for 97R on
original MXLs.  If you go witha standard 215-70, the load rating is a 96?
depending on speed rating.  Very close. Thnis is what I use and recomend.  I
been using Bridgestone HP-41 Potenzas for about 60K.  They survived the
Alaska Hiway and Prudhoe Bay with no flats.  This tires also worked well in
the snow.  This tire works so well and last so long that it is discontinued
now.  Oh well.
Now looking at Yokahama A-378.  Also considereng Goodyear Aquatread, GSA, or
GSA Aquatread.  Last two being considered for the syncro.
