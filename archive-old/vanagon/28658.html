Subject: Re: Aluminum Bodies

&gt;But the exterior panels don't perforate!   So.....  can we get the Mexican
&gt;VW plant to stamp us some ALL aluminium loafs?? &lt;g&gt;   Tim Smith
        Ok, you guys got me going on this one. Don't think the Mexican idea
will work, but could we replace some components ourselves? Cost?
Reliability? This should keep the thread alive for a while...

Peace,
