Subject: Lights Out On VW Design Radio

     Hi All,
     
     The light behind the fader and first two preset buttons on my VW 
     Design (original equipment) AM/FM/Cassette radio no longer light up 
     when the headlights are on. Does this indicate a loose connection or 
     that it's time for a new radio? Are there replaceable light bulbs in a 
     VW Design radio?
     
     TIA,
