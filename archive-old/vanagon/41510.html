Dennis,
I too am planning to do the wheel bearings in the near future. If you reply 
individually, would you send me a copy?
thanks,

|&gt;  I have to may have to replace the front wheel bearings on my 86' syncro.
|&gt;I have some play in the wheel tire assembly when unweighted.  Checked for
|&gt;loose nuts and balljoints. The play seems to be in the bearings.  I would
|&gt;like to know of a good source for wheel bearings.  I would prefer not to 
use
|&gt;the dealer for obvious reasons.
|
|I can get aftermarket bearings.  I will get numbers and prices back to you 
by
|Wednesday.
