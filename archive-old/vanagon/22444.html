Subject: Found old NSU Prinz info

Someone was asking for info on the NSU vehicles. I don't remember if it was
this list or who was asking. Please contact me regarding a road test of a
NSU Prinz 4 Dauphine Deluxe from Foreign Car Guide (featuring Volkswagen),
March, 1962. Will look for older (1960) article when I get time.
