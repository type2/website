A bad idea. If you can't get it off with a ten foot cheater your just going
to make a mess of things with this technique.

&gt;If that fails, using the chisel to
&gt;help rotation with the &quot;blue wrench&quot; (torch) and the now familiar cheater
&gt;bar offer the normal options.

Not so fast. How are you going to get a socket on the nut you have just
beat to shit with a mallet and chisel?

&gt;
&gt;  Compared with the stuff he considers big, this isn't, so dealing with
&gt;this kind of effort is a regular event for him.
&gt;

Just 'cause he uses this technique on LARGE nuts doesn't make it an aproved
method. Nor does doing it on a regular basis. If big means 'complicated'
pounding it off with a chisel (the wrong tool) is only cool if you work for
the government ;-)
