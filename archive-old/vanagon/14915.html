&gt; 
&gt; OK, How about something like this, frankly we the easterners seem
&gt; divided, most 5-10 posts seem to want a central or southern leg
&gt; although a around 5 want a northern leg, how about a route that
&gt; consolidates both in the beginning then we split, I envision something
&gt; like this,
&gt; 
&gt; START St. Louis, Missouri, May 29 or whatever, everyone takes most
&gt; direct route there with as much caravaning as possible along the way,
&gt; the northeast all comes down onto I70 for instance, the mideast over
&gt; on US50, I64, or I40, and the southeast up on I75, I24 or whatever, we try
&gt; to pick people up on the way, so that each incoming route has 3 or 4
&gt; buses together by the time we hit St. Louis.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;From St. Louis we all take US50 out, this is the origional coast to
&gt; coast road, hell books are written about its attractions, some of the
&gt; best 2 lane blacktop (OK 4 lane a lot of it) left in the US, speed limit
&gt; is 55 so we don't feel pushed, we hit a stop on 50, all easterners
&gt; together until we get to Winchester, VA, I note that last leg through
&gt; WV, MA, and VA should prove an interesting test for all VW transporters,
&gt; some pretty rough but beautiful mountain driving.
&gt; 
&gt; At Winchester we all pick up I81 down to I66 and start heading east,
&gt; when we hit the top of Skyline Drive the southern tour splits off down
&gt; the drive through Shenandoah Natl Park (beautiful) the northern tour
&gt; keeps on to DC, then heads up the coast to Cape Cod, Maine, wherever, as
&gt; I plan to go south I don't know.
&gt; 
&gt; The southern tour proceeds down Skyline all the way through the park to
&gt; I64 which we take through Charlottesville and Richmond all the way to
&gt; Newport News, through the Fort Monroe Tunnel and onto 168 through
&gt; Chesapeake then into NC.  Down to Point Harbor, across to Kitty Hawk
&gt; then down the Outer Banks, around Cape Hatteras, and culminating in the
&gt; ferry ride back to Swan Quarter. From here 264 back to I95 then everyone
&gt; finds their best way home.
&gt; 
&gt; I am very interested and would help plan the trek on 50 and down Skyline
&gt; but have never been to the Outer Banks and someone else would have to
&gt; figure out those parts, of course people going north would need to
&gt; figure their own plans but most importantly I think we should keep it
&gt; all together, easterners united for a least a day or two out of St.
&gt; Louis, as always, lets hear some feedback, anyone interested in the
&gt; proposed route?, better suggestions are welcome, bring an extra engine,
&gt; them mountains can be killers.

Looks like your plan does not bring you to the Big Apple (NYC)and Broadway.
Should you change your mind, there is a Mariner across the Hudson River
in Jersey City that accomodates RVs and campers. If expensive accomodation
was deterring you besides other things,you may want to consider it.
I believe the grounds are charging $35.00 per day for the big rigs
which has electric hookups ,shower and laundry facilities. The PATH
subway takes you right into the heart of the City for a dollar in only
a few minutes. The place has 24hours security patrol.
