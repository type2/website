On this topic, my graduation gift was a '78 bug vert.  

I call it the gift that keeps on taking:-)

My dad and I went to look at it and liked it.  He said he called a few days
later and it was gone.  

Came back from school, there on the lawn, with a big red ribbon around
it, was a black '78 bug with a white top.   Beautiful!

I was never into VWs before that.

Next I bought a Thing, and then the Tardis ('66 bus).  Now I've gat all three,
and can only afford (time&amp;money) to work on one at a time &lt;grimace&gt;.
