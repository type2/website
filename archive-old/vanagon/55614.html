Subject: Temp fluctuation solved by new thermostat
Date: Thu, 6 Feb 1997 18:07:01 -0000

A new thermostat turned out to be the exact solution for my fluctuating
temperature readings.

Now the temperature quickly settles to one needle's width right of centre.
I wonder if renewing the temp sensor would make it read exactly centre -
hardly worth it I suppose.

I also renewed the radiator fan switch, but I suppose it wouldn't come into
play until the summer.
