I have to admit doing this twice (so far!). First time was years
ago parking my old '62 Vauxhall Envoy at my girlfriend's house. The road
had  a very slight grade and I guess I didn't pull on the handbrake hard
enough because after about 5 minutes we get a call from a neighbour 2
houses down asking if we knew who's car was in their garden. No damage
except for some shrubs.

The second time was only a few years later. I had borrowed a Datsun pickup
to get some building supplies. I parked the truck in the &quot;mall&quot; parking
lot and went in to the store. When I came out I couldn't find the car, oh
no, its been stolen. So I'm standing where I thought the car should be,
getting pissed-off when I espy the little bugger across the lot at the low
point of the tarmac. I had to have threaded its way through the other
parked cars, lamp posts and carts. No damage again.
