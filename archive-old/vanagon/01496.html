 Hi,

&gt; &gt; My problem now is that _I_ can't open the door from the
&gt; &gt; inside, with or without a key.  Anyone have an idea how
&gt; &gt; easy it might be to get a replacement door handle?
&gt; 
&gt; Well, if it makes you feel any better, mine will not unlock from
&gt; the inside either.  Even though it seems to have a little lever there
&gt; for it.  Taking that inner handle/latch assembly apart has been on my
&gt; long-term list of things to do for a while now.  

 Aha! Sounds like there's some misconceptions about. I'll try &amp; help.
All corrections welcome: If I post crap I'd like to know about it :-) !

 The way the early breadloaf sliding door locks work is this:

 When unlocked you move the lever down to open (easy)
 To lock from the outside, turn the key (easy)
 To lock from the inside, turn the handle the other way, it will swing about
60-90 degrees and then go &lt;click&gt;. let it return to it's normal position and
you can now flick the wee lever round to lock the door.
 Flick the lever back to unlock.

 The two locking mechanisms are independent. You can use either, or both,
and so you may be able to open the door from either side or neither. If both
are on you need to undo the lever and turn the key before it will open.

 At some later time (I thought '72/3 but it may have been much later, or have
varied from place to place) the lock cylinder was moved from the handle to
the door. At this point it lines up with, and operates, the internal mechanism
so you now have only one locking mechanism and can operate it from inside or
out.

 If anyone has a sliding door with the locking cylinder seperate from the
handle but which still has two locking mechanisms, then I'm wrong, or they have
a non-standard arrangement, I wouldn't like to speculate on which is more
likely :-).

Cheers,
        W.
