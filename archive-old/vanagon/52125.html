Subject: oil filler revisited

Hi again,

Sean brought this up at the beginning of the month, the fact that the
oil filler extends so you can pour in oil easily.  I've been aware of
this since I bought the van.  However, at some point in the last 3
months or so, it has become stuck.  There is no way to pull it out.  I'm
not sure exactly what happened (maybe an uninformed mechanic tried to
'help' and glued it down thinking it was broken?  or worse, actually
took the inside/extending section out altogeth?).  Any ideas out there
on loosening it up?  We've tried twisting, yanking and combinations of
both. 

Thanks
Tonya
