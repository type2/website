&gt;&gt; physically challanged people.
&gt;&gt; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; My, how PC.  Who am I to buck this ever-so-benificent trend?
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Guess I'll need to refer to my '71 loaf, with its questionable 1600
&gt;&gt; engine, as &quot;motivationally challenged&quot;?
&gt;&gt; Heater doesn't work, either... &quot;climactically challenged&quot;?
&gt;&gt; Steering's pretty loose, too... &quot;directionally unimpaired&quot;?
&gt;&gt; Some rock dings in the windshield... &quot;panoramically compromised&quot;?&gt;
&gt;&gt; Anyone else?
&gt;
&gt;sure, I'll have a go...
&gt;how about if we refer to those who have a problem with &quot;the PC BS&quot; as
&gt;&quot;compassion compromised&quot;?
&gt;dave &quot;mean spirited humor intolerant&quot;

Feel free!

But &quot;irrelevance cognizant&quot; is probably more accurate.
