Subject: 87 synchro problem

My 87 synchro periodically will develop hesitation in the engine after
running for 20-30 minutes at highway speeds (3600-3800 rpms). It doesn't do
it all the time . If I stop for 10 minutes or so and then resume the voyage
everything is fine for 20 minutes or so then the same thing happens or it
runs perfectly for hours! It is driving me crazy! Seems to do it only in
weather 50 degrees or less.  Anybody gotta clue about this?

Thanks
