Subject: To the good and understandable guys.

Hello my friends! Several days ago I answered a message from a young person
that is studying at St. Louis University and is far from his family here in
Puerto Rico. He wanted for me to communicate with him in Spanish because it
is easier for him. We didn't want to offend anybody in the list with our way
of communicating. I studied in Europe for many years and I understand what is
to be far from my homeland and my family. So, please be patient with the non-
english speaking people.
The most important of this is that we love Volkswagens and we consider this
hobby as a way of reunite people from many places of the world. Remember John
Lennon's song &quot;Imagine&quot; that's the way we should let it be. If you guys have
ever the chance to visit Puerto Rico this month, you could enjoy the 3rd Bug-
In in Caguas and the VolkyMania festival in Carolina. 
Special thanks to Gary Gibson for his words of wisdom. Talk to you later.
