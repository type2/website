&gt; As far as the repair shop telling you to let the gaskets go until they blow,

&gt; bill.  Also, you won't be able to predict where you are when they blow, and
&gt; you could dump all of your coolant in a big hurry, which would leave you with
&gt; a BIG tow bill (if you don't burn up your engine before you can pull over).
&gt;  I think you'd be better off getting the head gaskets replaced as soon as
&gt; possible, then keep your coolant changed at regular intervals, and save up

I would agree with fixing rather than waiting for the gaskets to blow.
Granted, not all engines are the same, but we had a 63 Buick with a V-6
(cast iron, not alluminum) that, when it blew a head gasket, the increased
pressure of coolant leaking into one of the cylinders while it was running
at freeway speed literally pounded a hole through a piston.  Even if that
didn't happen in the Vanagon, I'd be worried about the hammering of the Rod
bearing by this increase in pressure (if the leak is INTO the cylinder,
that is).
