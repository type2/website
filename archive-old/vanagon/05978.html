&gt;I received the first issue of funkengrooving yesterday, and I like
&gt;it! It also has an article in it from Ric! (About his trip to Wolfsburg.)

them lawyers will do ANYTHING to get their names in print!!!! :)

&gt; Is the vanagon list they have the same as this one?
&gt;List:
&gt;vanagon-list%cherise_at_wb3ffv.ampr_dot_org
&gt;listserv:
&gt;mail-server%cherise_at_wb3ffv.ampr_dot_org?

that was the 'old' list. the guy that was running it got involved in some
large project, and the list kinda just died ... so gerry (with a little
gentle prodding! :)  started this list. that was back in ... February? March?
