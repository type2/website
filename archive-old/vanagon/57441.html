Subject: Spring has sprung and so has the rust.

        Well all the snow is finally slowly disappearing, and van washes are
becoming more and more frequent. With the last couple washes Ive done, the
sight of the small rust spots on the hook-up side of my 83' Vanagon are
really starting to bug me. So, I was wondering if anyone could either point
me to, or inform me of the process of prepping, protecting, and repainting
all those hidious little metal malformities.
        All the spots seem to be occuring on the bottom panel - drivers side
below my water/power hook ups. Is this a common place to get rust? Anyone
else have a similar problem?
        
danka.
