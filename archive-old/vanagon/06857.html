Hello vanagon gang &amp; ric,
It seems that there is definately a real problem here with starter bendix
drives. (Someone said don't let them get cold.  I passed on that one, per
ric).  It seems that one simply can not obtain only the starter bendix
for the starter engines for 1982 diesel engines.  Rumor has it that this
applies also to air cooled bugs.

There must be a solution to this problem!  I mean, really, to buy a new or
rebuilt starter is not, in my opinion, a solution.  Wonder about the chances
of using the bendix designed for another vehicle?  I simply can't believe
that anyone would sincerely look at me and tell me that I can't put a bendix
on one of these motors!  It seems like vw has run amok!

Anyway, someone must have found a way to get these things somewhere.  Other-
wise, I wouldn't be the first to notice this. Wonder if you can get them only
in  Germany?  As a note, the bendix from an aircooled is not usable.  The
shaft is too short to work on a diesel.
Could someone look through their exotic catalogues and see if anyone advertises
these drives?  Thanks!
Stuart Hutton
