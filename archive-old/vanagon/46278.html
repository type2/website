Subject: brake job status

Thanks to all who've replied with assistance.  Apparently, a couple of 
you misinterpreted my last post regarding the order of operations as my 
conception of the entire brake job.  I was just trying to clarify the 
order of a few procedures.  However, as a result, I received some nice 
detailed descriptions of how to proceed.

I've received one offer of assistance in the DC area, but I would like to 
ask again if anyone in NC who has done brake work would be willing to 
help me through a rear brake job (as I do the work).  Thanks.

david
