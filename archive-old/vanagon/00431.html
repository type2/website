Subject: Re: battery tray replacement ...

&gt; 
&gt; I repaired the rusted out battery tray on my '72 bus once with a piece of
&gt; wood I found on the side of the road. The battery was about to fall out on
&gt; the ground and it was at a 45 degree angle when I first noticed it was in
&gt; distress. The wood never deteriorated and I drove the bus around like that
&gt; fine for another 5 years.
&gt;

My '71 Westfalia has the same feature!  Only the piece of wood was
obviously very old, and starting to fall through the hole too, so I got
a nice piece of exterior grade 1/2&quot; plywood, made the appropriate cutouts,
set it on top of the old piece, and now have a stable base for my brand
new battery!
