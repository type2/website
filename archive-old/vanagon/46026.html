Subject: Re: LHS Shower in Westie?

&gt;design well.  We need a shower stall with curtains and plumbing.
&gt;A one or two circuit aluminun &quot;cold plate&quot; pretty nearly completes my 
&gt;non-obvious required materials list.  Some of you already know from this 

Hang a cheap shower curtain, $2.99, on a hoola-hoop, $1.99.  Hang the 
hoola-hoop from the open rear hatch using a couple of hooks made from a 
coathanger.  Step into the shower from the Westy bed, hey an ensuite, how 
about that! Bit of Astro turf completes this luxurious 'bano al fresco', or 
stand in a bucket if graywater runoff is a problem. If your travelling 
companion has a wicked sense of humour you may wish to hide the carkeys 
before entering the shower.
        A solar shower heater hung onto the roof completes the basic 
bathroom plan.

        As far as really heating the water there is a posting/pix of the 
water tank with a neat heating coil loop using engine coolant to warm the 
tank water. Splice it off your rear heater with valves to direct heat flow.  
Maybe even add a tank thermostat and solenoid valve to control temp 
automatically. Just install a rear mount hand shower + switch like in the 
new Winnebago/EV/Westy, or like the Oz Trakka conversions.  Trakka say 
idling for 20 mins. gives ample hot water 70litres.  Wouldn't want any 
coolant in my drinking water however.  
        Bonus: for winter camping get that tank of water scalding hot while 
driving, then flow it back through the rear heater with fan on low for heat 
retrieval when camped.
