Subject: Re: Points keep breaking!!!

...did you put a dab of points lube behind that thing that rides on the
distributor shaft ? you may wanna consider a slightly less dramatic upgrade,
like putting in a contact-free ignition, like the PERTRONIX ignitor. it's
magnetically triggered and it's worked great for me so far...i think Bob
wrote a sermon about this a while back...

&gt;          Here we go again.  Yesterday after a day of
freeway driving
&gt;          going 65-70mph steady my points (Bosch) break where the filiment
&gt;          rides on the cam.  This is the second time now in a month or
&gt;          so...the first time was when I drove up to Monterey from LA
&gt;          again going at 65-70mph.  My '71 bus runs a fairly new stock
&gt;          distributor.
&gt;
&gt;          Has anyone else had this problem with Bosch?  Are there better
&gt;          quality points?  I'm thinking it's time to go CDI and get rid
&gt;          of the points altogether.
