Subject:      tires

demps-

If you can afford it (ditch the jetta?) then fur shur you should 4 new
tires, all the same.  Having different tires can signifigantly affect
safety (handling, braking, alignment, etc.).  Now if you're just
piddling around town short distances, I wouldn't worry too much about
it.  But definitely put those new gumballs on your short list.

Nothing to disclaim at this time.
