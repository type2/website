I now have the honor of having more canvas than sheet metal with my 78 =
westy.  I obtained over the weekend, the tent that fits on the rear of =
the bus.  The canvas is draped over the hatch and is attached to a board =
that clips to the back of the car.  Something kind of nerve wracking =
about taking a drill to the car!  This in addition to the side tent =
(still seeking correct poles!) and the pop top makes for a lot of canvas

come see it in st louis!
