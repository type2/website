scott have you tried jc whittney, i almost did this for my ice box when it 
got cracked. they used to have them. Though i ended up finding mine at a junk 
yard


Thanks Chris -

That's where I got the measurements from - the frame on my ice box measures 
17&quot;w x 21.25&quot;h and the one in JC Whitney says it requires a cut out 17.75&quot;w x 
20&quot;h (the frame is 19&quot;w x 21.25&quot;)
