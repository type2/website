&gt;   The paint above the beltline is original VW and is in good shape. I have 
&gt;   about $1000.00 to spend on this work. A June/July timeframe would work 
&gt;   Dave
&gt; 
By all means let Thom give it a go, but hell $1000 should get the
work done professionally and at fairly good quality in urethane at
that.
