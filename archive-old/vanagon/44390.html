Save the Sterling Mate!!!!

Wait for a nice one or offer a scrapman's price. I guarantee that you will
spend less in the long run and be much happier. Cutting the top off of a
coupe is like cutting the legs off of a dog. I like vintage VWs and dogs
with legs. Both have the tendancy to get down the road a bit nicer.
