Subject:  Wish us luck...


Well, as soon as I get out of work we're off on our first road trip in Spike,
my '74 type 2.  Anyone on the road between Rochester, NY and
Philedelphia, PA this evening should keep an eye out for an orange '74
with NH plates.  We'll be the ones that everyone is passing. :)  I'm a little
iffy about taking such a long trip since Spike and I don't know each other
too well yet, but I don't think we'll have any trouble.  (Famous last
words?)  I've got my John Muir type 1 tool kit, my tow ropes, my AAA
card, and plenty of gafftape.  Wish us luck...

BTW, did my front brake pads last night.  It was easier than my rabbit!

 - Tom
