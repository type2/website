&gt; I have a 1.7 liter engine that I am trying to mount an oil pressure

&gt; me.

I found that in order to get the oil pressure sender (VDO) to 
clear the tinware on my camper's 1800 type IV motor, I had to 
buy another brass extension/mount, exactly the same as the one 
which came with the kit, and screw them together. This doubled 
the clearance of the sender away from the block. There was a 
hole in the side of the bottom extension/mount where the original
oil pressure switch was meant to go (it is now on the top 
extension/mount) which I blocked with a trimmed down bolt.

I've had this setup for about four years (50000 km) and have had 
no problems.

Hope this helps, cheers.
