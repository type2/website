Subject: Re: Why VW's + T&amp;A?

I remember when i first started working on vw's and was looking for a 
good machine shop.  My dad gave me two shop names that he had used and i 
went searching for them.  One was clean and neat the people were not 
friendly though, but it looked like a good place.  The other was filthy 
with junk all over the place, and on every available spot on the wall 
were pin-up girls all in various stages of being clothed.  Much worse 
than I've seen in the vw rags.  The people were friendly though.  I 
choose the cleaner of the two shops, being at least more comfortable 
with the surroundings and figuring i could deal with their attitudes.  
Welll the eninge lasted 10,000 mi and quit due to their errors in 
measurements, and they later ruined a pair of heads owned by a friend 
of mine.  The next time i went to the dirier place and haven't had a 
bit a trouble since.  I've decided i don't care what they display or 
hang it's their shop or ad, as long as i get the quality i want.
