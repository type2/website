&gt; John,
&gt; 	Ask for the date of manufacture on those Continentals.  They 
&gt; could be ten years old.  There is a code on the sidewall.  I liked the 
&gt; Contis when they were still available.  See if they are really back.  
&gt; Gary Gibson
&gt; 
Gary reasonably makes this question, so in interest I call Tire
Rack once again (800)428-8355.  Indeed they say these are current
production reinforced Conti's, they just recieved 125 of them on
11/11/95, still have 111 in stock for immediate shipment.  Price
is now $54, went up $5 last night, DAMN.  Still has to be the budget
leader for VW Bus/Vanagon tires, and hell is likely the tire that came
on your Bus (nearly as common as the XZX's and MXL's I believe).
Anyway that price is right and will probably be the tire of choice for
the parents '77 Westy, I'm still going for a bit more agressive tread.
At this price it is stupid to install any regular tire, shipping is
usually on the order of $5 a tire to WV from South Bend.  I
strongly believe in this company and have bought my last 3 sets of tires
from them and then had them installed locally with a lifetime
balance/rotation plan from Sears, Montgy Wards, Tire America or whoever.
Though I will also note for a local alternative, my Sears said the could
get the XZX's for $65 each, when Tire Rack wants $67, go figure?
