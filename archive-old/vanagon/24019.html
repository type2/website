hey everyone,
	i remember someone posting a story where somewhere in their
travels they recieved a ticket for sleeping in their camper at a rest
stop.  i've never had any problems before, but my girlfriend and i are
going to be sleeping at at least one rest stop in washington this
weekend.  anyone have any bad experiences in that state?  

hope everyone gets at least one chance to sleep in their buses this
weekend on a wonderful trip with beautiful friends!!!!


take care,
	brandy
		(and his much loved '73 camper)
