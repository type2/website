Subject: 91 Westy in Hackensack, NJ
Date: Wed, 25 Sep 1996 17:14:16 -0500

	My wife and I have been on a two year search to replace our 78
Campmobile with a Westfalia.  I thought for sure we had found the
ultimate Westy in Hackensack.  The following report on this vehicle
comes from a very reliable source who knows what makes up a Westy and
has verified the existence and condition of the the 91 Westy in
Hackensack.
	The 91 Westy located in Hackensack, NJ with 3000 original miles is
indeed a 3000 mile vehicle. However, the case history should be noted
for those of you who might want to road trip to NJ for inspection and
purchase of this vehicle.  
	The vehicle was originally from Florida.  It must have been stored near
the ocean for a number of years because the interior metal components
(seat belt buckles, fuse boxes, mounting brackets for the swivel
seats...ect...) have severe rust.  The vehicle was transported to NJ and
was then stolen.  The thieves did a major number on this vehicle.  They
ripped the transmittion out, the engine was removed and the dash board
was torn out.  A mechanic in NJ rebuilt the vehicle and has been stored
in NJ for an unknown period.  Presently, the vehicle's rear hatch is
askew and you can see the outside world when looking to the rear of the
vehicle.  The tires appear to be the originals.  The interior does have
stains and several rips in the upholstery.  There are two dents the size
of a dumpster handles on the right and left rear quarter panels.  The
vehicle is presently parked next to a dumpster.  The asking price is
$12,000.  I am afraid that the owner of this fine Volkswagen did not
understand the ramifications of poor storage techniques.  Also, the
thieves who defaced this &quot;last of its kind&quot;, I hope, must of needed the
money for the parts to feed their starving children.  I would be more
interested if the vehicle had a clean history.  However, the story is
true and you can comprehend for yourselves.  I wish that this Westy was
what could replace our Campmobile.
	I send to the reading audience a request if there is an interested
party wishing to sell their Westfalia, I am still searching.  My dream
would be to find an 88-91 Westfalia Wolfsburg edition with a manual 5
speed, AC, power package, and some love shown to the vehicle.  Please
e-mail me if interested in passing your Westfalia to a consciences VW
owner.
