&gt;&gt;&gt; I like the idea of a newsgroup.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Ditto!! I was going to write the above myself. 
&gt;
&gt;There are mailing lists.  This group was started so that we could avoid the 
&gt;&quot;I can chirp my scirocco in all four gears&quot; crap on wreck.autos.vw
&gt;Usenet has accepted the role of of an advertising medium for cross post
spamming and get rich quick morons. Listservs make it possible to prevent
such use.  
&gt;With the filters set on your mail reader, you can separate each mailing
list to it's own folder and only have to read what's important to you at any
given time.
&gt;With Usenet you have to update your kill files dayly.
&gt;I hope others will support this group.  Once you learn to use your software
I think you'll really see the benifits of the listserv.
