Subject: Rocking of the Van...serious advice needed!

hey now,

hmm, how to phrase this appropriately...has anyone had experience with umm,
let's see...hmm, you are camping out with a lady friend, in a campground with
many other folks...ya get a little close in bed, some fooling around starts...
then next think you know the van is a rockin' and ya get whistles and yells
from all over the place...*blush* hmm, is there a way to level out the van to
keep it from rocking so much? maybe some of those RV stands? camp where no one
else is? abstinance? jacks? seriously, any advice would be appreciated....
