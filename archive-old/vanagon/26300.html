Jim,

Double-flare fittings, Japanese or American, look rather like the bell of a
horn, whereas bubble-flare looks a bit like the eye of a chamelian (sp?)...
the little lizard that can aim its eyes in different directions.  

In the mating portions of the female fittings the double-flare mates to a
projecting cone while the bubble-flared tube is forced into a funnel.  In
each case the function of the nut is to force the flare against the mating
section, which provides support and allows the fitting to be tightened
without crushing the flare.

A hazard exists between Japanese double flare and European bubble flare
because the threads of the fittings match and you can tighten the double
flared fitting enough to crush the flare into the bubble flared fitting's
funnel and get a seal.  But being unsupported, the seal eventually fails due
to vibration.  Once the fitting starts to leak it will loosen itself quite
quickly thanks to the nature of hydrualic fluid.  Usually, this mis-match
causes no damage to the female fitting.  If you've inadvertantly used a
section of metric double-flare tubing on your master cylinder, it shouldn't
cause any harm to the painfully expensive master cylinder.

An alternative to the over-priced '67 bus master cylinder is to re-plumb the
system to use the '66 master cylinder.  To do so you have to replace exactly
the section I had to replace due to damage, except you bring it to the area
near the front brake 'T', add another 'T' linking the first 'T', the line to
the rear brake and a new section of line to the master cylinder.  The only
difficulty is making up a short line to go between the 'T'.  One trick that
works there is to use a piece of stock replacement line about a foot long and
to coil it or make a long 'U' bend.  The 'U' would have to be supported, the
coil will support itself.  And yes, there isn't a lot of room to work but if
you pull the tie-rods its a fairly easy job.

Given that the early master cylinders cost about $20 while the late ones can
run over $200, even if you have to buy a double-flare tool you'll still come
out ahead, assuming you don't bill yourself for the couple of hours it will
take to do the job.
