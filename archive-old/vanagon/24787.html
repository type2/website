Subject: RE: Attention all '71 Bus Owners


&gt;Dear fellow '71 bus owners
&gt;
&gt;I am starting to put together my dream engine.  What I want to know is...
&gt;what size(cc), carb (single/dual), heads etc have worked and NOT worked for
&gt;your bus.  My main concern is overheating.  Thanks for the imput.


Try a '70 single-port engine with Solex 30PICT-3 carb, stock bus
muffler, generator, non-doghouse oil cooler, tired rings, one or
more vacuum leaks, two oil leaks, and an appetite for brake fluid.
You'll get all the overheating you want!

In fact, wanna buy one? I'll let mine go cheap!  :^)

Or, if you're trying to _avoid_ overheating... cross the above items
off your wish list.


Seriously, I ran a 1600 DP with alternator, doghouse cooler, Weber
progressive 32/36 carb, and Thunderbird single quiet pack in my '69 bus
for several years in the mountains of Colorado. A sweet setup, once I
got the idle air adjusted properly (by taking it to someone who knew
what he was doing).
