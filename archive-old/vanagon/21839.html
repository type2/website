Subject: Syncro Westie - Spare Tire

     The SSW (Silver Syncro Westie) that I am buying sight unseen in Oregon
     needs tires. 27x8.5x14 LT Tires tires have been highly recommended.
     This size is not listed in Bentley or the Vanagon archives, but I know
     they will fit the alloy rims and wheelwells.

     Of course, I should get a spare of the same size, since I never want
     to run the Syncro on un-equal tires.  Since I don't have the vehicle
     to look at, and don't have a good picture in my mind about the size of
     the spare's storage tray, I wonder if an oversize spare will fit? Any
     thoughts or experience in this area?


     Thanks
