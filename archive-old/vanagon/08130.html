	Dan,
	I can't see how Fe + C + NaCl would make much heat, but
substitute NaCl03 and you might be on to something- just a thought.

	Your point about warming a 50lb battery is a good one, sadly.

	I've got one of those super saturated sodium acetate hand warmers
- the kind with a clear gel in a plastic bag, and a clicker, and you
snap the clicker and the gel crystalizes and you get the heat of
fusion. You can recharge it by dropping it in boiling water for about
10 minutes, to redesolve the salt. Its cool to watch the crystalization
proceded too!

	Bill
