Subject: Starting problems w/ an '87 (ignition switch?)

All,

We a starting to have starting problems with our '87.  Usually happens only
in the morning.  You hop in and turn the key and nothing, absolutely nothing.
 No click, no buzz, no RRrrRRRrrrr, nothing.  Turn the key again, same thing.
 But if you turn the key and leave it there for 4-5 seconds it magically
kicks in ans starts up with no other problems.  Starts fine the rest of the
day and does not hapeen every morning.  Any ideas?

-Dan
