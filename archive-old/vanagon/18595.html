Subject: Re: Original Westy Tent

Hey, I'm NOT selling MY tent, it's that other guy who posted for advice in 
rec.autos.vw. Go get him! make him an offer he can't refuse, make him burn 
his neighbour and cause a new Hatfields vs. McCoys. Really, my tent is NOT 
FOR SALE, sorry for the confusion. I WAS trying to strike a deal for a new 
tent, but the deal fell through when the tent was sold with it's Westy 
Vanagon attached. If I ever get lucky, I'll pass on the old tent, not until. 
Mine, all mine, d'ya hear?
