Subject: sign me up?


Hi...

I used to be on the Vanagon mailing list, back when I worked for Ball Real 
Time Imaging
several months ago. My Email adress back then was:  smaher_at_ball_dot_com

 Now I've moved to General Instrument Corp., and my email address is: 
  smaher_at_gi_dot_com

I've tried to sigh back up to the list. But I think the return address on my 
messages, is not
the same as the one I gave above! Perhaps this is goofing things up?

Sorry for the problem. Here, we are using Microsoft Mail, which strips away 
all the headers,
return addresses, etc., and leaves me with a &quot;sanitized&quot; version containing 
the message
body and very little else.

May I beg your indulgence, and ask you to sign me up on the list, in such a 
way that
messages which have the typical header at the top of this one, are let in?

Please Email me directly if there are any problems; or call me at (619) 
455-1500 x3408.

Thank you!
