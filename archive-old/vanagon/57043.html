Hi volks,
  I noticed a little thread started about whats in our campers perminet
and just before we leave for a trip.  SO I thought I would share mine
and perhaps someone else will share theirs.

Glove Box:  Napkins, Burger King type (my kids love to make a mess)
        Flashlight.  Although is never seems to work when I need it.
	    Binoculars, just incase I see a UFO. OR an interesting sight.
	Chicklets, gum and lifesavers.  ( thats why the kids make a mess)
   Pens, a LiMBO flyer or 2 and assorted Fuses and bulbs.
Large cabinet:
   Top Shelf:  Dry goods.  Ramen pride soups.  Beans, tuna, peanut
butter(that loves to roll around and cluck making me wonder if something
is wrong with the bus).  Other can goods and snacks are added just
before take off.
 Bottom shelf:
    Another jar of Peanut butter ( I told my wife that I couldn't find a
jar once and now there are two). Crackers. (a must with peanut butter) 
Mostly its clean and empty until take off.  Then its full with Corn
flakes, Apple jacks, Little Debbies and other trip nessaties. I do not
leave dish soap in there anymore after we left a bottle in there for the
winter and it split open. 

Drawer:  Junk.  Really, knives, forks and spoons, and assorted utensils
for cooking.  Can opener, coffee filters.

Fridge:  Empty and relatively clean, it gets a good cleaning when my
wife fills it with milk and other perishables. 

Small Foot locker:
   Bungie cords and lots of them, duct tape ( like Macgyver give me
bungie cords and duct tape I can do anything), tools and a portable CB
radio, extra fuel pump and assorted parts.
Upper left locker (under table):
     Bentley Manuals, blow up raft for kids, a couple of rain ponchos
and a small drop cloth for quick road side repairs. 
 Upper right locker (under table):
    Curtins, Large pot, trash and supermarket bags and somthing else but
I can't remember. (something for the kids I'm sure)
Under the bench seat:  Electic cords, tarps, dish rack, water pump,
jack, lug  wrench and bag of kids toys.
Overhead closet:
   Towels, face cloths and toileties.  
Large Closet:
   Blankets and sleeping bags and lots of them.  
The shelf over the sink:
  I store a child cot I installed from a '79 camper, camp type lighter
and some small kids toys. ( the kids can't reach so I have to get the
toys all the time) Daddy, Daddy....
Rear closet:  Pots and pans, cups, coffee pot, pot holders (yes they do
help keep the rattles down) Paper towels (brawney, the big tuff towel)
plates, paper and plastic and bowls.

 Thats it, I think,  what alot of junk.  WOW.  Take care.
