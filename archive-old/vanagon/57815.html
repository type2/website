&gt; &gt;So what's the difference between the SOB that breaks into your van and
&gt; &gt;steals your stuff and the copyright violater? NOTHING, pure and simple.
&gt; 
&gt; Ric,
&gt; 
&gt; I think you're being a tad harsh.  VW isn't selling the specified book, nor
&gt; do they have plans to sell it.  Folks would gladly pay them the money, and
&gt; I didn't see anyone say that VW didn't need the money.  (I personally think
&gt; they need money so that they can import TDI Eurovan Westies, but hey...)
&gt; 
&gt; I'm not saying whether copying this material is right or wrong, I'm just
&gt; saying that noone was saying that general copying of material is alright.
&gt; Your comparison with a car thief was somewhat off-base.

 IMH(non-lawyer)O... Ric, although I would definitely trust your advice
on legal matters more than the others, your comparison to the 'car radio
thief' is a bit of a dramatic stretch, I offer this example to consider:

 Who would be more likely to break the offender's kneecaps with and
aluminium Baseball bat? (check one)
       
   [ ] Copyright holder having just learned about bootleg photocopies of
their             written material.

   [ ] VW owner clutching broken safety-glass in their trembling hands
with a dazed        stare trained fixedly on the gaping hole in the once
perfect dashboard.

 See my point? I don't think that it's the same. 

 However, I could also say to Ron that, I may have no plans of selling
my '68 Beetle any time soon, but that doesn't mean that people are
welcome to borrow/take it on account of my adopting that stance. (even
if they do fill up the tank with leaded)
 
 Jeeesus!!! What am I doing getting involved in a debate that has no
buisness being on the Vanagon list in the first place!?!? Like, maybe
you all would like it if I started posting descriptions of the new Moto
Guzzi motorcycle that I just bought!

Haarrumph! ;)
