It seems I've learned something here.
Well, I guess some 1987s had this feature, mine does not.  I wonder if it was
implemented in Canada in 1987 before the US in 1988 or perhaps they started
across the board late in 1987??

Do you other canadians have heat from the dash vents in your 1987s?
Perhaps we can determine from the VIN sequential numbers.  
What are the last 6 digits of your 87s?
