&gt;&gt; &gt; So how come it  takes 3 to drop the engine and forever to put it
&gt;&gt; &gt;back together?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Because, Lisa, you made the mistake of not buying a '71 or earlier
&gt;&gt; upright-fan engine bus! In and out in 3 hours, me only, working
&gt;&gt; slow.   :)
&gt;
&gt;    I'm starting to think that an older Westy with the simpler
&gt;    engine would not be a bad thing at all...


Well, I _was_ pretty much kidding. I wish I had the higher power and
(I've heard) better reliability of the type-4 engine, as well as a
flatter rear floor. However, I _did_ purchase this bus specifically
for its easy repairability and inexpensive parts-- you pays your
money and you takes your choice.

When it's running, yours is better. When it's broken, mine is.
Unfortunately, with cars this old, both must be taken into account.
It's all part of the VW experience!  :)
