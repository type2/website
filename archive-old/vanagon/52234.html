&gt;  Peter,
&gt; 
&gt;    How does the 4 wheel drive work? Is it the same as a Vanagon,
&gt;    with a vicous setup? Can you lock or unlock the coupling? Can
&gt;    you get it with axle lock? What is the rear axle like? Is it
&gt;    independent suspension? Are they avalable with automatics?
&gt;    What is your gas milage?
&gt; 
&gt;     I think I want one but can't find info on them.

Yes, the syncro system is like the one on vanagon. The viscous coupling 
sits ahead of the rear axle, which has diff lock and independent 
suspension. No terrain gear, 5speed straight gearbox. You cant lock the 
visc. coupling. I have never seen a EV syncro with autotranny so im not 
sure about it. I have a diesel and drive a lot on low gears, its not so 
thirsty thou.
