 Hi. I just purchased an after market cat. converter, and it came with one 
 regular gasket and one metal doughnut gasket.  Is this right?  The 
 bentley shows two regular gaskets.  It looks like 2 regular gaskets on 
 the vehicle now (though I haven't taken it apart).  By the way, it's an '87.
  &gt;&gt;
In late 87, VW changed over to a donut on the inlet side os the CAT.  Play
havoc when changing the CAT or that inlet pipe.  Your lcal FLAPS should be
able to get you a donut that is flat with a guide ring on one side.  This
will allow you to match up the parts needing a donut on one side and a flnge
on the other.  BTW, the Walker CAT.(#15612) will accept either a donut or the
gasket on the inlet side.

Dennis.
