&gt;before, but... have an '88 Vanagon with its first cancer spot - right where
&gt;the rubber seal around one of the side rear windows meets the body. What's
&gt;the thing to do here to stop its progress? I'd always thought of painting

i've had really good long term results with Navel Jelly (finally spelled it
right!) ... it's sold at wal-mart, k-mart, etc. in a plastic jar. it's some
pink stuff that is (i think this is right) phophoric acid. what you have to
do is to scrap/sand/whatever off all of the rust (as much as humanly possible)
and then paint this pink stuff over it. wait the required time (see directions)
and then wash it off. dry it. and paint it with primer. then when the primer
is dry, paint it with whatever color you want.

it's supposed to change the rust into a non-rusting, paintable something.
other folks have sworn by some stuff called POR-15, but i haven't tried it
yet.  just be sure to follow the directions and be careful with the Naval
jelly ... keep it out of your eyes and mouth. :)

and i don't care what anybody says ... i don't think you can have TOOOOO
many coats of paint on car.
