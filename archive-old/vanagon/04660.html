1) The pass is a good idea given your planned route - especially through
Arizona, Utah, California, Washington  and Oregon -- 

2) I would remove the bra - especially if you are going through
fluctuating temp changes-where condensation is bound to form  (We are
talking about the same thing right?)

3) There was a discussion back in July/August on what to take on a trip.
You can access the gopher files to have a look at suggestions..
Good luck - DC
