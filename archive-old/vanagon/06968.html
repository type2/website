&gt; Gerry Writes:
&gt; 
&gt; My under the rear seat heater is leaking too, so it's important that I get
&gt; enough temperature up front to survive while I pull that one out.  Is
&gt; there a way to replace these?  Would a radiator place know what to do with
&gt; them? 

Based on my experience, I would guess that the bleeder screw is leaking on
your rear heater core.  I spent quite a bit of time working on mine last
spring.  The bleeder screw is on the upper left corner of the heater assembly
as you face it from the front.  When the bleeder screw leaks the coolant 
will collect inside the black plastic housing that holds the heater core and 
fan which gave me the impression that the heater core was leaking as well. 
To make a long story short, I bought a replacement heater core and never
installed it.  It took a long time for residual coolant to stop dripping
from the heater core fins, but when it finally did I was convinced that the
heater core was fine.  The heater core has plastic caps on either end which
makes repairing difficult.

Tips for working on it:

	1) Remove the rear bench seat.  Makes life much more pleasant.
	2) Look for evidence of a coolant trail dripping from the bleeder screw.
	   If present, replace bleeder screw.
	3) Disassemble the black plastic housing (requires six hands and five
	   screw drivers :) leaving just the heater core attached to the two
	   heater hoses.
	4) Clean up any coolant and let the heater core set on a towel for
	   several days with the flow through valve set open so coolant will
	   flow through the heater core.  It probably took 5 days for coolant
	   to stop dripping from my heater core fins.  The stuff just will
	   not evaporate.
	5) If your convinced that the heater core is leaking drop me some 
	   email and maybe we can work out deal with my brand-new-never-been-
	   installed-still-in-the-box heater core.
