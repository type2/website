In an effort to boost the ailing dollar vis-a-vis the ever-healthy DM,
President Clinton, in cooperation with VAN2, has declared today 
&quot;National Trade-In-Your-Volkswagen Day&quot;.  The announcement came early
this morning from the breakfast nook in the Oval Room.  &quot;Don't miss this
opportunity to get rid of the various Volkswagen products that may be
cluttering up your garage and driveway,&quot; said Clinton in a prepared
release.  Clinton promised significant tax breaks to any U.S. citizen
who trades in any Volkswagen vehicle in exchange for an American-made
one by midnight tonight.  VAN2--Volkswagens Are Nightmares To Work On--
is a Tuscaloosa, Alabama based organization.
