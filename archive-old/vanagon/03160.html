&gt; 
&gt; Here's one for you: when we bought the camper five months ago it was
&gt; equipped with three generic brand 195R14's and one 185R14. The two
&gt; mismatched tires were on the rear. I promptly dumped those and
&gt; replaced them with a decent pair of Michelin X reniforced 185R14's onon
&gt; the back. I am curious if a) the mismatched tires would have had a
&gt; bizarre affect on the engine or suspension (they were well worn) and b)  apart from
&gt; affecting the speedometer slightly if running the 195's at the front
&gt; and the 185's at the back would create a problem (none so far I think
&gt; after 10k). 

	Only after tire rotation (at the tire shop) :-)
&gt; 
&gt; BTW the 195's were not reinforced so I elected to leave them up front.
&gt; I guess the previous owner was persuaded that a larger diam. tire
&gt; would make up for its lack of reinforcement.
&gt; 
	Jeez...I'd think they'd be worse. My understanding is the reinforced
	sidewalls are for controlling sway (to reduce the chance of rollover)
	not for preventing sidewall blowouts.

	If the above be true, then larger dia. could be worse.
