Subject: Bug wanted

I am looking for a bug to buy for my girlfriend, it must run good and have a
good trans.  No projects please.  The body  can be in so-so condition but
complete.  Any model year is acceptable.  Looking to spend no more than
$1000.  Most important it must be close to or in Spokane Washington.  If you
have any info please drop a line or  call Derrick at (509) 235-5550.
  Thanks.
