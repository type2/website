Subject: RE: Window tinting



In reference to window tinting, any advice on where to buy material,
measure correct dimensions, cut and apply the stuff?  Most places
that provide this service cost an arm and a leg and I've wanted to
tint my van for a couple of years.  Also, two more questions.  What
is the best way to prep(clean) the glass and it tint applied to the
indis  (inside) probably, or outside of the surface?  Anyone out there
who might have this info.? TIA  Steve '83 Vanagon L
