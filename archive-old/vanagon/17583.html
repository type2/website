  The Bently has for the AE motor: 50 HP _at_ 4000 &lt;DIN&gt; and 60 HP _at_ 4400 &lt;SAE&gt;.
  Who is DIN?



  Someone else was able to tell us who DIN is &lt;thank you&gt; and I would like to
  suggest that the DIN numbers are more useful than the SAE. At least that
  they have been more consistent over the years. Before 1972 or so the SAE
  numbers reported were SAE gross horsepower. This technique allowed all the
  accessories, including the cooling fan, to be left off the engine when 
  testing for horsepower. The SAE numbers after 1972 are SAE net and are 
  often lower than the DIN numbers for the same engine. If one wishes to 
  compare horsepower ratings, using the DIN numbers should at least be 
  consistent from year to year.
