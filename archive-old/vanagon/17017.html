Subject: de-Westy a 73?? $$$


I know people will howl at this question, but I've gotta ask...

I've got a super clean 73 Westy. I just bought the thing from the 
original owner. It had 145k original miles, 2nd engine in it with about 
30k on it. Not a speck of rust, garaged.

Well....as it turn out, I need a window van (two actually). So, I'm 
considering defiling this gal. Pulling off the top and so on. It has the 
tent, pull out bed and jump seat with fabric in excellent condition. 
Cabinets are very clean. Sink and frig and an &quot;infant hammock&quot; that locks 
into slots on the front door pillars.

So, what should I ask for this. Would I be better off just selling this 
thing and replacing it with a straight window van for the difference in cash?

I want something that isn't a rust bucket, and I paid top dollar (read 
way too much) for this thing.... (If you're wondering why...we were going 
to take a trans-America trip, and since my wife quit her job we can't 
afford it but need his and her busses....)

Suggestions.
