Subject: Brake Drum Removal

I forgot to mention in my previous posting, but I solved my Drum Removal 
problem for future R&amp;R projects.  I had an older BMW that had rear drums on 
it.  It also had two 11 MM bolts hoding it on to the hub.  The drum had 
three threaded holes in it.  Two of the holes were not threaded  and the 
third hole was threaded for an 11 MM bolt.  The third hole was blind in 
relation to the hub.

Before I reinstalled the drums on my Westy, I drilled and tapped an 11 MM 
hole in the drum.  Now  when I have to remove the drum, I unscrew the 11 MM 
bolts, thread one into the new hole, tighten and Voila!  Drum pops right 
off without any banging,nut pulling or swearing.  I'm not sure why VW 
didn't do it.  Makes life a lot easier.
