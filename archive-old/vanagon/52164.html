Subject: 86 Syncro - shifting after rebuild
Date: Sat, 23 Nov 96 02:04:00 CDT


The transmission was just rebuilt on my 86 Syncro.  Now, shifting is tight 
from 3rd down into 2nd and down into 1st.  Generally it is OK strating in 
1st and shifting into 2nd, though at times it's tight.   Shifting up into 
3rd is tough sometimes, but it doesn't seem to follow a particular pattern.

Is it possible the first two gears were not aligned correctly?
