Subject:      my dealership croaks

Hi all,

Great news :(, the local dealership is closing its doors this Friday. Nope
no clearance sale! Now where do I pick up the nuisance parts?

Might have something to do with the recently fired owner having been caught
smuggling several cases of tins of AC freon over the US border.  He's facing
charges, and fines could total $US1,600,000 (yup, 1.6 million!)  ;)  Caught
by Customs on both sides of the border in a 'combined operation'  Offhand
I'd say they looked in the trunk.  bye folks, Tim
