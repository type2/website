Subject: Breaking loose rear end...

&gt; So, what exactly does it mean to break ones rear end loose???
&gt; Just curious.

When you want to make a 90 degree turn and do it fast in an aircooled VW,
you twitch the wheel hard left (or right) and accelerate.  You turn the
wheel in the direction of the slide and find yourself going 90 degrees to
your previous direction.  My direction of choice was a left turn because
even at 22 years old I knew it was better to have the passenger side
between me and what I might hit than the driver's door.

I learned to do this in my parent's 66 bug and then graduated to my own 66
camperbus.  A previous poster recommended learning to do it in someone
else's vehicle.  I concur...
