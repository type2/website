Subject: update - bus exhaust

Hi all

Folks have asked me to post a summary to the list of my experiences
with the new 1-piece replacement exhaust I had purchased from JC Whitney.

Here's the summary:

Lesson learned - when buying a new replacement part for your VW, ,ake
sure you look at the parts it is intended to mate to, and not just
assume that your VW is stock.  For me, my bus has a set of wrong-year
heat exchangers (either 72-74 or 79, probably 79).  

My bus (77, not 78 as I mistakenly wrote in the subject of my request
for gasket help) is supposed to take the single-ported exhaust; the
parts that mate to the heat exchangers are triangle-shaped with a big
round hole in the center.  What it actually takes is a dual-ported
exhaust; the parts that mate to the heat exchangers are trapezoidal
with two smaller round holes.

Anybody need a new single-port single-piece replacement exhaust for
a 75-78 bus?  I paid $65 plus change at JC Whitney.  It's either pass
it along to somebody here or try to return it to JC Whitney, then get
the correct exhaust for my incorrect bus.

	Thanks
		Jay
