Subject:      Re: Subaru 2 Vanagon or TURBO?

Curt,
In all honesty, in this particular application, 2.1L wasserboxer, since
apparently it was never turbo'd at the factory, the only way I would do
it would be to take it to a specialty shop and let then put on the whole
rig. I am sure this would be in the nieghborhood of say $3,500 or so and
most likely unacceptable, as you can purchase a 2.2 Subaru w/twin
watercooled turbos (turbocharged) and swap all that mess in for the same
or less money.
