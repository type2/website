Subject: Van shopper returns-thanks


Thanks to everyone who advised me on van shopping a few weeks ago.  After
innumerable experiences (some comical, some tragic) with various vanagons
I was almost ready to consider other brands.  Didn't think I could find
what I needed for my max. price.  All of you who said Seattle is over
priced were right-many vanagons sell for 1-2 K over blue book. 

But then I met Delilah, and my problems were solved.  She's an '87 GL with
1500 miles on a factory rebuild (it's still real shiny), done by a VW
dealer.  111 K miles all together.  Weekender, manual, a/c, dark grey,
cruise control (BFD), and a putatively extra special paint job that is
corrosion resistent (hype?). Super clean, inside and out, and I found a
pair of used Yakima racks so I'm ready to hit the rivers with my kayak. :)
And the CV joints were done about 10 K miles ago.  No leaks, the 
tranny is dry, and tight alignment, too.

THings I learned while shoppin':

Used car lots are among the most miserable places on earth (got mine 
	private). 
If you have to buy an older vehicle, I think going for a recent rebuild is
	more prudent, at least after seeing the repair receipts in glove
	boxes. 
Never let the seller talk with his girlfriend during the negotiating 
	stages-I lost $300 this way. :)
People lie. 

Anyhow, it's been nice eavesdropping on y'all during this process and I 
do like to do my own repairs whenever possible, so I'm sure I'll be 
around for a while.  Jill
