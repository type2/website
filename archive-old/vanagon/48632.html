    I have a front seat out of a 1980 model. I'm not sure why, but
    it is alot more comfortable than both 86 seat?

&gt; Rich, My 84 Westy seats exhibit the same symptoms.We have suffered for 12
&gt; years as you describe. My 87 syncro has larger front seats and could be
&gt; swapped with the smaller seat.
&gt; As for the A/C....The compressor rear o-rings  where the hoses enter
&gt; constantly get crushed down and leak.Ive replaced them 3 times(they will blow
&gt; out due to the excess high side pressure due to inefficient condenser surface
&gt; area...over 300psi)Id check these out first.The only other place to check
&gt; would be the receiver...the oem had a pressure relief plug that will blow
&gt; out...but it would be fairly obvious.
