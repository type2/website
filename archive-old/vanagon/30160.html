Great job Sarah!,

The only thing that I want to know is :

When a Brit refers to &quot;bleeding brakes&quot; are we unsophisticated &quot;colonists&quot;
supposed to insert the proper acccent and assume that you're talkin about
the BLEEDIN' brakes or that you need to bleed the BLEEDIN' brakes?
Hopefully, if taken care of in time, you will avoid the Bloody BLEEDIN'
brake bleeding scene.
Did anyone say SP...?  eggs, eggs and SP.. and eggs...?  Naw, in the
computer world,  even that old bit might turn nasty! 8I

I liked your site! Good on ya (or maybe next to you would be better).
