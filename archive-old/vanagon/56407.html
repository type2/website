Subject: Front seat/upholstery

I am looking for front seat upholstery for a 1983 Brown Vanagon GL.  The
seats are Beige velour (cloth) with a houndstooth insert panel.  The
interior code is KZ.  If I cannot find the cloth I am willing to buy an
entire seat.  If anyone has any idea where I can find one please let me
know.

Thanks

Diesel John
