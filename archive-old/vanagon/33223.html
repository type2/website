Subject: license plate frames


At most autopart stores (Kragen, Grand Auto, etc.) they sell a &quot;kit&quot; which
is basically a blank frame with self-adhesive letters of the alphabet (often
2 or 3 of each letter).  With this, you can create your own custom license
plate frame, have it say what you want it to, change it if you like, and
be totally in charge of the graphic design/layout.  I can't remember what
this thing cost, but it was reasonable...
