&gt; So, one might hope to get a few of hours' heat out of a big battery

&gt; all day to get that thing charged again...

The whole process might work, but why bother for a few hours of mediocre
heat?  Heating with electricity is not the answer - heating with GAS is,
be it propane or a regular gas heater.  Gas is the only way to go for
heating an RV while it is parked (and not plugged in).  Does anyone know
where you can get a good *vented* propane heater (catlytic?) for under a
hundred bucks?  That's what I want.
