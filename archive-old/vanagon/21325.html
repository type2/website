Subject: RE: Olga, et al.... [FFFFFun FFFFriday!]

I've decided that anyone who really likes VW buses would like Olga too, 
so I've set up the listserver so that ALL of the Olga messages would get 
distributed to you all.  

You're welcome!            &lt;huge grin&gt;

P.S. I've actually set up the listserv to screen for all of the following 
words: olga
       ussr
       romance
  And I'm sorry I didn't get it done sooner.  Oh well.
