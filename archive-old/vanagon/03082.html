Sorry to flood the list with my reply indended for David.  I am
on two mailing list on different mail servers.  When I hit &quot;r&quot; on
one, the reply goes to the sender.  When I hit &quot;r&quot; on the other,
it goes to the whole list (obviously).  I usually check the to:
line, but I guess I messed up this time.

That's what happens when there are no Friday songs to soothe my
mind!  :)
