Subject: '80 Vanagon H2O, need transmission guidance.
Date: Tue, 15 Oct 96 08:37:10 EDT

     I have sitting in my garage a 1980 H2O Vanagon.  Here's the problem.  The
guy who owns it doesn't want to pay an arm and a leg for a new tranny.  I
checked the shift linkage and nosecone, and the C/V joints, all are OK.  There
is no forward movement.  Seems that the tranny is shot.  I looked around for a
replacement and the cheapest used I could find for this model is $425.  I was
wondering if an older Air Cooled BUS transaxle would fit.  I used to do swaps
in my Bug all the time between older and newer transaxles and all it usually
required was a nose cone swap.  Can I do the same with the Vanagon or is it too
different?

     Thanks for any helkp you can provide.  I'm looking for the CHEAPEST way
out of this one.  I need to get this Vanagon out of my garage.
