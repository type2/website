Subject: Re: 85 Vanagon Camper Owner's Manual

&gt; 
&gt; The owner's manual--the camper supplment--that we got with our bus is
&gt; missing pp. 11-18. Any ideas about where we could get a copy? Thanks!

You can order a copy of the manual through any VW dealer for $10 or $15.
You could probably get someone on the list to xerox those pages for you.
I would offer, but do not know if the pages for the '91 and '85 would be
the same as 84-87 and 88-91 were 2 different &quot;models&quot;.
