Subject:      feelthy limericks (but about buses!)


There was a young man from Nantucket,
Who kept in his bus a big bucket,
Which he used to dig clams,
(Great big ones, like hams)
And they'd make him so sick he'd upchuckit.

There was an old hermit named Dave,
Who kept an old bus in a cave.
When traffic went fast,
He was always the last,
But think of the money he saved!

There was a young fellow from Kent,
Whose bus in the middle was bent.
With the steering he fiddled,
So he drove from the middle,
And it caused quite a stir down in Ghent!

There was a young girl from Madras
Who painted her bus like the grass.
But the leaves looked so real,
As she took to her wheels,
That the hippies would chase her en masse.


sorry, folks. i just couldn't resist! :)
