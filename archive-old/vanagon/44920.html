&gt; Highly debateable, and not really worth talking about on the list but
I'll interject that FORD makes the CHEAPEST trucks, hence sell the most,
and this might be vaguely confused with quality.   Take a look at truck fleets
of people who use them for REAL work, off road, every day, might see a lot
of em Chevy products and now days even them new fangled Dodge products?

As for mid sized cars, I guess we're talking US only here, maybe Chevy,
who cares?

admittedly only 1 non VW product in my life, and it was GM
