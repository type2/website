Subject: Just how cold should that fridge get



I am amazed to hear that some fridges out there can cool to 40 below ambient.
My 84 dometic consistently cools 20-25 below ambient on max.  Ventililation
is unobstructed, I recently cleaned the gas jet which made it easier
to light but did not improve performance.  Maybe earlier fridges do not work
as well? Maybe my thermostat is broken (anyone know how it works and how to test
it?).  I am planning to install a solar fan but I doubt it will improve
performance that much. Suggestions?
