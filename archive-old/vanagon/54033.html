RE:	Copy of: Mud flap

&gt;I noticed that there is a mud flap on the drivers side front
&gt;wheel, but there is none on the passengers side.  There isn't
&gt;even any bracket!  Is this normal?  My theory is that because
&gt;the valves are on the drivers side, the mud flap prevents stones
&gt;and mud from flying up and hitting the valve covers.
&gt;
&gt;Any ideas?

Your theory is correct.  Why should VW give us a passengers side mudflap for
free, especially if it's not required by a safety's standpoint (to protect the
propane tank) and especially if they can get $* for it, because they know most
people think it's silly to just have one mudflap on the vehicle, and would want
a matching set.

*(call your dealer and make sure you're sitting down......)

I know someone at VW thought long and hard to come up with this acccessory
marketing ploy......   :&lt;)
