Howdy, 

Two quick questions:

1) Do you sell the plastic rider for the rear of the sliding door &quot;U&quot;-bolt
hinge?  There was a guy on the vanagon list who asked earlier today about
replacing the sliding door rear assembly, and I am suggesting he replace
this bit no matter how good the used one is.  Do you sell replacements?
[Heck, I need one (maybe 2 {one for the spares box}) too if you do].

2) You were looking for a NOS shift rod bushing.  I *don't* have a NOS one,
but I have an entire shift rod in the basement.  Would you like me to slide
the bushings off and send them to you?
