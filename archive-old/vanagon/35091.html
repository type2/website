Chris,

I'm no genius, but I don't think there's any way to be sure of TDC except
poking something into the spark plug hole. It's really not something you
should be worried about...unless you get careless or silly (like trying to
move the pistons up and down by having a friend bump the ignition ...you
can't really hurt anything. Just disconnect the battery...or pull the hot
wire off the coil...whatever, unscrew #1 plug, turn the engine over (by
hand: on mine, I turn the generator nut with a rachet and socket) to where
TDC is *supposed* to be, slide a drinking straw into #1 and find the point
at which the cylinder starts it' return downward. Not sure you got it?
Look at the pulley. Is there a mark right there? Try it again..and
again..and again. That's it. That's TDC. 

Ten minutes or so and you have no questions...and you have that KILLER 
reference point from which all adjustments are possible.

On my engine, the distributor shaft is apparently not set in right, so I
have to time her to read about 17-20 degrees BTDC at idle. When you do the
math, she's probably at 10-13 degrees BTDC...but that's another
problem...and finding TDC doesn't really help with that. Although it did
help me figure out that I wasn't completely crazy. Well, at least not in
THAT way. 

As for the canvas thing, I'll bet it is your child cot. They aren't meant 
for a hefty child...just toddlers. I don't think I'd put my kid in one to 
sleep, but it would come in handy as a shelf. What color is the canvas? 
Mine's brown and it's the water-repellant kind of canvas.

Good luck! Joe
