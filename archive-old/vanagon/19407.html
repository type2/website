Subject: oil &amp; head temps

My reply to your reply cc'd to the westie group


I take a good 11 miles for the temperature gauge to reach up to steady state
225. On the freeway I get steady state at 250 F

I spoke to a colleague who also has an instrumented bus. He syas that head
temps of 475 are quite common and maybee even a little over 500 he slows down
at 525.

He thinks that 250 is fine for oil temp.

what am I to believe???

PS the revs I am happy with are steady state at 4000 rom which is 72 mph if
the data of 18mph per 1000 rpm is correct.

this makes my speedometer 3 mph fast and I read 68 at 65

&gt;I drove to work this lunchtime,  The bus steady stated with an oil temp of
&gt;250 F and a head temp of 450, these seemed a little high. I was cruising at
&gt;3800 rpm
&gt;I think I may be pushing it a bit
&gt;when I idled the head temp dropped to 350F
&gt;
&gt;The head temp seems to go up and down really quickly
&gt;tks for all the info
&gt;my owners manual syas that 65 is max and cruising speed I inferr from this
&gt;that max revs should be about 3600 and it could go to 4000 for a short while
&gt;

The T1 motor will turn 4400 no problem.  Muir does _not_ say anything about 
a max of 3500.
Muir does say to shift at 15-30-50.  If you try this in your bus, you will 
find that 4400 rpm= 15 mph in 1st = 30 mph in 2nd, etc...  I wouldn't worry 
about cruising at 65, as I do 70 on the interstate. What I would worry about:
An oil temp of 250 is way too high!!  This will breakdown the oil very 
quickly.  Oil temp must be kept under 225 degrees.

I have a 71 with a 1600 DP and have and oil temp gauge which I built myself. 
 I have calibrated the scale, and know absoultely that it reads correct.  I 
run about 150-160 in town, and 180-190 on the interstate.  Cruising at 55-60 
mph has an oil temp of 160, while at 65-70 gives more of 180 degree range.

I don't have a head temp gauge.

What kind of cooler syatem do you have on your bus?  A doghouse?  These are 
absolutely necessary for a bus with a 1600.

If you have any questions, just write back.
