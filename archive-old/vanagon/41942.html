Subject: Re: Exhaust Repair Bummer

&gt;I recently used a combination of stainless steel nuts, bolts &amp; washers and
&gt;anti-sieze compound when reassemblying my exhaust. Although won't be able to
&gt;see the fruits of this change for years, I'll bet that the next
&gt;dissassembly/reassembly will go much much easier.  I would recommend using
&gt;only stainless fasteners with anti-sieze for VW exhausts.

Jim and/or anyone else out there!,

I've seen copper nuts sold for use on exhaust studs for upright engines.  Is
this also a good solution, or are there problems associated with
using/torquing down the comparatively softer copper nuts.  I'd bet the
copper nuts are cheaper than the stainless too so if the net result is the
same (no struggling with frozen nuts) is copper the way to go?
