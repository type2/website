Subject: Re: Lost my Vanagon Headlights!!

Well, my '87's headlights had exactly the same problem with exactly the same
cure.  the trouble has not yet come back.

I also have the same 'feature' (I really thought it was a feautre) that only
lets me lock the driver's side door with my key and not with the knob except
when the door is closed (precaution whiloe driving).

&gt;   PS: Does anyone else have this special Vanagon feature? I cannot lock the
&gt;   driver's door by just pushing down the little knob and closing the door. I
&gt;   have to use the key to lock it from the outside. It works if I am inside the
&gt;   Van. I guess this way I won't lock my keys in the Van.;-)
