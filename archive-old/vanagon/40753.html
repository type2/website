Subject: Renting a Westy in Twin Cities?

Does any list member know where one can rent a Westy or Eurovan Camper in 
the Twin Cities area?  We'll be visiting the end of July and would like to 
tour the state.  I already tried the Minnesota web page and found nothing,
so additional leads would be most welcome.
