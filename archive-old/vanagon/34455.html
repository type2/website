&gt;a new distributor that would retime #3?  If so, has anyone any

What type of remote cooler are you using.  If it is mounted behind the fan it
will make your overheat problem even worse.  Tube and fin coolers remove
little heat.  A remote mounted stacked plate design with a thermosta is the
only way to go.  Anything else is just a headache.  71 factiry doghouse is
best set-up.  See Gene berg catalouges.
