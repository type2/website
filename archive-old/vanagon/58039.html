&gt;Has anyone tried installing any of the AutoLoc actuators as a
&gt;replacement for the VW actuators on their power door lock system?  If
&gt;so, I'd like to hear your testimonial.  
&gt;
&gt;At prices ranging from $14 to $25 AND if they work, they would be a
&gt;viable alternative to the VW price of $80 to $115 for the VW actuators.
