Subject: Re: Speaking of Vanagon Shocks

&gt;I was thinking that new shocks may improve the ride/handling on my '87
&gt;Vanagon GL. While browsing the Bentley manual the other day in my spare
&gt;time, I noticed that it says that you need a special tool to undo the top
&gt;nut on the front shocks. Can it really be? Have you guys successfully done
&gt;this at home in your garage (or parking lot) without the VW tool? Also any
&gt;ideas on good replacement shocks?

&gt;Hey Rich, I've got a 82 Westy and my side mirrors were stolen a week before 
I stored her last fall. Let me know if your 82 parts van has them intact.
