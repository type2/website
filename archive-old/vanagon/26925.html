&gt;Hey, can I get one with a big red circle and bar over the Eurovan? &lt;eg&gt;
&gt;that's &lt;evil grin&gt; ;&gt;

You'd be happier if he put an Aerostar on the shirt?! ;-)

I've had and enjoyed my air-cooled VW's (&amp; rebuilt 'em, too).  But when I
looked at MY needs for today, it was either an Astro or an EV.  I'll take
the VW, anyday.  

The interesting thing is that the AC/WC/technology/CHANGE debate is not
confined to VW's.  The same discussions go on over in the BMW motorcycle
list.  Air-cooled, simple, classic, vs. water-cooled, complex, modern.  The
conclusion is the same there as here -- there are different tools for
different jobs.  You use the one that's right for the job.  The appropriate
tool for me is the EV.  I still want a '70 bus, but when I get it, it won't
replace the EV.  It'll serve another purpose.

Hey - another reason to get the Tshirts -- you'll  have a spotters guide so
you'll know why I'm wavin' at ya!!!  I've got local EV drivers waving now,
but I don't think Vanagon drivers can tell an EV from an Astro.
