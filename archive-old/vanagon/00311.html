Subject: Re: 72 &amp; 73 Camper questions

#1 - I don't know the laws in Mass, but you may have probs with your
inspection. I'd check that out. But as long as you can do it without
getting in trouble, pulling the smog stuff (and plugging all hoses
appropriately to avoid vacuum leaks) will give you a little more kick.. It
sounds like a progressive to me (is it a 2 bbl?) As for noise - obviously
check valves first, but there are 8 bolts holding the head to the case (4
under the rocker arm and 4 hidden by the sheet metal.) Better drop the
engine to torque everything - It's not too bad really (I've gotten plenty
of practice as of late :o) 

#2 - That's the only way I've ever checked them... JUST BE SURE NOT TO DO
THIS AROUND GAS LINES!

If you've got any questions, let 'em rip. I'm in the middle of a 73 engine
myself. Almost together!

&gt;  Hi all. I've got a whole slew of camper-related questions. Answers to _any_
&gt; of them would be much appreciated.
&gt;  1. We have a 73' poptop with the 1700. When we first got it, the Solex carbs
&gt; seemed to be hosed, and I replaced them with a Weber from JC Whitney. This
&gt; carb sits atop a manifold that runs to the ports on each side. I works well,
&gt; but required that I remove quite a bit of the emissions (fresh air-pump lines
&gt; ,etc.). I needed to plug the ports where thery entered the engine. Aside from
&gt; getting it through inspection (I'm in MA, so it's not _so_ bad), will this
&gt; affect the way my engine runs at all? Also, the linkage where the gas pedal
&gt; cable attaches is in a different place. Had anyone had any experience moving
&gt; the tube through which this runs to the back of the van? As silly as it
&gt; seems, nowhere in the documentation that came with this carb (or on the box) 
&gt; did it identify what model Weber I have ... Does it sound like a progressive?
&gt;  The compression on the right (passenger's) side of the engine is great, but
&gt; the two cylinders on the driver's side are terrible. It's also very noisy
&gt; over there when running, and I can hear air hissing. What I'm hoping is that
&gt; the head has come loose ... After removing the rocker arms, I've discovered
&gt; four bolts that seem to hold the head on. Are there another four under the
&gt; sheetmetal that is directly about the head? Should I removeit and tighted them as well?
&gt;  2. I also just picked up a '72 bus with the camper interior. It was too cheap
&gt; to pass up ($200), and parts are hard to come to here in Mass. The compression
&gt; on this one is great, but I am yet to get it started. Is tehre a better way to
&gt; test for spark at the plugs than by holding them to the block &amp; turning the
&gt; engine over (as per Muir manual)? This never really works for me very well -
&gt; even on vehicles that run. This vehicle has been converted to electronic
&gt; ignition, and I'm thinking about undoing that ...If the carbs were shot, would
&gt; I at least be able to get it to catch using starting fluid?
&gt; 
&gt;  Sorry to be so long winded ... any help is much appreciated.
