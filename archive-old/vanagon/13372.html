Heap by martha rubin_at_s1.csuhaywa 
&gt; If I had 30K to spend, I'd get have someone make me up an amphibious
&gt; turbo-diesel synchro, but air cooled, and with wings for flying,
&gt; and landing gear for both land and sea.  Just in case...
&gt;

What?!?!   No skis/skids?
...and what of the hole in the floor with sites for airborne prune
bombing runs?
(sorry, didn't mean to include the word 'runs' in that sentence)   X-)
