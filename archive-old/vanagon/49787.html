&gt;may wish to investigate:  1991 Westy, said to have 3000 original miles,
&gt;$12,500.  Located in Hackensack NJ.  I stopped to see it because it is so
&gt;pretty: white, with the Carat wheels and lower body cladding.  Body looks
&gt;perfect with exception of a small but severe ding on the passenger side
&gt;rear corner: maybe 3/4&quot; deep and confined to an area 2&quot; in diameter.


If I was in the area I'd look at it.  

I just drove a 1997 Eurovan Camper. It was very nice, had lots of power (new
6 cyl. engine), but it cost $37,500!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  That is, in my humble
opinion, ridiculous and has no relationship whatsoever to what &quot;Volkswagen&quot;
once stood for.  I've been curious about this vehicle for months, but that
price tag is just way way way too much.

So tell me about Westy's, PLEASE!!!!

When did they start/stop making them?  What are they like??  Reliable??  Too
slow??  What are the camper features??  Are they usually massively
expensive??  Cheap??

Any and all information will be more than a little appreciated after my
experience with the nearly 40 thousand dollar  vw I just drove.

I gotta tell you that my last vw was an 83 Vanagon and it was a total
disaster: bought it used about 4 years ago and watched it as it slowly fell
apart :-(

Thanks,
