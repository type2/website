Subject: Are there other canucks on this list?

	I'm not sure if I'm the only poor Rust bombarded Canadian on this 
list, especially from the Ontario region.  I know the survey Joel 
publishes mentions about 14 'bricks' in Ontario, but I've only noticed a 
few regular post-ers with Canadian tags.

	Canuck 'Brick' drivers unite!  Spring is coming soon!  Let's 
share information regarding VW events and techie stuff about Canadian 
parts suppliers and distributors.  Solidarity among the slow lane set!

	Please feel free to e-mail me with location and transportation 
info, maybe someone can initiate our own Vanagon/Bus list...who knows the 
potential?

	Specifically does anyone know of upcoming VW events, &quot;Bug-In&quot;'s 
etc in the south-central Ontario area.  What about upper New Yrok State?

	I'd love to hear from you...eh?
