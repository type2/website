Volkswagencamperbusvolks,

In the (maybe not-so) recent thread on camper types, mine was
omitted (sob!).  I have a '72 Safare Custom, with a pop-top that
starts behind the driver's compartment (luggage rack in front) and
pops straight up.  Is this uncommon, or was it just overlooked in the
discussion?
