Subject: Re: '72 engine questions

in my '73 bus there's an air outlet from the fan housing at the location you
described. it goes to the charcoal filter to provide air pressure for the
fuel tank ventilation...not sure if you have the same engine i have though...
    enjoy,

&gt; While getting more intimate with my engine I found two more
&gt; perplexing thingies.  One seems to be an air outlet on the upper left
&gt; rear of the engine.  it points straight to the left and is not
&gt; connected to anything.  The other is a thin black bar directally above
&gt; the fan housing.  It is spring loaded and actuated by a cable that
&gt; goes straight down. It is resemblent of the accelerator hookup.  If
&gt; any one could tell me what these systems are and how to properly hook
&gt; them up I would apreciate it.
&gt;     Thanks.
