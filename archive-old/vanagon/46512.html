Subject:  sticker idea

whoops, i forgot to put this in the last message.

i found an appropriate slogan for a type 2 bumper sticker (for stock type
2s, anyway): 'make your world larger...by going slower'.  credit to
harvey manning, author and wilderness proponent (i saw a picture of
him with this on his t-shirt, don't know if he authored it or not).  i'd buy
one or two if anyone wanted to make these up w/ maybe a list address
on it, but i really just wanted to share the idea.  

kindness, matthew
