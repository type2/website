Subject: Re:  Hatch Struts for 85 Vanagon

Doug -

I have had Suspander (Aut-Fit) Struts on my 80 Vanagon now goin' on 3 years
with no problems.  They did have a bad batch awhile back, but the problem
seems to be solved vis-a-vis blown seals.  Almost all struts coming through
here at Bus Boys and most other FLAPS (including Volkswagen at their
ridiculous price) are being supplied by Aut-Fit in Germany, but without the
Suspander name on them.  Out of hundreds I've sold over the past 3 years,
I've only had 3 or 4 warranty comebacks which we haven't had a problem
getting exchanged.  Most Hydro-Lift Struts are of the Variable-Lift style,
i.e.:  you can put the rear lid into any raised position and it will stay
there.  The trouble with these struts (VW 251829331B Left &amp; 251829332 right)
is that they don't have as long of life as the heavier duty strut (VW
251829331A) which is originally used on models with the rear wiper (rear lid
is heavier).  We only carry the heavier duty strut, but can get the
Variable-Lift style in 24 hours if requested.

My .005 cents worth :)  Jim BusBoys_at_aol_dot_com
