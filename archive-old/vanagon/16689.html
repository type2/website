Subject: Westys with no pop-top
Date: Mon, 1 May 95 15:45:21 PDT

 Someone enquired about later Westfalia campers without the pop-top. I don't 
 know if this will answer your question or not, but the Westfalia manual that
 came with my '74 refers to the pop-top as an option. To me this implies that
 the camper could be had without it and I think Steve Johnson had one like that
 &lt;Steve?&gt; . I recently saw a westy with the '76-'79 interior that had no pop
 top, but I have no way of knowing if it was original or a transplanted 
 camper.

 Hope this helps,

 Dave
