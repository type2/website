hmm... well, since we speak bungee, i hate to state the obvious, BU i 
dont think that the American MegaCorp that tossed the &quot;sport utility&quot; 
vehichle off the bridge would have felt very secure it instead of bungee, 
it was attatched to the bridge with duct tape...hmm..i wonder...sport 
utility vehicle...a BUS, right? hmm..i think i need to find a bridge and 
a BIG bungee....that 74 of mine might not be good for much, but....
