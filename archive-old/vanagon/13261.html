An Ice Hog lives in the Rideau Canal in Ottawa and is responsible for the
holes in the ice on said canal in the winter time. The holes are spaced
every 50 yards or so (as far as I can remember) down the &quot;centerline&quot; of
the frozen canal. Back in '85, after some evening refreshments, I went
skating with some friends and tripped on one of those holes. I am not a
good skater, I am not a native Canadian so I can say this with no shame,
and the best part of that evening was getting the damn skates off of my
aching feet.

Still have very fond memories of Ottawa in the winter and humid summer.

Alistair
