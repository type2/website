Subject: Who Needs an Audi  Bentley manual Wholesale?

I ordered this manual for a person who shall remain nameless, who asked me 
to special order it for him and then decided he didn't want it, leaving me 
stuck with it. I guess I'm lucky; if I'd shipped it, he might have refused 
the COD, leaving me stuck with a manual _and_ a freight bill!  

(On the other hand, of all the personal checks I've taken for Bentley 
manuals, stuff I've ordered for people without deposits, and even 
periodically sent before payment arrived, this is the first time I've been 
&quot;stiffed,&quot;  so I suppose this speaks well of VW addicts as a whole.)

Anyway, the manual covers the '84-87 4000S, 4000CS, and Coupe GT.  About 
1500 pages.  Cover price $95.  Offering it for $55 plus shipping to anyone 
who can use it.  It's a doorstop to me - I don't have an Audi 4000, or know 
anyone who does.

ps.  If this posts twice, forgive me.  I sent it out this morning and it 
never showed up on the list, so I'm sending it again.
