Subject: Re: Syncro trans probs

I'm having a difficult time getting into 1st (not ultra-low) from neutral in 
my '87 Syncro. This makes town driving difficult, since I am using ultra-low 
to 2nd gear shift to get moving. Any one else with this problem? and a 
solution? Is my trans indicating it's about to go south for a vacation. I 
suspect the problem is in the shift lever mounting up front, since I can get 
into rev/ultra-low without pushing down on the stick. I've replaced one 
plastic shift bush near the trans, but no great improvement. This never 
happened in my '85 2WD, wah, why did I sell it?   tim s.


ps: tried the cheap capacitor fix on the fuel injection airbox. 15 min. fix, 
$0.25 price! Maybe things are very slightly smoother/peppier at driving 
speeds, maybe not. Idle still lumpy.
