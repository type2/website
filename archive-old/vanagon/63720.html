Well I subcribed to the v_at_l list a while back when I started looking for a
bus. It helped me evaluate a Vanagon or two while I was shopping and has
been a lot of fun to participate in besides. Alas, last week I found a nice
12V 66 Westy with a strong engine and very little rust and made it mine.
Thanks for the help and good luck to all. I may be back when I add a wedge
someday (I know it will happen eventually).

Till then,
