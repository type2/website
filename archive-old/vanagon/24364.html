Subject: _V_O_L_K_W_A_G_E_N_ emblem removal

	Howdy :
I'm about to repaint the back hatch of my '72 Bus, and I'm wondering how
and if I may safely remove the _V_O_L_K_S_W_A_G_E_N_ emblem that's there
for subsequent post-paintjob replacement. I tried prying off the inside of
the hatch for an internal shot, but succeeded only in leaving marks on
that panel. If it snapped on/in to the hatch at one point, I fear that the
snaps are corroded. Anyone done this before? Any advice is appreciated!
