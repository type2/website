&gt;Does anyone know how to get around the pre-heating problem?

The carb on my bus has been modified somewhat(I think) it has a hose
running from some opening at the top of the fan housing, or the
crankcase, not exactly sure what is under that black plastic box. It was
an attempt at carb preheating, but I think it is sucking cold air, so I
think I need to find another place for the attached hose to run, maybe
under the tin work where the warm air is.

Cheers,
