Subject: Coolant disposal

John Gladu asked about how to dispose of used coolant.  I encountered this
and called the wastewater people who do the Billings water.  At first the
guy wasn't sure whether there would be a problem or not, but that was when
he thought I might have a thousand gallons.  When I told him No, just a few
gallons, he said no problem, just pour it down the drain.  Anybody else
have experience on this?
