Question.....

&gt;How should my fanbelts be routed on the 82 vanagon diesel.

&gt;Should my altornator belt be driven off the waterpump only or a long belt 
&gt;off the crank shaft and waterpump???

You should have two short belts. One belt drives the water pump from the
crankshaft pulley and the other belt drives the alternator from the water
pump pulley.

Don't install any belts any differently - I've been there :-)
