Subject:      Domestic Refrigerator.

Okay, I managed to get my refrigerator out, and armed with all of the
information on the list I figured I'd do a super refrigerator hop-up.

I did the VW tech update to the airpump.
I vacuumed out the combustion chamber and used a bottle brush to clean out
the pipes.
I used silicone thermal goo to adhere the thermostat for the rear fan to
the cooling fins (after checking that the thermostat worked.)
I updated the little fan motor with a 24,000 RPM unit from RadioShack
I used a 3&quot; ring of water heater flue pipe around the fan to better direct
the air.
I placed 2 2&quot; 5.3cfm muffin fans on a special bracket above the interior
fins to blow air over the fins. (wired to the vehicle DC)

So, now I expect that my fridge will work so well, I can use it to store
ice-cream, or leave the door open and cool the vehicle on hot days. &lt;g&gt;

I have not started it up yet - so I'll let everyone know how well all this
tinkering worked.

Thanks to everyone's suggestions. I took photos of what I did, if they come
out I'll post them with the header pictures.
