Subject: Re: poptop seal frustration

Either call Winne directly and try to buy it from them, or maybe they can
tell you who else in your area sells is, or maybe you can buy it mail
order.  Lastly, there may be another dealer who will order it with out full
payment up front.


&gt;subtitle - why the Canadian economy is stagnating.
&gt;
&gt;Today being saturday, I nipped out to do a bit of vanagon related
&gt;shopping and found some great poptop seal material. It is a u-channel
&gt;with a foam rubber wall tube attached at right angles, very much like the
&gt;west coast metric model. What makes this seal special is it is made of a
&gt;very durable looking rubber, even the channel portion (which on the
&gt;westcoast metric model is vinyl). The channel also has a bead of sticky
&gt;sealent pre-installed deep in the recess. It costs Can$2.95/foot, wqhich
&gt;works out to about 50-70 bucks cheaper than the aforementioned WCM stuff.
&gt;Delighted, I bought 2 ft to check out and it fitted wonderfully, the tube
&gt;portion making a better looking top-to-roof seal than the original. Went
&gt;back to the rv store to discover that they only had 12 ft left (I needed
&gt;25). They also told me that the stuff was made by Winnebago. I tried
&gt;other stores, no luck, couldn't find a suitable substitute. Phoned the
&gt;original store to ask if they would order some. They said sure but I
&gt;would have to pay 100% up front. What!!! I talked to the salesperson for
&gt;a while but they wouldn't budge, claiming &quot;company policy on special
&gt;orders from Winnebago&quot;!!
&gt;Going to talk to the manager on Monday, and try other Winne dealers in
&gt;the area.
&gt;
&gt;But those of you out there needing a new seal oughta try the local
&gt;Winnebago RV dealership...
