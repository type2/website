&gt; Then there was the guy at the shop that did her face lift who said:

&gt; &quot;Ya know, it'd be worth more if you painted it the original colors...&quot;

&gt;
&gt; &quot;Well, REAL Volkswagen freaks are into keeping things original!&quot;
&gt;
&gt; &quot;Hmmm, I didn't know I could buy PRE-OXIDIZED tan and white paint!&quot;
&gt;
&gt; &quot;Well...&quot;
&gt;
&gt; &quot;Hey, when a lady goes in for a face lift, does she ask for the
&gt; wrinkles to be put  IN?&quot;
&gt;
&gt; &quot;Well, no!&quot;
&gt;
&gt; &quot;This bus was DOG UGLY the day she rolled off the assembly line... now
&gt; who in their right mind would put this much time and money into her -
&gt; to just turn around and make her DOG UGLY AGAIN?&quot;
&gt;
&gt; With that, he spun on his heel, and continued to grind away on the
&gt; fender of a '95 Ford Explorer.

I will concur, though I do tend to cringe when I see a bus converted into a
snowplow (it's fun watching the passengers bobbing up and down a foot or so
on cupped freeway pavement, though!).  I don't mind tweaking the decor a
little, particularly if it can be undone at some future date when these
puppies really ARE worth something (okay, gonna get torched for that, so
I'll qualify by comparing these eventual prices to the prices/values of
rare pre-war cars in stock condition today).

Bottom line, though, is it's YOUR bus, YOUR cash, and even YOUR life.  Go
for it.

&gt; I actually had a friend come up to me at the sushi bar and ask: &quot;Kath,
&gt; is that your mid-life crisis out there?&quot;
&gt;
&gt; Mid-life crisis? How rude! Why is it... that... just when you figure
&gt; out that it's OK to do something that pleases you, and you just so
&gt; happen to be 46... that some people think you're going through some
&gt; sort of crisis? I believe that creating &quot;Her Majesty&quot; was a
&gt; celebration... not a crisis!

People accused me of going through one of those a few years ago when I
bought a used Thaiyoter Jellybean Van on impulse.  (I'm almost 43, so I'm
almost dead, too).  I felt foolish enough WITHOUT that observation, but
hell.  It was as good an excuse as any, so I concurred. 8^)
