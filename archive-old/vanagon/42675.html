&gt;&gt;Is Camelback a local dealer, or can I get them to send one next-day?
&gt;&gt;Wouldn't that be nice - $20+ for a $3 part.

one phone call later:

=A1Yay!  The local dealer has one in stock!  I don't know why they couldn't
find the correct P/N on their 'fiche last week...

It's waiting for me in the 'special orders' bin.
Ahhh... the fantasies...

Crack!
