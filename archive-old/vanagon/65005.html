Listees,

  I have the S&amp;S exhaust systems too!

  Muffler is, $120.00

  Headers are $160.00, this is for all 4 cylinders!

  On the Headers they make BOTH the 1.9 &amp; 2.1 pipes!!!

  What David has reported on the mileage is TRUE!  These Mufflers will
bolt up to your OE pipes OR the S&amp;S system.


  If anyone needs these let me know.

  Kyle
