Subject: Phoenix trip




All,

Drove up to Phoenix last night to attend AZ Bus Club meeting and
swap parts with Rusty VanBondo.  Meeting was interesting, I'll
probably attempt to organize at least an initial meeting of the
Tucson chapter of the AZ Bus Club, I have the full support of the
parent organization.  Any Tucson vanagon_at_lenti people still out
there besides me?

Jim Ellis's '67 Westfalia &quot;restoration from Hell&quot; is Bee-you-ti-ful!!
Although Jim says the body/paint guy that did the work is a _at_$%#*#,
he ended up doing a great job.  Everything is straight-n-shiney, a
lovely white-over-green.  Also, he's got some of the nice add-on
widgets like safari windshields, and various steps on the outside.
I see many car-show trophys in his future.

All in all an interesting trip (except for the 4 hours of driving :-).

 -Dyer
