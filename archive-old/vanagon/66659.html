Subject:      1998 VW calendar brochure ready to ship

Bonjour !

I have made a nice color brochure to promote my calendar. I can send you as
many copies as you want : give me your snail address.
So far, nobody gave the right answers to the 3-question VW quizz at
http://www.beetle-shop.fr
There is calendar to win !
Enjoy it !
