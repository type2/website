Subject: Re: de-Westy a 73?? $$$

&gt;
&gt;I know people will howl at this question, but I've gotta ask...
&gt;
&gt;I've got a super clean 73 Westy. I just bought the thing from the 
&gt;original owner. It had 145k original miles, 2nd engine in it with about 
&gt;30k on it. Not a speck of rust, garaged.
&gt;
&gt;Well....as it turn out, I need a window van (two actually). So, I'm 
&gt;considering defiling this gal. Pulling off the top and so on. 


Sacrilege! quick hang him!  No offense meant, but isn't a Westy ALSO a 
window van? Filling the hole after pulling off the top would be a chore 
anyhow. Do you really need a 7 seater? You've got 5 now, look for the two 
seater bench that easily bolts down to the floor and go for 6 seats by 
replacing the jump seat. There were 8 seater models, if you're really into 
carpooling. Seriously, a non Westy is worth 1/2 of a westy, often less. Sell 
it to an appreciative owner, come on list folks out there! Swap with this 
man! If I was close I'd make an offer just to save its life. It sounds 
unbelievably great. Want to deliver it to the Maine border?    tim s.

(sold the interior, bus really worth squat now!)
and an '87 Syncro, badly wanting a Westy interior
    (HEY, my 7 seats for your 5 + kitchen sink?)
