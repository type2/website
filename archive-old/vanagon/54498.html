&gt; &gt; Tony,
&gt; &gt; The slave cylinder (the one on the transmission end) is usually the one
&gt; &gt; that fails in extreme cold on Vanagons.  You can get a rebuilt or new
&gt; &gt; one and they even sell rebuild kits, but it's better to get the rebuilt
&gt; &gt; or new slave cylinder.

&quot;They&quot; say, and my personnal experience confirms, that when one cylinder 
in the clutch system fails, the other one is ready to fail too.  In my 
case, the master went bad, and I rebuilt.  Less than 3 months later, the 
slave went!  You might what to order a master rebuild kit to have around, 
&quot;just in case.&quot;
