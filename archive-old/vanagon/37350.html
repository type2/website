Subject:       Re: Splittie with wrong size wheels

&gt; I once had a '65 splittie with high-back '72 bug seats in the front.
&gt; What I remember about the ride was, every time I hit a bump of ANY size,
&gt; my head would slam into the roof. Is this normal for a splittie? Maybe an
&gt; indication of bad shocks?

Same thing on my old '67.  Tried the new shock thing.  Nope.  Still 
bumpy as a herd of turtles.

Local VW guru said.  &quot;Shouldn'ta wasted yer money on them shocks.  
When a front end is shot it's shot, and turns into a rock.&quot;

So that's the way it was.  I lived with it, and I liked it.  Then I 
sold it.  ;-)
