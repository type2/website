Subject: Dripping '86 Vanagon

Hi all!
I have a strange problem with my newly purchased 1986 Vanagon - 
The engine leaks coolant from the bottom of the passenger side cylinder
head.  OK - sounds bad, maybe new head gaskets needed??
The strange thing is that it only drips when cold, and then only if the van
is parked at an angle (on a hill or on axle stands).  I have driven it about
(engine hot), and check each place I stop - and there is no sign of coolant
in this instance.
But when I moved the van this morning (engine cold), then shut off the
engine, I had a small puddle of coolant form (the van was parked on a fair
incline at that time).  I am not sure if a pudle formed overnight since the
Van was parked over grass.
Any ideas?
Thanks in advance
MIKE
