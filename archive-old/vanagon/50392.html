I don't know the official load bearing capacity of the upper berth, but
I've had two adults above many times, with no problems.  The easiest way
to climb into the &quot;attic&quot; without the jump seat is to:
1.  Face the sink and place the left hand on the berth, the right hand on
the roof just by the latch.
2.  Place the right foot on the space just behind the driver's seat
3.  Step up and then place the left foot on top of the sink stove cover,
all the while helping with your arms, and then sit gently on the bunk,
swivel around and go to sleep.

Sweet dreams,
Brian Strange
