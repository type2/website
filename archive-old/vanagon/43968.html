Subject: Wanted: Vanagon table

I am looking for the left wall folding table assemby from a
Carat/Multivan/Wolfsburg edition. While I am primary interested in a
complete assembly, I am a prospect for any of the individual parts as well,
such as the molded left side trim panel, or any of the attachment hardware
unique to this particular table application.

Don't have one, but know where one is? A finder's fee will be offered to any
lead which results in a purchase.

--Doug
