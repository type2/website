Subject:      Re: VANAGON digest 152

Friends.. Is this list great or what?  I'm a tried and true VW Bus driver.
Your basic '71 Camper with few gagets.  I was recently introduced
to a real live Vanagon, up close and personal.  A really sweet '85 rig
with all the goodies.  Anyway, I was stumped when they asked me to look
at the Propane tank relief (release?) valve for re-charge purposes.  I'm
a crack, mechanic, but I don't wanna crack the propane tank trying to turn
something than doesn't turn.  SOOO, I give up.  I looked closely at the
tank and discovered an encrusted sticker, but it was missing key details,
like how to open the relief valve....or is it automatic?  Dunno.
       Searching for meaning,
        Chris
