Subject: Re: Piston Pin

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I am doing a mini rebuild on my 80 vanagon. By mini rebuild I mean I am
&gt; &gt; changing the cylinders and pistions but do not spliting the cranckcase open.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Everything has proceeded well except I can't get the piston pin out.
&gt; &gt; Any suggestions appreciated.
&gt; 
&gt; Need more details.  Can you not get the clip out?  Or the pin itself?
&gt; Which one?  All of them?  On my engine, I did this once with the engine
&gt; in the van and couldn't get the #3 pin out.  I had to grind a small
&gt; notch in the transmission case to get it out.
&gt;

&gt; 

The engine is out of the van. I have also taken the circlip off. The rod
is still hooked up to the cranckshaft. The pin is too tight. And I didn't
want to bang on the pin being still connected to the cranckshaft.

Regards,
Vahid
