&gt;so someone who commutes 30 minutes to work every day  will likely have a
car
&gt;that lasts longer than someone (like me) who lives 6 miles from work and
&gt;takes only 10 minutes to get there. so i go out on the weekends and drive
&gt;down the interstate for 20 miles, then back ... to help get all that crud
&gt;out of my oil. besides ... i just like to ride along in my bus. :)

Circumstances allowing, someone who lives 6 miles from work should ride a
bike or take a bus whenever possible &amp; spare their baby that sort of wear &amp;
tear ;-).
