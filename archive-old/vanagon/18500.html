Subject: 83 Westy questions


I've been read-only for a few months and have gained a lot of T2 knowledge
in that time..thank you!  The more I read, the more I want one!

I've been eyeing a '83 Westy at a local junk yard (they classify it as 
&quot;rebuildable&quot;).  It's taken a hard hit mid-way along the left side, but appears
to have remained straight, as far as I can tell by sight and by making some 
measurements (albeit crude).  The interior damage appears to be restricted to 
some cracked particle board cabinetry and the stove and ref. look ok.  The 
thing that keeps me so interested in this is that it seems to have been taken 
such good care of.  It's very clean and has only 33k miles.  The engine is 
free of any signs of oil or coolant leaks and it just looks great mechanically.

Before I go too far, I'd like to as some questions...

 - There's a seat belt behind the right front seat but no evidence of mounting
   points for a rear-facing seat (as in an 87 Weekender we almost bought).
   Is that what that belt's intended for?  I need that extra seat to keep
   my wife's enthusiasm up, and keep her from dreaming about a Windstar!)

 - Is the '83 known for engine problems any worse than later years (besides the
   head gasket problem)?

 - Any general advise out there?

I look forward to all replies.
