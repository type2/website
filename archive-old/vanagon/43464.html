Subject: '73 Type II alternators

 Hey all you loaf experts!!  I've got a problem with a customer's '73 bus.
Came in with a bad alternator.  R &amp; R'd and got a bad rebuild.  Next
alternator seems to have a longer rotor shaft as the pulley is now out of
line with the crank pulley by about 10mm.  Are there different pulleys?  Or
do I have to change out a perfectly functional unit to keep a belt on it?
Obviously the FLAPS (and the rebuilder) haven't a clue.  Both units have
the same P/N.  Any advise would be appreciated.  Thanks all...
