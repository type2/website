My '87 Westy's heater fan has also just died &quot;again&quot; .  I had it out about
a year or two ago and cleaned and lubed it.  It is a real pain in the ass
to get out.  Remove the dash and remove the heater box and
cut/pry/whatever thr heater box open.  The problem with this unit if
faulty engineering &quot;once again&quot;  The fan motor head end bearing is right
in the path of the fresh air coming in from the front of the van along
with all the debris that's in the air .  No protection for this poor
little bearing was engineered by the gracious folks at VW.  Thanks once
again !  I have not taken mine apart yet but when I do I will get either
new bearings somewhere or a new motor AND try to engineer some means of
protecting this bearing, this time arouind I will win !

Cheers

Frank
