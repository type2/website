I have not been blessed to need something specifically like this ... yet 
but I've had similar custom work done at a marina.

Near any decent marina or boat yard you'll find a firm or someone who makes 
custom-fit items for the water-borne society.

Another possible source would be to seek a reputable auto upholstery shop; 
one that makes custom interiors and perhaps even convertable tops.
