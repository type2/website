&gt; To All:
&gt; 
&gt; When we encounter a poorly designed part, and the only replacement is
&gt; ridiculously expensive and probably no stronger than the original, we should
&gt; organize a small group to obtain one good part, make a mold to produce a wax
&gt; casting, the use the lost-wax process to produce a hundred or so out of
&gt; vanadium steel by investment casting, passing the cast-but-unfinished part
&gt; along to other van owners for whatever it takes to cover out of pocket
&gt; expenses.
&gt; 
&gt; Making this idea work is no more difficult than producing knoves in wholesale
&gt; lots (and also works for false teeth).
&gt;

&gt; 

What is a knove?

Are we talking about the white metal out side handle or the inner plastic one?  
I have the problem with the inner one that is plastic with a metal mould 
around insert.  I've been looking for some slow cure epoxy so I could mould 
a new one off of the broken part.  All the epoxy that I can find these days is 
the 5 minute stuff which is useless. Used to be able to get it in hobby shops 
about 15 years ago when I was into model aircraft but can't find it now.  
Anyone got a lead on this stuff?

Thanks

Andy Burczyk
