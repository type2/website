Subject: Power window in Westie '91 does not operate 

I would appreciate any help pointing me to the right archive or article
describing how to remove or unfroze the electrical power window motor
from the right front door. Power reaches the switch and the drivers side
window works fine. It is my wifes van and she has not used the right
window in many months. I suspect it is frozen and planned on
disasembling the motor, checking it out, greasing it, puting it back
together and hopefuly fix the situation unless the motor is shoot. All
of this , of course, once I figure out how in the world to get the motor
out of the door or disconecting the cables that lift and lower the
window. 

Help and suggestions are welcomed and apreciated !
