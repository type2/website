Subject: Re: hmm, is this bad? could it hurt?(lost spark plug)

&gt;hey now,
&gt;
&gt;hmm, when changing my spark plugs today one fell out of the ratchet and back
&gt;into the spark plug housing. i tried to get it out with pliers but only
&gt;succeeded in pushing it back where i can't even see or feel it. i shrugged and
&gt;put the new plug in, started up the engine and went to work. i'm extremely
&gt;paranoid now. could that spark plug in there do major harm? how do i get it
&gt;out?

When this happened to me, I went out and got one of those &quot;tool grabber&quot;
deals, the flexible thing, where you push a button on one end and on the
other four claw-like things open up.  After much perserverance, I was able
to fish it out.  Fortunately, a spark plug has lots of little thing to grab
on to.

Good luck,
Eric
