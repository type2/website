Subject: Re: 92 Eurovan transmissions

&gt;Hi...I'm new to this list but have heard through the grapevine that there are a
&gt;few folks having to replace transmissions on their 92/93 Eurovans for about
&gt;$7000. Anybody heard any other horror stories about these things?

When our EV was new (summer before last)  we had a problem with hard
shifting.  It would really &quot;thunk&quot; when the gears changed.  Dealer replaced
a valve that was defective, probably shipped that way according to him.  No
problem since.  I discussed the transmission with the technician because of
its complexity.  He said it was no less reliable than others VW has used.
Is this much of a recommendation?  IAE, we have had no tranny problems
since that valve was replaced under warranty. None of the other owners that
I know have had problems either.
