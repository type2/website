&gt;Has anyone replaced the distributor assembly in a 2.1 syncro digifant? 
&gt; Where  did you get your part?  I got a quote for a rebuilt bosch unit from 
&gt;Trak Auto for ~$176.  Sound in the ballpark?  The local mech quoted me $600+

&gt;for  a new unit.

I seriously doubt the distributor is bad.  There is no advance mechanism in
it and play in the assembly is normal as long as it is not side to side.
