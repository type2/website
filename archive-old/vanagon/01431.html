Subject: Re: Front end sitting too high.

various folks have contributed:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; 	The front end on my 1977 Bus sits way too high. I've been
&gt; &gt;&gt; scanning through Muirs book, but have yet to run across the cause or
&gt; &gt;&gt; solution. A hint will earn you twelve Karma points :-).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I would guess the back is low, rather than the front high. To fix it you'd
&gt; &gt;need to adjust or replace the rear torsion bars. It's probably not worth it.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; If you want a balanced look you could always lower the front. Best way seems
&gt; &gt;to be to get a sway-a-way front end which I understand changes the position
&gt; &gt;of the stops for the torsion bars.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; This happened to my '73 and had me stumped for a while. There was no way I could
&gt; think of that the front end could get higher by itself, although that's how it
&gt; appeared because the back end didn't seem to be lower than other buses I looked 
&gt; at. This is what I think happened. The other bus's suspension had sagged with
&gt; age by an equal amount front and back but mine had only sagged at the back. 
&gt; Don't try lowering the front, it's a major job. Sway-a-ways don't fit the bus 
&gt; beam and the adjusters that do are both expensive and difficult to install. 
&gt; It's 
&gt; not such a complicated job to adjust the rear spring plates on the torsion bars 
&gt; but it can be hard work levering them off and getting them back on again.

My experiences with this (on Bobo, my `74 Transporter) have shown that it
-may- be that the rear is too low, but it might also just be that the front is
too high...

When I bought my bus (4 years ago) I asked the previous owner why the front
end was so high and he told me that he had tried raising the rear.  He'd
adjusted the torsion bars but then the CV joints had made noise so he'd
adjusted them back.  Since I wasn't convinced that he knew what he was doing I
took it to a garage and they did the same thing: raised the torsion bars in
back by one notch each side and reported that the CVs then growled going
around corners so they put it back.  One of the guys there said it was normal
for the Transporters to stand this high in front; that they had all looked
like that when new.  I don't know if this is true or not, but I know that Bobo
has had (at least) one front-end accident by previous owners and I suppose
that the torsion bars might have been replaced with new, unsagged ones.
*shrug* who knows?

In any case, take a look at the normal position of the wheel suspension when
nobody is in the bus.  Where is the wheel in relation to the two rubber
stopper bumper-thingies?  On Bobo, when he's empty, the wheel is resting
against the top bumper.  When I have two people up front (especially if one of
them is my 200+ lb friend!  :) ) the wheel is positioned about in the middle
between the two bumpers and I can use my rear-view mirror.  My supposition is
that this is normal for a Transporter and, as you add weight (as in camping
furniture a la poptops), the bus gets more level.

So, your solutions as I see them are: get a lowering kit from Bus Boys; get
300 pounds of lead sheeting (you could use gold instead!) and plate the floor
up front; make lots of heavy friends and try to keep one with you at all
times; or live with it, which is what I'm doing! :)

Hope this adds some perspective, albiet from what angle? ;-)
