Excellent! But for me you left out one important bit of info. If you put
all these materials in a pile, how much would they weigh? I know the
fiberglass isn't much but what about the asphalt items?

&gt;The interior is now basically complete in Suzy's van. In a future
&gt;(HUGE)
&gt;posting I will share all of the secrets of soundproofing, rustproofing
and
&gt;thermal insulating. For now, check these unbeleivable stats. Suzy's van

&gt;Four cans of polyurethane expansion foam sealant
&gt;Four gallons of &quot;Kool Patch&quot; undercoating

&gt;insulation
&gt;Eight yards of 4-mil plastic
&gt;A &quot;Dual Trumpet&quot; 135 db air horn, (okay, that's actually OUTSIDE the
van)
