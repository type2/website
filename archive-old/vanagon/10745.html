Subject: Still need '85 Manual 

I remain in need of a copy of the 1985 Vanagon manual.  Apparently there are
none left (at least that is what my dealer informs me) at the parts
warehouse.  I don't need the Westy Supplement.

Any help on this would be greatly appreciated.  One person offered to copy
his for me and... well it never happened. hint hint.... :-)
