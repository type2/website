&lt;&lt;      I have noticed that my front inboard CV joint boot is torn.:-(  
 I have checked the archieves and could'nt find a reference to a good source.
 I bought the outboard boots from VW, and I dont want to pay that much again,
   &gt;&gt;

I may be wrong, but aren't the front inners and all the rears the same?  And
aren't they the same as the rears on all 1968 to 1991?  I know the front
outters are different and very co$tly, too.
