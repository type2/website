So Derek Drew says:
&gt; 
&gt; What I have tried is this: I have disconnected the ground strap from the
&gt; battery and incerted an LED under the theory that the LED would be lit if
&gt; there was a current draw in the system somewhere. (The LED is attached on
&gt; one side to the battery and the other side to the disconnected ground wire).
&gt; Unfortunately, the LED seems to be lit all the time, even when I disconnect
&gt; every fuse. 

Are you sure you got every fuse?  I'm not so sure your elemenating every path
back to the positive side of the battery.  What about the starter circuit?
I really haven't looked at my '91's electrical schematic yet, but I'll bet
there's a fuse/circuit you're not including in your test.
