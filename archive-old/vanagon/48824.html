Subject: Re: Replacing Rear Westie Speakers (oh boy...)


&gt;Getting to the door mounted speakers weas 
&gt;easy (once I found the secret screw!), but oh, man do I not have a 
&gt;clueas to how to get the speakers out of the AC bulkhead. This 
&gt;probably would not be so hard if I didn't have AC, but I do and it 
&gt;looks like I'm going to have to do some major work! Anybody done 
&gt;this 
&gt;before? ANy suggestions?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;

I've had the opposite problem - got the speakers out of the 
bulkhead but did not know about the &quot;secret screw.&quot; 
Where is it?

On my '85 ('87 may be different, I don't know) the back of the 
speaker has a large collar that screws around the speaker to hold 
it in place.  Removed the A/C vent, reached in, held the speaker 
firmly while unscrewing the collar from behind, and the speaker 
popped right out.  Then I chisled the integrated speaker off of the 
factory grill, mounted high performance speakers behind the hole, 
and fit the factory grills sans original speakers into the hole 
from the front, to maintain the &quot;factory&quot; look and hopefully reduce 
the risk of theft.
