Subject: next CCC's...


When I get 5 messages in one day inquiring about the next CCC's outing, I
guess it's time to start organizing something.  A few of you have proposed
the first weekend in January for our next meet, as this is the anniversary
of the first time we ever did this sort of thing.  That was at Big Sur, which
might otherwise be a likely spot, but many have expressed disappointment that
there are too many rules and regulations there for the likes of our group,
and that perhaps another location would be better.

Does the date seem OK for most of you?

Next, we need nominations for a site?

Thirdly, since this will be the mid of winter, I can already hear whining
coming from some of you about the cold, blah, blah, blah.  Should we try
something new and all get together and maybe rent a cabin up in the
mountains?  Input/votes?

Joel Walker and David Schwarze - you guys ARE driving out again for this one,
right?  :)

 Current lust list: DC/12v coffee-grinder &amp; blender, a Eurovan TDI transporter,
  black currant juice, a moped, hot showers and a faucet top for my '81 westy,
   and last but not least:  a pair of those old-fashioned metal roller-skates,
    made, I think, by Winchester (but any would do) - the kind which fasten
     onto the outside of your shoes and are length- and width-adjustable
      with a metal key.  They have leather straps for the ankle.  They were
       very popular in the 60's.
