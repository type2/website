so, in an attempt to remedy my missing dimmer, i dissassembled the turn
signal/dimmer switch. if you ever decide you might want to do this,
don't...it does not go back together.  anyway, a new one is $80, so i
bought a three position toggle and made it control my turn signals.  even
got it to install in the collar that used to hold the switch.  

so, here's the question. i also bought i little switch that when you press
in on it, it completes a circuit, when you let go it breaks it.  it i run
a wire from each termianl on this to the control terminals on the dimmer
relay, will it conrtol the lights?  i do not want to merely flash the
lights.  i want it function the same way the old switch did.

i guess i ought to mention that we're discussing a '73 here.
