Don't count on it, pal.  Neither the Great Galvo nor the 
Bushrat has succumbed to the heady temptations of the pint 
glass.  Our get-togethers are sober and *very* foody.  Now, if 
you like pizza...

Anyway, it looks like the great Irish Vanagon-list get-together 
is set for next Friday evening.

Place :  Numero Uno Pizza take-away,
         Barrack Street, Ennis, Co. Clare.
         (beside the Clare Champion office)

Time  :  9.00pm GMT.

Bring :  Money for pizza and coca-cola (Transporters must be 
driven)



How to get there (esp. for North Americans)
----------------
 
First, go to your nearest airport.  Catch flight to JFK.  Go to 
Aer Lingus or Delta terminal and book flight to Shannon.  
(Don't go to Dublin.  You'll get mugged.)  Spend seven hours in 
'plane.  Watch a movie or something. Visit the charming 'indoor 
outhouse'.  Land at Shannon. (Another indoor outhouse.) Go to 
the public telephone in the arrival hall.  Ring 29691 and pray 
that I choose to answer the 'phone.  If I do, state who you are 
and what you are doing in a foreign country.  Wait 20 minutes 
while I drive to the airport to getcha.

To get to Numero Uno from beautiful Shannon Airport 
(celebrating 50 years), take the only road from Shannon until 
you come to a sign which says
 '  &lt;-- ENNIS' 
and go left (hence the arrow).  Drive through the beautiful 
green, wet, cow-filled rural landscape.  Marvel at the numerous 
beautiful hacienda-style ranchhouse bungalows, sporting 
'accomodation' signs.  Drive straight through 
Newmarket-on-Fergus, a rotten little hole of a town :O and 
continue north.  About 16 miles later, you'll reach the 
glittering metropolis of Ennis, the vibrant and entertaining 
capital of County Clare, where you can play the local sport of 
dodging the manic drivers of stupid little Japanese tin-cans.  
Wonderful!  Turn right at the third set of traffic lights and 
immediately take the next right, then stop!  Numero Uno is the 
tiny place on the right, beside the double gates.  Please be 
pleasant to the staff, as they are doing their best and some of 
'em are Scottish.  We'll be waiting in the car park across the 
road in the back of my Transporter (the blue one with the bent 
bullbar and huge grey scratch on the sliding door (unless I 
collected you at the airport.  Then you;ll already be in the 
van. (you see?)))  We'll then travel in convoy to Galvo's house 
where Shelly (his lovely missus) (hi, Shelly) will ask Galvo to 
make delicious freshly ground coffee for the guests.  I'll 
bring a pack of choccy bikkies and a videotape of Tazmania.

CAN YOU AFFORD TO MISS THE VANAGONDOLIERS' BEST ADVENTURE OF 
1995?
BOOK *N*O*W* TO AVOID DISAPPOINTMENT!  TRANSPORTERS WILL BE 
ALLOCATED 
PLACES ON A STRICTLY FIRST COME - FIRST SCRATCHED BASIS.

PRIZE TO BEST-DRESSED TRANSPORTER : Galvo's scotty-dog Mac in 
the loading deck of your just-vacuumed van for ten minutes so 
he can leave a large 'log' for good-luck.  I can heartily 
recommend this (right, John????)

So ... who's comin'?   :)
