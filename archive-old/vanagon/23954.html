Subject: Checking out an engine (was: $50 Engine)



&gt;Thanks, Steve, I'll check into it...course, I won't be walking away from
&gt;this deal. BTW, the engine's never even been in a vehicle since it was
&gt;rebuilt. If you were in my shoes, how would you check it out (once you
&gt;got it home, of course)?


Hell, just bolt it in, and go. I wish I had such problems!  :)

It would be nice to do a compression check first, but an engine that's
been &quot;rebuilt&quot; (sort of) can have several things wrong, and still show
good on a compression check. Besides, this is usually done by cranking
it over with the starter, and the starte's mounted on-- you guess it--
the transmission, which is still in the bus. Some VW freaks have a
cut-out bellhousing from a tranny, which bolts to the engine and mounts
the starter, just for such compression checks.

A few things you CAN do, now that I think on it--

I assume the flywheel is installed. If not, skip to the next test. If
it is, grab the pulley on the other end of the crankshaft (back of the
engine, the part you see when you open the hatch). Pull it back HARD,
not quite enough to drag the engine across the floor. Then push forward
HARD, and do that a few times. You're checking the flywheel end play--
this should shift the crankshaft back and forth a VERY TINY amount--
from .002&quot; to .004&quot;.

Yes, that's thousandths, like the thickness of a human hair. Takes a
gauge to measure it, but the rule of thumb is, if you can just barely
feel it moving, you're probably OK. If the movement is obvious, like
the thickness of a fingernail, better get it checked.

This play can be adjusted by inserting shims of the correct thickness
between the flywheel and the end of the crank. If the play is a whole
lot, the engine has big problems-- the part of the case that holds the
crankshaft thrust bearing is badly worn, or maybe the bearing is not
installed properly. Either way, the engine must be torn down completely.
If it's worn, then you may need to buy a new crankcase-- $$!

Excessive end play can cause the engine to push its front main oil seal
out of its seat, and the engine will begin to leak oil badly, usually all
over the clutch. Not good! For some aerodynamic reason (I guess), this
oil will stay in the bellhousing if you're going above about 20 MPH.
But when you slow down for that stop sign, you leave a very characteristic
trail of  drip     drip   drip drip dripdripdripBIGPUDDLE! about 5 to 10
feet long. Guess how I know!  :(

This bearing seat should have been spec'd during the rebuild (or the
case already replaced!). But some people just bolt on new pistons,
cylinders, and maybe heads; and call it rebuilt, without ever even
splitting open the crankcase. Runs fine until, on some dark and dreary
night, you find the clutch in your lap.


The second test (skip to here if no flywheel), is to grab the generator
pulley (or the crank pulley if no gen belt yet), and turn it by hand. It
will take some sweating-- if the engine is properly rebuilt, it will be
pretty stiff to turn the new bearings and rings. BTW, a spark plug socket
and wrench, fits the gen nut perfectly-- makes turning the engine a little
easier. Turn it clockwise.

As you turn, you'll push one piston up on its compression stroke (oomph!).
Listen closely for a hissing sound from one of the exhausts as you turn.
If you hear one piston noticeably louder than the rest (it takes two
complete turns of the big crank pulley to do all four pistons), then you
may have a burned, cracked, or mis-seated exhaust valve. All these should
have been taken care of in any decent rebuild, but...

That's all for now-- hope this helps!
