Subject: Re: Hoo Boy! (Was: Corrado Powered Westy Syncro -


SM&gt;What displacement is the Corrado engine? Torque? Max RPM? Is it naturally
SM&gt;aspirated? Supercharged? Anything that makes more torque, will benefit
SM&gt;the bus immensely.  Too bad it doesn't have a tranny that takes advantage
SM&gt;of that extra torque-- VW obviously had no need to design one back then.
SM&gt;The V6anagon does accelerate quickly-- one of the reasons it's such fun to
SM&gt;drive. And so will that Corrado-powered beast, I'm sure.

SM&gt;In fact (speculation here) is the Corrado engine is fairly small (2000cc
SM&gt;or less, say), and makes its 200 HP by turning really fast, then this
SM&gt;might be right up the bus's alley. Might not have the low-end torque
SM&gt;that larger-displacement engines can supply, but once you get moving,
SM&gt;watch out.

1.8 liter, G60 is the name for the supercharger that resides on the
beast, stock 158hp at something about 5500 rpm, torque nearly to
match but soft on the bottom.  As I said would be right at the place
to have a G60 strongly in its power range but unfortunately mileage
would be to put it lightly CRAP.  Does spin up quickly but cranking up
a 2700 lb sport coupe is a bit different from getting 4500 lb of Wanagon
a movin.  The 2 diesels I have seen with GTI engines both turned a
bit too fast, mileage was under 20.  With the supercharger increasing
mileage (Corrado gets 32+ routinely) I don't know.  Sure would be neat
is all I'll say.  Stock is about 12 psi boost, smaller pulley to spin
the
charger faster, a cam, ship, higher fuel pressure regulator, will net
210+ hp.  Longetivity of G60's is a bit sketchy and I wonder what laying
one on its side will do?  Oh a chip alone with an efficient exhaust
should
put it in the 165hp range for a couple $100.
