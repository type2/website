first bus I ever &quot;had&quot; (Dad's) was a fire engine red 1963
that we modified, as follows:

we painted the small raised band that goes along both sides
and the back, plust much of the front that is, shall we say,
topographically similar with gold paint into which we sprinkled
glass beads of the sort used in road striping.

made for a very fetching vehicle, if I do say myself, and,
of course, unique
