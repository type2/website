Subject: Looking for Late Model Vanagon

I am looking for a Late Model Vanagon and have seen several Westy
campers but no Vanagons...  I may be wrong but I don't thing the camper
has the center seat.  I have 5 children and need the seating.  The
camper would be nice if I could add the seating.  My camping needs would
not require the sink and other stuff... But the two beds would be nice.

Also, in terms of a reliable vehicle is a Vanagon really the way to go. 
The gas milage does not seem like much of an advantage of most of the
popular mini-vans and I seem to be reading about a lot of problems.  I
had a 73 transporter and enjoyed it very much... but was a lot younger
and willing to put up with more problems...

Any comments
