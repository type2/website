There was an ad in DBHVW's last month for heater mods.  I couldn't 
quite get it all, or wasn't interested at the moment, but these people
sell something that modifies an existing system to reuse the interior 
air and I suppose it has a fan to blow the heat around.  As I say, I 
didn't read it all.  Their basic system was around $180 with upgrades 
for buses or something.  It was a fullpage ad on the right hand side. 
I have a selective photographic memory.  Anyone know what I'm talking 
about or have experience with these people?  It might not be a whole 
lot different from what some of you are already doing.  Jim
