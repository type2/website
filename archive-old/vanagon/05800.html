Subject: Mice--round 2

I remember a thread on mice in Busses a while back--
maybe I should have paid more attention.  Yesterday
the newly (and expensively) repaired gas heater 
in the '79 caught fire because a bunch of damn mice 
built their *#!^&gt;_at_! nest in the heat chamber!
No serious damage, thankfully, (the Bus stinks to
high heaven now, but I can deal with that...)

At the risk of repetition, is there any reasonable
way to mouse-proof things?  Leave poison peanuts
in the spare tire well?  Shut Dudley the cat in
overnight?  Seriously, any ideas?  I nearly had
a stroke over this.
