Subject: FS: '93 EV Westie $17.4K

     I don't know my Eurovan differences, but that is what the
     ad said, and was confirmed by the seller (a dealer).

     He also said: Loaded, 29K miles, white color, grey interior.
     Contact Fred Stoner _at_ (703) 218-4669. Its in Fairfax
     VA, near Washington. I'd be glad to help out any remote
     control buyers on the list.
