Hi All: Once in awhile when I need something different to do I go over
to Portland (OR.) and snoop around in some of the pawn shops there. Snap
On tools are a big item there. As a rule they are 50% of book in price.
Of course it is hard to tell how much of the stuff is hot and that makes
you a little hesitant, but the shops are supposed to check ID and try to
watch for that when they buy the tools. A couple of years ago I bought a
250 pound Snap-On torque wrench that was less than a year old for half
of book price. I got the original Snap-On sales receipt that they gave
the original owner. He was the guy that sold it to the shop, so I know
it was not stolen.   Todd
