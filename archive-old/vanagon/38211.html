For shallow, broad dents, I've had some success with this idea, but
soldered, not welded or brazed.  Use a propane torch and watch the heat.  I
read about this in some antique car magazine.  Take a penny and braze a
piece of welding rod at the center, solder the assembly to the dent, and
pull with vice grips.

If the dent is really broad and shallow, a wet plunger will sometimes work, too!
