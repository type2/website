&gt;Anybody know if the U-joint is really a replaceable and available part,
&gt;and if there's an OEM equivalent?  Alternatively, has anybody out there
&gt;who has replaced their driveshaft know the part number and/or cost of a
&gt;new one?  (Or got the old one still hanging around with a U-joint left
&gt;on it ;-) ?  No doubt these are hard-to-find items at *any* price.

&gt;Larry thanks you in advance...

Larry,
4x4 owners seem to do alot of modifications to their drivelines and there are
a fair number of shops that specialize in custom driveshafts.  I bet one of
these places would be able to find a replacement part if one is available.
 Or maybe make you a whole new setup is necessary.  You can find ads for
these places in 4x4 magazines like &quot;Four Wheel Drive &amp; Sport Utility&quot;
magazine.  Good luck.
