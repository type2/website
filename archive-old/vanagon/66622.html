I just bought a 1991 Westfalia here in Vancouver.HOURRA!!!
 After months of researches and worries, I finally got it. Thanks to all
of you who helped me...I took my first picnic in it tonight...by the
Pacific...under a pouring rain...was great...and runs great too.
After having tried and camped a Winnebago 95 (I rented it once), I find
the design of the Vanagon Westy much better (tables are not in the way
when installed and children can draw and use the table while having
their sealt belt on). A special thanks to Harry Yates and Ron le coyote.
