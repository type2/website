&gt; The problem is the only source I have been able to find for the exhaust pipes
&gt; have been the dealer.  Does anyone know of a source for these pipes with
&gt; reasonable prices?  My front pipe, cat &amp; exhaust are good.  I just need the
&gt; rear pipe and the pipe that the O2 sensor screws into.
