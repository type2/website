Tony;
Try this. Hook a voltmeter to the output of your oxygen sensor.Do not
break the circuit.  Set on a low scale to read a maximum of 1.5 volts. I
am betting you will see the voltage fluctuate in coincidence with the
RPMs. Why you are seeing it now or if it is a bad thing I do not know.
I have noticed that the O2 sensor output on our 85 GL (digijet FI)
fluctuates much slower than our 86 (digifant FI).
Maybe check air filter, spark plugs, etc.
Good Luck

&gt;Good morning!
&gt;
&gt;Well, along with the cold weather comes strange behavior from the bus! 
&gt;The
&gt;problem isn't serious at all yet, just curious and would like to 
&gt;prevent
&gt;any problems.
&gt;
&gt;As the subject says, my bus is idling strange, whether warm or cold. 
&gt;It's
&gt;almost like you lightly touch the gas pedal every second or so. The
&gt;rev/idle is very consistent and rhythmic. It doesn't seem to effect 
&gt;the
&gt;drivability at all and doesn't stall when idling for extended periods, 
&gt;say
&gt;10 minutes.
&gt;
&gt;Any advice/comments?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks!
&gt;
