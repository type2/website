&gt; No newsgroup.  We like it a 
&gt;&gt;mailing list.
&gt;
&gt;Not all of us.  I'd prefer a newsgroup, and the threading that news
provides.

Me too.  I'd prefer to visit with you fine folks in newsgroup format.  I get
confused with my cousins' E-mail getting all mixed up with you all.  A direct
reply looks just like a posting until you open it up.  I enjoy this list
immensely but I find the newsgroup works better for the kind of posting that
is done here.  JMHO.  :-)
