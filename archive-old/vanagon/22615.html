Howdy!

	Well, I got the new muffler in.  I didn't feel like stripping 
all the paint off and re-painting it, so I put it on as is.

	Getting the old one off was easy 'cause A) it hadn;t been on but
for a few months, and B) I used antisieze compound on the studs last time.
Took about 5 minutes to get the old muffler off.

	I used liberal amounts of anti sieze compound on all the bolts
and studs on this one, too.

	One thing about the original mufflers is they fit so much better
than the aftermarket ones - this one just slipped right on!  (its a
Leistritz, which sounds a lot like &quot;last rites&quot; to me.

	Anyway, it took about 20 minutes to get the thing completely on.
I put new fresh air hoses on too.   I had to get the little collar dohickes
too.  And another thing: Are the pass-thru jobbers (with the opening on top
and bottom, going to the heater boxes) s'posed to be wobbly?  I don't like
it.  I'm gonna tack weld them down to the pipe.

	The other thing I had to do was &quot;port&quot; the input pipe - there
was some welding slag in it, so I used a die grinder and ground it out.
I also had to clearance the rear apron a little cause the paint was getting
burned. :(

	The bus seems quieter, heck it _is_ quieter.  It seems to have 
better power, too.  And the bus doesn't sound like its straining anymore.
I'd recommend this over those funky headers for a stock motor.  I think the
bus looks better, too, without this big rusty thing sticking out from
underneath!
