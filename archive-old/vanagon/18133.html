Subject: Re: Westy Pop-Tops in the wind

I also have a '71 pop top.  It used to pop up on the freeway all the 
time, and i even had those aftermarket rubber hold-downs.  One day it 
really popped up high and i noticed that one of the hollow aluminum cross- 
poles on the front left hinge was broken (this could be the snap that you 
heard).  Anyway, i replaced the hinge from a junkyard ($25.00) and have 
had no problems since.  Check your hinges.

Good luck,
Ted

&gt; When I first got my 1971 westy I never had a problem with wind messing with
&gt; the pop-top, and cringed when I saw other westies with hold down devices on
&gt; the front of their tops.  I had quickly replaced the rubber trim around the
&gt; base of the top and also the rubber flap that seals it to the rear luggage
&gt; rack area and felt this was the proper way of solving the problem.  Then,
&gt; one day, as I was opening the top, I heard a rather metallic snap from the
&gt; front.  Since then I have consistently had the wind be able to lift the top
&gt; off the car at speed.  I have joined the unfortunates who must use exterior
&gt; devices to make sure it doesn't flap up and down in the wind.  I'm using a
&gt; strap over the top attached to holes drilled in the rain gutter.  Eww.  I
&gt; actually think even if my top hadn't popped something, that I would
&gt; eventually, given a high enough wind, still have this problem.  I've looked
&gt; up front and can't really see anything broken either.  I tie the inside of
&gt; the top down with rope at the old rubber hold down locations, since I don't
&gt; trust them for doo-doo.  
&gt; 
&gt; Comments?
