Subject: Misc. Friday fodder

Just saw media exposure relating to the opening of the Rock and Roll Hall of
Fame Museum and Concert. Huge crowd. 72-ish westy on the back of a tow truck
right in the fore ground. Yeah, let's see the Porsche list get THAT kinda
exposure!

ABSOLUTELY SERIOUS:
I located a pile of Foreign Car Digest magazines. This pub must have been
the reason for all of the hacked up VWs.

Found an old article in the September *1962* Foreign Car Digest Magazine
relating to the proper way to hack up your splitty's dash with a ten cent
compass, 1/4&quot; drill bit and a round hack saw blade. Goal was to install guages.
 
Another article shows how to cut windows into a $250.00 junkyard barndoor
panel for a &quot;quick camper&quot; conversion. Double Ugh!! The $250. figure was
explained as being a bit on the expensive side. Yeah right. 

Yet another article shows the installation of peanut turn indicators onto a
split window type I. Updating the bug included removal of the semaphores.
Just throw those worthless Mothers into the dust bin.
