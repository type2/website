Subject: Re: Directional Signals

I thought about doing the hole bit to drain it, but was trying to hold 
out for some type of adter market gasket.  I didn't want to use any 
sealant as then it would be a pain to try and change the bulb.  I was 
thinking more in terms of possibly cutting pieces out of an ordinary 
rubber gasket to make some type of seal.

&gt; &gt;&gt;Has anyone had a problem with the front turn signal(amber) housings
&gt; &gt;&gt;filling with water after a heavy rain?  Ours has filled on several
&gt; &gt;&gt;occasions causing corrosion of the wires and damage to the bulb socket.
&gt; &gt;&gt;Does anyone know if a good after market gasket is made to fill in the
&gt; &gt;&gt;small space between the body and the lamp housing?  Thanks!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Lewis,
&gt; &gt;Please let me know if someone posts a solution to this directly to you.  I
&gt; &gt;have the same problem on my '73.
&gt; 
&gt; one quick and very dirty solution is to remove the turn signal lens and
&gt; drill a small 1/8&quot; hole in the bottom edge of the lens housing ... to allow
&gt; the water to drain out.
&gt; 
&gt; note that this does NOT &quot;solve&quot; the problem, but only allows the water to
&gt; exit ... so it cuts down on the corrosion.
&gt; 
&gt; one solution would be to hit the junkyards and see what you could find, or
&gt; buy some tubes of rubber gasket stuff, make a big bead of it around the
&gt; back of the housing, let it set up and dry, then put the housing back on.
