&gt;Marc,
&gt;  Now you might not classify your 78 as a &quot;Classic&quot; but someday it will be.
&gt;If you cut a hole in the body to get to the sender, it will be cut up junker
&gt;someday. NEVER CUT A HOLE!!!! Wait until you have the motor out and then
&gt;fix the sender. Remember you have a responsibility to our children.
&gt;
I second this sentiment, though to each his own.  I would like to say that
it IS possible to get the tank out (barely) without cutting a hole or dropping
the engine.  I did it once on a 2.0L '78.  You have to remove the induction
system (FI if it still has it, progressive Weber in the one I did) and take
off the distributor cap and rotor.  Then support the REAR of the engine with
a jack and remove the bolts holding the rear engine support and allow the
back of the engine to drop a couple of inchs.  You can then just barely get
the tank in and out.  There are some tubes connected to the top of the tank,
the wires for the sender, and on the bottom are two fuel lines.  (Of course,
don't forget to drain the tank first!)
