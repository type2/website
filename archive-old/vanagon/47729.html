Some real interesting ones this month

'53 barn door single cab (well not really a barn
door I guess) smooth gate, no rust complete $8500
(541)770-7411 OR

'58 single cab, 90% resto, $7500 (941)923-5934 FL

'60 Westy, near perfect, $7900 (941)956-1004 FL

'61 van $700 (914)336-7927 NY

'62 dbl cab, complete need resto $2600 (314)524-600 MO

'63 sunrf deluxe, origional paint, no rust $6500
(541)770-7411 OR

'64 sgl cab, 1600cc, restored, $9000 (317)462-9137 IN

'66 Sundial Camper (I guess this is a van) tent,
roof rack, nice, $6600 (408)393-9329 CA

'67 camper, very good, origional paint, clean interior
service records, $7500 (201)702-7584 NJ

'68 bus, 5k on engine, many new parts, excellent $5500
(816)831-0326 MO

'68 restored sacrifice (?????) $6000 (215)536-6191 PA

'69 single cab, ex cond, 20k engine $7500 (803)796-4526 SC

'69 camper, 61k, excellent, gas heater, tent, extras $5500
(maybe the first reasonable price if nice) (215)572-7626 PA

'72 dual sliding door (REAL NEAT, eat this Caravan) 61k
white excellent condition, make offer (212)864-6525 NY
(I always wanted one of these, shame I just bought the '81)

'74 Westy, blah, blah, blah, $8500 (708)445-9881 IL

'77 Westy, blah, blah, blah, $10000 (603)675-5185

On these last two, I got to say, get real, my '77
is absolutely mint, analy maintained, paint gorgeous,
rear interior like new, front seat are the only worn
part, others on this list can concur.  I paid $3800
which I thought was a lucky buy, I feel I might sell it
for $5500 if lucky.  Anyone asking over $5000 for a loaf
is simply ridiculous, my opinion, I've looked a lot of
vans I know a fair or good deal comes around.  Hell a
'77 camper didn't cost more than $8500 new I'd guess and
that only maybe if it had say A/C or a gas heater.  $10k
with 65k miles, get a reality check.

'82 westy diesel (another dreamer been advertising for
like 1/2 a year) $6500 (717)921-2644 PA

'86 Syncro 145k, rebuilt tranny, new CV's, maintained
(914)246-0321 NY

NOW THE NEAT ONE, I WISH YOU COULD SEE THE PICTURE OF
THIS THING.

'82 VW LT45TD, 4wd camper, 6 cyl Vovlo turbo diesel,
low miles, many spares, $30,000

Anybody know about this?  Looks like Vanagons big
brother, with a raised fiberglass roof, lenthened rear
end, but what might be standard vanagon nose (hard to
say comparing teeny picture to the '81)  certainly seems
to have Vanagon grill, lights, and VW emblem.  $30k
a lot but looks as big as the EV based big Winnie,
and this has got 4wd

Oh well in UT (801)645-7666 days (801)649-9719 eve
