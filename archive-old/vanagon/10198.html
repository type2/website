Hello gang!

Here's a mini-trip report so far.  (You'll get the full scoop when we get back).

Before I get into this, though, we'd like to thank everyone who has been so
hospitable to us.  We have spent a great couple of days with David Schwarze,
Jeff Scheitner spoiled us with pizza and more &quot;camping&quot; in his electricity
bereft home, and Martha still gets the prize for hostess with the mostess.
(Martha, give our love to Sarah, tell her not to move to Canada because the
music scene is much better right where she is. . .visiting, even long term
walk-abouting would be great, though, for both of you!).  Thanks also to David
Garth's offer of a place to stay in San Luis Obispo, but the rain and wind got
so bad we decided to head straight for the desert in search of drier weather.

We left Big Sur and got the heck out of California after getting our heater
looked at in Santa Cruz.  First we high-rolled it at Vegas, winning $3.00 and
losing $5.00 the next day (Tobin doesn't know when to stop), and then we moved
on to the Grand Canyon.  Truly amazing, and not at all touristy in the middle of
winter.  Inclement weather aside, I am happier and happier we had to take this
trip in the very off season.  No crowds, no traffic in the parks, easy to find
camping.  The trip back from the canyon was really beautiful and it finally
started to warm up.  We found a great Farmer's Market in Flagstaff, Arizona and
bought some wonderful raspberry granola, and in Blythe we bought some great
mexican tomato sauce for $0.33 a tin called El Pato tomato sauce  (the duck
tomato sauce?).   MMMMM.  Here at David's beautiful new condo in San Diego we
have been feasting on pizza and champagne, changing oil and doing something
important to the valves.
	Just a note:  Bradley:  We are not pirates, ay?  It is eh, eh?
On to Mexico today, and all the red tape for driving in has got us both nervous.
It can't be as difficult as it seems right now, because millions of people make
this trip all the time.  We are looking forward to beach and sun and relaxing
like we haven't ever done, not even on our honeymoon.  When we get home, or even
back to the states we will fill you in on our Mexican adventures.  Much love to
all of you. . ., it was great meeting some of you.  Joel, if we change our plans
can we come stay with you?  I'm dying to know what you look like.  Take care,
everyone.
Christa and Tobin        :-)   &lt;-- sunny weather, finally
