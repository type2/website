Subject: Re: Squeaking from front end (spare tire?) of Vanagon



The squeek _could_very_well_be_ the upper A-arm bushing esp. if it is more
noticable with a passengeron board (then its the right bushing). It
happened to me, it was a squeek, not a clunk or knock, was worse with a
passenger and often not so loud in the rain. Its an awkward home job, so I
had a mechanic do it.
