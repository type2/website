Subject: Head Gasket Report- VWoA Di

Head Gasket Report: VWoA Did me right!
Hi Everyone,

Just wanted to report back on my recent experience with Volkswagen of America. 
About a month ago I noticed a small coolant leak at/near the right head of my
'88 Westie.  Jumping to conclusions I assumed the head gasket/head had finally
gone.

Based on the reports of people on the list having some of their head gasket/head
repair costs reimbursed by VWoA, I called and asked what they would do for me. 
I was assigned a case number and only had to play phone tag with the Vanagon rep
for a week.  Everyone I spoke to at VW was friendly, professional and very
helpful.  When I finally got in touch with the rep, (she called me back numerous
times) she made it clear that the suit with the Federal Trade Commission had
been resolved.   Whatever they would decide to do for my case was because of
their own decision making process and not out of legal obligation resulting from
pressure from the FTC.  I was told it would be best to work through a local
dealer but they didn't object to my own mechanic doing the work.  The difference
being that if a real VW dealer did the work I wouldn't have to cover the cost out
of pocket with *possible* reimbursement later by VWoA.  I called 3 different
dealers and talked to the service managers (the VW rep gave me their names and
numbers) until I found someone I liked.  I then called the VWoA rep back and
told her where I was taking my van.  The rep then called the service manager at
the dealer and what was discussed, I don't know.

Sonnen VW in San Rafael, CA had my van for the morning and found the leak was
coming from the O-ring seal where the cylinder meets the block, not the
head/head gasket.  They said VWoA had already authorized 100% parts and labor to
replace the O-ring and head gasket.  If a head were needed they said VWoA would
cover that too.  Initial visual inspection shows that the Sonnen mechanic(s) did
good work.  The service folks treated me extremely well-better than any other
auto service organization I've ever dealt with.

It turned out the head didn't need to be replaced and I had my van back the next
afternoon.  Can't complain about that kind of service on an out of warranty, 2nd
owner Vanagon.  It probably didn't hurt that the speedo only reads 66k- VW's
computer based national service records show the previous owner  had the first
speedo replaced at 23k (under warranty!).  I didn't volunteer that bit of info-figure
they know how to use their computers!

Feel free to contact me directly via email (I'm off list at the moment) if you want
more details.
