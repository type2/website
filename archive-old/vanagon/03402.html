Subject: Walkthrough Splitz

My mate (Danny) has a '67 Devon Split.

It's a walkthrough model ie. split bulkhead.

We have been told that they only made the
walktrough model Split for about 6 months
before starting full Bubble production.

Can any one verify this ? (Lori!)

Lori: How many of your 1300 are walk through's ?
      Did you manage to mail the catalogues      Did you manage to mail the Catalogues (or photocopies) ?
      - I assume your not sending me the real things.

Lee.
