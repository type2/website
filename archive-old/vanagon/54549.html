Subject: Re: ASI campers



&gt;Doe anyone have any experience with ASI camper conversions? I just saw two
&gt;Vanagons in a wrecking yard with this conversion. I had been thinking of
&gt;grafting a Westfalia top onto my V. but this looks like a possible
&gt;alternative. Does anybody have any feelings about these, positive or
&gt;negative? Are they still in business? I found a phone number for them in
&gt;Vancouver, Washinton, but it had been disconnected
&gt;

A friend of mine has a '79 ASI bus camper.  He likes it.  My only criticism 
is that personally, I would find the limited clearance between the bunk bed 
and the fiberglass top a bit claustrophobic when sleeping up top.  The roof 
is maybe a foot above your nose when you sleep up there.
