Subject: fuel overflow

Being a new owner of 85 Westy, I'm surprised that every time
I fill it with fuel it overflows out the filler tube onto the ground.
Is this common?  I can't see what might be wrong with the filler tube,
so possibly my technique needs some adjustment.

This is really a problem because I'm on the road cross country and the
fuel overflow tank or fittings leak like a sieve which I'll have to fix 
today.  Please respond to me personally as I'm not subscribed to the
list while I'm on the road.

Thanks,
Don Parce
