Most of those hitches are only designed to tow 1,200 ponds.  I have seen those 
tow eyes break off.  BTW, in most states, any towed load over 1,000 pounds 
requires it's own brakes.  Easiest way to do this is with a dolly equipped 
with surge brakes.  I do sell a hitch that will do what you need.  E-mail me 
if interested.

Hi Gang:    Anyone out there know the mfg., address and price of the rear 
hitch that mounts on the 'tow eyes'? I have a '86 Westy. I want to tow my 
'72 Bug, can do? 

Thanks,
