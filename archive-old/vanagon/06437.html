So Dan Houg says:
&gt; 4.) Clean the engine/computer grounds.  Check the shop manual for all 
&gt; the locations but a real critical one is on the top/left side of the 
&gt; engine block.  Remove the bolt, scrape the aluminum with a knife till 
&gt; shiny, clean the brass eyelets with the brown colored ground wires, 
&gt; and I applied an anti-corrosion paste for electrical wire-nut 
&gt; connectors.

I'd be willing to bet that this last recommendation was the most
effective fix.  I've replaced many parts only to find that I had
a bad electrical connection
