I've finally got the 5 Yokohama Y370 8plys on my Syncro Westy.    I even got
the sixth one for Al Knoll.

I now really need to be rid of the 4  MXL's and 1 MXT that came off the van.
As I recd. no offers of cases of home brew, I am altering the currency to six
packs. Please help me find these tires a good home.
Thanks.                  JoE
