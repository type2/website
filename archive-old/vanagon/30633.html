Subject: '81 VW rebuild report



Prior situation:  '81 with 103,000 miles.  No work on engine
other than pushrod tube seals on each side at different times.
Starting about 90,000 miles, I noticed a loss of power, increased
use of oil.  It did pass emissions a year ago, but the oil
consumption kept increasing.  Leakdown showed the rings were worn.
Recently there was the beginning show of smoke when shifting after 
hard acceleration....

I asked on the net (September) and got some good/bad responses
on VW rebuilds.  My mechanics favor VW over other (GEX, et al)
based on past experience.  Plus the VW comes with a flywheel.
So we ordered a rebuilt long blockfor my '81.  It took about 
a month to come....

It went in, started on the first turn and ran fine.  After coming
up to temperature, the oil/filter was changed.  One valve cover
gasket leaked so was changed.  Now I have about a thousand miles on 
it, it has settled down and runs great.  No leaks, no problems.  
I plan on another oil/filter change soon and will declare the 
break-in complete.

BTW--mechanic said it came with NEW heads--evidently VW in Canada
didn't have any to rebuild when this motor was put together.
Other items wearing out at the same time:  clutch, motor mounts,
pilot and throwout bearings.  So the whole package had pretty
closely match life expectancies.  :-)

So I got 103,000 miles with only pushrod tube seals, a new exhaust
system, two clutch slave cylinders, and some front bushing work.
All of this at elevations above 5,000'--up to 10,000'.
I think I'm not allowed to complain.  ;-)  All I want is 100,000
miles and 14 years from the new motor and I'll stay a happy camper!
