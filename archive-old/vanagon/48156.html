Subject: Re: Ignition Switch Replacement

&gt;I wonder if anyone has replaced their ignition switch.  I checked the 
&gt;Bentley, but the informaqtion is somewhat vague:  &quot;to remove&quot;, it notes 
&gt;&quot;first remove steering column lock, then unscrew clamping bolt.&quot;  My 
&gt;question:  what is the steering column lock - is this the lock cylinder 
&gt;or the steering lock housing?
&gt;
&gt;Perhaps the newer Bentley's have a clearer description, my manual is the 
&gt;same year as the van - '84.  Any assistance is appreciated.
&gt;
Hey Fred
     My Bentley dated 1989 basicly states the same thing.  I had to replace
my switch after it melted.  The clamping bolt is the bolt that holds the
steering lock housing in place.  I had to remove the key cylinder from my
steering lock to get the switch out.  You have to drill a 3mm hole into the
lock housing.  There is a pin inside the housing you have to depress to free
the lock cylinder.  The dimensions for this hole are in repair group 94.4 in
my bently.  I will try to give you directions.

     1: Lay the steering lock housing on a table, with the key lock pointing
away from you and on the left side of the steering lock housing.

     2:  Measure from the top edge of the casting, just below the cylinder
lock.  You should see the VW symbol and the part number just below this
edge.  Mark a line parallel to the edge of the casting, and 12mm down from
the edge.

     3:  Find the crease that runs at a right angle to the top edge of the
cylinder casting.  This should be just above the VW symbol.  Measure to the
right of the crease, along the top edge of the casting 10mm and mark a line
perpendicular to the top end of the casting.

     4:  Where these two lines cross is where you need to drill the 3mm
hole.  becareful not to drill into the locking cylinder.  

     5:  Use a pin punch to push the small pin on the inside of the housing
in, and pull the locking cylinder out.

     I used a dremel tool with a flexable shaft to drill the hole.  I was
off a little bit with my hole but was still able to push the pin in.  I
lhope this helps you out.  It's kind of hard giving directions to measure
something that may or may not look the same  on my van as it does yours.

Good Luck :-)
