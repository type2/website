&gt; C-Rats kept for a LONG time, too.  When I was in USMC boot camp in 1974 some
&gt; of ours were made in 1943!  Some with chicken noodle soup!  Still have my P38
&gt; from boot camp, and it still works great.  (It's a can opener.)

When I was a kid, our next door neighbor, Wendell, a bus guy, looked just like
St. Muir, (who actually got me into busses) gave me 2 tins of &quot;survival
biscuits&quot; dated 1956.  I actually tried some.  The most rancid stuff I ever
ate!  They came in big 5 gallon tins...
