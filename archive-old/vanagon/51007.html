Subject: Re: Heat: Gas vs. Propane


I like to answer in case of Truma heaters (equal to Propex):

&gt;With winter approaching and much talk about heat, I'm wondering about the
&gt;benefits and problems of gas and propane heat.

&gt;My understanding was that gas heaters were best for operating while =
driving,
&gt;but not necessarily for while camping, due to potential exhaust buildup.

What is about noise?

&gt;I also thought that propane heaters, if vented (I assume these Propex
&gt;heaters are vented, right?), were primarily for more or less continuous
&gt;operation while camping.  Relatively safe due to the vented design.  But I=

&gt;thought they were not designed for operating while driving (not sure why).=


Truma are vented heaters built for continues heating during
driving or camping.

&gt;I'm thinking about a heater for heat while driving, first and foremost.
&gt;While camping, I could make due with short-term heating (like in the
&gt;morning, to entice me out of my sleeping bag).  I don't really need
&gt;continuous heat, though the wife would probably like that option if the =
same
&gt;heat source is good for driving-around heat.

Trumas will be shipped with a temperature regulator and an additional
timer to start operation on a certain time. A remote start will be
possible.

&gt;So, is a Propex type heater good for all around driving and camping?  Or
&gt;should I look into a gas heater?

Who can give you the answer, it depends on your needs. Do you
have other applications for propane? If not, it will be easier
to use gas.

&gt;BTW, my Westy doesn't have a propane tank now.  I assume a tank would have=

&gt;to be added to the OUTSIDE of the van for safety.  Wouldn't be safe inside=
,
&gt;would it?

You also may use propane bottles inside the van, but they will need
an extra compartment with a ventilation to the outside on a minimum
of a 10 cm square hole at the bottom.
