I was told by a VW dealer rep recently that starting with 1995 models, 
the camper outfitting of the Eurovan will be done by Winnebago....cheaper 
to deliver a finished producet. Lower prices to consumer.

&gt; The 1995 model will retain the 109-bhp five-cylinder engine but will have
&gt; dual sliding doors and dual air bags.  VW will then equip the 1996 Eurovan
&gt; --- available in mid-1995 --- with its popular narrow-angle V-6 engine with
&gt; upwards of 178 bhp.

&gt; 
&gt; sometimes, i really believe that Chevrolet has taken over the VWOA and its
&gt; marketing arm. :(  i guess this news-blurb sheds some light on why there
&gt; haven't been ANY 1994 Eurovans at the dealers.
