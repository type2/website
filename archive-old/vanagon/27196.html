 &gt; My approach to the CVs would be to 
 &gt; 1. Try getting a hex key in a socket to work.
 &gt; 2. Apply some heat (watch for the boots)
 &gt; 3. File flats on the bolts and clean them and grip them with the vice grips.
 &gt; 4. Drill a hole through the head sideways and use a pin punch to turn 
 &gt;    with a vice grips while tapping on the head of the bold.

Heat often helps recalcitrant bolts, but when you're working under there with 
all the grease and oil, DO keep a fire extinguisher handy!!

Even if you never use it, it's reassuring, and we don't want to lose any 
vanagoons, do we?
