Dave K asks about the side vents on 80 Westys. From what I have seen the
80 and possibly 81 models have the  air slots as part of the sheet metal;
the 82 and on have a plastic grille. It may be cosmetic (with my personal
preference being the plastic insert), but it may also have been easier to
construct. Also in the later years (85?) there is a &quot;wing&quot; that is more
pronounced directly in front of the air intake. Presumably this creates an
airflow over the grille preventing rain and snow from going directly in (I
am guessing) much like the wings on the back of station wagons...the
earlier models don't have this bump.....DC
