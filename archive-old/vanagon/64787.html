  Could this be anything but the ECU not properly dealing with the
  signal from the oxygen sensor?  Everyone says don't suspect the ECU
  until you've tried absolutely everything else, I can't guess what else
  it could be.  HELP! &gt;&gt;

 Well quit guessin' and start BETTIN' !!!

If anyone decides to start buying replacement ECUs, you might seek out an
auto parts store that sells Python brand remanufactured stuff for VW.  I see
in their product line catalog that they offer a remanufactured ECU for the
Vanagons.  I priced these a few months ago and the cost seemed very
reasonable to me, I don't recall the exact figure I was quoted. I think I'll
buy a spare at some point down the road as a hedge against being Henried
(Found On Road Dead).

I have used Python brand remanufactured Injectors and Fuel Pump and they seem
to be of high quality, no problems.  Saved beaucoup bucks over new Bosch or
Dealer Gold Plated Bosch.  FYI, they also do Air Flow and Mass Flow Meters
for the Bosch FI systems.

In Colorado Springs I get this Python stuff at a parts place called Proline.


On the subject of parts cost,  I was making the rounds of the two VW dealers
in town yesterday looking for dealer only doodads and binkuses and discovered
one dealer was quoting me full dealer list price sort of prices (what else?)
and the other place was quoting me double dealer prices!   It goes to show
that it pays to shop even at the VW dealer.  Apparently they can make up
whatever price they want for stuff.  (If in Colorado Springs Phil Winslow VW
was the double everything priced guys, Heuberger was the regular list price
guys, BTW.  The gal at the Heuberger parts counter is a breadloaf bus person,
very helpful on bus/van parts)
