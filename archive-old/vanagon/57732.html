Hi all, 
I attempted to get the 82 air cooled Vanagon westie registered today but I
failed emissions.  The reg calls for an idle  CO of 1.2 and I got 1.56.  The
shop guy said it is a slight adjustment but they cannot do it.  Anyone know if
this is a simple mixture adjustment or what?  If so, which screw and would it be
inside the dreaded air box?  I don't have my bentley here but will check it this
evening.  I was hoping to go tweak it and re-check at lunch.  I wish I had a
pocket emission tester for this so I could set it as I read the values.  I get
one free re-check, then pay again.  This is a new Mark Stephens rebuild with
only has 800 miles on it.   

By the way, I finally got my core charge back from MS last week.  It was
November 17 when I shipped it to them.  I knew it would be long so I was
patient.  When I hadn't rec'd it by  late February I called them on 2/20.  The
guy, not Bill, said Oh I remember doing that one.  Well they could not find the
invoice.  

The tech guy says: &quot;How does $300 bucks sound?&quot;  I said, well ok if that is what
you normally charge for a dropped valve seat in one head.   They deducted $50
from each head.  Not sure if that is cool but I agreed to $300.  He said we will
credit my account today.  That never happened so mid March I called again, same
thing only this time it actually did get credited to me.  Whew that was a long
saga.

I figure the original core charge was $400, it cost me $124 to ship it back,
minus $100 for the heads which leaves a whopping $176 that I actually recovered.
 Next time I would keep the core and rebuild it for a spare as I know the
botttom end was ok.  I had one dropped seat plus the P&amp;Cs were probably cooked.
Comments?  TIA for any emission adjustment advice/info.  Please reply directly
