Fellow Syncronauts,

Winter has finally arrived to Alberta Canada.  Blustery winds and 4 cm (~2 
inches) combined with freezing rain have closed upon Edmonton.  It went from 
+8 C to -14 C in about 7 hours!!  It is now that time of year to be able to 
beat the sports cars off of the lights!!!  :-)

For you fellow V_at_L's in the North Central States, look out.  It is heading your 
way and it will make life interesting.

Cheers
Tony
