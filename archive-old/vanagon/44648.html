&gt;Hello Derek,
&gt;
&gt;I hope you can remember me (I asked you something about Syncro).
&gt;Last Friday I've purchased one.The preowner is now imprisoned cause of
&gt;tax frauds.

funny

&gt;It has 60.000 km (thats about 45.000 miles ?). Year of construction is
&gt;1991. It  is  the diesel-Version with 70 hp - I know you have said that
&gt;the diesels are absolutely underpowered but I think in Germany it is
&gt;enough.

If you have a 1991 16&quot; Syncro then you have a very, very special vehicle
indeed. I am glad to know you. The 16&quot; vehicle is even *more* capable than
my vehicle off-road (except for stream crossings) and so I wish I had the
16&quot; drivetrain and transmissions.

I am going to forward to you a note about measuring the ride height of your
van. I'd like to know how high off the ground it sits. You measure the ride
height from the center of the front wheel to the *metal part* of the
wheelhousing above. But read the other note I will send you.

Here is information about the mailing list for these vehicles, called
&quot;Vanagon&quot; here in USA. The archives are particularly valuable and I sugest
you search on the term &quot;syncro.&quot;

&gt;I have  hardly the possibility  to cross streams here in Europe. Maybe
&gt;in Eastern Europe. But thats about 2000 miles away. I wont travel there
&gt;every day. Also the distance to the Sahara is 2000 miles. --&gt; dimensions
&gt;are different to those of America. Another reason is that gasoline  is
&gt;much more expensive then diesel. Gasoline is about 1 $ / Liter ( 1
&gt;gallon contains  3.49 Liters ) and diesel is about 0.65 $ / Liter.
&gt;
&gt;I am so happy about that and I hope it was a good decision.

Get ready to learn more about repairs than you had originally planned. Start
looking to buy a used transmission from a junk yard (salvage yard for
wrecked vehicles) so you will have a spare in case yours goes bad. 

Is yours a Westfalia camper?
