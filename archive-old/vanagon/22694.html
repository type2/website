&gt;          I wonder if they meant &quot;Porsche style pancake engine&quot;?

 The later bay window buses shared an engine with the 411,42 and 
VW-Porsche 914/4.  Since the 914/4 was a 'vw' in Europe but a 'Porsche' 
over here obviously having the same engine makes it a 'Porsche' Engine.  
Couldn't very well expect the Porsche to have VW engine could we ;)

A dealer used the Porsche engine bit on my father in '72 when he bought a 
Westy.
