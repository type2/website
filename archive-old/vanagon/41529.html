&gt; you think that you have headaches now?  Wait 'til you try to make that Weber
&gt; DFEV try to do anything but bog, spit, backfire, give free gas to the wind
&gt; gods, and freeze shut in the winter.  HEED THIS WARNING!  find someone to

I feel the need to defend the Weber here.  I agree that you should do 
what you can to keep the stock system working.  However, I installed a
DFEV on my '71 camper last fall and haven't touched it since the 
initial adjustments.  It will give me 22mpg on the highway loaded with
camping stuff and tools.  It does take some time to warmup.  I am onto
a way to use the original oil bath air cleaner with warm air assist 
and imagine it will help greatly in this area.  Even as it was it 
certainly wasn't unuseable over the winter.  If you get on it enough 
for both throats you can add to the icing problems.  I went slow and 
easy and didn't have any major problems.  Just my experience.  Jim
