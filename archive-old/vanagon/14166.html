Okay folks,

Just for your info.  The AAA RV store that Al spoke of does not
normally carry the flue in stock, so I'm ordering 25 of them.
I plan to keep 5 of them.  5 have been spoken for.  So that
will leave 15 that I can sale at cost plus postage if necessary.
So it will be first requested first served.  But as of now I 
will need you to send the money up front and I will then send
the flue.  The cost of postage will depend on where you're from.
I would add $2.00 for postage to the $5.00 for the flue and
that should do it.  Any extra will be sent back with the flue.
If you're really desperate and I run out, I'll order more, but
I'd like to work up a list first before I commit to more okay?

Thanks

Steven
