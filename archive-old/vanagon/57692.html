Sean,

&gt;My first thought was &quot;aw sh*t, I gotta drop the tank&quot; but further
&gt;inspection showed that the only thing leaking was one of the rubber
&gt;cloth-covered hoses that leads to the vent tank in the driver's wheel
&gt;well.  That one hose was soaked with gas while the others were dry, and
&gt;I didn't see any leaking on the passenger side.

&gt;So, I have to replace one hose.  No big deal, it's in plain view and I'm
&gt;happy.  The question is what size is the hose?  Looks like about 7mm.

It's a 5.5 mm inner diameter hose. You should change all rubber hoses.
The rubber hoses may dried out of a '81 Westy. I changed all recently
and they ALL looking odd. You don't have to drop the tank for this work.
