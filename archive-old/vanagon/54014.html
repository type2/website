Subject: clutch juddering

Vanagonians,
        Just to add one more thing to worry about, I experienced clutch
juddering and neglected any solution to the problem. A number of months
passed by, I don't recall exactly how long, and my pilot bearing fell to
pieces and locked the main shaft from the tranny into the engine's
crankshaft. This prevents gear shifts and therefore vehicle motion. I don't
know if this was a cause and effect cascade of events but it was a
suspicious coincidence. Perhaps the juddering caused the main shaft to beat
up the bearing. My two cents worth.
