&gt;The gear lever (or shift stick if you like) in my 4 speed 1982 bus it a bit
&gt;of a long reach and causes left shoulder ache in traffic. Is this a common
&gt;problem? Do you find yourself moving the seat forward because of this?
&gt;Is it possible/easy to either get a longer lever or bolt on an extension to
&gt;the normal one?

yes. Gene Berg sells one in the U.S. but it makes the 3rd gear stretch a
looong reach. i chose the &quot;short shift&quot; kit ($20) to DEcrease the amount
of movement between gears. i highly recommend it.
