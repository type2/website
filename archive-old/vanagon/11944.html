&gt;&gt;The voltage stabilizer output should be 10 volts (9.5-10.5 O.K.)
&gt;&gt;It sure looks like an electronic thingy to me :)

The one on my Volvo is a mechanical stablizer. It was broken and I took it 
apart. There was a thermo switch inside. The switch turns on/off very fast
and outputs a stablized voltage. The one on the vanagon looks very similar.
It is sealed inside a small metal housing of the size of a small candy.
I could be wrong again.
