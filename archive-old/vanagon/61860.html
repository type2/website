Subject: (F)Re: Adventure trip Iceland-Faeroerna-Europe, Was: Shipping van to Europe

&gt; How those of us that are in the USA can do the first leg to
&gt; Iceland I don't know. If anyone has ideas I would appreaciate
&gt; if they would write me. I was thinking of doing this trip myself.
Well I envision 2 options:
1) research/implement the rare (no kidding) &quot;Schwimmenwagen&quot; mods done
at the factory to Type IIs to make her seaworthy and sail her over under
her own power on the surface or
2) lengthen the air &quot;schnorkel&quot; feeding air to the to the fuel injection
to go straight up a long way, caulk all the air leaks to the cabin and
drive 'er subsurface a'la &quot;Das Boot&quot;. 
Either way stay clear of the shipping lanes.
