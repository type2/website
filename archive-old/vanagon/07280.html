&gt;I notice from reading the manual that the A/C compressor is prevented from
&gt;coming on if the outside temperature is 50
&gt;degrees or less. Does this mean that if you plan to run it every
&gt;two weeks during the winter that you should do so inside a
&gt;heated, inside garage or you are not benefiting your system?

hmmmmmm. hadn't thought of that! :)  i keep forgetting that lots of folks
live up there in winters that never get about freezing. ;)  i would think
that if you heated up the interior of the bus, and then turned on the a/c
with the temp control (a/c, that is) turned to max, it should work. i think
the thermostat is inside the bus and the compressor kick-switch is controlled
by that ... that is, it's the inside temp that controls it, not the outside
temp.
