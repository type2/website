Subject: wtb: rear door cover/screen for '86 westy

A friend has a cover w/ a screen section that covers his rear door when 
open.  Its used for extra ventilation in hot weather when camping.  I 
didn't get one w/ my van from the PO, and I would like to buy one. I have 
not yet checked w/ a dealer for the VW price.

Does anyone know the best source for this item?  I could have one
duplicated using my friends as a pattern.  He has an '82 Westy.
