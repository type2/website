Subject: Ignition switch on '71

Can anyone with a '71 bus tell me the color of the wire
connections between the ignition switch and the wire harness.

I have had this stange thing occur after installing my ignition.
I turn the key to start it and it cranks but won't start until
I let go of the ignition.  This tells me that the juice to the
coil is getting cut off when I operate the starter.  Very strange.

Martin
