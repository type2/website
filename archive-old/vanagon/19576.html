kwiebe_at_nwrain_dot_com coughed up:
&gt; 
&gt; I've seen sliding side doors on late-model buses, dual side doors on 
&gt; microbuses, but what does the term barndoor term refer to?

The huge engine lid on the pre-55-1/2 busses.  The engine lid was the
same size as the later bus hatch, but a barndoor doesn't have a batch.
Essentially, the engine lid goes all the way up the the &quot;rib&quot; around the
beltline...
