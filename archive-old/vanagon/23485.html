&gt; i have the same symptom in my 73 bus.  as far as putting weight on the
&gt; shifter i am not so sure that this is a good idea.  from what i have
&gt; been told, just the extra weight of resting your hand on the shifter
&gt; while driving is enoughto cause it to break/wear out much faster.  my

No indeed, a really bad idea.  Practically guarantees you'll need a new 
tranny.  

&gt; noise goes away if i place my hand on the shifter or move and hold it
&gt; to the side a bit.  i plan on getting underneath this weekend and

Same thing, exactly push it either way and it goes away.  

&gt; taking a look around and to tighten some things up.  if you hear any
&gt; good advice on this however, woul;d you mind passing it along?  and if
&gt; i find a cure i will be sure to share it with you.

You bet.  This has become something of a holy grail for me.  
Unfortunately, I wait until just before I go on long trips before trying 
to deal with it.  Actually spent a day in Newport, OR a couple of year 
ago, trying to get it fixed.  Unfortunately, turned out the mechanic that 
worked on it was nearly deaf and couldn't hear it anyway!!  

BTW, my '82 did exactly the same thing, starting around 30K miles.  
Personally, I think it's something loose in the shift lever to shift rod 
linkage, and it sounds a lot like a connecting pin or similar.
