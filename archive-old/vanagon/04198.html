&gt; &gt; 
&gt; When I bought my 82 Westy in May, I thought I had a bum fridge.  I took 
&gt; it to a RV shop for servicing.  The dude there said that other than 
&gt; cleaning the fur of a golden lab off of it (previous owners) he said it 
&gt; worked fine. 
&gt; Following his advice (see steps below.), I can get it started on the 
&gt; third or fourth click EVERYTIME!
&gt; 
&gt; 	1. Get front/rear and left/right bubble levels installed in a
&gt; convienient location.  I use the dash.  Cheap at any RV shop.  Be sure 
&gt; the van is Level prior to sticking these on!

Levels! We don't need no stinking levels!  I never had to use a level
to get mine started.  I've been able to start mine easily on some 
pretty good inclines.

&gt; 
&gt; The two important ones for me were leveling and insuring that it was dark 
&gt; enough to see the pilot light when it did start.  I probably spent alot 
&gt; of time lighting an already lit fridge.

You can also turn the fridge on to max. and go outside and see if you
can hear the burner going at the flue vent.  I never could see that
damn pilot lite unless it's pitch dark.
