Schedule conflict with the week of the 8,9,10.  FordZilla and AAron the beast-
master will again present the fourth mostly annual moonlight madness pedal and
pork tour of White Rim Trail, Canyonlands NP, UT.  I gotta be there, cause I
have the permit!  Howsomever, those with AAA connections should look up their
Baja Book.  California Sud can be fairly toasty in September so I'd bid with
wabbot for a later date in October.  Hell, who needs moonlight when you have
Blazing Cases!  Anyway, San Felipe is nice but no surf.  Mulege also nice.

FWIW:  A mystical power spot is white crack overlook on white rim trail in 
the moonlight, especially if the deities provide the lightshow that they did
last year with powerful thunderstorms in the Henry mountains and the La Sals
and moon light on the stone.
