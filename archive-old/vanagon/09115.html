Subject: 1982 Westy

I found a 1982 Westphalia camper at a local VW dealer.  Body and interior 
are in good condition, just need cleaning.  Its a diesel with 111,000 
miles.  My previous bus was a '67, so I don't know much about the 
vanagons, particularly the diesel engine.  I drove it and it drove ok.  
The acceleration on hills was weak, as expected.  They're asking $4900 
for it.  My specific questions are how is the performance of the diesel 
vs gas engines in the vanagons, and are there any diesel specific things I 
should watch out for if I decided to buy, and lastly, how many miles can 
one reasonably expect the diesel to go before requiring overhaul?   I 
welcome any and all comments/suggestions/tips.
