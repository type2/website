There was a message a couple of weeks ago about the costs of renovation.

Rarely is it possible to recoup the costs of  thorough VW camper 
restoration, or restoration of any other vehicle to come to that. From a 
strictly financial point of view, most vehicles should be scrapped after ten 
years. Using the restored VW is the only way of getting some of the money 
back.

I'm about to rehang the front doors on my 1972 Westfalia. They were removed, 
stripped, de-rusted,  cleaned, welded, skimmed with filler, painted, 
retrimmed and fitted with new seals, chrome trim, hinge pins and re-bushed 
hinges. (Watch that chrome trim - it kinks very easily)

The doors look better - although with a bit of road dirt, you probably 
wouldn't notice from ten feet  away. I feel happy about a job well-done and 
the doors should last but whether it has been a 'cost effective' exercise is 
doubtful.

Mind you, the job kept me  out of the pub.
