&gt; ha! one of my old bosses used to have TWO of those. the only two in the
&gt; whole state of alabama. they were DKW Juniors. and they are/were truly
&gt; two-strokes. when you lifted the hood to fill the gas tank, you had a small
&gt; oil tank to fill as well. front wheel drive, so they were good in snow and
&gt; ice. and i believe they were 3-cylinders. not much to look at but they just

Not only did dkw become part of audi, those cars formed the basis for the

I think the four companies were DKW, audi Wanderer, and Horch
