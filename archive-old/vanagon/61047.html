Subject: Bilistein jack question

Hi all

I picked up a kinda rusty Bilistein jack at the boneyard. I want to
dismantle it to clean it up reall well and restore it to perfection. My
problem in the removal of the part that the lug wrench turns. On the far
side of this is an e-clip, which I removed. On the turning part there
*appears* to be an allen bolt, or some type of a pin holding it together.
Does anyone know what this is, or have an idea on how to procede with this
venture? Thanks 

Those on the Vanagon list, please reply privately.
