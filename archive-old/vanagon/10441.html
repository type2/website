Condensation is what leads to water in the tank. In freezing temps it can
basically stop you dead in your tracks; had this happen once. Solution? A
garage has to
blow high pressure air air through the gas lines. Prevention can be had
through
alcohol (in the tank) which mixes with the water and is burned off. FI
cleaner may do the same in principle, maybe that was the shuddering you
sensed. -- 

BTW several people have mentioned &quot;puke yellow&quot; as the colour of their
van. This would not be the same &quot;Ivory&quot; colour found on many VW's would
it? Because that is what ours is. If anyone needs the paint number for
ivory, I have it. DC
