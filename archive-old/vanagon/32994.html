So Jim Digennaro says:
&gt; 
&gt; Hi Volks,
&gt;    I was just wondering.  Is there a list of 'lists'.  Actually, I was
&gt; looking for more VW related lists. 'Like I have time for more list mail.'
&gt; Thanks for the help
&gt; 
&gt;                         Keep on Busin' -Jim D
&gt; 

I post the 'list of lists' to the rec.autos.makers.vw.aircooled internet list
about once every 2 weeks.  It's in the FAQ General section under (can you
believe it) mailing lists. ;)  Since your attention to this mailing list
was probably brought to you by another Limbo member, you were not aware of
this.  I will send you the FAQ via private email.

Cheers!
