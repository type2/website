Subject: 	boot: shifter linkage

Tried to get a new boot for the spot where the shift rod connects to the
shift actuator on the transaxle.  On the '90 GL standard, this is a
two-pleat accordian shape that fits over the nylon ball on the actuator and
it changes into a cylindrical shape that fits over the body of the
&quot;receiver&quot; (inside of which the nylon ball resides).  The dealer tried to
sell me a replacement that was pleated from top to bottom and didn't even
approximate the OD of the &quot;ball-receiver&quot;.

Are there two different boots for two different linkages?

How do I find the part number for the one that I described for mine?
        (cylindrical bottom, roughly 1&quot; in length, then two or three
        pleats with a narrowed opening)

Who knows what I'm talking about?  (Me?  I can't remember...)
