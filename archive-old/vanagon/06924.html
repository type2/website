Subject: Laguna Beach 'Falia Rental Info (finally)

Sorry for taking so long in obtaining the rental info (I was
at COMDEX last week).  But here it is and as I see Alice found
out some of the info.

VAC Group
21042 Laguna Canyon rd. (hwy 133)
Laguna Beach CA 92651
714-497-0626

Prices:
$62/day for Standard
$72/day for Luxury * (I have to laugh)
* (and I quote) 'Luxury vehicles are newer models equipped w/
  water cooled engines'

Three days min.; 100 miles/day free w/ 1,000 free miles max. per
trip.  $0.19 per mile over free miles.

Additional camping set (includes sleeping bags, sheets, pillows,
cases, hand towels, bath towels, cook set, utensils, cutlery,
plates,cups, can opener, matches, &amp; first aid kit) $50 per trip.

NOTES: I saw four 'falias on this small lot.  All were Vanagons
       and the latest was I would guess a '86.
