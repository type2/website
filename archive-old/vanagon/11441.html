&gt; 
&gt; 1.  the water tank itself
&gt; 2.  the line form the tank to the pump
&gt; 3.  the line from the pump to the faucet
&gt; 4.  the line from the sink down to the outside drain
&gt; 
&gt; Help!  Has anyone had this happen?  Any suggestions for how to track
&gt; it down (please remember I am NOT very left-brained  :(            )
&gt; 

Umm... How about using food coloring in the water (in the tank).  Then
track down where the stain comes from.  I know.  Lotsa food coloring.
You know what food coloring is don't you Martha?  I thought so.  Well
you could crush some plumbs and use the juice as a food coloring and
the left over crushed plumbs could be made into..... you guessed it!
PRUNES!!!!   ;)   

Glad to be of help.....  ;)
