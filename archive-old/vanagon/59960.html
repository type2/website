Subject: Syncro FS

Hello All,
	All this talk of the syncro for sale, mine still is! I'm moving the 1st of
June and I'd like to sell it by then.
	It's an '86 with 128K and I'm asking 4k or make an offer.

	I have had some vw bus since '71 except for 1 yr, I couldn't stand it. I
know that I'll be looking for another as soon as I get everything together
after the move. This bus has been the best one I've had so far, sad but I'm
already looking that far ahead.
	The VW bus is a sickness &amp; I have it bad.... funny, but I like it like that!
	Later all,

	
Rob
