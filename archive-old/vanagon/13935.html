Subject: Okay, and now for a new windshield

Folks,

Next item of business for my '73 bus is a new windshield with a new
metal-trim windshield gasket.

Rocky Mountain Motorworks has this combination for over $300! (ouch)

Anybody have a suggestion for a better deal somewhere?

Thanks, 

John Kinney
