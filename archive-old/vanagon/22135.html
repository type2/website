Subject: /f friday poem


Alright gang...I don't really like poetry, and I don't read Joel's
renditions. But my life affirming guide says that today, in order to
understand Tao better, I must write poetry (and what better day than a
FFFFRiday? :). So, as painful as the following may be, here is my
first ever attempt....


To have no bus.
To see all those for sale, as they
  travel my mailbox.
Some linger for days, others I purge
  with zest and disgust.
The rate of exchange is fast and furious,
  if I don't grab now, I might miss,
and still have no bus.

To have no bus.
The desire is too great, the conflicts arise.
A bus is within range, but how high the price?
To start is a pleasure, to continue a pain.
When does it stop? Does the credit card max out?
First comes the engine, the brakes, the tires;
the big and the small, they all come in waves.
My weekends will fall, then start on the nights;
soon it would be no woman, for no money nor time.
Then the only course, to buy more and more;
and say goodbye to my life.

Ah, but it shall surely be, and I will still :)
