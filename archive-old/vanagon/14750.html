Subject: Big Battery = Destroy Starter

I was reading in the Bosch Technical Instruction booklet about Electric
Starting Motors and it says, &quot;Blah, blah, blah... Starting systems are
designed to take into account a given voltage drop in the system. Therefore,
in order to avoid mechanical overload or overheating of the starting mtor, a
storage battery with more than the specified ampere-hour capacity must not
be used.&quot;

This raises the question of how to wire our auxiliary batteries. If you wire
two 12 volt batteries together, or allow them to connect together during
starting only as I have done, then it would seem you risk frying your starter. 

Hummm...
