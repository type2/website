I just subscribed to this mailing list this morning; I hope some experts 
here can give this newbie (to Type IIs) some advice.  I'll try to be as 
specific as possible with my questions (no &quot;Are Type II's any good?&quot;-type 
questions).

I have been looking for a good camper for a few months, specifically a 
'76-'79 (I want a Type IV 2000cc, but don't want a Vanagon--just personal 
preference).  Right now I'm talking with someone from Ohio (I'm from 
southern Ontario) who has the following for sale:

1976 Westphalia
 - Manual tranny
 - 140,000 miles on original engine (no rebuild)
 - New tires (Michelins with reinforced sidewalls esp. for Type II VWs)
 - New exhaust and heat exchangers
 - New brakes
  (&quot;new&quot; as in less than 5000 miles old)
 - A bit of surface rust (rear dogleg, under front windshield, front
  passenger door step)
 - Interior good; propane kitchen; everything works
 - Single owner since 1979: maintained by authorized VW service
 - Starts and runs reliably

This will be a summer-only vehicle and my goal is to keep it as long as it 
cares to be alive.  I'm looking at restoring this to its original glory 
before a trip from Southern Ontario to Vancouver and back this summer.  I 
intend to get an engine rebuild done right away, as well as body work and 
new paint.  As I begin to drive and appreciate it, I will learn how it works 
and how to fix it (I'm reading through John Muir's book right now), but will 
be getting an expert to do the work right now.

A local shop will be doing the rebuild; the owner has 40 years experience 
with air-cooled VWs (saw a nice '65 in his shop, which is rare for southern 
Ontario).

My questions?  What is this beast worth (roughly), and what do you think a 
rebuild will cost, given that the engine has 140,000 miles on it without a 
rebuild, but still runs reliably?  Any potential problems areas to look for 
when I check this one out?  (The owner of the local shop has already given 
me a few things to look for.)
