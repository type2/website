Subject:       Re: Vanagon Heat Vents.....

&gt; 
&gt; I have a 1987 Syncro Westie.  When the heat turned on, heat comes out of the 
&gt; vents up front.  If I open the fresh air vents (the ones that can be 
&gt; redirected) on either side, Cold outside air comes in.  My parents-inlaw have a 
&gt; 1990 Multivan and when their fresh air vents open and the heat is on, warm/hot 
&gt; air comes out.  Whay gives???  Did VW get smarter and add more vents for heat 
&gt; to keep the windows clear.  I would be interested in hearing if others have 
&gt; noticed this.  Is there a valve that I am missing in order to redirect heat to 
&gt; these vents.  I checked all of the piping but have found nothing...  
&gt; 
I just discovered lately that these vent on my '88 seems to blow 
either fresh cold air, or heated air depending on valve position, and 
whether heat is directed to dash from the heater panel.
