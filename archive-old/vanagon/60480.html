Subject: Re: Timing belt change frequency?



&gt;Oh, on my *VANAGON*, eh?  I thought you meant on a real car.  Vanagons
&gt;don't have fancy things like timing belts -- they have a gear-driven
&gt;single camshaft with pushrods -- like all boxer VW's since 1938.  Well,
&gt;they all do in the USA, because we've never been blessed with all the other
&gt;engines that might need timing belt.  Anybody from South Africa want to
&gt;answer this one for the 5-cylinder engine?

I can answer from Germany: The five cylinders have an overhead camshaft,
they need timing belts. Should be replaced every 90,000km.

Diesels have a camshaft, even in US, don't forget 'em.
