Subject: Sun visor clips
Date: Tue, 2 May 1995 08:49:18 -0500 (CDT)

In the long list of things I have ordered for my '71 bus I have 
ordered two clips to hold the visors in place.  They are from West 
Coast Metric.  The problem is that there is no slot to pop the thing 
out and swing it to the side.  There is just a hole that would keep it
in one place.  Any other ideas?  Does someone make a more genuine 
replacement?  Maybe I should have just bought them at the salvage 
yard.  I figured new was less likely to crack.  Thanks, Jim
