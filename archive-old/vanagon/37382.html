&gt;I remember taking the switch wire off the starter when I
&gt;hot-wired it and crawl under the bus to reattach it.

But he was in such a swivet over his plane maybe leaving without him that
he didn't tighten it down. This causes bizarre and spectacular electrical
problems that will befuddle a person like me for at least two days. Finally
figured it out. ;)

David Easterwood can change out an entire steering column in about an hour,
including time answering my barrages of questions (&quot;What's that wad of
canvas for?&quot;). Pretty impressive.

&gt;Turns out I will be going next week to pick up the '56 &amp; Ken &amp; I will
&gt;complete our business together then.

I expect he means he's going to come by here and make me give his tools back. ;)

Oh, and it warn't the steel-toed boots that concerned the security people
at the airport, it was the fact that he didn't have time to wash up after
all that mechanicing and he looked like a threat to the domestic
tranquility. ;)
