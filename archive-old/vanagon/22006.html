Subject: Re: Eurovan Westfalia Sighting


What you saw Lisa was sold here as the EuroVan MV Weekender. Which
was essentially the MV with a pop-top, screened slider windows
on the sides, and a &quot;six pack&quot; cooler under the driver's side
jump seat.

Canada received the &quot;full blown&quot; Westfalia campers...with all of
the cabinets, and equipment.
