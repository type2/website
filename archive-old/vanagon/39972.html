Subject: Re: 81 rebuild - balance or not?

To All:

Pistons, piston pins and connecting rods are part of the reciprocating mass
of the the engine.  They do not rotate and are not balanced as a part of the
rotating components.  Reciprocating parts are balanced so as to have the same
total mass and center of balance.  This is done dynamically, the parts are
simply weighed and the heavier parts lightened to match the lightest part.

Pistons and rods in modern engines are typically matched much more closely
than the 1930's spec to which the Volkswagen was built.

While pistons within a set are usually within the same weight 'group', the VW
spec for variation within a weight group is on the order of ten grams.  If
your set happens to be made up of pistons from different weight groups the
variation will be even wilder.  Mixing pistons isn't supposed to happen but
I've seen it many times.

Static balancing a set of pistons is a quick, relatively inexpensive
operation, well worth the effort.
