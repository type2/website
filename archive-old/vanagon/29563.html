&gt;...                               Sounds like the Southern (forget which
&gt;state) whiner who sued BMW on behalf of everybody (but wasn't planning on
&gt;sharing the booty).

for all that are interested, that was an Alabama whiner M.D. and the deal
was that the BMW dealer (whose salesscum are worse than your average car
salesscum) sold him the car at new  price even though it had been repainted
due to some damage.

this same dealer had, on his lot, a Land Rover ($48,000 list) that some idiot
salesscum (who admitted to doing this) had taken out for the weekend, to &quot;see
what it could do&quot;. i asked how much they would come off the price after they
fixed it. he replied, &quot;sticker price! we ain't coming off any.&quot;.

while i do think the doctor is a whiner (there are other clues in the stories
in the Birmingham papers), i don't think (imho) that BMW should be stuck for
the money. my opinion is that the dealer should be made to pay it. :)

can you guess that i don't care much for dealers??   :)
