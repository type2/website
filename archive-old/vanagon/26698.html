     I know that feeling.  I only pay with cash now days.  cut all cards in 
     little pieces, only cash.

&gt;Okay, I once had 28 passengers in my van... 
&gt;
&gt;Anyone had more?
     
I thought i had the record with a measly 12 people in my '85...I was 
definitly feeling the effects of that load.
     
Bus related:  I went to fill up the bus today and i wanted to use my ATM 
card to pay.  it didn't work and i had to leave my watch as collateral, 
anyway, when i returned with cash and paid; i was given my watch back and 
while putting it on i felt that i had just been released from prison and i 
was given my belongings back. oh well it felt weird...
     
&gt;From my roomate:  &quot;goddamn, don't you guys think you like your busses a 
little too much&quot;
