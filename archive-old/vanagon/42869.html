Subject: Shocks: Regular or Heavy Duty

I need to replace shocks on Ernie (78 Westy).  I hear KYB is
all the rage...anything special about them?  Someone else told
me that gas shocks will make it ride like a brick.

Being a Westy, the bus is heavier that normal.  That, plus the
huge load of stuff we take camping would seem to indicate that
&quot;heavy duty&quot; or overload shocks might be in order.  Does anyone
know if someone makes a &quot;coil-over&quot; type shock for the bus to
use as helper springs for heavy loads?  Should I use the &quot;gas-adjust&quot;,
self dampening version of the KYB's or are those the ones that make
it ride rough?
