Subject:  dometic floor fridge wanted

i'm thinking about a fridge for the adventurewagen.  i have a
water-damaged (wood rotted) westy sink/stove/fridge unit i'd be willing
to trade for the floor model fridge that i've seen behind the passenger's
seat in some weekender-type packages.  i would consider other
free-standing models also, if any exist.  if anyone is at all interested, let
me know.

thanks, matthew (with mobius the 81 adventurewagen who will be
traveling to the festival of the arts in downtown detroit this weekend)

p.s. - finally got my refund from parts place with a note from the guy
who signed the check: 'i know what it's like to have your car down'.  
thanks for the sympathy,  but do you know what it's like to give
interest-free loans for a few weeks?  complaints concluded, i guess i'd
order from them again if i really had to.
