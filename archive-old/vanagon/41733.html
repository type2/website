Subject: muffler problems
Date: Thu, 9 May 1996 20:44:39 -0400 (EDT)

I have just had my muffler replaced, today as a matter of fact,
and my 86' gl should be running as smooth as it was before the
muffler went bad, right??  Unfortunately, this is not the
case.  I had the muffler replaced at tuffy (ie. the cheapest).
I immediately took the van back and demonstrated to them that
it was running loud and that it hadn't been bofore my muffler
went.  The engine seems to be running ok, but hesitates a
little.  the idle is stable, but still rough.  The sound coming
out of the exhaust seems to indicate that it is missing or
&quot;wants&quot; to miss, but when i look inside the engine box and
listen carefully it sounds ok except for the horrible sound
coming from the exhaust.  My plugs are relatively new
(january), i have a new fuel filter, air filter, and i have the
harness for the air intake. 
	Has anyone noticed that the tuffy mufflers are not up
to par??  Should i have my CO mixture checked??  Could this be
a timing problem (i'm sure it could).  Any suggestions or tips
from previous experience are much appreciated.  
By the ways, I am not on the list, so, if you could, email me
at the adddress below.  

Many thanks in advance

learn from the experience of others, are also remarkable for
their apparent disinclination to do so.
