G'day all- Matty J here! About to embark on an epic West coast (CA, OR, WA) 
/AZ/NM/Colorado and beyond road trip. I am interested in finding out if 
there are any list members out there interested in meeting a fellow Busser 
(me) on his travels thru your neck of the woods. 

I'm not trying to hit anyone up for accomodations (we'll have a camper 
after all, so your SO has nothing to worry about), just a chance to meet 
some of the faces out there and make this &quot;community&quot; we have here a little 
smaller. 

I'll be travelling with a lass from New Zealand, searching for awesome 
sunsets and painted deserts. (and would love to actually meet 
Grendel-whadya say Bob?) 

The journey begins on Feb 25th and lasts until May. Please respond directly 
to me before Feb 13 (my last day on-line) if you're keen. 

Maybe thru my connections along the way, the list could stay updated on our 
travels and wonderful places we find, so other listies have new 
destinations to explore. 

Just an experiment of the Michael Palin &quot;Pole to Pole&quot;-esqueness. 

Hope to meet ya'll!

Matty J
