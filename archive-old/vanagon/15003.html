Subject: Re: repost: For Sale- 78 bus stuff


&gt;&gt;I have a air conditioning unit that mounts on the interior roof of a '78 bus,
&gt;&gt;unfortunately i don't have the motor anymore.  Also, for sale are two bench
&gt;&gt;seats and some seat belts (non-retractable).

found a late 70's (76- 79?) kombi down in toronto w/ middle and rear seats
w/ headrests. interior is in very good shape overall. Seats are brown heat
pleated vinyl w/ no rips. Rubber mat (for passenger area) is in good shape
too. Anybody interested? The van is in a junkyard in toronto. i *think*
their phone number is (416) 461-0421. It is called i'd part it out, but i
have so much stuff already, i can't really find the space to store some
more seats!

i have no affiliation with this junkyard etc. they seem like your typical
surly junkyard people, but give them a call if interested. also if someone
is interested e-mail me privately and i'll try and get some more details.
