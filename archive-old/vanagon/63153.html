    I wonder what a orderly, group request for information and
assistance
on a Subaru to Vanagon conversion would have if send to Kennedy
Engineering. Obviously they acknowledge a market for the conversion kit
dismonstrated by their research in to the matter.
    If they were to receive serveral hundred inquires about the process
they MAY offer other services.
( list discounts or conversion installation)

   As a business person, I would be very motivated to provide services
to a group of 100 people offering ???$2000???  for a viable engine
alternative.

  What do you think?
