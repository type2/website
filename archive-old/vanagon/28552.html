Frank,

I don't know that it has anything to do with the cold, but the '86 I had 
would start running like crud and started missing on a semi-annual basis.

Solution: Each time it was the Bosch spark plug wires.  They are funky and
have resistors in them and when one cracks, or just plain quits working,
the engine would still run, but run like crud. 

I think they ran about $80.00 for the set.  

Good luck,
Trace Choulat

&gt; 
&gt; This one is weird, it's a momentary miss, like someone flipped the
&gt; ignition off for a fraction of a second.  It occurs at any power setting,
&gt; including idle.  If idling, the engine stalls about 1/2 the time.  At hiway
&gt; cruise it's a quick &quot;buck&quot;.  It happens at random, usually 1 to several
&gt; minutes between misses.  Stopping and letting it sit has no effect.
&gt; 
&gt; I've a reasonably new O2 sensor, temp sensor, and the harness fix installed.
&gt; Cap, rotor and plugs are in good shape.  The engine is new (&lt;20k) and
&gt; all the ground connections were redone last year, and appear to be good.
&gt; 
&gt; Last night I opened up the brainbox to look for the &quot;corroded steel lead
&gt; resistors&quot; and found no problem - plenty of pristine solder there.
&gt; 
&gt; (BTW - from the looks of the inside of the brainbox, it deem it unlikely
&gt; that the resistor solder joints are a common problem)
&gt; 
&gt; Anyone else experience this one?
