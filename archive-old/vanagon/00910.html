Subject: Passing Vanagons &amp; Westfalias

Just a comment about the Vanagons &amp; Westys seen in traveling.  I spent 2
days in Victoria,B.C. 2 weeks ago (I will be moving there in Sept. for a
sabbatical year).  While waiting for a bus on a Saturday afternoon near the
UVic campus I was startled to see 2 Westys pass in a couple minutes and 
started to count.  In just over 20 minutes till my bus came, I tallied 11
vanagons (all but 2 westys) 5 older westys and 4 older buses.  At one point
there were 3 westys in sight stimultaneously.  I felt like I'd died and gone
to VW heaven. This density may be reflected by the list membership since I 
have noted at least 2 or maybe 3 subscribers from Victoria, which is not a 
particularly large city.  I will be taking my 1982 diesel-&gt;jetta GL gas West-
falia from Newfoundland to Victoria sometime in August (Now there's a megatrip
 ;) )
