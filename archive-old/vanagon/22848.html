  OFFICE MEMO          Thanks for the help-soggy seats        Date:8/16/95

Thanks to all of you for the suggestions on the soggy seat problem in my
wife's van. She and the kids got back from their trip last night, and it was
my first chance to find out if the problem was resolved. It looks like it is
fixed, and as some of you suggested, it was a blockage in the air conditioning
drain on one side. She cut the tip of the tube off, cleaned out some gunk in
there, and then for some reason stuffed a towel in there. Tonight I have to
take the towel out. She could have caused an overheating problem with that
towel, but I didn't tell her that ;-). Anyway, the seat is still a little wet,
but it's not getting worse, and the floor isn't wet anymore at all, so I guess
the seat will dry out soon.
Their trip was a success, the 175k mile van ran beautifully the whole time,
through incredible heat in Arizona, thunder, lightning, tornado warnings, and
frightening downpours in Kansas, and my 14 year-old son getting to drive
illegally on several deserted stretches of road in Kansas, Nebraska, and South
Dakota. At one point he had a Bison walk into the road in front of him and
stop. He stopped in plenty of time and they scrambled for the camera. A great
time was had by all.
