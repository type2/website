I am down to the last couple of things for my toolbox.  I decided to 
buy 3/4&quot; drive sockets and breaker bar for the big stuff.  I don't 
plan on being anywhere near a Sears store with my bus much of time so 
this is my piece of mind.  Sears does not sell 6 point sockets for 
these big sizes.  They do sell 12 point.  I just got off the phone 
with Snap-On customer direct order line and this is what I heard.



     			Sears 12 point		Snap-On 6 point

30mm or 1 3/16&quot;		$8.99			$22.90

36mm or 1 7/16&quot;		$10.99			$27.99

42mm or 1 11/16&quot;	$13.99			$37.50

The Snap-On sockets are air-impact, industrial finish.  That is all 
they offer in those sizes.  They might be worth the money and I might 
just buy them one at a time as I need them but I was wondering if 
there are alternatives.  My brother works at a shop so he might get 
them cheaper than that, but I doubt it will save much.  Any other 
ideas?  Thanks, Jim
