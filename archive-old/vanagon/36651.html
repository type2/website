&gt;With all the recent wasserboxer bashing that has been going one, I am 
&gt;curious about the gasoline 1.8l conversion.  For those of you that have 
&gt;done this conversion, how does the van drive?  How would you say the 
&gt;torque curves compare on the 2.1 vs. the 1.8 inline?  It seems the 
&gt;horsepower ratings are about the same.
&gt;
&gt;I will probably be opting for a factory rebuild wasserboxer, but I too 
&gt;am curious as to why VW did not offer a gas 1.8 inline or even the 16v 
&gt;version.  Do these engines not have the lower end torque that a flat 
&gt;four can offer?
&gt;
&gt;

I do not recall the ratings, but the 1.8 has a longer stroke which helps make
more torque.  If it was a 2.0 liter, it would be even better.
