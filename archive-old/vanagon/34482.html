Subject: how 2 block fuel lines ?

     
     I've been working on replacing my engine (82 westy) for a while now, I 
     pick away at it slowly.
     
     When I pulled the engine I stuck pencils into the gas lines to keep 
     them from leaking all over the place (aka Muir).  When ( a few weeks 
     later) I put the new motor back in I (of course) had to pull the 
     pencils out.  I discovered that the pencils had deteriorated.  I 
     thought that I got all the junk out -  but I believe debris might 
     still be in there.  Once it warms up some I'll check it out.
     
     I'm looking for an alternative to pencils for blocking the lines.  I'm 
     not going to try plastic pens though.  It anyone has experience here 
     I'd love to hear about it.
     
     cheers
     
     john
