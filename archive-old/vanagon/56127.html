Subject: Re: If you've replaced your CV joints--please read

&gt;or not.  Mine were marked 12/82. Now one side is marked 5/79.
&gt;    BTW, if your having trouble with your CV's and your not into packing
&gt;new joints there is a place in Lebannon, NY call Axle Express (518)
&gt;794-6100, that sell rebuilt CV shafts for Vanagons and Buses for about
&gt;100 dollars, ready to install.

I've used Axle Express on my GTI and reccomend them highly (and have
mentioned them before on the list).  Along with excellent service and their
willingness to ship anywhere, they also give a LIFETIME warrantee!

The only drawback is that if they don't have a Van axle in stock, you have
to send them yours to rebuild.
