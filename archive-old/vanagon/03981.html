I have an '81 Vanagon camper, live in California, it has ~125K miles,
rebuilt engine, runs very well.

My dad just bought a '90 Vanagon camper, and later this month, he's
retiring to Washington State.  He doesn't read email, but sometimes I
post a question regarding his bus, so you might want to count it.
