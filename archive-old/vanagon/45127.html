&gt; &gt;Any listmembers able to comment, before-and-after-wise, on a VW engine that
&gt; &gt;got an aftermarket counterweighted crank?
&gt; 
&gt; Able?  Well I guess so.  Qualified?  Doubtful.  For the VW valve springs,
&gt; I'd also say 4000 RPM.  If you have the counter-weighted crank and stronger
&gt; valve springs, then you can move the RPM limit up.  I still try not to
&gt; exceed 5000 or 5500 even with a CW crank and dual springs.

My '57's 1776 has a CWd-crank.  It is smooth revving all the way up 
to the top.  I don't have a tach, but I push it on occasion enough to 
scare me and it's still smooth.
