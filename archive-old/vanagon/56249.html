Subject: March CCC's date suggestion


Two people have now called to my attention the fact that there
will be the &quot;Hale-Bopp/Lunar Eclipse&quot; on March 23-24, so it seems
a wonderful idea if we choose the weekend which contains this
date, if it works for everyone - and IF we can find a good place
to be without a bunch of crowds camping to go see the same thing.  :)

Please let me know if this date works.  So far, I think we have
7 vehicles wanting to go, so this could be a big one.

As much as I'm not crazy about the desert, I have to go with
Al Knoll on this one, since viewing in a less contaminated
air/light would be optimal.  I'm not in favor of returning to
Red Rock, but Al suggested maybe Anza Borrego or Joshua Tree,
or something else similar?

Let me know your thoughts
