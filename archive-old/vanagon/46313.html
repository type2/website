&gt; over-the-shoulder reading/dining light source, high efficiency (typically 
&gt; 80% light), a variety of potential color temperature lamps, and second 
&gt; position utility.  By placing the lamps high on the door's front surface, 
&gt; when the door is swung down to open, they'd also illuminate the engine 
&gt; compartment, bed reading, and the space hehind the rear hatch.

Sounds like a great idea - I had considered two lights - one facing 
down at the rear part of the cabinet to light the engine bay/cargo 
area, the other on the passenger side near the air vent. Your idea 
would cover both nicely, assuming you can find suitable lights. (I 
haven't seen much in the way of flourescent lights aorund here) Let us 
know how you make out.
