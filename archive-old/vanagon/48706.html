Subject: 87 Vanagon Syncro: tough intermittent engine problem

I posted a message along this line a while back and my thanks to those of
you who tried to help. Basically, my Vanagon has an intermitent engine
failure that started as a momentary hesitation and now most consitently
reveals itself as difficulty in restarting after a short drive (3-4mi) and
followed by a short stop (5-30min). Often the car will crank over but
gives no indication of wanting to fire. After trying several times over 5
min it usually, but not always, will start and then be fine. This is not a
completely predictable pattern.

tried solutions:
Mechanic one: replaced distributor and it seemed a little less prone to
the problem but not cured.

VW dealer: Cleaned up wiring on top of engine. Replaced throttle control
switch. Checked ground wires. Van failed and failed completely (restart
not possible with repeated trying over 1hr). After tow back to dealer the
mechanic tried various things and it restarted immediately when the
connector at back of distributor was unplugged and replugged. A little
piece of rubber in the connector was found and thought to be the problem
but I have had a return of the symptom. Once was in my driveway and I was
able to effect a cure by again disconecting and reconnecting that
connector. Tugging at the wires does not seem to cause any engine
problems.

So, I would have to conclude that the problem lies somewhere in the
circuitry involving that connector. Anyone have an idea what could be
wrong?

Thanks very much, Nelson Hogg
