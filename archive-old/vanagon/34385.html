Subject: RE: 'Boxer' engine

Boxer? From boxing? Absolutely!

I used to be a technical translator in Berlin (if you see any German 
construction equipment, I probably wrote the manual. Scary, huh?); I think the 
boxer=boxing version makes a lot of sense because &quot;boxen&quot; means (in German)

a) speakers ('geile Boxen, wa?')
b) the pit (as in car racing)
c) to box, as in boxing, the sport

Since &quot;Boxer&quot; means (in German) either a boxer (the guy who punches people) or 
a horizontally opposed engine, I think the derivation is right on. My .02. 
BTW, if anyone has any VW translation questions (names of parts, etc.) I can 
try my best.
