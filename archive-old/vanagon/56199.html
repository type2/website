Subject: Rear Hatch Adjustment

Hey Guys,

Has anyone adjusted their rear hatch at the hinges.  My hatch, when you
view it from the top, is closer to the body on the left side then the
right and also takes an extra push on the right to get it completely
closed.  It doesn't leak but I'd like to get it even.

TIA
