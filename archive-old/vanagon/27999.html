&gt;
&gt;While rotating the tires on the '85, I found this metal thing in the bag
&gt;with the jack.  It is marked &quot;10&quot; at one end &quot;13&quot; at the other.  Is this a
&gt;wrench?  Or is it some kind of magic de-tighten und unloosen device from
&gt;VW-GMbH?

It's an amulet. In the Harz mtns of Germany, near Wolfsburg, there are
trolls who worship the numbers 10 and 13, the former bringing good luck and
the latter bad luck (hence our fear of the #13).

Ferdinand Porsche was a great believer in mysticism. He decided every one
of the Volks should have a diviner.

You use the device sort of like the Romans used chicken bones. When you
want to make a decision but don't have the guts to do it, you throw the
device in the air and whichever number points towards you leads you to your
decision.
