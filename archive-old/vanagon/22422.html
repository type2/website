Subject: motor mounts


 Anyone ever experienced broken or worn motor mounts in a vanagon?
  - what are the signs? I'm sure mine are bad, but i'd like to see
     what you all have experienced...
  - plus i seem to think that i have to pull the muffler and cat to
    get access to change them.. that is prob. the best way, i guess...

  any ideas?   
       Patrick....
