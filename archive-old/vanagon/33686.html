Okay Joe,  lets look at this logically.  Obviously your bus is possessed by
evil spirits...see a priest.  Or else, you've been a bad boy and you're
being punished by God...again...see a priest.

But seriously,  Does the bus idle fine at all times?  Does this only occur
when you step down hard on the pedal in a hard acceleration or any time you
push on the pedal.

It sounds like the answer is not enough air or not enough gas.  I assume
that you've checked the carb by looking into the throat while someone steps
on the gas pedal to make sure gas is shot down from the accelerator pump.
To really eliminate the carb as a source of the problem, put the other carb
on and see if it still does the same thing.  If it does then we have to
look elsewhere for the problem.  Have you checked the air cleaner and tube
to make sure it's not blocked (like with a mouse nest).

WAIT!!!!! I just realized something.  Only after it's warmed up?  So when
it's cold and the choke is on and the mixture is fuel rich it runs fine?
And when it's warm and the choke is open and the mix is right then we gots
problems?  Are you sure the choke is opening back up?  Lock the choke open
while the engine is cold and see what happens.  Drive it around and see
what it does when it's warm.  Also, maybe it's heat related.  Something may
be cuting off the fuel or air once it has expanded with heat.

I still say try the other carb and see what happens.

&gt;The carb is original equipment, German made. (I have a Japanese 34PICT3
&gt;clone that I use as a parts carb, but that's different in several ways.
&gt;I've used the choke and some misc nuts and bolts off this.) I have rebuilt
&gt;the carb several times. Most recently, about 1 1/2 weeks ago. The problem
&gt;doesn't occur when engine is cold; only after engine warms up. I may be
&gt;wrong in calling it a &quot;Flat spot&quot;; it's more like a stalling. It occurs
&gt;only upon acceleration. It seems like the bus may be getting too much gas
&gt;as I press the pedal, or possibly too much air and not enough gas. I plan
&gt;to reposition the top fuel delivery &quot;faucet&quot; so that it shoots straight
&gt;down the throat of the carb. If that doesn't work, I'm going to dance
&gt;naked around the bus for 3 days and nights. :-b Joe
