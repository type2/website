Think of how easy it'll be to wash the dishes ;-)

You want a Pulse-Width Modulation type of speed control.  The
advantage of these is that they always apply full voltage, but for a
varying amount of time.  Motors like to have their full operating
voltage, or else they suck down much more current and heat up more.

FWIW, I went to a local RV supply place a couple of years ago to find
a replacement for the original hand-operated pump that was in the
Gerbil (1966).  They had the exact same pump (except that their's was
functional).  If they've got parts for campers dating back that far,
finding a replacement for something a third the age shouldn't be
difficult at all.
