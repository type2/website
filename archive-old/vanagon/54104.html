Subject: VW Settles w/ GM

Hey Guys,

In case you haven't read about it, VW and GM came to a settlement.  The
settlement included a cash amount and VW is going to use GM parts.

I know VW uses Ford parts in some of their European models (found this
out while in the mid-west) for the A/C control panels.  I wonder what
parts GM is going to supply.
