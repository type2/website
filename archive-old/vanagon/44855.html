A radio station here in Dayton (Cincinnati?) Ohio is having a contest
where you can win their station VW bus &quot;Because our funding
is being cut on advertising.&quot; Listening to the commercials, you 
need a tow truck to get it home: the contest is everytime you
hear them trying to start it on the radio and it fails to start, be
caller #9 and you are entered in the contest......

Station 102.9.....

Geosh
Owner 77 Bus (for that stat list) Dayton, Ohio
