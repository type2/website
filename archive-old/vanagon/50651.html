Subject: Front Speakers

Hey Guys,

Just replaced the front speakers.  I found out a couple of things that
didn't seem to get mentioned before.

First, if you got the molded plastic type stock blauplunk, the speaker
screws out.  On the inside of the panel there is a collar that acts like
a big nut to hold the speaker against the panel.  Second, The speaker is
glued to the molded plastic grill. It ain't worth even trying to reuse
the original grill.

Hope it sounds better now.
