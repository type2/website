Subject: Re: Westy roof rack question

&gt;Does anyone have any words to the wise regarding the idea of putting
&gt;gutter-mount roof racks (Yakima) on the pop-up top of a Westy, using bolt
&gt;on adaptors? I'm looking at a max load of maybe 100 lbs., and usually
&gt;much less. My usual load will be windsurfing masts, and I'd rather be
&gt;able to open the top with them still attached. Comments, anyone?

I bought my bus with these side mount Yakima racks that create a false
&quot;gutter rail&quot; mount to the pop-top...

I just traveled 1200 miles to Cape Hatteras with my windsurfing board, 4
sails, mast, and two booms. Absolutely no prob. And there were 41 knot
winds. (  :*))

I also sometimes leave the board on and pop the top with no problem (it's a
small liter (volume) board.)

These mounts are great, because you can still pop the top, which I do regularly.
