&gt; 
&gt; Wes, this is the exact question that I have been tying to answer for weeks
&gt; relating to the '67 Westy project. In short, I have heard &quot;guru-expert&quot;
&gt; advice from both schools of thought relating not only to the oil cooler but
&gt; also the external oil filter.
&gt; Protection of the components seems to be one thought ~ inside the compartment.
&gt; Cooling of the oil is the other school~ outside of the compartment as long
&gt; as they are out of the *immediate* vacinity of the exhaust.
&gt; 
&gt; Actual location (available space) of the 72-pass Mesa cooler with the
&gt; electric fan is my problem. Folks are apted to say that they will fit up
&gt; above the rear axle half on the driver's side. I have tried everyway
&gt; possible to fit the items in this area to no avail. Investigation leads me
&gt; to believe that the recommendations actually come from Type I folks who run
&gt; J-tubes, not Type II folks with heaterboxes. I am tempted to ask them to
&gt; prove their point. ;-). Another suggestion boils down to some sort of
&gt; cutting of the metal in the driver's side battery tray coupled with some
&gt; sheet metal fabbing to create an exit port/dump for the hot air coming off
&gt; of the cooler. I'll be &quot;darned&quot; if I am going to cut anything on my '67 bus
&gt; at this point.
&gt; The same 50% of the &quot;experts&quot; consulted say that I shouldn't need the
&gt; cooler. The other 50% say &quot;Congratulations on building a motor that's going
&gt; to seize in two months with out it.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; I am frustrated to the point of where I am tempted to cop out and simply
&gt; install a stock DP with dog house and drive the silly thing. Admittedly,
&gt; it's may be (or is) a matter of the VW Peter Principal in my case. I need
&gt; answers also!

I run a 61 with a 1600 doghouse. Use a 67 tranny and 30X9.5 mudders.
Push this sucker ALL day at 65-70 in Florida without *overheating*.

I also run 93 octain fuel, 6.8:1 compression, hemi-cut heads, and a 30 PICT-1 
carb. Use a full-flow oil filter and 20W oil! Still hold 50 psi.

Feed 'em right, and keep it tight and timed.

Have fun

Douglas
