Subject: Safety of Vanagons, at least...

	A friend has relatives in Sweden and they sent a magazine with
pictures showing a Vanagon and a Volvo station wagon (safest in
the world, right?) in an offset head-on. The Vanagon went *OVER*
the hood of the Volvo and broke the windshield and A pillar.
For the Volvo driver, this was not a survivable accident.
Both were going medium speed- 60kmph (35mph?). For the VW
driver and passenger, there would have been every chance of
walking away. The VWs doors all opened normally after
the collision.

	Maybe the best defense is a good offense... use the
other guy's crush zone first...
	

	(Joel, Bob, the Isetta Doria joke is awful, I loved it!)
