In the absencs of any to date this week may I offer the following - -


A boy was crossing a road one day when a frog called out to 
him and said, &quot;If you kiss me, I'll turn into a beautiful 
princess.&quot; He bent over, picked up the frog and put it in 
his pocket.

The frog spoke up again and said, &quot;If you kiss me and 
turn me back into a beautiful Princess, I will stay with 
you for one week.&quot; The boy took the frog out of his pocket, 
smiled at it and returned it to the pocket.

The frog then cried out, &quot;If you kiss me and turn me 
back into a Princess, I'll stay with you and do *Anything* 
you want.&quot; Again the boy took the frog out, smiled at it 
and put it back into his pocket.

Finally the frog asked, &quot;What is it? I've told you I'm a 
beautiful Princess, that I'll stay with you for a week 
and do *Anything* you want. Why won't you kiss me?&quot;

The boy said, &quot;Look, I'm a computer programmer. I don't 
have time for girlfriends, but a talking frog is really cool.&quot;



What if - - we used &quot;search and replace&quot; on the above and the target words of
&quot;frog&quot; and&quot; VW transporter&quot; (excepting the bit about  &quot;pocket&quot; maybe we could
use &quot;garage&quot;?--   Will wonders never cease?  :)
