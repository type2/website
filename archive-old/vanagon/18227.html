Subject: RE: Tires for '76 Westy


_______________________________________________________________________________
&gt;I need recommendations for front tires for a '76 Westfalia, gotta
&gt;replace the &quot;cupped&quot; tires on there now so I can get the ok to
&gt;carry the baby seat (to say nothing of Mr. Beep) from my wife.
&gt;I'll happily spend $$$ for good tires. Please share good+bad experiences.

Yokohama Y370G, 8ply rated 65 PSI max (I run at 38/42), open decent all 
season tread, quiet, installed _at_ $100 CDN each + txs. Same price as Sears 
Trailhandler, less than Uniroyal Laredo, Michelin, Conti, all of which are 6 
ply tires. Unless some one sells you used tires for $15 each (grumpf!) you 
can't beat them, IMHO. Don't buy Conti(nental), again IMHO. tim s.     

   Thank you!! Very much! You read the post about the $15 Eurovan
   tires too, eh? one of those &quot;why doesn't stuff like that happen
   to me&quot; stories!!!

-&gt; if your tires are cupped you've got front end probs! get an alignment and 
save your new sneakers from abuse.

   Ya, it's on the &quot;A&quot; list
