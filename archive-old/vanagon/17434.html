&gt; 
&gt; One is add an extra oil cooler.

Wouldn't you want the oil cooler to be mounted outside the engine 
compantment so yer not heating the air the cooling fan is sucking in to 
cool your engine with?  I've toyed with the idea of installing an 
auxilliary oil cooler too, and thought a good place to mount it mount it 
would be up above the tranny.  But then again, I don't have the extra 
cooler, so what the hell to I know?  :)

FWIW, I drove around pretty much the entirety of Mexico just a few months 
ago, and oil temps were high, but not crazy.  Cruising at 45-50 mph on 
flats in 80 - 90 F temps gave usually 230 - 250 F oil temp (as measured 
from the dip stick), although hard climbing in 2nd (and even 1st on some 
highway grades =:O  ) could go as high as 290 F.  Gets that high, I back 
WAY off, even let the poor thing cool down.  Changed the oil alot running 
that hot in the mountains.  

For all folks Mexico-bound: Bring your own extra oil for all anticipated 
oil changes for the time you'll be in Mexico.  Oil is VERY expensive in 
Mexico, especially in the more southern regions, and particularly for 
multi-grade, which isn't used much in Mexico.  We're talking up to 30 
pesos a QUART for Valvoline or Quaker State 20/50--thats like $6.00 US!!  
And, no, this was not just the gringo price, although it might be 
inflated as 20/0 may be a &quot;gringo oil&quot;.
