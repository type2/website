Subject: Cooling system flush

Hi y'all.... Somebody please help me... I've decided it's time to change
coolant in my 89' Westy, and in every set of instructions,  it mentions that
the front must be raised 40cm or about 16 inches in order to prevent air
re-entering system on refill... WHEW!.  Now,  my question is.... how do you
lift the front of the vehicle 16 inches without some very heavy duty, or
costly jacking system?  The cost of letting the dealer flush the coolant
system might be minimal compared to the cost of buying such a jack.

Thanks in advance for any knowledgeable help!!!  P.S.   anybody in Western
Tenn, or Eastern Ark. looking for guy who likes to camp regularly in all
seasons.. look no further.....
