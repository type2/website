Have you checked the idle regulator (small black box to the right of the
igniter?) and the auxiliary air intake? On the former, disconnect fron 
the regulator and connect the two ends together and see if anything
different happens; on the latter if the aux. air intake is not closing
after warm-up this will lead to poor idle -- 
a more ominous possibility is unequal compression or poor valve intake - the
former can be checked (an engine with unequal compression cannot be tuned
properly). DC
