Ben, I have an 82 westy, with 161 k. About 12k ago, I put in a Gex
rebuilt, with a second cooler. The synthetic has been in only for six months
and about 3k. It is too early to have a definitive answer for you, but
there are two things  Ihave noticed thus far: a) better flow
characteristics at startup and b) different heat retention; it sheds heat
much more quickly than dino oil. This has led some people to argue that
the heat is transferred onto the engine block and causing overheating .
The head temp gauge thus far indicates little difference between the two
so I cannot say for sure if synth is bad for air-cooled engines.

As for the cooler it is somewhat jury rigged: an empi cooler mounted above
the tranny with &quot;homebuilt &quot;fan and switch. It works well. As of now I am
installing an oil temp gauge so I will have some answers for you. If you
areoverheating this may be a way to go ....as for heads consider GEX or
someother outfit in CAL. I have some addresses if you need them Regards -
David C.
