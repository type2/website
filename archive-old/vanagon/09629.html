Subject: How about a NW gathering?

I think the majority of us in the Pacific Northwest live in WA.W, right?
(With a few in BC/OR.) The travel distances would be fairly short, I
would think. And everyone would get to see the `66 bubbletop camper
with the `76 Pinto taillights! (I DID NOT DO THIS!!!) And it would give
me some incentive to put the new transaxle in, so I could make the trip!
