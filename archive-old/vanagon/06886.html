Subject: Re: vw magazines

&gt;gerry asked me to post the addresses/cost/and so forth of all the vw
&gt;magazines 'out there', but since i'm at &quot;work&quot; (hahahahahahaahha!) right
&gt;now, and since i don't really know everything, i thought it would be a
&gt;good topic to ask:
&gt;
Should include &quot;European Car&quot;, formerly &quot;VW and Porsche&quot; until they let in 
the Bimmer/Jaguar/Mercedes crowd. Good rag, avoids T&amp;A, mostly on 
rabbit/golf/jetta/corrado, tech tips useful for the fiddly jobs like CV 
greasing, cable replacements etc. Not much Vanagon stuff, but hell I own a 
Rabbit anyhow.    tim s., his $0.02
