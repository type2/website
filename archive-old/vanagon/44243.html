Subject: Re: CB placement

I have one of the  el cheapo small units I got from DAMARK -- it fits
very nicely in the left door pocket of the '87 Wolfsburg Weekender :-)
Oh, the antenna is a Radio Shack Cellular look-alike, works fine for my
kind of use (road information queries, emergencies, etc...)

&gt;&gt;To all of you bus owners with CBs, where did you mount them?  Please
