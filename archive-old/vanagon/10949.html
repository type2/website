&gt;BTW, I've been looking at some early '80s Vanagon Westies with a friend.
&gt;Some of the ones we've looked at have an air intake grill that is part of
&gt;the metal pressing that makes up the side of the vehicle. Other ones have
&gt;a black plastic affair with vanes that appear to divert the air down into
&gt;the duct to the engine. Is this just cosmetic or was a change made to correct
&gt;a problem with airflow?

i think it was a cost-cutting measure. it was cheaper and quicker to punch
the big hole and put the plastic thingie in, than to punch the little holes
and roll the edges. also easier to paint inside that big hole.
