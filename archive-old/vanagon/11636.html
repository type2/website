Subject: roof racks

i recall there being a thread on roofracks a month or so ago, but my
question has a slightly different spin on it.

A friend of mine is looking for roofracks that bolt on to the raingutter of
a 87' Westfalia. I know that Yakima and Thule make such roofracks (that can
clear the height of the fibreglass roof) but I have forgotten the part or
model #'s of these roofracks. Does anybody out there know the part or model
# for these racks for either yakima or thule?

Also any thoughts on who makes a better roofrack. I realize that bolting
the roofrack to the fibreglass top offers more convenience in term of
opening and closing the roof, but my friend doesn't want any holes drilled
in the pop top.
