Subject: last minute checks


    Hi all,
    
        I will be unsubscibing from the list for two weeks from 
tommorrow as I am going on holiday. I will be taking the camper 
('71) to the west coast of France. I have replaced the plugs, checked 
the points, set the timing, checked the valves and changed the oil 
(andjoined the AA!). Can anyone think of anymore last minute checks I 
should make before I set off on the trip ?  Also what spares do 
you recomend (space and cash are limited)? Since getting the camper 
last year I have only made a couple of long trips, so the van is 
relatively untested, so please keep your fingers crossed for me. I 
will let you know how I get on when I get back. Thanks in advance for 
any help.

                    Cheers
                    
                            Jon
