Subject:      Eurovan AC Suggestions

Here's suggestion for protecting the EV Receiver/Dryer from stones, etc.
Get either a 2 litre soda bottle, or a 1 gallon round plastic bottle and an
xacto knife. Crawl under the right front (it helps if the front wheels are
pointed far to the right to clear the r/d unit). You will notice that the
R/D unit is held on by a large hose clamp. Loosen the hose clamp.

The bottle will serve as a stone deflector. It is important that the top of
the bottle points down as it will serve as a drain for the deflector (of
course make sure that you remove the cap!). All you need to do is to trim
the bottle so that it covers the pop-off valve and that it surrounds the
R/D unit, and of course make sure that the &quot;shield&quot; fits under the clamp.

Once you have it trimmed, put the shield in place and tighten the clamp.


As to the resistors, here's something to do.....I've gone through 2 sets of
resistors...the first was replaced under warranty. The second set the
dealer charged me $60/ea. I wasn't too happy. But here's what I did...I
kept the parts receipt. VW has a 12 month/12k mile warranty on their
parts....10 motnths later I went to the dealer with the second set of
resistors and said: &quot;The resistors I bought last year burned out....I want
a new set under warranty&quot;...

I now have a spare set of resistors!
