Subject: Re: on oil level

Well.. I think I'll combine both this thread and the one on reusing 
engine cases.  I rebulit a case that a &quot;friend&quot; overheated and I didn't 
get it align-bored.  But I never had a problem with over heating.  

The worst conditions were 90 degree weather going over &quot;the hill&quot; to
Pleasonton at about 60-70 MPH.  It's not a big hill, but I pushed it a
little.  And the HIGHEST that I ever saw it was 230 degrees.  And the
dipstick was always cool enough to pull out.  And that was with a fairly 
full oil level.

In the winter though, it only got up to about 160-180 degrees.  That's in
40-60 degree weather.  Of course the engine only lasted 20k miles.  But it
might have been short lived from the wrist pin clip that fell off also. 

So there was a rebuilt case that stayed cool.  Does anyone have proof 
that align-bored engines run hot?

Bradley
