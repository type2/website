Subject: RE: dangerous fume from battery

&gt;For several months, inside the passanger compartment of the '83 Vanagon,
&gt;I could always smell vinegar. I just found out its 5-year old battery's
&gt;fluid leaked. (The battery is located under the front passenger seat.)
&gt;To be fumigated in an acid fume chamber for months is not the best thing
&gt;I expected.
&gt;
&gt;I am amazed by this kind of hazardous design (to have the battery inside
&gt;the passanger compartment) from VW.
&gt;
Where have you been ? ;-)  VW Beetles have always had their batteries under
the back seat.  Ever heard of someone riding in the back seat, and shorting
out the battery?  Happened all the time.  Regular vehicle maintenance should
always include an inspection and cleaning of the battery.  The vinegar smell 
should have been a dead giveaway that there was a battery problem, so now
you'll know for next time.
