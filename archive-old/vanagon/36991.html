Subject: questions about original air cleaners and tin


Hi Folks,
   I find myself in need of a stock air cleaner.  I recently had to 
rebuild my 30-PICT-1 carb and the PO had a stupid aftermarket wire mesh 
type air filter on it. It fell off and was eaten (the rubber part) by the 
lower pulley.  I replaced it with another stupid aftermarket job with a 
paper filter and some of my carb problems went away.  I was experiencing 
strange behavior like the engine would quit when coming to a stop.  The 
idle is still kinda strange but it now idles at less than a thousand rpm 
when warm at near two thousand when cold. I suspect my idle mixture is 
still not right and I'll look into it this weekend.  I will need the 
stock air cleaner when I have to smog the vehicle next year and I suspect 
that it will give me better performance than the aftermarket types.  I 
have a '69 with a 30-PICT-1 carb on a 1600 sp engine.  If anyone knows of or 
has one of these air cleaners please let me know.  Also there is a place 
in the tin for a pre-heater hose to go thru and it has a blocking plate 
over it now.  I'd like to restore the tin to the correct configuration if 
possible.  What is missing besides the hose to the carb?


Thanks

Scott
