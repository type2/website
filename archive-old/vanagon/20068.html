&gt; Subject: Re: T-IV engines
&gt; You've got me scratching my head.   There aren't any 1600cc Type IV engines.
&gt;  And the Type IV requires a rear engine mount (it's about 100 pounds heavier
&gt; than the engines having magnesium crankcases).

I know that the TIV engine is quite a bit different. But, By T-III engine
has a rear mount. Is the T-IV mount much different?

&gt; If you have a Type IV installed it would be a 1700, 1800 or 2000, and yes,

I have a T-III installed right now, pancake with FI.

&gt; with minor variations the Type IV bus engines will work in the 411's.  But
&gt; the key word there is 'minor' -- if you're missing some of the bits it may
&gt; render such a swap impossible, as the parts for some configurations are very
&gt; difficult to find.
&gt; 
&gt; But if you have the 'normal' Type III installation, your engine is based on
&gt; the Type I crankcase.  Installation of a Type IV engine calls for some 
heroic
&gt; measures, such as changing the clutch and flywheel, fabricating a rear 
engine
&gt; mount and so forth.
&gt;-- And that's all Veeduber_at_aol_dot_com wrote!

Now you are scaring me. I was kinda hoping that the flywheel and bellhousing
was very similar. And The rear mount bolted up in the same way.

The T-IV engines I am looking at are still in the busses they started
in, and I have the choice of three, up to 74, I think? What
year did the bus get 2000cc? So, parts should not be a problem,
unless they are worn out or sat too long.

Am I breathing too many gas fumes here????
