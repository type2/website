Subject: Re: Help my brakes on '67

&gt;
&gt;3) Would purchasing a new master cylinder help?
&gt;
or rebuilding... you may have pushed the seals in the master cyl. into areas 
they never went before when the rear cyl blew. Dirt/gunge may be interfering 
with the seating. Try bleeding to purge some gunge, nextstep: rebuild, real 
cheep compared to buying a new/rebuilt cyl, unless you bust off stuff, which 
you will due if you replace it anyhow.    tim s.   oh... are the shoes 
'green' and just braking in? :)  2&quot; travel is lots tho', bye
