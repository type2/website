FYI, my '83.5 (H2O) has an O2 sensor.

&gt; &gt; I hadn't either, but there is a cap on the exhaust pipe where the O2
&gt; &gt; sensor should go.  There also doesn't seem to be a spare wire on the
&gt; &gt; pig-tail indicating that it is missing? Got me!

&gt; &gt; I am not familiar with any FI vehicles without an O2 sensor.

&gt; &gt; &gt;Sorry, I forgot to mention it is an 82 westy, 120k and as far as I can
&gt; &gt; &gt;tell, it doesn't have a O2 sensor??

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; Well, many of our beloved FI VWs came without O2 sensors.  All Type 3s,
&gt; All Type 4s, Beetles '75-'79 and Buses '75-'79 and Vanagons '80-'83 that
&gt; had fuel injection did NOT have O2 sensors, EXCEPT for some California
&gt; models.  
&gt; 
&gt; I believe the only air-cooled Vanagons with O2 sensors are California
&gt; models.  I know my '81 doesn't have one and it's not supposed to.  
&gt; 
&gt; I know the '79 CA Buses had O2 sensors, and even tho the '78 CA Buses
&gt; had catalytic converters, i don't think they had O2 sensors.  
&gt; 
&gt; The CA air-cooled Vanagons also have electronic ignition while the
&gt; federal models have standard points-and-condenser ignition.  
&gt; 
&gt; When they switched to the wasserboxer, I think they all got O2 sensors.
