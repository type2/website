Subject: Type I thermostat

To All:

The thermostat on the early Type I and II engines is a brass bellows filled
with a liquid that vaporizes as it becomes hot, causing the bellows to
expand.

The air vanes in the blower housing are fitted with a coil spring intended to
hold them open.  The cold (short) thermostat serves to hold the air-vanes
CLOSED against the spring tension.  As the thermostat expands, the spring
pulls the air-vanes open.

Failure of either the spring, located on the connecting rod on the front of
the blower housing, or of the bellows, can cause the engine to overheat.

Volkswagen originally offered the bellows in three heat ranges.  The range is
marked on the bellows.  Replacement bellows are available from most
after-market suppliers but usually in only one heat range.

The most common failing of the thermostatic control is the spring, which
usually wears itself away where it is hooked into either the blower housing
or the connecting link.  The bellows usually fails due to mechanical damage
or corrosion.  Both spring and bellows are easily checked during normal
maintenance.

The positive check for the thermostat is to heat it in a pan of water until
it is fully expanded and to measure that expansion.  Since the bellows has
deep folds corrosion often isn't visible.

Should your engine overheat due to failure of the bellows or spring, unscrew
the bellows from its operating rod and fasten the air-vanes in the open
position.  It will get you home but don't plan on running the engine without
the thermostat even in a warm climate.  Doing so causes prolonged warm-up and
results in accelerated cylinder and valve guide wear.
