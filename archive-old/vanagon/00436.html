Derekdrew hat gesagt:&gt; 
&gt; Even a 100 amp heater at 12 volts is not enough to make much of a dent in the
&gt; heating system of an air cooled bus. And such a heater would quickly burn out
&gt; a 100 amp alternator.
&gt; 
no electrical heaters for my bus!!! I'm talking convective heat loss from
the motor/oil.
