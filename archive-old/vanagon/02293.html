&gt;&gt;- why did VW replace these engines after only three years of production?
&gt;
&gt;ok. first, that engine (the type 4 engine) was not in production for just
&gt;three years. it was first introduced in 1969 in the porsche 914. the 1983
&gt;air-cooled bus was the last evolved model of that engine. so the production
&gt;run was more like 14 years, during which time the displacement grew from

I think the production run was longer.  Correct me if I am wrong, but I think
it was introduced in the 1968 VW 411 and then later in the 1970 Porsche 914.
We had a 72 411
Fastback one time.  This engine had the high compression pistons and fuel
injection.  I think it was rated at 85 HP.  I was thinking of a way to put
this engine in our 72 bus at the time
