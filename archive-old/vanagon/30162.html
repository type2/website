&gt; I only ask due to the potential that I need a muffler for the '83 2.0
&gt; Aircooled Van that I drive. Is there a difference between the '82 and the
&gt; '83 2.0 aircooled engines?  Most folks seem to feel that the only engine

Early '83 Vanagons had air-cooled engines.  If someone referes to a 
Vanagon as an '83 1/2 then they probably mean it's a waterboxer.
As far as I know the air-cooled Vanagon engines were basically the same.
