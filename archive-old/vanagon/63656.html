Subject: Re:SAW A SAHRAN IN CHICAGO AREA

WHILE TRAVALING SOUTH ON I294 BETWEEN MILWUKEE AND CHICAGO I SAW A WHITE
SAHRAN WITH STATE DEPT PLATES. KIND OF NEAT LOOKING VEHICLE BUT KIND OF
SMALL. COULDN'T TELL IF IT HAD A THIRD REAR SEAT. IT RESEMBLES A MAZDA MPV OR
THAT THING THAT HONDA MAKES. ASIDE FROM BEING SMALL IT LOOK S LIKE A NICE
CAR.   SPENCER
