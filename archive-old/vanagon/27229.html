Subject: bleed &amp; adjust brakes.....(1962)

Finally got around to doing this yesterday.
Ran into a couple of problems, and being a complete novice I don't know what
to do about them.

1) The adjusters on one of the rear hubs are absolutely solid. I bent my
screwdriver trying to shift 'em. I guessed it might be a bit rash to
squirt penetrating oil all over the place :) but how else do I sort it out?

2) The bleed bolts on both front hubs are not only the wrong size (12mm
instead of 7mm), but they are worn smooth - nothing will grip them. I
suppose I _could_ get them off with a vicegrip or something but then how
would I replace them?

any ideas????

Thanks!

Sarah
