Subject: RE: Which tires?185 or 205

I run 185 load rated 'D'  Gislaved snows in winter and
205/70 Michelin MXL reinforced otherwise.  On dry conditions, the 185's
are more squirelly and I tend to get blown around much more.  I run with
recommended pressures on the door panel (something like 38/48psi on 185's,
and 30/40 on 205's).  My snows are studded although I don't think this makes
much difference.

If you can find 205's with good snow traction, go with these.  the MXL's
are not good in snow.  In any event, get reinforced or load rated 'C' or
'D'.
