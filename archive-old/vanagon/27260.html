&gt;     People tend to drive maniacally here in San Diego, and 
&gt;     inexplicably tailgate at all times. I'm about as patient
&gt;     as the next person, but there have been a few times when
&gt;     I'm a tad upset about having some jerk glued to my rear
&gt;     bumper AND I STAND ON THE F*****G BRAKES!!! Then give
&gt;     them a nice smile and wave, knowing that they've soiled
&gt;     their shorts in fear of running into me.

I know a guy who did this, and was rewarded by being rear-ended, hard.
Totalled his rabbit! :-(
