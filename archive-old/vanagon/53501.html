Subject: Idle Stab.-- quick fix
Date: Thu, 26 Dec 96 12:39:49 -0600

with the previous few mornings being 'a little cold' as we say, minus -40F,
the van always balks and grumbles at being dragged out.  this is the time of
year that the summer's accumulation of grunge affects the idle stabilizer
and results in a 2000-3000 rpm idle on cold days.  its cleaning is one of
those &quot;i'll get to it soon&quot; projects that never seem to materialize.  today
when i ran out for lunch the idle got to me.  i felt like everyone was
thinking i was driving a Volkwagen :)

so the little Better Idea light bulb went off in my head (or were those
retinal disturbances a carryover from last year's Methylene Chloride
poisoning?).  how about a squirt of lock de-icer in the little bugger.  i
got out, propped the hatch open with my head (new struts still lying under
the seat), removed the stabilizer intake tube, squirt-squirt some de-icer
and closed 'er up.

runs like a champ!  idles normal.  and now i don't think people suspect i
drive a VW.
