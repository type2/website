I think it's psychological.  If it has VW on it, you gotta pass it!

Here is the scenario, I'm crusing up I-95 around 75-80mph.  I come upon a 
&quot;family sedan&quot; running about 70mph, I pass and continue on my happy way.

All of a sudden, family sedan is doing 85mph, passes me, pulls in front 
of me and promptly brings it back down to 70mph.

&gt;From there on, round and round we go.

Does this sound familiar?


very familiar.  That and cutting you off in city traffic for no reason.
  Irarely get cut off driving the bug  (my real car),  though I drive the
same, cept faster on freeways.    This is why I like 6V horns.. .     I
recommends them to all 12 volters - tell them loud and clear to not cut you
the fuck off.  You should see the nice shiny cars swerve back into their lane
when they realize the old wreck of a bus sure ain't letting them in. 

But ...  Don't you think they are embarrassed if you pass them in an old bus-
EVERYONE knows they go slow, ignore the speedometer,  we're losing!!!

used to have 12V '59 bus with splitcase tranny and excessive rust
