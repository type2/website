Subject: Re: Synchros

&gt;I've been reading the postings about Synchros.  They sound pretty 
great.  
&gt;Anybody know if they're still available new? 

Nope.

They were made in 86-87 and 89-91 (meaning they're all water 
cooled Vanagons). I don't know about total production, but Derek 
has indicated that there were only about 1200 Syncro Westfalias 
total (for all 5 years) in the US.

As with all busses they seem to be most common in the Pacific 
Northwest and California. I would give California the edge in 
terms of pricing (that's were I got mine, even though I live in 
Seattle). I have also heard reports of reasonably priced Syncros 
in the Denver area. 

Dealers have become quite savvy regarding these vehicles, meaning 
- unfortunately - that may be the only location you'll find one.

They seem to have lost very little in value over the years, and 
some on the list have even speculated that they are appreciating 
(especially the Westfalias and especially the 90-91's).
