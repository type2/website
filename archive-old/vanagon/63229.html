This is only true if you do not have a the rubber bumper strip running the
lenght of the bumper. The bumper strip makes it impossible to remove the
bolts without damaging a number of the plastic clips that hold it on.

The same goes for the front bumper again assuming that there is the two
rubber strips along the lenght of the bumper

&gt; you can just unbolt the blade from the brackets (4 13?mm bolts)
&gt; FAR easier than removing the brackets....
