Subject: '79 engine in '74?


Hey all, i have a friend who just had a '74 shell given to him, and is 
looking for an engine. The local junkyard just got a '79 that got into a 
bad front-ender, but the engine looks good. They want $650 for it. Seems 
to me like it will go, but I'm not sure about the match w/ the tranny. 
Any thoughts? its a FI, BTW.
