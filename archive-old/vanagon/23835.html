Subject: 2 liter engine needed, SoCal

Volks,
	My poor bus has been sitting for over a month now with no motor.
I'm itching to get it back on the road.  What I'm looking for is a good
2-liter short block with hydraulic lifters.  I don't want to pay more
than $200 for it.  Almost had one last weekend at the junkyard (from an
81 Vanagon) but couldn't get it out of the van.  They  only had an
engine hoist and wouldn't let me bring in a floor jack.  Morons.  If
anyone has such a beast or know where it can be had, please let me know!

Oh, does anyone know for sure if the vanagon short block is *exactly*
the same as the 77-78 bus motor?  I could have gotten that vanagon short
block for $90, but I noticed the rear engine mount looked a little
different, and now I'm not sure the case is the same.  

Thanks for any help,

-David
