        Chuck:
        
        Count me in.  It's a good idea especially if the Vanagon owner is 
        dealing with the same type of anal orifices that pass for 
        insurance adjusters as I am.  21 year old cocktail waitress slams 
        into the rear of our new E-Van which was stopped at a traffic 
        light.  Her first question to the cop:
        
        &quot;Who's fault is it?&quot; 
        
        The penis head insurance adjuster insists that we take it to a 
        fly-by-night body shop that they contract with.  What's wrong 
        with that picture?
        
        IAE, that's what lawyers (another class of ethically deficient 
        cretins) are for.  I have to deal with them to get our vehicle 
        fixed but I don't have to respect them.  Probably, the vanagon 
        owner's insurance company will call it an &quot;Act of God&quot; or &quot;Civil 
        Disturbance&quot; to get out of paying.  I hope somebody gets more 
        information and I would be willing to help act on your good 
        intention.
        
        Peace,
        Skip
