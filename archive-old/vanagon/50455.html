Hey a dumb question:

Does the lights come on at all when you jiggle the shifter once is in   
reverse?  For the longest time I thought my lights didn't work and it   
turned out that when I jiggled the shifter into reverse, it would go on   
and off.  I never got around to tightening and cleaning the electrical   
connections.

Subject:  87 Syncro: backup lights problem

My backup lights are no longer working. Don't know when they stopped but   
I
suspect it was after recent work at the garage connected with electrical
problems - eventually leading to replacement of the computer. I've   
checked
the easy things - fuse and lights themselves. I have no idea where the
switch is located. Do any of you have suggestions?

Thanks, Nelson Hogg
