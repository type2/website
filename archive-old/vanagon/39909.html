Subject: GEX update

     Reminder:  I sent my GEX 1600 SP rebuild back to them for numerous 
     problems.  
     
     Recieved an e-mail today from GEX pres. that a new motor was on its 
     way as of yesterday.  That has to be one day at the most from when 
     they received my old one (purchased June 95).  This is what I was 
     hoping for and I e-mailed back to them that I hoped the next message 
     they get from me is one telling them how happy I was from the top of 
     the mountain at the Blue Ridge rally. 
     
     My fingers are crossed.
     Ray
