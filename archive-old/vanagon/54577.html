Subject: Paint and Bumper progress (long)

Hey guys,

As many of you know, over X-Mas I spun out in Indiana and Hit the guard
rail.  When I got back to Philly I started the repair process.

First I went shopping for bumpers and was able to get them used. I
bought them at night and in the dark (stupid) and realized when I got
home that the rear bumper I bought would now be designated as a spare
(more dings than I thought on inspection), the end caps where in worse
shape than I thought and the rubber strip was functional but had non VW
clips to secure it that needed exposed screws to hold it on.  

So I bought a new rear bumper and new end caps from another source.  The
new bumper is not as heavy as the original but looks great. I decided to
add strength to it by cutting my old bumper so that it fit inside of the
new one (I pity the fool that rear ends me now). The caps seem fine but
the source accidently sent me 4 of the same part number (it's getting
straigtened out as I write this).

I went to VW to get the rubber strip, the parts guy sold it to me at the
warranty rate (saved me $25) and threw in the clips.  I noticed the
metal strip on the back did not have the hole punched in it for the
clips and was told to drill them out, impossible.  Now I know why I got
it at a discount.  Needless to say I've had to improvise again and glue
the strip on.

Now the paint, I went to the local body shop and had them straighten out
the metal and fix a couple of other PO dings and paint it.  For what I
paid they did a good job.  I got hit the night I brought it home from
the body shop (previous posting). Went back to the shop yesterday to get
some touch up paint.  They were really nice, first they offered to buff
it out for free, but upon inspection saw the paint got ripped, so they
offered to repaint it for $75 . I did not take them up on that (I put
the lock on my pocket book) but did again for some touch up paint.  They
GAVE me more than a pint of paint along with the other chemicals
needed.  Now all I gotta do is dig up my paint guns.

I know this is long, but I just need to say that after all of this time
and money spent I came to the realization in the middle of the night,
that it's a VW and I should treat it like all of the VWs I've owned
previously - TLC and DIY.  Rubberbands and chewing gum are what make VWs
VWs.

Thanks for the rant
