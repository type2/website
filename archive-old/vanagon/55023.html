Try removing the spark plug and cleaning it. The running and shutting down
is a normal function. The heater has a flame sensor. The heater has so much
time to produce a certain amount of heat and it will continue to run. If it
does not meet this, it shuts down. This is to prevent fuel from being
dumped into the heater and not being burned and them suddenly igniting.
While the plug is out you can check for spark, plug the plug into the
connector and ground it and turn the heater on momentarily. You should see
spark. Next check is fuel delivery, you'll need the manual for the spec.,
So many cc's per minute or possibly for so many pump strokes. If you don't
have spark check into the combustion air blower motor. It also has the
points for the coil in it. HTH
