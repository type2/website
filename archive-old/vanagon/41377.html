Subject: Re: EV oil Change

I have changed the oil regularly for the last 2 years in the 93 EVan
(Mom-Mobile) using a black cap that fits over the end of the filter.  I add
an extension bar to the ratchet and both old and new filters come off and
go on easily.  I use the PER 316 or Wix 51773 (prefer the PER) and have had
no trouble. I bought the black thing that fits over the end of the filter
at my FLAPS on a whim when I got the PER filter.  So far, this combination
has worked fine.  $14.95 is a hell of a buy, Ric.  Labor should be more
than that!

The engine cover (gravel guard?) is a bitch to get on and off.  I use drive
on ramps for clearance but it still is a hassle.  It is good to check the
bottom end of the engine with the cover off; I agree that there is a lot of
interesting stuff down there.
