&gt; It may be different over there where you are...but in the great
&gt; state of Massahtwoshits, collision pays when you are at fault...
&gt; and if the other driver is at fault, then his insurance pays
&gt; for your damages. Then again, I guess the driver of the tank
&gt; didn't have collision...the vanagon owner could always
&gt; sue his estate...he did get shot didn't he?

Problem is as I understood it he was &quot;dumped by his girl friend, lost his 
job and losing his house.&quot;

Might not have an estate.

Did anybody get a good enough look to guess how old the Vanagon was?  If 
it was less than 5 years old it was probably fully insured.  If it was 
more than 10 years old it probably didn't.

Also I don't think insurance covers intentional damage - if the tank boy 
'tried' to damage the vanagon - sure looked like it -  the insurance 
doesn't have to pay.  Just one more way the insurance company 'protects' us.
