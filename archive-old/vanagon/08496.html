Subject: clutch replacement project

Well, the day has arrived.  I am forced to do something about the clutch 
in my '84 Vanagon. My guess is pilot bearing, but, of course, we won't 
know until we take it out.  Fortunately, when I mentioned that I needed 
to do this to my father, he offered to come down and help me out! I'm 
thrilled; I don't think I could have done it myself, and I certainly 
can't afford to hire it done.  I've got a couple of excellent 
descriptions from the list and Bentley's, so I think I'm set. 
I'll be doing it the Tuesday after Christmas. Wish me luck, eh?  
Until then, I'll be hunting for parts.  Hopefully I'll be able to get them
before then.  If anyone has some particular recommendations for clutch
parts from our voluminous list, I welcome all suggestions.
Thanks!
