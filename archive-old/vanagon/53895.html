Subject: Re: Is Lobro a good make for CV joint?

&gt;I can get a so called Lobro (umlaut over the first o) CV joint kit
&gt;(includes boot, grease, clips etc) for GB#41.12 (approx US$65).
&gt;
&gt;Are Lobro any good for CV joints?
&gt;

It's the OEM for VW, so it should be the best available. This is the CV of
choice for the Golfs/Jettas/Corrados etc.

James
