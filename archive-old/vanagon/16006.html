I got what was supposed to be this very thing from JC Whitney. What they 
sent me was a set of rubber strips from West Coast Metric. I didn't put 
them on right away, though, and when I finally got around to the project a 
couple of months later, I found that they didn't fit. There were two long 
and two short strips of rubber there and the long ones too long for the 
short edges of the hatch, but too short for the long edges. I still have 
the things, and still have not done the project. I am hoping that I can 
cut-and-piece, but haven't done the measuring for that yet...

The moral of the story, I guess, is have you talked to WCM? I would think 
that their price should be about the same as from JCW...And they would 
probably give you the right stuff...
