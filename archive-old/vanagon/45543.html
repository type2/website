&gt;
&gt;up from Montgomery to Nashville, across to St. Louis, then across Kansas
&gt;on I-70. Lawrence is only 40 miles from KC?? no way ... isn't lawrence the
&gt;town that's out by the army base Fort Riley???? that's where we went.  and
&gt;it was a looooooooong way from Kansas City. :(
&gt;
&gt;i'd have sworn it said &quot;Lawrence&quot; ... but then, i'd been driving for a long
&gt;groggy time. i know i stopped at Ft. Leavenworth for gas, cause i was almost
&gt;out ... put 16.1 gallons into a Vanagon. :) &lt;it has only a 16.0 gallon tank!&gt;

     You must be talking about Manhattan Kansas.  Its only about 110 miles
from KC. Fort Leavenworth is north of Kansas City.  Seems like you were a
little lost on this trip.  :-)
