Richard,

Add another yes vote.

I just begin to wonder the where, not so much when.  I live in DC, so NC is
no great haul, but for our New England friends to drive the distance (not to
mention the ENTIRE length of the New Jersey Turnpike ;) ) might be a little too much to ask.  Perhaps a check of yeas and nays from North and South and 
triangulate the closest spot, then do scheduling.

Just thinkin' agin'....
