Subject: F.I. intake runner hoses
Date: Tue, 5 Sep 95 10:46:11 EDT

Does anyone know a cheap source for the hoses between the intake
manifold runners and the little distribution box, WCM lists some
ridiclous figure like $20+ for the four little pieces of hose.
Funny thing is Automotion carries em for 914's and 912E's for
$2.50 a hose but alas there are two sizes and I don't know which
if either is correct.  My #3 hose is cracked and leaking badly,
I need help.  FWIW I measure the dimension of the runner at 37.5mm
(1.47&quot; or so) if anyone has another suggestion, I figure 1.5&quot; radiator
hose would be too big.
