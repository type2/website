&gt;Hi Folks. Has anybody used these spark plugs in the Vanagons?  My '90

i've never tried the bosch platinum, but have been using the bosch triple-
prong plugs for the last 6,000 miles ... and am happy with them.  i usually
replaced the plugs at about 10,000 miles, so i haven't seen what the effects
of running in this engine will be on the plugs or their gap.

&gt;Anybody have any experience with these plugs?  I picked up a set for
&gt;a little over $15 Can. at Canadian Tire.

these triple-prongs cost me about $3.50 US each.
