Subject: Interesting Camper Bus Sighting

Had to fly down to Little Rock yesterday. Leaving the airport by car, I saw
an interesting camper. It must have been a 72+ baywindow since the luggage
rack was up front. Everything seemed normal except that the camper top
looked like it was modified to fit almost into the gutter channels and
close to the bus...rounded along the sides and corners. It may have been a
modified T3 top, since it looked to be a little smaller and more flat at
the very top. It might have sat up a little higher (couple inches) too, but
I couldn't really tell if that was an optical illusion.

It was a very interesting sight. Would have liked to have the chance to
look closer or talk to the owner about it. Situation didn't agree and it
was behind a chain-link/barbed wire fence anyway...probably long-term
parking.
