Subject: Re: Help my brakes on '67

When you adjusted them, did you adjust both the top and bottom adjusters?  
Sorry, but I had to ask.  I didn't do that once and had similar problems (plus 
my e-brake didn't work.)  Oh!  That's a good question.  How well does your 
e-brake work?  That should tell you how well your rear brakes are adjusted. 

If the e-brake works well, but your pedal doesn't, first I'd bleed it 
thouroughly.  Check to make sure that the fluid isn't clogged up.  You may need 
a new hose from the rear tube to the wheel.  Those are designed to clog up 
before gunk gets into the wheel cylinder itself (at least I heard or read that 
somewhere.)  So first, bleed, if not fixed, replace hose, if still not fixed, 
replace wheel cylinder.

p.s. you said that the wheel cylinder &quot;exploded&quot; and you don't already have a 
new one?  Did you just put it back together?  I think the cylinders are $12 or 
$15 each, yet certainly worth their weight in gold in most driving situations!




Friends...

Here's the situation.  I recently had a rear wheel cylinder blow out while
coming to a hard stop in my '67 Microbus.  (Needless to say, I did _NOT_
stop, and narrowly escaped death.)  

I redid the brakes myself (Hmmm.), and they were working great.  I adjusted
them so that you needed only to press down an inch or so on the brake pedal.

Over the last 3 weeks, they have gone soft again, now the pedal nearly hits
the floor before it really starts to stop you.  Usually I would need to pump
the brakes at least once to get some pressure.

Last night I jacked the thing up and adjusted them again.  They were already
very close to rubbing slightly.  I adjusted them so that they touch the drum
slightly (as a local mechanic suggested).  

They are now working better.  But for how long???

Questions:

1) I don't want to adjust them every 3 weeks.  What can I do?

2) My brake pedal has 2&quot; play before anything starts to happen.  Normal?  
I got under the bus, and notice that the piston is going into the master
cylinder a good ways, and nothing is happening.  Normal?

3) Would purchasing a new master cylinder help?

Thanks!
