Subject: air intake for crankcase on '81 2.L?

I read a Bob Hoover denunciation of the Type I engine-breathing
arrangement and it sounded like he was saying that they straightened
things out on the Type 4.  Well, I have to admit I haven't gone out
there to stare at the pieces (and the darn crankshaft and case
are STILL (!_at_#$$#_at_) at the machine shop), but I can't figure out where
air comes into the engine casing.  I remember an air tube going into
the left-side cowling, but can't figure out where it went from there.
How's it work?
