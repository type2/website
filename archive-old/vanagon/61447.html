Subject: Transmission Oil Change
Date: Sun, 15 Jun 1997 22:21:11 -0500

I just tried changing the oil in my transmission (4 speed manual =
(091/1)) and I cannot get to the drain or filler plugs.  I have a 17mm =
Allan wrench, but it won't clear the front crossover pipe on the drain =
and the shift linkage on the filler.  Please don't tell me I have to =
take the exhaust system apart to change the transmission oil.  The Allan =
wrench is a Craftsman that says it is specifically for Volkswagens, it =
is a standard &quot;L&quot; shaped one.  BTW, how often should the transmission =
oil be changed?
