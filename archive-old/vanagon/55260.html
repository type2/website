Subject: What next? ... GREMLINS STILL OCCUPY 80 CA VANAGON

         My little problem continues... My van still shuts off after a
short time, usually less than 45 mins. It shuts off like I've turned the
key off-no misfires, sputters nothing it just shuts down, the alternator
lights doesn't even come on till the van comes to a complete stop.
        I've replaced most of the ignition components too many to list.
recently I finally replaced the fuel filter and it ran great (as usuall)
but after 45 miles it shut down again. BTW the filter was really clogged,
Ithink I'll replace it again. As always it started up after 1 hour
intermission.
        This weekend I'm going to remove the distributor and take a look at
the hall control unit wire that reside in the black plastic elbow and check
them out. I'm running out of ideas. since I've taken it to two vw shops(one
being the dealer! _at_#$%^%$##_at__at_!) and have gotten very different diagnosis.
        Are there any ideas ie. additional ground wires? exorcism etc.
All and any are appreciated.
