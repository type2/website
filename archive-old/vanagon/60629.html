Subject: FS - Rear mud flaps

     All-
     
     I thought it only fair to let everybody know:
     
     I'm selling a pair of Vanagon rear mud flaps.  Because of the way they 
     mount, they won't fit any of the models with the large wrap-around 
     bumper (I've got a '91 Westfalia GL).  They do require drilling two 
     holes in the side of the vehicle (just like the way the left front 
     flap that protects the Westfalia propane tank mounts), and they also 
     attach inboard to the frame rail and at the bottom edge of the body 
     (where it's rolled under).
     
     They're new, never been installed.  The lucky future owner will have 
     to come up with his or her own fasteners, as well as the &quot;gromets&quot; 
     that go in the holes drilled in the body.  It's easy to figure out 
     where they mount - my '91 already has the holes pre-located in the 
     frame rail - just line it up and drill the body holes.
     
     In case you're unaware, the flaps are entirely black with the raised 
     VW logo.
     
     I don't have a set price in mind - I understand that the dealer price 
     is outrageous - I paid less than list for the three (remember, I 
     installed the right front), but it was still a chunk o' change.
     
     Would a fair way be to have an e-mail auction?  Please respond 
     off-list to &lt;&lt;blaineoftrains_at_earthling_dot_net&gt;&gt;
     
     BTW, for all who asked, I rechecked the store where I got the set - it 
     was the only one they had.
