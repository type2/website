Subject: 1600 used as lawn ornament...


I purchased an engine yesterday from a gentleman who looked me in the eyes
and told me that it had been pulled only because it smoked. Six months ago.
No rod noise. No knocks, really! At a hundred dollars, I deferred.

Having got the tin and heads and cylinders off, I can tell that this engine
has sat out for some time. A *long* time.

I'll do the rings, but I don't intend to crack the case until I try it out.
The question is:

What do you do about oil that has congealed into a gelatinous mass inside
the crankcase?

Run it, heat it up, and drain it?

Try squirting solvent into the top and out the bottom?

If I run it, I have to break in the rings at the same time I'm trying to
wash this crap out of the case. Any suggestions appreciated.
