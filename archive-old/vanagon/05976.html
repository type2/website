Subject: `66 electrical problem-solved, funkengroovin, other list?

Thanks to all who responded to my mysterious electrical problem (Joel.)
I was reading this list, or mabey vintagvw, when someone posted
their generator problem, where the solution was a broken wire on
one of the terminals. Guess what? There must be a lot of that going
around! (As soon as I put the meter on the terminal, apparently enough
contact was made to give me a reading. Somehow.) I took the generator
out, replaced the wire, and now I can be happy again! Now, all I need 
is new rubber, and I won't get soaked when it's raining. (Dismally
often, here in WA.)

I received the first issue of funkengrooving yesterday, and I like
it! It also has an article in it from Ric! (About his trip to Wolfsburg.)
and other stuff that was also pretty good.
 Is the vanagon list they have the same as this one? 
List: 
vanagon-list%cherise_at_wb3ffv.ampr_dot_org
listserv:
mail-server%cherise_at_wb3ffv.ampr_dot_org?
It wouldn't seem so...
If it is a different one, it wouldn't be as colorful as this one, anyways.
:)
