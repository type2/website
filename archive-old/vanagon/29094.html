&gt;For many years, I used an after market prop on the struts (mentioned 
&gt;elsewhere at about $5 each).  This worked fine even though many folks shut 
&gt;the hatch without knowing about the modification.  These things are 
&gt;designed to temporarily deform under stress and pop away from the strut.

I use these too.  I've mentioned them before.  Available at J.C. Whitney and
also Walmart.  I installed mine so that when the struts work properly the
hatch doesn't open far enough for the lever to engage.  When I want to deploy
the lever, I just push up a little more on the hatch and it snaps into place.
