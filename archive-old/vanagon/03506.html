&gt; and while we are talking about fuel caps, do you vanagon volks know that you
&gt; can order a locking gas cap (for the early models who didn't have one)?
&gt; don't know what they cost nowadays, and you might have to keep another key
&gt; on the keyring, but ...
&gt; 

Does everyone know that the ignition key unlocks the gas cap?  I had been
using the gas cap key just like the previous owner of my '84 Vanagon had
instructed until my father told me that the ignition key unlocked it.  He
found out quite by accident, having taken the van to gas up not knowing
about the gas cap key that is kept in the ash tray.
