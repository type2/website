&gt; Hi,
&gt; 	Having just bought Jeff Schneiter's bus, I am faced with the problem
&gt; of getting a bus with no engine from thr Bay area to San Diego (about
&gt; 500 miles).  Unless I can send it UPS :)  I think the only option is to
&gt; tow it.  The problem is how.
&gt; 
&gt; Am I insane?  I wouldn't be in a hurry, and I don't care
&gt; about going fast.  Am I crazy?  Nuts?  Please tell me I'm not...

Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
No.

;)

Now do yourself a big favor and find a (would-be) friend with a good strong
pick-up that has a towing hitch.  Then proceed to fenagle, bribe, cajole,
beg them into doing this towing job for you.  You decide the negotiate
price.  Remember, returned favors are still quite valuable these days.

P.S. I don't own a pick-up. ;)
