Subject: What is VW Karma?

When I bought my '86 Vanagon GL, it had little star stickers on the center of
the wheel covers.  One day I peeled one off - to my horror I discovered an
embossed (gasp) Chevrolet bow tie logo.  Thinking quickly, and with no regard
to my own safety, I pulled the other wheel covers off and rammed them into the
trash can.

 My wife, watching from the window, commented: &quot;Now it looks like hell.  Why
did you do that?&quot;

 &quot;Karma,&quot; I replied, &quot;bad karma to leave a situation like that to fester. 
Volkswagen vehicle requires Volkswagen wheel covers to insure safe operation.&quot;
Wife stared at me for a long time, finally said nothing and closed the window.

 It took about two weeks to find original wheel covers and now all is well.

 But to my question.  What is Karma?  I've tossed that phrase off over the
years without really knowing what it means.  How does one maintain good Karma?
How does one eliminate bad Karma?  Is Karma like Luck?  Is Karma like a bank
account? Can you build up good Karma by helping old ladies across the street
and use it later when driving home after a few beers?

 More specifically, what is VW Karma?
