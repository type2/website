Subject: re: Argh! My transmission went kaput!


Hopefully this is the last status report on the big transmission repair I 
stared about a month ago. It's in and running! This was quite a team 
effort. I have to give much thanks to the mailing list and friends who 
provided advice and special tools. 

Special tools needed:

Socket to remove differential bearing
Socket to remove pinion lock ring
Hydraulic press
Selection of circlip removers

Surprises:

None really, except for the broken plastic bleeder/hose junction. I think 
this is only a concern for '83.5-'85 wasserboxer owners. When the engine 
was lowered to remove the transmission, the small bleeder hose pulled 
against the plastic junction that is mounted to the body. It will snap off 
without hesitation. This is a $44 part, so beware!

Lessons learned:

Now I know why mechanics charge so much for this repair. But hey, I'm one 
of the demented ones that loves to get greasy!

Special considerations:

I probably would not have done this if I had one of the older 
transmissions used in the air cooled Vanagon. They have adjustable forks 
that require a special fixture to work on. Thankfully the wasserboxer 
transmission is a really neat design, no special fixture needed.

Now that I'm an expert;) I'd be happy to give any advice!

Steve

P.S. You may want to wait on the advice part and make sure mine doesn't 
machine itself to death in the next couple hundred miles.
