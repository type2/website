Subject: Spokane area list members??

Vanatics,
This Christmas season brings me to Spokane Washington.  Are there any 
nearby (Spokane, Post Falls, Coeur d'Alene???) listmembers that might 
enjoy a short visit and a little Vanagon comparison?

Let me know at Syncrohead_at_aol_dot_com

Jim Davis,
87 GL Syncro (with me in Spokane)
88 GL Wolfsburg (missing us at home)
