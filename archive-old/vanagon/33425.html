&gt; all season radials.  At the same time I moved the almost new Continentals to
&gt; the back. 40 K later the Motomaster tires on the front look like new

&gt; Take home message: Continental Tires don't last:

40,000 miles is not too bad as tires go but I don't know what continentals 
you have. If you had rotated the tires properly at 20,00 miles you would 
still have 20,00 to go on both sets.  The rear tires being the drive 
tires will wear much faster than  the front tires.  This is always the
case.  I think you need to re-think this and look at it again.
