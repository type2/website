Subject: re: bum cv

hey now,

don't forget the liquid wrench, the hand cleaner, and some really old clothes.
soak the bolts the night before you do the cv joint change with liquid wrench.
wear the old clothes cuz changing cv joints is prolly the messiest job you can
do with a cv vw...my muir manual testifies to this. and your clothes..well,
i wore a semi new shirt which is now a work shirt. :P

also, get a ziploc bag and put the bolts, bearings, etc and mark from what cv
joint you took them out of. lose a bolt and you could spend awhile looking
around at FLAPS or ordering them like i had to do. also, mark the transaxles
before you take them off with tape or something...Drivers left outer, inner,
passenger inner, outer.

be prepared for a messy, some what time consuming, frustrating but totally
doable experince that will make you proud once you get them done..
