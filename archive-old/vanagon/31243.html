Greetings busaholics-

I replaced the front shoes on my '69. Adjusted them to perfection, I've
done this many times before. No leaky wheel cylinder, nice looking drums, I
was cleaner than usual. Now, I've got a horrible squeel in the right front,
and it pulls the same direction when I brake!!! I took the drum back off,
cleaned it out with brake clean, scuffed the shoes with 220 grit, put it
all back together, adjust....same trip!! What am I missing here? The pedal
is solid, and I can't find ANY fluid leaking. Also, I bled the whole
system.
