&gt; &gt; For those who need a &quot;pattern&quot; - I ran across the measurements sheet I had
&gt; &gt; made for a set that I made back in '88 for my 1981 Westy the other day. If
&gt; &gt; anyone is interested, I can post the measurements and some notes about how
&gt; &gt; I went about making them.

&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I know the last few weeks I've heard a few people who didn't have 
&gt; &gt; &gt; curtains in their vans, and were looking for them.  Currenly the set I 
&gt; &gt; &gt; have is (I think) from the company who is currently selling them.  Since 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I have aluminum bars for the curtains to slide on, which I doubt is an 
&gt; &gt; &gt; origional westy design.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Anyway, if you have access to a sewing machine then I would highly 
&gt; &gt; &gt; recomend making them yourself.  The set that were with my van when I 
&gt; &gt; &gt; bought it are falling apart and sheding a brown dust, so my girlfriend 
&gt; &gt; &gt; offered to make me new ones.  
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I just when and picked out the fabric, making sure it kept the right 
&gt; &gt; &gt; about of light out.  Then we used the old curtains for a pattern, leaving 
&gt; &gt; &gt; a few inches to hem over.  
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; They're not all done yet, but they look sooooo good.  I'm really happy 
&gt; &gt; &gt; with them.  If you have NO curtains to use as a patern then I would 
&gt; &gt; &gt; suggest just measuring the windows.  Mine hang freely at the bottom, so 
&gt; &gt; &gt; the length didn't have to be perfect.  
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; You could always talk your grandmother into making them.  She'd probably 
&gt; &gt; &gt; have fun at it.
