This is tangentially VW-releated, since I can't progress on the barndoor until
I get this solved.

I started the wiring for my new compressor today.  Its a 220v, single phase,
5hp motor.  I installed a junction box, conduit and outlet no problem.  

I now have to connect the cord to the compressor, which has this box the wires
go into.

I'm stymied because I don't know which wires go where...

Diagram:

      ()       ()
      L1       L2

               ()
      ()       T2

The wires on the left (2 red ones) go to the switch for the compressor, the wires
on the right (2 black ones) go to the motor.  Each () is a place where a wire
can connect (screw terminal)

Any ideas?

BTW - I have a Brand New, in the box (NOS!) Air Compresor, 3.5 horse, 30gal 110v, 
comes with hose and some fittings.  I took my old one back under warranty and
got a new one.  You also get the 2 year warranty on this one.  I paid $300
for it, I'll sell it for $250/offer.  Shipping would probably be a problem - it
weighs quite a bit.  BTW - its a devilbiss oilless.
