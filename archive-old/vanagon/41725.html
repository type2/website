&gt;     Hello Eurovan Drivers:
&gt;     
&gt;     I have been considering trading my 1986 Vanagon GL for a 1993 Eurovan 
&gt;     and while doing some research via the Internet, came across an unhappy 
&gt;     Eurovan owner. Among other things, this individual states that as a 
&gt;     result of the catalytic converter being beneath the passenger 
&gt;     compartment, it heats the interior of the vehicle, which requires 
&gt;     running the air conditioner constantly.
&gt;     
&gt;     Has this been your experience?
&gt;     
&gt;     Thanks for your help,
&gt;

Let me guess.  The guy's name is something like R. Knox.  If so he's on a
real rampage against VW for percieved &quot;wrongs&quot; that VW &amp; dealers have done
him.  He'll blow the slightest thing way out of proportion.  He'll even
expound on subjects that have no basis in fact.  Also, he loves to quote an
&quot;Advertising Age&quot; (the world's automotive authority??) article from 3 years
or so ago that details VW's lack of US sales.  I think that half this guy's
life is dedicated to attacking VW.

Somehow I doubt that EV owners all over the world are continuously running
their A/C.
