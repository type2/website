Subject:      Re: Which Subaru engine?

I called a few wrecking yards and found that Subaru engines complete
w/all the stuff Kennedy needs (wiring harness, etc.) is running between
$1,100 and $1,500.  Seems that, out here anyway, the Subaru 2.2 is the
ultralight airplane engine of choice, which has resulted in bidding up
the price I guess.

Also, regarding the turbo charged Subaru's and really, anything but the
2.2L, most the people I talked to warned me to stay away from them noting
that they burn out fast and parts are very hard to get and expensive.

&gt; Which Subaru engine(s) is(are) a suitable replacement for the 1.9l VW?
&gt; I saw an ad for a Subaru 1800 4WD asking just GB#50 that 50 pounds for the
&gt; engine. Should I buy this as an insurance policy?
