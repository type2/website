Subject: Fri-yi-yi-day!!!

The great history of the men and women who drove the plains, deserts
and mountains in their rattletrap VW vans, their homes on their backs, so
to speak, like great Western Tortoises, is captured and retold in the
legacy of music that they have left behind....

This is the authentic Volkswagen Herder's song, as sung by the lonesome
VW herders who drove the great expanses of the American West.  This
particular verse was collected by collector, historian and
Volksinger Will Self:

Whoopie ki yi ay,
get along little aircooleds,
for you know that Montana
will be your new home.

And here is another classic of the West, diligently collected by Mr. Self:

I drive an old brick, I tow an old van
I'm goin' to Montana for to oil up my pan;
They're greasy in the CVs, they're hot in the exhaust,
Their panels are rusty, their hub caps are lost.

Drive around, little Fow Vays, drive around so slow,
For the overheated pancakes are rarin' to go.
