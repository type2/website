Subject: Re: kombi on fire

I know a lot of people have mentioned that the metal fuel pipe that goes 
through the cooling tin often wears thru without its rubber gasket.  Well 
another spot is the little hose section on fuel injectors.  My uncle had 
one crack and spit gas all over the engine in his 76.  when he got to where 
he was going he smelled it and went to check.  he opened the engine 
compartment this white fog rolled out, and he very carefully and swiftly 
got away, no fire though.  Just thought I'd add the the possible hazard 
points of the fuel system.
