Subject: Of wipers, windshields, and gas-station attendents...


 &quot;....Then, while running the wipers to check them out, the
driver's side wiper fell of, leaving the end of the arm (bare metal)
to scratch a nice (not!) semi-circle across the windshield before I
could shut it off.....&quot;

---I almost did this on my very own, without help.

Also on the subject of windshields, what can I do to eliminate/minimize
fogged windows?  Does Rain-X work inside as well?  Do those anti-fog
cloths really work?  Anyone?

&lt;---- End Included Message ----&gt;
I find that fogging in my '73 is mostly related to internal moisture, I just 
keep a spare diaper in front to wipe the inside glass off.  On dry days I 
leave the sunroof open a crack.
Has anyone tried a product called Clean-Sweep?  Its two clear strips of 
plastic with little bumps imbedded in it.  They glue onto the windshield right 
above where the wiper rest.  The result is the wipers get cleaned on each 
swipe.  I got a sample from the developer a couple of years ago, and have had 
pretty good luck with them, they eliminate the usual streaking from dirt and 
such.  (Do not use with brand new wiper blades, creates this ugly gray smear 
as they take off the initial coating)  I was just wondering whether they made 
it to the marketplace or not.
P.S. I don't know what it would cost, And I have no economic, emotional, 
spiritual, physical, or any other connection with this company, but, I have 
the developers card if anyone wants it.
