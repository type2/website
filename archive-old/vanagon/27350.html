Subject: Help! 84 Westy stumbles

My 1984 Westfalia is very unhappy. 

I have a problem where the bus will stumble off the line and possess
a lumpy idle.  This problem exists 5% of the time, otherwise it's
o.k.  This problem tends to occur mostly when I have been sitting in
stop and go traffic.  The bus will accelerate really really slowly
until I get to about 10 mph then it seems fine....

The problem goes away if I disconnect the oxygen sensor from the
engine brain.  I have replaced the sensor but the problem still
exists.  I need to have the sensor hooked up to pass emission testing
so if anyone knows what's going on I would appreciate assistance. 

Thanks in advance.
