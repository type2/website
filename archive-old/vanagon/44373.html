Subject: cheap electro magnetic

Ian wrote sayinig

&gt;I'm having trouble finding a relatively cheap electro magnetic cut off
&gt;valve (central idle system; Haynes page 54, item 60) for the Solex PDSIT
&gt;34 2/3 carburettor.

&gt;Does anyone have any suggestions?

&gt;I would also like to get hold of two idle mixture enrichment (Haynes
&gt;page 54, item 61) although this is not as crucial as the above part.

&gt;I live in Sweden, however the part here at VW is over =A3100!?!?

&gt;Best,

Ian
        I think I have the part you're looking for. If this is the same
part as fits on the Solex 30 PICT 3, then I've got an extra one laying
about, so if it fits you're welcome to it for the cost of the postage
stamp.
        Were in Sweden are you?
        I'll be in Helsingborg next week, and If the part fits I'll bring
it along, otherwise in two weeks were heading up to the Norwegian border to
a VW graensetraef in Skjeberg (ved Stromstad), and then over to Gotland for
a week. We're taking the '61 fresh from the painter. He hopes to be
finished a week Monday.
        As to the idle mixture, are you referring to the screw. Have you
tried calling Thomas at Custom Speed in Hyllinge. If its a part of the
rebuild kit, they list it in their catalogue for 198 SEK. The number is 042
22 59 40.
