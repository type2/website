Well, I said I'd post a summary of my impromptu survey.  I was really
interested in finding out how many buses have sunroofs, and how many
buses have brown interiors.  I got two responses.  Hopefully, that's
because the only people who responded were people with sunroofs AND
brown interiors in the model years 77 - 79, and not because people
hate surveys in general.

Both respondents have 78 models.  I also have a parts van that's a 77
with sunroof and brown interior (which explains why I'm looking so
narrowly for a drivable bus with those features).  The 77 isn't
reported in Joel's stats, so I'll add it in for my totals.  I'm using
the stats from 11 Jan 96 in Digest #770, which are the most recent I
found:

      3 sunroofs out of 546 buses is roughly 1/2 of 1%.

      3 sunroofs out of 49 buses years 77-79 is 6%.

What's the opinion out there--anyone have any idea what fraction of
all buses were outfitted with a sunroof?  More than 1/2%?  More than
6%?

Since sunroofs aren't reported in Joels stats, if anyone wants to send
me a quick note, I'll keep the tally going and see if I can get a
better total from our little sample space of 500+ vehicles.
