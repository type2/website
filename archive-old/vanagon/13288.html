We're going over to the Bad Camberg Veteranentreffen this June, so assuming 
that I can get a reliable pricing on them via our contact in Dauborn (about 20 
Km west of Oettinger) AND people PREPAY their orders, I may be able to pick up 
a couple of sets (just don't tell my wife about it)...

 This was
&gt; especially puzzling to me because only a couple weeks ago, I saw a white
&gt; Syncro Westy with german plates under the California ones that had a radiator
&gt; grill that ran the full width between the turn signals and had fog/driving
&gt; lights built into it. Are these different grills aftermarket items? 

I happen to have this setup. It involves Oettinger Fogg lamps which are
placed between the turn signals and the lower grill. Then, there is a
plastic thing that goes around the fogg lamps and the turn signal lenzes and
connects to the lower grill. It makes it look like the lower grill extends
all the way to the sides of the vehicle unless you look close. You can still
buy these and I tried to help other Vanagon owners get some out of Germany a
few months back but nobody was interested.
