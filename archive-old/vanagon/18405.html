So Martha Rubin says:
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, definitely - especially bring:
&gt; 
&gt; firewood
&gt; propane
&gt; folding chairs
&gt; beer  :)
&gt; ice

Martha,

You were concerned about getting a BBQ setup going.  I have one of
those small portable grills.  Do you want me to bring that?  I'm
NOT volunteering to do ALL the BBQing on it.  I think since everyone
is bringing their own meat (so to speak ;) ) that they can easily
cook their own so they can have it done to their own taste.  I
hope this is agreeable to everyone?
