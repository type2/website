Subject: checking propane levels..


Isn't there an easier way than to affix this strip to the outside
of the propane tank, and then have to pour water on it?  Doesn't
someone make a gauge, preferably one that can be mounted 
on the inside of the car, so that one can tell while driving
if one needs to stop for propane?
