Subject: Re: vanagon engine lid

&gt; for the lighter palstic lid on my '82 'GTi' camper.  I also thought the
&gt; insulation on the plastic lid looked better that the metal one. The
&gt; metal lid's had fluffy stuffing like stuff and the Plastic lid is foam. 
&gt; I'm looking for more input on this subject.  Thanks. Take care.
&gt; -- 

I agree, swapped the '85 plastic lid into the louder '81 as the '81 
is a camper and the '85 lid is MUCH better at noise supression plus 
so much lighter it's simply amazing when you want to haul it out of 
there.  As to longetivity, hell how much weight to you put on that 
extreme rear portion when sleeping anyway, I don't imagine any 
problems.
