Subject: need camping world address


I posted something in the last few days to the list about the cabinet lights
I installed in my '81 westy.  They were from Camping World, and one of our
list memebers in Switzerland, Darie Duclos (darie_at_hasler.ascom.ch) would like
the address, and their 800 number is not reachable from out of the country.  I
thought I could lay my hands on the address, but wasn't able to find it today.


Does anyone have their address handy?  I guess it should be the catalog ordering
address, so that a catalog can be requested.

TIA,

/martha
