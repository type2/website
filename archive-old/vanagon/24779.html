Subject: solenoid blues

The discussion about fixing the hot start problem related to a
failing/overheated solenoid led me to think about more preventive measures.

Since the main problem seems to excessive heat build why not take measures
to cool that area? Not as complicated as it sounds. On the underside of my
vanagon snaking up to the starter is a flexible clothes dryer duct. You
know the kind you find in hardware stores that look like large white
slinkies? These were designed to allow the heat from a clothes dryer to be
vented to the outside; they also make great cooling devices. I use them on
both sides to force cool air up towards the secondary oil cooler (above
the tranny) when the van is in motion. This
demands less of the fan but it also (I'm surmising here) keeps the whole
starter area cool while at speed. If you think this looks silly, the only
noticeable part (and you have to look for it) is where the opening emerges
just in front of the suspension. It DID look very odd when I had large air
scoops  attached to both openings, but I found these were not needed.

For those not electrically inclined or with only five dollars in their
pocket, four feet of duct may be the answer in solving their hot start
problems.
