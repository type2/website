&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I've just finished going over the van &quot;repairing&quot; superficial rust spots,
&gt; (you know, the little dings on the edges of doors, esp. the leading
&gt; edge of the sliding door), with a product from &quot;plasti-Cote&quot;.
&gt; 
&gt; I can't remember the trade name, but it is a milky-white, almost latex
&gt; looking liquid which you paint onto the affected area (after removing any
&gt; loose rust, but not sanding down to bare metal), and as it dries, it turns
&gt; the rust a black colour and leaves a slightly amber plastic coating. I did
&gt; it purely as a stop-gap remedy until I can do the proper touch-up paint
&gt; routine. The resulting coating seems, so far, to be quite tough.

Permatex makes a product called Extend which neutralizes the rust with a 
tough but inert laler. This basically keeps air out preventing the rust 
from  &quot;breathing.&quot;
I just finished doing a repair on the body seam that runs Horizontal on 
the driver's side below the hookups. I sealed the rusted area with Extend 
from the inside after removing the sink\stove\fridge. The water was 
leaking in through the two vertical body seams that are on the driver's 
side also. The putty cracked from age, so I went to Builders Square and 
got some Dap window and siding putty. It is siliconed based and can be 
painted to match after it cures. It solved my problem.
