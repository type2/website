&gt;
&gt; nope. those jail bars were an optional accessory. and you can/could order
&gt; them afterward and install them. they supposedly prevent luggage from banging
&gt; into the glass. i've seen them on buses as far back as 1967.
&gt;
&gt; oh, and there is a set for the rearmost side windows as well.
As an official representative of the split window population here in
waterworld, I must say that the jail bars appeared on the Deluxe busses in the
50's. Good thing I know all this wonderful stuff, eh?  Actually, there's a blue
Vanagon on my street with jail bars. Pretty crazy, I just noticed the jail bars
yesterday, and was thinking how curious it was. Now, here's this discussion to
set me at ease. Thanks, V_at_L !

Happy Friday
