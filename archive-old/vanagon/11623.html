I have been using LPS for many years now.  It has a very interesting 
ability to climb up inside the doors of old vehicles.  You spray it into 
the doors like rustproofing and a few days later it will appear up near 
the top.  I like it because it is only about $25.00 per gallon in Canada, 
and it replaces WD40 in my shop at a much lower cost.  I buy it from 
machine shop supply houses up here in Manitoba.  It comes in a Blue 
plastic jug. The jug says general purpose lub, penetrating, water 
replacing.  It protects up to 1 year.  It is made by Holt Lloyd Corp of 
Tucker Georgia 30084.  It was worth reading the label.  In 15 years, I 
never noticed you were to shake well before applying.  I guess the bottom 
half of the product I have out there is going to do a real great job!  
For the most part it is WD40 and is used exactly the same way.  If you 
figure out the cost of the spray tins vs the gallon of LPS, you will 
always buy LPS as I do and use a hairspray bottle to apply it to nusts 
and bolts etc.  I hope this helps.  Dave VE4PN
