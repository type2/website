&gt;Yesterday I attempted to push my frozen brake pistons back into their homes

&gt;jack and the bus to force the pistons back into their respective caliper
&gt;halves.

&gt;Ok, enough fun.  The real question is:  should I even attempt to reuse these
&gt;things or would I just be tempting fate?  The rubber boots around the
&gt;pistons weren't cracked   Of course, now that I just crushed them
&gt;under my bus and beat the shit out of them with a hammer I'm a little
&gt;concerned about safety! ;)

I guess I'm getting conservative in my old age ;) but what's the cost of a
few more parts compared to not being able to stop surely and quickly (or at
all?)  I'd replace.  Definately replace.
