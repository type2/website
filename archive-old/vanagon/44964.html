Subject: 1991 Vanagon Engine Replacement

Looking for information on &quot;best&quot; way to locate complete high 
performance engine to put into my vanagon.  Everything is factory today. 
 Is the porche engine kit trom MSDS the only/best way to go?  Is there a 
high perf 4 cyl/5speed out there the is not so invasive an approach?

Present mileage is 83K with no sign of any problems but want to get 
solutions before engine gives out as I understand most folks get 100K at 
best on these engines.  P.S. I will sell if any interested parties!  Van 
is in exceptional mint condition.
