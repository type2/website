Subject: Questions on tires

Hello=20



I have some questions.


1.- I could change the tires 185/ 70/ 14 C for 205/ 70/ 14 without
changing  of tires 14&quot;x5,5J=20


2.- it is possible lower a little the suspension, changing of jetties
and shocks (which they would recommend me) (Koni, Bilstein)



	I have seen [German] of accessories of camping site an accessory in a
magazine in order to rotate the front seats 360=BA and their approximate
cost is of 190 DM. c/u  if somebody interested  I send the address.
