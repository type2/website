Subject: Another cup holder

Fellow cup holder nuts,

Knowing that the number of cupholders you have in your Vanagon is the true
measure of a man, my 5 year old son and I added another this weekend.  At the
five &amp; dime I bought the largest clip-into-the-window-track cup holder I
could find, then trimmed off the clip and screwed it onto the righthand
outside edge of the instrument cluster cover using genuine VW screws removed
from an old splitty.  (I bought a new cover at a salvage yard and saved the
old cover &quot;just in case&quot;)

Works great!  No more fighting between the passenger and the driver over who
get to use the holder in the walkway between the seats.  It dosen't interfear
with the window crank like the clip-into-the-window-track style does, and it
doesn't reduce access to the ash tray/change box.
