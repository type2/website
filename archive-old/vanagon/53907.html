Subject: Vanagon high-roof sighting
Date: Tue, 7 Jan 1997 23:01:32 -0500

Hey all,
Today while driving by the local VW dealer I saw a Vanagon sitting in the
lot apparently awaiting servicing.  Why anyone would take it to the dealer
is beyond me, but that's another story :) .  This Vanagon was an air-cooled
model and had a non-Westfalia camper coversion.  It had a white fiberglas
roof similar to the roof on David Schwarze's Safare camper, with the
sliding windows on the sides of the high-roof.  The camper was beige and
the roof was white, looked like it added a couple feet to the van.  Anyone
know what company made this type of conversion for Vanagons?  Could it have
been a Safare?  

I've not seen this one around town before, thought it was kinda interesting
:)

Sean
