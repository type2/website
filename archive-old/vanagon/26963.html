Subject: '5? Barndoor UPDATE

Hi everyone,
      I still havn't taken the 10 hour trip to pick up my new bus.  Maby next
week.  
      The guy I'm buying it from did find the VIN number:  20-029 105  
Can anyone tell me anything about my bus by this number?  Could it be a late
'51?     
                                                 Later,
                                                        Eric
