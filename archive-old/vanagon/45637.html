Subject: 

Howdy Listers, As I am relatively new to the 'Vanagon experience', I have a
question for those well seasoned vanagon drivers, or anyone with an informed
opinion. My Vanagon (91 GL) rides extremely 'hard' over bumpy pavement,
railroad tracks, etc. It feels and sounds as though there is almost no
absorption of the bumps. Is this the nature of the beast, or can I expect
better? I should note that it handles wonderfully. TIA.

Pat
