Subject:      the muir solonoid trick ... numbers explained

boy, you guys ... ok, i got out my handy dandy bosch book (again!?) and this
is what it says:

30 - input from battery + terminal, direct
85 - ground
86 - start of winding (positive?)
87 - input (relay contact for break and changeover contacts)

ok, ok ... so that doesn't help much. how bout this. from a Cibie set of
instructions:

30 - to battery + terminal (through fuse)
85 - to ground
86 - to the thing what is gonna signal the relay to kick on (ignition switch
     in this case ... the starting voltage)
87 - to the thing what is gonna RECEIVE the voltage from the battery (the
     solonoid in this case)

so i think you need to swap your 86 and 87 on your original connections,
but make sure that 86 is connected to the ignition wire that carries 12v
ONLY when the key is in the START position (otherwise, wouldn't the solonoid
continue to engage?).

hope it helps.
joel
