Subject: Opinions on Auto Trans Vanagons?

     My neighbor's family is growing larger than his Volvo station
     wagon. He doesn't want to be caught dead in a minivan. He likes
     the layout of my GL, but its not FS.

     So he's wondering if the auto trans wasserboxers are OK. Any
     difference in reliablity?

     Thanks

     Tom F.
