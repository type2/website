Subject: stearing box parts and ideas

has anybody out there rebuilt a split stearing box befor?  i just pulled 
one apart and would like to replace the bearings.  they are not like 
normal sealed units.  are they avalable from local supply houses?  also 
there is a seal for the cross shaft.  any ideas on where to get one?  
lastly, i am going to weld a stearing lock coller to it so i can mount a 
stearing lock unit in my bus.  does any one know what the orig. ones 
looked like?  are they the same as the coolars on late madle bus's?  any 
info would be apreciated.
thanks and God BLess
matt
