Subject: Re: VW Classic Report (will be later this week)

I plan on making a full report as seen from my persective a little later on
in the week.
The bottom line is that it was a great weekend and am glad that I decided
not to skip it. Each year the SOTO/Classic Weekend seems to be very much the
same and yet different due to my current needs, interests, and level of
experience.
I arrived back home home in Phoenix 4AM Monday 6/10/96 in a unstressed but
exhausted state. I took Monday off to rest and recover. Just a few hours
into the work routine on Tuesday and I find myself getting re-stressed and
under the gun. The full report will come as soon as I crawl out of the
workload/corporate meeting alligator pit.

BTW: Got a call from &quot;Matty J.&quot; yesterday and was unable to hookup with his
traveling circus. They are taking off for Bryce Canyon and the North Rim of
the Grand Canyon for five days. We are tentatively slated to hookup for a
brew and nosh upon their return through Phoenix.

I GOTTA RUN!
