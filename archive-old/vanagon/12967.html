Subject: Re: bus generations

&gt;Jon Peters went on about the barndoors again, so i say:
&gt;
&gt;ok. barndoors are a separate &quot;generation&quot;. then so are Syncros. they have
&gt;more physical differences from other 2wd Vanagons than Barndoors have from
&gt;later Microbuses. and Syncros drive very different (especially in the dirt!).
&gt;
&gt;so now we've increased the confusion to what ... 6 &quot;generations&quot;??
&gt;

Synchros definitely drive differently.  I had an 87.  It was a really great 
van, but had to get rid of it for the Passat.
