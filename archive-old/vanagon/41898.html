Subject: WTB 1.9 Wasserboxer Engine

I realize this may be futile, crazy request, but anyone know of a good
running Wasserboxer 1.9 engine for sale?  I am now the proud owner of a 1984
Westfalia in absolutely fantastic condition except for one minor flaw -
there's a hole in the top of the case about the size of your fist.  Now I'm
all for Positive Crankcase Ventilation, but methinks this may be going just a
tad bit too far :).  Every thing else in the engine compartment is accounted
for and in good shape, so just a good running longblock is needed. It's also
an Automatic but I'm daft enough to try anything once.

Keep on flamin' :)     Oh Yeah, paid a thousand clams for it (o boy am I
gonna get roasted on this one!).
