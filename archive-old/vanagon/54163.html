 perhaps more realistic alternatives.

With regards your posting, number

&quot;4/Used '90 or '91 Vanagon Westy around US$10k&quot;

I have spent the last two months looking for a '91 Westy and have not found
anything decent for US$10k

I have found 2 Westies in the $22K range with low miles, well maintained.
The first had 29,000 miles and sold before I could make an offer at $22,000.
The second was listed at $22,500 and I am second in line to get it with 36,000
miles. If you know where I can ger a '91 Westy with low miles in excellent
condition for $10K I would love to hear from you. I have found '89s and '87s
for $18,500 and better with 80,000 miles, rebuilt engines etc.

What kind of condition and how many miles would you '91 have at $10K?
