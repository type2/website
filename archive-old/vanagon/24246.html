Subject: Re: VW-HINTS FOR LONG BLOCK PURCHASE FOR A 71 DUAL PORT BUS

np&gt; adjustment charge, the $435 for the long block is now $620
np&gt; ($435+$150+$35). J. Serrano's in Torrance, CA told me that they
np&gt; didn't care what condition the core was in. Should have gone there
np&gt; but I really haven't heard much about the quality of their
np&gt; rebuilds.

        Well, although I'm not an expert on engines (yet...), my rebuilt
came from G Serrano's, and it's worked well so far. I put about 10k on it
in my Karmann Ghia ('70) before ditching the Ghia and putting it in the '70
Transporter. I've put on 40k since then, still runs well. Only real problem
so far is the distributor drive shaft has too much end-play, it tends to
eat distributors. Something I now know how to fix, thanks to good ol' bob
hoover. So I guess what I'm saying is : it ain't perfect but I'm still
drivin' it. Was the best price in town, so I can't really complain-ya gets
what ya pays for.

        Good tips there, nick. I'll have to remeber them when shopping for
my next case (many moons from now, I hope!).

Peace,
