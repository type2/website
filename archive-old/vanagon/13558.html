Subject: cut off jets

 &gt;Just had my van back from the shop after a tune up (82 air 
&gt; cooled,2litr,twim carb)
&gt; &gt;It seems that one of my elecromagnetic cut-off jets is not working. Muir says
&gt; &gt;they are a waste of time and can be replaced by a screw in jet.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; They were put in to prevent 'dieselling on' when the carbon crud in your 
&gt; cylinders keeps igniting the gas (thus spinning the engine) that would get 
&gt; sucked through otherwise. Put a screw in first, shouldn't affect anything, 
&gt; just use a short one with a seal/gasket/silicone goo. Then by cut-offs if 
&gt; needed. 
&gt;         Which carbs do you have on? All models in Canada since '75(?) have 
&gt; had fuel injection. Is this the 'factory equipped' setup, if so what kind of 
&gt; mileage are you getting? thanks   tim s.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
Tim,
        Fortunately this problem has sorted itself, it seems after  some 
reference to Muir, I had a look and found that the lead wasn't even attached
to the jet. I checked it out according to Muir (also thanks to Joel) and found
with the ignition on and making contact the jet was clicking away nicely, just
like in the book. So problem solved, I may have some words with the mechanic.
Anyway it was a learning experience.
        The carbs are Solex PDSIT 32-34 3 (left side) and Solex PDSIT 32-34 2
right side. Muir says these are used in 73 buses. The Haynes manual says that
all US and Canadian 2 litre engines were fuel injected. Does anybody Know if 
Bentely covers the European vanagons without fuel injection, I know the Haynes
manual covers both.
        I don't now what milage these carbs will give me, I'm checking it now.
 I did a milage check when I first got the van using the original carbs, don't
 know what they were, but eventually had to be replaced. On a trip to Germany
 last summer I was monitoring the fuel pretty carefully and over a distance of 
 over 1500 miles I was getting a consumption of  25/26mpg imperial. This was
 mainly autobahn driving but I think is pretty good. I was using leaded petrol.
 I've changed to unleaded, got another set of carbs (above) and a tune up, so 
 over Easter I'm doing the Germany trip again so I'll let you know what milage
 I get.

 Cheers
