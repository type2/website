Subject:      A/C Woes

Hey ya'll,

I recently purchased a '90 Westy, and seem to be having some trouble with
the A/C. It rarely seems to cool the entire vehicle. Last weekend on our
Oregon excursion I pumped the A/C on high (outside temp was in high 80's)
and it seemed to work fine. Of course when I ran it in the evening it
worked even better (outside temp in the 70's). On the way home, though, the
A/C barely kept the inside temp below the outside temp (mid 90's). At best
I could say the blowing temp of the A/C seems to be intermittent, if not
just regular inside temp air.

Is the A/C/ unit just typically weak in these Westies? If so, is there a
way to boost it up? The coolant was recently topped off, so I don't think
the problem is that simple.

Thanks volks!

Chris
