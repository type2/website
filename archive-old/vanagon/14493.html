Subject:      Notice: Tomorrow is Friday.

awright, folks. you've been warned: Tomorrow is Friday.

now, it's Tradition to come up with something silly on fridays ... silly,
but somewhat related to buses. poems, songs, stories, jokes, whatever.

so let's get those fertile little minds working tonight and tomorrow and
get some creative imaginative stuff out there. well ... ok. how bout just
some stuff?  :)

joel
