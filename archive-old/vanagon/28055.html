Subject: Goodyear tires for Eurovans

Responding copied to the list since I think other EV owners might be 
interested.

&gt;           What do you mean by &quot;imported&quot; Goodyears? What is their name
&gt; (e.g. Invicta, Aquatred. etc.).

It is a tire imported by Goodyear from some European branch I believe.  
We got it at &quot;Just Tires&quot; which belongs to Goodyear.

195x70R15 Goodyear G64 tire - price wasn't low some discounted to $122 
through a special deal - normally $130.  This isn't one of the usual US 
names.

&gt;           As I understand it, the MV style is discontinued. No more
&gt; tables (unless one upscales to the Winnebago-designed camper).

That would be a shame.  This is the most useful van made by anyone at 
anytime (okay the T3 MV is the same great configuration).

&gt;           Thanks for the response. EV owners have to stick together. There
&gt; aren't many of us.
 We happen to live in what must be Eurovan central.  I see more EVs than 
I do splitties or baywindows.  And nearly as many as Vanagons.  All the 
colors and all the models.
