&gt;I bought the '57!!!  It is beautiful.  I was told the paint needed to be
&gt;redone, but it is acutally in good shape.  The paint job is the original
&gt;colors, Chocolate Brown on the top, and Salmon on the bottom.  It looks
&gt;fabulous!  It has the jail-bars and everything.  The roof-liner doesn't have
&gt;a single tear in it!  Wow.  And the canvas sunroof is in good shape.  It even
&gt;has a new '67 tranny with the high gear ratio!  Has all the chrome!  And
&gt;bumper guards!

Right on!  Congrats!

Good luck finding those bits, though.  Hell, I'd take one without them,
though!
