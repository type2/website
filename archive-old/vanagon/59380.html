Message: 
I'm traveling to Europe next month, looking to buy a used Westie ($10,000, 
sell it there when finished after 6 months or so) any tips on what's 
available, what to avoid, insurance costs the petrol vs. diesel vs. propane 
question? I need either an European or American who has done the same thing to 
contact me. Thanks!
