&gt; Same owner for nearly 30 years.  Want to sell to someone who will
&gt; cherish this car.
&gt; 
&gt; Needs brake and interior work.  Engine still good.
&gt; 
&gt; Call Christie _at_ 206-226-8977.
&gt; 

I just called this number and was told that this is a misprint.  NOW for 
the big question, does anyone know how to get the real number and the if 
so, are they willing to share it?  
thanks.
dave.
