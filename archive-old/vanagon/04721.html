&gt; &gt; Obviously, since you are in camping mode, you'll be taking more food and

&gt; &gt; going in the summer.  It gets pretty cold in some places.

&gt; I just wanted to second the part about how cold it can get even in the 
&gt; summer.  Yellostone got damn COLD in August at night.  I almost froze to 
&gt; death, and there was ice on my car in the morning.  Fortunately I had a 
&gt; winter coat with me.

We had snow in the lake Tahoe  area two Junes ago. The park would not let
us stay at the campsite and so we had to stay at a motel (no camper then).
The Yanks thought these Canadians jumping into Hot Tubs with a foot of
snow on the ground were crazy.....DC&gt;
