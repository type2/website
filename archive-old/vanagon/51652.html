Joel;
In my haste to get caught up with this flood of email I neglected to
mention that there  is a regular filter upstream of the large filter which I replace regularly.  The parts guy also mentioned that the large filter was probably added when my crew cab was imported from Canada to meet California emissions. The large filter has been in use for ten years
without a fuel related problem.
Good Luck

&gt;&gt;I was told at VW parts counter that the large silver filter &quot;should&quot;
&gt;&gt;never need replacing.

To which Joel responded:

&gt;yeah. that's what THEY say. but if you don't replace it, what are the
&gt;chances of an old filter letting junk out to the injectors?? i figure
&gt;what the heck ... for $40, i'll replace the thing every two years.
