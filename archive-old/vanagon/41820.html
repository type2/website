If they're chrome, then I'd say they're aftermarket. :)
I believe the stock size for your bus is 15x5.5, while the bug rims are
normally only 14x4.5.  I have what I think is a ~'67 stock bug tire as my
spare in my '66.  It does not have the mount for a moon hubcap, it's made
for the flat hubcap, but has the wide 5 bolt pattern.  I don't see any
reason you couldn't use the rims as long as they are the wide 5 bolt
pattern.
