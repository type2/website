Subject: '64 Bus common door fault

Hi all,

I have discovered a manufacturing fault that some of you
may be familiar with.

In late '63 VW decided to modify the check strap spring
strength on the cab doors of all Splitscreen models.
They increased the spring strength so that the doors
would stay open in strong winds or on an incline.

In '64 VW recevied reports of the area of door where the
bottom hinge is riveted to cracking (due to the increased
load of the check spring). In '65 the door bottom hinge
area metal was thickened to reduce possibility of fracture.

Unfortunately I have a '64.

Solution as reccommended by VW was to weld a plate onto the
door surrounding the hinge attachment area thus increasing
the effective thickness of that particular area - did it.
