Ron, you sent a message a little while back saying that you did not need
anything from the European  contingent. I would still be happy to  send a
cheque for a $20 dollars, just please let me know. This list is great and I
want to help it continue in the  way that it has to the benefit of 
everyone.

&gt; Howdy Folks,
&gt; 
&gt; Today's flood of donations brings the total to $662.00!  Thanks to all
who
&gt; have sent in their checks (and cash).  We still have a long way to go, so
&gt; if you've been putting off sending in your contribution, please go write
a
&gt; check.  Like so many folks have said, the list is well worth hundreds of
&gt; dollars of free advice.
&gt; 
&gt; Many folks are writing checks for $10-$25, and these large donations are
&gt; very appreciated (Thanks!)  If everyone on the list only writes a check
for
&gt; $5, we'll have enough to keep the list going.
&gt; 
&gt; Write checks to &quot;Ron Lussier&quot; and send them to:
&gt;      Vanagon
&gt;      c/o Ron Lussier
&gt;      10164 Parkwood Drive #8
&gt;      Cupertino, CA  95014-1533
&gt;      USA
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks in advance, and watch the donations roll in at
