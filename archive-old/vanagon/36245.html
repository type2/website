Subject: Re: 92 Eurovan transmissions

Jake querried about the frequency of replacement transmissions on EVs....


Hmmmmm.....I guess we've been caught folks...I TOLD you guys NOT to post 
those false warranty claims based upon dropping ball bearings into EV 
transmissions...now some one has caught on...so much for spreading rumors 
and false warranty claims....oh well, I guess no matter what we do, no 
matter how hard we try, we can't get the price of used EVs down enough so we 
can corner the market...
