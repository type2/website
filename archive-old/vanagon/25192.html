Subject: Vanagons FS in So. California

I noticed the following Vanagons for sale at a local VW dealer:

1986 Vanagon, AT, A/C, 91K miles, $6,999.

1988 Vanagon Camper, MT, NO A/C, white, 80K miles, $16,999.

1990 Vanagon Camper, MT, Burgundy metalic, A/C, Alloys, $18,999.

All the prices seem pretty steep to me, but Vanagons probably aren't exactly
flying off their lot.  I imagine they'd be quite negotiable.

Usual disclaimers apply.  If your interested call Harry Hill Imports, Covina,
CA 
(818) 967-6325, fax (818) 915-1393,  Ask for George Colome
