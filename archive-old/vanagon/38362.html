Subject: 	pre 1968 westy roofrack question

(For all you people out there that care I am in the process of restoring =
an
old 1/3 length woodslat roofrack that was made by Westfalia Werke back =
in
1965.)

My question involves the  actual roofrack &quot;members&quot; (you know the three
curved &quot;legs&quot; that attach to the drip rail and that the woodslats attach
to). It appears that the &quot;legs&quot; or whatever you want to call them were
originally galvanized w/ a grey galvanixed coating (kinda reminds me of =
the
finish that minnow pails have on them). Anyways my question is do you =
know
what the original coating on the &quot;legs&quot; was/is?? I described it to my =
local
plating house and they thought it was zinc coating. Does anyone know =
what
the original coating was and how expensive it is to get redone??

Hi Micheal,

I wish I had a Westfalia rack to restore!  I think the original finish =
was zinc plated.  Checkout  &quot;Parts is Parts&quot; web =
page(http://www.pipvw_dot_com).  They have some info on roof racks, plus =
they have some repo parts for your rack. =20

Good luck,
Erik
