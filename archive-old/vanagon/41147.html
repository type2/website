Subject: RE: interesting web site


&gt;I just ran across an interesting web site out there &amp; thought y'all might 
be
&gt;interested.  its Edmund's Used Car website and if you dig, you can find how
&gt;they value your bus (as far back as 85 model year).  I found their review 
of
&gt;my 90 camper interesting.  It ends with: &quot;...It appeals to few, costs too
&gt;much, and couldn't fight its way up the side of a wet speed bump.&quot;
&gt;
&gt;hmmmm...  I think I take exception to that remark.

What do you expect from a company that regards the '85 model year as
&quot;way back&quot;?

Not their words, I know, but if that's where they end their listing, then
obviously they agree with this idea.

As for &quot;costs too much&quot;... how much does a new VW Van cost nowadays?
