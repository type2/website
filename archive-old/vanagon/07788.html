Subject:      93 eurovan for sale

if anyone is interested, there is a 93 Eurovan, automatic, 7-passenger
(i forgot to look which model it was: ML, CL, GL) for sale at the local
Toyota dealer. it has 58,000 miles (!?) and one big rock chip (about 1/4&quot;)
in the windshield ... in the driver's vision. :(

if anybody wants to think about it, i can call and find out how much they
want for it. it's a local car, owned by (i think) a chiropractor (he was
the first one in town to buy an EV).

oh, yeah. it's white with light grey interior.

joel
