Subject: More Big Buses (funny cargo)

Circa 1982

Five singular ten mile trips with full pallette(s) of &quot;Superlite&quot; paver
bricks in a '68 single cab. It was the original &quot;slammed to the dirt&quot; bus.
-VanBondo

BTW: Don't ever do this! But do remember about that free delivery service
that I found out about much later...
