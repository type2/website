&gt;From what you describe, you're going to go through in just a few days what
most of us take years to experience. First, your upper ball joints are
probably bad, and the front rotors are way beyond their limit - figure
$2-300 for that alone. Weak engine could be lots of things, all expensive.
Get the car to a good mechanic and have him pressurize the cooling system -
it'll probably need heads, rear heater box, plus some minor odds &amp; ends,
adding another $2-3000, depending. And tires? Read the posts for the last
month! Personally, I'd pass, unless you LIKE duct tape.
