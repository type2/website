Subject: Gallery or Galley, for Oil

	Ben asks which is right, or are both? I've always thought
it was &quot;Gallery&quot;. According to my trusty Webster's New Collegiate:

&quot;gallery&quot;... 2d: a railed walk around the upper part of an engine to 
facilitate oiling or inspection (!) 
3a : a long and narrow passage, appartment or corridor 
b: a subterranean passageway in a cave or military mining system, also
a working drift or level in mining.
c: an underground passage made by a mole or ant, or passage made in
wood by an insect

&quot;Gallery Forest&quot;- a stand of trees growing along a watercourse in an
otherwise arid environment, is also suggestive that &quot;Gallery&quot; is the
correct word. 

	The complete definition of Galley, for contrast:
&quot;galley  1a: a large, low medieval ship propelled by sails and oars...
2: a seagoing ship of classical antiquity...
3: a large open rowing boat...
4: the kitchen and cooking apparatus, esp. of a ship or airplane
5 a: an oblong tray, commonly of pressed steel, with upright sides to hold set
type
b: a proof from type in a galley before it is made up in pages.


	So, with a bow to usage, I'm going to argue that &quot;oil gallery&quot;
is correct and &quot;oil galley&quot; is a typo, misinformation or the result of haste.

	Doesn't that make everyone feel better?
