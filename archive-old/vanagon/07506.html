Subject: Name &amp; Address Please

Vanagoneers:

I've noticed lately that very few people are signing their postings with name, 
let alone name &amp; address. My company has just switched e-mail systems and the 
new software strips absolutely every piece of header info from the mail (and the 
author is always vanagon_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu). If people don't sign their 
postings, I have absolutely no idea who they are, and have no way to reply other 
than to the entire list.

I'm sure that I'm not the only one with this problem and it is definitely 
frustrating, so I ask you all please, sign your postings!!

Thanks!

Paul
