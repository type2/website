Subject: Re: Bentley Manuals-Cheap Source


&gt;&gt;Price quoted for the 68-79 Bus manual was $35.00. Second-day ground
&gt;&gt;shipping was an additional $4.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;The number is 216-572-0725.

&gt;FWIW, I contacted this organization (I believe it is called Dyment
&gt;Corporation, located in Cleveland, Ohio) re:  a Bentley for my 1980 Westy.
&gt;They will take telephone orders with a credit card.....but they want $84.95
&gt;US!!  I passed (out).

After I opened my big mouth I looked at RMMW, and they're the same price on
the Bay manual. I had thought that the Bay manual cost like $75, so I
thought $35 was a great price. Apparently LIMBO sells them for twenty
bucks, somebody said.

But RMMW doesn't show the Vanagon manual at all. I don't know whether $85
is low, high or middling. Maybe you should just get an early Bay. ;)
