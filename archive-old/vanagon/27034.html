Subject: Re: Tailgators


&gt;How about one of those Stun Guns that shoots the electrode on a
&gt;tether, the degree of Crispiness to be determined by the offended.


My own personal favorite: A Halon fire extinguisher in the
trunk, with the nozzle directed backward to where the other
car could draw some into the intake. As a combustion inhibitor,
Halon is unsurpassed. It would be like turning off the guy's
ignition, almost... at least until he had dropped back a ways.

This would be perfect for rear mounting, for virtually any car,
except, well, cars that had their own engines in the back... uh,
with... their own intakes periously near the nozzle... uh...
and those with flat, vertical rears that create swirls and low
pressure to suck the halon into those rear engines...

Well, back to the drawing board.
