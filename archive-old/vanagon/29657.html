&gt;&lt;snip&gt; A cool and elegant solution to a nagging problem.

&gt;I don't know if this D-bolt is original VW, or an
&gt;aftermarket piece.  I would guess that you can find them at
&gt;VW junkyards, or shops where lots of VW work is done
&gt;(mechanics NEVER throw away such handy items!).

First you say *cool and elegant*.  Then you wonder if this
is original VW.  I think you answered your own question
before you asked it.

&gt;&lt;snip&gt;
&gt;If you're lucky (hmmmm), it won't turn as you thread on the
&gt;nut. If your nut/bolt is banged up and binding, get a new
&gt;one-- it repays the cost in aggravation and skinned knuckles
&gt;many times over.

Agree whole-heartedly with the *clean the threads and lube
it good* concept.  Another hint is to hold the bolt in place
with the blade of a carpet knife while *finger starting* the
nut.  The blade is just the right size to fit the grooves of
the thread, and if too much pressure is needed to start the
nut, the blade breaks unstead of messing up your threads.

Fighting the urge to rename this thread Da Bolts...oh, that
Chicago influence gets sickening.
