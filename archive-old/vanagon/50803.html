&gt;I am going to be calling PROPEX in England within the

&gt;Anyway, I'm always ready to talk volume discounts, and its probably
&gt;cheaper to handle export paperwork for one shipment, so if anyone
&gt;is interested in going in on this, please let me know asap.

Why this model in particular? How does it compare to models offered by -
say - Camping World?

$600 seems extremely pricey. Or am I way off base?
