NEVER inflate the tires to more than the cold pressure listed on the
tire sidewall.  That is the maximum that the tire can be inflated to.

&gt;
&gt; &gt; Here's a test of tire knowledge. If my '86 Westy calls for the COLD tire
&gt; &gt; pressure for 185/70-14 tires to be 48 rear/39 front, then what should
&gt; &gt; the pressure be for 195/75-14?
&gt; Denys,
&gt; This is an interesting question. I can't answer-sorry. However I would
&gt; ask you specifically -what- called for those tire pressures. Is this a
&gt; placard on the door jamb, in the camper manual etc.? I am curious to
&gt; know, and would throw out this question to the list:
&gt; What is the concensus on Vanagon Westy tire pressures front and rear, at
&gt; least a loaded-condition ball park?. The 185R-14 Michelins on mine call
&gt; for max load at 35 psi. Can I go considerably higher:-safely-. With my
&gt; little diesel, tire hardness sure makes her roll a lot easier,(kept at
&gt; 35psi f/r) but I don't want a blow-out.
&gt; I don't have any data on tire pressures for my Westy short of what is
&gt; tatooed on the tires themselves. Can someone expand (pressurize) my mind
&gt; on this point?
