&gt; We drove our '81 Westie down to the station to have our new tires mounted.
&gt; Ran great.  Got there and shut it off.  A few minutes later they started it
&gt; and drove it into a bay.  Shut it off.  An hour later the tires were
&gt; mounted, so I started it and drove to the pump.  Shut it off, Filled it,
&gt; and then we started it and went on down the road.  Still no problem.
&gt; 
&gt; About a mile up the street there was a stop sign.  While braking as I
&gt; approached the stop sign, the engine died.  Wouldn't restart.  We got out.
&gt; Could smell gas faintly.  I checked for spark, and it was fine.  We waited
&gt; an hour, but still wouldn't start.  Called AAA.  They came out.  Still
&gt; wouldn't start.  They towed us home and unhooked the car from the tow
&gt; truck.  I got in and it started right up.  Seems to be running fine.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm not sure where to look, but we don't really trust it now, and I want to
&gt; find out what happened.  Any ideas??

The first thing I'd check would be the #2 temp sensor.  Could be as 
simple as the sensor not making good contact with the head.
