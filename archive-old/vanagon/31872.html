This cooling thing is a mystery to me. If heat is understandably important,
how come there is no temp. guage? How does one know if you are running too
hot or for that matter, too cool? One fellow told me that it was like a
barbeque grill; just put your hand on it to see if it's hot! 
Is an engine compartment seal important (naturally I don't have one)? I
gather that engine speed is most important since it may get hot in Atlanta
but obviously not as hot as in the western desert areas. Is it actually
nothing to worry about since VW didn't bother to even mention engine cooling
in their owner's manuals.? This is obviously novice stuff but i'd appreciate
any thoughts on the topic.
BTW, many thanks to the list member who finally spelled out FLAPS and saved
me another novices question.

Thanks, Weston 81 westy
