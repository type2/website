&gt;I was just wondering, doea anyone out there worry about the fact that there
&gt;is 
&gt;not a lot of stuff between the driver and the outside world in a bus??

Paul,

Yeah, I gave it a lot of thought before I bought my Vanagon.  Then someone
who had one told me why they don't worry about it.  He said in an impact with
a 'normal' sedan, the impact would more than likely occur below the
passengers.  He also, told me that there is about a foot and a half of
material within the front of the Vanagon.

I saw a vanagon that had been in a front end collision at a local shop.  The
shop guy told me the Vanagon had been in a head on about 35 mph.  The front
looked nasty, but when I looked in the cab, I saw no visible signs of an
accident.  The mechanic told me the driver wasn't injured.  I was pretty
impressed.

What really pleases my wife about the safety of our Vanagon is that because
it has almost no get-up-and-go, I HAVE to drive defensively.  I used to be a
real jerk when I had my Jeep Grand  Wagoneer and didn't mind terrorizing
folks.  (...back in my immature days).  BTW, I also get a discount (only a
few bucks) off my auto insurance for haveing a 'safe' vehicle according to
them.
