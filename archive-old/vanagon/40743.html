Subject: '76 Bus Fuel Injection Question

Just completed a motor swap on a '76 bus.  Now I _think_ I have 
everything wired correctly, but injectors 3 &amp; 4 aren't getting a 
signal.  I tried swapping the brain, air flow meter, dual relay, 
and the resister pack above the dual relay. Tried reversing the 
3 &amp; 4 injector wiring, just for the heck of it. 
Also checked the standard stuff (points, plugs, compression, etc.), 
which is how I deduced that the problem was an electrical fuel 
injection one. (Compression is 150 lbs all around, and all 
cylinders are definately getting strong spark, but 3 &amp; 4 aren't 
firing. The injectors are bone dry, and they do have continuity.)

Before I start tearing into the wiring harness tomorrow, is there 
anything else I might have missed?  Any suggestions?
