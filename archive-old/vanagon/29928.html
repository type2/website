Andy

I live in Orange, about 3 1/2 hours west of Sydney.

I did some ringing around in Sydney and I think you're going to be out of 
luck with a VW. The main hire companies are Hertz and Britts, neither have 
VWs. You can fax Hertz Campervans (in Adelaide) on (international) 61 8 271 
8546, attention 'Helen'. They're rates are $A175/day with unlimited kilometres.

The main camper builders in Sydney are Trax Conversions (Sydney 417 4000) 
and Winnebago/Freeway (Sydney 609 2388). Both do conversions of new Eurovans 
but neither do fleet sales to camper hire companies. Winnebago export most of 
their production to Japan.

I also tried the NSW motoring organisation (NRMA) and they only deal with 
Hertz.

You might find something when you get to Sydney from one of the small 
independent hirers. Look in the yellow pages. I know that there are some 
in Sydney called Rent-A-Wreck.

Sorry I couldn't have any good news but good luck. 

Can I suggest that if you get a camper, or whatever you get, go for 
air conditioning. Its getting hot and sticky around here at this time of 
the year.

Merry Christmas and have a good holiday.
