Subject: Re: Bucking Clutch



&gt;Recently my '86 Westy has developed a problem with the clutch. After I
&gt;have been driving in stop-and-go traffic for awhile, the clutch begins to
&gt;&quot;chatter&quot; when I try to start from a stop.  The only way I can prevent 
&gt;this from happening is to rev the motor up to about 3000 rpm while I let 
&gt;the clutch out. Any ideas on what is causing this, and what needs to be 
&gt;done to fix it?

My '85 just got a brand new clutch disk, pressure plate, and throwout 
bearing, and a resurfaced flywheel.  Now it's get the above problem.  
(Funny, it didn't do it before I replaced the clutch!)  The only hypothesis 
I've heard yet is that maybe the motor mounts and/or trans mount(s) are 
worn, causing some flex when the clutch is disengaged.  The trans mount 
looks a little cracked, but not horrible.  Any other ideas?
