Subject:      Propane regulator question

I found the propane &quot;leak&quot; and it seems to be coming from a very small =
round hole near the top right corner of the face of my propane =
regulator.  Is this hole supposed to be here and if so what is its =
function and why is gas escaping from it?

Thanks,
Bryan
