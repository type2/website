Hi all

John Wakefield sez:

&gt;  Really interesting.  About a month ago I proposed a friend's suggestion 
&gt;that I cut the end of my Vanagon Westie from the front.  Then, he'd 
&gt;attach a section from a salvage yard donor that included the body from 
&gt;a little forward of the rear window measured so that the extra rear 
&gt;window on each side would appear spaced very like what a factory version 
&gt;of a longer Vanagon might have appeared.  I've seen photos of his long 
&gt;sold extra long Dodge Maxivan done this way, and it appears like an 
&gt;unusually long factory model.  So does this already exist in the Vanagon 
&gt;family of customizations?  Reread the description above.  Stock Vanagon 

Yes, one only

&gt;rear overhang is so short that this addition still wouldn't make it 
&gt;conspicuously customized.  Has anyone seen this done to a Vanagon based 
&gt;vehicle?  The US manufactured vans tricked out this way aren't that 
&gt;unusual, but I'd surely like to talk to someone who's lived with a well 
&gt;done extended Vanagon.  If you sight one, please get a plate number if 
&gt;you can and post your sighting to the list.

Seriously, I took a photo of my fathers Kombi a while ago, been meaning to
mail it to Joel sometime. This van was built as a project in Uitenhage, and
consists of the front part of the older T3 crew cab and a standard kombu
rear. The newer crew cab would have been nicer, the cab is slightly longer.
Anyway, so this van is about 18 inches or so longer than standard kombis.
And the experiment didn't go anywhere, so the van is unique, being a factory
built stretched kombi. Seats 10 + driver.

So John, if you want to check out the van and the 5 cyl engine, come visit :-)
