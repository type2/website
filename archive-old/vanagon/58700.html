Subject: Re: VW recall (exhaust/heat components) 82 Westi

&gt; When I asked what parts are to be replaced, he went on about possible
&gt; PO&quot;s repairs to the exhaust and heater systems. I guess that they will
&gt; replace original equipment HEATER DISTRIBUTION BOXES, FLEX HOSES, AND
&gt; HEAT EXCHANGERS, etc.

I recently faxed Mr Le Coz as well and am impressed as well.  I don't 
really give a rats ass about asbestos but if I can get free heater 
boxes out of the deal I'm in for it.  I note a few suprises, first 
that the '81 is entitled to much of anything as it has the red silicone 
seals on the bellows, BUT I've noticed that apparently some of 
the OEM exchangers have asbestos mats in their bottoms.  Le Coz is 
very closed mouth about what will and will not be replaced.  I'm 
going to run the &quot;recall&quot; on the '77, '78, and '81 at least.  I also 
questioned him about the asbestos seals on my BA6, have not got a 
response on that yet.  Frankly I'll go on record as saying the whole 
policy is somewhat ludicrous, because if the asbestos did get into 
the air stream it would be forever hoplessly entrenched in the 
corrugated paper tubing of the system downstream of the boxes and 
bellows, so if you're really searching for a solution to a largely 
imaginary asbestos problem, your difficulties are far deeper, if you 
are searching for new heater components all the more power to you.  I 
figure this will net me enough sets of heat exchangers to keep the 
'77 in exchangers for life as I'm going to square port heads on the '78.

I wonder if the replacements will be German or Danish, should be 
interesting.

I also make another query, weren't some of the early flapper valves
sealed with asbestos on the steel flapper, inquiring minds want to 
know and get their flapper boxes replaced as well.
