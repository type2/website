Subject: pretour #2 (W.N.NE.&amp;SE.)


OK hackerz!  I finally had a block of free time long enough to tally
the responses to the query about pretour gathering #2.  It seems that
with a few exceptions that two lobby groups have formed:

1.  Some Bay Area people, S. CA people, and 4 or so people from the SW
    (i.e. AZ, NM, etc.).

2.  Some Bay Area people, others from Oregon, Washington, and W. Canada,
    plus a few from Montana, etc.

No. 1 above is the larger group, and except for 2 people, all of you
have exhibited a preference for March 24-26 dates.  The location
of choice mentioned several times is Red Rock Canyon, which I believe
is rather near the Mojave desert, although I haven't gone so far as
to look at a map yet.  This is in fact rather far from the SF area,
where the majority of our list members reside within a 1.5 or so hour
driving radius, but meeting at Red Rock for this trip seems fairer
to our southern members, who made the trek up to Big Sur last time,
and simultaneously allows members from AZ and NM to attend more
readily.  

I therefore propose that we vote collectively for March 24-26 at
Red Rock for group No. 1.

Further, a nomination or two was made to enable No. 2 group to
meet somewhere centrally located to all those interested (perhaps
NE Oregon or so?).

This plan allows for two gatherings, both hopefully located rather
central to the two groups interested in them.  Bay Area contingency
(and anyone else, for that matter) could attend either or both.
How does this sound?  Can I have some date suggestions for the NW
group?
