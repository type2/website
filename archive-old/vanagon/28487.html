Subject: Harbor Freight Torque Wrench?

	There has been quite a bit of mail on the 3/4&quot; ratchet set lately 
and I am planing on getting ASAP.  I am still an under equipped neophyte 
and I need to buy a torque wrench.  I noticed that Harbor Freight has a 
3/8&quot; drive, 0-80 ft/lbs(unit?) for under $20.   Is this a good wrench for 
a do-it-yourselfer? Or should I pay the $50+ for a Craftsman?  (I hope 
this is not a religious issue.)

	Thank You.
