&gt; Hi Listmembers:
&gt; I saw this listed for sale a few days ago and was curious about why there
&gt; would be a VW adapter plate?  I thought that the Corvair motor rotated in the
&gt; opposite direction that the VW turns, so one would have to use the Corvair
&gt; tranny - hence no adapter plate.  Set me straight on this one.

Gary,

I'm not sure of the years as it has been so long ago (25 years ago), but
at least in some of the Bug transaxles, you were able to flop the ring
gear from one side to the other and cause the trans to turn backwards
(useful when building a mid-engined sand buggy).  If the ring gear is
flopped, the corvair motor would then turn the trans the correct
direction.  Cheap (but reliable?) hp.
