Subject:      Diagnosing Cruise Control Failure

Not sure what to do next. Manual is wrong!

Followed manual for checking out cruise control system and everything checks
out OK except the last test, which is to test the cruise control speed
sensor mounted in the instrument panel.

Manual says sensor should be something like 110 ohms but it tests out at
1,110 ohms or thereabouts. Ordered two new speed sensors and they both also
test out at 1,000+ ohms so that is obviously not the problem.

The problem is somewhere else, but everything tests out OK.

Guess I need to find another Vanagon equipped with factory cruise control
parts in my neighborhood (NYC--good luck Derek), and swap out parts until I
find the bad one.

I guess I could leave my van with Long Island's Dennis Haynes but this is a
very long drive for me.

[By the way, if you need your van fixed and you live on Long Island, you
should bring that van to Dennis for repair instead of bringing it to the
dealer, or anyone else, for that matter. Also, if you are in the market for
a trailer hitch, get one from Dennis. I have no association with Dennis
other than being a satisfied customer...]
