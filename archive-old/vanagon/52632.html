&gt;Well....letseee here.....
&gt;They've &quot;invented&quot; the following so far....
&gt;
&gt;-&quot;Ch**sler - We invented the Minivan&quot;   (a.k.a. the sh*tbox)
&gt;- &quot;Ch**sler - We've thought of everything&quot; Introducing our revolutionary
&gt;concept
&gt;of  dual sliding doors on a van  (what a breakthru concept!!!)
&gt;-&quot;Autostick transmission&quot;   Duh, there's a first..... (Hmm....weren't they
&gt;the
&gt;ones who also came out with that push button auto trans? looks like that one
&gt;was
&gt;a real winner too)
&gt;-a (sorry excuse for a) Pickup truck with 3 doors....(or was that
&gt;chevr-oilet?)
&gt;
&gt;can anybody else think of any more of their &quot;inventions&quot;??

A BIG one!!  With the introduction of the Intrepid/Vision/&amp; the Chrysler
model I can't remember the name of, the touted their breakthrough design
inovation of:
                  &quot;Cab-Forward design&quot;.  
You want cab forward?  I got cab-forward!  All Vanagons have &quot;cab-forward'&quot;.
 All previous versions of VW's van have &quot;cab-forward&quot;!!!
