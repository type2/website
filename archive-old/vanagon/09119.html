&gt; I found a 1982 Diesel Westphalia camper at a local VW dealer. 
&gt; The acceleration on hills was weak, as expected.  They're asking $4900 
&gt; should watch out for if I decided to buy, and lastly, how many miles can 
&gt; welcome any and all comments/suggestions/tips.

Mr. Owen,

  I am &quot;Lord of the Diesel Expenses&quot;. Learn from me. It will save you money.

1) Get the engine checked carefully. Pay for a compression check at a good
VW Shop. (Diesels take a special tester, and you have to pull the injector 
to do it.)

2) Get the engine checked for blow-by. Unless you want a condom covering
your oil filler to keep the oil in. (Part of #1)

3) Look for oil leaks. If there is a great deal of blow-by, the seals will
break.

A good diesel can run forever. The Gasoline version of the '82 was air-cooled.
My Mechanic has a '82 air-cooled westy for sale for $4500-$5000, with 15K
fewer miles (for price comparison sake)

Maintenance is low. Valve adjustments from time to time. Timing belts are
critical, since if they break, Mr. Piston hits Mr. Valve. (I just had a $700
top-end overhaul on my replacement engine after timing belt problems). Oil 
changes more frequently...
