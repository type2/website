Subject: Brake Fluid ??
Date: Wed, 08 Jan 97 13:45:00 CDT


The Bently Mannual states that only Dot 4 brake fluid be applied to 
Vanagons.  Does anyone know the difference between Dot 3 &amp; Dot 4.  I have a 
ton of Dot 3, can I use it or is that stupid.

Also, I seem to be losing brake fluid, filled it 1.5 months back and now it 
need more.  Anyone have any suggestions?  Could it be the lines or is it 
more likely the brake assembly somewhere?
