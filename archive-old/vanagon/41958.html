Subject: A/C compressor not turning

This weekend I tried the A/C and I noticed the engine didn't change
speed when the compressor supposedly kicks in. Sure enough, when the 
A/C is switched on, the compressor clutch didn't engage.

Outside temperature was 70F so the temp sensors should have allowed the 
compressor to engage.

Before I have it looked at by a professional, does anyone have
any suggestions or recommendations? I welcome all thoughts and opinons
since my A/C knowldge is very limited. 

Thanks,
