Well, the dealer's in Santa Ana, Commonwealth VW. If ya came up the
405  or 5, you get on the 55 east get off _at_ Edinger and hang a left
and the Auto Mall will be on your right, follow the road til ya see

the dealer. right now they haven't any Vanagons(actually Vanagons
tradeins _at_ dealers are very rare!), just a  loaded 93 EuroVan that's

in really nice shape. It's the  light blue/tourqoise color with
custom  graphics, also has curtains...it's like $15,995 last time I
saw.
If you want to call them: 714-565-7500
Oh, if you do check out the place and there's a Burgandy GL sittin
there, don't bother. That's my trade in!
It may have newer heads,h20 pump, clutch master &amp; alt...but I
wouldn't buy it for it's luxury, there isn't any. There's been  to
many problems with it, I wouldn't want a lister to buy it and go thru

what I went thru with that one!
