Subject: tire info,


 the one tire that i have not seen mentioned
 are the Continential's. in the past i have had average luck
 with the continental passenger car tires( i don't like them very much)
 i did however find a set of 185 R14 8 ply reinforced tires for
 my truck, they're good up to 55 psi.
 
 anyone else have these? i like them in theory, but sometimes
 i think the michelen (sp) tires though only 6 ply and 35 psi
 wear better...

 i would love to find a better quality 8 ply tire than the continentals.
