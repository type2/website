Hey Snuggles!

Adjusting the torsion bars IS expensive. It might be hard to find air 
shocks (I couldn't). 

I bought a pair of springs that bolt (clamp) on to your existing shocks 
for $40 from JCW. They sometimes make squeaking noises when the bus is 
rockin', but occaisonal slathers of grease fix that problem....

Not an eloquent solution, but it's worked for over six years....
