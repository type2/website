Subject: dust caps

it seems to me that there are some discrepancies here

I had the hardest time taking me dust cap off the fist time i did.  There was
no ridge to pry it with.  Screwdrivers were futile.  nothing to hook the claw
onto, either.  Later learned the tap hammer with hammer trick. This style was
used through 63.

When i was introduced to the later style, with handy ridge to pry the dust
cap off with, it was a piece o' cake to pry it off.   Used from 64 to 70?
 Dont know about those disc brake buses.
