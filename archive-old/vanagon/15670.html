Subject: Tire/wheel questions [T4]

Uh, first off, the following questions are in no way related to the late
thread we had on blasphemy, etc., so please don't throw me off the list,
Gerry...   ;)


Anyway, a friend of mine with an E36 BMW offered me his used wheels and
tires (OEM)... so here are my questions:

1) Does anybody know if the bolt pattern for an E36 is 5x65?  Offset=44mm?

2) If I recall correctly, the tires are 205/55or60VR/15, which isn't too
   far off from what's on the EV now; would the strength of a VR rated
   tire equate with a &quot;reinforced&quot; light truck tire?
   Obviously, I'm not going to be driving around at 149mph all day long,
   but I would like a little crisper turn in, and I was just wondering
   if this setup might work.  There's also the added benefit of reduced
   rotational weight from the alloy wheels.


TIA for any and all help!
