John,

I went to silicone as part of a brake system overhaul; all new wheel
cylinders, same master but with a kit installed.  I did as your dad did, and
as we did with all of our ground equipment in the Navy.  There were a lot of
dire warnings from various 'experts' at that time as well.  The silicone
appears to have a smaller molecule size -- it will leak in some systems that
were dry using DOT 3 -- but once you have a tight system you'll find the
silicone far superior to the old oil/alcohol mix.

But perhaps I shouldn't ruffle any feathers; the list owner of the vintage
 vw list kicked me off after I pointed out a number of dangerous errors in
the wildly popular VW manual written by John Muir.
