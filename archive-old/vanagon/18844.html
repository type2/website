Subject: Once again....Tires

The story so far...
1) I bought, in a moment of weakness and urgency, 185 R14 tires (light
truck, no less! At least they're 6 ply) about 6 months ago.
2) It's now time to replace the other two tires.

The dilemma...
1) I want factory spec tires (reinforced).
2) I want a good smooth ride.
3) I've heard 205's give a smoother ride than 185's.
4) I could get two 205's and put them on the rear and the 185's on the front.

The questions...
1) Would mixing tires like this be REAL BAD? (I'd keep the same sizes on
each axle, bigger tires on the rear).
Will the van break apart in the middle?  ;-) 
2) Do I need to be so concerned about moving up to 205's? Is their ride
really much smoother than the ride of 205's on my Volksie? Should I just
stick with 185's and not sweat it?


Hmmmmm...
Thanks,
Dave
