Subject: Re: so-34 doodad prices



following on my previous post i am wondering if anyone could assess the 
relative scarcity or monetray value of these other so-34 items that i have a 
lead on

-little cone-shaped 6V light that plugs in at the back(?) cabinet
-cabinet that hangs on front cargo door
-small metal &quot;plate&quot; that attaches to spare tire rim to form base of portable 
table
-two wedge shaped cushions or pillows.

if _anyone_ has any thoughts as to the value of these items or if possible they 
have any of these items i would like to hear from them :)

thanks again for any thoughts, leads flames you name it :)
