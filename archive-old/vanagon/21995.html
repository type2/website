Subject:      RE:  VW AWNING



Hey Michael, why not go with an awning made for your machine? VW CANVAS
specializes in such stuff. They have a side awning kit, with poles, ropes, and
stakes for 149.00 in stock color ($198 if you want custom--maybe something in
plaid or pazley?) I got a new cot for the upper bunk from them--nice folks.
When I wrote for a price list they sent one with polaroids of their
products--nice. Think when the time comes (with the cash) I will get my new
three window convas for the top from them.
