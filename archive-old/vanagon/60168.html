Subject: ChemToliet for Westy's

Well when ya gotta go, ya gotta go... 

Theres lots of really neat desert around here (Reno NV). But not too many 
facilities out there in the wide open. So enter the chemical toliet or 
&quot;porta potti&quot; (PP's) for my 85 Westy...                                          
                                                                                 
The wife does require some nicities so I looked into the PP's on the market.   
Best one I found was the Thetford 155 Porta Potti (Wal Mart $60). Its a very 
sanitary unit in its construction. Two piece unit, top contains 2.5 gallons    
of clean water to flush with, bottom allows 4 gallons of waste. Absolutly      
no odor, the bottom detaches to carry to a restroom (when one's finally 
available). Bottom contains a flush tube that swivels out into the john.       
                                               
Best part of all is that it fits easily into the undersink cabinet. I just     
removed the shelf (placed it on the bottom of the cabinet). So if you don't 
mind giving up some cabinet space its a great fit. Or if you want to still 
have some cabinet space, the Thetford Porta Potti 135 is smaller (2.5 gal      
of waste space) and leaves a few inches for the re-positioned shelf. I           
went for the 155. 
                                                                                 
Well hows this for a after lunch e-mail. Like I said when ya gotta go... 

Richard - 85 Westy
