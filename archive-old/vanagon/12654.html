Subject: Re: 83 Vanagon Water Cooled Camper-HELP

&gt;My Camper is sick.
&gt;1.) Put in another 83 waterboxer engine    
&gt;    pros-it will fit easily 
&gt;    cons-this engine has problems  
&gt;               they are expensive ($1800-1500 price range I've found with
&gt;core return) 

Finding a trustworthy garage, with waterboxer experience, and only 
rebuilding what was needed would likely be cheapest, depending on the nature 
of the blown engine. If you have really blown chunks of metal out of the 
main engine block or heads then you may not even get your core charge BTW.
         The above price needs about 2 full days labour for an equipped 
garage for the swapover of engine components like the alternator and fuel/ 
exhaust systems. The exhaust system may need some $$ bits added. Buying a 
complete used engine in good condition is also a possibility, reducing 
labour to removal/installation, about 4-6 hours.
        This can be done in a carport, IF you can jack the rear of your van 
up at least a foot for engine removal. I think that you would find that the 
investment in tools, $150 at least, obtaining jackstands/trolley jack, 
rent'em, would add a lot to your efforts/overhead. If you buy a new core, it 
would take you a couple of weekends+evenings to: pull the old motor (3 
hours), strip it down, (4+ hours), round up new bolts/gaskets/clamps/hoses 
(day(s)/week), transfer to new block (8+), reinstall and startup, (inc. 
setting ignition timing, oil/coolant etc.etc) (6+). This are LOW estimates 
most likely, nothing ever goes as planned, especially without some initial 
experience. If ANYTHING goes wrong, YOU PAY ANYWAY! 
        You will save money, $500-800 maybe. You may be able to save some 
money by removing your old engine, taking it to a garage and letting them 
rebuild it, then reinstalling it yourself, but now you are only saving 
garage removal/installation time &lt;4-6 hrs. Having a salvage yard swap 
complete engines may be $$ competive, if they will stand behind the 
engine/their work.



&gt;2.) Put in a different engine 
&gt;         pros-better engine 
&gt;                   cons-conversion kit needed, possible heating
&gt;modifications,  no manual to                       follow-new territory etc
&gt;etc etc 

Kennedy Engineering Products are the biggest suppliers of conversion bits, 
you can put almost any engine in BUT.... you need an engine, my choice would 
be a Subaru Legacy Turbo/nonT, It is a 'flat' 4 cyl. engine, watercooled 
with up to 160 HP, and will cost you ?? $600+/- ?? at a junkyard. Almost 
anything else requires some engine compartment work because the motors are 
too tall. You must get ALL the engine, fuel injection computer etc. From KEP 
you will need a an adapter plate, maybe a flywheel and clutch, for about 
$500+. This puts you near the same price range as a replacement VW engine, 
which WILL have a warranty, and WILL fit first time.



A lot of help can come from this list, so give us more details.......

1) did you loose all your engine oil or coolant?
2) does the engine spin freely using the starter/will it start?
3) did the engine loose power slowly/rapidly/instantaneously with a loud bang?
4) did the engine run after it was blown?
5) what were you doing when it went, high speed/city/idle
6) what exactly did PEP boys say was blown, what was their estimate for, 
parts listed and hours required?
 Inquiring minds want to know...... remember, this could be us some day!  tim s.
