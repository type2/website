Subject: Administrator Soliciation for Replacement.

Hi Gang,
I've been running the Vanagon_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu mailing list for over 3 years
now.  It's been great, but frankly, I'm very tired of it and would like to
stop.
I'm looking for someone to take over the list.  All of it. Ron Lussier was 
interested in hosting it at his site, but backed out for reasons of network
resources and $$.


By the end of this month, I will be turning it off.  Anyone interested in
taking on this job in any way is welcome to it.



P.S. Thanks for all the beer!
