Subject: Re: Still Being Screwed...aka--Don't Use PartsPlace


HANG IN THERE, IT WILL ALL BE WORHT IT ONCE IT IS RUNNING.
Ive been there, and been there, and been there; that's why I bought a 
EuroVan but it still is missing something you have, a car with personal 
feeling and accompolishment, and frustrations.  You gotta pay your 
dues.

&gt;the saga continues...i just called partsplace and now am told they 
don't have
&gt;the axle assemblies in stock. i still haven't received a refund of the 
$260
&gt;they have of mine...the local vw parts places dont' have the parts. i 
can't
&gt;order from another outfit cuz i don't have the money. i'm screwed.
&gt;
&gt;i won't get the money back until they receive the parts. i'm 
considering
&gt;getting in touch with the BBB and have talked to the bank about 
possible fraud
&gt;when they overbilled me when the guy on the phone knew perfectly well 
i wanted
&gt;one and not two axle assemblies.
&gt;
&gt;meanwhile my van sits in the backyard with a newly done wax job just 
waiting
&gt;to be driven. have a feeling i won't be going anywhere next weekend 
either.
&gt;
&gt;anyone in the raleigh, nc area have a sparte axle assembly for a '74 
bus,
&gt;standard drive? this is all i'm missing to be on the road. i'm so 
pissed at
&gt;this whole situation...makes me wonder why i bought a vw. :-( have had 
the van
&gt;for almost 4 weeks now and driven it only once around the block.
