&gt; Opinions on Auto Trans Vanagons?

I've had plenty of problems with Da Rust Bucket's FI system but never
*any* with its auto transmission.  (I don't exactly know the
relationship between the autotrannies they put on the air-cooled vans
and the ones for wasserboxers.) Yeah, it slides between gears a little
lacksadasically but that's part of its charm (oh, we all know about
those charming VWs ;-) and keeping the ATF topped up prevents it from
getting too bad.  One theory is that the long shift transition is due to
engine oil mixing with ATF at the seal; mine's a little leaky there so
it's plausible.

Tell your neighbors that if they buy an autotrans Vanagon that the
transmission will be the *least* of their worries!
