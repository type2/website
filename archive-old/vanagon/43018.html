Subject: Re: yet another oil temp. gauge question\breadloafs.

Hey Linda,
  To wire the oil temp gauge in my 73 bus I didn't go by the wiring colors
in the Bentley manual, I took a voltmeter to the beast and saw for myself.
What you'll probably wanna do is put the gauge illumination on the terminal
that now is all the dashboard lights (this is the one with the variable
voltage due to the resistor) and wire the dashboard lights to the terminal
with constant 12V (when parking lights on). If you wire gauge AND dashboard
lights through the resistor you'll almost extinguish the remaining dashboard
lights when you dim the gauge light a bit. I found the instrument lights are
so dim anyway, it doesn't hurt to keep 'em on maximum brightness full time...
  Good luck,
                G.
