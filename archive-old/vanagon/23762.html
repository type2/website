Subject: RE: Negavtive current from my generator !!!?????



&gt;     So we get a rebuilt generator (like new) and stick it in. The red
&gt;     light now glows like a flare! putting a voltmeter positive on the
&gt;     battery terminal and negative on D+ we get like -24 Volts, we reckon
&gt;     this comes from current flowing from the battery + the negative
&gt;     current being produced by the generator.
&gt;
&gt;     So we took the generator off and did the recommended VAG test of
&gt;     connecting DF to the case and measuring the voltage between D+ and
&gt;     the case whilst spinning the generator at around 2000 revs.
&gt;
&gt;     The meter read around -13v and the generator was clearly under load as 

&gt;     it should be in this test. But why negative voltage???


Uh-oh... St. Muir, bless his immortal soul, is frowning down upon
you from that great publishing house in the sky. You didn't follow
his advice on polarizing the generator before you put it in!

There's a piece of fancy metal inside the generator, that is supposed
to be a magnet that will produce current when the armature spins by
it. But it comes from the factory unmagnetized, so you can customize
your generator to spin in either direction; or so you can put it in a
positive-ground car (I had a '60 Sunbeam Alpine that was like this).

Muir has a detailed description of how to polarize the generator--
how to get that piece of metal magnetized in the right direction,
before you put it in the car. Once the metal is magnetized even
slightly, the field will build upon itself as the generator turns,
and get strong enough to produce 30 amps or whatever.

The procedure is quite simple, but I don't have it here in front of me.
And yes, even though you seem to have lost the coin-flip and wound up
with a backward-polarized generator, it CAN be re-polarized in the
right direction, by following the same procedure, even at this late
date.

VW dealers and electrical shops all know this procedure-- takes
maybe 10 seconds. Give them a call!
