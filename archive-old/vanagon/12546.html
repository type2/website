Subject: Re: 83 Vanagon Water Cooled Camper-HELP



&gt;supposed to look like on one, and on the other (offending member) there was
&gt;a portal with ragged metal around where the lifter should be. Alex suggests
&gt;that we do not have the raw material to rebuild this engine. I have been

&gt;1.) Put in another 83 waterboxer engine    
&gt;    pros-it will fit easily 
&gt;    cons-this engine has problems  
&gt;               they are expensive ($1800-1500 price range I've found with
&gt;core return) 


Sounds like you do not have a returnable core.  Cores have to be rebuildable.





&gt;2.) Put in a different engine 

OUCH


&gt; Where to get conversion kits &amp; instructions???? 

Fitting a completely different engine into your 83 Vanagon will take much
more than a conversion kit and a set of instructions.  It may even end up
being more expensive than replacing the stock engine (maybe).  Plus, you
might end up with a van with unforeseen reliabilty problems.  Do you wish
to have the van back on the road sometime soon?  I think that you would be
better off buying a rebuilt stock engine for your 1983 Vanagon.

What factors caused the engine to blow?  How many miles were on it? 
Engines do have a service life, after which they must be rebuilt/replaced. 
Just because the original engine blew doesn't necessarily mean that it is
an inherently bad engine.  Expensive to fix, those Vanagons are, yes - but
if you REALLY want a Vanagon, then the logical conclusion....

IMHO, get a rebuilt stock engine.
