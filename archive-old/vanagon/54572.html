&gt; Why won't it work? Remember the purpose of a fuse is to protect the wiring
&gt; and equipment in the circuit. If the 100w bulb draws 7.6 amps it is below
&gt; the rated current carrying capacity of the wire. Also I ran 140w bulbs in
&gt; my 72 bus and never blew a fuse or wire and didn't have unusually short
&gt; bulb life. My advice is go ahead and use them. IMHO

Don't do it. The fuse is there to protect against electrical shorts only.
 Often fuses are rated for 5 time the current draw of the protected circuit.
 This does not mean that the circuit can safely handle 5 times the current.
 Specificallly, others on this list have installed high wattage bulbs in
86-91 Vanagon headlights and have toasted the wiring at the back side of the
headlight connector.
