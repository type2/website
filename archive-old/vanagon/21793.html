Subject: shots of bus on movie &quot;The 'Net&quot;


Anyone check out the movie &quot;The 'Net&quot; yet?  There's two deliberate
shots of a red and white splittie, plus one of a VW rabbit 'vert,
plus one of a bug.  I think &quot;someone&quot; in the production of that
film likes the VW mentality  ;)
