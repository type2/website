Subject: Re: Eurovan Syncro!

I have a 1996 German Caravelle/Multivan brochure which features some Germans
in some very ugly clothing and lots of EV pictures with great features.  They
include leather, automatic climate control, quad seating, power moonroof, and
Syncro.

&gt;From what I could make from the brochure it's only available on
Caravelle/Multivan TDI models, which I thought was odd.  They feature the red
Syncro throughout brochure towing a horse trailer, and was filled with some
other great photos.
