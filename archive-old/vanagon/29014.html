Subject: waterpumps



 When we replace wasserboxer waterpumps we use a newpump from a company
 called &quot;GRAF&quot;. I can check out more specifics on the pumps later tonight
 when i go by the shop. we usually have them in stock. i'm pretty
 sure they are made in germany. They seem to really hold up well, even
 better than the original. sounds weird i know....
 as for price they are not to bad. the job of replacing to pump isn't
 to bad to do. maybe you (Wes) could find someone in your area to help walk you
 through it. it would save you alot of money. that 450.00 dollar price
 you got seem a bit high to me. my personal engine doesn't have AC or
 power steering, so on my own transporter it is even an easier job.
 getting to the pump was a little easier.

 write if you wnat specifics..
