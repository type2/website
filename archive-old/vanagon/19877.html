&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I'm sorry that you have had tons of problems with your VW...perhaps
&gt; &gt; you have a lemon...perhaps its bad karma...or VANma as the case
&gt; &gt; may be...but your sample results don't jive with my sample results...
&gt; &gt; therefore IMHO, your sample results are not valid!
&gt; 
&gt; I don't think Sergio has a lemon, I strongly believe the service department
&gt; did not analyze or did not complete fix his van in the first place.  His
&gt; complaint should be with the VW service department and not VW engineering
&gt; or any other VW car make.  I think his best avenue for getting the problem
&gt; with his van solved is through legal help.  If I were you Sergio, I take
&gt; all the paperwork involved and have a discussion with an attorney.  See
&gt; what can be done and go from there.  Your only other alternatives are
&gt; to sell the van &quot;as-is&quot;, deal with VW arbitration or fix the problem
&gt; yourself.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm also sorry that you had these problems and hope that you can reach
&gt; a satisfactory agreement with the VW service department.  Not all VW
&gt; cars are dis-satisfying, even my van which is quite similar to yours.
&gt; Otherwise, why would all these folks on the list(s) drive them?

Same argument... Yes, I agree that the PROBLEM is service related....but I may in fact have a
*(&amp;^*%T*&amp;^*(&amp;()*_)( lemon!  Arbitration didn't work, being reasonable didn't work, I have tried
a different dealer who wouldn't want to take responsability. I hate to sell it to a VW-lover and
make a VW-hater out of him/her. I have not found a reliable mechanic in my area yet, so, it's time
 for the wonderful judicial system to work. Watch me on People's court soon.
