Subject: 82 Vanagon E-Brake doesnt hold

I cant seem to keep my 82 vanagon's E-brake adjusted so that it
will hold me on steep hills. I take it to my mechanic, he
adjusts it, then 1 month later, its out of adjustment
again and wont hold me.

I have been told that its my e-brake cables  - they are stretched.
I replaced these once (albeit with *used*, probably also stretched cables)
and it didnt help.

  Are there any good solutions for this?

Thanks!
