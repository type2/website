&gt; VWs have ALWAYS been underpowered when compared to other cars.

You have GOT to be kidding me.

I'll remember that the next time I drive my VW Fox past all the
other cars in its class on the freeway. It's a joy to pass a Nissan
Sentra at 115mph on the freeway

&gt; It seems that their engineeers have this delightful habbit
&gt; to give their cars just enough power to get the job done..

I think that even my '89 Vanagon has more power than is really
necessary, let alone a VR6 Corrado.

Oh, I suppose you're talking about just the vans. :)

&gt; nothing more, nothing less. Why should the EV be any different?

I've never driven a Eurovan. :)

&gt; Again, why are you trying to compare apples with oranges. The EV
&gt; is as much of a minivan as the Vanagon was....just because it has
&gt; a front engine configuration does not make it a minivan.

True enough. It's a little bigger and hopefully doesn't feel like
driving a car. I hate that feel in something big.

&gt; &gt;Not to mention that the upcoming Winnebago version of the EV is
&gt; &gt;in the $30K range.  Give me a break.  How many people can afford
&gt; &gt;that? Given the number of people with new Vans (listed in this
&gt; &gt;mailing list) I don't see too many buyers for the EV Camper.  If
&gt; &gt;there are, I want an application.  ;) 
&gt;  
&gt; VW campers have always been expensive, just compare them to
&gt; existing camper conversions. So you are not telling me anything
&gt; new here. Perhaps if you wish to continue on this thread, maybe
&gt; you should index the prices of VW campers since the 70s to the
&gt; consumer price index to see if infact $30k is unreasonable.

In '89 I paid $24K for my Westy. They ain't cheap. :)
