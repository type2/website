Subject: 170 degree thermostat in '83 Diesel

I just encountered an after market thermostat for controling water flow 
to the radiator.  The start of the opening movement is supposed to occur 
at 170 degrees F. and that would probably have it fully open by about 190 
degrees F.  Since my 1983 diesel Westie operating in the Florida heat is 
limited by my willingness to run only untill the heat flashing light 
starts, then I back off just a little untill it goes off and then restart 
loop.  So I'm looking at changing to this 170 degree unit and changing my 
two radiatior mounted thermostat switches.  I'd move my lower temp unit 
to the top (fast fan circuit control) position and replace my lower one 
with one that would turn the low speed fan circuit on about 20 degrees 
lower.  So far, the only time I've ever heard this fan operate was when I 
bridged across each of these thermostats to test the fan.  I've pan 
heated each of these thermostats with aligator test leads to a VTOM, and 
they're both within Bentley published specs.
  Do these measures seem reasonable?  This would be a great time to use a 
radiator flush and replace the phospate free 50-50 coolant.
  Comments?
