Subject:      Thanks

I would like to thank everyone who responded to my query on what to see,
visit do on my move west.  I appreciate all the ideas (any more?! :) )
that generous people took the time to send me.
Also HUGE thankyousd go out to Tom Carrington for the FREE diesel
injector pump for my van.  The generosity of this list is unbelieveable!
I will truly miss it when I must give up my email account when I leave!
best regards
Paul Cronin
