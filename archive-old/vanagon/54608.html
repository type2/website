This is a '68 bus.  Email him, not me!

It can probably be had for _much_ less as he _has_ to dump it.

Its in Sacramento, California, by American River College

&gt;&gt; &gt; This bus was a project of mine a few years back that kinda got derailed
&gt;&gt; &gt; during my divorce.  The shell was purchased from a wreaking yard (have
&gt;&gt; &gt; reciept) almost completely stripped down.  Still needs an engine and
&gt;&gt; &gt; some minor electrical, but I did have it driving at one time (with a
&gt;&gt; &gt; borrowed engine).
&gt;&gt; &gt; 
&gt;&gt; &gt; I'm moving, and have no place for it at the new house (have several cars
&gt;&gt; &gt; in similar state).  I need to have it gone no later than 1-31-97, and if
&gt;&gt; &gt; it doesn't go, I will be donating it to charity for a tax write-off.
&gt;&gt; &gt; 
&gt;&gt; &gt; I'd like to get $300 for it.
