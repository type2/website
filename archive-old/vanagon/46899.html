Subject: Wanted:  Source for canvas for repairs

I've got several holes in my poptop fabric on my '85 and '81 courtesy of a
couple of mice and some rot.  The holes are pretty small and I'd hate to
replace all the canvas, it's intact, just has a few holes.

So, who knows a source for material for patch repairs?  The damned bugs
have figured out how to get in through the holes!
