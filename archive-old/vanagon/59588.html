I'm in too, and please let me know if you need anything else.

In the next days i'm registering a channel #Vanagon in IRC (irc.another_dot_net:6667)
If anyone is interested in live chats there, please let me know and i can give 
you directions on how to get irc software, and how to get into Anothernet
(A little secure irc network free of harrasers :)

&gt; &gt;Hi Gang,
&gt; &gt;I've been running the Vanagon_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu mailing list for over 3 years
&gt; &gt;now.  It's been great, but frankly, I'm very tired of it and would like to
&gt; &gt;stop.
&gt; &gt;I'm looking for someone to take over the list.  All of it. Ron Lussier was
&gt; &gt;interested in hosting it at his site, but backed out for reasons of network
&gt; &gt;resources and $$.
&gt; 
&gt; I just want to mention that I'm willing to run the list, but I'd need to
&gt; purchase a machine and software (LISTSERV) to host the list, which would
&gt; cost approximately $1500.00.  Bandwidth is not a problem... my site has a T1.
&gt; 
&gt; If folks on the list are willing to pony up an average of $3 apiece for a
&gt; host machine and the LISTSERV software license, I'll run the list.
