Hi, all!

Do any of y'al...uh... you all use the flashing headlights to greet on-
coming Type IIs, or is that passe'?

I remember when the Rabbit GTI first came out we'd greet oncoming GTIs
with a flash, but then there got to be gazillions of 'em and not everyone
was with the program, so, sadly, that came to an end...

Norman
