&gt; Help..  I just had the propane tank filled and after checking for leaks woth
&gt; soapy water I found that gas was leaking from the center of the pressure
&gt; regulator, out a tiny square hole in the face of it. Er.. is this 'normal'
&gt; operation? It would normally be under the plastic cover.

as i understand it, ANY leaks are not 'normal' with propane but it is 
my experience that while they may not be 'normal', they are common.  
my regulator on my home furnace ALWAYS stinks, despite repeated 
checks by the Propane People and assertions everything is fine.  yet 
if i call them, they say, 'no, you shouldn't ever smell propane from 
the regulator.'  i think the field service peoples' noses are burnt 
out.

when i turn on my propane on the Westy, i hear a 'fffft' from the 
main shut-off valve and think i feel a wisp of propane emit from around the 
shut-off stem. this seems to be different than the 'ffft' of the 
system pressurizing.   i definately smell it.  then everything seems to be 
tight and leak-free... no bubbles anywhere, no odor, and if the main 
valve is closed, i retain pressure at the stove for days, until i 
turn the burner on whereby it emits a brief fart and then doesn't 
re-pressurize (showing me the main valve isn't leaking).  i do not 
have bubbles emit from the regulator.

&gt;          It says on the regulator 'for outdoor use', and the leak is sooo
&gt; small that it blows bubbles slowly. But! has anyone else ever noticed this,
&gt; or smelled a tiny whiff of propane near the regulator. It happens when the
&gt; valve is opened, and for a while after I close it, until pressure in the
&gt; lines up to the stove drops off. The system hasn't had propane in it for XX
&gt; years I believe, if ever.

might not be a problem if it seals up after intial turn-on... 
HOWEVER, a regulator is fairly cheap and might be worth it to 
eliminate worry.  i've thought of replacing mine just because it 
looks grungy.
