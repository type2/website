&gt;
&gt;&gt;well, everybody else is telling their lies about hauling around the
&gt;&gt;Statue of Liberty or the National Debt in their buses!!! so i just figure
&gt;&gt;i'll throw my lies out on the table. :)
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;No lie here! Maybe just a little exaggeration, tho: The Statue of Liberty
&gt;actually couldn't fit inside, entirely. I supported the torch with a
&gt;little trailer behind my '69 in Colorado.

So is that where it was when David Copperfield made it disappear?
