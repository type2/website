Subject: Re: Fuel sender removal (splittie)

In a message dated 96-04-27 13:26:21 EDT, you write:

&gt;
&gt;I have determined that the fuel gauge sender on my '64 is busted. I have a 
&gt;spare, but is it neccesary to remove the entire engine and gas tank to
&gt;replace 
&gt;it?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,

Not necessary if you don't mind cutting large holes in the rear floor panel
directly over the sender.  You can patch this with the same piece that you
pulled out minus the area that was cut.  Many times owners of busses can't
afford a &quot;proper repair&quot; and have to resort to this to save money.  If you do
this, remember to paint any exposed metal edges of the repair area to prevent
needless rust.

Tom Fitzpatrick will probably flame me for this, but some folks just consider
these beloved beautiful boxes just &quot;a car&quot;.  Look on the bright side, Tom.
 Your lovingly restored busses will gain slightly in value if Jonny cuts his
bus.  I wouldn't cut my freind for the sake of convenience.  But some would
to save a buck.
