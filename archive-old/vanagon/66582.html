Subject:      Re: Synthetic Oil(s)

Several replies from the list have stated that 5-50 may be a bit high in
the viscosity range 9or is it low???). In other words the flowability rate
is too high, and may cause the motor to react to the varying oil pressure
(???? I think I have this right ????). At any rate I think I am leaning
towards a 20/50 or 20/40. Bentley suggests a 20/50 or 20/40 in mineral
oils. Maybe someone knows if this is different running synth oils.

As for the milage on my Westy, around 7k is correct, on the motor that is.
I bought her about a month and a half ago and she had around 63k original
miles, and 6k on a new motor. I have since put on well over 1k. Apparently,
the original owner blew the motor while not paying attention to the
flashing RED light on the dash (turns out she blew a radiator hose or
something)!!!

Take it easy!

&gt;Chris,
&gt;You asked why I choose 5-50 synthetic oil, understand I'm not an expert
&gt;in anything (well...almost).  My understanding is that the synthetic oils
&gt;have been engineered so well as to give excellent protection in the full
&gt;range, something the mineral oils cannot do. So you have cold start
&gt;capability and protection at any temp. I'm sure one of our many well
&gt;educated list members can give a better explanation and I would like to
&gt;have it laid out in better detail.
&gt;
&gt;Now I'm not trying to be a smart-ass, but do you really have only seven
&gt;thousand miles on your Westy? Please don't be offended if it was a
&gt;mistake, I understand. I make mistakes also. Many of you may remember the
&gt;&quot;bear hand&quot; ordeal I caused!!  : )  : )
