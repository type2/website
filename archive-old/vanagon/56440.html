Subject: Re: business on the list.


&gt; For the last time STOP running a damn business on this list. period.  I do
&gt; not need to hear your daily trials and tribulations about setting up the
&gt; business.  When you have a special offer, like Kyle, post a short note to
&gt; remind us of it and your website.  But cut out this kind of 'feel good'
&gt; message and blatant commercial plugging.  It is pure SPAM, and is not found
&gt; on the other two vehicle lists I subscribe(d) to, notably the Audi and
&gt; Porsche lists.  Tim Smith

Some of us may actually be thrilled that these folks are getting their
business off the ground.  I think it's pretty cool that they're able to
start a business doing what all of us are doing anyway - messing around
with our busses.  If you don't want to hear about it, don't read those
messages.  Maybe they really *are* nice folks; contrary to what you may
think, there are people who get into a business because they like what
they do, and what you call &quot;feel good advertising&quot; is quite possibly just
&quot;being friendly&quot;, something that's becoming increasingly rare in this day
and age.  Unless the word comes down that this type of talk *is*
forbidden on the list (i.e. by someone who has the authority to make such
a ruling) I suggest you stop whining and go back to your Porcshe and Audi
lists where people don't say things which bother you.

- Tom, in an exceptionally cranky mood this morning.
