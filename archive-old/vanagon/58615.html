&lt;&lt; Does anyone know who did Vanagon &quot;Westy-like&quot; conversions that &quot;scissor&quot;
 straight up?  The 86 GL Syncro in question is in the state of Washington.
  &gt;&gt;

ASI (Automotive Services Inc) did a &quot;pop straight up top&quot;, w/ a front luggage
rack like the westy's that stayed fixed to the top.
The interior layout is much similar to the westy layout, but there was
usually always a propane heater too. 
The ASI conversion was out of Vancouver, WA.

p.s. a friend of mine w/ an '80 Vanagon ASI Camper is looking for the whole
poptop section if anyone sees one in a junkyard.  It seems the PO of his van
unintentionally removed the poptop via a parking garage ceiling..... :&lt;(
