&gt;  Joel, you've actually swapped them, right? What did you figger?

well ... cause it seemed like a good idea at the time. :)
actually, i'm wondering if it will make any difference. there was No Clear
Consensus from the list (or anywhere else), so i'm gonna see if they last
another 75,000 miles this way. if they do, it doesn't prove anything. but
if they tear up, i'm sure gonna suspect something!!! :)

i'm thinking that maybe, just maybe, by reversing the axles, that the balls
will move into new wear areas of the races ... and so maybe last longer
(instead of wearing the old paths even deeper). no basis in science or
history supports this claim, however.
