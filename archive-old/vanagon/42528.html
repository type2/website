&gt;&gt; &gt;My Vanagon has developed a leak in the long A/C hoses that run the length
&gt;of
&gt;&gt; &gt;the car.  Has anyone replaced them before?  How long should it take?
&gt;Where
&gt;&gt; &gt;should I get new ones?
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I had to replace one of mine a while back.  I removed the hose and took it
&gt;to
&gt;&gt; a local A/C wholesaler/shop who re-used the ends and made me a &quot;new&quot; hose.
&gt;I
&gt;&gt; don't recall the specifics, but I do remember that it saved me a bundle
&gt;&gt; compared to the dealer price$.  If you're interested in doing this
&gt;&gt; mail-order-style, I could dig out the name/number/address of this Southern
&gt;&gt; California shop.
&gt;
&gt;I just ordered the high pressure hose that runs back to front from
&gt;Camelback in Phoenix.
&gt;
&gt;Part # 253 260 702 C (4270 mm) $278.20
&gt;
&gt;Don't know what the local dealer price is.

Wow!  I think I remember paying less than $50 for the replacement hose I
described above.  I guess I'd forgotten how much money I saved.  BTW, the
hose I had them make up is future-compatible for R-134 if I ever need to use
that stuff.
