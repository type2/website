Subject: Re: Potential Purchase, 88? Vanagon...questions..:)

The year works out to be an 1985. The VIN's tenth place is an &quot;F&quot;. The
first alphabet letter &quot;A&quot; = 0 for 1980, and so on.  The letter &quot;I&quot; and &quot;O&quot;
are not used in the decoding. Also at
http://www.euroselect_dot_com/eu00004.htmfo&gt; You can decipher the Whole VW VIN
if yer really a wantin to no bout yer new van.

Happy shopping

&gt;88 Vanagon, fer 300 bucks...took a look at it, its in damn good
&gt;shape...surface rusted roof (damn hard to wax that beast, i presume..:)
&gt;a ding in the front of the right rear wheelflare...surface rusted there,
&gt;and some seam rust behind the drivers door...
&gt;
&gt;The third-party story that i know on it:  Original owner, boughtit
&gt;fer the wife, she drove it till 6 or more months ago, he was unable to
&gt;stop it from over heating. claims it has a porshe motor (i fell off the
&gt;tire i was sitting on laughin when i heard that one....:)
&gt;Stoped driving, and bought the wife a new minivan...
&gt;
&gt;Interior is basic, rear, middle, fronts...no visible tears or
&gt;anything....grill was off, and in the middel seat...
&gt;
&gt;I looked at the motor....says it was made by VW of Germany...:)
&gt;The case is VERY VERY cleean. Like it had recently  made major work
&gt;done....And never sean the road...
&gt;
&gt;(didnt see engien compartment, this is UNDER the engine....)
&gt;
&gt;Got the engien # for finle confermation thats its VW, not Porshe...025
&gt;101 102
&gt;
&gt;The bus has round headlights, too....if i (sure...:) remember rightly,
&gt;didnt they go square around 86??
&gt;
&gt;SO, i got the VIN to find out hte real year, too...:)   WV2YB0256FH043503
&gt;
&gt;Anyone know how to read one of those???:) (i'm thinking 85....)
&gt;
&gt;Oh, windhsield has a BB gun shot in it...:(right at driver eye
&gt;level..phooie..
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;So....anything anyone wants to tell me is welcome...I'll prolly be
&gt;getting this bus, one way or the other (prolly in exchange for work on a
&gt;friends Things...:)
