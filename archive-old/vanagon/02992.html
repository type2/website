Subject: Re: clutch cable tube woes

&gt;I spent 3 hours trying to get that cable to go.  Even got the vise grips
&gt;on it and tried to hammer it in the hole.  No luck.  The old cable won't
&gt;go either.  The tube is not mashed, and is quite full of grease.\
&gt;
I was stopped at an intersection on cold wintery day when I put my
foot to the clutch and oopps; no return from the pedal.  80$cdn later
I had in my possession a brand new clutch cable.  All that remained
was to install the sucker. 

Now being of sound mind and paranoid disposition there was no way in
hell that I was going to trust the travels of the cable to my not
being able to somehow touch it along the way.  My solution:

Luckily for me the cabble broke at the transmision end and not some
where in the middle.  So what I did was hack off the clip at the 
pedal end and tied a bit of strong string to it.  I then pulled
the old cable out from the tranny end and thus ended with the string 
along the cable travel.  I tied the string at the pedal end to the
end of the cable that would end at the tranny and then proceeded to
both push and pull the cable through the travel greasing all the 
while.  No hitch, no hangup, no nuthin'.  :)
