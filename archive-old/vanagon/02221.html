&gt; They are exempt *once you register them*.  They still must all be smogged
&gt; when you transfer ownership.  This is what the California DMV told me a
&gt; couple of years ago.  It could have changed...

It did change.  When I got my '65 in '90 I had to smog it.  But the '63 
that I just got I didn't.  I just paid them the $10 to transfer the title.
