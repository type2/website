Louise,

We were wonder the same thing. We found an older bus with good jelousy
windows.  I wonder if they would fit into my 84.

&gt; Greetings VolksFolks..........
&gt;
&gt; While sitting inside a very stuffy vanagon during a torrential downpour at
&gt; O'Leno State Park Campout this past weekend, we were trying to determine
&gt; how to improve, increase, or modify ANYTHING to get some ventilation.
&gt;
&gt; Question #1:
&gt; I would be *very* interested to hear what ingenuity the &quot;Royal&quot; and
&gt; &quot;Collective&quot; &quot;We&quot; has invented in that regard.....
&gt;
&gt; and .....
&gt;
&gt; Question #2:
&gt; Dave Easterwood and I were discussing the possibility of manufacturing
&gt; custom jalousied windows for vanagons. Would any of you be interested?
&gt;
&gt; and....
&gt;
&gt; Question #3:
&gt; Has anyone retrofitted the top canvas to reinstate the side triangular
&gt; windows as are in my 72?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks!
&gt;
