&gt;My first posting to this list......
&gt;
&gt;I have an 87 syncro van with approx 125kmi on it.  Initiallly, when I 
&gt;shifted from 3rd to 4th it would pop out of gear once, i would shift it back 
&gt;in gear and continue on.  This condition degraded.  It will not stay in 4th 
&gt;for any period of time.  I need to keep slight pressure on the shift column. 


AAARRRGGGHHH  my worst nightmare, I thought vanagons were immune to this.
You might try Parts Place, Auburn Hills, MI. for a recycled Syncro trans, 
$1000 and up I think the catalogue said, when available, ie. 2-3 times their 
regular trans price. I wouldn't trust the average VW shop to do a good 
enough job. 12/12,000 mile warranty is no damned use if you need a new trans 
every 2 years.

        Since this also happens on loafs does anyone know what is wearing 
out EXACTLY to cause this problem, linkage, selector fork, synchronisers, 
gear teeth what?

My bottom line on this would be the same as Steve Mahers  &quot;Bungee Bus&quot; &lt;g&gt;

bungee math:  If a bungee cord costs $1.49 and a Syncro trans costs $1800.00
              How many bungee cords would you buy instead of the trans?


Answer: just one! unless you are into bungee bondage :&gt;
