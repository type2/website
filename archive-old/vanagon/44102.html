Subject: FS: '82 Diesel Engine

Recently rebuilt.  All diesel parts included.
Asking $500, but I don't really know what it's worth, so I could get took,
or I may have to lower the price.  If you know and aren't interested in
buying, let me know. :-)
The engine had about 82,000 miles on it before the rebuild.  It was
rebuilt by a reputable local shop (not by me).

email me!
