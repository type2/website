Subject:  Change the stats


Joel--  Need to change the stats.  Traded Stella (93 EV) for an
as-yet-to-be-named 95 EV Camper.  Autohaus in Lancaster, PA claims to be the
East Coast leader in EV Camper sales and they really seem to like handling
busses.  They gave me a real good price on the trade.  They also said that
only a handful (couple hundred?) 96 EVs will be imported and they
would go to sales reps, etc and not go on sale.  They also say that there
are still plenty of the 95 Campers.
