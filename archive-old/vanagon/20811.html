&gt;PS I'm also curious about the Turbo Diesel. Please tell me some more.
&gt;Are they very common in Germany? Did they sell the non-Turbo diesel

Shipping of a regular car (S.F. - german port) is $ 1200 minimum (including
handling and insurance), but don't ask me about a VW Camper, might be more
expensive due to height. The car needs some technical changes and tests
befor it will pass the required technical instection (TUV) required for
registation:

(1) new set of headlights (the US close sealed headlights are not legal in
Germany), which is $$$;
(2) Check - and maybe replacement of the propane tank to meet German
standards, and pressure check of the complete system with attached components;
(3) emmission check;
(4) some other things that I am not aware of;

and - for your own convenience

(5) change the electrical hookup system to german plugs (or use adapters)
and all electric applications to 220V/50Hz (or use power converter).

The only advantage that I see is that most Vanagons in Germany older than 10
years will be severly damaged by rust; while your '82 is (hopefully)
basically rust-free!

I am - way back in my mind - thinking of doing the same thing in two years
or so, however, I will first start a survey on conditions and prices of
comparable Vans in Germany, and do some $$$ calculations.
