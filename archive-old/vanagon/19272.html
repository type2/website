Driving some 2 lane blacktop today in the G60 and
passed 2 Buses, 1 split (real rare bout here) and
one '7? Westy,  flashed em and waved at both and
happily got similar responses, (pretty odd when
I'm in the Corrado), passed a nice blue EV (rarer than
the Buses almost bout here) and did the same and the
people just looked at me like I was crazy, sigh...
Like the Corrado they just don't seem to be for real
VW people.

an excellent canoe adventure, her first real trip since I
got her, saw 5-6 Buses and Vanagons, she ran like a top),
