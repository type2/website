Subject: RE: engine sling for '80 V6anagon?


&gt;I would get another 4x6 so I could run them across the van, fully supported
&gt;by the metal in front and back of the engine hatch.  Then put 4x6 across
&gt;them.  This would distribute the weight so that no particular spot got
&gt;dented.  Having said that, I wouldn't worry too much.  You'll have a static
&gt;load, much less than the instanteous dynamic loads of a heavy item bouncing
&gt;up and down when the van is on the road.

Sorry, Bill et. al., I left out some detail in the interests of brevity
(who, me?).

The &quot;spacer blocks&quot; I mentioned in the original post, are for that exact
purpose. Partly to distribute the weight, and partly to help the hoist clear
the distributor, which I'd rather not move. I already plan to remove the
carb, which sticks up even further.


&gt;Good luck.  Sure you don't want to check out the V-8 while the engine
&gt;compartment is empty?

No thanks-- mail box is full enough already.   ;-)

More seriously, even if a V8 fit, it would only give me the means to get
myself into big trouble. The V6anagon keeps up with most traffic quite
well (even without a clutch  :-O  ), which is plenty zippy enough for me.
Also, my next $1,500 is earmarked for Uncle Sam in about six days. It's
the American Way.
