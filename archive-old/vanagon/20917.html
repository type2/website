Subject: Ear Gas...

Oh yeah, I forgot to mention this earlier, whilst pulling the engine out
of Foo (and draining all the gas out of the tank through my nifty
all brass/stainless steel stopcock valve) I had to cut the gas line(they're
all being replaced).  Note well: There still could be residual gas in these
lines.  There was in mine.  As I cut, gas started coming out and I turned
to avoid getting it in my eyes.  It went into my ear instead. Man did this
hurt.  Massive ear ache for about 2 hrs.  I used a diluted solution of 
hand cleaner/distilled water to flush it out. Its been two days and I've
been wandering around south Boston.  Just kidding, careful with the GAS!
