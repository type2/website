&gt;Sorry guys, all I can say is that the graveyard is located in Michigan's
&gt;upper peninsula. 
&gt;                                                     Later,
&gt;                                                          Eric
&gt;

No problem, that's all the info we'll need.  Anyone in the mood for buzzing
over some farms in Michigan?  You supply the plane body, I'll supply the
engine out of my bus.
