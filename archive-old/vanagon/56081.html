Sorry, that's not $55, it's DM 55 which will be $34. And this is only
an expected price. I paid this three years ago for two plates when I
moved from southern to western Germany.

I have been wanting for some time to put a German plate
on the front on my VW Camper(in Florida we only have to have plates on
the back).  Do you know any where I could get a used original one that
is the horizontal kind.  I do not want a personalized one, just an
original.  Helmut in Germany said he could get me one for $55 including
shipping.  Thanks a lot.  Have a great weekend.
