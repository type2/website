Vanamongers:

Just replaced the original shocks with a Monroe product called the 
&quot;Trailbuster Gas LT&quot;  I am finding them to be more of a &quot;buttbuster&quot; 
becauce they do offer a nice firm ride.  All in all though, I am very 
impressed with this product.  Highway control is improved 110%, as is 
braking control.  I no longer float between lanes.  

For those of you in the NW states, Les Schwab is offering these at 
$27/shock, or $35/shock installed, Lifetime Warranty.  For those of you 
familiar with the Gabriel shock, these seem to be a bit heavier-duty and 
a bit of a firmer ride.  

I'll keep you posted on long-term results.

Jon
