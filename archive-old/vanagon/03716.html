&gt; 
&gt; Matthew Drahzal,
&gt; 
&gt; Watertown, WI?
&gt; 
&gt; 
Naah, watertown, NY. Home of the US Army's winter playland, Fort Drum.

This reminds me, I have been getting swamped with messages (especially
from the list)  When I know a person's email address, I take some
conversations off-line...Since I wanna keep the list traffic manageable
and topical. So I would like to propose that we ALL include our email
addresses as part of our .sigs.  

 Please also remember:

  &quot;Think before you cross...at CORNERS of course!&quot;
