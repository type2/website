Subject: ??? Time for Head gasket  ?????

Is it time????  84 gl 1.9

1.  Over flow tank is over flowing.   Coolent system Bleed numerous     
times.  Bars leak added. New expansion tank cap. 

2.  Over heats and spews coolent at idel after highway running.

I do enjoy spewing VW juice all over the  wind shield of tail gaters.

Questions

1.  Would you fix only the head that is leaking?????  One now the
other     later.  

2.  Can a mechanically inclined person do it himself.  I get some    
personal satisfaction of doing my own work.  I really don't trust    
the shop to do the work right. To many horrior storys from the list.

3.   Are Special tools needed.  VW Tools.

4.   What are the odds of getting it right?????????

5.   What is the average cost to have it done??

6.   What do the Parts cost?

I would like to talk to a do it your-selfer.  Please contact me.
