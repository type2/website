Subject: '71 windshield wipers


Hello All, this is my first vanagon list post, so I hope it is appropriate...

I've got a '71 bus with a rapidly dying windshield wiper motor. I've rebuilt
bug wiper motors before, but I have not yet removed one from a bus, and
I hear that they are a pain to get out. any suggestions? The closest 
thing to Maryland's rainy season has arrived...

                                      `MNot'-
