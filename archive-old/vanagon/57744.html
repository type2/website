Subject: Re: AC Question

I can verify that on my 87, when the AC gets low on freon pressure, the
compressor doesn't kick in at all.

&gt;no evidence of either a high or low pressure switch. It would be a very
&gt;simple mater to attach gauges and verify.

&gt;&gt; My mechanic tells me that if I had no freon, my compressor would not  
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;kick in and that there might be something else wrong with my

&gt;&gt;Can anyone shed some light?
