Subject: RE: aux oil cooler as heater core?

Rodney asks if an oil cooler could be an aircooled bus' heat source.  Yes.
Pump would need to be strong, hydraulic pressure high but not in the
scary range.  There are some problems.  

My Vgon, w/Porsche six, has an aux oil cooler in front, behind the grill,
just beyond the &quot;fire&quot;wall from the passenger's feet.  It gets up to about
180oF. winter or summer, but takes a long time in the winter.  Porsche engine
has two-stage pump, so the stage that moves oil to the front of the car and
back is different from the stage that moves pressurized oil through the
engine.  With a single stage pump, you would probably not want such a long
hose-run to the cooler.  If you put the cooler inside, you would need to
move it outside for hot days.  You could not in any case turn it off, unless
you had it set up as an auxiliary auxiliary oil cooler, with a shunt to
divert flow to the indoor oil cooler only in cold weather.

Note also that most of the heat from an aircooled engine is lost under the
car and is not available from the oil.  Most of the heat from a watercooled
engine IS available from its coolant fluid.

There are kits to move the oil cooler of a VW bug inside the cabin, but this
requires engine R&amp;R twice a year (in most climes) to switch the site of the
cooler.

I think VW and Porsche assessed all this as lots of trouble for little 
additional gain, especially as their analysis had to do with the capabilities
of new cars with rustfree, tightly sealed heating systems, not the 10-40
year old machines we are trying to convince ourselves can still be used
daily.
