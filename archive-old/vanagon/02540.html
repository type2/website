(ooops - sorry if you are 'matthew', but my brother uses matt
so that's my excuse...)

was $700 the dealer-damage for a fuel tank? did you get any action
from alt.sources??

hope you fixed your leak - regarding the hoses - i just did them all with
Tygon tubing which i scarfed from work - i made them long enough to push the tank up after hooking up. I recall (two years ago) that getting the hoses 
to not hang up wwas a pain in the a**. I think the filler pipe 
isnt too bad - i seem to recall getting the tank up and bolted in, then
slipping the tube in through the hole in the frame member

if this doesnt make any sense then it probably is nonsense ....
after all
