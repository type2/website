 &gt; Find the fuse that is on when the key is in the cranking and running

Actually, it's a Real Good Idea to run the wire through a switch actuated by 
oil pressure that's bypassed when the engine is cranking.  That way you get 
gas right away when you start the engine, but if you are in an accident and 
the engine stalls, the fuel flow will be cut off and not pump raw gas into a 
perhaps burning engine compartment.

I did this on my Triumph TR6 when I installed an electric fuel pump.  I got 
the switch from a mail-order place called Pegasus Racing for less then $10.  
J.C. Whitney has them too.
