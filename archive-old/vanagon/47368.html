Subject: More horse power from the 2.1??

Hello List
  While I like the idea of more power in my vanagon, I want to keep it all
VW.  I would like to find some information on how to upgrade the 2.1.  I've
posted before on turbo or supercharging the 2.1, has anyone found any more
info on this idea?  Forced induction seems to be a good answer for the lack
of power at the mid and top end of the vans performance.  If anyone has any
ideas on forced induction or sources of information please e-mail me
TIA
