Subject: More Diesel stories cont....

I bought a 82 in April that needed a new engine.  I bought the engine 
from Tom Noble.  He has quite a reputation around here in WA, as a high 
quality engine builder.  It came with a six month, six K. warranty.

Guess what happend at 7 months?

Oil pump failure.  which melted the #1 rod bearing, which caused the #1 
piston to flop around in the cylinder, which aslo made contact with the 
valves.  I was all prepared to do battle with Tom, but on my initial call 
he said he would take care of it.  WOW!  more later.

                               Later,
                                    Brad
