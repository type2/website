&gt; Pizza?  Camping?

Hi Tobin.  You don't have to twist my arm too hard for an excuse to 
go camping :)  A good idea, how many of us live around here anyway?

&gt; I was thinking a camping trip up near Pemberton (for those of us with 
&gt; ground clearance.... Harry?), along the Duffey Lake Rd btw Pemberton and 
&gt; Lillooet, or (bringing the WA people into the game here) at,say, 
&gt; Deception Pass park on Whidbey I.?

No problem here.  Pemberton way is a great choice.  My wife is a bit 
of a stickler for restrooms though.  We'll have to plan accordingly.  
We've done all 3 roads behind Pemberton to Lillooet in years past, 
and it's very pretty.  Even Whidbey Island is OK.  Camped there many 
times before.

&gt; Pizza anytime, but I was thinking of a short (2 night? 1 night even, for 
&gt; the first time?) camping trip in late may or anytime this summer.  Can't 
&gt; be too soon, as I've got to get rid of my harmonic (demonic?) noise and 
&gt; do my rear brakes before cruising off anywhere.

I wouldn't want to do the Pemberton thing in May as snow is a real 
possibilty.  I work shifts, and I also work one Saturday every four 
weeks.  A little advance planning would be appreciated for me.  

Great idea, Tobin.  :)

How about Manning Park?
Cheers
Harry.
