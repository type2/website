Subject: Keeping it cool, simple

Problem: Family going camping in East Texas over July 4th in '73 Campmobile 
wants to keep from melting during sleeptime at night.  Lots of pressure for 
cool air on bus owner by family members.

Solution: Purchased a used 5000 btu window unit air conditioner ($95), built 
small box which is duct-taped to cool air vent on a/c unit.  Took 2 dryer 
vent hoses and using proper sized pinapple cans with both ends cut out, 
duct-taped the hose/can assembly to the box unit on the a/c.  Ran dryer 
hoses into side vent window opening of bus, using cardboard (or 1/4&quot; 
plywood) cut to fit and seal vent window openings, with holes to fit dryer 
hoses.  Everybody cool and happy!

Ok, so it's not high-tech.  I figure all I have to do is pump some cool air 
in the van (it's not that big) and keep people cool so they can sleep well 
at night.  It did work really well.  The negatives are 1) you have to haul 
all the stuff, 2) you need to find a lower fan/thermostat setting that will 
keep the van cool but not freeze you out.  Keep in mind that the thermostat 
really doesn't know what the temp in the van is - you could put a probe 
inside, but I didn't go to the trouble.  The positives are 1) it didn't cost 
very much, 2) it was kind of fun to do, 3) it makes summer trips in the bus 
bearable 'cause sleeping with all the screens open, top popped, and even the 
screen installed in back (with fans) is not cool enough!
