Subject: 78 Oil Burning?

My 77 Westy, with a 78 engine in it, seems to be burning oil. At least
that's what I suspect. On start up quite a bit of white smoke comes out,
until the engines warm. I just fixed an oil leak from the valve cover so
I'm going to see how much the oil is going down now. Compression is 120
across the board...What should I be look for? What are the possibilities
and repairs involved?

I'd like to take care of this soon, as I'll be taking a cross country trip
this summer and don't want to add a quart every 100miles. One more silly
question, what is the general concensus of oil to use, I live in SAn
Francisco where the weather is usually between60-70degrees.  Thanks alot!

&quot;I'm fine thanks, who are you?&quot;
&quot;I'm fine too, but you no get in without the password&quot;
