ja_at_decws3.coe.wvu_dot_edu (John Anderson):
 
&gt; The only critical thing is to bleed the radiator, this should
&gt; solve your problems, pull the grill, it should be obvious how,
&gt; 1/4 twist screws I think. lool on one side on top for larke
&gt; bleeder valve, looks like a tire valve but big, like an A/C fill
&gt; valve, press till H20 appears, problem solved. If you need manual
&gt; pages email me direct with fax no.

I have a hissing/gurgeling sound from the heater when I accelerate, and 
a pretty bad heat output, so I thought it may be an air bubble. Keeping the 
coolant tank well filled has not solved the problem.
 
How can I bleed the heater core in a 82 vanagon (diesel)? Preferrably without 
having to dissassemble the whole front! (Remembering when I replaced the
blower, took several hours to do...)

Alternatively, is there a way to avoid air bubbles when you fill the system?

I consult a Bentley's Golf/Jetta diesel manual, and Haynes air cooled
vanagon for my repairs, but of course for this problem they don't help me.

Thanks,
Martin
