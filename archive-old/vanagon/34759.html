Subject: Re: List Sticker Update


&gt;&gt;  Also, for those of you who haven't ordered, there are PLENTY left. Only
&gt;&gt;about
&gt;&gt;50 people have ordered, which is less than 10% of the list membership.
&gt;
&gt;Allright, I've decieded I need a few (5) of these!  I'll put my check (&amp;
&gt;SASE) in the mail this week.  I will gladly take the other 295 off your 
hands
&gt;just as soon as I buy 299 more vw's!


Yeah!

(When I was 5, my parents wouldn't let me say that. Now that I'm all
growed up, I can.)

Come on, you California volksmeisters! I've been good, I've ordered mine.
So, you too! Put down those margaritas and grab your pencils. I want to
see LOTS of those things next time I hit the road!

Which, with my present obnoxious attitude, probably won't be long.  :)
