&gt;&gt; Just curious, but about how much does a compression tester cost?

Anywhere from about $10 for a cheapo FLAPS one to $200 for the Snap-On all 
singing all dancing one.  I got a mildly fancy one from AutoParts Club for 
about $50 that I'm quite happy with.  It *screws* into the spark plug holes 
and has a flexible tube and various adapters so you can test your lawnmower, 
chainsaw or motorcycle.

I stongly disrecommend the cheap ones that have a rubber plug you press into 
the spark plug hole; I always hurt myself using one and I don't trust them to 
be accurate; it's really easy to hold them off-axis and have them leak when 
you are trying to avoid getting caught in the fan belts.
