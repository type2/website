&gt; I want to pull the heads on a Type IV 1700 soon. As soon as I've clocked
&gt; 10000 km (6000 mi for the metrically challenged :-). Just to have a look-see.
&gt; So - do I need to replace those little aluminum or whatever seals between the
&gt; top of the cylinder and the head? Or can I use Injun head on it? Or something
&gt; else? 

I don't know if you are &quot;supposed&quot; to re-use those aluminum rings, but I
wouldn't have a problem with re-using them on *my* engine.  Since nobody
answered your question, I doubt I will get flamed for saying this.
Don't use any kind of sealant with those rings.  Just clean them real
well and put them back.  And what the heck is &quot;Injun head&quot;?
