&gt; Why no more &lt;f&gt; posts from Will Self? No more adventures of Willy and
&gt; von Wokker? No more &quot;altered&quot; poetry and songs?
&gt; Are we not worthy? Are Internet censors at work? Are Fridays being abolished?

There comes a time, in the lives of all Academics, that the heavy mantle of
Scholastic Responsibility can be lifted from those broad shoulders of the
Educationally Empowered, and can be laid to rest for yet one more season of
Summer and Solace.

It is undoubtedly to this far, far better place and time that our dear
departed friend and contributor, Will &quot;Bill the Bard&quot; Self, has now gone.
We will, of course, miss him very much. But we can all take comfort in the
sure and certain knowledge that when the swallows come back to Capistrano,
and the autumn leaves have turned to brown, so too must the dreary, mocking
hordes of youthful vermin return to the Hallowed Halls of High Hopes,
pretending to seek out that Knowledge of Life and Universe, and that once
again, those responsible Men and Women who protect Society from those that
only Spend and Wait, those Educators par Excellence, will be there to ensure
adherence to the grade curve.

Fridays will continue. They will not be the same, until the days of Summer
begin to wane, and the call of the loon is once again heard on the lake.
Those of us left to carry the Burdens of Banter will shoulder on as best we
are able, straining under the Summer Heat and Humidity, pleading for a drink
from the Cup of Inspiration, a drop or two from the Fountain of Knowledge.

Yes, Friends, it is to this End that we must Re-Dedicate our efforts and all
our Strength and Purpose!  We must never forget that Friday is the End of the
Week!  And we shall never let the memory of Will &quot;Who, me?&quot; Self be diminished
by the Ravages of Time and Space, even though the rat bastard ran off and left
us.

&gt;  Please, Will, please - My friends will all drop me like a moldy sandwich if
&gt;  I don't forward your creativity and sense of humor to them every Friday.

so what am i? chopped liver???   sheesh!!
