Subject:      Re: seeping from core flange

In response to leaking heater core:
    The connection to the heater core is very fragile.
I have seen them break right off, if one tries to tighten them too much.
If someone breaks it, it is better if the dealer does it. At least, they
will have to replace it for free.
    I replaced my plastic heater core under the back seat with an
old-fashioned metal heat exchanger. I put in a stainless steel/brass
ball valve from the hardware store. No more drips.

&gt;
&gt; After having the VW dealer pressure check my cooling system, a leak was
&gt; found in the rear heater core.  The rear heater valve was reported to be
&gt; leak free.  I then had the core replaced with original VW unit along with
&gt; new o-ring, a slight seep (about 1 drip per 5 minutes) is leaking out of
the
&gt; flange that connects the core intake to the valve assembly.  It is
fastened
&gt; with 2 hexhead screws.  Should I march it back to the service center or
try
&gt; to tighten the screws another 1/4 turn.  If the verdict is to tighten,
how
&gt; much force should I apply?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks
