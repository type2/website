Subject: vendor results, and ordering an engine

A few days ago, I asked for comments about engines and transmissions
from MoFoCo, Pro-Tech, So-Cal Imports, and Scat Enterprises.  The
answers came out as:

MoFoCo: Flaky on pricing; rebuilt parts aren't; poor labour (one
person mentioned finding blasting sand in a frontend).  Things
supposed to be new usually are, but sometimes aren't (particularly for
parts you won't necessarily see, such as the valves inside of
assembled heads).  The complaints were less serious than those about
GEX.

Pro-Tech: no information.  They advertise turn-key engines for about
what other people charge for long blocks.  This implies some
questionable rebuilding techniques.

So-Cal Imports:  One positive comment, no other direct commentary.
Their ads leave me with many questions (``machining required on some
kits'' seemed a little odd).  They're really big on getting back
rebuildable cores, and don't give any mention of what their core
charges are.

Scat Enterprises:  Apparently this is the Scat that has been doing
performance parts for quite a while.  Several general positive
comments, nothing specific about their engines.

On the transmission discussion, the overwhelming answer was to go to
Carter's Gear Box.

I ended up ordering a long block from Scat.  The salesguy was very
knowledgeable, and even helped me figure out why I know nothing about
thermostats.  Apparently there are some after-market cooling shrouds
that don't have mounts for such things, and that's what I've got.  He
was also a good salesman -- I ended up ordering several additional
things that would be nice, but not strictly necessary.  No, I'm not
upset about this.
