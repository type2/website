Subject:       Blowing coolant hoses.

Forgive me if this has been covered-- i'm back on digest.

Not to be a doomsayer, BUT i fear the person with coolant hoses 
blowing out is getting combustion pressure into the cooling system 
and popping 'em off.  been there, done that in a rabbit diesel.

head gaskets would be the likely culprit. sorry.
