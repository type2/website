Subject: re:'78 a/c

Sean,

To put the belt on for the A/C you would need to remove the fan housing,
and the fan(I am assuming that the pulley is between the fan and the
case).  I haven't figured out how to remove the fan, and housing without
dropping the engine, but it has been said that it can be done.

BTW if anyone out there knows how to remove the fan housing without
dropping the engine, I would appreciate the info

Thanks

David

Hey all,
        I now call on the expertise of those who have breadloaf buses
        with air conditioning.  On my '78, the compressor is not
        currently hooked up, i.e. no belt.  However, by looking at the
        thing I can't tell for sh*t how to hook the darn thing up.
        There is nothing in the owner's manual about it.  I can see the
        pully on the compressor but I can't see how to get it over to
        the crankshaft pulley.  Can someone please tell me how to hook
        it up?  This one's got me stumped.  Thanks.  Also, where can I
        get a proper belt for this?  Is it the same one for the
        alternator or is it different?

        Things I did today:
        fixed fresh air flaps (PO duct-taped them closed for winter).
        aimed driver's side headlight
        visited FLAPS for parts


        Things to do tomorrow:
        tune-up, spark plugs, rotor, dist. cap, spark plug wires.
        get some spare hardware to tighten a couple things up.
        clean up accelerator return spring, thing sticks at high idle
        because spring is not returning pedal all the way -- maybe
        grease cable but that will have to wait.

        try and figure out what's wrong with speedomoeter
        adjust rear brakes.

        That's not too much ;) .  Anyway, driving home, the bus
        performed very well, I was impressed.  Plenty of pep on the
        highway, actually left the right lane every now and then :) .  I
        really REALLY dig this bus!!!!!!!!

        Take it easy,
        Sean
