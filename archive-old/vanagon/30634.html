&gt;Wet and windy in the San Francisco Bay area, with a leaky Patio cover roof
&gt;(again for 10 yrs in a row), walting for a brief break in the weather to try
&gt;and stop the leak again. . . . .
&gt;Harvey
&gt;
&gt;  &quot;AARRRGGHHHH!&quot;

Ain't this just the worst winter you ever seen?  Been raining solid since
Sunday!!  Think I'll move back to San Diego.  (teehee)
