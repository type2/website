Subject: need advice; transplant into '82 diesel


While looking for the '87 syncro yesterday, I made a u-turn after going 
the wrong way and just happened to see an '82 westy diesel.  I talked to 
the owner for a little while, and it turns out that he's only the second 
owner.  The diesel had been rebuilt by the first owner, but some bolt was 
left a bit loose leading to a crack in the camshaft.

Anyway, the interior is in great shape, and the body is almost rust 
free.  So, after skimming many posts about transplants, I'm looking for 
list wisdom about what engines can easily be dropped into the '82 
diesel.  This vanagon is certainly a prime candidate for this operation.
If you have any sense of the cost involved in getting another engine, 
that would be helpful too.

Thanks for the help.
