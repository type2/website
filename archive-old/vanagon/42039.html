&gt;problems.Also, he's quite sure it has locking diffs.It's hard for me to
figure out the
&gt;value of this. I enlist the opinion of you synchro people out there.
&gt;PLEASE !! Does it seem worth it? 

If this van is in good shape, this is a great price.  Have the van checked
out and snap it up if the checkout confirms no major problems.  If it has a
locking rear differential there will be a little control panel for the rear
diff located below the radio.  The control panel has a little &quot;picture&quot; of a
drivetrain w/ 4 wheels, 3 knob positions, and the rightmost knob installed.

Good luck,
