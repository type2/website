&gt;..but you may be able to use the original little slope-adapter.
&gt;it is a separate peice from the antenna. i put a powered antenna on my 88
&gt;bus and just used the original slope-adapter, instead of the one i paid
&gt;extra for. :(

Sorry to hear about that. 

&gt;the best way (imho) to get to the antenna bottom is to remove the headlight
&gt;grill and the left/driver headlight fixture (the four corner screws). the
&gt;antenna is right behind it.
&gt;joel

 In my case, all I have to do is remove the front grill and there is the
whole assembly. I do appreciate the information. Thanks!
