Hey all,
I just got back tonight from Thanksgiving break.  I left Tuesday
afternoon and came back tonight, Sunday night.  Going down I ran into a
lot of rain/wind, had a headwind most of the way down I think, had some
times where I couldn't get the '81 to go 55 on a flat stretch of road.
Windy.  Got about 16.2 mpg on the way down, but on the way back tonight
I got 18mpg!!  Only thing I can figure is a nice tailwind.  Some places
I was even able to hold 65mph uphill :) .  

Over the break I got a lot done.  I changed the oil and filter,
installed a new thermostat (adjusted too), removed the spare engine from
the cargo area (that wasn't as hard as I thought it would be), cleaned
up the bus a bit, got some camping gear, checked the idle speed and
timing, found the timing to be too retarded by 3.5 degrees, so I reset
it to 7.5 deg BTDC like it's supposed to be, listened for pinging and
found none, etc.  That helped out with the power a bit.

Had a great Thanksgiving, lots of turkey and then some more turkey the
next day :) .

Take care everybody,
Sean
