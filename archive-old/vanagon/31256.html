Propane is in the liquid state in the tank, at something like 125 PSI- 
depending on pressure.  The liquid is pumped in, and a vapor space is left  
at the top of the tank to avoid hydrostatic lock during the expansion due to 
temp differential.  (an aside:  while attending Cal Poly SLO, I took a 
welding class; as part of the tank safety portion of the class, we were 
shown an overhead picture of a propane powered pickup, bed mounted tanks, 
which had been filled in the cool (50's? 60's?) Bakersfield Ca morning.  The 
tanks may have been &quot;stuffed&quot; (overfilled) to get all that could fit inside 
them....after which the truck was driven a short distance, and parked.  In 
the sun. (100's?)  It became apparent that the safety valve had failed shut 
when the tanks ruptured, and exploded with sufficient force to wrap the side 
panels of the pickup bed around the front of the cab.  I was particulary 
interested because I had (and have) a propane powered pickup.)

Float gauges can be purchased that fit into the unused bosses on the tank; 
availible from the tank manufacturer, hopefully this is 
Manchester....because I happen to have the 800 number for them, since I am 
trying to get my very own gauge.  Although I am most familiar with the float 
style, Manchester seems intent on selling me some sort of external gauge 
thingie that magically detects the presence of the essence, the &quot;soul&quot; of 
the departed carbon based life-forms that gave it all for our hydro-carbon 
based lifestyle, or something like that.  Cost: $5.00 (five)   So far,. I am 
skeptical...._dot_call 800 844-8265, x168, will get you Vikkie, who has been 
helping me out with this.....

YMMV.  Let me know if I can help......

Westie Propane Gauge?
Has anyone figured out a good gauge system for determining how much propane 
is
in the tank?
