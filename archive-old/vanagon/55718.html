Subject: I'm back!!! (long)

Hey there fellow VW van owners! Just thought I'd drop a note mentioning my
happiness at being back on the listserv and in the presence of some old
friends! I took a little break back in May when school got out, and last
sememster barely allowed me anytime to study, much less keep up on life in
the outside world. Am I glad that's changed. 
For those of you who are new or don't remember me, my name is Jason Wilson
and I'm a student at California Lutheran University in southern
California. When I'm not driving my girlfriend's Honda Accord (now talk
about a hung 4-banger! Like an elephant baby!!!) I'm driving much closer
to the legal speed limit, if not a little below in my beautiful, but
dinged up because it was that way when I bought it, 1969 VW Camper Bus,
but not a poptop (that was for the stats...) Inside is a beautiful Westy
package. Props to you guys here for some help ID'ing it last year. It's
gotten quite a few miles on it in the past 8 months. A few camping trips,
but mostly San Jose to Thousand Oaks (home to school). Over the summer was
my fun however when the fingers that hold the throwout bearing in place on
the tranny splines decided to break of. Let's just say it was one unhappy
VW owner nursing his baby back home from work. While the engine was out
she got a nice degreasing action that was duely appreciated, and a new
clutch, which was the cause of the aforementioned breakage. Also, a new
oiler cooler with those flat gaskets, which seem to me an obvious
improvement, made it's way onto my beasts motor. Other than that, my baby
is running fine. Looking to do some more camping. (nudge, nudge, wink,
wink, know what I mean...) Hi to all and good cheer!

-Jason
