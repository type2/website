So Brian Downing says:

&gt; does not the part the make a four wire relay and the relay i have is 9 
&gt; wires some one trold me it is beacause the brakes were in the realy 
&gt; before and they are not any more well i would love to get a 9 wire 
&gt; flasher any one have any ideas where i can get one
&gt; 

Welcome to the list Brian.

You should be able to get the appropriate relay replacement at any
European auto store in your area.  Other than that, you could go
to your local wrecking yard that carries VWs and snag one off a
dead bus.

Hope this helps,

Steven
