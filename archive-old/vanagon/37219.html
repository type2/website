Subject: Re: oil burning on new engine

H there.  When our van was new, it went through oil at an alarming 
rate.. ie. 1 litre in 700 km!! It levelled off at 1 litre per 2500 km 
by the time we had 12000 km on the clock.  It stayed at that 
consumption rate until it reached over 70000 km, and we now get about 
6000km per litre.  I can't explain this phenomenon, but I'm happy 
with it.  Our van isn't used in town, and is used for highway travel 
only... with lots of mountain passes to climb.  I have used Castrol 
XLR or GTX 20W-50 oil since the first oil change at 1000 km.

Hope this help,
Harry.

&gt; rcooled westfalia.  On a Baja trip we clogged our catalytic
&gt; converter and did seriuos damage to our engine.  Instead of a rebuild we
&gt; spent the extra dough for a brand new VW engine.  Our Mechanic bought it from
&gt; GOLDEN GATE VOLKSWAGEN in Daly City, CA.  
&gt; 
&gt; This new engine is now burning oil at the rate of at least 1 quart per 1000
&gt; miles.  In the last 400 miles it burned 3/4 quart.  Nick Fernandez at Golden
&gt; Gate VW maintains that this is &quot;normal&quot;.  I don't agree with Nick.
&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone have any official info on oil consumption?  Has anyone had this
&gt; experience? Any advice on how to get results from VW?
