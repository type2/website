&gt;What have been your experiences?  If I use a stock muffler will I be 
&gt;able to put my stock tow bar on?

martin... I have had several types of mufflers on my '71 Westy,  but I
believe that the stock Bug mufflers work best for quietness.  As far as the
tow bar thing,  I couldn't tell you, but again for quietness the Bug muffler
is superior.  BTW,  use the Bug tailpipes as well,  i think they look much
better thasn the utilitarian Bus tailpipes.  Goodluck.  Oh and also,  spend
the extra money on the German Muffler, and not the Brazillian or whereever
they come from i have used both and the German mufflers are far better
quality and they will outlast the others two-fold.
