Subject: '87 Westy Head Leaking ?
Date: Tue, 9 Jan 1996 19:06:09 -0500 (EST)

I think I have finally gotten bit by the dreaded waterboxer head leak. 
There has been loss of antifreeze lately, not much, about a quart in two
to three weeks.  I have noticed that there seems to be some indication of
antifreeze drops showing up on the right hand side of the engine at the
most forward part of where the head and cylinder shrouding meet underneath. 
Just below where there is a water hose connection to the motor.  The hose nor
the connection seem to be at fault although at the -25 C temperatures
lately and no garage I have not been able to really dig in there for a good
look see.  The odometer is showing 188km, why would it have shown up this
late in its life ?  Have others experieced the head leak at this milage ? 
Doesn't it &quot;usually&quot; occur sooner ?  Has any one been successful in getting
VW to do something about this problem with this many miles on the vehicle ?
Has any one in Canada ever been successful in getiing VW Canada to do
something about this problem at all ?  If so could you give me some clues
as to who I should contact.  Thanks in advance for any insight into this
problem.

Cheers

Frank
