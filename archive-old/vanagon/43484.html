Subject:  FLAPS meaning 

&gt;Welcome to the list! FLAPS stands for &quot;Friendly Local Auto Parts Store&quot;. I
&gt;emphasize &quot;Friendly&quot;, cause I guess in some instances you might come across
&gt;the SLAPS (Stupid) and the HLAPS (Hostile) as has been evidenced by some
&gt;recent postings (would you like fries with that spark plug?). Here's hoping
&gt;that we listers help to continue the evolutionary progression of the rare
&gt;FLAPS species!

Jeez! For over a year I've always thought that FLAPS was some VW
specific parts chain that was everywhere in the States, and nowhere in 
Canada! I kept thinking how can a VW specific chain be so wide spread, and
survive. There can't be that many old bugs around. It seemed like
every town of over 500pop had one!
