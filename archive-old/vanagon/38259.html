Subject: [Westy]&amp;[Gen. Bus]A couple of questions....

1.  Is there a manual out there which details trouble shooting and
installing of Westy accessories?  (i.e. freezer, etc)

2.      Where does one get things like replacement cots and child hammocks
and such (besides junkyards and places like that)

3.      I just pried the hubcaps off of the '690 Westy I am restoring and
all four of them had a heavy black soot just CAKED inside of them.  Does
this tell anybody something about my suspensions/brakes/etc?  or is it just
because the DPO was a pig and never cleaned?

Thanks
