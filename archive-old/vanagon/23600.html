Subject: Re: St Muir, worth anything (literally)

John,

I thought they Idiots manual was supposed to be passed on to the next
owner. Every VW I've owned came with one...and I've always passed one on 
to the next buyer. 

Yes, they're crazy. Offer the $5 or wait for the garage sale edition.
IMHO. Joe

&gt;      Anyway the point is, I'm rifling through the used
&gt; book store where I picked up my mint Bentley late Bug manual
&gt; for $2.50 and just in is a pretty old St. Muir, 1970 to
&gt; be exact, not the first but early on all the same I guess.
&gt; Origional price on the bumper is $5.50, I figure hell, be
&gt; good to assimilate the information for entertainment if nothing
&gt; else, even though this early one don't even dream about Type IV
&gt; engines, so I open it up !!!! $20 !!!!! they want, I'm like
&gt; hell I can buy the current one for that.  And it's not in
&gt; perfect shape, complete and clean but a bunch of staples
&gt; through the cover, and valve gaps written inside the back.
&gt;     Are they NUTS? do these things have any value?, would
&gt; offering $5 for it be insulting?, I asked the lady and she
&gt; says, well I don't price em this other lady does, and it
&gt; might be collectible, and blah, blah, blah.
&gt;
