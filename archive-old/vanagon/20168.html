Dear David and Olga,
This is not a newsgroup, it is a mailing list.
You don't show much appreciation for net-iquette yourself.
Don't worry, I'm not going to flame the Post Master there, s/he's not 
the one who has just pissed me off.  I will simply send my regards and
opinion of you.
You are basically an ignorant fuckwad, peddling your $50.00 whores
over the internet.  This kind of comercial use of private mailboxes
and independantly operated Mailing lists (there is a difference) is
illegal and very irritating.

IHA(I humbly ask) that you force prettily painted eggs up your cornhole
and sing songs of revoloution until the KGB pack you into a box and
drop you out in Siberia somewhere.




Dear vanagon_at_lenti folks, 

I'm sorry for sending this to absolutely everyone, but I am hoping that
some of you will join me in writing to his postmaster in the hopes of
putting a stop to this kind of shit on our (Gerry's) list.

Dear postmaster,

Please don't let this happen again.
Thank you in advance.



Cheers
