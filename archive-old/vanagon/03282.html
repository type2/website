&gt;On our trip, we waved at all of the VW Bricks we saw.  The number of friendly
&gt;return waves was dismally low.  I really thought I'd get a better response. 

Yup, bread-loafers greet each other more often (maybe 50% of the time);
microbussers probably always greet each other, so I guess it's a bus
species/generation thing. The older, the hipper. You don't really greet
another bus generation: if it's a later model, the driver's probably not hip
enough; if it's an older model, you seem too established and conservative
and hide/look away in shame. 

I sometimes get into trouble when I attempt the VW salute, a sequence of
two hand signs. the first is V as in victory (index and middlefinger),
then you add your ring finger to make a W. My unfortunate lack of
dexterity makes it sometimes look like an insult (or a Parisian greeting
often observed on major traffic circles). He, va te faire %$&amp;^*&amp;! :(
