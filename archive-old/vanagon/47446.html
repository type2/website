&gt;Geez... just about *anything* that's rust free is worth more than 
&gt;that ($1300.00) around here!

Ellis:
Yup, worth more than that around here too. Folks just dont wanna buy VWs in
Phoenix in the Summertime (depending on the year and model). Lots o' peeps
(including supposed vw mechanics) shy away from the post '72's through
Vanagons because they are ignorant of how to work on them. I feel I will
sell it in a couple of weeks when the college kids get into the &quot;back to
school and need transportation for the season&quot; mode. I have time...

Compare: &lt;month does not indicate the same year&gt;
Sold totally rusty, nasty, POS '74 thing $1850.00 to first caller. It needed
everything! ~February

Sold a burn victim '63 15 window rolling shell with a warped roof and other
damage to the first caller for $1400.00 ~March

Took months to sell a really sweet, complete, original, 6v/40hp, never
nosed, '62 Ghia coupe. Gave it away for $2300.00~ Jan1-Ap15th (was &quot;worth&quot;
about $3500.00) Everyone wanted the slammed 1835, Kraco pumper FM, set up. ;(

Took months and months to sell a '70 ghia vert that only needed seat covers
to be near perfect (July - Sept, 1986)
