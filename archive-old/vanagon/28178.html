&gt;Many thanks for insulation info.  A quick question.  Where do I get this
&gt;foam (do you know any brand names) and exactly what is it called.  I
&gt;have noticed several different types, some expanding and some not.  Also
&gt;they all seem very expensive.  One large can costs about $6 and does not
seem
&gt;to fill very much space...

David,

In small quantities the foam IS expensive.  The spray-on stuff will probably
cost you about half a buck a square foot for a 1&quot; thick deposition.  

Harbor Freight sold the spary-on stuff in two-bottle kits but no longer carry
it.  I'm digging for a new source and not having much luck.  The stuff they
sold was from Taiwan and used CFC's for the propellant, illegally,
apparently.  Hobby shops usually carry two-part urethane foam in pints &amp;
quarts.  You either mix &amp; pour, or paint on one, spray-on the other using
something like a Windex bottle.  Model railroaders use it for building
mountains and the like.

I use different brands of the canned stuff.  'Foam Sealant' is a
low-expansion formulation from 'MD Corp' [Macklanburg-Duncan, Okie City],
'Touch-n'Foam' is high-expansion stuff made by 'Convenience Products Inc' [St
Louis].  The R-factor of the foam as an insulator and its strength as a
structural component is a function of its density, which can vary from a low
of about 22 pounds per cubic foot, about the same as pine, to a high of about
six pounds per cubic foot, a bit lighter than the lightest balsawood or cork.

I stated that rather poorly -- high-density foam weighs more, has more
structural strength.

I pay about $3.50 for a 12 oz can (Home Depot, Oceanside, CA).  That's the
high-expansion (low-density) stuff.  One can yields about two cubic feet.
 You can increase the density by spraying the foam with water, causing the
surface to cure more rapidly/denser.

'Ideal' insulating formulation results in a density of between 12 and 18
pounds per cubic foot, yielding an R-factor of about 16 per inch of
thickness.  I don't want to add that much weight that high above the CG of my
bus so I'll shoot for about 8 lbs/cu.ft.

The Volkswagen bus is virutally uninuslated.  Early models used styrofoam
panels 1/2&quot; thick, but they were improperly applied.  Later models used less
expensive fiberglas, which was also improperly applied.  By applying
expanding foam directly to the metal you achieve a perfectly insulated
capsule, allowing you to use less insulation.  Try for as thick a layer as
you can get on the ceiling but even half an inch will result in a profound
difference.

Expanding urethane foam contains polyurethane isocyanate.  Don't eat it and
don't let it get on your skin.  Water vapor in the air acts as a catalyst and
curing agent; the stuff is safe enough once it hardens.

Urethane foam contains fire retardants but will burn like a bitch under the
right condtions.

Check your yellow pages for commercial outfits.  They use spary-foam on
roofs, to insulate refrigeration trucks, ducting and so forth.  You should be
able to find someone willing to give your masked &amp; prepped van a spritz.  Use
the canned stuff to get in behind the metal work.

You can do a fair job on the overhead surfaces by squirting the canned stuff
onto sheets of waxed paper, pressing it into place, troweling it onto the
surface -- with your hands but through the waxed paper -- and letting it
cure.  As it cures it will expand.  Once cured, peel off the waxed paper.
 Repeat the process until you've achieved the depth and coverage you want.
 This is how I did my bug.  Took about four cans, a week of spare-time work.
 (I didn't say it was easy :-)  I ended up cutting away a lot of it; it
expanded to a greater depth than I wanted, or to the wrong contour.  There's
a learning curve involved.  A messy one.  Don't let the stuff get on your
hands or clothes; it has many of the properties of crazy glue.  Acetone will
cut it if it is not fully cured, after that, you're stuck.  

I eventually got pretty handy at the waxed-paper bit, putting the paper on a
piece of plywood, leaving a good margin, squirting on the foam in a fairly
uniform layer, using the plywood to raise the waxed paper into position (it's
too floppy to handle otherwise).  It sticks, then gravity takes over and it
starts to droop away from the ceiling.  Thats when you start 'trowling' it
and that's why you want to leave a wide margin of waxed paper.  Once you get
it troweled down to about a 1/2&quot; thick layer, it will hold and you can start
another section.  But the sections can't be contiguous.  Try to do
alternating foot-square patches.  Let the first batch cure -- say, one
can's-worth of work.  Come back after it has cured, peel off the waxed paper,
study what you've done, plan your next batch.  I let mine cure overnight but
some sections kept expanding for more than a week (!)

Start small.  There are a lot of tricks to be learned.  And what worked for
me might not work for you; experiment.

I 'finished' the surface by sanding it to a uniform curve with a sanding
block and #80 paper, a HELL of a job.  Wear a mask and goggles, keep a fan
blowing and a vacuum handy; that crap gets everywhere.  I gave the sanded
surface a spritz of white paint; the urethane is inert to most solvents; you
can use polyester resin without fear of dissolving the foam.

One advantage of the sanded surface:  It is anechoic, soaks up sound like a
sponge. (Wizard pun... :-)
