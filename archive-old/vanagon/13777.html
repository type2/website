I found this item in a remainders list and thought of this group:

different ways to put this tasty and versatile fruit to use in recipes
ranging from the everyday to the sublime, to enhance stews and stuffings,
naturally sweeten breads and desserts, and add a piquant plus to
marinades. 232 pages. Chronicle. Paperbound Pub. at $9.95 ... $3.95
