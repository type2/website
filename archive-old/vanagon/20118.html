&gt;I'd love to have intermittant wipers on my vanagon.  Derek doesn't have the

&gt;how to get this part?

i have an intermittant wiper on my 88 bus. it came from Heathkit (which, i
think, doesn't make them anymore). however, the components are simple and
all are available from Radio Shack. so if anybody wants a copy of the
instruction book (complete with diagram, schematic, and parts list), let
me know and i'll send it to you.
the wiper delay allows adjustment of the number of wipes and varies the
delay from continuous to about 40 seconds.
