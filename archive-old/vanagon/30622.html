Subject: Oil Pump Replacement Diesel...


  Ok...so it looks like my oil pump is way dead...

Does anybody know...On NuBus ('82 Diesel) can the 
oil pump be replaced without dripping the engine?

On the Rabbit Diesels, I *think* it is just a pan-drop,
but can the pan be easily dropped when that same engine
is shoe-horned into the cramped Vanagon compartment?

any ideas?
