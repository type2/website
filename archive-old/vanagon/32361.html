Congratulations! It's nice to hear of another retrowestie ;) Plan on more 
than one day to put it in, I've been struggling with the installation on 
and off for over a Year (on holidays, or whenever I have a large block of 
time). How much did you pay, and what westie died to be the organ donor?
Good Luck and Happy Camping!
