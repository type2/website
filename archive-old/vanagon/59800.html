Subject: searching archives 

Hello, I'm a new subscriber that's looking at a 1985 Westphalia and I'd 
like to search the archives for relevent information.

Do I have to download all the archived material and do the searches on my 
PC or is there a web site that has been set up to do searches?

Thanks.....Harry (Wanabus)
