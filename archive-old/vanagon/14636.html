&gt; Hey, hey now, lets be nice, I've seen a lot of 1600 dual ports blowing
&gt; more oil than diesels blow soot. A well tuned diesel shouldn't be that
&gt; bad except on those off throttle rich shifting moments, if it is, you
&gt; got a problem.
&gt; 
I agree.  Our '87 Golf Diesel hardly smokes at all.  Goes through 
AirCare with 0% to 1% opacity.  The only time she smokes a bit is 
when I'm in a lower gear, foot to the floor, going up a steep grade.  

Actually, it's too bad she doesn't smoke more... it's a great defense 
against tailgaters :)

Harry.
