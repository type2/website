Baldred Prunehead!:  In part of the diagram you quoted, was written:

 C1         |               |
                ---     |               |
            .01uf|      / R2            |
                 |      \ 5k pot        |
                 |    -----&gt;            |

I just KNEW you'd find a way to get large quantities of these
kinds of substances in the car somewhere, but how ingenius to
hide them in the wipers!
