Subject: Gear ratio choices (was:HIGHWAY SPEEDS)


&gt;&gt;We have a 1973 trasnsmission in one of our vans and a VDO tach
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;80 mph = 4,000 rpm.
&gt;&gt;75 mph = 3,750 rpm.
&gt;&gt;70 mph = 3,500 rpm.
&gt;&gt;65 mph = 3,250 rpm.
&gt;&gt;etc.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;As you can see, the tach reading is 50 times the mph.

&gt;Off the topic of baywindows for a sec and onto vanagons for just a second,
&gt;when doing like 70 mph, my tach reads around 4000 rpm.  I noticed that when
&gt;i do that same speed in another car i used to drive it was around 2500, this
&gt;difference is due to the differences in the transmissions, correct?  So then
&gt;im thinking (buzz, crackle..) hmmm my vanagon 4 cylinder is rotating twice
&gt;as fast as my car's 6 cyl. engine, and therefore it will get twice the wear,
&gt;and half the life, all else equal.  So, the vanagon transmission is
&gt;&quot;killing&quot; our engines??  There was a 5 speed offered in germany i believe
&gt;the archive road and track thingie said... hmmm.. maybe if i won the
lottery. :)

Now wait a minute here.  The gear ratios are carefully selected to allow the
engine to operate at an efficient rpm.  Check out the following formula:

  Large steel tool shed + feeble motor= 4000 rpm

where:
Large steel tool shed= Vanagon/bus
feeble motor= 2.0 four cylinder(or less)

Your other car probably had 50% more displacement and much less weight, not
to mention wind resistance, so yes it's life is much easier.  My VDO tach in
our '79 by the way exactly reflects the numbers of the senders '73.
The part that continues to amaze me about VW's is that they last as long as
they do.
I was on a road trip one night to Portland, which is only 150 miles from my
house.  I was traveling along at 70 mph* (3500 rpm) and my head started
drifting as I listened to it rapping away back there.

150 miles/70 miles per hour=2.14 hours

At 3600 rpms, that is 462,857 cycles.

Since I had to come back that night I was closing in on a MILLION cycles for
a single stupid road trip.  Amazing?  If I ran the motor at that rpm all the
time (and 3600 rpm is actually my target rpm for driving around) then we
arrive at the final mileage at pull out (191,000 miles in my case) of
589,371,428 cycles, (not counting idling at lights of course...).
Fucking amazing where I come from (Earth).

If you were to trash your present gear ratios and set your engine to run at
2500 rpm instead of 3500, you would experience serious lack of power
problems (You can experience it right now by driving 25 mph in 4th gear.
Any fun?  Think it's going to last longer doing this?).  Hell, just bungee
the shifter into fourth, that would give you the lowest possible rpm at any
given speed.

The single biggest way to make more power in a piston engine is to increase
the cubic inches.  The American way is to increase the piston diameter
and/or stroke.  The rest of the world spins the motor faster.  Here are the
extremes: If I rev my old Rabbit to 5500 rpm's and dump the clutch I get
smoke out the wheel wells for most of a block.  If I take off from a stand
still in second gear it's quite a bit less exciting.
Aside from that juvenile display, higher revs means more oil flow, higher
oil pressure (to a point) and more coolant(air on a REAL car ;) ) flow.

Yes, the motor will wear out faster (but not as fast as you would think.
Keep reading). My father is in to big diesel motors that would explode at
3000 rpms.  He says &quot;Yup, a motor's only got so many revs in it before it's
shot.  The question is how soon do you want 'em?&quot;  (My answer is to point to
my RD400 that isn't even fully awake until it hits 6000 and lives for
10,500.  I have a five gallon bucket full of old pistons too.)

His point would be valid except for the well publicized fact that 90% (or
more) of engine wear happens on start up, which is true.  Nothing has oil on
it on start up.  Once a motor is running and oil is getting everywhere, NO
METAL PARTS ARE ACTUALLY IN CONTACT WITH EACH OTHER.  They are all happily
skiing on a film of Castrol GTX or whatever your poison is.  No contact, no
wear.  If you doubt that, I believe the Idiot manual has a detailed
description of thin film lubrication properties.  I suspect that my fathers
engines last 700,000 miles because they weigh more than my entire bus ready
for camping.  It takes a hoist to pull the damn water pump on his latest ride.

Sorry to ramble for so long.  Don't change the ratios on your car.  They
were carefully selected by engineers who have forgotten more about cars than
most of us will ever know.

*which by the way is against the law, and makes certain people mad.  I also
inhale.
