Subject: oil cooler flush...

Alright... I know I'm nuts, but then who wants to spend large sums of cash
when you possibly don't have to..
I'm speaking of the infamous type IV (and doghouse style type 1, or reclining
type III) oil cooler which in today's market will set you back a good beaner
or two and then it gets hid under shrouds.... no fun.

I'm in the midst of another type IV rebuild. This time for my wife's 412 which
is recieving a donor motor from my otherwise extinct 72 naugawestie bus.
After having the valve guides replaced and the ports cleaned and matched to the
solex duals I decided to tackle the problem of assuring good oil flow.  Needless
to say I cracked the case and replaced all bearings, cleaned oil press/relief &amp;
all vent channels and then proceeded to the stock cooler. Now the history of the
cooler is that I bought it new from RMMW last year for 130+ bucks and have put
less than 10k on it with regular oil changes every 1500k. Should be fine right?
Thing is, on its last run I sucked a #3 exhaust valve which imploded the piston
and took out half of the cylinder. I'm finding shrapnel everywhere... Hence my
reticence on just stuffing the cooler back on...

What I did was take an adapter from a type I motor that converts an early oil
cooler over to a later doghouse style oil cooler. This is a piece of cast alum-
inum with two studs to bolt the newer style oilcooler onto and a mount hole on
which to bolt the unit to the engine case. The reason for the adapter was to
be able to bolt a fitted plate onto the oil cooler which had two 1/4&quot; fuel line
fittings mounted opposite the inlet and return line of the cooler.  With the 2
6mm bolts tightened down over a pair of spare rubber bushings, and the
third mount hole filled with another 6mm bolt and nut (overkill, but why
not) I was
able to pressurize the oil cooler to 120lbs.  I did this to check my fittings
more than anything as I realize oil pressure is nowhere near this high in any
actual running condition.

I then connected a simple 3gpm 12v liquid pump (mine came out of our motorhome
fresh water supply) with the outlet line going into the oil cooler and the
other end (or outlet from the oil cooler) going back into the cleaner solution.

I did initially run an inline fuel filter to trap any sediment from going
back into the oil cooler, but after it ran for a few hours I didn't see
anything and
moved the filter to the outlet end of the oil cooler. As it turned out I
did trap what appears to be a bit of aluminum paste which I probably didn't
notice
earlier on the intake...

I ran the pump from 6pm last night till 4pm today, I used a gallon container of
carb cleaner as my wicked mix as I find Gunk is as wholesome a degreaser as any
around. After I finished the Gunk I ran an airhose through the lines, then I
shifted to a tank of acetone for twenty minutes and finished with a 5 minute
gas bath and a 20 minute oil soak.

My total cost was nil, granted you will need to find a liquid compatable pump
that doesn't seize up under the viscosity, or harsh chemical environment, but
even if you resort to buying a used Shureflow pump and investing 2 bucks in a
pair of 1/4&quot; threaded nipples (for the gas hose) you will still be ahead of the
game -vs- the cost of a replacement oil cooler... And the piece of mind knowing
you have a clean cooler just waiting to do its thing...


Anybody want a simple diagram on the construction of the aforementioned dohickey
drop me a line. I don't warranty that it will work with Mr. Grunge, but if you
are rebuilding a motor you have some history on, this will save some wear and
tear on the ole wallet/pocketbook...

um well, that's it
