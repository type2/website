Subject: '91GL Remains Dead

Thanks to everyone who sent ideas responding to my previous post. They got
me to thinking and trying different approaches.

Now, I am just about out of ideas on how to get my daughter's '91GL to
start whe &quot;cold&quot;, below 30F.

The problem is that the engine cranks reasonably well but gives no sign of
wanting to run. Now and then it will puff but not sound like it wants to
run.

However, when we tow the car it will immediately start and run OK including
idling properly right after starting. As long as the engine is warm, it
will start and run perfectly.

If the outside temperature gets above 40F then it will start instantly.
Below 30F it refuses to start.

There are about 110,000 miles on the car. The problem came on fairly
rapidly, within a couple of days.

I have 20-50 Castrol in the engine and it is fairly fresh oil. While this
is pretty heavy weight for cold temperatures it works fine in my '91GL.
Also, at 20F, the engine cranks nicely but fails to start.

I have checked everything I can think of including:

Checked gas from the injectors. Nice cone of gas.

Checked that the fuel pump is running and pumping by partially filling a
milk jug from the T connection on the top of the engine.

Checked spark at the plugs.

Checked continuity for the O2 and coolant temp sensors

Disassembled and reworked the mass airflow meter.(This is not a great
design for longevity. The carbon path was worn through.)

Replaced the air flow meter with the one from my '91GL without success.

Cleaned and lubed all the engine compartment electrical connections.

Cranking voltage is about 10V when cold.

Checked engine timing when cranking.

Charged the battery fully and cranked with the charger connected.

Is it possible that there is something in the ECU that controls starts that
has failed but would not affect the running once started? If it is possibly
the ECU, where is the little bugger and can it be swapped easily between my
van and hers?

Any ideas you could offer would really be appreciated.

Thanks,

Herb Harmison
