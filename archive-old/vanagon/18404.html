So Jeff P. Schneiter says:
&gt; Did anyone catch that Dr. Death used to drive a VW bus? He had a
&gt; pre-1972 bay window, white, with curtains and louvered side middle
&gt; windows.
&gt; 
&gt; I say &quot;used to&quot; because it was impounded when they found his last
&gt; customer inside it. There was a picture of it being towed away about 2
&gt; weeks ago, in some Bay Area newspaper.
&gt; 
&gt; That's the way to go...inside a VW! I hope he gets it back soon.

Yeah, now here's someone I think we should send $10 to so he can
get another bus! ;)  Kavorkian, now there's a true Dead-Head. ;p
