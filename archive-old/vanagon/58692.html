&gt;I was wondering if other listmembers could go and check under your cargo
floor mats and letsee if we can come up with the years the westy middle seat
floor tracks were available.

Chris,

Just standing up to be counted.  I have a '91 with floor tracks.  My
neighbour has an 86-91 without.  I will ask him the year and let you know.
