Subject: VW Tie Pin

I visited the Volkswagen Concept web site several months ago and
expressed interest in the new vehicle. One thing I did ask is when will
it be on the market. Yesterday, I received from VW a package of
materials containing the formated letter thanking me for my interest and
explaining they are trying to get in to market by 2000. Oh well...:-(
They did include a nice little tie pin with the letter. The pin has the
emblem of the Concept. It looks like the tops of two tires joined by
another arc. I wonder if VW knows the amount of people that are loyal to
the kinds of cars and vans VW used to manufacture. If the Concept is as
fun to drive as the Beetle was (and still is) then we will benefit.
