Subject: beetle mirror

Please excuse this quick digression from busses, but so many of you also
own other Volkswagens that I thought I'd take a shot.

My boss is looking for a used passenger-side mirror for his '74 bug
convertible. Can anyone point me in the right direction for finding one at
a good price via the internet?
