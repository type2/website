Subject: Re: Re[2]: Value of '87 Syncro Westfalia

All speculation aside, I'd just like to know what people are actually 
paying. I live in the Northwest where all buses and vanagons command a 
premium price. BTW the loan officer at my bank said that they would loan 
$12000. Since they require 25% down on used car loans, they must have pegged 
the value at $16000. And it cost just a bit over $20K brand new almost nine 
years ago!

&gt;     Brad,
&gt;
&gt;     I agree that it is high (more than I paid for my 90 with 13,000 less
&gt;     miles) , but not twice what it should be. Here is one approach that
&gt;     Mark could consider:
&gt;
&gt;     If I am correct, it is a Westfalia GL, not just a GL, so what is the
&gt;     premium for a Westie? Edmunds shows an 87 Camper GL is worth
&gt;     $2775 more than a GL.
&gt;
&gt;     Then there is the Syncro premium. The Blue Books say its worth
&gt;     something like a $500 premium, I suspect the market will pay more.
&gt;
&gt;     Also, we have to consider a premium for having both in the same
&gt;     package...its worth something in the eye of the buyer who will settle
&gt;     for nothing less than a Syncro Westie, because Westies are harder to
&gt;     find than Vans, and Syncros are even harder. Both together is, IMHO,
&gt;     the ultimate late model van. This is much less tangible...
&gt;
&gt;     Edmunds, for what it is worth, says with a mileage adjustment
&gt;     this car is worth, retail (i.e. asking) $9645.  I paid 7% over Edmunds
&gt;     retail price for my 90, and think I got a good deal. So figure 10%
&gt;     over Edmunds as a reasonable deal- so I would come up with something
&gt;     like $10,600.
&gt;
&gt;     Now, FWIW,  if I could have picked up a 87 with these miles
&gt;     for that price, I would have grabbed it...

&gt;&gt;I looked at an '87 Westfalia today, Syncro, very nice, 67K miles. It's a GL
&gt;&gt;with locking rear differential and no other options as far as I could tell.
&gt;&gt;The owner is asking $17,500. Is this a reasonable price? I know these are
&gt;&gt;pretty rare, but do they really go for this much?
&gt;
&gt;Let me know where I can get that much for an '87 Synrco GL!!!  I'll take mine
&gt;(that I paid $6995 for) sell it and take the profit and get a Syncro Westy
&gt;for the $17,500!!
&gt;
&gt;That price is about twice what it's worth.
