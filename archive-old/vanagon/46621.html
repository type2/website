Subject: Type2 Stickers

Well now that some of us are no longer V_at_L'ers.  Who's going to make the new
Type2 stickers.  I would suggest the exact same design except with the new list
address.  This way we can keep the semblance of a united family on the roads
(sob, weep, sob,...).

Maybe we can have Type2 stickers in bottom right corner of back window and
Vanagon stickers in bottom left (where almost everyone agreed to put them).

Can't remember who made the V_at_L stickers so I'm cc'ing V_at_L just in case it was
someone from that side of the family.
