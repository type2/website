Subject: Re: Front Speakers



&gt;Just replaced the front speakers.  I found out a couple of things that
&gt;didn't seem to get mentioned before.
&gt;
&gt;First, if you got the molded plastic type stock blauplunk, the speaker
&gt;screws out.  On the inside of the panel there is a collar that acts like
&gt;a big nut to hold the speaker against the panel.  Second, The speaker is
&gt;glued to the molded plastic grill. It ain't worth even trying to reuse
&gt;the original grill.


It can be done, but not with ease. I rescued the original grills for the 
rear speakers (same design) by chisling the speaker off the back of the 
grill with a small screwdriver and a hammer.  Took me about 40 minutes to 
do both speakers, but made it possible to mount a pair of Orion speakers 
hidden behind the factory grills.  Drawback was that they would not mount 
using the screw-on method of the originals, so I had to come up with a 
different way of holding the grills in place.
