&gt;My latest experience in my 1971 VW bus is kind of rough.  As I was driving

&gt;about 60mph, some drunk who apparently thought my fabulous double taillights
&gt;ment that he was still on the road, nailed me hard on the left rear of the
&gt;bus.  He then veered to the left a bit, kept his foot hard on the gas, and
&gt;continued down the freeway.

Eugene,
That's horrible! At least with my accident, I've got a police report and a
driver to go after.
You must feel really, well, violated.
I hope events move as smoothly as possible, as you and the van get well again.
