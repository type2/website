Vanagoners -

It pains me to do this, but I don't see any way out of it.  Due to my
wife's impending USAF assignment to Okinawa in June '96, I am forced 
to part with my beloved '85 Vanagon GL.  US Air Force policy is to 
provide for long-term storage of household goods for personnel assigned
overseas, but that does not include vehicles.  We have two, and 
provisions for storing one ('88 Jeep Cherokee).  Practicality wins over
sentimentality.. this time.

Anyhow, this is a prime opportunity for you New England wannabusers.  I bought
this Vanagon 2.5 years ago from Minuteman VW in Bedford, MA and paid too
much for it because their sales people are sleazy-slick and I'm not.  I didn't
get suckered too badly though, because they fixed everything that was broken
and it's lasted me this far.  I was warned about the leaky-head problem
but pooh-poohed it -- I was in *love*.  So now the heads leak, but I just
keep adding anti-freeze and bleeding the thing -- it runs fine and doesn't
overheat.  

The past ownership records for the bus show that it lived its first 60k miles
in Florida, then it came up to New England.  It's now up to 91k and the body
is in *great* shape.  There is *no* rot anywhere, and the only evidence of
rust is minor surface stuff in the body seams that you could either live with 
or easily correct.  The interior is pretty good too;  no rips and moderate
wear that comes with being part of the family.  And it has the bonus of my
5-year-old's artwork on the back seat upholstery -- she'll be famous someday
so you'll want to save it...

In the course of troubleshooting cold starting problems I have replaced
the entire ignition system, the fuel pump and fuel filter, and also the battery
within the last year.  The final fix was replacing the fuel pressure regulator.
The bus now starts and idles without stalling, even in single-digit 
temperatures!  The only real faults are flaky turn signals and an exhaust
leak at the left (Left is Left, Front is Front) top exhaust pipe where it comes
out of the head, just past the flange.

I bought it primarily because my '78 breadloaf was rotting out from under
me (the front axle beam was about to detach) and because I was sick of
freezing my feet in the winter.  I wasn't about to give up driving a bus 
though.  This one will last for a good long while, and it puts out 
beautiful heat in the winter - it's been great these last couple months.

This is not a Westy or anything wonderful like that, just a 7-passenger
people mover with lots o' heart.  If you're interested then let me know.
I won't let it go before the summer, though.
