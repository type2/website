Nope, the '63's have a slant at the front of rear bumper blade and the 
66's had more of a pointed edge:
                         ____           ____  
    side view:   63 =        /     66 =     \ 
                        ___/            ____/      

This start of the non-slant was late 64 as far as I could 
tell, but it this is not an 'exact science'.  Of course you 
could use the '63's whithout hurting anything.  It will fit 
fine.
