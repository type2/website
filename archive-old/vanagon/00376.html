&gt;
&gt;Hello,
&gt;	All these tech sheets are really great.  I was wondering if there
&gt;was any archive somewhere for these.  If I remember correctly, we could
&gt;make them avail from the listserver or better yet, put them on a web
&gt;server.  I think we would probably have the first vanagon home page.  :&gt;
&gt;Or, for that matter the first VW home page.  I'm setting up a web server
&gt;but it is still in it's infancy so it probably wouldn't be the best place
&gt;to put it but I imagine someone on this list knows someone sysadmining a
&gt;web server.

God help the server that has to have all of Joel's notes and FAQ's.  He'll
overload anything they've got.  ;)
