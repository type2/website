&gt;Hey Todd
&gt;
&gt;Do you have a # for Griot's? I wanted to order 
&gt;some paint for the muffler on my '76 Westy.
&gt;THANKS!!!
&gt;
&gt;Yes, it's 800-345-5789. They have some ceramic coating that comes in a
gallon pail. Looks kind of interesting. If anyone has tried it on exhaust
systems let us know how it worked.
