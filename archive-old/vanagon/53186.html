Subject: Hitch for Motor Scooter?

My Honda 90 is getting out of the shop this week and I am interested in
carring it on the back of my van.  If I buy a trailer hitch and a stock wheel
platform that plugs in to the hitch we are talking big bucks ($400?).

Does anyone have hitch or know where to get one cheep (San Jose, Caifornia
Area)?  What about a scooter mount?  I know some of you do travel with
scooters, any ideas?

Thanks,
                         - Craig, '86 Syncro Westy
