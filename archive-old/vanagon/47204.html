Subject: Temp Gauge/Light

List,  Well I am back from down under having delivered Bentley to
listmember David Yates.  We chatted about things other than VW but it was
nice to meet in Queensland.  Saw 2 Wetfalias in Australia - 1 breadloaf and
one Caravelle (Vanagon).  The Caravelle was neither a full camper nor a
weekender but had about half the interior fittings including the frig and
sink.  It had the full width bed in the rear and the usual pop top - any
ideas?

We got caught for 20 extra hours at the Auckland airport because of Mt.
Ruapehu erupting.  The airline sid that it was an act of God and so no
accommodation would be provided!  Get this - 20 hours at airport, 2 hours
on plane waiting and playing games, 14 hours flying, arriving at LAX at
3am, 5 hours waiting for the San Luis Obispo flight!!!!  This is non stop!

Nancy,  This is probably too late but along with all the other good ideas
(and the obvious that it is actually overheating!) my problem was solved by
replacing the voltage stabilizer in the dash cluster.  My problem started
as an erratic gauge, spread to flashing light and then both fuel and temp
gauges went crazy!  The analyisi came from this list and Bentley and the
part cost about $15.

Good luck, Don
