Subject: Re: bus accident

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;My brother saw a bus &quot;with a lot of windows along the top on its side&quot; 
&gt;&gt;along Hiway 101 yesterday--the same (unfortunate) accident?  
&gt;&gt;

What I saw was on the TV. The bus was on its wheels while the other small car
was really in pieces. I don't have the impression that the accident happened
on highway 101. Could be it but not sure.
