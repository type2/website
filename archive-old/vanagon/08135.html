Subject: '74 bus, low compression


Hi,

I have a '74 Bus (1800) which has low compression (~90 psi) on all
four cylinders.  I rebuilt the engine 10k miles ago; the compression
has ALWAYS been this low.  (I don't know what it was before the
rebuild -- it was not working when I got it.)  When I rebuilt it I
replaced the pistons, sleeves, rings, rocker arms; the heads were
cleaned and hemi-cut, all of the valves and valve seats were replaced.
All of the parts that I would suspect might lead to low compression
were replaced/rebuilt.

It runs fine.  (Except on cold mornings, but that's the carb and
another long story.)  Gets up hills with all the power one could
expect in a bus.  Runs hot, gets poor mileage, but probably not
unreasonably so.  So the questions are: are these compression numbers
very, very bad, and is there anything to worry about?  The engine
might come out soon so that I can get some transmission work done --
would there be any point to tearing into the engine while it's on the
porch?  What kind of compression numbers do the rest of you (with the
type 4 engines) get?

My apologies if this type of thing has been discussed in depth before.
I searched the vintagvw archives for clues and came up empty.  If
there is a better place to look, please let me know.  Thanks

Tim
