Subject: this weekend in santa cruz!!


Ok, Scott is going to be in Santa Cruz (this is old news to some
of you, new to others, but wanted to reach you all at the same time).  He
invited the list to come down and join him.  Originally I thought
I'd arrive Sat noonish, but when I saw how many people were interested,
I thought maybe I should reconsider and arrive Friday nite.  Are
the rest of you game?

Here's Scott's directions as to where he'll be:

-

The place is called Sunset State Park.  Its almost due west of
Watsonville.  Look for signes that say Manresa and Sunset State Parks.
You should be able to take W. Beach road to San Andreas Rd.  This
&quot;should&quot; get you to the front gate.  The parks front gate is at the
north end of the park. We will be towards the southern camping areas.
If I remember correctly, the spot we will be near is in the 17 - 30
range.  Its really a pretty small place with all the camping spots in
loops, so we should be fairly easy to find.

Another point of referrence are all the purple flowers just before the
entrance.   The hillside is covered with them as you drive up.

We'll see you there.
