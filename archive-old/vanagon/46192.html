&gt;marching to the beat of a different drummer has always been difficult ...
&gt;


Sometimes I play my drum, other times I just whistle.  You can come along if
you like :-)

I drive old Volkswagens because I can fix them; keep them running.  They're
pretty simple.  I don't have to think about them much.  It gives me time to
think about other stuff.  

I don't pay much attention to what other folks are doing.  I don't understand
the herd thing.  Ditto when I drive.  I got a bug that flies, if I'm in a
rush.  Mostly, I drive to get there, to enjoy the view.  I drive 50mph and
still get there ahead of guys doing 75.  Kinda funny but true.  And doing 50
makes it practical to take prettier roads, gives you time to wave at folks,
see their startled look as they struggle to decide if they should wave back.
 Most do.

Having a Volkswagen that doesn't run is bad.  You're probably doing something
wrong, probably thinking about it in the wrong way.  If the engine is right
all you need is air, fuel and fire.  

Build your engine to last forever, taking as long as it takes.  It won't last
forever but while it's alive you can count on it; it will take you where you
want to go and give plenty of warning when it has a problem.  Just you and
the machine.  No outsiders.  If it runs sweet, it's your triumph.  Runs sour,
you did something wrong.  Nowadays, no one is ever at fault, no one accepts
responsibility.  Three Volkswagens that don't run sounds like a failure to
focus.  Make one run.  Make it run good.  Then think about the other two.

  Own an old Volkswagen that runs nice, goes where you point it, runs as long
as you ask, you're doing something right.  It's a personal thing, like
putting putting five in the X at a hundred yards, being able to cover them
with a quarter.  You're in control of your life.  But only if you want to be.

PS -- You can substitute any type of vehicle for 'Volkswagen' , the message
stays the same.  But veedubs are pretty simple, easy to fix.  Might as well
go with a veedub.
