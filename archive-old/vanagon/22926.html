&gt; Howdy!
&gt; 
&gt; 	Bug O' Rama is coming in a couple of months, and I have a
&gt; question about showing a vehicle.
&gt; 
&gt; 	Now, my bus isn't anywhere near being show condition, but I've
&gt; seen busses in the show area that looked _worse_!  Like primer'd busses
&gt; with nasty dents in them!
&gt; 
&gt; 	I'm thinking about parking my bus in the show area, but I'm not
&gt; sure what's involved.  Do you _have_ to leave it all open for the
&gt; world to climb in?  Is there a class for cars in progress?
&gt; 
Sometimes they actually _do_ have a class for cars in progress. They almost 
always have a class for &quot;daily driver&quot; at least. No you don't have to leave your
car open, but most people do. I've shown my bus a few times, and like to leave 
it fully open...ragtop, side doors, popout windows, safaris and all. Then again,
I usually tend to hang around the bus with a cooler and BBQ or whatever. If I go
around to &quot;peruse&quot;, someone else is usually hanging around the bus. I have never
had any problems, but then again the bigger shows like Bug-o-rama tend to 
attract more riff-raff (the sano-bitchen-boombox-thumper crowd).

&gt; 	If anything else, it sure would beat having to park in the 
&gt; boondockers!
&gt; 

Yeah, I that's the only reason I show.._dot_usually a much better place to hang out.
