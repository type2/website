joel&gt; own thots run more along the lines of these paint guns, the
joel&gt; things that &gt;shoot capsule of paint. ... Shooting &gt;such idiots,
joel&gt; even with a blob of paint, would be a public service. Being &gt;able
joel&gt; to identify incautious drivers by the smear of purple or yellow
joel&gt; paint &gt;might become a new trend.
joel&gt;
joel&gt; hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm. :)
joel&gt;
joel&gt; well, but i can think of some difficulties/problems with this. -
joel&gt; stern launchers would be ok, but the idiot would see the paint
joel&gt; gun fire
joel&gt;   at the same time he heard the &quot;thunk&quot; (&quot;thwack&quot;??) on the front
joel&gt; of his/her
joel&gt;   car. and the splatter of the paint pellet could obscure his
joel&gt; windshield
joel&gt;   (sticky legal situation there) ... and possibly render him/her
joel&gt; enraged and
joel&gt;   even more likely to do stupid things to YOUR rear end. :( -
joel&gt; side launchers would be better; as they came alongside, giv'em a
joel&gt; broadside!!
joel&gt;   like the old days of the pirate movies!! :)
joel&gt;   however ... the paint is sure to splatter onto your car as
joel&gt; well. - front lauchers would be worst: the paint would surely
joel&gt; come back to hit your
joel&gt;   windshield/etc. :(
joel&gt;
joel&gt; how about magnetic paintballs with delayed detonation?? :)
joel&gt;
joel&gt; joel (&quot;Damn the paint balls! Full Speed Ahead!!&quot;)

        What would work best is a rear mounted &quot;stealth&quot; gun. Put the
sucker about 2' off the ground, around the location of the air scoop on
breadloaves. Trigger relay on the dash, or somewhere up front. A small
hole, perhaps a rust hole if the bus is not yet restored. Obviously this
would only be on the left side, as we spend our lives in the right lane,
and could only nail pedestrians with a right mounted gun. When the
offending mid 80's LTD or brand spanking new Nissan/Toyota/&lt;Your Brand
Here&gt; pulls alongside, wiat until the driver is past the mount, then let
fly. The driver hears a &quot;thunk&quot;, (unless the $500 CD changer is on) worries
about rocks on the road, and doesn't know until his/her arrival home that
he/she's been had. By this time they've probably already forgotten you and
your lil' ol' slow bus, and have no clue what really happend. With this
location backspray on your bus should be minimal as well. Perhaps we could
look into paint pellets with ingredients that eat paint jobs?  ;-)  ;-)
