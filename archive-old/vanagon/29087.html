Subject: Which is the outside lane?

I'm serious. Given a four-lane freeway, or blvd, the fast lanes are the two
in the middle. The slow lanes are the ones nearest the border of the
highway.

Which are the inside lanes?

I just had a conversation in the elevator, all of us born in N Amer (3
Yanks, 2 Canucks), and the vote was 3-2 that the outside lane is the fast
lane!

Two of the voters were born and raised here in Windsor and they disagreed.

So here's a Friday question:

Which is the outside lane? The fast one? The slow one?
