Subject:      Re: Synthetic Oil(s)

Concerning switch to synthetic oil:
I think it's very good.
I think it's better to just use synthetic oil and not to flush the engine.
You can
change the oil and filter again after a couple of thousand miles to clean
out any dirt that might accumulate in the filter.
I did this on my westy a couple of years back. It had 60,0000 miles when
I switched to synthetic oil.  The car seems to like it. I have done the
same
with another much older car, and have since put on another 70,000 miles,
and
it still runs great. I change the oil at least every 5,000 miles even with
synthetic.

&gt;
&gt; Wow! Can anyone else verify this? I just switched from conventional to
&gt; Castrol 20-50 synthetic in my Westie (55,000 miles) and didn't flush the
&gt; engine, just let it drain for two hours and changed the filter. Is this
&gt; bad?
