So Thom Fitzpatrick says:
&gt; 
&gt; Well, last night, I added in the shox and stuff I bought recently,
&gt; and the total is now a tad over $4100, and I still have about 
&gt; $500 in rubber to buy (window seals, etc) and I'm budgeting $400 for
&gt; paint!

Speakin' of taking balls Thom.  It must be irritating to have that
$500 packed in your rubber like that.  ;)
