&gt; Howdy Volks,

&gt; I have had a recent problem where my 85 Westy is sluggish to start when she
&gt; is warm.  Doesn't happen all the time.  There really seems to be no pattern
&gt; to it.  My starter checked out to be dragging, so I put a new one in two days
&gt; ago.  (Thanks Ron).  Sometimes, it won't start at all.  It just goes
&gt; 'whir,whir' as if it had a dead battery (not the case) or was suffering from
&gt; vapor lock.  Anyone have any ideas?

One of those maddening intermitant problems, eh?  It's happened to my
'83 several times, and different problem each time.  Start with basics:
check the spark, check the fuel WHEN IT WON'T START!  Then get back, and
maybe a real mechanic will give you the solution.  One of my insidious
problems was the ignition switch to engine wires take a tight 180 degree
turn around metal near the engine.  Wires were slowly parting, to the
point where they would work only when the temperature was cool.
