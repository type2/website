Subject: RE: Conversion to Dual Carbs.....Maybe


&gt;I'm running dual Solexes on my '74 1800. I ran a single Weber for years
&gt;too. The duals seem to have a bit more power and I haven't experienced any
&gt;cold weather problems. I live in a maritime climate (Seattle), but have
&gt;driven  in sub-freezing weather. I never had any real cold-weather problems 

&gt;with the single Weber either. Have you?


I ran a progressive Weber 32/36 for a few years on my '69 bus with '74 bug
engine (dual port 1600, alternator, 009, single Thunderbird QP), in
Colorado. It always started and ran fine, in temps from 20 below to 100
above. Nice top end, too-- a sweet combination.

But smog laws... It I tried that here in the People's Republic of
California, I'd probably be shot on sight. Doesn't matter that the
emissions are good enough to pass requirements for cars 15 years newer.
