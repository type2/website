Subject: RE: Buzzing Fuel Pump 

Personally, I would not hesitate to replace an electric fuel pump if there was ANY 
indication that it is going bad.  The reasons are:

	1)  Electric fuel pumps are cooled and lubricated by the fuel.  Possible fire
	concerns during failure.

	2)  A fuel pump failure might dump crap into the fuel injection system, causing
	even higher repair costs.

The last time I replaced a Bosche fuel pump, I found prices ranging from $350 (dealer) to 
$150 (mail order).  It is worth it to shop around.

&gt;Hello,
&gt;
&gt;	I just found this list and have learnded quite a lot so far.  Maybe
&gt;someone has some insight into my problem.  I have an 85 Vanagon Camper
&gt;and about two years ago the fuel pump began buzzing(like a digital alarm
&gt;clock under the floor) when the weather conditions became very hot(i.e.
&gt;&gt; 90's).  It only occured under those conditions and usually would take a while to occur 
after the engine had been started and warmed up.  Early this summer the pump started to buzz 
in cooler and cooler weather until it was buzzing all the time, right from ignition.  It is 
now very difficult for passengers to sit back there comfortably.  I have hesitated replacing 
it because of the cost($199) and the fact that I have noticed no performance problems.  Any 
ideas on other options or another diagnosis?
