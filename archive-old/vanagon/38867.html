Subject: Bus/EV Covers

Hi All,

I have been searching for a good &quot;Car Cover&quot; for my 76 Westy that won't cost
an arm and a leg.  I have mainly been trying to buy &quot;Factory Seconds&quot;
because they are so much less.  In the Process I have come across some
covers that may interest others.

Cover Craft in Canoga Park California has the following FACTORY SECONDS in
stock and the price is pretty incredible----$50.00---normally from what I
have seen these cost approx $200.  These are made from their Evolution
Material--this is one of the better materials.  They say the reason they are
factory seconds is because they have dirt on more than 3 panels and it is
not worth it to clean them.(Double check if you call them that this is the
reason on the one you are interested in)

They have 1 for a Eurovan Camper

They have one for a 1973 or before Micro Bus(Non Camper)

Standard disclaimers apply---I don't know these people but they were pulling
patterns and everything to see if either of the above would fit my
westy--and they seemed very nice.  

Phone number: 800-382-3040

ps---they will ship anywhere and they take credit cards.

Hope this helps someone out!!

Joe
