Subject: Broken cylinder head stud
Date: Wed, 30 Apr 1997 15:06:53 +1000

Hi
While fixing a head leak, I've broken a head stud on my 89 Transporter
(Vanagon), The break is just where the stud enters the crankcase.   My
local repairer says it can't be removed and I need a new motor
$(Australian)4000  (about $US3,000).

The broken stud is not corroded and the Van has only done 97,000 kilometres
(about 60,000 miles)  and has always used correct VW coolant..

Repairer says stud will be case hardened and drilling and using a stud
extractor will not work.  I think it may.

Can anyone help with practical how to do it I can't find anything in the
FAQ archives

Thanks
