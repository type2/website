Subject: 66 on the road/ HEAT!

well, the 66 standard micro, blue and white, is running, and as of today
currently registered and legal.
this is amazing, seeing as it was aquired without any papers (belonged to
PO's ex girlfriends ex husband....)  

and it has heat!!!   Not only does the gas heater work, but it's not even
neccessary.    The regular heater, which is only hooked up in the front
 (anyone have a heat cable for a 66 bus with separate front seats?), heats
great.  This is due to the lack of drafts.   Yes, a well sealed bus is so
cozy.   The doors shut well, no big rust holes,  good gray rubber seals all
around the doors,   good rubber seals around the windows.  Oh yum.  I didnt
know they could heat like this.

we took a trip to seattle, and everything kept going.  The only complaint is
a bit of noise with the clutch. hmmm.  For those who cautioned me on the
trans, it works great, shifts tight.   Opened the plug to drain the oil as
soon as we got back (nice hot oil, all stirred up)  and it looked awful,
dark, with metal specks in it.   It had been driven a toatl of ^150 miles
since the new engine.  Reduction gear boxes get drained tomorrow.    I think
the gear oil will get changed again.
