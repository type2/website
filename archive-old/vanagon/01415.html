&gt; will self said:
&gt; &gt;...I drove about 65 mph and got 22 mpg.  Coming back, I drove between 65
&gt; &gt;and 80, mostly 80, and got 21 mpg.
&gt; &gt;Are these numbers reasonable--what I can expect? ...

They look the numbers I get on my '84.  Just came back from a trip to
the coast with 4 adults, 2 kids and a shit-load of stuff and my mpg was
in the 21-22 range.
