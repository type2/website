Subject: Re: WESTFALIA ADVICE NEEDED!

&gt;
&gt;1) What to look for when checking the vehicle over?
&gt;
   Well, rust, and a motor that runs!

Given my choice, a '78 to '83 Westy retrieved from somewhere warm and dry 
would be ideal. The '78 I had ran obediently, was cheap to fix, but was 
Canadian thus rusty. If you have cash and can move quickly this list could 
help you out lots, just read the for sale ads that kind souls post to make 
us Canajuns drool on our keyboards. Pick an area (Ohio? Arizona?) and ask 
for help! The comments about the larger '80s vanagon being roomier are well 
taken, body integrity in the vanagons is way better than the older microbs. 
Less rust accumulation spots, stiffer box. Creature comforts are about equal 
in the range above, so that's not a major factor. It is nice to have the 
weight of battery, spare tire and gastank up front, vanagon style, since 
roadholding is way better. However, I like the shape of the older ones 
better also!. As for heat.... it can be just fine if everything works/is 
new! Budget for it.   good luck.  tim s.


PS: I do have an '85 waterboxer panel for sale, with a '72 westy interior, 
fully insulated, with REAL heat. Maybe this suits your pre and post vanagon 
fetish???
