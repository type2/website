&gt; This particular beastie looked to be a breadloaf bus, garishly painted (looked 
&gt; good!) with the top of a Bug welded on.....rear first, and all windows intact.  
&gt; 

don't know if it is the same bus, but there is a bus/bug setup just like
that here in huntington beach.  this particular one just sits in a local
yard.  i think it belongs to a mechanic, but do not know.  kind of wierd
looking though.  i wonder where he got his inspiration for it?.

 Take care and God Bless
