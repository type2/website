Subject: Re: freshly rebuilt 1600DP running VERY HOT!

DW&gt;&gt; manifolds' like some sort of little shroud. When I asked if they were to b
DW&gt;&gt; replaced, he said no they are not needed. They were sort of half curved
DW&gt;&gt; pipes, two of which would go around the 'manifolds'. What are they? What d
DW&gt;&gt; they do? What happens if I don't have them?

DW&gt;They sound like the heat shields for the manifolds.  As the exhaust gas
DW&gt;exits the heads into the exhaust manifold, it is as hot as it ever will
DW&gt;be.  To keep it from radiating into the area around the cylinders the
DW&gt;manifolds have a sheet metal heat shield spaced off them ~1/4 in.  If they
DW&gt;are not there, the pipes add their heat to the air that is cooling your
DW&gt;cylinders, which makes it less able to cool.  Not great, but probably not
DW&gt;immediatley fatal.  Steve sez get 'em back, put 'em on.

Unfortunately said shields are seldom in condition to get back, and
usually
fall off the car, even a low miles car.  These were a mid 70's
invention came
from '76? I know I have seen f.i. cars apparently origionally without
them and
you can't tell from earlier Type 4 with the heat exchangers coming
straight off
the heads.  I swear my '76 had them not, the '77 and '78 do, and even
the
incredible '77 had them in sad shape.  Needed, maybe not, but as Steve
says
certain to add heat without them.  I suggest for exotic types, take off
the headers
and get em ceramicoated, maybe the whole exhaust if you feel rich, for
us
normal people, get some Whitney header insulation wrap, and wrap em up.
Or just don't worry about it.
