Subject: Re: Christine

never had a car called Christine, but have been told that FIAT stands for
&quot;Fix It Again Tony&quot;

&gt;     Hmm,
&gt;
&gt;     &gt;Say, none of you folks has a type II named &quot;Christine,&quot; do you? (or
&gt;     &gt;should it be &quot;Kristine&quot;?)
&gt;
&gt;     True Story:
&gt;
&gt;     When I got my first car (A Fiat) I said to it (What, don't you talk to
&gt;     you cars too?!) I'll call you Christine. And I said show me a sign to
&gt;     tell me how you like the name...
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;     ...the cambelt snapped the same day talking out a couple of valves!
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;     Since then I call my vehicle car or bus, eg. &quot;Hi car, how are you
&gt;     feeling mate?&quot;
&gt;
&gt;     Lee.
