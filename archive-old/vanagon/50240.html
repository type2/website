 Test drove my first synchro at a ford dealership Sunday.  It was a 1989 
 Carat with 168,000 miles, asking price somewhere between 10 &amp; 12 K.
 After shifing into 4th it began making a fairly loud whinning sound, much 
 like all terrain tires make at high speed, only I'm pretty sure it was 
 coming from the transmission. The pitch varied with the speed.  The 
 salesman said all synchros do this. Was he speaking with forked tongue?
 
 Thanks for your help, &gt;&gt;

Noise in 4th gear only! Mainshaft bearing or 3/4 slider hub shot. tire noise
will occur in any gear.  Sounds like a $5K van at best to me.  Keep looking.
