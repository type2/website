With that many miles, it's time for a rebuild. A good rebuild will cost a 
few thousand dollars and should last you another 144K miles or so. I'm 
speaking in general terms here...

You might try the BarsLeak treatment and nurse your engine through a few 
thousand more miles while you save $ for the rebuild.
