Subject: RE: My new purchase...'82 diesel Westfalia

Tom Carrington  failed to note why he doesn't really want to
*drive* his new Diesel Westy to Washington: the coolant is
apparently a water/oil emulsion. 

Glad the Autotrain idea sounds good, though you ought to ask 
about the maximum allowable vehicle height...I think those 
railcars are enclosed.
