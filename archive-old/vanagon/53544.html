&gt; &gt; Hi Paul,
&gt; &gt;      I have a VW training manual that says &quot;When the difference in
&gt; &gt; speeds between the flange shaft and the pinion shaft is less than 6% the
&gt; &gt; viscosity of the silicon fluid is low. This allows the plates to slip,
&gt; &gt; resulting in no transfer of power between them. However, when the speed
&gt; &gt; difference between the two shafts beccomes greater than 6%, which could
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; but I was interested in what VW said about the 6% difference in speed. I
&gt; &gt; wonder if the coupling will not lock up with the two shafts spinning at
&gt; &gt; a 6% difference for a long distance?  I wouldn't want to try it. I think
&gt; &gt; you should get the tires matched as closely as possible. The front diff
&gt; &gt; is very expensive.

&gt; How much in tire diameter could 6% represent?

 Hi,  Would it be that the tire diameters can't be more than 6%
different in diameter? Or would gear ratios play a part in the equasion?
If it is just Tire diameters you can take the exact diameters of each
tire and mathimatically figure the percentage of the difference in size.
