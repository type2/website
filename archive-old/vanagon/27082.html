Subject: Engine temp ranges?

Got my 81 Westy back last night with newly rebuilt engine, w/o the
auxilliary oil cooler.  Cylinder head temp is running at 400 - 475 degrees
f.  This seems high compared to the last engine.  Can someone tell me what
normal range is for head temp and oil temp on an 81 Westy 2.0L ?  Also,
should I insist on the oil cooler.  It was previously mounted in a
vulnerable spot beside the engine, subject to damage by road debris.
