Subject: New Digifant bogosity

Since the start of cold weather here in NC, or maybe just coincidence,
my '86 is starting to misfire.

This one is weird, it's a momentary miss, like someone flipped the
ignition off for a fraction of a second.  It occurs at any power setting,
including idle.  If idling, the engine stalls about 1/2 the time.  At hiway
cruise it's a quick &quot;buck&quot;.  It happens at random, usually 1 to several
minutes between misses.  Stopping and letting it sit has no effect.

I've a reasonably new O2 sensor, temp sensor, and the harness fix installed.
Cap, rotor and plugs are in good shape.  The engine is new (&lt;20k) and
all the ground connections were redone last year, and appear to be good.

Last night I opened up the brainbox to look for the &quot;corroded steel lead
resistors&quot; and found no problem - plenty of pristine solder there.

(BTW - from the looks of the inside of the brainbox, it deem it unlikely
that the resistor solder joints are a common problem)

Anyone else experience this one?
