Subject: Re: Can't Remove Steering Arm...Help! 

Hey everybody,  Exuse a lowly digester barging into the scene...
				
I also fought with that steering arm while trying to swap steering boxes. 
If that is what you are trying to do, don't bother to take that arm off
while the box is still installed.  It is an exercise in futility.  The
shoulders on the arm are rounded off so even if you have a sooper-dooper
puller, and can actually get it in there, the stupid thing will pop off
every time.  If you bang around on those threads you'll have to do a lot
of filing to straighten it out. Yeah, thas right, I know from experience.
TAKE NOTE. 
   Anyway,  when you get all the bolts loose and the steering column	
disconnected that arm will actually go through the hole in the frame
when you take the unit out...(or put it in). It's like one of those 	
twisted nail puzzles.   If you just HAVE to get the arm off, have	
someone press it out/in AFTER you have extracted the box from your van. 	   

Have a day. :)	CHRIS   '71 Westy/Camper, Assorted Beetles
