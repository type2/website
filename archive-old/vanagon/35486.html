Whats wrong with your brakes?   Please do fix them ASAP.  Do they pull, or
just not stop well?   When the brakes are bled, is there a good stream at
each wheel?  I had mysterious brake problems which I eventually realised were
the result of 30 year old rubber brake hoses that were turning to putty and
leaking.   The metal lines can rust and leak too.   I am assuming that you
already checked the shoes, wheel cylinders, and master sylinder, and they
were all in good order.

:)  take care of you bus and it will take care of you  :)
