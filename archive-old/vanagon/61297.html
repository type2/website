Subject: WTB 4 spd. transmission : 81 Vanagon

upon removal of my 81 westie's transmission to replace clutch, input shaft
was discovered to be banged up. trans. rebuilders in my part of the country
have not been 
particularly helpful.

So I need a tranny, I think; water-cooled won't work, I am told.

I live in Granville Ohio

If you can help, please E-mail me or call me at 614-587-0852.

Thanks!
