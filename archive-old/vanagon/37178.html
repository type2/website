Subject: Bus FI schematics... and stuff

Well, exhausted my sources for info concerning the elusive diagrams on early
two-liter fuel injected T4 motors... Didn't hear from any netfolk for that
matter so's either everyone knows collectively zip (as much as I did) on the
vacuum hose lay-out of these beasts,  or, I'm a rotten mean person and no one
wants to talk to me... ;-(

Finally broke down and bought a case of beer, hopped n the car and drove out
to the epicenter of known VW knowledge (East Coast side) Henry's Garage where
I found Henry busy tapping away on the side of the Mr. Coffee machine...

&quot;Henry, I said&quot;, I come on a quest, and have brought spices and ..... No, wait
a minute...that's my lines from the christmas play.... &quot;Henry, I need your
advise on a technical matter&quot;  &quot;Sure, what about?&quot; &quot;Volkswagen fuel injection&quot;
I say... &quot;Got the beer?&quot; Henry says. &quot;Yup&quot; I say, forking over the working mans
champagne... &quot;Shoot&quot; he says, whereby I relate my sad predictiment about my
friend who wanted to detail his bus motor before our local `dub show this Sunday
and proceeded to rip all the wiring/hoses/stuff out of the engine compartment
before I could stop him...

&quot;Oh!&quot; Henry says, fist do this, then check that, then test for resistance at
this point, then pull the injectors and test the ECU.....blah,blah,blah...
I took notes (copious notes) and ran back head full of stuff I didn't quite
Grok, but absorbed... Tinkered here, checked there, pulled the DVOM and tested
here, and viola.... vrooom. chinka,choinka,chinka,choinka......

Anybody need a rough ASCII schematic post me, need a scanned line drawing, post
me, need serious technical assistance..buy a case of beer and call the
following number.... 1.352.622.8151 (Henry's Garage, Ocala Florida)
