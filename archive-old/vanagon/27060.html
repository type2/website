Subject: Parts interchange for a '80 -&gt; '77?

Since I have a few extra parts from the '80 Vanagon, I was wondering if a 
few would interchange.  I'm already keeping the tires for the '77.  I'm 
pretty sure that the CV joints, and fuel pump will swap also.  What about 
the rubber thing at the top of the filler neck?  It looks alot like 
what's on the '77.  The part # is 251 201 119A, maybe someone with a 
micro fishy can check it out for me.

Also, someone else was wondering if the blower motor I have would work in 
thier '82 diesel.  I don't have the part number because it's buried in my 
'72 under a pile of windows and other parts.

And, a few more parts to add to my list of available parts from the '80:

Rear hatch shocks
Arm rest from driver door
Locking gas cap
Fuel tank, w/sender
Metal filler neck
Steering rack, non-power
Clutch master and slave cylinder
Sun visors
Brake rotors
