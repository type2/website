Subject: Re: Heater removal


&gt;I'd still like an answer to this question.  Does anyone have an opinion here?
&gt;I took the heater core in the house -- it was dry.  Hooked it up to a 
&gt;faucet and kept everything dry.  I ran hot water through it until it was 
&gt;good and hot and then plugged up the outlet.  There was no air or water 
&gt;coming from the core.  Is this a good enough test?  Was that enough 
&gt;pressure?  House water temperature is probably 120F.

Another way to check for leaks is to plug the inlet and outlet holes and 
drop the core in a bowl of hot water. Air will bubble out of any small holes 
that you wouldn't otherwise notice.
