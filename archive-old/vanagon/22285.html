Subject: Southeast Trip September


Okay, this is for all the people in the southeast that complain
there are no camping trips for them.  Allen Becker, myself, &amp; a
few others are planning a BIG TRIP from August 31 thru September
10.  The trip itenerary is as follows:

August 31 	Leave Atlanta drive 2/3 way to St. Louis
September 1	Arrive in St. Louis
September 1-3	Enjoy Buses by the Arch Festivities
September 3	Leave St. Louis drive 1/3 way to Cape Hatteras
September 4	Arrive in Cape Hatteras
September 5-9	Surf, eat, sleep, Surf, eat, sleep, Surf...
September 10	Return to Atlanta

We will be travelling through Georgia, Tennessee, Kentucky, 
Illinois, Missouri, Indianna, West Virginia, Virginia, North 
Carolina, &amp; South Carolina.  That's right... 10 states in 10 days.

Consider this an open invitation to anyone that wants to join in 
the dementia.  What's that?  You have to work?  But you're young,
you've got your health... what on earth do you want with a job?

If you can't make the whole trip, but are some where within our
path of destruction, caravan with us, eat with us, camp with us,
surf with us, etc.  Don't be a weenie...  Get in your bus and have
some fun.

Dave &quot;I'll drive any bus, anywhere, any time&quot; Easterwood
