&gt;I think that beyond the restrictions of government there exists a higher set
&gt;of rules. The Earth is not at our disposal. Within a closed system no action
&gt;is ever done without consequence. Minimal impact on the system as we pass
&gt;through it is more important than getting upset at a government regulation
&gt;that, however poorly executed, is merely trying to enforce what you should
&gt;already be doing.

Bravo!  Our lives may be short and it would be nice if they are pleasurable,
but it's the essense of selfishness to think that means ruining the planet
for those who come after us.  These rules exist so that our children and
their children have a safe, clean place to live.

Tread lightly,
Ron
