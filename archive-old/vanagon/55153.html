&gt; Hi all,
&gt; 	Guess i was still wrong in my last post.  Can someone clear up 
&gt; for me a question:
&gt; 
&gt; What (if any) Eurovan and/or Vanagon comes with:
&gt; 
&gt; pop top
Weekender, Westfalia Camper (Vanagon)
Multivan, Winnebago Camper (EV)


&gt; fold down bed
See above

&gt; preferably front wheel drive
EV, or Synchro, but just about everyone will agree that the rear wheel
drive in the Vanagon works very well (snow, engine noise, etc.)

&gt; 2 rear facing seat --OR-- middle bench seat (Either way seats 7)
&gt; full fridge
&gt; stove and or sink
&gt; tables for kids to color on/play board games etc.
&gt; cup holders
&gt; cabinets
Unfortunately with the sink and stove and fridge unit installed by
Westfalia, the most people you will be able to seat are six (incl.
driver), but then the fridge and cabinets will be inaccessable.
I converted my '85 gl seven seater into a camper. I put in all the
cabinets and kitchenette, so the rear bench seats two, but I still have
the middle &quot;loveseat&quot;, which I can slide in on its rails if I need to
carry more people.  If you want all the features you listed, maybe you
could look in to a custom job...


&gt; 
&gt; If anybody knows years and models I'd appreciate.  At least then I can 
&gt; get a grip on what I'm looking for.
Any model year will wave at least a van version and a camper version...
