Vanagons and this stupid hesitation/stalling behavior. Can anyone tell me how
this can be fixed? 

I never really had this problem until I took it to the dealer for the FI recall.
I don't know what a hell this idiots did. They dont even know since they have
not been able to fix it (3 times I brought it back). Since that day, and 30K miles later, it's stalled its way thru. Today it was really bad on the interstate at about 70mph... it felt like a jackhammer.
