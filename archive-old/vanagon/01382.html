 Hi,

&gt; Earlier today I inquired about engine substitutions for type 2s. Since
&gt; then, I received reports from people who actually did install Porsche 911
&gt; (six cylinder) engines. That's great news! So let me ask a few more
&gt; questions:
&gt; 
&gt; 1. what about the transmission? Is the bus' gear ratio suitable? Can the
&gt; transmission also be replaced by the Porsche's 5 or 6-speed gear box?

 The magazine articles I have (Thanks Joel!) seem to do either. The standard
4-speed bus gearbox or the Porsche G-50 (which I assume is a standard 5 speed
Porsche box). I think that in a '68-'79  (actually, that's effectively '71 to
'79 since no-one seems to think a 150bhp engine and over a tonne of car is
sensibly combined with four-wheel-drums...:-) they mostly keep the VW whereas
in the vanagons they usually put in the G-50. I suspect that's mostly because
the vanagon can be driven fast enough to benefit from the higher top gear.
Note that later bread loaf buses have a stiffer final drive.
 I'd be very interested to know whether the G-50 bolts up to the VW driveshafts
(or to the bellhousing?) or needs some sort of adapter.

&gt; 2. Is the 6-cylinder engine significantly heavier than the original 4?
&gt; If so, should the shock absorbers be replaced by stronger ones?

 I think it is heavier, but virtually all of the articles feature suspension
upgrades to handle the extra performance: I think the better shocks are to
that end rather than to support the extra weight. If a stronger suspension
was needed for the weight it would surely be the torsion bars that were
upgraded anyway, and remember that they are rated to support a loaded panel
van, in Europe &quot;vanagons&quot; were actually used as vans! :-)

 I'm researching building a flat-six bus as a future project (I'm going round
the world in a few months so I don't expect to start for a couple of years or
so) so I'm very interested to hear more about this situation. My current plan
is:

 Start with breadloaf bus (cool).
 Fit lowered front suspension with servo discs
 Uprate shocks, fit anti-roll (US: sway) bars
 Fit &quot;performance&quot; tyres
 Lighten upper bodywork to improve stability
 Fit 2.4 or 2.7 litre six, detuned for torque &amp; reliability.
 
 Any suggestions, recommendations etc. gratefully accepted - I'm not sure about
using a breadloaf as a starting point, for example, I really would prefer to
have one but the bricks handle much better and have more modern interiors.
Hopefully I'll get on the net when I come back so I hope to reappear in a
couple of years time (maybe less if I can get work in New Zealand) I'll let
you guys know when I'm leaving, anyway!

Cheers,
        W.
