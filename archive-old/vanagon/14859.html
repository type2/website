Richard,

We showed up Sunday at about 2pm to see if anyone was still at
Umstead and to do a little hiking. Sorry we missed the rest of you.
I think the '76 that Janet and Dave were driving is the one I sold
them back in December. Glad to hear it's looking good!

Originally we were headed to New Bern to camp this weekend but
plans have changed and I might go to Farmington for the day. Do you
have the details available: location, time, etc?

Thanks,

Jeff H.
