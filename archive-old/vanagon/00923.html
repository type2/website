&gt; Anyone heard of these or use them?

Our '88 westfalia came with Continentals.  We replaced them with Michelin
XZX reinforced when time came.  The XZXs are OK but not great.  We
recently replaced the rear tires with Bridgestone RD-603 185R14 tires,
which are heavy-duty tires designed originally for the Toyota 1-ton
pickup.  Their load rating is somewhat greater than the OEM Continentals
(and considerably higher than the XZXs).  They seem to handle well and 
so far have worn very little.  We're happy with them.

I was told about the Michelin LTX 195-14 by a list member (don't remember
who) who liked them a lot.  We couldn't get them in time for a
trip, so we got the Bridgestones.
