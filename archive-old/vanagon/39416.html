Subject: Re: Preferred Pop-Tops '68-'79

...you'll get a lot of different opinions on this one, but I like the &quot;full&quot;
poptop, the one that pops up on both ends, not just on one. plenty space up
there to sit around and play cards (and other things) with the wind going
thru your hair and the mosquitos buzzing outside...
