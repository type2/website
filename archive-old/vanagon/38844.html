i thought this list determined that &quot;Obsessive/Compulsive&quot; was the 
correct diagnosis?  Which is it?  I mean, we can't be using the 
incorrect term when the correct term is available, can we?  That's 
what's wrong with society nowadays, we settle for the mediocre and 
'pretty good'.  Where has exactness gone?  Orderliness?  Linear 
concrete thinking?  I mean I'm not being obsessive about this am I?  
Or is it compulsive?
