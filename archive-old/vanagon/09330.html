&gt; 	Friends,
&gt; 	You'll recall I bought the '70 single cab sans motor. I'm planning
&gt; to pull the axle with visibly torn boots and have boots and/or CVs replaced.
&gt; I'm also going to bleed brakes and grease anything with a grease fitting.
&gt; 
&gt; 	1: How can I tell if I need to replace the front (fif) 
&gt; transmission mount?
&gt; 
&gt; 	2: Should I go ahead and do both axles, all 4 CVs, at the same
&gt; time?

YES!!  This is indeed the best time to do so; if you pull the 
tranny/engine as a unit, you must (obv.) disconnect the tranny from the 
CVs anyway.  

&gt; 
&gt; 	3: Should I just go ahead and replace the clutch and accelerator
&gt; cables?

YES!!  And buy a spare for each.  You may consider replacing your clutch 
cross shaft bushings if you detect any play.  


&gt; 	4: As long as the engine bay's empty, does anyone have
&gt; recomendations on treating the light surface rust in the void behind
&gt; the gas tank? Or do I think too much? :-)

Your basic rust removal techniques would apply; whether manual or 
chemical.  Nothing like a sparkling clean/grease-free engine 
compartment.  

&gt; 
&gt; 	Between holidays, rain and a cold, I've done nothing for my
&gt; new jewel except clean the windows and take its picture.
&gt; 
&gt; 	Is there anything else *you'd* do if you had the engine out?

One can purchase a new engine compartment wiring loom--not a bad idea on 
a '70 vehicle; replace ground strap (they get reeeeeeal nasty) and 
perhaps battery cables.  Upgrade all engine compartment seals, check 
for/de-rust your battery tray (HVW had a clever suggestion to put a 
modified plastic &quot;tray&quot; fashioned from the bottoms of old milk jugs).  

Use lotsa elbow grease and smile, smile, smile (or rather, clean, clean, 
clean!!)


&gt; 	Finally, I need a nose VW emblem, sunvisor clips, a shift knob
&gt; and isn't there supposed to be a sheet-metal cover under the pedals and 
&gt; master cylinder? If anyone has such, to fit a '70 or similar, let
&gt; me know!
&gt; 
I can take one of those--da belly pan.  I pulled one from a VW parts 
yard.  Looks funny at first, but my function-over-form attitude allows 
for it.
