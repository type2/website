&gt;I should've pursued the lemon law on this one....oh well!
&gt;
&gt;Any advice or similar stories?


While I can only count the side window decals &quot;balling up&quot; as
the only shared misery with your GL, I'd say your biggest gripe
is probably your A/C blowing up, huh?  Considering it's D.C. in
the middle of summer, I'd be on the dealer to fix it mondo el
pronto.

The only other annoyance has been the infamous temp/gas gauge
defect, and the fix for that has been discussed several times on the
list already.

'Haven't owned VWs since 16 (20), but the MV we have actually
has the best track record of the four VWs I've owned; the H2O-cooled
ones have all been kind of weird the first two years (while under
warranty), but have been near perfect since.  Very strange... not
that I'm complaining, mind you.

Perhaps you might want to approach the regional service rep about
your EV...hey, you never know...

Good luck,
Norman
