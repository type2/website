Subject:       HELP: '67 Deluxe Saga - Vaporlocking?

Hello all.

Yes, more bad news from Utah.  As I attempt to prepare the '67 Deluxe 
to sell, I am having yet more trouble with this stupid 1600 that I 
bought.

I'll be brief.  After $400 for engine, $100 for tune-up/carb rebuild, 
it is still having trouble.

* It starts, idles runs fine at first.
* Drive it on freeway/highway, and get the engine warm/hot.  
* Stop at stop light.  Idles fine.
! Hit the gas pedal to take off, 90% stall, 10% barely runs.
! Now it takes 20 seconds of constant turning over, at full thorottle 
  to get it to start.  Pumping pedal does nothing.
* Barely cranks up, and runs, and then it roars to life, and you 
  are just fine, like nothing ever happened... Until the next 
  stoplight!!! 
  
On separate note:
* Drive, get engine hot.  Turn off engine.  Takes 20 seconds to re-
start it, per above description.

Friends suggestion: The fuel pump is getting very hot, and is 
vaporlocking, hence the 20 second start up time.

He suggests an electric fuel pump.

Apparently the bug that this engine came out of had an electric fuel 
pump in place of the mechanical one.  Hmmmm.  Looks like this problem 
is not new with this engine.

So, is there a way to fix w/o the fuel pump, or shall I just do it?

I tried to install it last night, but after dowsing myself in 
gasoline several times whist trying to hook up the fuel-line to the 
fuel-pump, I decided to wait until I can get a clamp to squeeze the 
fuel-line!

Any suggestions WELCOME!
