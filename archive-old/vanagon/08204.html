Subject: Re: Engine transplant operation

&gt;&gt;a new alternator. I paid $650 for all the engine related parts off
&gt;&gt;the donor vehicle.


&gt;&gt;1. Air box, metal braket and associated injection parts (F.I. &quot;Brain&quot;)
&gt;&gt;2. Fuel tank and fuel pump.
&gt;&gt;3. Exhaust system.
&gt;&gt;4. Transmission support brace.
&gt;&gt;5. etc.

&gt;Who dropped the engine out? I would have expected to get ALL of the engine, 
&gt;FI brain right through to the tail pipe(s) for $650. Every bit, no 
&gt;exceptions. Hell, demand the tranny and shafts be thrown in for free. You 
&gt;will need the fuel pump, the tank???, just take all the plumbing you can 
&gt;find. Any other opionions on the tank out there? 

  The guy parting out the '78 Westy knows what I'm trying to accomplish.
*ANY* parts I need to get the engine into the '73 Westy are fair game
(from the FI brain to the tailpipe).

  It seems that the '78 fuel tank had additional fittings connected to
the fuel delivery system that the '73 did not. I will take that fuel
tank and use it rather than defeat the purpose of the FI system's extra
fuel lines.

&gt;Some years had a brace, 
&gt;others didn't, Will your transmission bolt to a '78 brace at all, or is this 
&gt;where MIG/TIG comes in? The closest I've come to your situation was putting 
&gt;an '75 1800 FI engine into a '72 1700 bus. I kept the old double carbs on 
&gt;however, since I too was stiffed for the FI.  Fitting the FI components onto 
&gt;your engine compartment surfaces may take some diligence. I don't have my 
&gt;old Bentley for those years to check the procedures in detail. 

  There's a metal brace approx 1&quot;x12&quot; that the FI air box attaches to. 
It's coming out of the '78 and welded into the '73.

  The heads are different (1.7 vs 2.0) so I can't re-use the intake manifolds.
I suppose I could re-use the dual Weber 40 carburetors and get 2.0 manifolds
but there's no smog equipment then.  Part of the reason for this exercise
is to get the smog back on the car.
  BTW - Anyone out there want a pair of slightly used 2bbl Weber 40s and
the associated linkage?

&gt;Go for it, a 2.0 liter engine is as good as life gets in a van, 70-75 mph &gt;cruising, bearable mileage, easier tune-ups.  tim s.

That's what I keep hearing about and am hoping for.  :)

&gt;Do you really want to mess with the fuel injection?  Why not use the heads
&gt;intake and carbs from the old motor?

I had stock electronic fuel injection on a '71 Type III (squareback) 
and it wasn't that much of a problem.  I'll give it a whirl in the Westy.

One major reason for the FI 2.0 is so I can pass smog inspection in Calif.
I looked into replacing the 1.7 smog equipment and it was very expen$ive.
