Subject:      Expansion Coolant Tank

For quite some time now my 88 westy has been loosing coolant from the
expansion tank.  After just a few days of city driving the expansion
tank is bone dry. There does not appear to be any leaks at all. Here is
the curious thing: The temp gauge is showing normal operating temps
(just above the red LED on the gauge). The secondary expansion tank (the
one connected to the expansion tank with some kind of sending unit on
top is always filled with coolant.  I noticed that around the sending
unit there is a small amount of  coolant leak.  I removed the expansion
tank to see if it was cracked it looked to be solid.  I filled it
(removed) with water and there are no drips.  However on top of the tank
I noticed that there are three small holes on a tab that extends up from
the tank.  Should there be some kind of cover that plugs these holes?
Could the coolant be evaporating out of the tank through these holes
(due to engine heat)?  Any ideas would be appreciated.
