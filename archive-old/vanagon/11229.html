a friend of mine bought two 1974 VW Vans (Campmobile &amp; Kombi) for $350
CANADIAN (right up there in value w/ the Ruble and the Mexican Peso). Took
the the two cars and made one. He drove that puppy from Toronto to Mexico,
from Mexico to BC, from BC back to Toronto, and then once again from
Toronto back up to Northern Ontario. If you looked at that van you'd think
it wouldn't go 50 feet (the return spring on the gas pedal was gone, so he
has a bungee cord to do the job). Truly amazing!!

&gt;&gt; Well, I got a Wyse50 (read:ancient technology) for free to read mail
&gt;&gt; with. I expect everyone else to do better, as I also have the only
&gt;&gt; 150.00$US RUNNING (1994 US dollars) Volkswagen bus! There. Now who
&gt;&gt; has the cheapest RUNNING, STREET LEGAL, Volkswagen bus??????
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; When I bought my bus 4 years ago, it cost me 100 quid. It was a
&gt; runner, empty inside and had a large dent in the middle panel.
&gt; Sometimes I think its not got much better!
&gt;
&gt; A friend went out to Chamonix (French Alps) about three years
&gt; ago, and got a 71 lhd, English registed bus from a German
&gt; for 100$ US (How's that for cosmopolitan?). He drove the bus
&gt; back to England, spent a fortune on MIG welders, compressers,
&gt; angle grinders etc, took everything rotten of the bus and ...
&gt; well thats as far as it got. Its been in a barn ever since.
