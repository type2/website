&gt; Hi All,
&gt; I am compiling a description of USA Vanagons for the model year 1991 and
&gt; would like
&gt; to inlcude the MSRP (Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price) for the vans
and
&gt; all of the options.  If anyone has an original window sticker or other
&gt; reliable price data, I'd love to hear from you.
&gt; 
&gt; I do have the standard 1991 Vanagon brochure.
&gt; 
&gt; Also, I have not been able to confirm the existence (or non-existence) of
a
&gt; 1991 Vanagon Wolfsburg Edition.  If anyone has a 1991 Vanagon Wolfsburg
&gt; Edition (or a 1991 Wolfsburg brochure), I'd really appreciate hearing
about
&gt; it.
&gt; 
&gt; Thank you very much,
&gt; 
&gt; Jim Davis
