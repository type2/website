&gt;boy, can you imagine the torque and grunt that thing would have! :) i'm

An older issue of European Car details a very clean California conversion
of a Syncro.  It was to a 3.2 litre Porsche engine, 230HP. Fitted under the 
standard engine hatch, so's your bed doesn't get lumpy. Gets rid of all 
those annoying water leaks too I guess. Not many 4x4s can match that kind of 
power without much mods.  Nice feature was they quoted 19mpg vs 14 mpg in 
stock shape, over 400 mile trip. Staying out of 3rd gear on the hills when 
fully loaded helps. I can dig up the address for the conversion kit for 
those of you with substantial disposible income!
  I used to drive a '71 Westy to its bellypan in mud hauling a dirt bike 
around. Keeping your speed up and steady, and not stopping in the middle of 
the soft stuff will get you an amazing long way. FourWD is not the only 
answer. A good bus and short (4') sand tracks got someone I met once from 
South Africa to North over mostly desert/mud tracks. He said it was fun 
passing bogged down Landrovers on the sand when they had chugged to a halt 
in low range 4WD. Buried to the axles while the mighty microbus had made it 
up at speed, the front end floating on top of the sand, the back end pushing 
against sand that didn't have time to shift out of the way. Another trick he 
passed on was using a front electric winch and boat anchor, gets you a grip 
to pull against even if a tree or vehicle is not available. Still got to 
walk  back and dig out the anchor once you're clear though. Same for the 
sand tracks.  ( Same trip met an old Austrian Schwimmvagen pilot from WWII, 
but that's another story...)
        Finally, have owned seven buses, '71 to '85, I feel the earlier ones 
will readily outperform the Vanagons in nasty stuff. The vanagon to microbus 
is what the Saab 9000 is to the old Saab 96, not an offroad rally vehicle. 
Way better on the road however! So wadda ya want?   tjs
