Subject: Re: palmershirts....

&gt;Please add my thanks to Richard for the T-Shirt.  It's already a hit
&gt;at the workplace.... My family does not know about it yet, so it

I brought mine to work today and hung it on my cube wall - got lots of 
comments (couldn't wear it cause we're suits only).  My children thought it 
was great, my wife just gave her &quot;knowing&quot; smile.........
