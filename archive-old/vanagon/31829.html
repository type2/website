Subject: 85 wkendr engine?

Hi everyone - I'm a 1st timer here so bear w/ me. I own an a 1985 Westy 
WEEKENDER (4 spd. manual tranny) that needs a new/rebuilt engine OR 
(supposedly) A NEW ENGINE BLOCK. I was cruising home from work on April 12, 
1995 - lost power, dense white smoke billowing, etc. I thought I had blown a 
head gasket - not an unusual problem apparently(?). I had it taken a shop &quot;VW 
Specialties&quot; here in Dover DE where EVENTUALLY they told me that the alum. 
HEAD AND BOLTS had ROTTED THROUGH (apparently 'cause of phosphate in the anti-
freeze?) and could not be machined to get fixed, etc. SOOOOOOOO - does all of 
this seem plausible? Am I boring you?

NOW - I NEED TO GET IT FIXED - I rented a car for the &quot;SHORT&quot; while it would 
take to get get it fixed which turned into over a month before they said they 
couldn't do it after all. So I bought an 85 Subaru wagon. Now I'm paying back 
my creditcard rental bill + car/insurance payments BUT I WANT MY VAN BACK. 
Having owned a 66 Bus (passed on), mint 84 Vanagon GL (totalled in an UGLY 
accident) before this Wkendr., I know parts are less than affordable WHEN 
AVAILABLE AT ALL.  I haven't had any luck in tracking down engine/block 
around here.  

ANY IDEAS - SUGGESTIONS - HELP - ADVICE - PARTS - GOOD SHOPS - WHATEVER would 
be GREATLY APPRECIATED.  I'm in DELAWARE and work for State Parks/DE National 
Estuarine Research Reserve doing Environmental Education.  Thanks again -
