&gt; &gt; yeah!!!! a white lithium grease devotee, i could start a whole thread on
&gt; &gt; white lithium grease, right up there with prune juice. ;) the usefullness
&gt; &gt; of lithium grease is only limited to your imagination, and lithium grease
&gt; &gt; is cheap!
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; I agree!  I use this stuff to pack my door latches, lube all the 
&gt; hinges, and strikers.  It's great :)

Not to be a naysayer but lithium grease has a major, major problem,
It gets HARD, REAL REAL HARD, over time, VW even recognizes this, my
Corrado shifter linkage was origionally lubed with lithium based grease
but VW later put out a TSB about cleaning all lithium from the linkage
and lubing with a quality molybenedum (sp?) product.  Something to note
though, they are not compatible, lithium must be cleaned off fully. I
too have personally noticed litium grease after 4 or 5 years will turn
to an almost glue like sticky substance not the hot ticket, plus tubs
or tubes of the cheap moly stuff are only twice the price of the
lithium.  However lithium is available in spray and I must admit even I
use it on hard to reach hinges and such, and the moly stuff is real
messy and doesn't clean up that well but is largely impervious to water
on the positive side.

Just some thoughts anyway.
