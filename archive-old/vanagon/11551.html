&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Has anyone ever went to a job interview drving their breadloaf?
&gt; &gt;


Yep, at some high security R&amp;D firm. Parked /dev/bus complete with 
primer, rust, an Engle Cam decal, a Bug Out bumpersticker, and a 
Newfoundland flag sticker right in front in a visitor's spot....

Walked right past her on the way to lunch. Offered to drive, but...

Anyway, I got the job and start next Monday. (Joy, Joy Joy, I'm trading a 
1.5 hour commute for a 10 minute one-- /dev/bus is thrilled...)
