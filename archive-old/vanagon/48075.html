You should check out the entire starting system in you van.  Check the 
battery, the cables, the connections, the starter switch, the starter
and all the cables and relays in between those components.  Make sure 
you have good solid bare metal to metal connections.  If all of your 
connections are right then you'll have to eliminate the offending 
component(s).  Start with the battery, then the starter, then the
switch.

If you don't want to ride in tow trucks, then you have to get your
hands and face dirty.  And even then, that is not guarantee.  But the
likelyhood will go way down.
