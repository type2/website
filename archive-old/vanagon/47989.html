Reckon I'll cc the list on this since it's the second inquiry. I'm going to 
hang on to all the parts I replaced with my headlight swap. I have this 
notion that about 20 years from now, I may want to restore it to stock 
condition. Silly idea maybe, but many a time I've wished I saved pieces 
from my '74 that I've tossed off over the years.

Want to sell your square headlight hardware?
