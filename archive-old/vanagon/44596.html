&gt; '68 Velvet Green origional paint and everything Westy
...

I went and took a look at this bus today, and am awed and humbled by it and
all the &quot;stuff&quot; they have to go with it.  The price isn't a problem for me,
because I'm willing to pay for something that won't break down or rust to
pieces while I'm not looking, and this thing is not far from total first
place show quality.  But, I don't feel worthy of something so nice.  So I'm
writing in hope of getting a little moral support and encouragement, and
maybe an offer of instruction in doing right by this bus.

I'm only just getting into busses, I've had a rusty '76 westy for a year
or so, but it's totally beat and way beyond my interest or skills in
restoring.  So I don't want to buy this perfect '68 and have it ruined by
my inexpertise.  It was practically a religious experience talking with
that old couple and having them show me the bus and all the parts in
perfect condition, the tent which hasn't EVER been out of its bag...

I feel like I'm stealing statues from a church if I take this bus.

So if I pick it up, and the truckload of original parts and extras like
rotors and racks and stuff, how do I learn how do fix it up right the
first time?  I'm in Virginia just outside D.C., is there anyone in the
Baltimore/Washington area willing to provide some guidance?  I would be
interested in making it as perfect, number one show quality as I can
without spending too many thousands of dollars...

TIA for any advice-

	-Jeff
