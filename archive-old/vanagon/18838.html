Subject: Re: Right fuel pump?

Gerald,

I recently replaced my fuel pump and had a hard time finding an exact match
for some reason too.  What I ended up doing is replacing it with an electric
fuel pump.  I left the old fuel pump bolted to my engine and mounted the
electric fuel pump on the frame of my bus.  It's a lot cheaper and will last
much longer than any mechanical fuel pump you can buy.  Pep Boys, Checker,
and others sell a generic fuel pump called an EP-10 that sells for about $16.
 It makes a buzzing sound when it operates, so you'll have to mount it on the
frame like I did.  Otherwise, It'll drive you nuts.  Not only will it last
longer, It'll be a hell of a lot easier to replace next time.
