Subject: Re: '77 Bus (with 78 Engine) Clutch pedal doesn't return


&gt;replace it because I kinked it). I adjusted the wing nut and took all 
&gt;the slack out of the cable and the pedal still had several inches of 
&gt;slop in it. 
&gt;
&gt;I called my mechanic about an alleged spring on the pedal return, and 
&gt;there isn't one on a 77. I do have the spring on the arm the clutch 
&gt;cable pulls (on the clutch itself).
&gt;
If you have proper clearance in the back, about 1/8 to 1/4 of an inch at the
lever, your cable is probably coming apart. It was very common for them to
fail in front where the pedal assembly bolts to the frame. You can't see it
without removing the pedal. 
There is only one spring on the clutch system, besides the pressure plate
springs. That's the spring on the arm on the transmission. If you remove the
pedal assembly from the bus, take it completely apart and clean and lube the
bushing and shaft where it pivots. They like to crud up there.
