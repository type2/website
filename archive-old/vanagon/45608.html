Subject: 1 lb propane bottles

Ron,

When you mention 1 lb. tanks, are you talking about the disposable cylinders
for lanterns, portable stoves, etc. that are available almost everywhere or
are you talking about something else?

If you mean the 1 lb. cylinders, there is a special fitting available that
screws into the top of the one pounder and has a valve feeding to the
regular LH threaded propane outlet.  This is advertised as an &quot;emergency
fitting&quot; that will allow you to feed your camper from 1lb bottles until you
can get the regular large propane bottle refilled.  

Your stove was probably originally equipped to use the 1 lb bottles.  Maybe
you could get parts from the mfr. to convert it back.  

Suggest you look for a &quot;real&quot; propane dealer to get the parts and service
you need.  RV and boating stores are sometimes OK but more often not when it
comes to propane equipment. Look in the Yellow pages under GAS-BOTTLED or
GAS-PROPANE for dealers.  Find one who deals in parts and service as well as
gas supply.  Take your stove with you when you go to see them to make sure
they get the right stuff.  You may have to go on down to the older
industrial area of your town to find them.

Let me know if you still can't get what you need.
