&gt;Right to the problem: Every time I exit the freeway, the oil pressure

&gt;stopped the engine, and checked the oil (always fine). I turn the engine 
&gt;on again after a minute or two and everything is fine (no light, no 
&gt;buzzer). Is this my vans way of telling me it doesn't want to leave the 
&gt;freeway? 8-) Any advise of information is appreciated.

Sounds like you may have a viscosity and or wear issue.  What oil are you
using and how hot is your engine getting?  The whole idea of that &quot;Dynamic&quot;
system is to give you some warning before it's too late.  Check actuall oil
pressure with a aguge and the engine &quot;HOT&quot;  A healthy engine with 20-50 will
hold 10 to 15 psi at idle and 35-50 psi at 3000 rpm.
