You need to unclog the drain tubes.  Remove the side vent grills, reach in and 
pull out the bottom of the plastic hoses.  Remove the rubber check valves and 
clean out the debris.  This should be done seasonally.  Resist the temptation 
to remove these checks thinking they are not needed.  Without them, the fan on 
high and the van traveling at highway speeds pulls enough air through the 
tubes backwards that the condensate pan can not drain.  The weight of the 
water filling the tubes will open the valves unless they are hard from age.  
If they need to be replaced, they are cheap.  They are actually the old 
crankcase breather vent used on Bug engines.

Hi All,

Just wondering if any of you have noticed their A/C dripping *alot* after
driving long periods.  After driving for 4 to 8 hours in hot temperatures,
say over 100 deg, our '85 Westi A/C seems to rain water down (or, at least
I think it's water -- didn't seem greasy or smell weird).  The amount of
water seemed to be too much to be explained by condensation as suggested
by the VW repair guy.  Perhaps this indicates some kind of service or
cleaning is in order?  Idea's much appreciated, as usual!

Thanks,
Ivan
