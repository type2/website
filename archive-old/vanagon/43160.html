&gt;
&gt; Westfalia Owners everywhere know how *outrageously* expensive
&gt; parts for their beloved buses can be.
&gt; I have compiled sources for used parts (salvage yards nationwide), as
&gt; well as sources for new &quot;aftermarket&quot; poptop seals and canvas.
&gt; For INFO, please REPLY (E-Mail me) and include *POPTOP INFO* in
&gt; the Subject field.

Hmm.  I was in the market for some canvas for my '71 Westy a couple of weeks
ago and tried to call this guy's &quot;BBS&quot;, but got an answering machine or
voice mail.  I left a message asking if his canvas tops had the plastic
beading at the bottom.  (Early bays had it as a separate piece; mine's sewed
to the fabric.)  His order taker at the 800 number in the ad just said, &quot;I
don't really know but if the original had it, this one should have it, too.&quot;
I just wanted to get a more definitive answer before plunking down $202.
Never heard from him, so I ended up ordering one from VW Canvas in TX for
$240 after talking to someone there who said definitely that theirs had the
beading.  I might have saved some money if I'd had his e-mail address.  I
guess my point is if you call the BBS number, don't be surprised if you get
an answering machine instead.  BTW, about a year ago I ordered and received
a poptop seal from McCulloch's with no problems.
