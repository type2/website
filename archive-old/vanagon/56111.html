&gt; &gt; The water pump in my '86 GL has got to go.  I've got a new pump on the way,
&gt; &gt; I've printed out the FAQ, got the Bentley warmed up, I *think* I'm ready.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;  I plan to remove and replace the pump.  Since I've got the system open
&gt; &gt; anyway, I will drain, refill and bleed the cooling system.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;  Am I missing anything?  Does anyone have any last words of advice before I
&gt; &gt; begin?

&gt;         I Wish you all the luck in the world!!! I have just done that
&gt; job while stranded in eastern north carolina
&gt; it took me 7.5 hours it take a lot patience one suggestion I have is to
&gt; have two 6mm allen wrenches one keep in original size and the other, cut
&gt; the short section in half so that it will allow you to reach in tight
&gt; spots
&gt;  when replacing the new pump loosly fit the hose with the flat gasket
&gt; first
&gt; GOOD LUCK OLD CHap!

Just did mine on my 86GL.  I used air tools so I wouldn't know about
modifying wrenches.  But, you will need to loosen the hose clamps on the
small pipe on the right in order to remove the pump.  My clamps were
facing in the wrong direction to access, ended up cutting them and
replacing the piece of hose. DON'T TIGHTEN ANYTHING UNTIL YOU HAVE IT
ALL TOGETHER.  I made that mistake and had a bitch of a time putting in
the last hex bolt on the larger flange.  Also, you don't have to remove
the AC but it will give you more room to work if you do.

Best of luck, you will scrape knuckles.
