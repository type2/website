Subject: hakuna matata

Don't know what language it's in, but presumably it is in Swahili as the
Disney people usually do their homework.  It is a song title in *The Lion
King* movie/video, so most parents of 3-8 year olds in the US can sing at
least a few words of it.  &quot;Hakuna Matata means no worries&quot;, during the
period that Simba is partying with his pals, eating grubs and ignoring his
birthright.  Hope I haven't given away too much of the plot.
