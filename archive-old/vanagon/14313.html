 Dean,

 I'd like details on the rear bearing carrier modifications when you have
 time. If you'd rather not post to the list. I'm at dkautz_at_hpsidms1.sid.hp_dot_com


 Thanks,

 Dave





&gt; four front axle tubes, one in the middle of the lower tube and a couple that 
&gt; I had installed in the rear bearing carriers so I could grease the rear 
&gt; bearings without taking them apart.  TIA
