Subject: 6V/12V Gauges the final (part 2)

Do you reckon we can cause a crash on the prices of &quot;rare&quot; 12v fuel
fuel gauges! I still don't understand why VW stamped their 12v gauges
with &quot;12V&quot; if it had a Zenner across it - I guess it was to cover there
arses in the case of a melt-down.

Cheers to all the Fuel gauge Wizards,

Lee.
