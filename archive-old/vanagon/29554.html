Subject: 1990 Vanagon Engine Clatter, Help!

Hello Vanatics,

I need your HELP.

Well I've finally got the new-to-me 1990 engine installed in my 87 Syncro.
It started up just fine but is making a lot of clattering.  I think it's just
valve lifters, but I'm not sure.  I've run it a total of about 12-15 minutes
in 75-80 degF weather (to install the coolant) and the clattering hasn't gone
away yet.  Yes, I did install new oil, and no the oil pressure light is NOT
on.
I'm not sure how long this engine has sat before firing it up today.  I got 
it from the auto wrecker about 6-8weeks ago &amp; my guess is that
it has been at least several months since it ran.
My question is, how long could lifter clatter last in an engine that hasn't 
run in many months?  How can I tell if it's something more serious?

Any &amp; all help appreciated.
