Subject: Re: Blizzard of '96


&gt;&gt;a standard trick to show a newbie in Jan or Feb, was to get a cup of hot
&gt;&gt;coffee at the mess hall, walk outside, and pitch the coffee out of the 
cup,
&gt;&gt;up in the air while it was about 40 below. A huge burst of steam, a
&gt;&gt;crackling
&gt;&gt;sound, and freeze-dried coffee fell all around you. Also, sometimes, the
&gt;&gt;empty mug would shatter in your hand. This tended to pi** off the cooks.
&gt;
&gt;I hear (being careful of the PC pitbulls) that a similar thing happens if
&gt;one &quot;relieves&quot; oneself outside in such weather.  You tensd to do this only
&gt;once 'cause the shattered &quot;coffee mug scenario&quot; (or insert your own
&gt;euphemism) is a probable outcome.


Ouch... wonder how the cave men managed 1,000,000 years ago--
they must have had much better heaters in their VWs than we do.
Then again, the cars inevitably had to be a LOT newer then...
