Subject: Vanagon Air-flow meter

Hello, I have been having some problems with my vanagon. It has had a
re-built engine for a year now. I drive it for a couple of miles and it feels
as if i have the emergency brakes on! The brakes are fine, it seems the
warmer the engine gets the more power it loses. I have retuned it several
times and cannot isolate the problem. One mechanic finally told me that the
air box was not responding to anything. I had a spare and installed it. Now ,
plenty of power, but it seems to idle sort of rough, not too bad but not just
right. I am contemplating getting a new Air-flow meter does anyone know where
i could get one without robbing a bank? As they are very expensive! One that
is rebuilt could be an option here right now, financial situation. Thanks in
advance!
