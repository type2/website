Subject: Watercooled Bubble Window Bus Sited

I had lunch with Jim Kirk (not James T.) yesterday. He showed me some photos
from his recent vacation to South Carolina. My favorite was a red bubble
window bus he spotted on Sullivan's Island. It was definately water cooled.
Had a big black grill on the front with VW logo in the middle. Above it was
a horizontal rectangulare black grill with large squarish turnsignals. The
bumpers were larger, black and looked to be some kind of poly material. Most
of the chrome parts were black instead. I liked it!!

I had heard that they still make these south of the border with water cooled
motors. I wonder if these use Vanagon engines ore is this more like a Wabbit
motor?
