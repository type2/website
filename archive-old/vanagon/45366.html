Subject: HELLLLLP!!  PLEASE READ THIS!

Hey all,
OK, first, please send all replies to s_bartnik_at_wow_dot_com.  Now, here's what I
screwed up.

Today I began installation of my new oil temp gauge with sump plate sender in my
'78 bus.  Well, the instructions supplied for the sump plate sender are quite
specific and even include a life-sized template of sorts to help you visualize.
Well, I drilled my hole and then went to put the plate back on the car but I
DRILLED IN THE WRONG SPOT!!!!!  I was apparently looking at the template from
the wrong point of view.  This was after extensive checking and rechecking to
make sure that I did it right :( .  So now I have a junk sump plate.  And I was
going to take my bus on a road trip Friday :( :( .  Now, I need to find a
replacement sump plate.  I believe anything from '72 to '79 will fit, and maybe
even air-cooled vanagons.  I will try to locate one locally tomorrow but I don't
think I'm going to have too much luck.  I think it's either going to be a
junkyard item or a dealer item (God, I don't even want to know
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$).  I was about sick when I realized that it wasn't right.
Please, if you can help me, let me know asap.

Thanks,
Sean
