Subject: Should it stay or Should it go?


Ever since it was confirmed that I leaking heads (about 2 months ago) I 
have been pondering on what to do with this 85 of mine.
It has almost 144K miles, have not had any puddles of green stuff ( but 
it does drip every once in awhile), and I have noticed to loss of power 
or anitfreeze in the oil ( at least not significant enough for me to 
notice).  Now come the questions:
	1. If I replace the heads, how long will it be before my engine 
	   goes to hell?
	2. My VW dealer quoted me a price of $800 for replacing my heads, 
	   while other VW mechanics have given me nothing less than $1200.
	   I'm no genius but I think I am missing something.
	3. Will an engine rebuild be better-How much? How long will it last?
Thanx to everyone on the list for your assistance.
