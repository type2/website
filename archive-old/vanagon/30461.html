Well Sean
I am a list member.  Do you really think I can't spell?
I intended on printing,&quot;breaks&quot; I give my van breaks every few days to catch
his breath
and I was saying he just had a new break so he's well rested.
By the way the van just had new brakes too.
Yes also I can't spell or type for shit.
Fred.

&gt;far as I know I'm not busting on a list memeber.  If I am, sorry.
