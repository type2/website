&gt;&gt;On the up side, I hear it's supposed to be available w/ the VR6  :-)

&gt;On the down side, I hear it's NOT coming to the USA.  Finally VW produces a
&gt;minivan with a potential for mass USA market appeal (it has that
&gt;all-important style thing) and they won't sen it to the USA.  :-(

Maybe part of the joint deal with Ford is not selling in the US and no
Windstar in Europe? OK by me.  One of the reasons GM is still selling Astro
vans like crazy is becasue they haven't shrunk 'em like the rest.  If VW
gets its marketing act together when they import the EV in 96, it'll really
go after the large group of people who still want something BIG, but don't
want a full size van.  My ex-wife has 46&quot; floor to roof in her WIndstar -- I
have something like 53&quot; in the EV!

And speaking of VR6 in vans, I've been poking around under the hood of my EV
and I think they're going to have to make some major mods to get that thing
in there.  I know its a compact mill(I had a Passat with the VR6), but the
EV engine compartment is designed around that 5cyl at an angle. Nothing like
a Passat or Golf compartment.  I wouldn't be surprised to see either some
slight intrusion into the passenger compartment or a slightly longer front
end to accomodate the VR6.  I guess we'll find out next spring!
