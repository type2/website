&gt; 
&gt; I did my own 6-cyl. conversion (to 2.7 liter nominally 165hp) and will rave on
&gt; about with scant prompting as others know. 
&gt; 
  
  Here's some scant prompting - I'm particularly curious about the bellhousing/
  flywheel/clutch/pilot bearing/starter stuff. Would the conversion be more or
  less difficult in a late '70s bus in your opinion?
