Subject: RE: EV oil change


Maybe I'm just getting lazy in my old age...but I send my EV to the =
dealer now. My dealer sends out the cupon things for oil changes =
including VW filter for $14.95..hell if they are willing to do it for =
that price let 'em I say. When I bring the EV in, however, I bring along =
my 6 pack of Mobil1...even with the price of Mobil1 I still think I'm =
getting a good deal...they provide the oil filter, the labor, and then =
dispose of my old oil....


Older, but no wiser...or is it older Budweiser...
