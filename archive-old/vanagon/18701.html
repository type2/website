&gt; 
&gt; Ok this isn't the most tasteful of subjects but has anyone got any good
&gt; suggestions for  portable toilets for my '82 Vanagon Camper?  I've got a
&gt; wife and two little kids that want to go camping in the bus but aren't
&gt; trilled about using the &quot;o-naturale&quot; latrine facilities.  Any real world
&gt; experiences along with manufacture and model information would be appreciated.
&gt; 
&gt; Please keep the bathroom humor to a minimum ........Thanks

Get yourself down to Sears and go to the camping section and pick out
the porta-potti that best fits your needs.  No bus/camper should be
without one.  It's real nice to not have to leave the camper and 
just go.  Open a window for some ventilation if needed.  Also, on
long road trips it's nice not to have to make a bathroom stop every
time someone has to go.  Just close the curtains and go.  If you
need more privace, just take a large cellophane garbage bag and make
it into a poncho and that'll hide everything.

Don't forget to by the green chemical stuff for the collection chamber.
