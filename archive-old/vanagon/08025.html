Hello?
	It's been too quiet this afternoon.  I suspect I got bumped from
the list, but who knows?  Anyhoo...

David Black sent me some pictures recently of some Brazillian type II's
that he came across.  I scanned them in and they are available
via anonymous FTP at my macintosh.  These are binary files and are in
Macintosh TIFF format, and I was not able to view them with XV.  I will
change them to jpegs when I have time, but for now this is all I can do.
Check them out - the busses are really kewl!  Oh, they are 24 bit, 72 dpi
scans, and are around 350k each.

ftp to: 		bolo.nosc_dot_mil

in the directory	/ftp/tiffs/vw
