&gt;Has any one ever used this thing before?  It is a big bag of water that
heats
&gt;up from  solar energy that is hung from a high object.  There is also a 
&gt;privacy enclosure that can be hung around below the bag of water.  Each of 
&gt;these were 19.99
&gt;for a total of 40.00 plus shipping. They were in the R.V. Direct catalog.
&gt;Any help would be great. Thanks

Jeff,

We used to use a bag similar to this in my Boy Scout troop.  It held about
2.5 gallons of water, you laid it out in the sun and an hour or so later you
had a hot shower.  The only drawback was if it was hot enough to warm the
water, the last thing you wanted to do was take a hot shower.  Used it a few
times and that was about it.
