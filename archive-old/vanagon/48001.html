Hey now

Over the past weeks since the creation of the Type II mailing
list, the content of the Vanagon list has been getting more and
more water-cooled, so I'll be seeing you all later...

Remember - if it's interesting and aircooled, cross-post so we
stranded aircooled ex-vanagon-listers can see!

(VW content - I picked up my '72 Karmann Ghia convertible this
weekend at the Body Shop from Hell (tm - was that VanBondo?) - 
great fun, and no rust!)
