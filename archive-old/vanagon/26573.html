&gt; Yes yes, I know that Bob Hoover recently wrote a very informative spiel 
&gt; on this very subject but I was wondering if I SHOULD replace my brake 
&gt; lines.  You see I bought this '66 Westy with no brakes ('cept hand 
&gt; brake).  I look in the master cylinder and jar, and both are bone dry.  I 
&gt; removed the master cylinder and had no fluid come from any of the 
&gt; three(?) lines at all (which reminds me-why are there three brake lines 
&gt; coming out of the cyl.?).  This bus hasn't been registered since 1983 so 

2 lines to the front, 1 to the back, which splits on the driver's (LIL) 
side of the tranny

&gt; I'm none too surprised.  Here's the question, should I try to flush out 
&gt; and use the existing lines or should I just replace the whole system?  

I would try and flush it first.
