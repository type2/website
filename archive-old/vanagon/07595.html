&gt; 
&gt; 	Gerry,
&gt; 	I've owned or inspected every front engine VW from Dasher to
&gt; Eurovan. They do indeed, each and every, have a timing belt, just like
&gt; a diesel Vanagon (which uses the same straight-4 as Rabbit/Golf/Golf///
&gt; blah blah blah)

Yup..Diesels got 'em. Mine had three teeth chewed off. In the shop
now getting a top-end overhaul.  Mr. piston bent mr. valve.

This hobby is now becoming more expensive than flying...
