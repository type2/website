Dave,

Some comments on your questions.
Water - I would suggest taking 1 gallon water bottles.  Do not fill 
the Westy tank.  The 1 gallon bottles fit easily under the rear seat 
and are much easier to manage, esp when pouring small quantities.

Frig shelf - Two shelves are standard in the frig.  We only ever use 
one so that we can have bottles stand up inside.  The shelves are13 
5/8&quot; wide and 6 1/2&quot; deep.  There is an outside frame of about 3/16&quot; 
dia steel and front to back bars of 1/8&quot; dia (or less) steel.  There 
is also an upstand of 3/4&quot; of 3/16&quot; dia along the front.  The whole 
thing is chrome or plastic coated.

Being a Ham I thought you might be interested to see an 84 Westy 
converted to be an independent ham station.  The owner couple, Crystal 
and Stephen Bosbach are both hams (KG5BR and N5LEQ as written on the 
back of the Westy top!) and have installed large batteries and solar 
charging panels.  I read about it in a magazine I subscribe to called 
Home Power and it was in the Dec95/Jan96 ed p.38.  You can check it 
out at www.homepower_dot_com/hp.

Good luck with the sched!
