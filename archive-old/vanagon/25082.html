Subject: Need Carb/Electric Choke/Vacuum Hose Help

hey now,

i need some help here....i think my gas milage problem is a result of either
the carb or electric choke not working properly. i've read hayes and the
idiot's guide but still don't exactly know how to go about checking the carb/
choke. i have '74 bus with a single carb. would anyone be kind enuff to give
me pointers or advice so i can check these out. muir doesn't seem to like these
chokes much and doesn't bother to tell how to adjust one.

i also seem to have a leak in a vacuum hose. when i start the van up sometimes
there seems to be a 'sucking sound' and somethime she idles very very low.
all this stops when the engine has been running awhile. my question: which hose
is the vacuum hose? the big, thick hose leading from the carb to somewhere?
please excuse my ignorance! heheehe

thanks yet again for your help!

jonathan
