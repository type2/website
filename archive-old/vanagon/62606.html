 a                   re: antenna's (FUBA)
Hi all, a little late, but better than never.

Rather than install something in the stock location, I installed a FUBA
antenna on the roof.  Just like the units found on 16 valve and other &quot;hot&quot;
VW's.  You know the one, with the neat rakish tilt to the back.  They are
available from Crutchfield and many other locations in both amplified and
non-amplified versions.  I chose the amplified version.  

The hardest part of the instalation was running the antenna cable forward and
down the windshield post.  There was sufficient coax cable provided to reach
all the way.  I ran it forward in the left side corner channel all the way up
and down the windshield post on the drivers side.  I installed the unit
centered left to right and about 9 3/4 inches (center of the antenna base)
forward of the back roof edge at the rear hatch so that it clears the overhead
AC unit.  You want it forward of the condensor and back of the front edge of
the air conditioner housing.  I forget if the coax drops straight down or off
at an angle.  I do remember thinking that the under headliner antenna parts
would have to be hidden by the air conditioner housing plastic, I think)

Looks very nice, works excelently.  The antenna gives excellent range.  Also
available in straight versions for stock location.  I put one of the stock
straight types on the SO's Scirocco.  I think it would fit the Vanagon stock
location as well.  I chose the roof version because I wanted a uniform
pattern.  I thought that the reception pattern of the antenna might be
compromised by the stock corner location.

ONLY DRAWBACK:  Does not clear dad's 7 foot garage door.  It hits as I drive
in, which might be ok, but as the door rises, or I back out, the antenna
catches on the stiffenir ribs and bends back at an odd angle.  I'm pretty sure
the bending is not good for it long term.  It DOES clear my 8 foot garage
door.  Solution to the problem is to unscrew the antenna from the base for the
few times we travel to dad's and park in the garage.

Feel free to contact me for details if you like.
