Subject: Loafer in fine art print

Hi,
I just got the latest catalog from Greenwich Workshop, an art publisher with
artists like Bev Doolittle, Stephen Lyman, and James Gurney.  What do I see
on page 11?  A print with a white over light blue VW bus.  The piece entitled
&quot;Where Love Resides&quot; is by modern folk artist John Simpkins and is sort of a
companion art piece to the movie &quot;How to Make an American Quilt&quot;.  It's sort
of an Americana piece which pictures a Cape Cod style house, a quilt and the
loafer.  The bus by the way has the spare tire and a bra on the front and a
guy sitting in the driver's seat.  If anyone's interested they're selling
1000 prints signed by the artist and some of the movie actors for $450US and
another 1000 prints just signed by the artist for $225US.  If I get
permission from the publisher, maybe I could scan it in and upload it onto
the net somewhere.  I haven't done this before, but we have a scanner at
work, so I think I could do it with someone's guidance.
