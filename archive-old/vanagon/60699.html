: 
&gt; Hi All, I've established that my fridge doesn't work on 120V.
&gt; I've also phoned around to the dealerships listed in my VW manual as 
&gt; &quot;factory authorized dealers&quot; but they no longer handle these parts or 
&gt; repairs. What I'd like to do is take out the fridge myself and try to 
&gt; troubleshoot the problem.
&gt; 
&gt; Can anyone tell me how to get the fridge out and if I can figure out
what's 
&gt; wrong, where to get the parts.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks.....Harry ( '85 Westy)

Harry,

LiMBO has a reprint of the Westfalia fridge service manual available for
about $10.  Not sure of their URL but I'm sure someone on the list could
provide it.

Also, the Bentley manual which you ordered from me yesterday covers the
fridge. (It is already on its way to you via air-mail.)

I have many of the fridge parts available.  (Some parts are not too cheap,
though, depending on what you need. :(   

By the way,  this may be obvious, but have you checked to make sure that it
is plugged in (inside the lower right cabinet, on the left side of the
compartment, is an AC outlet that it plugs into.)
