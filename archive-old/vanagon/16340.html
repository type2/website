&gt;]From: Joel Walker &lt;JWALKER_at_ua1vm.ua_dot_edu&gt;
&gt;]also: i think the tendency to want to run the synthetics is mostly the desire
&gt;]to go longer mileage between oil changes. i personally think this is a very
&gt;]BAD idea. [...]

&gt;From Jerry Dunham &lt;dunham_at_devnull.mpd.tandem_dot_com&gt;:
&gt;I agree with this 100%.  Synthetic oils DO last MUCH longer without
&gt;breaking down, but there are lots of other factors: combustion by-
&gt;products, fines (small wear particles), additive package breakdown,
&gt;other contaminants.

I would tend to agree with this as well.  I've run my Golf on synthetics its
whole life (150k+ miles) and my mechanic tells me that it has 'like new'
compression.

I change the oil every 5,000 miles.  It seems to have done well.  On my new
bus, I'm going to change every 3,000.

&gt;Bingo.  Higher octane ratings are there to minimize the tendency to pre-
&gt;ignition, nothing more.  You should always run the lowest octance that
&gt;does not result in pinging in your engine.  This can sometimes change as
&gt;an engine ages (it has in my wife's Honda, now at 123,000 miles).  Any-
&gt;thing more is a waste of money and petroleum resources.

Hmmm.  My boyfriend's been saying this for years, but I never believed him.
Perhaps I'll see how well my new bus does on mid-grade (89) octane instead
of the 92 my Golf always got.

Incidentally, change me over from being a 'wannabus' to an owner of a 1990
Westie camper, 32k miles, and a truly beautiful beast.  I've wanted one of
these for over a decade... and it feels wonderful having this dream come true.
