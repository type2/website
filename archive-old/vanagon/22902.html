Subject: Westy interior trim ('66)


Hi,

This is another of my now (in)famous &quot;where to find&quot; questions.

All the rubber(plastic?) trim on the Westy cabinets was shrunk over the past
29 years of its life.  Can replacements be purchased somewhere?  Junk yards 
are out since I assume they suffered the same fate.

Altho ALL trim has shrunk, the areas of most concern is the trim around the
mirror door to the closet, and the rubber trim found where two perpendicular
pieces of wood meet (ie to cover the unfinished edge of one of the pieces).

Any hints would be appreciated,
...Markus
