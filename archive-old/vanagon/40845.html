Greg Merritt forwarded me a few gems gleaned from the auto trader on line
(www.traderonline_dot_com):

-&gt;1967 VOLKSWAGEN VANAGON SAFARI windows &amp; Barnyard doors, .......

-&gt;84 VOLKSWAGEN VANAGON convertible VAN, 4-speed, 4 cylinder, fuel inj,
        am/fm stereo-cass, $2995,
        BEECHWOLD AUTO SALES, (XXX)XXX-XXXX, (DEALER)

Cool--just imagine a splittie vanagon barnyard safari window
convertible with AT, must be really rare.
