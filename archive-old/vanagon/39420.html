&gt;i put in bosch platinums this sunday....and am having some problems now.
&gt;seems i back fire a little when i first start the engine. i push down on the
&gt;gas , the engine revs, then it wants to cut off when the engine is starting
&gt;to idle. i understand the platinums tend to run a little richer..what should
&gt;i do, go  back to regular bosch plugs...adjust the carb? what?

Maybe one is defective or you have a created a bad connection with one of the
wires when you re-installed it?

&gt;i don't really feel a difference with the platinums, any suggestions?

You shouldn't &quot;feel&quot; any difference.  The platinum's &quot;claim to fame&quot; is a
long life.

Good luck,
