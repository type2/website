Subject: Re: FI Vacuum leak 83 Westy?



&gt;
&gt;Anyway, can anyone tell me how to check for a leak at the air distributor
&gt;where it meets the hose, and if replacing this length of hose is as simple as
&gt;it appears or will I need to separate the manifolds from the heads?
&gt;
&gt;TIA
&gt;Jeff

It's horribly crude but I sqirt a little WD40 (or similar) at suspected
inlet leaks and listen whether the engine note changes...
