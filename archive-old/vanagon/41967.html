Subject: [vanagon]   PS rack rebuild: HELP

Subject says it all.  Anyone ever rebuilt one of these and had it work!?  
Dealer says they've failed several times, FLAPS says no go, usually hidden 
machining work required that the rebuild kit won't fix. Prices are $420Cdn 
($300US) for a FLAPS rebuild (using my core if desired), with lifetime 
warranty. VW say $1060 hah hah hah, they have a $100 seal kit, hence my 
dilema, do I waste the $100, then buy the $420 rebuild......  The rack 
failed fast, seems like a seal blew, rather than wearout.  Any advice on 
this would be appreciated, like if they really can be rebuilt, or if I can 
pull a rack out of an Audi 5000 say?   Tim
