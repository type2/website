Subject: FS: 1963 Camper

        A guy down the street is selling his '63 camper.  Its one of those
panel-conversion ones.  It needs a rear-left corner; other than that it is
reasonably straight and rust free.  The camper kit appears to be mostly
complete.  Its also been converted to 12V.  I've done a little bit of work
on the bus, and can attest to its general reliability.

        Scottt (916) 481-1525

        The bus is in Sacramento, CA.
