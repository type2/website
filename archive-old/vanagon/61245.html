Subject: Aftermarket Westie Front Tables for Sale (maybe...) + Report on Michelin 205 MX tires

Hey Gang-

I recently got my Ace Mechanic to look at all the cool interior stuff on
my '87 Westie, and after I
lamented about not having a front table he said, &quot;Shoot--I could make
one of those for you easily!&quot; Indeed 
he could. He has all the necessary tools (and experience) to bend pipe,
etc.. I believe he would be able to
do the metal work without difficulty, and do a really excellent job.
That leaves the woodwork for the table top 
to me or someone else (probably no big deal?). I told him that I might
know some people who might be interested 
in such a table, and so:

1) Who wants a front table for their Westie? If we have enough requests,
we'll make a bunch.

2) How much are you willing to pay? I believe the current dealer price
for it is over _$400.00_!! 
(I checked--and cried--when I bought my '87). Jeff is in it to make a
living, and if he can make a fair 
buck off it, he'll make a bunch of them (I'm just interested in getting
a dang front table!) But how much would 
it worth to you?

3) Can someone provide me with table specs? 

4) Can anyone recommend improvements in the design--if we're making them
from scratch, maybe we can make them 
better than the originals. Any ideas?

If you knows of another source for a front table, let me know. I've
never heard of one. I know that I
talked to the owner of Euroamerica about a year ago and he mentioned
that he might start making them, but in our 
last conversation (when I ordered a fridge vent cover--very nice snf
about $8.00) he said that it wasn't in his plans.

BTW I just got a set of those Michelin 205 MX reinforced sidewall tires
for this van and I LOVE them. $91 each from 
Tire Rack. They give a very solid ride, work well on dirt roads, and on
the highway it feels like you're on a train track! 
The van is more stable, and less squirley in wind. Definitely recommend
them.
