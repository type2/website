Subject:      Passing Emissions 83.5

Hello-

Thanks to everyone's help in getting my water-cooled, rebuilt long block 83.5
running well. I've got an appointment for my NY state inspection on Tuesday.
Are there any recommendations or tricks to make sure or help me get through
the emissions test?

I've put in new spark plugs, wires, cap, rotor and an 02 sensor to replace
the faulty one. I adjusted the timing. It runs best and at about 800 rpms
with the timing, uh advanced a bit or is it retarded. If I look at the &quot;V&quot;
mark on the pulley with the timing light it is slightly to the
counter-clockwise side of the line where the engine case halves meet. there
are actually two marks on my pulley. One is the &quot;V&quot; mark which I assume in
TDC. The other is a slight curved slot to the clockwise side of the &quot;V&quot; . I
assume this is a factory slot also?? Anyway the timing is adjusted closer to
the curved slot which must be about 5 degrees toward the clockwise side of
TDC. (assuming the &quot;V&quot; is TDC)

Sorry I don't know if I speaking of advanced or retarded timing. Looks like I
need refresher coarse.

Anyway I suppose I'm curious about the timing and any other adjustment or
advice to get it through inspection. the Westy is new to me, so this is my
first inspection.

Any ideas will be appreciated.

TIA
