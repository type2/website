Subject: Re: campers and colors

&gt;   Question:  DId or do Campers come in only 1 color each year?
&gt;
&gt; no
&gt;
&gt; i dont know for all years, but in 64-67 you could get them in velvet green,
&gt; also white, I've seen a dove blue 64.
&gt;
&gt; My 65 camper was originally velvet green below, white on top.  (now it is
&gt; pinto metallic blue and primer brown - blech)   I have seen a couple othe
&gt; stock two tone westys.,  they were european market buses, as is my 65.

Most Westfalias were made from Kombis, which had the single color paint job. I
have seen 1 Westfalia that was made from a standard bus, a 227******. Not only
did it have the 2-tone paint, it also had a pop-out window inside the wall
closet instead of a fixed window. It did have the wood headliner and pop-top.
Interesting indeed...
