Subject: Re: $70 muffler strap? 1.9L

&gt;I installed new exhaust pipe and muffler on my '84 vanagon 1.9L.
&gt;
&gt;My local VW dealer quoted $68.45 for the metal strap that supports the
&gt;muffler and attaches to a bracket and bracing on the passenger side of the
&gt;engine. 
&gt;
&gt;Is there a good substitute. I have it temporarily supported with &quot;plumbers
&gt;tape.&quot; I'm concerned about the muffler rubbing against the exhaust pipe 
&gt;between #2 &amp; #4 cylinders. There is little to no clearence.
&gt;


I looked into this for another list member not long ago. 

None of the aftermarket muffler companies make a strap for the Vanagon 
muffler, but I did finally find an aftermarket source. However, it lists  
as fitting '85-up Vanagons, not the '83-1/2 to 84.  I'm not sure why. The 
replacement mufflers are the same for '84 and '85.  Perhaps the mounting is 
different?  Or perhaps they are trying to say that it fits the 2.1L 
mufflers (which would actually be '86-up).  I haven't looked at the two 
straps side by side to compare.

In any event, the aftermarket strap is $18.50, which is a far cry from $70. 
For the 1984, I can get the actual Volkswagen strap for $49.50, which still 
beats $70, but is frankly a lot of money for a little piece of metal.
