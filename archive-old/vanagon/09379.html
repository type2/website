So David Carment says:
&gt; 
&gt; the issue of leakage is relavant only if there was a problem to begin
&gt; with, synthetic will not cause a leak; but will flow more easily to areas
&gt; where there is one. solution? make sure your rocker covers are whole and
&gt; intact. -- 
&gt; 

So how many people have the option at this point of time in switching to
synthetic and not having a leak?  If you have a new engine fine, but 
eventually it will leak regardless with you've used sythetic or not.
Therefore, I do not use it because I do not want the accompanying leaks.
Especially if it can be overted by not using a specific lubricant.  You
could use synthetic until you have leaks and switch back, but I'm not
sure once the damage has been done that it's reversible.  I can only
go on what the guy told me about his type II.  I would speculate that
since it was air-cooled that excessive heat probably doesn't help either
but I would think that sythetic oil would keep the engine cooler and
not enhance gasket seepage.  I'm not a physic major and I don't play
one on TV.  Okay David, I've reached the incoherent babbling stage,
but I still wouldn't use a synthetic oil in an air-cooled VW.
