&gt; Well Steve, it's an 82 Westfalia.  I've looked under the rear bench seat, and
&gt; didn't notice a heater type thing, but I wasn't looking for it either.  So
&gt; how does this thing work? Do you use it when you're parked up and trying to
&gt; heat the van while camping?  Or when you want to warm up the interior before
&gt; heading off for the day?  Where does the blower get the heat from if the
&gt; engine is cold?  I'm still confused.  Sorry!
&gt; 

Well, obviously, you have a different heating system and it's not the
same as with the later models.  I suspect you have one of those systems
that uses gas or propane and has a blower and the output is integrated
with the venting system.  Yeah, I'm jealous.  You'll need to ask one
of the Canadian folks with an earlier van e.g. David Carment (although
he has a diesel and I don't know the differences).  Do you have a 
Bentley manual?  I strongly suggest that you get one if you don't.  I'm
sure you can find your system in there and can diagnose the problem
from it.

Cheers!
