Subject: Re: The Existance of Santa Claus &lt;Kris Kringle, Father Christmas,


&gt;Thanks a lot Joel, I've believed in the existance of the man
&gt;for some 40 odd years, now you publish this scientific paper
&gt;that confirms the jolly old man is dead! I'm depressed! I'm
&gt;embarrassed....I've been had!

Now, now, don't cry Ric. There IS a Santa after all and to prove it, here's 
his e-mail address:

santa_at_northpole_dot_net

Now you can all send him your present lists. His elves have been very busy 
writing up a web page as well:
