Subject: Sliding Door Problem Fixed

The sliding door was sticking on my 1990 Vanagon, Wolfie. I cleaned the
tracks, lubed everything, and still couldn't get the door open without
pulling on the bottom rear edge of the door. Last night, I sprayed WD-40
on the rubber gaskets surrounding the door lip and the door no longer
sticks. I will have to get out the soap and water to really clean the
door gasket.
