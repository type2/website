Subject:      heated window washer fluid ... a question

a thought has crossed my brain concerning this:

if you get the fluid toooo hot, wouldn't you be risking shattering the
windshield/windscreen in the dead of winter? like when the hot fluid hits
the frozen cold glass?

how hot is enough to soften bugs and melt the ice, but not enough to cause
some sort of severe stress in the glass?  the reason i thunk of it was that
the temperature of the coolant is gonna be up over 200 degrees F, wouldn't
you think? that seems pretty darn hot enough to shatter very cold glass to
me.
