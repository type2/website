Subject: M-Codes Revisited

Pardon me for putting some offlist replies back onlist, but
I'm trying to keep the onlist interest up so maybe we can
get more members to provide their information to the pieces
of the puzzle we have now.

&gt;&gt;1967 Double Cab:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;09 8                     Mfg date: August 9, 1966
&gt;&gt;                         383883 Turquois/Turquoise/?
&gt;                          ^^^^^^
&gt;                          Velvet Green\Velvet Green\Mesh Grey
&gt;Turquoise was not available in 1967

&gt;Dave

The Mesh Grey piece helps, Dave.  And I, too, thought that
Turquoise went away in '66.  A PO had repainted the truck
(close to Dove Blue), but the original paint is obvious in
some places.  I have a DuPont color chip chart for the 60s
and the Turqouise chip is a match for the color under the
blue.  During the repaint job they painted over the sticker
on the bulkhead which would have the &quot;L&quot; code for the paint.

I wonder if because this is a very early '67 (8082 into the
run of 148000) that maybe Turquoise was still available.  I
am very familiar with Velvet Green (about 2 gallons
familiar) from the restoration of my Deluxe.  Maybe some
more archeological work is necessary on my part.

&gt;do you think the ^^^^ part is what the original paint
&gt;was/is?? Mine is L512 velvet green. (Jim i noticed that your
&gt;velvet green bus has the number 381370 for the paint
&gt;code???)

The L512 is the Lacquer Code for Velvet Green.  We all
can agree on that.  Just as L87 is for Pearl White.
the L-Codes were listed on pressure-sensitive stickers
which were normally placed directly below the ID plate
screwed to the bulkhead behind the passenger seat.

&gt;does 523907 on the tag mean the bus was origianally pearl
&gt;white?

I take this as the question that Dave was asking.  Is (or
was) your bus actually Pearl White or was it another color?
Or do you know?

&gt;i wil get the info from my 65' westy tommorow.

Please do.  The more information, the better, IMO.

&gt;let's solve those mysteries, cause i have BEeN PONdering
&gt;this for a while and this mystery has been my PUNishment!

It has been BENificial for all of us to PONtificate a
little.
