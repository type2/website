Subject: 87: follow up on leaking head
Date: Tue, 19 Mar 1996 16:47:47 -0800

I posted a message last week about a coolant leak from what appears to be a 
small crack in the right head, just below the upper-right stud. Here's an 
update on what I've done so far...

1. Tried to seal the crack externally with JB Weld. This is an epoxy 
product that was recommended by a FLAP. Didn't work, nice try.

2. Tried an application of AlumaSeal. This is essentially powdered aluminum 
that you pour in the coolant. It's supposed to seal small leaks. This 
hasn't worked either. Looks like part of the crack has sealed, but it still 
leaks.

I'm going to try another dose of AlumaSeal and if that doesn't work, I'll 
try BarsLeak. Any suggestions or comments appreciated.
