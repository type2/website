This past weekend, I had the pleasure of visiting a store in Oakland, CA
called West Coast Marine, which is apparently a chain, as well as a catalog
operation.  It is huge and has many items that could be used in the
camping/RV industry.  They had products I'd never encountered before
like alcohol burning stoves, wall-mountable propane heaters, and
12-volt blenders!  Anyway, I called their 800 number immediately
to be put on their mailing list, and some of you may want to as well.
I believe that their new catalog comes out tomorrow.  Their phone is:

1.800. 538.0775
