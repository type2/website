Subject: '67 camper update

Well I'm almost a bit embarrassed to say it but, I just thought I should
follow through since I made the original posting. I couldn't resist and went
ahead and gave the guy the full $5000 for the '67 westy I was asking the
list about. Thanks for all the input. Now I guess my postings will be
related to how to keep it in good shape (I hope I won't be having to ask too
many questions!).

Thanks to everyone who responded.

Martin
