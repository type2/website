&gt;From the Lincoln Journal &amp; Star 6/1/95

'74 V.W. CAMPMOBILE Westphila, low miles, exc cond., $5,000 obo (402) 
464-8474

'65 VW van, runs, rebuilt trans, camper kit, $400, Must sell.  (402) 
488-3745

Not my spelling.  I know nothing about these.  The former has been in 
here for about a week.  The low miles thing seemed interesting.  I 
would buy the later if I hadn't just sunk everything I own into my 
'71.  Enjoy.  Oh, Lincoln, Nebraska is were they are.
