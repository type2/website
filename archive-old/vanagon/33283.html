^^Even if this turns out to be my problem, I won't feel too bad. I've done

^^P.S. What do you think? Could this be the problem?

WARNING!  THE WORD &quot;HONDA&quot; IS MENTIONED IN THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS!

Could be.  I had a Honda (!) with a similar problem, the cause seemed to 
be a torn preheater hose.  So, carb icing is possible.  At any rate, it sure 
can't hurt to have all of the hoses set in their proper place (including the 
Infamous Charcoal Filter Canister Hoses, which my '70 Kombi has).  My 
Kombi Flat Spot (when cold) is predictable, and goes away when the motor 
warms up a little.  

Back to the Honda.  This happened only in cold outside temps and would 
cause the car to bog down at approx. 2500-3000 (aka &quot;hitting a flat spot&quot;).  
The car would be warm, and the problem would disappear 
under sustained driving conditions.  

Hope this helps,
