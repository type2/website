&gt; 	Well I suppose many of you may know this, but I saw what looked 
&gt; like a very nice synchro on the movie Endless Summer (2,  ?).  Since I 
&gt; had a few beers and the conversation was hot on surfing (there was some 
&gt; surf comp here is Santa Cruz this weekend) I did not realize that it must 
&gt; be a synchro in order for them to drive on the beach.  There was also 
&gt; another scene in which they were driving a dune buggy, with the vw logo 
&gt; clearly present on the steering wheel, and nearly ran into a clean white 
&gt; vanagon--Euro version I think.  That was the extent of my viewing, but I 
&gt; think I would like to see the movie in full now.  I guess surfing is not 
&gt; all that bad after all.

Both endless summer movies are excellent entertainment. The original 
(1966) shows a lot of VW buses all over the world. The second movie 
shows a lot of VWs in South Africa, where the Syncro and dune buggy 
were shown. The director and narrator, Bruce Brown, shows a lot of 
amusing scenes, including the one where the buggy stalls out in the 
game preserve and lions crawl all over it with the surfers inside. 
Highly recommended.

Rich.
