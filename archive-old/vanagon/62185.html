Subject: Re: the stupidest question yet!

As far as useless coathooks go, try the one in the back of a splitty double 
cab.  It is so close to the rear sheetmetal, you couldn't get a coat on 
there if you wanted to!!
&gt;
&gt;The driver's side coathook on the Westy models is virtually useless
&gt;because the front of the rear interior light overhead structure (for lack
&gt;of a better term)(makes a neat place to stash small stuff) is mounted so
&gt;close to it.
