&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; The only problem with Joshua Tree is that it is fairly far from the Bay
&gt; &gt; area, where most of the West-coast vanagon owners seem to be.  
[snip]
&gt;   
&gt;   In late March most of the passes over the Sierra to Hwy 395 are still closed.
&gt;   Access to 395 involves taking hwy 80 or 50 up around L. Tahoe or looping down
&gt;   underneath via Bakersfield. Those of you who survived the stormy weekend
&gt;   in Big Sur seem real interested in a &quot;desert&quot; environment for the next 
&gt;   outing..... Anything to do with rainfall? 

FWIW -- I might think an outing in the Gold Country would attract
non-SFO bay residents.  That would seem to be a summer activity,
however.  I can think of a couple of good spots in Arizona, but
that would preclude the California people (especially since
the spots I am thinking of are in the Central and Southeast AZ
areas).

Can one of you database phreaks come up with the central spot
on list, weighted for number of people and and average
cruising speed of Micros, Busses, Wasserboxers, Diesels, &amp;c...?

That would probably end up being somewhere just east of Muddy
Gap, Wyoming! ;-&gt;
