One thing to mention is that the torque is not only GOOD at low end,
but it is good everywhere.  I have the 5-spd, and it takes of when I hit 
the accelerator at any speed, up any hill.  The amount of power in the 
EV is definitely much better than my '87 Vanagon.

 &gt; Mike asks:
 &gt; 
 &gt; &gt;What's the HP rating on those and how much does the van weigh?
 &gt; 
 &gt; HP - 109 _at_ 4,500 RPM
 &gt; Torque - 140 _at_ 2,200 RPM &lt;- note gobs of torque starting at the low end
 &gt; 
 &gt; I don't have the exact weight figures, but I remember the EV weighing
 &gt; about 400 lbs more than a Vanagon.
