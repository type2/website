Subject: what is the correct part number????

     Hello experts,
	I discovered a small leak by the rear heater in my '85
and dutifully called up and read about the &quot;new&quot; metal plug
that was supposed to cure this very problem.  However, when
I went to my Friendly Local VW Dealer and talked to my friend
in the parts department (he realy is friendly, and intelligent
too. I have been going back there for over 15 years.  I DO shop 
for prices, but sometimes you can only get certain things from
the dealer.)  The part number I gave him is dead, no good, etc.

The number I used is N 902 061 01.  Does any one know what the
CORRECT part number is?  

	It is a small pain to get at the heater as I have a weekender, 
and there is a crossbar just in front of the heater, etc.  I don't
really like wrestling with that seat again any more than I have to.
Upholstery tears are a REAL close possibility.  Thanks!
