Subject:      Re: Cap and Rotor Burn-out

I have the same problem on my '85 and it doesn't matter what brand parts =
I use.  The distributor is new so I doubt that is the problem.  There =
was a string about dirt from static build up and the fix being a =
conductive plastic cap, but I didn't see the whole thing, so I'm not =
sure if this was the problem.  If it was the problem, I'd like to know =
how to get one, you too I guess.
