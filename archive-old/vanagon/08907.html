&gt; 
&gt; Since I am new to owning a bus and haven't even had the chance to
&gt; drive it around yet, I am curious as to what the attitude of cops have
&gt; been for people driving VW busses. Are you picked out and searched
&gt; often? Do you sometimes &quot;fit the description of someone&quot; they are
&gt; &quot;looking for&quot;? Do they assume you have drugs in the van?

The instance which comes to mind is at a speed trap set out on a 
side street near where I used to work, a motorcycle cop would be
snagging people left and right. He was out there once or twice
a week for about a month. He never even pointed his radar gun
at me, which really ticked me off, since I felt this was his way
of saying &quot;I know you are incapable of doing 50 in a 35 MPH zone&quot;.

Seriously, I've been driving my Bus for 5 years and have never been
pulled off while driving it. I'm 35, wear a tweed cap and smoke
a pipe, which may have something to do with it.......
