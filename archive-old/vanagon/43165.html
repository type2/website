Subject: NON--VW-Kind of--Freon Replacment Question

Hi--checked the archive without much luck---Kinda overwhelming.

I do remember someone saying that a Freon replacement was coming out that
would not necessitate the replacement of the system in the car.  That it
could just be put in after the Freon was removed.  We have a friend with a
New Yorker and they want $750+ to convert her car over to the new &quot;Earth
Friendly&quot; stuff and she just can't afford it.

If anyone has any info on the replacement refrigerants that does not require
mechanical modifications please let me know.

Thanks in advance for the help.
