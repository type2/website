Subject:      ECU Idiot Warning!?

Vanamaniacs,

While passing through Naperville IL on my way to an Ultimate Frisbee
tournament my ECU warning lamp suddenly came on.... Van has 65k+ miles,
replaced engine last summer at 55k, just switched to synth oil. Everything
seems to be running fine. Owners manual states ecu warning will come on at
60k to indicate a routine service needed. I can't find any other notes on
the ecu warning. Should I have my mechanic check things out? Or is there
something I can do on my own?

Thanx for any advice.

R.
