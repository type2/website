&gt; Hi,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I use about an 8200 BTU propane heater by Olympian. I hang it on my 
&gt; &gt; refrigertaor door (1985 westy). Works VERY well in snows at Tahoe. Has 
&gt; &gt; thermostatic control so it goes on and off automatically.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; How much propane does this guy use?  Can I get away with using one of the
&gt; &quot;little&quot; bottles (32oz?) that are used for camp stoves, if I'm only using
&gt; it an hour a day for maybe 2 or 3 days?

My guess, never having measured it, is that you'd be ok. They have a 
smaller model too....maybe 6200 BTU as I recall. I run it all night long, 
(with thermostat on and off autormatically) plus my refrigerator off the 
standard westphalia size propane tank underneath. I think the combo has 
carried me for about ten days, give or take.


&gt; 
&gt; How about ventilation?  I assume this little guy puts out CO, which tends
&gt; to sink.  Since my Vanagon is a Weekender, my bed is kind of low, and I'd
&gt; like to wake up in the morning!
&gt; 

I worried about the same thing. These somehow are catalytic or something 
and don't have that risk. I have used it since 1991....window on side 
door open a half inch or so.
