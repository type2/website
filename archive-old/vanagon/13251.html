Some sort of ego trip or something, I guess.

&gt;Same thing for those people that pull out from a side street right
&gt;in front cause they think you're going to be too slow.  Ugh!!

The up side of this is that the cops figure that the VW camper
can't go that fast.  In the 16 years I've been driving my bus
I've never had a speeding ticket. &lt;knock on wood&gt;

YMMV,                                   ;-)
