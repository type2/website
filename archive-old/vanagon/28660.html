Subject: Re: Thanks

&gt;This list is great.  Thank you, thank you, thank you.  I got tons of
&gt;responses on the recent values of crew cabs y'all have seen out there.  I
&gt;got pointed to the Edmunds Old Car price guide, then someone posted it to
&gt;me.  I got advice on how to deal with insurance companies, and much more!!!!!
&gt;
&gt;I've got to sort it all out.  I'm not unreasonable.  I'll do all my own
&gt;work, but the settlement will buy the tools and parts......
        Hey, if you have the time when it's all over, how's about
organizing it into one big FAQ to drop at the archives? I suspect this kind
of info could come in handy to some of us a couple of times a
year-unfortuanately.  :-(  Just a thought, don't feel obligated.

Peace,
