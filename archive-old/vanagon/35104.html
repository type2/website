Subject: a bently manual for short $.

          I  saw  it at a used book store 1980-84 rabbit,+other non-vans, I
     think.


          BTW, anyone know a  heated  dipstick  or  the  like  for  an  '83
     aircooled.  (I know that's a bit weird; it was built in '82.) It's going
     to be chilly again tomorrow and I'd like a 50/50 chance at getting  it
     started again in the near future.
