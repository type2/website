Subject: Boy am I dumb.

Well I ran over myself last week.  How does one do this? Easy!  You see I
live on Main street dowtown and I have to park on the street.  I come out
to walk the dog and I see &quot;Joe Redneck&quot; and his 85 foot dual axle I wanna
be a cowboy pickup in front of the Westy.  I say to myself, &quot;there is no
way he got into my spot without hitting my front bumper.  Igo and check
and sure enough, a ding from his trailer hitch.  So, rather than nuking
this mud covered tank, I decide to be a pacifist and simply open the door
and release the break to let my van back a little bit.  (you can see where
this is going.)  Well I have only had the van about 3 months and I forgot
about the wheel being so close.  Next thing I know I have the Westy on my
Foot.  Yes I am yelling very loudly at this point.  Don't forget I have
the dog in the other hand on a leash on Main street.  Well it is about 6
am.  and not a sole in sight.  So, being the educated mechanic I am, I
decided to try and turn the key to pop it off my foot.  No luck, the
emergency break is on and it catches hard.  Well let's try and role it off
by letting the emergency break off all the way.  More pain and now it is
really on top of me.  Well finally I decide to continue to try and pop it
numerous times and I finally get it to where I can yank my foot out.  BIG
black mark on the old shoe and Lot's of pain.  Realize I accomplished this
extraction one handed (and one footed).  Well needless to say we won't be
doing that again anytime soon.  And yes, I was well within the confines of
my front and back white lines for my space originally.  I hate pickup
trucks.  And there damn drivers.  Hope your laughing cause I gat a kick
out of it.  Anybody know the gross weight of the front end of an 83.5.
Have a good weekend.
