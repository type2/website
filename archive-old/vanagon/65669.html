Subject:      Re: Inside refigerator fans

I made it so the fan would come on any time the fan in the back of the
fridge goes on (wired in parallel with the fan in the back). This is the
only way to do what you want to do. Otherwise, you have to switch the fan on
manually.

&gt;I install 12V fans inside my refrigerator and was just going to wire it to
&gt;the vehicle with a switch somewhere so I can turn it on and off. But it
&gt;occured to me, is there anywhere on the fridge that I could wire the fans
&gt;to so that they would go on when the fridge is in use? I looked at the
&gt;wiring diagram and I did not see any way to do this. But perhaps someone
&gt;out there more skilled at reading wiring diagrams might see something I
&gt;missed.
