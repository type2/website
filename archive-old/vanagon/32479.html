Subject: hydraulic lifter question.

Hello all,
	I recently bought a '78 2000 engine to replace the dead engine 
from my '73 bus.  I'm not sure how long the engine has been sitting but 
it can't be more than a year.  It had oil in it while it was sitting and 
I just drained it so I could do a little work before I put it in.  My 
question is if there is anything special I need to do the prepare the 
lifters and how should I adjust the valves at start up and for normal 
driving?  Please note that I am not taking the engine apart and that it 
is not a rebuilt.

Thanks
-Erik.

P.S. Does anyone know how to get off rusty screws that hold the tin 
down?  It's gets so frustrating sometimes that I can't fix anything 
because I can't get to it because of a few dinky *$&amp;%#_at_ screws!
