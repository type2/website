Subject: Re: accelerator cables

I carry a spare now, but...

Let's see - a first-date disaster, with me in a 3-piece suit, and a broken
cable.  Put on the Sears coveralls and used my 5&quot; Vice-Grips to hold the
broken ends together (it had broken near the clutch cable pre-load tube
over the tranny; weird spot).  On my way in minutes.

In my first SuperBeetle it broke right at the fitting that goes into the
gas pedal.  Clipped onto the remaining end of the cable with the same
Vice-Grips, took off my shoe, and kept the cable between my great and
second toes, using the Vice-Grip not so much as a pedal, but as a way of
distributing the force on my foot.

A friend lost his on a phenomenally rusty 21-window Deluxe; no spare.  We
tied speaker wire to the back (F.I.F) of the accelerator arm, took it out
of the engine compartment, through the rear hatch, and snaked it all the
way to the gas pedal.  Extremely ugly and slow to respond because of all
the friction but it worked.
