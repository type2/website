Subject: Non-Bosch parts

The price difference between VW and my FLAPS for plugs, rotor, cap, and air
filter was roughly two to one (87 Vanagon).  The FLAPS stuff was NGK plugs
and Beck-Arnley for all the rest, vs. Bosch from VW.  What's the real
difference?  Have I doomed my beloved brick by putting in the cheap stuff?
What about other parts?  When do you go authorized VW, and when do you go with
the imitators?  Thanks all.
