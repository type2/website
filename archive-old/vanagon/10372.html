Subject: Re: Westy Tents

&gt;Are the Westfalia tents rare or something?
&gt;
Have you gone off your medication again?,
 of course they're rare, when new your '73 Westy cost around $5,400 Cdn
the damned tent added another $300, pretty steep. We had a '71 Westy
delivered in Europe for $3,600Cdn, and didn't buy the tent for this reason.
I did keep the stool when we sold it however, and picked up yet another 
from a '72. My tent cost me $250 10 years ago in the local buy-and-sell.
It's been attached to 2 micros and 1 vanagon so far. Did you get the real 
Westy radio? with a short wave band for listening to Radio Free Yurrup?


My '73 came with all the factory options:
&gt;Pop-top and exterior tent.  The only thing missing
&gt;was the little stool that goes between the ice box/sink
&gt;and the jump seat behind the driver.
