&gt; Last time I was to Canada, handguns could NOT be brought in, but long guns

And I for one am glad. I'll take my chances with the bears and 
cougars *without* a gun, thank you.
  
&gt; I've got a compendium of US state and fed gun regs, but it doesn't cover
&gt; Canada. [They're still resisting annexation, but I bet we could get the
&gt; Quebecois to join if we hold off on the English First legislation and let
&gt; them have their own &quot;en francais&quot; state. ;) ]
Please, please do this!! Anything to quit their whining!

&gt; It might also be worthwhile, to ask what the Canadian reg's are on Bear
&gt; Repellant, a.k.a. pepper spray.  The large size canisters can be very
&gt; effective, even on non-Ursidae species. ;)
Now *that's* a more sensible measure. But I think their are 
restrictions on this also.
