Subject:       Re: Canuck Vanagon Oddities

Hi Larry.  The speedometer in our Westy is in Km/h only.  No other 
markings.  The same for our Golf.  The odometer is good for 6 digits 
(no tenths).  Do US odos have 6 digits as well?
 
&gt; 4) There may have been other oddities, but I can't recall for sure.  Possibly 
&gt; the KPH/MPH is reversed on the speedo (miles smaller print/kilometers bigger 
&gt; print).  Manuals may also be written in English and French, but I'm not sure 
&gt; about internal van markings/labels etc.
&gt; 

Not sure, offhand, if the manuals are bilingual or not.  

another possible difference in the Westy:

- smoke alarm.  Canadian models have this installed at the port 
(Halifax, Nova Scotia).  It's a royal pain in the butt, but law says 
it must be there.  Are these in the US models??

Have a good one,

Harry.
