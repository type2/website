Subject: Suburu Engine Transplants into Vanagons

As a new owner of a 1987 Vanagon waterboxer with a bad engine I wonder if any
one out there in VW Bus World has any information or experience tranplanting
a 2700 cc Suburu engine(or any other watercooled engine) into a Vanagon. Any
info would be appreciated.
