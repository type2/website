Subject: 71 bus turn signals

 Hello listmembers,
    Taking my son to school this a.m. Noticed when I changed lane car behind
me blew horn. My signal was on but clicked fast. Got home and  checked rear
bulb was out.
Replaced bulb and signal worked fine. Was wondering if signal supposed to
give you this  racing click when bulb is out or do I have some kind of
electrical problem. 

                                                      Thanks, 
                                                        Wayne
