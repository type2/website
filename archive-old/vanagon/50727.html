Subject: Double cab sighting
Date: Tue, 22 Oct 1996 01:20:47 -0400 (EDT)

I was in virginia beach this weekend and i saw my first double
cab.  I think it was an 86' or later as it had the square
headlamps.  It was white, loaded with surfboards and
beautiful.  I have seen a few postings about sightings and
wishes of ownership, but i had never seen one.  NOw i can
believe!!
