&gt;That would work great, however the arms of the awning are right at the very
&gt;ends of the awning and need to come down to the bus at that point. The jack
points &gt;are just too close together unless you had a short awning.

That implies that the awning supports must be at the extreme ends of the
awning.  Seems to me that you could have a cross piece at the end of the
awning extend a couple of feet front &amp; back of the supports.
