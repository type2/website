Subject: About those VW ads

Wow.  I've had a requests for the VW ads I pulled from &quot;Life&quot; from about,
say, as many people as there are in New Jersey.  So, because I am both
selfish and lazy and don't want to keep repeating my response, I need to
tell everybody who still might want them that they're gone.  Long gone, sad
to say--early this morning.  So, perhaps there will be more in the
future--we go to quite a few auctions, and now knowing that the demand is
there, I'll look for &quot;Life&quot;, &quot;Look&quot;, etc.  If they're cheap, I'll buy, tear
the ads out, and repost.  Such a way to meet folks  :)

Thanks everybody.
