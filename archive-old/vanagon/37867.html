Subject: Vanagon clock, speedo

Not surprisingly, the clock on the 81 doesn't work. Parts Place has them for
$50. If it can be tinkered with, I would of course prefer to do that.What is
it that normally causes these things to quit? Are they fixable or are they
disposable?

The speedo works but sort of &quot;chatters&quot; at low speed and the needle bounces
wildly when at a crawl. At speed it works fine. Some times it's fine,
othertimes it's very annoying. The cable connecter is snugged up to the
speedo. When I had something like this on another car, I found a gear
actually loose on a shaft and a drop of loctite secured it. Anyone else been
through this drill that can give me a headstart before getting into it?

Thanks for your help,

Weston
