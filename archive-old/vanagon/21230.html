Subject: Re: Engine Oil Temps

My '71 camper(1641cc) always reads around 210-220 on the freeway.  Up a 
hill it gets to 230.  Some say this is high, some say it is normal.  
right now i am installing a bug-pac 72 plate cooler inside one of the 
airvents to see if it wont cool things down.  I will post the results.

&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; 	Today, when I got to work, I stuck a meat thermometer in the oil
&gt; dipstick tube, and got a reading of 210F   I did this immediately after
&gt; I shut the motor off.
&gt; 
&gt; 	Is this normal?  I've never had any quantitive values for VW oil
&gt; temps before.  I bought the thermo to check the guage vs real-life in
&gt; the porsche - dead on! - not bad for a 22+ year old guage!
&gt; 
&gt; 	If not normal, what are reasonable temps?
