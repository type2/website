I'll check -- it could be that the mechanic put in something he got out of
a wreck!!!.
Cetin





&gt;   it stopped the problem of stuttering and stumbling on my 91 automatic. now
&gt;   if Cetin's cousin got the problem fixed for $15.00, i'm gonna be kinda irate!!
&gt;   :)  can you find out exactly what kind of shielded extension he had put in
&gt;   and where in the engine compartment they put it? i'm really really curious
&gt;   about where they would have put that shielded extension.
