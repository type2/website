Subject: syncro: brake pads, wheel bearings, CVs, etc.

It's time to replace the front brake pads on my 87 syncro Westy (88K miles)
and I have a few questions for syncro owners:

1. Should the rotors be turned each time the front pads are replaced? When I
bought the van, the mechanic that did the buyer's check told me that the
rotors were too thin to be machined again and that I would have to replace
them. Is it OK to just put on the new pads without turning the rotors (and
then replace the rotors on the next pad change)? The brakes work fine now,
no pulsing on hard stops or anything.

2. What about front wheel bearings? It's common to repack these when doing
brake work on 2WD vehicles but the syncro is a different design. Looking at
the Bentley, it seems like an awful lot of work to mess with the bearings.

3. At what point (mileage) should the front CVs be inspected and repacked?

4. Is there any other maintainence I should do when replacing the pads?

I'm inclined to just replace the pads now and do a full teardown at 120K or
130K, doing the CVs, bearings and all.

Thanks,
Mark McCulley
