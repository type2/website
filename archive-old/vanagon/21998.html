Subject:      RE: VW AWNING--address



Sorry. I meant to post the address and phone# in that last post for those
interested. Address:

VW CANVAS
5505 Cordell
Austin, TX 78723

(512) 926-6195

They seem like nice VW kind of folks who promote a good Karma. Of course,
being form Texas, who knows. Still, it is Austin.
