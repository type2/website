Subject: POR-15 or Eastwood's Corroless

     Been considering getting some POR-15 for my floorpan since I've heard 
     good things about it on the list. I have some Oxysolv rust remover 
     (disolves rust and leaves zinc coating) from The Eastwood Company 
     (make auto restoration products) so called them to ask if Oxysolve was 
     compatible with POR-15. They said yes but they have a similar product 
     which is better, Corroless.  
     
     I've seen it in their catalog but never paid much attention to it. It 
     is slightly cheaper than POR-15 and is not UV sensitive according to 
     the catalog. Not really an issue since I'd paint over it (Corroless is 
     reddish-brown while POR-15 is black). My floorpan is black so would 
     paint black over POR-15 to protect from UV.
     
     Anybody actually used Corroless, or better yet both products who can 
     compare them.
     
     Thanks for any info,
     
     Jeff
