&gt; &gt;I did it!  I got the 1985 Vanagon today, left the Passat at work and

&gt; the quantity of coolant is listed as 18 quarts ... 4.5 GALLONS!!!! other
&gt; phosphate-free coolants are Sierra (also not as toxic as regular coolant)
&gt; and Zerex Extreme.  oil: i put 5 quarts in the bus when i change the filter
&gt; and oil. i'm wondering, however, about trying 4 quarts next time to see if
&gt; Derek's splash theory of heat retention is right.

I put 4.25 quarts (oil) in this last time and it's behaving a LOT 
better.  4 is too low and 4.5 is exactly at the max line.
Of course, to confuse the issue I went back to 20W-50 also....

Coolant.  If you flush the system with water, and then put coolant in, 
you should expect to put about 2 gallons.  I ended up with a little less 
than two gallons, but I've had to open the system a few times since then 
and have used up the third gallon.

Manuals.  In the gopher archives are some pointers to where to get 
bentley for considerably less and testimonials from people who did.
I paid '84.

Lastly, there are several 84 and 85 owners on the list who have had their 
vehicles less than a year (I'm one).  We're all learning and leaning on 
Joel for emotional and philosophical support.
