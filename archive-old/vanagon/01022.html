Subject: What to look for in a bus?

Hi there, this is the first time that I have ever tried posting to this list,
so let's see if it works.

I have recently been looking for a bus in and around Vancouver (Canada that
is 8^), and have come across several that are in my price range (under $2000).  
Now, I was wondering what should I be expecting for a vehicle that is in this 
range.  I am willing and have the time to put some work into fixing it up.

One bus in particular that I am looking at is a '73 that the owner is asking
$1600 for.  It has some rust on the bottom 6 inches of the body all the way
around.  It has been sitting in an underground parkade for the past 6 months, 
but he recently had a new clutch put in, and about 2 years ago a rebuilt engine
was installed.  I went to take a look at it last night, and it ran well, though
it seemed to be idling quite low once it warmed up.  He has some extra parts
and manuals that would go along with it.

I know this is a very brief description, but if anyone has any thoughts or
advice they would be much appreciated.  Now lets see if I can post this 
thing 8^).
