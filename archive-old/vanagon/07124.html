Ok what have we got so far for LP On indicators: green LED's; Red LED's;
Blue LED's and a gauge. OK. Green and Blue LEDs seem to be associated
with the later models possibly after 83.  Are we all agreed that 
regardless of
colour that the LED glows faintly when first lit and then gets brighter
as the flame intensifies? (this is kind of interesting). The gauge may be
an aftermarket device....

Also wrt LEDS, I took apart the panel and found the battery LED system is
hooked up to a potentiometer. The previous owner had noted that regardless
of the charge of the battery the green LED would never show; upon closer
inspection I was able to rotate the pot slowly so that at full charge a
green LED was possible. The key thing here would be to know a base point
at which full charge is present  and work from there - Hayne's gives
apretty good description of this. DC
