&quot;Anyone care to describe how &quot;easy&quot; it is to bleed the clutch lines
in an '84 Vanagon?&quot;

The book said that the clutch system can only be pressure bled.  I couldn't 
understand a reason for that, so I just did it the old fashion way.  I have 
to admit, it took about a dozen open bleeder - push clutch - close bleeder - 
release clutch cycles before I saw any evidence that I was getting anywhere, 
but other than that, the process went as expected.
