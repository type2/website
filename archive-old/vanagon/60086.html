&gt; What if you moved to a location that currently has that time?? I
&gt; guess you would spend atleast $251 getting there though (depending on
&gt; how far off it is......).

Well, it *is* pretty far off.  I'd probably end up in the Pacific or
something.  ;-)

&gt; What if you disconnect the battery and reattach at the precise time
&gt; (I think it resets to 12:00).

Damn, that's a novel idea.  Why not?  (Guess I'll find out whether the
security code *taped* to the top of my factory radio is right.)
