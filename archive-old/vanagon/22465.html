&gt; &gt;How many people out there would be interested in
&gt; &gt;buying a dual exhaust for there wasserboxer?
&gt; 
&gt;

&gt; '87. How would the smog stuff work? two cats, one for each muffler? two O2
&gt; sensors?                            ^^^^^^^^

Now there's a guy after my own heart.  Two cats tied to each muffler!  :)

What's that hissing sound?  :D
