&gt;&gt;and...  has anyone with a vanagon PS system replaced the filter in the

&gt;&gt;for the 'zecret fluid'.  This is getting too costly.  Bentley says ATF 
&gt;&gt;Dextron fluid, may rinse with it first. My fluid looks like rusty bath 
&gt;&gt;water, anyone flushed theirs out? Tips?  TIA

All Vanagons were originaly equipped with ATF as the power steering fluid.
 The &quot;Secret&quot; formula fluid was a change over to improve cold weather
operation.  The system will often scream and howl on startup with ATF in cold
weather.  I use Mobil-1 synthetic ATF.  Howl lasts about 1 minute in 0 degree
weather.  I change the oil every 30K. 126K on FunBus with no hint of fluid
leaks.  Castrol GT power steering fluid will also work on tired systems that
need a little more push or that are starting to leak.  More seal softening
additives than ATF.
