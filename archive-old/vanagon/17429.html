Subject:      FFriday: yet another short take ...


from that famous broadway hit by Jerome Kern, ShowBus!
                                 (original idea from Mikie Wrong)


Ole Man Highway

He don't haul taters, he don't haul cotton,
and them that does, well, they is soon forgotten,
that old man highway keeps right on rollin' along,
    rollin' along.

You and me, we sweat, sweat and strain,
Windshields all smeared up with bugs and rain,
Dodge that dog, and drive like hell,
Hit some little punk, and you land in jail.

I is weary, sick of driving,
My legs are aching and my eyes are crying,
but Ole Man Highway keeps right on rollin' along,
    rollin' along.
