Wow - only $4500 in seven years? I'd say you're definitely among 
the lucky minority, especially with no head gasket replacement!

When I bought my &quot;new&quot; used '89 Syncro (92K miles) a couple of 
months ago I added up all the POV's service costs (probably not 
counting a few oil changes and that rear-ender - given away by 
broken glass under the carpet- that he didn't tell me about) and 
the grand total was: $11,826!!!  This was all dealer service and 
included a new water pump (an infant mortality at 800 miles) a 
Syncro tranny rebuild at 80K and head gaskets both sides.  

Being the conservative investment banker that he was, the POV 
bought an extended service contract and VW ate most of the 
repairs. You'd think he'd been reading this list!
