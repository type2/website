&gt; I was wondering if there are any other road trippers without money out
&gt; there?  If there are, where do you camp for the night while you are on the
&gt; road?  Rest Stops?  How much is a state park per night out west?  How much
&gt; are national parks?  Are there any other options?  Can I write anything but
&gt; questions?

The book is called Don Wright's Save-A-Buck camping, and is supposed to
have tons of information on cheap places to camp.  Supposedly all of the
campgrounds listed in the book are $4 and under.  It is a useful book, but
I have some problems with it:

1.  Only way campgrounds can be referenced is by the city they are nearest.
	Makes it hard to find a particular campground.  You need to have a
	good map around to use this book.

2.  Book I bought was a 1992 printing.  If I pay $12 for a book, it shouldn't
	be 3 years old.

3.  Many of the campgrounds they list are in fact a lot more than $4 now.

Still, it's a good source of cheap places to camp.  When I want to camp
for free, I go to the most deserted places I can find, usually on dirt
roads.  There are plenty in the mountains of California.  When I just need
to park overnight to sleep, I often park on the dirt roads in between
fields.  Only problem with this is that farmers tend to get up real early,
so you have to be ready to move at dawn.  National parks are usually cheaper
than state parks, which are cheaper than KOA/Private.  The cheapest of all
are BLM campgrounds, but they are usually primitive.  Of course, that's okay
with MOST OF US.  =)  I have never slept at a rest stop or truck stop.  There
are always better, quieter places nearby.  P.S.  I have no money, and I am
the king of camping cheap!
