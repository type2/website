Subject:  General EV &amp; Vanagon Wolf quest.

Hello,

I joined this discussion group about a month ago, and am ashamed
 that I did not introduce myself earlier.  I have been feeling a bit intimidated
I am new to actually differentiating VW#s apart, but have had a love for
them for over 20 years.  I like the styles and interior design!

My family had several micro buses: 1959?35hp , 1963?50hp, and a
1960's beetle.
I mainly remember the beetle and looking at pop-up buses.
I have owned a beetle and fastback, but at the time, years
didn#t really matter, just getting around.  I loved the fastback.  It was 
sort of sporty.

I have been observing the group trying to formulate information about
VWs in general.  What people like, dislike, and what the dealers are
currently providing.
I want to get a bus / semi-camper but have several questions.

What I want is a bus that:
seats 7 to 8
fold down seats to form a bed
table
light over the table
quick release seats to provide extra-room

I don#t need the Pop-up but find them neat.
Wouldn#t mind a water reserve and hose sprayer.
  (I saw one of these in a 1995 full camper EV that
    Was accessed through the back entrance.)

Questions:
Should I be concerned about purchasing a EV Weekender because
there were so few made.  Is there any reason to be afraid?  The
engine is an Audi?  So, should parts be hard to come by if (forbid)
there were problems?

What about a late model Vanagon Wolf. Edition (1991?)
Are there other options that provide the features I like?
                        
I don#t have lots of $ resources and I am not a mechanic.  So I
want a sound engine to begin with and now of any special needs
or problems.  For instance, I spoke with a lady this past weekend
who owns a 1987 Vanagon Wolf. Ed.  And loves it!!  But,
she told me of a situation about the water.  Something about the
overflow water reserve didn#t work and thus to be very careful
about low water levels.  That the engine is aluminum and pitted
easily thus ruining the whole engine causing them to need to be
rebuilt.  She said that they were recalled (only if owner was aware)
and that the dealer paid for part replacements but not labor. 
She wasn#t happy about this.

Any helpful comments are highly appreciated!
