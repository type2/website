&gt;  That's why I'm unsubscribing - it's a great list but not too relevant to
&gt;  me. The best part for me is reading about the excellent trips you all make

&gt; in
&gt;  the US but hey, France, Italy, Norway, Russia etc are on my doorstep so
&gt;  I'm not too jealous!
&gt;  
&gt;  I suppose we Brits shouldn't even have the right to subscribe to your
&gt;  US-centric mailing list?  Whatever happened to free speech?

I for one wish the list wasn't quite so US-centric.  Although I know
primarily about US spec Vanagons, I LOVE to hear about Vanagons
(Transporters, Caravelles, Kombis) in other parts of the world.  Please
consider staying on the list, encouraging others outside the US to join, and
tell us about your vehicles and your travels with them.
