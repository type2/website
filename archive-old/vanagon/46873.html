Subject: while we're on the coolant subject

Hi.  Two more questions that probably have been discussed.

1) How are y'all changing the coolant.....folowing the manual or cutting 
the hoses and installing a t-fitting or what?  Having someone else do it?

2) The only phosphate free coolant (NON-vw) near me is a brand call 
Sierra.  Is this acceptable for VWs AND if so, can it be mixed with the 
Autobahn brand?


Thanks,
david
