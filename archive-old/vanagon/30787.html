Subject: Re: dashboard altars &lt;Spelling,dude,spelling&gt;

I used to have a ceramic Horned Toad on the dash of my old '68 Chevelle. The
girlfriend asked what it was. I told her that I won it as the &quot;World's
Biggest Bullsh...er Award&quot;  She laughed and pretended to believe me. We've
been married five years +.  She believes me even more now. =)

&gt;I've seen some shag carpeting on a dash....but 
&gt;I think that qualifies as a dash ALTER -- I think 
&gt;what we're talking about is a dash ALTAR --
