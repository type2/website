&gt;      Not too bad pricewise Paul, but what about that Syncro you found?
&gt;      100K miles could be ok, but read the archives on head leaks.
&gt; 
&gt;      Also, while you are there, check the recent archives, there is
&gt;      a very nice sounding Syncro Westie, 86 (or was it 87) with 85,000
&gt;      miles, known history since new, for $12,500.  In New Mexico,
&gt;      but that shouldn't stop anyone chasing the ultimate VW Bus.
&gt;      Besides, they'll work out delivery!

Paul, 
I live in the New York, Connecticut area (school/parents, respectively) 
and am planning a trip to New Mexico over the New Year. If you're 
interested in &quot;New&quot; Vehicle I might be able to check it out for you 
and/or help with the delivery...
