Subject: Re: Syncro FS in York PA

I'm going to PA this Saturday after I help my Dad rig his new yacht
(yaught) ...whatever.  I'll take the Syncro (if it's still for sale) for
a test drive and inspect it.  I'll post all the findings Monday night
when I get back.

It's an '87, 103,000 miles, cream with tan and grey &quot;4WD&quot; graphics and a
cloth tan interior, alloy wheels, new rubber, diff. lock,  $6000 asking
price.
