I use it on my road and mountain bikes. Works well. I also use it to clean
the engine compartment of my vanagon, works better if you soak engine with a
hot solution of the stuff, then go over stubborn spots with a spray bottle of
the stuff neat. 

It has become my &quot;house degreaser&quot;, not as aggressive as some solvents but
much, much nicer to work with.
