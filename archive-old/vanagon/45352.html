&gt; &gt;         Looked at a '59 today here in Austin (I believe it was posted to
&gt; &gt; the list a few days back) and it has some hardcore cancer. Down by the
&gt; &gt; crossmembers that the floorpan rests on. Hardcore. Seems to me this is real
&gt; &gt; difficult to repair, any thoughts? The fellow has done a decent job on the
&gt; &gt; interior, it's in pretty fair shape, just a few spots with water damage.
&gt; &gt; Cute paint job too, real hippied out. The wife loves it, but I'm afraid
&gt; &gt; it's beyond me since I can't weld.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyone can weld.
&gt; 
&gt; Look at my '54 to see a real rust case.

Ditto to what Thom said.  Now Thom is a real persevering kinda guy so he
gets the job done in a fairly quick amount of time.  But I'm not gonna
let that stop me.  I just gotta get my other honey-dos done first in
then I'm going to go great guns on my single cab.  It's just not up
front in the queue right now.
