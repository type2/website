Subject: Rattling in headliner

There is an annoying rattle in the headliner in the rear of my
86 Syncro. It sounds like it is probably some sort of support 
structure that has come unglued from the roof. 

Has anyone else had this problem and if so, how did you fix it?

Has anyone removed and replaced the headliner of a later model
Vanagon? Any gotcha's I should be aware of? 

TIA
