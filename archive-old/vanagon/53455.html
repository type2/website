Subject: GEX Heads


Does anyone have anything good/bad to say about GEX Heads ? I'm curious as
to wether I'm having bad luck or are GEX Heads a problem all around.

I used a couple of remanufactured heads ofrom GEX on my 82' Vanagon (2.0L,
aircld, fi) during a rebuild in 94'. Recently, I blew a head gasket, so
have done a partial teardown.

Pistons and cylinders are A o.k. (from GEX as well), but both heads need
to be completely rebuilt (after only 15K miles). Several of the guides and
valves are shot and apparently the inside of the head wasn't properly
machined (GEX ?). Cost of rebuild is near the same as cost or rebuilt
heads from GEX. Given my luck with GEX and the reliability and experise of
my local machine shop, I'm having the machine shop do the rebuild.

Any comments ?
