&gt;???? Vanagon mag wheels - will consider steel wheel covers that look
&gt;     like mags. &quot;Tom&quot; (602) 224-8085 days, (602) 926-4787 eves (AZ)


This ad was placed by a friend of Rusty VanBondos back in June with the
intentions of it going in the NEATO letter. The Tom name was a typo
somewhere down the line ;). The Vanagon wheels were been found at the VW
Classic in Irvine, CA. 
I lost a plastic basket weave hub cap on my &quot;83 Westy in early June.
Searched everywhere for replacements. Prefered the steel/aluminum wheel
covers that looked like mags. Thought that they'd be cheap. Found that
locals didn't have them or had them in (literally) run over condition for
$25. each! Didn't want to pay the WCM repalcement price for the plastic
basket weave. Cherry and I went to the SOTO/Classic Weekend June 10th etc
and showed up with the stock black wheels without any hubcaps. Someone
offered to sell me a set of the correct later model Vanagon mags for
$500.00. I smiled and took the info but defered &quot;to check my budget.&quot; A fair
price for them considering the lack of availability, I suppose but, if
you're near broke then he could have quoted a six figure price and it would
have been the same likelyhood of getting them. The next day at the actual VW
Classic event I was trolling the ailses of the partswap and nearly dropped
my water. Slippery hands, not a personal problem. ;) I saw a gentleman in
his very late 50s selling parts and looked really out of place. He had some
old aircooled parts that attracted most people to one side of his space. His
prices were unusually reasonable (read: ridiculously cheap). &lt;OEM chrome
front symbols for $15 each etc&gt;. Someone suggested that he check the going
prices before the day got started but he said that he didn't care and was in
a &quot;cleanout mode.&quot; Too cool!! In the corner were a stack of wheels half
hidden by more interesting parts, cardboard and his family that ended up
being a set of one piece 14&quot; Carrol Shelby magnesuim wheels that look
exactly like the VW issue fake mag look-alike wheel covers with center caps.
These wheels had the correct '70ish ('68&gt;?) to Vanagon bolt pattern! He said
that his brother had them on his '79 Bus for years. Asked on the price. $100
for the set (way cool). Being the nice guy I am and considering the
atmosphere of the swap negotiations I countered on a lower price settling at
$85.00 for FOUR!!!! :))))). After major polishing and minor adaption of
front drums, they work great and look great.
