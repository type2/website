Subject: Re: VW America denies recall

I know this won't make you feel better, but to my knowledge the VW customer
service line has NEVER acknowledged any recall of ANY kind for any car.
Many on the Corrado list have called about recalls and have gotten
stonewalled.

But take heart!  Persistance can sometimes be rewarded, I have heard that
there are times when the area reps are pushed hard enough they relent, and
even the customer service jerks will help out, but with something as big as
total loss due to fire it may take some doing.

First you need to get documentation of the recall either from the NTHSA or
from a local dealership.  Then you must establish that the recall work was
never performed (the dealer might be able to find out that info). Then get
to the area rep, and pressure him.  (play up the safety angle).

I hope this helps a little.  Good Luck

James
