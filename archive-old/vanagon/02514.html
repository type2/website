Subject: Bentley and minor repairs...

Excuse my naivete (spelling?!?!), but what is the Bentley book and where
can I get a copy??  I've heard it mentioned numerous times here.  Also, 
I'm planning to do some cosmetic repairs on the bus this coming weekend
and could use some quick advise.

1. The springs in the driver's seat are poking me!!!  They aren't poking
through the vinyl or anything, but they'll hurt like hell on my trip to 
Texas in a couple of weeks.  I was thinking of taking the guts (springs
and whatever that stuff is that VW calls padding...looks like hay to me)
out and replacing them with a piece of plywood with foam on top.  Will 
this work or can people give me other suggestions???

2. I don't mean to start another oil discussion, but I'm moving to Texas
(hhhhhhhooooooooootttttttttttttt!!!!!!) and want to change the oil to match
the climate.  Can anyone down south suggest a viscousity???

I'll probably have more questions later in the week once I do a survey of 
the needed repairs/alterations.  Thanks for any help!!!!
