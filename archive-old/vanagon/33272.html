&gt;&gt;This is hog wash!  There's no analogy here.  Who is to say what &quot;Genuine&quot; oil
&gt;
&gt;you wash your hogs in synthetic oil?? wow. now THAT's a hog-lover. bet it
&gt;keeps the mosquites and ticks off them hogs real good! :)
&gt;
&gt;and &quot;Genuine&quot; oil is only when it says &quot;genuine&quot; on the can. course, nowadays
&gt;everthin comes in them little plastic bottles, and it's hard to read them
&gt;little bitty letters.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;But with motor oil there's no sentiment value and thus no analogy.
&gt;
&gt;well, i don't know ... down round here, if you give a girl a quart of oil,
&gt;especially if you wrap it up real purty, it's kinda like you've jumped over
&gt;the broom together. if she takes it, that is. lots of girls won't take a
&gt;quart of oil from a fellow ... especially if she figures he's about a quart
&gt;low already. :)  and the girls what do take the oil, well, they want only the
&gt;best ... none of this Uncle Bubba's Recycled Dino Surprise stuff. the best
&gt;impression can be made with a case of straight 30W High Detergent Valvoline.
&gt;:)  &lt;cause they've seen that name on the sides of racing cars&gt;
&gt;
&gt;besides ... you can't keep a car running with a diamond or one of them cubic
&gt;whatevers.
&gt;
&gt;remember, folks ... A Diamond may be a Joy Forever,
&gt;                    but a Quart of Oil will get you nearly 3,000 miles!!
