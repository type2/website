Subject:       overalls

speaking of overalls, i just got my new pair.  the herringbone cotton 
ones.  long sleeve.  size XLT:)  the old ones had gotten a piece of 
welding splatter on the zipper so they didn't zip no more... had a 
couple clothes pins to hold them shut...  grease smudges where i, uh, 
needed frequent access shall i say. i was quite a sight in them.

Say, is it overalls or coveralls.  i think there is a geographic 
distinction here.  whaddya y'all call 'em from yer neck o' the woods?
