Subject: Rocker Panels

        Hi All

        Jim &amp; Tomh

Seems I rember a thread around here about this topic,

and as I get further into rust removal of my 59 pickup,

I'v decided to go looking for thies things, some of the 

local have them and some can get them for buses, but are 

not shure they can get them for trucks, and they dont know if the 
bus version will work on a truck. 

Now I know the bus and trucks are different on the back, 

but..... any one know if the bus rocker panels will fit and 

work out on trucks???

In the thread that was!!!! I think ya gave out some names of 
manufactures, could ya put a rock in it and throw it at me again.

Thanks Laurie
