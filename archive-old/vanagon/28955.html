&gt;Do you know the difference between a EuroVan driver and a BayWindow
&gt;driver....
&gt;
&gt;A Bay Window driver has to keep the windows closed to keep the
&gt;heat in....A EuroVan driver has to open the windows to let the
&gt;heat out!!


Understandable. EV owners have more hot air to spare... obviously!   :-P
