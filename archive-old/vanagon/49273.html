Subject: Re: need advice on buying a used van

My '87 has 138,000 miles on it now.  Original heads.  I recently did add
a helping of Bars' Leaks, because the heads were leaking.  There is still
some coolant loss, so do end up adding about a quart of coolant every 600
miles or so...


One important question you should ask is: which type of A/C?
if it is the type that is mounted in the rear cargo area ceiling, then it is
not  as good as the one that has the ceiling wents through the length of the
bus, mounted top center.

$2,300.00 sounds way too good...  Is there something they are not telling
you about, maybe???

&gt;Hi Volks, I am looking into buying a '87 GL to upgrade to the larger engine,
&gt;power steering, and A/C which my '84 doesnt have. the body is very straight ,
&gt;paint good, and has the optional &quot;sport stripe&quot; kit ( wowee!!) and those neat
&gt;&quot;carat&quot; alloy wheels. the price is very reasonable, I think, ($ 2300),  but
&gt;there are a few drawbacks. First is that  the odometer reads 157k. At this kind
&gt;of mileage I am sure the head gaskets have been replaced, but the current
&gt;owners,( very short term that is,) don't have any repair records. How many of
&gt;you 2.1 liter wasserboxer owners out there have this kind of mileage or more on
&gt;your engines? What is the average interval for head gaskets? My '84 which has
&gt;110k on it had the head gaskets replaced at 80k by the PO. What other problems
&gt;should I look for on a hi mileage van? The second problem is that the shifter
&gt;linkage is messed up and I cant get it in gear, but I have a friend who had the
&gt;same problem with his van and it was just the shift linkage,and not a
problem w/
&gt;the tranny. I ran It for a while and the coolant light did not come on so I
&gt;guess this is a plus.    
&gt;
&gt;Any advice would be appreciated ASAP as iI'm going down to look at it again
this
&gt;evening and go over it w/ a fine toothed comb. 
&gt;
&gt;thanks
