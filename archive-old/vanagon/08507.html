Subject: Success! (cold oil warning...)

Well I finally got the time to replace the .9 bar oil pressure sensor
(the one near the oil pump) on my 87, and marvel of marvels, the problem
she is fixed!!   To remind the reader, this is the special 1987 cold oil
warning system, that flashes the oil light and sounds a buzzer only when
the engine is cold and rpms go over 2000 and your sensor is broken.  
Feels wierd not to have to warm the van up for 10 minutes in the
morning, though, and I still flinch when I rev it over 2000 the first
time...

Thanks to Joel for pulling yet another cure out of his hat, and thanks
to all who shared symptoms and sympathy.   This is a great group!

Dave
