Subject: Re: Interesting Discovery about my '54

Thom,

&gt;From my recollection, clocks in the deluxe Type2s were electrical
since at least 1960....thats the oldest bus I have personal knowlege
about...I would suspect that it might be as early as '58 or so
based on the fact that the Ghia had an electric clock in '58...
