Subject: Bumper Stickers (revisited)

     
     
     howdy -
     
     There was a thread a bit ago about creating bumper stickers (sort of 
     like a passive 'secret' handshake).  I was cleaning out my office and 
     ran across an ad for bumper sticker blanks that can be fed through a 
     dry toner laser printer.   This will limit the ability to have color 
     though.  The company is  Williams &amp; Macias and can be reached at 
     800-752-4400.
     
     I'm not connected with the company - nor have I tried their products.
     
     cheers
     
     john
