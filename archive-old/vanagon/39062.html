Yes, you would be correct on this count; the engine produces
140hp _at_ 4500rpm.  The article makes no mention of max.
torque _at_ Xrpm, but it would not be unreasonable to guess
that it makes upwards of 140lb/ft _at_ 2200-2400rpm, or
so.  

This vehicle is also supposed to have the &quot;Plus&quot; suspension
and electronic traction control.

Perhaps another way to go w/ this vehicle is to put a TDI
engine in, with a Syncro option...yeah, that's the ticket...
