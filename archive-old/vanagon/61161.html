&gt;Does anybody does how to remove the original radio on a 87 Wolfsburg?

i can't recall if there is a rear strap on the OEM radios, but check
through the ashtray hole first. watch out for the sharp edges of the
hole. :(

then you'll need FOUR pieces of wire, the same size as the four little
holes in the corners of the faceplate of the radio (didn't notice those
before, eh? :)  ... you stick the wires into the holes until they go
past the resistance. THEN you can pull the radio out. the wires release
some sort of &quot;catch&quot; in there, and it's a royal bitch to get the thing
out any other way (i did it, but had to damn near dis-assemble my dash,
glovebox, heater panel, etc) to do it. THEN i found out about the wires!
