Subject: Cig lighter won't light.

Hey volks,

I've got this cigareette lighter in my 85 Westy that has a green trim ring
that is supposed to be illuminated when the ignition is on (I think).
 Anyway, I found out why the little green trim ring won't light up.  The bulb
was blown.  I tried to find a sutable replacement at FLAPS and radio shack.
 No luck.  I haven't tried the dealor yet.  (don't like to go there).  

First, is this a standard accessory for an 85 Van?   Does anyone know where I
can find a replacement bulb?  (The bulb is built into a small plastic housing
like the dash lights are, except a different style).

Thanks in advance.
