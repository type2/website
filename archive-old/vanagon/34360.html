&gt;  OK, got you all beat, I watched a French movie years ago about some people 
&gt;  travelling across Africa in a Citroen 'Deux Cheveaux', tiny 2 cyl aircooled 
&gt;  car.  They got caught in massive floods, not deep, but expansive.  With aid 
&gt;  of the locals canoes they took the engine/trans and wheels across the 'lake' 
&gt;  then wrapped the entire car in a huge canvas tarpaulin and towed it across, 
&gt;  floating behind the canoes.  Land-Ho , Tim Smith

Hey, I've driven one of those!!!  very funny car.  has tons of
character, mainly because the 'character' resembles that of a mule!!!
Its maneuverability was definitely worse than a VW bus (old,
front-wheel-drive design), power not too bad in city Traffic, even
with the two little cylinders.  The shifter comes out of the
dashboard, and shifts worse than any VW brick I've driven.
The inside space was remarkably good for the considering the 
outside dimensions.  I loved the reverse-swinging doors.

At the time ( circa 1979 ) my wife (well, then my girlfriend)
liked it a lot and I could not complain about the attention it got
me!!!
