Subject: BBS for Baja Run


I've set up a message board for the Baja Run trip. It can be accesed from
Transporter Trips &amp; Tours on the type2 home page:

http://www.type2_dot_com/

You can talk about the finer (and coarser ;) points of touring Mexico
there. Also if you aren't going on the tour but have spent some time
road-tripping in Mexico and you can share your experience, I know that
would help some folks who haven't been South before.
