Subject: Re: air bags redux


&gt;I'm not sure who's leading the charge *for* air bags, but I do notice that
&gt;Consumer Reports always complains when they're not an option.
&gt;(Yes I know VW owners don't like CR because they always get dissed so bad,
&gt;but a  lot of people *do* read/respect CR's opinion!)
&gt;


The charge is led by the insurance industry, naturally.  And public safety
orgs as well.  Don't forget there are a lot of people who don't like seat
belts either, and decry the laws that make them mandatory.  They change
their tunes the first time they or their loved one's faces go through a
windshield in an otherwise low impact accident.  Darwinism works!!
