Subject: NEED REPUTABLE MECHANIC IN DENVER AREA!

Tag Volks,

I'm eye balling a syncro from afar, and am expecting to take it home on
the condition of an expert opinion or two.

I would appreciate your suggestions for vanagon syncro specialists
(dealers and independents) in and around the Denver area from which I
could get a reliable and professional diagnosis on the condition of this
van and all of its parts.

Please let me know of any I should steer clear of too.

Thanks!

John
