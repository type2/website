Subject: Speedometer

On departure from the GNATT gang I became conerned that my speedometer 
was not right (having been informed so by Dave Schwarze), so I checked it 
with a stopwatch and an attempt and a steady speed. I determined that 
when it was reading 65 I was really going about 57 and when it was 
reading 70 I was really going 62.  Now I know why I've been getting good 
mileage, why the engine has lasted so well and why it always seems like 
it takes us so long to get there.  

So. Can someone tell me if there's any way the cable or the EGR box could 
be causing this, or is it most certainly the speedometer itself?

Thanks for any help.
