Hey!!&gt; 
&gt; I must confess also that I too really do like the people on this group.
&gt; Even Ric.  I also like the talk that goes away from vanagons.  It usually
&gt; leads back to the point.  If it doesn't get there?  Well my vanagon often
&gt; doesn't get there either.  Stuart Hutton
&gt; Ray, you have my best hopes! 


   I own a Ford Pinto, 1971,

does that make me a Flaming Vanagon ?  (G)

would someone please send me a 1.9 long block diesel for my Vanagon?

thnaks....
