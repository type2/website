I know that place...

That guy seems to do a bang-up business restoring (almost exclusively)
Bettle convertibles. Has a small lot teeming with mostly bugs. I've seen
Ghia restos in there, too, the sort of
lowered/shopped/channeled/rolled/tucked abominations that are popular in
magazines. There are usually an abandoned bus or three stuck somewhere in
front but if he actually restores them, they don't show up on the street
around here.

Most of the &quot;75 assorted VWs&quot; seem to be moldering carcasses; he will let
you pick and pull for *very* little money but the stuff is well picked
over. But I have got good seats there before. Mostly you call and he says
&quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no.&quot; Last thing I asked about was pre-71 wheels and there were
none at all, which gives you an idea about his inventory...

It's located next door to a porno movie theater in a very poor part of
Memphis. If you bought it you'd have to move it unless you have no
self-respect whatsoever. And a lot of the stuff is not worth moving, from
the looks of it.

But he does seem to stay very busy. I have no opinion on the price; the
place has been for sale for a long time.
