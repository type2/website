&gt; In other words, insurance co's are profit-making institutions, as any legit
&gt; business must be. But &gt; like you've described.
&gt; 
&gt; Any chance that government restrictions before the election, were so severe,
&gt; that even legit, clean companies could only lose money? I have no info

	The thing that we have to do is to stop thinking of insurance 
companies as being legit businesses.  If you think the legal thieft at 
Las Vegas is legit, you've got to love the insurance biz.   Banks, too!
