Subject: RE: 87 Wolfs. Power Door Locks.

Based off of your descriptions, I do have the power door locks.  I
removed the sliding door panel &amp; also found the 'motor' for the lock.  I
found the same in the passenger side door.  But upon checking the driver
side door, it appears that the PO removed it (unsure as to why).  Where
do the connectors (I believe they were connected to the 'motor') lead
to?  I'm also finding 2nd set of unused connectors moving away from the
1st set of connectors.  Was something else relating to the power door
locks removed?

I also checked for the fuse for the door locks &amp; based on the manual it
is also missing.  The owners manual states that it would be above the
fuse box.  All I found were a panel where relays are connected and 2
fuses.  Going from left to right, a 25Amp &amp; 10Amp fuse.  If I read the
Owners Manual correctly, the 10Amp fuse should be on the left &amp; a 20Amp
fuse should be on the right.  Is this correct?  Would installing a 20Amp
fuse &amp; moving the passenger side 'motor' to the driver side?

&gt;&gt; I was checking out the VW Dictionary  in the archives &amp; noticed for the
&gt;&gt;  87 1/2 Wolfs. Ed Vanagon under E. Miscellaneous .....   Power door locks
&gt;&gt;  including side door and rear hatch.  I'm the 3rd owner of an 87 Wolfs.
&gt;&gt;  Ed Vanagon &amp; never realized that it should have power door locks.  I
&gt;&gt;  always have to lock the passenger door, side door &amp; rear hatch manually.
&gt;
&gt;I thought that all 87-1/2 WLEs had them, but perhaps you don't have them??
&gt;
&gt;To check &amp; see if you do, look on the rear side of the passenger side 'B'
&gt;pillar.  This is the pillar that the front passenger door latches to.  On the
&gt;back side of this pillar (where the sliding door closes to) there should be a
&gt;black plastic rectangular thing (about 2&quot; tall x 1.25&quot; wide) with 4 brass
&gt;cylinders (about 1/4&quot; dia) protruding out from it.  These are the electrical
&gt;contacts where power for the locks enters the sliding side door when it is
&gt;closed.  If you have these contacts, you have power door locks.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;  1)  What do I have to check to get the Power door locks to work again?
&gt;
&gt;Check the fuse.  After that it's amater of knowing how to troubleshoot
&gt;electrical systems that would be too long to describe here.
&gt;  
&gt;&gt;  2)  Is it going to cost an arm &amp; a leg to have the dealer get it to work?
&gt;
&gt;Depends on the problem &amp; how long it takes to find.  If it's a loose wire
&gt;that they find quickly it shouldn't cost much.  Then again, it could take
&gt;them ours to sort it out and that would cost bucks.
&gt;
&gt;Good luck,
