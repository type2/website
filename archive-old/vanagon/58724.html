In a message dated 97-04-21 21:09:30 EDT, you write:

&lt;&lt; Also in 1989 VW had a Wolfsburg edition Vanagon - it had a
 bold diagonal stripe upholstery pattern.  &gt;&gt;

so the only difference between the '89 Carat and the '89 Wolfsburg Ed. was
that the Wolfs. ed. had the diagonal stripe upholstry?
