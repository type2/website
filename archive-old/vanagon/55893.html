I am back from work. I've already received a couple of emails suggesting
it would be a good idea to post &quot;chapters&quot; of my panamerican
experience.I think I'll start this week, but don't want to comit to
regular postings. In them, I'll be as brief as possible, but feel free
to forward any comments, questions, etc. 
On the side:

-&quot;Tierra del Fuego&quot; (Land of Fire), called that way because fires were
the first traces of inhabitants that Spanish conquistadores saw from
their boats while incursionating into the Beagle Channel. The locals
(the Onas) used these big fires as a way to stay warm.

-For those of you who are wondering about the Darien Gap. There is just
no way. No matter how Syncroed you might be.Swamps, mosquitoes, drug
dealers, guerrilla, etc. It is said that the gap has been kept roadless
not only because it would be a major engineering enterprise, but because
Panama is not really interested in being connected with Colombia.(They
think that Colombians will not bring anything good to their country, and
that their cows would transmit aphthous (disease) to theirs). 
 
-&quot;South 55&quot; sounds great to me too. (In reply to Coyote's message)
