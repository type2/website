Subject: One More '66 Question, 

	Dyer writes:
the dog-house shroud has a small (mebbe 1/2 inch) pipe sticking out the 
*top* of the shroud off to one side a bit.  

	This is the forced-air tap for your friendly charcoal canister
evaporative emissions system. A '66 probably hasn't got a charcoal
canister, but if you buy an air cleaner that matches your shroud you'll
find TWO similar sized pipes going into it- one for the oil breather
connection on the oil filler and the other for the charcoal canister.

	The charcoal canister in my '70 is strapped onto the top
of the engine compartment and has three hoses connected to it- two
large diameter and one small. The large hoses lead from the fan shround
to the canister and then from canister to air cleaner. The small hose goes
out above the battery and off to a steel pipe which goes off in the
direction of the fuel filler and cap.

	The theory behind this is obviously that gas fumes go to the
charcoal canisterm, where they are absorbed. When the engine is
running, air from the fan blows through the canister and carries out
some or all of the accumulated fumes. 

	Ah, so our later, smog-legal, engines are SUPERCHARGED! :)
