&gt; While the best of those TDI motors aren't currently imported to
&gt;the American continent, at least by crossing the Canadian border and
&gt;settling for the little 4 cylinder version, you could visit a salvage
&gt;yard and obtain a genuinely efficient motor.  Getting a 5 cylinder 2.5
&gt;liter VW/Audi TDI from Europe is my dream for repowering a Vanagon
&gt;Westy.    &lt;snip&gt; 
&gt;Blue

I have driven a TDI Passat with the 4 cyl 90 someting HP TDI.  What an
engine!  What performance!  I have heard a rumour that the 120 HP version
may be offered in the Eurovan in the next year or two.  Apparently VWs
problem is that they can not produce TDI motors fast enough to meet the
demand.

This would be a dream motor in any vehicle.
