Subject:       ATK/VEGE Engines

I've not seen this rebuilder talked about so here's some info:

I just called (800.421.3746) ATK/VEGE in Santa Ana, CA and they SEEM 
to have a good product but my only basis for this is a phone 
conversation.  They remanufacture European engines, possibly IN 
Europe but definately with Euorpean O.E. parts.

For example, on the VW air-cooleds here's what they do:
all German components
balanced
cc'd
30 minute run-in with specs re-set, readjusted after cool-down

a typical 2.0l  would be around $1600 which includes a $200 core.  
sorry, no wasserboxers.  they used to carry those but were not happy 
with the quality so they dropped them. 

anybody have experiences with them?
