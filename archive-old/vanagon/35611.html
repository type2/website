Wow!  Throw $6350 (in addition to the purchase price) towards my 23-Window 
and I'm sure it would be real nice too?  And you get 2 extra windows. ;-)

&gt; I've checked this one out (via email anyway) it sounds in reasonable shape but
&gt; he wants US$7000 for it - I have a couple of paras of description if anyone's
