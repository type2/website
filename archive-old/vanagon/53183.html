Subject: Arm Rests

I remember someone on the list talking about their arm rest in the captains
chair being broken.

Well, my right rest gave-out.  I pulled the arm off and sure enough the bolt
on the bottom had broken off.  I thought I was going to have to drill it out
until I noticed that it was not a blind hole.  I pulled back the material and
just used a pair of pliers to unscrew the rest of the bolt out the back.

I could not find a bolt the right length so got one (metric) a little longer
and am happy to report that my right arm is resting fine.

Craig, '86 Sycro Westy
