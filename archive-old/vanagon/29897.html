Subject: oil light and brakes

Somebody (Matt D.?) wrote about their diesel having oil pressure light on
and brake booster failing at the same time. Yes, there could be a
relationship here.  In fact, the two systems do have something in common
on a diesel.  The diesel vacuum pump and oil pump are both driven from the
intermediate shaft which is turned by the smooth side of the timing belt. 
Actually, the i. shaft drives the vacuum pump and the v. pump gear drives
the oil pump shaft.  I would check the bolt that holds the v. pump in its
hole on the engine block.  If it is missing, the v. pump could move out
and disengage from the intermediate shaft gear, thus ceasing to pump and
failing to drive the oil pump at the same time.  Also check that the gear
end of the int. shaft actually turns when you crank the engine (by hand,
of course).  I suppose the v. pump could be siezed too.  Anyway, something
might be wrong in there.  Of course, there could be other coincidental
failures too.
