Subject:       Re: No Reverse needed!

&gt; &gt; Since I don't have reverse, I put one leg out, and gave myself a 
&gt; &gt; push, to coast down the driveway.  
&gt; 
&gt; At least I'm not the only one that knows you don't realy NEED reverse.  :)
&gt; It's just handy sometimes.

Hah!  I knew there was another out there besides myself.  Yes, over 
the last three years, I have proven that Reverse &gt;&gt;IS&lt;&lt; optional.  

In fact I am petitioning VW to remove it from standard equiptment 
list, and make it an option on the luxury packages &lt;grin!&gt;
