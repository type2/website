Harald brings up a good point.  My '91 seems to be sagging on the left
(drivers side).  It is extremely low mileage at under 75,000 kms (47,000
miles).  This past summer we took several camping trips with the van full,
especially the water tank.

Has anyone else experienced the drivrs side sag on their Westy?  Any
possible long term solutions?
