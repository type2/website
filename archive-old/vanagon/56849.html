&gt; Hello everyone,
&gt; 
&gt; As I'm typing this I'm on the phone with VWoA and the rep is telling me =
&gt; the MV and the Weekender versions of the 1997 VR6 Eurovan HAVE JUST BEEN =
&gt; RELEASED! (Start calling your dealer, now.) The GL (or maybe GLS) is =
&gt; showing as not available and there's no release date yet. The rep wasn't =
&gt; sure of the price, but he quoted the $25k figure for the pre-Winnie =
&gt; conversion.
&gt; 
&gt; Since VW ships Winnebago a nearly complete van less the rear seats and =
&gt; interior trim, and Winnebago can outfit it for 10 grand more, it would =
&gt; seem VW could throw in a couple of seats, some carpet, and trim and =
&gt; still keep the cost of the van well under $30,000. Might have something =
&gt; to do with the 25% import truck tax that importing an unfinished product =
&gt; sidesteps?
&gt; 
&gt; It also seems kind of odd that VW would go to the trouble of having the =
&gt; K2 vans on their website and around the country if they weren't going to =
&gt; sell the &quot;EVR6&quot; over here.=20
&gt; 
&gt; I attended the Seattle RV show yesterday and saw both the '97 VW Eurovan =
&gt; camper and the '97 VR6 Winnebago Rialta. The EV was exactly as it was at =
&gt; the auto show last November. The Rialta, while not cheap at around =
&gt; $50,000 was on par with other conversion van campers. The big difference =
&gt; is that all the domestic van/campers give the front passenger no foot =
&gt; room because the engines protrude into the cabin so much. Imagine taking =
&gt; a cross country trip with your feet stuck in a kitchen bucket, that's =
&gt; how much foot room the domestics had.
&gt; 
&gt; The Rialta is available in three floor plans, but the most interesting =
&gt; part of the brochure is on the bottom of the last page. There's a =
&gt; postage stamp size picture of an EV with a plain Winnebago box and some =
&gt; TV station's call letters on the side. The text around the picture is, =
&gt; &quot;Winnebago Commercial Vehicles. We build commercial vehicles such as =
&gt; mobile command units for fire and police departments and mobile clinics =
&gt; for hospitals. A variety of models is available and sizes range from 22 =
&gt; to 37 feet. Each vehicle is custom designed.&quot; Some deep pockets could =
&gt; come up with a very interesting EV, indeed.=20
