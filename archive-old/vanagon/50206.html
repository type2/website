Hi everyone.  My 84 vanagon makes a loud noise when it moves faster than 40 
mph (it's a rolling noise, not a transmission noise).  The noise is 
somewhere between a grind and a hum, and today I noticed a sort of clicking 
sound at 60 mph.  My hearing is bad, so it's hard for me to figure out where 
it's comming from.  I've checked the archives and it seems like my van noise 
is likely coming from either the CV's or the wheel bearings.  Tonight I'm 
gonna see if the front wheel bearings need repacking or replacing.  Any 
comments about bearings from China (vs. anywhere else)?  They were on sale 
at a local auto parts place.

I'm not prepared to get into the CV joints, but recently someone mentioned 
using an injector needle to shoot grease into the CV's.  I tried to do this 
by pushing the CV joint boots in towards the joint, and sliding the injector 
needle along the rod (axl?).  I did shoot some grease in this way, but I 
don't know if it really did any good.  Does anyone have comments or 
suggestions about this approach?  I don't think I should puncture the boot 
with the needle, but it would help me get grease into the joint.  Winter is 
coming in Minnesota, so I really don't want to be putting a hole in my 
boots....  How does the joint-side of the boot attach?  Can this end of the 
boot be moved?

Another CV-related item.  I was only working with the CV boots that are on 
the inside of the axl, not the ones closest to the wheel (surrounded by a 
rear wheel supporting member).  I'll see if I can get a good look at those 
boots tonight.  The inner boots seemed intact, and were lightly coated with 
oil/grease and dirt (seems like that could be a sign of something).

Also, now that I have a new grease gun, I'm looking for things to grease. 
 I'll check the archives, but does anyone have a laundry list of 
maintenance-related grease points (sorry, I have not yet checked the Bentley 
or Haynes for the grease points).  Please, all advice is welcome.  Thanks in 
advance.

Tim Casey
