Subject: Delay Wipers???

Well this past week I had the opportunity/need to use the old
wipers on the '78 so lo, imagine my suprise when I accidentaly
pull the arm TOWARDS me one notch when returning and find, like
most later water pumping VW beasts I have a preset 20 sec or so
DELAY setting.  Now the control stock has nothing painted on it
to imply this, so I get out the owners manual for '78 and read
thoughoughly and no mention either.  What the hell gives here.
I mean this certainly seems origional, control stocks look just
like the old '76 or parents '77, just I got an extra position and
a preset delay, including I surmise a delay relay of some sort.
Blows my mind, hell now I want to look at the relay to see if I
can replace it with one of those ones like I put in my Corrado for
$30 that allows you to set any delay.  Does anyobody else have delay
wipers on a Bus in an apparently factory installed manner? Do I
have some warped Audi or Porshce 924 switch installed?  Anyway
confusing but they work like a charm, but unfortunately blinker does
not return on one side, so I've already ordered a lifetime supply
of those little white nylon return clips (while still available from happy
dealer for $0.45, I got 10) though with my luck they won't fit this
oddball switch.
