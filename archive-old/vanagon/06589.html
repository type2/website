&gt; So Ric Golen says:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I have a blumenvase in my '56. It made a hit with my &quot;psychologist&quot;
&gt; &gt; wife (hey...I figured if I married one, I wouldn't have to spend
&gt; &gt; money on therapy...as if I needed it!) who said the vase showed that
&gt; &gt; I was very secure with my masculinity...for whatever that was worth..
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Anyway, during the summer I would put in fresh flowers once a week
&gt; &gt; or so (make sure you keep the windows cracked a bit when the car
&gt; &gt; is parked...otherwise the flowers will bake). Alternatively,
&gt; 
&gt; Hmmm... What would your wife say if you put a venus fly trap in you
&gt; &quot;girlie man&quot; vase....   ;)
&gt; 
&gt; 
Hey, where can I get one of the blumenvasen-girlie-man things for my '74. The
flowers would be pretty and the scent would help cover up the rotten food
and dirty sock stench that usually wafts out of the 20 year old carpet...
