Subject:      Re: VDO Part # needed

VDO Part Number for this &quot;T&quot; is 240850.  I get $12.00 for 'em.

Or you can order the dual terminal sender (360006) that powers both the
light and the gauge.  My price is $36.00 for that as well.

Note:  The original idiot sender turns your light on at about 4psi.  The
VDO dual sender will turn the light on about 7 to 10psi.
