&gt; I checked the package of the snap kit last night and it is made by COGHLAN'S
&gt; (not Coleman).  Coghlan's Snap Fastener Kit (item #8811). &quot;Everything you
&gt; need to add or replace snap fasteners. Contains: 8 sets nickle plated

Coghlans is an Australian company I think. They manufacture/sell a wide
range of &quot;traditional camping&quot; supplies like:

		-the toaster racks that sit on top of gas burners
		-hurricane matches
		-camp saws
		-whistles, map cases, iodine pills

Their stuff is sold in many stores here in Canada, esp the &quot;non hi-tech
hiking/climbing&quot; stores.
