Subject: Re: 84 Vanagon: Would you fix if it yourself (if you were me?)

&gt; 1.      hesitation from stop to first
&gt; 2.	hesitation from first to second (happens less frequently than #1)
&gt; 3.	high hydro carbon emissions readings
&gt; 4.	high carbon dioxide emissions readings
&gt; 5.      very bad gas mileage.  
First, off this sounds like possible O2 sensor failure to me - has 
that been checked?
 
&gt; Dealer stated that it'll cost $320 total for the fix...  I have some
&gt; questions on the dealer's proposef fixes.
&gt; 1.      sticking throttle valve ($6.00 cleaner &amp; brush, 118.00 labor) 
&gt;         Q: Can just anyone find this throttle valve and clean it?  How
&gt; hard is it to locate and remedy?
I removed and cleaned entire throttle assembly and airflow meter in 
about an hour on my '88 - yours is slightly different, but not a 
tough job. I would wait for the Bentley so you know what's what 
before starting the job.

&gt; 2.      seeping (seaping?) fuel line #3 ($22.00 parts, 78.00 labor)
&gt;         Q: Not yet leaking, but at this point seeping.  Any dangers in
&gt; replacing this thing?  
Can't recall the differences between Dijijet &amp; Digifant fuel lines, 
but I've replaced one on mine - no big deal as long as you get the 
correct metric *high pressure* hose. 8mm I think.
 
&gt; 3.      $79.00 Diagnosis fee
If he's already diagnosed it for the above 2 problems, then why the 
fee? If he's not sure about the first one, then why soak you  $124 
for it? The second one is an obvious need for safety reasons, but 
unlikely causing your problem, unless it's pouring gas while 
running!

&gt; Main questions:  If you were me (a person who's not really too
&gt; knowledgeable yet... book's on the way from KevinS though... would you
&gt; tackle this project yourself and be able to do it in 1 to 2 hours? with
&gt; minimal danger?  Kind of worried about the fuel line since fire and fuel
&gt; equals possible boom :-)  
Continuing to drive it this way is likely more risky than fixing it 
asap with proper care - ie: remove battery ground, don't smoke, 
etc...
 
&gt; More stats on &quot;me&quot;:
&gt; 1.      Can do oil changes on the 84 vanagon... woohoo
&gt; 2.      replaced the coolant reservoir myself!
&gt; 3.      replaced alternator myself! 
&gt; These are the extent of my minimal expertise.  Can I perform the first
&gt; (throttle valve) and second (fuel line) myself?
Yes! Just make sure you get the correct hose size before attempting 
the fuel line. You may also find the fuel hose is fine, but the clamp is 
corroded away, as was the case on mine. 

Good luck!
