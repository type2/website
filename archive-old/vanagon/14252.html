&gt;
&gt;Questions.  What do you think happend to me this morning.  (Besides 
&gt;from being upset, and late for class...)
&gt;
&gt;Does this sound like the fuel pump gone, and the generator being a 
&gt;totally different problem?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks for any advice, options!  I'm going to leave here in a few 
&gt;hours to see what I can do.  
&gt;

&gt;
&gt;P.S.  Mike is &gt;&gt;NOT&lt;&lt; a real mechanic!

I don't want to trivialize your pain, but can you tell if your fan is 
blowing air over the engine?  It sounds like the engine is overheating.  I 
suppose that you should be able to feel the hot air blowing out the bottom.  
Since it has been a while since I had a Type 1, somebody else might offer 
advice here, but isn't the fan bolted on to the generator shaft and couldn't 
that come off or loose?
