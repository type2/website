Subject: Re: Safaris?

Regarding your question on Safari windows.

I believe Safari windows are the windshields you can buy for split window buses 
which are able to be propped open (they're hinged).  The slatted side windows 
are usually referred to as vented windows.  I have no idea what they call those 
23 window oval windows.  Anyone know?

Why did the accountant cross the road?

Because he did it last year.
