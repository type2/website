Subject: '63 Camper 4sale in CA


Found the following by the side of the road and talked to the owner
for a little bit:

1963 PanelVan converted to a camper by Aloha Camper Company in Oregon.

$2500

VIN    : 1024193
Engine : AD219590

40K on rebuilt 1600cc (looks very clean)
45K on rebuilt tranny
Halogen headlights
tach, oil press, temp gauges (overhead ones that look sharp)
Koni shocks and new brakes
Ash veneer (sp?) paneling on the inside (getting old)
stereo (an old cheapy)
dash still has knockout plate intact, original speedo
roof rack
louvered windows on the sides, with gutters
fiberglass insulation
split bench front seat
linoleum floor

The owner is a minor mechanic who lives in the van, and basically
follows the Dead for a living, making t-shirts. Has done the east
coast tour and driven it across the US, but mostly lives on the west
coast, winters in the desert area.

The van appears in great shape, he is selling only because he needs a
bigger house, looking at a diesel powered newer model with the whole
stove, fridge, and pop top. There is a little bit of bondo on one of
the side doors, a couple dings on the front end, and very very minimal
rust - the previous owner garaged it the majority of the time. The
exterior is a faded light green with a white top (only the very
top). The bumpers are complete, including the plates that screw on the
bumper. There is a pan covering the bottom of the front, for the
steering apperatus and whatnot linkages (nice terms, eh?:). Basically
a complete van.

His name is Peter Duguay, and you can leave a message for him at
408-997-1799. Not by emailing me please.

He doesn't want someone who will lower it, like everyone he has talked
to in CA wants to do.
