Subject: Re: Mr.Canoe Head

I have carried a canoe atop both my 1988 Westy and
my 1995 Eurovan Winnebago.  For both, I used the foam blocks
and &quot;motorcycle tiedown straps&quot;.  I encourage using a belly
strap as well as two straps at each of bow and stern.

This rig even survived Red Squirrel road, for those who
know Temagami.

that

tie
&gt; it down well
