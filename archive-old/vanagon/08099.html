Well per Joel's suggestion, I've started the search for the elusive
second oil pressure sensor on my 87 van.   Manual says the .9 Bar (~15
psi) sensor is mounted on the oil pump somewhere, and to access it by
&quot;pushing back the exhaust shield (screw on the bottom of the oil pump
body???)&quot;, but I'll be darned if I can find any obvious shield to push
back.   Maybe you need to drop the engine...

Anyone actually found this sensor on an 87?   Can you see it or the
wires without pushing back the shield I can't find?

Also, the manual seems to imply that the .9 Bar pressure sensor goes ON
at about 15 psi. so not clear why overpressure would be sensed
differently than normal pressure (Joel's theory).
