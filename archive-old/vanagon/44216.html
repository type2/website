Subject: Diesel to Wasserboxer

People keep writing to me to say that I'm crazy for trying to mate a
wasserboxer engine to a diesel tranny.  I clearly communicated my plans
badly in that regard.
The plan (in progress) is to remove the engine AND the transmission from
the Diesel Westfalia and replace it with the engine AND transmission
from the '84 1.9L Vanagon with the gas engine.

I've disconnected everything and am ready to drop the engine as soon as I
can measure whether I can get it out while the van is still in my carport
or if I have to take it out of the carport.
