It's not correct to refer to the vanagon mailing list as a newsgroup.
It's only a mailing list (or listserv list).

&gt; To turn digest mode on, send E-Mail to listserv_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu 
&gt; with no subject and one line saying
&gt; SET VANAGON MAIL DIGEST

For those people who can't put nothing in the subject, they can use the 
subject &quot;none&quot;.

FYI The list will be two years old at the beginning of April!
We now have over 600 people signed up to the list.
