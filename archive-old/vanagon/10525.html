&gt;You mentioned you've
&gt;already replaced the fuel pump so you've got some money in the FI system so
&gt;that would be a point in favor of keeping it.  

Sunk costs are irrelevant. &lt;Sorry, Pat, the econ-geek in me just HAD to say
that :) &gt;

HOWEVER: FI is definitely a superior feeding mechanism. More power, better
response, cooler engine, better mileage, less pollution. Generally fewer
problems. Parts are cheap IF you shop at the junk yard.

I can only think of 3 problems:
1) no parts available in Mexico (is this *still* true?)
2) high fuel pressure, so check your hoses frequently to avoid risk of fire
3) shouldn't be jump started (although I've done it a few times without
ill effects)
