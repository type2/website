Yeah, but how do you get started with a busted clucth cable? That's the
skill-testing question. Once you are moving its relatively easy to find
the &quot;bliss&quot; points where the transmission meshes nicely. But, to get your
vehicle moving from a dead stop you need to jam it in first and start it
engaged or alternatively push start it yourself (not recommended for vans) and
jump in and move to second from neutral. I drove from London, Ontario to
Hamilton with a busted cable- it was difficult timing the lights so that
KG would always be rolling.....A third choice would be to always park on a hill so you can roll start the
van and never worry about first gear (not recommended for Vans with FI).
