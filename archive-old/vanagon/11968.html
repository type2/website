Subject: Re: Clocks

hey i managed to find a clock for my bay window- for free. i didn't know
they were that difficult to find. Are you sure that the type III clock is
different? i didn't do any mods on the dash tp fit mine in.

&gt;A while ago there was a thread on the clock that fits in the right hand hole
&gt;of a Bay window dash. By all accounts these are not easy to get and I only
&gt;ever saw one for sale at a swap meet with an extortionate price tag. But I
&gt;saw plenty of cheap Type 3 clocks that look very similar (at least the dial
&gt;looks similar) and thought I might be able to persuade one to fit the bus's
&gt;dash. And it does, with a bit of modification, and unless you compared it to
&gt;the real thing you'd swear it was stock. The clock only cost me 3 quid and
&gt;matches the speedo and fuel guage perfectly. If anyone wants details of the
&gt;butchery (to the clock, not the dash) needed to get it to fit, e-mail me
&gt;directly. Its not a difficult job, just hard to describe.
