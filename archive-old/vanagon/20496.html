Subject: 6&quot; hubcaps &amp; bentley book

          went to flea market near atlanta on saturday and grabbed two
          chrome vw hubcaps for $1.  they are only 6&quot; diameter but set
          up in same manner as larger ones.  anyone know these?  also
          got the early bus manual from bentley.  gobs of stuff.  it
          should help when the new motor arrives!  anyone know where
          one could get the labcoats so's i'll be properly dressed out
          for the reassembly??  you gotta wonder who they were trying
          to impress.  their moms,perhaps?   ray (waiting for parts)
