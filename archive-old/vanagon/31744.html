Subject: 1600cc in a 73 bus??
Date: Tue, 2 Jan 1996 09:42:04 -0800 (PST)

hi all,
	I was wondering, how hard would it be to put a 1600cc engine
into a 73 bus?  Would you have to do anything special to the mounts,
or how it connects to the tranny?  It seems the 1600cc are easier and
more importantly cheaper to work on than the 1700 in my bus now.  I
want to pull apart and rebuild an engine, and figured if it was minor
i would look for a 1600 engine to tear apart and rebuild.  Given time
and patience (I've got a lot of both) I am beggining to believe I
could do a pretty ok job of it.  Anyway, just thought I'd throw that
out to ya'all.

Merry New Year Everyone!!!
