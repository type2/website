&gt; Does anyone have any information about buying a camper in europe, using 
&gt; it there for the summer, and selling it at the end of the summer?

All I know is that it can be done.  Our family did it in 1970, and I
know others that have done it as well.  It's a pretty good way to go,
but I'm not sure if it's really that economical...
