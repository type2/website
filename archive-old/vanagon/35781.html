Subject: Roof capacity

I'm ashamed to admit it, but I've carried (at different times):

- 2 canoes
- six kayaks
- 5 windsurfers and a bicycle
and I usually clamored up there to mount them too.

The worst part of this story is my homemade rack attaches to my pop-top...

No signs of severe fiberglass damage (yet).
