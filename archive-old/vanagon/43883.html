Subject: Re: Cone air filter for V'gons/f


&gt;Even running tuned length, turbulent free straight unfiltered induction
probably would &gt;net well under half this 8 hp increase.

Yeah, but that set-up doesn't have the magical &quot;cone&quot; properties that are so
important to horespower production.  I bet if we had a pyramid shaped air
filter se could get 16 more HP!    :)


You guys are coming dangerously close to discovering the real secret
of the V6anagon. The blurb about more cubic inches producing more power
is just a smokescreen. It's actually the &quot;V&quot; shape of the V6 engine,
closely approximating the mysterious pyramid shape, that makes it faster
than a speeding bullet etc.

I'm sorry you found this out-- now I'll have to kill you to keep the
secret safe.   =:-O                                               ,
