Subject: Re: Syncro Ball Joint/Squeaks

&gt;I had a ball joint replaced on my syncro. It made a klunking sound.
&gt;
&gt;It cost about $2,000 to replace plus another $2,000 of diagnostic time.
&gt;Plus, of course, about $50 in parts plus other parts they replaced but
&gt;didn't have to.        ^^^^^^^^^^^^
                        I like this price!


AAAAIIEEEEE, NOoooo! What was involved Derek, beyond the joint itself?



Just disconnected the upper A arm, and it is the lower joint going/gone. 
Some vertical slop. I was going to pull the arm off and lube the bushings 
BUT.. it moves freely and silently! Must be the lower arm bushing? Couldn't 
move it, due to the spring. Unlike the regular vanagons, no 
grinding/rewelding is required to remove the upper bushings, making it a DIY 
job. Keep you posted when I track down this devious SOB squeak.      tim s.
