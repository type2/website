Subject: Re: What is that thing under the seat?

That's your brain, man! Oops, I mean your Vanagon's brain :). Be good to
it, it's veeerrry expensive.

&gt;OK, OK, I've read all the manuals that came with my Westy, I looked at a
&gt;friend's Bentley but ran out of time before we had to leave.  So I'm doing the
&gt;cheap thing and resorting to the list to ask a simple dumb question I ought to
&gt;be able to figure out myself but haven't...
&gt;
&gt;Under the rear bench passenger seat, on the right side (looking toward the
&gt;back)
&gt;is a small black box mounted to the side of the cabinet.  It has some vent
&gt;holes
&gt;and is clearly associated with electricity.  In fact is appears to have
&gt;connections to the 110V outside plug and to the battery 12V system.
&gt;
&gt;A guess would be that this thing trickle charges the battery (maybe batteries)
&gt;when your connected to outside power.  Could someone give me the quick and
&gt;dirty
&gt;explanation?  Maybe even tell me what this thing is called so I can find it in
&gt;Bentley?
&gt;
&gt;I'm grateful already.
