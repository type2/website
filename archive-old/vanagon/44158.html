Hey there,
	Maybe I didn't make myself clear.  The problem is, when the
motor is OFF I do not have to press the clutch pedal to switch gears.
When the motor is off, I can easily move the transmition into whatever
gear I want without pressing the clutch pedal.  Whith the motor
running, you need to press the clutch pedal down to switch gears.

So yeah, I am going to replace the clutch cable and see if that fixes
the problem.  I'll report back with whatever I find, hopefully with a
&quot;It's Fixed!&quot;

take care,
	brandy

&gt;Uh, isn't that the norm, to press the clutch pedal when you change gears with
&gt;the motor running?  I mean, that IS what the clutch pedal is for, right?  :-)
&gt;
&gt;&gt;I losened the clutch
&gt;&gt;cable, till I had the most amount of &quot;allowable&quot; freeplay, but still
&gt;&gt;no dice.  I figure I'll go ahead and try putting the new clutch cable
&gt;&gt;in and use the other for a spare, but has anyone had this problem
&gt;&gt;before?  I'll swap out the clutch cables and play with adjusting it,
&gt;&gt;and let everyone know what's up.
&gt;I think if it were me, I'd put in the new cable, adjust free play to spec.
&gt;(about an inch?) and if it drove and shifted fine (WITH clutch :-) ) that
&gt;would be that.
