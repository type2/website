Subject:      91 Carat FS and Serendipitous Availability of 81 Westy

Note:  I realize this is a bit lengthy, so go right to the end if you want
the list question.

It sometimes seems to me that vehicles are a lot like relationships;
opportunities arise when they are least expected.  While in the midst of
first-aid to my 86 Syncro (which had been overheated by my sometimes
overzealous teenaged son), I walked over to inspect a 97 EV Winnebago which
was parked at an adjacent gas pump.  As most VW owners seem to be of a
gregarious nature, the EV driver and I got into a little chat about the
relative merits of old and new camping vehicles.  He mentioned that he
happened to have an 81 Westy that was surplus, and I expressed some
interest in it.  Upon exchanging phone #s and address, it became known that
we lived only 2 blocks apart (and both of us had been in our respective
homes for many years).  He had noticed my VW/Volvo fleet, as we are on the
corner, and I had admired his new EV.

He suggested that I look over his 81 Westy at my leisure, and that it was
parked by the alley, next to the garage, as he hadn't been using it for a
few years.  Since heatstroke resusitation of my 86 Syncro had now been
accomplished, teen son and I did just that later that afternoon.  Fellow
listees, try to imagine our surprise to discover that &quot;next to the garage&quot;
in reality described an overgrowth of bushes so thick that the Westy was
actually hidden inside, virtually undetectable by anyone from a distance
beyond a few feet.  (This is in a city neighborhood of single family homes
on 40 foot lot widths.)

He is the original owner.  55M.  Body is fine, no apparent rust.  All
mechanicals (including camping equipment) are supposedly in good working
order.  Engine was overhauled by a reputable shop at 50M.
It has been parked for almost 3 years.  Test drive will commence once
battery is charged and oil, etc. are checked.  (I know, crank it with the
coil wire off prior to actually starting it.)

THE QUESTION IS: WHAT IS IT WORTH?  Any thoughts on the FMV or other
helpful insights would be appreciated.  In return, I promise to divulge its
location to the list if I decide to pass on it.

MORE FROM THE &quot;WHEN IT RAINS, IT POURS DEPARTMENT&quot;...

Another neighbor (a few blocks the other way, on the route of our
neighborhood strolls) has a gorgeous 91 Vanagon Carat almost ready for
sale.  Equipment details include: 4 speed, ac, ps, pw, pm, classy
original-equipment mag-type wheels.  It has 80M, is bright red, very clean,
and is the weekender version with queen sized rear seat/bed, 2 jump seats,
and folding table.  He is selling as a job change gives him a company car.
I volunteered to check the list for price ideas and to offer it here first.
 (Now please be fair on your price estimates, as he is a decent fellow, and
took good care of someone's soon-to-be-new van.)
Replies should come to me and I will forward them to him, as he is not yet
on the net.
