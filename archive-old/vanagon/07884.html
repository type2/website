Saw the greatest VW bus I've ever seen yesterday.  Don't know
too much about the older vans (earlier than mid '75's) so let
describe it and I'm sure someone on this list knows.
It was a split front window, no side windows, had some sort of
'visor' over the front window.  Also, it was painted battleship
grey and had AZ historical plates (# 78B9).  I know it's up to
the individual to say their car is historical and get those plates
but this bus deserved them!  I assume everyhring I saw was
original?  It was a clean bus.
