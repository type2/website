Subject:      Re: Looking for alloy wheels?

What are these wheels worth? Well, the dealer wants around $400 each,
soooo....If you ask, say $250 each that would be a fair price, but you
probably won't sell them too fast. On the other hand, if you asked 50
bucks like someone did, they would sell faster than you could post your
offer to the list!!!
