Hal (et al),

For $15 I made screens for my MV. I went to Home Depot (or Home De Pot) and 
bought two lenghts of screen frame, one roll of screen material, 2 end kits 
and a roll of rubber ribbon, and a package of A/C foam sealing kit.

I measured the opening for the sliding windows, made a frame to fit and then 
popped in the screen material, and held the screen material in with the 
ribbon. Believe it or not, the side windows have a slight curve to them, so 
I use the 1&quot; square A/C foam to make a seal between the window and the 
screen. It took about 1.5 hours to do it.
