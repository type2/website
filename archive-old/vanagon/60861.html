Subject: coast crawl

Fellow Vanagoneers:  Wife and I are planning a summer trek up the
Oregon coast, then Washington coast to Victoria, then to Prince Rupert
and down to Jasper and Banff, later in the summer.  Our '82 Vanagon will
be outfitted with a bootlegged Weekender rig in back along with camping
stuff, bicycles etc. so we will be self-contained for the voyage.  If
you have gone this route or any part of it, would appreciate any tips on
camping (or overnight parking) spots, VW fixers to look for or avoid,
general travel tips or whatever comes to mind. Cheers, Art &amp; Kerry
McGinn
