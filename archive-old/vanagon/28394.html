Subject: Re: New Windshield..no extra

&gt;Martin,
&gt;
&gt;I hope to switch my cracked windshield out from my parts bus, both '71. 
&gt;Did you check on doing this yourself and get scared off?  How much did 
&gt;they charge for the labor?  Any pointers on this if I decide to do it myself?
&gt;
&gt;TIA, 
&gt;
&gt;The cost for a clear windshield was $20 for the new seal at West Coast Metric
 which has a lifetime warr. and $115 for the glass with a lifetime warr.
 against leaking.  If you want to do it yourself here are some tips.

Lube &amp; clean everything well. Slip seal onto glass. Insert 1/4 cord into
groove all the way around. Place glass in position with one guy outside 
pushing while one guy inside s l o w l y pulls the cord thus pulling the
inner lip up and over the metal.

Good luck. Martin
