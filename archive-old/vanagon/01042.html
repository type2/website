Subject: (MD/PA/VA) FREE camper closet


Hey,
	The cool parts guy at Anderson VW in Baltimore sold (gave, 
practically) me a rear bench seat/bed and a closet (kind of goes over the
engine hump halfway). The seat/bed works GREAT (I love it!), but the 
closet doesnt fit my year. If anybody wants to pick it up, its yours. Not 
in the best shape, but very servicable.

                                      `MNot'-
