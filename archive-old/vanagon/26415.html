Subject: Possible video project

I surely would like to see the experienced list members prepare
a series of videos detailing their most common mechanical 
procedures.  I'm confident they would sell and circulate. I would certainly
buy a couple.  The Muir Idiot's Guide is good, but no photos!  The 
Bentley guides show stuff in pristine, lab type conditions.
