Driving on I95 in the Carolinas the road hazard was a 7- or 8-foot
piece of metal in a halfmoon shape.  A truck drove over it
right in front of us, sending it way up in the air; it bounced
on the road and fell flat and we drove right over it.  If
it had come down through the windshield the impalement possibilities
don't warrant thinking about.

Oh, and there was the rolling hubcap from nowhere, but that's another
story.
