&gt; &gt; Food for thought (fuel for VW's):  does anyone have an opinion
&gt; &gt; (silly question!) as to whether super or regular gasoline makes
&gt; &gt; a VW run hotter?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
	I don't know about hotter, but I know better.

	92 Octane-Yes. The kids in Wolfsburg spec. 91 Octane in the manual for
	my '91.

	I use Chevron Super. Ruby runs better and cleaner.
	
&gt; run the super in your rig.
&gt; 
	10-4

&gt; the higher octane will allow your engine to run more eficiantly, and 
&gt; therefore cooler.
&gt; 
&gt; and for further information that may or may not concern you, try
&gt; compareing the miles (or kilometers) per monitary unit (this IS an
&gt; international mailing list) instead of distance per gallon (or liter) and
&gt; you may find that it is cheaper to run the more expensive gas because of
&gt; how much farther you travel on a given amount of fuel. 

	Maybe, but even if it did cost more, as long as I'm not in hand-to-
	mouth mode, I prefer to burn the best fuel.

	I never had heat problems with my '71.
&gt; 
&gt; i tried it for about 6 months. 10 tanks of regular, and then 10 tanks of 
&gt; premium. i was getting about 10 mpg with regular and 13 mpg with 
&gt; premium. that's average for each 10 tanks of fuel.

	Gawd! 10 &amp; 13 MPG? What are you driving? An Econoline 3/4 ton? :-)

&gt; 
&gt; because of the difference in price, the diference in cost was about %5, 
&gt; or less. but the BIG differance was in starting and pedel-to-the-metal 
&gt; power. 
&gt; 
	Definitely. I remember cruising up I-205 east of PDX on the way home
	one night and realizing Ruby was lacking power. I freaked imagining
	a big-bux part replacement for some premature failure....and then 
	remembered to my relief that the last time I fueled, the depot was outa
	hot stuff and I opted for 87 grade.

	Not only is there a difference with my '91, I experienced a similar 
	differential with my past '71.
