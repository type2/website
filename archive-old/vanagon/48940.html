Subject: more on battery

I noticed many of you speak of a second battery under the drivers seat., 
 In my 88 westy, there is no second battery... just a space for one and 
some kind of electrical circuit/junction box.   There is no mention made 
of a second battery in the owners manual.  Should there be one?  Shoud I 
install a second??
