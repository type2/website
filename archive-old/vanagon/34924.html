Subject: VISA SURCHARGE (was: Parts suppliers ID'd in this list: CAUTION

NOTE:  VISA will not permit surcharges for using the card.  There are 
a lot of low-margin computer stores in town here who used to charge a 
3% premium if you used VISA.  If you show VISA the bill (try to 
get them to include the surcharge on a seperate line) VISA will 
refund you the surcharge and hold it back from the retailer.

P.S. - The local computer stores now offer a 2% cash 'discount' to 
circumvent the issue.  But for your deal it may be just the 'gotcha' 
you're looking for.  :)

&gt;     A dismantler/supplier in Vermont who has popped up in a &quot;classified&quot; in
&gt; this list recently sold me a pair of headlights for my '87 Vanagon.
&gt; Initially, the price discussed was $75/side, but when shipping time rolled
&gt; around the price &quot;remembered&quot; was $100/side. Since I had taken extensive
&gt; notes, and mentioned date and time, the negotiation reduced it to $85/side.
&gt; The reason given for the increase over the agreed original price was that
&gt; Visa charges six percent for each transaction.
&gt;     Since Visa makes use of a long-distance supplier attractive to begin
&gt; with, I personally feel that this is a legitimate &quot;cost of business&quot;
&gt; expense and not something that should automatically be passed on to a
&gt; customer. To charge a PROFIT on said cost comes mighty close to dishonesty.
&gt; 6 percent of the original cost is only $4.50 - charging ten extra dollars
&gt; per SIDE on top of shipping and handling is insulting!
&gt;     I don't know how they do things in Vermont, but when I give my word
&gt; here in Pennsylvania, I stand by it. I understand these folks are in
&gt; business to make money, and they sure made it off me THIS time. Repeat
&gt; business for the good folks in Westminster is out of the question, and
&gt; they've given mail-order dismantlers everywhere a bad name by playing this
&gt; little game with me. I suggest you avoid them too - they seem to feel they
&gt; have Van owners over some kind of barrel, but they're wrong. At least I
&gt; would hope so! Or maybe I'm just naive?
