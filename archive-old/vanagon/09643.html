Using a regular household hair dryer, I heated and softened the adhesive
behind the contact-type plastic paper which previously lined by
interior panels.  Some of it was so delaminated it didn't require
the extra use of the heat, other was stubborn even with it.  If it
was totally stuck on there, I cut around it and left it, feeling that
if it had stayed that adhered after 14 years, it probably would be there
for all time.  BTW, I had to use a snap-knife to go around the edges,
so that they would tear/pull-off cleanly.

Then, I went to a regular fabric store and bought some upholstery
grade velour on sale for about $3 per yard (you'll be lucky if
you find this price).  Using Joel's favorite 3M brand Scotch
spray adhesive called I think &quot;77,&quot; I attached the velour.  Sometimes
I sprayed the fabric, other times the panel.  It was hard in either
case to avoid overspray, but I found I could get it off both the fabric
and hard surfaces with spot remover (cleaning fluid, energine brand).
This stuff is REALLY sticky!  You have a couple of minutes to move it
around, but it's basically dry, unlike say, wallpaper paste.  You need
to make sure to coat everywhere, and it adheres far better if you can
coat both the fabric and the panels.  After 5 minutes or so, or even
the next day, I went around the edges and trimmed off the excess
using again a snap knife (sort of a disposable verion of an exacto
knife, or a razor blade might work, but better if you have
something to hold it with).  I did both the vertical panels this
was, as well as the headliner area.  They fabrics are a little 
different, and even different from the upholstery which I had done,
but they are all of the same family, and sort of coordinate.  I chose
a slightly darker version for the sides, thinking it would show
the dirt less.  End result I think actually achieves some modicum
of insulation properties, or perhaps it is my imagination, that the
velvety surface &quot;feels&quot; warmer.

Hint:  I recommend using either a solid color, or a pattern that
does not require squaring or matching, as this gets to be
a nightmare, and uses a lot of material.  Also, it's a lot easier
to get the adhesive off while it's pretty fresh, rather than later,
but either way, it will still come off.  I think 3M probably makes
an adhesive remover, but I didn't happen to have any on the evening
I started the project, so just kept with the cleaning fluid.  Keep
your fingers clean, or the 77 gets easily on the face of the fabric.

Next, I want to do black velvet with silver sparkles in the pop top
ceiling, then glue glow-in-the-dark stars over it in proper constellation
formations.  

Note to Ric:  Yeah, I did install those flannel handcuffs, but it was
a real bummer trying to cut thru the mirrored ceilings to do it!  ;)
