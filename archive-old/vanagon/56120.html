Subject: Westy Questions
Date: Mon, 17 Feb 1997 19:24:09 -0800

I am the proud new owner of a '91 Westy which my wife and I and my 2 1/2
year old daughter will be using for an extended (~1 year) trip to Mexico,
Belize and Costa Rica.  I have several questions that I'd like to run by
you folks.  Please forgive me if they're stupid - I'm a new owner:

1.  The fridge seems to work fine on battery power, but I can't seem to get
it lit to run on propane.  I follow the directions, and the blinking red
light does indeed go out, but I never see the blue flame in the sight hole
in the fridge.  Am I doing something wrong?

2.  What are the best floor mats to buy?

3.  Where's the best source for small parts - I'm missing a few minor trim
pieces (e.g., one curtain tie-back, some trim screws, etc.).

4.  What consumables would you take on a trip of this duration - I'm
planning to take a set of belts, some hoses (the ones that attach directly
to the engine), fuel, oil and air filters, and a set of spark plugs. 
Anything else that I should bring along?

5.  I will need to tow a light trailer.  What's the best source for a
trailer hitch?  Additionally, I have a really nice flat bed trailer that
tows great, but I'm having trouble finding a 4x8 waterproof box to go on
it.  Any recommendations for such a thing, or can someone recommend a good,
light trailer to buy?

If you wouldn't mind, could you please CC your response to me
(dtanzer_at_compuserve_dot_com), as I haven't subscribed to the list (three weeks
'til departure and no time to read all the wonderful items on this list).

Thanks in advance,

David Tanzer
