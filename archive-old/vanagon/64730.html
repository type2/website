Subject:      Vanagon List Down on Saturday - NOTICE

PLEASE! note the VANAGON list *may* go down on Saturday. SDSC is updating
some in-house HW/SW which shouldn't affect the network that our list
server is on. But knowing life (it's not a bowl of cherries!), one thing
could lead to another and our operations people may 'touch' our list
network. If they do, our network connection and/or server could go down.
I don't think so, but just to be on the safe side I'm sending y'all this
notice.

I'll check into the system later tomorrow to see how gerry is feeling.
