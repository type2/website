Subject: Re: Electric Heaters / isolater

    Steve, 

    What is the deal with these solid state isolaters.  A guy at a 
local auto electric shop said solenoids are fine and cost A LOT less!!  
I would like to know if there is more to it.


&gt;I recommend you install a second battery with a BIG solid-state 
isolator.
&gt;You'll eventually run it flat, even with the engine running. But with
&gt;the 2nd batt and isolator, only the heater will die out after that, 
and
&gt;at least you won't have to walk.
