Subject: Bus for sale

I know this is mostly Vanagon stuff, (I have an 85) but thought I would
let you know about a Bus for sale.

1960 Westfalia, In Hot VW magazine.
ALL ORIGINAL, except newer paint.
Full side tent with changing room, only errected twice.
Original seats
Original teakwood interior
museum quality
Safari windows
Original sales lit and VW birth certificate.

I have to move, so I must part with my baby. I paid 13850 in 1994, only
looking to break even. Email or call with questions. Please forward this
info if you know somebody that can give her a good home.
800-417-6883
