So David Schwarze says:
&gt; 
&gt; With new rings in used cylinders, the rings may not seat.  You will have
&gt; just replaced a perfectly good short block with one that has no
&gt; compression.  If you get new rings, take the cylinders in and have them
&gt; honed.  Do not even consider replacing the rings without doing this.  And
&gt; by the way, it's not easy getting the pistons/rings back into the
&gt; cylinders.  I've tried twice, and broken a ring twice.  Maybe I'm just
&gt; clumsy, or maybe it really is something that should be left to the
&gt; professionals.  I know what I think.

Hmmmm..... I didn't have any problems with replacing mine with no
cylinder honing.  This was on my '74 camper.  I just rebuilt the
top end and had the heads rebuilt/replaced.  And yes, you are clumsy
David.  And your mother dresses you funny too....  ;)
