'60 Something VW'ers

Many years ago I owned a beautiful '67 21 window Deluxe Transporter with
sunroof. I bought it with 10k miles for $1750 and drove it until '74 when
our daughter rolled it in a high wind in South Dakota. Fortunately, she was
wearing her seat belt and got out with only sore hips and a thankful
father.

The accident converted a beauty into a rather ugly, misshapen and
undrivable vehicle. My son and I converted the remains, floor pan down,
into an ungainly van in the process learning a great deal about building a
car. The experience provided a wonderful set of lines when he applied for a
job as an engineer with Ford where he has been successfully working on
vehicle cooling and handling dynamics for many years.

Anyway, he finally totaled out the rebuilt van. The only surviving part is
the shop manual for the original car. Since I have enough projects to last
a lifetime, I have decided to part with the manual.

This manual is titled &quot;Owner's Service Manual&quot; (Volkswagen Station Wagons
and Trucks). The cover is blue with a picture of the engine compartment.
The inside cover indicates &quot;Volkswagenwerk Aktiengesellschaft&quot; copyright
1964 printed in Germany. This is not a Bentley book.

This book covers vans with the 1500 (1493cc) engine.

All the pages are in the book. The binding is broken and several of the
pages are loose. A couple of the pages are torn in the corner but no
information is missing. There are a few grease marks on the pages where we
have made good use of the book.

I would like to give the book away but I have no idea of how to do it
fairly. Therefore, if there is a demand for the book, I will &quot;sell&quot; it to
the highest bidder. The price paid will be used to encourage continuation
of this group. Joel has some ideas on how we can use the money wisely.

Please contact me directly with a bid. I will hold the bidding open until
the end of October so anyone on vacation or travelling will have a decent
chance.
