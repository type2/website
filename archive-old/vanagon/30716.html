Subject: Re: water leak underneath dash when it rains

Look at the windshield around the lower left corner (drivers side
bottom corner).  There will probably be a big gaping area where the
rubber has shrinked (shrunk?)  back.  I have an 84 that had the same
problem.  Just take a tube of marine silicone, or whatever type you
prefer, jam the tip under the rubber window seal and crank it full
of silicone.  You will be able to go about 6-8 inches up the side
and almost the same along the bottom too.  Make sure you fill it so
that it comes oozing out along the seal.  Then just wipe it up.  It
has completely eliminated my leak problems.

Good luck

brian.




&gt; My 84 van leaks.  I see water dripping off my fuse box underneath the left
&gt; side on drivers side.  I don't see water coming out anywhere else.  It's
&gt; starting to make my electrical system do wierd things.  Where do I start to
&gt; look for this leak?  Who else has had this problem? and what did you do.  
&gt; Thankyou
&gt; Fred
&gt; It looks like I'm fixing my Van-a-gon.
