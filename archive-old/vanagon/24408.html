Who cares about high water at O'Leno?  Just stay away from the siphon 
:).

I'm prolly coming down from Tallahassee for the day; anyone driving 
from that general direction interested in a caravan?  As long as you 
don't mind driving alongside my Prelude (maybe I'll duct tape the 
Franklin Mint splittie to the hood just for the trip).  Will try to 
remember to bring all my unpublished westy tent pix --maybe even the 
actual foyer tent just to ensure that I am properly revered.  Will 
trade opportunities to feel the canvas for canoe rides.
