Subject: help - news group or e-mail

        Reply to:   help - news group or e-mail????
Hi, As a Newbie I'm temporarily confused, (and waaay to overloaded with
concerns about my '89 Syncro front end rebuild I'm working on and other real
work stuff  too) to truly understand what I've gotten into here.  I like it, 
though.  It has proved usefull in the last couple of days.

But, 

1.  could someone tell me if this is strictly e-mail, or a news group that I
can follow with MT Newswatcher.  

2.  If it is e-mail, is there some trick to following a thread.

3.  What's the proper etiqueite to responding to a message, do I post to the
list or the sender or both or???

Can someone help, I couldn't find anything in the FAQ I found beyond a note
about rec.auto.vw.  Sorry for the questions.

thanks.  sending donation soon.  right after the wheel bearings come and I get
them pressed in.  (I bet that'll be a chore.)

Ch
'89 Syncro
