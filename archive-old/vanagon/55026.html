Subject: Re: Battery light staying on till I hit the gas?

Perry,
I've traced the circuit diagram for the battery light and it appears
that the voltage generated by your alternator/voltage regulator is
compared with the voltage stabilizer in the instrument panel. If the
alternator output is too low then the battery light comes on. So I
suggest that your problem is more likely with the alternator and/or
voltage regulator than with your battery. Your experience with dimmed
lights until you rev the engine suggests that the voltage regulator is
at fault and not the alternator itself.

&gt; I think I have a problem with my battery? I did a lot of camping this
&gt; summer with out newly built vanagon panel camper. I installed on eof those
&gt; electric cooler thing in my van. We put about 60,000 Km on our van and ran
&gt; the fridge alot this summer, even when the van was off. Now the battery
&gt; light stay's on when I start the van until I I bring the rpm to about 2000.
&gt; The heater and headlights also run very dim until I do rav the engine a
&gt; bit. I have no problems starting the van but would like to find out why my
&gt; van is doing this.
