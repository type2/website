&gt; hitch attced to bumper mounts. I know--nuff said. The other came on the

&gt; them, the are esentially welded on, belive me, I had occasion to have a mount

Does anyone have one of these stock hitches?  I'd like to have one for my 
'68.  I don't have anything to tow but then again, you never know.
