Hi -
I had a similar experience with a '71 Fiat 128.  Had a &quot;mechanic&quot; do 
some transmission work.  He used a pair of pliers on the shift rod, 
placing a small nick in just the RIGHT spot.  Whenever I shifted into 
reverse, it 'locked' in second.  Lots of fun driving on an interstate 
at 25 mph ! ! !   I drilled a small hole in the tranny cover plate, 
installed a self tapping screw, and kept a nail in the glove box.  
Whenever it got stuck (I learned lots of tricks on how NOT to use 
reverse) I removed the screw and pushed the shift rod back into 
position.  Sold it that way, new owner even shifted into reverse on a 
test drive without it getting stuck.
Got a call a couple of days later and I nearly had a heart attack.
Not a mechanical problem, I had fogotten to sign one form.
Boy, I'll never pull a stunt like that again, not good for one's karma ! !
