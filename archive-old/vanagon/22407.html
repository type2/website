&gt; If it were not for the Grateful Dead and Jerry Garcia I would not have:
&gt; -the intrest I have in VWs and my '76 Camper
&gt; -my girlfriend
&gt; -my BEST friends 
&gt; -lots of friends I have not met yet who wave or would stop if I was on 
&gt; the side of the road because they saw a Dead sticker
&gt; -the intrest in the varied styles of music that I do
&gt; -and lots more
&gt; 
&gt; Right after work today I went to he drug store and bought shoe polish. On 
&gt; the back window of my van it now says &quot;Jerry Garcia RIP 8/1/42 - 8/9/95&quot; 
&gt; and on a side window &quot;He was a friend of mine&quot;.
&gt; Please don't make fun, there are so many out there hurting right now.

Gary, I couldn't have said it better myself. I've seen a lot of kidding 
around about his passing. Jerry was a real person. He made real music. He 
deserves some respect. I have many fond memories of going to see them 
since as far back as 1969. They brought me joy. Jerry will certainly be 
missed!
