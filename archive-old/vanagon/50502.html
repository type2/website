RE:	Copy of: Re: Front door speakers - Westy vs. Pass van?

Maybe you have an optional upgraded sound system, better than the crappy
Blaujunkt bottom line standard van speakers. How do they sound? Have you
compared them to a van that has the standard speakers? I would imagine that any
speaker upgrades offered in Canada would be offered in the US also.
Anybody else out there have these kind of speakers too?
