Subject: %$#_at_#$ type 4 motors

As I continue on my odyssey of discovery on the peoples camper I find 
 things on this pancake motor that seem, well, difficult. The most 
 current displeasure is replacing the points, what sort of a magnetic 
 contortionist to you have to be to get every thing setup right? Is 
 there a secret 0 clearance right angle screwdriver I need? Do you pull 
 the distributor to get to all the screws on the perimeter off the 
 housing ie: the screw that holds the wire grommet in place is 
 impossible to get to. And last - does a electronic point replacement 
 system, like the Pertronix (?) unit work in this distributor?

Clay &quot;give me back my upright &quot; Perry
