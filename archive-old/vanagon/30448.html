Subject: 1929 BUSatti Advice?

Browsing through the Chicago Trading Times for old buses, I
came upon the following ad under Kit Cars:

29 Bugatti, VW powered,
needs work, must sell, $700,
(312)890-0541, CHICAGO.

I looked at kit cars years (decades?) ago and prices were
too high for me.  Just married, buying a house, etc.  Now
that my beard is graying, the 67 Deluxe restoration is done,
$700 seems like a deal.  I know, if it seems too good to be
true, it probably is.

Any kit folk out there who can shed light on this subject?
