Subject: '60 Double Door / '58 Type II FS

I ran across this at an auction web page.  The site is:

http://www.ebay_dot_com:80/aw/

Look under &quot;autos&quot; to view the listing.  

Onet is described as a '60 Double Door VW Bus and listed at bid for 
$600.  The other is listed as a '58 Type II Deluxe and the listed bid 
is $1500.  

I know that these are pretty rare and thought that I would mention it 
for the benefit of the &quot;old&quot; bus fans here.
