Subject: Idle Stab.-- quick fix

This post on idle stabilization reminded me of something -- my '87 now
seems to idle quite well once it is warm, yet, it takes a long time to
warm up in Pittsburgh, PA for the system to get off the 'cold engine'
mode... Is there an easy setting for what the 'cold' rpm should be, or even
just a screw to adjust how much extra fuel is sent to the cylinders
when the engine is cold?  I do not really like the engine racing at
2200 rpm when it is this cold -- I'd feel a lot more at ease if it
idled at around 1500 or so when the engine is cold...
Thanks in advance,
Cetin

 &gt; and results in a 2000-3000 rpm idle on cold days.  its cleaning is one of
 &gt; those &quot;i'll get to it soon&quot; projects that never seem to materialize.  today
 &gt; when i ran out for lunch the idle got to me.  i felt like everyone was
 &gt; thinking i was driving a Volkwagen :)
