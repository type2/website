Wouldn't it be great to rent a raceway for the afternoon and have a few races?
You know, like the pictures you've seen of vinatge Ferraris, Porsches,
BRM, Vanwall etc toodling around Laguna Seca.
We could have different cats, or just one. 
Or how about a 24 hr Le Mans style event complete with the starting dash
to the bus?
