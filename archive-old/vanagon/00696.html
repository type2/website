Subject: Got me a T1 Type 2

&gt; Question my sanity...go ahead! I just bought a somewhat rusty (the 
&gt; roof has holes in it) 1962 Type II. Why? Because it has cargo
&gt; doors on both sides! Also because 1963 was the last full year
&gt; for Type 2s having the 40 hp engine, the small rear cargo
&gt; hatch, etc. Besides having the dual cargo doors, this one still
&gt; has the cardboard/glass divider between the cab and the 
&gt; cargo area.
&gt; 
&gt; Now all I have to do is to find some place to store it, as well
&gt; as a whole T1 Type 2 roof section. Oh, yeah, it has its original
&gt; bumpers (sitting in the van).

It's not us you have to explain it to Ric.  We understand just fine.
It's your wife you have to make the justifications to.  I'm sure
she knows it's a lost cause to try to talk you out of it though. ;)
