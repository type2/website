Subject: RE: Type Two? 2? or what?



&gt;No, actually, you end up a Type 2/T1, or maybe a Type II/T1.
&gt;Or is that a TII/T1?  If you retrofit fuel injection you
&gt;become a TII/T1/FI.  If you add enough Italian parts, you
&gt;could be a GT/TII/T1/FI.  And, if you update your engine,
&gt;you could be a 1600 GT/TII/T1/FI, or a BMW, whichever comes
&gt;first.

What's the official VW designation for a 1980 Vanagon with a
Chevy V6 engine?  :^)

I'm heading to Missouri this Friday. CLutch is in, PO is driving
it around a little to see if it falls back out. Got a used steering
rack in surprisingly good condition (Thank you, Bradley!), got to
tour Mullholland Drive and Beverly Glen where Charlie Manson did
his thang a few years back, found out what airline tix cost (!),
got the book &quot;Route 66: The Mother Road&quot; by Wallis, and am mapping
out the route even now! What a cool book.

Of course, a splittie would be the most appropriate vehicle for this
trip (or a '60 Tbird), but I'll try to manage...   :^)

Anybody want some Rte 66 memorabilia? Can't promise anything, but
will try if you ask.
