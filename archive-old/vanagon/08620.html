Subject: Single-cab progress


	On the single-cab front, I borrowed my brother's ultra-heavy-duty
3/8&quot; drill bit and drilled through one of the underbed-storage
latched this morning. Nothing in ther except the jack, two bungee
cords and a pretty good jumper cable. There's enough of the lock left
that it will still latch closed. I'll climb through and disassemble
the other side to get at the latch.

	It was dry inside, and there's a nice carpet to keep 
stuff from rattling. The hatch opens and shuts solidly.

	Former Owner and I are going to have to talk about
the significant lack of engine tin and accesories. He's probably
got some of this stuff lurking somewhere in his shop, but so
far the missing parts list reads:

	Muffler
	Fan Shroud, air vanes, under-cylinder air directors
	Generator stand
	Flywheel or Presure plate- I'm not sure which, but one of 'em.
	Rear body sheetmetal that you take out to remove the engine.

	Known-missing when I bought it are
	Fuel pump
	Thermostat

	The sticker inside the door jamb says its a 05/70 build vehicle,
and meets Federal requirements. I'm not sure California had requirements
for trucks at that point- I'm gonna call the Smog people and find out
exactly what they want to see, inasmuch as I'm pretty sure I've
*got* a 71 carb and distributor, and while a 70 carb (31-PICT-3) is
available, only 009 distributors are available new.

	Having taken consultation, I'm then going to call the people
who sell turn-key engines and see what a complete, fits in an empty
engine bay, 1970 1600 single-port will cost me, and what I have
to have besides that. I can work backwards from there- using
my generator, carb and distrutor, getting some of the tin from
my stash, bugging Former Owner or scrounging at the junk yard.
(The Bus Stop's prices for tin are breath-taking- $230 for the
upright fan shroud!)

	What tin I have is for a dog-house (71 and later) oil cooler,
and that is what I'll have built-up for me, in any event. 

	My brother advises using the Pertronic breaker-less ignition,
and I'm going to go for hydraulic valves. It'll be a '90s kind
of air-cooled engine! And I'll be on the road!

	Bill
