&gt; one of these days, i'm gonna have to take out my center heater/vent control
&gt; dash appliance-thingie (the big bunch of crap in front of the gearshift lever
&gt; ..AWK! i said it again: LEVER!) ... to cure a wind-whistle. it seems that
&gt; my little fresh air flap gasket has committed rotterdam upon itself and
&gt; un-mathematically come apart (dis-integrated). and guess what folks? you can't
&gt; get to it from the outside on an 88. :( if i'm lucky, i can put it off for
&gt; another five or six years.

Yeah, wouldn't it be nice if we could try out these experiments on a 
second vanagon rather than our daily drivers.  Ya know, kinda like the
guys at the VW dealership do. ;)
