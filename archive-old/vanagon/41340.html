&gt;I've been noticing a clunking sound as I engage the clutch after shifting. 
&gt;Feels like there is some play somewhere in the drivetrain. The sound is 
&gt;like a metal-on-metal clunk, not unlike the sound I remember from shifting 
&gt;an American car with auto tranny into the Drive position. I suspect that 
&gt;the U joints in the driveshaft are wearing out. Any other ideas? How does 
&gt;one definitively check the driveshaft U joints?

Some Syncros make this noise as the front diff gets paly in the R+P or the
viscous coupling.  Sounds almost like a bell.
