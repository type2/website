&gt; one.  Is changing the cylinders a difficult process, because if it is, I can
&gt; live with it the way it is, but it would be nice, however, to be able to open
&gt; the door using the key.

There is a small knock-out pin which holds it all together. Pre-soak the
pin area with penetrating oil. I used a nail with the end filed flat to
tap the pin through and out of the hole. The nail must be slightly less
than a snug fit. Remember to put your key into to lock cylinder before
removing cylinder.
