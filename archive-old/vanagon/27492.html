Subject: Re: Propane furnace \camping current draw


    Yes, no, yes,yes, no...
    Hmm, well one by one-

    
Does it burn outside air or inside air?  Outside

Can I duct the exhaust or does it really need to be flush with an 
outside wall 7x7xwhatever?  Ducting supplied w/ kit!!  The end of the 
furnace can be from 0 to 7 or 8&quot; from the wall ( call Camping World 
tech support for exact).  Total length, outside wall to end of heater 
21-28 or so.  Ducts must be mounted through a paralell surface, no 
major slants w/o jerryrigging.

Is the exhaust exhausted :) by force or does it need to be above or 
below the furnace?  By force, there is a combustion blower

Thermostatically controlled? Yes. Included.

Is it very noisy ?? Nah.  But mount it away from where your head is 
when sleeping, and burry it in a box w/ insulation, i have done none of 
this and I have no problems, since the first night.

   Hope this helps
