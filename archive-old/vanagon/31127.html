&gt;Nope-- that was a Sunbeam Tiger. Same size and weight as a Ghia, but
&gt;with a Ford 289 V8 engine under the hood. My dad used to say you could
&gt;remove the drive shaft from that car, and drive it around powering it
&gt;with the cooling fan...

Well, actually, for a while he drove a Ghia, and for a while he drove an 
Amphicar.  Dunno about the Sunbeam....except that after Chrysler bought 
Sunbeam, the Tiger still used Ford V8s, 'cause the Chrysler V8 wouldn't 
fit.
