&gt; I've always wanted to know--
&gt; Is it Pee-cans or puh-Kahns, (ALL-mond or aah-mond, toe-MA-toe or 
&gt; to-MAH-toe, Volks-wagen, or Volts-wagen?)

Well aktshewellie, it's  &quot;Foelks-vaaahgin&quot;.  I bet Eva Gabore could
say it really well.  If she tried.  You know, &quot;Daaaaahling&quot;...&quot;vaaaaahgin&quot;,
like that!

Speaking of Eva Gabore, they had this skit on the radio this mornin,
where they paid this guy some money to call up his mother and convince
her that he had had 3-way sex with Merv Griffin and Eva Gabore in a
casino restroom in Las Vegas.  He did a real good job, too...
Just thought you'd like to know.
