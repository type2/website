Subject: Re:  Skylight Bug Screen

First and foremost, thank you for picking up the list.  And thanks to Chris
as well.

As for the glue-of-choice: I went to a fabric store and bought a 'standard
brand' &quot;glue for Velcro&quot;.  I too wanted it for my skylight.  Before applying
it, I used a fingernail emery board to remove the old glue. If I still have
the glue and can find it, I will send a second message with the brand name.

&gt;Speaking of this... what *is* the glue-of-choice for getting the Velcro
&gt;(tm) strip to stick to the roof???
