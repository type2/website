Jeez, whatever happened to staying over night at  a campsite? Virtually
every major city has a KOA on the edge of town and with a discount card you
are guaranteed a   -- 
a cheap hot shower in the morning. Of course state parks would be the best
choice.

It seems that street camping is a way of life for 10-20% of the US
population these days....and I don't mean for people who have westfalias
but those who live permanently &quot;on the road&quot;. DC
