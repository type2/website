Subject: Re: Buying 88 Vanagon- Anything I should know 1st?

Unless you are brand new to the list and to water-cooled vanagons,
then you know that the single most important factor is that the heads
are not leaking.  Look for puddles, spray on the oil filter and around the
sides of the engine compartment in general.  

IMO, other things to look for
would be the condition of the a/c compressor, c/v joints,brakes, tranie
and clutch, and the working shape of the accessories, because if
something goes out that you like(d), expect to pay big for the replacements
parts.  (e.g., power mirrors $100 each used, $300 each new; rear wiper
motor about $80 used, $250 new; rear hatch struts about $30 each; a/c 
compressor about $280 rebuilt, $600 new, plus rec/dryer at $160; etc.).  

I made the mistake of buying my 88 GL a little too hastily because my 
wife and I wanted a vanagon and there just aren't too many available
on the market in Dallas.  I paid $5000 for the van and up to about
another $3000 in repairs and replacing missing accessories (the short
list is included above!).  That's not to say I still wouldn't have bought
it, I just would have talked the guy down another $1000 off of his asking
price.  BTW, I did identify some of the problems myself before I made
my offer, but taking it to a qualified mechanic would have id'ed some
of the more costly problems I encountered once I was the owner.
Stupid mistake I hadn't done before and now won't repeat again.

Other than that, enjoy and welcome to an addicting &quot;hobby&quot; and 
lifestyle (oh no, I'm probably asking for it here).

88 GL (108K)

PS - my idle used to hunt up and down alot, too.  Funny coincidence
is that once I hooked up the mirrors that were missing, the hunting seems
to be very limited to occasional high idling at 1500 RPMs).  Perhaps the 
the loose wires in the door were causing some spikes in the electrical
system.  Any takers here?

&quot;I am contemplating the purchase of an 88 Vanagon. It has 173K miles with
70k miles on a rebuilt engine. The vehicle seems to run well and appears to
have been well-cared for. The selling price is $2,850.00. Seems like a
great deal. Anything I should look out for or inspect closely before my
purchase? 

The idle hunts up and down a bit, but I think that is normal for the German
cars with the oxygen sensors. I had an Audi and a VW Jetta that both did
the same thing. Other than that, it seems fine.

Any suggestions or ideas would be greatly appreciated.&quot;
