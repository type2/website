Subject: &quot;back from vacation&quot;



This is my first week back at work after 3 weeks vacation, I'm trying
to maintain that holiday relaxation state-of-mind for more than a
couple of days. 
It's interesting to review the mail for the last 3 weeks, how some
subjects keep surfacing, (hey Joel, can you plot the occurances of
some particular threads, 12 V outlets in dash, tires, etc. and then
predict their next appearance?).
I am very interested in the winterization/cat heater dialogue that has
gone on. I have an Olympian cat heater (model # forgotten) that I
haven't used in earnest yet. I made up a bracket that attaches to a
short length of steel tube that fits inside the forward table stand.
This allows the heater to be &quot;shining&quot; (remember its all radiative heat),
on the back seat and yet sort of out of the way.
Once, when I was camping at at ski hill in my old '72, a late model
Vanagon Westy parked beside us.There were four occupants (2 adults and 2
kids), and the used the attached tent to store excess baggage and ski gear.
They also had an insulated blanket, silver on one side like a space blanket,
that attached to the pop-top making it a double wall tent. Its the
sort of thing you could easily make yourself, with attachment to the
pop-top being the only tricky part, (can't remember how they did it).

Their are alot of Vanagons here in Victoria with awning things on
them. Gee, I don't know, but I kinda lump them in with Tilley
hats and knobby white knees... :)

I like a tarp. Yesiree, there's nothing like a well hung tarp to
swell the chest of seasoned camper. Besides, you can use them for
other things: catching people jumping from burning buildings, making
a tepee sauna, locating your van in dense bush, groundsheet.
