&gt;     I really did not kill my wife.
&gt;     I did not slash her with a knife.
&gt;     I did not bonk her on the head.
&gt;     I did not know that she was dead.
&gt;
&gt;     I stayed at home that fateful night
&gt;     I took a cab, then took a flight.
&gt;     The bag I had was just for me.
&gt;     My bag! My bag! Hey, leave it be!
&gt;
&gt;     When I came home I had a gash.
&gt;     My hand was cut from broken glass.
&gt;     I cut my hand on broken glass.
&gt;     A broken glass did cause that gash.
&gt;
&gt;     My friend, he took me for a ride.
&gt;     All through LA, from side to side.
&gt;     From north to south, we took a ride.
&gt;     But from the cops we could not hide.
&gt;
&gt;     My trial lasted for a year.
&gt;     A year! A year! Just sitting here!
&gt;     The DNA, the HEM- the HAW!
&gt;     The circus-hype the viewers saw!
&gt;     A year! A year! Just sitting here!
&gt;
&gt;     Found guilty you know I will appeal!
&gt;     Appeal! Appeal! I will appeal!
&gt;     I'll wheedle and whine- I'll cut a deal!
&gt;     To hear &quot;not guilty&quot; so glad I'll feel!
&gt;
&gt;     Did you do this awful crime?
&gt;     Did you do this anytime?
&gt;     I did not do this awful crime.
&gt;     I could not, would not anytime.
&gt;
&gt;     Did you take this person's life?
&gt;     Did you do this with a knife?
&gt;     I did not do it with a knife.
&gt;     I did not, could not kill my wife.
&gt;
&gt;     Did you hit her from above?
&gt;     Did you drop this bloody glove?
&gt;     I did not hit her from above.
&gt;     I cannot even wear that glove.
&gt;
&gt;     I did not do it with a knife
&gt;     I did not, could not kill my wife.
&gt;     I did not do this awful crime.
&gt;     I could not, would not, anytime.
&gt;
&gt;     And now I'm free, I can return
&gt;     To my own house for which I yearn.
&gt;     And to my family whom I love.
&gt;     Hey now I'm free-- Give back my glove!!!!!
