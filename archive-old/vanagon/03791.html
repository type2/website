Subject: Hesitation

I have an annoying hesitation (sometimes referred to as a 'flat spot') when
going from idle to higher rpms...This is a routine 'rev', as when starting
out from a stop.  Only way to avoid is by employing the most gradual (and
impractical) slow transition from idle to a higher rpm.

Hoping for a &quot;oh yeah, that's gotta be your ...&quot; response.  Is this a simple
carb rebuild, or something else?

Thx/Ken
