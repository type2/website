Subject: Re: Street camping


	Gerry's hint about county fair grounds is a great one.

	My late wife and I car-camped more than a few times in her
'63 Dodge Dart station wagon and later in my 77 Rabbit. In the Rabbit,
we were always parked in front of the people we were visiting, never
had any problems in LA or San Jose. 
	Once for a wedding, we went to Fresno and picked a likely looking
spot where the railroad tracks paralleled a farm road. We woke with the
sun, to discover we had found a popular spot. At least four other cars,
(no VWs) were parked there, all with their windows steamed to opacity...
They could have been going to a wedding too, but I figure we'd found
lover's lane.

	Bill
