Subject:      Re: Temperature Sensor Source

You can get the temp. sensor type which hooks into the oil press. wire
for about $8 from J.C. Whitney. It seems to work just fine.  It won't
give you a precise temp reading, but it will tell you if you're running
hot.  May scare you a little if you drive for a while on hot days, turn
the engine off, then start it again soon after. (The engine retains the
heat while fan isn't blowing on it.)  However, if the indicator comes on
while you're driving, you know it's time to pull over and check the belt.
