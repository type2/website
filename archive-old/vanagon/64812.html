&lt;&lt; I'm new to this and know almost nothing about the world of Vanagon
 Westys except that after 1985 they are water cooled and some of 'em were
 not done in Germany.  Anyway, I would welcome buying tips as my wife and
 I prepare to join this club (do I need to be a mechanic, for
 instance?).  Also, how come I see so many 1987's for sale?  Something
 wrong with that year?

actually, they were &quot;watercooled&quot; (diesels) as early as '81, then in '83.5
they went to the watercooled flat 4, instead of aircooled. They were all
watercooled from '83.5 up...
All the Westy's were done in Germany.
you see so many '87's for sale, because there were more Vanagons sold in the
US in '87 than in '88 and so on..( US sales dropped due to the chrysler
minivans and raising prices for the westfalia).., but other than that, it's
just a coincodince..
