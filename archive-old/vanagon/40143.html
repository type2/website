Subject: oil pressure sender unit leak?


Hey all,

being a newbusee i have some questions about an oil leak on an 82 
vanagon.  I cleaned off the bottom of the engine with gunk and let it run 
for awhile.  I saw oil leaking down from above the oil filter right 
away.  so, i took off the oil filter (had a spare handy) and tried to 
trace the origins.  I couldn't see any beginning point from below, so i 
took a look from the top.  right above the oil filter area is a sensor 
(oil sender unit?) which is covered in oil.  there is also oil splashed 
up above the little tin guard.  Anyone else had this happen?  If I am 
thinking of replacing the idiot lights with real guages, should I do this 
now?  what kind?  If not, or for a quick fix, shold I just buy a new part 
and slap it  in?  any kind of sealant?

thanks for any help
chuck (of the hill people)
