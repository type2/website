Subject: My new Westy

All,

I was tearing the engine down some more today to find out where the
oil is leaking from the engine.  As I removed the engine tin I narrowed
down the leak.  When I removed the valve cover, a cup or so of oil
leaked out.  I cannot figure out what is causing that much oil to be
leaked out. Could somebody tell me what is causing this. I have a
feeling that this is the only leak.  The oil was clean, meaning that
the oil was getting there as fast as it was being added.

Anxiously awaiting,

David
74 Thing
79 Westy (leaking badly)
