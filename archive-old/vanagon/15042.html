&gt; I have an '85 Vanagon that needs new CV joints. I was just interested in
&gt; seeing how much all of you had paid for your replacement.
&gt; 
&gt; The guy quoted 185 for a new joint and labor for 1 (that's making the most
&gt; noise)
&gt; 
&gt;                             OR
&gt; 
&gt; $580 for all 4.
&gt; 
&gt; I know for sure that I can't do all 4...I'm a student w/ $5 in checking and
&gt; $20 in savings. Is there anything that I can do to make sure the other 3
&gt; last just until summer? I should have enough $$$$ for it then.
&gt; 
The question is how much time you have on your hands.
you can remove all 4 CV's, and with the help of a book, clean and
re-pack them for under $20.00. If you need new boots, those are pretty
cheap. IF you do this, and have any boots that are even questionable,
now would be the time to replace them. After you have them out and
cleaned, check for wear and pitting. A new CV can be ordered for under
$75, Ithink. Doing the labor saves many many dollars, and plus, it can
actually be fun. Ihad to do this on my '78, and while extremely messy,
it's not too bad.
