Subject: Re: sunroof like in Jurassic Park

&gt;This being Friday, let me share one of the crazier ideas concocted in my
&gt;VW obsessed mind. David Schwarze started it, though. As we admired our
&gt;busses, he said: &quot;you know, if I were you, I'd put a sunroof where your
&gt;luggage rack is right now.&quot; &quot;Mmmh,&quot; I replied, &quot;cool thought, but we still
&gt;need something to seal off the closed pop-top.&quot;
&gt;
&gt;I really wish I had a sunroof to expand the angle of vision and double the
&gt;pleasures of sight-seeing. With a wide sunroof reaching far down towards
&gt;the windshield, we could see summets during mountainous drives. Now do you
&gt;remember the plexiglass roofs on the Ford Explorers in &quot;Jurassic Park?&quot;
&gt;Couldn't something similar replace the Westie's front luggage rack? The
&gt;seals along the roof and the pop-top would be the same, but the plexiglass
&gt;roof would be more wedge-shaped for better looks and aerodynamics.
&gt;
&gt;Now am I crrrazy, or what? :)

nope i think it is a great idea. in a weeird kinda way it is updated
driving version of the sunrooves that came as standard equip on dormobiles.
just goes to show ya that you can't keep a good idea down..
