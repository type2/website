Subject: Re: How 'bout a newsgroup


Dave commits heresy by writing:

&gt;The reason for this message is to inquire whether the group has considered
&gt;the possibility of using a Vanagon newsgroup...


Perhaps the topic should be more apropriately, Dave's future on this
list.

Sorry Dave, we like it the way it is. Want a newsgroup? Start one 
yourself. ... Can't stand the amount of mail ... unsubscribe.

Want a &quot;techie&quot; group....this ain't it. Think of this list as
a &quot;support group&quot; we meet, we discuss our problems with our Typ2s,
share wisdom and thoughts, but most of all we share a sense of 
community with eachother that is focused through our Typ2s...be
them splitties, loafs, bricks, or EVs...

Hey Gerry..._dot_can we put together a &quot;boiler plate&quot; response or
FAQ anytime a newbie starts this type of thread again?  ;-)


Cantankerously yours,

Ric
