Joel,

I still beg to differ (oh-oh, here he goes again)...  Barndoors are 
mechanically different and have no rear entry into the cargo area, totally 
different dash (essentially NO dash except for the pod), typically had 4X16 
wheels, gas tank/filler neck is in the engine compartment, pedal arrangement is 
more lever-like, and the front axle/steering is totally different from late 
splitties, too...  

The differences between A/C and W/C vanagons is very slight by comparison as 
the A/C models were designed with the eventuality of being W/C in much the same 
way as the T4's are being prepared to accept VR6's and Syncro configurations.  
Admittedly, each new year is an improvement on the previous year, but when it 
comes to driving a barndoor vs. driving a late Splitty, there is a BIG 
difference from my experience....   So much for M not so HO...  &lt;8-o

        Jon
