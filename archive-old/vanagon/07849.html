&gt; Hi gang,
&gt; 
&gt; Has anyone seen/made/bought a locking latch for the engine compartment 
&gt; lid on bread loaves?  Everywhere I look, it's just an unlocked button 
&gt; latch.  The mechanism appears to be significantly different (p &lt; 0.05)  :) 
&gt; than the mechanism for the big rear lid into the passenger compartment, so a 
&gt; simple swap is out, right?  This open engine compartment seems like a 
&gt; security risk to me, leaving the engine open for tampering, and running a 
&gt; risk of theft for the battery, tire chains, and other junk squirreled 
&gt; away back there.  
&gt; 
&gt; What (if anything) have you folks in Netland done about this?  I'd feel 
&gt; better not leaving my engine compartment unlocked.

I searched in the junkyard until I found a locking door.  Then I bought
the lock, and took it to a locksmith to have a key made for it.  They
sell these things at J.C. Whitney for $10, but they state that they are
only for bugs, so I don't know if they will work with bus engine hatches.

Good luck,

-David
