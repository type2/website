Subject: Re: Been To VW Heaven

I, too, found a little island of VW love in Costa Mesa.
Three weeks ago whilst searching for a place to get my Westy tent
frame welded up A fellow named Dave introduced himself.  He's got a
'56 ghia and a '68 Westy in the process of total restoration.  His
daily driver is a *totally* restored '72 Westy that is exceptional.
He's got a bunch of engines, carbs, trim, lots of tools inside the
leaky-roofed garage.  We chatted for hours, then his lovely Austrian
wife drove up in a scirocco.  We said good bye and went about our
Sunday afternoon chores.

&quot;Once in a while you get shown the light.
 In the strangest of places if you look at it right.&quot;
