     I *DIDN'T* check the condition of my valves on my '77 dual port and it 
     dropped a valve head on number 3 when I was 250 miles from home. The 
     engine ran perfectly though for the 8 months up to this point.
     
     Don't want to scare you but I would thoroughly check the engine if 
     you're going on a long trip.
