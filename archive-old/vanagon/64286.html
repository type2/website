Subject:      Sigh of RELIEF - Your list admins

Well, we really got the dust stirred up this morning/early afternoon
updating the VANAGON subscribers list AND getting everyone's personal
mechanism of delivery set properly.

Thanks to all (especially the NOMAIL and DIGEST) folks for bearing with
us during the changeover.

All seems in order (for the moment), so we're going to take a breather.

Cheers,

        Chris Smith
        Ron Lussier
