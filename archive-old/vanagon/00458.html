Subject: Re: Auxiliary Heater (fwd)

Did this message hit the list?  I got no responses and no discussion.  Am 
I crazy or what?  I was thinking of just hooking up the a/c lines to the 
auxiliary heater (the one under that back see that's gone).  I don't care 
about the front, so it'd just be the a/c lines in the back.  I guess one 
issue is the size of the IN line into the cooling exchanger (What do they 
call that in an A/C system -- my fiche is in the garage, so I can't look 
it up).  There'a already a fan, so I thought it might be fairly simple.  
I hate A/C anyway.  Of course, you can only hate A/C if you live in 
places like Minnesota (or Alaska for that matter).
