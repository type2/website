Subject: Quite a scare last night

All,

The Thing is feeling a bit under the weather right now(can you guess
what I will be doing this weekend?), so it is parked :-( Last night
while driving home from work, in another car, I see a VW
approaching(telltale parking lights on top of fenders) As I pass I turn
my head to look, and what should I see, MY THING HEADING THE OTHER WAY!
Naturally I turn around and break all land speed records(for a Chevy
Celebrity anyway) chasing this car down, which had gotten about 2 miles
ahead of me by the time I got over the shock, and reacted, and dealt
with a damn red light(why do they always change when one is in a
hurry?).  I'm getting closer and my wife(who's in the car with me) says
&quot;are you sure it is yours, look closely before pulling the person over.&quot;
 Well, it is white, it has dark colored bumpers, it has a white hardtop.
Yes damnit it is mine! Wait, what are those things mounted on the end of
the bumper, extra brake lights? Mine doesn't have those. Where is the
chrome tipped exhaust, where are the wide rear tires(courtesy of the
PO), its also a little closer to the ground.
I pull around the side of it, and (fortunately for me, and the
occupants) it is a 74 Thing painted exactly like mine, and has a hardtop
on it exactly like mine. My darling wife then says, pull them over and
say Hi.  Yeah, right, it is 12:30am on an unlit road, in rural Texas,
like they would stop just to say hi, to some wierdo in a Chevy. Most
likely they have a gun, and would blow my head off.

Maybe I'll see them during the day, while I am driving my Thing, and we
can chat:-D  That would be good.

Cheers with heart racing,

David
74 Thing
