Subject: RE: '52 Barndoor update


&gt;      The guy I bought it from had only owned it a month.  He bought it 
from
&gt;a older man, who has a farm about four miles from his house.  Derek, the 
guy
&gt;I bought the bus from, took me to meet the guy.  He was very nice, and let 
us
&gt;check out his VW graveyard behind his barn.  I couldn't believe my eyes!
&gt; There if front of me was a '56 panel van, five other split window buses,
&gt;three bay windows, one thing, one fastback, and a bunch of bugs.

Eric, what state is this guy in? West coast? East? Midwest?  Can the rest of
us ever drop by? &lt;drool&gt;
