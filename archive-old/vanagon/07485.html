&gt;
&gt;Does anyone out there know the details of the GATT bill and if it will
&gt;reduce or eliminate the tariff on imported trucks?
&gt;
&gt;I remember way back in the '70's that the US slapped a 25% tariff on trucks
&gt;to retaliate for some country (Germany?) putting a tariff on our chickens,
&gt;and that's why we don't get no steenkin' non-passenger versions of VW
&gt;buses anymore.
&gt;
&gt;If GATT passes, might we get cheaper prices on the truck part of the
&gt;Winnebago camper????   Might we get stranger versions of the Eurovan?
&gt; 
&gt;Might VWoA pass on the savings to the purchaser???      (yeah, right.)
&gt;
&gt;Any foreign trade experts or congresspersons or senators in this group?
&gt;

Wasn't the import tariff due to the Japanese making a killing in the
light truck business at the expense of Motown?
