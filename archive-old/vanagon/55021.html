Subject: Bob Lewis VW?  EV MV?

&gt; Hi all,
&gt;         Still looking for that van for my family.  From all your
&gt; suggestions, I have come up with the &quot;optimum&quot; vehicle for my particular
&gt;  brood being a 93-95 EV camper with the two rear facing seats.  Couple of
&gt; questions still:
&gt; 
&gt; 1)  What is the difference between an EV MV and an EV GL?  Is either bigger or roomier inside?  I found what
&gt; sounds like a nice EV in maine -- MV93, 29,500 mi., camper, extra seats,
&gt; 17,500.  Sound worth it?  There is also a 93 GL in todays paper (San
&gt; Jose) which brings me to the next question:
&gt; 
&gt; 2)  Anybody have any dealings with Bob Lewis VW in San Jose?  That last
&gt; GL is through him.
&gt; 
&gt; As always, any input for this newbie is appreciated.  Your help has been
&gt; immense.  Thanks again...Thad
