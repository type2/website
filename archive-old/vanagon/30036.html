Subject: Odo broke.....

Hey All:

Yes, its time for more bus trivial pursuits.  To be breif, My Odometer has
stopped turning. I know that this is not as critical as the speedo ( I will
never part with my bus, even after it puts me in cebtor's prison) but there
is a certain amount of pride in see the miles click by knowing that the
muffler will not fall off anytime soon. 

1.) Is it easy to find out what the problem is? (The odo has stopped
turning, including the trip meter)

2.) (A dumb question) There is red wax covering the cables running into the
pod. Will I go to jail/hell if I desecrate the sacred VW seal?

Thanks again


Matt
