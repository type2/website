&gt; I hadn't either, but there is a cap on the exhaust pipe where the O2
&gt; sensor should go.  There also doesn't seem to be a spare wire on the
&gt; pig-tail indicating that it is missing? Got me!

&gt; I am not familiar with any FI vehicles without an O2 sensor.

&gt; &gt;Sorry, I forgot to mention it is an 82 westy, 120k and as far as I can
&gt; &gt;tell, it doesn't have a O2 sensor??
&gt; &gt;Chaz

&gt; 
&gt; 
Well, many of our beloved FI VWs came without O2 sensors.  All Type 3s,
All Type 4s, Beetles '75-'79 and Buses '75-'79 and Vanagons '80-'83 that
had fuel injection did NOT have O2 sensors, EXCEPT for some California
models.  

I believe the only air-cooled Vanagons with O2 sensors are California
models.  I know my '81 doesn't have one and it's not supposed to.  

I know the '79 CA Buses had O2 sensors, and even tho the '78 CA Buses
had catalytic converters, i don't think they had O2 sensors.  

The CA air-cooled Vanagons also have electronic ignition while the
federal models have standard points-and-condenser ignition.  

When they switched to the wasserboxer, I think they all got O2 sensors.
