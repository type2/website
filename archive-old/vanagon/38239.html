All:

Has anybody tried searching the archives lately?  I did this morning and the
message headers showed up fine but when I clicked on a header I either got a
series of messages with part of the desired message at the bottom or I got
something completely different.  Did Gerry get his first beer-of-the-month
and delete all the message indices or something? ;)
