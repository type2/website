Subject: Re: Leakin' oil


&gt;I'd noticed before (and I checked then, believe me!) that the oil level 
&gt;was dropping a lot faster than normal.  I'd say Peter Lima's description 
&gt;of &quot;dripping oil like a seive&quot; describes our situation pretty well.
&gt;
&gt;Total repair cost?  Zero.  Time invested in repair?  Maybe 12 seconds.  
&gt;Problem?  Oil filter unscrewed and was nearly ready to fall off!
&gt;
&gt;D'oh!!  I check the tightness of the oil filter before every long or 
&gt;off-road exploring trip now.  I'd hate to pollute our wilderness with 4 
&gt;litres of used 20/50--also hate to risk blowing the motor by running it 
&gt;for even a few seconds with zero litres of oil in it!

Two questions!
1. What if I ain't got an oil filter?
2. Why were you using 20/50?  Seems very thick -- my mech recommends
straight 40.  20/50 can hide leaks however, I've noticed.

Anyway ol' Scarecrow is back in the garage again. . .failed emissions
miserably yesterday and is really leaking oil (someone had to mop up behind
me at the emissions station after I drove away!)
