Subject: Re: Coolant Refill Bottle

&gt;I've noticed that my coolant refill bottle seems to run dry, in the space of
&gt;about a week.  The engine was recently fixed for a colant leak and the heads
&gt;rebuilt.
&gt;
&gt;1.) Is loss from the refill tank normal?
&gt;2.) Where do I check for leaks?

I have the same problem.  As far as I know, all coolant leaks were fixed
and I STILL have a regularly dry overflow bottle.  I'll be looking for
suggestions, too.
