&gt; It would appear that all i need to do is remove the old muffler (cut bolts
&gt; off? mostly likely) and then bolt the new one on using the new gaskets and
&gt; new bolts.

That's basically it! There are six bolts - four on the bottom and two on the
top.  You will probably have to remove the tin from the rear of the engine
to get at the top two.  This is the worst part of the job, IMO.

p.s.  Don't forget the Mopar Heat control valve solvent!
