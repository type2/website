&gt;Based on the info from my books here, the # 0301353 1500 was installed prior
&gt;to the 1964 model year (what's yer VIN?), and only as an option (M215, M216)
&gt;as the 63's were equipped with a standard 1200 40HP engine.
&gt;
&gt;Here's what info I've got:
&gt;
&gt;Jan 63  VIN (Parts Book does not say)  Eng# 0143543  1500 option introduced
&gt;Aug 63  VIN 1144282  Eng # 0578878  Beginning VIN for 1964 Model year
&gt;
&gt;I would say that yer # 0590821 was made within the next month or so after
&gt;that. (The last 64 made in December of 1963 was VIN 1222500, but VW of course
&gt;gives no engine number in the books or the microfiche film).

The VIN for the last 64 seems to be too low. I wrote to VW, and got the
following info on my '64 bug:

My VW was built on 18 November 1963
chasis # 5 932 883
engine # 8 165 219 (1200 40 bhp)
