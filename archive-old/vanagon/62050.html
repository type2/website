Karl:
Auto parts stores sell a device for such occasions. It consists of a plug
that fits in your ciggy lighter and a nine volt battery. It is enough
current to keep your memory alive but not enough to fry any wires in case
of a short. 
Ironicaly the digifant computer is not sophisticated enough to care, but
the radio is.
