Subject: re:CV's (was Las Vegas VW stuff)

It was prophesized:

&gt;&gt;did all the CVs and had us out of the super clean shop in 1/2
&gt;&gt;an hour, and the total bill was about $21.00.  Did not hear the
&gt;&gt;slightest
&gt;&gt;bump for the rest of the trip.

&gt;DOH!!!!
&gt;Just had inner and outter CVs done on the '83 Westy at a local
&gt;Phoenix/Scottsdale VW  (in desparation)  dealership. Took almost 4
&gt;hours and
&gt;cost hundreds of dollars!!!  Only passanger side.

The $21.00 had to be for greasing, not for replacement, right?
Otherwise when I hear my CV's clunking next time, I am taking a vacation
to Las Vegas

Cheers,
