Subject:      Re: Unreal oil consumption on diesel Va

&gt;I Don't have al the info you need, but can say that my 1985 Turbo diesel
&gt;Jetta has 140 k on it and doesn't use a quart of oil in three thousand
miles.
&gt;Not bragging, just giving you a benchmark.

Oh, its very different if you run a TD in a passenger car or in a Vanagon.
The TD in a Vanagon is really weared out at 140 k if it is used at business
work.
On my Golf the TD runs with 160 k as fine as at 40 k. A friend have a TD
Vanagon
with 200 k (non business). It's spilling oil and he is looking for a new
one.
