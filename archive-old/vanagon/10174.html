&gt; The Eurovan Weekender does have a fridge under the driver's side rear
&gt; facing bucket seat.

I'm not sure I would call that thing a fridge.  :)
It's very small, and has one of those Kooltron mechanisms, or whatever
you call it.  It will only cool to about 40 degrees below the temperature
outside, so if you have that thing running in 90 degree heat, food will
spoil in it.  I don't care much for this type of cooler - just MHO of
course...
