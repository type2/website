&gt; Here's another:  I CC'ed the combustion chambers, and got them all to within 
&gt; ..5CC of each other.  So I measured the deck height and got .089&quot; and the CR 
&gt; is 7.7 to one.  This is with .040&quot; shims, without them,  CR= 8.45 to one.  
&gt; The jist of it is that the shims must be factory, or else the CR would be 
&gt; through the roof.  The case is a T3, late 70 - 71.  I think these had 7.7 to 
&gt; one CR right?
&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone have an opinion on 7.7 to one or is this still too high for my 
&gt; bus?

Chris, I went through exactly the same process about 5 years ago when rebuilding
the motor for my '65 Samba. I'll check my notes when I go home tonight, but I 
remember choosing a CR of 7.5-7.5. I used an 'AE' prefix case (I think this is 
about the same vintage as yours). Berg recommends a CR of 6.9 for buses, since 
they run hotter than bugs with the same motor. *However*, everyone I spoke with 
felt this number was extremely conservative. As a precaution, I have the stock 
doghouse oil cooler as well as a full-flow external cooler (with an electric fan
mounted inside the engine compartment - I tried to stay German with one from a 
Rabbit, but the early Civic fan fit poi-fictly!). The motor runs great, if not a
little *too* cool sometimes if you can believe it, so I put in a thermostatic 
bypass valve.

I'll get back to you with the CR data, Chris.

-Erik.
