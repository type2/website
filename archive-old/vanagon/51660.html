Subject: Re: Syncro Westie GVW thanks

Hey Al!  Langley is about an hour east of Vancouver.

I have weighed the van per axle as well.. here's the info from my 2 
lighter weighs.  The van is '90 Syncro Westfalia:

1160 kg  - 2557 lb front
1130 kg  - 2491 lb rear
2290 kg  - 5048 lb total weight

1200 kg  - 2645 lb front
1120 kg  - 2469 lb rear
2310 kg  - 5092 lb total weight

These weights are with 2 adults up front, loaded water, propane, fuel 
_at_ approx 83% full, and loaded for a weekend of camping.

Hope this info helps.   That's why I run Yokohama's with 1710 lb load 
rating, and 8 plies (D rating) on our van.

Take care,
Harry.

&gt; And where is Langley?  BC yes but Vancouver, Kamloops, Blue River?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for the info.  Did you perhaps do a front rear weigh?  I have the
&gt; feeling I'm near the limit of the tire (Laredo) in question on the rear.
&gt; 
&gt; Assuming 375lbs of folks in the front that puts us in the 2500-2800 range
&gt; in the back AT THE LIMIT for the 1325lbs rated for the tire.  Guess I'll take
&gt; joel's advice and jus weigh the critter at the local trucker emporium.
