Subject: Re hot solenoid not kicking


Subject: Re: trip report starter problem

Sean (via Linda Bartnik) had a starter (solenoid) problem when hot.....

So you liked King's Dominion?  If we go to Manassas Bug-Out Labor Day,
might check it out. The starting gremlins I have also, and I suspect it has
something to do with either ignition switch dead spot (at RARE times I turn
off key and it still runs- any experts out there on THAT?) or more likely
sticking plunger in solenoid- I too put in new starter last year, but after
a long Hot run, may not start- I've found it helps to rev it up before
killing ignition, then while still spinning (out of gear, clutch in) kick
the start on ignition- you can hear the solenoid try if the extra juice
makes it go.
Otherwise, if I'm not on a hill, I get underneath with my trusting 14g wire
with alligator clips on each end and attach one end to the pull-off
connector on the solenoid (red wire goes to it), and touch the other end to
the HOT terminal from batter to starter- it should try to kick over.
Another method that works on this gremlin (and I've helped others who are
amazed) is to beat on the solenoid/starter with a hammer and it goes!
I still think it's some sort of hang-up in the solenoid, like sticking
plunger; heat might swell it and it sticks worse?  The direct jolt (where
relay would help) makes the relectant plunger go; beating on it helps free
it?  Mike Benthin in NJ
