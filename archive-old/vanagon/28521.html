Subject: early Vgon shocks from Sears

I couldn't resist the 50% off sale, so bought new front shocks at Sears.
They didn't make it easy; 1st Sears store saw them in the paper directory
but not on the computer, so said they were not available.  2nd Sears store
found they were available via special order even tho' not on the computer.
The right item number is 97542; $10each on sale.

I worried about installation, since other old-VW shock installs have been
a rusty-bolt nightmare.  This one was not bad: the top bolt has a little
plastic hat on it and the bottom bolt has a brass nut.  Only tricky part
is that for the bottom you need TWO 22mm (or 7/8 inch) sockets.  Box wrench
won't do as nut and bolt are both shrouded by the metal of the lower
suspension arm.
