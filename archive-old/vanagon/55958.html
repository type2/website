Subject: Saw an EV dbl cab today...

Sorry, another sill sighting.

Leaving work late today, I saw a white (do they come any other way?) 
EV dbl cab pickup. Nice, and it had four doors like a tri star. Only 
thing that I didn't like were the cheesy rear fenders hanging under 
the box - looked like they belonged on a boat trailer.
I much prefer the storage lockers in the Vanagon p/u style - maybe 
these are an option in the EV p/u? (I don't recall noticing the 
fenders before, and we do have several EV pickups in town)
