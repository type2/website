Subject:  20,000uDollars on split 

Me three! See long quoted article below;-)

My comments on the list split.

1. Volume is way too high. A split will help this.
2. Not quoting long articles will help. Especially if you
   are just going to say 'Me Three'.
3. Don't cross post unless necessary. If there is too much
   cross posting, we'll have two lists that are too big.
4. Try to get to the point. Think short.
5. Restrict .sigs to two lines with: Name, van type year, location 
   No cute 30 line ASCII graphics


Just the comments of someone who can't keep up, and was thinking of giving up
trying before the split idea came along.
