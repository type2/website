Subject: RE: Camper/ pop top conversion

It's sounds like the top which is usually used by the Sunliner company (our
'Westfalia') in Australia.  The top pops straight up on spring loaded X shaped
hinges on each side (gees it's hard to describe these things).  Inside it has a
sill on which you can place some boards and a foam mattress so you can 'sleep
in the roof' - I am not sure if this is the case with Westfalias.  So you have
the headroom and then quickly make the bed up in the roof when you're finished
for the day.....it is fitted just by nibbling a hole in the roof...

These tops seem fairly robust - a lot of these tops in older campers (60s, 70s)
in AUS are still in great cond as regards fibreglass and canvas.  However, I
don't think the replacement/ repair of the canvas would be as easy as that on a
Westphalia (from what I've read here it seems you buy the seals and bits and do
it yourself?) - The canvas on these pop tops has more of a 'permanent fix' to
the glass part of the top - but as I said they are TOUGH....
