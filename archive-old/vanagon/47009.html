So Gcarlen_at_aol_dot_com says:
&gt; I'm not sure what kind of heaters are available.  I am looking for something
&gt; to use in the winter months for camping that will operate off of propane or
&gt; some other source (other than a running engine).  Can anyone tell me what
&gt; will fit my needs? ....and does anyone have one for sale?

I've got one from a company in England called Propex that Chris Gibbs mentioned
a few weeks back.  It's real small, 14&quot; x 6&quot; x 4.52&quot;.  I've been wanting this
kind of heater for a few years now.  It runs about $500 all told.  It fits
unders the bench seat, or it can go in one of the cabinets I suppose.  Chris
said he spliced his in with a pipe running under the cabinets and behind the
fridge.  That's how I'll do mine.  

It's a small heater/blower with the intake and exhaust through holes in the
bottom of the camper.  The heat ducts go through the bench seat fire wall.

If you want more details, email me or Chris Gibbs.

Here's the companies address and phone:

PROPEX (UK) LTD
CAMPION HOUSE
LINCOLN ROAD
LEADENHAM
LINCOLN, LN5 OPE
ENGLAND

Tel. 011-44 (1703) 528555

The phone number is correct as I've been corresponding with them
lately.

Cheers!
