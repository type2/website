Subject: Camper Closet Contents List

&gt;     return to Maryland by Labor Day. We are thinking of following US 50
&gt;     all the way back, but am always open to other ideas...

Bad idea possibly. Distance is too far. Pick your back roads by plotting
trips on dirt roads through mountains (enjoy your syncro). Then make up time
on the highways. 

&gt;     (2) What we will need for life in the camper, beyond what VW supplies.
