Subject: Tips, Tricks, etc.

Hi yall.

I just spent the weekend working on the old Bus, Vroomhilde. I have
some tips and tricks for general edification and archival. I dont gaurantee
these for any car, and some may be applicable for 71 Busses only. YMMV.

Brakes, Rear, adjusting stars: the stars that you are turning are standard
thread, and you are turning the nut around the bolt. Use this fact in calculating
which way to turn them. To get a stuck star out of its little cup, you can
wither chew them up with vice-grips, or use a longer 17mm bolt, like the
shock absorber bolt, and turn it into the center, and it will bottom out, pushing
the star out of the cup. Use HIGH TEMP anti-seize when putting it back in, but not
too much.

Rear axle nut: Douse this puppy with liquid wrench (or kin) about 5 times
over the week preceeding the removal. Makes taking it off a dream. Also, have
a helper stand on the brakes (therefore, loosen the nut before you back off the
shoes) when turning this nut. Putting all that torque on the e-brake and
the CVs and spider gears is not nice. By my estimate, it took about 800 
foot lbs (180lbs 5 feet from the nut) to break this loose.  I dont think
even my bus, with beefed tranny and CVs generates 800 lbs of torque when driving.
When putting it back on, dont go over the reccommended torque. You should go 
close to it, then calculate which cotter keyhole you need. Over torquing
does noone any good, but can eat a bearing in a 1000 miles.

Rear wheel bearings: You cant get these out of the races to grease them,
so follow this little trick: Get an inflator needle for a baskteball. Get a 
spare grease gun nozzle. Put the needle in the nozzle (sounds like a kids song)
and cut the end of it off at a 45 degree angle, down near the tip. (Or just
buy a grease needle) When you have the hub off just stick this between to roller
bearings, and pump in a good layer of grease. (You dont even have to take the
grease seal off for this.) If you needle is more than an inch long, you 
should be behind all the old grease, pushing it out of the hub. This worked well
for me. Investigate the grease for metal shavings, water, discoloration,
and think about getting bread and having someone else change the bearings
some time in the future.

Brake hardware: Most FLAPS dont carry the right hardware for the 71-76 Bus. Bendix
and others have the wrong shoes in the computers. (Mabye just at Trak Auto)
Bendix does not have the large spring hole, and the e-brake pivot hole in
Wagner is too small. I had to use old hardware, buffed back to life with
some sandpaper. Also, if you get the hold-down hardware (pins, springs, cups)
get the whole set, as the new cups wont go over the old pins.

Thats it for now, I may write some more tips and tricks for the archives
if I can remeber them. (All that short term memory loss is really anoyying)

BTW, my favorite local garage, the Buggy Barn, just moved from 25 miles away
to a mile away, and they are investing in a full machine shop. Ferdinand
is smiling down on me.
