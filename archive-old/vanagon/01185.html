Subject: 


I read recently, someone posted saying that one of the problems with 
overheating has to do with the fact that the filler tube is lower than 
part of the cooling system, therefore creating a 'bubble' somewhere else 
in the system. Would it work to back the vanagon up onto floor stands 
before changing or adding coolant?
