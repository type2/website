&gt;Ok, there must be some toy folks here. I just picked up a 1982 or 1982
&gt;HOTWHEELS &quot;Sunagon&quot;. Was there really anything like this issued by VW? The top
&gt;comes off to show a pretty different setup of the interior. Kinda neat
&gt;actually. Also, is anyone snatching up Johnny Lightning Bug Bombs? Wanna
&gt;trade? Anyone have a list of VW toy stuff (mfr, date, model, etc)?

sheesh! what are you trying to start! i've been trying to keep this quiet!! :)

do you want vanagon models? or just any old bus model? if any old bus, there
are lots of split-window Microbus models that are about $20 each. (1/43 scale)
and i have only about 133 vanagon models. :)
