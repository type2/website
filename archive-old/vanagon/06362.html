Subject: Re: Propane going out while driving

I vote with Derek on this one. It has never been demonstrated that using 
the fridge on propane while driving is dangerous. Many current 
refrigerators are only 120V and propane with no 12V at all. If the pilot 
should blow out, the gas will automatically be turned off.

Exception: when fueling up all flames should be out for safety.
