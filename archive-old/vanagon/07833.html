I installed the seats from an '88 Volvo 240 GL. (Were they already in when
you dropped by, David S.?) You do sit higher, but you also get used to it. Did
not have to put in a board or other interface to bolt them in, because I
could make them wide enough by inverting the &quot;feet.&quot; Cost me $100 at the
junkyard. If anyone wants to install the same seats, let me know and I'll
elaborate on how to get the tracks to be wide enough.
