Subject: Michelin LTX M/S for the Vanagon

Vanagonians:

I've decided to trade in my Bridgestone Duelers P195/75R14 for
Michelin LTX M/S LT195/75R14. The passenger tire Duelers stink,
very squirrelly in the wind, to the point of being dangerous.
They only have 1500 miles on them, but I hate 'em, so I'm going
to take a lose on this. I can only hope that others can learn
from my mistake.

I was looking to buy Michelin XZX but they are no longer being 
made. Tire Rack was sold out of these also. The other option was 
the Michelin XC4S, but that is more of a utility truck tire, I 
think the ride would have been more harsh than the LTX. A few
list members had reported that the reinforced Contis handled
poorly in the rain, so I'm going to pass on those. 

The LTX are a C range tire, 1435lbs max load, 50psi and cost $92, 
which includes mounting and balancing. Does any body else have 
the Michelin LTX M/S on their van? Do people like these tires? 

TIA,
