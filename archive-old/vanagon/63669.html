The big end is cut, and then re-machined.  The piston pin bushing is replaced. 
 If the are doing it right, the also replace the rod bolts and balance the 
set, total weight and end for end.

What all does a machinist do when you have your rods &quot;reconditioned&quot;?
What kind of &quot;plasti-gauge&quot; reading is best at the big ends with new
bearings?
