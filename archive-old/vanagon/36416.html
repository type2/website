Subject: Re: VR6 Engine


&gt; &gt;I hear that the V6 has one cylinder head, is that possible?
&gt;
&gt; The VR6 is a &quot;narrow V&quot; engine.....traditional V6s have approx 60 degrees
&gt; between cylinder banks and two cylinder heads...the VR6 has 15 degrees
&gt; between cylinder banks (the pistons are almost vertical). Because of the
&gt; design the banks of cylinders are close enough to make use of a single
&gt; cylinder head.


I had always heard that the reason for the &quot;V&quot; configuration, was twofold:

1.) To fit more cylinders under a reasonable-length hood,

2.) To make intake distribution easier.


Sounds like this 15-degree V6 loses out on both those ideas??? What's
the point of spreading the cylinders a mere 15 degrees apart? No
advantage over a straight-6, and manufacturablilty sounds tougher???

Anyone know?
