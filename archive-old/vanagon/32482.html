Subject: Which Carbs?

Hey Y'all,

After trying to nurse my sick, old, tired carbs along on my '72 bus 
and not wanting to pay through the nose to get the throttle shaft 
bushings rebuilt, I decided to pay out the %&amp;# and purchase some new carbs.
So now the question becomes which carbs should I buy? 

I have a 1.8L GEX type IV engine with 20K miles on it and as far as
I know it is stock. I am missing some smog equipment on it that the 
PO thought it did not need and have always had to pay extra for
&quot;adjustments&quot; every two years here in CA to pass the smog test.

After looking in a VW magazine for some info. I found a place a few
miles down the freeway (I want to get them installed before the 
weekend) called Fast Freddy's that sells Weber Carbs.   I've been told 
the Kadron carbs are not high quality and I'd rather shell out some 
extra cash up front for superior product (have I been misinformed?)
They had two kits that I was looking at.

The first Kit contains Dual 34 ICT Weber carbs, Aluminum manafolds, 
and cross bar linkage all at a price of $399.95.  They claim an 
increase of 10-15% more power. 

The second kit contains Dual IDF XE 40mm carbs., Aluminum manifolds,
Hex-rod crossbar linkage, Velocity Stacks and K&amp;N style 3 1/4&quot; air filters
all at a price of $579.99.  They claim an increase of 25-40% more 
power. 

Could someone explain the difference between the ICT and IDF carbs?  
Are these fair prices and is this a solid solution or should I be looking
into some other set-up?

I was planning on adding an electronic ignition in the very near 
future and would not mind spending the extra money for the IDF carbs 
if they really could provide more power. ( Does anyone know what kind 
of power they are refering to?)  I have a Hobie Cat and a dirt bike that I like
to trailer along with me when I get in the campfest roadtrip mode, so the
extra power would be welcome, but if they're blowing smoke and hot air up
my tail pipe I might as well buy some other set up and get Electronic Ignition
now.

If someone could recommend which set up they would choose if they 
were in my tires it would help a lot.  Also, does anyone know if J.C. 
Whitney is carrying the Electronic Ignition set that Mr. Hoover 
suggests, or should I buy it direct?

Thanks for any advice,
Howard

P.S.  If any one needs help with the old bus recovery squad, I live 
in Laguna Beach, Ca. and work in Irvine.  While I don't have much 
knowledge on the mechanical workings of busses I have become quite 
adept at pushing them to the nearest gas station  :)
