Subject: Multi-spark discharge (MSD) ignition for Vanagon

I hear promising reports for Multi-Spark Discharge (MSD) systems -
seems one of the few simple performance enhancers that doesn't fall
into the category of Snake Oil.

Has anyone tried to fit an MSD unit to a Vanagon?  Any good?

Which unit is best?  The brand names I've heard are MSD and Mallory -
are there others?  What brands are available here in the UK - my van
is a European-spec 1989 1.9L carburated Transporter?
