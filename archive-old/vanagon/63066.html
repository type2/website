Subject:      Re: Who knows? lugs, thanks

My understanding is that the shape of the lug seat is different on the
steel and chrome lug nuts and bolts. One is rounded and one is cone
shaped. Using the wrong lug will cause a poor fitting until the wheel
deforms to match the lug. The PO of my Syncro put Mercedes wheels on, but
used the wrong lug nuts and as I found out yesterday when I mounted my
new 215-70-R14 Firestones, that the nuts had deformed to match the wheel.
The PO also failed to change to longer lug bolts, so the nuts do not
fully seat. Another project I have to get to!!
