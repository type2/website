Side note:

We had a helluva hard time finding temp sensor II. We knew from Bently and
Muir where it is *supposed* to be and we kept rooting around in between
cylinders #3 and #4. Finally we figured out that the PO had temp sensor II
moved near cylinder #1, on the opposite side of the engine. I assume he did=

this because #3 &amp; #4 tend to run hotter... has anyone out there done (or
heard of) this?

 This is for '80 aircooled pancakes:
 The engine cooling van blow cold air from behind through the cooling ducts=
. =
That cause the front cylinders (#1 &amp; #3) running on higher temperatures. =
Check out the firing order (easily to find on top of the pancake), maybe you=
 =
will find the answer if the temp sensor is on the right or left side. I =
remember, that Porsche had problems because of this pre-warmed cooling air =
for the front cylinders. BTW, my '80 have no temp sensor, I have no idea if =
=
it is running hot or cold.

See you on the road! (Little bit far away)
