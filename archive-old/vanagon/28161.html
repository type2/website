Subject: 90 westy purchase update

Just drove the 90 westy with 28,500 original miles.  Auto. Air. Asking 12,000
 Problems:  The transmission case is leaking fluid.....could/should be
covered by warranty.  Also, the original faucet has been replaced with some
pump mechanism....don't like it.  The power mirrors don't work...no big deal
and the front left speaker is out.  Probably no big deal.

Positives:  low mileage one owner, (A retired guy who I spoke to who traded
for a car do to health problems.)  The aftermarket propane furace was
installed by an RV shop.  Also it has a great awning over the door...quality.
 The pop top, interior etc are in very good condition.  No rust, none
anywhere.

Big problem, I have an 87 westy gl, air, (aftermarket) cruise, power windows
I just &quot;fixed up&quot;  New starter, new front brakes, new exhaust, tune up. etc.
.  In fact I'm having the seam rust removed and having the paint touched up
as we speak,  Anyone interested?  I'd have to get 8500.00.  95,000 miles.
 All camping equipment excellent....I was planning to keep this vehicle a
long time. Don't know how long this 90 will sit.  Decisions, decisions.....
Thoughts appreciated,

Ajax
