I'm going to need four new tires for my '87 Westy soon
(big trip coming up).  I've read the FAQ but there isn't
a lot of up to date data on what people are using.

I'd like to get 205/70 R14 reinforced's but can't seem to
find any. Some places have told me the Michelin MXL's have been
discontinued and one other says they can order them (minimum
quantity two) for about $95 a piece.

What are other Westy owners doing? Anyone got some low mileage
used tires :) ?

Thanks much,

Jeff
