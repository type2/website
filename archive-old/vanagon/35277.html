Subject: Split:Rubber:Comparison Shopping

Splitters:

Life is tough, I have three 67s in need of some replacement
rubber.  Years ago I bought some replacement rubber from
Vintage VW Parts in Glendale, CA.  I have gone through my
catalogs to check prices on rubber and have found that for
the 20-or-so pieces I would want to replace with new, the
total price from the Bus Boys is $484.75 (plus S&amp;H).  For
the same pieces from Bus Stop (RMMW), the price is $543.52
(plus S&amp;H).  I also have a West Coast Metric catalog with
the same pieces, but the prices are OLD.

Obviously, the Westy will not need skylight rubber like the
Deluxe and the Double Cab will not need a rear hatch seal,
but they all have the windshield and front door seals in
need of replacement.  Has anyone onlist been a position to
see the products of all three suppliers at the same time for
a valid comparison of quality?  If the collective wisdom is
that WCM or Bus Boys or RMMW wins hands-down, no matter the
price, who am I to fight success?

I am not rich.  I could be paying more for total rubber
replacement than I spent on any of several buses.  It just
seems like this is an opportunity to have three sets of
rubber in front of me to compare them side-by-side.

Taking all suggestions...on second thought...EXCEPT that I
buy a round of rubber for the house!
