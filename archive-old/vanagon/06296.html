Subject: Re: fishing lore

&gt;Actually, the description of noodlin' was nearly correct (sans alcohol). Here
&gt;in KY, there is a season for NOODLING as well as TICKLING.


TICKLING:  an old Scottish tradition too, lieing on your belly over the 
banks of a suitable salmon stream (catfish indeed!) you verrry slowly put 
your hands under a resting salmon, as if to tickle its belly. Once in place 
you whip the sucker out of the water in your bare hands. At least, that's 
the myth of it.
Judging by the snapping turtle story I think I'll see if anyone wants to go 
bobbing for lampreys, this being near Halloween and all.   tim s.
