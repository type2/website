In keeping with my personal philosophy of &quot;share what you know, and help one
another&quot; ( and it appears that Bob has helped many of us one way or another,
one time or another)  - although Bob hasn't (to my knowledge)  asked any of us
publicly ---do any of us have anything that we could perhaps FedEx to Bob to
help him out, for example a shifter plate, or perhaps the loan of some some
tools that might help him, or to locate some brake or rear wheel parts that it
appears he is going to need ?

Bob- I live in Santa Clara/San Jose area about 45 miles south of San Francisco
- if you have some specific items that might be available from some of the
parts suppliers around here (INTEX, Auto Parts Club even, God forbid, a local
VW dealer)  I'd be more than happy to call them and inquire price and
availability and pass on that info to you and find a way to try to get them to
you via FedEx or something.  You'd have to be pretty specific on what item,
year and model, I really don't know much about early a/c vans, but am willing
to phone around for you (there are also some VW and European wrecking yards
around San Jose that might have some stuff).

Harvey
