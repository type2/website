Subject: '81 Westfalia camper questions

I have just gone from being a wannabus person to a vanagon person!  My
husband and I just bought an '81 vanagon camper with about 130,000 miles on
it.  I would love to get some info from those of you in the know.  Please
post the answers if you know them or email directly to me!

1) The odometer is apparently &quot;sticking&quot; - it still rolls over, but not
incredibly accuartely.  Has anyone had this probem?  Does anyone know a
soloution?

2) The fuel level sensor isn't working (in combination with the odometer
this is a real problem).  Again, does anyone know how to fix it?

3) Where can you order replacement parts for the camping stuff?  We need a
replacement front table and back window screen.

4)  How do you fix/replace a rotting window screen in the pop-top?  Can you
buy replacement screens for the windows near the back seat?

5)  The van came with the original manuals and a &quot;Haynes&quot; manual.  Is this
a good one to use?  Can we do repairs ourselves with this manual?

6)  We are in Orange County (Irvine) can anyone reccomend a good mechanic
in the area?  A good junkyard/salvage place where we might get spare parts
for cheap?

I guess that's enough questions for now.  Thanks in advance for anyone who
answers this post.
