&gt;&gt; Mercedes 207D (Westfalia camper), 1984, 5 Spd., 40K Kms, 7 pass,
&gt;&gt; sleeps 4 adults, exc. cond.  Never winter driven, very rare. $42,900
&gt;&gt; neg.  (514)-533-5535
&gt;&gt; Has anyone seem one of these things?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Yes, I have.  A fellow here at the University of Tornto has
&gt;one.  He gave me a tour a couple of years ago, and I was
&gt;very impressed.  (Of course, I'm kinda impressionable.)
&gt;The 207D had a washroom, with a shower, like a big RV!
                          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Uh-oh... that sound you just heard, was /martha blasting off for Canada
on the first available missile.
