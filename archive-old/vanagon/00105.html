&gt; well ... there goes the theory about no sliding windows. so what the heck
&gt; is a Kombi? the name has been around since the split-window buses. surely it
&gt; means something (otherwise why not call them all 'Kombi', and not Transporter).

 I thought it was the German for &quot;Station wagon&quot; (or &quot;Estate&quot; in the UK), this
is the translation given in the Aircooled FAQ from r.a.vw, anyway:

Kombi = Station Wagon
Kaefer = Insect
Kubelwagen = &quot;bucket car&quot;

 etc.

 My understanding is that it is a type designator rather than a trim level.

 The Caravelles were higher-spec. buses in the UK, I think some were used for
aftermarket conversions as well so there are, I think, Camper-Caravelles as
well as buses.

Cheers,
        W.
