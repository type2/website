&gt;&gt; We don't acknowledge T3s (Vanagons).  I don't know 
&gt;why.

&gt;Pretty ballsy statement considering this is the vanagon 
&gt;mailing list ;)

Yeah, I apologise.  But you must realise that (nearly) all 
vehicles over here are workhorses.  People who drive T3s have 
no respect for them.  They are abused and neglected.  All the 
T2s are being restored and lots of the T4s wear alloys (like 
mine) and nice paint-jobs for their businesses (not like mine.)

It wasn't an insult, people.  Just a statement of fact. :P

*** Ennis, Ireland.  A weird place to live.  *** Viva the 
Bushrats!    ***   Go Dale, #3!  *** Please don't post anymore 
about crashing.  *** I've written off 2 new Jettas three 
different times...
