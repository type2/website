&gt; They're just jealous, Tim, 'cause they can't have one too.

Yeah.  It's fun to tweak folks' gain knobs once in a while (hell, I like a
little fun poked at me from time to time... keeps my humor muscles in

rather than taking the time to respond with a good ol' fashioned RETORT,
that I lose interest...

however, I do apologize about the non-VW content.
