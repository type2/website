Subject: Re: QE: Cylinder head temp.

&gt; I have just bought a 1980 Vanagon with a fairly new 2.0l (120cu in) 
&gt; engine. One of the previous owners has installed a cylinder head 
&gt; temperature gauge (wonder why?!?).

One way of keeping track of the oil temperature, probably.

&gt; 
&gt; Here my question: can anybody tell me what the normal and the maximum 
&gt; reading should be (the gauge is in Fahrenheit - unfortunately!).

I can't offhand, but I'll check the manual when I get home tonight.

&gt; 
&gt; Another question: I tried to unscrew the transmission fluid inspection 
&gt; and refill plug - with my limited equipment without any success. Does 
&gt; anybody have another idea besides the garage around the corner...

You don't state what it looks like and I can't remember.  If it's like the
older Rabbits it's a 17mm allen.  I had to go and buy one.  The few times 
I've used it it's made the job painless (as opposed to driving it around
with a chisel and hammer, which I don't suggest.  Unless you want to go
and buy a new plug from the dealer after the 3rd or 4th time).
