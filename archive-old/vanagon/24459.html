Subject: shift rod assembly changes
Date: Fri, 08 Sep 1995 23:27:30 -0600
From: Dieter Dworkin Muller &lt;dworkin_at_village_dot_org&gt;


How much did the shifting assembly (primarily the rods going back to
the transmission) change between, say, 1957 and 1960?  My project
microbus, the Wombat ('58 station wagon style), currently has a very
wrong assembly in it, apparently from '65 or so.  Before I go digging
through the junk yard, I'd like to know how close I have to be on
model years to know I'm getting the right assembly.

Any help will be greatly appreciated.
