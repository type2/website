Subject: Re: Roof-racks for Westfalia



I used the Yakima gutter mounts to put Yakima racks on my Westy.  They 
work very well, one note though, the weight capacity is less than the 
average rack system mounted on the steel gutters.  Nonetheless, I have 
carried up to 2 bikes and 4 surfboards at once with no problem.  I don't 
know how much your canoe weighs, but I think the Yakima Co. spec'd this 
mounting system at 75lbs or less (I always figured if anything up there 
failed it would be the poptop latch).

&gt; &gt;I own a 1984 Westfalia. It has the fiberglass pop-up top. I would like
&gt; &gt;to carry a canoe on the roof. Problem: I can't find any clamp-on roof
&gt; &gt;racks for this model. Anybody know where this item is available? Any
&gt; &gt;other ideas about how to carry a canoe on the roof?

&gt; Yakima makes a hi - rise toploader rack w/ &quot;fake raingutters&quot; that bolt to
&gt; fiberglass.
