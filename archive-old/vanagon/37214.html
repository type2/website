Subject: re: Vanagon Curtains

My wife made some curtains for our '87 and to put them up I got a 
few more of those plastic coatracks that screw in from the dealer.
I installed them so each window has one on either side, and thread 
a bungee cord-with hooks- through the curtains. Hook the bungee to 
the coatracks and you're set. Although I didn't, you could do the 
same at the bottom, too. It's cheap, and doesn't look bad if you 
don't have the curtains up all the time.
