Subject: Re: Stats and glow plugs. (fast glow plugs)


I did this on my old bunker-burning-bunny - V1978.  There was 
a &quot;fast glow plug kit&quot; that VW sold at one time.  
There is MORE to change than the plugs.  The
other required part(s) involved at least a new relay 
(probably time delay with a different value).

 &gt;&gt;From P.J.Kenny
 &gt;&amp;&amp;Well, I haven't a *clue* what a glow plug looks like - or where
 &gt;&amp;&amp;the lil' critters reside in the engine bay.  My friend said
 &gt;&amp;&amp;that a plug costs around fifteen pounds apiece and that I may
 &gt;&amp;&amp;have to replace only the faulty ones.
 &gt;
 &gt;I paid approx. us$13 for each of the &quot;fast&quot; plugs--see, there are fast &amp; 
 &gt;slow, recognizable by the color of the ring--this can be seen from the 
 &gt;outside, it's right where the &quot;glow plug bus bar&quot; connects to the glow 
 &gt;plug.  (Bentley sez:  replace 'em at 60K (mi))Fast=silver; Slow=brass.
 &gt;The FLAPS/FLARS said no price diff, so I bought fast ones.
 &gt;(Then I discovered that my glow plug in-line fuse was the 
 &gt;problem--located underneath a little plastic cover; directly in-line 
 &gt;with the large red wire which gives power to &quot;glow plug bus bar&quot;).
 &gt;
 &gt;The glow plug slightly resembles a spark plug from the outside; the 
 &gt;inside part is a small (2-3cm) carbon tip, which when power is applied, 
 &gt;glows.  
 &gt;
 &gt;You'll find your glow plugs directly underneath the injectors, which you 
 &gt;(or the mechanic) must remove to access them.  (Bentley sez:  get new 
 &gt;injector heat shields when removing/reinstalling injectors)  
 &gt;
 &gt;I temporarily obviated the problem by plugging in my block heater; yet 
 &gt;after spending $50+ and realizing I only needed to spend $0.70...sheesh! 
 &gt;(at least I now have 'em!)
