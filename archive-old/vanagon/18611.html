&gt; the rear of the bus, front seat frames present, 3-spoke banjo

&gt; is a tranny hanging in it, as to it's origionality who knows?
&gt; Whole thing is mucho rough and probably not near rebuildable
&gt; at any cost, I didn't check to see if any lights/signals were
&gt; present, didn't think about it, if anyone has any needs, mail
&gt; me with specifics and I'll go check it out.

This might actually be EXACTLY what I'm looking for.  What I want is just 
the very front end of a micro-bus.  I know I'll sound REALLY stringe (but 
around here maybe no-one will notice)

I want to cut off just enough of an old bus to hang it on my wall.  I 
could but safari style windows in and have a display case.  I'd probabaly 
want to make headlights and turn signals work (at low wattage).

-----------------------------

I wouldn't want to cut up a bus that was in too good a shape to do this - 
cardinal sin you know.

And buying new nose skins and parts is WAY too expensive.

If anybody else listening in knows another way I could get such a thing 
I'd appreciate any assistance.
