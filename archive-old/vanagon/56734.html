Subject: AC question

On a hot day last summer the pressure relief valve on my AC dryer gave
out.  When it goes out it makes a startling noise and sight,
particularly when your standing right next to it.  I replaced the dryer
assembly and expansion valve with only one problem. The old dryer was
not marked as to the direction of flow of freon through the hoses.  The
new dryer will fit on in both direction. The van is a 1987 Wolfsburg
with 2.1? gas engine.  The one with the AC ducts that swing down and
smack you in the back on the head when you hit a good bump.
  1. Can someone please tell me the direction of flow for dryer 
assembly?
  2. The goof I asked to check out the AC said that dryer pop off
valves 	sometimes wear out.   I don't think I buy that one!  There
must         be an under lying cause for the pressure to build up.
  3. My vanagon has never indicated that it was hot.  But I have
noticed 	that the cooling cycle is different than it used to be.  Now 
the fan only runs for 15 sec at a time.  It may run several 		times, but
for only 15 sec. 	Is that a two stage system?   
I guess it's off to the money suckers if I can not figure this one out.
Thank you for any suggestions.
