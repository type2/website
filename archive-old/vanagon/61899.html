Hello all...

I would like to thank everyone who responded to my posting 'Syncro 
Starter Woes' of about three weeks ago.  Everyone was most helpful and 
considerate.  I did not yet have a Bentley Manual and things looked 
rather dim.

Now it is off and rebuilt and back on again.  It was MUCH easier to 
install than to remove.  I did need to remove the right rear axel and the 
lockout switch.  Even then, it took LOTS of juggling, twisting and 
turning to convince the starter that it needed to be removed.  Locally 
(in Nebraska) the only rebuilt Bosch starters available were $215.00 so I 
had ours rebuilt.  The starter was in pretty good shape, but the solenoid 
was shot.  Cost was 85.00 including 15.00 overnight shipping to get a new 
solenoid from Texas.

I now have a follow-up question:  Why is the stud on the solenoid so 
long?  The connector on the wire from the alternator is about 13mm or so 
long and of course the stud needs to be long enough to receive this plus 
the connector from the battery.  But why SO long.  I don't understand why 
the connector from the alternator is that big.  Any enlightenment will be 
most appreciated.

TIA
Peace,

Sean and Susan
