&gt; Hi All
&gt; 
&gt; I'm trying to locate some info on the web, on how to build things in fiberglass.
&gt; The idea is, to replace some of the body plats whit fiberglass.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyone have any info, please email me. 
&gt; 
&gt; Ps. At the moment I'm in the process of doing some rust job on my camper,
&gt; and I feel that some of the places can be replaced by fiberglass. 

For info on how to make big pieces in fiberglass look for books on
bouat building in your library. You need to make a mold, and learn
some tricks with &quot;release agents&quot; and other special chemicals.
You could also ask on the newsgroup rec.boats.building.

For smaller repair it is sometimes easier to make the mold directly
on the van. For tricky details I've successfully used window chaulking
putty (foensterkitt). I just stick it to the metal and form it to
the required shape by hand. It scrapes off easily when the resin has
cured. (Note this only works for small details! There is no rigidity in 
the putty to hold the shape for a large piece)

Bob has written some notes on this also. See his sermons:

I have some general info on chemicals and paints for rust repair:
