&gt;Hi all, new subscriber here. I need to get all the window
&gt;seal replaced (and some body work done) on my '66 bus.
&gt;Sigh, I know it's gonna cost me...does anyone have tips on
&gt;where to get the seals cheap? I've found a good, reasonably
&gt;priced body shop to do the work.

West Coast metric makes all sorts of seals.  All of the mail order places
sell them, but they seem to be cheaper at WCM.  They also have kits,
fro various diiferent body kombos, and can put kits together for your
specific needs.
