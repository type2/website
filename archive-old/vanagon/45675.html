Subject: New 009 dist


I just installed a 009 distributor in my '74 Bus.  It seems to have
helped, but it lacks power.  I know alot of people on this lest have 009's
in their vans, so any advice would be appreciated.  I have the idle turned
almost all the way in, yet it still idles at nearly 1000 rpm.  It didn't
do this before the distributor swap, so I'm sure there is some connection.
All other electrical parts are new, including plug wires, coil and of
course cap and rotor.

Thanks,

Craig

PS No directions came with the distributor for timing-I set it to 8
degrees before.  Is this ok?
