Subject: Re: What has happened to gasoline prices?

Well folks,
  I guess there IS one benefit of being auto-less while Patience is 
undergoing a slow fix-up in my driveway...my bicycle gets extraordinary 
miles per gallon.  Still, I sure wish I could burn some gas (drive) on 
those cold rainy days.   It won't be long!  I have learned to do (and
despise) CV joint work in the past week.  What a mess.

Gas in Auburn has gone up around 20 cents in the past three-four weeks.  
Isn't it curious how oil companies are always very quick to &quot;adjust&quot; 
prices upward, but very cautious about lowering them too quickly.  
....Similar to banks and changes in interest rates.
  
Greg
