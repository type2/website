&gt;
&gt;Kenyon,
&gt;
&gt;You said:
&gt;
&gt;I do think we have to be clear on the difference in requirements of the
&gt;Vanagon vs. Westy vs. Syncro vs. Syncro Westy. 
&gt;
&gt;I agree! The syncro Westie is heavier, but that is why I mentioned the 
&gt;'90 Carat sticker that I happened to check last weekend. It also specified
&gt;&quot;97&quot;
&gt;and I am sure it weighs less than your  new Westie.
&gt;
&gt;Why would VW spec out and use Michelin MVX radials of the 205 70/R14
&gt;
&gt;The 205 70/R14s  is cited on the '90 Carat sticker as being &quot;Reinforced&quot;
&gt;and having the 97 rating. Michelin could have made two tires  in the same 
&gt;physical size and &quot;line&quot;, one with a higher load rating than the other.
&gt;
&gt;I'm not trying to be a pill, but since I had just looked at the Carat
&gt;sticker,
&gt;it seemed to me likely that your new Westie will also specify &quot;97&quot; for the
&gt;load rating. Somehow, the computers in the tire store miss these details :-(.
&gt;
&gt;Can you call and have someone look at the sticker for you? Thats what I
&gt;did when  I bought my SW in Oregon and had Tire Rack ship tires out before we
&gt;picked it up to drive home to Maryland.
&gt;
&gt;Another option would be to ask anyone on the list with the same Westie to go
&gt;out
&gt;and look at theirs for you.
&gt;
&gt;Good luck,
&gt;
&gt;Tom F.
&gt;
&gt;
