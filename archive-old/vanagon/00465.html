Subject: Towing capabilities


Does anyone have an idea of the towing capacity of a manual transmission 
'86 vanagon?  I'm considering getting a small sailboat, and that may 
depend on whether I can retrofit the vanagon for towing. I have a friend 
who has an '84 vanagon fitted with a Jetta engine, and he seems to do ok 
towing his sand rail.  Opinions?
