Rob:

Well the first thing I did to solve the problem w/ lighting the fridge was
search all tyhe variousarchives &amp; web pages for info (and there's lot!!) for
techniques.

People have tried everything from aping on the pump/gas button to ripping
out the fridge &amp; cleaning etc. Beleive me I tried EVERYTHING, and was about
to rip out the fridge (my last hope), when I ran across a few posts about
folks using blow tubes &amp; bicycle pumps attached to the drain pipe as a means
to put fresh air into the cumbustion chamber. Other similar messages pointed
to the fact that the problem w/ these fridges isn't normally getting enough
gas but rather fresh air into the chamber so the flame can light.

With that I sought out a means to pump some air in there (hey a rhyme!!).
The only thing I had was one of those small tire compressors that you plug
into a cigarete lighter. I had a plastic cone like attachment (for blowing
up rafts and such), which fit perfectly into the drain pipe. 

I think my fridge must hve had some gunk or accumulation in the chamber from
non use, and it took a few tries to get it going. But once I was able to
keep the flame lit it kept geting easier and easier to light the fridge.
Yesterday I got it running w/ ONE pump on the pumper, a short blast of gas
and bingo off it goes!

I also tested it on the road and it burned all day yesterday while I cruised
around.

So I guess the moral of the story is try everything, kbe patient, and quit
when you get frustrated. By thinking on it over night I kept making forward
advances and ultimately avoided lots of labor &amp; hassles ripping the fridge
out.

Hope this helps!!

&gt; Hi Bill,
&gt;    I'm interested in what you had to do to get the fridge going. I've been
&gt; buss'in for many years but haven't ever had a Westie. I'm getting the bug
&gt; and am collecting info on the &quot;Little Things&quot; that go with one.
&gt; Thanks,

&gt; &gt;let me know..
