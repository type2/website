&gt;How about a dustbuster?
&gt;    - martha rubin

nah. that's what you call those GM sloop-nosed jobbers, the Silhouette, etc.
they look MUCH more like a Dustbuster than the eurovan does.

&gt;Try &quot;Kaiser Roll&quot;.
&gt;    - joshua poulson

hmmmmm. yeah. even the nationality fits.  kaiser rolls, at least in alabama,
are quite a bit fatter sideways, though.

anyhoo, i've been busying my widdle bwain about this (slow day at flat rock)
and the closest thing i can think of that resembles the eurovan (and vice
versa) is either a camping/hiking boot or baby shoes.

but if you call it 'das Boot', that means a boat, and usually a submarine.

so maybe the Shoe?  Shoo-Shoo Baby?  i can't remember how to spell shoe in
german. and it really isn't just a 'shoe' but a particular kind of shoe/boot.
almost like a fat nike/rebok yuppie shoe. ;)

&lt;boy. ric is gonna pop his cork enny minute now ... :)     &gt;
