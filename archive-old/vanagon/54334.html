&gt; I shut the engine and checked the fluid and the pump belt which both

&gt; overheating so I decided (since I was already late) to drive to work.
&gt; The entire way the Temp LED kept flashing although the engine was not
&gt; overheating.
&gt;=20
&gt; When I got to work, I shut the engine, waited a minute and started the
&gt; engine again. This time the Temp LED stopped flashing.

&gt; Has anyone else experienced this problem? Could there be air in the coo=

&gt;=20
&gt; Help would be very much appreciated...

Hi all: I had a similar problem with my 85 westy but it also affected my
gas guage and the temp guage, I think(this happened quite awhile back).
The problem was a little electronic gadget that looked like a diode or
something, in the dash that the vw mechanic called a vibrator. He seemed
to think it was a common problem. Maybe someone can elaborate.=20
