Subject: RE:  Carpet availability

Auto-Mat   516/938-7373
&gt;
&gt;Carpet set:   (includes everything, it woulds seem, looking at the 
&gt;diagram...)
&gt;Bus/Transporter: $350-$900, depending on nylon or wool, or several 
&gt;in-between)
&gt;Vanagon (less cargo mat): $400-960, depending....
&gt;Vanagon Cargo mat: $80-$195

See your nearest junkyard fast!!
At $195/rear deck carpet that's over $100/square yard.  Go to the best
carpet place in town and tell'em what you want. It would be cheaper, edges
neatly bound, hell they'd throw in the underpad and install it for that
price, Scoth-Guarded no less I bet.  Tim Smith

ps: a 5' x 10' remnant very nicely fills a vanagon, rear hatch to seat
backs.  I used to have an empty panel vanagon, did this once in a light gray
nylon. lasted years, worked fine, dragged it out and hosed/scrubbed it clean
annually. Use the metal door sill to hold it down tightly by sliding door.
Seat belt anchors/heater hold it onto firewall.
