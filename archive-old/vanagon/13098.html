Subject: Re: Lousy idle and 009 dist.

&gt;This is a tardy reply to Chris Bridges' post on bad idle with 009.
&gt;
&gt;If I remember all the details correctly, this is a '71 bus or at least the 
&gt;carb is from a '71, right? The '71 stock distributor had a two hose vacuum 
&gt;diaphragm which, in conjunction with drillings in the carb, retarded the 
&gt;timing at idle substantially, to 5 degrees AFTER top dead center. The nominal
&gt;static setting &lt;engine off&gt; is 7.5 degrees BEFORE top dead center. While I 
&gt;would still look carefully for a vacuum leak, keep in mind that the idle with
&gt;the 009 will never be real good with the stock carb. The jetting is based on 
&gt;the assumption that the timing will be retarded at idle. If you still have the
&gt;stock distributor, I would put it back in. It has both mechanical and vacuum
&gt;advance and will improve your gas mileage over the mechanical advance only
&gt;009. 
&gt;
&gt;I messed around with a similar set-up on my '72 bus. Without  the vacuum 
&gt;retard at idle connected, the idle was rough and it had a flat spot just
&gt;off idle. With everything in good condition and hooked up the way the
&gt;engineers at VW  had intended was when it ran it's best. Idle problems with
&gt;the stock set up usually turned out to be rubber hoses or elbows with cracks
&gt;in them, electrical problems, and in one case - a leaky brake booster.
&gt;
&gt;Good luck, Chris!

Thanks to all.  It has been running better, although a little hot.  I had 
timed it statically to 7.5 before TDC, and ran it for quite a while here.  
Absolutely will not idle though.  I was in Blacksburg getting parts, and 
thought I would retard it a little, so I put it at 5 degrees BTDC, and it 
will idle here and still runs well, and a little cooler.  I think that the 
009 might advance the spark more than the stock setup.  This just further 
proves what Dave has said, that the timing needs to be retarded at idle.  
The stock distributor is in really rough shape, (the point plate doesn't 
even move!) but I will clean it up this afternoon.  Thanks to Dave Black for 
the idle screw settings.  To James Brill, no I haven't setup the Throttle 
valve postioner.  I don't think I will.  I have come to believe that simple 
is better.  

I have come to these conclusions:
1) Get a different carb, and use the 009.
 
2) If you have a 34 PICT-3, you must use a vacum retard distributor.

I have seen a adaptor that lets you use a 30 pict carb on a dual port 
manifold, and believe it or not, he too was using a 009.  This engine idled 
really well. 
I'll keep you posted.
Thanks again.
