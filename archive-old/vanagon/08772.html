I have just a couple of thoughts on this.  This harness, for $100:  
can you make one of these?  Seems to me from the description that it 
replaces an existing harness, possibly with a larger gauge wire (?), 
and might add one connection, all in attempt to stablize current 
across these systems.  Seems to me that with the right connectors and 
some wire you could make one of these.  Anyone?
