B.-
I'm not trying to sell ethics to anyone.  The intention of my post was
simply to bring about the awareness that per unit of power, a lawn
mower engine pumps far more CO, NOx, and VOCs into the atmosphere
than even an old VW engine due to incomplete combustion.  Even not
considering the power/emissions ratio, a lawnmower engine pollutes far
more than many vehicles on the road today.  I don't have the actual
figures at the moment, but it's quite staggering.  I guess I could have
worded the original post differently.

You raise some interesting ethical questions about many &quot;problems&quot;
beyond the scope of my post, but being new here I don't know if (and
don't think) this is the proper forum for discussion.  

Good spirit,
Matthew

the goal (green world for our children), but we could sure have some
interesting discussion about where the line should be drawn.  How many
of the following can we really justify?
. airconditioning in ANY car
. taking vacations in privately owned vehicles
. mowing lawns with gas powered tools
. more than Diesel Vanagon power in ANY car
. speed limits over 55; 45; 25; horsedrawn speed; walk speed
. eating more than 2000 calories a day
. taking vacations
. educating my child instead of feeding yours
. ad infinitum

&gt;Wherever the solution starts, I don't think that running a lawnmower
engine for a few hundred hours, in order to keep a much-loved VW bus
from being replaced by a newly-smelted Econobore, with air, is the
problem.

&gt;Note not a flame, Matt -- I'm always eager to see how other people get
ethics and logic to fit together.
