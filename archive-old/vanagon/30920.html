Subject: /f Re: dashboard alters

Whip out your communicator, get Mr. Scott on the horn and order him to send a brace of photon torpedoes your way -- clears up almost any ill.

&gt;I'm altering my dashboard -- so far I have used a crowbar and a variable
&gt;temperature soldering iron. Lately I have switched to a pitchfork and find I
&gt;can get superior traction. Now that it's altered I realize that like all VW
&gt;work, I should have asked for divine intervention before I lifted my first
&gt;tool.
&gt;
&gt;Cheers -- Rob the job
