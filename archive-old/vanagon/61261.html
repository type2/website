&gt;I have an 82 Vanagon Westfalia.  The door sticker says the GVW is 2250 
&gt;kg.
&gt;
&gt;How can I tell what amount of cargo weight I can safely add to the 
&gt;bus?
&gt;
&gt;Any ideas on what problems would be caused by exceeding the weight 
&gt;limit by
&gt;say: 10% or 20%.  This would only be for a 2-3 highway drive over good 
&gt;roads.
