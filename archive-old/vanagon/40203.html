Subject:      93 EV MV still for sale ...

that 1993 VW Euro Van MV &lt;sic&gt; is still being advertised in Birmingham, AL:

1993 VW Euro Van MV
all power, F &amp; R, ac &amp; heat, table, 4 capt. chairs ... $14,995
Wayne Gargus Pontiac, Inc.
I-59 at Exit 120
(800) 239-2671
(205) 781-9736

&lt;when i looked at it last month or so ... it was teal blue, seemed to be in
pretty good shape (used, but not abused), and i think had about 40,000 miles.
and the salesman said they'd probably take $12,000 for it. it's a 5-speed&gt;
