Sorry to bother the list with this, but my reply directly to Fred bounced. 
 I can't seem to send stuff to folks that have &quot;%&quot; in their addresses. 
 Perhaps someone with a stronger mailer can forward this to him since he 
isn't reading the list.

Subject: 	RE: Q's about your cruise control installation

Fred,

1) It sounds like the Equus is a descendant of the cruise which I like
   best.  I have an AudioVox, not yet installed, that matches your
   description.  I have compared the hardware from the AudioVox with my
   older cruises and it is an indisputable match.  I suspect that Equus
   is just another re-brand.

   In my experience, this cruise is the best that I have ever installed.
   It is the one that I installed on my '72 and '84 busses.

2) I don't have the AudioVox instructions available to me here at work,
   so I can't comment on the ignition component warning.  I am an
   electrical engineer and I would take that warning with a grain of
   salt.  If radiation from your ignition system can affect the cruise at
   more than a few inches, you have an ignition wiring problem.  In other
   words, your AM radio won't work either for the noise either.  If you
   have a problem with the cruise being erratic that you suspect is
   ignition noise, the unit can be shielded with a piece of aluminum
   foil.  If that fixes the problem, then the permanent fix is new noise
   suppresser ignition wires.

   My bus installations were for a split unit ... servo and electronics
   in separate boxes.  I don't recall any ignition warning in my later
   single unit installations, but the one on my '88 Mazda is about 8
   inches from the coil.

   In my '72, I put the servo under the floor near the gas pedal and let
   it pull the throttle cable.  My '84 is much more conventional with the
   servo above the exhaust heat shield with a gentle 180 degree curve to
   the throttle body.

3) I ran the control wires through the firewall and under the carpeting
   up the left side of the bus.  The situation may be different in Westy.

4) I don't recall the specific vacuum line.  However, it should be in the
   vicinity of the brake boost line.  In other words, closer to the
   engine than the throttle valve.

5) I have never needed any 'vacuum booster' with this type of cruise.
   The cruise holds full throttle on hills steep enough for the bus not
   to hold cruise speed.

6) As I mentioned above, I don't believe that electromagnetic
   interference is an issue.  In the worst case, a metal shield could
   be installed.  This balanced against the fact that the control cable
   should only have gentle bends suggest that you would be better off
   keeping the servo in the engine compartment.

Mike
