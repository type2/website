Subject: Syncro tire differences

Jim's comment on buying five new tires for syncros and the recent comments
by another member about never allowing a syncro to be put on a dynamometer
have me wondering.

How long (miles) can/should one run a syncro when a spare is used which is
not as worn as the other tires?

Thanks,
Don
