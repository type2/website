Subject: Need replacement drain cap for Westfalia water tank
Date: Mon, 12 May 97 12:11:00 EDT


This is very strange:

At some point in the past couple of weeks, the drain plug on my water   
tank has cracked.  There's no way that I tightened it too much because I   
didn't even know that the tank had a drain cap until this past weekend,   
when I noticed a stream of water while filling up the tank.  Two weeks   
ago I drained the non-toxic antifreeze from the system (as always, by   
running it through the lines), flushed the system and left the tank dry.   
 The cap was fine then because  the tank had been holding the antifreeze   
all winter.  I haven't scraped the bottom of the van at any point in the   
last two weeks, so I've no idea how this could have happened.

Anyway, does anyone know where I can get a replacement cap?  Owasco VW in   
Whitby Ontario says that the cap is sold as part of an assembly. which   
includes the threaded drain piece that attaches to the bottom of the   
tank, but they want $99 Canadian for the assembly!  Seems like a lot to   
pay when all I need is a stooopid piece of plastic with a rubber plug in   
it.
