Subject: Vanagon Pop-Top Conversion Experiences

Hello everyone,

I recently bought a &quot;shell&quot; of a '91 Vanagon MultiVan and I
am considering using the interior and pop-top to convert
our '87 Syncro into a MultiVan.

I am wondering if anyone has experience with installing a
Westfalia pop-top on a Vanagon and what they would do
different the next time.

Please respond to the list.

Thanks in advance.

Kevin Disse

91 GTI (original 8 valve)
81 Rabbit Pickup (Turbo Diesel conversion)
85 Audi 4000S Quattro (original everything with 196,000 miles)
87 Honda Prelude Si (my wife just won't give it up after driving it for 135,000 miles)
