I'm wondering here too where is the turbo positioned, off the end
of the place the front and rear manifold come together? although
obvious you got to have an oil drain significantly lower than the
turbo for long life, and this turbo water cooled? problably not, again
old tech.  A lot of money for some estra HP.
