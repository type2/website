Subject: 1.9 L TD swap. Just to clarify a point
Date: Sun, 10 Aug 1997 09:10:11 -0700

Thanks to all those who've shown interest in my 1.6L diesel to 1.9L TD
engine swap. In order to clarify a point, I post this again. The engine I'm
puting in is NOT a 1.9l TDI, it's a 1.9L Swirl chamber Turbo diesel...Big
difference! So far, it's been a straight bolt in. The throttle linkage
needs to be slightly modified, intake air needs to be cleaned somehow, and
exaust pipe needs to head backwards, sorta. None of these things are any
big deal, just need to be addressed is all. Anyway, this week I should be
able to pop a few wheelies...I shall advise...
