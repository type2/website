Subject: Re: Tranny synthetic oil?

Gail F. asks:

&gt;are you referring to an automatic
&gt;transmission, or a manual?

Uhmm, well, as the original poster
I was inquiring with a manual trans
in mind, and I believe most of the 
responses I've received relate to
experiences w/ a manual tranny.
I'm sorry for any confusion caused
by the original question.  

Based upon several responses, though,
I believe I'm going to look more
closely at all the various synth. oil
manufacturers and see if I can separate
fact from f(r)iction.  Synth. oil
would seem the way to go, though.

Thanks to all who responded.
