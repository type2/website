Subject: AC Parts - come and getum

I just finished the AC-ectomy on my 78, and I have all the assorted bits.  

The compressor is not frozen and the clutch works
Both the big radiator things are in good shape
There is about 4 miles of hose
The console blowers blow

If anybody needs parts for their system or needs something to keep 
 there boat from drifting, the stuffs yours for the price of shipping 
 and a six pac or so.

Clay
