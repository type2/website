&lt;&lt;     Well, I have now replaced all the parts that I know of in the Fuel
 Gauge system on my 83.5 in an attempt to not take the thing to the
 dealer and his &quot;VAG&quot; tester. The gauge is still flakey, and van runs out
 of gas before gauge reads empty. No dent in tank. I have replaced
 sending unit, gauge and voltage regulator/stabilizer. Any further
 suggestions?

Here is one....figure out your &quot;new empty location on the guage&quot; and avoid
it.
Seriously, I had a '80 Westy with the same problem, despite my similar
attemps to fix it, it remaind a frustrating mystery.  I started to carry a
spare gas tank ( with gas of course ) at all times.....there is a cool one
that fits in the spare tire....think I saw it on www.vanagon_dot_com.  Good luck.
