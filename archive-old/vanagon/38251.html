Subject: Two Busses for sale in Richmond, VA

I have TWO Busses for sale in Richmond, VA.

Bus #1:  '73 Bus with automatic tranny.  VERY fresh '81 Vanagon 2.0 litre
motor with only 100 miles!  Runs great!  Body is blue with white top.  It
does have some surface rust, but no cancer.  The rocker panels were replaced
a couple of years ago.  It also has some camper interior that was installed
by a former owner.  It has the bed and the cabnets on the passenger side.
 Also has the seat immediatly behind the drivers seat that is facing the rear
of the van.  New tires, front brakes, wheel cylenders, windshield (about two
years ago).  Van has one dent behind rear bumper and right side (bumper was
replaced with another, but the replacement is not very straight) 

Price is $1,800 FIRM.  

Second van:  '71 Deluxe with sunroof.  This van needs a LOT of work.  Body is
solid.  Only bad rust in on outer rocker panels.  The quarter panels directly
behind the rockers are in great shape!  The front nose needs work.  It has
rust under the windsheild, a poorly made, home made front tire mount that
rusted a small hole into the nose.  Other than that, the body is very solid.
 Need a complete interior redo.  Comes with a single port motor and tranny.
 Van has not run since 1985!   I bought the van from a guy that had it in
storage since '85 (I bought it last year with plans to restore)  All parts
are there for this van.

Price is $400.

If interrested in either van, you can either e-mail me at VWcrazyTim_at_aol_dot_com
or call me at  (804)275-7745

I am selling the vans because a former VW has come back into the picture.  I
have wanted that car back for two years, and now I have it back!  Now,
something needs to go!


Thank you in advance,

Tim :)
