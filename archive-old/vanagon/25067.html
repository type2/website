Subject: Chick-Inn VW get-together, MI


Howdy Volks,

	here's the announcement for the drive-in greazzzy restaurant VW
meet in southeast lower Michigan this Friday!

	We're meeting at the Chick-Inn (Get it?  Get it? NyukNyuk) in
Ypsilanti, on Prospect at Holmes Rd.  It's about a mile north of Michigan
Ave.  The time to show up is 7pm.  I've never been myself, but Mark
Janello ('62 Kombi) speaks highly of the food (all fried) and dining
area (a big parking lot--year round curb service!  we don't have to leave
our cars!!!).  He says there's a big sign w/ a clock that says &quot;Time to
Eat.&quot;  Their slogan is &quot;We're a little out of the way, but a lot out of
the ordinary.&quot;  Sounds just about right.

	So, bring your VW and join the crowd!  Doesn't matter if it's
a '73 Super with rust where the floor used to be, or if it's a fully
restored 1957 Type II fire truck w/ ladder (er, if they even exist).
Just a bunch of folks enjoying their VWs, swapping stories, and having
a generally good time.  If I've got things straight, the following should
be in attendance at the very least:  '58 single cab, '62 Kombi, '65 Notch-
back, '66 Type I Ghia, '71 Sportsmobile, and '71 squareback.  (Imagine
getting that many air-cooled VWs in the same place at the same time
on a Friday evening here in the rust belt, and not a single Beetle in
their midst!  Bizarre... come join us, Lou!!!  We need Beetles!!!:)

	See you all there!  Feel free to email me if you need better
directions or any other info.

-Greg
'71 squareback
'63 Beetle

(p.s.:  If you think I have any $$$ interest in the Chick-Inn, you're
cuckoo! :)
