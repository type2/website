I really don't think the gas has anything to do with it either.  Just a
wierd coinkydink.

The clock, though...

Like I said in the just-previous post, it may be the battery contacts after
all.  That COULD explain why the clock was essentially resetting itself the
day before it died.  Maybe the voltages to/from the computer were dropping,
and it was cutting off flow to the extremities and saving the major organs
for last.  That way, the driver would be fully concious that life was
slipping away...  ew.  Sorry about that metaphor, folks!
