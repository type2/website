I had this same problem with my SAAB several years ago.  My brother-in-law
told me how to test the distributor when it quit, I wish I could remember
what I did, but I used to test light when the car stopped.  If you need me
to, I'll give him a call and ask (no email yet).  Anyway $200.00 for a new
distributor and it's been running for the last 170,000 miles.

&gt;          My little problem continues... My van still shuts off after a
&gt; short time, usually less than 45 mins. It shuts off like I've turned the
&gt; key off-no misfires, sputters nothing it just shuts down, the alternator
&gt; lights doesn't even come on till the van comes to a complete stop.
&gt;         I've replaced most of the ignition components too many to list.
&gt; recently I finally replaced the fuel filter and it ran great (as usuall)
&gt; but after 45 miles it shut down again. BTW the filter was really clogged,
&gt; Ithink I'll replace it again. As always it started up after 1 hour
&gt; intermission.
&gt;         This weekend I'm going to remove the distributor and take a look
at
&gt; the hall control unit wire that reside in the black plastic elbow and
check
&gt; them out. I'm running out of ideas. since I've taken it to two vw
shops(one
&gt; being the dealer! _at_#$%^%$##_at__at_!) and have gotten very different diagnosis.
&gt;         Are there any ideas ie. additional ground wires? exorcism etc.
&gt; All and any are appreciated.
