Subject:      Re: Luggage Racks

In a message dated 97-10-05 11:47:08 EDT, you (Warren Lail) write:

&lt;&lt;  The BIG  project I wish to undertake is a two piece roof rack.  I want
one which
 conforms to the shape of the top and which stretches from end to end
 (custom made, of course).  Do any of you know someone who is
 particularly proficient at rack-making or manufacturing?  I can provide
 drawings.  Of course, I want the rack to be strong but light, i.e., made
 of some hollow tubing of some kind.  In addition, I am thinking of
 having a ladder made to go up from the front bumper in front of the
 windshield on the passenger side.  Semi permanent mounted, I think.  Has
 anyone tried this before?
 Many thanks.

You may not need to have one custom made.  I see three alternatives to a
custom made luggage rack.

1. Purchase 2-3 sets of Thule or Yakima roof racks and accessories and you
can have a lot of flexinility in setting up a system that's right for each
trip.

2. Purchase a rack (or 2) from Conn-Ferr Manufacturing.  They make luggage
racks of all shapes &amp; sizes to mount on rain gutters like Vanagon's have.
 These are very durable, popluar, well regarded among four-wheelers.  Contact
Conn-Ferr in Burbank, CA at: (818)848-2025 or (818)848-2230 or (818)848-6993
or (213)849-1800 or FAX them at (818)848-1011.  No, I'm not affiliated with
Conn-Ferr and don't even own one.  I'm just looking at their ad in &quot;4 Wheel
Drive &amp; Sport Utility Magazine&quot;.

3. Purchase a roof rack that's already made for a Vanagon.  I have one of
these that I bought used.  VW sold them through dealers when they were still
selling Vanagons.  VW did not make them, but had someone make them to fit
Vanagons.  These have similar tube construction to ones made for earlier
buses.  I suspect these would be difficult to find.  Mine is about 1/2 the
length of the Vanagon's roof and I think they made one smaller (1/3 length)
and larger (3/4 length).

I think you'd be on your own for the ladder.  Perhaps one could be adapter
from RV use to fit the Vanagon.

Good luck,
Jim Davis
