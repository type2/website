Interesting note: The reason that I currently have the pleasure of
driving NuBus ('82 Dieseasal) is that the P.O. tried to sell the 
bus in the past, and when the Potential Owner had it &quot;inspected&quot; by a 
mechanic, the mech. swore it had a cracked block. The symptoms was the
water/oil emulsion. It turns out that, in fact, the block was NOT cracked;
some loser poured oil into the anti-freeze reservoir, which is very 
easy since they (oil and anti-freeze fill places) are right next to each 
other under the license plate.
