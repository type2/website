&gt;&gt;Also, to Mr. Wright:
&gt;&gt;Is there some guy out in the middle of nowhere that has some kind
&gt;&gt;of VW shop?  We saw one when we took Hwy92? to Council Bluffs on a bike
&gt;&gt;trip a few years ago(camped out in Indianola)

Wow.  *Mr. Wright* no less.  Makes me feel old.  Mr. Wright was my Dad...

Anyway.  Yeah, on 92 west of Indianola there was a cranky old guy named
Leonard who ran a VW shop--his favorites were Breadloaves.  I went out
there a few times, but what parts he had he never wanted to sell unless
he got to do the labor, and he was about as speedy as a sloth on lithium.
Thus, I didn't do much business with him.  He died in September, and his
widow is selling stuff off at exhorbitant prices.  There was a 78 Bus
I would have liked to get for parts, but was informed that such a purchase
might have a deleterious effect on home life unless it were stored, say,
in Creston (50+ miles away)

By the way, if you see a brown &amp; cream Bus with roof-rack &amp; Campbell for
Governor bumper-sticker in Iowa City this weekend, it's us, getting a dose
of kultchur.
