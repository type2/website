Subject: RE: Air Dam Paint 

Ed,

You might want to try Meguiar's #40 Vinyl &amp; Rubber Cleaner/Conditioner.  Works great!

Simular treatments (Back to Black, Black Chrome &amp; Black Again) seem to work well, at first.  
But they seem to leave a film that attracts dirt and the finish does not last as long.
