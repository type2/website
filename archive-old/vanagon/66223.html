Subject:      '87  Syncro Westy Transmission failure-HELP!!

Howdy gang... I could really use some advice....

I was driving my 87 syncro westy home the other day.. about an hour
of highway driving. I came off the highway and stopped at a light.
When the light turned green I went to shift into first (I was in
third with clutch depressed), I couldn't get the shift out of gear
and into first. There was no noise, grinding, smoke, apparitions or
anything.. just no action. After causing a significant back up on a
NJ highway, I finally was able to get the van out of gear and
drifting downhill. Somehow I was able to coast to a supermarket
parking lot. I didn't bother trying anything else on that day.
Flatbed tow see ya!

Here's what I've observed since. I can shift into all gears with the
clutch depressed, but when I release the clutch, it seems as if the
transmission is jammed.. I can release the clutch and the engine
seems to take some load but no movement whatsoever. True in any gear
including reverse. Ultimately with the clutch released it will just
stall out if I let it go that far.

So I seek your advice.. do you think it is:

A) Related to the transmission and if so is it likely to be a major
problem or minor problem (its a syncro so I don't think there's
anything that's a minor problem!!).

B) Related to the clutch, including but not limited to the pressure
plate or master/slave units (note: I checked the brake fluid
reservoir behind the insturment panel and it is full).

C) Both A&amp; B!!

Seriously I really could use some advice as to what to do. The van is
laid up and I am desperate to correct the problem and get it back on
the road.

Thanks in advance!!
