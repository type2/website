Subject: RE: PC Gamesmanship


&gt; &gt;&gt; physically challanged people.
&gt; &gt;&gt; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
&gt; &gt;&gt; My, how PC.  Who am I to buck this ever-so-benificent trend?
&gt;
&gt;I can't think that there is a problem with referring to folks in the way
&gt;that they have become accustomed to being referred.

Neither do I, which is why I find these PC attempts to make up new names
for them so silly.

So do they, BTW-- Groups of handicapped that I worked with, refer to
themselves as &quot;crips&quot;-- short for &quot;cripples&quot;, obviously. They are the
coolest, most positive, upbeat people I have ever run into. They laugh
and joke about their physical problems, when they  bother to refer to
them at all, and spend a fair amount of time trying to cheer up people
who feel sorry for them. They've got it down to a science.

Half of them ignore descriptions such as &quot;Physically challenged&quot;. The
rest smirk at the names, and a few consider them patronizing, and dismiss
them with the derision they deserve. They evidently feel they can handle
the &quot;stress&quot; of being called what they are, rather than suffer the 
attentions
of well-meaning but seriously tolerance-impaired, self-appointed
do-gooders. (Do I get the longest-silly-name award now?) If they couldn't
handle such, THEN they would have a problem. But they are normal people,
with normal wisdom and understanding. And that's all they need to deal
with their condition. Perhaps we should all take a lesson?


Face it, guys, Political Correctness is a solution in search of a problem.
&quot;Handicapped&quot; is not a derogatory term, any more than &quot;caucasian&quot;, or
&quot;tall&quot;, or &quot;short&quot;. They are merely accurate. If someone has a problem with
them, _they_ are the ones who are wrong, aren't they. Fortunately, very few
do-- and most of those, aren't even the ones to whom the terms are applied.


&gt;If the people up in Detroit Lakes prefer this terminology

A big &quot;if&quot;.


&gt;what exactly is *wrong* with it?

Nothing. Who said there was? I _joked_ about it, remember? And then referred
only to automobiles afterward, not people-- a fact you were careful to
cut out. Humor-- a new concept: Try it, you'll like it. And no one else will
mind. Really.

  I
&gt;hate to see the list denegrated by this sort of mean-spirited humor.

To which you respond with mean spirit WITHOUT humor. Lighten up! Everyone
else does... especially the handicapped you profess to be so worried about,
but obviously know so little of.


&gt;I am hard pressed to know what to think.

Won't touch that one...   :^)


&gt;The fact of the matter is that very few groups apply such
&gt;terminology to themselves.

The handicapped groups I've known, do. How many have you dealt with?



&gt;Gee, Steve, why don't you just call me &quot;faggot?&quot;

Are you one?

I love these attempts to put words in my mouth-- it's a blast making
fun of them, and soooo appropriate.



Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention, please???

I started this thread for the purpose of making up silly &quot;PC-like&quot; names
for VOLKSWAGENS.  BUSES, to be exact. You know... the slow, noisy,
air-cooled vehicles most of us drive? And, the subject of this list???
Next thing I know, there's this flame war about a totally irrelevant
subject, in defense of people who have not been attacked in any way,
and who regard the Speech Police with even more contempt than most of
the rest of us.

You want to talk politics/philosophy/PoliticalConfusedness with me,
feel free. My .sig is, and always has been, at the end of every post.
I'll reply privately, if/when I have time, and you have my permission
in advance to broadcast anything I say to anyone you like.

Back to VWs!  (and there was much rejoicing!)
