Subject: /f Road hazards


Wednesday driving home from work I encountered the second most frightening
road hazard in my tender 14 yrs behind the wheel. Some bozo had lost a 
2'x8' sheet of plywwod in the fast lane. I was driving my Rabbit at the 
time results would have probably been different in the Vanagon. The truck 
in front of me straddled the plywood and the lift of him passing over it 
caused it to rise ominously a car length in front of me. The first time I 
saw it it was 45 degrees from vertical and closing fast. I had time to 
swerve slightly but it hit the right front corner of the hood, tilted 
down and slammed the right front corner of the roof &lt;CRUNCH!!&gt;. When I 
looked in my mirror I saw splinters raining on the cars behind me. When I 
checked for damage at the next exit NONE! No broken headlight/grill no 
dents or scratches. Just my brown shorts ;).

The most frightening hazard? A lumber rack falling of the back of a 
contractor's truck right in front of me, had to swerve right and squeeze 
next gaurdrail going 55mph.

All the recent threads re: flammable substances, exploding batteries and 
other general stupidity made me think that others on the list have 
encountered other interesting road hazards. Anyone care to share?
