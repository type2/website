brrrrrr. - it's cold - at least here, it is!  Bring lots of
firewood, and warm clothes (although layers, cuz it
might be freezing at nite and warm during the day).  You
might want to throw in tarps to make a tent/vw city,
and rain gear.  Popcorn and munchie stuff is also good.
If in doubt, bring it!
