Subject: 84 Vanagon Westy - Fuel Pump Noise

Hi Volks

The fuel pump on my vanagon is making a steady buzzing noise. I have tried
changing the fuel pump (a friend happened to have an extra new pump), and
the fuel pump relay. No change in the noise. The van seems to run fine, but
the noise is irritating, and I'm afraid it could lead to other problems.

Any suggestions from the list members would be most appreciated. Thanks!  Jim
