Subject: Re: Twiga has new shoes [Tires]

&gt; btw, while listees recommend inflations of approx 45 psi front and 53 rear,
&gt; the guy at America's Tire insisted that 40 front and rear was best for daily
&gt; driving, and recommended going up to 45 &amp; 50, *maybe*, &quot;if you really load
&gt; it up for a camping trip.&quot;  I mention this because he also pointed out that
&gt; the warranty would not apply if the tires werrn't used as recommended, &quot;for
&gt; example, if they were overinflated.&quot;  I don't know how seriously to take any
&gt; of this.  It seemed to me that the specs allowed for higher inflation to
&gt; correspond with weight load.  One thing he seemed to be implying was that
&gt; running front and rear at different inflations might have some implications
&gt; for differences in tire wear, which might then have some significance
&gt; related to rotation.

Gail,

Since VW recommends *different* front/rear inflations on every model 
I've ever seen or owned (as do most other car makers), I find this 
surprising, coming from a tire shop. I'd tend to trust VWs 
suspension/tire design intentions more than a tire shop.

That said, you may find 40 psi all around works just fine. I found 
40psi rear made the van more susceptible to cross winds, but was 
otherwise fine.
