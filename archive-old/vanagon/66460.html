Subject:      Volkstoberfest on Sunday in Morgantown, PA

All,
[Apologies if this has been posted already]

This came from the VW Club...

The Volkstoberfest is in Morgantown, PA on Sunday, October 12, 1997, 9am
to 3pm.

1) 30 classes of show cars on display
2) Autocross
3) Indoor new and used car display
4) Swap meet area
5) Toy and literature vendors
6) Kidsports Kid Activity Area
7) '98 Passat on display (no mention of the '98 Bug--sigh)

Sounds like the usual stuff, but it seems to be a sizable show....

Location: The Home Furnishings and Outlet Mall [which from the directions
seems to be located at the intersection of PA routes 10 and 23, near PA
Turnpike exit 22, a few miles west of Philly]

For more info call 1-800-DRIVE-VW
