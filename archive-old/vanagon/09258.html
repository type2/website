&gt;
&gt;&gt; The bulb pulls out of this holder, and costs $0.99 anywhere fine automobile 
&gt;&gt; components are sold.  Try this on an older Rabbit sometime, same bulb but it 
&gt;&gt; takes about 2 hours, to remove the instrument cluster, surrounding panel, 
&gt;&gt; fresh air duct, disconnect the speedo and wire harness. I kid you not. Just 
&gt;&gt; maybe VW learned something from this?   tim s.
&gt;
&gt;Are you sure you are doing that right? 

&lt;snip&gt;

Harrumph, I never said I was doing it right, having only done it once! But 
my gorilla hands would not reach the speedo cable nut without major 
contortions and scars from the stamped steel edges in the way. Also tried to 
get it off at the tranny, no go, and damned little slack to boot. I had to 
go in via the side air duct, fingertips only on the nut etc. Maybe it just 
seemed like 2 hours, cursing loudly while you work makes the time pass more 
slowly? Would I do it again? If the damned car hadn't been an automatic and 
I needed to see the speedo at night, never! Hell, I'll drive with a 
flashlight in my teeth, at least it'll stop me cursing.        tim (time 
marches backwards) s.


PS: my wife recently wrote off this Rabbit. Tough little car, it killed a 
Ford Tempo and a steel guard rail on its way out of the world. Kind of like 
a rabid dog in full flight. No personal injuries on either side fortunately.
