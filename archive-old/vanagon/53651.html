&gt;the problem, fuel had been pumped into the oil, was backfiring badly, the
&gt;engine wouldn't idle or after some time even turn over. He said it had been
&gt;galloping on him so I checked timing which was right on. Then I checked
&gt;compression and #3 tested at 75 the rest 110-120. We checked the float and
&gt;pin on the carb and both were OK. It has a new brazilian fuel pump, rebuilt
&gt;distributer, and rebuilt carb. So anyways I couldn't figure out what was
&gt;wrong with it but I was hoping that someone could give me some other
&gt;possibilities to look at. Thanks in advance for any help.

I've had this happen before, fuel in the oil usually spells out that the
fuel pump is leaking down through the bottom down into the crankcase.  I've
had this happen twice and since the Brazillian pumps seem to be the worst,
I usually install an aftermarket Electric pump 

Hope this helps
