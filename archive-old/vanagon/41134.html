&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;My sister was once bitten by a moose...
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; Did the moose die?  :-)
&gt;
&gt;Once bitten twice shy...

and then there was that famous paragon of literature,
&quot;Antlers in the Treetops&quot;, by Hu Guze de Mous

:)
ah, yes ... the sixth grade. some of the finest years of my life ...
