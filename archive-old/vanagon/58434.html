Ah, heck. For the longest time I threatened to paint the recently sold
&quot;Rusty VanBondo&quot; '57 pseudo Euro Single cab in a Ben and Jerry's theme.

A few years back Cherry and I spotted a BroncoII on Cape Cod, Mass which
reflected the lime green bottom in the shape of rolling hills with a sky
blue background with white puffy cartoonish clouds. Black and white Gernsey
cows were all along the length of the vehicle. The rear most 1/4 - 1/3 of
the vehicle and the rear end had the B&amp;J corporate typography within a
rounded corner rectangle. &quot;Ben and Jerry's&quot; on the top line and &quot;Vermont's
Finest Ice Cream&quot; on the lower line. I had planned to contact B&amp;J, Inc.
regarding and corporate under writing for the body and paint
work-negotiating that the vehicle would remain in the paint scheme for X
years and attend X number of shows each season.
The licence plate would read &quot;NO BGH&quot; &lt;Bovine Growth Hormones&gt; which is a
big B&amp;J concern. I also had occasional flashbacks of the Snapple lady
invading the &quot;Rusty Ranch.&quot;
These plans were DOA about the same time that the beloved truck ambled down
the road with the new owner behind the wheel.

Y'all lemme know if you have a dry and straight pre '64 panel splittie for
sale. I might just reserrect the concept &lt;Moo!&gt;

BTW: Can you imagine what kinda crud that the truckers would give me on the
freeways! Hahahahah
