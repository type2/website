Subject: Re: Fuzzy Gasket

Hi Ed 
 I just replaced both fuzzy gaskets on my 87 westy. i bought them from a 
wrecker for $5cdn each - they connect the vent (blue sliding heater 
control on bottom) passages to the rear (above sliding door in Westy). 
Why there is said passageway on drivers side door I have no idea - where 
does it go? No vents in left hand valence. I believe they are available 
from VW for about $30 or something.

Ciao, RJ

&gt; Hi Listees:
&gt;             I'm looking for the 'fuzzy gasket' that goes between the
&gt; drivers (or passengers) door and the door post. I assume that it is for
&gt; the heat or air transfer from rear to front. This is for an 86 Westy.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks if you can help, or even if you can't. You are all the greatest
&gt; and am learning a bunch..........
