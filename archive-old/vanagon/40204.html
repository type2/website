Subject:      vanagon rear hatch struts and other stuff ...

i got a new Imparts catalog today, and found these advertised:

Volkswagen
  Rear hatch strut without variable hatch opening
    Vanagon, 1980-91 ............................... 60900 .... $20
  Rear hatch strut with variable hatch opening
    Vanagon, 2/1982-91
             left .................................. 60901 .... $22
             right ................................. 60902 .... $22

that's Imparts    (800) 325-9043,  FAX (800) 525-9043
       8041 Hanley Industrial Court
       St. Louis, MO 63144

i don't know anything about the struts (good or bad), but i've been pleased
with the stuff i've ordered from the company in the past. the catalog is
pretty neat, anyway. ;)

and they have vanagon oil filters for $7.00 each (have you checked at your
local dealer lately??) and strange tools like a Bosch sparkplug gapper
and a sparkplug connector-remover. sorry, folks ... nothing listed for the
buses or eurovans. :(  mostly bmw and porsche stuff, but a neat catalog to
get.
