So David Schwarze says:
&gt; 
&gt; I sent this out yesterday and from what I can gather it never made it to
&gt; the list.  Sorry if it's a repeat...
&gt; 
&gt; Volks,
&gt; 
&gt; For those of you who keep up with these things, I will be relocating
&gt; from San Diego, California to Dallas, Texas as of this Friday, April
&gt; 5th.  The move is work-related.  Thanks to this list, I already have
&gt; some VW friends in Dallas to lessen the impact of moving 1,300 miles
&gt; from Southern California, where I have lived just about all of my life.
&gt; So please scratch one '73 Safare Custom Camper (Bluto aka DaBoat) from
&gt; CA.S.SD and add it to TX.Dal.  I will be un-subbing from the list on 
&gt; Friday and re-subbing in a couple of weeks after I get settled.  See
&gt; you all then, and thanks for listening...
&gt; 

Well Shit David!   How am I supposed to harrass you on trip reports
if you're gonna be too far away for the CCC trips?  :(   :)

Well, good luck in your new venture and maybe we'll see you at some
future events when I can make that kind of tour.

Cheers!
