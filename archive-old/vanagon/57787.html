Subject: Syncro tyres

Americas Tire recommended 

Trailfinder 27 x 8.50 R LT14 tires for my Syncro Westfalia. (equiv.
215/75R14)

These tyres have 2+2 plies in the tread and 2 in the sidewall, just like the
Michelin MXL and MXT. Load rating 1515 lbs _at_50 psi. (approx. 1750 lbs w/o 15%
 LT de-rating). 
Has anyone tried these tyres?  Any thoughts? Interferences with bodywork or
steering. Too tall, too much lean, too much &quot;overdrive&quot;?
TIA ...... Joe Ernest
