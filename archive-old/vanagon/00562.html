Subject: Re:  Bus keys

just my $.02 - i think any competent locksmith could handle rekeying event he
'older German cars' someone posted recently -
recently had the opportunity to watch a locksmith work on a safe - there's a lot
of pieces in there man !!!!!!

please differentiate 'twixt a locksmith and the kid at the kiosk at
the mall making keys for $1.50 - especially when you want this stuff
that takes some craftmanship.

Sadly (coming from a 33 year old) I find that the older they are the more
they know what they are doing ( i guess i fit that mold with car mechanics
true to form !!)

BTW did anyone have any ideas about cindys post about a runaway vanagon
or did i miss it?
