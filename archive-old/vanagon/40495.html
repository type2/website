Subject: gas springs rear hatch and question

Replaced hatch springs with boge, which are original equipment,
easy installation.  refer back to original info 91 927 hydro lift i
is right side and 291 935 lift omatic is left 16.95 each plus 5 
shipping.  Now question, had heads replaced, now oil pump gasket is 
leaking. VW says not related, is that true?  Sherwin
