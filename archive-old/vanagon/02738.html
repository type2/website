 Hi,

&gt; Here it is as promised- the obsessive-compulsive list of what to take on this
&gt; trip...
&gt;
&gt;	&lt;More stuff than you can shake a stick at deleted&gt;

 Hmm, looks like Judy and I will have to back out! I don't see us managing
to carry much of this stuff around South &amp; Central America in two backpacks
for nine months...

Cheers,
        W.

PS. How about if we just bring the &quot;Ten Essential Tools&quot;?
