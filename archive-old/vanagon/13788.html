Subject:  Re: Help my brakes on '67

   When you adjusted them, did you adjust both the top and bottom adjusters?

Yep.  Got both on the fronts.  The rear's only have the two adjusters on the
top.
   
   So first, bleed, if not fixed, replace hose, if still not
   fixed, 
   replace wheel cylinder.

Sounds like good advice.  When I bled the brakes, about 3 weeks ago or so,
the fluid was all clear and flowed freely from all cylinders.  I suspect my
master cylinder must be bad/going bad?
   
   p.s. you said that the wheel cylinder &quot;exploded&quot; and you don't already
   have a 
   new one?  Did you just put it back together?  I think the cylinders are
   $12 or 
   $15 each, yet certainly worth their weight in gold in most driving
   situations!

Definately!  I bought a new one, and new brake shoes when I re-did the
brakes.  The old ones rubber was shot.  My bus was parked for two years.
This is probably part of the reason they went out on me.
