Subject: windshield seal.

Dear list,
  i'm about to replace my front windshield seal and i saw there's a variety
out there without the metal strip in there that's much cheaper (12 bucks vs.
80 bucks). is there any reason not to go with the cheaper one ? does that
metal strip in there have any functional significanca or is it just for
looks ?
