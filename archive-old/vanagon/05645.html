Subject:      Vantastics

just a note:

i called these folks (Vantastics) and the guy said he likes to specialize
in later model 2.0 liter air-cooled (1977-83) and later buses, but likes
a challenge at finding wierd parts. so he's not just vanagons only.

also, for you syncro-magnons, he (Bill Liggett) drives one. :)

gee, this might turn out to be really neet!  Thanks, Jerry!

joel
p.s. he (liggett) said he had already gotten a bunch of calls from the nuts
on this list ... he loves it!
