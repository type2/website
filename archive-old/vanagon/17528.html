Subject: Re: Question about driving into Canada with missing license plate

&gt;Volks,
&gt;	I went out to the bus this morning, and the front license plate
&gt;is missing.  :(  It was beaten up pretty bad from offroading, and I think
&gt;it just fell off.  My question is:  Will I still be able to cross the
&gt;border into Canada 


Should be no problem, the province of Quebec doesn't issue front plates, all 
(?) other provinces do I believe. Just tell them yours fell off, hey it's 
the truth. They most likely will assume you are from PQ. In Europe a front 
plates seems to be mandatory, I was often stopped and told to get one. 
Eventually I got fed up with this, so I took the rear plate in and made a 
Xerox. Stuck the copy up front on a piece of tin, wrapped in plastic. Voila, 
no further problems.   tim s.
