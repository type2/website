Bob Marshburn said: &quot;One neat little trick they did was to
                      install a 3 series BMW thermostat
                      which runs the wasserboxer at a lower 
                      temperature.&quot;

Why do you feel that this is a good thing?  My feeling is this is falls somewhere between a bad and a very bad thing.
