&gt;But it sounds like you would have to raise the decklid 7cm -
&gt;not good for Westfalias, but Helmut does have a camper. The real
&gt;question is how will this affect the sleeping area. Again, perhaps
&gt;his layout is different than ours.
&gt;
&gt;Very helpful information, but maybe not for all of us. I want to learn
&gt;more about the disk brake kit, though!

My camper is built in The Netherlands, but the layout is as the same as the 
European Westies.
I try to give you a layout of my campers rear seats:

Non sleeping position

Sleeping position

I am not sure, but the Westies in Europe will have the same mechanism and 
that flat box top of the engine's compartment. If you have that box and the 
wardrobe on the left side cutted on the lower end, you may rise the decklid 
to that level the engine need space for.
