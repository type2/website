Subject: Re: GrassRoots Festival Info



&gt;hey now,
&gt;
&gt;many of you have written me wanting info on the Grassroots 
&gt;Festival in Ithaca, Ny...well, actually Trumansburg, NY. I'll be 
&gt;cruising up there from Raleigh NC july 16 and returning july 23. 
&gt;the festival itself is from july 18-22...it's a GREAT time, GREAT 
&gt;bands, KIND people, relaxed atmosphere.

Just want to add my two cents.  My wife and I have been going to 
this festival every year since the second one.  Recommend it VERY 
highly.  Very friendly scene (also family/kid friendly), some 
really great music (exceptionally wide variety of styles).  
Highlights for us have been the Horseflies (always one of the most 
popular bands at the festival), Hypnotic Clambake (closest 
description of these guys I can come up with is &quot;cajun klezmer 
music&quot;, or a Bar Mitzvah band gone bezerk), and the Second Hand 
Dance Troup, 3 incredibly talented and original acrobats/dancers 
whom you have to see to believe.  Also, the Finger Lakes region is 
absolutely beautiful!   Worth the trip in itself!  

Also, there is a very similar festival in Jamestown, NY (near Erie, 
Pa.), over the July 4 weekend.  Most of the same bands, put on by 
some of the same people.  My wife and I will be going to both 
festivals, in our brown '85 Westy.  (We also have an extra pair of 
tickets for the Jamestown festival, if anyone is thinking of 
going.)

It would be great if there was a Vanagon_at_Lenti contingent at these 
festivals!
