Subject: Re[2]: Whistle sound--Gland nut??






&gt;&gt;high pitched (whistle like) sound that doesn't appear to be directly
&gt;&gt;related to wheel speed.  It occurs in all gears (well, I'm sure of 2-4,
&gt;&gt;but the engine revs in 1st might drown it out) but does go away when I
&gt;&gt;press the clutch in at least half way.

&gt;&gt;The gland nut has 60k plus on it and that is why I'm  suspicious of it.  Does
&gt;&gt;this sound like worn bearings in the gland nut?

No, IMHO it does not. Remember, when the clutch is engaged (No foot on the
pedal), the engine crankshaft and tranny input shaft turn at the same speed-
therefore the bearing in the gland nut is not moving. When you push in on the
clutch pedal, the crank and tranny input shaft are going different speeds, and
the bearing will then begin to rotate. If the gland nut bearing was bad, then it
would begin to sing.

I would have a hard time guessing at the noise you are hearing. Of course, a
teardown will tell you, but that gets a little expensive just for curiosity's
(sic) sake.
