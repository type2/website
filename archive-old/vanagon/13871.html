&gt;I moved just outside L.G. and let me tell you the crime rate is far below
&gt;that of L.G. I can go to sleep at night and not worry about my stereo being
&gt;ripped off right out of my VW in my drive way!!

Sounds like Sacarmento!  Sheesh - people have tried twice to steal my
bus, and stole the taillights last September!

A kid down the street had his '67 stolen, and they _stripped_ it.

BTW - I used to work at the CDF station by Lexinton Resevoir.
