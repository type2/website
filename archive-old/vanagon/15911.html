Subject: The devils advocate

responding to the Chy.Co. Minivan thread:

In the near future, I will have to replace my aging Taurus as the family
hauler, and I have been looking VERY closely at the Mopar Vanlets.

They're :
a more modern design,
water cooled (read:   HEAT in the wintertime!)
come with BOTH air conditioning and the horsepower to drive it!)
criuse control
enough oats (with the V-6 models anyway) to deal with an automatic
(The lil' woman REFUSES to shift gears, end of discussion)
deal with Penna and W.V. hills at 65 mph.

Now don't get me wrong, I love my lil diesel vanagon, BUT!
I want something else as well...

(like a set of pedals for hills!)     &lt;cackle&gt;
