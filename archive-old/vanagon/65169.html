Subject:      Loose screws

Hi there,

This is small problem but it's bugging me.  I've noticed a few loose sheet
metal screws/fasteners have either come loose or have at least lost their
&quot;purchase&quot;.  Specifically, some interior screws that attach the curtains to
the window frames are stripped in my '85 Westfalia.  Should I replace with
over-sized screws or is there something like LockTite that can be used to
make these fasteners secure?  Any ideas would be appreciated.

Thanks much, Marty


'85 Westfalia
