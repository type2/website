&gt; Has anyone ever made their own bra, with darts, etc., to account for 
&gt; curves and holes for headlights and turn signals???

&gt; SEattle Washington, where it's !ALWAYS! sunny and warm and freeways clear.

can't say i have but if you did make your own &quot;bra&quot; (please no pc thread) you would want to make sure 
it fit snogly and didn't &quot;flap&quot; around and rub your paint off.

you would also want to make the bra out of a material that doesn't retain water IMHO
