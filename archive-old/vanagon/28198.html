So Casey, Tim says:
&gt; it.
&gt; 
&gt; My question: Will one of those leak-sealing wonder-additives plug this leak 
&gt; and allow me to use this heater?  Or should I just close off the flow of 
&gt; coolant to it and provide blankets for my passengers?

Well, there's no guarantee for anything except death and taxes, but I
did have my bleeder plug/screw fail on my aux. heater too.  Got a new
one from the dealer for around a buck.  Replaced bad plug/screw and no
more leak.  You'll need to wipe up the area though to help get rid of
the smell though.
