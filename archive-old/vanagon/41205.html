Subject: FS: 1979 VW Transporter Bus

 1979 VW BUS FORSALE.  It is in good condition. It has a lot of work done on
it.
 There is 160 K miles on the clock, I think 20 K on new engine, not sure about
 this though.  I am selling it for a friend who has left the country, and do
not
 know much about this bus or VWs in general.
 I have replaced the u-joints in the rear, the clutch, battery, and had some
 work done on the lights and the ignition system.  He had a lot of work done on
 it to the best of my knowledge.
 It is running well, I rarely drive it, feels nice to drive and looks fine.
 There is a single rust spot on both doors, which are about the size of a
 chicken egg, in similar places; its color is of 2 shades of brown.
 It has a sun roof, AM/FM cassette, and there are 2 snow wheels.  A sink unit
is
 available with the bus.
 He wants $2400 OBO, I will consider any reasonable offer as I want to sell it
 and not have to bother with it.
 If interested please call me at (541) 737-5229 or (541) 867-0290 and leave
 message if phone not answered.  You could also e-mail me at
 ccraven_at_oce.orst_dot_edu.
 Thanks for reading this      Cormac Craven.
