&gt;I have just returned from a 7,000 mile trip in my '84 westy.  It used

I change the oil &amp; filter religiously every 5k miles; measured cold on a
flat surface, the oil level drops ~1/16&quot; in those 5k miles.  I bought my
'87 new, broke 'er in properly (no sexist intent there), &amp; have used
synthetic 20-50 or 15-50 since break-in ended.  The *real* secret is the
initial break-in procedure.

p.s. - I've had the same results with every engine I've either rebuilt or
when purchasing a new vehicle.
