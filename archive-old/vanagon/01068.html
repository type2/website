Subject: ignition cylinder replacement

I wonder if I can replace various locks and ignition cylinders using parts
scavenged from my '72 Bug.  I haven't removed and compared anything yet, but 
I am still wondering, and will try it sometime this summer. 

In the meantime, I rigged my ignition using two light switches, like the
kind one uses to turn on the lights inside of the house with.  One switch
turns on the ignition (and stays on) and the other I toggle to operate the
starter.  I works just fine.  I keep  it under the dash with a rag over it
for security.  It is a low buck cure for the &quot;problem&quot; of not having a key. 

When I posted a query regarding bus keys, everyone suggested that I go to a
locksmith.  The locksmith can take care of me, but only for a lot of money.
I WAS looking for low buck solutions.  Not everyone is into the restore it
to perfection for the collectors' approval/VW mystique/look at me  kind of
thing.  That trip costs a lot of bread.
