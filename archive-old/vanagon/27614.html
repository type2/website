Subject: FS 86 SYNCRO
Date: 27 Oct 95 14:25EDT

I found this in my local paper today...

86 Volkswagon Syncro excellent condition, $6000 obo.  703-952-2740.

I called the folks to check it out and they said it was immaculately
kept, no leaks, engine rebuild at 50k, clutch redone at 122k,
radiator &quot;redone&quot; at 127k, new shocks, breaks, H2O pump, no rust.
It now has 147k on it.

Sounds kinda high to me, but if anyone wants me to check it out, I
will.  its about an hour from where I live (Roanoke, VA), right
down the Blue Ridge Parkway, and the leaves are looking REAL nice
right now...   So if you want me to check it out, I will.

Ian
