&gt;Hello:
&gt;Sorry, but the message will bounce if I use the &quot;sub&quot; word in the first 
couple lines. 

&gt;Does anyone know the address for the beetle list? I'd like to sub

and scribe.
&gt;
&gt;I just talked w/ a guy today about a '61, and he says it has a beetle
&gt;engine in it (he thought it was a '65 engine). As I recall, the 61 had a
&gt;1200 w/ 36 HP stock, but he's saying the 65 engine is a 1300 w/ 40 HP.
&gt;Was the 1300 still available in 65? Anyone know the engine ID to look
&gt;for?
&gt;
&gt;thnx.
