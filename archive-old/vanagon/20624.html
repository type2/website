Subject: Gasoline and Octane numbers

	Rachel writes for Ramona asking about gasoline octane. 

	So I've been running a vaguely scientific experiment for the
last 4000 miles in my Corrado- I switched from 92 Shell Su-2000 to
whatever they call their 89. Someone here said that the lower
octane had a higher energy density and so I'd get better milage with
lower octane.
	And the results? I used to get about 25.6mpg, pretty
steadily, in the Corrado. Now I get 26.6. About a 4% change, 
and in the right direction. Next time I fill up I'll go back
to SU-2000 (92) and see where the milage goes.

	For my air-cooled, I plan to run 92 until I have a head temp
gauge and then do a couplea tankfulls of research. At the risk of
repeating myself, I consider gasoline not unlike peanut butter or other
processed commodities. I don't buy my fuel on price alone, and neither
do I supply my faithful cars on that basis. Have you ever eaten really
cheap peanut butter? Blech!

	Deming's 4th point, as I'm sure Pete Sellers would agree, is
&quot;Cease doing business on the basis of price tag alone.&quot; Couldn't have 
said it better myself.

	Cheers, all!
	Bill
