Subject: 87 vanagon - to but or not to buy

Hello, all-
I've been shopping for a late T2 camper for a while and watching the
type2 mailing list for tips 'n stuff. However the other day I saw an ad
for an '87 Vanagon here in Chicago for $1700. This sounded pretty good. 

I was wondering if there are specific things to look for or to look out
for on these models. Everything I've learned so far applies to
air-cooled busses.

I just went to look at it and it looks pretty solid as far as rust, auto
trans, etc. It was really sad cosmetically - leak from non-functioning
sunroof was 'repaired' with duct tape, ugly home carpeting, interior
door panels held together w/duct tape (seller does HVAC work), etc.,
etc. The engine seemed a little weak, as did the brakes, but I have no
basis for comparison. The left front tire was worn on the edges and the
wheel seemed to have some play in it. The steering wheel was turned
about 30 deg when it was driving straight.

Please reply to tduston_at_sram_dot_com soon. If this is a good price it may be
gone within a day or two - lots of people buying cars in Chgo &lt;g&gt;.

Thanks in advance,
tyler
