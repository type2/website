Hal R. asked:

&gt;I was just wondering what your experience with the exhaust
&gt;system has been. At what mileage did you have to replace which part
of
&gt;it? Where did you get the system, dealer or aftermarket? WHich
aftermarket
&gt;business? Given the scarcity of parts and the problem of having to
wait
&gt;until local dealers receive them is it wise to buy the most likely
part
&gt;of the exhaust system to need replacing in advance of the inevitable
&gt;breakdown?

Well, we're at 29K miles and have experienced no exhaust problems;
really, the only problem that's required any amount of work was
the fuel/temp gauge problem.

If I did have a problem though, I'd probably look to the aftermarket,
but, considering how numerous the EVs are, I guess it'd be good to
know your local recycler or dealer well.

Perhaps the exhaust system is essentially the same from the cat
back on the VR6 EVs?  I can't see VW getting away from the EV/T4
Transporter style body for a while so there should be a reason-
able hope of finding at least two replacement exhausts in your
EV's lifetime.  We've still got the original exhaust on our 6 yr. 
old GLI, but then again, we also live in Cal.
