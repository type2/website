Subject: Re: need faucet top

Thanks for your response.  If you hear any more from Delta Six re
the faucet thing, please let me know.  I have one table top and one
pipe support, although I think they are mismatched.  We should
compare this stuff at Red Rock!  

The replacement door locks I think you can get at the dealer.

Bus boys carries the insect screen as I recall cheaper than the dealer,
but might be perfectly easy to make your own.

Hot laser, huh?  I always wanted a flame thrower from my tail
pipe, with a switch in the dash  :)
