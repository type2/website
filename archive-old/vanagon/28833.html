Subject: 1984 VW Quantum Station Wagon (Berkeley area) 


For Sale:

1984 VW Quantum Wagon, 5GL, was top of the line 4 door wagon, 
has sun/moonroof. Unusual 5 cylinder engine, same as Audi 5000. 

Has been reliable but undermaintained - needs a fair amount of 
work to put back into good condition but should work reliably
with just some brake work. Call or email for more details.
 
It's located in North Oakland near Telegraph/Alcatraz. 

Asking $1300.
