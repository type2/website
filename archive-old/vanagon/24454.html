&gt; Yes indeedy, for you fine folks who ordered the list shirts, I picked
&gt; them up from the screenprinter's yesterday.
&gt; I must say they are indeed fine!
&gt; Sooooooo, I am now faced with the enormous task of mailing 50-some
&gt; shirts. I will try to get them out soon, but quite possibly it will be
&gt; next Monday (Not this coming Monday), because I will be going home for a
&gt; few days, and my parents are equipped to deal with mass-mailing type
&gt; situations. I will be mailing them out third class, so allow perhaps 2-3
&gt; weeks? I have no idea how long they will take.
&gt; Feel free to e-mail me as soon as you get yours.
&gt; Also, since so many people missed the deadline, I may do another run in
&gt; 6 months or so. We'll see how that looks then. I am also considering
&gt; doing stickers...
&gt; Anyway, for those who care, here are the final statistics:
&gt; Note - actual cost of shirts was less than I thought because we got so
&gt; many. Prices dropped .50 per shirt at 37, and then again at 50, so the
&gt; actual cost was less than when I thought we would only be getting 20.
&gt; 
&gt; Screen charge (5 _at_ $15)     = $75.00
&gt; Art charge                  = $50.00
&gt; 46 standard shirts (_at_ 7.25) = $333.50
&gt; 8 XXL shirts       (_at_ 8.50) = $68.00
&gt; Sales Tax                   = $31.59
&gt; Grand Total                 = $558.09
&gt; Number of shirts ordered    = 54
&gt; Avg. Price per shirt        = $10.34
&gt; 
&gt; I have no idea on how much it will cost to mail them, but was told about
&gt; $3.00 each. Anyway, be on the lookout in a few weeks...
