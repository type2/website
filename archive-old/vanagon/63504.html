Subject: Power &amp; Heat;89Vanagon

&gt;&lt;This huge
motor home trailer was being towed by a ~89 VW Vanagon!   The Vanagon 
was
even keeled and travailing down the road at 65 mph.  This came as 
quite a
shock to me especially since I just spent the last 2 hours in NH 
trying to
get my unloaded Westy to go up the slightest of hills!   Anyway, is 
the 2.1
that much more powerful then the 1.9??  What gives here, I've never 
seen
anything like this and don't know if it's normal.&gt;&lt;


I don't know, but I wouldn't take the chance of towing something that 
huge with my 89 Vanagon! These people must have installed some 6 
banger somehow! The later model Vanagon engines are powerful; i don't 
know what a 1.9 is like but if it's anything like a aircooled dual 
ported 1776cc(my previous) well...the 2.1 is alot more powerful. 
There is a towing capacity of course, but that trailer has got to be 
way over it's limit!!
