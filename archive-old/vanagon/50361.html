David,
i believe the &quot;Gas-A-Just&quot; refers to their self adjusting feature. They're
supposed to provide a firmer ride when the travel of the piston gets rapid and
jerky, then smooth out as the movement of the piston calms down. FWIW, I can't
tell when it happens in my van. Maybe in a little Fiat or something...
