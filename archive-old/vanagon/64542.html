&gt; Hi All,
&gt;
&gt; Hope your week is off to a good start!

&gt;
&gt; My current dilema has to do with the bushing that sits on the very tip of
&gt; the starter assembly and is the first part to enter into the engine.  The
&gt; old bushing won't come out.  It feels like it's been welded in there.  Are
&gt; there any special tools or a great trick to remove a part like that.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks in advance!

My experience has been to use a tap that digs into the old installed bushing, yet is no
larger than the outside of the new bushing.  Turn the tap into the old bushing, it eventually
bottoms, and draws out the old bushing.  Works like a charm every time.  Make sure that
you lubricate the new bushing before you drive it in.

*stand the new bushing on your thumb.  Fill it to the brim with motor oil.  Cap it with your
index finger and squeeze.  This will allow the oil to penetrate the walls of the bushing and
permanently lubricate it.  You will notice that the oil will &quot;sweat&quot; out through the walls.  It is
very satisfying.

*it is best to drive the new bushing in with a dedicated tool that will not mar the lip or
surfaces of the bushing.  A marred bushing will drag the starter down.  Find or make a
suitable installation tool.

good luck

Rick
