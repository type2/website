Subject: 84 Westy WBoxer Rebuild - Part I

Vanagonians -

Well, after getting such a good deal ($1000) for an 84 Westy last May of 
96, I figured now was time to yank the blown engine.  There's a hole in 
the top of the case almost big enough for two fists to get through just 
under the air intake plenum.  Guess the PO (3rd Owner) wasn't into 
checking the oil, so it looks like the bottom end may be shot and who 
knows what the heads are like.  There's about 82K (original) on the 
engine.  Original PO and 2nd PO did keep meticulous records showning just 
about every maintenance thing done on this otherwise pristine Camper.  It 
is an automatic, but I'm not in a hurry to get anywhere and that was 
replaced about 18K ago with a brand-new (not rebuilt) unit at VW, so I 
guess I'm OK there.  It has rear air, but I'm gonna yank that out so I 
can use the extra overhead closet space.  AC and Automatics don't usually 
go well together IMHO.

Compliments to the V_at_L Archives and Bentley for getting me through 
pulling this baby.  I had some numbered wiring tags I picked up at the 
flea market awhile back and were mandatory when disconnecting every 
single wire and hose in the engine room.  Have a complete list of each 
numbered tag to help me re-connect when the rebuilt engine goes back in. 
 Still I long for simpler days when I could pull a 1600 Upright from the 
Bus in just 30-40 minutes.  Preparation and actual engine pull took 3 
days (two weekends)(by myself) and now the assembly is sitting on the 
garage floor waiting to be dissected.

Got a 1.9 engine case from AVP - very nicely done and align-bored .020&quot;. 
 Have been talking to a couple of sources and have decided to at least do 
a mild cam (they're saying 270 duration/306 lift) and possibly stroke the 
crank for a little more torque, port and polish the heads, but haven't 
made any concrete decisions yet.  No big bore pistons/cylinders I know of 
out there based on a few phone conversations to friends in Germany or 
here in the USA.  A lot of chuckles tho.  Tempted to do the Subaru 
conversion if California wasn't so draconian in their smog laws here.  
Anybody got any ideas?

Pulling an engine with an automatic is a breeze compared to manual trans 
models - no mainshaift to hang up on.  Hope it's just as simple going 
back in (ha!).  One thing I did notice and have a peeve about is even 
though they have an access hole to remove the torque converter bolts, ya 
can't see the blasted thing without using mirror or removing the entire 
FI plenum and intake runners.  Made an note NOT to install these until 
after the engine is in and the torque converter is married back to the 
flex plate.  Another thing - used a dab of white paint on the engine case 
and the torque converter fan blades to mark where the bolt holes are when 
I rotate the flex plate when installing the engine to.  How does the 
dealer do it?  Not a word mentioned in Bentley at all.   Didn't have the 
neat little tool they show in Bentley to support the final drive of the 
trans, but a buddy around the corner took one look at the picture in the 
book and said &quot;s**t I can make one of those!&quot;.  2 hours later he shows up 
on my doorstep with bar, chains &amp; &quot;S&quot; Hooks, looking practically just 
like factory.  A nice touch was the GM crank pulley/harmonic balancer 
welded to a threaded rod in the middle (adjustable) to be used as a 
support pad.  Not a bad piece of work (Wish I knew how to weld and have 
the equipment) and just what the doctor ordered - worked like a charm 
supporting the tranny when it (and the engine) was lowered down.

Wanted to take the exhaust off before pulling the engine, but the 
bolts/nuts are solid rust/welded on so it will have to wait while it sits 
on the garage floor.  Couldn't get the lower tin pieces covering the 
pushrod tubes and water drain plugs off to drain the coolant because of 
the rusted header pipe bolts/nuts too, so that will have to wait as well, 
drain pan underneath to catch the stuff.  Looks like the PO used regular 
GREEN Prestone instead of the phosphate-free stuff, so I'm kinda anxious 
as to the condition of the heads and such.  Made a note to flush the 
system and radiator at first chance to use the right stuff.

And The Adventure Begins :)

Such a nice Saturday with an impending rain storm breathing down my neck 
to do this :-)

Cheers/Jim
