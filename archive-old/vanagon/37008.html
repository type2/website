this is a post from way back in 1994...  back when i thought i knew 
something.


&gt; Deja Vu--
&gt; The Dreaded Delayed Start.  I fought this worthy adversary, nearly
&gt; lost my mind but emerged victorious.  Scenario:  Cold, morning, turn
&gt; key and if you're lucky it starts after a perplexing (1-2-3 second)
&gt; wait.  Maybe no start.  Get out.  Crawl under van and rap starter
&gt; once with hammer, ahhhhhh. cranking now.  One comment, the cranking is
&gt; getting very weak despite a new Interstate (TM) battery.
&gt; 
&gt; My delayed start (and weak crank) eventually turned into no start
&gt; (unless the hammer rap, my wife got adept at delivering strategic
&gt; blow too).  I removed the starter and 'went thru it' and thought I
&gt; solved the problem by polishing up a somewhat sticky/corroded
&gt; solenoid.  Replace starter expecting the world but got slapped
&gt; with no change.  Remove starter, order new solenoid assembly and
&gt; replace.  No change.  Remove starter, take to my favorite auto
&gt; electric guy and have him 'rebuild' it.  Replace starter, no change.
&gt; Add an additional big-ass welding cable to the existing one and
&gt; clean all negative grounds.  No change.  Many desperate calls
&gt; to rebuilder, lots of advice and vain searches in the ignition
&gt; switch, wiring, etc.  Remove starter, take back to favorite guy and he
&gt; 'goes thru it' again.  Everything tests fine tho he says.  Replace
&gt; starter, no change.  BTW I'm getting VERY good and pulling this
&gt; sucker off now.
&gt; Check all appropriate voltage drops and fix up a few bad
&gt; connections.  With me at my wits end my rebuilder says I've been thru
&gt; the mill enough and that some-times a problem just can't be found
&gt; while its on the bench.  He orders a new Bosch unit from the dealer
&gt; and gives it to me (yes, I said gives as in free) stating he'd
&gt; rather keep me as a customer and have me speak well of himbut he's a
&gt; good guy with a family to feed so I pay half.  Replace with new unit
&gt; and everything has been fine for over 2 years now.
&gt; 
&gt; BTW, if you live in cold climes, I highly recommend adding to your
&gt; existing starter cable with an additional one.  I can't remember the
&gt; guage of welding cable I added but in retaining the existing one and
&gt; adding the monster I effectively tripled the OE diameter.  The van
&gt; just simply cranks and starts at all temps including sub -30 F
&gt; mornings.  A fresh battery helps too and maybe I bought a bill of
&gt; goods with the Interstate but it sure works.
