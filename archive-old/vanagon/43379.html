&gt;Jim at BusBoys had given me the vw part number yesterday to go to
&gt;the dealer with but I just didn't feel like it for a pair of $1 parts and
the
&gt;time delay etc. Hmmmmm..What about those star shaped bushings? Voila, they
&gt;snap over the rod and fit in the fan housing perfectly. Add a touch of
grease
&gt;and now the flap action is very smooth and easily held open by the spring.

Thanks for the tip - I will file that away for a future reference to others
that call.  Although, your's was the first I had ever been asked for on that
particular part in several years.  We've got a few of those star bushings
kicking around here so we now know what else they can be used for besides
taking up space on the shelf.

Excelsior! :-)  Jim / BusBoys_at_aol_dot_com
