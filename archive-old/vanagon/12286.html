Ok, this is not really Vanagon/Bus related, but VW nonetheless.  

I'm replacing the waterpump on my 78 Scirocco and while I was putting
both halves together (with that sealant gunk on the gasket), one of the
bolts sheared off, even though I was using a torque wrench set to the
Bentley specs.  Now, the thing is normally held together by 8 bolts,
fairly equally spaced around the perimeter (see crude drawing of pump
below--the 0 represents the sheared off bolt).

Before I go back the FLAPS and bitch (well, ok, ask nicely for a
replacement), I was wondering 
 1 - do you suppose the pump will leak with the one bolt gone?
 2 - if I wind up getting another pump, to prevent overtorqueing the
     bolts again, would (careful) tightening by normal socket wrench be 
     sufficient to prevent leaking?

In humble curiosity,
Joachim
