&gt;How fast can you drive an air-cooled Vanagon for extended periods without

&gt;My normal highway cruising speed in a normal car is around 72 or so, but
&gt;that's pretty close to the VW's top end. I've read that driving the diesels
&gt;at that speed is definitely abuse and will dramatically shorten the engine
&gt;life; should I be similarly concerned about my 2-liter?
This answer will undoubtedly be countermanded is short notice but having
said that...

I drive a '82 Westy with over 180k on the clock.  The original owner put
150k on the factory engine driving around 70mph every day.  The
speed/stress factor isn't what contributed to the engine's long (for an
air-cooled) life, but his attention to detail.  Details such as, religious
oil changes, keeping ALL the little air block parts in good shape (I have
found 6 receipts for oil sender seals so far), never pushing the motor to
get up to 70 quickly, and the list goes on.

I have driven a bug motor to 125k myself driving 75+ most days.  If I had
been a little more careful with it, it would probably still be running now.

Good Luck
