Dan, Coffee Drinkers,
	Not the whole egg, just the shell from one after you cracked it 
into a hot skillet.  Try to brush off most of the obvious bird crap off 
the egg first.  The little egg white left in the shell will clear the 
brew of grounds.  My method is basically the same as Bob Hoover's.  I 
start to heat the coffee pot full of water a bit then toss in the right 
amount of ground coffee and watch the surface of the floating coffee for 
the first signs of bubbles.  Remove and toss in the egg shell.  Wait 4 
minutes and enjoy.  Don't ever let it boil!  Good luck.  Gary Gibson
