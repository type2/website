Subject: Vanagon refridge runs in heat!?

Phoenix, 122 degrees.

Last week someone described a senario wherein their Vanagon Westy
refridgerator would &quot;run&quot; even though the &quot;C&quot; switch was set according to
the instructions on the refridge door (Gas=off, not 120v, not 12v). I
noticed the post but didn't pay attention to it. Well, guess what. I have
joined the club. The thing tends to run whenever it wants (heat of the day).
It has not occured yet at night when it cools off to only 105 degrees or so.
The refridge is not cold inside at all. Is this a safety feature to prevent
the freon or propane from blowing up the bus? If it is related to the freon
why is this safety item not available on vehicles with regular air
conditioners? Sorry for the rehash but what is the deal? Can someone please
provide real answers or explainations?
