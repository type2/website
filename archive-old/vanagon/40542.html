Steve,

A flit-gun is the thing you put bug spray in, sort of like a tire pump laying
on its side with a tomato can attached sideways on one end to hold the bug
spray, the brand-name of which was 'Flit'.  You pump the handle, the spray
comes out the nozzle.  Being wedded to spray-cans and destroying the ozone
layer, Ami-Ricans are probably not familiar with them any more but they are
still used around the world.  And available at hardware and garden supply
stores.
