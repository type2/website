Subject: Re: How to replace vent window on '75 sliding door?

on the paranoid thread.....

i found that one of those kryptonite u shaped bicycle lock fit nicely
through the sliding door handle and i then could lock it to the passenger's
outside front door handle. the lock is all covered in rubber so it didn't
scratch the paint. you will need the extra long version of the solid metal
kryptonite lock for this to work.

thus to break into you bus via the sliding door or pass. door they will
need to bust that bike lock.

e-mail privately if you want to chat furtherly..

&gt;hello!
&gt;
&gt;i'd like that info too.  someone did this to steal a bike out of my
&gt;bus.  the peg on the bottom was obviously rusty and it broke rather
&gt;easily.
&gt;
&gt;thanks,

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;    How do you replace the vent window in the sliding door on a 75 bus?
&gt;&gt;    Looks like it had a peg at the bottom and top and it pivoted there.
&gt;&gt;    Mine no longer has a peg on the bottom.
