Subject: Rear Wipers don't work

In previous posts I talked about my rear wiper not working and the fronts
not working in the intermittent position. Well, I got around to removing the
trim panel over the hatch, and found that the PO had disconnected the wires
to the rear wiper. (Odd I thought) So I connected them and tried the wiper -
still
did not work. But then the windows stopped working too - blown fuse.

So, looks like the motor is shot, or there is a short somewhere. Nice that
the PO's solution was simply to dissconnect the wiper motor. I wonder if this
could be a
switch problem.  Hmmm, time to dig out the multimeter!
