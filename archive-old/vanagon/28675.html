Some time ago, someone (don't remember who, sorry) inquired about
&quot;electrifying&quot; their Veedubs. 

Jon Legrand (jlegrand_at_geo.arizona_dot_edu) did just that and you can check out
his webpage at
http://www.geo.arizona_dot_edu/home/sacct/jlegrand/webpage/jon.html. 

He told me he would be glad to answer any questions the list might have.
