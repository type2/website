Subject: Re: Do I need a new coil????
Date: Sun, 9 Apr 1995 12:19:24 -0500 (CDT)

&gt;I was driving home the other night and my '73 Bus started backfiring and
&gt;lurching forward instead of accelerating smoothly.  I stopped immediately
&gt;(of course) and checked the engine compartment to find wires attached to the
&gt;coil smoking and sparking.  I found one wire that had fallen off the coil
&gt;and replaced it.  I went to re-start the Bus and the key wouldn't even turn
&gt;in the ignition.  

Mark,

it sounds like your ignition switch is broken and it just might be the
root cause of your other elctrical problems. Find a new one for about
$20-25. 

The switch on my (fuel-injected) '75 broke 4 years ago and caused the
lurching you described, and it also locked the steering wheel.(!)
