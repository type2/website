Subject: Re: SStones' van accident

&gt;
&gt;I said I'd send the details,
&gt;Today my news reader's down so I have lots of time... Here goes.


I lived in Toronto for 4 years, and can attest to the abundance of S**theads 
there. Damage total on 2 vans over $5000 due to other people hitting me, 
sideways, in the back, etc. Stones insurance beef is legit. In one case, I 
was in stopped traffic, as was the idiot behind me. Seeing as how the lane 
on my right was clear, I checked the mirror, signalled, then inched into it. 
Boom, the guy behind me tried to beat me to the space and drove into my 
side. I shouldn't have signalled. The police said I had failed to yield the 
right of way! Should've burned S**theads toyota while he sat in it.  good 
luck ahead   tim s.
