Subject: Just fix it!!!

&gt;From the motivation-to-work-on-your-bus department:
  I had been having problems with my '67 bus starting for a long while,
starting in November. When I say not starting, I mean turning the key, getting
the idiot lights, but nothing else, not even a click. It happened
intermittently for a while, sometimes working, sometimes not. I was convinced
there was a wire loose, and spent a couple hours on several occasions with a
voltage tester and colored wiring diagram. Meanwhile, I had taken the
short-the-solenoid-with-a-screwdriver a step further, and rigged a cheater
switch from those contacts into the engine compartment. All the while swearing
it was a bad connection somewhere, as it would always start from the engine
compartment...
  Anyway, finally, as frustration, time, and money all lined up, I bought a new
starter yesterday, and put it in. It worked!!!! I was thrilled, as well as
irked that I hadn't figured that out a couple months ago...
  So, I went in the house to eat dinner, and then planned to return my core to
the store. Went to the bus after dinner, cranked right up. As I was warming the
engine up, the idle got rough. I gave it gas, and it was still rough, then
died.
Anyway, it turned out that my fuel pump picked that moment to give up the
ghost. At least it was nice enough to wait until I had one problem fixed before
causing another, as multiple problems are really confusing...
  So anyway, the moral of this story is fix those nagging little problems that
have been bugging you. Your bus will thank you, unless you've taken too long,
and then she'll give you something else to deal with to remind you that she
needs constant love and affection.
Anyway, Happy Friday...Buy a coffee mug...I'm off to the North to get that
pop-top roof I've been wanting, and meet a listy or two in the area...
