Subject: Need parts, VW shows, Front Seat Q

Hey volks,

Two questions?  Does anyone have a list of VW swap meets and/or shows for the
Mid Atlantic region for this spring &amp; summer?

Question 2.  I am looking for some small plastic parts for my 85 Westy.
 Please email direct if you have any of the following to sell (brown is the
prefered color):

Plastic 'latch' for the clove box (not the locking mechanism)
window crank
Ashtray for front dash
Latch mechanism for one of the cabinets (they are all the same)
Stove switch (for turning the flame off and on and controling the hieght of
the flame.
Fuse box cover for fuse box under dashboard

Question 3.  Does anyone have any good ideas or suggestions for installing a
seat between the two front seats?

Thanks,

Gregg Carlen
