Subject: Junk or Treasure? You decide.

&gt;
&gt;Josh Poulson has stated:
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; &gt; What other neat camping toys does anyone know about?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; &gt; If not toys meant for camping, how about a list of things you all
&gt;&gt; &gt; throw in when traveling - things not necessarily related to
&gt;&gt; &gt; camping, or to car parts/tools, etc., but which just make life
&gt;&gt; &gt; easier?
&gt;
Comprehensive Road Atlas  (Where the *hell* are we!?)

Would someone volunteer to compile the list from our
respective replies?  (then interested parties could request
copies from the compiler)...  --Ralf
