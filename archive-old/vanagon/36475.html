Subject:       C.V.Tranny[not V.W.]

Sorry about the non relativity to v.w.'s but i thought some one out 
there may be able to help me out with some questions.  I am doing a 
group report on Constant Velocity Transmissions.  I need any 
information i can get on them but most importantly, i need consumer 
feed back.  As  far as I know, the only automotive c.v.t. in the U.S. 
so far was an option on the 89 subaru justy.  They have been a little 
more popular in other countrys.  I think some european fords and 
volvos used them. If anyone has had experience driving, owning, 
maintaining, etc. I would apreciate any input on the reliability, 
cost of repair, drivability, preformance, and so on of your 
transmission. 
thanks a lot.
Ed.

It's almost friday.
