Subject: Re: Westy 3-Way Fridge Questions

The lights for the fridge for both my 87 and my 90 were also green. 
I've never heard of red for the fridge light! 

Are you sure you didn't smoke something funny?

Or there was someone here on the list that mistakenly seemed to think the low
water level light (which is read) was a fridge indication.

I could swear there is only one light for fridge operation (green) and it
lights with either propane or 12 volt operation (which works usually only
with the motor running, unless you have modified your camper) but not with
110 volt.
