&gt; BUT. Compression on Cylinder on right at back (No 2?) was 0. So my engine is
&gt; now out and head off. The piston in question looks as though Christmas was a
&gt; good one. It is melted? curved closest to where the plug is. The plug also seems
&gt; to be longer than the one on the adjoining cylinder.
&gt; What is it that could cause the excessive heat that seems to have done this?
&gt; Is it now just a case of getting a new piston, rings etc or is there something
&gt; more deep and meaningful that needs doing...
&gt; Is there anything else I should look at whilst the engine is out.
&gt; I know, I know, lots of questions so near the new year, but any advice,
&gt; erroneous or otherwise will be lapped up.

Check to see if the head has been milled.  If it has, the compression on
that side of the engine will be higher, and this could have caused detonation
which in turn burned the piston.  Milling the heads also changes the
position of the spark plug relative to the piston (of course) although I
don't know if that would hurt or not.

It seems lots of people like to mill their heads to get a little more 
power, but in a bus this is a BAD idea (IMHO) because of the strain the
motor is under.  Cast iron heads are fairly resistant to detonation, but
aluminum heads and pistons can be destroyed by it in almost no time.  I
would have the shop cc the heads and make sure that the compression ratio
is near stock (8.6-1?  I don't have the manual handy) and then make sure
that the timing is retarded well beyond the point that detonation occurs.
