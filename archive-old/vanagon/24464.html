Make it 81 sniveling lurkers.  I bought a '93 Eurovan today.  I drove one
for about a month two years ago while I was waiting for my Passat VR6 wagon
to be delivered.  I told the dealer then that if he didin't hurry up and get
my wagon, I was gonna keep the van.  Now, I need a van, so I traded my
Passat on the Eurovan.
