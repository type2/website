Many of you have made wonderful suggestions for campspaces in 
between Mendocino, all the way up to near Eureka.  With luck,
as you see from above, we will finally get someone from Oregon
on this gathering!  So, for all you Californians, is there
a limit as to how far north you're willing to go (like, is up
as far as Eureka ok?)?  Gregor:  how far south are you willing
to go?  

After hearing from anyone who cares to comment, I'll post the
suggested places to camp, and let you gnaw on that.  If you
don't respond to this or that, I'll assume you don't have a
strong pro or con on the matter  :)
