Subject: Re: Screens for a Vanagon?


Jim,

When I had my '67 Camper, I took it down to the local upolstery shop and 
they made one for me. I recall leaving the camper with them in the morning, 
and voila, that afternoon I had a rear screen. They also put in the snaps, 
etc. Maybe this could be an option.

Speaking of screens, I made a pair that pop into the openings of the side 
sliding windows on the EV. Bought a roll of screen material, two long pieces 
of frame stock and a couple of packages of corner pieces. About two hours 
later I had screens! Cost - $12.
