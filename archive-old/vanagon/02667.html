&gt; any chance you guys could use the later pipes? my 88 doesn't have any metal
&gt; pipes at all ... great big mother plastic pipes connected by big mother
&gt; rubber hoses.  and the plastic pipes are not even secured too well to the
&gt; frame.  just a thought.

I remember asking the mechanic that replaced my pipe about plastic.  He
claims to have never seen any of those pipes made out of plastic and the 
VW replacement part was definitely metal.  This guy has worked on nothing
but VWs for the last 27 years.
