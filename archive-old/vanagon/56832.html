I've found through painful experience that it is not a good idea to leave
the parking brake on for more than a few days or it will become stuck.  I
am not sure why this happens, only that it does if you leave the parking
brake on for an extended period of time.  Your best bet is to leave the car
in gear if it will sit for a long time

hope this is helpful

: 
: My first problem with my Westy (91).  I went to leave the driveway today
and
: couldn't move a bit.  I determined one of the right rear wheel was
locked.
: I jacked it up, pulled the wheel off and wacked the wheel with a hammer a
: few times.  It's good as new for now but I am afraid it will happen
again.
: 
: Can anyone suggest any preventative maintainance for this affliction?
: Please, please don't tell me this is the warning sign for a major
problem.
: 
: Thanks listees.
