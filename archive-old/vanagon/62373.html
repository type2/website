Subject: traveling tool kit and manual

Hi all,

I've got an '85 westi and was wondering if anyone out there has some
advice for the minimum tool set that they'd recommend carrying while
traveling.  Also, if there's any good and easy to understand repair books
for the '85 waterboxer I'd appreciate your suggestions.  We're planning a
trip in August which will take us through death valley and since we live
in New Mexico overheating is always a concern.

Thanks in advance

Ivan
