&gt;Yo Dudes! Authentic German on the line.
&gt;
&gt; I sent a classified ad somewhere into Germany and this is the first I've
&gt;heard of it. I think I sent it to Bulli Cartel (spelling?), which is some
&gt;kind of Germany VW bus mag.
&gt;
&gt;I cannot remember why he is writing to me but perhaps I didn't put in the
&gt;information about how to subscribe, or perhaps he is new to email and
&gt;doesn't understand the instructions.
&gt;
&gt;Anyway, Joel or Gerry, can you sign 'em up?
&gt;
&gt;(I don't know why, but I seem to be determined to get the Germans onto our
&gt;list.)
