Subject: Re: new engine from VW

&gt;This sounds like a really good deal.  I've been pricing the parts alone,
...  If it includes pistons/liners as well as lifters
&gt;push rods, all bearings, etc, then the $2500 would be well spent.  



Saw this posting and just had to call my dealer VWoCanada. It's true!!! It's 
a bargain!!!, but.....  you got a LOT of work to do still. VW calls it a 
short block, I'd call it a long block. It is a factory rebuild, from the 
crankcase out to the heads inclusive. You/someone has to remove and strip 
ALL of the auxilliary equipment, coolant plumbing. wire harness + 
electricals for ignition, charging circuit, FI..., exhaust system etc. from 
your old engine, then transplant it to the new block. You DON'T have to mess 
with the high precision/clean components of the new engine, which is a plus 
IMHO. I would guess 2~3 full weekends for the job, replacing clutch, water 
pump (?)etc. also, and having nothing break/go wrong during the process. Fat 
chance.
        The Canadian price was &quot;about $3,000.00&quot;, which is about 2/3 of the 
value of my '85 transporter, on a good day! so I'm staying with the old pisspot.
It's probably worth it in a newer Westy however. Since our dollar is worth 
around $0.71 US those near the border may be able to benefit, saying you're 
from out of country may avoid provincial taxes. The core charge was $100.00, 
for that I'll keep the old one. Makes you wonder where all those old rebuilt 
engines came from, lots of secret free replacements ???. Or are thay all 
new, just being dumped by VW?
        Why, after all the effort is this a bargain, because one (1) new 
head is $1600.00 here, + gaskets are $200.00. Doing a significant rebuild 
yourself can't match this deal. I forgot to ask about the warranty. dammit! 
probably 6mos/6000km.     tim s. (just my $3000 Cdn worth)
