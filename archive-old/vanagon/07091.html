Subject: adv req:dropping eng to fix oil cooler

Hello fellow subscribers:

	I recently discovered a steady oil leak on from the top
of my 68' camper's engine.  It has been diagnosed as a problem
with the oil cooler.  To get at the problem we need to drop the
engine.  My mechanic who rebuilt my engine (new heads, valves but
still original bottom) one year 10k miles ago has agreed to fix
it for 2 hours labour including the installation of new (used)
heater boxes and main seal.  

Is there anything else I should have them do while the engine is
out. It is a stock 1500 with 1600 heads on it (this is possible
isnt it).  I am looking to have more and better heat as well. The
present heater boxes give off major toxic fumes that burn my
eyes.  The engine tends to backfire as well and I am wondering if
the potential hole in the heater boxes is the cause of this.
Along with the backfire, the engine seems to have more of a putt,
putt noise, especially noticable when driving next to barricades
and going up hills. 

	Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Darren
