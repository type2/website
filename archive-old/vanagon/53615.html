Subject: how to look at archives?

hi all ive only been on this list a short while and i am not sure where to
find the archives. please advise.  thanks  ive got ?s on the different
years and pluses and minuses between when looking at the diff ones. at
this time i have a 86 gl 2100cc digifant set up and ive played with this
and know what it has.but i would like to find out about the 80-83
aircooled ones with the 2.0 liter . is it hyd and what kind of carb or fi
set up does it have?  or is it best for me to look at type 4s up to 79
from 73. i know the 72 stuff and dont want one. my favorite is the 68-71
upright motor carbed motors that ive known loved and built for many years.
problem is i live in michigan  and do not wish to subject a bus of that
age to the elements. or am i just being a geek? the 67 and earlier are out
of the ? for winter due to top end speeds and my personnal reasons. i
already own a 56 sinlgle cab and love it to death and it would break my
heart to see it rust away on the salt covered roads. 
the freeways also have been bumped up to 70 and top speed on the early
ones is only 58mph at 4100rpm stocker 1600cc. 
sorry for my rambling its new years day and im bored already. and every
thing is closed 
Later Jonce
56 single cab
66 sunroof bug 
66 squareback
86 vanagon
92 jetta 
94 probe wifes car
