beating joel to the punch on CVs .....

when i did my 83 vanagon CV a couple years ago they were knocking like crazy
and had bits of metal in one of them.....

i didnt pull them off the driveshaft, just rinsed them in hexane in a
coffee can and carefully cleaned each race with a toothbrush until they 
shined like new (except where the pits had put deep gouges int he races)

put a big fingerfull of molybdenum disulfide grease everywhere i could stick
my finger (sounds rude)   and put them back together


That was 2 years and 20,000 miles ago - not a peep from them since ...

check your boots though - if they are torn there isnt any point in carefully
doing the cleaning unless you fix a broken boot

sps
