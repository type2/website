&gt;station wagon model.  Nothin' fancy here.  I was thinking about pulling
&gt;out the middle two person seat, and then possibly trying to put the
&gt;camper/westphalia seat in place of the back seat.  Is this a relatively
&gt;easy thing to do?  In other words, can a just pull a bed-seat off any
&gt;80's Vanagon and just bolt it into the same holes that my old one came
&gt;out of?  Any idea how much it would cost?

i had a 73 bus that had the camper rear seat. no big deal to do it ... just
be sure to make drawings (or photographs) of all the attachments to the seat
as you take it out of the camper.

HOWEVER! the camper seat is narrower than the rear seat of the 'normal' bus.
so i had nearly a six inch gap on each side of the seat. it was supposed to
go all the way to the drivers right (with a cabinet on the left). but it
looked even stranger than way (with no cabinet). also: be careful drilling
the big bolt holes into the wheel wells ... put a 'stop' on the drill bit
(so you don't go too far through the hole ... and into a tire!).

an alternative: 1985 was the first year of the 'Weekender Package' ... a
full width rear seat that folded down into a queen size bed. this came in
the non-camper GL models. if you can find one of these, your bus body should
already have the bolt and screw holes in the metal behind the little interior
trim panels. you might want to take the panels off to check first. and any
Weekender bus from 1985-1991 (the fold-down bed was standard in GL after
about 1988).

cost? well, that kinda depends on the junkyard/whatever ... the weekender
might be easier to find (more of them than campers). but you'd likely have
to get the thing re-upholstered (cause sitting outside in a junkyard can
really mess up a seat). check with Wilson's in Lexington, Oklahoma (i have
the address/phone if you want it) ... he seems to have a bunch of bus stuff.

&gt;	I also would love to have a tachometer on my Dashboard.  Anyone
&gt;know if it's possible to pull a dash with a tach. and somehow rig it up
&gt;to work?  A nice Oil Pressure Gauge, as opposed to just a little red LED
&gt;would be nice too.  Anyone?

i put a scirocco tach into my 1980 bus ... a LOT of work and fiddling just
to get it to fit. hooking it up was no big deal. an 85 should (?) be able
to take an 86-91 dash and fit it. you'd need to run a signal wire from the
coil to the new tach. but i don't know if it is electrically compatible ...
any electronics wizards out there?

the oil pressure gauge sender by VDO won't fit into the water-boxer engine
at the 'proper' place: between the pushrod tubes. that's the sender for the
gauge AND the idiot light. i don't know but the gauge-only sender might be
skinnier.

&gt;	On a much more large scale note, someone posted about a week ago
&gt;about trying to put an '86 poptop onto an '85 vanagon.  I never saw any
&gt;replies. This sounds like a major Operation, but I'm not really sure.

&quot;Nothing is impossible or even difficult ... if you don't have to do it
yourself!&quot; :)   it takes only time and money.  if the 85 vanagon had a
sunroof, i would think it would be a project of disassembling one and
reassembling the stuff on top of the other bus. it starts to get really
hard and difficult when you're trying to do all this in the driveway, or
apartment parking lot. if you have to cut a hole into the roof of the 85,
i'd get real nervous about that ... i'm not real confident and anxious
about cutting even small holes in the sheet metal. but that's just me. :)
