Subject: Front door speakers and window crank
Date: Thu, 10 Nov 1994 15:16:23 -0500 (EST)



I have been thinking about replacing the front door 4 inch speakers on my
'84 Vanagon.  I have had the door panels off and checked out the existing
speaker mounting apparatus which looks to me to be difficult to reuse with
a replacement speaker.  The current speakers mount flush with the door panel
and the window crank passes over the speaker grill by just enough to cause
problems.  When the door is closed there is plenty of space between the 
speaker grill and the dash to mount a speaker that protrudes a bit.  It's 
the window crank that makes things difficult.  I was thinking of replacing
the window crank with one that is just slightly shorter to eliminate this
problem.  The reduction in length would make it a bit harder to crank the
window up but I can't imagine it being that much of a difference.

Has anyone already done this?  Are Beetle window cranks any shorter and
would they mate with the window crank cog?  Is anyone aware of a source
for such an item?

I was thinking of going to a junk ward to pick up a couple of window
cranks, cutting the arms off and then mounting the cog portion inside
a custom made wooden crank of the appropriate length.  I could reuse 
the pivot knob since it is attached with a rivet.  I would think that 
a piece of oak would withstand the forces involved.  Any comments?
