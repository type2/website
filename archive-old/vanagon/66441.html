&gt;Hi All,
&gt;
&gt;Is there any specific order that the injectors must be wired
&gt;on an '84 digijet model?  I would have thought that they
&gt;needed to be wired in an orderly fashion like spark plugs.
&gt;However, they all have the same color wires and, other than
&gt;two being on each side, I don't know which wire goes to
&gt;which injector. Could they all be firing simultaneously, and
&gt;thus can the wires go any which way?
