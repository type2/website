I remember my family driving cross country in a watercooled beast one summer.
During one excessively hot day on a long uphill grade, my father resorted 
to the heater as a engine cooling device.  It worked well, but the howls 
of protest and misery from the sweltering occupants almost outweighed the 
advantage.  The temp needle DID make a significant drop, though.
