Subject: Re: SOLAR BLOCK HEATER FOR DIESEL

&gt;	I am hoping that any of the list servers have had contact with a solar
&gt;powered block heater or could pass on some words of wisdom.  Please let

A really unlikely concept for heating coolant, electrics won't likely do it,
considering alternatives....120V battery warmers are 80Watts which is 7amps
at 12 volts.  These things will heat up a battery after several hours, if
well sheltered, great starts from warm battery!!  Maybe it would work if you
had some big 12V solar panels and the battery was warmed up well in engine
compartment before parking for the day.

  Why don't you call Webasto Heaters, they make diesel/gas fired hot water
heaters for transport trucks and MB/Volvo etc cars in Europe (and for
Canadian Syncros heh heh) Fits into coolant circuit, has 24hr. timer and
pump, will run for 20-30 minutes, heats up block plus switches on interior
fan once coolant is hot enough.  Slick AND costly.  try for a used one at a
truck stop/shop.  tim
