Subject:      Re: Getting not subscribed to list when queried

Ken,
You are subscribed to the list as
ken.polk_at_postoffice.worldnet.att_dot_net
and Not
ken.polk_at_worldnet.att_dot_net.
Subtle difference. Only Chris can deal with this, I expect.
Chris, is there an aliases file for situations like this?

I'm CC:ing the list for two reasons.
1. So people realize these problems exist.
2. So people realize that sending this kind of query is more appropriately
   done to the admin - csmith_at_sdsc_dot_edu -- instead of to the list.

&gt; Sorry for the post, but when I send QUERY VANAGON to the

&gt; list, so I hate to send another subscribe.  Any ideas from the List
&gt; Admin guys?
&gt;
