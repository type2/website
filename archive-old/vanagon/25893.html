Subject: Delstar paint...

Hi Thom-

(Apologies to everyone else for using the list, but this is to see if I 
can post -- my last two attempts were in vain)

You mentioned PPG's Delstar... this is the acrylic enamel product right?
If we're on the same wavelength, it's good shtuff. I used Delstar &quot;new 
British Racing Green (kinda &quot;sprucy&quot; looking) on my 78 Westfalia. Very 
durable, and a great, deep shine. 

The only problem: the painter. The guy I employed to do the work was less 
than meticulous in the endeavor, and there are a few glitchy spots 
(drips, etc) that only *I* notice -- no one else seems to. As I recall, 
you spray your own vehicles, which is a great advantage, I'm sure: you 
can take all the time you need in order to do the job right. And only 
your lungs complain....  =)

-Jeff
