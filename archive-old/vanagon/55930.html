&gt;Ok Chris, I think the westy fridge kicks butt campared to the Koolatron.
&gt;But to buy one of these Westie Models in Canada costs about $700. My
&gt;Koolatron cost me $80 with tax. Yes it does take time to heat up &quot;45
&gt;minutes&quot; but when it does I have no problem with milk, meat or beer! I have
&gt;run this thing for on year with no probs. I use it in the winter to keep my
&gt;gloves warm.:)
&gt;
&gt;If u can afford a to buy a Westy model they are much better.
&gt;
&gt;Ps I leave the fridge run all night and have no prob starting the van. I
&gt;will hook up a solar panel to it this summer.

For those who don't own a V-gon Westy (like me - and I don't intend on ever
getting one- too much krap to haul around every day) I think a Koolatron
would do the job. I'd only plan on using it for keeping stuff like soda,
sandwiches, etc chilled on day or weekend trips - not for keeping ice cream
frozen for weeks or something like that. 
I think for what it is, it seems like it does a good job. 

Anybody else hear of any other brands comparable to the Koolatron, that
they've been satisfied with?

p.s.  - I have 2 late bus westy's ('74 deluxe, and a '77 deluxe) that have
the Dometics. 
Very lame, I must say. I would imagine (and hope!) that the V-gon westy
Dometics are better.
