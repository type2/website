&gt; 
&gt; I purchased the factory lock for the rear liscence plate thinking that this
&gt; would protect me from bag guys pouring sugar down my oil filler tube when I
&gt; was parked in manhattan. 
&gt; 
&gt; This part is shown in the microfiche but it is available only from Europe. I
&gt; send a photocopy of the relavant microfiche page to a dealer in Europe and
&gt; told him to ship me the parts by surface, government ordinary mail. 
&gt; 
&gt; He did as I asked. Before shipping he called me at 6am from Germany to
&gt; request that I send him a personal check for US$50, which I did.

  You know, what we really need is a European VW dealer, online, from which we
  could order parts. If purchases were done with credit cards, the currency
  exchange rate problems should be taken care of. Using email should prevent
  any odd-hours phone calls. Does anybody know of such a dealer?
