Subject:      oil filler neck extension

i deleted the original e-mail so i don't know who sent the question about
whether they had an extension, i just checked mine, and realized that
over 13 years of owning this van, my mom, and now i, didn't realize that
filling oil into the van could be slightly simple.  i'm much used to
the old school way: hold flap open, aim nozzle of oil bottle, try to catch
any drips with rags before they land on the exhaust.

anyway, to see if you have one of these, open the oil filler cap, look
just above(ie. nearer to you) the threads of the tube.  if you see a ring
with &quot;scalloped&quot; outside edges, twist and pull on just the scalloping to
extend the tube.

BTW: i am getting another engine for the van, and (i'm not promising
anything) if i don't need the oil filler tube, i'd be willing to part
with it for however much it costs to send it through the postal system
and your oil filler tube (i will be trying to put the engine into a
go-cart and might need it).
