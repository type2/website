Subject: Porsche-powered Vanagon

Comments from several who took time to look at partner22.njit_dot_edu/toybox/
toybox.htm led me to an educational exercise about .jpg files.  Image
quality is much higher on an image with low compression and 16-bit color
depth than it is one with high compression and 24-bit color depth.  Upshot
is that the images on the page are much clearer now.  Thanks to those
who wrote to say the images needed work.  Page incidentally now includes
shots of the van itself, contributing nothing of course to the technical
issues of the conversion.
