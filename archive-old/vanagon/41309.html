Subject:      it's an 87 Syncro Camper in Atlanta FS ...

ok, ok ... so i'm weak. :)  i called the number and the camper is in
the Atlanta area (Gainesville?). here's the ad:

Volkwagen 4WD Vanagon GL, syncro Westfalia front/rear hitch, awning, sink,
stove, pop top, 2 beds, refrigerator, extra heater, extra battery, sunroof,
ac, full hookup, storage, factory rebuilt engine, w/warranty, KYB shocks,
new alternator, new drive shaft, low miles, rare, extra lighter &amp; tables,
$15,900 obo. call (770) 869-9568

it's got 130,000 miles on it (been to colorado and back several times); the
engine &quot;froze up&quot; and was replaced in Durango, CO by the VW dealer there.
it's a 1987 model (aren't they all??) and is light blue (Dove Blue Metallic)
with the &quot;4WD&quot; decal down the sides.

the seller got it as part of their divorce settlement, and she needs to
unload it (and get a &quot;normal&quot; little car). :(  so anybody that has a good
home for it ...

since it just happens to be my favorite color, ;)  i guess i'll go down to
the credit union on monday and see what sort of financial chaos and ruin
i can convince them of subsidizing. wonder what the insurance on the beast
would be??? :(
