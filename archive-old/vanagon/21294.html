Dubsters,

 Following the words of the converted (thanks all!), I can now be an
&quot;official&quot; member of this list. For a mere $3k I purchased my Synchro
Vanagon last night and I am psyched.

 Begin phase two: How should I convert this box to something liveable for
my family and I? It is essentially bald from the front seats back. Any
thoughts/ideas/company names, etc. will be appreciated.

 Here's my new(pseudo)signature file:

                                                  92 Passat Synchro Wagon

                                                          AND

                                                  87 Vanagon Synchro


                                                          BOTH

                                                  Titian Red


Thanks again!                                                              R.
