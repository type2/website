&gt; Hey Folks,
&gt;
&gt; Should I be concerned about the functionality of the fridge on my Westy at
&gt; high elevations? If so, at what elevations should be concerned and is their
&gt; a solution to this problem?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks!

When I got mine it didn't work at 500 ft.  Took it to be worked on, they
said they installed bigger jets.  That may be the problem, but mine
gives out at about 6000 ft.  That's about about half the atmosphere, I
think.
