Subject: 2nd Battery-What Kind?

I've seen the instructions on the WWW about installing an auxiliary battery in
the Vanagon.  I'd like to do it for my 84 Westy, but the box behind the driver's
seat appears to be too small to accomodate any batteries I've seen at the
stores.  The way I measure it, the battery must be no larger than
11&quot;(l)x7&quot;(w)x6&quot;(h).  Does anyone have a recommendation for sources for
appropriate batteries of this size?  The regular lead-acids at most stores are 7
3/4&quot;(h), and the deep-cycle types (best for lighting/camping) are 10&quot;!  Thanks.
