you'll probably get lots of responses to this one....

basically what you saw is a VW Panel Van of a 56-67 vintage. Without more
deatails, it is difficult to pinpont the year. The &quot;visor&quot; over the
windshiels, is actually the air intakes. On the underside of the &quot;visor&quot;
there are two screened air intake vents, they ventilate the cabin and/or
the cargo area. If the van had a bench seat, there would be two extra air
vents, right uder the roofline at the back of the van. If the van is a
walk-thru, it would not have these two vents.

Please note, an additional &quot;visor&quot; was available in England, that served to
deflect the sun. I haven't seen any of these over in N.America, but they
were/are popular in England.

If you wanted to know what year the van it is or its' origin, take note of
such things as the front and rear taillights, exterior and interior door
handles, as well as whether or not the bumper had overriders or not.



&gt;Saw the greatest VW bus I've ever seen yesterday.  Don't know
&gt;too much about the older vans (earlier than mid '75's) so let
&gt;describe it and I'm sure someone on this list knows.
&gt;It was a split front window, no side windows, had some sort of
&gt;'visor' over the front window.  Also, it was painted battleship
&gt;grey and had AZ historical plates (# 78B9).  I know it's up to
&gt;the individual to say their car is historical and get those plates
&gt;but this bus deserved them!  I assume everyhring I saw was
&gt;original?  It was a clean bus.
