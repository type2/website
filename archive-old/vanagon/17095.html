&gt; Subject line says it all, Dave Schwarze has a line on a '63 back bumper
&gt; and I need one for my '66.  Are they the same??

On the same thread, I called this guy and he still has the bumper.  He
described it as having &quot;no damage except for two small dings&quot; and &quot;only
light surface rust&quot;.  I haven't seen it yet, but I guess I will go look
since it seems a few people are interested.
