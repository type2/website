Yes!!  you are correct, that IS what the RV guy told me, I'm just having a
little lapse of memory (what little of that I have left!).  He said the
amonia boils, etc. etc. etc. 
But that's why it has to be level anyway.  I got this info from the owner
of Major's RV Center on Cape Cod.  He deals with Dometic and other fridges
that work the same way.  
Sorry for the wrong info.

&gt; For your edification the Dometic fridge does not contain freon. It uses
&gt; an amomnia (sorry spelling?!?) compound. Not that that helps us
understand/
&gt; use the fridge any better.
