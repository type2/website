&gt; on this beastie.  How about we play &quot;the price is right&quot; with the total
&gt; expenditures on this baby so far?  You people can post your gueses here,
&gt; and in a couple of days, I'll post who the winner was.  Prices include the
&gt; cost of parts only.  I have done every single bit of labor myself, and I
&gt; work for free (sob!)  I have posted the prices of most of the stuff I have
&gt; bought, so it will have paid off if you were paying attention.  

Paid off?  What's the prize you are offering?  :)

Bob, I bid $3800!

I couldn't agree more!
