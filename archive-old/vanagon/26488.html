Subject: Back on BusBoys...

     Well I actually received my order today (placed about three weeks ago 
     via FAX using VISA). So no problems there, but still no response from 
     their email. I guess they're busy. I suppose they can't ignore (I 
     don't mean it like that) a FAX so I'd suggest FAX as the best way to 
     talk to Jim at al.
     
     Order was well packaged etc.. and hey I've got a copy of the infamous 
     Bus Boys catalogue. I must say the catalogue wasn't really as full as 
     I expected (apart from Westy bits).. I do prefer the Bus Stop 
     catalogue for content, but then it doesn't contain coooool items such 
     as IRS and swing axle kits for you pre '67.
     
     Lee.
     
     ps, got stung by the import duty and post office handling charge :(
