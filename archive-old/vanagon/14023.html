Subject: 6V wiper saga

Does anyone have an older bently which they could grab the current for the 6 
volt wiper motors?  Mine for 71 says 2.5 amps at low speed and 3.5 at high 
speed.
If I can get this info, I'l send out the finished circuit as a image file.  
Anyone have a preference as to what format?
