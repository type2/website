Thom,

Do you still have a functioning reserve tap? I leave my '56 bug
on the &quot;off&quot; position (even when I have the shifter locked) when
I park it in a strange place.

I figure that not too many people know about the old reserve tap...
and within an 1/8th of a mile or so the car runs out of gas.
