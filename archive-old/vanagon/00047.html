Subject: Re: Diesel Vanagon

I was told some years ago to &quot;not bother&quot; about valve
adjustments in the Diesel unless there were &quot;obvious&quot; problems,
since the adjustment is fairly arduous involving spacer-disk 
placement/replacement rather than a conventional tappet adjustment.
This was with a youngish Jetta at the time (`81, 60K miles).
Of course, I never had any such obvious problems... and my `82 Diesel
Vanagon with 88K miles has never had a valve adjustment to my knowledge
either.

   &gt; 1) The first &quot;injector&quot; is leaking diesel from the threads (YECH!).
   &gt; Couldn't get a wrench on it. Looks like a &quot;Special Service Tool&quot;.
   &gt; 

   &gt; 2) I was told the valves should be adjusted, and this would improve
   &gt; performance. Is this true? Is this normal periodic Maintenance?
   &gt; 

I also would like an opinion from a Diesel-valve-adjustment experienced
owner.  In any case, I'd take care of the injector leak first before
attempting to diagnose/prescribe further &quot;performance&quot; problems in a Diesel,
performance being a relative term.
