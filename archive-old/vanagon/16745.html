Subject: Re: parts

&gt;just wondering, i talked to my local VW dealership and they told me that 
&gt;parts for a 1984 vanagon would be difficult to find, what is the parts 
&gt;situation with vans, it should change by region, like in the DC metro area 
&gt;(where i stomp around), it probably has half the number of vanagons that are 
&gt;in calif. so parts would probably be a problem...  god, shopping for a vw 
&gt;vanagon that fits your criteria (which is not too stringent) is tough.
&gt;
Give the guys at Courtesy Auto Service a call. They are in Madison,WI.
Phone is (608)244-8088 . They stock all sorts of bus and vanagon parts.
They really know their german cars.
