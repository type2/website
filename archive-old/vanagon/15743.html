Subject: 66 poptop 4 sale Toronto


A friend of mine just had her 66's engine rebuilt last year and now her 
brakes are broke and her steering box is on it's way out.
She's sick of it... She's decided to devote her time and money to the
ghia instead of the bus.  It's gonna need work but we all know how 
rare those old splitties are around these parts. (Michael Heron
hordes them all.  )

Anyway, 
66 Splitty (of course)
Pop Top  Square pops straight up, not hinged up... you know what I mean.
New Carb, recently rebuilt engine.
Fold out table
insulation

Her name is Susan Richter    (416) 463-7560
I don't know how much she wants for it... You'll have to work it out.

I, long ago, used to do a bit of work on this bus, so if you have any 
questions, I might be able to help thru e-mail.


Cheers
