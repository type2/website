Subject: Re: oil filler revisited

&gt; Sean brought this up at the beginning of the month, the fact that the
&gt; oil filler extends so you can pour in oil easily.  I've been aware of
&gt; this since I bought the van.  However, at some point in the last 3
&gt; months or so, it has become stuck.  There is no way to pull it out.  I'm
&gt; not sure exactly what happened (maybe an uninformed mechanic tried to
&gt; 'help' and glued it down thinking it was broken?  or worse, actually
&gt; took the inside/extending section out altogeth?).  Any ideas out there
&gt; on loosening it up?  We've tried twisting, yanking and combinations of
&gt; both. 
I guess the obvious question is: is it there at all? I've pulled mine 
right out a few times, in an attempt to get that last 1/4&quot; of length 
out of it, so it's possible a mechanic forgot to put it back.
A careful look should tell if it's still there, since the lip sticks 
out about 1/8&quot; beyond the threaded neck.
