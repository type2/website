Subject: Need Split Bus Cargo Door Latch

The handle side latch on my '56 broke yesterday.  I tried taking it
apart to fix it, but it was hopeless.  The spring was broken, and the
mechanism itself is so worn that if the latch is opened too far, the
whole thing locks up, which us what happened yesterday.  I managed to
get part of the latch installed, and its somewhat operational, but
I need a new one bad.

Any latch mechanism from a &quot;high hinge&quot; bus should work, which is up to
'62 or '63 I think.  I know there's a few of you with busses you're
parting out, so he's an opportunity to make a little cash - not too
much, I hope!

Thanks!

Thom
