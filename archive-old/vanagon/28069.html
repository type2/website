Subject: New Top Seal - ' 71 Bus


Has anyone had any experience replacing the top camper seal on  a 1971 Bus?
I just received the after market seal from Bus Boys (not a bad price either
- $69) for my Westy, and as soon as it stops raining, I plan to approach
this job in the proper Zen-like manner.  Ha!  

(BTW, If anyone knows what the proper Zen-Like manner is, please let me know.)
