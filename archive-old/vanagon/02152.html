]am sure they are not {VW licensing from GM???})

Torx drives may be much used by GM, but the patent and name are owned by a
fastener manufacturer (Camcar, if I recall correctly) and sold into many
industries.  We use 'em to screw computers together.  VW isn't licensing
Torx at all, but they are likely buying from a European fastener manufac-
turer who is.

BTW, the &quot;star-hole&quot; reference above implies recessed (internal) Torx
drives.  There are also external.  I have drivers for both (see Snap-On).
The advantage of Torx is that it transmits more torque in a given size
without slippage than any other form of drive.  The result is that a
single size of driver can be used with several sizes of bolts.  It means
that our service folks can carry a single tool to do what previously re-
quired several sizes of Phillips or PoziDriv driver.  I've been a Torx
cheerleader for around 20 years.
