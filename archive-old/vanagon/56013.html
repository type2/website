Subject: Re: German license plates

Jeff L. asks about original German plates:

&gt;Do you know any where I could get a used
&gt;original one that is the horizontal kind.
&gt;I do not want a personalized one, just an
&gt;original.

I've heard of people picking up discarded
tourist delivery plates (those are the ones
with the expiration month and yr stamped on
the red section) from the dealers that the
vehicles were shipped back to in the USA.

Why someone would pay thousands of dollars
for a car, (presumably) have a great vacation,
then discard the plates instead of keeping 
them as a souvenir escapes me, but seeings
how you've got Champion Porsche down there
FL way, maybe you could ask around a few Euro
car dealerships and get lucky.

Oh, and if you find one, you best know what
city is represented by the first few letters
of the plate, you wouldn't want to be accused
of being a wannabe...  ;)

Good hunting!
Norman
