Subject: Rear (pulley) seal on Syncro

Has anyone had experience changing a rear seal on a Syncro with the engine in
place? Bentley shows a trick tool for pulling the bolt, but who but a dealer
would have one. It appears that the seal is leaking though the engine is
pretty fresh, a VW remanufacture with about 12,000 mi., supposedly under
warranty. When I checked with the dealer about the warranty I was told that
they would pay for the part but not the labor because the engine was not
installed by the dealer, is this a scam or what?  If anyone has any ideas
about pulling the pulley or other possible sources of the leak (it appears to
be around the seal, the pushrod tubes, valve cover gaskets and drain plug
look OK), I like to hear them.

Thanks,
Derek
