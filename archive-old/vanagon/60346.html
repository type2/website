Subject: Skylight replacement template
Date: Thu, 22 May 1997 14:29:14 -0400

To all who asked me to send them a copy of my template for the replacement
skylight, they're in the mail. Sorry for the delay in getting this thing
out. I like to share my ideas with the list, but sending these out is kind
of a pain-in-the-a** and costs me money, therefore anyone that wasn't on my
list is out of luck. I'm kidding, I'm going to post my instructions on my
web page which will even have pictures when I get the film developed. Look
for my posting under this heading later this weekend. Also, I will send one
out precut with all the nuts and bolts you need for the job if anyones
interested. Again, look for my posting later this weekend. Keep in mind
though, These things look great from the inside and don't leak, but the OEM
lens looks alot better from the outside. So anyone unusually tall might not
care for them :-) I'm working on something that will help the appearance
from the outside.

Have a great holiday weekend everyone!
