comment on messages by Rick Gordon and Kenyon Fairey 10.jan.97:

- are both of you talking about a 97 EV VR6 Winnie with 
automatic transmission?  I had a chance to compare
automatic vs. stick on two brand new 95 EV's last May:
the stick shift on these two models appeared to behave 
significantly stronger when going uphill.

- has anybody made the statement recently that the
97 VR6 is available in the States only with automatic
transmission?  If yes, I wonder why?

- passenger compartment heating:  I just got back from a 
winter trip to CA with my 95 EV Winnie.  Temperatures not
lower than freezing at night, left the heater on while
sleeping, no complaints.  When comparing notes with
Dan Herbert's last winter, I guess he has do deal with
lower temps.  Would be interested in a 97 camper owner's
experiences with the heating.
