So BSNICH01_at_ulkyvm.louisville_dot_edu says:
&gt; 
&gt; I have been lazy this summer and didn't fix 2 things on &quot;STRIDER&quot;. My heater
&gt; blower knob is frozen (all the way clockwise). If I turn it on it will heat
&gt; (from levers) but I can't turn the knob off or on (it comes off). 

Okay, so you have a rear wiper, so this tells me that this is a Vanagon of 
some year.  I'll assume it's water cooled.  I had my blower switch malfunction
on me one time and they're a pup to fix.  Just pull off the vent control lever
knobs (gently mind you) then carefully pry out the control face plate.  Now
you should have access to the heater fan speed switch.  take of the front know,
I think you just pull straight back.  Then from behind the dash you can remove
the switch unit itself.  Remove the plug.  Don't bother trying to fix it.  It's
too squirrely.  Just pay the $10 or so and get the new one in there and then
put it all back together and you're done.

I've never tackled a wiper problem before, so I won't hazard a guess.  I'm sure
there's plenty of volksie people out there that can help you there.

Good Luck!

Steven
