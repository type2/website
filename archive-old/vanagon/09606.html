       ====================

       I know of an auto dismantler in the UK who apparently
       specializes in VW transporter parts, and they may have the part
       you want.  I was looking for an unusual-in-the-US part by
       telephoning all the UK dismantlers who advertise in
       _VW_Motoring_.  One of them referred me to this place. 
       Although they did not have my part, they were polite,
       interested, and tried their best to be helpful.  They will
       accept a visa card number to pay for a telephone order and are
       happy to ship overseas.  Their phone number (when dialed from
       here -- nor. cal.) is 011-44-81-317-7333.  Our UK friends may
       not know the name &quot;vanagon&quot;, so you might be prepared to
       describe it as a &quot;transporter&quot;.

       Good luck, Ian.
