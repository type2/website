I, too, have noticed this phenomenon at REI, even here in Dallas where you have 
to look long and hard for a vanagon!

Subject: Syncro Convention! :)

 &gt;&gt;  I pulled into the parking lot of the REI (Recreational Equipment Inc)
here in Spokane today and parked next to another Syncro.  It was a 90 or 91,
and silver colored.  While walking across the parking lot I past ANOTHER
Syncro.
 This one was a white 86 or 87 GL Camper.  I couldn't believe it.  Including
mine, there were THREE Syncros in one small (15-20 cars) parking lot.  I
thought I might meet one of the owners when  I came out of the store, but
 both were gone when I returned.  I wonder if either of the other Syncro owners
noticed the abundance of Syncros??
 Wouldn't happen to be anyone on the list would it?? &lt;&lt;

 I did a little Christmas shopping at the REI here in Seattle last week. 
Parked my '86 GL on the street.  Came back later to find a red  Syncro about 5
spaces away and another one, gray metallic, across the street.  Must be
something about REI that brings out the manly adventurer Vanagons...
