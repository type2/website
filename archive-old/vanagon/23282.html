Subject: Bob On Tour


After the recent passing of Jerry Garcia, I realized there was going to 
be a giant hole in my life.  What would I do with my vacation time, 
usually spent following the Dead around the East Coast for a few weeks 
each summer.

I would be happy to help Bob get from Durham NC to either Washington DC 
or Atlanta GA, places I usually go to see the Dead.  Also included are as 
many &quot;kind veggie burritos&quot; as Bob can eat.  And he can sleep in the 
bottom berth of my camper (as long as he doesn't snore).

-gary      Nothing left to do but :) :) :)
