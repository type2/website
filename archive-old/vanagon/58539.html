Subject: O2 Senson

I was reading in the list about problems associated with the O2 sensor.
My 1990 Vanagon has over 102,000 miles and supposedly according to the
Bently manual, this sensor is to be replaced at around 90,000 miles. The
van is running as well as can be expected using California gasoline.
Should I change it out or leave until something fails?
The sliding door seems to work since the WD-40 treatment. I still
haven't gotten around to really checking the rear door catch. Maybe this
weekend....
