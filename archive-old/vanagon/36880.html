&gt;&gt;&gt;Haven't followed the thread, but JCW has &quot;Urethane Shift Coupler Kits for
&gt;&gt;&gt;$7.59 for the 68-79 and $13.95 for the 50-67. Page 4 of current (expires
&gt;&gt;&gt;March 31) VW catalog. I'm ordering mine today (because I need it) and
&gt;&gt;&gt;I'll be happy to report on quality to the list if desired.

&gt;&gt;From: rvanness_at_neuron.uchc_dot_edu
&gt;&gt;The urethane coupler kit I bought for my '71 from JCW was from Bugpack.  It
&gt;&gt;included the cage and the urethane bushings but not the pin and retainer (I
&gt;&gt;reused my old one).  I recall seeing the pin/retainer in the RMMW catalog
&gt;&gt;and I believe the kit they sell includes everything.  My new coupler has
&gt;&gt;worked well now for over 1 1/2 years.

&gt;From: walshp_at_ippdsgi3.nawc-ad-indy.navy_dot_mil (Pat Walsh)
&gt;I got one from RMMW and it did indeed include everything.  (Mine was for a
&gt;T2; I'd assume the T1 would be similar.)  Works fine but I don't have that
&gt;many miles on it.

hmmm... judging from responses 2 and 3, the part(s) described bear little
relation to the one that I need.

Observation:  I haven't yet done a detailed study on auto parts, but my
10-year experience servicing NASA space suits taught me that urethane has
an eight-year service life.  Then it is subject to all sorts of horrors.
Double-bagged unused parts of the suit would flex once and the urethane
coating on the inside of the bladder layer would crack.  Not good.  If I'm
going to the trouble of replacing something that lasted 17 years the first
time and 19 years the second I don't want the new one to last only 8 years.
(March, 2004 - &quot;What!?  Again, so soon?&quot; Who knows what other challenges
I'll be facing then...)

$14 is much better than the price I paid 19 years ago (and the change in
relative value of the USDollar makes it even better), but I'd still like to
try fixing it myself.  Getting the part will probably be less of a
challenge than removing the broken-off square-drive bolt.  Someday I'd like
to meet the idiot who named them &quot;Easy-Outs&quot;...
