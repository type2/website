&gt; 
&gt; Has anybody out there in Vanagon land ever dealt with Transform?  My '66 
&gt; stopped going backwards about a year ago and it is finally beginning to 
&gt; bother me.  Although it is against my credo to pay someone to 
&gt; rebuild a transaxle for me, I can't afford the downtime while I 
&gt; do it myself.   Any experiences -- positive or negative -- that you could 
&gt; share with me would be greatly appreciated.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Tom
