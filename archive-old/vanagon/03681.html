    If solvent, penatratin' oil, and torches don't work, go out and 
    but yourself a 'Nut Breaker'. They look like magnifying glasses 
    without the glass (oh and they have a chiesel like thing that 
    screws towards the centre).  There's all sorts of sizes to choose 
    from.
    
    Clamp the nut breaker onto the nut, (the van's of course), twist 
    it up, and snap the bugger to bits.  Then go out and get yourself 
    new nuts n' bolts.
    
    It may be a more costly way to remove those bolts, but the mental 
    anguish you're saving makes it all worth while.
    
    Eric
