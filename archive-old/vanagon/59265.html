One of my cats was missing for a day until I found her closed up in a
neighbor's van pawing at the front window.  She had climbed in through the
roof vent with no screen.

Another cat was missing for 4 days, I suspect that he somehow got trapped
in a vehicle or in an apartment at the time.  I had seen him in a closed up
Jeep before.

While leaving my driveway yesterday I looked over at my 82 Vanagon and
noticed a cat inside!  I wandered how she got in there and realized I
have the motor out for a rebuild and left the engine cover off!

Always remember to put the engine cover back on or who knows what will
invade your VW.
