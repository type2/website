Subject: Library Bentleys

Sorry to send this out to the whole world since it is probably of interest
only to us in and around Hennepin County, Minnesota but I'm not sure of the
list members around here.  The Hennepin County Public Library system has
Bentley manuals for loafs and bricks up to 1987.  I have used the latter to
make copies for the diff lock on the Syncro (so don't bother Tim, I got the
pages.  Thanks for the offer, though.) and will be back for the Westfalia.  I
cannot borrow these as I am in Dakota County and that library system doesn't
even have Haynes.
