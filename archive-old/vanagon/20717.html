I am curious...

Are there other people, like myself, who remember peoples' Bus-names
but not the peoples' names? I will use as an example, &quot;Das Boot&quot; and
&quot;Bozo Bus&quot;.

It would help *me* a great deal if we could get a mapping of vehicle
names to people names...Does anybody else feel this way?

NuBus - '82 Diesel

p.s. NuBus got its name to differentiate it from the &quot;old bus&quot; which 
    was a '76. NuBus is actually a nickname.  The proper name is:
    &quot;NuBusNuBusNuBus&quot;.  She was named before I got her. Don't blame me.

P.P.S. I engendered NuBus as a &quot;she&quot; because like my wife, NuBus gives
       me trouble and costs me a great deal of money... (but I love them both)
