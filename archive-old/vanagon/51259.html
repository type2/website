Subject: '87 Syncro rear window defrost


The rear window defroster doesn't.

The light on the switch does not come on when the switch is on, either.  
The fuse is OK.

It worked last winter.  If anyone has a method for finding the problem, 
please share it.  Is there anything in the Bentley manual that might 
help?  I searched it, and found only the references to the defrost in the 
wiring diagram.

Many thanks to anyone who can help.  The ice back there is getting 
thicker every day...

P.S.  It took me about 10 oil changes to discover the oil-filler 
extension.  When I did, I reread the owner's manual much more carefully!  
I learn something new every time I do.
