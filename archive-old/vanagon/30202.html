Subject: Re: Bentley Manuals

	Hello Aaron,

	I am posting this to the list because this is a FAQ.

	JC Whitney has new manuals for about $70. 
        CALL TOLL FREE: 1-800-575-1888 mention code A316 to order your 
FREE JC Whitney catalog. 

	There is a used bookstore here in Seattle that specializes in auto
books. I bought my vanagon shop manual there in great shape for $60,
covers 80-91. I'm going to keep looking for an older copy that just has
the air cooled vanagons at used book stores, that seems like the better
version, less hunting through water cooled info.(No offense intended.) 

	Automotive Books
	1830 12th
	Seattle, WA 98122
	(206)323-6719

	This shop gets Bentley manuals and other VW books.  They will mail
out orders.  They also buy books, but they will only pay about $20 for a
Bentley manual for vanagons, better to sell it to other members of the
list.  If I find a cheap one I'll pass it a long.

	I am not associated with the above companys.

&gt; Hi All~
&gt;         Sorry to clutter this list with such a basic question for all you
&gt; pros. I am looking for a good source (ie name, phone or address) of a place
&gt; to pick up a copy of the Bentley manual. I have an '81 if that helps.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks~
