Subject: Surf Results

No, not from the beach (I wish)

Had some time off for bad behavior (sick! In summer even ...)

I surfed around, and came up with some neat stuff that people might
want to look at. I will be forwarding a bunch of it here.

If you wanna buy, sell, or fix you VW, some of these places might
help. No, I dont work for any of them (Another 'I wish')
