Subject: Re: Any musicians out there?


Have any other wind players had the courage or gall to strike up the
band at a campsite?

    Well, I'm no musician, so I haven't played in a campsite, but recently
    my family visited my in-laws at a Thousand Trails and the folks across
    the way had a band that played ALL day 9am to 10pm.  It was a kinda
    country stuff with banjo's etc.  Anyway, they had amps and everything.
