Subject: Having one of those days..................

Well I returned home today from a short business trip to find a letter 
from my VW dealership.  Seems the 2 year extended warranty I purchased 
from them was declined by the underwriters of the warranty company.  
Something about the age of the vehicle.  (1984 Westy)  So feeling a bit 
like cleaning I walk out to the garage to find what at first seemed to 
be a puddle from the recent rains.   Hmmmm......must be raining green 
antifreeze......!   You guessed it.   Looks like antifreeze coming from 
the right head gasket.   Oh well.....    Anyone know the name of a good 
mechanic in the sacramento area?   I'd like to donate some money to them 
in return for a van that doesn't leave puddles in my garage.

Scott


As for the extended warranty....   Has anyone else experienced something 
like this?
