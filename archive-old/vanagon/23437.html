&gt;&gt;I actually had one mechanic tell me that the VW fuel lines
&gt;&gt;are designed to be used without clamps-- they grip tightly
&gt;&gt;due to their flexibility, he said, and therefore you shouldn't
&gt;&gt;put clamps on them.
&gt;
&gt;I'm almost 100% positive that VW didn't originally put clamps on them 
either.
&gt; My 1600DP (all original) in my bug didn't have clamps on the fuel lines 
when
&gt;I got it.  I asked the original owner and he said there never were any.
&gt; However, I agree with you that they SHOULD have clamps.



VWs came without fuel-line clamps, unlike most other cars.

VWs with smoke/fire scars coming out of the engine vents, have been
a common sight for years-- again, unlike most other cars.

Naah, no reason to suspect a cause-and-effect relation here.  ;)
$1.59 is too much to spend on clamps anyway.
