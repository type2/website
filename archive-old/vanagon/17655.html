Subject: RE: ultimate kewl camp. accessory

I've seen an old version of these on a Mercedes-Benz no less, ancient diesel 
with 6 trillion miles on it. It was mounted over the trunk though, and 
folded toward the rear/ground I think. Never saw it in action.   tim s.

OK... anyone top this? A single cab Vanagon with a slide-in (pop-top) camper 
back, North American style. At a campsite in Spain, really clean 
fit/looks/quality.
The ultimate vehicle: a Syncro Club Cab with slide-in Westy option!
