Subject: Fuel Tank Overflow Hoses

The recent discussion on &quot;gas mileage&quot; prompted me to pose the folowing:

Shortly after purchasing my '80 Westy in '88, I filled the gas tank and then
parked in a sloped parking lot in Northern Vt. When I came out there was gas
all over the pavement. Quite conserned as I was in the middle of nowhere
on a camping trip - I proceeded with caution and took the Westy directly to
my service shop upon returning homr (I am not set up to do my own repairs!).

I was advised that the fuel tank overflow hoses and system had cracked and
needed to be replaced - I had two options:
     - never fill the tank completely
     - drop the tank and replace the hoses and fittings
As this was to be a long term relationship - I did the latter at approx $150

Then, In May of '95 I purchased a &quot;new&quot; '91 Westy with 10,500 orig one-owner
miles on her. Garaged most of her life I took her to my service shop and had
a full check up done - including a check of all hoses, belts, etc. She checked
out with flying colors. In fact I had to polish the drool off of her after I
left the shop!

By late August, the same gas leaking from the overflow hoses appeared! Dismayed
I took her in to the quality dealership I had begun to use (my old shop had 
developed an attitude against Westy owners saying &quot;most of them don't want to
pay what it costs to hae us do the job right - ie they're all cheap! I don't
like to deal with bad attitude - it lowers my level of trust!) My new service
manager delivered the same news as with my '80. I really couldn't believe it!
Was this a problem with Westies in general? He said that they had only seen a
few cases - and of course the fact that the Van had been driven so little
probably did have an effect. I waited till spring - just didn't fill the tank
completely - and had the same work done. Surprisingly the dealership charged
less in '96 than I had been charged from the smaller local shop back in '89!

So - is this a problem that any of you have experienced or heard much about?
If so - how can it be avoided? As I am trying to buy yet another '91 Westy
I would prefer to avoid having to do this particular service again.

Thankx
