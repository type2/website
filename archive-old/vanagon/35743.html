Subject: Euro-Winnebago Complaint (long)

I want to share with the list my correspondence with VWOA 
about the deficient heating/defrosting systems in my new 
Eurovan Winnebago camper.

You can judge for yourself the quality of the response.

My letter to VW ...


Dear Sir/Madam:

re: Defrosting/Heating System Eurovan Winnebago VIN 
WV2ZB0252JH048419

We are writing to express our dissatisfaction with the 
defrosting and heating systems in our new Eurovan Camper.  
The systems are so deficient in the Canadian climate that we 
believe that they constitute a safety hazard.  The vehicle 
has been evaluated by OWASCO, and the Service Department 
there has confirmed that the defrosting and heating meet the 
factory specification.  Accordingly, we are writing to you.

In our experience, despite careful attention to the 
directions in the Owner's Manual (pp. 78 - 93), it is 
impossible to demist the windows when the ambient 
temperature is -10ºC or less.  In more severe weather such 
as -20ºC, the inside surfaces of the side windows are 
actually covered in a layer of ice. When outside 
temperatures are -20ºC temperatures at foot level, even in 
the front, are as low as 0ºC.  Any passengers in the rear 
seat are typically wearing a sleeping bag – this in a 1995 
vehicle!
The driver is armed with a windshield scraper.

We note that, unlike the non-camper Eurovan, there is no 
rear auxiliary heat exchanger or fan,  nor is there a floor 
mounted air outlet.  (We anticipate that the air 
conditioning in the camper will be as deficient as the 
heating.)  Furthermore, the outlets shown at the base of the 
windshield in the graphic on Page 84 of the owner's manual 
are missing.  

Our primary concern is safety.  Being unable to clear 
windows is very dangerous.  Our second concern is comfort.  
No one should have to huddle for warmth in a vehicle costing 
in excess of $40,000.

We believe that Volkswagen's cold weather testing of this 
vehicle was seriously flawed.  A van of this size clearly 
requires an auxiliary heat exchanger.  We would like your 
response to our comments as soon as possible.  


Yours sincerely, 

Dan Herbert

P.S.  Our two previous vehicles were VW Westfalias.  The 
1988 Wasserboxer had a terrific heating system (and leaky 
head gaskets).

Dear Mr. Herbert

Thank you for your correspondence dated January 14, 1996 
regarding your concerns about the design and serviceability 
of your vehicle.  We apologize for the inconvenience that 
this matter has caused.

We appreciate your taking the time to share your thoughts 
with us, as letters such as yours keep us in touch with the 
customer's point of view.  It is only through information 
received directly from Volkswagen owners that we can 
determine where improvements, extensions, or changes might 
be required.

We share your concerns regarding the difficulties you have 
experienced with your defrosting and heating systems in your 
Eurovan Camper.  Repairs are never welcome.  While we cannot 
guarantee every  vehicle will be defect free, it is our 
belief that, should a defect occur, it will make itself 
evident well within the terms of our limited new vehicle 
warranty.

We want to assure you that by taking the time to write, your 
concerns about the design of the defrosting and heating 
systems will be noted by the appropriate departments within 
our company.  We have taken the liberty of forwarding a copy 
of your correspondence to our Product Planning Department.

Please be advised that one of our highest priorities is 
customer satisfaction, and we make every effort to provide 
reliable products and service to our customers.  Thank you 
for taking the time to write, and for allowing us the 
opportunity to respond to your concerns.

Sincerely,

Anne M. Talan
Customer Relations Representative
