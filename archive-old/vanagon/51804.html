   After suffering through two weeks of tempertures in the teens and 20's 
(I was expecting this funny thing called fall) without a functional 
heater fan, I'll be venturing into the deepest, most inaccessable bowels 
of my Vanagon to replace it this weekend.
   I have another frozen fan, that I had removed from my parts van and 
I'm trying to work on it in the comfort of my heated office.  I've 
managed to crack the housing open and have removed the two little clips 
holding the fan in the plastic housing.
   At this point I've become stuck, or rather, the fan motor is stuck.  
It seems that the fan would pull out, away from the cage, but it won't.  
It would also seem that the cage would also pull off of the shaft, it 
won't.  WD-40 has loosened up the fan a bit, but I'd like to get in 
closer for a better cleaning, or to replace it with the good rear heater 
motor that I have.

    Thanks,
