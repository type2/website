Subject:       Re: Hatch gas springs

&gt; 
&gt; I went by my local Oldsmobile-Cadillac-VW dealer for a hatch gas spring
&gt; today (couldn't wait for the next trip to Houston) and asked the man at the
&gt; parts counter for a right hatch strut for a Vanagon.  He asked me if that
&gt; was a model of Oldsmobile.
&gt; 
&gt; duh
&gt; 
&gt; Then he asked me if it was a suspension part.
&gt; 
&gt; I think VW has a problem in this town.    :-(

Sounds like Monty's Chev-Jeep-Olds-GMC-Buick-VW... in Victorville Ca.
&quot;Syncro? made by VW? &quot;They don't make four wheel drives.&quot; &quot;Vanagons 
don't have CV joints on the front axel.&quot; We've never seen one, but 
bring it in and we'll work on it&quot;.  You can see where this went...
CLICK. I have never called or gone there ever again. Luckly this was 
the first time I had called them... I bet they have one guy there 
that has a German last name. If he's German, he will work on the VW's 
that come in...
