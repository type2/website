Subject:       To wear a bra or not to wear a bra, that is the question!

&gt;      I found a wolf brand with a fleece backing for 50 dollars (cheaper 
&gt;      than other places I've called)
&gt;      
&gt;      any experience ?

Though my question is not directly related, I am curious to find out 
the list's conensus on bras on new cars.

I just bought a new Legacy wagon after the unfortunate demise of the 
old Quattro, and already have a couple of chips on the front of the 
hood.

I have a real problem with the plastic bug guards on cars (less so 
with the new aerodynamic ones).

I've heard that bras will scrath your paint as the vibrate on the 
car.  I don't know anyone personally who has one, so I've not been 
able to examine one personally.

What's the verdict?  Will it scratch the heck out of the car?  I wash 
the car at least once a week by hand (my personal form of 
relaxation.), and wouldn't expect too much dirt accumulation under 
there.

If anyone has _any_ suggestions, I'd love to hear.  I'm &gt; &lt; that 
close to going out and plopping down the $150 for one.  Every time I 
get near a gravel truck spewing gravel on the freeway I cringe.
