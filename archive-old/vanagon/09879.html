Subject: William Warburton just called me!!!!

 ... from CHILE!  

	In case some of you weren't around at the time, William and his SO,
who are from the U.K. left several months ago for a tour of the Americas.
They have been roaming South America for some time, and are planning on
making their way up to the States in early May, buying a VW camper, and
participating in the GNATT/TOGA tour which starts on May 19th!

	We didn't talk long (I'm sure the call was costing him a fortune)
but he did confirm that he was still planning on participating in the
big trip and was still on schedule.  Is this kewl or what??
