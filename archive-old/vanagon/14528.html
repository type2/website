&gt;Not so much selling out as trying to be noticed.
&gt;Mr. Biff Yuppie always thought that VW vans were ugly so when he and
&gt;his wife Buffy Yuppie popped out a couple of yupplets they looked into
&gt;the North American Mini-van line and completely ignored the VWs.
&gt;By trying to look a little more ( a lot more in some opinions ) like
&gt;these American mini-craps they hoped to be able to get into that market
&gt;but still hold on to us VW lovers by offering a superior product.
&gt;
&gt;They should have kept the Vanagon as well though. IMO(NS)HO

my exact thoughts...thank you
