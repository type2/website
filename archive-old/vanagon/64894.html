Speaking from the experience of seal replacement and manufacturing since
1976, I would advise not re-using your old seal, if at all possible.  The
reason is that portions of the rubber have both expanded and contracted
over all this time and may not seal properly to the body and the glass
when re-installed.  A new seal is always best.  But, if you're on an
extreme budget, temporary use of a glass sealer adhesive may get you
through the winter, maybe not.

Yes, the new seal is rather expensive as they only come out of Germany
(In fact, WCM gets them from the local dealership [they won't admit it
though! - I do myself when I have to]).  Probably the best price for this
would be Camelback VW in Phoenix, AZ as I believe they give listmembers
20 percent off the regular price (don't forget to tell them!).

I am in the process of developing tooling (at a budgeted cost of around
$15,000.00 [including first production pieces order]) for the windshield
and other window seals (No chrome style)for the Vanagon, but due to
testing and that dreaded Italian disease (myfundsarelow), I probably
won't be able to get them to market until this winter.  Projected price
for this seal (in good quality pure EPDM) should be around $49.00.  Check
out the Website for the latest news that I will be posting in a couple of
weeks.

In the meantime - I would source it from Camelback (800) 876-5199

&gt;Hi Volks,
&gt;
&gt;Anybody shopped around for the front windshield rubber seal lately?
&gt;Any
&gt;comments? Prices?
&gt;
&gt;WCM lists about $107!! Geez, I just bought one for the '71 Rustfalia
&gt;for
&gt;about $20!!!
&gt;
&gt;What about using the old one? I'm replacing the windshield in the '85
&gt;because it is cracked REAL bad. The old seal looks fine, but...
&gt;
&gt;Thanks!
&gt;
&gt;ps - good to be driving a brick again :-)
