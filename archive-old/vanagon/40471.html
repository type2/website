Subject: Weird brakes


  Since the van has come out of winter hibernation I have noticed that the 
brakes are more resistant and slow.  I am detecting a slight vibration (up and 
down) as I apply the brakes.  They were fine before the big ugly freeze began. 
 Is this perhaps a result of sitting through a nasty winter or is something 
up?  BTW, it snowed like crazy here today :P  TIA for any info and thanks to 
all for the Westfalia lettering info.  Sorry about my misspelling 
earlier(westphalia)--I must have been phreaking out.
