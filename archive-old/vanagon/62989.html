Subject:      Aux Battery for 84 Westy

We just bought a 84 Westy and are very pleased with it.

It is in great condition, but after our first trip, we
are finding some things that we want to add or change.

The big item is an Aux Battery.  I looked around a bit and
so far have not found any battery that is short enough to
fit in that small space.  I assume that VW sells one but have not
checked the cost yet.
Does anyone know of a good source for a battery that would fit?
