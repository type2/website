Subject: Anyone for Buses, Beer, Blues in Memphis next week?

I'm heading to Jackson TN next week on business and am going to try 
to meet some of the guys, Ken Hooper, Joe Fournier, etc. if they are 
interested in Memphis, for a little bit of Buses, Beer, and Blues 
(BB King's for instance?), would be a neat thing if anyone else is in the
mood and close enough.  I'm thinking Tuesday or Wednesday evening
at about 7 pm or so.
