Subject: Re: That '87 for sale in Los Banos

&gt;VW didn't introduce the Multivan model in the USA until 1990.   Did they have
&gt;them in Canada before that?

you got me, I don't know!  I'd assumed all models available from beginning 
of the line.  I can't figure out what else he's looking at! Sorry, no help 
there.
