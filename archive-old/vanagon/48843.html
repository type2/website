 Hi,
 The oil pressure light on my '89 Vanagon is worrying me a little.  After I
 have been driving on the freeway ~65-70 mph for a few miles and then slow
 down to an idle (~800 RPM) the oil pressure light comes on intermittently.
 If I increase the RPMs to ~1,000 the light goes off.  I've checked the oil
 ..  What's the problem? &gt;&gt;


Oil getting to hot, high level, wrong viscosity, tired engine, etc.  If you
are usiong 10-30, this can happen, especially with high mileage engine.  May
also be a bad switch but I doubt it.

Dennis.
