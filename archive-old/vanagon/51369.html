Sean,

The Bosch catalog lists points thru 1980.  I think the black box is a
junction box.  To be sure, send me the part number and I will look in the
price sheet.  Also, if you give me your engine number we can check on the year.

 Was it just
&gt;California Vanagons that had Hall effect stuff or has mine been
&gt;converted?  BTW, there is a mysterious black box that sits on the left
&gt;side of the engine compartment, right in the stream of air from the left
&gt;side air scoop.
