&gt;y'all with dualport 1600cc ingins in your bus can respond to this one.
&gt;What is your top freeway speed(on flat ground), and how often do you go
&gt;through ingins?

well ... my old 71 bus used to cruise along nicely at 65-70 mph, back in the
days when the interstates had REAL speed limits. :)  but upon reflection, i
think it would have been better all round to just lower that about 5mph.

the engine ran fine from brand new to 88,000 miles ... whereupon #3 exhaust
valve broke (because i didn't read the books right: vans need valves replaced
at 70,000 miles. i was trying to make it to 100,000 miles, like the beetles).

i would say that you are probably just trying to take care of a classic car
and the rest of the world is in too big of a hurry to dispose of all their
money and cars. :)
