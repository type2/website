Subject: Carat dash clock source?

My newly-purchased '91 Carat has a digital dash clock, which is fine,
but which is set to the wrong time, which is less fine.  Unfortunately,
the two little buttons on either side of it do nothing.  Asked the VW
dealer to check it out while doing other things, and he said it'd just
have to be replaced - for $251.  I don't think so.  Anyone have a
cheaper source for new/used ones?  I know I could replace it with a
stick-on clock for $1.00, but the Carat's still got that new feel (to
me, anyway) and I'd like to keep it stock for a while.  (It's
back-lighted, too, which I like.)

Alternatively, has anyone observed and fixed this problem before?
