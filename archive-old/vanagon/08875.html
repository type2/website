Subject: Rear Bumper Wanted - '78 CHROME

Hi, I'm looking for a chrome rear bumper for my '78 Westy. Any tips and 
leads appreciated.  If you have one, I will share some of my insurance 
windfall with you (if it ever arrives!).  I was rear ended and was blown 
away to find out that the chrome bumpers are a limited edition deal for 
'78s only (is this really true?), making them out of sight new and not 
available (apparently?) after-market. 

Thanks alot,
Tim
