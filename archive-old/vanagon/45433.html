Subject: (fwd) WTB: Vanagon 1.9L engine
From: harris_at_pcix_dot_com (Harris Upham)

Hi there!

A few of you know me.  I'm Harris from VW Bus Heaven in Massachusetts.

I'm posting this from my personal account, but this post does relate to VW
Bus Heaven. (we aren't online yet...  but give us a little time. &lt;g&gt;)

One of our customers is desperately seeking a Vanagon 1.9L engine for his 1985.

He drove several hundred miles to pick up a Vanagon Westfalia package that
he purchased from us, and on the way home he blew the engine.  He now
needs a serviceable 1.9 longblock, used.  A rebuilt would be an option if
cores were any cheaper, but that's simply not the case.

If you've got one, or you know somebody that's got one for sale, please
give us a call at 1-800-VW-TYPE-2.


Thanks!

Harris
