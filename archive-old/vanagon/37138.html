About this Amour-All stuff!

I was talking to a guy who details cars and he mentioned something
interesting to me.  He said that Amour-All has a high concentration of
Alcohol and therefore in the long run tended to shrink and crack rubber by
drying it out.  He said that once you started using it you began a vicious
cycle....an addiction if you will.  He suggested that pure Silicone was a
better way to preserve rubber.  This is by the way what VW recommended way
back along with this talc coating method.  Try this experiment:  clean your
old tired windshield wipers with Silicone and &quot;see&quot; the results!

Good Luck!
