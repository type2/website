Still trying after a couple of orders and years to get a catalog, 
unless of course the pitiful 4-5 page flyer is the catalog at which 
point I guess I already got one and Jim needs to get off the list and 
back to work.  Sorry Jim, you guys deserve this bit of ribbing, for 
the record, good company, good service, impossible to get on the 
phone, needs a catalog so people don't waste so much time tying up 
the phone lines.
