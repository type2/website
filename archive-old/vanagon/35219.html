Subject: Rear wheel bearing or CV problems on '80 V6anagon?


Oops-- I posted this with the wrong subject a minute ago. Sorry, all,
for the double posting.

Hi, all,

Anybody know what CV joint problems sound/look like on a Vanagon? I heard
some noticeable rattling from the right rear wheel of the '80 V6anagon the
other day. Stopped, grabbed the top of the tire, and shoved back and forth,
and heard more clacking, tho the tire didn't seem to be moving much.
Then grabbed the axle shaft, and found it moved in an out of the hub pretty
easily, a half inch or more. The other side moved slightly, but not much.
Is this normal?

I once killed a CV on my old '69 bus. It started making that classic
clicking sound going around corners, tho never the kind of harsh rattling
that the V6anagon occasionally makes now. I paid it no mind, until one day
I let out the clutch and the '69 bus went nowhere. It wasn't hard to
replace,
fortunately, once I got the socket-head nuts started (Craftsman Allen
wrenches are wonderful). I heard that the '80 Vgon CVs are the same part(?),
though the bolts are torx-head or some such.

Any of this sound familiar?
