Subject: Opinions of a VW Camper

Hello,

My husband and I have been looking for a VW camper.  We can't afford
at this time a very expensive one and we also want to make sure we will
use and enjoy one before spending lots of money.

This past weekend there was a listing in our local paper for a 
1978 VW Camper Deluxe
Near mint condition, new engine
$5600 firm.

I called about it and he said ...

the engine has 20,000 and is a rebuilt VW 2000cc with good torque
about 20miles to the gal.
Bought it when it was 6 months old and has kept very good care of it.
He used it to aid him in his free-lance photography work.  He has only
camped in it a few times and says that all the features work.
  All screens (some that have never been out of the box)
   ( I wouldn't know what all the screens would include.)
  a baby hammock
  tent
  pop-top
  sleeps four (small people)
  sink, refrig, stove w/ 2 burners
  fold out table
  4 seat belts, fronts have the non-extending shoulder strap.
  alarm, with a 2mile radius remote
  Mitch. XVX tires
  AM/FM stereo (maybe a CD)
  heat/air (I think)
  

I think the price is a bit high, but it does come with all useable equipment
and is semi  local, and should be clean :).  

Is this a high price and what kind of questions should I ask about the
performance and /or is there things I should know about this year
camper? 

I will have to drive a little bit to go look at it want some advise first.
Thank you in advance for any opinions.
