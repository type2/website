&gt;  Also, anyone going to the Farmington VW show this weekend? Ihave been
&gt;trying to get in touch with a campground near there, and perhaps anyone
&gt;else going could camp there...

Yes, I plan on going.  I'll be leaving Friday afternoon to go to Boone,
NC to visit friends there &amp; plan to camp Saturday night near Farmington.
I stayed at a campground within 10 miles of Farmington last year.  Plan
to parts hunt saturday if you have any hints on where to find &quot;treasure&quot;.

Keep an eye out for me, I'll be in a '77 Chrome Yellow Westfalia.

Dave
