Subject: General List Info.

Item Subject: Text_1
     Hi All,
     
       I have some fellow Vanagineers who would like some general info on 
     this list.  Looks like I have deleted the electronic files I was sent 
     when I signed up to the list.  Could someone send me it or a primer on 
     what the list is and how to access it.
     
     TIA,
     
     Vince 
     
     PS.  I promise this time to save the info. to disk this time.
