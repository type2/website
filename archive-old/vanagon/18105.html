Markus,

If you've no other symptoms, accept your oil pressure as read; it is within
the normal range for the instruments and engine described.

Regarding your poor idle, if you've performed all the usual checks of timing
and carb adjustment then it's most likely the carb is telling you it would
like to have its back scrubbed.  If you're running the stock Solex, be sure
to let the carb body soak at least 24 hours in the carb cleaner, use tiny
nylon bristle-brushes and compressed air to insure the idle by-pass ports are
clear.  

If cleaning the carb shows signs of contaminants such as rust, inspect &amp;
clean the filter in your fuel pump; it's often overlooked.
