&gt; yellow pages. :(

  Joel, you're bored? How 'bout helping me solve an insignificant mystery? The
  Haynes manual I have indicates that all European and UK Type IV engined 
  buses have Sodium cooled valves. Bentley, which covers only U.S. spec buses
  shows only the '73 and '74 1.7 and 1.8 liter engines as having them. 
  Incidentally, they are also the only models to have exhaust afterburning
  courtesy of air injection. Is there a connection? Were Sodium cooled valves
  just a fad? Do all the European buses use them, even though they have never
  had to deal with all that air injection plumbing? I thought one of your 
  many books might help clear this up. If you don't feel like it, don't 
  bother - I'm probably the only person on the planet who's curious about this.
  But if you are bored...?

  Thanks,
