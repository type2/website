Subject: Re: Cost of restoring '67?

Whew! Steve Johnson really stepped in &quot;it&quot; when he said:

 I definately don't plan on doing a quick job like Matthew or Thom, but I
know I can do it in a fair amount of time. 

He then proceeded to step on my &quot;hot button&quot; when he said:
 There's not a big rush but** if it takes more than two years, I would think
I wasn't trying hard enough.**

HONK!!!
Two years in April since I bought the '67 Westy Resto from &quot;Heck&quot; (It's a
Holy weekend so I'll defer). The bus has eaten more of my time and resources
than I can mention (or could have imagined at the outset)! Constant pushing
to get this puppy on the road has beat me up and muffed up nearly every
aspect of my life. I now hope to have it on the road by May-June. I'd like
to mess them up at the SOTO/Classic Weekend or wait until the Jamboree. A
definite show up at the Escondido thing in August. Trying hard enough!
Someone definitely hasn't been through the mill yet!
There is a definte difference between a mediocre paint job and a freshened
engine and a thorough &quot;ground up restoration&quot; where literally EVERY part is
disassembled and R&amp;Red! I highly doubt that Thom and Matthew or I have  been
doing a &quot;quick&quot; once over. In your defense I don't think you really meant to
infer that Thom and Matt are in that category. Your fingers definetly MUST
have slipped.
