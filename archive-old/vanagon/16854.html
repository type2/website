Don't they make a special little puller for this that self
extracts the pin out, assuming the pin is hollow ala Type 1
the gizmo has a sleeve bigger than the pin, you put a cap head
bolt through, and tighten the bolt against the pin, against the
far side of the tube/receptacle pressing the pin out.
