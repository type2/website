I suggest selling your '85 bus for a later model Multivan or
dare I say it? a Eurovan with similar features as the Multivan?

The Multivan was a good trade-off from the camper if you had
to use it as a bus too.  Pop-top and foldout bed so you can
sleep 4.  I think it had(s) the optional electric fridge option
too.  There's a fold out table too.  That's the way I'd go if
I had to haul a crew around.
