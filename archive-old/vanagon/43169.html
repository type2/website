Subject: A bug squashed on a bus....

I just picked up a book on restoring busses a week or so ago, and 
one of the photos they had in it was of a black bus/red trimmings with
the upper half of a bug on the top-blended right in. This one faced forward-
they left the windshield wipers operating and the wing windows as
well..

&gt;Wow!
&gt;
&gt;Hey friends....
&gt;
&gt;You wouldn't believe...uh..strike that...maybe you would....Anyway, on the way
&gt;back to Santa Rosa from San Francisco today (I drive a bread route)I caught a
&gt;glimpse of the most amazing thing:  No, it wasn't a Thing, but it sure was
&gt;wierd!
&gt;
&gt;This particular beastie looked to be a breadloaf bus, garishly painted (looked
&gt;good!) with the top of a Bug welded on.....rear first, and all windows intact.
&gt;This strange creation whizzed by the other direction to quickly for me to get a
&gt;good look, but from what I could see, it was cool!
&gt;
&gt;If somebody knows of this, or if the owner is on the list, tell us what you've
&gt;done!
