So Ron Van Ness says:

&gt; Hi folks,
&gt; 
&gt; I previously had.  The one I had seems to be expressly tailored to VW
&gt; dealers as the instructions and pictures indicate installation and use in a
&gt; VW.  The latest manuals I received don't mention VW and I think were meant
&gt; for a broader audience.
       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

'Bout time us fat people had something useful catered to us. :)

&gt; Jack Reed did mention to me that when he called the people he talked to
&gt; (including the manager) claimed they did not have any documentation and that
&gt; they had no parts for old heaters.    

Uh... Is Jack fat?   Maybe that's why they didn't wanna give him one.  ;p

Yup,  Friday is muvin' right along.....
