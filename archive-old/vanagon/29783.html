&gt;  It will be more work than the Porsche, but way less less cash to go
&gt;     with an non-turbo Audi, which offers several advantages.  The engines
&gt;     are silky smooth and bulletproof, often going 200K without the heads
&gt;     off. They are also unappreciated, available from a wrecker for
&gt;     something like $700. They produce about 35% more horsepower and torque
&gt;     than stock VW, but this is not excessive and should not damage
&gt;     powertrain components. The maximum torque is available at 4000 rpm, at
&gt;     18mph/1000 rpm in 4th gear, the vehicle should cruise right up those
&gt;     mountain passes at illegal speeds. Of course, it is water cooled, so
&gt;     no heater problem.
&gt;
&gt;     The problems are the fit. First, we know that some Vanagons were sold
&gt;     outside the US with this or a similar engine. Perhaps bellhousings are
&gt;     available, or maybe we need an adapter.  We know the engines are not
&gt;     too long. Other problems might be height (we can tilt it a bit, if
&gt;     necessary) and depth for Syncros, which  have a system of steel beams
&gt;     and plates under the powertrain for offroad protection, this could
&gt;     interfer with a stock oilpan. The Transplant Task Force has a couple
&gt;     of volunteers interested in design and custom machining of the
&gt;     required parts.

Yeah, I think &quot;fit&quot; is probably a bigger problem than you might think.
 Regarding the length and your statement that &quot;We know the engines are not
too long&quot;, they're not too long in the Vanagon diesel application because the
transmissions were mounted further forward with the axles canted backwards to
reach the normal wheel locations.  This arangement was said to create
additional stress on the CV joints beacuse of the need to continouusly cycle
through a high angle range.  When the wasserboxer was announced VW made a
point of mentioning this.  The axles were probably even longer to reach the
proper location.  
Also you say, &quot;we can tilt it a bit, if necessary&quot;.  I think that the diesels
were tipped over at about 50 degrees to clear the decklid.  This is far more
than &quot;a little bit&quot;.

I think that the fitment problems of any in-line engine are significant.  The
wasserboxer is about 2.5 cylinders long.  The Rabbit/Jetta engines are 4
cylinders long and the Audi engines are about twice as long as the
wasserboxer at 5 cylinders.  I see the only more difficult engine to fit than
the 5 would be an in-line 6.  I think it might be wise to keep in mind flat
or V engine configuration engines.  

The flat ones of course are ideal for an easy fit, but other than Porsche &amp;
VW, there's only Subaru.  Subaru has both flat 4s and flat 6es.  Their newest
4cyl is 2.5 liters and makes about 155HP.  I know, I know, it's not VW/Audi.
 It's not German. It's not even European or American!  But, all thing
considered it might be the best alternative.  I think Syncros should be able
to live with 155HP.

Then there are V6 engines from every (almost) automaker on the planet.  The V
configuration has 2 significant advantages over the in-line engines. 
1. Their cylinder banks are already tilted over thus being lower than an
in-line engine without cocking them at some extreme angle.  I think most ar
60 degree Vs (each cylinder bank tilted 30 degrees from vertical), but a 90
degree V6 would be easier to fit.  I don't know specifically if there are any
90 degree V6es.  I do know that V8s are made in both 60 and 90 degree
configurations.
2. The length of a V6 is 3.5 cylinders - only 1 cylinder longer than the
wasserboxer.  Some small V6 may exist that would fit lengthwise without
having to move the transmission forward at all - a big advantage.

Well, there's my two cents worth.  I know both the flat &amp; V solutions are far
from the Vanagons roots, but realistically speaking seem the most plausable.
