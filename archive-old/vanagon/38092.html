Subject: Re: EV Westy spotted?

&gt; 	I saw a strange EV on the freeway last night.  It had a pop top, but
&gt; something was different about it.  After a couple minutes of staring I
&gt; noticed that it was a panel van, not the regular windowed EV half-assed
&gt; Westy.  This EV had a two-paned louvered (?) window on the drivers side and
&gt; no other windows behind the cab.  Could this be a full blown Eurovan
&gt; Westfalia?  I thought they weren't selling those over here in the US...

GROWL!!!!

There is a Weekender which is NOT a half assed Westy.  It is a different 
purpose vehicle.  Great for overnights or picnics.  Not meant for 
vacation.  The Weekender is built on the regular body MV seven 
passenger.

What you saw was either a Westfalia Camper (if older) or a Winnebago 
Camper (if newer).  The Winnie conversion is built on an extended body 
panel/kombi type.  Except I think it has more than a single rear window...

Now show me a Westafalia Camper that seats seven.  Get the one you need....
