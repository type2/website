Subject: Martha's having server problems
Date: Tue, 3 Jan 95 13:55:11 PST

Just talked to Martha and her service provider is having
problems so she can't read anything today.  She asked me
if I would let you folks know so you'd know why she isn't
responding.  She was told by her provider that her service
should be up tomorrow.

Some things she wanted to forward to the list were:

* Be sure to bring firewood cause if ya don't it's expensive
  at the campground and were definitely going to need it.

* If you have an early 80's Westy, please bring the key(s) for
  the utility access flaps.  She needs one that fits her van. 

* She wants you to know that she'd like to do a Saturday breakfast
  too and would like contributions such as: bacon, ham or other
  breakfast items.  She's going to do pancakes.  I don't know
  if she needs ingredients for that or not but I'll find out.

* Be sure to let the rangers at the entrance to the park that
  you're with the Vanagon/VW group and would like a spot that's
  near there.  If you're early, Martha wants us oriented close
  to the bathrooms.

If you have any questions for Marth, she said to post her home
phone number: (510)376-4321.

I also found out that the forcast for the lows this weekend in
Pfeiffer will be 35F - 45F.  Not too bad if you have an adequate
sleeping bag.  The propane burners won't care.  The Canadians/
North USA residents would probably think it's balmy. ;)

Cheers!

Steven
