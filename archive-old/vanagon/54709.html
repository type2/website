&gt; A currently off-list member asked me about the cylinder numbering on
&gt; the w/b, which is of course the same as all VW boxers, right?
&gt; 
&gt; So, wanting to be certain about this, I checked the Bentley. It gives
&gt; the firing order as 1-4-3-2 (I think, same as the inline 4s, right),
&gt; but nowhere could I find reference to what cylinder is where.
&gt; 
&gt; I think it's 1-3 &amp; 2-4 for left &amp; right side, front to rear, but just
&gt; need to know for sure.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks.
&gt; 
&gt; ps: For you old hands who can adjust valves in your sleep, just
&gt; consider this humurous Friday content, ok?
