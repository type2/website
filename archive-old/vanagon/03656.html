Subject: RE: How to Steal VW Vans Quickly

&gt; I think that the motion detectors should be outlawed.  Who cars if the car 
&gt; wiggles.
&gt; 
&gt; Its called crying &quot;wolf&quot; (Wolfsburg?)
&gt; 
&gt; And then the car alarms with the &quot;voice&quot;: 'You are too close to the vehicle...'

When it snows here, I like going out to the college and making a bunch of
snowballs, and playing `car alarm, car alarm, who's got the car alarm'. 
Great for breaking the ice/snow on boring days.
