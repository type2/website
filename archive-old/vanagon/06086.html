There is nothing &quot;warm&quot; about Yosemite or Sequoia in winter. I'm about
to graduate (no, I mean it this time... honest) and my wife and I are
planning a trip through the Southwest. We don't plan on being warm until
we hit the Mojave Desert, even with the L.L. Bean longjohns. I know the
California Desert is not centrally located, but hardly nothin' can beat
the Kelso Dunes or the Devil's Playground in winter. Just a suggestion.
