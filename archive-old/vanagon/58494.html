Ron Lussier has a tire FAQ under &quot;Info&quot;, try http://www.vanagon_dot_com/

This is pretty much the consolidation of the interminable list
discussions;
it confirms Tim Smith's (and my ) opinion: stay away from the regular
185/14. 

IMHO, I much prefer data built on experience of this list, as opposed to
databases built for the sole purpose of fostering sales of items in a
companies warehouse.
