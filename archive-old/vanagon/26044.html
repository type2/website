Subject: Re: heater blower project

     For my air-cooled bus I put an inline fan from a FIAT in the flow from 
     the centre heat duct. This meant that the hot air was blown by the 
     engine and sucked by the fan, and also that the fan could be swithed 
     on straight away to defrost the windows.
