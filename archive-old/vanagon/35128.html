Subject: Re: Split US spec bumper bit wanted

david, just talked with wolfsberg west about there repro bumper parts.  
for the front over-ridder, they want $87.50.  the rears are $48.50 each.  
the sort of chuckled when i asked for shipping charges to england.  they 
said that karmman konnection had ordered some and so did john abbot at 
Java Imports.  (tel #  121 554 7963, in westmiddlands)  that would 
probably be the best place to check on it.   if you need them sent over, 
i can help if you need it.  let me know what happens.

take care and God Bless
matt
