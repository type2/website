Subject:       splitting hairs

I would like to express my gratitude for everyone and anyone who 
has worked and taken their time to help me out with a question or with 
the list.  This includes Gerry obviously but a lot of other people 
too.  I've enjoyed this list, but it sounds like time to move on. 


Anybody used to moving on?


If Gerry would like the list split, great!
It's his list. I don't think we need to split hairs.


It would be interesting to see who would go where....Hey Joel, this 
sounds like a Stats question. Based on who owns what maybe?
