Subject: Re: Golf/Jetta engine in gas Vanagon

Volks list,


Has anyone used a smaller than 1.8 engine in a diesel/gas conversion..such as 			
a 1.7 or 1.6 engine....from what I have read the transmission has a very 
low gear with the diesel engine...would this help if a smaller engine was
used?

				Thanks Brian
