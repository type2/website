     Well, as of Friday evening, I have definate positive responses from
the following:
  Skip Correll (possibly) Chattanooga TN
  Scott Hoover - Somewhere in NC
  Pete Sellers (possibly)
  David Easterwood - Atlanta
  Stefan Ufer - Chapel Hill NC
  Victor (gt4281b_at_prism.gatech_dot_edu) Atlanta
  Frank Terhaar - somewhere in NC

Others have expressed past interest, so if you do not see your name
here, please do respond soon. Also, at least one communal meal has been
suggested. Perhaps some suggestions for that? Perhaps two, a breakfast
and a dinner? Also, when are folks planning to arrive?(stressing that
gates do close at 6pm) Also , some regional caravaning has been
suggested.
  So, I vote to make this a definate plan, and thusly begin planning!
What fun, I can hardly contain myself! 
 (all past details are below...)




&gt;  Ok, I have seen so far a few people interested. George Washington's
&gt; Birthday weekend seems to be the time of choice. This is Friday Feb. 17
&gt; through possibly Monday, Feb. 20. Those interested would I suppose meet
&gt; Friday afternoon/evening, and others join when possible. Sorry to bother
&gt; those who have already replied yes, but please, let's get a sort of
&gt; final count and idea of times people could arrive. ( I will probably get
&gt; there Friday early afternoon, and remember, the gate closes at 6) Also,
&gt; should we dare to try a communal eating set-up?any ideas/volunteers for
&gt; that? Anyone bringing kids/dogs/guitars/anything else?  I am not much of
&gt; an organizer, so I'm sure I'm forgetting a lot. Please do respond, even
&gt; if you have already. Thank you all and have a lovely day. I have included
&gt; below all the information about the location, the Jordan Lake State Park.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;   So, there is ONE park open now, it is the Jordan Lake State Park. It
&gt; &gt; is on highway 64, around Apex, N.C. which is actually closer to D.C, and
&gt; &gt; around the same from the South.
&gt; &gt;   They have 100 spaces available now, 6 people per space (as many
&gt; &gt; vehicles as you can fit! ) and it's $9.00 for a regular space, and
&gt; &gt; $14.00 for a space with a power hook-up (this is per space, not per
&gt; &gt; person) The park gates are open 8 am - 6 pm, and the number for all
&gt; &gt; wishing further details is 1-919-362-0586. This is the park office, open
&gt; &gt; 9-5. As Isaid, this is on a lake, with trails to hike, etc. I have talked
&gt; &gt; to several people that have been there, and they all said it was nice.
