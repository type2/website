Subject: Re: 89 Vanagon 4spd Problem - Stuck in 3rd-

&gt;
&gt;My 89 Westy (100,000 mi) 4 spd recently stuck in 3rd gear and would not come 
&gt;out.  I crawled under the van, and worked the shift rod and linkage on the 

cracked synchroniser hub, for 3/4th gear shift by the sound of it.  I'd get 
it fixed asap. Tranny won't like munching on metal chunks if any get loose.
