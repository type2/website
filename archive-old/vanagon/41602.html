  OFFICE MEMO          It's curtains!!                        Date:5/8/96

Hi all
I want to put curtains up in the EV. Currently there are only these snap
thingies that the curtains attach to but I want REAL curtains, with a rod and
all that stuff. I think the EV winnies have real curtains but I'm not sure. 
Any suggestions?
Thanks!

Still leg weary from chasing Kent Bostick and the rest of the Shaklee boys
around all weekend. Watch out Seattle, they are coming your way (olympic
trials) : )
