Subject: Tire Recommendations for VW Buses

There seems to be some frustration on the lists about what tires are available for use on VW 
buses.

I contacted the Tire Rack and Max Jones forwarded the following recommended tires for use on 
VW buses:



Highway tire designs:
                                             LOAD

Disclaimer -- My intent is not to specifically recommend the Tire Rack as a source of tires.  
I have never done business with them previously, other than to buy some snow tires for a 
non-VW vehicle, which went fine.  My intent is only to provide you with this information for 
reference when you need to buy tires for your bus.

Comment about Conti tires -- I personally can not recommend the purchase of Conti 
(Continental) tires.  My experiences with their tires in the past where not a good ones.
