Sami:  So let me see if I understand.  You will install the heater fan as
soon as it gets warmer.  There's an old story about a leaky roof that needs
mending.  Only trouble is that when it's raining the roof is too wet to
fix, and when it's not raining it doesn't leak, so why fix it.  I
appreciate the irony here.
