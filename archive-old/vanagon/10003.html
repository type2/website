How did you find this out?

What do you mean you &quot;shut off&quot; the rear heater?
You can't really depend on the shutoff valve of that heater to totally 
shut it off, I don't think.

&gt; then I imagine it's a head gasket problem.  The odd thing is, the coolant 
&gt; reservoir never shows low.  NEVER.  Apparently all the air migrates.

Do you mean the expansion tank or the refill tank?
