Subject: Re: Exhaust Pipes 2.1 86and up!

&gt;  We've had all good ones since that One batch of Funky ones about 1 
&gt; year ago.
&gt; 
&gt;   I'm not sure if there was a New guy in the plant or ??
&gt; 
&gt;   I know that the cost of these pipes are alot less than the VW Pipes.
&gt; 
&gt;   I encurage any and All comments on this topic.
&gt; 
&gt;     I also know that the people with the 2.1 engines that have welded
&gt; and re-welded their pipes will be happy to see that there Is an
&gt; alternative to the Dealer Cost of the pipes!

I will add that my pipes were 1.9 from the exact era he mentions oddly
and I paid a HELL of a lot more than he is asking, so although as a
rule I hate a commercial interest in this list, thumbs up to Kyle, these
sound an excellent deal if the fit of mine were in fact the exception, 
I'm still leery though about Dansk.
