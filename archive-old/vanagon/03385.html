Subject: Re: Stuff Found in Busses

In my '76 Westy, while taking apart the cabinets, in a little corner
untouched since the van was built, I found a little &quot;Bier&quot; top. It was
Amstel. I've always fancied that the Westfalia workers left it there, but I
don't know if that particular brand is sold in Germany (even tho' it's an
import). I hope they enjoyed themselves building it, 'cause I sure enjoyed
driving it, and it's still with a good home.
Oh, I found a two foot long dull machete behind the cabinet too. Still have
it somewhere.
