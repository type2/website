Subject: Re: Gas heater boosters

I have (what I think is) the same heater you do, an Eberspacher BA6.  I'm
still in the process of doing some final tweaks to it to get maximum heat
without burning up the little propeller on the end of the combustion motor
fan.  You definitely needs this to maintain heat flow through the heat
exchanger and to prevent damage to the combustion motor itself.

The pipe in question (corrugated plastic, about 2.5' long) supplies combustion
air to the motor.  If this pipe were to come out of it's housing in the cross
member, it would be possible that suction on the end of the pipe caused by 
air moving past it at highway speeds would cause the flame to be pulled into
the combustion motor itself, rendering the motor scrap.

I've spent a lot of time with this heater.  If you have any questions, write
me at jreed_at_ag_dot_gov rather than the list.

Good luck.

Jack
