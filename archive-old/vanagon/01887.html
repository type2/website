Subject: Re: Eurovan/Winnebago - just

joel...The story I got from the dealer is that VW would be paying less
tariff on the truck model than on the finish camper so it was more
profitable for VW to ship the truck frames to Winne and have them outfit
them for the camper stuff. BTW, there isn't one dealer in the NYC metro area
that's an authorized EuroVan Camper retailer.
 
Sorry I haven't got around yet to doing that review on the article in the
R&amp;T Sport-Util, Pickup and Vans 94 Buyers Guide but in it John Matras claims
that &quot;Beginning in Summer 1995, the 1996 EuroVan will come only with VW's
VR6 engine.&quot; I think I'll wait for that before I get a new van. Also all the
safety stuff will be std by then...Joey
