Subject: F.S. Split Window Carcass

If only I had $500....

Driving through a new neighborhood today, I spotted a Splittie sitting in a yard
next to a double-cab splittie pickup and another Splittie that looked in good
shape, but I didn't peruse it much, as the carcass had  FOR SALE $500 signs
posted on a couple of its remaining windows.  I don't know if this is a good
price for a body with only a few windows, no lights, and a stripped down
interior, but there was no discernible cancer -- even the jack fittings were
pristine.  The thing was done up in gray primer and had some superficial rust,
both inside and out, but compared to the body on my Sunshine this bus was
showroom condition.

Anyway, to make a long story short, I didn't knock on the guy's door to find out
if any of the missing parts were included in the $500, but it looks like it
might have been a parts bus for his other two and now that he can't use any more
of it, he is trying to get it out from in front of his house.  But if anyone is
interested, I can go by his place tomorrow and talk to him (he didn't have a
phone number on the FS signs).

I REPEAT NO CANCER VISIBLE!!!!!!!!

peace and stuff,
terry &amp; Sunshine (she may be bent &amp; corroded, but she's got character)
