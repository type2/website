Subject: Vanagon Wheel Covers

Hi all,
Recently I offered up a few free (+shipping) Vanagon wheel covers and then
promised the first respondant that I'd send them to him.  After looking for
the covers, I can't find them!  I figured I'd be a little embarrased and let
the promisee know that I was not able to fulfill my promise (although they
might still turn up).  Then I run into a second problem. I can't find the
E-mail that had the listee's address.  So, instead of being a little
embarrassed in front of one listee, my whole pathetic story is out here for
everyone to read.

To whoever I promised to send wheel covers to:
I can't.  I'm sorry.
