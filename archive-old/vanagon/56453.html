&gt; Dear Listees, Would like to know if anyone else has had these symtoms,
&gt; 87 wb, while driving it has an intermittent miss,then it will go away
&gt; for several days,then comes back repeatedly. This is normally on
&gt; freeways, 60-65mph, will will also do it on stop and go driving,warm or
&gt; cold. Went through shop bulletins found that this problem could be
&gt; remedied by putting harness extension between air box,and did that for
&gt; $115. from dealer.Their input was also that it worked for many
&gt; customers. Still did same problem, no difference. Talked to Kyle at
&gt; Volks Cafe suggested ground at computer,went under seat and found
&gt; someone had alreadsy replaced ground wire, apparently had this problem
&gt; previous with old owner, borrowed a computer from friend, went 300
&gt; miles to Reno and back, no problems, took it out, miss is back. Any
&gt; body have computer part#025-906-082,or bosch #0-261-200-065, suppose to
&gt; be from any 86-on vanagon.Thanks Leonard _at_ AVP.

Try resoldering the two large resistors at the back of the computer.
These had steel leads that did not wet properly during computer
assembly. Might want to add a small amount of a good grade of electronic
solder flux.

A simple ten second resoldering usually fixes maddeningly intermittent
symptoms that thousands of dollars of dealer incompetence utterly and
totally fails to even find, let alone cure.

The mechanic at the Berge VW in Mesa AZ could not even **find** my
computer, let alone test it. while racking up a $1200 bill. And using
vise grips (!) on a brand new set of rear hatch gas springs, totaling
them.

I'm convinced the harness was total incompetence and VW did not have the
faintest clue what the real problem was. 

Similarly, on the airbox, you cut a *very* small hole in the plastic top
and squirt in some Radio Shack color tv tuner cleaner. While using a
pencil to cycle the air flap fairly vigorously hundreds of times. RESEAL
the hole with silicon glue. The fix is usually good for 40,000 miles and
can be repeated three or four times.

I am still looking for a late model, low mileage Synchro.
Preferably western but non Westy. With diff lock.
