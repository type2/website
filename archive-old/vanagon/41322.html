The Gerbil's right rear blinker stopped working today, so I just went
out to replace the bulb.  Get the lens off, and the bulb's fine.
Hmmm.  I open the engine compartment up to see what the backside of
the socket looks like, and get distracted.  There's this funny-looking
white and black plastic plate with three short cylinders sticking up
from it just laying there, halfway onto the right-side engine tin.
After a few seconds, I figure out that this plastic plate is one of
the two `permanent' covers from the battery.  The other cover is still
halfway on, but not looking exceptionally happy about staying there.
The negative cable was a little damp, so the cover must have popped
off while I was driving (must remember to sprinkle baking soda in
there).

I seated the covers as best I could, and plan on picking up a new
battery tomorrow (getting a ride from a friend).  Any ideas on what
might have caused this?  It's a little weird, even for the Gerbil....

Oh yeah.  The blinker.  The slip-on connector had slipped off.  The
geometry of the situation implies that it could have been when the
battery cover popped.

We now return you to the Twilight Zone.
