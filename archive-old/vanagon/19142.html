It sounds like people on the list have MUCH more cheerful stories.
I would like to hear more of people's experiences.

   I had a chance to drive to Ensenada to visit a friend of a friend,
   that's a shallow trip and it's all neatly paved highway. I got to
   Ensenada and took out my map, then realized that the streets didn't
   have street signs -- oh well. Everyone I met was gracious and pleasant,
   but you get what you give. If you're at RNS in Santa Barbara, maybe
   a weekend jaunt to Ensenada would be a good start. Avoid Tijuana
   entirely!
