Subject: Need quick ANSWER!!!!!!!!!!!!

HEY GUY&quot;S   I need to know what you people have decided is the right tire for
my '89 syncro .
TODAY if possible !!!!!
Had a flat today     went to Sears/Goodyear to get it fixed  and who was
there but the Customer
Service consultant    A  man named DANA THOMAS     organizer of the
Litchfield bugin  some
of you know him and he say's HELLO
Well I mentioned that I had the wrong tires put on by SEARS when the
originals needed replacin
He checked the puter and found a glitch in there tire data bank
The vanagon is listed as a passenger car  but the puter does'nt differentiate
between the sync
and the non sync    The syncro is a truck and needs truck tires . So the
computer identifies only
the regular van and recommends the wrong tires . This is also why
www.alldata_dot_com calls the
sync a truck . Because of this I may be getting either free tires or at least
a deal on new ones
because I can prove with Dana's help that sears installed the wrong tires
through there puter
error, thus endangering our lives and cause many trips to sears for flat tire
repair because the
tires would separate from the rims . But I need from you people the tire info
to tell Dana what to
order while he's here  so ASAP!!!! Also even though Sears has a customer sign
a form saying
they accept the tires ,   there is a implied trust from the custumer that the
correct tires will be put
on the vehicle and that trust that they were all knowledgable was broken !!!
I'll let you know how it turns out
ANSWER FAST        MIKEY!!!
