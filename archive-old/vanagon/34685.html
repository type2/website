Subject: RE: 74 camper, Gas Heaters

Hi Daniel,
I just installed an Eberspaecher BN2 underneath my '76 Camper. I also 
have the installation instructions, owners manual and trouble shooting guide.
If anybody wants a copy of those, please let me know.......
I'm still in the process evaluating it's performance and adjusting all 
the different safety devices built into it. Before the installation I 
had it completely apart and hot wired it outside the car. Up to now it works 
great and cranks out quite some heat.
If you want to get more details on how I installed everything, let me know.
BTW I purchased it without fuel pump, thermostat and regulator for about
$100.00 at a junkyard in germany last Xmas. I got the impression that used
ones don't have much value there. It wasn't hard to find one. The missing 
parts I bought new at some Bosch dealership over there for another $100.00.
At a VW dealership I saw a brand new later model gas heater for about 
$1200.00. Of course much more sophisticated than the older models.
If anybody out there has installed a BN2 before, please contact me, since I
still have some open questions about them.
