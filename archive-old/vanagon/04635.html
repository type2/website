&gt; &gt;Anyone know of a source for Solex parts other than what's contained in the
&gt; &gt;rebuild kits?  I recently rebuilt one and it was missing a spring when I took
&gt; &gt;it apart.  No one (including dealer) has the spring or even says they can
&gt; &gt;order it.  Although, I wonder what the dealer would do if they were repairing
&gt; &gt;the vehicle and needed the spring or other part of the carb.  Recommend a new
&gt; &gt;carb?  Maybe...
&gt; &gt;Doesn't make sense that you can't get individual parts for these carbs -- or
&gt; &gt;can you?  You tell me...
&gt; 
&gt; there ARE people out there, but you have to find them. most of them are in
&gt; southern california, so you'll have to find out where they advertise. if you
&gt; have a large library nearby (especially a college library), go to the
&gt; reference room and look through the telephone book yellow pages for cities
&gt; like los angeles, san francisco, etc.

I'm in Southern Calif, and I have been getting so many requests for parts
that I'm thinking about opening up a used parts shop.  :)   I have four
extra solex carbs in the garage that I scavenge parts off of, so if you
tell me *exactly* what spring you need, I can probably get you one.  As
is my policy, it will cost you lunch... I eat cheap though.  :)
Joel, sorry for replying to you and not the original poster &lt;WiebeK_at_aol_dot_com&gt;.
