Hopefully you can adjust it, its pretty straight forward.

(Provided your mirror is the same as my '83.5) remove the two phillips 
head screws at the base.  If the base seems stuck to the metal (theres a 
rubber washer between it and the sheetmetal) take care not to remove 
paint when pulling it off.

Inside the base you will see (probably covered with corrosion) a nut 
(10mm?) over a spring/washer assembly.  By tightening this nut (hold 
mirrow securely and use a socket) you can reduce the play.  Its really a 
kind of ball and socket mechanism.  You may be surprised by how much you 
need to tighten it, but be careful, because too much might split the 
socket housing.  Unfortunatly, the only way to tell if you adjusted it 
right is to reinstall it on the van (difficult to judge by hand).  It 
should be tight enough that you can move it without damaging its mounting 
point, but no less (to hold-up to freeway speed winds).  

While it is first apart, this is a good chance to clean it up (mine was 
pretty badly rusted inside).  A wire brush was useful for this followed  
by some WD-40.

Good luck,

Charles
'83.5 GL Westy

&gt; Hi Volks,
&gt; 
&gt; We have an 85 Westy and in very strong winds the drivers' side 
&gt; mirrror slowly moves into the side of the van, making it very 
&gt; interesting during lane changes.  Is there any way to tighten it up 
&gt; or do we have to buy a new mirror?
&gt; thanks,
