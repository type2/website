Subject: Re: Delta Six/Camper Parts

You all know Delta Six is the supplier to VW of most of the campmobile parts
&gt;for our vans.                                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

this may sound stupid, but how far back do his campmobile parts stock go?
does he have anything for bay windows (hoping?) or splits (really hoping)?

basically i am trying to ascertain when he started supplying parts for
westy's.  a phone number or mailing address for him might be useful too.
