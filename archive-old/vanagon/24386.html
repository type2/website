&gt;&gt; Stump the Professor!
&gt;
&gt;Ok, I will. :-P  With seat mounts gone from my MicroBus (due to rust it
&gt;would seem), how do I determine which seats were originaly in the back
&gt;and was it an 8 or 9 seater?


Count the seat belt anchors and divide by two?

If they're not also gone from rust or whatever, that is. How does one
lose seat mounts due to rust??? Aren't they INSIDE the bus? That
must be one rusty vee-hick-yool. Is this the one that's getting its
cargo floor sections replaced?

My '71 is one of the only non-walk-thru full vans (not single or double
cab) in captivity with the one-piece windshield. There's one seat belt
(two anchor points) for the driver, and one very long belt for two
extremely friendly passengers in the front. Then three belts (six anchor
points) for the full-width rearmost bench seat, and two belts (four
anchors) for the shortie middle seat. So I can't even use my own clever
count-and-divide scheme! But the rest of you can... How the mighty are
fallen &lt;sigh&gt;...
