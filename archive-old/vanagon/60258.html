Did someone need one MXL for there syncro?

I've got one new MXL that I will work out a trade for a new MXT.  The MXL
is on my spare and has never been used.

&gt; &gt;Clearly this technique isn't going to work once she's more mobile - I
don't
&gt; &gt;want to find her sleeping in the foot well by the sliding door! Has
anyone
&gt; &gt;come up with any interesting tricks to keep a sleeping infant confined
&gt; &gt;safely?
&gt; 
&gt; We decided to sleep in the upper bed. So the lower one was free for use
as
&gt; a children's room. We set the rear seats to the upright position and
&gt; separated the room above the engine compartment with some removable
plywood
&gt; and blankets. Of cause, we left some open space to get in and out, good
&gt; enough for the child.
&gt; 
&gt; We all were happy: The child with an own separate room with TWO windows,
&gt; and the adults having late dinner without disturbing the kid.
