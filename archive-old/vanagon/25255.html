&gt;Lee.

&gt;ps, yes I'm at the stage where I take the smallest
&gt;insignificant parts apart, clean them and put them back -
&gt;sad really :)

The description Christian gives of where the flat spot
should go is correct.  The screw just holds the flat spot
against the flap.  I have trouble understanding why Lee has
loose screws and Cristian wants to replace them allen heads.
There should be a set screw with a slot for tightening *and*
a lock nut on the set screw.  Tighten the set screw, tighten
the lock nut, it stays.

And no, there is nothing sad about cleaning all those little
parts before you put them back.  You feel good because you
know it has been done right.  We feel good because another
bus avoided a butcher!  Therapy, I call it therapy.  Now,
feel better?  That will be $90, please.
