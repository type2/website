&gt;I have a deep cycle RV battery that I store in a plastic case under the rear
&gt;seat of my 87 Westy to power a portable 9&quot; tv/vcr combo.  I just connect the
&gt;+ and  - poles to a BASIC DESIGNS12-volt cord (alligator clips and cigarette
&gt;type lighter adapter) and then plug in the tv 12-volt cord.  Well I just
&gt;tried this with the BASIC DESIGNS power shower and fried the cord!  Nearly
&gt;started a fire!  Was this just because the BASIC DESIGNS alligator clips
&gt;which connect to the battery are so &quot;wimpy&quot; or is this inherently dangerous?
&gt; I don't want to fry my tv.  Worse I don't want a fire.  Any suggestions? I
&gt;try to avoid using the dashboard lighter plug for obvious reasons
&gt;
&gt;

I'd get rid of those aligator clips and attach some real battery clamps,
heavy gage wire, a heavy duty cigarette lighter socket and most importantly a
FUSE.  Having a correctly sized fuse can usually prevent the type of trouble
you have had.
