My apologies agin to Gerry for the topic but I wanted to reply to the poster
who just said that many sites may not carry a newsgroup and that they were in
some way unreliable.

This is not a problem. With a rec group, ALL sites carry it. It is outside the
usenet proper, in for example...the alt groups, that there is some question
about what may be carried. As far as reliability, how much do you use it? I've
never had a problem in the usenet as far as msgs getting through.

One more thing to not: in a newsgroup, I've NEVER seen 40 msgs from someones
account being full and bouncing msgs, or those bounced from an abandoned
account, etc. Many usenet groups have close community feel. Many don't. It
usually seems to be how the particpants act that sets the tone.

There are newsgroups that make the traffic here look puny. Since usenet is
easier to manipulate, traffic isn't usually a problem until the groups become
HUGE.

Again, I am suggesting this as a way to keep us together. To me, it is
preferable to splitting the camps. In a split, we lose the ability to hit a
larger pool of knowledge, don't have as much impact on suppliers, and really
take away somewhat from why we're here.

The option is there. It will be a large change either way.

My hat tipped to Gerry once again. I couldn't have done it.
