Subject: question on J.C. Whitney Heater Box bypass

I am making a list of parts to buy from J.C. Whitney for my 77'.  Among them
are body panels and exhaust parts.  I am wondering if there is any real
disadvantage of getting the heater box bypass pipes for 10 bucks(as apposed
to 400 for heater boxes) and looking into alternative heat down the line?  I
know that I will enevitably have some kind of jury rig defrost because of
this action....If anyone could give me some insight or possibly tell me if I
am making a wrong decision, I would greatly appreciate it..

Thank You 

Toby
