Subject: Re: engine sub/heat/towing

Regarding towing:

I have a trailer hitch attached to the two towing hooks and bolted to the
bumper in the middle.  I pull a Coleman tent trailer - probalby approx
1000 lbs loaded and have had no problems.

The hitch came from a local trailer shop for approx $100 1986 dollars.
