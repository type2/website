Subject: Re: CA, land of busses galore

I don't exactly get a stiffy whenever I see an early bus (I do on crew 
cabs). I live on then Peninsula and see at least one or two a week. I 
have a '61, a guy who lives down the street from me has a '67, a guy who 
lives next door to my surfing buddy has a '65 (although, he always seems 
to be working on his), and so on. They're around, although dwindling. I'm 
just pleased that owners are leaving them stock or close to it; it's 
really sad to see a vintage bus or crew slammed, stuffed full of stereo 
equip and painted neon. But, that's just my preference.

BTW, I'm beginning to think I need a name for my ride... any suggestions 
for a '61 walk thru, with safaris and water color curtains fore and aft 
with matching bean bags in the back?

PS- still looking for an ignition switch (one that works, please).

&gt; &gt; Here in upstate NY if you see an owl-face you honk and jump up and down
&gt; &gt; in surprise .....
&gt; 
&gt; They're not THAT common here! I jump up and down and honk if I see one. 
&gt; Yesterday at lunchtime, I was driving through the parking lot near Una
&gt; Mas! in Otto ('59 Single) and what do I see across the lot but a dark blue
&gt; or primer big-tailight split crewcab. I followed her all the way through
&gt; the lot and honked, but she didn't see me. I have the same question: 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; wasnt anyone on the list was it ????? ;)
