Subject: Re: 71 bus turn signals

&gt; &gt; Hello listmembers,
&gt; &gt;    Taking my son to school this a.m. Noticed when I changed lane car behind
&gt; &gt;me blew horn. My signal was on but clicked fast. Got home and  checked rear
&gt; &gt;bulb was out.
&gt; &gt;Replaced bulb and signal worked fine. Was wondering if signal supposed to
&gt; &gt;give you this  racing click when bulb is out or do I have some kind of
&gt; &gt;electrical problem. 
&gt; 
&gt; The rapid clicking also could mean the contacts that the bulb push against
&gt; are dirty/corroded.  Replacing the bulb in this case might only solve the
&gt; problem temporarily since removing and inserting the bulb may have caused
&gt; you to make a good contact.  Make sure the old bulb is truly bad--if not,
&gt; then clean those contacts!

I believe the faster rate is a by product of a lesser load on the RC 
circuit.  It is useful for telling you a light bulb is burned out but 
accidentally (well maybe partially on purpose it was left in).  Probably 
nothing else to be concerned with.

If the bulb is out of the circuit for another reason though it would 
cause the same problem.  If a new bulb fixes it you're done (enough) if 
not look for bad contacts.
