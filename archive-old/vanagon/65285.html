Subject:        30 fan fuse or circuit breaker

Recently, when my '86 Westy was in the body shop getting the front end
repaired, the body shop &quot;technician&quot; air chiseled through the wiring
harness.  Would have liked to see the look on his face when that 30 amp fuse
blew.  Anyway, after I re-connect the harness I was wondering if I should
just replace the fuse or upgrade to a circuit breaker?  I have seen two
types, one with a manual reset button, and the other resets automatically.
The manual one cost $3.99 and the auto costs $2.99.  Sure I can buy a whole
box of fuses for under two bucks, but I was just wondering if getting away
from them is a bad thing.  Just thinking out loud.  What do you all think?

Thanks,
Doug
'86 GL Westy/Maryland
