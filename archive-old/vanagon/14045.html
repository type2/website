Subject: Re: Buying a vanagon

&gt;&gt;Hey I am up here in Edmonton, Alberta. I am about to put my 1991 Vanagon GL 
&gt;on the market. It is a one of a kind van with dual sliding doors on both 
&gt;sides, electric door locks, 7 passenger bucket seats, dark red paint with 
&gt;Ming finish, ultra-tinted windows, VW mag wheels w\ mag spare, dual 
&gt;batteries, stainless steel exhaust system, deluxe stereo package (still 
&gt;sounds like crap), gas heater, VW floor mats throughout, VW sunroof(I picked 
&gt;up in Germany and installed professionally here), bra, and I had the molded 
&gt;bumpers and mirrors professionally painted to match the van's paint...so it 
&gt;is an ultra kewl Vanagon to say the least. It's water cooled and has the 
&gt;remander of the extended warranty to 100 000 km or 1997, having only 65 
&gt;000km on it right now...and I would like to get $16,000 obo Canadian for it.
&gt;
i really want to get away from a &quot;luxury&quot; car, i have a hand me down caddy 
right now, its crappy, power everything, and sometimes the windows wont go 
down or hte locks wont work, im trying to go for a simple van, also your 
price is WAY out of my range.  but thanks alot for your reply
