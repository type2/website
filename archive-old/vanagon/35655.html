Subject: Bosch Digijet Air Flow Meter (84 Vanagon)

Hi all!

A few days left and we are heading for Califoria. However, I have a 
Bosch Air Flow Meter in my 84 Vanagon that is probably not working 
right...

1. Have you ever tried to fix one of these things yourself?

2. My mechanic told me that a new one (part only) is $314 + taxes. Does 
this sound about right?

3. Any experience with factory rebuilt Bosch fuel injection parts?

4. Which import parts dealer(s) would you recommend? (Sorry, just 
joined the list a few weeks ago - this stuff comes probably up all the 
time).

Thanks for your help!
