Subject: Converting electric Dometic Fridge to propane

I have an 86 Vanagon Westy Weekender (&quot;Bus Plus&quot; according to local
dealer), that came equipped with a removable 12/110V Dometic refrigerator.
Recently, I saw a Dometic portable reefer with the same shape that also ran
on propane. It was supplied by Coleman with purchase of a tent camper
trailer. Anybody know if Dometic makes conversions, or does anybody have
one of the propane models for sale?

12V model only runs 8 hours on auxiliary battery, no good for us Baja beach
bums. I use it in the house fulltime: it makes a great beer/soda reefer.

Mark
