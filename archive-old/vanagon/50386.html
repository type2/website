Have seen several formerly diesel Vanagons that have been converted to us=
e
Golf/Jetta GTI/GLI gas engines.  Owners rave about improved driveability,=

power, gas mileage, etc.  I have an '85 gas Vanagon Westfalia that needs =
an
engine rebuild.  Would like to convert to Golf/Jetta power but need donor=

diesel Vanagon for needed parts.  Know of any derelict diesels that may b=
e
available cheap, and within a weekend's drive of Illinois?  Know anyone w=
ho
has done this conversion? =

=0D
 I have accumulated some info from diesel to gas owners that will help ge=
t me
started.  Will be happy to share if interested.  Can also give out the na=
me
of a shop in Ohio that has done several diesel to gas conversions.  A
satisfied customer drives his Vanagon to all the VW shows west of Mississ=
ippi
PULLING A TRAILER!  Last time I saw him he had 30K miles on his conversio=
n
and was very happy.  By the way, the conversion can be done on a diesel
Vanagon for considerably less than the cost of a waterboxer rebuild.  The=

cost of a gas Vanagon to Golf/Jetta will depend on what you have to pay f=
or
the diesel only parts.  =

=0D
I am attempting this conversion because of my faith in VW that they did n=
ot
do something unique to diesel Vanagons that couldn't be transferred to ga=
s
Vanagons.
=0D
They have never let me down yet!

Thanks in advance.
