Subject: Interesting roof alternatives for a GL

Hey guys,
	I was wondering if anyone out there has seen anything done with 
the roof of a Vanagon GL. Is it structurally possible to fit it with a 
westfalia pop-top or not? Would it be worth the time or money? Have you 
heard or seen anything else creative (sunroofs etc.) Just wondering and a 
little anxious to get creative with a new van. TIA.

                      ,                         Take it easy,
