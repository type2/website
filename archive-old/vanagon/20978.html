&gt;I'm new to this list and just bought an '81 Vanagon L, the fuel-injected

&gt;and 2) what can be done to keep 'em running cool?

        Under normal conditions, it shouldn't be a problem. It's only when
the cooling system is on the fritz that problems can arise. As for a
Vanagon, I have no clue, I'm still in the dark ages of the flat-four 1600.
For the old 1600's you can get aftermarket oil coolers, but they can be
unsightly-painful too, if you brush against them when you get home. I guess
for folks in Death Valley it might not be a bad idea. Find out what VW
recommnds for your conditions-i.e. local weather, make/model, usage, etc.
My Bentley only covers to '79.
