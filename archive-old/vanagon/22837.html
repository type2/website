Subject: '67 Westy Parts Bus

O.K., who was I &quot;talking&quot; to a few weeks back about the '67 Camper that I 
know of around here (Springfield, MO).  I'd said that I would try to find 
out more about it (I had looked at it a year ago, $300, screwy title) 
when I had a chance.  The chance came a couple of weeks ago and, as I 
headed over there I passed the FLAPS that handles most of the VW parts 
business and it was sitting in their parking lot!  Seems that the store 
owner bought it and he is willing to sell it for around $500.  It is 
probably not worth restoring (rust, hit in front/back), but the interior 
is in suprisingly good shape.  Anyone need a parts Bus?  It is missing 
the gas heater ,as I traded the rear hatch off of my '67 Free Bus for it ... 
hee, hee ;-)  Sorry I didn't post earlier, but I've been on vacation.
