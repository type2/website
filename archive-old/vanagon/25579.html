&gt;Hi VW Fans: 
&gt;
&gt;We have the perfect place for your last campout of the summer. The 2nd
&gt;Annual VW Fest at Lazy Day campground in Mineola, MO - Oct. 20, 21, &amp; 22nd
&gt;(3rd weekend). A real nice campground with heated restrooms, fishing and
&gt;all sites have electric and water. 
&gt;
&gt;Octoberfest in Hermann, MO. On Saturday and / or Sunday we'll take a 17
&gt;mile scenic caravan to the Historic German Town of Hermann, MO where we
&gt;will partake in their world famous annual German festival, &quot;Octoberfest&quot;,
&gt;so pack your sleeping bag, don on your lederhosen and hop in your VW for
&gt;an unforgettable time.
&gt;
&gt;Directions. Mineola is between St.Louis and Columbia, MO on Hwy 70. Get
&gt;off at the Danville / Mineola exit at the mile marker 170. Go South on Hwy
&gt;J approximately 2 miles. It's on the Left side. You can't miss it! See ya
&gt;there!
&gt;
&gt;For more information on the campout, you can call me at 314-623-7124.
Just my two cents.

On I 70 betwixt Columbia and St. Louis, the Mineola Hill is the steepest
grade.  Older buses should allow extra time if we get a *real* early snow.
&lt;grin&gt;

BTW, Hermann is a very old German town on the Missouri river and has been
making wine for a long time.  Pretty good.

Check it out.
