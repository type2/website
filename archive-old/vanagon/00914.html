At camping stores you can buy &quot;solar showers&quot;. This is essentially a five 
gallon bag designed to absorb sunlight and retain the heaat for awhile. 
They have a think to hang them from branches, etc., and a regular little 
shower spigot on them. You can let them sit on top of the Westy and 
gather sun rays. By mid morning or so they'll be warm...sometimes hot.

Carry two and get more time in the water......they're cheap.
