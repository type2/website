Subject: Early Bus Engine Lid Idea

From: &quot;Thom Fitzpatrick&quot; &lt;thom_at_tim_dot_com&gt;

A while back I had an idea for using a locking T handle so's you
could lock the engine lid on an early bus ('pre -64 +/-)  The
idea was to use the T handle from a rear hatch, which has a lock in
it.

I dug up a T handle in my parts box, and did a test pit.  Almost
a perfect fit.  The only thnk that isn't kosher is the engine lid has
a small recess where the fancy chrome trim doo-dad goes around the
base of the handle.  The threaded portion comes out exactly the right
length on the other end!  All I need is a washer and a nut, ohh, and
a key, and I'm in business!

I'm thinking of engineering a trim piece by taking a crome O piece
and machining (filing) one side flat, and then finding some sort
of rubber piece to act as a seal, and it would prolly look 
pretty close to stock.  I certainly don't have to monkey with my
priceless center brakelight engine lid!

Anyone ever had a key made for one of these handles?
