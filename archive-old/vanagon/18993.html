Subject: RE: wide tires on 71 bus


_______________________________________________________________________________
I'm getting my 71 bus ready for exile to Dog Island, FL, and want to put 
the very widest possible tires on her to cope with the deep sand.  While 
I can rebuild an engine, I'm totally ignorant about tires.  I know that 
they are 14 inch rims (where's this measured, BTW?).  Should I get wider 
rims for wider tires, or do wider tires fit on stock rims? 

'71 bus, '79 911SC Targa
*********************************************************

  If I were you, I'd garage the bus and use the Targa until it
  turned into rust/dust...
