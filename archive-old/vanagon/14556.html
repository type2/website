So Ric trained-in-lawyer-speak says:
&gt; 
&gt; Martha quizzically querries:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Jeeze, Ric - whadya do to that poor guy?  :)
&gt; 
&gt; I'm sorry....all that EuroVan trash talk bought back the trauma of
&gt; having to train Steve Johnson in the ways of the EuroVan...
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Obviously, Ric, has some kind of distorted view of the past and
a simple check of the archives will easily clarify that I, Joel and
Ric had a &quot;discussion&quot; about the virtues (or lack there of) about EV's
Ric seems to think he's somehow &quot;trained me in the ways&quot; of the EV.  
Hah!  Although Ric has quite a historic VW knowledge base, I'll never 
understand his affection for the EV.  If you want to read my views of 
the EV, again, please check out the archives in the search mode and 
type in the key word &quot;saga&quot; and I think you'll find plenty of fun reading 
there.

No apologies needed, thank you.  :)
