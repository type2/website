&gt; 
&gt; I'm looking for a new engine for my '71 transporter, or optionally an
&gt; entire new vehicle.  My current engine has been diagnosed as having a
&gt; couple months left (something about the crankshaft moving back and forth
&gt; the way it shouldn't).  Please mail me if you can recommend a good
&gt; replacement...
&gt; 
&gt; If anyone knows of a good mechanic in the central Tennessee area, please
&gt; mail me, also.
&gt;

Hey, do I have a deal for you.  In Huntsville, AL, I have a 1979 
Transporter for sale.  

Newly rebuilt engine (less than 1000 miles on it (heads, pistons, cylinders)).
Gas heater.
Air conditioner.
New clutch/pressure plate (same time as engine)
New muffler
2 bbl Weber carb.

Let me know if you're interested.  I'm willing to deal!
