Subject: Yet another great find!!!!

Well, I really have no place to store it, but I'm going to be picking
up next week sometime, a  No motor, little rust, no sink/
icebox, poor interior, poor exterior, no canvas (what's there is rotted
away), straight (this is good, at least!), no lenses (I have some),
sitting-in-someone's-backyard-since-1990, 1971 Westfalia. For 50.00.
(And the VIN's even match each other, and the title!) I just hope
my wife doesn't find out about it.
