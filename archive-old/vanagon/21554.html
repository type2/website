Kevorkian sues for deathmobile's return

Jack Kevorkian has sued the Oakland County Sheriff's Department to get his
deathmobile back. The ragged, rusted, 1968
Volkswagen bus, in which two of the retired pathologist's assisted suicides
occurred, was seized May 12 after Kevorkian
used it to move a patient's body.

&quot;This is just pure harassment, said Kevorkian attorney Michael Odette. He
said the van has been fingerprinted and
photographed already. Sheriff John Nichols would not comment. A court
hearing is set Aug. 16. 

The lawsuit could cost more than the van is worth. &quot;My guess is that it's
worth maybe $100, said Chuck Wood at Wood
Motors in Detroit. &quot;Then again, you might have to pay someone to take it off
your hands.

My comment:
You meet the nicest people in VW Buses.&lt;G&gt;
