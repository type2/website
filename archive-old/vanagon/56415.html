Subject:  Aux. Gas Heater -Eber...




Greetings.

While playing in my new-to-me 89 Westy, I discovered that I have a
(Ebersach (sp?) gas heater, with a control panel mounted on the wall behind
sliding door to the left of the rear ashtay.

There are two flashing lights, one green, and obviously meaning all systems
go, but when the  dial is on 1 (dial is 1 to 7), the red light blips.

How long should I keep this running when the engine is off?

Any advice?


Thaks.
