Subject: RE: /f Road hazards (fork lifts!)


&gt;All the recent threads re: flammable substances, exploding batteries and 
&gt;other general stupidity made me think that others on the list have 
&gt;encountered other interesting road hazards. Anyone care to share?

&gt;A lady that I work with and I were discussing why I don't park the Vanagon
Westy in the parking garage with the seven foot clearence and the uneven
concrete with the hanging water pipes etc. Her story was that her son has
been a truck driver for years. She told of a time that he used a concrete
over pass to peel a load of new fork lifts off the back of his flat bed 18
wheeler at 65mph+. Jeesh!, If I were the traffic behind him at that point
I'd wish that a deer had jumped out in front of me instead! I've been the
deer route and can't imagine the scene. BTW: no injuries, just DOT driving
school for the trucker.
