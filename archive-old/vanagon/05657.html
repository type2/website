I agree.  Every KOA I have ever seen is a small, fenced lot with paved
sites sandwiched within feet of each other.  Okay for those who have 40 foot
pusher motorhomes with popout living rooms, maybe.  The only reason I would
stay at one of those is for the pool/showers that most have and perhaps to
charge up the fridge batteries.
