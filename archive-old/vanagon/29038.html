Subject: external oil filter/cooler connections HELP!!!!

On my 1600 bus engine is an external cooler and filter.  I removed the
engine for rebuild and in my wisdom failed to note exact connections
for the adapter on the engine.  I need to know which of the two
connections on the adapter is the outlet so that I can connect the oil
filter appropriately.  I am going to just bypass the filter if can't
determine at this stage, but since I need to put the old bus on the
road I would rather go ahead and connect it properly.  Any clues would
be helpful. Thanks to all
