Subject: Re: Porsche 6 in late bus

D P Karpowicz asked about a throttle sensor on Porsche 911 CIS.  Not sure I
know what you mean, but: 78 and later CIS has a switch that opens when the
engine draws vacuum.  They use it with a relay that turns off the fuel pump
if the engine stalls.  77 and earlier do not have the switch.  Unlike the
Vanagon and other EFI, I can bench test the Porsche FI with power for the
fuel pump and no other electricity.

DPK: email me direct at kennedy_at_admin.njit_dot_edu if I'm not understanding your
question.
