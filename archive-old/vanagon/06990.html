Subject: Re: stove=heater=safe? + update

&gt; It seems that the fan from kmart runs a bit fast and takes all the heat
&gt; away from the exhaust vent in about 15 sec...

The problem is that you're never going to get more heat than the 1000 btu 
burner input, probably a lot less. That's not enough for much comfort.
