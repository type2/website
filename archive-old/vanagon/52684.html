&gt; In response to misc. Turbo diesel questions 
&gt; 
&gt;  How are you measuring 
&gt; boost -  a vacuum line runs fr boost sense port on intake manifold (normally
&gt; runs to
&gt; inj pump enrich. ) and connects to gauge on dash. 
Ok, so you're not using a turbo inj. pump. How does the power compare 
with the old engine after adding just the turbo? Just curious, since 
my TD is really weak if the enrichment hose is left off (as some 
VW &quot;specialist&quot; did after servicing my car :(. I also noticed 
however, that the engine runs *much* cooler when enrichment is not 
happening, which makes sense - less fuel=less heat.

&gt; EGT?   - I had to order a vdo EGT gauge and an extra long wire extention to
&gt; get
Do you have a source for these, and how much? What's the correct temp 
ranges for this engine?
