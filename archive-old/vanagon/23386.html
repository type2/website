First Bob lectures:

&gt;&gt;But the problem with using a winch often involves where to attach the cable
&gt;&gt;rather than the winch.  Since the only real tree in Baja is busy shading the
&gt;&gt;plaza at San Ignacio, finding someplace to fasten the cable can stretch your
&gt;&gt;ingenuity to the snapping point.

Then Tim chimes in:

&gt;The high lift jack is cheap and reliable and doesn't require 80-200 amps to 
&gt;work. Winch electrical hookup was enough to put me off the idea. 2nd 
&gt;battery, heavy wire everywhere, maybe a heavier alternator... Winching 
&gt;yourself out will drain a battery in short order. No fun if you can't start 
&gt;your van once you get back on solid ground. If you just want to get off 
&gt;slippery surfaces then a cheap block and tackle set, 1000lbs, 6 foot pull 
&gt;may suit. Packs away tightly also.

You guys are NO fun!! Don't you realize that a winch will only look macho
as long as everyone *believes* it's useful! 

Now I don't want no winch anymore... &lt;pout&gt;
