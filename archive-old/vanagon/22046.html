hello all,
	yet another question from this non-mechanical newbie :)


so today on my lunch break i went out and tried to figure a few things
out about my '73 bus.  earlier i had posted that the clicking noise
you hear when you turn the ignition key to the first notch (this is
caused by the solenoid pushing the starter/pinion gear into the
flywheel, right?????  if not what is it?) does not go away after you
start the motor.  a nice fellow named marty (thank you marty) said it
could be that the spring isn't pulling the gear back.  well, where is
this spring?  i looked for it, as well as a few other things but with
no success.  anychance someone out there could give me another clue or
two to help me on my way?   thanks!!!
