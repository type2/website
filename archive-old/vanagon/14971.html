&gt;Great guide, Joel, but you wouldn't be 2-timing us,
&gt;would you (Honda...phhft :-p) ?

actually, 3-timing. :) my nephew and one fellow at a FLAPS have hondas,
and another fellow at the same FLAPS has a Triumph Spitfire (you want to
talk about Masochism with Machines??? wow!!) ... so i subscribe to the
honda list AND the brit car list for them.

phhft to ewe-2. :)
