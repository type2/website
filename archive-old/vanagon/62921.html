Subject: BIG Propane Tank Update

OK first off, hope that everyone who has emailed me privately gets a 
seperate message from &quot;propane list&quot; from me on this, first time I've 
messed with a list on Pegasus, if you don't email me and bitch.

Now the news, NOONE HAD MEASURED A LATE TANK FOR ME,
come on people I do not have one at my disposal, I'm talking about 5 
minutes work with a seamstress style tape measure, get circumference 
and location of output flanges.  The 6 X 30 on mine has obviously 
about a 19&quot; circumference is this is the case on a late tank LET ME 
KNOW.

OK Manchester Tank is really looking to be a good source, we can buy 
direct with over 15 orders, the 8 X 30 tank they sell is a 
&quot;universal&quot; ASME, DOT, NFPA, certified under the vehicle tank, now if 
indeed the 6 X 30 on my '81 is the same size as all van tanks this 
gains us quite a bit of propane.  I calculate the OEM to hold 2.97 
gallons water at 80%, this one will hold 5.22, a nice little bonus I think 
we will all agree.  Pricing is $158, plus shipping, plus $20 for the 
gage, these are neat if you have not seen one, little mechanical 
float attached to a indicator dial screwed in the side, reads 20-80% 
full.  Now the tank has universal mounting brackets as well so I've 
asked about Vanagon style bracketing instead (as they are building 
them all new anyway) or we will probably have to have brackets made, 
which I would have done by a local sheet metal shop, and I'd epoxy 
prime them for us, I figure another $20 for brackets.  So let's say 
that to your door price with gage and brackets is looking to be $200 
plus shipping which will run $20-$50 most places I'd imagine, tank 
weighs 37 pounds.  Compared to $636 for the smaller origional worth 
it I think but I need some feedback on ground clearance issues.

The other alternative is the other supllier, I just finally finished 
the prints on my &quot;wish list&quot; 7 X 36 tank which is I think a better 
size compromise.  4.8 gallons at 80%, over 150% origional capacity 
and less ground clearance loss.

Well just wanted to give an update seek opinions and try to get 
someone to measure a tank off a late say post '88 van for me, Ron? 
Tom?
