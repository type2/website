We have a Wolfsburg and it is very convenient to have table, rear-facing
seats (and they come out in literally 30 seconds!) and convertable bed.
The only thing better is a Westfalia (and we now have one finally).   You
should be aware ,however,that some people get carsick  facing backwards,
expecially on curvy roads (our kids took to calling them the throwup
seats...).

&gt;You can expand the limits of your search just a bit.  This configuration was
&gt;available in 1987 - 1989 as the &quot;Wolfsburg Limited Edition&quot; (WLE), and also
&gt;1989-1991 as the Carat.  Also in 1990 as a Carat WLE.  There were no 1988
&gt;Carats in the USA.
