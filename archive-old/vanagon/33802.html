&gt;&gt;My van  intermitantly sends oil warnings (ie. warning light and nasty
&gt;&gt;buzzer at 2000+ RPM).
&gt;
&gt;Not really enough info to make an accurate diagnosis.  First, I would
&gt;recommend installing an analog oil pressure guage.  Electric are OK but I
&gt;would prefer a tube type that will read the actual pressure.  (Less chance
of
&gt;guage failure).
&gt;
&gt;Possibilities are:
&gt;
&gt;-Too much oil pressure.  Could be caused by clogged oil passages in the
&gt;engine case and/or crank and cam shafts.  Also, you could be getting
pressure
&gt;from a leaking combustion chamber into the lower end of your engine.
&gt;
I don't believe so.  The 86-91 Vanagon does not have an oil pressure switch
that will indicate too high an oil pressure.  It does have two oil pressure
switches that indicate too low a pressure, one at 0.3bar (when RPM &lt;2000) and
one at 0.9bar (when RMP&gt;2000).

&gt;-Too little oil pressure.  Worn crank bearings, cam bearings, or oil pump
&gt;face plate.  Oil level low, broken down oil, etc...
&gt;
&gt;-Faulty guage.

Could be a faulty oil pressure monitoring system.  I had a problem with mine
that went away by itself.  To test whether it's the monitoring system or
actual low oil pressure attach a pair of small lights directly to the
switches.  The switch wires are a pair of brown wires that attach to a white
connector above the left head.  Splice into each of these wires and tie them
to one side of each light.  Connect the other side of each light to +12VDC
power.  In a properly operating system one light will be on when the engine
is off and then go off when you start the engine and pressure rises above
0.3bar.  The other light will be off when the engine is off and anytime the
oil pressure is below 0.9bar.  When the pressure rises above 0.9 bar this
light will come on, indicating a high enough oil pressure.
This test will allow you to see exactly what the oil pressure switches are
doing, bypassing the rest of the monitoring system.  If the light don't
operate as I've described, then you either have a defective oil pressure
switch (or 2) or actual low oil pressure.
&gt;
&gt;You really need to know exactly what the oil pressure is doing.  Many of the
&gt;items I mention above are very serious.  Pressure problems can often be a
&gt;sign of a near future engine rebuild or replacement.  

My guess is that unfortunately you are likely to have actual low oil pressure
&amp; engine rebulbuild time.

Here's more on the oil pressure monitoring system:

The operation of the Dynamic Oil Pressure System is described in Bentley
section 90.
The operation of the oil pressure switches is described in Bentley section
17.
I use the term &quot;described&quot; here pretty loosely here, because they do a very
poor job.

The dynamic oil pressure monitoring system gets inputs from two pressure
switches.  One switch is closed with no oil pressure and opens when oil
pressure rises to about 0.3 bar, called the .3 bar switch.  The .3 bar switch
is located between the left (driver's side) two cylinders.
The other switch is open with no oil pressure and closes when oil pressure
rises to about 0.9 bar, thus called the .9 bar switch.  The .9 bar switch is
located below the water pump &amp; crank pulley, near the oil pump.

The monitoring system seems to only &quot;look at&quot; the .3 bar switch below 2000
RPM and ignore the .9 bar switch.  Above 2000 RPM the active switch is the .9
bar switch while the .3 bar switch is ignored.  Below I've described a
properly operating monitoring system.  Note that I say &quot;monitoring system&quot;
because some of the conditions describe an abnormally low oil pressure
condition.

A. Ignition ON, engine NOT running -- or -- engine running at LESS than
2000RPM
    .9 bar switch is ignored
    
    1. Low oil pressure exists (below .3 bar), keeping .3 bar switch closed
    Oil light: Flashes
    Buzzer: Silent

    2. Normal oil pressure exists (above .3 bar), opening .3 bar switch
    Oil light: Off
    Buzzer: Silent


B. Engine running at MORE than 2000RPM
    .3 bar switch is ignored
    
    1. Low oil pressure exists (below .9 bar), keeping .9 bar switch open
    Oil light: Flashes
    Buzzer: Sounds

    2. Normal oil pressure exists (above .9 bar), closing .9 bar switch
    Oil light: Off
    Buzzer: Silent


There does not appear to be a condition in a normally operating monitoring
system when the light should be on steady.

I hope this helps.
