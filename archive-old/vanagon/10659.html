Subject:      Re: I'm confused about '79s

Andy said:
&gt; Several people have also recently mentioned that the 79 bus had a slightly
&gt; wider body. Were these changes made on North American models only? I have
&gt; never seen a bay window bus that didn't have any of those panels behind the
&gt; front seats (except when they had been chopped out by the owner) and when I
&gt; see body panels in parts catalogues they are listed as suitable for 73 to 79
&gt; models. This even includes the front panel, so where did the extra inches go?

And Dave said:
&gt;  The panels behind the front seats were certainly gone , at least in the
&gt;  Westfalia conversion, by the late '70's. I suspect it was in '76, when the
&gt;  camper layout changed. Swivelling front seats and the little front table
&gt;  were part of the dining set-up . I'll take a peek at a late 70's passenger
&gt;  bus next time I see one and look for the panels  if no-one on the list
&gt;  clears this up in the meantime.

this is what i had found from looking in several sources:

1977   Chassis Number 217-2000-001  -    217-2300-000
       Engine Number  GD-0-040-000  -
                      GE-0-000-001  -
                      1970 cc, 67 HP _at_ 4200 rpm
       Transmission:  4-speed manual,    091 CP
                      3-speed automatic, 010 NF
       Fuel System:   Bosch L-Jetronic AFC Electronic Fuel Injection
       Imported to U.S.      26,209
       Total Produced:

1)  Front seats have head rests, are more comfortable, and recline
    (metal wall behind front seats removed)

1979   Chassis Number 219-2000-001  -    219-2300-000
       Engine Number  GD-0-040-001  -
                      GE-0-000-000 (California models)
                      1970 cc, 67 HP _at_ 4200 rpm
       Transmission:  4-speed manual,    091 CP
                      3-speed automatic, 010 NF
       Fuel System:   Bosch L-Jetronic AFC Electronic Fuel Injection
       Imported to U.S.      11,762
       Total Produced:

1)  Body made slightly wider (1.6 inches extra)
2)  Catalytic converter introduced into exhaust system

so it looks like only the 79 was the wider one ... and if so it might have
been just the bumpers, not the body (as i had thought before). anybody know
for sure?

&gt;  I think the wider bus that Sami was referring to is the Vanagon / Brick
&gt;  which was introduced in 1979 &lt;at least in the U.S.&gt; as a 1980 model. I
&gt;  am also confused by year of production vs. model year. The

the euro introduction was always a year ahead of the u.s., i believe. even
the 1968 intro of the bread-loafs was as 1967 models in germany. i don't
know about in other countries, but i had heard that. it was certainly true
of the Vanagon/transporter in 1978 (for 1979 models) and of the eurovan in
1991 (as PJ can attest).

it sorta makes sense: vw would like to get it's parts system geared up and
switched over to the new models BEFORE trying to handle overseas shipments
... and a year of getting ready would also help work out any bugs in the
cars.
