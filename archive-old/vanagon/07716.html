Subject: Strange sounds from my engine


&gt;   Curious: does the sound peak at 58-60 and then decline above say 65 or get
&gt;   worse? If the former it could be some kind of &quot;sympathetic harmonic
&gt;   vibration&quot;. I have noticed this in my KG and Westy but it may occur in other
&gt;   engine types as well - DC


David, Stuart would have to find an 8-mile, 10% slope tp get his
diesel over 65 mph -- can you think of some other practical diagnostics? :-)
