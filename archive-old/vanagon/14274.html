(Martha replaced her broken window cranks...)

By coincidence, while I was doing some price checking on the vent flues I
asked the local VW dealer about window cranks. I also have two broken.
Replacement cost _at_ VWOA is $12.95 each and are special order. I think not.
I'll follow Marthas lead. Some how I can imagine why folks back in the 50s
and 60s etc. &quot;occasionally&quot; deviated from concourse/vintage stock.
