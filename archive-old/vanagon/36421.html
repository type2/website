On the matter of EV (Dis?)Satisfaction:
(to add to Ric's comments)

I have to add we have been very satisfied with ours.  at (almost)
39,000 miles, it has never left us stranded -- the engine was replaced
at 18,000 miles, but that was to fix a long-term problem, the piston
slap.  The vehicle has put up with four family members, one (BIG)
yellow Lab, and three PA winters.  It steers as tight as it did the
first day, and feels pretty much the same.


For those of you who have never driven an EV, and wondering what it
feels like, Matt Drahzal put it very well:

&quot;It's a VW bus that drives like a VW rabbit...&quot;
