Naw. Welcome to the club :-)


&gt;Last night I dreamed I was pursuing a '69 red van in MINT condition -- it 
&gt;kept slipping away down alleys, the wrong way, and I couldn't get near 
&gt;it.
&gt;
&gt;Then the owner painted the whole thing, windshield, windows and all, 
&gt;battleship grey to throw me off.


Obviously, not one of those so-real-you-swear-it-was-memorex dreams. If it
were, it'd have been _primer_ grey.


&gt;
&gt;I think I have bus lust.


That sure beats bus _rust_!


&gt;Is there something to do about it???

Repeat after me:

Buses have no heat. Buses aren't that neat.
Buses go real slow. They're cold in the snow.
Buses feed fixin'. uhhh.._dot_can't rhyme that one :-)

There. Feel better? Didn't think so. Why fight it? Just buy one and be done
with it. :-)
