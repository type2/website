Howdy!

	SO far I have 7 bites on the Sacramento trip.  Sounds like people
want it in late July at the earliest.

	Some people are also making noises like they wanna go bike riding,
which is great, but  and my so are currently bike-less due to an incident in 
January.  I think I can fix that by late July/Early August.

	There is also some interest in swinging by Fitzpatrick's Body and Paint
sometime during the day.

	I guess there are 2 ways to do this:

	1) Hit the bike trail in the morning/afternoon, and then head over
to Pescados for grub &amp; brews

	||

	2) Get lunch and then do the other stuff.

	If we had more early busses, I probably could convince Dean Anderson
to bring some SOTO guys by, but I don't think they'd get too jazzed up over
the bricks, no offense.  There are a _lot_ of nice early busses here in Sac.

Just ideas.
