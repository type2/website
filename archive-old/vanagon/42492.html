I had this problem and it drove me crazy trying to get at the clutch pedal 
mechanism to lubricate it. I ended up doing it by feel. I sort of memorized 
the locations of everything and put a glob of grease on my finger and 
reached up from the bottom and deposited the grease in the proper place. 
It's been quiet for 6 months now. I just hope I never have to change the 
clutch master cylinder.
