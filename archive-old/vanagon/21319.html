Subject: the &quot;ideal&quot; refrigerator


As usual, my mind's been wandering again - trying to fantasize the
perfect refrigerator.  Not that most VW campers would have enough
space for this, but see what you think.  (It could work in a house
too, of course).

Either West Marine or Camping World (and I'm sorry to say I can't
even remember if it's the store or the catalog) offer an ice-maker
only unit, which runs off of AC *OR* DC (maybe even propane, can't
remember).  My idea was to have this unit make ice cubes, which,
instead of sitting in their bin, would drop down by gravity and
surround an ice box.  I suppose this would be sort of like an ice
chest on propped up on it's smallest end, and within it, a smaller
rectangle, which would not be insulated.  The ice would &quot;drop&quot; 
into the airspace/cavity between the two rectangles, and be insulated
by the thickness/insulating qualities (which could probably be
beefed up) of the outer rectangle.  

My experience is that ice can last 3 days or more if WELL insulated,
and in this case, one could simply turn on the ice maker when
needed.  One of those fridgemate fans run on 2 D-cell batteries
ought to be sufficient to whirl the cold air around to create
relatively even temperatures inside the inner box.  

Further, perhaps the melted ice from the system could either be
recycled back into the water used in the ice maker, or even into
the regular water supply, for showers, etc.  

What do you think?  Is it viable?
