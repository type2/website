Subject: Re: SOTO/Classic (again)

Bob Hoover was asking a general &quot;Whatup&quot; regarding the SOTO/Classic Weekend. 

For once I'm not trying to be a smart aleck. 

Find a California map and do what it takes to get to the LA area.
** Friday afternoon 6/9,
 Berg puts on a road ralley. To me a road ralley in LA's Friday afternoon
rush hour sounds like kissing a chainsaw but the raffle and shop tour is
pretty cool. The ralley is supossed to be fun. 
**Saturday 6/10 AM-EARLY, 
Find your way to Garden Grove, CA VERY early on Saturday AM. That's the SOTO
meet. Honestly, last year, people started lining up at 4:30 AM and then
caught some sleep in line. Hardcore but your choice. 
**Saturday afternoon, At about 2-3 pm Wander over to Irvine, locate Irvine
Ctr. Drive just off of fwy55 and fwy405 near John Wayne Airport and look for
the Irvine Holiday Inn. Thats the Toy and Literature Show. Even if you don't
go inside to the show there will be tons of VWs in the parking lot.
**Sunday 6/11
BS with the folks at the other events for directions to Irvine Meadows,
which is a concert place. The VW Classic is held in the huge parking lot.
Look for exit (hwy?)133 off of the fwy405 on the SanDiego side of fwy55.

WHERE TO MEET?
The SOTO meet only let's '67 and earlier vehicles into the grassy area.
Vanagons and everything else must park on the blacktop. Look for people with
squinty eyes and carpal tunnel syndrom.
The VWClassic organizes the vehicles into categories. If you have a vanagon
then you'll be together. I would suggest parking on the &quot;Custom&quot; side if you
like fun. If you like perfect paint and quiche park on the Vintage side.

The point is to have fun!!! Last year we drove a very dreary singel cab
without hubcaps and ripped canvas. Your option is to stay in Hemet or Death
Valley and eat the wind while everyone else has fun. Plus this year it's
free unless you sell parts ($45 includes the space, one vehicle and two people).
&gt;

I'm Sorry but I'm not gonna do an ASCII of the LA fwy system but here's the
attempt at the SOTO directions
