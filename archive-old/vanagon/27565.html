Subject: REAL REVENGE

After being in China for just about the entire summer, I returned in mid August to 
discover the necessity of dealing with renewing all of the license and inspection permits 
on one of our two &quot;regular&quot; cars, a truck, and my '69 pop topper. Well, as you may have 
also experienced when confronted with the requirements of obtaining proper permits for 
those functions that should be rights, it took the better part of two days to deal with 
all of that franchised permit revenue generating crap.

So, after being put into a super good mood, all of which was generated by the standing in 
line after line for hours on end, I return to my happy home and proceed to stick all of my 
bright new labels on the various windshields, making sure that each label is positioned 
properly, and just as importantly, affixed to the proper automobile.
God forbid I should err.

Well, my wife's car seemed to revolt at the idea of having its old sticker(s) removed from 
the windshield so I was confronted with the necessity of having to go get a razor blade 
scraper so as to perform windshield label surgery, but alas and alack, I did not have the 
necessary tool in my readily available grasp. Not to worry, this will keep until tomorrow, 
thinks I.

The next evening my wife returns home from work with a ticket. You guessed it.........
Not having a current sticker on the windshield.

Yup, I am a happy camper. Back from the People's Republic and into the bowels of the 
sticker republic.

What the hey? I'm an adult. I'm grown up. I can handle adversity. I get over it all.

Two evenings later, I am on Interstate 10, headed for home about 11:00 at night. Whooosh! 
There goes a heifer cop past me doing about 75-80 mph. No lights. No siren. Just late for 
the latest batch of fresh donuts and free coffee at the fast stop market.

I wheel in behind the heifer cop, and proceed down I-10 at her same rate of speed, 
obviously not endangering anyone, otherwise &quot;we&quot; wouldn't be clipping along at that rate 
of speed. I stay several car lengths behind her.

She changes lanes. I change lanes.
This occurs several times. Each time, I stay several lengths behind her so as to not be 
following too close.

She exits off onto the main street that heads towards my house, and, of course I take the 
same exit. At the very last minute, at the stop light, she again changes lanes.
Ditto do I.

We are now proceeding down my home stretch street, and I give her a quick double click of 
the brights. She whips into a parking lot and does a slick 180 degree maneuver so as to 
face my entry into same. Obviously she is a trained precision acrobat driver.
Cool! I feel better.

Out of the car comes the heifer cop, with her trusty bull cop sidekick staying put in the 
car. I roll down my window with a cool touch of my power window button and am about to be 
of assistance to her, when she, using her officer's voice, asks &quot;Why are you following 
me?&quot;

I reply. &quot;Young lady. I wasn't following you. I was trying to get your attention. Are you 
aware of the fact that you have no license plate on the rear of your automobile? I am sure 
that you are aware of the fact that Texas state law requires that you have a license plate 
on the rear of any automobile that you might drive on public streets.&quot;

She replies. &quot;Let me see your license?&quot;

I reply. &quot;Surely. May I also see yours? Obviously I was trying to get your attention for a 
reason&quot;.

She does the old computer check on my license. 
I proceed to write down all of the information from hers.
After a while she returns to my car.
Again, with a cool touch of my power window button, I lower the glass so as to allow for 
more pleasantries and interesting civilian to officer chit chat.

She hands me my license.
I tell her that I will be done with hers in just a few more minutes, and for her to please 
be patient.

I hand her license back to her, and again tell her that she must try to obey the laws of 
the state of Texas when she drives upon our public streets. She replies with an excuse of 
the car having been just issued less than 20 days ago to the force.
I respond by refreshing her memory with the fact that under circumstances such as that, 
she must then have a 21 day temporary permit in her rear window.

I tell her that there is no need for further action on my part tonight. The rest of what 
needs to be done can be handled tomorrow.

She proceeds to leave.

As she hustles off in a huff. I give my parting words of wisdom.

&quot;By the way, young lady, I am not a trained observer, such as yourself, but, simply as a 
judgment call on my part, nothing more, I believe that you might very well have been 
driving at a bit too fast for traffic conditions. I hope that you will hold it down in the 
future.&quot;

She doesn't even thank me for my being so courteous.

I get even by thinking &quot;Bitch!&quot;

***************************
You would have thought she understood that what is good for the goose is good for the b 
gander, but I guess she still had those donuts on her mind.
