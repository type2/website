Subject: '83 AC questions

I finally got my AC working, well somewhat... Anyway, I've noticed that 
the engine runs pretty rough with the AC on, really noticeable with 
'around town' driving and it even stalls when idling. Also, it sounds 
like the fan or its housing is bouncing around within the plastic roof 
case and is quite noisy on bumpy roads. I've taken the case off and it 
appears that no screws are loose in the mounting bracket or anywhere 
else. Does anybody have any experience with these AC's? Please note 
that this posting is pretty preliminary, I'll really dig into this 
weekend.

Thanks!

tony
