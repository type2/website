     I  don't  knou  if  you  heard  about  it,  but  there  is  a  good  
lube  like  WD40  but  better  and  come  in  grades.  the  name  is  LPS 
and  the  LPS  1 is  just  like  WD40  but  they  come  In  thiker  and  
better  grade  like  LPS  2 _at_ 3.They also  prevents  corrosion.I  don't  
Know  exactly  how  to  lubricate  the  door  locks  but  is  just  a  hint.
