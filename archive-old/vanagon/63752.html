I'm miffed!  I turned 30 last Thursday, and nobody noticed!

And Tony Moore thus wrote:
&gt; Hi Volks,
&gt; 
&gt; What Ted didn't mention is that it is also his birthday this weekend!
&gt; 
&gt; &quot;Rumor&quot; has it he is turning 31 ;-&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Maybe we could have a list B-Day bash for T'Bear!

&gt; &gt; Everyone and everyone's friends are invited to attend the Cincinnati VW
&gt; &gt; Club's  6th annual Bugfest show and go on  August 16 at the Tri-State
&gt; &gt; Dragway near Cincinnati Oh. Last year we had over 200 vehicles of all
&gt; &gt; types. Plenty of swappers. Primitive camping at the show site on Friday
&gt; &gt; night. List members Tony Moore, Charlie Ford, and myself are planning a
&gt; &gt; party and doing a turkey ( whole) on a grill, assuming it doesn't rain.
&gt; The
&gt; &gt; more the merrier. 
&gt; &gt; If anyone wants to come, I will be glad to furnish directions. Let me
&gt; know.
&gt; &gt; Live long and prosper  TBear
&gt; 
&gt;
