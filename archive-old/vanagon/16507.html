Most people have at least one unique quirk ... you've just found one of mine.

	=&gt; It's PETE never PETER &lt;=

please!!!!!!

Didn't know about the not-on-Sunday thing with respect to &quot;Jacques&quot;.

I was responding to your suggestion.

To consider a Monday evening really does confirm ...  you are not a TREKKIE!!!

No way man!!!

How about I (we DC folks) go back to your other option:

	&gt; 	Sunday evening in the evening at 6pm
	&gt;	 at the zoo bar on CT Ave. across the 
	&gt;	street from the National Zoo as the first selection
