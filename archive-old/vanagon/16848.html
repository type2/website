Subject: Re: Adjusting Valves on '77

&gt;Greetings Volks,
&gt;
&gt;My '77 does not have hydraulic lifters (I think they started in '78) so it's
&gt;time to adjust the valves. I have taken it to my mech. in the past but decided
&gt;to become self reliant and try it myself. 
&gt;
&gt;The Bently book is self-explanatory but does not mention putting the gaskets
&gt;back on. Do I need to but a sealant on the gasket when installing? Are there
&gt;any other tricks to remember or be careful of??
&gt;
&gt;TIA for any votes of confidence/advice.

&gt;P.S. Why isn't there an &quot;e&quot; in vanagon instead of an &quot;o&quot;...as in Volkswagen?
&gt;
I do what Muir says on my 71'  I clean the valve covers and glue the gaskets 
to them.  I also use a bit on grease in the other side (the one which faces 
the head.)
Using this method, you can reuse your gaskets for around 4-5 valve 
adjustments.  This method doesn't leak on my 71.
Hope this helps.
