We got ours from the Sport Rack. 1-800-RACK-USA.  They have stores in
California and Washington.  It looks like they do mail-order too.  I think
Bauer is their own design.  I first saw it mentioned in the vanagon list
several years ago.  The rack we bought, The Revolution, is a brand new design
that solves some of the problems of the previous racks (stability and ease of
use).  From what I can see, it is much better.  They loaned us a standard
3-bike rack for a month, while waiting for the revolution to come in.  That
was very generous, and it also let me experience how much better the
Revolution was.  You don't spend so much time twisting things.  And the rack
doesn't shake around as you drive.

Here are the prices we paid:

Bauer 2 Bike Revolution:  $250
Rack Lock: 					$16
Anti-sway bar and bumpers  $20
2-bike extension	            $ $60.

We carried three bikes up to Lake Tahoe for the holiday weekend.  No
problems, except in learning how to load them, and getting the rack to lock
into place.  But I think these are just adjustment pains.  I'd buy it again.
