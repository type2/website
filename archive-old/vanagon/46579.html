Hi Jonathan,

  You suggested that I &quot;stated you drove 2600 miles and got there the 
next morning?&quot;

  No actually, I left early in the morning and got to the one half of the 
total round trip distance mark the following day early in the evening.  
Despite having pumped all the tires up to about 10 psi beyond their 
official max, just like the speed record boys do to reduce rolling 
resistance, I set no land speed records.  Sorry I failed to communicate 
more clearly.

  Your e-mail address appears very like my &quot;beemer&quot; friends in Stamford 
Ct.  Interesting.

  John Wakefield
