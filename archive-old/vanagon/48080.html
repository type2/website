Subject: Digi-Key catalog online


fellow Geeks and Geekettes:

the entire (or so it appears) product line in the DigiKey electronics 
supply catalog is now online at:

http://www.digikey_dot_com

this is cool for several reasons... they have most of the parts for 
those oddball VW modification projects we seem to find ourselves in, 
they sell blue LEDs :), they AREN'T Radio Shack, and they ARE a 
company located in a small farming community in northwestern 
Minnesota.

their web site is one of the few i've seen that actually is useful in 
terms of providing more than just a glitzy advertisement.
