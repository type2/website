The fact of the matter is simple: I don't care about watercooled VW's.
SPLIT THE LIST

&gt;Dear List Members, 
&gt; Due to the incredible traffic on this list and the fact that many people have
&gt;signed off because of the volume, and the time it takes to run it, I've
&gt;accepted an offer by Ken Hooper (bighouse_at_socomm_dot_net) to host an Aircooled Bus
&gt;list.
&gt;
&gt;I've really enjoyed the nature of this list and I hate to see it split in some
&gt;ways, but I'll still be *on* the AirCooled list, I just won't be running it.
&gt;I believe that this will be the best good for the most people.
&gt;
&gt;The plan is to split the list based on Joel's stats.  AirrCooled bus owners
&gt;will end up on the new list (called type2_at_primenet_dot_com), Watercooled owners
&gt;will stay on the Vanagon list.  If you have both, you'll be on both.  If you
&gt;are a WannaBus or Sniveling Unknown Lurker, then you will stay on the Vanagon
&gt;list.  This transformation will happen sometime in the next couple of days. 
&gt;We will be sharing more details soon. 
&gt;
&gt;Please show Ken the respect and appreciation you have all shown me.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks!
