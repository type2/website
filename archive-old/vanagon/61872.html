&gt;
&gt;Hey,
&gt;
&gt; I used to play around with those cheapo digital clocks that come in
&gt;company logo gift set and such.
&gt;
&gt;One of the things I discoverd is that if you hold down both button at
&gt;once, I think after youve just done the final time adjustment, anyway
&gt;somewhere in the sequence, the clock will do the cycle trick.  I had mine
&gt;cycle between date and time.  Kinda neat for desk top, but not for a car.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Anyway to reverse the process you had to go throught the time set sequence
&gt;againg and then hold down both button again simultaneosuly.  I might add
&gt;that you have to hold for a few second.
&gt;
&gt;Hope this helps.
&gt;

&gt;&gt;Hello;  I have an 87 GL whose digital clock constantly cycles the hours in
&gt;&gt;24 hour mode.  The minutes count out the time faithfully, and accurately.
&gt;&gt;The adjusting holes,  the right one feels okay the left one feels like an
&gt;&gt;oil can or a frog clicker, push it in click, let it out click.  I'll soon
&gt;&gt;have to remove the dash to repair the heater fan,  so if there is any thing
&gt;&gt;else I can repair while I'm in there I'd like to know.   TIA Larry Carter
