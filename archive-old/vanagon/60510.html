Subject: Rear Mudflaps

Hi everyone. I spent some time working in my Westie this weekend.
Decided to stay home since every campground in Oregon will probably be
overloaded on this Memorial Day weekend.
On Saturday I installed the pair of mudflaps originally bought for my
'66 splittie (for about $30 a pair,with hardware and a VW logo, it
definitely beats the dealer's price for a Vanagon one).Took me all day,
but looks great.(Did the two rear wheels). I custom-cut an aluminum flat
bar to hold the rubber piece. I was happy to find a bracket that holds
the rear fiberglass &quot;apron&quot; that 89-91's have. This piece is precisely
in the right spot for a mudflap, so that took care of both outer
supports. For the inner supports, I had to drill into the bar that holds
the engine. I don't think this creates any structural problems, since
the holes were pretty small, and the bar is thick. Not a very scientific
explanation, I know... :)
I am really happy with the end result, I wish I could post a picture.
This is an excellent one-day project. All you need is a drill, a metal
hand saw, nuts, washers and bolts (13 and 10 mm), a metal file(to smooth
corners), a pair of mudflaps(of course...), and a metal bar for support.
For the latter, I used aluminum because of weight, rust and flexibility
issues. The key issue is to coordinate heights and angles in both sides.
I'll be happy to explain more details to anyone that might consider
doing it. Ciao,
Cris.
