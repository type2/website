Subject: Fancy Synchros vs. ?

&gt;&gt; I'd love to have a Synchro but the cost of ownership is beyond my means
&gt;&gt;&lt;sigh&gt;.
&gt;
&gt;amen, brother. amen. :(

Along this thread, perhaps I could get a few opinions from the list.  I've
been saving my money for five years now, hoping to get a VW Camper.  I'm
currently trying to decide whether I want to go cheap and look for a used
camper in great condition, or be patient and await to see what '96 brings.

Though I think that the older busses are beautiful, I'm not a mechanic, so I
think I will shy away from buying one of those.  I'd prefer something that
doesn't require lots of technical maintenance.

If y'all had $30,000 to spend, what camper would get get?  A late-model
syncro?  A late-model non-syncro?  An earlier camper? Or should I wait?
