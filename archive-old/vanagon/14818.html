Subject: Suggestions for installing Home Stereo in '73 Bus

I need some suggestions as to what type of batteries, inverter (if
necessary), charger, etc. to buy to install my home stereo in my bus.  It
includes a 100W amp driving Bose AM-5 (satellite) speakers and a CD changer
as well as a dual tape deck.  I would want to go 5 days between charges
using the stereo up to 8 hrs. a day while travelling (if possible).  It
would also be nice to run a small 110 volt accessory (like a rice cooker)
now and then without worry of overly depleting the charge.

Also, is there a way to install an in-line charger that diverts excess
charge from the starter battery to RV or Marine batteries?

I've checked out the archives in great depth and done outside research but
still can't figure out the best arrangement.  I need someone's opinion who's
done something like this before.  

Feel free to privately email if this list has seen this discussion before
(and I missed it in the archives) ;-).

Thanks much in advance to any and all hints, suggestions, opinions, etc.

Peace,

Mark
