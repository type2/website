&gt;&gt; I'd like to repad the seats in the westy. They have good fabric, but

&gt;&gt; done this? Is it complicated and hard? Do you have to cut the old covers

I also did this on my '73 about 5 years ago.  I bought new covers from a vw 
place in HVWs mag (J.Bugs I think).  For the padding I used carpet for the 
base over the springs and a piece of foam over the carpet.  For the driver's 
side, it has worked very well, adding support that the springs no longer 
had, but on the passenger side, since the springs weren't as weak, the seat 
is a bit too firm (not enough to change it though).
