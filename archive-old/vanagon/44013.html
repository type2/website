&gt;I'm having a difficult time finding a replacement for the coolant temp 
&gt;sensor on my '87 syncro. The VW part (025 906 041-A) doesn't fit my rig. It 
&gt;appears that I have a slightly different thermostat housing. The standard 
&gt;part is larger in diameter and is held in with a clip. My part screws into 
&gt;the housing. I've talked to two dealers and one reputable shop and nobody 
&gt;has seen this situation before. The part number on my part appears to a be 
&gt;Bosch part number, it is 0 280 130 026. Anyone encounter this before? Any 
&gt;idea why my syncro would be unique? One strange clue is on page 24.49 of 
&gt;Bentley where there is a diagram of how the sensor fits into the thermostat 
&gt;housing. It says the retaining spring is not used on syncro vehicles. This 
&gt;implies that syncros have a different sensor and thermostat housing. But 
&gt;everyone tells me this is not so.

Hmmm??  I don't reallt have an answer for you, but I do have a little more
data that might help you get to the root of the mystery.
A while back I replcaed the engine in my '87 Syncro with the engine from a
'90 non-Syncro 4 speed.  My original '87 Syncro engine had an aluminum
thermostat housing and a screw-in temperature sensor.  The 1990 engine had a
plastic thermostat housing and the temperature sensor with the &quot;clip&quot;.  The
wiring connection on the sensor was different than my original also.
 Perfering aluminum to plastic and not feeling like changing the electrical
connection, I just swapped the whole t'stat housing assembly, complete with
sensor.  I figured the difference was a change between 87 and 1990, not a
Syncro / non-Syncro thing.  Maybe it's both a Syncro &amp; a model year
difference.  

Hope this helps.
