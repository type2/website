&gt; I was recently discussing winter vanagon experiences with a buddy of mine,
&gt; and he mentioned that a limited slip rear differential was a factory option
&gt; for two-wheel drive models.  I know a locking differential was a syncro
&gt; option, but was a similar rear diff available for two-wheelies?
&gt;
&gt; Can anyone put this argument to rest???????
&gt;-- End of excerpt from Jon Walton

I have a Haynes workshop manual for second generation transporters upto 1975
and it discusses a limited slip rear diff option.
