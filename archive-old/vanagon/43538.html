Subject: Roof Racks...

Listees... lend me your ears....

	just discovered a cache of busses a few miles from my house...

	my buddy who lives just around the corner says &quot;yeah, they've 
been there for awhile, must be 4-5 of them...&quot; well tonight I checked 
them out from the next yard over, 'cause there is a big dog chained up 
in the back yard...thru a driving rain I saw at least two splitties...
one kinda out in the open( full metal roof rack, some rust on it... 
Green top and bottom, three of the square camper windows...) the other 
was white on top and green on the bottom mostly obscured by vines 
climbing all over it... didn't see any others, but my buddy says they're 
back in the trees more... going back tommorrow if the rain stops...

	My question is: what is a full Splittie metal roof rack going 
for these days...??

	going back with cash in hand...   ;-&gt;
