You can order one from VW or Parts Place or I think Ron Salmon on the 
list sells them, too.
 
&gt;      Does anyone know anything about sandblasting the heads using plastic
&gt; pellets instead of sand, and then coating the heads with enamel top keep down
&gt; the electrolysis corrosion that occurs between the block and the heads?

Don't know anything about this, but I do know that RIMCO does a good job 
of refurbishing heads.
 
&gt;      Do I need any 
special tools to take the engine apart and put it back
&gt; together?  I heard someone say that a special tool is needed to get the
&gt; pistons out but I don't see how that would be necessary if you are going to
&gt; split the block.  Am I right?
&gt; 
You'll still need something to pull the piston pins with, though you can 
probably rig something to do this.  The special tool makes it easy though.

&gt;     I will have other questions later, but these are my initial ones.  Thanks
&gt; for any help.
