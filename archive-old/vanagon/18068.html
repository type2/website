&gt; 	Has anyone in this group had a rubber or braided stainless
&gt; brake hose or oil line fail? The early type IV FI engines had a LOT

Yesterday, there was a post on the Team.Net (autox) list from a guy who
was rebuilding his calipers on his C-Prepared Mustang.  He had noticed
a crack near the crimping of his braided brake lines.

There has been some discussion about using stainless brake lines in the
past on that list.  Most felt they should not be used on the street due
to several reasons.  Not DOT approved, too stiff for stock suspensions,
dirt can get between the braid and teflon tube, fail without warning, etc.

I have a new set for my GTI and they are much stiffer than the rubber hoses.
I have decided not to put them in after hearing about the negatives.
