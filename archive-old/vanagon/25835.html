&gt;I've gotten to the point of trying to make my Westy fridge more usable. 
&gt;But, I'm not sure whether mine is actually working properly. (I know they

&gt;
&gt;It would help me if everyone with a stock Westy could post their fridge 
&gt;temps.
&gt;
&gt;Specifically, what temp would the fridge interior be on a 90 degree day?
The owners manual says that the fridge may not be able to cool food at temps
exceeding 90f, mine does seem to work in that kind of heat if I put in some
frozen squishy blue packs before I start it up
&gt;How cold can you get the fridge interior (at maximum cold)?
 I have only had mine during the summer months but, it got damn near
freezing one night while camping, I did have my supplemental blue packs in it.
