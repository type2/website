Oops! It twaz I (Rusty) who fouled the location of the end/close quote. Sorry!
As I get into my droning drivel I occasionally make mistakes. I tend to
rough out ideas and fill in posts when time permits. The concept of right
lane vs keeping up was a thought that I was gonna develop but spaced it as I
remembered the lovely drive from sunny California at a snails pace. I filled
it out wrong dis time! Sorry Steve I never intended to put words in your mouth.
I have to admit that I am pretty used to driving in relative flat terrain.
When I take the '83 Roadblock (er, ah, Vanagon) in to the hills and
mountians I feel like I oughta be driving on the shoulder of the road much
less in the right lane. Acceleration at 50MPH is as quick as midwestern soil
erosion. I don't count on it at all.

&gt;&gt;&quot;But you have to wonder if this guy was as clueless as
&gt;&gt;he sounds, or was he indulging in a little bit of pompous
&gt;&gt;righteousness, trying to force other to declare how 'right' he
&gt;&gt;was... (by doing the speed limit vs keeping up with traffic).&quot;
