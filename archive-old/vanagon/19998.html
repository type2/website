&gt; I sent away to a British VW Mag that advertised a &quot;Vay Your Interval Wipe&quot;
&gt; relay for VW wipers. I popped out my factory relay and poped in this special
&gt; relay and now I can select any interval for my intermittant wiper setting,
&gt; from, like, a minite to continuous.
&gt; 
&gt; I highly, highly recomend this simple mod to all Vanagon owners. 
&gt; 
&gt; I just tore the ad out of the mag (can't remember which one now, but it
&gt; might be  VW/Audi Car) and put my credit card number on it and specified a
&gt; NYC address. They sent it right away.
&gt; 
&gt; The relay is the ultimate in simplicity since there is no dial to set. You
&gt; set the interval wipe by turning the wiper off and then back on. The length
&gt; of time the wiper is off is the length of time the interval is set to.


Is the relay you got made by VW? I ask because new VWs (at least Jetta &amp; Golfs) 
have this feature.
