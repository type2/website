Like most other Vanagons at some time in their lives, my '91 is =
suffering from external head leaks.  Mine only leaks in the winter =
though..  The last two years, as soon as the temps stay 40 or above, the =
leaking stops.  I had to fill up the reservoir every two weeks or so =
during the winter.

I had a similar experience.  Here in the twin cities, VW does a free 57 point
checkup at irregular intervals.  Last winter they did one so I took the fleet
down for the free check.  After the check, the Syncro developed a head leak. 
Very small, but it was enough to show on the snow after parking overnight. 
This was a vehicle that had never experienced the problem before.

I was told by reliable sources that the dealer probably did a leak check at
max pressure, and that might have opened a small leak.  For the rest of the
winter, I had to refil the tank every couple of weeks.  Now that summer is
sort of here, the problem seems to have gone away.
