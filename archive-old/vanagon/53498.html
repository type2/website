Subject: ?Total Length of Htr Hoses? 

Hi All,

After an attempt to bleed the cooling system on my 84 GL Brownie Bus
last night in 20 degree weather, I burst a heater hose.  Upon inspection
of the other heating hoses I discovered that they are in pretty sorry
shape.  I need to make a run to FLAPS for replacement hoses; however,
before I do I would like to hear from anyone out there who knows how much
hose I will need.  The  T-fittings for the rear htr core are real
nasty looking.  I hope FLAPS can help out on those.  Is there a special
type or size of htr hose I should get?  I imagine it's not an exact
science.  TIA,
