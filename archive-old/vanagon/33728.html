Subject: Re: 71:Timing:Carb... (getting long)

Joe, Joe, Joe.  You're giving me conflicting info.  How can I help in this
diagnosis if you don't give me all the facts?  Now, after reading the
following pargraphs of yours, I have some new ideas:

&gt;Yes, the bus idles fine at all times...and this only occurs when I push
&gt;down hard on pedal. I can push slowly and get it to accelerate (raise
&gt;rpms) fine, but when I'm at a stoplight, I can't get no satisfaction (and
&gt;neither can the driver behind me)...that is, this slow acceleration and
&gt;subsequent torture of my clutch doesn't get me out of the way fast
&gt;enough. It appears to be more severe during the first 10 minutes of driving.
&gt;
&gt;...The other thing I'm
&gt;thinking now is that once the bus is *really warm* (e.g., after driving
&gt;10 miles), this problem gets minimal and I experience other problems...
&gt;


&gt;From previous thread you said:

&gt;...The problem doesn't occur when engine is cold; only after engine warms
&gt;up. I &gt;may be wrong in calling it a &quot;Flat spot&quot;; it's more like a
&gt;stalling. It occurs
&gt;only upon acceleration.


So what gives?  Which is it?  Does the hesitation go away after full warm
up?  No wonder you can't figure this out, you're confusing yourself, are
you reaching the end of your rope (thread)?  To properly troubleshoot you
must be certain to follow a step by step program to eliminate factors, and
be certain about what you're looking for.


Now, lets troubleshoot:
A) Check the air cleaner and tube for obstructions just to eliminate it.

B) Lock the choke open, (chokes suck anyway).  Also, did I see in a
previous thread that you took that choke from the Jap carb?  Not a move
that I approve of.  (By the way, if the choke is staying closed you will
burn your valves!!).

C) At the engine temp that is most troublesome, look down the throat of the
carb with a mirror and with the engine running (watch out for the belt).
And make sure that gas is squirted down out of the accelerator pump tube
when you open the throttle.

D) make sure your thermostat and air control flaps are working properly.
(PLEASE tell me that they're there.  Too many hack mechanics remove them
and then owners down the road get screwed).

E) Does this hesitation happen all the time ie. whether you're in neutral
or in gear?  If it only happens under load, that's important info.


Once you've done all that I can give you a better diagnosis, but you need
to do it.  You can't be too thorough, but you can be too vague.

My preliminary diagnosis:

If the hesitation is worse w/ engine cold.  There is probably no/not enough
heat getting to the heat riser tube of the manifold.
Check the exhaust tubes to make sure they're not plugged/blocked/or holey.
The mix is not warm enough when the engine is cold, but after everything
warms up things are okay.  This problem would be worse as the outside temp
goes down. (where do you live?)


If it is worse when the engine is warm.  Not enough fuel is getting to the
engine when you step on the throttle---the accerator pump tain't doing its
job.  This could be a intermittent problem that could be related to heat
and the overly fuel rich mixture while the choke is on would make the
problem a little better when the engine is cold. I stick to switching
carbs.  Even if you just rev up once and shut off the engine you might
glean important info.  If the hesitation didn't occur it's a proplem with
the carb for sure.

What I don't think it is:
Ignition-plugs-timing.  A problem with all that would tend to cause missing
and SLOW acceleration rather than hesitation.  Plus, once the car is up to
speed you don't have problems right? Does the engine run smoooth once it's
up to high revs?  By the way, have you checked to make sure that all four
cylinders are working?  A broken plug wire can cause a cylinder to work
sometimes and not others and would cause all kinds of power/heat weirdness.

Finally, what is the history of this bus?  When did you get it and what
have you done to it? What did you do in the top end rebuild?

What is your history? How much experience do you have with mechanics and
volksies? Have you read Muir's book thouroghly?  What is your town's
altitude?  All this is helpful stuff for me.

Also, the deceleration problem sounds like a timing problem.  Time it
statically and see what happens.  But if you're still using the 009
distributor that is probably  characteristic.  What makes that dist good is
it's quick timing curve, which means on decelleration, it will slow down
the engine down more quickly, hence the &quot;feeling that some has a rope
attached to the rear bumper&quot; and the popping (farting) noises.

Whew, that was a long one.
