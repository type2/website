&gt; For my 1971 Dark Blue VW bus (not my '71 White/Blue bus):
&gt; 
&gt; I need help in finding a deal on a transmission.
&gt; The last time I bought a rebuilt one was about 7
&gt; years ago and it cost me $350 here in San Diego.
&gt; 
&gt; As you probably know, transmissions were nearly identical
&gt; from 1968-1972. The 1971-72 group has a different bell-
&gt; housing and a different release bearing. So if I use
&gt; anything from before 1971 I have to swap the bell
&gt; housing or use the old release bearing and clutch.

Are the transmissions in the 73 different?  I have an extra one I would
like to get rid of (especially since I am moving soon).  I'd be happy to
get $75 for it...
