&gt;  How many of you have elected to run a second &quot;coach&quot; battery, isolated

I have an inverter.  It is touted as &quot;modified sine wave&quot; but I think it is
only a 2 or 3-step square wave inverter.  It runs most appliances pretty
well, but I also have some concerns about the wave form.  My question is
thus:  Does anyone know if one of those &quot;line conditioners&quot; would &quot;smooth
out&quot; the wave, so to speak?  Could one just install a line conditioner
inline with a square wave inverter and get smooth sine-wave current out?
Or would the waveform not be better than what went in?  Isn't that the line
conditioner's purpose?  I'm tempted to try it, but I suspect if it was that
easy it would have already been done in the inverter itself.  Comments?
