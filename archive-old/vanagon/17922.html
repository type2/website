Subject: RE: AC Compressor for '85 Vanagon?

&gt;From: dbax_at_mindspring_dot_com (Donald Baxter)

&gt; Has anyone on the list had to find a new AC Compressor for their Vanagon.  I
&gt; have had mine at the AC shop waiting for one since Tuesday and although they
&gt; say one has been located and is being shipped, I am beginning to doubt their
&gt; word.  Will only one kind of compressor work?  Is VWs method of mounting a
&gt; compressor that specific?

My father and I replaced the ac compressor last year on our 85 vanagon.
We replaced the compressor with a new one that was for a volvo.  Several years
ago he had gotten a new radial compressor for one of his volvos but sold it.
The compressor was put away in our collection of used compressors.  When the
compressor died we went through the collection and found that it was basically
the same.  The only difference was the hoses were connected on the side while
the vanagon hoses were connected from the rear.

Anyway he got the compressor from a truck refrigeration (reefer) place and
got a good deal ($175 I think) because he knew the guys there.  So the money
we saved from the compressor went into the making of new ac hoses because
of the differences where they are connected.  The compressor mounted right in
place on the ac mount without any problems.

I took apart the old compressor just for fun.  It has five pistons/cylinders 
mounted on a disk that spins around.  What caused it to stop was that one
of the connecting rods broke out of the disk and then hammered the disk to
death until it seized.  Quite Interesting to look at.
