Subject: Fuel pump relay, where is it?

Hello all,
Thanks for the suggestions on what was causing our '81 Vanagon Westy to 
die. After a day of tuning up and diagnosis, we have come to the conclusion
that the fuel pump relay is shot. The fuel pump is only getting current
when the ignition is in the start position. As soon as the key is released
and goes into the on position, there is no current to the fuel pump. Now
we know what the problem is, but the Bentley manual doesn't show where
the fuel pump relay is located. Can anyone tell us the location in an
'81 Vanagon, and what the bugger may look like?
Thanks,
Lisa
