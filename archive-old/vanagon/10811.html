Howdy,

	Today was a bus day, first time in like 2 weeks that it hasn't rained!

	Anyway, I bought some Sani Cleen that the guy on the VW list recommended,
and experimented a little.  I took another latch that i had and dunked it
in it.  It clean up FAST, but stunk like hell.  Hint - don't use this 
stuff in the kitchen.

	This stuff is nasty!  I got a drop or so on my finger and it stung like
crazy!  I went right out and got some gloves!  I feel like I'm using the
force of the dark side when I'm using this stuff, its that strong!

	I ended up using it to eat away the rust on my front floorboards.  They
were pretty bad.  I got the passenger side done and painted, by applying
the stuff, letting it sit, and hosing it off;  It took about 4 cycles.

	I also took out the passenger windshield and cleaned the rust out, both
with this stuff and a wire wheel.  Got evrything prettied up and painted,
and then re-installed the window.

	Minor setback, though.  I tried to remove the driver's winshield, and
it cracked.  All I did was peel the rubber back and push on the window
with mu finger, and that was it.  Its been delaminating pretty bad 
anyway, so it probably won't last much longer.  The passenger one is the
same way; in fact, its delaminated to the point that you can see the two
pieces of glass move when you handle the window!

	Today's other accomplishment is applying some seam sealer inside the
ventilation duct.  On my bus, for some reason, the sides of the duct, 
above and in front of the windsheild, were not sealed.  So when you drive,
you get cold air up thru there, and there is no way to shut it off!  I
used auto-body seam sealer and closed the gap.  I don't know why I have this
gap, my '67 didn't; does anyone else have it?  BTW - The easiest
way to do this operation is to take the square plate off of the control
box of the system.  While I was in there, I painted everything real nice like.

	Well, tomorrow I head to the junkyard in search of the tubes to connect the
bus to the heater boxes, and a back mattress for the bed.

GO Niners!
