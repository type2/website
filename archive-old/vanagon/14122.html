A short account of the weekend:

I carpooled with Jack Stafford and Scott Harvey and arrived about 1pm,
an hour later than planned due to my tardiness at the meeting poing and
the long hills to climb.  Several others were already there.  I was
disappointed to find the wind blowing rather hard, but the weather
was clear.  We screwed around for most of the afternoon - especially
Martha, who spent hours perfecting her hot shower setup.  It seems that
all of the prodding to bring wood payed off - we had enough for a
week in the Yukon!  We started up a fire and had some good grub, which
consisted of, um... beer, and something else.

Saturday we piled into four of the busses (mine, Bradleys, Marthas, and
Jacks) and headed up to Burro Schmidt's famous tunnel.  Except that I
took us up the wrong road, which wasn't really a road, but more like
a wash.  After some remarkably entertaining off-roading by everyone,
we decided that we really needed to get on to the tunnel, so we turned
around and went up the correct road, which, though not as bad as the
first, was still entertaining.  Martha's friend Bob seemed to like sitting
on top of Martha's westy, in the luggage rack, and filming the expedition.
Along the way, we met up with Dave Phillips, who had been biking earlier
and had driven out to meet up with us.  Remarkably, he was able to find
the correct road the first time with a map that I drew him, while I, with
the original map, got lost.  Hmmm...  Anyway, the tunnel was great, and
the li'l ole lady guarding it was veeeery interesting.  Don't have time
to relate everything she told us.  

Next we headed into Randsburg (pop. about 89) for some grub.  Ate at the
White House Saloon, and looked around at all of the burned down buildings.
This place has really good food!  Puts yer average Stuckeys to shame.  But
what doesn't?  Really, if you are in the area (hah!) you have to eat
lunch at the White House Salooon.

Back to camp, and another, larger campfire.  A couple of friends of mine
from Ridgecrest brought us a pot of beef stew and joined in the fireside
chat.  This because one of them found out that there was a Jimmy Buffett
fan (Scott Harvey) amongst us.  *GROAN*  Other highlights of the evening
were the sampling keyboard brought by Eric of Ridgecrest, and the bar of
Magnesium, which we somehow managed to melt and set on fire inside a tin
can.  The resulting light illuminated most of the campground, and was
accompanied by jeers in the direction of the boy scout troop camped
across from us - we showed *them* some ingenuity - hah!  Little punks... =)
We also managed to melt several beer bottles into odd shaped lumps of
glass - hours of fun!  We found out that the bottles explode if you heat
up a small area on the side with a torch.

One thing we never got around to doing was a group bike ride - have to
do that next time.  And after seeing the antics of the RC cars brought
by Dave Kautz's kids, I would like to suggest that we each pick up one
of those pups for the next trip.  Boy are they fun!  

Thanks again to all those that attended - I consider it a successful
bash, and hope it is the second of many!

-David
