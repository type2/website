&gt; 
&gt; &gt; For those like Stuart who have leaking seals due to blow-by, a powder
&gt; 
&gt; No, actually my seals don't now leak all that much, amazingly enough. Oh they
&gt; do leak, but the real problem that causes an instant need to clean the 
&gt; vanagon's rear is ... not getting the oil cap on tight enough.  I am just
&gt; going to have to resolve myself to using channel locks to put it on an
&gt; take it off.  If I do that, the problem is not so bad.  But, if I don't
&gt; then that thing will blow out about 1 1/2 quarts of oil in under 15 min
&gt; at highway speeds.  My wife and I are thinking about methods of putting oil
&gt; into the thing without having to open the oil cap.  One idea ... install a
&gt; switch in the front which runs to a gallon tank of oil and an old windshield
&gt; washer pump. :)  Stuart Hutton



I would suggest a pull trailer, with a small 14 hp B/S gas powered pump
that could draw the necessary ammount of oil a that right time!
