&gt;&gt; Ask about lubricants and get:
&gt;&gt; 1. Pee out the window
&gt;&gt; 2. Use the front door
&gt;&gt; 3. Take a porta Potty - or bucket.

OK, so you didn't like my first answer then .... like Alistair said, get the 
track clean and clear of crud. Since the ball bearings that the door rides 
on are prelubed and sealed there is no point in greasing the lower track. 
Just holds grit in. Same for the upper, I oilspray them to keep rust down 
and then wipe them out. Unless your bearings are frozen up and dragging long 
the track that is. The noise you hear is a steel wheel rolling/bouncing on a 
hollow steel beam, not quiet in the least. The slab sides of your sliding 
door resonate in sympathy with all this producing the telltale noise. Take 
off your inside door panelling, slap noise deadening patches on, maybe add 
some high density fibreglass insul. (noise batting) and put it back 
together. The added weight of the noise reducers will help keep the door 
from bouncing.
OR.... use the front door/piss in a bucket or sink or out a window.  tim s.
