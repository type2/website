&gt;David, where are you planning on mounting your gauge(s)? I've been 
contemplating
&gt;adding the magic trio (oil temp, press, cyl head temp), but haven't 
finalized my
&gt;decision on where to stick them. Anyone, anyone?

I like right on top of the bracket which attaches to the steering column.  
like above the key.

&gt;While we're (I'm) on the topic, for those of you that have build home built 
&gt;gauges (DVM with appropriate senders), does anyone have any resistance vs 
&gt;temp/pressure curves for common (like VDO) senders? Are they linear, at least 
&gt;over the range we'd be interested in?

Hardly, they are far from linear.  More like R(T) = a/(b+T)^.8.  Really hard 
to get a precise mathematical function out of it.  I really need a curve 
fitting program for my spreadsheet.  I don't do that digital stuff.  I've 
been using analog meters.  

&gt;One idea would be to put small digital or bar-graph displays right in the 
middle
&gt;of the Vanagon instrument cluster where the small rectangular dummy indents 
are.

Yea, but what kind of resolution would you have? 10 degrees? more, less?  
You're talking about 20 leds for a simple temp gauge.

I'm almost finished with the circuit and description to post.  Maybe later 
today.
