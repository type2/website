&gt;     &quot;Well you still can't have them but it's OK to have them very
&gt;      small rear lights that could reults in a large pile up when 
&gt;      you brake!&quot;

I've always wondered what the fuzz would have to say about the lights
on my '56!  Especially since they don't have a brake light circuit!
