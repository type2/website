Subject: Re: Why VW's + T&amp;A?


&gt;&gt;&gt; Apparently the T &amp; A magazines do research on this and &quot;most&quot; of
&gt;&gt;&gt; their male reading public do want the T &amp; A pix in the mags.  What
&gt;&gt;&gt; is true, however, is that approximately 12% of the reader base
&gt;&gt;&gt; is female.  Perhaps it would not be a bad idea for them to poll
&gt;&gt;&gt; their female readers and see if they would like Brad Pitt type
&gt;&gt;&gt; people posing with the cars.  To be &quot;fair,&quot; they could then feature
&gt;&gt;&gt; 12% of their photos in such a light.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Hey Martha. I agree whole heartedly. I wouldn't be opposed to seeing a
&gt;&gt; Brad Pitt type posing with a car, or with a product in an advertisement.
&gt;&gt; I wouldn't be so pinheaded to decide a product's worth by the person
&gt;&gt; standing next to it in the ad. That is to be decided by reputation, and
&gt;&gt; by asking you guys at Lenti their opinions. I wouldn't spend as much
&gt;&gt; time on a page with Brad standing in his g-string, but I certainly would
&gt;&gt; have no problem with that. I like to think I'm completely politically
&gt;&gt; incorrect, and proud of it!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;You may not be a pinhead about determing the worth of your auto parts,
&gt;but your stance on the scantily clad women in magizines and ads leads me
&gt;to believe differently about how you determine the worth of other human
&gt;beings.  If you MUST partake in the degradation of women, buy magazines
&gt;devoted to that,                    ^^^^^^^^^^^


Uh, did I miss something?
Where did any of these people degrade anyone?

Or was that a general comment? In  which case, I must ask, since when is
admiring someone's looks &quot;degrading&quot;? I often admire women, and I'm 
certainly
not &quot;degrading&quot; them by doing so. And if/when a woman admires me (a rare
event indeed), I feel complimented, not degraded.

Come on, friends. Admiring someone isn't a crime, or even a bad thing.
Doing something about it, is another matter, though, depending on how
and why. We all know these things, don't we?
