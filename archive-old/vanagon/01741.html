&gt; 
&gt; It is obvious that Joel needs things to do on Fridays, so here's some
&gt; additional fields of data for his list:
&gt; 
&gt; 7. Highest number of people carried in the van

11 fairly comfortably for a 45 minute drive
(78 camper without refrigerator)

&gt; 11. Number of T1 Typ 2s still equipped with an 8-track tape player.
I saw a '74 camper with one that still works!
