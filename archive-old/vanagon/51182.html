 &gt;&gt; Hey Luke , your '86 already has a electronic ignition. ( Hall Generator) 
And so
 does all watercooled vanagons.

 ( you must have been driving your '67 for a looooong time! )

 better hope Mr. Salmon gets that manual to you real soon!  :&lt;) &lt;&lt;

 Yes, I finding out all sorts of neat things.  Check out the post from Joel
Walker.

 True, I drove that '67 'til the wheels fell off.  It has earned it's place of
honor in Luke's Driveway Of Heros. The engine is out now (blew an oil cooler
seal, slung 30 weight everywhere) so I'm taking the time (a Seattle Winter
lasts about 10 months) to fix up all sorts of little things.  The '67 is a
camping machine, but the bed in the back of that Vanagon sure is big...

 I don't expect that manual from Mr. Salmon until at least next week, the mail
being what it is.  But, something to look forward to...
