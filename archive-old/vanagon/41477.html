Those are about the same as the RV &quot;deep cycle&quot; batteries.  In fact, they
are often described as RV/Marine deep cycle batteries.  They are a little
better than starting batteries, but not much (at least in my experience -
20 years worth (yes, I've been playing with batteries since before I was
10!)).

Spend a little more and get golf cart batteries.  They are a bit closer to
a true deep-cycle battery, and will last a lot longer than an RV/Marine
type.
