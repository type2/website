I've only seen one in the ditch in the three years I've been here in Kodiak,
Alaska. (No, it wasn't mine.) I haven't had any major problems, though once
did get stuck in the snow with wheels spinning uselessly (right outside my
house -- husband was home and came out to dig me out, all the while making
grumbling comments about me having backed out of the driveway too far and
landed in the snowplow's leavings). I do drive slower than normal in
ice/snow and have four studded tires, but as long as I don't slam on the
brakes, the Vanagon has always done well for me.
