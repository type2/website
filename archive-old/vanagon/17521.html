&gt;Flashback to Volkswagen circa 1957... deja vu!  And Chrysler still claims 
&gt;to have invented the minivan.  Sheesh, even Subaru had 'em beat on that 
&gt;one.  We Volksfolks are sooo far ahead of our time. =)

Sorry Bubba, but my Vanagon is NOT a minivan, in fact I could almost swallow
a standard wheelbase Chrysler product. :-).  If Chysler wants to claim that,
so be it.

You know why the reason why some nights you don't have a dream?
When there's just blackness? And total silence?

Well, this is the reason:
It's because on that night you are in somebody else's dream.
And the reason you can't be in your own dream because
you're already busy in somebody else's dream.
