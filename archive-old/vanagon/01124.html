 Hi,

&gt; * Say you want something Really Neat, but Cheaper?? *
&gt; 18' European VW LT40D 1985.
&gt; the acccompanying picture is pretty neat: for those of you who don't know what
&gt; an LT is, it is a VW truck. looks rather like a Vanagon (in body style), but
&gt; the grill is slightly different and the windshield if a bit larger. anyway,

 My folks had a couple of LTs a while back. They are much more trucklike (to drive) than a type II (must be MAN's influence :-). Both of them were written off,
too- they seemed to be less stable than the smaller VWs and rolled all too
easily. After this my father bought a Mercedes (204?) instead as a bigger van.
There are Camper versions of the Merc vans available in Europe, too. Can you
get them in the US?

 Incidentally, I saw a 4x4 &quot;Eurovan&quot; the other day- pretty neat. I must try
and get a closer look at the mechanicals, though, I imagine that the layout
is fairly complicated!

Cheers,
        W.
