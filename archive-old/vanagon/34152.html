&gt; So why would you gut your cat?  Was it to string a tennis racket or
&gt; fiddle or something?

Ewwww!  cat guts and all!

Hey, I drove my 80 Westy for 3 years with a &quot;gutted cat&quot;.  The one in the
car, that is (no it WASN'T under a seat or someplace.  Give me a break,
it'd stink there, I kept it in the FRIDGE!).  Actually, I had no problem
driving the thing with no converter, but I &quot;felt&quot; bad doing it, and it
didn't pass smog the way I'd set the fuel mixture to where it sounded
right.  The day I last had the guy at the smog test tweak the mixture till
it passed, I was really busy, it was really cold (must have gotten down to
at least TWENTY DEGREES above FREEZING here in so cal that night!) and I
had a USC Geology Christmas party to go to that evening.  Figured I'd
re-adjust the puppy the next day.  Well the next day, I was browsing at
(and I sincerely apologize for this) a FORD dealership at Aerostars (at
least I didn't buy one!).  BUT, when I fired the ol' Westy up to leave, one
of the valve seats decided it didn't like being stuck in that aluminum, and
just hopped out!  Made a heck of a rattling sound!  I shut it off, pulled
the plug, actually SAW the damned thing loose!  It took 45 minutes for the
tow truck to arrive, during which I had no less than ALL of the runny-nosed
salesmen try to get me to trade it in on a new van.  I'm dumb, but I'm not
stupid.  They'd of reamed me if I'd gone for it.  Towed the thing home, put
a rebuilt head on, got a muffler place to agree to weld the flanges from
the old one onto a &quot;generic&quot; converter, and sold it two weeks later.  Thing
ran really great after I put the new converter in.  Those things are
designed to work with the converter/O2 sensor in place.  You'll loose in
performance if you gut your cat! (Frankly, I don't know what would happen
if you gutted your dog, fish, bird, brother, or sister, though).

Man, did I &quot;feel&quot; bad when I sold that thing, looking and running better
than ever!  Damn!

2 cats (live, with guts in place and shedding on the porch furniture even
as you read this).
