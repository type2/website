&gt;&gt;under the dash, but I don't think it would fit well either.  Has anyone
&gt;&gt;actually installed one of those small tube subwoofers in a breadloaf?
&gt;&gt;Where did you put it?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Thanks,

Well, I installed a pair of subwoofer drivers flush on the door panel. They worked
great. I don't remember the brand name of the subwoofers kaus I took them out of
my clunky BMW 2002 which I bought from someone long time ago. The BMW was very
troublesome for me but the subwoofers were great.

They are 6-1/2&quot; in size. I had to cut a round hole on the door panel, no metal
cutting needed. The original Blaupunkt speaker is connected in parallel to the
subwoofer with a capacitor blocking low frequency signal. The combination
worked really good. My stereo is a 10W/chanel cheap unit at about $120. The bass
is plenty and the treble is great from the blaupunkt. 

Door mount is surprisingly good if good subwoofer drivers are installed.
The work required is minimum. Only to cut the door panel. Wiring is there
already. I listen to classical music a lot from both radio and tapes. I am
extremely happy for the quality of piano/violin sound out of it.
