THIS IS MY FIRST TIME WRITING TO THE `LIST'  I HAVE A 79 BUS(2L FI)
WITH 193,000 MILES UNDER MY BELT.  IT HAS A RECENT BOSCH TUNE-UP, 
A GOOD BATTERY AND ALTERNATOR, AND THE FUEL SYSTEM WAS CHECKED TO BE 
GOOD.  MY QUESTION IS WHY IT HAS STARTING TROUBLES.  IT STARTS RIGHT
UP, BUT IT MAKES SOME REAL STRANGE NOISES AND THEN KICKS OVER.
IT ONLY DOES THIS IN THE MORNING WHEN THE BEAST IS COLD.  IT RUNS
SO SMOOTHLY THOUGH THAT I WANT TO DRIVE IT 24/7.  ANY IDEAS, EVEN THOUGH
THE SYMPTOMS ARE VAGUE?
