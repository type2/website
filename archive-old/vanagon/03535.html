Subject: Re: '71 bus fuel cap

I don't think you will find a Stant or any other locking gas cap for a '71
bus. At least I haven't had any luck. If you haven't tried the dealer yet for
a replacement you'll be in for a shock as last time I checked it was $40 or
$50. I have seen aftermarket gas caps for '71 buses that look good
quality-wise. JBugs in Southern California has them in their store and will
mail order. Their phone number in CA is (310)978-0926, out of CA
(800)445-2847. They were about $10 if I recall. You might check your local
wrecking yard as there were two kinds of factory caps. The most common seems
to be a rather thick flat top cap. I have found a couple of thinner caps with
a VW logo embossed over the entire top that are really trick. BTW, I believe
the filler neck size on the '71 may have continued to '72 or '73, and I think
it is shared by the Things. Hope this helps.
