&gt; Hi all,
&gt;
&gt; My '86 Westfalia has failed the CT emmisissions test (for high hydrocarbons and
&gt; CO), and the VW service station I took it to couldnt find an easy fix (short of
&gt; replacing the mass air flow sensor - or new fuel injectors - mucho $$$$$$).
&gt;
Try turning the screw on the air flow meter until it runs rough.  Get it
inspected, then turn it back till it runs right.

&gt; Anyway, they recommended I get some &quot;Emmissions Cure&quot;, pour it into the gas
&gt; tank, drive it for a while, and then take it right in to be tested.
&gt;
&gt; Does anyone have any experience or suggestions, ie - how far should I drive the
&gt; van, and do I need to run the stuff out + refill the tank before I get it
&gt; tested.  Also - any other experience with possible reasons why I failed
&gt; emmissions?

It didn't work for me.  Directions indicate you are supposed to add it
to a tank of gas, drive till almost gone, then test.  Made no difference
for me.
