Subject:       '72 door problem

as usual, my sliding side door thinks it is not part of the bus and 
would like to go its own seperate way.  It looks like the area of the 
door that the bottom roller bracket attaches has rusted out and the 
bracket has pivoted upward.  Does anyone know of a good fix to this 
problem?
