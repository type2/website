Greetings!

How many people in the world can say they waxed their dashboard last 
weekend?

I did!  And it looks great!  You can see your reflection in that 
pretty sealing wax red paint.

Ok, so enough of your boring life, Mike, what's your question?

Situation:

Friend Richard's 1600dp is almost dead.  In just over a year its gone 
from fairly healthy to 1/2 the power of a 1100cc! :)  

So he is going to buy a new engine.  Cost no object.  He wants to 
be able to crush my 1776.

We're talking a 2020, or 2110 (I don't remember the exact cc's on 
these)

But what are your recommendations anyone with experience.  I've heard 
many horror stories of 2000+ sized engines burning up and not 
lasting long.  I'm trying to convince him of durability over power 
(1776).

Our local mechanic buddy will put it together right, and he's 
recommended the 2020 for power.

Anyone?

- Mike White
