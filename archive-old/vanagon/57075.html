&gt; factory fill than any ATF.  Both BEntley and owners manual say ATF, I know,
&gt; but all the seals in my rack failed simultaneously about 3 months after
&gt; flushing and filling with STPs Dexron-III ATF.  My gut feeling, after $400
&gt; for getting my rack rebuilt, is that ATF will never get in there again.
&gt; YMMV.  Tim SMith

Factory US fill was ATF till at least '86, no lying, I remember it well 
from the '86 we bought new.  As I have mentioned before all FWD 
VW's migrated from ATF to Pentosin at or around '88-'89 era.  VW is 
very specific in it's owners manuals about the later G? hydraulic 
oil, being incompatible with ATF, and they price theirs like gold, 
the Pentosin is about $16/liter around here.  As a general key in 
other VW's when they changed from the short squat 4&quot; or so round, 4&quot; 
high resevoir (as in the Vanagon) to the taller thin 3&quot; or so round 
5&quot; high resevoir they changed to the Pentosin fill.  I have never 
owned a late Vanagon since new so can not comment on any change, but 
I'm actually a bit suprised if they did as the system was designed 
around the heavier oil.  Tim and I have discussed this before but in 
general anyone filling/rebuilding their system should simply replace 
it with WHAT IS IN IT.  ATF is very red, and even if burnt (which it 
will never be from a P/S system) it retains a sickly sweet smell.  
The Pentosin is origionally brown or brownish green.  U can see and 
smell the difference.  And REPLACE the filter when changing the 
fluid, it is in the resevoir and is probably a dealer only item.  
Furthermore the '85 came with a commercially rebuilt rack that has 
been running fine on ATF for some time, and probably origionally 
featured ATF.
