Subject: Electrical problem?


I have an electrical question/problem. The  
voltmeter on the dash of my vanagon reads, 
when the engine is running and no additional 
electrical loads, 13.9-14 volts. (Before 
installation I checked this VDO voltmeter 
against a Fluke digital meter and it is quite 
accurate). Back at the battery, my old analog 
meter reads 15.1 volts under the same 
conditions. When I turn on every electrical 
device, the dash voltmeter reads just a hair 
above 12, but the battery voltage reads just 
under 15. I know that the old analog meter at 
the battery is not awfully accurate, but could 
the discrepancy between the two readings be 
due to bad contacts up at the fuse/relay 
panel and multiprong ground connections in 
the same area? Would pulling off all of the 
spade connectors at the fuse panel and 
cleaning them be the way to go? BTW I have 
a 90 amp alternator and the battery checks 
out OK.
