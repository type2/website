Subject: Busses for sale

I talked to a guy today that had the following busses for sale

64 Kombi  - solid, painted black, little rust, I wasn't to interested in this 
bus so the price slipped by but I think he said $2000

74 Westie - Selling for a friend, runs great, looks great no rust, 
 complete interior, 
good  condition $2500 but could talk down to $2000

non-bus

56 Oval Ragtop - Unknown 

Call Eric at 801-756-8646
All the usual disclaimers apply

I was too slow and missed the 64 double cab $2000
