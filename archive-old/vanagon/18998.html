Why not, but not the first two weekends in July....

&gt; 
&gt; 	Pescados is the place with the bus on the wall, shown in one of

I'm sure you will provide a superb description how to get there!

&gt; 
&gt; 	I don't know what else you'd want to do in Sac: we don't have a 
&gt; lot to offer.  Any ideas?
&gt; 
&gt; 	The only things that come to mind are Old Sac, maybe going to one
&gt; of the river beaches.  Maybe I'll come up with something better later...

How about combining these two things with a bike ride on the American 
River Pkwy (is supposed to be very nice, and we all have vans/busses to 
haul the bikes around, right?)?
