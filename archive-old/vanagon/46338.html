&gt; Gerry,
&gt; 
&gt; I appreciate the effort someone else is going to put into an aircooled van 
&gt; list...however, I think that there has ALWAYS been something special on this 
&gt; list which transcends air v water v T1 vT2 v T3 v T4 vans, and I would hate 
&gt; to see this disapear when the split window/loaf/early brick crowd has spun 
&gt; off onto another list....

Ric,

I don't think this list will lose it's integrity as much as you think.
I believe that those that enjoy the comraderie and general 'family' feeling
of this list will log on to both.  And the rest will log on to the separate
list of their choice.  For those that want to have less postings, I think
the desired effects of the split will not be as great as they'd like.  I
for one will be on both lists, not just because I have both vehicle types,
but because I want to stay tuned to both groups for ALL of their contri-
butions.  Yes, I even read EV posts if they peak my technical interest.
Just want to know what VW is doing on these puppies. :)

Over-and-out.  ;p
