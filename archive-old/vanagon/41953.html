Subject: June 1996 Car &amp; Driver

Latest C&amp;D has an article about what rolling stock the editors would 
buy with a budget of 48K.  Phil Berg, Senior Editor, came up with the 
following list:
1996 Mazda Miata   $20,400
1989 VW Vanagon Camper GL Syncro $12,750
1996 Ducati 900SS  $8095
1987 Subaru Brat  $2050
1996 Yamaha Riva Scooter (to attach to Syncro)  $`1399
1996 Nigel Dennis Kayaks Romany 16  (up top) $1940
1996 Rockhopper Comp A1 FS bicycle (with scooter) $849
1996 Karavan KS-58 snowmobile trailer  (for Miata) $499

Total                    $47,982                                  

his comment on the Syncro:
&quot;The crafty VW is a far better place in which to spend a day than in 
an airport corral and cattle-hauler Beoing 737. It also helps keep alive the
 road-trip spirit of the late John Muir (the New Mexico mechanic
 and author, not the California naturalist).&quot;
The other editors do not share Mr. Berg's opinion as reflected by 
their lists (Hondas and Mini- Vans)
