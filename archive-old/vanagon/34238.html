Subject: RE: NY-Paris auto race in '04?


&gt;Back in about '04 there was a NY-Paris auto race. The orginal plans
&gt;were to  cross the Pacific at the Bering Strait, which is frozen over
&gt;between Alaska and Russia in the winter. The route was changed to
&gt;include a SFO-Kamchatka ferry instead of the Alaska leg, but
&gt;communications being what they are, some participants didn't get the
&gt;word and did the Bering thing anyway.


The movie &quot;The Great Race&quot; (Tony Curtis, Natalie Wood, Jack Lemmon)
portrayed a race along this route. Some of the participants *floated*
across the Bering Strait on an iceberg!

Are you saying that there really was such a race in real life?

VW Content:  A splittie woulda left them all in the dust. And its 6:1
compression ratio would have run fine on the questionable gas they had
back then too!
