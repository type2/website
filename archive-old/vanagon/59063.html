Subject: Re: EV paint finish rust

MY 93 GL's rear hatch has been repainted twice by my dealer . In 95 I noticed
rust arond the window and and small pin holes of rust all over the hatch.
rust was also at the lift handle. Then last fall ( 96 ) the rust came back
around the window so they painted it again. The dealer painted it both time
at no charge. Now i notice very small dots of rust forming on the drivers
door. Whene the weather warms up i'll take a closer look.   SPENCER
