&gt;really cool here ?
&gt;        G.

G:

NEATO is NorthEast Association of Transporter Owners, and
yes you are missing something.  First you're missing an
excellent newslstter and also the annual directory of people
across the country (400 or so) who will help bus people who
need assistance on the road or just like to talk buses.

The last newsletter had 30 split-window buses for sale plus
a few later models and many sources for parts and
accessories.

Membership is $20 a year:

NEATO
P.O. Box 4190
Albuquerque, NM 87196

And tell them Dave Easterwood sent you.  He started this
thread.
