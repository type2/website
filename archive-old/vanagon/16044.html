&gt; &gt; a must.  Is this a correct assessment?  A mention was made of some blue 
&gt; &gt; stuff from VW dealers.  Can color alone differentiate phosphate from 
&gt; &gt; non-phosphate? I have what appears to be the usual green stuff in my 
&gt; &gt; Vanagon now, I have no idea what brand it is.  Should I change this stuff out?  

I'd like to say again for the record, our '86 came factory filled with
green stuff, as did our '89 Jetta, and mom's '90 Passat, my '90
Corrado has the blue stuff but was refilled after a water pump died
under warranty in '92, so I figure there is a good chance some
genuine Autobahn green stuff could be out there, I personally used
the new &quot;5 year&quot; phosphate free ZEREX stuff in the Corrado, about
$5 the gallon in a silver jug, seems fine but who knows.
