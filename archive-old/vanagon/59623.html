I think it would die if it became a newsgroup.   I'm strongly opposed.
Having a strong moderator who can occasionally throttle is very important.

&gt;&gt;I just want to mention that I'm willing to run the list, but I'd need to
&gt;&gt;purchase a machine and software (LISTSERV) to host the list, which would
&gt;&gt;cost approximately $1500.00.  Bandwidth is not a problem... my site has a
T1.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;If folks on the list are willing to pony up an average of $3 apiece for a
&gt;&gt;host machine and the LISTSERV software license, I'll run the list.
