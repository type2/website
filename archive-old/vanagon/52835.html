Subject: Re: deer slepping 

&gt;ive always found it odd how some animals can sleep so peaceful by the side
&gt;of the road. like deer and squirrel seem to have a passion for it like dogs
&gt;and cats.  
&gt;
&gt;when i die, i want to go in my sleep, like my grandfather, not yelling and
&gt;screaming the other passengers in the car.
