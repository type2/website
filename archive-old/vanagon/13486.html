Subject: RE: Ignition Wires...

Harry,

A couple of weeks ago I posted an article about my distributor harness getting 
swapped in my '90 Syncro Westie.  It was an absolute disaster as the airflow 
control computer went apesh*t and the Syncro started running on only two or 
three cylinders.  It was apparently pouring raw fuel into the intake (possibly 
from the cold start injector) and we had the hardest time diagnosing it.  The 
dealer, out of pure frustration, had another '90 on the lot with the original 
wiring and swapped the used harness in, and voile'..... problem solved...  

Turns out that the OEM replacement harness from VWAG/US was the only harness 
that was compatible with the electronics in the Syncro....   At nearly 
US$100.00 per set, they are nearly gold and way out of line with the 
marketplace.  What we finally discovered the problem to be was that the Bosch 
replacement harness gave the AFC computer the wrong readings (resistances) and 
sent the entire FI system into a tizzy.  If anyone else has run into this 
problem, you may want to consult with your Service Manager and see if there is 
a service bulletin on this very issue.  If someone could get a copy (God 
forbid) of this Service Bulletin, I think we'd all be interested in getting a 
copy via the discussion board.....

Good morning all.  

I'm getting the van ready to commence camping next 
week, and now that she's all cleaned up, detailed to the max, 
polished, waxed, and most gear in place, I decided to check over 
the ignition leads after detailing the engine.

I'm not sure what this means, so I am hoping that someone on the list 
can give me a hand here.

I measured the resistance of the coil to distrib. wire at 1000 ohms.  
Bentley says 2000 -+800.  The spark plug leads measured at 3500 ohms, 
and Bentley says 6000 -+1000.  These measurements are from end to end 
which includes the resistors.

Since the resistance I am getting is approx half of what it should 
be, is this good, bad or OK?  Is it time to get new wires?  The van 
has 112500 km (70000 miles) on it, and is 5 years old.  My 
multi-meter isn't the best in the world, but I'm sure it couldn't be 
that far out (I properly calibrated it, etc).

BTW, the stock wires are made by BREMI of Germany.  I thought they 
would have been Bosch wires, but not so on my van.

Thanks for any advice.

Harry.
