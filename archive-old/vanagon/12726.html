Subject: Question on 72 Westy Carb Problems

	Hi,
		I was wondering if anyone else out there
has a Weber Carburetor in place of the stock dual Solexes
in there 72 bus ? It seems that the setup I have just is
NOT performing in weather below 32 degF ! It idles very
poorly and stalls out , until it warms up (~5minutes of
this ) . Once the weather warms up, it has no problems.
I have a feeling its icing in the manifold thats causing
this. Has anyone had similar experiences ? Please advise.
		thanks,   guntram

ps. is there a reliable source for Weber related parts ?
