&gt;&gt;Whatever ya do stay away from Bosch Filters - they're junk (they burst 
&gt;&gt;when &gt;engine is cold).  If using OE, use Mann or Knecht.
&gt;
&gt;I almost always used Bosch oil filters in my '81 diesel Rabbit (from
&gt;119,000 miles to 271,000) in temps from +100 to -30 and never had one
&gt;burst.  I did have to use a Napa filter when I was at Fort McCoy, WI
&gt;once and that came with a warning about bursting.
