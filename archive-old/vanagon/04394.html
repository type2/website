&gt; I have one more theory to add to this thread.  Is it possible that
&gt; this is like the recirculation control on an air conditioning system?
&gt; It would work something like this... Fresh air vents closed, door
&gt; panels open, heater on.  Then the source of air *into* the heat
&gt; exchangers will be prewarmed air from the cabin so that things will
&gt; get nice and toasty?
&gt; 


John Nice theory; but one problem. The air intake for the heater system is
way at the back - the rubber bellows which are attached to the fan which
is in turn run by the alternator - sucks in air from outside the van. You do
raise an important point though - heating would be improved if hot air
could be constantly recirculated rather than fresh all the time. There is
a way to do this on earlier busses but such a setup would be more difficult
for Vanagons. I have contemplated using the 2nd oil cooler as an extra source
of heat but since it is under the van, would not want to take its bad &quot;road
air&quot; into the van.

My guess is that the cumulative wisdom and experience at VW resulted in
the door panel vents. Owners of bugs know that heat and fresh air flow is
dramatically improved if one or more vents or windows is open slightly.
Perhaps in a similar way, opening
a door vent decreases the pressure in the Van (or at least equalises
it with the outside) - while at the same time not allowing fresh or cold
air in thereby permitting a faster flow of hot and fresh air from the
other functional vents.

Speaking of VW's cumulative wisdom - if anyone has downloaded the windtunnel
GIF from the gopher it is quite amazing. In essence they compare the
original rounded bus design with the Brick design which judging from the
drag coefficients comes up way short. This begs the question of why VW
went with the flat face if they knew as early as 48 that the rounded
shape was more efficient. Any ideas?

Just a thought - DC
