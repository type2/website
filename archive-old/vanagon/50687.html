Subject: KC Swap Meet Rpt/67 Westy Windows?

Hi All,

A great MoKan VW Club Kansas City Swap Meet went on today.  Many list
members were there, several meeting each other for the first time (always
a strange experience).  We had about 30 vendors in the great Fall weather,
lotsa stuff exchanged hands.  I wasn't actively selling much, but here's
what I came home with:

85 1.9 Vanagon Wasserboxer motor-complete
Single axle Bug trailer 
36 hp Factory VW remanafactured crank w/ brgs
36 HP NOS htr pipes (thanks Bob &amp; Howard Hufford!)
73 Thing fan shroud (doghouse, no fresh air htr outlets)
Grooved front bus bumper
Deluxe Bus front bumper ( not all that great )
Funky homemade front bus bumper
Hurst Bus trigger Shifter
Alum. Buggy Gas tank ( $20 )
Full set of 67 Westy Windows (panel style).  BUT on the driver's side it
 is a one piece unit about 5 feet long.  The outside windows are normal
 looking slat style and the middle is about 2.5 feet fixed pane.  I have
 never seen  one like this before.  Anyone know the story on them?

Interesting stuff, not purchased:

16&quot; slotted Porsche wheels, early 50's
6V Bus rear AC unit, mounts above rear hatch on a 65 Dormobile
Puma Kit Car driver (Brazilian) 4k
Fiberfab Jamaican kit car (project)
A set of 5 hole Ansen alum. whls
Early Ghia taillight assembly (cracked glass)
62 Ghia, 2nd owner all original (4k)
And *lotsa* other stuff  8-)
