Subject:  reverse light switch wanted for cheapie

i accidentally broke off  the prongs on my switch (the plug-type thing in
the front driver's side of the trans, part # 251 941 521) when i was
putting the trans back in - ouch!  (actually my most helpful friend did it) 
new one is $20 at german automotive - anyone got a spare lying around
(i know - fat chance, but i thought i'd try)  they would want to get rid of
for less?  if so, please let me know, and thanks.
