Subject: Re:  crutchfield/stereo


Ya,  I just talked to them about the pioneer sub.  They REALLY like
it.  I've just bought an active crossover and some other goodies
to go along with my Infinity CS-5's (which are in the door).  The
sub is a real problem to locate which I plan to solve real soon.  

If anyone has installed a sub, I'd like to hear about where they
put the thing.  I'd hate to clog the area between the front seats
and I use the floor space under the mid seats for other junk.  Was
thinking about trying it on the floor up against the front of the driver
seat.  Since I'm vertically challenged (only 5'6&quot;) there's a bit
of room there.  :-)

I've bought lots of stuff from these folks in the past, their prices
are slightly higher than the cheapest mail order, but service
is superior.

 &gt;I just received a catalog form Crutchfield (stereo stuff), and noticed
 &gt;at least 2 items in there that may be of interest to bus/vanagon folks:
 &gt;(both items appear to be new on the market)
 &gt;
 &gt;1.  Pioneer Subwoofer TSW-X30 (fits behind the seat in places
 &gt;like a small pickup truck).  It's a slim box containing a single 5.25&quot;
 &gt;speaker, tandem duct bass reflex design.  approx 14w x 10h x 6d (inches),
 &gt;Item # 130TSWX30, $129.95.
 &gt;
 &gt;2.  Pioneer subwoofer TSW-X50 (fits inside your spare tire rim).  Fits
 &gt;inside wheels that are 13&quot; or wider.  You need an amp of 40 or 50 watts
 &gt;RMS to produce strong bass.  13.75&quot; diameter x 4.75&quot; depth,
 &gt;Item # 130TSWX50, $129.95.
 &gt;
 &gt;If anyone already has these, or gets them, I know I and probably others
 &gt;on the list would be interested in your comments.....
 &gt;
 &gt;/martha
