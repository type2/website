Subject: Should I buy Sergio's van?


Dear listmembers,

This is not part of the friday follies. Most of you remember Sergio's 
stories. I kept in touch and he told me that the van is now fixed. A 
different dealer in Mississippi found a ground connection in the ECU 
computer unit to be loose. Sergio wants to sell the van to me.

Here is my question: Can anybody tell me if all the problems he had 
(hesitating/stalling for about 20k miles, some breakdowns because of 
that) may have caused serious damage to some of the van's components 
(like transmission, bearings, etc.)? The van has now 67k miles on the 
clock, should I worry about these things?

Apparently he had it checked out by an indenpendent repair guy who tells 
me he's gone over everything for two hours, including transmission and 
compression, and that it looks good.

Any advice would be appreciated. Please send me a copy of your reply as I 
have to be on digest these days.

TIA

Joerg
