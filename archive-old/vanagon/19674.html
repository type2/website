DOH.  I wrote that last night, when I was about to fall over from
exhaustion.  My apologies - It *is* true that Martha and Bradley were
participants in GNATT, in fact they braved the cold, rain, and even 
snow to join Shelley and I in Lassen.  Then Martha took us home with
her and treated us to hot showers, a large bed and good food.  Steve
and Linda Johnson also provided all of us with a rest stop when we
went through Sacramento, which was much appreciated.  Thom and Amy
met us there and we got to check out Thom's beautifully painted '56
Kombi.  A far cry from the pictures he sent me a few months ago!  
The little get-together at Marthas place included Bradley, the Kautz's, 
John Hugenard,  and Eugene Palmer with his wild fuel-injected type-I
powered breadloaf!  My apologies for leaving out these fine folx, and
I apologize in advance if I still haven't gotten everyone - my memory
ain't what it used to be!
