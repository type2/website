Subject: 78 Bus Hydraulic Lifters

I own a 78 bus and was driving from Georgia to New York when I lost
compression in the No. 1 cylinder.  So I took the engine apart for a valve
job and found some interesting things about the lifters.  (The valve seat was
gone after only 20000 miles!)

The engine was rebuilt 20000 miles ago by Volkswagen/Audi of Canada.  I
assumed it was a 78.  However, the engine number indicated a late 1975
crankcase.  When I took the push rods out, they were the hollow ones used for
solid lifters(approx 261 cm long).  I preceded to remove the lifters and
confirmed that I did have hydraulic lifters.  So why do I have the wrong push
rods?  Should I purchase the ones for hydraulic lifters or is there a reason
why VW put the ones in that they did?

Thanks for the info

Todd
