Subject: VW Bus Hall Of Shame

        Ok folks, the race to the bottom has begun.  

        I've started the VW Bus Hall Of Shame Page.  Dave Easterwood stepped
up to the challenge and sent me some pix of some really jacked up busses.  I
have a few of my own I have to get scanned:  a '54 Deluxe missing most of
the engine compartment, and another '54 deluxe with a sano IRS rear end!

        Stay tuned for more pix, and if you think you can beat these, then
put your money where your mouth is and email me a picture, or we can make
arrangements for snail-mailing them
