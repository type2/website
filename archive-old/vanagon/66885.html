Subject:  Vanagon Intermittent Misfire

CONDITION
After driving for 1/2 to 2 hours at a constant speed, vehicle
experiences lack of power, cuts-out or stalls, often accompanied by
bucking or jerking of the vehicle.
In ALL cases, the vehicle will restart immediately.  This symptom may
not re-occur for several weeks/months.  Inspection by the dealer results
in nothing conclusive.

Some air-flow meters may experience a vibration resonance of the
metering potentiometer wiper during extended constant driving.  This
resonance causes the air-flow meter to supply an intermittent signal
to the Digifant ECU.  The ECU will then default to a &quot;no-load&quot; condition
and reduce the injection time.

SERVICE
Harness, Part No. 025 906 302, is available to resolve this condition.
* remove electrical connector from air flow sensor (see Figure 24-174)
* install converter assembly, Part No. 025 906 302, between harness and
  air flow sensor
