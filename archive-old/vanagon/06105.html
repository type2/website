&gt; Average around town in  Imperial Gallons   18mpg
&gt; Highway in Imperial gallons - 24 mpg
&gt; Bestever 25mpg
&gt; 
&gt; (The difference between a US gallon and an Imperial gallon is that an
&gt; imperial gallon is =4.6 litres and an US gallon=4 litres (1 litre = 1US
&gt; quart right?) ;) DC 
&gt; 

No, the difference is that one US gallon is 3.785 litres; the ratio of
Imperial to US gallon is 1.200. Remember, Canadian ounces are smaller, which
is why a '40 ouncer' is not 1.25 US quarts. It's less (about 4%).

So at 1.200 x 24, you're getting 28.8 mpg in US terms. WOW!!
