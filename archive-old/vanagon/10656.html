&gt;My questions?  What is this beast worth (roughly), and what do you think a 
&gt;rebuild will cost, given that the engine has 140,000 miles on it without a 
&gt;rebuild, but still runs reliably?  Any potential problems areas to look for 
&gt;when I check this one out?  (The owner of the local shop has already given 
&gt;me a few things to look for.)

How much?  what ever it's worth to you...  I'd insult them and offer way 
less than $2000 CDN, it's 19 years old 'member and on a well used engine. 
You'll spend up to a grand on motor, a grand on good paint, so things get 
expensive fast if you want excellence right away. Get the engine compression 
checked, and drive it til it drops if the pressures are better than 90-95 
psi in all cylinders, save the rebuild until really needed. Does it burn oil 
etc? Can you get this thing into Canada legally/cheaply BTW? Rust.... crawl 
under it and check the rockers and the steering box area. Look for it around 
wheel arches and sliding door track, under battery area.....    good luck  tjs.
