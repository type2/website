Subject: Re: '86 steering whines...

&gt;&gt; When I make a turn with my '86 Vanagon camper, it whines.  Any idea what
&gt;&gt; this is or what I need to do to fix it?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;Sounds like maybe a bad pump or restricted filter. Try flushing the 
&gt;system with ATF, clean or replace filter &amp; top up. To flush, remove 


Hey folks, I did the ATF flush, noticed it was quite a bit thicker than what 
I took out.  About a month later both end seals blew out in the rack and it 
pissed in its boots.  Local friendly VW mechanic uses Castrol GT power 
steering fluid, it has a VW compatible rating and is about $2.79/500 ml at 
KMart. My rack was 9 years old, seals were hardened up some BUT there was 
absolutley no weeping of fluid before I put in the ATF.  I think the extra 
viscosity was enough to push old seals over the rim.  The dealer fluid, 
Pentosin CF-11 at $35/litre is also a thin fluid.  I won't use ATF again, 
despite the owners manual and Bentley saying use it. YMMV, tim smith

PS:  the pump pushes about 4 gallons per minute...  better get a bucket!
