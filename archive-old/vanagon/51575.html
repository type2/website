Item Subject: 86 westy-good price?
     Tom,
     
       Here's my input from a West coast perspective--usually higher than 
     East coast, $8K would be a real good price.  $10K would be average 
     retail.
       Ask when the heads were last rebuilt--they usually need them by 115K 
     mi.  It could cost some significant money if they need to be done.

Hello volks,
     
What is a good price for an 86 westy GL(its the full camper not a 
weekender).  Its in good shape ie: body straight-no dents, small surface 
rust on front spoiler and inside front doors, 115K, interior very clean, 
engine runs good. 
     
Also as this would be my first vanagon westy, what things should I be on the 
look out for?  Any particular quirks or problems with this year or model?
     
Thanks :) 
     
Tom Jones
