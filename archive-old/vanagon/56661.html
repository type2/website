hey folks...

remember a while back, when the offroadish rabbit model was
sighted, then everyone came forward with all kinds of info?

well...i have a question i never thought of asking at the time...

are they FWD for RWD? i mean, a FWD offroader? interesting....

and if they look like i think they look..(used to have a toy of one at 
one point...:) their rear end is jacked up, higher than the front....

and the purpose of this would be? (and why put fatt tires in the rear either?

anyhow...a few rambles....

...david
