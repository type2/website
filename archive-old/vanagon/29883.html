&gt;Vanatics,
&gt;Can anyone describe the proper operation of the Dynamic Oil Pressure
&gt;Monitoring System found in 1986 &amp; newer Vanagons?
&gt;
&gt;What conditions make the oil light be off?
&gt;What conditions make the oil light come on steady?
&gt;What conditions make the oil light come on blinking?
&gt;What conditions make the buzzer light come on?
&gt;
&gt;Any help is very much appreciated.

Sure Jim, here's what the Bentley manual seems to cryptically imply:

The operation of the Dynamic Oil Pressure System is described in Bentley
section 90.
The operation of the oil pressure switches is described in Bentley section
17.
I use the term &quot;described&quot; here pretty loosely here, because they do a very
poor job.

The dynamic oil pressure monitoring system gets inputs from two pressure
switches.  One switch is closed with no oil pressure and opens when oil
pressure rises to about 0.3 bar, called the .3 bar switch.  The .3 bar switch
is located between the left (driver's side) two cylinders.
The other switch is open with no oil pressure and closes when oil pressure
rises to about 0.9 bar, thus called the .9 bar switch.  The .9 bar switch is
located below the water pump &amp; crank pulley, near the oil pump.

The monitoring system seems to only &quot;look at&quot; the .3 bar switch below 2000
RPM and ignore the .9 bar switch.  Above 2000 RPM the active switch is the .9
bar switch while the .3 bar switch is ignored.  Below I've described a
properly operating monitoring system.  Note that I say &quot;monitoring system&quot;
because some of the conditions describe an abnormally low oil pressure
condition.

A. Ignition ON, engine NOT running -- or -- engine running at LESS than
2000RPM
    .9 bar switch is ignored
    
    1. Low oil pressure exists (below .3 bar), keeping .3 bar switch closed
    Oil light: Flashes
    Buzzer: Silent

    2. Normal oil pressure exists (above .3 bar), opening .3 bar switch
    Oil light: Off
    Buzzer: Silent


B. Engine running at MORE than 2000RPM
    .3 bar switch is ignored
    
    1. Low oil pressure exists (below .9 bar), keeping .9 bar switch open
    Oil light: Flashes
    Buzzer: Sounds

    2. Normal oil pressure exists (above .9 bar), closing .9 bar switch
    Oil light: Off
    Buzzer: Silent


There does not appear to be a condition in a normally operating monitoring
system when the light should be on steady.

I hope this helps.
