Subject: heat in winter


I dont think you will get enough heat from an air cooled bus/vanagon
from the exhaust based heating system in N-n-n-new York let
alone in C-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-canada in my experience.

You will certainly not get enough to make it useful as an around town
vehicle - you wont get any defrost which is not pleasant in freezing rain!

I would recommend looking into a gas heater in your climes.
