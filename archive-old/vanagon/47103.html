 Dennis,
   You said &quot;I change the neded pieces to use the 2.1 cooling system as it 
 works better.&quot;  Could you expand on the cooling system differences just a 
 little?  Apparently my experience with early water cooled gas and diesel 
 VW motors is not typical of later generation versions.  What things did 
 they do to improve them and how much of those improvements can be 
 retrofitted to the earlier motors?  My first experiences were with what I 
 think were 1.7 liter motors, so that's getting back there.
   Thanks,
   John Wakefield

Basically the pump is redesigned and the system can purge the air from the
heads and block through that loop around the engine compartment.  System is
more tolarant of air and some combustion gases getting into system.  Also,
there is the water to oil oil cooler that lowers th oil temp somewhat.  Works
good at 60 mph and lower.
