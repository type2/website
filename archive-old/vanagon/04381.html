&gt;I found a 9&quot; badge for my bus at a Classic Car show earlier
&gt;in the year. I paid 15 UK pounds for it. I figured that when
&gt;I put it on my bus it might get stolen (those Beasty Boys!)
&gt;so i run an M4 die down the bottom two mounting dowels and
&gt;put two M4 nuts on the dowels when the badge was fitted. You

I did a similar thing on mine, excpet I threaded all four posts and
put it in with rubber backed washers.

The problem with missing bus-parts is real big out here.

As a side note, people here in Sacramento are starting to get more agressive
towards the people who try mess with their stuff.  On the exact same day 
someone stole my taillights, a gut not too far from me had caught two guys
loading a pickup with stuff they were stealing from his back yard.  So he 
catches them hog-tises them and leaves them out in the sun for 4 hours!
Right ON!

This guy, who is hailed as a hero to the populace, now faces somethin' like
5 felony charges.  I'd like to see a jury who'd conmvict him. yeah, right! 

Another guy on Sunday shot a guy who was breaking into his car.  He ended
up dying.  This guy is also gonna be charged, but he is also considered a her.
Once again, its gonna tuff to find a jury...

People are sending these guys money like crazy, too, and a lot of cops are
supporting them &quot;off the record&quot;

I mean, what happens when it goes the other way?  NOTHING!!! Kinda feels like
the deck is stacked against ya, doesn't it?
