Three comments:
If you've gone 100k miles w/o changing the ATF, don't do it.  The 
transmission is likely to start slipping as soon as you do.

You're local Jiffy Lube or whatever your local oil change place is has a 
device that will circulate new transmission fluid through an automatic 
transmission so that you change the most fluid possible.  I might look into 
that.

Taking one quart out and replacing it does not do that much good.  I mean, 
the quart that you take out is mostly new transmission fluid, isn't it.

Regards,

No.  Drain it through the tube connection.

Since I waited toooo long to change mine I did a bit of a &quot;pre-procedure&quot;
before the
&quot;regular&quot; ATF change:

My ATF had not been changed in a long while and I wanted to
change as much of it as possible.  Since a significant ammount of ATF 
remains
in the trans during this procedure, I elected to change much of the ATF
before the procedure.  What I did was use a plastic lube oil pump and 
snaked
plastic tubing down the dipstick tube and pump out 1 quart.  Then add 1
quart.  We'd drive it for another week or three and replace another quart. 
 I
think I replaced about 6 quarts this way.  I recall calculating that I was
able to replace about 95% of the old ATF after the screen &amp; gasket change
with new ATF.  If I recall correctly, a typical change only replaces about
60% of the ATF.  If yours hasn't been serviced regularly, you might want to
to the same.  Remember to do any of this work in the most clean conditions
possible - ATs are very suseptible to even small amounts of dirt or even
lint.
