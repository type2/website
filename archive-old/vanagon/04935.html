Subject: RE: Bus Repairs-Wash. State.

I'm in the Bellevue/Redmond area, and I go to a place called Rose Hill 
Import in Woodinville.  I highly recommend the place.

Gail, the mechanic, has been working on VW's for over 20 years, he's 
magic as far as diagnosing problems, and his rates are very reasonable. 
 I took my '87 scirocco to him for over two years, and he kept it in 
top running condition, I also take my '70 bus to him, and he has saved 
me many $ in helpful advice over the last couple years.

I can't speak highly enough of him.

As far as places not to go, stay away from Beetles Unlimited on Aurora 
in North Seattle.  Many bad vibrations eminate from this place, and 
many bad stories as well.

Good luck......

Jon
