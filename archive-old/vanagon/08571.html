&gt;  When he said Control Freak, he meant we were freaks about Controls.
&gt;I have 4 heater levers, a fuel-enrichment plunger, a aux heater timer,
&gt;and all sorts of other controls. I love them all. We had a month long
&gt;thread on heater levers, and another month on the mystery silver hole
&gt;on Westies that people stick their key into by mistake, and another on
&gt;how to pump the ignition control on the ice-box to get it running...
&gt;  Do you see it know?

&gt;Does this mean that the more knobs, plug in devices, light fixtures
&gt;monitors, gauges, trim we have on our busses the more control oriented we
&gt;are? Personally, I prefer to keep the interior stock while adding only
&gt;those items that will help me know how the engine is performing;does this
&gt;mean that I seek an underlying order to all things cosmic, and am
&gt;inherently conservative; and what about the guy who puts in things like
&gt;fuel consumption monitors, 80 watt speakers, chrome trim etc; or the
&gt;person who redecorates the interior in flannel :) ?

??? well, i for one didn't exactly take it in that vein ... i suppose that
is just another example of the danger of communicating only by written words.
rather like hearing only the harmony/background part of a song: it leaves
a lot to the imagination. :)

it also points up the variations in terminology: i would have understood
a &quot;Gizmo Freak&quot; or &quot;Glitter Freak&quot;, but with current Political Correctness
running rampant, &quot;Control Freak&quot; did sound like it made reference to someone
really hyper about controlling what other folks said/did/etc.
