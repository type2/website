Well I'm sharing this with everyone, cause I'M SO HAPPY.
I've just accepted a job offer with an aerospace engineering
type firm IN WEST VIRGINIA.  Needless to say such places are
not very common.  Anyway the money will be great as I hope
will be the job, seems interesting enough.  I'm sort of needing
advice from the list as to a new service provider BTW, the
other reason besides gloating for this post.  I hope to be able to
keep this university account through the end of the year even
though I will likely start work Dec 4.  After that time I
need suggestions and as there are no local providers where I'm heading.
I guess I want some opinions on the AOL, compuserve, etc debate.
I'm only looking for cheap email, but web browser capability, and
a newsreader would be nice.  Somebody who has looked into this recently
give me an idea.
