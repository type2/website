&gt; As I was riding my bicycle to work this morning (sunshine, at last!)I spotted
&gt; a BRIGHT Red Vanagon Synchro Westy coming the opposite direction. This unit
&gt; appeared to me to be a recent model with the moulded bumpers and all - every
&gt; thing painted this fire engine red. The radiator grill, the lower one, was
&gt; very small however - only about 10 inches high by 20 inches wide. This was
&gt; especially puzzling to me because only a couple weeks ago, I saw a white

that &quot;small&quot; bottom grill is normal ... that's the way all us water-boilers
look. :)

&gt; Syncro Westy with german plates under the California ones that had a radiator
&gt; grill that ran the full width between the turn signals and had fog/driving
&gt; lights built into it. Are these different grills aftermarket items? Were
&gt; more model variations on Synchros because they were built at Steyr Daimler
&gt; Puch? Both treatments looked more attractive to me than the standard Vanagon
&gt; grill &lt;but then there's no accounting for taste&gt;.

the big bottom grill with built-in fog lights are (probably) by Oettinger,
an after-market company in germany. and the one with that grill might well
have had the 6-cylinder Oettinger engine in it! :)  but i'm sure there are
a few other companies making such aftermarket stuff for the vanagon (and now
the eurovan). Project Zwo is one other one that comes to mind.

&gt; I'd love to have a Synchro but the cost of ownership is beyond my means
&gt;&lt;sigh&gt;.

amen, brother. amen. :(
