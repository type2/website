Subject: Bleeding the air out of the rad?

Can anyone tell me how to get the air out of the lines that run from the
front of the rad to the back of my van. The machanic thinks that I should
just open the bleeder screw at the back of the van against the far wall.
The two hoses that sit on that wall have a bleeder screw that u can just
turn conter clockwise to let the air out. He told me to drive it like that
till the air is all out, then just close the thing. I think more air is in
the system then before???? I thought u had to raise the van a half meter or
so wait till the engine got to normal running temp and crack open the screw
on the left hand side of the rad. Please tell me what to do before I blow
my camper up.
