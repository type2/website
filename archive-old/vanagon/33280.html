I asked an aircraft mechanic what to use in air-cooled engines (which is 
what VW was originally designed for); he went into a long dissertation about 
his college courses on oil including the asphaltic properties of east coast 
oil and the paraffin base in California oils (or was it the other way 
around?) causing crankcase crud over time. Basically, the man studies and 
lives oil.

His unparalleled advice: use straight-weights from Texas - your 
Valvoline/Halvoline or what have you. Good clean stuff, and don't throw in 
all the additives that make the oil change viscosity - this does more 
lubrication harm than good (the oil doesn't know what to think when juiced 
up on steroids). Additionally, Castrol has done well in positioning 
themselves for the VW &quot;hot and hyper&quot; motors. This oil, reportedly, is a 
Saudi-Asian-Euro-Whato mutt... and is like Gump's box of chocolates.
