Subject: morning ritual (lately)

Well Volks,

My morning ritual for starting foo ('65 21 window) requires me to slide
underneath the rear passenger-side and jump the terminals of the starter
to make it run like a motor for a few seconds.  Now that we've snow up here
in New England the tarp slides rather easy and getting underneath a breeze..
It's only about a minute of aggravation but it finally got to me this morning.
Symptons of this degradation begain last spring.  I had the starter rebuilt
this summer.  Replaced the ignition wire this fall.  Today, I just finished
adding on the &quot;By-Pass Soleniod&quot; as per St. Muir.  (This seems to have done
the trick!)  $11 for the Solenoid, 1 hr labor (fabrication of wire, 
installation).

Happy weekend..

christian
