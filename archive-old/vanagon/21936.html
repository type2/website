Subject: More blown oil



To All,

When you have a shaft seal installed on an early VW crankcase you must
thereafter use a fan pulley that has the hub turned down and polished to fit
the ID of the shaft seal.  The steel pulley is best all around but a lot of
folks like aluminum jobbies and some full-trick, degreed aluminum pulleys are
available with turned-down hubs.  Unfortunately, when the cast aluminum hub
encounters the shaft seal it begins to wear at a fast rate and has to be
replaced fairly often, along with the seal, to keep the engine from bleeding
oil all over.

Then there's the after-market suppliers who will sell you a degree wheel WITH
a turned-down hub even if you don't have a shaft seal.  If you're not running
a shaft seal the polished, turned-down hub leaves a humungous hole instead of
the narrow gap left by a stock pulley hub.  Such engines may look trick (the
degree wheel is usually polished or anodized or gold-plated or encased in
tattooed human skin) but they gush oil, thanks to the huge hole and the
'trick' pulley that doen't fit.  Wins lotsa prizes, of course.  Trophies up
to here.  But you don't want to live in the same county with one due to the
danger of an oil spill.

-Bob
