&gt;Query: What are three main causes of problems or restarting an
&gt;aircooled Vanagon engine? The engine is equipped with an OXSensor and
&gt;I am wondering if the problem relates to the sensor's age (no idea),
&gt;electrical (ie coil) or the FI system (lack of fuel)? Thanks in Advance -DC

change the fuel filter. do it anyway.

also check all the little electrical connectors in and around the engine
area. you might be just getting some corrosion on the spade lugs.

&gt;I have noticed sometimes if I let the engine idle a few minutes before
&gt;shutting down that chnaces of a resstart are improved.
&gt;The engine start first time when cold BTW.

well, there goes my theory about the thermo-time switch.

i'd replace the oxy sensor just for paranoia's sake. it sort of sounds like
the quick shutdowns might be loading up the sensor with unburned fuel or
something like that.

there is one other little thing ... a little round can on the fuel loop
that runs around to the injectors. it is a pressure regulator that lets fuel
go back to the tank. if it gets weak, it can leak the pressure in that loop
and the fuel pump has to run a while (cranking) to build up the pressure.
but the slow shutdown kinda doesn't sound like this.

change the fuel filter and the oxy sensor. what the heck. they needed
changing anyway. :)
