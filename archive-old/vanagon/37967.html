&gt;(I know it's heresy, but don't anybody start with me. It's my wife who has
&gt;questions about it. Questions such as:
&gt;
&gt;--Why is this thing so loud?

It's just the resonant frequencies of surrounding objects reflecting the
ultra-quiet waves the VW exhaust emits, making the engine appear to give off
sound.

&gt;--Why is this shifting thing so mushy?

The shifting is actually very stiff, it's simply the geometry of the arm of
the driver relative the shifter that flexes the the bone of the driver's arm
imperceptibly that gives the &quot;mushy&quot; feeling.

&gt;--Why aren't you out there working on my Honda?


The Honda doesn't exist.

&gt;--Could you put air conditioning in this?

Air is recirculated and conditioned naturally in the VW.  Cooler air can be
produced by driving through cooler climates.

&gt;--What's wrong with it THIS time?)


An extremely problematic question.  First, moralists will argue right/wrong
over just about anything but as Socrates stated in  one of his little known
treatises &quot;The Nature of the German People's Car&quot;:  &quot;moral debate does not
apply to VWs&quot;.  Also, while some still believe you can never step in the
same river twice, some modern radical psycho-physicists have taken this
early naive outlook to task by proving that time is actually fixed and the
illusion of time as we know it is caused by &quot;mass overactive imagination
syndrome&quot;.
