Subject: 'auto-trans '85

Has anyone got one of these they are giving away for a song?? I found a
structurally/rust good vanagon with a cooked torque converter + ???
He wants $1000 for the rolling chassis, no motor!  I am trying to convince
my wife that his and hers vanagons are indeed a good thing, the automatic
may clinch the deal, a big 'may'!  We'll work out the engine details later.
Any good samaritans out there??  Tim smith
