Dear fellow micro, bay, vanagon, and EV owners,

This note is to (re) introduce myself to the vanagon list.  I am the 
proud owner of a slightly dilapidated 1970 Kombi which runs &amp; rides well 
but ain't the prettiest bus in the world.  I hail from Albuquerque, New 
Mexico, a fair enough place to live and generally kind to old VWs.  

Hmmm, I guess that's it.  Howdy!
