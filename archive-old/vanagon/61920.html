Subject: HELP!  FI problem

Time to get the inspection sticker again, but in the last year the FI
has developed a dead spot just above idle.  Makes it difficult to hold
30 on the flat, but otherwise no problem.  
Problem is that it makes it impossible to hold the precribed 2200 rpm in
neutral as prescribed for the test.

Soooo, how do you get the top of the FI unit off?  Without breaking it,
that is?  One guy says to drill a small hole, then pop it off with air
preasure.  Only I don't have air preasure, feel kind of funny driving up
to the gas station, putting a quarter in the machine...
