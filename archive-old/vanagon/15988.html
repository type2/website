Derek,

I should have thought of him before. I have his number at home and I'll 
call tonight.

Thanks,

Andrew Clark Jenkins III VDAAGG 
(Vanagon Driver and Allround Good Guy), aka Drew

&gt; I think you should call up Martin Schreiber at MSDS. He blows his syncro
&gt; tranny all the time cause he got a 911 motor in there. 
 
&gt; P.S. In the old days, Drew was at the end of the name, as in the famous
&gt; actor John Drew. But ever since Boe Derek appeared in that move &quot;10&quot; people
&gt; got confused and put Derek as a last name. Much to my horror, to compound
&gt; things, now we have weird people with Drew as a first name, such as Drew
&gt; Barrymore and Drew Jenkins.
