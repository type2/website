I went back and retraced all the postings that I have made to this list
since day one - using the gopher  files and my address name as the search
term.
Turns out there were 110 postings to the list (no bragging, just stating
the faqs). Surprise surprise Joel was the number one respondent to most of
my questions (about half).  But this does raise the question about how
Gerald collected his data....since I am nowhere in sight on the list
(perhaps true for others) (GRIN) DC
