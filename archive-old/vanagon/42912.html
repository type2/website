Subject: Misc. Westy Questions


My 1980 Westy has developed a propane leak. The regulator has leaked a
little for as long as I've had it. Now the shutoff valve leaks so the tank
emptied out it a couple of weeks.  From browsing the archives, I've gleaned
that the regulator is no longer available.  The valve looks standard enough.
So what do I need to do to get the gas working again? 

The luggage rack seal were replaced (with a kit from some company in
Malibu). Now, when the wind hits just right while driving on the freeway,
the whole front of the rack starts vibrating really loud. The seal work
great on the pop-top but I'm thinking that something a little stiffer may be
better up front. Any ideas on fixing this?

What is the small hole just to the right of the steering column for.? My
wife who normally drives a Sube, make quite a spark when she stuck her key
into it. Is there anyway to do anything useful with it?

Thanks,
