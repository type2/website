&gt; Air-cooled's are still in production.  Advances, improvements are continually
&gt; being made. My 1965 bus runs better than it did when new.
&gt; 
&gt; Water-cooled's are orphans, not even supported by VW any longer, save in the
&gt; peripheral sense.  Valient efforts by a few to keep them alive thru engine
&gt; transplants generally get short shrift from their peers.
&gt; 
&gt; Over the last couple of years of Vanagon list activity I've gained a strong
&gt; impression that the typical owner of a water-cooled VW van is not only less
&gt; mechanically adept than air-cooled owners, they seen less willing to acquire
&gt; the skills and invest in the tools that would keep their orphaned vehicles
&gt; alive, a failure of spirit -- or Fear of Grease -- that virtually assures
&gt; such machines will end up on the junk heap.

	I'm glad I'm not your typical water-cooled van owner...

	Definitely NOT in favor of a list split... I love my Vanagon... 
Mostly for the Great Heat... I did my own Head repair, own $$$ in tools 
for repair of both air and water-cooled VWs... I own 2 air-cooled 'Dubs 
('64 &amp; '68 beetles) as well as an Audi 4000S...

	if the list split, I would have to subscribe to both as well as 
the KG list, the Quattro List and the VintageVW list....

	that would be almost too many to handle... but I wouldn't want 
to give up hearing from any of you Folks...!!!

	Bus folks are Bus folks....we're a minority already let's not 
divide ourselves.....!!
