Subject: VW EV Conversion Manual

Hello,

        I was excited this afternoon when my wife told me on the phone that my
&quot;VW EV Conversion Manual&quot; had arrived from Jade Mountain.  Cool!  My
birthday present had (finally) arrived.  The fellow at Jade Mountain had
said that it was definitely in stock, but my friend who had recommended
your company warned me that sometimes your shipping is a bit on the slow
side.  No problem.

        I opened the package.  &quot;Uh-oh!  Wrong book.&quot;  Hmm, the invoice is
right.  The title on the book-- well, it's actually *not* a book.  It's a
bunch of plastic spiral-bound photocopies, you know, like a college
&quot;reader&quot; or &quot;course pack&quot; from the local copy center.  The title is
&quot;Kaylor-Kit Electric or 100 MPG Hybrid Car-- Assemble your own Kaylor-Kit
Electric ...Kaylor Electric GT-5 Sports Car Kit.&quot;

        So I open it.  Hmm, those *look* like Beetles in the pictures.  See,
it's hard to tell 'cause they're so lousy:  they're photocopies of
pictures, and you can't quite tell what's what.  O.k., better check this
out later.  Make dinner, hose down the toddler, tuck her off in bed.  Just
got done with a nice long sit-down with my Kinko's Special.

        There's no table of contents.  No index.  Heck, no page numbers!
Turns out that it's a bunch of advertisements, articles from periodicals,
random drawings of parts, various instructions here &amp; there, and flyers for
alternative energy fairs &amp; classes.  Oh, many of the documents are from the
mid-1970s.  Yeah, it does discuss the conversion of a VW to electric.  You
can even convert your Carmen Gia [sic].  Many of the numbers in the
mechanical drawings (some done by hand!) and circuit diagrams are
unreadable due to poor/too much photocopying.  Some pages are randomly
repeated several places in the book.  It's no big deal, really, since there
is no organization to the thing.  You hardly notice.

        All of it centers around this fellow named Roy Kaylor Jr.  There
are at least 3 different addresses (Stanford, Menlo Park, Boulder Creek)
listed for the company... guess it's moved a lot over the past twenty
years.  There are price lists for ordering products from Kaylor
Engineering.  Some from 1981.  Turn the page... hey, here's a newer price
list!  Have I just spent $30 on a catalog (and a lousy one, at that...)?  I
call one of the phone numbers, and a machine picks up w/ Mr. Kaylor
himself.  &quot;If you would like electric vehicle information, please send a
SASE to...&quot;  At least the company still exists.

        It seems I have been sold Mr. Kaylor's scrapbook for $30 ($25 plus
about $5 shipping).  I find it to be nearly useless.

        Perhaps I wouldn't be so upset if I hadn't paid $30 to get the
thing.  I think $5, delivered, might be a fair price.  $30 is 6 weeks worth
of my spending money.  I feed my family of 3 for 3 days for $30.  It's
about 10% of our yearly EIC.  I do not spend my precious dollars
carelessly, and would gladly pay $30 for a decent (or even 1/2 decent)
book.  You have sold me what I honestly feel is stack of papers better
suited to the recycle pile than the bookshelf.

        To add insult to injury, the fellow on the phone said &quot;as a matter
of fact, I'm *sure* we have it in stock.&quot;  It says &quot;backorder&quot; on my sales
draft.

        Blah.

        I wish I were writing you to tell you what a wonderful book I'd
just received from your company.  :(

        Instead I am writing to demand nothing short of a full refund for
the price of the book ($25), the shipping to have it delivered to me
($4.50), and the postage I will be charged (presumably $4.50) to return it
to you in good-as-new condition.

        I look forward to your timely response.  I prefer response via email.

Sincerely,
-Greg Merritt
