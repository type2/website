&gt;While we're at it, what state has the strictest window tinting laws?

well, it's NOT alabama. :) they tried to pass a law here to outlaw the
limo tint, but (since most of our legislators can't read past the 2nd grade
level) the law came out as making UPS trucks illegal. :) so the law was
struck down.

however. Bubba Bear still has many tricks for which he can get you. ;)
