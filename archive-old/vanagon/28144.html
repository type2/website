Hi folks,

So far I've been happy with my purchases from Mofoco.  I bought a 1600
shortblock from them in 92 for $259 that now has close to 60,000 miles on it
with no problems (probably the luck of the draw).  I think the same
shortblock goes for $345 now.  I recently bought a german bug muffler from
them ($49) which I considered to be a good price (at the local shows this
summer (CT) $45 was the cheapest I could find).

I try to be selective about what I buy through the mail--the shortblock was
taking a big chance, but it paid off.  I noticed on some things (like master
cylinders) Mofoco is not cheap, though their brake calipers for a 71 are
cheaper than others.  I probably wouldn't buy rebuilt heads from them and
though I've had good luck with the shortblock, the next one I'm building
myself.  BTW, their catalog lists a new 1600 case for $249.95 (haven't
called to verify price).

As Harmon mentioned, I did find inconsistencies in pricing--even over the
phone.  For example, I called for a monza style GT 4 tip muffler a year and
a half ago (BTW, I wouldn't recommend this muffler--mine had rust holes at
the muffler and pipe to the heat exchanger after only 20,000 miles).  Their
catalog prices these at $75 (shows a picture of a bugpack--I received an
EMPI).  When I called they quoted me a price of $55.  I called back a week
later (wanted to order some extra parts) and I asked for a quote on the same
muffler.  Now the price was $50.  I have a suspicion that depending upon who
you talk to and when you will get a different price.  I just send the check
for the lower amount and I always get the parts.

Another point--I always receive the 1993 edition of their catalog with my
order (even from my recent order a few weeks ago), so I never rely on the
catalog for prices.
