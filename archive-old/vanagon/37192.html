Subject: RE:lady needs help fitting bra ... :)


Hey, that's no lady....that's my wife (Henny Youngman)....


With all of this discussion about bras for vans....would the proper size for 
a Typ2 be a &quot;V&quot; Cup?....and considering that EuroVans are more &quot;well 
endowed&quot; than their flat chested sisters (T1,T2 &amp; T3)...would they wear 
&quot;Super V&quot; Cups?

To me the ideal bra is one that can be quickly released with one hand using 
a quick, deft motion of the tumb and forefinger!  ;-)
