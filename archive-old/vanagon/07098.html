&gt; Help! No response to this one.  I suppose I should be specific because

&gt; 
&gt; Can someone else ( I got one response from sstones (thanks and look 
&gt; forward to hearing more!) give me some clues on this one?  How is this 
&gt; thing supposed to work?  What could be broken?
&gt; 
&gt; sstones says the front hook/rectangle unit doesn't move at all, but it 
&gt; LOOKS like it HAS to move because the hook engages when the door closes?!?
&gt; 
&gt; Help.

Gerry, I have a spare complete mechanism hanging in my garage, I'll look
at it tonight and see whats what.
