Subject: Acquiring Tools (was: MIG Welder Advice Needed)

Also, auctions. In this part of the country there are lots of auctions
this time of year. Last weekend there was one that advertised 3 Miller
welders. I ended up going to a different auction so I don't know what they
went for...but I did notice a $1200 Miller in the shopper paper yesterday.
Hmmmm....wonder if someone is selling a recent acquisition.  8) Joe

BTW, at the auction I went to, a 3 HP air compressor went for $90. I 
bought some high quality o-ring pliers with a couple other tools for 
about $5.

&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; Another consideration on MIG melders is scan the ads.  A few years ago 
&gt; when I was in the markert for a MIG, I was very close to buying a new 
&gt; low-end Lincoln unit when an older Miller Sidekick appeared in the 
&gt; paper.  It's pretty good sized compared to its newer counterparts, but it 
&gt; had seen very little use and was priced very reasonable.  It had all the 
&gt; accessories I needed and the PO even gave me a MIG welding lesson.  Since 
&gt; then I've been through 2 spools of wire and a tank of Co2.  It pays to 
&gt; look around, but act fast on the ads as they go quickly!  8-)
