&gt;Here's a short summary of the status of my formerly topless '71 
&gt;Westfalia (for those who didn't read my post some weeks ago, basically 
&gt;what happened is that my Westfalia was being transported to Arizona 
&gt;from California, and the moving company managed to hit a freeway  
&gt;underpass with my car and rip the fiberglass top off): 
&gt; 
&gt;I went to look at it this weekend, and boy, it sure looks good!  The 
&gt;&quot;new&quot; fiberglass top has been sanded and painted (looks shiny and new), 
&gt;they have repaired and painted the top of the van, the new canvas is 
&gt;nearly completely installed (quality of material doesn't seem as good 
&gt;as the original, tho), and new rubber seals are installed.  From the rain 
&gt;gutter up, the thing looks brand new! (also a new wood headliner!) 
&gt; 
&gt;The guy doing the work initially offered me what amounted to $3300 for 
&gt;it, but I turned him down, cause it's worth more to me as it is than 
&gt;any money I could get for it.  The rest of the interior is in pretty 
&gt;good shape (and they are also going to replace the carpeting on the 
&gt;floor), the engine is fresh (&lt;3000mi on rebuild), and except for the 
&gt;exterior paint, the body is in good shape (it also has brand new 
&gt;Uniroyal LT radials).  It will probably be ready for me to pick up 
&gt;this coming weekend, and believe me, I'm excited about finally getting 
&gt;it back!  And to think, I nearly sold it before I left CA! 
&gt; 
Sound's like they're doing good work on it.  Where are you having it
repaired?
