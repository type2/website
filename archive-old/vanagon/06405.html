&gt; the same output.
&gt; Anyone interested in more information, drop me a line - I am really sold

Hi Jack,
	I just got back from Solar Electric Systems.  I bought a panel!
They had lots of 1x4 foot panels stacked against a wall.  I know you 
already know this, but they were made to be used in groups of four and
each put out 4.4 volts at 5.1 amps.  Some had been modified to put out
13.2 volts at 1.7 amps, and that's what I plan on doing to this one.  I
bought the panel for $69 along with a tube of special silicon to re-seal
the panel after I cut it open.  If I have room on top of the camper (or
even if I don't) I will probably get another one so I can have 3.4 amps.
	Thanks again for telling me about that place!  It's just a couple
of young guys in a garage, but they have tons of equipment and seem to
know their stuff pretty well.

Cheers,
	-David
