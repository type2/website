Re: Levers....  ('82 Dieseasel)

  NuBus not producing  heat from my rear-passenger heat-duct (between
the seats on the floor) so I spent Saturday PM trying to figure out
why...

Things I learned:

1) When top lever is in the DEFROST position, you should get good
   flow out the back-floor vent. When it is in the FOOT position 
   (full left), the air flow for the back is shared with the air-flow
   for the front-seat feet.

     Moral: With kids in the back, just leave the heater on DEFROST.

2) I was still getting no heat out the floor, so I dropped the spare tire
   and crawled under. In the hot-air line I found a plastic butterfly
   flap which was stuck closed. I took it out. Problem solved.
