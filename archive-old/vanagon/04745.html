Subject: Lowering [Was: Speed limits...]


&gt; 
&gt; I live in a similar neighborhood. Call it the neighborhood of fine 
&gt; rides.  Not only are scrillion watt systems cool, the coolest thing is to 
&gt; put small diameter superwide wheels on your shitbox.  The trick is they 
&gt; have to be offset totally out of the wheel wells to clear the brakes.  
&gt; This treatment really adds a touch of class to any nissan sentra !

Sorry to further digress from VWs, but I can't get over the 4X4 pickup
trucks that are lowered to the pavement.  One bag of cement in the bed
of these things and the muffler hits bottom.  Great idea.  Very
useful.
