&gt;Dennis, maybe you could explain to the list exactly what a leakdown test 
&gt;is. I've heard this term several times but don't exactly understand how the 
&gt;test is done, how it's supposed to work, etc. Is this something you can do 
&gt;yourself or does it require special tools?

No time to write this up tonight. New baby and all.  Will post instructions
in next day or so.
