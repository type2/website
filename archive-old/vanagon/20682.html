Subject: Re: Peeling _wallpaper_ in 82 westy

Most of the wallpaper had peeled off in the '81 Westy when I got her
last summer. Instead of trying to reattach it to the wall, I had
latex pain matched to a sample of the vinyl. Then I put a coat of
latex Kilz primer on (2 coats actually) to cover the sticky stuff
left. Then 2 coats of colored latex. It's works well.
