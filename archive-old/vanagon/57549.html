They won't admit it but in 1985 or so the Federal trade Commission  mandated
that VW fix the heads    thru the BBB autoline  you could get the heads done
   if lucky V W paid 100%  or at least pro rated the repair based on mileage
, but they did'nt advertise the program   you had to find out about it on
your own   and then you had to have all your repairs done by a dealer so that
the records would be in VW kaputer 
I used the program twice as my heads go every 35,000 miles   BUT the program
ended in May of this year    so now were all screwed  we should all get
together and file a lawsuit aginst V W  to get free repairs  for there
defective products  ANY LAWYERS OUT THERE !!!!!!!!!     VW feels the vehicles
are all to old now  and they don.t feel responcible     WHAT DO YOU GUYS
THINK !!!!
