So Thom Fitzpatrick says:
&gt; and the rocker project  will be done!
&gt; 
&gt; Drove the bus again, and man is it nice to be driving a &quot;new&quot; bus!  Its
&gt; a lot quieter now with the new tranny!  Once I get the brakes bled and
&gt; the back ones adjusted, I'll drive it to work!
&gt; 

Congratulations Thom!  Your '56 is going to be a real classic when complete.
You'll even be able to make a mailing list get-together!  ;)
