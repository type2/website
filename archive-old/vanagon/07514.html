Subject: Thermostat

Well, I guess putting in a VW thermostat was the right answer.
It doesn't go up to the middle and stay there, but on the highway it 
does, and in town, at least it's always above the first mark.  And the 
vehicle is warm.

Yaaayyy!!!
What a lot of hassle, eh?
Thanks for all your support.
