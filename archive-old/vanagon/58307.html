Subject: Drivers Wanted Stickers
From: Scott Chen &lt;mac.chen_at_ix_dot_netcom_dot_com&gt;

I still have several feelers out for some more of the elusive &quot;drivers 
wanted stickers&quot; that I recently gave away.  Just letting everyone know 
that I'm still looking, and haven't given up yet.  Called VW of US, no 
stickers, but they're sending me a catalog and a &quot;drivers wanted&quot; key 
chain.  The rep said he can send one-to-a-customer to whoever calls 
their 800 number (800) 822-8987.
