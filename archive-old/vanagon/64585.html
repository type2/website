&gt;     Does anyone know if the Syncro had anything extra done to the
ignition
&gt;     to water proof it? I figure if VW took the trouble with the
&gt;     air cleaner, maybe they did the same for the ignition system.
&gt;     Mine has regular wires and cap etc. Anyone own a Syncro
&gt;     from new, that can verify?

my syncro has 41k on it and is pretty much oem in the engine
compartment.  the only thing that i noticed was a plastic cover over
the cap and wires.....it looks like a shower cap.  if you want me to
look and see if it has a vw part no. on it,  let me know
cheers,
