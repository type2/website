Subject: Re: generators vs. camping (long and tiresome)

Well now ....

I don't feel as though I'm being slamed on, dumped on or otherwise &quot;flamed&quot;.

While this may be boring to some (perhaps most, if so please stand up and 
be counted ... state your preference, where's other 100+ members of this 
list ;) ), I think I'm reading very significant information here, in 
this thread. (besides Ric, Joel, Martha &amp; DC are able to step back and 
reload for the next event) :)

My goal is to provide a means to do something with the members of my 
family and to keep the various interests attracted (hopefully in one place).

If the generator provides the electricity to do that, so be it. I've 
bared my soul to the fact that I'm aware of the noise the generator makes 
and have tried to make adjustments to not infringe on my neighbors space, 
time and hearing. I will follow up on some suggestions made during this 
thread. I will continue to try and be even more silent in the woods... I 
rarely use the statement and abhor those who use the following as a 
primary alibi but

  Considering the people who I've seen with generators, I think I try to 
  go far beyond the normal operating characteristics when I use mine

That's not a defense but I hope it is a HINT FOR ANYONE ELSE OUT THERE 
WHO USES A GENERATOR NEAR OTHER PEOPLE!!! :)

While I'm not anywhere near rich, affluent, fiscally comfortable or any of 
that garbage, if someone helps me to idenitfy a source of mobile, portable 
electrical power that is quieter AND THAT I CAN AFFORD TO PURCHASE ... 
I'll give it very serious consideration, will try it and if it works, I'll 
report about it here and STRONGLY encourage others to use it!

Until then, the generator stays in our inventory and list of &quot;things to 
take on a camping outing&quot;.

I'm somewhat surprised, however, about the sensitivity and response of this 
topic but when I made a comment about being sensitive and considerate of  
people who are homeless (aka sleeping in cars, vans, etc.), there was
barely a ripple along the telecommunications lines. I'd venture a guess 
that there's not a place in this country or even on earth that one 
can go without seeing one or some who are less fortunate, regardless of 
your current circumstance.

It may sound like reaching for the impossible dream but if one person 
takes the initiative to do one thing every now and then for one other 
person, who may be at an opposite extreme, then we can get our human 
values back near some center point of reasonableness. Then we can have 
useful dialogue about being quiet &quot;on the block&quot; as well as in the woods.

Part of my effort is working with the young, even the young in own my 
family, to show them that if they 'bend' (as in move from being rigid) a  
little, we (who they sometimes consider the establishment) are willing 
to  'bend' a little. No one wins 100% but we get along in the range we 
both consider reasonable and tolerable. A little generator noise can go 
a long way (meaning more than just the sound of the generator).

I could be very wrong but I'm gambling that we can do something like I'm 
doing to help my kids (spiritual not just biological) to keep their heads 
on straight. If we can help them stay straight around us, maybe they'll 
want to stay straight when we're not watching them; maybe they'll want 
to  encourage their peers to stay straight. They may even live long 
enough to grow up!

Perhaps a long diatribe but I've tried to add my part.

Paraphrasing a comment from a recent political campaign:

     It's NOT the generator .... It's the power source, stupid!
