I may get in trouble for posting this. Since the project IS sponsored
by VAG and may be of interest to at least some of you, I post it here. It
is nice to know that the company from whom you buy their products supports
worthwhile research.

&gt;                             =20
&gt;       Istituto Affari Internazionali (IAI), Rome, and
&gt;  Stiftung Wissenschaft und Politik (SWP), Ebenhausen, near
&gt;                           Munich
&gt;                             =20
&gt;        are conducting a two-year research project on
&gt;          &quot;Preventing Violent Conflict in Europe&quot;.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; The   project,   which  is  supported  by  the   Volkswagen
&gt; Foundation,  is  starting  in  January  1996  and  will  be
&gt; directed by Gianni Bonvicini and Ettore Greco from  IAI  as
&gt; well as Bernard von Plate and Reinhardt Rummel from SWP.  A
&gt; small  number of experts from both research institutes  and
&gt; scholars from various regions of Europe will join to  study
&gt; how  specific conflicts may turn violent and how to prevent
&gt; such  escalation.  To  enable  an  intensive  exchange   of
&gt; knowledge  and, in fact, to generate a common expertise  in
&gt; the  area  of conflict prevention, IAI and SWP are inviting
&gt; four  young  research fellows to come  to  either  Rome  or
&gt; Ebenhausen for a year and participate in the project.
&gt; 
&gt; The  working  language  of  the project  will  be  English.
&gt; Interested scholars from former socialist countries of  the
&gt; Visegrad group, the Baltics, South Eastern Europe  and  the
&gt; CIS  may  apply. Applicants, who should hold  a  university
&gt; degree  (e.g. Masters, Candidate or Doctorate)  and  should
&gt; have  a  social science or history background,  are  kindly
&gt; asked to fill out the attached questionnaire and send it in
&gt; by October 10, 1995.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 1.Description of the project
&gt; 
&gt; The  project  is  designed to serve the following  research
&gt; goals
&gt; 
&gt; - to  provide an interdisciplinary research context for the
&gt;   study  of  the potential for violent conflicts in  Europe
&gt;   and the existing mechanisms to deal with them;
&gt; 
&gt; - to  analyze the evolution of states and regions in  which
&gt;   unsolved  political problems could give rise  to  violent
&gt;   conflicts;
&gt; 
&gt; - to  develop a typology of conflicts and a set of criteria
&gt;   with which to assess their dynamics (case studies);
&gt; 
&gt; - to  evaluate  the available instruments for  the  various
&gt;   aspects    of   conflict   prevention   (early   warning,
&gt;   preventive    diplomacy,   humanitarian   and    economic
&gt;   assistance, sanctions, arms control, preventive  military
&gt;   deployments);
&gt; 
&gt; - to   analyze  the  actors  involved  in  the  process  of
&gt;   conflict  prevention with particular regard to the  roles
&gt;   of     both     governmental     and     non-governmental
&gt;   (international) organizations;
&gt; 
&gt; - to  suggest a set of measures for improvement of conflict
&gt;   prevention policies in Europe as a whole and some of  its
&gt;   most critical regions.
&gt; 
&gt; Further goals of the project are:
&gt; 
&gt; - to   familiarize  the  scholars-in-residence   with   the
&gt;   relevant  theories and experiences in conflict prevention
&gt;   and    the   principles   elaborated   by   Euro-Atlantic
&gt;   institutions in the security field;
&gt; 
&gt; - to  promote  closer cooperation within the  Euro-Atlantic
&gt;   research  communities specialized in the security  field,
&gt;   by  using  the  cooperation between  SWP  and  IAI  as  a
&gt;   training field for the scholars-in-residence.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 2.Scholars-in-Residence
&gt; 
&gt; Each of the four scholars-in-residence will be required:
&gt; 
&gt; - to  spend  one year in residence with the project  group.
&gt;   This can be either from January 1996 to December 1996  or
&gt;   from  January 1997 to December 1997. - This one year  can
&gt;   be  spent either at the Istituto Affari Internazionali in
&gt;   Rome  or  at  the  Stiftung Wissenschaft und  Politik  in
&gt;   Ebenhausen (Germany);
&gt; 
&gt; - to  take  on major responsibility for the development  of
&gt;   the project;
&gt; 
&gt; - to write research reports and prepare publications;
&gt; 
&gt; - to  participate actively in the international conferences
&gt;   and  working group meetings which will be held within the
&gt;   context of the project;
&gt; 
&gt; - to participate in the activities of the host institute.
&gt; 
&gt; The benefits for the scholars-in-residence will include:
&gt; 
&gt; - familiarization  with the instruments  for  analysis  and
&gt;   assessment in the security field;
&gt; 
&gt; - improvement of the skills required to conduct a  research
&gt;   project;
&gt; 
&gt; - working  in a stimulating environment of policy  oriented
&gt;   research institutes in Germany and Italy;
&gt; 
&gt; - contact  with  the  wider network  of  the  Euro-Atlantic
&gt;   study community to which the two institutes belong;
&gt; 
&gt; - Each  scholar-in-residence will receive  a  grant  of  DM
&gt;   2.500   per  month  during  her/his  year  of   stay   in
&gt;   Ebenhausen  or  Rome to cover costs of living,  insurance
&gt;   and  housing.  One  return  ticket  for  the  scholar-in-
&gt;   residence  to Ebenhausen or Rome will be covered  by  the
&gt;   project  funds. There is also limited room  for  research
&gt;   trips.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 3.Recruitment procedure
&gt; 
&gt; A  limited  number  of  applicants will  be  invited  to  a
&gt; recruitment colloquium which will be held in Ebenhausen  on
&gt; 17 and 18 November 1995. They will have to work out a short
&gt; contribution for the colloquium on a subject related to the
&gt; research  project  and  present  it  orally.  The   working
&gt; language of the colloquium will be English.
&gt; 
&gt; The   deadline   for   the  receipt  of   applications   (=3D
&gt; questionnaire)  is  10  October  1995.  Decisions  on   the
&gt; applicants selected for the recruitment colloquium will  be
&gt; made  by  20  October 1995. The discussion paper  (5  pages
&gt; max.)  for  the colloquium will have to be sent  in  by  10
&gt; November  1995. Final decisions on the appointment  of  the
&gt; scholars-in-residence  will be made immediately  after  the
&gt; recruitment colloquium.

&gt;               Istituto Affari Internazionali
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; The Istituto Affari Internazionali (IAI) was founded on  11
&gt; October  1965  on the initiative of Altiero  Spinelli,  its
&gt; first  director, with the support of the Fondazione Adriano
&gt; Olivetti, l'Associazione di cultura e politica &quot;Il Mulino&quot;,
&gt; Centro Studi &quot;Nord e Sud&quot; and the ford Foundation.
&gt; In  1991  the Institute moved to the Palazzo Rondinini,  an
&gt; elegant eighteenth century Baroque building in the heart of
&gt; Rome  where the main activities organised by the  Institute
&gt; take place.
&gt; A  non-profit organization, it is funded by individual  and
&gt; corporate members, public and private organizations,  major
&gt; international foundations, and by a standing grant from the
&gt; Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
&gt; The   main  objective  of  the  Institute  is  to   promote
&gt; understanding  of  the  problems of international  politics
&gt; through studies, research, meetings and publications,  with
&gt; the aim of increasing the opportunities of all countries to
&gt; move   in  the  direction  of  supranational  organization,
&gt; democratic freedom and social justice (IAI Bylaws,  Article
&gt; I).
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; RESEARCH
&gt; 
&gt; An    interdisciplinary   approach   and    policy-oriented
&gt; objectives   characterize  the  Institute's   analysis   of
&gt; international events. The IAI strives to maintain a  global
&gt; perspective, evaluating Italian positions with  respect  to
&gt; those  of  other  international actors. To  this  end,  the
&gt; Institute  has  involved an increasing  number  of  foreign
&gt; researchers in its projects, and has strengthened its  ties
&gt; with  similar  institutes abroad through regular  bilateral
&gt; and multilateral meetings.
&gt; In addition, the IAI belongs to the following international
&gt; networks  of  research centres: the Trans  European  Policy
&gt; Studies  Association (TEPSA), the group of Seven Institutes
&gt; (Clingendael,  The  Netherlands; DGAP, Bonn;  IFRI,  Paris;
&gt; RIIA,  London; SWP, Ebenhausen; WEU Institute for  Security
&gt; Studies, Paris), the European Strategy Group (ESG) and  the
&gt; European Security Analysis Network (ESAN).
&gt; 
&gt; Principal fields of research
&gt; 
&gt; - deepening European integration
&gt; - international economic co-operation
&gt; - the Balkans and East-West relations
&gt; - the Mediterranean and areas to the south of Europe
&gt; - international security
&gt; - Italian foreign policy
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; CONFERENCES
&gt; 
&gt; The  conference activities of the IAI are organized broadly
&gt; as follows:
&gt; 
&gt; - public meetings and conferences
&gt; - bilateral  meetings   with other Italian  institutes  and
&gt;   foreign counterparts
&gt; - study groups and seminars related to research topics
&gt; - meetings of the Fora
&gt; - loctures  by  foreign  and Italian  guest  speakers.  All
&gt;   these  activities  are  organized  with  the  purpose  of
&gt;   furthering  the  understanding  of  topical   issues   in
&gt;   international  relations. The  meetings  of  the  various
&gt;   Fora are detailed below as worthy of particular mention.
&gt; 
&gt; The   Fora  are  groups  which  further  debate   and   the
&gt; dissemination  of information among corporate  members  and
&gt; which  are also open to leading experts on topical  issues,
&gt; civil servants, businessmen etc. They are a response to the
&gt; need  of  their members for a deeper understanding  of  the
&gt; connections between domestic and foreign policy  which  are
&gt; of  particular  relevance  in  the  context  of  the  rapid
&gt; transformations  occuring  on  both  the  Italian  and  the
&gt; international  scene.  They  are  organized  in  four  main
&gt; subject areas:
&gt; Forum  on  the Economy, which explores issues  relating  to
&gt; international economic cooperation and interdependence.
&gt; Forum   on   Eastern   Europe,  which   follows   political
&gt; developments in the Balkans and the Eastern European  areas
&gt; of the Commonwealth of Independent States.
&gt; Forum  on  the Mediterranean, which focuses on developments
&gt; occuring  to  the  south  of Europe,  particularly  in  the
&gt; Mediterranean, the Near East and the Gulf.
&gt; Forum   on   Security,  which  examines  issues   regarding
&gt; international  security and the role  played  by  Italy  in
&gt; these issues.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; LIBRARY
&gt; 
&gt; The  library was set up in 1965, the year the Institute was
&gt; founded,  and provides a high level of service  to  Italian
&gt; experts  and  researchers  in  the  area  of  international
&gt; issues. It contains more than 15 000 items, including bound
&gt; volumes  of  periodicals  and  the  &quot;open&quot;  collection   of
&gt; reference  materials. The library's contents are  currently
&gt; being  catalogued  in  an  on-line  data  base,  which  now
&gt; contains  more  than  6000  entries.  The  library   is   a
&gt; participant  in  the  &quot;European  Information   Network   on
&gt; International Relations and Area Studies&quot;, an international
&gt; project for libraries and data-banks which was launched  by
&gt; the Stiftung Wissenschaft und Politik in Ebenhausen.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; ORIGINS AND ORGANIZATION
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; The Stiftung Wissenschaft und Politik (SWP) is a foundation
&gt; established in 1962 for the purpose of furthering  analytic
&gt; research  into  problems  of  international  politics   and
&gt; security.  Publicly  funded, but politicallly  independent,
&gt; the  SWP today maintains the largest research institute  of
&gt; its kind in the Federal Republic of Germany.
&gt; 
&gt; The  Stiftung  was called into being at  a  time  when  the
&gt; Federal  Republic of Germany was beginning to  broaden  its
&gt; role  on  the  international  scene.  Sensing  a  need  for
&gt; independent academic advice to back the Federal  Republic's
&gt; foreign  policy efforts, a group of distinguished  scholars
&gt; and  public  officials under the chairmanship of  Professor
&gt; Arnold   Bergstraesser  submitted  a   proposal   for   the
&gt; establishment   of  an  interdisciplinary,  policy-oriented
&gt; research  institute. The authors were convinced  that  such
&gt; advice  could  credibly be offered  only  by  an  institute
&gt; outside  the  traditional university system and  not  under
&gt; direct government control =96 albeit with close ties to  both
&gt; the   academic  and  the  political  worlds.  The  Stiftung
&gt; Wissenschaft  und Politik was set up as a non-profitmaking,
&gt; private  foundation  in  order to  provide  an  appropriate
&gt; institutional framework.
&gt; 
&gt; The   Federal  Government,  having  previously  established
&gt; policy  planning staffs in a number of ministries, welcomed
&gt; this private initiative and pledged its support. In January
&gt; 1965,  the  Federal Republic's parliament,  the  Bundestag,
&gt; unanimously approved the government's request for  official
&gt; funding.  Bundestag members shared the conviction that  the
&gt; emerging  issues of national security and arms  control  in
&gt; the  nuclear  age  required the intensive  and  specialized
&gt; analytic  approach already being practised  in  the  United
&gt; States, but not hitherto in Germany.
&gt; 
&gt; The   Forschungsinstitut  f=FCr  internationale  Politik  und
&gt; Sicherheit  (Research Institute for International  Politics
&gt; and   Security)   under  the  auspices  of   the   Stiftung
&gt; Wissenschaft und Politik began its work in a former mansion
&gt; in  Ebenhausen,  south of Munich. The SWP's  founders  were
&gt; convinced that a location away from the federal capital and
&gt; thus  somewhat  removed  from the  immediate  pressures  of
&gt; politics would best enable the institute to conduct general
&gt; and  policy-oriented research. Over the last 25 years,  the
&gt; SWP  has grown significantly in size and importance. Today,
&gt; the   institute  is  housed  in  modern  office   buildings
&gt; clustered  around the old mansion. The latest  addition,  a
&gt; conference  center, opened in 1987 and, equipped  with  all
&gt; necessary technical facilities, enables the SWP to meet the
&gt; growing  demand  for  hosting  national  and  international
&gt; meetings of experts, policymakers and government leaders.
&gt; 
&gt; The  Stiftung's affairs are supervised by a 19-member Board
&gt; of    Trustees,    the    Stiftungsrat.    This    includes
&gt; representatives   from  the  Bundestag,  the   Chancellor's
&gt; Office,  the Foreign Office, and the Ministries of Defense,
&gt; Economics,  Finance,  and Research  and  Technology.  Other
&gt; members  of  the  Stiftungsrat represent the  academic  and
&gt; business  communities as well as the public at  large.  The
&gt; Stiftungsrat   appoints  a  four-member   Executive   Board
&gt; including, as its chairman, the director of the institute.
&gt; 
&gt; The  SWP  receives almost all the operating funds  for  the
&gt; institute through annual non-project appropriations in  the
&gt; Federal  budget.  These  are  supplemented  by  grants  for
&gt; specific projects, obtained from private foundations in the
&gt; Federal Republic and abroad.
&gt; 
&gt; RESEARCH ACTIVITIES
&gt; 
&gt; The  research  activities of the SWP seek  to  combine  the
&gt; requirements  of general research in international  affairs
&gt; with the specific needs and interests of policymakers.  Its
&gt; research planning reflects this dual purpose. The institute
&gt; develops  its  own research agenda, giving  due  regard  to
&gt; specific   questions   raised  by  Bundestag   members   or
&gt; government  departments.  The  two-year  research   program
&gt; submitted by the institute as the result of this process is
&gt; subject  to  formal approval by the Board of Trustees.  The
&gt; institute does not engage in contract research.
&gt; 
&gt; On  the basis of the two-year program, the institue and its
&gt; staff develop a semi-annual detailed working program.  This
&gt; attempts  to combine the specific fields of expertise  with
&gt; topical   issues   relating  to  current  and   foreseeable
&gt; international developments. Most of the research focuses on
&gt; conceptual problems and international affairs.
&gt; 
&gt; Research activities are currently organized in four broadly
&gt; defined areas:
&gt; =96   Western  European and transatlantic relations,  Eastern
&gt;   European  affairs,  and  political  developments  in  the
&gt;   successor states of the Soviet Union;
&gt; =96   international security policies (defense, arms control,
&gt;   and technological advances);
&gt; =96   international economics (West, East, and  Third  World)
&gt;   and issues involving technological change;
&gt; =96   developments  outside Europe and North  America  (Asia,
&gt;   Near and Middle East, Africa, Latin America) relevant  to
&gt;   the other research areas.
&gt; 
&gt; Research  in  these  broad areas is carried  out  in  small
&gt; teams, enabling work to be conducted either individually or
&gt; through project-oriented interdisciplinary cooperation. The
&gt; team  leaders  form a council, which is  consulted  by  the
&gt; institute's  director  on all research  questions.  Special
&gt; subjects outside the institute's normal range of competence
&gt; are  occasionally  assigned to external  researchers  on  a
&gt; contract basis.
&gt; 
&gt; Results   are   usually  disseminated  in   the   form   of
&gt; nonclassified  studies and position papers. Many  of  these
&gt; are intended primarily for the attention and specific needs
&gt; of   policymakers   and,  therefore,  are   not   generally
&gt; available.  Chief  recipients are  the  Bundestag  and  its
&gt; committees,   the   Chancellery,   and   various    Federal
&gt; Ministries. In addition, research results are often  shared
&gt; directly between research staff and policymakers.
&gt; 
&gt; Increasingly   important  is  dialogue  and   exchange   of
&gt; information  with similar institutions at home and  abroad.
&gt; SWP  staff  members  are encouraged to participate  on  the
&gt; national  and  international level in  conferences,  expert
&gt; meetings,  workshops  and  major  research  programs,  thus
&gt; widening their contribution to policy-related research  and
&gt; helping    to    foster   international    discourse    and
&gt; understanding.
&gt; 
&gt; In  most  cases, major research is eventually published  in
&gt; periodicals and books under the name and responsibility  of
&gt; the individual researcher. In 1978, the SWP inaugurated, in
&gt; cooperation  with  the  Nomos  Verlagsgesellschaft,  Baden-
&gt; Baden,   its   own  series  &quot;Internationale   Politik   und
&gt; Sicherheit&quot;;  since 1983, another series  has  been  added,
&gt; &quot;Aktuelle Materialien zur Internationalen Politik&quot;.  For  a
&gt; listing of SWP publications see
&gt; pp. 11.
&gt; 
&gt; The  Stiftung's professional staff, some 45 out of a  total
&gt; permanent  staff  of  120,  is  drawn  from  a  variety  of
&gt; disciplines and professional backgrounds (see the  listing,
&gt; pp.  8).  It is regularly augmented by three general  staff
&gt; officers  of  the  Bundeswehr, the  Federal  Armed  Forces,
&gt; assigned to the SWP for a two-year period studying  defense
&gt; and  arms  control issues. The SWP also hosts a  number  of
&gt; postgraduate  students or younger scholars  doing  work  on
&gt; international   affairs.   In   addition,   the    Stiftung
&gt; occasionally  invites senior scholars or policymakers  from
&gt; the  Federal Republic and abroad to take an active part  in
&gt; the institute's research.
