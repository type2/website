&gt;I have a n 82 vanagon and was wondering which way the flaps should be 
&gt;wired? Should the handle that the spring is attached be pushed toward the 
&gt;front of the van or the back. My therostat is toast and need to wire the 
&gt;flaps until I get a new one. 

The spring will hold the flaps in the wide open position.  The thrmostat and
cable pulls them closed when cold and contracted.
