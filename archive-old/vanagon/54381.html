Subject: Fridge/Pilot light viewfinder question

Greetings!
Would like to thank all those who responded re: Oil switch. We still have
not located the problem, but we have many more things to check now. Thanks
again.


More propane questions:

Pilot light viewfinder in fridge has been melted and patched with epoxy.
How would one know from there after if the fridge lights on gas?
(It has never been known to work on gas. Owner never got it going.)

There is a PIP (pilot) tube laying down on bottom left hand side, inside
the air vent across front of bottom of fridge. It has a small brass plug
that unscrews.

What is the tube's purpose? Can one use this to light the fridge, if the
ignitor doesn't light?  Fridge does work on 12v and 110v. He has basic
manuals, but
nothing mentions this.

Any suggestions?
Thanks in advance.

Louise
