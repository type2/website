Howdy, indeed it is a 21 window. I expect For now I will probably do the
rope around the tree thing, at least to see how that looks. I am not
planning  to have it anywhere near show quality for some time, as I just
don't have the money. So, if it looks decent, I may just leave it at that
until I can have my friend do all the welding and such...
I saw all your in-progress pictures on your web page, and don't want to
go through that for a while!
:)
Thanks
Richard
