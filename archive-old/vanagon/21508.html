&gt;Hello,
&gt;Among the completely unimportant things that come up, the key to my &gt;vanagon
&gt;has WTO stamped on it.  Does anyone know what in the heck this means?

I checked out the key to my '85, and it has POS stamped on it. Took a while to
figure that one out, but I think it means that my van was once owned by
Sergio.
