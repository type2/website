Subject:      Lock rite locking differentials

Well fellow list Volks,
I believe someone warned me about locking differentials, but noooo, I had
to give it a try...I now face the prospect of redoing the tranny once
again. When I first posed the question to the list regarding the Lock Rite
locker, I was warned off and at that time called the transmition shop doing
the rebuild to tell them to return the Lock Rite to Waddel in Los Angeles.
The transmition guy really wanted to try the locker and said he'd redo it
for nothing if I didn't like it...Well...The old Westy feels like it's on
roller bearings in several odd directions at once. When accelerating, it
heads to the left. With just maintaining forward momentum with the gas
peddle, it goes straight. Taking ones foot off the gas sends it to the
right.
Today, I finaly had it to the point of taking it on the freeway. By the
time I got up to 70 mph, I had to shut'er down, I was all over the road. I
must say, at this point, at 70mph, I was just loping along. I dont know
what the top end is going to be yet but I think it will be somewhere around
90mph. We'll see...
