Subject: No Wavering Just Questions.......

I'm looking around for my first bus, I've had other VW's (have a '73 Thing
right now) but never a bus. I'm not the most mechanically minded person but
I'm learning (the Thing has taught me a lot).

I've been looking around most of southern Texas for a decent bus but they are
either rusted beyond resurrection or priced out of my league. I want a later
style bus '68-'79, for various reasons. I recently discovered a '77 Westy
that is in pretty good shape. The interior is great and everything seems to
work.  The motor and the brakes seem to be okay, nothing I can detect on my
own. The only problem is the body, the front of the bus is mashed up a bit.
The rest has a few dings but the main problem is the nose. My question is how
much is it going to cost to get the front straightened out? Should I pass on
this one because of this? The guy only wants $1600 which I think is fair
considering the rest of it. If it didn't have the front damage I would have
it resting in my garage and I wouldn't be typing this cry for help. The worst
part about this whole deal is that it's one of my favorite bus colors, that
really putrid avocado green. Any input would be appreciated. 

Please e-mail me with any suggestions.......

Thanks,
Jeff
