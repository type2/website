Subject: 2nd battery

I wouldn't be posting this but while showing another listmember 
my van he mentioned that people were having trouble locating batteries 
that fit under the drivers seat. Well today I put my &quot; real&quot; baterry 
there and it fit perfectly. It is a Sears Diehard international series. 
The best one they had. Paid $70. Lots of power. Model number available on 
request.

Erik
