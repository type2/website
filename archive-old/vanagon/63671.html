Do you get the vibration form the engine or while you are driving?  May be a 
bad CV joint.  I've seen them cause vibrations that appear engine related.

&gt;My 87 syncro has this strange vibration that comes and goes. My mechanic
&gt;is an excellent and honest one. the best explanation  he's found so far
&gt;is the fan belts seem to jump around alot like 1/2 inch or so when you
&gt;rev the engine up. It seems like a weird harmonic distortion thing??Open
&gt;for suggestions...........btw the drive shaft is out , we thought it was
&gt;the problembut it still has this vibration....
