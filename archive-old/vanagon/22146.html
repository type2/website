Jay,

Ditty-bop over to the Vanagon shop and subscribe to the list.  It contains
about 300 owners of Type IV engines who can give you straight dope.
(listserv_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu)  Follow the usual List Servor conventions for
subscribing.

The 2000cc Type IV was the best air-cooled VW ever produced, aside from a few
of the Porsche 6cyl models.  It is just about maxed out in so far as cooling.
 Increasing the bore or stroke (you can punch them out to about 2800cc) calls
for some heroic measures to avoid melt-down.  A 2.0, when properly assembled
with strict attention to volumetric and dynamic balance, picks up about a 12%
increase in horsepower for NO increase in fuel consumption, which I think
you'll agree is a pretty neat trick.  Such engines generate less waste heat
producing stock amounts of horsepower and out-live their factory-built
cousins by at least 50%.  You'll find some posts archived about 'Free
Horsepower' and the like.
