Subject: Re: PNW gathering

Rick, Ya know I'd be interested but I don't think my SO would. I told here
about the Bug Sur parties/pyrothenics research and she's just a bit leary
about doing stumpin with total strangers.  Plus it's a sad time in this
family, 7 VW's and not a damn one runs.  My bus is about ready though, got
that hard to find rear drum last week :)

&gt;With all this talk about 'tree trimmings' and reunions at Big Sur, I'm
&gt;wondering if there is enough momentum for a PNW gathering of the VW owners
&gt;this year.
&gt;Last year's kind of petered out before it ever got started, but maybe
&gt;there's enough people with working heaters this year?
&gt;
&gt;I know this great spot on the coast - waves, surf, rain, wind - in other
&gt;words a typical PNW winter vacation. And I just happen to be free over Xmas
&gt;break. For me location is more flexible than time - my wife is a teacher
&gt;and has a pretty set schedule (unlike us software types with a bit more
&gt;scheduling leeway!)
&gt;
&gt;Anyway, interested?
