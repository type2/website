&lt;&lt;  I wonder if it is possible carrying the whole thing
 with two people into a car and mounting and remounting it using
 a simple hydraulic jack. What is the weight of such an  engine  ?? &gt;&gt;

Having just weighed one, (cuz I was curious and had just finished the build
and had a scale nearby), I can tell you that the LONG-BLOCK of the air cooled
2.0 is exactly 145 lbs. Once you add the alternator, heat exchangers,
exhaust, cooling fan, shrouds, intake, flywheel, pressure plate, and all of
the little screws that hold it together, I would GUESS at 350 lbs. One man
can lift this easily. : )

Your best bet for lifting/moving this motor, for your spine's sake and for
the sake of all of the junk attached to your motor, is to &quot;field strip&quot; the
above named junk off of the motor prior to moving, and move all of the junk
in boxes.

For your &quot;simple hydraulic jack&quot;, MAKE SURE you have a rolling (trolley) jack
as you need to move the motor around quite a bit to remove it. Before
removal, think about removing all of the rear tin work, exhaust and bumper to
make the hole behind and under the engine a bit bigger. You will be glad you
did.

best of luck!
