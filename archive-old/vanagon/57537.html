Subject: Re: Fuse Block Connectors


&gt;&gt;I'm looking for a source for the round socket/pin type connectors used in
&gt;&gt;Vanagon wiring harness's that connect to the fuse block. My VW dealer says 

&gt;&gt;these pins are only available in preterminated harness's and are not 
available
&gt;&gt;separately.

&gt;You dealer is full or crap. Now that a real news flash. :) Tell him to look
&gt;on the microfilm in the &quot;0&quot; section. It's full of the nifty little
&gt;connectors and crimping tools for making a harness look like it's from the
&gt;factory. HTH

One time I got the same awful answer from a VW dealer. But I found this type
of connectors I searched for at an electronics store. Maybe you will find at

http://connect.amp_dot_com

connectors you're looking for. But you have to fill out a registration form
before accessing the pages.
