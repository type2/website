Subject: Buggy Ball &lt;friday, a VW game url&gt;

In searching for employment ;-) I ran across a company, VRi, which develops
virtual reality games to be marketed in public areas &lt;arcades, etc.&gt;
One of the games that they have created is called &quot;Buggy Ball.&quot; Appears to
be a VR game invloving VW Bajas which attempt to push an oversized ball out
of a huge VR biulding. =)

A blurb from the web site says:
Virtuality is commited to providing the best immersive VR entertainment
experiences on the planet. The Company is the largest supplier of Location
Based Entertainment (LBE) systems in the world with an estimated 78% market
share.

Check out all of their games at:

or go directly to the url below for the VW Baja game...

Now to get a job creating these things =))))
