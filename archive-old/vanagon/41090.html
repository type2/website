Subject: RE:Opinions on later models (vanagon/EV)


Based upon your description of your friend's needs, the only option that I 
see (since you mentioned reliability....) is a EuroVan. Not to ruffle the 
feathers of my Vanagon bretheren, but if your friend is a non-mechanic, and 
wants reliability...then the problems with the heads/head gaskets on later 
Vanagons would rule a Vanagon out....IMHO.

The next question is $$$$.....93 EVs (the only non-camper EVs in the US) are 
running in the mid-teens, and I would suspect that if, as VW is saying, the 
VR6 EVs are here in the Fall, they will probably be in the mid-20s.


Besides, you know me...did you expect any other recommendation????   ;-)
