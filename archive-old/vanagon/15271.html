Subject: Re: passed by a jetta

&gt; I have been driving 50 miles a day commuting with my vanagon for a year.
&gt; That is too much a waste for vanagon miles. Maybe it's time to get a Jetta?

	I had the same sort of thought while dropping kids off at a soccer
	game and seeing a dark emerald/jade green `95 Cabriolet zoom 
	around a corner...
