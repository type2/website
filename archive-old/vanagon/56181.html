Subject: Re: &lt;Syncro&gt; VC #2

Hi, brief update... 3M doesn't show anything promising (got viscosity
faxes), Dow is sending articles on VC/diffs via snail.  One lister indicated
VW holds the fluids patent, another avenue.  Just got a mail from VW-South
Africa about the selectable 2/4WD setup (which doesn't use a VC!). This
option was never sold in the SA built Syncros, so directly to S-D-P is the
next step. And a kind lister has offered his dead VC for a post-mortem!
Onward, tim
