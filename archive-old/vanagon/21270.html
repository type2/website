     Although Olga has never seen a newsgroup nor heard of &quot;net-etiquette,&quot; 
she believes that offering lonely singles the possibility of romance exceeds 
the cost of angering those who feel the net shouldn't be used in this fashion.
     IHA (I humbly ask) that you not flame the postmaster of this site.

peace. . .
