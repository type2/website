&gt; &gt; veggies

&gt; 
&gt; Did you say you wanted us to bring the same sort of thing for the other
&gt; night?  We could bring sourdough for the other night.

I was going to do salad but I guess I'm doing a veggie
dish/platter type thing instead.  I was going to have the
veggies both nights.

Hope that's okay.
