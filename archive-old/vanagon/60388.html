&gt; Hi, I was given an 81 Vanagon L. I drove it all the way from Mass. to
&gt; south central PA. It's a 2.0L gas motor that seems to have a leak
&gt; between one of the cyl. and the head.The local VW specialist said it
&gt; would be very expensive to repair. It's not a camper or anything, but
&gt; just driving it home we've kind of bonded. :) What I'm wondering is if
&gt; you've ever heard of anyone putting a deisel int a van like that? I just
&gt; got rid of a freebie dasher (79) that had the motor mounted one way, and
&gt; now have a rabbit (81) that looks like it has the same motor, but
&gt; mounted the other way.(valve cover front to back vs. side to side)
&gt;    The van is real nice other than the motor problems, but has had the
&gt; entire interior removed and plywood put down from the back of the front
&gt; seat back. I kind of had high hopes of turning it into some type of
&gt; camping vehicle (not sure how equiped). Got any ideas!?
&gt;    Thanks for your time. I've really enjoyed your site.

If you have a diesel engine you need a few things from a diesel
vanagon (check your junk yards):

  Bell housing
  Oil pan, oil pump (or at least the lower part of the oil pump 
					with the pickup tube)
  The motor mounts and beams.
  Transmission (it has different gearing)

I think the easiest swap is to buy the whole engine+driveline
from a crashed Diesel vanagon and swap it as a whole package.

Fixing your gas motor would not be very expensive either if
it's just the head gasket and you do it yourself. 

There are several email-lists with VW bus/vanagon owners:

For VW diesel discussion:

	vwdiesel_at_pas.rochester_dot_edu 

For Aircooled bus/vanagon:

	type2_at_home.ease.lsoft_dot_com

For watercooled vanagon:

	vanagon_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu

The latter may move soon. For subscription information (you need to

Good luck,
