&gt; &gt;Leave it to Rusty to obsrve the obvious but will someone please remind me
&gt; &gt;why EVERY Californian is moving to Arizona and Colorado?

&gt; A lot of the people moving from California are leaving to avoid the high
&gt; cost of living and high congestion.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;I absolutely do not intend to insult any past or present Californians
&gt; &gt;(Except Nixon) but to sympathize with the eternal crud that they are
&gt; &gt;subjected to. Add Smog Certificates to the other disasters. BTW have you
&gt; &gt;ever checked on the tasty surcharge involved in bringing a vehicle into and
&gt; &gt;registering it in CA? 

FL just had their &quot;impact fee&quot; declared unconstitutional and are paying 
back everyone who paid the damn thing with 4 or 5 years.  It was ~$400.  
BUt, they had no inspection cost.

&gt; 
&gt; I moved to California from Massachusetts, and I can assure you that anyone
&gt; complaining about smog certificates is simply whining.  In Massachusetts a
&gt; car is not only inspected for exhaust quality, but is also rejected if the
&gt; headlights aren't aligned, or if you have a hairline crack in your
&gt; windscreen, or if your tires don't show enough thread.  You can even be
&gt; rejected for having body rust-through.
&gt; 
PA used to be the same way, they were required by law to pull the tires, 
check the balance, check this, check that, blah blah blah....
You had to do this yearly, and it was like $20 or something.


&gt; This happens not every other year, but yearly.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Let's please not start a thread on slamming Californians... 

But, you can start a thread on non-slamming Californians, those who just 
go in for hte easy lay-up.  : )
