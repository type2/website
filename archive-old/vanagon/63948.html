Subject: Re: Oil light/buzzer

I had the same problem when I first got my '81.  A helpful soul on the list
told me to lose the Fram filter.  I did, and the problem never recurred.

&gt;Hey guys, I finally have a problem (hope it's not a portent of things to
&gt;come). Today, on my way to four wheeling in the San Bernadino National
&gt;Forest the oil light and buzzer came on when I slowed for the boarder
&gt;patrol checkpoint.

&gt;filter has been on for 3000 miles and would have
&gt;been changed today if we hadn't decided to go on this trip. I have never
&gt;had a problem with Fram, but I know others have. Engine has over 185k and
&gt;was overhauled at 157k. Any advice or comments would be appreciated.
