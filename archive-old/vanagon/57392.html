Subject: Re: Vanagon needs new tires

&gt; see the advantages that justify their prices. It makes me wonder what
&gt; sort of driving some folks are doing??? It's a Vanagon--it's sloooowww,
&gt; under powered, handles like an aircraft carrier, and it likes being that
&gt; way!
Ever consider that the tires may have something to do with this 
handling trait? ;)

The Yokos made a HUGE difference in handling on my Westy. (They 
didn't make it faster though!). I never drive it faster than 55mph 
around here, usually much less, but the tires still help improve 
stability on windy, rough roads.
Just because you are driving slowly, doesn't mean you will never have 
to attempt a sudden evasive action to avoid an accident - this is 
where these tires have proven themselves to me. I feel with the 
original tires, our Westy would not have survived a very close call 
last Spring.

The extra $$ are worth it for that margin of safety to me.
