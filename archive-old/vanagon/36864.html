&gt;Haven't followed the thread, but JCW has &quot;Urethane Shift Coupler Kits for 
&gt;$7.59 for the 68-79 and $13.95 for the 50-67. Page 4 of current (expires 
&gt;March 31) VW catalog. I'm ordering mine today (because I need it) and 
&gt;I'll be happy to report on quality to the list if desired.

The urethane coupler kit I bought for my '71 from JCW was from Bugpack.  It
included the cage and the urethane bushings but not the pin and retainer (I
reused my old one).  I recall seeing the pin/retainer in the RMMW catalog
and I believe the kit they sell includes everything.  My new coupler has
worked well now for over 1 1/2 years.
