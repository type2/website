&gt; Hey waddya mean? My parents used to stuff me in there!  Does your cot have

We used to put two kids up there.  Me and my little brother.  The older 
brother usually got the pop top ('72 also so narrow cot up top).  When we 
couldn't fit two in the front then one poor soul had the floor between 
the rear seats.  Usually though we tried to have the tent set up and have 
all three kids out there.  More sometimes.
