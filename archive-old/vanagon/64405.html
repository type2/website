Subject:      Why, not push start?

Hi there,

        According to my VW owners manual it says to never push start the
van, even if it is a standerd trany.  I always thought this was a useful
option in an emergancy but they claim it will damage the CAT.  Would it be
so bad once in a while if needed?
