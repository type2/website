Oh no, I'm a climbin on a soap box on this one, I feel it to be funny
in a very sick perverse sort of way.  VW in their current infinite lack
of wisdom has to design this monster $1000 fills the whole car passenger
side airbag and TAKES OUT THE DAMN GLOVEBOX to do it when for everybody
else a little in dash thing is enough only to have this happen. 
Hillarious, I'm a kill all the laywers type but I hope these people take
VWoA to the cleaners on this one.
