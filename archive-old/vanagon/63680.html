Subject: My EV's Birthday, Drive-in nite, &amp; Road Trip


Actually I'm 6 days late, but according to the letter from the VW factory my 
EV turned five years old last monday, august 4...i guess its one of the 
oldest US-spec EVs around...the last 6 digits of its VIN number are 
001948...so we're celebrating its birthday with a road trip! We're off to 
WIlliamsburg, VA and DC tomorrow morning.

The drive in nite was a success...11 VW vans...even 3 EVs!

Ric
