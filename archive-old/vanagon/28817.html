Hi Peter,

Where did you get these things aluminum-coated?  I'd like to do
something similar.

Thanks,
Dennis

I was fortunate enough to have heater boxes on a type III that had minor
rust damage that I braised up, then glass beaded the sheetmetal, and finally 

had the units aluminum coated like some manufacturers do to prevent headers
from rusting.  The results were excellent and are still rust free 3 years
later.  The downside $$$, and you need a good solid piece of sheet metal to
begin to work with.  It also made the engine compartment look very nice and
clean until a pushrod tube started leaking.
