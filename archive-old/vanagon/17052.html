Subject: Re: how do I tow a bus?!?

I second the use of the U-Haul tow dolly. The times that I used one it cost
much lees than what was previously posted. To tow the empty dolly 250 miles,
load the vehicle and drive the return trip 250 miles it cost me about $35.00
per day with unlimited miles. I'm sure prices vary from area to area. The
jewels that I have towed didn't have engines in them.
I have seen several folks attempt to build a TypeII tow bar. Make sure that
the yoke is wide enough to just fit (less 2&quot;)inside of the center of the
front beam to prevent the bus from sliding from side to side. Adapting the
typical TypeI tow bar is a waste of time. I second the recommendation to
start from scratch if you're gonna build one. Make sure the gauge of the
metal is strong enough. I have also seen the welds rip out of towbars on the
first right or left turn. I'm unable to provide specifics, sorry.
I recommend locating a real good friend with a low boy trailer and buy
him/her a beer AFTER the tow or rent a tow dolly and keep the neighbors
happy by not storing a big old trailer on your property. Then of course I'm
stuck in the 'burbs.
Someone suggested that I tow a bus backwards with the rear end on the dolly.
I prefered not to do this after visualizing episodes of fishtailing and
other scary thoughts. Towing on a dolly without engine installed, towed bus
facing forward and towing with a Toyota 2WD pickup seemed a breeze.
Does any one have any definitive answer on this one? (Hoover?)

&gt;Rent a uhaul truck plus tow dolly. I rented onw way for two hundred miles and
&gt;it cost $150. Disconnect joints from wheels or make sure it won't come out of
&gt;neutral.
