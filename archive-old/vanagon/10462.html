Well, I rebuilt the front brakes on the Campmobile over the 
weekend -- not terribly traumatic, but not terribly smooth 
either.  Thanks to whoever supplied the tip about the bicycle
pump to get the pistons out -- I used my 12v tire inflator
hooked up to a 1A motorcycle battery charger and it worked fine,
albeit a little slowly (not that I have a problem with things
working slowly ;-&gt;). The pistons did not BANG out, however, they
kinda pffffnt'ed out, so I guess the rebuild was in order. I tore
the garage apart looking for the rebuild kit I bought a couple 
of years ago, and in the process found the little clips for the
door-side curtain!!!! Now I just have to find the curtain --
not that it will match, since the back curtains have begun
to fade already.

When I got everything back together, and filled the upper jug
with brake fluid to start to bleed, it seems the seal going into
the lower reservoir gave way, and poured a half a bottle of 
brake fluid on the driveway. Meanwhile, it was beginning to rain,
so I dragged all the tools and stuff into the garage and had
a couple beers and took a nap.  I eventually stopped up the leak
with tape and hose clamps, enough to get the brakes bled anyway;
it still drips from down there.

Does anyone have any ojections to my buying a length of rubber
gas/vacuum hose to go between the upper and lower BF reservoirs,
to be held on by hose clamps?  I can't find the proper seals
for the flared ends of the OE poly tube, and that's about the
only way I can think of making the darn thing stop leaking.

Also -- does anyone have any suggestions/resources on the latches
on the side door? The back latch doesn't want to let go with out
banging from the outside, and all the books I have say to let
the dealer take care of it.  I've squirted WD-40 in the latches
from the outside, but that's about it.

Thanks again for your help and support.
