&gt;I was stoked to find your Sacto page!  I have a 1971 Sundial camper
conversion bus for
&gt;sale.  I would appreciate it if you could put it on your page.  It has a
1600 dual-port
&gt;motor with recently rebuilt heads from Pozzi's, a brand new carb, new 4 tip
exhaust, and
&gt;lots of other miscellaneous new parts.  It has a raised fiberglass top so
you can stand
&gt;up inside.  There is a propane stove, an electric fridge, electric sink, table,
&gt;two-person bed, the usual.  The interior is in excellent shape, and the
outside is about
&gt;as good as you can expect from an original 25-year old bus.  It's pretty
unique and all
&gt;the guys I know with Westfalias totally dig on it.  I don't really want to
sell it, but i
&gt;need the money.  I'm asking $3,000 or best offer.  I don't have an E-mail
adress right
&gt;now, but you can reach me at (916) 789-1342 or possibly 761 3965.  Oh yeah,
it's baby
&gt;blue with a white top.  Thanks-peace.
