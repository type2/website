Some of the best candy I know is Chocolate Coffee. Chocolate around a little
liquid espresso coffe, mmmm.
To throw a little vw back in. I know that Citroen did their own candies,
sugary drops wrapped in white with the two red arrow-heads on. Now, couldn't
we get VW to go for the Chocolate Coffe as &quot;it's&quot; candy of choice? So that
we could all munch on it, and think that they haven't completely lost their
touch (what with their plastic thingys that nowadays goes for vehicles).

Whaddayathink?
