&gt;
&gt;&gt;Its a Hazet, beautifully finished, click type, 20 - 170 Nm. Must cost a
&gt;&gt;
&gt;To anybody more knowledgeable, are they kind of like the SnapOn of German 
tools?

Maybe even better, they are just about indestructable. I have a few Hazet 
screwdrivers and a ratchet that have withstood some serious abuse and are 
still like new. I wish I could afford to buy all my tools from them. They 
have a lifetime warranty, even if you break the tools in your 40 year old 
tourist toolkit they will replace them.
