Subject: RE:EV Piston Slap

Thanks to all who have responded personally and to the list to my
questions.  I dropped the van of at the dealer this morning and haven't
heard anything definite yet.  Only thing that I did hear was that the
service manager had called VWOA and was waithing for them to get back.   I
take that as something positive. If I was getting the complete brush off
they wouldn't have called VW.  I 'll keep you posted if things turn out
well and if things don't go well I'll definitely want to talk with the
EV'ers who either got new motors or pistons.
