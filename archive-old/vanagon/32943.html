Subject: Help!

Hello -

I am interested in buying a Westfella Vanogon.  I am looking for a later model
with low miles and in good shape.  I also would be very interested in getting
one of the sincros? with all wheel drive.

I like to camp,windsurf and snow board.  The only reservations I have is
having to put on chains and how slow going up hills and clearence for off
road.  I currently own a Ford F-150 4x4 pick-up and was considering getting a
suburban until my brother had me check out his Westfella.

I do not know to much about the vans, but drove one the other day and really
liked all of the features.  I looked in our local paper San Jose, Calif. and
there was only one for sale.

A friend told me write into this list and I might be able to get some advise
and maybe find one for a good deal.  I would definetly be willing to go out of
state to pick-up a nice one.

I appreciate any help.

Thanks,
                                                               - Craig
