Subject: Engine Overheating _at_65mph

Hi guys,
         Since I drive my '71 bus around town exclusively for years I've
never  noticed any problems.. always ran smooth &amp; cool even in summer.  This
weekend I drove out to Las Vegas (5hr drive) at night (60degrees) from Los
Angeles and I noticed that when I brought the speed up to 65mph and held it
there for 30min or so my Gene Berg oil temp light would start to flicker.
To get it to go off, I'd have to slow down to 50mph for 15min or so.  The
funny thing is that the engine felt strong...like it could have gone up to
75mph easy.  This is a stock engine, rebuilt with 20,000 miles on it (align
bored my old case, machined my old heads with a 3angle cut).  My thought is
that because it was align bored (the case) that at high speeds the oil
preasure drops below acceptable levels and that's what causes the
overheating.   

Can't you drive a '71 bus at 65mph on the open flats all day? 

Martin
