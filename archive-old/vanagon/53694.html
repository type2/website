Subject: Synthetic Oil  ( Church of ) aka CoSO

I AM A REGULAR ATTENDEE AND
DEVOUT FOLLOWER OF THE
CHURCH OF SYNTHETIC OIL (CoSO).
IT IS WITHOUT SHAME THAT I
CONFESS TO PAYING $C6.50 FOR A
LITRE OF CASTROL 5W-50
SYNTECH* (BEFORE THE 18% SALES
TAX) AND THEN DUMPING THE
STUFF OUT AT 5,000 KILOMETRES.
OIL COSTS AFTER TAXES ARE $C
34.74 FOR 4.5 LITRES.


I BELIEVE THAT SINCE ATTENDING
THE CoSO:

-THE VAN RUNS MUCH QUIETER; 
( after doing the first change I listened
and swear that the engine noise was
reduced as the &quot;putt - putt - putt - pawh &quot;
rhythm of the exhaust was audible)

-THE MOTOR DOES NOT BURN THE
STUFF; 
(with dead-dinosaur 10W-30 the van was
using about 1/2 litre of oil every 5,000
kilometres - not so with synthetic)

-THE &quot;5W&quot; IS NICE TO HAVE ON
MORNINGS WHEN IT IS BELOW -30
CELSIUS;

-THE  &quot;50W&quot; IS NICE TO HAVE ON
THOSE 2 TO 9 HOUR ROAD TRIPS;

- WITH SYNTHETIC OIL YOU FEAR
NOT THE SIN OF SLOTHFULNESS,
NOR DO YOU FEAR - FEAR ITSELF!! 
Should laziness overcome you, or the
dangers of  frostbite keep you from your
task, take comfort in the synthetic's
ability to go  6-7,000 kilometres. The
path of the righteous oil changer is beset
on all side by ...oh my ..... better stop
before Ron L. interprets right-wing
missionary tendencies.
