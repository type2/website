Subject: Type IV drain plugs


	A quick word on Type IV oil drain plugs- My 914 took about 100-130
degrees turning with my torque wrench for the last 1/2 foot pound of the
VERY LOW value (single digit- somewhere between 7 and 9 foot-lb! check your 
book for correct figure). The clever Germans attached the Type IV drain
plug to something very delicate inside the engine case and I've read
a lot of dire warnings regarding over-torquing. The first time I changed
the oil, I just guessed at the torque (small 3/8 drive ratchet) and it
leaked a little. So I slacked it a little and then used my torque wrench.
It took a surprising amount of swing to reach the desired torque, but no
leaks and the same technique always worked after that.

	BTW, I thought the copper washers VW sells you *were* crushable... 
mine always wind up with an impression of the bolt on one side and a 
ridge matching the bottom of the drain hole on the other side...
