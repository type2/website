Subject: Re: Porche Fuche Alloys

&gt;&gt;Can anyone tell me if you can polish the whole of the fuche rim??
&gt;&gt;I've just bought some (5!!!) and the inserts are painted Pink!! -
&gt;&gt;I'm wondering can I get them shot blasted and then polish the whole
&gt;&gt;rim as I've heard varying stories...
&gt;&gt;Can anyone put me straight??? Cheers

I have the same wheels on my Notchback. It cost me $100.00 each to have them
fully polished. Basically, the metal shop had to grind down the anodized areas,
and buff them out. If the wheels you have are not repro, you will need some xtra
long lug bolts or studs. I made studs for mine by using Kubota diesel tractor
cylinder head bolts,and cutting off the hex end. Got the lug nuts and the center
caps from Barret Enterprises. They look way cool.
