&gt;&gt;Hello vanagon gang,
&gt;&gt;The topic of today's frustration is that of leaks.  My vanagon has
&gt;&gt;two, but I'll ask about the transmission leak first.  Here is the
&gt;&gt;problem: My transmission leaks a bit around the passenger inside cv
&gt;&gt;joint.  What can I do to stop this leak?

     Stuart:
     Sounds like the seal around the drive flange (The thing the CV bolts
     onto) is going. To replace it, you need to unbolt the inner CV and let
     it hang out of the way. Then, in the center of the flange is a rubber
     coated steel cap. Use a sharp punch to get a hole in it, then
     pry/twist it out. Next, remove the retaining ring on the splined
     shaft. You will notice a wavy washer is under the ring.The flage will
     now slide off the shaft. Sometimes a little persuasion is nesc. Now
     carefully pry out the old seal, and using a large socket (or other
     similar round implement) and a hammer, drive the new seal in. Lube the
     seal lip with a little oil/grease, and slide the flange back on the
     shaft. Re-install wave washer and retaining ring. Install new rubber
     coated steel cap. Re-install CV, watch the torque! (I also Loctite
     these guys).Not a bad job. You should be able to do it in a few hours.

     Also, if you don't want to lose any tranny fluid in this operation,
     jack up the side of the Van that you will be working on only! The
     fluid will all run to the other side of the tranny. Oh yeah, don't
     forget to top it off with fluid--It was leaking, remember!
