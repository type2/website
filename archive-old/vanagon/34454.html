&gt; Description: New Old Stock VW Parts:  
&gt; I am currently marketing a huge find of air cooled
&gt; parts located in Venezuela. Included are parts for
&gt; TYPE I,II,IIIand IV and are mostly parts no longer avalible. Many of the 
&gt; quantities are in the thousands. To properly give a perspective on how 
&gt; large this find is consider enough parts to cover a football field! The 
&gt; parts are currently being priced and counted. Lists are avalible on 
&gt; request as well as photos.
&gt; Location: Hesperia CA USA
&gt; 
&gt; If anyone checks out #3, above, I'd be curious. (I'd also be cautious!)
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks! Joe
