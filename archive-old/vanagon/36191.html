Subject: re: cool center console


~Obviously made for a mini van,but don't see why it would not work in a bus.
Console to go between front two seats. Has some storage on the front and
PLACES FOR DRINKS I think.

The back is what is interesting.  Has a 5&quot; color TV with a small VCR.  Also
has hook ups for video games.  Seems to be made of ABS plastic.  Pretty well
put together.  Plugs into cigarette lighter or could probably be hard wired.


Dont ask Bob Hoover's opinion of it!  haha
