&gt;I wanna hook up a fuel guage for mine, anyone know if it will work on
&gt;6V, and how in the heck its wired?
&gt;......................................................................
 This senario was played out in my '57 Single cab last Summer.

After running out of gas a MILLION times and being the VEERY LAST ONE to
leave last Summers' SOTO meet at Deerpark due to leaky gas tank- I changed
the tank with a tank out of a '67. Wiring is a no brainer but the gauge and
sender need to be the right one(s). Sorry, I don't have the part number for
the sender but but will provide it no Monday. Sender length varies between
the years. The sender that was correct for my tank (the '67) was about 1/2&quot;
shorter than the one that the local VW part source sold me. Gauges for all
but '67 are 6v. Due to absence of a gauge hole in the dash of the '57 I
located a single gauge holder at a swap for $1.00 and mounted it under the
light switch and above the package tray. If the truck ever goes back to 100%
vintage, the two screw holes will be easier to close than a butched hole in
the dash face. No more running out of gas on the 101 or in Compton at 3AM
(EEEK!)

Non-Californian Note: It's illegal to run out of gas on the 101 and at least
I don't want to be stranded in Compton, CA at midnight etc. (Bad Boys, Bad
Boys, Whatcha Gonna Do When They Come for You...)
