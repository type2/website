&gt; Anybody else have any good bus-ice-and-snow anecdotes?  None could match

Wa-all shure!  I always love to tell war stories.  (Especially since, in a
'78 loaf, I get all the points).  The very first thing I did after bought
my bus was drive &quot;around the block&quot;. From DC to Chicago, Seattle, LA, Fort
Worth (for the Stock Show and Rodeo), Atlanta, and home.  I left DC on
December 24th. Toured the Black Hills on a day when the high didn't get
above 0 F (golly, I love air cooling).  That night, when I hit Rapid City,
SD the temp was -30 and dropping.  Hit bottom at -38 (really love air
cooling).  Learned how to drive *in * my sleeping bag and all about
driving in cross-winds. Put the coke cans right on the defrost vent to
keep them from freezing.  The next day I viewed Devil's Tower at -20.  Not
bad. Looked cold. 

But that wasn't the good part. The next day I left Wyoming, headed west
into darkest Montana.  As I passed Butte, it started to snow.  By the time
I hit Missoula, it was dark, the snow was coming down fast and furious and
the snow plow I was following pulled off the road.  The next 8 hrs I was
alone in snow. After a while, I decided to pull off, but stopping seemed
unwise without at least seeing a light at the bottom of the ramp and in
northwest Montana, lights are rare indeed.  The van handled extremely well
in snow so deep that from time to time the snow was slowing the bus from
scraping the belly.  By 3AM I was in Couer D'Alene and dead tired.  I
stopped for gas and inquired whether the road got better or worse from
there.  I told him the last couple of hours had been the worst I had ever
experienced.  He replied that the road was closed and had been for hours. I
was a bit relieved and said &quot;Thank goodness, the road from Montana was
hell.&quot;  At which point he told me many things about my sanity, but let me
know that if I had got thru from Montana the rest of the road was a
breeze. 

But (to quote Arlo Guthrie) this isnt' about snow, this is about 360's!  I
am willing to listen, but I believe I am the only person alive to pull off
a 360 in a bus, on dry pavement, and drive away with an undamaged bus. In
Arlington, VA, not 3 blocks from my apartment, I was in the middle of
three lanes about to pass a car in the right lane, when a car in the left
lane, passing me, decided to catch the exit we were all passing (at 60
mph).  On cutting in front of me, he noticed the car beside him and
slammed on his brakes. I followed suit, and cut left (dumb, really dumb). 
After a few hour/seconds, I wound up on the left shoulder, vertical,
stopped, with an intact roof, and facing in the correct direction, with
clean pants.  I would amaze you all with the moves I put on the steering
wheel, brakes, and gas (if I could remember them myself). I attribute my 
survival entirely to luck, pure dumb luck, and don't advise anyone else 
(even pros) try this at home.  But I have stopped taking pleasure in 
telling passengers (in the middle of steep exit ramps) &quot;Don't worry, VW's 
never skid......... they just roll over&quot;.
