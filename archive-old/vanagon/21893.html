Subject: Is there anyone out there?

PING, Is vanagon_at_lenti alive?

I'm on digest and I haven't received my daily fix of
splits/bus/vanagon babble since Sunday. I was really
looking forward to satisfying my addiction when I can
in this morning, but noting's here ...aaaahhhh...

Could someone send a reply directly to me? What's
going on? Is Gerry on vacation or something?
