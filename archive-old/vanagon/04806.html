 Howdy all,
 I already posted this to rec.autos.vw so if you've seen it previously, my apologies for the waste
 of bandwidth.
 
 I'm looking for a combustion motor fan for a BA6.  It's the one with the little bizarro propeller on
 top.  Tiny allen set screw holds it to the motor shaft. I managed to burn mine up before I learned
 these heaters can be set too lean at Colorado altitudes.
 
 Any info/advice on setting the mix on these heaters or on sources for used fans (until I get
 this right) would be appreciated.
 
 As mentioned in the rec.autos posting, I already know about JB Heaters of Castle Rock, CO
 and would rather fabricate the fan from scratch out of an old Beetle engine block than deal with 
him.
 
 Thanks in advance,
 Jack
