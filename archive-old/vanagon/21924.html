Subject: RE: Oil Splatters in Engine Compartment


I have noticed this when the throttle is hammered on for high-rpm usage.
May also have to do with worn rings, and a lot of  crankcase blow-by?
I suspect that oil comes out the breather tube beside the  oil filler cap,
and maybe  goes into the inlet of the air cleaner, where some comes out
the inlet?

My $0.02.
