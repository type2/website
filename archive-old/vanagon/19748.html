     I just picked up a Solido split window Micro-Bus diecast model.
     
     It's a '65 model and is 9.5 inches long, so you can guess the 
     scale is pretty big.
     
     The model is new out this year and they make panel vans as well.
     
     I am currently reworking the Micro into a 21-window, by milling 
     in the extra windows. Then I'm gonna make a camper interior for
     it and spray it up in the same color as my bus.
     
     I don't know if the Solido brand is available in the states but
     I guess it would be.
     
     Lee.
