&gt;| Wasserboxer Owners:
&gt;| 
&gt;| I was removing my muffler (the end pipe was just haning there)
&gt;| and discoverd that my catalytic convert was hollow, zippo,
&gt;| nothing inside at all. No wonder it failed PA emissions last 
&gt;| April.
&gt;| Anyway, I did some shopping and came up with the following 
&gt;| prices.
&gt;| 
&gt;|           Dealer  EuroParts  PartsPlace
&gt;| muffler    $386     $179       $199
&gt;| cat        $166     $275       $149
&gt;| 
&gt;| What a price range! So I'm getting the muffler from EuroParts 
&gt;| and
&gt;| the cat from PartPlace, it pays to shop 

Please note the folowing:
Make sure replacement CAT looks like the original.  Especially on 86 and
later with the O2 sensor in it.  The aftermarlets I've found are awful.  They
fitt lousy and are often restricive due to smaller core size.  What CAT is
delar selling for $166.00.  I'll buy 10 if they are OEM.  Even for early BUS.
AS for Mufflers,  there is the dealer, Stainlees/ lifteime warranty,  Bosal,
good mid price alternative, and there is Junk sucha s by Walker, etc.  The
Bosal, should be available at a good FLAPS.  It is still palin steal, but it
will fit the brackets and flanges perfectly and it is of a very heavy
construction.  The Walker should be available for about $120 or so. It does
not fit well and the inlet area is weak and prone to falure.  I have found
aftermarket pipes for all the vanaagons excetp for two pipes on the synchro.
 Although I hate spending the money,  I will by the pipes for the FUN BUS
from the dealer or some other OEM source. Although they cost more initially,
the repalcements, will probably fail in 2 or 3 years.  I've gone 126K only
changing 1 pipe,  Pay no or pay later, I'll get over the pain.
Dennis.
