RE:	Copy of: Ch**slers &quot;inventions&quot;

&gt;BTW: I also heard a radio ad announcing Chysler's invention of the
&gt;&quot;Auto-Stick&quot; in their '97 models. Un-huh. add it to the list.

Well....letseee here.....
They've &quot;invented&quot; the following so far....

-&quot;Ch**sler - We invented the Minivan&quot;   (a.k.a. the sh*tbox)
- &quot;Ch**sler - We've thought of everything&quot; Introducing our revolutionary concept
of  dual sliding doors on a van  (what a breakthru concept!!!)
-&quot;Autostick transmission&quot;   Duh, there's a first..... (Hmm....weren't they the
ones who also came out with that push button auto trans? looks like that one was
a real winner too)
-a (sorry excuse for a) Pickup truck with 3 doors....(or was that chevr-oilet?)

can anybody else think of any more of their &quot;inventions&quot;??
