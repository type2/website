&gt;But anyway, when I was looking at it I saw the gas filler at the back where
&gt;it supposed to be on a Syncro and another in the front as on a non-Syncro.
&gt; Was this an option?  Or did the owner do some modifications?  This would be
&gt;great for long trips! 

I've never seen or heard of this.  99.9% sure it's a custom modification.

&gt;Wouldn't want to pay for the fill-ups though:-).

No problem.  Just fill each tank up half way!
