&gt; Having an '93 EV MV non-weekender I offer a tiny addition.  The Winnie bit 
&gt;  sounds right so is clipped...

&gt;&gt;There are several different models being discussed here.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;In 1993 (perhaps other years also??) VW offered the Eurovan MV model which
&gt;&gt;was very much like the Vanagon Multivan model sold for the 1990 &amp; 1991 
&gt;&gt;model years.  The pop-top was done by Westfalia and contained seating for
7, but 
&gt;&gt;NO sink, stove, etc.
  
&gt;Uh thats the Weekender if it has the pop top - which would also usually 
&gt;have a &quot;mini cooler pseudo fridge&quot; under one seat.  The regular MV has no 
&gt;pop top or cooler seat.
  
&gt;&gt;So, someone in Germany might be talking accurately about his Eurovan &quot;
&gt;&gt;Westy&quot; while in the USA we have the Eurovan &quot;Winnie&quot;.  Other's might
accurately
&gt;&gt;describe their Eurovan MW as a &quot;Westy&quot;, since it does have a Westfalia
&gt;&gt; pop-top.
  
&gt;Well the weekender again...

So, you're saying that they made an MV and an MV &quot;Weekender&quot;? 
And that the &quot;regular&quot; MW had a fixed roof?
And that the &quot;Weekender&quot; MV has a pop-top?
Did VW use the &quot;Weekender&quot; term, or is that &quot;popular&quot; terminology?
