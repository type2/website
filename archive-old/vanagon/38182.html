&gt; Anyway, the procedure is not very difficult.  I would recommend acquiring
&gt; Bentleys and reviewing before starting in.  Block out about half a day if you
&gt; haven't done one before.  The basic hand tools are needed.  The only special
&gt; tools I can think of are:  and 8mm allen wrench for the CV joint bolts, a
&gt; 32mm? socket for the axle nut, a breaker bar to help get that axle nut off,
&gt; and a torque wrench.  ...

You don't need to remove the axle nut to remove the half-shaft when doing 
CVJs.  Just remove the six allen bolts at either end of the shaft, and 
drop the shaft out.
