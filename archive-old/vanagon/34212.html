Subject: Re: wasserboxer oil buzzer warning = Fram

Dan Houg sez.....

&gt;entirely true but we'll ignore the rest of the facts).  In the 
&gt;wasserboxer, i'm proposing that this higher back pressure jams the 
&gt;engine's oil pressure relief valve to the top of its travel.  The 
&gt;relief valve sticks there for a while, either due to the flow of oil 
&gt;running past it or some 'stickiness' in the bore.  At rpms above 

I'd buy this, fits with recent local garage diagnosis of new Jetta with shot 
mains, except the relief piston never went back in that one!  So this means 
Frams operate in by-pass mode, and your oil never sees the filter except 
when idling (maybe?) =:o
