This weekend I went to Pensacola to pick up the 1960 Double Door 
Standard that I bought.  One of my favorite color combinations, 
Seagull Grey and Mango Green I believe.  Now I have to research 
to find out which interior I need to be looking for.  And if you 
happen to have a full length middle seat with fold-down sections 
on both sides for a double-door...  just tell me who I have to 
kill to get it.

wow - great find

the interior is  two tone brown and white
