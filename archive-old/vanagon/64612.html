Subject:      power steering on '84 (RE: I love junkyards)

when my parents got what is now my 1984 vanagon, they remember looking at
a vanagon GL with power steering.  they said that it was an option on the
GL at the time.

if you want all the specs about when options were added and dropped, look
at the &quot;history of the vanagon from their introduction to 1991&quot;  i don't
know where this WWW page is but somebody must know where it is, and they
can tell you.

hope that i was a help to you.
