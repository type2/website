Subject: RE: Question about gas heaters (fwd)

S Johnson reminds me that his Vanagon uses troublesome liquid coolant.  NOW
how likely is mounting an aux heater from a aircooled Vgon.  My opinion:
I would ignore the water-driven heating system in this case, mount the
aux heater roughly where it goes in an air Vgon (longitudinal, left of
centerline, between floor and bellypan) and cut two holes in floor.  One
under the third seat, to take cold air in, one behind the driver to blast
hot air out.  Tying the gas heater into the water-driven heating ducts
sounds like a nightmare.

What do others think, who've seen these aux heaters?
B.
