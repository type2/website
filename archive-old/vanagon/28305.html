Subject: What is the best way to remove sags in a new paint job?

does anybody have any ideas on this?  i just painted my 60 crew cab and 
made a few mistakes on the interior.  what would be the best way to 
remove the sag and then buff the area out?  i do not want to color sand 
the whole thing as that take too much time.
there is also a few spots that did not &quot;run&quot; very well and look cloudy.  
is there any way to rub them out.   any help would be greatly apreciated.
thanks and God Bless
matt
