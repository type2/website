Hello all!

After spending most of the resurrecting a sick netware server, I'm 
overdue for a &quot;van_at_lenti fix&quot;!! :)

I've driven her to work a few times &amp; still have the lurching &amp; 
surging at idle problems. I haven't checked everything yet, just the 
easy things first, like cleaning all connectors &amp; the PCV tube, 
checking coolant temp sensor near thermostat. I suspect this problem 
will be tough to fix until I can get the idle right. It is currently 
around 1100-1200, although will sometimes start when hot and stay at 
900 or so, until touching the gas, then it will never drop below 1000 
again. Since the adjustment of the thingy below the throttle body 
does not seem obvious, I plan to wait until I can get the Bentley 
book (out of stock :( )

So... on to other things: I was certain the rear brakes were going 
since I could feel/hear some grating &amp; the front pads/rotors looked 
ok. I pulled one drum &amp; found the pads were fine - about 2-3 mm at 
the thinnest spots. Cylinder looked good also. Peeked through the 
hole on other drum &amp; appeared the same. Both front pads appear to be 
pretty new - I can still see clean writing on back of pad, although 
rotors show some signs of corrosion pitting, but no grooves. 
Problem is, some dork used an impact wrench on the front wheels &amp; 
even my Craftsman 1/2&quot; socket with a steel pipe wouldn't crack 
them! I plan to get a 'free brake estimate' somewhere &amp; let them take 
them off, but I suspect the fronts are fine.
Is there anything else which could cause this grating sound during 
braking? (especially when backing down the driveway)

TIA

Shawn.
