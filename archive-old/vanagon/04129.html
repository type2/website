Subject: Re: Vanagon Awning


&gt;Example: the only other awning I saw on a Eurovan had a decal on it
&gt;'APOLLO', while placing queries here I actually did not get a specific
&gt;lead to that brand but I did get other leads, and one that I eventually
&gt;pursued to a purchase. (I note that very recently, I saw someone's message
&gt;indicating that there is a product with 'apollo' as PART of the brand name).
&gt;
That was me.  The Apollo model is made by Norseman.  The decal on the awning
cover has Apollo in big red letters with Norseman in smaller yellow letters
just above it.  It's a great awning, and regardless of Alistair's view's ;-)
on tarps, I'll pick this any time.  It takes one person about two minutes to
set it up, and doesn't need any extra parts.  Also, when it is raining,
nothing gets in the sliding door.
