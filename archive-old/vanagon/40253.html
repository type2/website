Subject: Re: gasoline prices 

Where can we get electricity from?
Well, there's wind energy, solar energy, water power, gas from dumps,
fast growing biomatter (that swallows as much CO2 when it grows as is
released when it burns, the same is true for fossil fuels but...time)
The idea is that people value energy more. It's sold to us for nothing
here. The more you use the better. In Germany or Europe you may sometimes
think about whether you HAVE to drive the car or whether you might want
to walk. And - why are the cars with the best gas mileage developed in
the countries with high gasoline prices? Hmm.
Some years ago, West Germany was the country with the second highest 
energy consumption per capita and year: Every west German citizen used
the equivalent of six tons of coal. The country with the highest consumption
was the US: the equivalent of 12 tons of coal, twice as much.

&gt; &gt;Everybody wins... until the oil runs out. By then we'll have developed
&gt; &gt;workable electric cars, and will be in the position that the oil countries
&gt; &gt;are in now. Except that we'll have gotten there, by sweating our brains
&gt; &gt;out in and R&amp;D effort, not by accidently finding ourselves over dead
&gt; &gt;dinosaurs' graves.
&gt; 
&gt; And where will we get the electricity? Electricty is not a fuel, it is
&gt; an energy transport media! 
&gt; Obbligatory ACVW:Of course everyone knows electricty, and water
