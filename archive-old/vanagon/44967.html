Subject: Re: Bum CV joint summary.


I concur with John regarding CV joint care and life- I started being a
do-it-yourselfer back when my 71 Westy had 40,000 mi. on it and I was a
poor grad student who realized you come out ahead buying all your own tools
and avoiding the dealer--- removed, cleaned my cv's- found one blue ball
even- put it all back with tons of grease and GOOD seals, and same cv
joints are on the car retired with terminal axle rot to the woods at 220K
mi on it!!!!   BTW, that trans is still good (71)- anyone in need? MB in NJ
