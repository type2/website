Subject: news from Schwarze


David Schwarze finally was able to check into his e-mail account from
en route while on GNATT, and so could repond to my plea for him to
phone me to set up meeting logistics for next week.

Anyway! - as an update, he's now traveled 6K miles, last paid
$1.80 for gas in Canada, and is getting I think 17.1 mpg.  By my
calculations, he should be near starving/and or poverty by this time.
Personally, I plan to show up at Lassen with a lot of food and drink
to cheer him on the last leg of the trip, and I urge all of you to
do the same!  :)

David said that in many places not many list memebers were able to
make the trip as they had hoped.  This is sad  :(  But, I know he
is optimistic about meeting up with several of you in Canada,
Washington, and Oregon, before heading on down back to California.

Oh, and if anyone has anything neat to contribute to the pyromaniac
society gathering at Mt. Lassen, I'm sure he'd be happy to bring
it along.....
