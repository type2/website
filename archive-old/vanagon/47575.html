Subject: More 83.5 Vanagon Cooling

I appreciate the suggestions for helping get this van to cool properly.  I 
followed the Bently instructions, lifted the front 15 inches, opend the rear 
resevior and bleeder valve and the front bleeder valve.  As I was bleeding the 
system, the temp stayed right in the middle where it belonged.  After 
bleeding, I shut the engine off.  At this point some fluid came up out of the 
&quot;radiator type&quot; cap on the rear resevoir.  This may have been because I put 
too much in.  I drove it around for a while and the temp guage stayed right in 
the center as I was driving but as soon as I stop for a light, the guage rises 
to 2/3 quickly the drops down again as I drive.  I replaced the fan switch but 
this did not seem to help.  Any suggestions?

Thanks,
Bryan

The rear bleeder valve, part 025121421A, broke on me.  If anyone has a used 
one please let me know.  I'll see how long the dealer will take to get me one.
