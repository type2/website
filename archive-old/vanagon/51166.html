Subject: sink problem identified...but not yet solved :(

&gt; 
&gt; Hey all,
&gt; The latest chapter in &quot;Sean's Sink Saga.&quot;  
&gt; 
&gt; I think I've finally identified the culprit as the LED panel.  On MY
&gt; bus, here's how things work:  the tank must have at least 3 liters of
&gt; water and the LED panel must be switched on before the pump will run.
&gt; Well, I hooked up the fixed pump and when I turn the faucet on, the LED
&gt; panel lights go out and I then have to wait a little while before they
&gt; will come on again.  I repeated this test many times and once the pump
&gt; gave a brief whirr before the panel LEDs went out.  So, I now need to
&gt; wire the pump so that it is independent of the LED panel, i.e. a direct
&gt; connection to the battery.  I will look at the wiring tomorrow and see
&gt; how to do this, but it shouldn't be too complicated.  I thank everyone
&gt; for their patience and help so far, it shouldn't be too long before I
&gt; have this resolved.
&gt; 
&gt; Sean
