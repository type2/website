&gt; My EGR light is on and I don't know how to turn it off.  It is my
&gt; understanding that it automatically comes on every 15000 miles.  There
&gt; must be a reset button of some kind, but where?

Uh, most likely but I wont swear to it, look for a little black
box inline on the speedo cable somewhere, track it from the speedo
down out of the body, if a little box exists, 10 to 1 there will
be a little reset button on it somewhere, this is how all water cooled
O2 sensor lights are and I know there was such a box on my '76 and
it had a button on it I think, but I never recall resetting it, I
think we simply disconnected the wires after we clipped off the EGR
filter, in fact after my resto/body work on it I exchanged the cluster
containing the EGR light for one from a '74 with no light so as I
did not even have to look at it.
