Subject: Brake dust shields

So Rich Smith says:
&gt; 
&gt; The first time I had the brake pads replaced was at 100K (bought it at 95k).
&gt; The dealer did the work and used whatever the dealer uses. Right away the
&gt; pads started leaving black dust on the alloy wheels which had not happened
&gt; before. For the next 37k miles, I have put up with the awful black dust on
&gt; my nice allow wheels. :-(


I don't like the brake dust residue on my lilly white 71 Westy rims 
either.  I remember seeing shields that fit between the rim and the 
rotor/caliper in the JC Whitney catalog but I never looked into them 
because I was concerned that this might affect brake cooling.
They might make them vented somehow to catch the dust but allow some 
ventilation--I never looked into it.  Does anyone know anything about 
these?
