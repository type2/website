Subject:      Re: Syncro Alignment

The garage I worked at (Penske Auto Center) had a Hunter alignment
machine with specs for the VW Vanagon Syncro 1986-1991.

This particular machine has a computer that runs an alignment program in
Windows and has four sensors that are mounted on the wheels and tell the
computer the relevant angles.  Then you look up the specs on the vehicle
and the computer gives you a nice display of all the alignment angles,
and the ones that are in spec show up as green and the ones that are out
of spec show up as red.  They change in real time as the tech adjusts
them and turn green when they are in spec.

The program also provides graphical instructions on how to change the
various suspension angles to bring the van in spec.

So many of the major shops should have one of these Hunter machines,
call around until you find one and make sure to let the tech know it's a
Syncro, as that is one of the choices he will have to select on the
computer.

He starts by picking Volkswagen
Then the model Vanagon
Then I believe it says something like Vanagon 2WD '80-'91 and Vanagon
Syncro '86-'91, make sure he picks Syncro and you're set.

&gt; Good Question? I am doing the same, and an looking for a shop that
&gt; would do the job right, here in PGH. PA. Most people start by telling
&gt; me my Syncro is not a 4x4!    Eric

&gt; &gt; Hello All,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I am getting new tires for my Syncro this week (no need for a tire
&gt; &gt; discussion) and would like to know the proper procedure for getting an
&gt; &gt; alignment.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Thank you,
