&gt; Ron Lussier posted the specs to the Optima a couple of days ago, and the
&gt;  full article is on his website at:
&gt;             http://www.vanagon_dot_com/beethoven/electrical.html
&gt;  
&gt;  I tried to compare the two lists of specs side by side, but was not able
to
&gt;  interpret fully.   It does seem that the Gp 41 is 1&quot; shorter than the
&gt;  Optima, so no cutting *might* be required to fit it in under the driver's
&gt;  seat.  

There's no cutting or grinding required for the Optima.  Just mount it on
it's side so that the&quot;top&quot; posts face forward.

&gt;I found the Optima battery online at a couple of places.  Best price
&gt;  was a plce called desertrat_dot_com in Arizona [800.528.3402], $167.95
including
&gt;  S/H delivered to CA.
&gt;  
&gt;  Their website,        http://desertrat_dot_com/optimbat/optima.htm

In California Optima batteries can be found at Car Custom in Azusa
(818-334-4951) and also at 4 Wheel Parts Wholsalers (Gardena location
310-323-5337) - a chain with several locations.  I think Car Custom might
only carry the standard Optima &quot;starting&quot; batteries (about $130.) while I've
seen the Optima Deep Cycle batteries at 4 Wheel Parts Wholsalers.  (They're
name is &quot;Wholsalers&quot; but they do retail business)
  
&gt;  has a good discussion w/ pictures of the Optima.  The price is actually
&gt;  $129.99.  Shipping might differ to other places, and we are talking about
&gt;  46.1 lbs.

This price is NOT for the Deep Cycle battery.  The Deep Cycle runs more,
about $160-$170 I think.
