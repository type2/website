Subject: EuroVan Joke: Friday

Hi Volks,
  This little joke, if you want to call it that, came to me today VIA
LiMBO Membership Coordinator, Steve Paine.

'Changed the oil yesterday, no small task, did the oil ok, battery died
while it was still up on the ramps, DOORNAIL!  Volkwagen wants $92 for a
_at_#$%^&amp;*&amp;( battery,  DieHard is $59, abd they have THREE in stock. 
Volkswagen has to ORDER the special EuroVan battery.  Typical VW or
What?'
