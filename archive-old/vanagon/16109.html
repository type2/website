&gt;Car Batteries
&gt;
&gt;( by Michael Naum &lt;miken_at_silvaco_dot_com&gt; July 93 )
&gt;
&gt;&gt;If I remember my physics (or was it chemestry) correctly, batteries will
&gt;&gt;hold a charge better and your electrics will work better in the cold.
&gt;
&gt;The battery will continue to store charge but it will be useless at low
&gt;temperatures.  This is why.
&gt;
&gt;A bit of battery physics....
&gt;
&gt;As temperatures are lowered in a battery, ion mobility (the carriers of
&gt;charge)
&gt;and electron reaction rates are reduced.  Thus most liquid batteries cannot
&gt;produce the same amount of energy at lower temperatures.  If the electrolyte
&gt;freezes then ionic mobility will be lowered to the point that the battery
&gt;is basically useless.  This will probably not happen too often because
&gt;batteries have awfull thermal conductivity so they never reach the ambient
&gt;temperature unless of course you live in Alaska and leave it parked
&gt;on a glacier the entire winter!!   The other interesting thing about 
&gt;batteries is that at lower temperatures there is increased internal 
&gt;resistance.  If you leave something small plugged in (like a radar detector)
&gt;it will draw current.  This current will flow through this internal resistor
&gt;creating heat.  This in turn will keep the battery warm.  But it will drain
&gt;some juice out of your battery. 
&gt;
&gt;Heating a battery produces the opposite effect.  The battery will yield 
&gt;more.  The only problem is the electrons tend to go crazy and cause the
&gt;battery to self destruct.  I had the unpleasant experience of having a
&gt;battery that was boiling BLOW UP in my house garage.  Luckily the hood 
&gt;was up and I was behind my CJ.  There was acid everywhere and my ears
&gt;were ringing for about an hour.  A boiling battery can produce a substantial
&gt;amount of Hydrogen gas.  Thus creating a small non-nuclear H-BOMB capable
&gt;of burning you, your vehicle, and anything in its path.  Avoid a boiling
&gt;battery at all costs...........

&gt;Battery Storage Capacity
&gt;
&gt;( by Daniel I. Applebaum &lt;danapple_at_vicor_dot_com&gt;
&gt;     31Oct94 )
&gt;
&gt;Information from &quot;The Complete Battery Book&quot; by Richard A. Perez.
&gt;Copyright 1985.  ISBN 0-8306-0757-9
&gt;
&gt;Four types of Lead-Acid batteries concern us for vehicular purposes,
&gt;automotive starting, low antimony deep-cycle, high antimony
&gt;deep-cycle, and gel-cells.  I'll go over characteristics of each.
&gt;
&gt;But first, a general note:
&gt;A) The storage capacity (ampere-hour rating) of a battery is a function
&gt;of the surface area of the plates exposed to the chemicals.
&gt;
&gt;1) Automotive Starting Batteries
&gt;It has one job only: to start your car.  An average car uses more than
&gt;300 amps for a few seconds in order to start.  The batteries are
&gt;constructed with a large number of thin plates of lead sponge.  This
&gt;provides maximum surface area.  The batteries handle only very shallow
&gt;cycling, on the order of 1% in normal use.  The starting battery will
&gt;fail after approx. 100 cycles of 50%.  Complete failure at 200 cycles.
&gt;The sponge disintegrates with the repeated full charge and discharge
&gt;chemical reactions.  Lead particles separate from the plates and form
&gt;micro-short circuits inside the battery.  This highly increases the
&gt;self-discharge rate.  Maintenence-free batteries have added calcium to
&gt;the lead sponges to harden them and reduce water loss.  The calcium
&gt;also increases the internal resistance, hence slowing self-discharge.
&gt;The expected lifetime of a starting battery in true starting use is
&gt;3-5 years.  In deep-cycle service, expect less than 2 years.
&gt;
&gt;2) Low Antimony Deep Cycle Batteries
&gt;These are run-of-the-mill &quot;marine/RV deep-cycle&quot; batteries.  It's a
&gt;compromise between a starting battery and a true deep-cycle battery.
&gt;They are much closer to starting batteries, however.  The plates are
&gt;somewhat thicker than starting batteries and have some added antimony.
&gt;It is not designed for powering large loads for a long time.
&gt;Deep-cycling will damage it, over time.  In RV use, with usually no
&gt;more than 20% discharge, the battery should last 200-400 cycles.  If
&gt;cycled 80%, expect a lifetime of less than 200 cycles, or about the
&gt;same as the starting battery.  The thicker plates and antimony add a
&gt;bit of mechanical strength over the standard starting battery.  In
&gt;float service, the battery will last 5-10 years, much greater than
&gt;starting batteries used in float service.
&gt;
&gt;3) High Antimony Deep Cycle Batteries 
&gt;This type is designed to be 80% cycled repeatedly for 5-15 years.
&gt;There is almost no mechanical similarity between this battery and a
&gt;starting battery.  They are massive and huge.  There are very few true
&gt;deep cycle batteries with greater than 6 volts, as they would be too
&gt;heavy to move by hand.  The grids are over 4 times thicker than a
&gt;starting battery's grids.  And there is several times the amount of
&gt;antimony in the grids.  The plates are thick to add lifetime, not
&gt;capacity.  (See A).  The plates are not constructed of sponge, but of
&gt;scored sheets of lead with up to 16% antimony.  The thickness of the
&gt;plates combined with the high antimony content lowers the energy
&gt;density, so this battery is heavier, larger and much more costly per
&gt;kilowatt-hour.  The case is also much thicker, and the plates usually
&gt;leave a 1-3 inch space at the bottom to allow for accumulation of lead
&gt;particles, so that they don't cause micro-shorts.  The top of the case
&gt;also has more space to allow for expansion of the electrolyte.  Plates
&gt;can be removed and serviced.  As the cell interconnect straps are
&gt;exposed, each cell's voltage can be measured individually.  This
&gt;allows the user to determine when an equalizing charge is necessary.
&gt;Some batteries have &quot;wrapped&quot; plates, where perforated plastic is
&gt;wrapped around the plates to keep the lead on them longer.  Such a
&gt;configuration add 25-35% to the lifetime of the battery.  Such
&gt;batteries are mostly used for electric vehicles, which force a fast
&gt;80% or more discharge.  They are then recharge much more slowly.  A
&gt;350 amp-hr 12 volt battery weighs 250 pounds and contains 4.5 gallons
&gt;of sulphuric acid.  They can be cycled 80% between 1000 and 2000
&gt;times.  Lifetime should be 5-15 years.
&gt;
&gt;4) Gel Cells
&gt;This type is designed for portability.  They are small and have a
&gt;jellied electrolyte.  The case is sealed.  The jellied electrolyte
&gt;allows the use of this battery in any orientation.  They are used
&gt;often in aircraft and electronics.  They are supposed to be clean and
&gt;usuable where acid vapors and spills are unacceptable.  They can be
&gt;deep-cycled over long periods.  They must not be charged or discharged
&gt;too rapidly, otherwise it can gas, possibly blowing the sealed case.
&gt;They are prone to sulfation if left discharged for a long time.  With
&gt;proper care, a gel-cell will deliver 1000 cycles over a period of 5
&gt;years or more.
