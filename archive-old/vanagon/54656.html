Subject: 21-window Deluxe Wannabussers Listen Up


I found a 60-something 21-window deluxe for sale.  I think its a '65-'66.
It was raining and hailing like hell, so VINs and the like were not my top
priority.

Its a project:  A more serious project than my '54.  Maybe ten years from
now someone would be all over this thing to restore it, but prolly not right
now...

Bad:

This is a &quot;no&quot; bus:
* No engine
* No transmission
* No seats
* No sunroof Mech (&quot;But the hole's still there&quot; sez the owner's dad.  Remind
me never to by a donut from this guy)
* no rear bumper or apron
* Nose has a decent dent, but its easily fixable.
* cargo floor is toast.
* someone cut out the front seat &quot;wall&quot; - why? 
* doglegs are even thrashed
* misc dents, dings, scrapes

Good: 

* All glass is there: drivers window cracked
* doors are decent
* Has all latches, guages, steering wheel, etc
* has all the aluminum trim.

He wants $300.  Too much if you ask me.  I'm thinking about offering $100,
taking it home (1 1/2 blocks away) and stripping it, and sending the rest
DTR.  Its that bad.   I hate to waste a bus, much less a deluxe, but this
thing is _hammered_

If anyone is interested in this beast, preferably for restoration, lemme
know.  Otherwise I'll prolly boneyard it.
