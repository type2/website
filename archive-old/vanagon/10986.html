   LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- Things look dim for Michigan car lovers 
who've accesorized to make it look like they're floating down the road 
on a bed of neon light. 
   An opinion by State Attorney General Frank Kelley released Tuesday 
found that neon ground effect lights, the latest fad in customizing 
vehicles, are illegal in Michigan. 
   Motorists with them not only must keep them unlit, they must be 
covered. 
   &quot;I don't see what it harms,&quot; said Doug Rice, owner of Kustom Auto 
World. &quot;... it shines down on the ground. How could it hurt anything?&quot; 
   The lights come in a variety of colors, selling for $289 installed, 
said John McNett, owner of Crossroads Auto Center. 
   Kelley cited state code terms allowing only required lights or 
those specifically permitted by state or federal law. His opinions 
have the force of law unless overturned in court. 
   Violators could be ticketed for defective equipment, which allows 
citations to be dropped if the defects are corrected before the court 
date, or ticketed for equipment-violation, which carries a $100 fine 
plus court costs.
