Mothballs (or equivalent Green product) in strategic places that won't effect
you or your family's breathing might be the way to go. I use these in the
heater channels in the KG plus a Vapona no-pest strip when I put it in
storage for the winter. Mice seed/poison will only remove those meeses
that have set up shop but will  not be a very effective deterrent against
further rodent incursions. DC
