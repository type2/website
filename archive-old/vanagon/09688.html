&gt; derekdrew_at_aol_dot_com asked about replacement front floor mats for the Vanagon

I purchased a set from BusBoys and have been very pleased.  They are black
rubber (no carpet) with a beige stripe running across them with the word
&quot;Vanagon&quot; in white letters on the stripe.  I believe I paid around $50 but
that included shipping from the west coast to the east coast.

J.C. Whitney sells some as well but I know nothing about them.
