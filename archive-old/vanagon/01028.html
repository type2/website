&gt; Greetings again,
&gt; 
&gt; Has anyone out there replaced the barrel and tumblers on their
&gt; ignition switch?  I need to do this for Georg, my 1973 campmobile
&gt; and the VW place wants $80 labor.  I'm already paying $42 for the
&gt; barrel-tumblers-keys package and would like to save a little by
&gt; doing the installation myself if possible.  Also, the locksmith
&gt; I talked to says a lot of the VW ignition switch barrels are
&gt; riveted closed and that rekeying them is not an option as it is
&gt; with the door locks.  This means that once I replace the ignition
&gt; barrel, I will have two keys for the vehicle, ignition and doors.
&gt; Anyone have a way around this one besides haveing all the doors
&gt; rekeyed?
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; 
&gt;  -Dyer

Why not just have *two* keys for your camper?  Every once in a while you 
can open your wallet, see the money you saved by not re-keying all of 
your doors, and smile.
