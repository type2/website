Subject: Space Shuttle, cleaning heat risers?


In fact, just this noon, while walking over to the student union
for lunch, a 747 with a space shuttle piggy-backed flew over the
University of Arizona.  I hadn't expected it since I wasn't aware
of the shuttle schedule so it was a pleasent surprise to see it.

Lesse, VW content, VW content, .... Oh ya, yesterday I was
cleaning the carbon out of the heat risers on the intake
manifold I'm going to use on the engine I'm building for the
'66.  I used bent up hanger wire mostly and a power drill.
I got it fairly clean, and can blow air through quite freely,
but I'd like to get as much carbon as possible out of there.
Someone, in the vanagon_at_lenti archives, recommended putting
automatic transmission fluid in there and then heating it with
a propane torch.  Sounds strange.  Anyone tried this?  Anyone
have any other ideas about cleaning heat risers?
