I most strongly recommend going to Kmart and putting down $12 for a 12 volt
air compressor.  Do it ... later, when your tire goes flat in the snow
like mine did you will thank me.  Or ask yourself this:  do you really want
to change the tire in the snow ... right beside the interstate ... where
you catch all kinds of wind?

Also, I'd recommend a blanket to but between the 2 front seats ... it'll
keep you warm.  Oh, that orange junk from Wall Mart will also be pretty
useful to clean your hands after you change your head gasket in say
Missouri.

Mostly, though, if you are going North, I would say get yourself an old
quilt from the Salvation Army and insulate your back windows. Take an old
sleeping bag to hang over the foot of your bed and it you don't like my
propane fridge heater suggestion, get a big candle from Kmart (for about
$2.50.)  Oh, be sure to get yourself a good sleeping bag also.  That way,
you will survive the cold.
