&gt; 
&gt; 	The problem is that the CT case has cast-in bosses for the 
&gt; Type 4-style fan housing. These would prohibit mounting the standard 
&gt; Beetle engine sheet metal. Probably not insurmountable, but not worth 
&gt; it to me.
&gt; 
  Did you ever find out what the case was made out of? If it's aluminum, it
  might still be worth pursuing - even if you had to cut the bosses off. 
  Just think, a type 1 case that didn't get pounded out.
