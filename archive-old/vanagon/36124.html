&gt; On my junkyard trip yesterday I saw 2 12V/110V refrigerators for post 72
&gt; westphalias. They asked $100.00 firm for them. What is the new price and how
&gt; much is a reasonable junkyard price.

I paid around $30 for one of those a while ago.  They use the heat
absorbtion (?) method of cooling - I like the compressor type better
even though they make more noise.  I certainly wouldn't pay $100 for
one, but I guess it depends on how bad you want it.  You can't buy those
new of course.
