Subject: Re: Roof rack?  BRIGHT colors?

About roof racks for the vanagon-
  in my experience hauling kids canoes bikes and kayaks...
the famous &quot;quick and easy&quot; brackets are still the best strongest
and cheapest . they are under 30$ and you use fir 2x4's
or hardwood 2x2's for the crossbars-its really easy!
  tips:
 spray paint them bright colors,
  if your canoe has wood gunnnels cover the rear one with indoor outdoor
    carpet.
  for bikes, the thule bike racks can be bolted to them easily, for
    bikes and canoes it's helpful to have a 3rd crossbar. i have always found
the bikerack [from rhode gear i recall] that sits on the rear hatch door
to be the bast solution,it's also cheap.
    loading- if you have a canoe put your rear rack as far back as possible ,
just rest the bow on it and push it forward onto the rack.
    remember to tie down those bow and stern lines!

 that's my experience for what it's worth!
