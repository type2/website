	Here goes nothing...  fun with nails.. find a small metal tin, pint size,
	with a screwtop lid. Punch a nice fine finishing nail through the lid, from
	the inside, just enough to make a good nozzle. Fill tin partly with your
	favorite flammable fluid, gasoline being just fine. Then simply place in the
	middle of a hot campfire and wait for the rocket blast of flames skyward.

	The top or a seam will let go if you get enough pressure built up, and you
	will! If the tin tips over you lose bigtime BTW!

	Almost as much fun as pitching in a handful of .22 shells.
