So..NuBus ('82 bunker burner with newer engine) is in the shop
yesterday and today. Somehow, someway, something got inside the 
Timing Belt and chewed away three teeth...

Guess what happens to Mr. Valves when he opens at the wrong time...
Guess what Mr. Cylinder does to Mr. Valve...

I ain't even finished paying for this engine yet...Three cylinders have
good compression, one doesn't.  Probably Mr. Valve is upset in that one.

I hope it runs ok on 3.5 Cylinders.

Matthew :-(

p.s. In 10 Months:

1- -Timing belt slips on '85 Renault Alliance - Valve Job
     (Piece of Sh*t in perfect condition with 48K miles)

2- New seals on NuBus Diesel engine #1

3- Diesel Engine #1 blows up good.

4- Timing belt fails on Diesel Engine #2 - Valve Job?
