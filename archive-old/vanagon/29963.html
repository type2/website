&gt; two years ago I paid $7500 (and I think I paid to much) for an 86
&gt; syncro no PL or PW, but in really clean shape with only 58 kmi

I just paid $8300 for my '89 Syncro with 90K miles, power everything, new 
head gaskets and rebuilt tranny, dealer-maintained with *no* rust (in N. 
Calif, where these are all at a premium, too).  So for a Colorado car, I'd 
say &quot;Bargain hard!&quot;
