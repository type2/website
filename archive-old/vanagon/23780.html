&gt; &gt; No.

&gt; Can you elaborate on this a little? :-)
&gt; I am genuinely interested since I'm fed up of guessing my fuel status.

That I can.  Resistance is the same regardless of voltage.  If you 
increase the voltage, the resistance will remain the same and the current 
(draw in amps) will change, not the other way around.  So if your gauge 
isn't reading right it's the gauge, the sender or the wire in between.  
Most fuel gauges are estimates anyway.
