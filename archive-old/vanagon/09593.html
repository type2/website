Subject: Vanagon fuel tank r&amp;r

One more note for those reinstalling the fuel tank: make sure the rubber
grommets on the the breather hoses on top are seated real well.  One of mine
popped off under the pressure of being topped up the first time, giving the 
tank and belly pan a smelly dangerous bath.

My solution to the rust pin-hole in my tank was a patch welded on at a radiator
shop for $50.  I turned down the opportunity to pull a used tank at a wrecking
yard for $175, figuring chances were decent I'd find rust on that one too after
I got it out.  I like seasons, but when I visit CA or FL I sure envy the rust-
free lives your cars live.
