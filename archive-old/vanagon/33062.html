Subject: Heaters and aliens


&gt;A friend in the Army gave me a little packed (OD Green) that you add 
&gt;water to to produce heat (for warming hands, etc.) The harder you press, 
&gt;the more heat you get. Reusable. Don't know anything more about it. It's 
&gt;probably nuclear or something they took off an alien found in Utah. Clay? 
&gt;Are you there? 8) Joe

I can neither confirm nor deny the existence of aliens in Utah.

Come here see if you can tell.

Clay
