Subject: US spec Splitty bumpers

I'm confused now! Front bumper, two overiders, three tube/towel rail sections?
Or is that tube all one continuous piece? I thought it was in three little
sections; the bit I want is the long slightly curved section that goes between
the overiders sitting under the V shape on the body....or have I got all this
wrong? Or maybe I'm confusing everybody....
That's the bit...does it exist on it's own or is it part of the whole thing,
sides and all....       Dave
