Actually, I could use general advice: after dirt-roading it for a few

compartment looks like someone spilled a box of talc.

I like to take my bus to the car wash every so often.  No, not to wash the
outside,  that might damage my bug collection.  The engine is happier when
clean.  I stick a plastic bag over the distributor cap and secure it with a
rubber band,  and avoid the cardboard hoses.    It' so much nicer to tune up
a clean engine.  Or to pull it out especially if changing a bad oil seal.
