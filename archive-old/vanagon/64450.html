Paul, you wrote:

&lt;&lt;... I'll be traveling with my girlfriend and dog in my 82 diesel westy.
I was wondering if anyone had any advice as far as things to see,
do, stay, etc... along the way.  We'll be leaving Cape Cod, traveling
south  toTennessee to visit her parents and then from there its still up
in the air...&gt;&gt;

   My suggestion for part of your route to TN would be to pick up
Skyline Drive in VA, continuing on the Blue Ridge Parkway into the
Smokies, if that's convenient.  It's a great drive!
