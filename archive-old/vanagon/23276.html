Subject: '56 Brakes - Yes, again
Date: Tue, 22 Aug 1995 21:49:25 -0700 (PDT)

Hi,

	Well, I played with the brakes again tonight.

	To recap, I had a problem with them dragging in the back.  Fixed
that with new springs.  Then the fronts were dragging, and pressure was
building up in the system the more I used the brakes, and then it would
dissipate somewhat overnight.

	So, today I put on another new master cylinder and reservoir.  I
also backed the rod another 1/4&quot; out.

	Well, they definitely are different now!  I actually had to tighten
up the front shoes, and now the pedal travels A LOT farther than it did
before.  Before it would get tight and only go about 1/4&quot; total travel!

	Anyway, the brake light also seemed to be working normally, that is
until I actually went to put the bus away tonight, when it didn't seem to be
working.  Hmmm.

	So, we'll see what happens.  I'm sending the other MC back cause
it was leaking, in hopes of getting my $$ back.
