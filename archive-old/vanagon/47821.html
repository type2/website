Subject: Vanagon Head Gasket

Okay, so I have a 86 Wolfsburg edition.  I have about 92k on the engine. At
some time in the near future I will need at least head gaskets.  What can I
expect, in cost.  If I get the head gaskets only what will be the average
cost? If I get the heads rebuilt what could be the cost?  If I get a
complete rebuild what should be the cost?  I am try to lay out money for the
future.  Getting rid of the Westfalia is not an option.  I love it too much.
