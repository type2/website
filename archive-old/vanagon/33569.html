 &gt; I think that this is the chemical (NaOH-sodium hydroxide) that is used in a

SHo nuff.  But be VERY VERY careful around it; it can cause nasty chamical burns.

ANd for Dr. Porsche's sake don't put anything aluminum into the NaOH bath; it
will dissolve it.  ON the britcar list someone told a story of painters who used to clea
their brushes with lye (NaOH), and when they got newfangled paint spray
guns used the same technique -- which promptly dissolved the aluminum guns.
