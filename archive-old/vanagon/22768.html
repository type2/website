Subject: Re: quick word on compressors


I love my compressor, gone are the days that I spent hours trying to
loosen lug nuts, rusted exaust bolts, Etc. Time is money, and I love any
tool that will make my life easier. I bought my compressor (3.5 hp 25 gal)
for $185.00, and the tools have been very inexpensive. The best advantage
is the amount of variety that you have. You can paint, loosen nuts or
break rust off nuts and bolts with an air hammer, Etc. The expense is
definitely worth it!

&gt; direct drive and it was SO LOUD and vibrated so much it would scoot
&gt; across the floor.  I returned it the same day.  The belt drives are
&gt; much smoother and quieter.  the direct drives do have the advantage
&gt; of being 'oiless' so for painting they may be the way to go.  
&gt; 
&gt; my 3 HP compressor is probably the best and most used all-purpose
&gt; shop tool i have bought.  it is a purchase no tinkerer will regret.
