What kind of vehicle is it?

Also, about your turn signal problem, check and make sure the bulb is properly
mounting.  I have a brake light where the little clip things are broken off and
so I have to periodically jiggle the socket around to make it work.

A way to check that this might be the problem (or that a bulb-socket connection
is at fault) would be to check the socket with a multimeter for voltage with the
turn signal on.

Good luck.
