     &gt;I was wondering if it is at all feasible to turn a rear wheel
     &gt;drive Westy into a Syncro.

     &gt;Please let me know if I've stepped outside the confines of reality.

     There are no confines of reality! Not on this list!  ;-)

     Desperately seeking a Syncro Westie, I considered your plan.

     Anything is possible, but IMHO, this one is too hard. Its not
     just the drivetrain you need, but the special stuff like the syncro
     gas tank and associated filler system ('cause your new front diff is
     going to be sitting where your current tank is), the snorkle air
     intake so you can ford those rivers, the diff lock control system,
     the groovy little mud flaps, etc.

     But for a Shoestring Syncro Westie (SSW) consider the reverse. Buy a
     syncro (two were posted here within the last ten days or so for under
     $3K). Buy a dead Vanagon Westie, or work those junkyards until you
     find one, and transplant the Westie into the Syncro ($500-1500,
     depending on luck and perserverance). Do the labor yourself, since
     this is the Shoestring version, and there you are. Listmembers have
     already done it, I think there is a post or two on the process in the
     archives, and with the price of these midwestern syncros, the $
     numbers look very good.

     Hey, end your summer excursion in Denver, sell the SSW, take your
     profit, and repeat next year! But meanwhile, keep your eyes open
     for the factory Syncro Westie that has your name on it. Its out there.
