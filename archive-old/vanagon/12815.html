So martha rubin says:
&gt; Regarding a simple shower, I've got one as simple as can be.  It consists of 
&gt; a dedicated never used plastic insectide sprayer.  The container is about 2 
&gt; gallons in capacity complete with about a 3' hose and &quot;shower head&quot;.  Being 
                                                         ^^^^^^^^^^^
I'm wondering what type of 'shower head' can be used in this setup.  I would
imagine pretty small considering the small container.

I really like the idea though.  Regarding your question about additional 
stuff being added, I wouldn't do it.  I'd stick with the basic idea and
keep it simple.  Someone asked about hooking it up to an air compressor.
Well, if you want that 'Ultra Satisfying Enema' that's up to you. ;)
