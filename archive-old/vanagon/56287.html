Subject: March CCC's update


This event promises to be well-attended:  22 vehicles signed up
yesterday alone!

At any rate, the preferred date is definitely the weekend of March 21-24.
This is because of the various eclipse/comet viewing activities.  Please
note that this peaks on SUNDAY evening, so some of you may wish to
arrange now for taking Monday off if possible.

We still don't have a specific location, but the marked trend is to
get away from electric lights and atmosphere conditions of any
nearby cities.  Several have suggested looking for some high
ridge in the dessert.  As we anyway want to be sort of midway
between LA and SF (maybe not in a straight line, but at least
equidistant from the two), many have suggested Panamint Springs
again.  I've asked Al Knoll to see if we might get space there
again this year.  This place is a an oasis in the middle
of nowhere, and hence has phenomenal view of the stars at
night, etc.  Death Valley is not too terriby far away.

Other suggestions have been for many good places like Anza Borrego,
or Joshua Tree, both of which I'm told will be vastly over-run at
this time, due to many planning to see the same celestial event
we are.

Comments?
