Subject: Re: Brake pad scraping sound

Ron,

Are you sure the sound's coming from the front? I have a similar sound 
and I'm pretty sure it's coming from a sticky emergency brake cable and 
the resulting sticky right rear brake...of course, I'm open to exploring 
other possibilities.

After driving, check (careful not to hurt fingers) to see if any of your 
wheels are hot. That could indicate a sticky brake or maladjusted pads.

&gt; Hi folks,
&gt; 
&gt; I'm about to replace the worn rotors/pads on my '71, but before I delve into
&gt; it, I have a question regarding a sound I've been hearing recently.  I'm
&gt; getting an intermittent scraping sound coming from the front drivers side
&gt; wheel.  When I press on the brake pedal the sound disappears and stays away
&gt; for awhile only reoccur intermittently.  I'm not getting any scraping sound
&gt; when I apply the brakes and the van does not pull to one side before or
&gt; after braking.
&gt; 
&gt; Now, this is the first disc brake vehicle I've had.  I'm wondering if the
&gt; piston in the caliper could be sticking slightly (either do to a partially
&gt; blocked brake line or a problem with the caliper) and causing the pads to
&gt; rub a little. 
&gt; I won't know the condition of the caliper until I remove it, I'd just like a
&gt; sneak preview/advice regarding the probable cause.  Could this be some
&gt; phenomenon of worn pads?  If so, I'd expect to hear the scraping when I
&gt; applied the brakes and not when they're retracted.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; (that's the brakes, I guess)
