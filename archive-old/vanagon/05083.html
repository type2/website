Subject: Lift Kits

You can lift the rear I think by just using a syncro spring. I lifted my rear
of my syncro an additional inch or two buy buying and installing two round
doughnut wedges to go over the rear springs to compliment the one doughnut
wedge that the van comes with new. This latter method would be a good cheapo
method for any van and I recomend it to ya dudes who want more height.
