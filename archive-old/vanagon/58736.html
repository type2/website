        There is no way to compare the two, a diesel does not produce the
gases that are tested for durring a smog test.  As an added note, coming
from a family mining background, a diesel can be run in a mine (with a cat
or water based oil trap on the exaust).  There is no way to ever make a
gasoline engine clean enough to run in a mine. The positive &quot;enviro&quot; aspects
of the diesel engine are one of the reasons that I am a diesel nut (I also
like the way that they sound, they sound like they have a purpose).
