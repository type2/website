Subject: Re: basic electronics question


suggestions for a method of settlement:

1) whoever posts the mosts wins :-)
2) whoever manages to sound most knowledgeable wins
3) whoever has the most jazzed-up vanagon wins
4) whoever has the most VWs wins

...and my most preferred:

5) whoever has the meanest lawyer wins (Ric, would you step back into the
   ring just one more time for this ;-)
