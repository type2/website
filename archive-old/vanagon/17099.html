Subject: Wanted: Air Cooled Vanagon

Hey all you Bay-Area air-cooled Vanagon owners,

A friend of mine at work is interested in an aircooled ('80-83 1/2) Vanagon. 
He'll consider Westy or non, as long as its running and reliable. He'd really 
like a Westy, but they seem to be almost twice the price for these years. And 
yes, I had something to do with his excellent vehicle selection!

It's for my friend Mike...he's really a nice old guy and is currently driving a 
Oldsmobile wagon with a grinding transmission. We would be able to remain a 
proud group with him as a Vanagon driver.

Must be somewhere in the Bay Area (San Jose preferred)...please email me 
directly so as not to clog bandwidth. 

Thanks, 

Erik
