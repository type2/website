Subject: Better informed on buying a Bus

        This is Charlie again.  I had posted a message asking for advice on
buying a Bus, and this list leapt to the task!  Yes, I was given reasoned
advice  on the differences between the '71 engine and '72 and later type IV
engines.  Both sides of this issue make good points, though amongst the two
mechanics I talked to around here the '71 won out.

        Basically, I have decided if I want to go fast I'll just take my
'93 CBR F2 Honda motorcycle.  Yes, I know no Bus is going to go fast, and I
wouldn't want to drive a breadloaf fast anyway.  The '71 engines are
cheaper to work on, and since I do split my transportation duties between
car and bike, I am not likely to run up a lot of miles on either too
quickly.  Plus, I only have $2000.

        While I shop for a Bus I am looking only at new or recently rebuilt
engines.  Based on advice from Andrea, John Kyte, Joel Walker, Alex Munro
and Jack Stafford I am armed with the Muir manual (which I would have
bought anyway because it is the only manual I actually understood and
laughed while reading!), as well as a remarkably timed article in Hot VW's.
So far I have only seen overpriced junk- but I'm looking at two others
today, and there is some sort of Porsche/VW display at the Pomona
Fairgrounds a week from tomorrow (Sunday).

       Any more advice can be sent to me directly- I am unsubscribing for
now because the list is too busy for my mailbox.  I should be back,
though...

       Wish me luck.
Charlie
