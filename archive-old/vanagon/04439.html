Subject: Quick advice needed re bug purchase

I just had a 74 Bug I'm thinking of buying checked out.

The mechanic says it needs:

	back up light repair	$32
	brake pedal sticking	$72
	muffler		$160
	engine seal		$40
	alternator belt	$22
	shift coupler/bushing	$100

He says the compression checks out at 135, 150, 130, 110.

The owner is asking $1650.

The body is in decent shape (it was a Floridian before moving to Michigan last
year).

Should I go for it?  What's a fair offer?

My '76 Westy wants some company in the driveway!

Thanks, 

Tam
