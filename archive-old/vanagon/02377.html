&gt; you all realize that this means at least two of us on this list are
&gt; related genetically.
&gt; 
&gt; is it possible that Bus-Love is a genetic trait? :)
&gt; 
It must be true.  It lies dormant for years and then just hits you 
like a brick.  Pun intended.  We are outcasts from the rest of the 
automotive world because they just don't understand.  How can you 
explain your love for your VW when it is happening at such a personal 
level?  I mean, you either got it or you don't.  You are born with a 
propensity to love them or you are not.  Now there's a word.

Ok, I must stop drinking coffee all afternoon.  Look, it's quiting 
time.  I'm gonna go see how my bus did today.  You know it sits in the
parking lot behind my apt next to a blue '71 fastback.  The owner 
lives in the same building, has a history degree like 
me....hmmm....wonder if he has e-mail....
