Subject: Re: Just got a 1987 Westy Syncro!! (Ref. Light)

&gt;&gt;I also can't seem to light that damn refrigerator on gas... any suggestions
&gt;&gt;there? I've read the fridge suggestions on the syncro page (I tried rapid
&gt;&gt;fire ignition plunges.. holding the B button down for 30 secs, etc.. but to
&gt;&gt;no avail... any tios would be GREATLY appreciated!!).
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Thanks for any insights!!

&gt;Unscrew the little metal cap under the lower lip of the refrigerator (it
&gt;usually has a little metal chain on it). Then try to light it. If it
&gt;lights, replaced the cap and light it again.
&gt;
&gt;This did the trick for me. (Felt great to have a working refrig.)

When I got my '89 Westy a few weeks ago and was testing things out, I
thought the fridge wasn't lighting also--by looking at the inside lower
left corner of the box. However, when I turned the water/battery monitor
panel switch on, the lowest left light for the fridge was shining green. I
did find that the piezo needed to be done rapid fire two or three times,
but after I gave up on the lower left flame viewer and believed the
water/battery panel light, I lit it every time.
