Subject: new one

Greetings to all from Maine,

We are needing some knowledge about the new Eurovans;  we want to buy one
but don't know anything about them that's really valuable.  Drove a demo
forty miles on an array of roads...wow, is it fast (after our '72 Westy).
Anyone got any 
advice about mileage?

                can the furnace be made to recycle properly?

                        is the price ($34000) real???

Thanks for everything. Hoping to see you soon..

Gary and Belle, Hallowell, ME
