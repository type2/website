Subject: Weber 44IDFcarbs, 45DCOE carbs and 48IDA manifolds for sale

I have 3 weber 44IDF Carbs for Sale. Some parts are missing, I only have 1
velocity stack and 1 manifold, some linkage, and 1 filter. The carbs would
probably need to be rebuilt. They are $200. I also have 2 Weber 45 DCOE
carbs, no manifolds, linkage or linkage for $200. Also, some short and tall
48IDA manifolds for $70/ea.
Please E-mail if interested.
Thanks,
Josh
