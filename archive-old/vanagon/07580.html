Subject: Re: Raise The Rear!!!

To fix the problem, you're gonna have to get
&gt;those torsion bars re-adjusted, and yes, it is EXTREMELY time intensive.
&gt;I am currently saving my $$$ to pay the labor fees to have mine done.
&gt;
&gt;Bummer, the easy way out ain't gonna do it this time!
&gt;

Perhaps I'm just getting better at it after all the practise I've had, but 
it only takes me half an hour to do both sides.
