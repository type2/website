Subject: eerie cig. liters?


I finally accepted that I was not imagining things:  my cigarette
lighter (or rather I guess the receptacle into which it plugs) glows
in the dark?  It doesn't matter whether the keys are in the 
ignition or not, whether the car is started or not, or whether
any other lights (including head) are on or not - it just simply
always glows this eerie, creepy greenish goo color.  I would
have thought that the battery would eventually die this being
the case, but there are circumstances in the past where it has sat
for a number of weeks, and the charge was not affected.

Does anyone else have this gremlin living in their vehicle?

It seems so strange - as if the Germans thought that the most
important thing you'd need to find in the dark was something to
placate the smoking habit  :) - but I would just as soon have
seen that illumination cast upon the ignition key surround, or
an interior door handle or window crank.  

Very, very strange.........
