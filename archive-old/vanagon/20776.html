&gt; Does anybody know how to fix the sliding door lock on an 82 vanagon? In 
&gt; my van (name: turtle, what else could you call a diesel westy), the 
&gt; little knob on the inside that locks the sliding door does not stay in 
&gt; the &quot;open&quot; position any more. To open the door you have to either push 
&gt; the knob up (from the inside) or keep the key turned (from the outside). 
&gt; It seems like a spring or something is missing. 
&gt; Does anybody know how to remove the door panel in order to get to the lock?
&gt; 
The little spring is broken and is practically impossible to fix. What I
did was to unscrew the locking knob and slip a short piece of 1/4 or 3/8 &quot;
surgical tubing over the knob's shaft. When you screw the knob back in the
tubing rubs on the lock mechanism enough to keep it in place.
