&gt;While on this topic I might as well ask if anyone has any advice on how to
&gt;fix the the inside lock.  The piece that you push up to unlock the door won't
&gt;stay in the up position, making it impossible to leave the door unlocked.
&gt;Granted this isn't a big deal.

The latch relies on a spring that is almost impossibel to replace when
broken. A quick fix (which has lasted a3 years on my van) is to unscrew the
black locking knob and slip some rubber tubing over the shank and screw it
back in. The tubing rubs against the lock and provides enough friction to
keep the knob up when you want it ;)
