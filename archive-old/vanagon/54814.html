&gt; While on the subject ....
&gt;  
&gt;  What is the difference between a 1986 Vanagon Camper and a Vanagon Camper 
&gt; Wolfsberg 
&gt;  Edition???
&gt;  
&gt;  I'm looking to buy a Wolfsberg Edition and I am not clear about how it 
&gt; differs from a standard Camper.

I've never been able to distinguish any concrete difference.  In later years,
like 87 &amp; 88 the Wolfsburgs cam with seating arrangement that was specific
only to the Wolfsburgs.  In 87-89, the Wolfsburgs were not Campers.  In 86,
as near as I can tell, there was not a feature that was on it that would make
it any different than a regular Vanagon Camper with the right options.
 Sometimes Wolfsburgs just included a group of options as standard and might
have included a paint color or interior fabric that was Wolfsburg specific.
 I think that might be the case here.  If you have an oppurtunity to look at
both, I'd sure like to hear about any differences.
