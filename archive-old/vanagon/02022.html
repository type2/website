        Hello,

        I'm a recent addition to the 'vanagon' distribution list.

        I've only been getting stuff via the list for a couple days and am
        not sure all what goes on, but I thought I'd introduce meself to the
        party.

        Connection/Interest: 91 2WD Camper, Ruby (short for Rubato).
        
        Location: Vancouver, Washington (Portland, OR)

        Carphone: 206-921-5818

        Who pays my email bills: Hewlett Packard

        
        I can see from the mail I've gotten so far that there's quite a bit of
        discussion about specific technical problems. A couple things I'd like
        to get, if available: (1) maybe the last few months' worth of mail, if 
        anyone archives the data. (2) I see from Joel's &quot;UJ's Numbers again ...&quot;
        ya'll are scattered all over the front-top of the planet. Has there
        ever been any kinda list of overnight spots to park for traveling
        campers (or any horizontal Kelvinator)? Meaning: If I got a call from
        someone cruising down I-5 near PDX and they wanted to know if they could
        pop their top nearby, I could probably help them out.


        In case there's anyone wanting to know any details about changes I've
        made to Ruby, here's what she's got, presently:

        Stock-Burgundy Red, alloy, cruise, P/W.

        Added-Alpine 7930 CD player, stuffed the glove box with
        Soundstream Amps, and velcroed a set of Cambridge Soundworks Ensembles
        to the back walls, (1) deep-cycle auxiliary battery with isolator,
        replaced that crappy (and expensive) faucet with (2) off-the-shelf ($8)
        kitchen sink spray hoses, copied the nifty idea from the Eurovan/Winne-
        bago camper and ran a H2O line to the back of the closet and connected
        another spray hose for cleaning feet after walking the beach or whole
        bodies in the bush, installed (4) 12V recepticles in the camper wood
        for 12V lights, vacuum and bedside radio.

        What I'd like to add/change and am fishing here for experienced input:

        Gray water sump.
        Propane heat.
        

        I'm about to buy tires and am finding that the Michelin MXL-Reinforced
        units are an obvious choice. Has anyone found anything better?
