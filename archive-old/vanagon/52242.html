Subject: 80 Vanagon Backfires when starting

I have a 1980 Vanagon Westfalia with a 2000cc FI motor.  When I start the
engine, occassionally the engine will backfire once.  It is not a loud
backfire, but enough that you can tell that it is backfiring.  Does anyone
know what might be causing this?  I just did a complete tune up, points,
condensor, cap, rotor, plugs and timing about 2 weeks ago.  The backfiring
just started about 3 days ago.  Once the engine is running, there are no
problems at all.

Is there any possibility that I am causing any damage with the backfire?

Thanks for your help.
