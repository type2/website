go to a Dead show...you'll find some ferngrower that has some for sale, 
along with t-shirts, pipes, bongs, and postage stamps.

&gt; upscale) local restaurant parking lot, sporting a rear window decal, that 
&gt; looked exactly like the standard VW Fahvergnugen sticker, complete with 
&gt; recumbent stickman figure, that read &quot;Fukengruven&quot; even including umlauts
&gt; over the &quot;u&quot;'s.  I'm sorry, flame me, call me tasteless, heck, kick me 
&gt; outa here (no, not that please - I'll behave from now on), but I WANT 
&gt; ONE!  My wife, a staid, reticent woman of pure Norwegian descent, will 
&gt; even let me mount the d*mn thing!  As anyone else seen these?  Where can 
&gt; I get one (preferably by special courier, or maybe I could settle for FedEx)?
