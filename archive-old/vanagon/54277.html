&gt; Yes folks, looks like another great Ron Salmon deal for us grateful list
&gt; folks.  I'd just like to remind you all that 2 or 3 weeks ago we were
&gt; notified about a similar (then bargain) Westy FS, then warned off it once
&gt; the details became known!!  Remember that now?  It was the salvage titled
&gt; Florida saltwater flood rightoff, flooded above the floor, hence above
&gt; engine and trans.  If the current seller, Mr Salmon, has anything he'd care
&gt; to add to this let's hear it.  Maybe it's not the same vehicle? (hah!).
&gt; Watch it folks, on top of a very inflated price (check Edmonds) it's a very
&gt; suspect vehicle.  Those of you who think I'm trampling on the sacred toes of
&gt; 'a regular business deal' can just PO on this one!  Let the flames begin!!!
&gt; Tim, (highly steamed again)
&gt; 
&gt; 
Just wanted to let everyone know that I have had numerous transactions
with Mr. Salmon and have been extremely pleased with his honesty.  I have
purchased numerous parts for my Westy from him and he has been very fair
in all deals.  Most of the Vans I have seen are in excellent to good shape
at very resonable prices.  I have not seen this van nor am I sure of book
value, but if he says it is excellent condition, then it is.  I have
bought used mechanical parts from Ron and he even exchanges them for me if
they do not work.  Find that from anyone else and I will be suprised.  It
is a shame that someone who has no prior knowledge (or so it seems) wants
to be ignorant.  I just wanted to let everyone know my experience with
Ron.
