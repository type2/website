Subject: '81 #3 cylinder

As I reported earlier, pulling off the #3 wire from the distributor makes
no difference how the engine runs.

I checked the spark, and it is fine, so I suspected the fuel injector or
wiring.  First, I swapped the wires on #3 and #4, with no change.  Then, I
swapped the injector on #3 with the one on the #4.  Again no change.

I really don't know what to try now.  Any suggestions will be appreciated
and tried.

Thanks,

Bill
