Thanks to everyone who responded to my Newbie message.  I've got lots of
info to review now.   One question - an ad in my local paper says a Westy
has a &quot;jump seat&quot;.  I havent heard anything about this on the list.  What
is it?

Thanks, Trish

&gt; Hi
&gt; 
&gt; I'm new to this list and new to Westfalias.  In fact I don't even have
one
&gt; yet, but I'm hoping to get one this fall.  Does anyone know of a site
that
&gt; I can get some real basic info about them?  I've been enjoying the posts
on
&gt; this list, but they are a bit too technical for what I need to know at
this
&gt; point.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks in advance
&gt; 
&gt; Trish
