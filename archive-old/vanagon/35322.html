&gt;&gt; When I was shopping for CV boots, I asked for German - this FLforeignAPS
&gt;guy
&gt;&gt; said &quot;these are Brazilian.  They don't make 'em in Germany anymore&quot;.
&gt;Suuure
&gt;&gt; they don't!  He also tried to sell me 8mm star bolts after I asked for 6mm
&gt;&gt; 6-point allen bolts - &quot;All VW busses use these&quot;.. Yeah, right, bye now!
&gt;
&gt;I know the feeling.  I was in Checker last week for a news battery for 
&gt;the van.  I asked the FLAPG for a 10mm for the post clamp.  When he 
&gt;couldn't find one he asked someone else what size they thought it was and 
&gt;when they said a 12, tried to foist it off on me.
&gt;
&gt;It'd be nice if some people had some kids that lived...
&gt;
I'd have brushed this off if it had been Kragen or something.  But this was a
foreign parts place with a pretty good reputation.  Now why did *I* have to
prove them wrong?? #)
