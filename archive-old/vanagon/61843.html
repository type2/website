&gt; My fuel pump got quite noisy last week and since I'm heading into the 
&gt; backwoods for a couple of weeks of trout fishing I checked into prices for 
&gt; a spare.

Harry:

I guess a noisy pump could be the sign of the pump's impending doom, but 
it can also be the sign of a partially clogged fuel tank or filter.  A 
couple of weeks or so ago I pulled the line going from the tank to the 
pump and ran a wire up it, into the tank.  Re-installed and......that 
annoying buzz I'd been listening to for a couple of years was gone!  (In 
a week or so it came back, so it looks like I get to drop the tank this 
summer.)
