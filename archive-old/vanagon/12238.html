&gt;I did it! I used the Infoseek service to find a German posting something
&gt;about his VW bus. Unfortunately, I cannot read what he wrote!
&gt;
&gt;After we figure out what he wrote, lets write him a note and try to get the
&gt;Germans connected with our list. Here is what I found.
&gt;
Don't get too excited, Derek. He just announced that his buddy Jogy is
looking for a vanagon ('85 or later) with no more than 100K kms. His
buddy's phone # is around Frankfurt. Doesn't indicate at all that this guy
is into VWs. In fact, being German, he may get pissed off by people
sniffing up his mail, even if it's not private. You know: Grosser Bruder
and Datenschutzgesetz.
