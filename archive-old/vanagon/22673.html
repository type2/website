Subject:       need a motor for 71 camper

hoooowwwdddyyy,

i am looking for options/prices on a new motor complete.
To compare to the cost of a rebuild. I do not have access to a 
browser so your help via e-mail is in great and never ending 
appreciation.  I live in vermont, but i understand you can ship 
anything (if you got the moooola).

1600 dual port.....thank you.
