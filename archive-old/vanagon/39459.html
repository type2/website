Subject: VVWCA Web Site!

Hi all,

The Vintage Volkswagen of America has a modest webpage.  It is 
temporarily located at:

   http://www.sky_dot_net/~rmk/vvwca/

It includes information about the club, a downloadable application, and 
some links to a few VVWCA local chapter's websites.  More will follow!

A special thanks to Richard Kurtz for his assistance on this.  The new 
location will be announced when we move it.
