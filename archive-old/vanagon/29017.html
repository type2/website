Subject: funny  vanity plate (f)

On the way into work today I spotted a very happy looking lady driving a
newish Mazda pick em up truck with the vanity license plate &quot;NO MO VW&quot; On
several occasions I have thought the same thing. Unfortunately I am addicted
and probably would be more inclined to go with &quot;VW JONZ&quot; (VW JONES).

BTW: It was I who passed HER. =)
