&gt; I just had the EXACT SAME PROBLEM this week.  It also drove me INSANE.  But
&gt; yesterday I had the CV joints repacked and so far I haven't heard it.

Here's an update:

The knocking sound came back.  It wouldn't stay away.  It was found on the 
porch the very next day.

So today I replaced one of the joints which I think was bad.  So far I 
haven't heard it ( is there a slow echo in here ;-) ).
