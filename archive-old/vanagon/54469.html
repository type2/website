Subject: WTB: Syncro non-Westy

Hi All,

This is a last chance check on any available Syncro's for sale, preferably
in the Midwest/Plains states.  Please email me with if you have any leads
for me.  I found one nearby that I'll probably get, but I want to make
sure I'm not missing any others.  It can need work, no automatics.
Thanks,
