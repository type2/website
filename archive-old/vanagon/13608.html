Subject: '65 Dormobile 4 sale

I'm posting this for a friend of mine who some of you may know or have 
heard of. He has a '65 VW Dormobile 4 sale (non running) with very little 
rust. I haven't seen the rig but other than being dirty, it sounds like 
it's in pretty decent shape. Has the refrigerator (not ice box but 
propane with tank.) It is the SO44 package. He's asking $3100 for the 
van. His name is Todd Swangstu and his number is 419.531.2954.
