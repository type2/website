&gt;On the junkyard thread, I was travelling through southern Ohio in early June
&gt;when we came upon several acres of bugs and vans.  It was off I-66 in
&gt;Cambridge, Ohio, called the Beetle Barn.  The man had several buses ready to
do
&gt;restoration on (I assume waiting for an order) seemed in very good shape.
 Also
&gt;many older not so good shape.  If you are in the area it may be worthwhile.

&gt;As I am very new to this I have no way of judging prices.  But I paid
&gt;$40. for
&gt;a bumper for a '79 camper.

Actually, it's off I-77 just south of town.  Been there many times for parts
when I lived in Zanesville, Ohio.  One of the cylinder heads on the Westfalia
came from him.
