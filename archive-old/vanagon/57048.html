Dear Rodney...
    Personally, i think your over-analysing the situation.  There's &quot;thought&quot;
and then there's &quot;THOUGHT&quot; ya know?
     Anyway, personally i would go with the VWoA replacement. 50-some years
experience with air-cooled engines says they know what they're doing, eh?    
      By the way... two thumbs up for actually putting the thermostat in!
 Everyone here in St. Louis scoffs at me for insisting on putting them back
in!
                                        Keep the Faith!
