Subject: RE: VW magazines

Brett,


	The best VW magazine you can get is called VolksWorld
	and it comes out monthly here in the U.K.
	Subscription for overseas is 52.50 U.K. pounds for
	18 months.
	I think its a more refined and knowlageable magazine
	with tech tips show reports and excellent car features.
