&gt; Fron their ad in VWTrends:
&gt; &quot;ENERGY PAK is a patented on-board microship computer that continuously
&gt; senses electrical resistance across the sparkplug gap, thereby making each
&gt; plug an &quot;in-cylinder&quot; sensor to optimize each spark on each and every
&gt; stroke of the engine.&quot;
&gt; So I called them and they happen to have a sale ending today. Their
&gt; &quot;BUG-PAK&quot; now goes for $340 instead of $480. Well, that's still too
&gt; expensive for me, but I thought some of you might want to know.
&gt; 
&gt; Btw, they guarantee a 14% hp increase, 10% more torque, and 2-3 mpg
&gt; increased mileage for my '75 1800 FI type 4 engine.

What a bunch of hooey.  Jacobs has a real strong reputation going over
on the Fordnatics list.  Several listmembers have used their systems and
reported no discernable increase in performance over good-condition
stock parts.  I believe one of the Mustang magazines even did an article
on them recently with similar conclusions.  The only good things I've
heard are that their parts are well-built and look pretty.  

Of course this is all heresay on my part, but if it were possible to
extract 14% more hp, 10% more torque, and 2-3 mpg from these engines
with better ignition systems don't you think VW would have done it?
VW engineers are not stupid.  Then there is the issue of peak HP and
torque vs area under the curve.  If a system increases my peak hp 14% at
5000 rpm but decreases hp at 2500 rpm, well, I wouldn't want it, most
likely.  I wonder how the Jacobs system affects the entire HP/Torque
curve?
