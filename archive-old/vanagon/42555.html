Subject: oil sender &amp; gauges

&gt;
&gt;As it gets warmer out I'm thinking more of installing an oil temp gauge.  Two
&gt;questions:  where should I locate the sender?  I want a location that will
&gt;report a fairly accurate oil temperature but that will not be too much of
&gt;a pain
&gt;to install.  I would also prefer the gauge to read high than to read low, but
&gt;accuracy would be a plus.
&gt;

Mine is on the drain pan. I've heard that this is probably the warmest spot
since its just about to go into the oil cooler here. I'm not sure though.
It seems to read fine.

&gt;Second:  where should I locate the gauge?  I like Sami's setup, with the gauge
&gt;in the space above the ashtray &amp; below the radio, but I'm not into metal
&gt;cutting
&gt;(this is a '78 by the way).  Mounting it under the dash to either side of the
&gt;steering column is no good because the steering wheel blocks my vision there
&gt;when I'm driving straight ahead.  Any ideas?

You can get these rubber blocks made by VDO to hold 1,2 or 3 gauges. Mount
to the panel under the dash with a couple of sheet-metal screws. Not too
bad.
They're quite visible from the drivers position if you place them correctly.
(with many of them though consider the angle of view - some that are less
critical than oil temp could be placed farther away.
You can see a picture of my layout using the VDO setup on my vanagon page,
something like:
