Subject: Car Battery FAQ 2.0

I had a large response for this, 16+ replies so far.  Forgive me all you
others but this is easiest way to do it.  There is a note on a deep cycle
battery FAQ site at the very bottom too, maybe for Westies/solar folks.

&gt;               CAR BATTERY FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS 2.0
&gt;                            September 8, 1996
&gt;
&gt;                            
&gt;A word of caution.  Batteries contain a sulfuric acid electrolyte which is 
&gt;a highly corrosive poison, that will produce gasses when recharged and 
&gt;explode if ignited.  This will hurt you--BAD!  When working with 
&gt;batteries, you need to have plenty of ventilation, remove jewelry, wear 
&gt;protective clothing and eye wear, and exercise caution.  Whenever 
&gt;possible, please follow the manufacturer's instructions for testing, 
&gt;jumping, installing and charging.  This FAQ assumes a six cell, 12 volt 
&gt;negatively grounded system found in most cars, light trucks or vans.
&gt;
&gt;The technical stuff is in [brackets].

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;1.  WHAT IS THE BOTTOM LINE?
&gt;
&gt;     A.  Perform regular preventative maintenance, especially during HOT 
&gt;weather and before COLD weather,  (See Section 3)
&gt;
&gt;     B.  Remove surface charge before load testing and check the specific 
&gt;gravity in each cell and the terminal voltage,  (See Section 4)
&gt;
&gt;     C.  Keep the battery charged, but do NOT overcharge,  (See Section 9)
&gt;
&gt;     D.  Buy the freshest and largest Reserve Capacity (RC), non-sealed 
&gt;battery that will physically fit with a Cold Cranking Amp (CCA) rating for    
&gt;your climate that meets or exceeds the car's Original Equipment 
&gt;Manufacturer's (OEM) cranking amp requirement, and  (See Section 7)
&gt;
&gt;     E.  Retest after deep discharges or jump starts for latent damage.  
&gt;(See Section 4)
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;2.  WHY BOTHER?
&gt;
&gt;Because only the rich can afford cheap batteries.....
&gt;
&gt;A good quality battery will cost between $50 and $100 U.S. and, if 
&gt;properly maintained, it should give you an average of five years of 
&gt;service.  The primary purpose of a car battery is to start the engine, 
&gt;filter or stabilize the power, and provide extra power for the ignition, 
&gt;lighting and other accessories when their combined load EXCEEDS the 
&gt;capability of the charging system, i.e., when the engine is idling.  
&gt;Secondarily, a car battery provides power to the electrical system when 
&gt;the charging system is not operating.  
&gt;
&gt;A battery &quot;ages&quot; as the active plate material sheds (or flakes off) due 
&gt;to the expansion and contraction that occurs during the discharge and 
&gt;recharge cycles.  Deep discharges, heat and vibration accelerate this 
&gt;&quot;aging&quot; process.  Eventually, the sediment builds up and the cell shorts 
&gt;out or the active material in the plates can no longer sustain a discharge 
&gt;current and the battery &quot;dies&quot;.  In a hot climate, the harshest 
&gt;environment for a battery, a recent survey of junk batteries revealed that 
&gt;the AVERAGE life of a good qualify battery was 37 months, whereas, for a 
&gt;poor quality battery, it was 23 months.   Slow cranking, especially on a 
&gt;cold day, is another good indication that your battery is going bad and it 
&gt;should be tested.
&gt;
&gt;Deeply discharged batteries almost always occur at the most inopportune 
&gt;times, e.g., AFTER you have jump started your car, at the airport 
&gt;returning home from a long trip, during bad weather, late at night in a 
&gt;dark parking lot, or when you are late for an appointment.  You can easily 
&gt;spend the cost of a new battery or more for an emergency jump start or 
&gt;tow.  
&gt;
&gt;Most of the &quot;defective&quot; batteries returned to the manufacturer  are good.  
&gt;This suggests that most SELLERS of new batteries do not know how to 
&gt;properly test batteries. 
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;3.  HOW DO I PERFORM PREVENTATIVE MAINTENANCE?
&gt;
&gt;Maintaining the correct electrolyte levels, tightening loose hold-down
&gt;clamps and terminals, removing corrosion, and checking the alternator 
&gt;belt tension is normally the ONLY preventative maintenance required for 
&gt;a battery.  The preventive maintenance frequency is dependent upon climate 
&gt;and battery type, but you should perform at least once before cold weather 
&gt;starts and once a month in hot weather.
&gt;
&gt;If the electrolyte levels are low, add DISTILLED water to the level 
&gt;indicated by the battery manufacturer or to 1/8&quot; BELOW the bottom of the 
&gt;filler tube (vent wells).  DO NOT OVERFILL, especially in hot climates!
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;4.  HOW DO I TEST A BATTERY?
&gt;
&gt;The are four simple steps to test a car battery--inspection, remove 
&gt;surface charge, state-of-charge test and load test.  To test a battery 
&gt;(or to troubleshoot charging or electrical systems), you will need a 
&gt;digital voltmeter with .5% or better accuracy.  A digital voltmeter can be 
&gt;purchased at an electronics store and will cost between $20 and $200 U.S.  
&gt;If you have a non-sealed battery, you will need a temperature compensating 
&gt;hydrometer which can be purchased at an auto parts store for approximately 
&gt;$5 U.S.       
&gt;
&gt;     A.  INSPECTION
&gt;
&gt;Visually inspect for obvious problems, e.g., loose alternator belt, low 
&gt;electrolyte, corroded cable or terminal clamps, loose hold-down clamps or 
&gt;cable terminals, or a damaged case.
&gt;
&gt;     B.  REMOVE SURFACE CHARGE
&gt;
&gt;If you have just recharged you battery or driven your car, eliminate any 
&gt;surface charge by one of the following methods; otherwise, go to the next 
&gt;step:
&gt;
&gt;          1.  Allow the battery to sit for two to three hours,
&gt;
&gt;          2.  Turn the headlights on high beam for five minutes and 
&gt;                wait five minutes, or
&gt;
&gt;          3.  With a battery load tester, apply a load at one half the 
&gt;                battery's CCA rating for 15 seconds and wait five minutes.
&gt;
&gt;     C.  STATE-OF-CHARGE TEST
&gt;
&gt;Using the following table, determine the battery's state-of-charge:  
&gt;
&gt;     Open Circuit          Approximate           Average Cell
&gt;    Battery Voltage      State-of-charge       Specific Gravity
&gt;
&gt;         12.65                100%                  1.265
&gt;
&gt;         12.45                 75%                  1.225
&gt;
&gt;         12.24                 50%                  1.190
&gt;
&gt;         12.06                 25%                  1.155
&gt;
&gt;         11.89                  0%                  1.120
&gt;
&gt;[If the temperature of the electrolyte is below 70 degrees F (21.1 degrees 
&gt;C), then add .012 volts (12 millivolts) per degree below 70 degrees F to 
&gt;the reading.]
&gt;
&gt;Check both the specific gravity in each cell with a external hydrometer 
&gt;AND the battery terminal voltage with a digital voltmeter without the 
&gt;engine running.  For sealed batteries, measuring the battery's voltage 
&gt;without the engine running with a digital voltmeter is the only way you 
&gt;can determine the state-of-charge.  Some batteries have a built-in 
&gt;hydrometer which only measures the state-of-charge in ONE of it's six 
&gt;cells.  If the indicator is clear or light yellow, then the battery has a 
&gt;low electrolyte level and should be refilled before proceeding, or if 
&gt;sealed, the battery should be replaced.
&gt;
&gt;If the state-of-charge is BELOW 75% using either the specific gravity or 
&gt;voltage test or the built-in hydrometer indicates &quot;bad&quot; (usually dark), 
&gt;then the battery needs to be recharged BEFORE proceeding.  Replace the
&gt;battery, if one or more of the following conditions occur:
&gt;
&gt;           1.  If there is a .050 or more difference in the specific 
&gt;                 gravity reading between the highest and lowest cell, you 
&gt;                 have a weak or dead cell(s), 
&gt;
&gt;           2.  If the battery will not recharge to a 75% or more 
&gt;                 state-of-charge level or if the built-in hydrometer still 
&gt;                 does not indicate &quot;good&quot; (usually green, which is 65% 
&gt;                 state-of-charge or better), 
&gt;
&gt;           3.  If digital voltmeter indicates 0 volts, you have an open
&gt;                 cell, or
&gt;
&gt;           4.  If the digital voltmeter indicates 10.45 to 10.65 volts, 
&gt;                 you have a shorted cell.  [A shorted cell is caused by 
&gt;                 plates touching, sediment build-up or &quot;treeing&quot; between 
&gt;                 plates.
&gt;
&gt;     D.  LOAD TEST
&gt;
&gt;If the battery's state-of-charge is at 75% or higher or has a &quot;good&quot; 
&gt;built-in hydrometer indication, then load test the battery by one of the 
&gt;following methods:
&gt;
&gt;          1.  Turn the headlights on high beam for five minutes,  
&gt;
&gt;          2.  Disable the ignition and turn the engine over for 15 
&gt;                seconds with the starter motor, 
&gt;
&gt;          3.  With a battery load tester, apply a load equal to one half
&gt;                of the CCA rating of the battery for 15 seconds, or
&gt;
&gt;          4.  With a battery load tester, apply a load equal to one half 
&gt;                the OEM cranking amp specification for 15 seconds.
&gt;
&gt;DURING the load test, the voltage on a good battery will NOT drop below 
&gt;9.7 volts with the electrolyte at 80 degrees F (26.7 degrees C).  [If the 
&gt;electrolyte is above 80 degrees F, add .1 volt for every 10 degrees  above 
&gt;80 until you reach 100 degrees.  If below 80 degrees F, subtract .1 volt 
&gt;for every 10 degrees until 40 degrees.]  After the load is removed, wait 
&gt;five minutes and the battery should &quot;bounce back&quot; to the 50% 
&gt;state-of-charge level or above.  If the battery drops below minimum test 
&gt;voltage, does not bounce back, or will not start the engine, then you 
&gt;should replace it.  If the battery passes this test, you should recharge 
&gt;it to restore it to peak performance.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;5.  HOW DO I KNOW IF MY CHARGING SYSTEM IS OK?
&gt;
&gt;A car's charging system is composed of an alternator (or DC generator), a 
&gt;voltage regulator, battery and indicator light or gauge.  While the engine 
&gt;is running, it's purpose is to provide power for the car's electrical 
&gt;load, e.g., ignition, lighting, accessories, etc., and to recharge the 
&gt;car's battery.
&gt;
&gt;When the charging system fails, usually an indicator light will come on or 
&gt;the gauge will not register &quot;good&quot;.  The most common charging system 
&gt;failure is a loose, worn or broken alternator belt, so check it first.  If 
&gt;OK, then with a known good battery and the engine running at 2000 RPM or 
&gt;more for two minutes, depending on the load and ambient temperature, the 
&gt;voltage should increase to between 13.0 and 15.1 volts.  Most cars will 
&gt;measure between 14.0 and 14.5 volts on a warm day.  [Most voltage 
&gt;regulators are temperature compensated to properly charge the battery 
&gt;under different environmental conditions.  As the ambient temperature 
&gt;decreases, the charging voltage is increased to overcome the higher 
&gt;battery resistance.  Conversely,  as the ambient temperature increases, 
&gt;the charging voltage is reduced.  Other factors affecting the charging 
&gt;voltage are the battery's condition, state-of-charge, electrical load and 
&gt;electrolyte level and purity.]  
&gt;
&gt;If terminal voltage is below 13.0 volts and the battery tests good after 
&gt;being externally recharged or if you are still having problems keeping it 
&gt;charged, then have the charging system's output voltage and current and 
&gt;car's parasitic (key off) load tested.  A loose alternator belt or bad 
&gt;diode will significantly reduce the alternator's current output.  
&gt;
&gt;If output voltage is above 15.1 volts with the ambient temperature above 
&gt;freezing, the battery's electrolyte level is frequently low, or you smell 
&gt;&quot;rotten eggs&quot; around the battery, then you are probably overcharging the 
&gt;battery and the charging system should be tested.    
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;6.  HOW DO I JUMP START MY CAR?
&gt;
&gt;In cold weather, a good quality booster cable with four to six gauge wire
&gt;is necessary to provide enough current to the disabled car to start the
&gt;engine.  [The smaller the wire gauge number, i.e., the larger the wire
&gt;diameter, the better.]  Please check the owner's manual for BOTH vehicles
&gt;BEFORE attempting to jump start and follow the manufacturer's procedure
&gt;because some cars should not be running during a jump start.  However,
&gt;starting the disabled car with the good car running can prevent having 
&gt;two disabled.  DO NOT allow the booster cable clamps touch each other or 
&gt;the POSITIVE clamp to touch the frame or engine block. 
&gt;
&gt;     A.  If BELOW freezing, determine that the electrolyte is NOT frozen 
&gt;in the dead battery.  If frozen, allow to thaw BEFORE proceeding.  A 
&gt;discharged battery, i.e., battery voltage or 12.0 volts or less or 
&gt;specific gravity of 1.140 or less, will freeze at approximately 8 
&gt;degrees F (-15 degrees C).
&gt;
&gt;     B.  Without the cars touching, turn off all unnecessary accessories 
&gt;and lights on BOTH cars and insure there is plenty of ventilation.
&gt;
&gt;     C.  Start the car with the good battery and let it run for at least
&gt;two or three minutes at fast idle to recharge it's battery BEFORE 
&gt;proceeding.
&gt;
&gt;     D.  Connect the POSITIVE booster cable clamp (usually RED) to the
&gt;POSITIVE terminal on the dead battery.  Connect the POSITIVE booster 
&gt;cable clamp on the other end of the booster cable to the POSITIVE terminal 
&gt;on the good battery.
&gt;
&gt;     E.  Connect the NEGATIVE booster cable clamp (usually BLACK) to the
&gt;NEGITIVE terminal on the good battery and the NEGATIVE booster cable clamp
&gt;on the other end to a clean, unpainted area on the engine block or frame 
&gt;on the disabled car AWAY from the battery.
&gt;
&gt;     F.  Let the good car to continue to run at high idle for five minutes 
&gt;OR MORE to allow the dead battery to receive some recharge and to warm 
&gt;it's electrolyte.
&gt;
&gt;     G.  Start the disabled car and allow to run at high idle.  If the car
&gt;does not start the first time, recheck the connections, wait a few minutes
&gt;and try again.
&gt;
&gt;     H.  Disconnect the booster cables in the REVERSE order, starting with 
&gt;the NEGITIVE clamp on the block or frame of the disabled car to minimize 
&gt;the possibility of an explosion.
&gt;
&gt;     I.  As soon as possible, fully recharge and test the dead battery 
&gt;for latent or permanent damage as a result of the deep discharge.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;7.  WHAT DO I LOOK FOR IN BUYING A NEW BATTERY?
&gt;
&gt;Battery buying strategy for use in Canada, for example, is different than 
&gt;hot climates that you find in Texas.  In the colder climates, higher CCA
&gt;ratings are more important; whereas, in a hot climate, a higher RC ratings
&gt;are more important once the CCA rating has satisfied the OEM cranking amp
&gt;requirement.
&gt;
&gt;     A.  Cold Cranking Amps (CCA)
&gt;
&gt;The most important consideration is sizing the battery's CCA rating to
&gt;MEET OR EXCEED, depending on the climate, the car's OEM cranking
&gt;requirement.  [CCAs are the discharge load measured in amps that a fully
&gt;charged battery at 0 degrees F (-17.8 degrees C) can deliver for 30 
&gt;seconds and while maintaining the voltage above 7.2 volts.  Batteries are 
&gt;sometimes advertised by their Cranking Performance Amps (CA) or Marine 
&gt;Cranking Amps (MCA) measured at 32 degrees F (0 degrees C) or Hot Cranking 
&gt;Amps (HCA) measured at 80 degrees F (26.7 degrees C), which are not the 
&gt;same as CCA.  Do not be mislead by CA, MCA or HCA ratings.  To convert CAs 
&gt;to CCAs, multiply the CAs by .8.  To convert HCAs to CCAs, multiply HCAs 
&gt;by .69.]  
&gt;
&gt;In hot climates, buying batteries with double or triple the CCA ratings 
&gt;that exceed the OEM requirement is a WASTE of money.  However, in colder
&gt;climates the higher CCA rating the better, due to increased power 
&gt;required to crank a sluggish engine and the inefficiency of the cold 
&gt;battery.  As batteries age, they are less capable of producing CCAs.
&gt;
&gt;One of the major battery manufacturers, Exide, publishes the following 
&gt;table:
&gt;
&gt;    Available Power        Temperature        Power Required
&gt;     From Battery           degrees F         To Crank Engine
&gt;
&gt;        100%                   80                  100%
&gt;
&gt;         65%                   32                  155%
&gt;
&gt;         40%                    0                  210%
&gt;
&gt;         25%                  -32                  350%
&gt;
&gt;[If more CCA capacity is required, two (or more) 12 volt batteries can be
&gt;connected in parallel.  Within a BCI group size, generally the battery 
&gt;with more CCA will have more plates because a larger surface area is 
&gt;required to produce the higher current.]
&gt;
&gt;     B.  Reserve Capacity (RC)  
&gt;
&gt;The second most important consideration is the Reserve Capacity rating
&gt;because of the effects of an increased parasitic (key off) load and in 
&gt;emergencies.  [RC is the number of minutes a fully charged battery at 80 
&gt;degrees F (26.7 degrees C) can be discharged at 25 amps until the voltage 
&gt;falls below 10.5 volts.]  More RC is better in every case!  In a hot  
&gt;climate, for example, if your car has a 360 OEM cranking amp requirement, 
&gt;then a 400 CCA rated battery with 120 minute RC with more electrolyte 
&gt;would be more desirable than one with 1000 CCA with 90 minutes of RC.  
&gt;
&gt;[If more RC is required, two six volt batteries can be connected in series 
&gt;or two (or more) 12 volt batteries can be connected in parallel.  Within a 
&gt;BCI group size, generally the battery with larger RC will weigh more 
&gt;because it contains more lead.]
&gt;
&gt;     C.  Type
&gt;
&gt;The two most common types of CAR batteries are low maintenance 
&gt;(non-sealed) and maintenance free (non-sealed or sealed).  [The low 
&gt;maintenance batteries have a lead-antimony/calcium (dual alloy or hybrid) 
&gt;plate formulation; whereas, the maintenance free batteries have a 
&gt;lead-calcium/calcium formulation.]  The advantages of maintenance free 
&gt;batteries are less preventative maintenance, longer life, faster 
&gt;recharging, greater overcharge resistance, reduced terminal corrosion and 
&gt;longer shelf life, but are more prone to deep discharge (dead battery) 
&gt;failures. In hot climates, buying non-sealed batteries is recommended 
&gt;because a sealed battery will NOT allow you to add water when required or 
&gt;to test the specific gravity with an external hydrometer.   
&gt;
&gt;Some manufacturers introduced a third type of car battery, &quot;dual&quot;, that 
&gt;combined a standard battery with switchable emergency backup cells.  For 
&gt;about the same cost a better approach was to buy two batteries and isolate 
&gt;them.
&gt;
&gt;For off road applications in trucks, recreational vehicles (RVs), 4x4s, 
&gt;vans or sport utility vehicles, some manufacturer's distribute &quot;high 
&gt;vibration&quot; or RV battery versions designed to reduce the effects of 
&gt;moderate vibration.  For excessive vibration applications, it is best to 
&gt;buy a commercial battery.
&gt;
&gt;Car batteries are specially designed for high initial cranking amps
&gt;(usually for five to 15 seconds) to start an engine; whereas, deep cycle 
&gt;(or marine) batteries are designed for prolonged discharges at lower 
&gt;amperage.  A &quot;dual marine&quot; battery is a compromise between a car and deep 
&gt;cycle battery;  however, a CAR battery will give you the best performance 
&gt;in a CAR.  For RVs, a car battery is used to start the engine and a deep 
&gt;cycle battery is used to power the accessories.  [The batteries are 
&gt;connected to a diode isolator and both are automatically recharged by the 
&gt;RV's charging system when engine is running.  For additional information 
&gt;on multi-battery applications, call (800) 845-6269 or (503) 692-5360 and 
&gt;request a free copy of &quot;Introduction to Batteries and Charging Systems&quot; by 
&gt;Ralph Scheidler.]
&gt;
&gt;     D.  Size
&gt;
&gt;Manufacturers build their batteries to an internationally adopted Battery 
&gt;Council International (BCI) group number (24, 26, 70, 75, etc.) 
&gt;specification, [which is based on the physical case size, terminal 
&gt;placement and terminal polarity.]  The OEM battery group number is a good 
&gt;starting place to determine the replacement group.  Within a group, the 
&gt;CCA and RC ratings, warranty and battery type will vary in models of the 
&gt;same brand or from brand to brand.  Batteries are generally sold by model, 
&gt;so the group numbers will vary for the same price.  This means that for 
&gt;the SAME price you can potentially buy a physically larger battery with 
&gt;more RC than the battery you are replacing, e.g. a 34/78 group might 
&gt;replace a smaller 26/70 group and give you an additional 30 minutes of RC.  
&gt;If you do this, be sure that the replacement battery will fit, the cables 
&gt;will connect to the correct terminals, and that the terminals will NOT 
&gt;touch the hood when closed.
&gt;
&gt;BCI and the battery manufacturers publish application guides that will 
&gt;contain the OEM cranking amperage requirements and group number 
&gt;replacement recommendations by make, model and year of car, and battery 
&gt;size, CCA and RC specifications.  Manufacturers might not build or the 
&gt;store might not carry all the BCI group numbers.  To reduce inventory 
&gt;costs, dual terminal &quot;universal&quot; batteries that will replace several group 
&gt;sizes are becoming more popular and fit 75% or more of cars on the road 
&gt;today.  
&gt;
&gt;Battery manufacturers or distributors will often &quot;private label&quot; their 
&gt;batteries for large chain stores.  Below is a list of the largest domestic 
&gt;battery manufacturers/distributors in North America and my understanding 
&gt;of some of their brand names and private labels.

&gt;                Value-Lite  (Contact local Firestone store)
&gt;
&gt;     E.  Freshness
&gt;
&gt;Determining the &quot;freshness&quot; of a battery is sometimes difficult.  NEVER 
&gt;buy a battery that is MORE than SIX months old because it is starting to
&gt;sulfate.  [Sulfation occurs when lead sulfate can not be converted back to 
&gt;charged material and is created when discharged batteries stand for a long 
&gt;time or from excessive water loss.]  The date of manufacture is stamped on 
&gt;the case or printed on a sticker.  It is usually a combination of alpha 
&gt;and numeric characters with letters for the months starting with &quot;A&quot; for 
&gt;January (skipping &quot;I&quot;) and digit for the year, e.g., &quot;J6&quot; for September, 
&gt;1996.  Like bread, fresher is definitely better.
&gt;
&gt;     F.  Warranty
&gt;
&gt;As with tire warranties, battery warranties are NOT necessarily indicative 
&gt;of the quality or cost over the life of the car.  Most manufacturers will
&gt;prorate warranties based on the LIST price of the bad and replacement 
&gt;battery, so if a battery failed half way or more through its warranty 
&gt;period, buying a NEW battery outright might cost you less than paying the 
&gt;difference under a prorated warranty.  The exception to this is the free 
&gt;replacement warranty period.  This represents the risk that the 
&gt;manufacturer is willing to assume.  A longer free replacement warranty 
&gt;period is better and is usually an indication of the quality of the 
&gt;battery.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;8.  HOW DO I INSTALL A BATTERY?
&gt;
&gt;A car battery weights between 30 and 60 pounds, so the first question is
&gt;do I want to  install it myself?  The second question is what do I do with 
&gt;the old battery if not exchanged for the new one?
&gt;
&gt;     A.  Thoroughly wash and clean the old battery, battery terminals and
&gt;case or tray with water to minimize problems from acid or corrosion.  
&gt;Heavy corrosion can be neutralized with a mixture of baking soda and 
&gt;water.  Also, mark the cables so you do not forget which one it is which 
&gt;when you reconnect.
&gt;
&gt;     B.  Remove the NEGATIVE cable first because this will minimize the
&gt;possibility of shorting the battery  when you remove the other cable.  
&gt;Next remove the POSITIVE cable and then the hold-down bracket or clamp.  
&gt;If the hold down bracket is severely corroded, replace it.  Dispose the 
&gt;old battery by exchanging it when you buy your new one or by taking it to 
&gt;a recycling center.  Please remember that batteries contain large amounts 
&gt;of harmful lead and acid.  
&gt;
&gt;     C.  After removing the old battery, be sure that the battery tray 
&gt;and cable terminals or connectors are clean.  Auto parts stores sell a 
&gt;cheap wire brush that will allow you to clean the inside of a terminal 
&gt;clamps and the terminals.  If the terminals, cables or hold down brackets 
&gt;are severely corroded, replace them.  Corroded terminals or cables will 
&gt;significantly reduce starting capability.
&gt;
&gt;     D.  Thinly coat the terminal and terminal clamps with a high 
&gt;temperature grease or petroleum jelly (Vaseline) to prevent corrosion.
&gt;
&gt;     E.  Place the replacement battery so that the NEGATIVE cable will
&gt;connect to the NEGATIVE terminal.  Reversing the polarity of the 
&gt;electrical system will severely damage or DESTROY it.  
&gt;
&gt;     F.  After replacing the hold-down bracket, reconnect the cables in 
&gt;reverse order, i.e., attach the POSITIVE cable first and then the NEGATIVE 
&gt;cable last.  
&gt;
&gt;     G.  Before starting the engine, check the electrolyte levels and
&gt;state-of-charge.  Refill or recharge as required.  
&gt;
&gt; [If you want to retain your car's computer memory, security codes or radio
&gt;settings, a second battery can be temporarily connected to the electrical
&gt;system in parallel before disconnecting the first one.  A cigarette 
&gt;lighter plug can used to easily connect a parallel battery.]
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;9.  HOW DO I RECHARGE MY BATTERY?
&gt;
&gt;In addition to the earlier cautions, some more words of caution:  
&gt;
&gt;     A.  NEVER, NEVER disconnect a battery cable from car with the engine
&gt;running because the battery acts like a filter for the electrical system.
&gt;Unfiltered [pulsating DC] electricity can damage expensive electrical
&gt;components, e.g., computer, radio, charging system, etc.
&gt;
&gt;     B.  Check the electrolyte level and be sure it is not frozen BEFORE 
&gt;recharging.  
&gt;
&gt;     C.  Do NOT add water if the electrolyte is covering the top of the 
&gt;plates because during the recharging process, it will warm up and expand.  
&gt;After recharging has been completed, RECHECK the level. 
&gt;
&gt;     D.  Reinstall the vent caps BEFORE recharging and recharge ONLY in 
&gt;well ventilated areas.  NO smoking, sparks or open flames because while
&gt;the battery is being recharged because they give off explosive gasses.  
&gt;
&gt;     E.  If your battery is sealed, do NOT recharge with current ABOVE 25 
&gt;amps.
&gt;
&gt;     F.  Follow the charger manufacturer's procedures for connecting and 
&gt;disconnecting cables and operation to minimize the possibility of an 
&gt;explosion, but generally you should turn the charger OFF before connecting 
&gt;or disconnecting cables to a battery.
&gt;
&gt;     G.  If a battery becomes hot, or if violent gassing or spewing of 
&gt;electrolyte occurs, turn the charger off temporarily or reduce the 
&gt;charging rate.
&gt;
&gt;     H.  Insure that in car charging with an external charger will not 
&gt;damage the car's electrical system with high voltages.  If this is even a 
&gt;remote possibility, then disconnect the car's negative battery cable from 
&gt;the battery BEFORE connecting the charger.
&gt;
&gt;Usually, a when car is jump started, it is run to recharge (or equalize) 
&gt;the battery. This might NOT fully charge it!  The length of time to fully
&gt;recharge the battery depends on the amount of discharge, the amount of
&gt;surplus current that is diverted to the battery, how long the engine is
&gt;run, RPM, and temperature.  That is, an alternator is sized by the car
&gt;manufacturer to carry the maximum accessory load and maintain a battery--
&gt;NOT recharge a dead one.  
&gt;
&gt;[For example, if 300 amps are consumed for ten seconds to start a car from 
&gt;a fully charged battery, it will take the charging system approximately 
&gt;two and one half  minutes to replace the power used if 25 amps are 
&gt;available to the battery, or six minutes at ten amps, and an hour at one 
&gt;amp.  Using the same example with a dead 120 minute RC battery, it would 
&gt;take approximately 86 times longer to recharge it or three and one half 
&gt;hours at 25 amps, 8.7 hours at 10 amps or 86.4 hours at one amp].
&gt; 
&gt;If you have added lights, audio amplifiers, alarms, cellular telephones or 
&gt;other accessories, and &quot;stop-and-go drive occurs frequently, the 
&gt;alternator might NOT produce enough current to keep your battery fully 
&gt;charged.  You might need to increase the capacity of the charging system.  
&gt;[Ideally the combined load of all the lights,  fans, and accessories 
&gt;should be less than 75% of the charging system's maximum output, so that 
&gt;at least 25% is available to recharge the battery.] 
&gt;
&gt;A better method to recharge batteries is to use an external constant
&gt;current charger which is set not to deliver more than 12% of the RC rating
&gt;of the battery and monitor the state-of-charge.  For fully discharged 
&gt;batteries, the following table, published by BCI, lists the recommended 
&gt;battery charging rates and times:
&gt;
&gt;    Reserve Capacity         Slow Charge           Fast Charge
&gt;      (RC) Rating 
&gt;
&gt;  80 Minutes or less      15 Hours _at_ 3 amps     2.5 Hours _at_ 20 amps
&gt;
&gt;  80 to 125 Minutes       21 Hours _at_ 4 amps    3.75 Hours _at_ 20 amps
&gt;
&gt;  125 to 170 Minutes      22 Hours _at_ 5 amps      5 Hours _at_ 20 amps
&gt;
&gt;  170 to 250 Minutes      23 Hours _at_ 6 amps     7.5 Hours _at_ 20 amps
&gt;
&gt;  Above 250 Minutes       24 Hours _at_ 10 amps     6 Hours _at_ 40 amps
&gt;    
&gt;The BEST method is to SLOWLY recharge it using an external constant
&gt;voltage (or tapered current charger) because the electrolyte has more time
&gt;to penetrate the plates.  A constant voltage &quot;automatic&quot; charger applies
&gt;regulated voltage at approximately 14.4 volts.  A 10 amp automatic charger
&gt;will cost between $30 and $60 U.S. at an auto parts store.  [To prevent
&gt;damage to a fully discharged battery, the current should be less than 1%
&gt;of the CCA rating during the first 30 minutes.]  With a taper charger, a
&gt;high current, up to 30 amps, can be applied to non-sealed batteries for a
&gt;short period up to 30 minutes maximum and then is regulated downward until
&gt;the charge state reaches 100%.  
&gt;
&gt;[An excellent automatic constant voltage battery charger is a 15 volt 
&gt;regulated power supply adjusted to 14.4 volts at 80 degrees F (26.7 
&gt;degrees C).  If 32 degrees F (0 degrees C), then increase the charging 
&gt;voltage to 15.3 volts.  When charging a maintenance free battery, add .2 
&gt;volts.]
&gt;
&gt;If left unattended, a cheap, unregulated trickle battery chargers can
&gt;overcharge your battery because they can &quot;boil off&quot; the electrolyte.  Do
&gt;NOT use fast, high rate, or boost chargers on any battery that is sulfated
&gt;or deeply discharged.  This condition requires a constant current from one
&gt;to two amps for 60 to 120 hours.  The electrolyte should NEVER bubble
&gt;violently while recharging because high currents only create heat and
&gt;excess explosive gasses.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;10.  WHAT IS PARASITIC LOAD?
&gt;
&gt;Parasitic (key off) is the cumulative load produced by electrical devices, 
&gt;e.g., clocks, computers, alarms, etc., that operate after the engine is 
&gt;stopped.  Parasitic loads typically run 20 to 120 milliamps.  To test the 
&gt;parasitic load an amp meter must be inserted in series with either the 
&gt;positive or negative battery terminal and it's cable without the engine 
&gt;running.  If the parasitic load is prematurely discharging your battery, 
&gt;start removing fuses one-at-a-time until the offending electrical 
&gt;component is identified.  Leaving your headlights on will generally 
&gt;discharge a fully charged battery (with 90 minutes of RC) in four to six 
&gt;hours.
&gt; 
&gt;
&gt;11.  CAN I INCREASE THE LIFE OF MY BATTERY?
&gt;
&gt;     A.  Keeping your battery and engine well maintained is the BEST way 
&gt;to extend the life of your battery.  
&gt;
&gt;For cold climates, keeping the battery fully charged and the engine warm 
&gt;will help increase the life of the battery.  In the warmer climates and 
&gt;during the summer, the electrolyte levels need to be checked more 
&gt;frequently and DISTILLED water added, if required.  This is due to the 
&gt;high underhood temperatures.  In a study conducted by the Society of 
&gt;Automotive Engineers (SAE), the underhood temperature have increased 30% 
&gt;since 1985.  Heat shields are becoming more popular and are being used by 
&gt;a number of car manufacturers to protect the batteries from the high 
&gt;underhood temperatures.  Some battery manufacturers build &quot;hot climate&quot; 
&gt;versions by increasing the amount of electrolyte in the battery to provide 
&gt;more &quot;cooling&quot; or by special plate formulations.  Batteries last 
&gt;approximately two thirds as long in hot climates as cold ones.  
&gt;
&gt;     B.  Add distilled water--NEVER add acid or tap water and DO NOT 
&gt;OVERFILL. 
&gt;
&gt;     C.  Turning off unnecessary accessories and lights BEFORE starting 
&gt;your car will decrease the load on the battery while cranking, especially 
&gt;when it is cold.  
&gt;
&gt;     D.  Leaving your lights or other accessories on and fully 
&gt;discharging the battery can ruin your car battery, especially if it is 
&gt;maintenance free.  If this should this occur, you should test the battery 
&gt;AFTER it has been fully recharged to determine if there is any latent or 
&gt;permanent damage.
&gt;
&gt;     E.  Reduce the parasitic (key-off) load to 120 milliamps or less.  
&gt;
&gt;     F.  Storing batteries in cool locations and periodically recharging 
&gt;them.
&gt;
&gt;     G.  In cold climates, increasing the diameter (smaller wire gauge) of 
&gt;the battery cables will increase the power available to the starter motor.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;12.  WHAT ARE THE MOST COMMON CAUSES OF PREMATURE BATTERY FAILURES?
&gt;
&gt;     A.  Loss of electrolyte (which account for over 50% of the failures) 
&gt;due to underhood heat or overcharging,
&gt;
&gt;     B.  Deep discharges (leaving your lights on),
&gt;
&gt;     C.  Misapplication or using an undersized battery,
&gt;
&gt;     D.  Undercharging or loose alternator belt,
&gt;
&gt;     E.  Excessive vibration (due to a loose holdown clamp),
&gt;
&gt;     F.  Using tap water,
&gt;
&gt;     G.  Corrosion, and
&gt;
&gt;     H.  Freezing.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;13.  WHAT ARE SOME OF THE MYTHS ABOUT BATTERIES?
&gt;
&gt;     A.  Storing a battery on a concrete floor will discharge them.
&gt;
&gt;Modern lead acid battery cases are better sealed, so external leakage 
&gt;causing discharge is no longer a problem.  [Temperature stratification 
&gt;within large batteries can accelerate the internal &quot;leakage&quot; or self 
&gt;discharge if the battery is sitting on an extremely cold floor in a warm 
&gt;room or installed in a submarine.]
&gt;
&gt;     B.  Driving a car will fully recharge a battery.  
&gt;
&gt;There are a number of factors affecting alternator's ability to charge 
&gt;a battery.  The greatest factors are how much current from the alternator 
&gt;is diverted to the battery to charge it, how long the current is available 
&gt;and temperature.  Generally, running the engine at idle or short 
&gt;&quot;stop-and go trips&quot; during bad weather at night will not recharge the 
&gt;battery.  
&gt;
&gt;     C.  A battery will not explode.  
&gt;
&gt;While spark retarding vent caps help, recharging, a battery produces 
&gt;hydrogen and oxygen gasses.  If  a spark occurs, an explosion can occur.  
&gt;Remember the &quot;Hindenburg&quot;!
&gt;
&gt;     D.  A battery will not lose it's charge sitting in storage.  
&gt;
&gt;A battery has self discharge or internal electrochemical &quot;leakage&quot; that 
&gt;will cause it to become fully discharged and sulfated over time.  Prior to 
&gt;storing a battery, it should be fully charged,  placed in a cool location 
&gt;above freezing, and recharged when it reaches the 50% state-of-charge 
&gt;level or once every six months, whichever occurs first.  If left in a car 
&gt;or RV, disconnect the negative cable.  
&gt;
&gt;     E.  Maintenance free batteries never requires electrolyte.  
&gt;
&gt;In hot climates, the electrolyte could be &quot;boiled off&quot; due to the high
&gt;underhood temperatures .  Electrolyte could also be lost due to excessive 
&gt;charging voltage or charging currents.
&gt;
&gt;     F.  Test the alternator by disconnecting the battery with the engine
&gt;running.
&gt;
&gt;A battery as like a voltage stabilizer or filter to the pulsating DC 
&gt;produced by the alternator.  Disconnecting a battery while the engine is 
&gt;running can destroy the electronic components, e.g., computers, radio, 
&gt;stereo, alarm system, etc., or the charging system.  Just say NO! if 
&gt;anyone suggests this.
