Subject: Water leak from City water fill

We have an apparent leak which only happens when we are hooked up to
&quot;city water&quot; in a park, and with the faucet turned off.  I think
whatever is on the inside of the body that goes to the faucet has sprung
a leak.  It comes out along the edge of the sliding door - strange but
it must be running on a body pannel.  Does anyone know how to get to it
without taking the whole kitchen unit apart? Or, if that's really
necessary, where do I start?  What is that line made out of, copper,
rubber??
Tnanks in advance and thanks to everyone that responded to my '97
Eurovan Camper request.
