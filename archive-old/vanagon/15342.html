&gt; Howdy,
&gt; 
&gt; 	Anyone have any data points on which is better, Rust Reformer or 
&gt; Extend?  I'm doing my floor section in my bus, and some in the hard-to-reach
&gt; areas of the engine compartment, and I've been wondering...
&gt;

IMHO neither is a good solution from experience, but if I had to
pick one it would be the water based rust reformer, the Exten, i figure
you mean spray can does not go far and never seemed to penetrate that
well, sandblasting and etching primer are of course the ideal option
but I do empathsize, trying to get up above the rear suspension can be a
real trial as well, I just sprayed it down with WD40 on the '76 before
she left as a keep it where it is option.
