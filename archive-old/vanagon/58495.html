Subject: Re: Twiga has new shoes [Tires]

I would like to comment on the recommended psi your tire guy recommended:\

According to my tire guy - who I have used for some 12 years, with tires on
2 Westies and 3 toyotas (2 of the 4 x 4s) you should never inflate front and
rear the same. Front tires (and the vehicle specs) require lower inflation
than rear to prevent &quot;over steer.&quot; That is, loss of control in quick moves
especially! This could cause you to loose control and . . . .

Just offering this info for what it is worth - but if your tire people say &quot;40
psi all round&quot; I would have to question their expertise!

&gt; Hi Volks,
&gt; 
&gt; Just an update on the tire situation.  I had chosen to get the Yokohama 370
&gt; LT tires recommended by several on this list, but found them
&gt; unavailable---as previously posted, either back-ordered wth a delay of 6-8
&gt; wks; or superseded by Model Y356 LT, supposedly the same as Y370 except for
&gt; a change in tread pattern; or, to be replaced sometime soon by a completely
&gt; new tire.
&gt; 
&gt; Well, as mentioned before, the tires I had were so inadequate that it seemed
&gt; to me too risky to wait, so I decided to take the Y356s.  America's Tire Co.
&gt; in Sacramento had to order them but had them in in 48hrs, and charged $69.95
&gt; each plus stems, balancing, etc, which includes lifetime rotations and
&gt; balancing.  They gave me some trade-in for the one tire I had that was new,
&gt; so the total, with warranty, came out to about $358.
&gt; 
&gt; btw, while listees recommend inflations of approx 45 psi front and 53 rear,
&gt; the guy at America's Tire insisted that 40 front and rear was best for daily
&gt; driving, and recommended going up to 45 &amp; 50, *maybe*, &quot;if you really load
&gt; it up for a camping trip.&quot;  I mention this because he also pointed out that
&gt; the warranty would not apply if the tires werrn't used as recommended, &quot;for
&gt; example, if they were overinflated.&quot;  I don't know how seriously to take any
&gt; of this.  It seemed to me that the specs allowed for higher inflation to
&gt; correspond with weight load.  One thing he seemed to be implying was that
&gt; running front and rear at different inflations might have some implications
&gt; for differences in tire wear, which might then have some significance
&gt; related to rotation.
&gt; 
&gt; If anyone wants to shed any light on this, I'd appreciate it.  Otherwise, I
&gt; thought I'd just share my experience as a kind of update.
&gt; 
&gt; Happy vanning,
&gt; 
&gt; Gail
