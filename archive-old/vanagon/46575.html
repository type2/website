Subject: Re: syncro front shocks

&gt;I figure I
&gt;can rent one of those, but what about the others? I'd appreciate any info
&gt;from anyone that has replaced the front shocks on their syncro.
Mark,
I haven't done the front shocks on a synchro, but I did rent some spring
compressors to work on the front end of a Fiat once.  Beware!  Avoid
getting the cheap compressors that have aluminum parts.  I galled a rented
set of those to the point where I almost couldn't release them from the
compressed springs.  If you can't find anything but aluminum compressors
lube the threads up good with something like molybdinum grease that can
withstand pressure.
