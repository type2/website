&gt;maybe the Passing of the Hubcp is not such a  crazy idea after all.
&gt;maybe everybody could sign it (engraved?).
&gt;
&gt;just thinking out loud, folks. :)

Me thinks you have something there Joel.  Looking at the distribution
of the list makes it pretty obvious where the trek (I like the idea
of the 'Boisterous Busing Bufoons' here) should start:  California 
since it has the largest number of rabid owners...  But then what?
Look at Canada folks.  We've (speak up fellow Canadians!) got the
next highest number up there (admittedly I think there's a big gap
in the middle of the country as I suspect that most of us are 
in either B.C. or Ontario) and your dollar goes farther up here
than it would in your own country: 1$us == 1.38$can  We don't have
intransigent speed limits (law states that one goes as fast as everyone 
else--and everybody is going at a decent clip)  Gorgeous scenery.
Blah, nationalistic blah...  You guys could load up on spare parts
and sell them to us for gas money...  And if you get questioned at
the border you can claim that you *always* carry a spare engine with
you...  Heh.
Anyway, I envision something like this:  Start in Cal, go north
to B.C. then across Canada to Ontario.  NY, then south south (highway
61?), Texas then California...  Ooh, this could be good.  --Ralf
