&gt; My Dad's got an 84 watercooled vanagon with 160k on it. It's in his garage

&gt; Should he do it (and get another 30,000 miles on it) or sell it for
&gt; scrapmetal since everything else is just about to go bad?

Compared to many other vans/buses around this list thats still a baby.

Where is this?  Maybe before it gets sold to a junkyard someone could 
save it or at least parts of it.  I know I personally am toying with the 
idea of a bus or vanagon as a playhouse.  Engineless and 'technically 
scrapped' so as not to be a motor vehicle anymore.  I know a dealer who 
got one traded in that doesn't run and now seems to have a bad title - 
that gave me the idea.
