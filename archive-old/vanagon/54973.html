Subject: Re: Alloy Wheels ?

&gt;in my garage i have a set of alloy wheels off of an audi gt coupe,1986
&gt;vintage, 108mmx4 bolt pattern. I seem to recall reading that these might
&gt;fit a vgon. is that true? If not, what should i look for at the
&gt;pick-a-part yards in addition to vanagon wheels.

You probably heard that from me, but the only Audi wheels that will fit on a
Vanagon are wheels from a 5000 / 200 turbo or turbo quattro. The wheels off your
'86 Audi coupe GT won't fit. (unless it's a GT turbo quattro, and I SERIOUSLY
DOUBT THAT..)
(for you non-Audi enthusiasts, that is a really RARE car...)

the turbo wheels have the same 5 lug pattern as the '71 up bus/van, but the
centers have to be machined out slightly to fit over the Vanagon hub/axle cap. 

If anyone's interested, I have a complete set of 15&quot; Audi turbo wheels for sale
already machined, and come with the elongated studs/bolts. (you'll need the
elongated studs and lug bolts to mount them)
They look almost like the Vanagon &quot;Carat&quot; alloy wheels, but are 6 spoke, instead
of 5 spoke. 

you can see them at: (it takes a long time to load)

pics take a long time to load, so take a break and eat a sandwich, and they
might be finished by the time you come back.......   :&lt;)   (that's a smiley
face...)
