&gt; I added a 2nd antenna on the right side in the same location as the antenna
&gt; on the left side except this second antenna is for the CB/Ham radio. Before
&gt; putting this 2nd antenna in, I had it modified so that it would be optimized
&gt; for CB/Ham frequencies at a spy shop. It doesn't advertise the presence of a
&gt; CB at all because it is a factory antenna.

 Tell me more about your antenna. What brand is it?  Is it power? Im 
confused about the HAM part. Are you going to use the antenna with a 
scanner? We can get really techie here, but I'll leave you alone.
&quot;Factory antenna&quot; is this from Germany? An antenna for the 
SW, MW and the LW radios they have in EU?

I hope you were haven' fun when you smashed your fenders! :-)
