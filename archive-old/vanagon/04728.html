&gt;So, like, last week I'm checking out the Bus Stop catalog and adding up
&gt;what it would cost to re-do the front seats in my '76 Camper.  Hmmm...
&gt;looks like roughly $100 per seat to buy new foam and upholstry, then talk
&gt;a friend into helping me.

Well, first off, I wouldn't buy the foam from them.  They wanted $70 for 
foam for my seats.  I got a sheet of foam at the local firendly upholstery
shop for $20 or so, and had some left over!
