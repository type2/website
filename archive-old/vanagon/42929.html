Subject: VW Classic~Box on Wheels info needed

VanBondo needs info from a member of the &quot;Box on Wheels&quot; club membership.
Please reply all private like and stuff. Want camping info for friday and
sat night of the &quot;Weekend.&quot; Attendance by Rusty is back on now that I don't
have to pay for the major motor repair. A cold flip top bottle of Grolsch
for the person who responds with the correct info.

I just deleted a good joke. I swear it's tough trying to be conservative....
Grrrr! Don't ask it'll be outta context by the time I reply. I wake up every
morning and say in the mirror &quot;I will be normal,  will be normal, I will be
normal.&quot;
