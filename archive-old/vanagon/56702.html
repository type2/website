 F.Y.I. RE&gt;Changing lock cylinders

Saw your post - answer is:  Piece of Cake!!!! --I am also posting to the
list as it may be of use to others.

Take your old handle and hold it positioned as if it were installed - as if
it were an &quot;L&quot; that was rotated 90 degrees counter clockwise.  Now you have
a short cylinder pointing away from you that holds the lock cylinder.  at
the 6 oclock position (on the bottom of the lock cylinder housing  look for
a small spot of paint.  If you scrap the paint off, you will uncover a tiny
threaded hole, about 1/16&quot; in diameter.  At the bottom of this hole is a
slotted setscrew.  If you poke a jewler's screwdriver down this hole and
engage the slot in the screw and unscrew it.  This will release the lock
cylinder.  Insert the key into the lock and turn it about 45 degrees and
withdraw the lock cylinder.  Apparently the key will keep the tumblers from
falling out.  Do the same to the new handle to remove it's lock cylinder and
swap.  Re-insert and tighten the setscrew, add a dab of locktite and your
are done!
