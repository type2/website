The mileage discussion has gone on here before.  Make sure you check the 
gopher archives  if you want to see what people have said in the past.

I personally have a '84 1.9L No air, 4 spd and I get a consistent 20 mpg 
around town and anywhere from 22 to 26 on the highway. Of course I do 
have a few exhaust leaks and am probably running lean and burning my 
heads to pieces too.....
