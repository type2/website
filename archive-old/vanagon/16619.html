Subject: '67 type II for sale in WI.

I'm moving to Oregon and need to sell my '67 VW Microbus.  Deluxe, but not
the sunroof version.  It's in Madison, WI.  Rustless, very reliable, needs
some paint and interior though. $2500,  OBO.

Oh yeah, I'll be looking for another in Eugene in a few months, if anyone
has any leads.  My dream is a '67 21 window, with walkthrough front seats.
