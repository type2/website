There are now 7 potential participants at the Pizza dinner. Why don't
those who would like to be there send me an e-mail and let me know when
you CANNOT make it.

It could be any evening between tomorrow (Tuesday, 12/20) and Wednesday,
12/28 (included).

If you reply to the list, please CC me, since I get it in digest form.

Should be fun!
