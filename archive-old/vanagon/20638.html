Subject: Re:Trim Removal

&gt;Cn anyone here advise me as to how I can safely remove the metallic trim
&gt;that runs just below window level on my '72 Camper? I'm in the midst of 
&gt;a paint job, and I wanna clean look on that trim. Any advioe is appreciated!

Prise *carefully* with a fine but broad flat headed screw driver.  Accept
that you're probably going to break a couple of clips along the way - but
they can be replaced when you put the trim back......
