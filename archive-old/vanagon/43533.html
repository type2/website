  OFFICE MEMO          RE&gt;my answers to the EV                Date:6/3/96

And here is my unsolicited input
&lt;any of you EVers out there contemplating how to find out if you have
the piston slap problem - before the warranty runs out?  I think mine sounds
OK,

I thought the &quot;piston slap&quot; was the sensor equipped valve on the return line
to the gas tank. Which vibrates and creates the clatter. I remember this
being discussed awhile back, am I remembering incorrectly?

&lt;Wax has been leaking out of my door since last summer

Geez, I feel short changed. I want a runny discharge coming from the mucosal
cavity of my doors : )

As they say, give a little, get a little. So here are my questions.....

I changed the oil this weekend and I SWEAR it is running cooler. Anybody ever
experience this? Am I just crazy in the head?

Also, when I am making tight turns and the wheel is way cranked it makes this
fairly hideous grinding noise. Anybody ever have this problem?

Thanks!
