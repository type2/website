&lt;&lt; Well, my current battery is clearly going south.  I remember several
people
 saying they had adapted the spiral cell gel batteries to fit into the
 Vanagon's cramped under seat position.  How is that working out?  I think I
 am going to put in two batteries, although there doesn't appear to be any
 wiring under my driver's seat.  I am open to suggestions.  &gt;&gt;

I just recently installed my 2nd Optima battery, this time in my 87 Syncro.
 The first was in my wife's 88.  They are working out just fine.  Neither van
is a camper &amp; I understand that the opening to the battery compartments is a
bit different with campers so fit &amp; installation might be a bit different.  I
installed the &quot;universal&quot; model in both of mine which have traditional &quot;top&quot;
posts like the van expects AND places for &quot;side&quot; mounted screw-in connections
with covers.  I mounted mine on their sides with the &quot;top&quot; posts facing
forward.  The battery compartment cover closed and just hits the plastic
covers on the screw-in connectors that are not used.

I am told by another Vanagon owner that he has installed an Optima just the
same way, BUT he used the &quot;top&quot; post only model.  He says that the post
locations differ a bit between the &quot;universal&quot; model and the &quot;top post only&quot;
model.  In my universal models th top posts are a bit closer together and in
fact, too close for comfort to the Vanagon's battery hold down bracket!  I
choose to not use the bracket, insulate the bracket mounting stud and secure
the battery by fashioning some piecs of styrofoam like material placed around
the battery to prevent movement.  This method is O.K., but I'd clearly opt
for the &quot;top post only&quot; models if I were to do this again.  BTW, these &quot;top
post only&quot; models might be a bit difficult to find.  Neither place where I
bought my batteries carried them, choosing to just stock the universal model.
 These places are Four Wheel Parts Wholsalers and Car Custom, both in the LA
area in CA.  Call around.  BTW these batteries cost $130 each at both places.

Good luck,
Jim Davis
