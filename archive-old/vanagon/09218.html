 So Thom, you're gonna get a club.  Where are you gonna get the spare steering
 wheel?  The local trick is a hacksaw through the perimeter of the steering
 wheel and poof the club is off and so are they.
 
 Of course, they might just move to the next desirable split down the way if
 there is one.  A hidden switch that grounds the points works mucho better.
 Engine cranks, everything seems normal to the hotwirers but hey no spark.   
 
 Weather looks  grim for the coast this weekend, but New Years Eve in the
 Squaw Valley &quot;RV center&quot; was dandy.
 
 For a while Kraco sold a steering wheel device that clamps to the periphery
 and takes two saw cuts to get it off.  Twice as good as the club. A dormant
 cobra in the footwell could do the trick too but then we gotta remember not
 to get in on the driver side.
