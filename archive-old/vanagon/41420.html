30 to 50 is during normal charging cycles.  During short circuit conditions,
the current is only limited by the resistance of the wire the current is
pasiing through.  If the wire is large enough, a few thousnad amps could
possibly flow.  The battery will heat rapidly as it is the resistor in this
case.  Heat, sparks, hydrogen, etc.  Run for your life.  Batteries are very
dangerous when mishandled.  Remember how easy it is for a battery to pass 400
amps to start your car.
