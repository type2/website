Subject: Re: Syncro Transmissions

Hello Eric.  I haven't any trouble with the drivetrain in our '90.  
I have over 126000 km (78000 miles)  on it now with no leaks, and
I also keep my speeds down to 100 km/h (62 mph).

Harry.

&gt;    than half have had the transmission replaced or repaired. Anyone
&gt;    have some reason for these failures? I am planing on using my Syncro
&gt;    for some real work: dragging junk car out of the woods, removing
&gt;    tree stumps, some towing of stuck cars. Am I looking for
&gt;    trouble??   TO all who have a Syncro- did your trans. require work??
&gt;
