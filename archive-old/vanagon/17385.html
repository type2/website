Subject: acceleration flat spot

Hello,
Can anyone offer a suggestion as to what my next step should be to eliminate a 
flat spot just as I accelerate my '69 single cab?
 Here's the story..
Upon accelerating from any speed the engine sputters as if the accelerator pump 
is not doing it's thing ( it probably isn't). I can compensate to a degree my 
pumping the accelerator pedal but this is tough to do while turning, and I never 
have the same passenger twice. It is also definitely worse when the engine is 
warm. 
	The guy I bought the car from said I just had to bend the butterfly  
flap so the gas shoots directly through the carb. Even I knew this was dopey! 	
	I took the car to a local VW shop who did a tune up, adj valves, new 
plugs and points and set the timing. He pulled the carb off several times and 
couldn't solve the problem, even after rejetting the carb. He said my intake 
mainfolds were not heating equally and it would cost $280 to drill and  clean 
them out. I went home.
The particulars of the car are  engine# AK036268,  Solex carb 34 PICT 3.
The accelerator pump &quot;adjusting segment&quot; is adjusted as far as it will go, so I 
cant't get any more fuel per pump. I don't seem to have an altitude adjuster. 
The stem for where I think the altitude adjuster connects on the carb is 
intentionally plugged.
The car has an after market exhaust system, not like original equipment, but 
common for VWs.
So my questions;
 Does this exhaust system create a situation that can not be compenstated for 
with a stock carb? Or is the carb to blame and should be replaced? And what 
about this intake manifold situation? What would you do?
I would sure appreciate any input you folks may have.

			Thanks
