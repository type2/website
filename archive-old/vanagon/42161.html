Subject: Safaris and Antennas

Are there any list members who have splitties with Safari windows of any
type (OEM, BBI) who have the antenna mounted on the passanger side?   See
the &quot;Red 21-window front&quot; as viewed on Lee Griffiths'  Samba Server at
http://146.87.136.48/rsamba-3.jpg. (I also noticed that this bus has no
one-eyed duck either).

As I understand it, the &quot;correct&quot; mounting for the $afaris is in the middle
of the nose with a two post mount.  That is understood.
The question is: If your antenna is single mount on the side then how much
does it interfer with the operation of the window? Did you or would you
recommend the double 90 degree clooged work around or not.
I will be darned (or stronger) if I will go back to paint and body to fill
and drill in order to reposition the $1.50 antenna. I'm not trying to be a
concourse nazi in this case but trying to figure out what works and what is
bogus.

BTW: We aren't even planning on installing any radio but will retain the
block off plate and enjoy Boombox City.
