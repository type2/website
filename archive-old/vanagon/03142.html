&gt; How can you log in as root, if you are not root, and don't have the
&gt; password?  :)
&gt; 
&gt; /m
&gt; 

Easy.  simply ftp to the account, and &quot;put&quot; a clean version of .login,
.chsrc, .env, or whatever startup script your system uses.

PS. The way to disable even this kind of salvageability (sp? :-) ) is to 
change the shell in the /etc/passwd file to be some non-existent 
program.  Then even ftp won't work.  Ask me how you can salvage a 
system with everyone's login (including root) set to a non-existent
shell program, and everyone logged out.
