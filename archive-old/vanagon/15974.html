&gt;Anyone have any good/bad things to say about Interstate batteries,


Good choice Harry; I've had a couple of Interstates in the past and they
offer greater cca, serviceability, 60 mo warranty, and a pretty competitive
price.  They're not necessarily well known, but I think it's a very good
product.

That's my $0.02 worth...
