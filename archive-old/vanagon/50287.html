In a message dated 96-10-10 01:48:58 EDT, you write:

&lt;&lt; Does the air in these actually keep them cool, and can I expect 
 it to still cruise at highway speeds with it on?  
 Lastly, does anyone have any thoughts on mounting Yakima racks on a 
 Westfalia? It looks like I can either get tower extensions and use the 
 gutters, or buy &quot;fake gutter&quot; brackets to bolt to the top. Thoughts? &gt;&gt;

I have never found the a/c to adequately cool the van.I installed a dual
evaporator and larger compressor to solve the problem. I have a Yakima rack
on my Syncro with the standard 1A gutter mounts and it works fine for
canoe/sailboard etc. i had to put fake gutters on my westy for my Thule
rack..
