Subject:      15&quot; wheels and tires

any y'all know what kind of 15&quot; wheels i should get for my being renovated
Vanagon?  also, what tires should i get? BFG touring tires or performance
tires?

i really like BFGoodrich so i probably will purchase that brand but if
anyone has any suggestions to moderately sporty tires that will stick well
on straights but not on corners? (i don't really want to flip)

thanks
