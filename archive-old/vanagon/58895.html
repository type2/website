Subject: VW Stickers (con't)
From: Scott Chen &lt;mac.chen_at_ix_dot_netcom_dot_com&gt;

I managed to scrape up a few more &quot;Drivers Wanted&quot; stickers and have 
directly contacted the next four recipients.  A friend of a friend who 
works at a VW dealer  is still trying to get some more.   If I 
contacted you and you haven't received a sticker yet, please let me 
know.  Otherwise, I'll assume you got it.  Thanks-Scott
