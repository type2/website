Subject: Goofed on push rod tube question ...

&gt;So David Carment says:
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; These tubes can actually be stretched back to their original length (Muir
&gt;&gt; describes the procedure). Better yet is to buy new ones with NEW seals of
&gt;&gt; course. DC -- 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;
&gt;I think the Muir stretching method for push-rod tubes was meant only for 
&gt;the earlier Type I tubes that have the accordian type ends on them and
&gt;not for the later Type IV engine tubes that are one solid piece.
&gt;
&gt;

Hey, I said the same thing, and damnit you're right! Getting my years 
(partly) confused, since I did say the word 'O-ring'.
