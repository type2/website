Subject: Re: Found a Binz Crewcab

&gt;While coming back from Buses on the Blue Ridge I took the opportunity
&gt;to follow up on a lead on a Binz crewcab.  A friend found the bus out
&gt;in the middle on nowhere in the NC mountains where it has been parked
&gt;for the past 20 years.  Neighbors gave the name of a relative.  Relative
&gt;said owner lives in Florida now and was generally uncooperative.  I
&gt;need to do more detective work to get the owners name to rescue this
&gt;rare gem.  I believe there were only 900 made worldwide.
&gt;
&gt;I didn't get a chance to look at the vin # because wasps poured out
&gt;when I opened the passenger door.  There was also a wasp nest in the
&gt;engine compartment, so I couldn't look there either.  My guess is it
&gt;is a '57 or '58.  I was brave enough to stick my head in the rear
&gt;suicide door to get a picture of the Binz emblem on the back of the
&gt;wall behind the passenger seat.
&gt;
&gt;Later this summer I will go back for more info.  It is not going
&gt;anywhere because it has no tranny in it and has a post supporting
&gt;the dilapidated roof of the barn resting in the bed.

Dave,

What's the deal on Binz Crew Cab's as opposed to others? Was this a
retrofit in the US? I've heard of these before, but I've never understood
that there were so many. I always assumed that Binz was a dealership or
something. Inquiring minds want to know.

Thanks,

Bren
