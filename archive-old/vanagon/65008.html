Tonya,

Something maybe too obvious, but first check if the oil filter has loosened a
bit. Also check the cover for the oil pressure relief valve - it's on the
bottom corner near the filter - looks like a 1&quot;+ dia slotted screw. Use a big
screwdriver &amp; make sure it's tight. The only leak my '87 has had has been at
the bottom of the &quot;breather box&quot; - plastic &quot;can&quot; at the top right rear with a
square base with 4 bolts. However loose bolts there usually leak onto the top.
Oil pressure switches do sometimes start to leak too, and the '87 Vanagon has
2 of them - one on the lower back near the filter (below the water pump), and
one on the driver's side in the middle of the square case (between the
push-rod tubes covered by an aluminum cover attached to the exhaust manfold
bolts).

Anyway, the drip emerges just about smack center under the engine.  Not
too sure where it starts.  --watch for technical terms-- the bottom part
of the big shiny thing at the bottom of the engine (may also be known as
the main engine part) had a thin coat of oil visible on the driver's
half of it as if the drip originated above it, on the driver's side,
somewhat towards the rear of the engine.  The top of the engine was oil
free so it wasn't splattering around while driving.  From the looks of
the bottom side, it doesn't --APPEAR-- as if the oil was dripping while
the engine was running.  There isn't any oil on the bottom/back of the
bumper or anywhere else that it SEEMS it could have gone if it was
dripping while driving.  There was also no smoke involved.
