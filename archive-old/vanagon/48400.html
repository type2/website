Subject: Re: Eurovan MV???

Hi Richard,

You bet they do. I have owned one for about 15 months now and think it's the
greatest thing since the cure for toe nail fungus. It's called the EV MV
Weekender and comes with a pop-top, folding table, curtains, rear
compartment lights, rear seat bed, sliding side windows with screens, and a
small cooler beneath the mid-row passenger seat on the driver's side. The
conversion was done by Westphalia. They were only brought into this country
in '93.

They are rather hard to find since they were only imported one year and I
recall reading that only 2,500 Weekenders were shipped. They come in two
colors: white and kind of a striking aqua-green. The green ones are even
harder to find. Mine is white as are almost every other one I've seen on the
road.

It is a great van and I can't say enough good things about it. It is without
a doubt the best vehicle I've ever been in for long-distance treks.

Did I tell you I really like this car? Well, I do. They should get one. They
won't regret it.

Jeff

&gt;&gt;Howdy all. As my folks are considering adding a Eurovan to replace their
ailing
&gt;&gt;Chr*sler (They've seen the light!), they are looking at campers. However, they
&gt;&gt;really don't want all the fancy equipment. So, I was wondering if they make
&gt;&gt;Weekender Eurovans? I mean a van with a pop-top and foldout rear bed, but
&gt;&gt;without the propane stove, refrigerator, and such? Hopefully I will be going
&gt;&gt;with them to check some out in the next couple months. It should be fun, and I
&gt;&gt;love the expressions of the folks at the dealer when I drive up in my
splittie.
&gt;&gt; Anyway, thanks...
