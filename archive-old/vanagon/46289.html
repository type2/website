Subject: Gabriel shocks-report

Folks, 
Though I would just throw in my $0.02 about Gabriel shocks I installed
in September.
They give a decent ride, but they have become rusty already.  Not just
surface rust either.  By this September, they might need replacing!
I would think about going with a different shock!
