Subject: Stranded in Michigan:  Follow up


Turned out it was the starter motor.  As per suggestions, he wacked the 
solenoid with a steel bar to no avail.

His friend (who runs a shop in the states somewhere) put a rebuilt starter
motor on a plane to Traverse City, Michigan.  They airline sent it somewhere
else.  Attempt 2 mever reached the plane.  The next flight was cancelled do
to rain.  

He finally got it yesterday afternoon and 30 min. later was on his way.

Total cost has yet to be tallied, but will have to include 5 days of
being subjected to driving a rental Toyota.  

Altogether, a comedy of errors.  I wasn't able to forward the name of the 
mechanic that someone suggested to my father in time to be of use altho
the suggestion was much appreciated (and filed for reference since I am
going to the same place in my '66 Westy at the end of the month).

Thanks for all the help and suggestions.

I hope to have ZERO problems with my '66 for bragging rights:-)
