&gt; Hi everyone!
&gt; 
&gt; I just replaced the coolant, but I think I made a boo-boo... I used
&gt; Prestone rather than the VW-recommended Autobahn brand coolant...  I'm
&gt; thinking gosh... I gotta do that whole thing over again?!  I might as
&gt; well have gone to the dealer (well maybe not ;-).  
&gt; 
&gt; Question:  Anyone else not using the VW-recommended coolant?  Any
&gt; problems with not following the VW recommendation?  
 

     Have no fear! I used regular prestone about 6 years ago.
     Never had a problem. If you read the jug, They give you
     an 800# to call. This will lead you to the real problem,
     the water you mix with it! Use disstilled water and you
     won't have a problem.
