Subject: Almost traded the '90... (long)

Last Saturday I went down to &quot;The Nearest VW Dealer&quot; in the Bozobus to get
some oil filters and light bulbs for my wife's '90 GL.  As I pulled in to
the lot, I noticed that my wife had seemingly beaten me there, polished her
van and left the doors open...

It was another (2 forgotten words) burgundy metallic Vanagon, with the
reflective tape in the body groove.  It had wheel covers and not alloy
wheels, as my wife's does.  Other than that...

While I was checking it out for similarities/differences a salesman waddled
over and I told him about the striking resemblance.  Upon further
inspection I found that it was an automatic (ours is 4sp) and that the
mileage was 6806.  He didn't believe that either.  He went into the office
to check...

It's a '91, and it really has 6806 on it.  It had been set up with a
wheelchair lift in the middle-seat area by the previous owner and then just
not used very much.  The exterior is gorgeous.

I called my wife, we cleaned out the '90, got it washed (for trade-in) and
went down to the dealer to look the '91 over together.  (She's been leaning
closer to &quot;automatic&quot; ownership as the years go by...(she's always driven a
standard).)

They were asking $13,900(U.S.) but later dropped it to $12k.

Did we trade in the '90 because it needed new light bulbs and an oil change?

No.  The newer one didn't have power windows/locks or cruise control, and
I'll readily admit that I've grown spoiled by these things.  But that was
minor compared to what a close inspection of the interior revealed.  First,
a captain's chair (rotates) in the passenger spot.  Second, while working
the rotation I started to see spots...  all over...

They were the holes where the wheelchair lift had been mounted.  They were
everywhere.  The dealer had done nothing to cover them up (new carpet would
have hidden most of the evidence).  Six close-spaced holes just below the
rear &quot;dome&quot; light (and the light was dangling).  Three holes in the
vertical panel just behind the battery.  A hole under the passenger
seatbelt reel (whose cover was missing). Another hole in the floor of the
walkthrough.  The carpet behind the center seat was torn (presumably while
removing/installing the seat).  And the entire floor in the center area
&quot;bounced&quot;.  When I took a look at ours, I noticed that the material under
the carpet is a weird kind of particle board.  They'd replaced this with
1/4&quot; plywood, and not screwed that down.  Boing, boing, boing - at least an
inch (the plywood is an inch above the metal floor (warped?)).

We said &quot;no thanks&quot;, which the salesbeing accepted well, and I proceeded to
tell him what was coming to a dealership near him :-) as learned in the
various lists and the 'net.

He says they get 20-40 calls per day about the Concept 1.
He expects the Concept 1 to come in &quot;around&quot; $13k (U.S.).  (too bad, IMHO)

If anyone out there is interested in a '91 with looooow miles, it's (was?)
at Barney Garver VW, (Old Katy Rd., Houston, Texas).
