Subject: Rally EuroVan


Our recently departed 79 Convertible was to replace our 86 GTI as
both a daily driver, but also a TSD rally car. TSD stands for
TIME-SPEED-DISTANCE. In a nutshell, teams are given a set of
instructions on what route to drive, are told to drive at
certain pre-determined, legal speeds, and must arrive at
unknown points along the route called checkpoints. Arrival
at these checkpoints must be on-time, one point is deducted
for every 1/100th of a minute a team arrives either early
or late at a checkpoint. For those of you from the otehr
side of the pond, these rallies are referred to as
regularity runs.

Anyway, yesterday was sunny in the mid-fifties an ideal day
for a Sunday drive, so I went out to the EuroVan and hooked
up our TSD computer and the rest of the rally equipment,
and off my wife, Alex and I went to the local rally.

Ok, I admit a van of anysort is not exactly a perfect rally
platform...but if its all you have then you go with it.

Rather than go into the details of the event, I'll get to
the important part...we took first place overall, and 
first in class!!! Not bad for what we believe the world's
only Rally EuroVan!!
