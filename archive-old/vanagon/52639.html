My experience has been that a 'good' thermostat will last ~50k miles - you
won't really notice the degradation until you replace it;  the first time
you drive the vehicle after replacing it you'll be amazed at how much
quicker you get warmth from the heater  (I've had to replace 'em in as
little as 10k miles).
