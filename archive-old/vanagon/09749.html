Subject: Brake service

My Bentley manual has this in a &quot;caution&quot; box in 46[Brake-Mechanical
Components]:

&quot;When machining brake discs, equal amounts must be taken off each side of
disc.  Never machine one side only.&quot;

...and the wear limit is 13mm...

I'll measure them...

and for the rear:

&quot;...maximimum diameter after machining: 253mm (9.960 in.) (use oversize
linings after machining 0.5mm (0.020 in.) or more...&quot;

Nowhere does it state &quot;do not machine&quot;.

There may be a TD for this, but I'd have to ping Joel for that, and I don't
really want to hear it anyway.

'So the little red hen said &quot;I'll just have to fix those brakes myself!'
