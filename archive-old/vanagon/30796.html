Subject: Voltage Regulator Test 80 Vanagon

Can some one point me in the direction of a good voltage regulator test procedure for my 1980 Vanagon with a 2 liter engine. The Haynes book doesn't cover it 
and the Muir book discusses it but the *word picture* in my mind is not clear based on my reading and re-reading of the procedure.  I am about to purchase the 
Bentley book  which probably has the test procedure.  Until then, could some one give me a hand.

Thanks all....
