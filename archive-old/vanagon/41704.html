Have you checked the operation, wiring, etc., for the 5th injector?  This 
injector is what supplies the extra fuel needed to fire things off when 
the engine's cold.  If you pull it, close off the hole, direct the spray 
into an appropriate container, have friend crank the engine, you should 
be able to see if all's well with it.  Write if you have any questions.
