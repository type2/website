Subject: Dealers--Why don't they listen?

I should just do it myself, but I never seem to have the time anymore....

I took my Westy to VW to:
A) Replace some clamps on the cooling system which leaked
B) Replace the coolant with the &quot;blue stuff&quot; (that's what I wrote), &quot;not 
the green Quaker stuff&quot; (that's what I told them on the phone)
C) Fix that darn oil light buzzer.

Results:
A) They replaced the clamps (as far as I know--I didn't look yet)
B) They replaced the coolant with more green Quaker stuff (it's 
non-phosphate, but that's not what I asked them to do).
C) Did nothing about the oil problem (&quot;could not duplicate the 
condition&quot;). The condition only happens when the engine is cold, and you 
drive over 2,000 rpm. If you let the engine warm up completely at a 
standstill, you won't get an oil light/buzzer until you let the car sit 
for 8 more hours. The condition is completely reproducible when you 
follow the intructions I wrote on the repair ticket, (and when you don't 
start the customer's car repair until late afternoon when the customer 
needs it back that day and made an appointment two weeks in advance for 
just that purpose). So I guess they let the car warm up while doing the 
coolant stuff, and then realized that they couldn't get the oil light to 
come on.

In defense of this dealer, they have done good work for me in the past, 
and I'm not going to do anything about the coolant. It's done, it's clean 
coolant. Next year I'll just do the job myself and put Autobahn coolant 
in.

Why don't people listen, though, when you write it down in plain English, 
in detail?

Now I have to trace the oil problem myself. Anyone know how to test the 
sensors? I'm guessing that it's not a pressure problem since:
A) It started very suddenly in cold weather when I had other ground 
connection/electrical FI problems.
B) It only happens when cold, not at idle or any other time.
C) I've driven the car for 2,000 miles with it this way (I usually give 
it enough warmup time that I don't get the buzzer)
(Boy, I'm really into these A) B) C) things today, aren't I?) 

Hmmmmm. Thanks for letting me vent.
