&gt; I guess not.  At least with Bus Boys Safaris you can close them at least 10

yeah - i met someone who had their Bus Boys latches break the *first* time he
used them

don't know what he wanted safaris for in B.C., though.   they leaked new from
the factory.   the floor of my 61 (german safaris original to the bus)
attests to it.  BTW,   I am looking for a tempered windsheild.  I have one,
what i want to do is put them in next winter, and just use the safaris in the
summer.   i live in Western Wash, where it rains.   a lot.  :)
