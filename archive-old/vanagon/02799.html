speaking of air conditioners,  I see some of the semiconductor based
SOLID STATE cooling technology spilling out into the electric-operated
cooler market.  These things are nice, since they use NO compressors,
no coolant gas, no pipes.  In fact, the only mechanical parts are the
cooler fans.

I wonder  how hard it would be to line up a bunch of these units along the
cool air ducts to provide environmentally friendly air conditioning.
At the current state of technology, I would expect it to need easily above
100 amps at 12V (maybe more), but maybe someone knows more about these
little thingies...
