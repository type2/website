Subject:  Re: wiper removeal with dash in. 

&gt;That screech is caused by the wiper bearings.  You will need to replace 
&gt;them, or else the wipers will seize up and burn out your wiper motor.  I 
&gt;had this happen to my 74 in a huge rainstorm, so please take my advice.  
&gt;Fix it NOW, or you will be paying for a new wiper motor as well, which is 
&gt;very expensive.
&gt;
&gt;The bearings are located at the base of the wiper arm, where they attach 
&gt;to the body.  There is a ton of linkage underneath that, which can be 
&gt;accessed from under the dash.  You might want to consider having it done 
&gt;for you, if you don't have experience with working under or removing the 
&gt;dash(I don't, and was charged only about 3/4 hour labor, around $40 I think, 
&gt;plus parts which I bought at a junkyard).

On a 76 yo don't have to pull the dash. You do have to remove a bit of plastic
duct work. You also may invent a few words trying to reinstall that duct work.
I did!

BTW the cost of a new wiper motor is out-frigging-rageous! And although
the thing comes apart nicely and most parts are replacable, the bearing
that siezes isn't. This is also the case with the heater fan that lives
on the roof of the engine compartment. Ricken-fricken-RickenFricken $380.00
fricken dollars for a heater fan motor!_at_#$$%^!
