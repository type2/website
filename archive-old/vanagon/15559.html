Subject: Re: new van, inspect'n &amp; warrnty questions

&gt;I may be soon moving from wannabus to '86 syncro camper. I understand 
&gt;that the engine has about 20K on a rebuild and the trans has been done 
&gt;too.  I don't know what it needed or what was done.  Total miles ~= 110K.
&gt;
&gt;I have a question about extended warranties and this vehicle.  I am going
&gt;to have it inspected by a mechanic today or this weekend to check on cv
&gt;joints, water pump, heads, trans, etc.  I have the opportunity to get a
&gt;warranty called 'Flextech 1' (sp?) that would cover engine, drivetrain,
&gt;electrical, steering, AC for 18 mo.  for $1K.  In your option, is this
&gt;recommended?  How much can an inspection uncover about (un)expected and
&gt;expensive problems?  This list has warned me in the past about $$$$$ 
&gt;maintenance. 
&gt;
&gt;I'll have to pay closer attention to the syncro bits on this list. TIA for 
&gt;your advice.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
I have heard bad reviews of the VW synchro from mechanics and owners.  
Apparently the cylinder heads are flakey.
