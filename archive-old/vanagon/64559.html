Subject:      Re: aligning distributor

On a 4 cycle engine, the distributor should be inserted when the
#1 cylinder is at TDC for the *compression* stroke, i.e. valves are
closed and the fuel is in the cylinder waiting for a spark to ignite
it. It is possible to insert the distributor when the #1 cylinder is
on its evacuation stroke, i.e. the valves are open and the piston is
pushing exhaust out. This may cause a decrease in performance ;-)

An easy way to insert the distributor properly is to put the bus on a
level flat surface, like a garage floor, remove all the spark plugs (this
allows the engine to turn over easier), put the transmission in second
gear, then as you or a friend rock the bus forward, you'll see the
crankshaft pulley turn. Keep your index finger on the spark plug hole of the
#1 cylinder. You'll feel the force of the compression stroke as the
#1 piston starts its compression stroke, and if you look at the
crankshaft pulley, you'll see the timing marks come into view. Keep
rocking the bus, and on the next revolution, you'll feel the lack of
pressure on the evacuation stroke.

Line up the pulley's timing mark on the compression stroke, line up the
rotor on the distributor with the marks on the distributor lip, and insert
the distibutor.
