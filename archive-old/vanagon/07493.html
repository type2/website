I'm disappointed, as an alum of the glorious University of
Minnesota, to find the Golden Gophers so poorly represented.
C'mon Gerry!  Shake 'em up!  :)

Too, I am proud to uphold the banner of Simpson College, 
Indianola, Iowa--the first college West of the Mississippi
to admit women &amp; the only school willing to take a chance
on George Washington Carver.  Rah!  Rah!  (We say she's the
finest old school in the West/ A few may be bigger but she
is the best!/ So let's all the boosters for Simpson, Hurrah!
Hurrah!  Hurrah!)

Sorry.
