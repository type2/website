Subject: loss of power on hills

Thank you to everyone for all of the help and advice you have given us so
far, especially DHaynes.  We thought everything had been taken care of--but
now that the CV joints, waterpump, wires, transmission linkage &amp; adjustment,
locking differential, fuel odor problems, and body rubber has been fixed,
found and/or replaced--a new problem has developed:   there is a noticeable
loss of power when driving up hills.  We need to downshift to keep up our
speed.  It doesn't run rough, it doesn't smoke, and on level roads we can
maintain 65 (we may just be paranoid, but there may also be less power on the
highway also.). We know that we are talking about a VW Vanagon, but this is a
new problem, as we said, it is noticeably different from driving it when we
first bought it.  The timing is right on, it's not burning oil, it idles and
runs smoothly, just loses power on hills.
