&gt; &gt;Has anyone installed one of those Prestone cooling system flushing

&gt; DON'T DO IT!  The heat in the engine compartment is high enough to make the 
&gt; plastic T's breakup and self destruct when least wanted. This was the advice 
&gt; from many many posters in rec.autos.xxx (I can't remember which group).

A friend tells me that he installed one of the flush fittings in the 
water line underneath his '87 Vanagon.  He spliced into the line just 
inboard of the sliding door, and said it works well (no leaks in 4 years).
cheers.
