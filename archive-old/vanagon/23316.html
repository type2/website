Subject: RE: Propane

I would think that any equipment that depends upon a flame being on for its
functionality would also contain a heat-activated safety switch just in case
the flame goes out for some reason. Most newer pilot-light activated gas
appliances (gas water heaters, gas dryers, etc.) have that feature...when
you light the pilot you must wait a certain length of time for the heat-
activated switch to &quot;warm-up&quot; and allow the gas to continue flowing (your
thumb overrides this safety switch during the lighting of the pilot). If the
pilot goes out the switch cools and shuts the gas line off until you relight
the pilot. Do propane fridges have a pilot that gets lit this way?
