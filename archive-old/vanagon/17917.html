Subject: sunroof drain (?)

There's a sunroof drain?  Is there one on my '65 ucro deluxe?  Occassionally,
I do have a little moisture accumulating in weird areas after a good rain.  
Obviously, I don't have a Bently manual as this would most likely be apparant
in the body section. 

couriously,

christian
