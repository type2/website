OK, I know that I'm just looking for trouble for posting this but what's up with
&gt; the shower thing?  Now don't get me wrong - I like showers, but WE'RE CAMPING 
&gt;HERE PEOPLE!  Remember that this is California, where every other year seems to
&gt; be a drought.  What's wrong with roughing it for the weekend, conserving a 
&gt; little H20 and enjoying a nice refreshing shower when you return to 
civilization?  Besides, if the FRENCH can get away with only one shower per week
&gt; on average, can't we risk it for a couple of days?  

I'm going to stick my (dirty) neck out here and agree with Larry.  I'm fine
going for a weekend without a shower if none is available.  When they *are*
available, I like two per day.  :)
