I don't see how I made the top 10, but I guess I posted a few songs
a while back...

I may have a lead on a cheap source of exhaust systems for our Vanagons.
Near my dad's place in OH, is  a guy who has a machine-controlled pipe
bending unit.  All he has to do is punch in the car's year/model/engine
etc, and feed in some straight pipe, and it does all the bending!

My dad had to have the exhaust on a Toyolet Corolla/Nova replaced.
The dude fashioned the exhaust pipes, welded them together, and had
to weld on some new flanges as well.  He also welded up some cracks in
the headers, installed the exhaust system for $127 (parts &amp; labor).

Hopefully I'll get an answer back from my lazy father on whether or
not this guy can do Vanagon pipes.  If he can, it may be a cheap 
source...
