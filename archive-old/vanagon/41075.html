Subject: Engine Rebuild Grief...Update

Well, I have to admit I finally had to break down and bring the Bus into a
shop. It was the shop that diagnosed the dropped seat in the first place
and the guy actually came across as being a fairly honest person so what
the hell...

Well, it turns out that the DPO had fitted the wrong condensor, the timing
marks were screwed up on the pulley so I had it timed wrong, the points
were pretty badly pitted (anyone convert to elec.ignition?), and the vacuum
leak was from one of the intake boots. He fixed all of it, it runs great
now! Good power, still in the process of letting the rings seat, but it
feels pretty good.

I have mixed feelings about bringing it in. Since this was my first engine
rebuild (Ok, upper end), I thought it was not a bad idea to have my work
checked. I now have more confidence in myself since nothing MAJORLY wrong
was found. So all in all, it was a good experience and one I could NOT have
done without the help of this list. Thank you very much to everyone who
gave advice, I hope I am now in a closer position to eventually be able to
give advice to other people. Now it's brake job time!     Tom
