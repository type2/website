Subject: Re: VW-'71 BUS-QUESTION ABOUT MOUNTING BOLTS

np&gt; I bought a long block for my '71 Bus but during installation it
np&gt; became clear that the case didn't have the nut pressed into the
np&gt; upper left (as you face the engine from the rear of the Bus)
np&gt; mounting hole. With the extra ducting on the fan housing for this
np&gt; year, I can't figure out a way to get the nut on the bolt coming in
np&gt; from the front (by the clutch adjustment nut). My questions are as
np&gt; follows:
np&gt;
np&gt;    1) Is there an easier way to get the nut on the bolt that the
np&gt; usual way
np&gt;       of approaching it from the left side of the fan housing?
np&gt;
np&gt;    2) Given that I have the three other 17mm nuts securely
np&gt; tightened, plus
np&gt;       the rear mounting bar on, do I really need to get the upper
np&gt; left
np&gt;       bolt on?

        I've never used that bolt-don't think I've ever even seen one
installed. 50k miles on 2 vw's, engine hasn't fallen out yet...  I would
think that the rear engine support for '68-71 busses makes this fourth bolt
even more redundant than it normally is.

Peace,
