Subject: 83 Westy temp guage

I just bought an 83 water-cooled Westy. The water temp guage needle stays
just to the right of the warning light in the guage when I'm driving. So to
put it another way it's just above the half-way point of the guage, but still
in the &quot;safe&quot; area. I'm curious about other's experiences with this guage.
Does it seem OK to run above the halfway point or is my Westy running a
little hot. And if it's a little hot how can I solve the problem before it
becomes very hot in the near future? This is my first water-cooled VW so I'm
a little nervous anyway.

Any information will be appreciated.

Thanks
Jeff
83 Westy
