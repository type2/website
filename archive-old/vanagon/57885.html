So RGOLEN_at_umassd_dot_edu says:
&gt; 
&gt; I have shortwave radios both in my '56 beetle and my '93 Eurovan. The '56 
&gt; has the old Blaupunkt AM/FM/LW/SW tube-type radios with the large power 
&gt; converters.
&gt; 
&gt; The EV has a Becker Mexico AM/FM/SW/LW cassette unit which I bought this 
&gt; past December from RJS Direct (email RDSDRCT_at_aol_dot_com) 800-757-3728. It cost 
&gt; abut $550. According to the 1997 Passport to World Band Radio, its the only 
&gt; SW auto radio thats sold in the US.
&gt; 

How's the cassette player?
