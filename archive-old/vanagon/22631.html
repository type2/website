Subject: Re: Need Eurovan Info, Please Help.

&gt;Question #1 --
&gt;I don't remember how the other Eurovan with an automatic that I drove
&gt;felt, but the MV that I'm looking at (and really, really want) seemed
&gt;kind indecisive about which gear to use, and jerked quite a bit when
&gt;changing gears.  Could this be the reason this MV is $1,500 cheaper than
&gt;any others I have found? Is this anything normal or characteristic?
&gt;
I test drove three EV's when they first came out on the market in 1993.
All were automatics and all had the same &quot;uneasy&quot; shifting pattern.  The
exact feel of this is hard to describe.  One of the dealers did allow me to
use their courtesy van for two days over a weekend and I did get used to
the way this EV shifted.  When you accelerate hard in the sport mode
(transmission switch on dash) this van is quite quick (relatively) off the
line and shifted very nicely through all gears.  After several test drives
I felt I could get used to this transmission.  In all EV's I drove their
transmissions did seem to clank from time to time (especially when
downshifting), but I have noticied this in all cars I have driven from time
to time.

&gt;Question #2 --
&gt;Regarding the dual A/C, the air in this one felt great in the front just
&gt;like the other ones, but the rear A/C blower seemed kind weak.  Here
&gt;again I don't really have anything to compare it to.  Can the rear air be
&gt;diverted to other vents, reducing the flow?  Could it be all six roof
&gt;vents being open, that makes it seem like it dosen't blow that hard?
&gt;What are your experiences with this?
&gt;
Again referring to the test drives I made in a Eurovan the rear air worked
really well.  Sounds like a problem here.  In general I found the EV air
conditioning one of the best things about this van.

&gt;Question #3 --
&gt;What temperature do the engines usually run at?  Most the time while
&gt;driving the MV it hovered about the half-way mark. Then I let it idle for
&gt;about ten minutes in hot FL with both A/C's running.  The temp rose to
&gt;about 3/4 and stabilized.  Is that about right?
&gt;
No comment on #3, didnt notice in my test drives

&gt;Question #4 --
&gt;Has anybody had any CV Joint experiences with these things are they more
&gt;difficult to change that Vanagon CV's?
&gt;
No idea

&gt;Question #5 --
&gt;I really want to pull a 19 foot boat with this thing, does anybody have
&gt;any towing experiences with the EV, and is a stick or automatic better?
&gt;
If I remember correctly the dealer I talked with recommended the automatic
for towing. Towing capacity was something like 4400lbs, so it was pretty
decent compared to American FWD minivans on the market.  With 5 cyl engine
and a standard transmission I would think pulling a trailer up any kind of
incline especially from a dead stop could get kind of hairy.  Definitely
opt for the automatic if you want to tow.

&gt;Any responses would be greatly appreciated.  I really don't want to pour
&gt;$17,00 down the drain.
&gt;
Overall I really like the Eurovan.  I really spent a lot of time road
testing and researching info about this van.  Information at the time
(1993-94) was very limited and the automotive press was really hard on the
performance aspects of this van.  All the negative press must of really got
to me and I ended up not purchasing one.  However, I too have continued to
watch this van in the used car market and have also considered purchasing a
used one (know of two for sale with only 10,000 and 11,000 miles
respectively).  Rumors of a 1996 Eurovan with the VR6 are helping me hold
out a little longer.

&gt;Thanks,
