I'd say go electric. You can figure out pretty simply how much 'cold'
you'll get out of your battery once you read the documentation of
the fridge. Note that a deep cycle per se is not the optimal choice:
that type of battery likes to be fully charged and then fully discharged.
You'll kill it (as I did with mine) when you charge it continously 
while you drive. If you go deep cycle you need a cut-off switch that
allows to disconnect the deep-cycle from the alternater once it's fully
charged. I'll replace my toast deep-cycle with a (cheaper) regular
battery and a low-voltage cut-off switch that shuts off the complete
second circuit once the voltage drops below a certain threshold.

The problem with the gas-powered fridges is that they're a lot less
efficient and the absorber needs to be horizontal to a relatively
precise level. Otherwise the thermo-cycle will not run. Another draw-
back is that while you can simply recharge your second circuit battery
out of your &gt;14 gal gas-tank, you'll have to replenish your little
2 gal propane tank at the next RV store. From my experience I'd think
that the 2 gal tank should last you for cooking and cooling for, maybe,
a week in moderate climates, a couple of days in Texas.

In Europe you can get systems that run on 220V/12V/propane. The electric
power is used to heat the ammonia, like the propane would. That system
has the same level sensitivity, though. Jens.
