Subject: Redline:CV-2 High temp. CV grease

While buying Redline gear lube(Trans), noticed red line makes CV grease.
$8.00 a jar. I jar will probably do two joints.(also have in tubes)So when
I replace by OEM VW boots that rotted in less than 8-mons. I will replace
the old grease with this new red stuff. The dist.of redline products for
the southeast is here in B'ham they repair and Race Honda cars. They claim
the race cars were packed with the CV-2 and have never given any problems.
Of coarse they are Hondas not Vanagons, so time will tell, but the last CV
replaced by the PO only went 45-50K, not completly worn-out but the balls
were pitted and worn.
