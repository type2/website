&gt;   Doesn't the resistance of a DC motor vary with rotational speed? I remember

Yes, that's what limits the motor's top speed.

&gt; 
&gt;   Here at work they always give things with motors a &quot;locked rotor&quot; test to 
&gt;   make sure it doesn't catch fire if it's seized. I thought the extra heat was
&gt;   due to the extra current being drawn on account of the device not turning.

&gt; 
&gt;   I'd like to understand more about the operation of electric motors, so 
&gt;   someone please correct me if I am mistaken.

Nope, you're completely correct.  With the motor not turning, the 
induced &quot;counter&quot; voltage it at it's lowest so the motor is passing
it's maximum current.
