Subject: Sorry 'bout the &quot;immigrant-type&quot; comment


After seeing Cetin's parenthetical comment about &quot;immigrant types&quot;
I figured an appology was due. So to Cetin and anyone else so offended
...my humblests appologies. 

Sometimes the little frustrations of the day collide with a certain
string of posts ...and well, you know the rest!

On a positive note...Happy New year to all!
