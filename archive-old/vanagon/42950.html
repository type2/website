Just got back from the first Bus Farmers Swap Meet in Sacramento.  I feel
I made out pretty good...

I camped out with the Busfarmers (Todd, Art, Dean - Chicks Dig 'Em)
and sat around with Rich Kimball and Ed Economy (ok, enuf name 
dropping)

After a very un-sleepful night, I was up at the crack of dawn to start
scavenging.  Right of the bat I bought a '67 apron, a set of ivory-handled
popout latches and a vent box rear screen all for $5.

I also picked up an NOS RHD barndoor gas pedal, a set of German replacement
reflectors, a_set_ of '51 license plates, barndoor hoorn button, and a couple 
other trinkets.  Bought some T shirts, too. Spent a tad under $300.
There was a lot of cool stuff there; I think the swap was much better than
the Vallejo show.

I blew off the SOTO picnic in favor of some sleep.  Tonight we're camping
out at the 'rama...  I still have money to spend...
