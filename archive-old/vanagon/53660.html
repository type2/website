Subject: Re: how engine oil degrades (was: sysnthetic oils)

Hi there,

I have experience problems with my oil light and buzzer coming on while driving
my 86 Vanagon Syncro, and I've concluded that it was because I was using too
thin oil for the temperature outside.  When I use 20-40 it rarely happens.

But I am still wondering why are there two oil sensors, which I am told measure
too high as well as too low oil pressure on the engine. I can understand too low
pressure, but why would they want to warn the driver if the oil pressure is too
high?  I never understood that.  Can anyone explain it to me?

Thanks,

Charles
