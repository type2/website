So Joel Please-to-meet-you Walker says:
&gt; so, here i'm sitting, with my thumb up my ear. ;) and i thinks to myself,
&gt; &quot;self&quot;, says i to me, &quot;there seems to be an awful lot of HP people on this
&gt; list.&quot;
&gt; 
     blah - blah - blah deleted........ ;p
&gt; 
&gt; well, anyway. i thought it was kinda curious. kinda strange that there are
&gt; so many buses at stanford and ohio state and washington ... at least, buses
&gt; that have access to internet.
&gt; 
&gt; anybody that wants me to check out their company/school, lemme know. it's
&gt; very likely i missed some.

How's about a nice ascii map that shows where everyone is located.

Should be a piece-o-cake for a speed-demon typist like you Joel.  ;P
