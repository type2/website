I wouldn't think so...  If the filter is tight enough that it can catch 
the  metallic debris that would be circulating through your coolant 
(chunks over 100 microns or so just lay on the bottom not circulating) 
then I think it would cause too much resistance.  The automobile water 
pump is not the most effective pump in the world and I think you'd get 
overheating problems if you reduced the the conductivity of the coolant path.
Or on the other hand if it's not a tight enough filter to create too much 
resistance,  it wouldn't do a whole lotta good anyway, because it would 
still let the particles circulate.

Replacing your coolant every few years is a much better Idea.
IMHO
