Driving a type 2 in the winter can be quite uncomfortable. Some days, I even
had snow freeze on my windshield while I was driving. It seems that by the
time the air has travelled through the long hoses underneath the van, from the
heat exchangers to the front, it has already cooled down.

Are there any recommended solutions out there? Electric heater, insulating
the air ducts, etc.--
