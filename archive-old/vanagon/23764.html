Subject: Fuel Pump Specs...

The electronic (looks solid state and makes very little noise) fuel pump 
is intermittently conking out in my van.  I would like to replace it but 
I need to know a little about it first.  I can't find fuel pump specs in 
any of the info I have (no St. Muir I fear but that's another story) on hand.
I'm going out at lunch today (pacific time) and would like to just pick 
one up.  Any help would be muchly appreciated...
TIA 
Scott
