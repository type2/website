Subject: Rear axle nuts

This is obvious, but if you're going to use a breaker bar (and a pipe, and
another bar, and...) to take off those big 46mm nuts, it'll make a big
difference if you have someone hold the brakes, every little bit of
rigidity helps.  You could use the e-brake, but chances are it's why you
want the drums off...

Still, the first time I took my drums off, I broke two 18&quot; breaker bars
in two consecutive days (and got a really dirty look from the guy at
Sears when I cashed in on the warranty the second time, maybe I shouldn't
have said &quot;this one snapped much easier than the other&quot;).  I ended up
having to use an impact wrench.  I can't believe Muir's hammer and chisel
method would ever work.
