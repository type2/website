Subject: Re: regular vs. super

My trusty '68, whose engine is getting
closer and closer to rebuild time, seems to
run just a &quot;tetch&quot; cooler on premium--fuel
economy, power, etc. seem unaffected by using
prem. or regular.  I run premium in the '79
too, although it has no heating problems
(well, overheating.  I discovered the gas
heater was DOA this morning...) and always
seems to have plenty of power.  It's only a
dollar or so extra per tank...
