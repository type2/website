&gt; I have a '77 that I am trying to put sway bars.  I ordered Sway-A-Way bars
&gt; from The Bus Stop (Rocky Mountain Motorwerks).  In addition, I ordered the
&gt; optional stainless steel clamp set.  I am having trouble with the clamps.
&gt; The bars bolt on fine, but the clamps seem too small to go all the way
&gt; around the suspension arm and sway bar.  Has anyone else had a problem like
&gt; this.  I am probably just going to buy a new set of stock clamps becase they
&gt; will work.  Are the clamps only for pre-'67 busses or something?

 I have a '72 Transporter and when I had to replace the torsion bar on
mine, I used a couple of stainless steel hose clamps on either side
instead of the factory clamps. I can honestly say that I thought it
wouldn't work, but it did! I drive on VERY rough roads too, and the
hose clamps have still held in there...It may not be that pretty, but
if you have a couple hanging around, give it a try. You'll find that
they're quite easy to remove as well...
