Subject: Well oh ya?

To all ye unbelievers....

In my experience, every time I have put Slick 50 or similar additive in any 
engine (or tranny) of mine, (currently we're talkin' an '81 Westy and a '78 
280Z) I have noticed increased power, smoother acceleration, less noise.  What I 
have NOT noticed, contrary to the adverts, is any significant reduction in 
engine running temps.  Just going by the &quot;feel&quot; of an engine is usually good 
enough for me, and I say I like it!  So there.

So...anyone know how accurate those funny little red markings that are supposed 
to indicate when to shift are on an '81 FI'd Westy?  How religiously should I 
try not to exceed the speed in each given gear?  Again, I go by feel with this, 
so if I am doin' wrong by the Code of St. Muir, you have my permission to set me 
straight using (preferably) ancient methods of torture and interrogation....who 
knows what other sins be lurking in my heart?

Well, now that I have said the nothing I had to say, besides &quot;Hi&quot;, I shall now 
sign off.....
