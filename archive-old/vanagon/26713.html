 Not directly van related but...

 A housemate moved over here from France a couple of years ago. She
 took her driving test here and so got a British driving licence and
 bought a small (1100cc) Ford. Because she had `been here for under
 3 years', (and to a lesser extent had no driving experience) she was 
 regarded as a large insurance risk. 

 Many insurance companies refused to even quote as she wanted fully
 comprehensive insurance. Eventually she paid 1400+ pounds for one 
 years cover.

 Thats more than I paid for my bus and five years worth of TPFT 
 insurance added together.
