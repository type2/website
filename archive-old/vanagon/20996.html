Even the manuals don't agree! Perhaps the only defintive answer would be
to a) call up VW or b) take a sample of the list- even with 50 responses
the sample would be fairly accurate (95% + or - 5% points)....

BTW why would dual carb engines have different psi readings?

PS Chilton's FWIW states oil pressure should be 42 psi on all 1600 cc
engines at 2500 rpm....but does not give a temperature at which the 
reading is accurate.
