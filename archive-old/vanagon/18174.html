&gt; Terry, 
&gt; I have a catalytic converter and muffler for a 1.9 liter waterboxer.
&gt; The catalytic converter is mainly for show(blown out) but the muffler is only
&gt; six months old. $200 for the whole thing.
&gt;  
Hi Tim, 
 I think I will follow someones suggestion and have the system rewelded.
My muffler was replaced not too long ago so it is still useable.
Thanks for the suggestion. 
				Terry T.
