When doing the windex thing, if you haven't heard of this old trick try
it--use newspaper instead of rags to rub &amp; wipe.  Doesn't leave any
lint.  Old wives tale given by my mother, seems to work.  Believe old
Heloise gave original hint.

Is it Friday yet?  Aughta be!  Been a LONG week ... already ...
