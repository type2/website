He does a Porsche-6 or other big-engine transplant in his VW bus then 
drives really, REALLY fast for the rest of his stay?  

He spends 3 days whipping around the test track at the dude ranch, 
relative to him; to external observers, a week has gone by.  

C'mon, Martha, give us a TOUGH riddle!  ;-)
