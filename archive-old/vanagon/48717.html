The Inuvik Run - Fort Nelson

July 24

The group eventually arrived at Moberly Lake and we camped
together.  This was my first opportunity to meet some of the
Inuvikerrs.  I'd been feeling sort of down about missing them at
Quesnel but their arrival, concrete evidence there are others as
crazy as me, left me feeling pleased.  Several greeted me, several
did not.  In the dark I could not get all the names and faces
straight.

After meeting the group I sensed a lack of consolidarity among
them.  During only two days on the road the group appears to have
polarized into three distinct camps.  

The group does not follow typical convoy-enroute procedures, which
is to start early, travel as a unit, and to camp early.  Traveling
as a group is nothing more than common sense, allowing mutual
support should one of the vehicles have problems.  Keeping to a
schedule of early departure and arrival brings you to your
destination before the stores have closed, allows time to maintain
the vehicles, prepare meals, do laundry and so forth.  The older
members of the group seem to understand the need for these things,
the younger ones do not.  It places an unfair burden on a few.
 
I turned in about midnight.  Knowing I wouldn't be able to keep up,
I departed Moberly Lake at 0640 the next morning while the trekkies
were still asleep, expecting them to catch up to me before I reached
Fort Nelson.

Conditions were wet, cold and rainy for the first hundred miles. On
paper, Highway 29 appears to be a neat short-cut around Dawson
Creek, mile zero of the Alcan Highway.  But Highway 29 is a poor
choice if you're driving a 1965 Microbus.  The scenery as always
was marvelous despite the low cloud base and rain.  But many of the
grades found me struggling along in second gear.

At several of the scenic overlooks I took the time to set up the
tripod, allowing me to take pictures of myself and the bus against
the magnificent backdrop.  The views are indescribable.  I doubt
even a photo will serve to convey their grandeur.

Despite the grades and a quick back-track into Fort St. John to
visit a bank -- a wasted trip since I'd forgotten I was now in a
different time zone. I arrived in Fort Nelson at 1530, covering 336
miles in nine hours and fifty minutes.  Given the conditions,
that's a pretty good run since the engine-hour meter logged only
7.2 hours running time.

Not knowing where we were planning to stay and guessing the rest of
the band wouldn't arrive until after five, I refueled, performed
the necessary maintenance chores then explored the town.  There
wasn't much to see.  There is a supermarket -- 'Overwaite' that was
well stocked and busy.  They had a bakery and I loaded up with hard
rolls, having run out of bagels at Ten Mile Lake.  Hard rolls or
bagels keep better than sliced bread.

My baggage includes more than a dozen books.  Chores done, I sat
reading, monitoring the CB and periodically broadcasting &quot;Looking
for Inuvikers&quot; over CB-2.  About six P.M. the call was answered by
Ron Coyote but the rest of the convoy would not arrive for several
hours.

I won't tell you where we stayed.  It was a pit, thanks to the ill
mannered American geezers whose idea of a vacation is to drive
their sixty foot motorhome to Fort Nelson in order to watch sitcoms
on cable TV.

As before, some of the group asked to borrow tools.  I'm surprised
they are so ill-prepared.  There appears to be only two axes among
the group, mine and Jack Stafford's.  Did we publish an inventory
of recommended tools &amp; equipment?  I can't recall.  If we did not,
we should have.

(After trip comments:)

During the course of the trip I read all of the books I carried
with me and bought more along the way, giving away the ones I had
read.  Standards in my library and not given away were the Bible,
the collected works of Poe, a tome on aerodynamics I've been
hacking my way through, and Chaucer, an old friend whose tales are
the perfect compliment for our eclectic band of travelers.

Overwaite markets, instantly dubbed 'Overweight' by the trekkies,
are found throughout British Columbia, although the Safeway in Lake
Williams had a better bakery.    

My scenic photos will have to wait for another trip.  On arriving
at the Arctic Circle I discovered the leader of the film was torn -
- I had been shooting blanks.  Since the return trip followed a
different route it was not possible to re-shoot the views of the
Peace River valley. - rsh
