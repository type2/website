&lt;alternative fuels&gt;

Good points, as usual. In 1971, a friend drove a Fiat. He added an 
8-track tape player and a 6-pack cooler. The &quot;perfect&quot; car. &lt;grin&gt;

As for alternative fuels, in the late 60s, a guy converted a beetle to 
run on steam. It had better-than-normal acceleration, and no 
overheating problems. With an insulated boiler and an electric 
pre-heater, early morning warmups were minimal. With &quot;modern&quot; 
technology, he claimed excellent mileage... and he could adapt it to run 
on any fuel... including dried cow droppings.

It did look odd, though... with that 6' smoke stack sticking out.

Imagine pulling into the gas station. &quot;Well, I need 5 gallons of water, 
and a stack of used tires.&quot;
