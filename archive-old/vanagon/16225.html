David Easterwood said:

&gt;#4  If all else fails go and get a wheel puller that does exactly as
&gt;    you described above.  Mine has 3 arms that bolt onto the drum in
&gt;    the lug bolt holes.  Snap On has one in their currrent catalog.

I had to do this on my '65 years ago, and just wanted to warn you that this can
cause severe damage to brake parts if the shoes are not clear of the the inner
lip on the drum, as the shoes will attempt to come out with the drum, resulting
in bending of the shoes and the attachment points, especially the widget the
shoes sit in at the adjustment mechanism.  But then again, if this is the only
way out, that is what you got to do.

BTW, as Dave said, make sure the brakes are adjusted all the way loose.  If you
can't move the adjusters, it may be necessary to force the stars to rotate,
after liberal use of liquid wrench or WD40 through the adjustment hole, you can
tap on a screwdriver wedged against the outermost star point on the appropriate
edge to get one point of rotation at a time.  It may be tedious, but it will
save damaging stuff if you have to use a puller.
