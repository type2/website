Hi Chuck,

I use my Amateur Radio mobile setup for shortwave listening when I travel. 
I'm using a Kenwood TS50 HF Tranceiver as a general coverage receiver.  I
use a &quot;Screwdriver&quot; multiband antenna ( see
http://www.teleport_dot_com/~joeh/passage-log.html#Vantenna ). 

This antenna works great but has very narrow bandwith, so it has to be
tweaked carefully to work properly.  But, the antenna does a good job of
filtering out local AM transmitters that want to overload your receiver
front end.

I like to listen to BBC on 5975 in the evenings, and Radio New Zealand on
15115 in late afternoon.  I usually travel with the latest issue of
Monitoring Times, which has a nice hour by hour program and frequency
guide. Check out http://www.grove_dot_net/hmpgmt.html

I have serious ignition noise problems though, especially above 15 MHz. 
I've grounded the radio, and tailpipe at various spots.  This has helped,
but it's still pretty bad.  Does anyone have suggesions?

&gt; Has anyone installed an AM/FM/SW radio in their van? Any recommendations 
&gt; regarding brands, models, antennas, etc?
&gt; Thanks-
