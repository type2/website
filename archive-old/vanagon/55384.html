List...

	AVI seems to be priced a little better than GEX. Gex wants $1799. for
the 1.9 and $1999. for the 2.1. Plus there is a $600. core deposit. Im
sure there is some room for bargining
	Well that decides it. My 2.1L is still running great after 112k, but
when the inevidible occurs, I'm putting in a GTI. GEX has 1800cc 110hp,
GTI engines for $929. plus a $300. core. With that added power I hope to
get better mileage too. Now to track down the needed parts...
