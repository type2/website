Waaaaaahhhoooooo:

I'm moving to San Francisco. Gone are the cold, cold winters of Chicago. 
Gone are the hot sticky &quot;Heat Warnings&quot; of the summer. My good fortune is 
your good fortune. Ok. enough of the B.S&gt; Since I'm moving, I'm going to 
sell my middle seat out of my 84 Vanagon. It currently resides on my 
backporch under a tarp. I'm not sure what a fair price will be until I call 
VW. The color is brown and all the safety belts, etc. are in proper working 
order. If your interested please let me know. Thanks.
