RE:	Copy of: What are the aluminium bars across the rear hatch for?

&gt;I have seen some Caravelles (Vanagon in USA) including my 1984 GL with a
&gt;sort of grille across the rear windscreen. Two horizontal aluminium bars
&gt;about 2&quot; apart covering the bottom part of the windscreen.
&gt;
&gt;What are they for? Dogs? Luggage? Decoration? The PO said they were for
&gt;nothing.

What are they for?  Well they're for dogs, luggage and decoration.  :&lt;)
They have become known over the years affectionately as &quot;Jail Bars&quot;, and were
first offered on the '51 Deluxe bus, and were continued as a option all the way
up to '91.  I've seen them on a '71 &quot;clipper&quot; deluxe bus in my area (diagonal
jail bars in the right rear window) and they were standard on US '84 Vanagon
Wolfsburg Editions.  They were supposed to &quot;protect the glass&quot; but are really
only for decoration. 

Just a VW van tradition that stuck thru the years.
