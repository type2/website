I was told at VW parts counter that the large silver filter &quot;should&quot;
never need replacing.

&gt;Following Joels suggestion,I had already replaced the fuel filters.The
'85
&gt;had two filters a small square one in front of the pump and the large
one
&gt;(silver bullet) after the pump, strange because the NAPA store and
Bentley
&gt;said it uses one or the other depending on CA or nonCA? I replace both!
