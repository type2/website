Subject: Aux Heater Parts

Speaking of expensive parts, I called the VW dealer and asked what it 
would cost for the auxiliary heater and its valve.  Hold onto your 
pocketbooks, kids:  $705.00.  Wow!!

I'm DEFINITELY in the market for a used one.  If anyone has any clues 
about where one might be, I'd be very interested.  Or even a kludgy 
substitute.
