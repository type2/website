Subject: How does one hold carpet upside down?
Date: Sat, 29 Oct 1994 18:20:42 -0600 (MDT)

Hi ,
Sometime after the time which my vanagon starts moving again without
having my chevy pickup in front pulling it, I want to carpet the interior
sides and roof of my camper... (a 1982 westfalia diesel).  Has anyone
done something similar?  How do you stretch the carpet and get it to
stay up? Thanks for the help!
