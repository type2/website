&gt; -New transaxle
&gt; -4speed
&gt; -new brakes
&gt; -all new 8 ply tires
&gt; -new shocks
&gt; -new balljoints
&gt; -new carpeting
&gt; -new countertop and table
&gt; -new premium paint-factory match (blue)
&gt; -all new stainless hardware on pop top (the kind that goes up straight)
&gt; -completely sealed and waterproof
&gt; -AC
&gt; -Cruise control
&gt; -AM/FM cassette stereo
&gt; -sink
&gt; -icebox
&gt; -tinted glass
&gt; -RV hookups (water, electric)
&gt; -Over $10,000 invested.
