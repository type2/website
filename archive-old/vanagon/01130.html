&gt; I've heard the same thing...actually I've used a little (20:1, d:

For more years than I've been alive, there has been a product available in 
the U.S. by the name of &quot;Marvel Mystery Oil&quot;, which is supposed to be an 
additive for oil and gas, and is supposed to do all kinds of wonderful 
things. 

Having sniffed, felt, and all but tasted it, I'm virtually certain it's ATF. 
I can't speak as to the usefulness of it, but it appears that people have 
been buying the stuff for decades, so at the very least it probably doesn't 
make your car explode, or it wouldn't still have a following.
