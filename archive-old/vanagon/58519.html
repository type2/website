OK, this was just too easy for me to be confident that I haven't missed   
something somewhere:

I just started my search for Y370s today by dropping by my local tire   
store--Bast Tire, Waterloo, ON, probably the largest tire dealer in the   
area.  I explained the situation to him and gave him the part number.  He   
found the Y370 in his catalog.  I said &quot;No, the LT version&quot;, he flipped   
the page and there it was, the Y370 LT.  Problem is the part number   
wasn't right.  It's 33701-4050, not 37047, but he says that Canadian part   
numbers may be different.  Can anyone verify this?  Harry?

Anyways, the 33701-4050 is indeed a Y370 LT195/75 R14 8-ply Load range D   
tire.  His catalog said $158 (Can) each, but he called his distributor   
and said he can get 'em for $105 each.  Have I found them this easily?   
 Or have I missed something?
