Subject: 86 Synchro double-cab FS (not mine!)


Saw this in the local &quot;Buy &amp; Sell&quot;, and since it seems some folks on the 
'net have been looking for pick ups every now and then, thought I'd throw 
this in...

BTW, this is not my car, don't know anything about it other than what 
I've listed here, have no interest in seeing it sold, etc., etc...   Just 
thought someone migt like to know...

(It's got a right-side front quater photo ofpretty clean looking PU)

86 VW 3 door PU, 4WD, syncro 2.1L, excellent in/out,
125kms,original paint, very rare $10,900obo
phone (604) 753-0991

(That's 10,900 Canadian, so translates to, what, $7,850 US?)

That's it, FWIW
