Subject: YES!  My H2o pump is leaky!

YES!  My Vanagon has made me very happy this weekend!  I had a 
mysterious coolant leak in my 84, and was afraid I might have to do 
the heads again.  After some sleuthing I found out the leak is coming 
from the water pump and not the heads.  Want an economic relief!

Isn't it amazing how your VW can bring you such relative joy?
