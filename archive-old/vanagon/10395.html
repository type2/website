1955 Barndoor  Kombi  for sale
good restoration project.  original bus runs and drives, good 36hp motor.
Dove blue, of course, and never met the seventies.  needs new home. Please
reply to this address
The bus belongs to my daughter Clara Williams, it is in Olympia Wa. My number
here is (408)253-0257, in Olympia her number is (206)866-7240, the price is
 $4,300. It is original, has some  rocker rust, came from Idaho, and has not
been restored. My daughter is probably happy to drive it to the SF bay area.
It has 5 sixteen inch rims and working semaphores, the front floormat and the
correct bumpers are there.
