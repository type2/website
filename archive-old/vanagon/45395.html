Subject: Friendly Fires (was '71 Westy On Fire! (what went wrong?))

Hi folks,

This reminds my of my first VW encounter.  A friend drove a green '68 beater
bug which coincidentally ended up being the first car I learned standard on
(and speaking of burning that reminds me of his clutch). He drove his bug
with zest and liked to pretend it was a Porsche--at the time it looked close
enough to me.  He had &quot;installed&quot; a radio by the &quot;twisting wires together
and leaving them uninsulated method&quot;.  The radio was positioned at the end
of a long length of wires in the pouch in the bug door panel.  Every now and
then when he'd go over a certain bump he'd get some smoke and/or blow a
fuse.  His solution would be to press the exposed wires away from chassis
metal and perhaps replace a fuse or blow out a wire and continue driving.
The most inopportune occurence was when he was pumping gas and the attendant
noticed smoke from his dash.  Bug was pushed away from the pumps, fire
department came, friend somehow extinguished fire, pushed the wires back in
place and drove away.  He wasn't into doing his own maintainence back then
(in case nobody noticed), but his bug took him everywhere with few complaints.

So the moral of this story is yes, some idiots do drive VWs, and while we
fret over our preventative maintainence and dutifully replace our fuel lines
every year, there's always someone out there in a bug or bus blissfully
defying the odds and laughing in the face of physics.
