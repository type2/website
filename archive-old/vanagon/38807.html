NEVER NEVER NEVER  use synthetic oil in an engine that has less than 5,000
miles on it.  The rings will not seat and you run the risk of ruining the
bearings.
We always use Castrol 10W30 in every engine unless we are using a synthetic
oil and then our oil of choice is REDLINE.  Can't be beaten :)

Good luck!  It is always neat to see people becoming one with their VW's.
If you have any questions, feel free to call.

&gt;Hi.  I just rebuilt my '71 bug engine and am ready to fill her
&gt;up w/ oil.  I was wondering if I could get any input on what the
&gt;best kind of oil to get is.  I am thinking synthetic, but don't think
&gt;I can afford it.  Is that synthetic/natural blend any good for air
&gt;cooled engines?  If I go w/ natural, what weight should I get?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;
