For sale in Rochester, NY:

-- In local paper:

&quot;74 Westy, Solid Body, Engine runs well, but not installed, $1000 
'74 thing, body good shape, rebuildable engine&amp; many parts
(716) 533 9223&quot;

Talked to owner on phone the other day. Bus is at a house he
is currently renting out. Thing at his home in Rush, NY. Bus pops out
of 4th gear.

Drove by bus, owner not there. Surface rust in many places, including
under windshield. Looks solid under. Could only see under two sides though.
The bus is backed up tightly against a wall corner. 
Engine sits outside behind. Inside of bus full of junk so can't judge
condition. Last inspection sticker is from '89.

-- As a note on my windshield :) 

&quot;73 VW Westfalia, 1800cc dual carb, new cyl heads
new distr. Stewart Warner aux heater. Fridge and sink in great
condition. Body rough. Needs carb work. Moving and losing storage. 
$250 firm&quot;
(716) 461 0237 ask for Jack

Looked at this bus today. Jack is a philosophy student here at U of R.
Now has 82 Westy (diesel!!!!!), which took him cross country last summer. 

About the '73: Rusty under. Passenger floor rusted through. Lower
track for sliding door almost gone. Door seem to stay closed, but
can fall out in the open position. Welding work done to front
suspension. Wheels out of alignment, but not bad. Rear suspension soft.

Engine idles smoothly. Never understood what the carb problem was.
May have some valve problem, despite &quot;new&quot; (turns out 1 year old)
heads. (Strange noise from left side of engine). Exhaust looks
and smells fine. Asked about compression, but owner doesn't know.

Pop top seal and canvas ok. (This is the last year of the forward
facing poptop). Interior ok but not great.

Bus is not registered so couldn't take a test drive. Was used until
this summer. 

My opinion: Not a restoration object (too much rust), but could
be a cheap ticket to exciting adventures for a few more years,
before it completely rusts out. If somebody is interested I can
go back and check it again.
