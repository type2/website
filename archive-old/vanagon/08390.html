Hello Californians,


Just flew into the Bay Area and will stay here until the 28th. Then I'll
drive down the L.A. and possibly San Diego. Will return to Misery on
January 5th, so unfortunately will not make it to the Bulli-Treff on the 6th.

David Schwarze: maybe we can meet in S.D.? If you e-mail me your phone#,
I'll give you a call soon.

Anyone else wanna show me their VW? :-)
