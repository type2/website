I would like to subscribe to Vanagon.  My screen name is VWcrazyTim.  I
currently own a '71 Bus (non camper) that I am currently doing a full
restoration on, and some slight modifications (interior and paint, that is,
when I have to $ to get it painted).

I am so thrilled that there is some type of type 2 only *club* on the
internet!

Thanx much,

Tim :)
