Subject: Re: VW motor lifespan ? (A P

My '80 Vanagon has about 173K miles.  Original engine went about 155K 
fairly reliable miles (main problems were oil leaks and a couple of bad
lifters, and that damn accordian thermostat kept failing) until a valve
seat failed and made a minor mess inside the engine.  However, now
there is some major problem with the engine case and the car's been relegated
to the driveway, barely running, until I can attend to it.  It's been
there for about 9 months because I've been too busy with earthquake repairs
(I live in Northridge).
