&gt;That's about all I know on this at this time.  It appears that there were
&gt;lots of different radios offered at the dealer.  Does anyone else have any
&gt;information?  There appear to be two adjusting screws on the Blaupunkt Emden
&gt;III radio - one in the front and one in the back.  My unit needs a frequency
&gt;adjustment - any information before I just &quot;wing it&quot;?   Does anyone know of
&gt;a good radio repair shop?

Dean,

Great info on the Blaupunkts and Grundigs!  My '71 owners manual, like your
'68, makes no reference to the radio.  They do show a handsome picture of
the radio block off plate, though. So that output behind my radio is for
taping?  Now I have to try that out!  You'll probably get some good advice
for frequency adjustment from some of the &quot;hams&quot; on the list.  I just
thought I'd add some info I found on one of the audio newsgroups when I was
trying to track down a service manual for my Emden III.  I contacted Grundig
in California and they faxed the mother company in Germany for the
availability of a service or owners manual in German or English--but they no
longer stock them (what a surprise?!!).  A German poster on an audio
newsgroup suggested I might be able to get a manual through this company:

Schaltungsdienst Lange 
Postbox 470 653
D-12315 Berlin
Germany

Fax: +49 030 703 606 77
Voice: +49 030 703 6060


I haven't tried it yet, since there's really nothing wrong with my radio at
the moment.  I'm simply seeking out the manual as a self-imposed quest (the
Holy Grail is somewhere on my list, too).  If anyone has any more technical
or other interesting info on the SW radios installed in VWs please share!
