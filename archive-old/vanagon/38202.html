Hello all,

A friend of mine had a 77 Bus named Matilda, which had always
been the subject of my coveteousness.  He was driving her on
the interstate last week and the fan bolt broke and she overheated
pretty bad (didn't seize though).

He doesn't have any money to fix her and instead of a burial at
sea, he bequeathed her to me.  I am looking to resurrect her and
was wondering if I could get an idea of what kind of a job I'm
in for.  I know I'll have to do some kind of rebuild, but was
wondering if there are certain parts that typically go first in
an overheat.  Am I looking at just new rings, pistons and cyllinders
or is it possible that the crank and bearings are damaged?  He
got it off to the side of the road before too long, but there's
no compression now.  

Just looking to get an idea if this sounds like a major overhaul
costing major $$$ or just a handful of new parts.  If I have
to get a totally new engine, how much do they run?

Thanks,

jeffrey will
proud new bus owner
