&gt;Just to be absolutely clear: prices are in german marks. Marks used to
&gt;be quite a bit cheaper than USD ($). Don't know about current exchange
&gt;rate; depends on how well Mr Clinton and CO is doing compared to Herr
&gt;Kohl (or whoever it is now).

&gt;&gt; Hi, will do, thanks. The prices you showed were high! Scary $$$ for 
a single 
&gt;&gt; tourist. Perhaps buying a good NA model and shipping it over is 
worth it for 
&gt;&gt; the long run, especially if you were sharing/planning on annual 
visits.
