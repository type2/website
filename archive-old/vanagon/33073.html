Subject: Re: CB Radio Lights Oil Warning Lamp

A poor ground on an antenna will activate the lights, and actually the 
buzzer too, on my '87 Westy.

I use a clamp-on gutter mount antenna with the grounding set screws 
backed out to prevent paint scratches.  With the screws out, the 
lights come on.  Instead of replacing the screws I use a wad of 
aluminum foil placed between the gutter and the clamp.  Problem 
solved.
