Subject: diesel warm start ??

Hi Volks,

	I&quot;m having problems starting the 82 Diesel Vanagon when it's the 
engine is warm (after sitting about 2 hrs). It starts fine If its hot.

I don't thing the glows are working in a warm start situation...It' never fails
to start in cold weather when the glow timer light comes on in the dash.

Some times the glow light flashes on and the glow timer clicks when its warm 
but it takes several trys to start the diesel....not good for the poor old 
starter!!!! 

						thanks for all the help

							Brian
