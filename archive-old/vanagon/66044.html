Subject:      Sound system upgrade for Eurobago

Gotta Eurobago with a stock system?
Not pleased!
Hate the little rattling speaker in the rear and the cheap headunit?
So did we.

UPGRAGE:
New 6X9 for the rear.  Put them in two boxes and set them on the rear seat.
(Threw punny 3X5's out the window.)
New Headunit(radio).  This also made a great difference in clearity and power.
(Didn't think this would make much of a difference from the Sony but it did)

The front speakers in the van have pretty good sound.  They, in my opinion, do
not need to be changed.

Listen for us passing through a town near you,

Marion and Chris
1995 Eurobago
