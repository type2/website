Subject: Re: Dan H's Heater



I for one wish I had more heat control levers to play with. Even when the
top lever is all the way left, I still get some heat through the defrost
vents, I wish I could close it off completely or direct cold air through
them. I also wish I could direct hot air back through the rear vents, and
push warm air through the adjustable side dash vents, and close off foot
heat and direct all heat to the central rear vent.

I know, I know that this is all impossible without a radical redesign of
the heating/ventalashun (Alabama spelling) system.

Just venting, Alistair
