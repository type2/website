Hey now,
        Crawled under the bus last Friday AM for the usual valve
adjustment, and had a rather rude surprise. Of the 3 bolts that bolt the
case to the rear engine mount, 2 had sheared off, and the 3rd was bent-and
the case had cracked around the thread insert. I guess curb jumping ain't
such a hot idea.  :-(  Needless to say, the bug got me to work for the
weekend.

        So yesterday I did the big swap. Pulled the engines out of both,
and swapped 'em.  5 hours start to finish-bug engines are a pain to pull.
You see, the bug had a universal case, with 3 beautiful bolt holes just
waiting to be used. Since we bought the bug in Feb or so, I've felt that it
wasn't performing up to par. The swap made this very apperent. I put the
bus engine in the bug (of course, I replaced the engine compartment seals
first), took 'er out for a test drive. Let out the clutch and gave it gas
just like always-and laid rubber on the cement! So now the bug is a real
driver, and the bus is a real slug. It works out well this way however, as
I'll have more opportunity to get the bug engine shipshape in the bus, and
the wife has a zippy little reliable beetle.

        Also, this puts the upright oil cooler in the bug, which doesn't
work the engine as hard (doghouse in the bus now). Found a vacuum leak on
the bug engine too, this may explain part of the running hot problems I've
been having with it.

Peace,
