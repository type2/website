Subject: Re[2]: Value of '87 Syncro Westfalia

     Brad,

     I agree that it is high (more than I paid for my 90 with 13,000 less
     miles) , but not twice what it should be. Here is one approach that
     Mark could consider:

     If I am correct, it is a Westfalia GL, not just a GL, so what is the
     premium for a Westie? Edmunds shows an 87 Camper GL is worth
     $2775 more than a GL.

     Then there is the Syncro premium. The Blue Books say its worth
     something like a $500 premium, I suspect the market will pay more.

     Also, we have to consider a premium for having both in the same
     package...its worth something in the eye of the buyer who will settle
     for nothing less than a Syncro Westie, because Westies are harder to
     find than Vans, and Syncros are even harder. Both together is, IMHO,
     the ultimate late model van. This is much less tangible...

     Edmunds, for what it is worth, says with a mileage adjustment
     this car is worth, retail (i.e. asking) $9645.  I paid 7% over Edmunds
     retail price for my 90, and think I got a good deal. So figure 10%
     over Edmunds as a reasonable deal- so I would come up with something
     like $10,600.

     Now, FWIW,  if I could have picked up a 87 with these miles
     for that price, I would have grabbed it...

&gt;I looked at an '87 Westfalia today, Syncro, very nice, 67K miles. It's a GL
&gt;with locking rear differential and no other options as far as I could tell.
&gt;The owner is asking $17,500. Is this a reasonable price? I know these are
&gt;pretty rare, but do they really go for this much?

Let me know where I can get that much for an '87 Synrco GL!!!  I'll take mine
(that I paid $6995 for) sell it and take the profit and get a Syncro Westy
for the $17,500!!

That price is about twice what it's worth.
