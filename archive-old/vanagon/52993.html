Subject: Re: Increase in performance??

hm...without looking, i quickly assumne it is the magnet that surrounds 
the fuel line..


now..i remember this being brought up in &quot;Midnight Engineering&quot; 
Maginzine...oh, last year or so...unfortunetly, i cant grab the issue, 
since its in GA, and i'm in MO..but, i'll pull from memory what it dcoverd..

Basicly it said that, yes, it can do this, due to a: pulling soem of the 
crap out of the fuel, and two, the e-mag fields  do something to align 
the hydrocarbons, but it only does that when its built properly...some of 
thse items are, some arnt..

it proceeded to list how to properly build one..well, not a howto, just 
the data...i wrote it down in my blakbook...lets see if its still there..

nope...not there..:( but, i may be able to get my borother to look it up 
for lme...

i'll keep ya posted....david
