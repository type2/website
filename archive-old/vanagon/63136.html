Subject:      Windshield wiper shaft

To those who expressed sympathy for having to remove the dash to replace the
broken windshield wiper shaft (driver's side). It appears that by removing
the instrument cluster I should have plenty of room to work on it. I will
post an update if this doesn't work, I am waiting for the shaft to come in
($37!!!).
