Subject: Aux. Battery Isolator Relay

I am in the process of installing an auxillary battery. I have read all I
can find in the archives, but still have some confusion on how to hook up
the isolator relay. The relay I purchased has four terminals but the
diagram shows one switching terminal goes to ground and one to the ignition
switch. I had read in the archives that I could jump terminals 85 and 86 of
the refrigerator relay to the switching terminals of the new cut off relay,
but this seems to differ from the wiring diagram that came with the relay.
Should I connect the ground terminal to ground or to termnial 86 of the
refrigerator relay (which I believe goes to the alternator)?
