&gt; &gt; Last i talked to everyone i was trying to sell my syncro.  We'll i just
&gt; &gt; couldn't do it!!  My wife is pissed, but i think she knows things would be
&gt; &gt; worse if i got rid of it.  My problem is that i'm due for emissions in
&gt; &gt; connecticut in a couple of weeks.  (connecticut has gotten really severe
&gt; &gt; concerning emissions). Last time thru i failed terribly and had to get
&gt; &gt; waived.  Of course this is after spending some big bucks and it still failed.
&gt; &gt; The dealer is no help, he said they all fail.

&gt; Perhaps you could put on a fuel pressure regulator and reduce the fuel
&gt; pressure?  That should make it run leaner.  Anyone on the list have any
&gt; thoughts about that?  It might help if you posted your emissions
&gt; results to the list, so we could all see how it failed.
&gt; 

I second that (check the pressure at the rail to see if it is within specs).

Also, if the system has a coolant temp sensor (I sure it does), check it
out. It riches the mixture when cold and as the coolant warms up the
sensor's resistance changes and the computer backs off on the enrichment.
So a quick fix without tech data is to measure the resistance when cold
and then when engine at operating temp. I'll guess and say there should be
a 10 fold drop in resistance, well it should change significantly :)

nb. if there is no coolant temp sensor there must be an oil temp sensor.
there has to be a way to tell the computer that its cold outside.

check all electrical connections, use contact cleaner (careful that its
not the type that detroys plastic)

check for any vacuum leaks

does the fuel systme have a Wide Open Throttle switch? could this be faulty?


Any more ideas out there in vacuum land?
