&gt; 
&gt; An open letter to all out-of-area vantypes.
&gt; 
&gt; As an extension of the mail thread on hosting the van migration...
&gt; 
&gt; Please consider this an open invite from Althea (the bus) and I
&gt; to any vanagon-list members who might roll through the Santa Clara
&gt; vally area (aka Silicon Valley).
&gt; 
&gt; Give us a ring (or an e-mail) and we will be happy to roll out the
&gt; red rug for you-alls -- ahhh what's the plural of you-all, anyway?
&gt; 
&gt; Keep on roll'n
&gt;
