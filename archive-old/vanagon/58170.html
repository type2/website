Subject: Brain Dead '87

All,

Someone out there replied that they had a brain for my '87.  Since then
 someone - wife, kid, dog - accidentally erased a few files, yours being one
of them.  Please drop me a line so I can make arrangements to get the unit
from you.

Please reply direct - ThatVWGuy_at_AOL_dot_com

Thanks,
Dan
