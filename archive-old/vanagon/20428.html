&gt;It takes a long time.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Does it go bad faster once you open the container?
&gt;
&gt;Yes, the shelf life  of a sealed PB container is several years,
&gt;but I'll bet it drops way off once opened
&gt;
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Should I eat the peanut butter or throw it out?
&gt;
&gt;Open it up and see if it looks weird.  If it looks fine, see if 
&gt;it smells weird.  If it smells fine, try just a little bit.
&gt;Rotten peanuts can produce a deadly toxin, but it should be obvious
&gt;if they've gone off.

It should be REALLY obvious that they're &quot;gone off&quot; when you're not alive to
try the second bite!
