&gt;&gt; Hi: My 86 has just developed the same problem. I havn't had a chance =
to take it apart and
&gt;&gt;check it out yet. If anyone has any thoughts on this subject please =
share them with me also.

A similar problem here; the top lever is stuck in the defrost position.
The cable isn't broken, but the lubricant inside the cable housing is =
toast.
Has anyone freed up a sticky cable with WD-40 or something.  Maybe that's=
 not
the right lubricant to use on the cables, but what is?  Advice =
appreciated.
