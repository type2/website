To Rex and the List -

Well, it's 4:45AM on a Sunday morn here in Redding.  As posted by Rex,
the 84 Westy just died about 50 miles north of Klamath Falls.  Since I do
carry a large assortment of tools, multimeters and spare parts, I've
narrowed it down to either the AFM/Air Box or the ECU (which I haven't
been carrying as spares - I will now).  It's just too tough of a call at
this moment, so I'm heading back to Klamath with a riding/driving buddy
where the Westy is on Tuesday with both in hand, just in case.

Symptoms (Remember, this is Digijet Watercooled, which is similar to the
AFC Air Cooled, so it may bore you on type 2, but I am CC'ing this to V_at_G
as well):

Pulled into the rest stop just before Klamath and as I was parking, the
engine just died, no warning.  Turned the key, a little hard to start,
but it finally caught after the 3rd try.  Get into Klamath, get gas, get
going, no problems.  22 miles outa Klamath, couple hiccup/misses and the
thing just dies again - coasted into a &quot;EAT&quot; parking lot.  Won't start
after 5 tries.  OK, unload the display cases in the back (not as
difficult to do as it may sound - I have a method to the madness of
packing stuff) and proceed to check each and every connection.  AFM
connector looks loose, fix that, but still no start.  Playing on a hunch,
unplug the Idle Stabilizer Box and bypass by connecting the 2 connectors
together.  Aaaah, it starts.  OK, I can run without it (I did on my 80
Calif Model for over 2 years).  Load everything back up and I'm on my
way.

28 miles later, does the same thing again.  OK, it's about midnight,
screw this crap, we're gonna get some shut eye at the wide clearing in
the road I coast into and tackle it in the daylight.  Get up the morn,
still won't start, so I unload the beast again and with Bentley and Auto
Multitester in hand completely test the harness.  Checks out A-OK.  Pop
the connection to the AFM and test the AFM according to Bentley and find
that terminals 3 &amp; 4 show 740 ohms instead of the specified &quot;approximate&quot;
560 ohms.  Pop the top of the AFM - looks pretty clean inside, no carbon
tracking (it's the original, never replaced), so I can't make a judgement
call on that alone, but resistance is high at 740 ohms anyway.  Know a
few tricks about checking terminal values on ECU's, but the readings are
so sporadic that I can't make even a shade tree mechanic's opinion (2nd
owner had it replaced in 1992 or about 17,000 miles ago at VW according
to the receipt).  Connector is real clean - no corrosion on connector or
ECU.  Could be that a circuit in the ECU is overheating and shutting the
whole works down, but it's pure speculation my part (that's why I'm
taking both an ECU and AFM back to Klamath with me).  I even re-connected
the idle stabilizer - no difference.

Checked the coil, ignition module, harness and hall sender - everything's
within spec.

When I do turn it over, it acts like wants to catch every once in a
while.

Well, we're not making it to Yakima this weekend.  AAA tows me back to
Klamath (not a gas station, but a contract towing outfit purely for AAA)
and stores it in their building, not outside in the lot at no extra
charge for the next couple of days (appreciate that) (even with AAA Plus,
it would have cost me about $560 to tow back to Redding [the free ride
would have ran out at Weed]) and caught a Greyhound back.  I'll bring it
home on Tuesday, come hell or high water.

Rex, sorry about not giving you the Cell #, I totally forgot to - won't
forget next time.  Thanks for your suggestions and what help you could
give and spreading it to the T2 List. (Anybody from either List live in
or near Klamath?)

Anybody have knowledgeable opinions, either from T2 or V_at_G?  When I
installed the engine 8000 miles ago just about everything FI except the
harness, ECU and AFM was replaced/rebuilt, etc.  It's just like someone
turned the juice off right in the middle of running.  Similar thing
happened with my 80 Wanagon and that proved to be the AFM connector in
that case.  See, I said it was getting scary that the Westy was running
so great since the engine replacement - jinx'd it, didn't I?  Breadloaf
carburetion sure makes a strong argument here, right?  If SB42 passes,
I'm looking for a 71 for the show circuit.

OK, time to hit the sack, it's after 5AM - see everyone later in the day.

&gt;Jim called me from his car phone today
&gt;at noon.  He was about to be towed a few miles south, back to Klamath
&gt;Falls
&gt;OR.  AAA was going to do it.  From there he was going to try to get
&gt;parts
&gt;or a bus ride back to
&gt;Redding CA.  I didnt get his cell number.  If anybody lives close by,
&gt;perhaps you could call and find out who the tripleA tow co/gas station
&gt;is.
&gt;His '84 Poptop westy will be sitting there, maybe he's is still in it,
&gt;trying to figure out a plan.  His business phone rings at his home,
&gt;call
&gt;him to see if he found  way down south.
&gt;I wish I could tell you more, that's all I know.
