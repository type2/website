Subject: Ignition Switch Replacement

I wonder if anyone has replaced their ignition switch.  I checked the 
Bentley, but the informaqtion is somewhat vague:  &quot;to remove&quot;, it notes 
&quot;first remove steering column lock, then unscrew clamping bolt.&quot;  My 
question:  what is the steering column lock - is this the lock cylinder 
or the steering lock housing?

Perhaps the newer Bentley's have a clearer description, my manual is the 
same year as the van - '84.  Any assistance is appreciated.

Fred
