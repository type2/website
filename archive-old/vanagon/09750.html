Subject: Winter/Rain windshield trea

Since I haven't seen this product mentioned (yet), I thought I'd toss it
out...who knows, it might even save some people some grief...


Rain-X

I'm sure many of you may already use this product (or one similar to it),
but I really like it because it causes water to bead and roll off the 
windshield, thereby reducing the number of trance-inducing trips your
wipers need to make across your windshield.  At freeway speeds, you may
not even have to use your wipers!

I think this product would also be of benefit to the folks out there
with marginal wiper motors/blades, as this would at least give you a 
chance to see out your window...

Anyway, with the recent storms here in Cal., at least I can see them ol'
raindrops fall.
