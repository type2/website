&gt;
&gt;&gt; While there was agreement to meet at Ron Salmon's outpost Sunday at
&gt;&gt; 1PM, but I remember hearing somewhere (Type 2 Chat Group?) that Ron is
&gt;&gt; not going to be there. Ron, can you confirm, yes or no? 
&gt;
&gt;No, I can't go, very much to my disappointment.  I'm a solid week behind in
&gt;responding to e-mailed price quote requests, and really need the long
&gt;weekend to catch up.  (I am sending orders out on time, though - if you're
&gt;lucky enough to get a price quote! :)  If you need a quote fast, by the
&gt;way, better to call me for now, at (610) 754-VWVW.
&gt;
&gt;I will be set up at Maple Grove, though, on June 8 (practically in my
&gt;backyard) and would LOVE to volunteer as the List meeting place for that
&gt;show; it would give me a chance to meet some of you who are only faceless
&gt;e-mail addresses to me at this point.  I will either have my blue '89 Westy
&gt;at my swapmeet spot, or my spray-can painted/primered/multi-colored '63
&gt;Deluxe, and I will have the Bus Depot sign up. I'm planning on getting
&gt;there early, so I hope to be fairly close to the main gate.  For those of
&gt;you relatively close to southeastern/central Pa., the Maple Grove show is a
&gt;fantastic show, getting very close to the size of the Manassas show and
&gt;with a great swap meet area.  Maple Grove, Manassas, and (I'm told)
&gt;Litchfield, CT are the largest east-coast VW shows of the season.
