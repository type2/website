     Well, I guess we're the first to make it back and to a computer.  The trip 
was highlighted by cold weather and a fair bit of wind, but the sun was shining 
all 3 days.  When Alice and I arrived (with Michael (9) and Julia (7) in tow) 
around 12:30 PM on Friday in our '81 eggnog, we were greeted by Bradly Prunehead
and Steve Johnson.  Each of them had a rather hefty bottle in hand, and it 
appeared from the joviality that it was not the first round.  Martha was 
apparently already there as well since there were shower fixings all about, and 
an eggnog '81 to match.  However, the wind was whipping and no one was visible 
so we walked back to the ranger station to reserve a spot.  After returning to 
the campsite, Jack Stafford pulled up in a slick Orange Breadloaf, complete with
Westy tent.  David Schwarze followed in his blue Safari camper, and Scott Harvey
then appeared in what was to be the third '81 eggnog, and (no offence Martha) 
the best looking of the 3.  People continued to trickle in as the day wore on, 
from the bay area and from Arizona.  The prize for longest voyage (at around 600
miles from Tuscon) went to Dave Phillips.  Dave, I hope the drive is going well,
wherever you are.
     Friday night, we hiked up the ridge above the campground as the sun was 
setting and got a beautiful panoramic view of a time warped VW showroom, 
complete with transporters, breadloaves, aircooled and watercooled vanagons.  
Alas, no Eurovans made it.
     I'll leave a few of the juicy details of the trip for others to fill in, 
but a few of the highlights of our trip were visits to Fossil Falls (a geologic 
oddity carved by water and volcanic lava flow), a trip to Randsburg to the 
history museum the and a 4WD road adventure (we don't need no steenkin syncros) 
to the &quot;Famous Burro Schmidt Tunnel&quot; (one guy by himself carved a 1/2 mile 
tunnel through a mountain by hand over 38 years-no one could tell us why!).  
Most of the gang went on Saturday while we visited the falls.  There were some 
good stories of courageous and foolhardy offroading that others must fill in.  
Alice, the kids and I made the trip to the tunnel on Sunday since we had a 
relatively short ride home.  We got slightly lost but so did everyone I guess.  
The maps were lousy.
     Other highlights which need further discussion include Martha's mysterious 
early disappearance, David Schwarze backing his van into a post while trying to 
&quot;circle the wagons&quot;, the ceremonial burning of a motherboard on the campfire 
(really cool blue-green flame and noxious fumes), a hearty breakfast of danishes
with Dave Kautz and family, Sam and Susie's hidden musical talents, why Bradley 
fed Scott's dog Calvin a prunedrop (with the wrapper still on it), and last but 
not least, why David wishes he could &quot;kick like a girl&quot;.  I'll say no more.
