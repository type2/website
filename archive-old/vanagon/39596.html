Subject: Source for Dansk exhaust?



 ----------
Where can I get these pipes?  Do they also have the unique front header pipe 
for the syncro?

Thanks,

relax and spin
87 syncro

|Dansk aftermarket exhaust:
|Dennis mentioned to be sure and get the support brackets when using
|the aftermarket.  the Dansk system i just put on mine (complete from
|header to converter) had all the necessary brackets already included
|and had an additional brace welded on that the OEM doesn't have.
|great system.  good price.
