You asked for iceskating anecdotes; we have only had our Vanagon for six
months but are looking forward to the first snowfall. 

This  may not count anecdote-wise but it was memorable...
my father and I once did a complete unscathed 360 degree rotation driving
down a three lane highway during a blinding November winter storm
at 60 mph (it was a Peugeot 405) . What made it really exciting was that
at the 180 degree point the back of the car (now facing and moving
forward) bounced off the the back of the bus in front of us. This provided
enough impetus to keep us on our rotation and then come back on  line.
While all around us cars were piling up in the ditches because of the
snowfall we never deviated from our lane and continued on to our
destination (standard 401 driving BTW).


I can hardly wait for the snow to fall.....DC
