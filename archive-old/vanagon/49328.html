Subject: Re: Dogs on CCC's Mammoth Trip
From: Mark &amp; Kath &lt;markath_at_qnet_dot_com&gt;

&gt;I just consulted my guide book on where to take dogs in CA, and it indicates
&gt;that Inyo National Forest is fine for dogs as long as they are on a leash
&gt;while in the campground and on the trails. When out of the campground they 
&gt;can
&gt;run to their hearts content. Hope this is accurate information.

You are partially correct. On *this* Forest, doggies have to be on 
leashes in developed areas and are free to run wild on trails in the 
front country as well as the backcountry. But - when I take Bianca into 
the backcountry she is free to romp as long as we are alone... but as 
soon as we encounter other people, she goes on a leash - One never 
knows who the dog haters are - and I, for one, don't want to get into 
it with them.
