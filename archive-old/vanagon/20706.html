Try it, you'll like it.  (only a few have expressed dislike after using 
the EV for a while)

&gt; What would you recommend to me and why?
&gt; 
&gt; - buying a new Eurovan with Weekender equipment?
&gt; - buying a new Eurovan with some other camper equipment?
&gt; - buying an used Vanagon with Westfalia?

How seriously would you be 'camping'?  THe EV MV with the table and 
foldout bed is enough for my current needs but wouldn't be suitable for a 
rolling vacation with no hotel stays.  There is a 'cooler in a seat' 
available for the MV.  The new US EV camper conversions are done by 
Winnebago.  Don't have enough experience with them to have an opinion.  
Don't have Vanagon experience either - YEARS and YEARS in a '72 Westy though.
I think my EV is among the best vehicles available at all.  Only wish it 
was more available.  Unfortunately availabilty will play into your decision.
If you can find a used EV with Westy (not Winne) equipment it would 
probably be your best  bet with what I know from your post.

&gt; BTW, I am not a handy person and do not know much about fixing cars.
&gt; Almost all of the repairs would have to go to a professional.

Might be a good reason to get as new a vehicle as you can.  Usually the 
newer the less problems for the mechanically challenged.
