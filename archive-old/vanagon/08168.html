Last year, on our honeymoon in Taos, NM, we pumped a full tank of badly
contaminated gas (dirt and water) at a Chevron station. I had no clue what
was wrong when, 50 miles later, the Fun-mobile started to lurch and
overheat. But we made it to Tucumcari, where we finally found a mechanic
who spent 2 1/2 hours figuring out and finally fixing the problem. It cost
us $110, including 2 bottles of injector cleaner and 2 new filters
(one for the road). 

Later, I complained to Chevron and sent them copies of my receipts.
Although they claimed to have checked the gas station in Taos without
finding any evidence of contamination, they reimbursed us for our expenses
as a sign of good faith. That's when I almost regretted not having VW
replace the whole gas tank...&lt;wink wink nudge nudge ...&gt;
