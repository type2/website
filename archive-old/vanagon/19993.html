Subject: Re: Paradox /[f]:)


&gt; Dear Vanagon Gang,
&gt; I'd just like to announce that due to the fact that my wife just successfully
&gt; defended her thesis, we are now the Dr. and Drs. Hutton, physicists
&gt; unemployed!
&gt; That's a paradox, I think.
&gt; Stuart Hutton


Must be dissertation!!!   
Well, Dr. Hutton(s). I bet both of you could now design a better VW engine!
