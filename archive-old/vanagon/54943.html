Subject: Re: Roof rack.....

&gt;I have a roofrack originally installed on my old '67 split that I now use on
&gt;my Vanagon.  I measured the distance between the rain gutters on each side of
&gt;the roof at the places where the rack sits.  I put the rack on the garage
&gt;floor and marked the distance that I needed to stretch the rack legs.  I used
&gt;the torch to heat up each leg and pulled it out half the distance on each
&gt;side.  The split 1/2 length rack looks great sitting on the roof of my
&gt;Vanagon.

Don't even tell me this was a wood slat rack.....or there could be some
bloodshed...
