Subject: Re: Help! '80 Vanagon info!

&gt;In a message dated 96-02-02 04:07:01 EST, you write:
&gt;
&gt;&gt;says engine was
&gt;&gt;rebuilt 5000k ago,
&gt;
&gt;Wow!  an engine that lasted 5 million miles!  That's terrific!  What's your
&gt;secret?

        Yeah, right. I went over there yesterday with my friend, checked
out the Vanagon. 5k rebuild my ass. I suspect the girl selling it was taken
in by whoever she bought it from, probably turned the odom. over, then said
&quot;look, just rebulit the engine&quot;. Compression readings were as follows:
CYLINDER        POUNDS
1               90
2               110
3               60  (!!!)
4               130

        Ran a wet on #3, it popped up to 120. Didn't bother with wets on
the others, it was late &amp; I was cold. Don't think he's gonna buy it, but if
he does, at least he knows he needs a new engine. My good deed for the
week.

Peace,
