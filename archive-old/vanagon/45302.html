So Elkavitch, Michael and Diana says:
&gt; 
&gt; Can't wait!!! Now, I went to set the time on my digital clock, the one in
&gt; the middle of the dash cluster. I obviously pushed too hard on the little
&gt; button because now my hours keep blinking and I can't turn them off! Any
&gt; ideas? 

Along this same thread, I too have a similar problem.  When I push in the
minute button, nothing happens.  Plus over the past year or so, the LC is
all slowly turning black.  Must be something warm in the lower section
because that is where it has turned black and is slowly creeping upward.
It's this way with the key on or off so it must be part of the clock
circuit or the wires feeding to it.  Any suggestions?

Thanks,
