Subject: Hearses?

&gt;Subject: re: Hearses? fwd from usenet

&gt;There is a picture in the NEATO 1996 calender with a
&gt;converted hearse in it.

*That's* where I saw the glossy.  NEATO's OBR had B&amp;W photos
of the hearse last year, but I could not remember where I
saw the glossy.  Great calendar, BTW.

&gt; They call it a 62 &quot;Frickinger&quot; Hearse.  It looks like it
&gt;was made out of a double cab pick up.  There is one cargo
&gt;door behind the passenger door (we're looking from the front
&gt;to the right), behind it is one long window.  The air vents
&gt;are down low like in a double cab.  I think I can see a seam
&gt;across the roof where it was extended back.

I'm sure the OBR article provided more detail.  Someone
reminded me offlist (michael?) about the Old Bus Review
article but I haven't looked back to see for sure.  I can
provide a synopsis of the article this evening if anyone
is interested.

&gt;&quot;Their
&gt;neighborhood undertaker provided the suitable oak coffin!&quot;
&gt;I wonder what the owners are like....

How do you say Addams in German?
