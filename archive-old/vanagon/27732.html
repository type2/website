&gt;Someone more in the know can tell you why, but it has to do with the
&gt;wave form.

 I heard a rumor that microwav ovens release their cooking energy (radio
waves, actually, at 2450 MHz) in short, fast bursts or pulses. The peak
power in the middle of a burst, may exceed the continuous-power rating,
and make your inverter unhappy for a few milliseconds at a time. A well-
filtered power supply in the microwave might smooth this out to where
the inverter only sees a smooth demand for the 600W of continuous power,
but most smaller (i.e. cheaper) microwaves may not have much filtering
built in. In that case, the inverter might see a 0 demand for a few
milliseconds, then a 1500W demand or so for a few milliseconds, then a
zero demand, etc. This would probably freak it out a little.

Anyone here know about the typical waveforms used by microwaves ovens?
