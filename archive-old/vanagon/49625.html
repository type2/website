Subject: 5spd trans &amp; syncro panel van



Today while downtown talking to the printers I played hooky and checked 
in at &quot;Tom Cat auto wreckers downtown branch&quot; and discovered that they 
have a 5spd vanagon transmission &quot;core&quot; for sale. supposedly has a 
stripped 5th gear, price around $300 Can. I would love to have it but 
can't afford the rebuild right now. The  phone number is (604) 474 0489.

Right next door to Tom Cat is Ellice automotive, a long established VW 
repair joint. They had a caramel brown syncro panel van up on the hoist 
for a trans rebuild. That was a first for me.
