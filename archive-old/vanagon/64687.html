Bob and Listmembers,

I used Red Line in my Triumph and was pleased with the improvement in
the shifting smoothness.  I just had my Syncro transmission rebuilt, and
the mechanic felt that Red Line was mostly hype and didn't recommend
it.  (That was Jeff Mullis).  I sort wish I had tried it, even at the
premium price.
