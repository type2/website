Subject: optimal warm-up time

	Martha,
	Your Vanagon camper doesn't need the 'warm-up' like a carbureted
vehicle from the 40s or 50s- Once you've got oil pressure, the best
way to warm it up is to drive, but keep the RPMs below 3000. When the
oil is 180F or above, you can use full revs.
	Sitting at idle isn't, per-se, bad for a modern engine, but
it isn't good either. It doesn't really warm much until its used. Better
to put a moderate load on the engine and get it warmed up quickly than
sit sloshing cold oil around.

	IMHO, natch.

	Pete Sellers,
	I saw three, nyah nyah! 
	Next time you're in the bay area, give me a call and we
can go visit my friends Ken and Charlotte who have a Eurovan.

	Chris Bridge,
	Congradulations on your rebuild!! 140 145 140 145 are excellent
numbers- sounds like your pressure guauge is reading slightly high, or
you wound up with greater-than-stock compression. If the latter is true,
don't burn cheap gas! But heck, don't burn cheap gas in your masterpiece
anyway!

	wiebek,
	My recollections of the Silverdale/Bremerton Washington area are 
that a non-local would think its still WINTER in April- presumably the 
meet is being put on by a non-local...
