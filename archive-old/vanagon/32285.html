Subject: MSRP prices for 1989 Vanagons wanted - repost

I sent this out last week and didn't get a single response.  Come on, I know
there are 10 of you '89 owners out there.  Please dig out your old window
stickers and give me a little help here.

&gt;Vanatics,
&gt;I am compiling a Model Year Summary for USA Vanagons for 1989 and would like
&gt;to inlcude the MSRP for the vans and all of the options.  If anyone has an
&gt;original window sticker or other reliable price data, I'd love to hear from
&gt;you.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
