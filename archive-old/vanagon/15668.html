Subject: more on bodega

In response to what nrubin_at_s1.csuhayward_dot_edu (Martha Rubin) wrote regarding
the Bodega Dunes campground:

&gt;            At any rate, it looks to be about a half mile north
&gt;of Bodega Bay, and with luck VERY near the beach.  I'm going to
&gt;check it out further and report back to you.

The Dunes campground is not on the beach. The beach is about a mile
walk/drive away. Still, the campground is large enough for a group
get-together and does have good facilities. A couple of miles north is
Wrights Beach that is on the beach but would not be large enough for a
group.

No sure if we can make it but I've marked the calendar. First time we ever
used a Westfalia camper was along the north coast in my brother's VW.
