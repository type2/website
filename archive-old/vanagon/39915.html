Subject:  re: vanagon crossover pipe

my brother purchased an aftermarket exhaust system from the heat
exchangers back for his 82 (non-ca model) cause his crossover pipe
was shot. he got the setup somewhere in the los angeles area, i'll call
him tonight, find out, and post tomorrow if he has the info.
