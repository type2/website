Subject: Re: Wanted: Eurovan (Portland, OR)

Mike asks:

&gt;What's the HP rating on those and how much does the van weigh?

HP - 109 _at_ 4,500 RPM
Torque - 140 _at_ 2,200 RPM &lt;- note gobs of torque starting at the low end

I don't have the exact weight figures, but I remember the EV weighing
about 400 lbs more than a Vanagon.
