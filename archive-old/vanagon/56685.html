Subject: NEEDED Used '87 Sliding Door Handle (outside)

According to the Weakly Statz there are more '87's out there than any other
year. SURELY someone has one that can spare it's outside sliding door
handle? If not, somebody refer me to a &quot;reputable&quot; dismantler, and I'll try
that route. Not the one on Hwy 51 near Ohio, they had 5 vanagons, mostly
stripped, naturally no handle. And NOT that one up north I got misquoted,
mishandled, and misparted on.
Is there one in Kentucky or Tennessee or some such place that has a real
good rep?

Thanks,
====&gt;James
