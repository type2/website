Subject: directions to Pelican Inn 10/22 evening


The Pelican Inn is at Muir Beach.  Phone is:  415.383.6000.
As I mentioned, they are a pub and a restaurant.  Food prices are
apparnetly ala carte, and vary from about $9-$17, with specials
even more expensive on the weekends.  Food is served 5:30-9:30 p.m.,
and the pub/bar part is open until 11 p.m.

Here's directions, once one has crossed the Richmond-San Rafael bridge.
Go south on 101.
Take Stinson Beach Exit, and go towards Stinson Beach
When you see the Arco station, turn left at the light on Pacific Coast
    Highway, which is Highway One.

At the &quot;top&quot; it's supposed to be a bit confusing, but the proprietor
said to tell you all to &quot;stay left.&quot;

This place IS Muir Beach, not much else around there.

Estimated driving time on a Saturday from the 101 Stinson exit is
supposed to be about 20-30 minutes.

He says they are usually very busy on Saturdays, btw.  In addition
to the restaurant and pub, they have a back patio, which we (and others
there) can overflow on to.  They also have rooms for the night, but
I didn't inquire as to the price.  See phone above if you are interested.

See you there on Sat. Oct. 12th!  :)
