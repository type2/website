Tell me this can be done and you've got a customer!!!
I drove my 5spd Audi 5000 (non-turbo) for many years,
and when it was time to retire it (needed 4 shocks, had a cracked
exhaust header, blown A/C unit, etc. etc...), the engine had 176,000
miles on it, still got 29-30 mpg, did not lose a drop of oil, and
could still take the Audi up to 115+ mph on the I-78 stretch between
bethlehem PA and NJ border (and I loved the 21.5 gallon gas tank --
600+ mile range!!)

 &gt; 
 &gt;      These are 300K mi bulletproof engines, that run with a turbine like
 &gt;      smoothness, due to some peculiar balance characteristics of the 5cyl
 &gt;      configuration. They are available at great prices from unloved (the
 &gt;      ones without Quattro) Audis from the 80's.
 &gt; 
 &gt;      You can get normally aspirated engines with about 135HP, turbos
 &gt;      with anywhere from 168HP to 227HP.  Typically, these are 2.1 or 2.2
 &gt;      liters displacement.
 &gt; 
 &gt;      They already fit. A variant of this engine was installed in Vanagons
 &gt;      outside the US (maybe our SA collegues can chime in with more
 &gt;      information).
 &gt; 
 &gt;      Flying with the fantasy, once the list helps you get the details
 &gt;      sorted out all those diesel owners could upgrade to the diesel version
 &gt;      of the Audi 5cyl  (also sold by VW to Volvo, which put them in 240s
 &gt;      and 740s for awhile) and be able to keep up in the Bus caravans AND
 &gt;      enjoy airconditioning!
