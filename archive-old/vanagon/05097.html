&gt; All funnin' aside, I wonder if anyone has had a properly-inflated tire

&gt; wear out due to bad alignments, and recently had tread separation kill off
&gt; my two rear tires, but I've never heard of anyone ever having a sidewall
&gt; blowout.

Funnyyou should mention it...  but I just had a sidewall blowout under 
circumstances similar to your Jetta story.  I turned into a parling lot a 
couple of nights ago, and it turned out to be paved for exit only, with 
no sign and high curbs.  Cancel one Michelin XZX, a set of wheel bearings 
and the front end alignment.  About the only things to survive were the 
front axle beam (thank goodness {mucho $$$}), and the tie rod, ($40).  
Just part of an awful car week, tho, as I have also, in the past week, 
blown out a windshield (loaded with lumber when a car pulled out in front 
of me), and been merged into by a nissan.

&gt; What is gained by spending $80-$100 a tire with the 6ply or load range C
&gt; rating?  I've looked at some passenger tires (aquatred, and some el cheapos)
&gt; and am wondering since they all hold 2000+ pounds each, and the vans only
&gt; weigh around 6000 loaded, what do the high-priced tires have to offer? 
&gt; Stiffer sidewalls and better handling?  Would I be (economically) better 
&gt; off buying the no-name tires on sale for $30 a pop?

This is strictly IMHO, but I have always stuck to the Michelins for 
busses, because I tend to stuff them with lumber, bricks, etc.  Even if I 
didn't I would still get the reinforced, because I figure that a lot of 
the &quot;squirmy&quot; feeling  comes from sidewal flex, especially on radials.  
The weight carrying capacity may not be affected by cheaper tires, but 
there seems to be a relationship between price/# of layers and stiffness 
of both ride and sidewalls.  Maybe by going to a 15&quot; wheel with low 
profile tires you could get both good handling and low price. Idunno, I 
just follow the instructions, and the thing seems to work (as long as I 
don't do too many stupid things at once).
