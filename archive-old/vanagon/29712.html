Subject: Bosch voltage regulation

I'm on thin ice here (well, actually the lakes have about 6&quot; now) so 
if i'm wrong just chalk it up to... to whatever.

There appear to be 2 types of commonly used internal regulators on
modern Bosch alternators, the EE 14V3 and the EL 14V3.  The EE is, i
believe what most of us have, the EL model having external as well
as internal temperature voltage compensation.  There is actually a
temp sensitve diode under the battery tray of some cars to sense the
battery temp and adjust charging voltage accordingly.

The EE 14V3 is a sealed unit consisting of thin-film resistors, 
transistors, diodes, and a capacitor.  It is not externally 
adjustable to increase or lower the charging voltage, like some Delco 
units with an internal regulator.  The EE is also temperature 
compensating (higher charging voltage at colder temps) but the 
temperature is sensed at the regulator on the alternator.  While one 
could dissect the EE or EV and bias a transistor for more output, one 
starts getting into electrical Black Magic and i think the 
reliability would be compromised by messing with it.

In short, i can't see an easy way to increase the charging voltage of 
the Bosch units... if anyone else knows a way, please correct me.
