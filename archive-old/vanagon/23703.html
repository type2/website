Sorry if I forgot or didn't include what you drive,
and/or didn't include your name if you've confirmed
you are coming. I am still in the process of recompiling
my list as the one I had on my desk is now covered with
cat drool and fur balls...

Drop me a line if you want to be added (or dropped) from
the list...

Still looking for &quot;buddy volunteers&quot; for folks who volks
won't make the distance yet...
