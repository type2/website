&gt;This question is directed to those with EGR valves bolted to the throttle
...
&gt;a) ensure proper startup and acceleration without  stumbling and b) to
&gt;avoid the complexity and cost of replacing the valve ($200). My question
&gt;is twofold: a) Is there any reason (other than a moral one) that the EGR
&gt;valve should not  be blocked off completely thus avoiding the hassle of
&gt;replacing it? and b) does the EGR lower the temperature of the fuel/air
&gt;mixture making it less efficient (than without one). I ask this because the

on my old 1980 bus, when they told me how much that tiny little valve was
going to cost, i backed out and rethought this process. finally i  decided
to just block it off. i made a flat plate that cover the valve position
and bolt it in place with a gasket. for the exhaust pipe end of the little
pipe, i had it welded closed.  that was back in about 1985. although i sold
the bus (weep, sniff, boohoo), it's still running around town here. total
cost? about $20.

now that is in Alabama, which has virtually NO pollution laws, and absolutely
NO pollution tests (if your smokes really badly, the cops figure you are
killing mosquitos and leave you alone).

i never noticed any rise in temperatures of the engine or the exhaust or
any more rapid wearing-out of the exhaust pipes or mufflers. but then i
only put about 70,000 miles on it after i made that change (before i sold
it).

probably doesn't have anything to do with anything, but i told i'd tell ya.
