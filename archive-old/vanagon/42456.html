&gt;The other question is....is it okay to run the van in the summer without the
&gt;thermostat?  Also, what other possibilities could be causing the engine to
&gt;run warm?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks in advance....

     I have been experimenting with drilling holes in the thermostat to get
the temp down. I find that 3 1/8 inch holes dramatically cool things down.
In cold weather the heater dosn't work very well with the thermostat drilled
out. Taking the thermostat out would be too much.
