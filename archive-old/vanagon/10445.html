Subject: puke yellow color


I'm not sure what VW calls that color.  It could well be an ivory,
or a cream, or a yellow.  If the latter, it's definitely a light
yellow.  REALY pukey, barfy, and sort of dishwater colored.  Somewhat
akin to a dirty diaper.

Personally, I want to get my repainted, in and out, and would like to
evey try doing some of it myself.  I'm considering white, but the only
color I feel passionate about so far is this GORGEOUS new VW color
one sees on the new Cabriolets.  I think they call it violet metallic,
but it's rather more like a steel grey with a hint of dusty lavender.  It's
quite exotic, and I can't think of another car that's ever had a color
that came even close to this unusual one.
