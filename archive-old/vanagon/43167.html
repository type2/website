Subject: [NEED INFO] Questions on AT Transmission

I am contemplating the purchase of an `87 Westy with the automatic
transmission.  Can anyone tell me what the idiosyncrasies are with this
trans, if any??  Are they reliable??  What is the life expectancy??  Do they
depreciate the value of a Westy??

It sure would be nice to just sit back and drive(!)

Thanks.
