Subject: Colour combinations for '62 standard

The following message is a courtesy copy of an article
that has been posted as well.

Last summer on a drive through the Miramachi, I spotted an old
standard MircoBus parked in front of a farmhouse.  Yesterday, I put
new Yoko A509's on the jetta and was out on the 'driver and tyre get
acquainted' trip when I noticed that the Bus hadn't moved at all since
last summer.  The &quot;old fellow&quot; who owns it was not at home, however
his daughter-in-law came out from next door (to see who the long-hair
was snooping around the &quot;old-fellows&quot; yard) and informed I that he
bought it original in '62, converted it to a camper, and hasn't driven
it in over ten years.  I was told that he keeps talking about fixing
it up, but may be persuaded to sell to a good home ... [I told her
that it would have lots of company in my yard ;-) ].

The Bus is two tone, white on top, and a &quot;peachy&quot; colour on the lower
panels.  The dash and interior trim are also peach/apricot in colour.
The daughter-in-law swears that it has never been painted ... and it
looks like original paint.  Can anyone tell me if &quot;peach&quot; was a valid
factory colour for '62?

The Bus need two new rear quarter panels and a rear-bumper mount.  The
pans and rest of the frame and body (even the over-riders and spare
tyre rack) are in good shape given that it has been sitting out doors
for the last five to ten years.  The 36bhp power(less) plant would
likely need some work...the engine compartment was clean and much
taller than in my '67 ....looks like there is a spare tyre mount to
the right of the engine...

I think there is some potential here...I am going back next weekend to
talk to the &quot;old guy&quot; himself..

Bugs &amp; Things,

Roy
