&gt;Grendel crept out onto the highway this morning at 8:23.  It was raining a
&gt;sad, cold rain that continued for the next two hours as we fled south.
&gt;
&gt;The engine ran fine.  The tranny did not.  Each time we stopped for gas
&gt;Grendel squatted down and pissed a pie-plate sized pool of tranny lube on
the
&gt;concrete.  When she stopped pissing I crawled under and fed her some more
&gt;lube.  She liked it but got progressively noisier as the day went on,
&gt;culminating with an ominous shriek of tortured bearings as we struggled over
&gt;a pass in southern Oregon.
&gt;
&gt;I'm in Grant's Pass, Oregon.  It is cold and getting colder, weather
unsuited
&gt;for summer shirts and cotton socks.  And I'm tired.  
&gt;
&gt;Tomorrow I'll try to find a flat spot in the sun, see what I can do in the
&gt;way of repairs.  I'm not very hopeful.

This is the last posting that I've read from Bob.  With the way AOL does he
could have had 10 postings since and I might not get them until Tuesday.  Has
anyone heard from him?  Hope things aren't going too bad.
