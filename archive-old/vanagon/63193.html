&gt;The Campmobile owners guide that I got from the previous

&gt;you have or do you just stop at a propane station every so often
&gt;and have them fill it up.

&gt;A related question.  Assuming that the temperature is in the
&gt;70-80 range,  how many days can you run the refrig on a tank
&gt;of propane.  I know there are lots of variables, but just a
&gt;ball park number is fine ( &lt; 2 days, about a week, ...)
