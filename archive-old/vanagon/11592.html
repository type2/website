just a reminder:

lots of neat little hooks and hookers and thingies can be made from a
commonly found article in the home: metal coat hangers.  i've made several
little hookers from  them, and also used them to 'fish' wires through
places where the wires did not want to go. :)

besides ... using the coat hangers and cutting them up and such, well, it
kinda keeps them from breeding so fast in them dark closets.
