Subject: Wasserboxer head question

I have an old 2.1 l Vanagon engine in my basement. I have no idea about
the history of this engine, other than throwing a rod at 114,000 miles. 

I'm wondering about the condition of the heads, and if they
are original or had been replaced. There is a clock like casting
on each head seems like it would tell the manufacturing date if I knew
how to read it... anybody know how?

Thanks,

Tom F.
