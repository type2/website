Subject:       help identify engine

I don't know what kind of engine is in my '72 bus and it is time for 
points, plugs, oil change etc.. I want to make sure I get all the 
right parts and set the timing correctally the first time.  is there 
some sort of identifier on the block?  any help identifying this 
engine would be apreciated.  My paperwork says a '74 was installed 
in'82 at 83,000 but it may have been changed again since then, the 
odo reads 17000 curently, who knows, maybee it only has 30 some 
thousand on it (or 130some).  Anyway, a friend of mine said that the 
two square corners on the heads and the large seperate intakes would 
help to identify it.
    thanks
    Ed.
