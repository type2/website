Subject: Re: skates? Whom do I thank?

&gt;Sorry for non-VW content:  some kind soul on either the air or
&gt;water list (I assume) saw my plea for a pair of those old-fashioned
&gt;roller skates.  A set arrived in the mail to me yesterday, but with
&gt;no return address, and their note not signed.  It was mailed from
&gt;Auburn, CA.  I'd like to know whom to thank for this gracious deed?  :)
