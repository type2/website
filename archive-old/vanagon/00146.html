&gt; it sounds like you have fried that little voltage regulator that is on

&gt; the foil. i'll check further when i get home (bentley is not at work!).

What's happened. I've pulled out the dash and visually inspected the printed
circuit foil (a $107 part) and can't see anything obvious.  So, I pulled 
out the three dash lights, and two of them have no continuity across 
their terminals.  However, the turn signal and battery LEDs don't light 
either, so I can't imagine how the dash lights being fried would affect 
them.  I'm going to pull them out.  Would continuity in one direction be 
enough verification that they're ok?

I found the &quot;voltage regulator&quot; thing.  The parts fiche (thanks Joel!!!) 
calls it a &quot;vibrator.&quot;  My wife wanted to know why it wasn't installed in 
the seat &lt;grin&gt;.  I can't imagine how I would check it, but it has 10V 
printed next to it on the card, so if I managed to send 12V+ through this 
thing the wrong way and it was expecting 10V, I can imagine I might have 
toasted it.  Anyone know a way to test it?

Thanks,
