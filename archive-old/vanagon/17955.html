It's hard to recommend for sure without seeing the holes and knowing if the
damage is structural.  I don't know if they make replacement floor pans for
buses; I don't remember seeing them advertised.  If you're going to patch,
I recommend using tin snips or maybe a saber saw with a metal cutting blade,
depending on how much room you have.  Check underneath, of course, to make
sure there aren't wires or other obstructions.  For patching, I've had good
luck in the past using aluminum.  It's lightweight, easy to bend, and never
rusts.  You can get it at places that do welding and metal work.  Look in
the phone book.  Cut as much of the rust out as you can, then use a wire
brush (a hand held one, or on a drill) and get rid of loose rust on the
remaining metal.  Use Extend or similar on the remaining surface rust and
let it cure for a day.  Here's my trick, one that I haven't seen mentioned
very often:  I use cardboard to make a template for the metal I'm going to
install.  A pizza box works well if the area isn't gigantic.  Lay the
cardboard over the hole and cut it to the general shape needed,
overlapping the good metal by a couple of inches or so.  As you press the
cardboard in place, if the surface you're patching is at all curved, you'll
notice wrinkles in the cardboard.  Use scissors to cut a slit so that the
cardboard overlaps instead of wrinkles, then trim it so that it butts
together instead of overlaps.  Kind of hard to explain but you'll see what
I mean when you try it.  The cardboard is obviously much easier to cut
than the aluminum, so make sure it's all nice and flat and fits good, then
unfold it on the aluminum and trace around it with a marker.  Use the tin
snips to cut the aluminum (I use about 1/16&quot; thick, BTW, maybe a little
thinner), bend it roughly to shape and secure it with pop rivets about every
three inches.  Rivet one edge at a time to hold the patch in place, then use
a small hammer to tap the aluminum into the exact shape.  I've even used a
socket extension as a blunt chisel to bend the metal into inside corners.
This whole approach may sound kind of crude, but I've got some pretty good
results with it, and it doesn't take all that long.  If you're unsure, you
could take a few minutes to try the cardboard thing and see how you like
it before deciding to go out and buy the aluminum.  After everything is
riveted in place, I spray the whole area with undercoat on the inside and
outside.  Hope this helps!
