Subject: '75 breadloaf FS near SF


Saw this while erranding today.  Don't know anything other than what I've
posted below...

1975 7-seater breadloaf.  Owner has all service records.  It's orange
and white.  Manual transmission.  License plate # 951 UIJ, and the
mileage on the odometer (which I saw thru the window) for what it's
worth (prolly not a lot) read 57,745.  Call Dan at 510.674.1868.  The
price on the sheet said $1650, but then someone had writting on the front
window $975.
