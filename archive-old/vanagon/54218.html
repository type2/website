Subject: Re: What colour is freon?

Hello Dan.  I forgot to mention in my post that our van has a manual 
shift.    However, I've had a couple people reply saying that the oil 
in the system can be pink.  So, I guess our compressor is leaking.

I had this compressor rebuilt May 5/95 under extended warranty.  The 
van has only done 21000 km (13000 miles) since then, and the 
compressor is run every 2 to 3 weeks to keep the seals lubricated.  
Hmm, more investigation needed.

Regarding a/c lines sprouting little leaks along the high pressure 
lines, our van doesn't seem to have this problem.

Thanks for your reply

Harry

&gt; Sure sounds like auto tranny fluid to me.  If the torque converter 
&gt; seal starts going it can get slung ALL over by the torque converter (a 
&gt; condition I may be looking at right now).  I have in the past used a 
&gt; red dye to track down a freon leak, however. 
&gt; 
&gt; On the subject of refrigerant leaks, has anyone else noticed oil 
&gt; weeping from the A/C high pressure line in evenly spaced spots along 
&gt; the hose (about an inch apart, all around the hose) as if it were 
&gt; designed to do this?
