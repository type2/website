Subject: re:How tall is a Westy????

David Goldberg mentioned that the owners manual for his '79 states the
height to be  80 1/8&quot;.  I had previously measured the '83 to be 6'8&quot; (80&quot;)
running siimilar tires.  I prefer to park mine outside of the scary parking
garages. Keep in mind variations in the flooring and the over hanging
sprinkler pipes and light fixtures might lend a few surprises!  Also the
length of your bus as it starts up the up ramp might have some &quot;trig&quot;
effects on the height depending on where the roof of the garage changes to
the up ramp roof. After damaging the canopy of the single cab in a garage
with the &quot;proper&quot; clearance I keep the tall buses outside.
