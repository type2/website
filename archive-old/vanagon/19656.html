Subject: Loose CV bolts

Regarding your problem with CV joint bolts, I too have had a similar experience.
I replaced the left drive shaft on my '80 convertible.  I was surprised to
find that the manual called for only 28 lb-ft of tourque to hold these
bolts.  I did as the manual guided me to and drove my car.  I was driving
home from work one day, and my mind drifted to these bolts.  It sure seemed
odd to me that six measly bolts could withstand all the abuse that a CV
joint gets (there is no locking lug surface, the bolts must withstand
everything a juvenile driver can dish out).  I also pondered in depth the 28
lb-ft tourque requirement.  Wouldn't you know it, about a mile from my house
I was sitting a t a light (on a hill), and when I went to let the clutch out
all I got was &quot;Clunk&quot;, no motion, but lots of revs.  I got out and looked
underneath.  There was the inside end of my CV joint laying on the ground.
Most of the bolts had just backed out, but the last two were bent and toast.
I had no tools, but managed to thread 3 bolts back in by hand.  I eased home
and went to work.
I took out all the bolts and looked them over.  Then it hit me.  The bolts I
had removed had a small square patch (a Lock-tite style patch).
I took them back to the place I had my CV pressed on at, and set the bolts
on the counter.  &quot;I take it you're supposed to use Lock-tite on these?&quot; I asked.
The guy behind the counter said no, and he'd never seen any problem.  Of
course he had probably never done a CV, so advice is worth what it costs...
I replaced the bolts with no Lock-tite, but I did tourque the hell out of
them.  I kept checking them every day (and still do occasionally).  If I saw
one of them getting loose I was going to use LT but so far haven't had to.
Advice:  buy NEW bolts, tourque the hell out of them, and check them often.
If you have to use Lock-tite, make sure you use the kind you can get back
off (CV's aren't forever)
