Subject: Beware of Fridays; an apology 

Whoops! 

I see from Ed Pyrik's post &quot;Re:Weakly Stats ... Eurovans?&quot; 
that I ignored some important considerations for newer listmembers
when I posted &quot;C Codes for VW Type II (long)&quot;

So, newbies please:

(1) Beware of Fridays. Anytime you read anything on this list with Friday 
in the body or subject line, be suspect. Friday is the traditional day 
that Gerry relaxes strict Vanagon list content requirements, and lets us 
get a little loose. In a &quot;Friday&quot; posting you may find jokes, poems, and 
put ons, as well as serious statistical analysis. 

(2) There is no such thing as C Codes. I made them up.  Reviewing
my post, I can see how this was confusing.

Meanwhile, I resolve to include &quot;Friday&quot; in the subject line when 
ever I attempt humor.  

Now, while I can make up stupid ways to make coffee like many others, 
for the *facts* about model differences, check the archives,
or take a look at
