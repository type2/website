Subject: Re: westy propane question

&gt;Can anyone tell me if it's safe to drive a westy with the propane
&gt;on for the refrigerator?

The manual tells you all kinds of stupid (simple) things NOT to do (like
don't close the windows and heat the van with the stove), but never warns you
against leaving the propane refrig on. An RV dealer told me he'd been in the
business 30 years and never saw a problem  with leaving the propane on.
I leave mine on. My brick hasn't exploded yet!
