Okeydokey,

	Saturday I got the new front wheel bearings put in, and today I got 
the new back brakes put in, (new wheel cylinders and shoes.)  The right one 
was all wet with brake fluid, and the the left one was dry - turns out
it was the only dry brake on my bus... YOW! 

	The big thing I was scared of, well actually one of two, was not 
being able to get the drums off, since they've been on there for well
over 20 years!  My other big fear was not being able to get the nuts loose.
I was having nightmares about this project just for these reasons!  Well,
everything came off relatively easy.  I did break a nice ratchet putting
the nut back _on_, though!  I was too cheap and lazy to get a 36mm socket
for my 3/4&quot; breaker bar, so I used my 1/2&quot; ratcher instead, with a cheater bar,
of course.  I broke one of the little teeth off inside the ratchet, so
now I can loosen stuff but not tighten it!  Argggggghhhhh! Anyone know if
Thorsen tools have a replacement warranty, like sears tools do?

	All told, I spent well over $300 on the brake and wheel bearing
project!

	I started a spreadsheet the other day, to keep track off all expenditures
on this beastie.  How about we play &quot;the price is right&quot; with the total
expenditures on this baby so far?  You people can post your gueses here,
and in a couple of days, I'll post who the winner was.  Prices include the
cost of parts only.  I have done every single bit of labor myself, and I
work for free (sob!)  I have posted the prices of most of the stuff I have
bought, so it will have paid off if you were paying attention.  Price
also includes the cost of the bus.

Major projects were (to date)

Purchase of the bus
Sunroof
brakes
engine
seats   
rocker panels
starter problem
new popout windows
windsheild rust fixin'

	Materials such as cleaners, sandpaper, paint and
the like are not included in the total, although I am starting a 
separate spreadsheet just for that.

Projects left to go:

transaxle
tires
wheel restoration 
install battery tray
finish welding on rocker panels
finish body work 
window rubber all around ($$$)
paint

	This next week I will be picking up my new transaxle, and I am planning 
on installing it on New Years Day.

Thom
