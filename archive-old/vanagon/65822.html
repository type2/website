&gt;Congratulations! Welcome to automotive hell!  Just kidding, I have a '80
&gt;Westfalia, the camper version of your van.  I'll be glad to help anyway I
&gt;can, we need to stick together!   You should subscribe to the vanagon list,
&gt;it is very helpful, especially if you're new to VW's.  I'm an ASE master
&gt;tech, and I still learn something now and then.  Besides, you can't beat the
&gt;wealth of experience of several hundred occasionally befuddled vanagon
&gt;owners.! Try sending a message with nothing in the subject to
&gt;&quot;vanagon_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu&quot;  in the text box type subscribe vanagon list
&gt;&quot;your name&quot;

NO, DON'T USE these old addresses.  Please don't pass them along to
people anymore.  Below is the sig that I have been passing along to
people in a quandry over how to join our VW mailing list.


In mid July 1997 the vanagon list server moved from MN to rust free San
Diego, these are current instructions.  I am a list member who has
volunteered to forward instructions on to people who request it.  Sorry
for any delay but this method insures you will get one response to your
query.


SAVE THIS MESSAGE
===========================INSTRUCTIONS============================
All requests should be addressed to listserv_at_gerry.sdsc_dot_edu and NOT to
vanagon_at_gerry or to anything _at_lenti.  Make sure your subject line is
blank or &quot;NONE&quot;.

The message formats are
SET VANAGON DIGEST
SET VANAGON NODIGEST
SET VANAGON INDEX
SET VANAGON NOINDEX
SET VANAGON MAIL
SET VANAGON NOMAIL

Here are the descriptions of these modes from the manual.

5.3.2. DIGest/NODIGest
----------------------
Causes the subscriber to receive one posting per digest cycle (typically
daily)  rather than individual messages as they are processed by LISTSERV.

In version 1.8b, the MAIL/NOMAIL option has been isolated from
DIGEST/INDEX. The MAIL/NOMAIL option controls whether messages should be
delivered, and the DIGEST/INDEX/NODIGEST/NOINDEX option controls the
format in which messages should be delivered. Thus, switching to NOMAIL
and back to MAIL now preserves the digest/index/normal delivery setting.
To provide as much compatibility with the old syntax as possible, the
four options operate as follows:

 DIGEST: enable digest delivery mode (which negates INDEX), enable mail
         delivery.

 INDEX:  enable index delivery mode (which negates DIGEST), enable mail
         delivery.

 NOMAIL: disable mail delivery.

 MAIL:   restore mail delivery, without altering the digest/index/normal
         delivery setting (new behavior). For compatibility with 1.8a, if
         mail delivery was already active, the MAIL option negates INDEX/
         DIGEST. Thus, a user going from NOMAIL to MAIL will keep his
         previous  delivery options, whereas a user going from DIGEST or
         INDEX to MAIL will in fact deactivate index/digest mode.

To revert from digest/index subscription mode to normal delivery, you can
use either the MAIL option as before, or the NODIGEST/NOINDEX option. The
NODIGEST and NOINDEX options were actually present in versions 1.7f and
1.8a, as synonyms for the MAIL option. In other words, you can update
your instructions to indicate that the DIGEST/INDEX options are negated
by the NODIGEST/NOINDEX options, even if your server is not yet running
version 1.8b.

Note that in extreme cases, subscribers using the DIGEST option may
receive
more than one digest per cycle if the digest limit is reached before the
end of the cycle.
