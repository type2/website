Subject: Re: Propane fridges: '76-'79


I, like others I know, gutted the useless Westfalia fridge and converted 
it to storage. I run a chest-type fridge off of the normal propane tank. 
I put it behind the passenger seat as a perfect bench for cooking, etc. 
Worked well for camping on isolated beaches in Mexico for extended 
periods of time.

I got it from a propane distributor in Canada, but you might be able to 
order it from an RV store in the US. Browse the Dometic catalog that they 
have and see if they still make something small enough to suit you...
