Subject: Re: This Month in HMN (April)

Some people seem to want to know this.

&gt; Please forgive my ignorance, but what is the HMN?  I guess I'm not as
&gt; knowledgable as I thought I was.
&gt; 
&gt; Sincerely,
&gt; A. Hill

No ignorance, Hemmings Motor News, also known as &quot;the used car
bible&quot; getting to be sort of rare on the newstands, more a a 
subscription only thing for people that follow the value of used 
cars, VW's a pretty trivial section actually.
