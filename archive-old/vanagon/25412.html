Subject:       sunroof as engine hatch?

After working on a friends '74 I realized how wonderful that hatch in 
the cargo floor can be.  My '72 of course does not have this feature. 
when I asked A friend of mine who works at Ziebart, if he could 
install a removeable sunroof in the cargo floor he said it wouldn't 
be a problem and he could do it super cheep.  I figure it would also 
come in handy in the winter seeing as my heat exchangers have massive 
holes in them, I could just open the &quot;sunroof?&quot; and put a fan back 
there.  Does any one have any experience with such a &quot;unique&quot; 
project, any foresight/comments would be apreciated.
