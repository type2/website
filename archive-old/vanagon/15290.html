&gt; 
&gt; At the San Jose meet this weekend, I saw a VW Thing (181, Safare,
&gt; Trekker, etc.), probably either a '73, or a '74, since I believe
&gt; those were the only two years that vehicle was for sale in this
&gt; country.  I'd forgotten how much I like them, and have since
&gt; subscribed myself to the Thing mailing list, although no
&gt; messages have come thru since yesterday (vanagon.lenti they
&gt; are NOT).
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, do any of you VW gurus out there have some tasty info
&gt; on them you'd like to e-mail my way?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks!

&gt; '81 westy (puke eggnog {ivory}).  And yes, it has AC, and 3 levers  :) 
&gt; '79 bug 'vert (white)

As you might know by now I have a '73 thing.  I'm planning on 
reinvigorating it as a even more sport utility kind of 'thing'.  To get 
Van content, I'm hoping to use my EV MV to travel towing the Thing behind 
as a run around vehicle.  The EV isn't the ATV the old Westys were/are.

I've never received any mail from the thing list.
