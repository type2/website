Subject: Re: air bag option

I think you have a very good idea here.  The exact weight setting is not 
important at this time, it could even be adjustable.  The mechanics of a 
reliable switch in a soft seat may be a challenge but I would think that 
a reasonable cost design can be found.  I encourage your passing this 
along to Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.  He is interested in calling a senate 
hearing on the air bag issue early next year.  You can find his address 
or E-mail address on the Internet.  You also might pass this idea along 
to Ford, GM, etc.  They are opposed to the hearings as is the insurance 
industry because they think the 1991 airbag law has saved them from law 
suits.  This new issue may change their thinking.  At least they want to 
keep the air bags.  This solves a lot of problems, just this right 
sensing system needs to be developed.  The auto makers can take care of 
this. You might also send a copy to Ralph Nader, yes he is still active 
at age 62.

This has the makings of a good political solution where everyone wins.  
Go for it.  Great thinking, Tonya.

&gt; How's this for a new twist on the air bags.  As opposed to the passenger
&gt; side 'switch', there should be a sensor in the passenger seat to let the
&gt; puter know if someone large enough to benefit from the airbag is sitting
&gt; there.  For example, there must be 100 pounds or more sitting there for
&gt; the airbag to deploy in an accident.  This would be beneficial in two
&gt; ways.  1)  Small children, weighing under 100 lbs, would not set the
&gt; sensor off, so the bag would not deploy.  They would be protected from
&gt; the force of the airbag.  2)  The airbag would not needlessly deploy
&gt; when there is only a driver in the vehicle.  Do you know how expensive
&gt; it is to get the durn thing stuffed back in the dash?  If no one is
&gt; sitting there, it doesn't need to go off.  If a child is sitting there,
&gt; it shouldn't go off.  And an adult wouldn't get hurt because the
&gt; theoretical 'switch' was turned off.
&gt; 
&gt; I personally think that this is the best option.  The 100 lb mark was
&gt; purely theoretical.  I know some adults weigh less than this and some
&gt; children weigh more.  But, it seems like a good guess of an acceptable
&gt; mark.  I'll write my stupid government people.  Anybody else?
