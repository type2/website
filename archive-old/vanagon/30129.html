Subject: ECU and connector wire request.

my tinkering cravings are saying FEED ME!

i would like to build a 'pin-out' or 'breakout' box for the vanagon 
ECU harness and computer.  to do this i need a spare, fried is fine, 
ECU for the connector and a spare, Fried is Fine, wiring harness or 
just the last few feet for the connector end.  these breakout boxes are 
available commercially at rediculous prices.

so if anyone has some toasted components sitting behind the christmas 
tree stand in the garage and would like to clean house, i would 
gladly reimburse.  OR if someone knows just the equivalent part 
number for the connectors via electronic supply companies eg DigiKey, 
that would be cool too.

another question.
are the ECU connectors the same for all Bosch ECUs or is this a 
vanagon specific thing?  could one scavenge an old Rabbit, of which 
there are a zillion out there?

-dan (whose wife just said i should go ahead and buy that Fluke DMM 
i've always wanted)
