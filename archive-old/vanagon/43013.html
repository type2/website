&gt; 1.&gt; There is a hole underneath the glovecompartment, but still on the dash.
&gt; It sorta looks like a round metal socket.  Does anyone know what this is for?

Ahh the mysterious silver socket!  Whatever you do don't stick your tongue in 
it ;-)  It's a 12V socket (kinda like a cigarette lighter).  Accessories are 
a little hard to come by (especially in Canada) but they do exist.  About a 
week ago a list member (can't remember who) said he/she was ordering a 
catalog from a place which carried some accerssories.

&gt; 
&gt; 2.&gt; I have an electric fridge and two (12V) batteries.  How long can I leave
&gt; the fridge on (without using 115V power) before I burn out the battery.
&gt; will it burn out both batteries, or just the auxillary?, and is it okay to
&gt; run the battery out?  Also does anybody know what kind of drain the stereo
&gt; puts on the regular battery?
&gt; 

Depends on the type of battery.  If it's just a regular car battery then it's 
probably already close to dead (mine was when I bought Lief).  You need a 
deep cycle.  If your second battery is in the engine compartment on the 
driver's side then it is a little difficult to find one that fits.  I got a 
Gel Cell (sealed so you can mount it on its side) from Edmonds Battery on 
Edmonds between Canada Way and Kingsway in Burnaby.  A few weeks ago there 
was a good web address posted to the list that gave a great overview of 
batteries and how to calculate how long you could run them using various 
appliances (anyone wtill have this bookmarked?).

&gt; 3.&gt; Does anyone know how much tire holders for the front cost?
&gt; 

I'll leave this for someone else.

&gt; 4.&gt; The thin foam layer on the bottom of the pop-top seems to have attracted
&gt; these little black dots (like mould).  Considering I live in a damp climate
&gt; (Vancouver, BC) I am not suprised :-(  Does anyone know how to prevent or
&gt; get rid of this problem?  Also the roof has seemed to attract some sort of
&gt; moss or lichen and I was wondering what I should do about this?

I scrubbed Lief's roof (the exterior that is) with a wire brush, a nylon 
scour pad, and some industrial cleaner.  Then I bleached it.  Be aware that 
bleach will eat your rubber seals though.  I was replacing my seals at the 
same time so this didn't affect me.
