Subject: Subscription announcement

Here's the annoucement I got when I used the list to sign myself up. 
None of you would have gotten this because of the origin of this list, 
so I figured I'd post it so you all could see it.
===============
You have been added to list vanagon_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu.
The system has recorded your address as

			gsker

and in order for your messages to get posted (if the list accepts postings),
you will have to send them from this address, unless the list does not require
subscription for posting.

[Ed. It doesn't]

If a message is ever rejected, please contact the list's owner:
gsker_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu

Your initial password is 765331994. Please change it as soon as you can
by issuing the following request to listproc_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu:

[Ed. All of your passwords were set to PASS -- change it if you wish]

		SET VANAGON PASSWORD 765331994 new-password

WARNING: Do not use your login password; you will be breaching security at your
site.

This system may accept Internet TCP/IP connections for processing of live
requests, and the password will be used to give you subscriber privileges.
For more information, send a 'help live' request to 
listserv_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu.

[Ed. Nope.  I deinstalled that after I found out what I could do through
    that interface.  Too hard to keep the security straight, and anything 
    you really need to do, you and I can do through email.]

For information on this service and how to use it, send the following
request in the body of a mail message to listserv_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu:

			HELP
[this still works]
All requests should be addressed to listserv_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu.

============
I haven't figured out how to change this whole spiel yet, so that's how 
it will read until I do. (It's not a file anywhere I can find.)
I have both aliases listproc and listserv setup, so if you forget and
use the other one becuase you did at some other site, it'll still work.
I'll get the archives on gopher and FTP as soon as I can.  

Enjoy.
