&gt;| ?? - Since headlight power is only available when key is on, pull out the
&gt;| rocker switch and wire the marker lights 'out' lead to the 'in' lead for the
&gt;| headlights. This should switch the side lights on in the usual manner via
&gt;| same wiring. No relays, draws current from high amp headlight section.  If
&gt;| you wanted headlights on too, jumper across the back of the rocker switch
&gt;| for them. Stalk would still do the hi/lo bit.

	You might want to consider adding a rely that is wired to bypass the
switch when the engine is running and the alternator is cranking out power.
If you ever sat with the ignition on to be able to raise and lower the windows
for example (if you have power windows) or if your stereo is ignition
controlled, or just sat there for some reason, you could deaden your battery
right quick, or draw enough current for the lights that the starter might
have a hard time cranking the engine in cold weather. If the switch is
bypassed and not removed, you could still turn the lights on without the
engine running if you ever needed to...
