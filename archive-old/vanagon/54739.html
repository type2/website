Scott -
I have driven MANY miles with no clutch, due to various failures in 
both the Vanagon, priorbusses, and Sqbk.  Starting in second is hard on 
the starter system, but it works even on a slight uphill after having to 
stop for a stalled lumber truck.  The toughest part is timing to get 
to the stop lights when they are green.  The worst thing one can do is 
stopping and restarting.  The associated wild waving and gesturing 
when running stop signs is obligitory.

Shifting between 2, 3 &amp; 4 is easy enough, just listen to your engine 
and feel your tranny.  Supply a slight push on the shifter, and 
at the right ground speed and engine speed the transmission will 
accept the slight push and you'll go into gear.  There are gizmos in 
the transmission that'll keep you from damaging the trans.  If you 
push hard and hear crash noises, damage is/has occurred.  

WARNING, these tactics are for short term, emergency use only.  
Serious damage WILL occur with prolonged use.  Once you get into any 
gear try to stay IN that gear as long as possible.

Every now and then in a flashback or something, I'll forget to use the 
clutch, and shift anyway.  But having done this without a clutch so much, 
the shift just goes easily.

My Sqbk trans was feeling strange, so took it in.  Mechanic couldn't 
get into ANY gear.  I had been driving it so much that I knew all the 
shift points so well that I had no problems, but nobody else could.  
How's that for a theft deterrent!

Now travelling with a trans STUCK in second gear is another story.

&gt; I mentioned this to some people I work with and a few mentioned they 
&gt; &quot;knew people&quot; (don't they always?) who shifted their manual trannys 
&gt; without using the clutch just by cranking over in gear and just jamming 
&gt; the lever in for the upshifts.

&gt; Question-Does anyone have personal experience or can advise of the 
&gt; damage, if any, that may be incurred by shifting without using the 
&gt; clutch?  This is the second time in my life I have had to limp home 
&gt; without a clutch (first was with an old Mustang).
