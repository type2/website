&gt;I've wondered if Mr. Bozo would get Humpty-Dumptied if I tried to take him
&gt;to Mexico and back, especially with the factory belly-pans to give the
&gt;frame more stiffness (what with the double-double-doors) and therefore more
&gt;places to stuff &quot;stuff&quot;.

What are these belly pans?  I was thinking of fabricating someting like that
for my bus to keep all my new undercoating clean and dry.  You'd
prolly also get a littl ebetter mileage.  Anyone ever seen the underbelly
of the newer 911's?  Its like a toy car - all flat except where the 
wheels stick out.
