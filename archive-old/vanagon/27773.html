Subject: how far to rebuild ?

     
     
     Hello all -
     
     this question is an off shoot of an earlier post I made, thanks 
     everyone for the responses.
     
     I have an 82 westy with 112,000 on it.  the only work that I know that 
     has been done to it was a new head, probably quite some time ago.  I 
     seems fairly strong, but burns a bit of oil (on highway driving it's 
     about  1 qt per 600 miles).  (perhaps &quot;stong&quot; is relative, but it 
     drives ok for me)
     
     Because I live in an apartment and don't want to tackle a rebuild just 
     now I (think) I'm willing to pay to have it done.  But after reading 
     Muir's book and talking with a friend I'm unclear if I should have the 
     block cracked and have everything rebuilt.  I figure it should be done 
     as a matter of course, and Muir says that with this milage it should 
     be.
     
     I haven't had the compression checked, I am going to try to go to the 
     shop at lunch.  
     
     I'd be interested in thoughts of the group, also, does anyone have 
     recommendations for mechanics in the Denver Colorado area ?
     
     thanks much
