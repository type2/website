Yes.  VW vans are all generally described as Type 2.  Beetles were VW Type 1.

Assumng you're in the USA, here's a summary:

Split windshield &quot;microbuses&quot; were made from about 1950 (before 1955 or so
would be VERY rare) till 1967.  These have small, rear, air cooled engines
with rear wheel drive.

Bay window buses (sometimes called bubble windows of breadloafs) were made
from          1968 to 1979.  1968 to 1971 had the smaller, less powerful, &amp;
simplier &quot;upright&quot; engine like earlier VW vans.  1972 to 1979 had the more
complex &amp; powerful, fuel injected 2.0L engine.  All of these have rear, air
cooled engines with rear wheel drive.

Vanagons were made from 1980 to 1991.  1980 till 1983 had the same 2.0L
engine as the late &quot;bay window&quot; buses.  In 1982 &amp; 1983 a diesel engine was an
option.  1983.5 to 1985 the engine was a 1.9L watercooled &quot;waterboxer&quot;
engine.  All of these are rear engine &amp; rear wheel drive.  In 1986 VW
installed the 2.1L &quot;waterboxer&quot; and used it through 1991.  From 86 to 91
(except 88) the Syncro all-wheel drive model was available, still with a rear
mounted engine.

Eurovans arrived in the USA in 1993 and were a complete re-think for VW vans.
 These continue to the present and are front engined, front wheel drive,
watercooled vehicles.

Hmmmmm?  My paragraph on Vanagons is twice as big as the others....guess what
I drive.  :-)     I suggest you might also check out the &quot;dictionary&quot; section
of the www.Vanagon_dot_com page.

Good luck &amp; welcome to the list,
