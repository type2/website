wrong. all it means is that one out of twelve editors for a magazine chose
a car that you had already started making payments for. that's ALL it means.
no prima facia evidence of anything else.

as to 'groveling', my dear sir, i was merely distributing to the membership
of the list an article that proported to show a volkswagen product being
chosen in the company of some rather exotic vehicles. an article which i
supposed was not intended to be humorous, but in its own way provided a
bit of a chuckle to the reader. :)

but, as typifies the attorney-types in our society today, Mr. G. has taken
this as full and complete victory for his ideas and philosophies. all or
nothing. media-hype. a sad but common story these days. sigh.
