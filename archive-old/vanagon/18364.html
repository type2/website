I'll be coming up Sat. for the VW show.  New engine not in my '76 Camper
yet, so driving my girlfriend's Mazda, but hey, I did talk her into coming.
I hear there is a Vietnam Vets march this weekend - hope we can find a
cheap motel room on Sat. night....

The march is called &quot;Rolling Thunder&quot;. There will be over a thousand
          Harleys and other bikes parked all over the Mall downtown. I
          usually see about 100 Harleys on the way.
