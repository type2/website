&gt;Subject: Keeping warm

On the thread of keeping warm.  My bus has a folding pressed-wood partition 
behind the driver and passenger seats.  It has two folds and is attached to 
the closet behind the driver.  I'm not sure if it is factory installed, but 
it fits quite well when closed.  The only thing I have to do in the bitter 
cold is put a towel between the partition top and roof of the cab.  If the 
towel is not installed, a chilly breeze comes blowing onto my neck.  Combined 
with a 25amp ceramic-electric heater, I might not be warm but I certainly do 
not freeze.  Now the only thing I have to do is figure out how to keep the 
exhaust/gas fumes coming through the heater pipe.  I smell like I work at a 
refinery if I leave the heater duct open, let alone the fan on for too long.  
Boy a gas heater would be nice!!!
