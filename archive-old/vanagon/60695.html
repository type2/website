Subject: Cleaning Brake Fluid Spills
Date: 30 May 97 08:29:47 PDT

Upon removing my floor mats (Vanagon) to clean, I happened to notice 
a consistent behavior as I washed them with a hose.  I knew I had 
spilled a little brake fluid on them.  I know I shoulda done this at 
a car wash that properly process the waste water, but I didn't.  

Anyway.

As water is sprayed on objects with braked fluid, the brake fluid 
foams up, almost like a detergent.  I kept spraying until the foaming 
stopped.  I figured that the brake fluid is gone.  I confirmed this 
opservation by rinsing off the outside of my used brake fluid 
container.  Same foaming action.  It wasn't due to being a carpet.  I 
could feel that the fluid was indeed gone.

Now we have a way to check that brake fluid has been removed from 
carpet!
