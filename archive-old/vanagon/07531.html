Subject: replacment speedometers/odometers

Someone, I think it was Joel, recently posted some names of companies that
might stock '81 Vanago speedometer/odometers.  After much dissection of the
beast I think we are about to give up on it and VW says the replacement
from them will cost $250!!!  Please repost/post any information you all
have about buyin replacment speedo/odos.

Thanks.
