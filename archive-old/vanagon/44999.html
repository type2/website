Subject: '64 Deluxe Out of Hibernation (long)

Went out this morning to liberate the '64 Sunroof Deluxe Bus from the 
confines of the barn which had been its home for the past 13 years.  The 
PO had taken the wheels into Monkey Wards to have new radials mounted 
last week, so I didn't have to bring the air-tank and spare wheels that 
I usually bring to a Bus rescue.  I also brought along a large friend to 
help shove the Bus on the tow dolly (didn't feel like using the 
come-along in the oppressive heat/humidity of SW Missouri).  After we 
pushed the Bus out of the barn, we snapped several pictures and shot some 
video.  It was great to see this Bus basking in the light of day.  Well, 
maybe no *so* great.  The bright sun revealed several blemishes and small 
spots of surface rust (rock chips, etc.).  I also noticed an additional 
bit of body damage (the rear apron had been &quot;bent&quot; to allow the use of a 
Beetle muffler at some point [tho' the Bus currently sports the correct 
single tip exhaust]).  I guess this means that the rear bumper with the 
holes for the Beetle exhaust is probably original).  The Bus was 
then towed to its new home with ease.

Once back in my driveway, I began to remove the years of barn dust and 
mud-dauber &quot;specks&quot; that had accumulated on the roof (and sunroof 
vinyl).  With the dirt rinsed away and the glass cleaned the Bus began to 
look pretty good.  It was 90/90 (heat/humidity) so I didn't finish 
cleaning the interior or start on removing the oxidation from the paint.  
I plan to remove the yellowed (formerly clear with gold &quot;starbursts&quot;) 
platic covers that have sealed the original upholstery (seats &amp; side 
panels) since the Bus was about a week old.  I appears that some sort of 
stains may have developed between the plastic and the seats, but the panels 
seem to have avoided this peril.  We'll see what tomorrow brings.

After an extensive cleaning of the interior and the initial buffing of 
the almost 33-year-old paint, I will begin to tackle the mechanical 
degradation brought on by the thirteen-year-sit.  The PO added brake 
fluid yesterday and the Bus seems to have decent &quot;pedal&quot;.  I will replace 
the rubber lines and probably the cylinders (wheel &amp; master) anyway 
(can't be too safe).  I will then remove the motor and tear it down to 
see what sort of ugliness has crept in.  I may go ahead and put a 40 HP 
motor in (that was used regularly up until a year ago) just to take this 
baby 'round the block (after the brakes are fixed, of course).

I can hardly wait!  More as it develops ...
