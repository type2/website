&gt;BTW, when you bring a car from outside CA, into the state, and register
&gt;as a permanent resident, you have to pay a $300 fine 'cuz it doesn't
&gt;have CA smog equipment on it (yes, even if its emissions meet CA levels).
&gt;My question is, if you buy a car in CA and take it to some other state,
&gt;they DO pay you $300, right? ...right?

Haha! When I bought the Pumpkin, the PO had already paid the $300 &quot;import&quot;
fine on my New Jersey bus!  And it did NOT have to meet CA emissions BECAUSE
it was an out-of-stater... just had to get within a certain range (don't ask,
I don't know).
