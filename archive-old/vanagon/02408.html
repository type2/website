Subject: Re: 1988 Syncro Pickup


Lets not talk about tarriffs, etc...another major problem goes
back to the MexiBug stuff....certification by VW to the US Federal
Safety and Environmental Nazis that the pick-up meets US stds. I suppose
one could canabalize a 1988 Vanagon, and then put all the appropriate
parts on a 1988 Pickup.
