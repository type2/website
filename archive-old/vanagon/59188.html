Subject: Re: transmission whoes

&gt;I am also in the final stages of purchasing a vanagon.  So I haven't seen
&gt;it all, I would look at these three net sites to get an idea of your
&gt;&quot;deal&quot;. http://www.traderonline_dot_com/auto/search/index.shtml and
&gt;http://www.traderonline_dot_com/rv/. Two are for autotrader's on line search
&gt;engine which covers their national data base. The first is for cars and
&gt;the second is for RV.  Dependending on your year their are usually a 100
&gt;or so 81 -91 vanagons and 5-10 westys on the list. Also Edmund's URL
&gt;http://edmunds_dot_com/edweb/used/Volkswagen/1990/VolkswagenVanagon1990.html,
&gt;will get you some price figures on your toy. I too have been scared by all
&gt;of the coolant system comments,and the Aerostar was my number 2 choice.
&gt;Bottom line for me is I have got to get this out of my system. I have been
&gt;wanting a vanagon for seven years. I hope this gets you down the road a
&gt;little more.

   finally got all my paperwork done. the bank loaned me a whopping 8k to
&gt;buy my 89 westie. I put down 1100.00 and just ordered a set of yokohama
&gt;y370s (~$385.00 mounted and stems and tax) from sears. needless to say I
&gt;am out of toy spending money.!! The dealer I bought the van from just
&gt;spend ~$300.00 on a new clutch master and slave cylinder for the
&gt;transmission and a new thermostat housing and coolant change on the
&gt;vehicle.. the kids are  whinning (when are we going to see grandma in
&gt;the new van) and now the coupe de grace..transmission is grinding from
&gt;2nd to 3rd the mech says its a synch gear..cost to fix ~$1200.00
&gt;(picture of crash and burn) from searching the archives and reading
&gt;horror stories on &quot;hiccups&quot; and motor overheating and head jobs and the
&gt;fact that special tools are neede to do this work aaannndd my local vw
&gt;dealer says his mech has never done this before,is causing serious
&gt;friction with my murphies law wife (also known as &quot;you got took&quot;
&gt;yvonne)I have done all the paperwork gotten the money, but have not
&gt;taken delivery because the dealer is willing to work with me on the cost
&gt;of repair...should I just save my money and get an Aerostar?
&gt;
&gt;desperate
&gt;89 westie hopeful
