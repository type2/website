Subject: Dash Light done -  next project

Thanks  to all on the dash light bulb replacement.  It went well and I finally
found a bulb at a non-chain auto parts store specializing in VW about four
miles  from my house.  And it only cost $0.99!  No one else carried these.

Next - 1. the silver trim, window high, which covers where the driver side door
and front panels meet comes off when driving.  What can I use to 'glue' this
back on?  Some of Marthas 3M - 90 glue?  It looks like some sort of tar was
used originally.
