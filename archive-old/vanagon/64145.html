Subject: Head Gasket Manufaacturers

Hi all:  I was wondreing if anyone knows if the Head gasket kits for
Wasserboxers that you get from aftermarket sources are built by the same
manufacturer as the kit that you get from the VW dealer? Is there only
one manufacturer of head gasket kits for these engines?
