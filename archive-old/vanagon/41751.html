Most Westfalias were made from Kombis, which had the single color paint job.
I
have seen 1 Westfalia that was made from a standard bus, a 227******. Not
only
did it have the 2-tone paint, it also had a pop-out window inside the wall
closet instead of a fixed window. It did have the wood headliner and pop-top.
Interesting indeed...

the pop out window says euro market - in N america  they put in the louvered
windows.  Did it have a locking steering column and wiring for two tone
taillights?
