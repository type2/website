Subject: Speaker Questions

The stock speakers in my '87 Westy don't sound too good (unless I completely
attenuate the bass). In the process of investigating alternatives, a couple
of questions have arisen.

1. Behind those little glued-on (seemingly) grilles are there 4&quot; speakers,
or are they some other size?

2. If they are some smaller size, has anyone mounted 4&quot; speakers in their
place, and were there any problems doing so (the one big issue I can see is
maintaining dash &amp; window crank clearance if larger grilles are required)?

3. Is there room enough in the upper cabinet on which are mounted the  rear
speakers to allow for installation of larger units, or is that space all
filled with AC equipment?

Thanks for any help!

Paul
