Subject: Bay Westy Bus Stool Purchase :-)

Hurray!  I found a reasonably priced stool (the one that fits between the
rear facing seat &amp; the fridge on the 68-71? campers).  I wouldn't have known
exactly what one looked like if I hadn't just seen a couple at the
Litchfield, CT VW show.  At the show I saw one for $40 and another for $45.
Then I'm at this tag sale/jumble sale today and what to my wandering eyes do
appear...and as I'm looking at it the guy says &quot;Do you know what that is?&quot;
So I calmly say, &quot;yeah, its a stool for a VW camper bus...&quot;  And he's so
happy it's going back into a bus and sells it to me for $5.  Now that's a
bargain.  I had to post my little buy after reading that post about someone
purchasing a westy tent at the tag sale this past week (and he doesn't have
the bus yet--God, the luck some people have).

Scour those tag sales folks!
