I'm a little worried.  I'm planning to get to BBTA, but I won't be 
leaving here until Friday the 26th, so we'll be getting there on the 27th
probably.  I would think this would really cut my chances of getting a 
camp spot during Memorial Day Weekend.  

Am I going to be stuck in St. Louis without a clue? It won't do.

Also, do I have to send any kind of registration in advance for this 
thing?  I don't see any mention of it on the text of the flyer.  Is the 
$20 at the gate, or should I send them some money?
