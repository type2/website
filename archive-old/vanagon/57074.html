Subject: 87 poptop seal replacement *questions*

I've got the seal [thanks, Ron Salmon], and replacement looks pretty
straightforward, *except* for what to do wrt damage done by the po.  When
the previous [and current] seal began to sag, lacking either respect for his
Westi or the wonderful resources of this list, he improvised by employing
*sheet metal screws* every foot or so, all the way around!

It looks terrible, sagging between each pair of screws, plus there is an
accumulation of CRUD wherever the edge is visible---looks like maybe some
adhesive residue, plus other debris.  In addition, of course, when i take
the screws out, there will be holes left behind.

I'm considering waiting for a sunny weekend and:

        1. removing the screws
        2. lifting the top a couple of inches and removing the screws 
             and old seal, then
        
        3. working my way around the edge, doing my best to remove
            the crud from the edge of the fiberglass, using, maybe, a
            *stiff brush* and some cleaning compound/s...

===&gt;  SUGGESTIONS?

        4. then, i'll lift the top, and i imagine there'll be considerable 
            residue left where the top rests, and the canvas is attached. 
            
            I could then, maybe, take a softer brush to that, and carefully 
            scrub all the way around, using something that wouldn't harm 
            the canvas...

===&gt;  SUGGESTIONS?

        5. when it's reasonably---or must it be *thoroughly*?---clean,
            i'll hose down the &quot;channel&quot; where the top/seal rests, and 
            let it dry for several hours

        6. finally, apply the new seal, probably using clear silicone gel


**QUESTION:  Is there a need to do anything about the screw holes?

**ISSUE:  I need to avoid *any* type of cleaner, solvent or adhesive 
                that would produce FUMES  [am disabled d/t respiratory 
                problems, which also limits upper body strength]

Anything I'm overlooking?  Alternative strategies?  Precautions?  All
suggestions appreciated.  
Thanks in advance.
