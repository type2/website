Subject: Cracked Syncro Clutch Housing
Found:

Two small cracks in the clutch housing, directly behind the starter motor
mount. One crack is extremely small (and probably doesn't extend inside the
housing). The other is a larger crack (I couldn't really see how big, with
what appears to be a small chunk missing, right on the edge where the
housing and the engine meet. The crack is on the top/left of the housing 
(looking at the vehicle from the front.


     Bill,
       This is not your leak! The clutch housing (Bell housing)
       has no oil in it.

       Your leak must not be real bad. Check all fluid levels
       carefully. Engine oil, transmission gear oil, etc.
       keep each one filled. Engine oil maybe changed to often
       to notice a leak. If you have each one filled don't 
       be conserned about it. 

       The only way this crack could happen is abuse
       when the transmission or motor was out of the vehicle.
       
       I have a transmission out of an 87 syncro that I have
       been parting out. It's a job to replace it but I have
       the part you need.
