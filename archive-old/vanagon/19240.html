Subject:      lotsa light

one additional &quot;trick&quot; that can be used to some extent:

put the car in reverse, so the backup lights are working, and have someone
stand directly behind the backup light ... they need to be holding or
wearing a white t-shirt or shirt or whatever, so that the backup light is
reflected into the engine compartment.

out in the darkness, you'd be surprised how much it helps. :)
