Subject: on oil level


hmmmm - i would be careful before i cut the oil level in my crankcase.

Lets be careful about this measurement of oil temperature - where
exactly is the sender located - the tempeature of the oil in
different parts of the engine can be very different.

I dont think the level would influence a dipstick type temp.
measurement as long as you were SURE the dipstick sender is
in contact with the oil - one could imagine if you lost contact 
then the temperature measured would be that of the vapours
in the crankcase.

BTW how much hotter was the oil with the level at the MAX mark -
was it still acceptable?  (leaving acceptable to be defined by
someone else rather neatly ....)
