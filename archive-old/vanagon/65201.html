      The fix is this.
      1 - change your oil every 3,000 mile.
      2 - never run any engine for a short distance.
          Always get the motor hot.

&gt; Thanks to everyone who responded to my plea for help. Thinking it was

&gt;
&gt; 1) There were some loose bolts on the exhaust manifold that he tightened
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; and
&gt;
&gt; 2) I have a stuck lifter which is causing a tapping noise. He says to
&gt; fix it I should change the oil and add some Slick 50, then let the motor
&gt; run for a while revving it occasionally until it gets unstuck. He says
&gt; this might take up to 45 minutes.
&gt;
&gt; Does this sound right?
