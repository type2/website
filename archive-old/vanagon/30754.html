Hello,

About 6 months ago, I checked the Haynes catalog at my FLAPS.  There was no 
manual listed.

I really like the Haynes manuals because they offer a different point of 
view than the factory manuals (Bentley).  They avoid special tools and I 
really enjoy their pictures; everything is dirty and greasy, just like real 
life.  However, I feel that the factory and Haynes manuals are in many ways 
compliments of each other, and I would prefer to have both.

Mike
