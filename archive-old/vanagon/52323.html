Subject: Syncro in the dunes...



I saw a Syncro in the dunes in the movie &quot;Endless Summer II&quot;.  The guys 
were in South Africa searching for the perfect wave from the original 
movie, only to find that beach now home to a resort.  But their host, 
driving the silver Syncro GL, took them across some dunes to a less crowded 
break.  

When I was a lifeguard on the beach in North Carolina I saw many types of 
vehicles get stuck and buried, from Pintos to Wranglers to Subarus to my 
VW Thing.  I don't know exactly what works.  Weight seems to help some 
trucks, keeping the wheels from spinning and digging in.  Another guy had 
a Thing with fat tires that did better than mine.  The beach patrol 
Samurai and Cherokee did great on stock tires.  But the only vehicle that 
could handle wet sand well was the Grand Wagoneer on tractor tires that 
belonged to the towing service, used to pull the rest of us out. 

Let us know how the Syncro does in the sand.  After I graduate I may head 
south and ask for my old job back...
