Subject: Neat find at local VW dealer



I was at the local VW dealer this afternoon getting the oil changed on 
my EuroVan. To kill sometime, I hung out in the parts department chewing the 
fat with the parts manager, when something caught my eye on the floor near 
his desk......a bunch of  Road Atlases with a VW breadloaf camper on the 
cover. I remembered having one in my 74 Thing years back. 

So I reached down to pick one up....on the cover is a drawing of an orange 
Westy and the legend &quot;TAKE THE BUS&quot;....inside the front cover is an ad for
the 1978 VW Campmobile Bus Champagne Edition (a Brown and white camper)..the 
inside rear cover has a camping checklist and on the back is the legend:
&quot;Volkswagen Does It Again&quot;...and of course between the covers is a standard 
1978 Rand McNally Road Atlas.

The parts manager looked over to me and said, you want a couple of them, 
they've been here a long time....

Needless to say I took 2 (not to be a pig...)!
