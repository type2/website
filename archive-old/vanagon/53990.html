Subject: Re: Nervous about heads


Here's what I've been thinking about doing, of course I don't make a move
without consulting you wonderfull people:)  Since my westfalia tends to
sit for months at a time, then be used for several months then sit again,
I thought that I should just drain the coolant out of it altogether while
it's sitting then refill when I know that I will be using it.  That way no
corrosion would occur while it's sitting, and I would be sure to change
the coolant at least once a year.  Of course this will be time consuming
and probably cause some inconvenience, but nothing compared to BIG BIG
$$$$ for new heads, or BIG BIG agravation to do the J.B.Weld fix.  So what
does everyone think??  TIA

&gt; Change the coolant once a year (if at all possible, two might be OK), and 
&gt; use the blue (Autobahn) stuff.
&gt; This should help stave off the corroding of the head gaskets (and heads).
&gt; 
&gt; That's my two cents.
