Subject: 84 GL Resurrection

In Dec 95 my GL's clutch died as I exited a freeway.  Back then I got a lot 
of advise from the group on slave cylinder and master cylinder replacement.  
I did the slave cylinder (having experienced its failure with past 
vehicles).  Well the hydraulic side of things works, but the clutch doesn't 
disengage.  The GL has been parked all this time.  Now I'm unloading a 
couple of vehicles in my fleet and I'm ready to turn my attention back to 
the Vanagon.  Since the engine has only fired once in the last 16 months I 
figured I better do a bit of maintenance first.  I plan to change out the 
oil and filter and siphon out any old gas.  Is there anything else I should 
be concerned about?  Once this is done I plan to drag to a shop to have the 
clutch work done. After that I need to re-tire and stick in whole new 
exhaust.  Then, with a little luck it'll be back on the road.  I just can't 
bear to part with it.  I figure I could always use it as a guest room (its a 
weekender).  If anyone has any thoughts on the clutch I'd appreciate 
hearing.
