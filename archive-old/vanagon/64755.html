Subject:      Door vents and shrinking parts

I can't wait for one of the Westy owners with shrinking parts to notice
that they have a door vent!!  My 73 Westy had shrinking trim, never gave
it a thought. The gap in the trim on the table is there so you know where
the milk your kid spills will exit the table and you can place a bucket
below. The gap in the trim around the closet doors is to allow the doors
to close without cracking a window.

 Haven't spent more than 2 minutes contemplating the door vent. Only door
on any of my vans, from day one to present, that would close easily
without cracking a window is the slider, vent open or closed.

It's refreshing to note that so many of our listees have so few problems.

Hey maw, I'm agoin out to work on da Van, whar's dem funny cigeretts??
