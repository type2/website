Jeff,

Having had a 73 Bus for 7 years and now an 85 Vanagon, I can honestly
say that out here in the midwest the cops don't even see 'em.  Now,
none of these vehicles had/have any psychedelic artwork, Deadhead
stickers or any other eye-catching logos on 'em.  In fact, I have
never but stopped on any Interstates, and it isn't due to a lack of
trying.  I think there must be something in the cop computer that
says VW Buses can barely make it over the next rise, so don't harrass
them on the downhill-side or level ground.  Or maybe they just don't
show-up on radar.

Ted
