&gt; These car talk guys slam the VW vans every chance they get, advising people
&gt; that the only good thing about the vans is that you can sleep in them when
&gt; they break down. I am not sure I can disagree with them technically, although
&gt; they haven't addressed the matter of heart.

Right On! Derek!  ;)

I agree.  They're always slamming VWs.  Just last week the first thing they
tried to get the caller to do was get rid their van.  Then they found out
after some discussion that the mechanic that had worked on the car probably
did the rebuild wrong and that was what was causing the engine to overheat.
So why blame VW when the mechanic was at fault?

I also feel that they give mis-information on other cars too.  Esplecially
when it comes to recommendations about cars for people who want to buy
a car for traveling in South America or Africa.  They always recommend
the Toyota Landcruiser or the Range Rover.  Gimme a break.  In almost
every documentary film I've seen about those continents there is always
a VW Vanagon or bus in the background.  They VW Type II is the true
work horse of the backcountry.  They're easy to maintain and parts are
available world wide.  So why the Landcruiser?  I have no idea.  I've
never seen one in the documentarys.  I have seen Range Rovers but they
are far more expensive than the good ole VW.  

And I'm sick and tired of them recommending the stupid Volvo.  Talk about
&quot;UGLY&quot;.  I know it's suppose to be safer than most vehicles but jesus!
At least the VW has some practicality to off-set it's less than attractive
looks.  I'm sorry but the Volvo is over-rated by them and the VW is
definately under-rated.  IMO, they just don't know how to work on
VWs and so they bad-mouth it instead.
