The noise may be coming from a bouncing pop-top roof. The air pressure
build up while driving can lift the roof. When air escapes the roof
vibrates. Tie down the roof and see if the noise stops.

&gt; Hi,
&gt; my 85 Westy has a nasty habit of creating a very loud vibration right
&gt; above my head when I take her up over seventy. I thought it might be
&gt; the bungy cords I have up there but when I took them off it was much
&gt; worse...sometimes it creates just a slight vibrational noise, other
&gt; times like a jackhammer...what's going on? Thanks for any advice,
