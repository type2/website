Subject: Re: Greasing rear wheels

&gt; My '71's rear wheels need greasing.  Has anyone out there done this job.
&gt; Is it fairly straight forward or is getting to the inside bearing a
pain? &gt; According to the manual I need a special puller to press the axle
shaft &gt; out of the bearings and bearing housing...is that right? &gt;

Kinda right.

The RIGHT way to do the regrease is to get that 22 foot cheater pipe
out of the garage and have at the back axle nuts.

CAUTION: DO NOT torque on these nuts without someone up front stomping
on the brake. Hard. If you dont, you can stress the differential,
the CVs develope microflats, and gremlins move into the bus for good.
Trust me, do this. The brake hardware can handle it, the CVs cant.

The, you gotta pull the hub off (It should come off, I never had
to use a puller, just a piece of 2x4x4' to bop it through.
Take the CVs off first, and dont forget to clean the hex holes out
with a paperclip first.

BUUUUUUUT: There is an easier way, if there have been no indications
of wear, you just wanna grease it. You dont have to take the axle off,
just the nut. Take the nut off and the washer under it.

I use a grease needle. I stick it between each roller bearing until it bottoms
out, and pump new grease in behind the old grease. Wheel bearing grease is
tough to pump, and I use the salt-resistant stuff for trailers. I gotta
pack the tube myself, as it only comes in tubs. But still pretty cheap.
Just keep pumping the clean grease in behind the bearings, and it
will flush most of the goooky brown stuff out the front. Wipe that off and
keep pumping. I used about 16 oz per side. Pump until the grease
flows clean. 

The second approach may be a Muldoon fix, but it means not having to
remove the CVs, the bearing stuff, dealing with shims, circlips,
grease seals, etc. But, you may not have to drive your beast every
day, have a flat, hard place to park it out of the rain, 
non-stripped CV bolts, and time to do the job right. 

Just in case you were wondering, Muldoon is actually my middle name.
Funny but true. And VERY prophetic.
