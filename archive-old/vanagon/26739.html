Well, my '84 Vanagon Gl turned 166,000 miles this weekend as we 
&quot;motored&quot; to northern Minnesota to my father's house.  
As a reward, the van got christened &quot;Stewball&quot; (I hope I spelled that 
right) by my wife.

Old Stewball was a racehorse
And I wish he were mine
He never drank water
He always drank wine.
