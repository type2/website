Subject: Re: restoring interior chrome

WRT the exterior chrome strips that are inserted in all window rubber
moulding and that have lost their &quot;finish&quot;; is there a way to restore,
paint or rechrome them? We will be removing all of these when we repaint
the Westy; and are toying with the idea of painting them all black. Did post
85 (?) Westies get the all black treatment? Comments; suggestions?
Sorry if this was a thread a while back...
PS my view is that chrome trim around any window makes it appear larger
than one that does not have the trim. OTOH Black trim windows of the
same size appear smaller
than those with chrome trim (ie SAABS). This may be an optical
illusion....TIA  - DC
