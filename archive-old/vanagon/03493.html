O.K.  I checked the tires I had to get since they are impossible to find
in So. Cal.  Hope I don't live to regret it, but the are Sumitomo's.
As I said before, these are six-ply's.  I had to get something because
my Continentals were showing through and it was a day before my week long
surfing road trip began (BTW- the Sumitomos made it 800 miles that week).
Knock on wood.

&gt;
&gt; Regarding the Dunlop tires I bought when I couldn't find replacement
&gt; Michelins:
&gt;
&gt; The sidewalls show:
&gt;
&gt; Dunlop SP LT5 Tubeless
&gt; 185R14  6 P.R. LT Load Range C
&gt; Steel Belted Radial
&gt; 4 Plies Tread - 2 Polyester + 2 Steel
&gt; 2 Plies Sidewall - 2 Polyester
&gt;
&gt; Capacity 1600 Lbs. _at_ 50 PSI cold
&gt;
&gt; Sorry about my previous smart-ass comment on the British.  Turns out
&gt; THESE Dunlops say &quot;Made In Japan&quot;.
&gt;
&gt; The tires were actually IN STOCK at a local independent (but large) tire
&gt; store.  I think I paid about $80 each, including tax, mounting, stems,
&gt; dynamic off-car balancing, and old tire disposal fee.
&gt;
&gt; Like I said, so far I am happy - they seem to be better than the OEM
&gt; Michelins.  The Michelins squealed a lot during sharp but low-speed turns
&gt; when inflated to the door-sticker pressures - the Dunlops don't.  The
&gt; Dunlops are also quieter on wet pavement, yet I haven't noticed any
&gt; hydroplaning or other traction problems.
&gt;
&gt; I don't see the phrase &quot;reinforced&quot; on the sidewalls.  I can't remember if
&gt; the original (1982) Michelin's said &quot;reinforced&quot; either.  I DO know they
&gt; said Load Range C.
