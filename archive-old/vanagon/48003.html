&gt;Highbeam works with flasher only also the fans and wiper only work when 
&gt;flasher stalk is held up

Look at two things:
1. Ignition switch, which disengages power to these items when in the
starting position through the Load Reduction Relay, and (you guessed it)
2. The Load Reduction Relay itself.  This relay activated by the starting
position of the ignition switch prevents power from going to these items
while you're starting the van.
