Subject: cleaning floor mats/head liner/package rack

I am wondering if anyone has any tips on cleaning floor mats.  I have the 
big rubber mat up front and completely covering that is a two piece 
tightly woven grass mat.  the rubber mat has proven to be a challenge 
because of the shear mass of it's filth and all those crevaces.  The 
grass mat isn't quite so gross but I don't have any experience with this 
kind of material.  It seems to be in really good condition and I am 
tempted to just go at it with the garden hoze and laundry detergent but 
the thing is 25 years old. Any ideas?   I also have a really grubby 
package rack.  it is made from that white stretchy nylon stuff and it 
looks like more than a few oily parts were left on it.  Any clue how to 
clean that thing?  O yeah, what is a good cleaner for all the noggahyde 
and pleather apholstry and interrior pannels.
thanks.
Ed.
