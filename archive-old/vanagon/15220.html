So Christopher Bridge says:
&gt; valves to seat right and dismissed it.  Not so, the seats were _never_ 
&gt; replaced with oversized ones!  It looks like the valves in a stock 1600 head 
&gt; were just replaced with the larger valves.  So, what to do?  This is very 
&gt; low class work, and I still can't believe someone would do this.  
&gt; 
&gt;Should I just send them a nasty-gram, of what?
&gt; 
&gt; BTW- The place is called &quot;Performance Specialties&quot; aka &quot;The Latest Rage.&quot;  I 
&gt; would advise that nobody do business with them.

Why a &quot;knee-jerk nasty gram first?  Why not contact them directly and tell 
them what you found and see how they react first?  (Please note: I'm giving 
this advise to myself as well as you.)  Also, please excuse me if I've missed
a previous part of the thread where you may have already been nice about it.

But.... I'd let them know of all the inconvenience that their motor has 
caused you and at least give them a chance to handle it the right way.
Then, if they don't, you can start getting tough with them.  Sending
certified letters and keeping good record of yours and their correspon-
ence will help your case if you ever have to take it that far.  But
at least give them a chance to correct what's wrong first.
