Subject: Re: Cooling system drivel (getting shorter...)

Actually, the front heater loop is separate from the radiator loop, so 
even when the thermostat is closed (and coolant does not flow to the 
radiator) the heater should still have flow and be warm. (Look underneath 
and you'll see two big hoses going forward ((radiator)) and two smaller 
hoses routed with them ((heater.))
