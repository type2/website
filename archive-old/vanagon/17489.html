David S. suggested:

&gt; As for the metal behind the seat, your best
&gt;bet would be to rent one of those power cutting disc things, but you could
&gt;probably use frameless hacksaw also, if you have, oh, 8 hours to do it.  :)

So, do we know it is OK to remove that thang? Doesn't it provide some sort
of structural support, or is it a useless evolutionary remnant?
