Subject: Re: Cooling System Opinion

I don' thinks so Mark: An annode would have to be an undissolved piece
of metal that is sacrificed by dissolving instead of something else. I
am familiar with the concept, as Alfa-Romeo used the same concept in
their engines, with a replaceable sacrificial annode that screwed into
the cylinder head or block. What's wrong here is that there is no such
replaceable piece.

I think that VW has short-life, special coolant and obsure rules and
guidelines cause they were new at the water-cooled game at the time, and
the questionable design of the Vanagon motor was turning out to be a
problem. This way, they can insist that we broke the rules when engines
fail right and left.  &quot;Use our stuff or else&quot; they can insist, and when
we have problems, VW can blame some previous owner who put in Kmart
coolant.

They never did get it right, either. A Subaru for mine when this
happens.

&gt; I have read and read about the coolant corrosion problem and wanted to
&gt; add
&gt; my thoughts since I not had heard this type of comment.
&gt;
&gt; My feelings on the coolant issue are because of the propriatary nature
&gt; of
&gt; the manufacturers formula, I bought the Autobahn stuff. I feel if I'm
&gt; gonna
&gt; pay an extra $15, it is cheap insurance against a hedge in replacing
&gt; heads
&gt; et al. Also I'm going with the distilled water too.
&gt;
&gt; It seems that the corrosive nature of this system could use every
&gt; possible
&gt; precaution.  On this feeling, I have a hunch,and it is without proof,
&gt; that
&gt; the factory coolant may have a &quot;sacrifical anode&quot; ingredient. On salt
&gt; water
&gt; marine engines which suffer the corrosive engine problem, a sacrifical
&gt;
&gt; anode, usually a piece of zinc about 3lbs in weight is attatched to
&gt; the
&gt; engine. I guess the metalugical deal is that since zinc's atomic
&gt; number is
&gt; closer to lead, the base, the &quot;corrosive&quot; action prefers the zinc to
&gt; the
&gt; alloys in the 2 stroke engine.
&gt;
&gt; It would be a smart thing IMO to add this type of scarificial anode to
&gt; the
&gt; VW coolant. I repeat that I do not know for sure they have it,
&gt; everybody's
&gt; so cloak and dagger about what is in their stuff. But I'm going to go
&gt; that
&gt; way. The &quot;clue&quot; for me was that the factory stuff has a &quot;short&quot; life,
&gt; replace every two years.  When manufactures are making long life
&gt; coolant
&gt; why place the short limit? My guess is that since all sacrifical
&gt; anodes by
&gt; design are depleted, that the 2 year life is to replinish the anode.
&gt; I'll
&gt; post this mental meandering for others to comment and refine. I
&gt; mentioned
&gt; this topic once and got no response.
&gt;
&gt; I've heard on the list of several motors that used either distilled
&gt; water
&gt; or the original stuff go well past the service life of non such
&gt; systems.  I
&gt; realize that since water around the world varies greatly that it alone
&gt;
&gt; could be variable in whether say an owner used Autobahn, and local
&gt; water,
&gt; but still had a head leak.  Back to my original feeling. This system
&gt; needs
&gt; every possible precaution done to help it.
