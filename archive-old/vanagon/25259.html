Subject: VW Reviews

Yesterday I wrote

&gt;Road and Track published their VW reviews in a two volume set running from the
&gt;fifties to the eighties (maybe  there is a third volume by now) even includes
a
&gt;comparison with a DKW van. I have copies of these volumes, and I can supply
the
&gt;full refrences to these --- tomorrow (I didn;t bring them to work with me).

Well there are actually three volumes

Road &amp; Track on Volkswagen 1951-1968 ISBN 0 948207 60 4
          ditto            1968-1978 ISBN 0 948207 61 2
          ditto            1978-1985 ISBN 0 948207 62 0

Published by
Brookland Books
Holmerise, Seven Hills Road
Cobham, Surrey KT11 1ES,
England

Distributed by
Road &amp; Track
1499 Monrovia,
Newport Beach
California 92651

You can get them in any motoring book shop. These volumes cover all VW's but
are a bit scarce on second generation transporters (plenty of Vanagons though).
Brookland also publish transporter only volumes, that cover a lot more than
Road &amp; Track. Somebody else mentioned this yesterday, but I accidently deleted
the post so I'm not sure who it was.

As an aside I have owned the following in times gone by

					    	72 Microbus
						75 Microbus
						78 Camper (local conversion)
						84 Caravelle CL
						87 Caravelle GL
