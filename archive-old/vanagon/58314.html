Subject: Re: Yokohama Y370 Tire Discontinued

Kelly-I went through H--- to get these tires.  I started ordering them
through my local tire dealer I had done business with for 30 years. 
After waiting a month they said they didn't make them any more and were
sending another one.  I said NO YOU DON'T!  I got on the phone with
Yokohama and spoke with a real nice guy (don't remember his name) He
said they were still in production but scarce.  He found 4 in Atlanta GA
and told me to go to Sears, which I did.  They had them in 6 days.  Best
investment I ever made.  All this was thanks to the direction of Harold
Teer teerhb_at_imu_dot_edu.  Keep trying, try Sears, don't give up, they are
worth it!
Good Luck
