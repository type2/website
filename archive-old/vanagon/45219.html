&gt;If you would like to find out more about this undertaking please write to

&gt;Michael Steinke
&gt;c/o Westfalia Registry
&gt;Hagebuttenweg 10
&gt;60433 Frankfurt
&gt;Germany

&gt;From my ham radio hobby, I know that the minimum airmail postage cost from
Germany to the USA (for a 1/2 ounce letter, I think) is now almost US $2.
If you write to Michael, you may want to be nice to him and include a couple
of one dollar bills, or perhaps even a five dollar bill to cover his postage
cost. I'll bet he'd also appreciate a self-addressed envelope or a stick-on
label with your address on it.
