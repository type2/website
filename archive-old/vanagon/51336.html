Subject: Corvair Parts? (no VW content)

A friend called tonight and he has been offered a dead Corvair van.  Does
anyone have any leads on parts (especially engine parts) for a '63
Greenbriar?  I don't know for sure which engine it has, but I'll assume
it's a 110 horse.  They were the most common.

It's not a splitty, but the price is very right.

Thanks in advance.

Jim Arnott
