Subject: Re: AAA info request.. 

 Here's my 2% of the $'s worth,

 AAA does not only &quot;help&quot; with the towing of vehicles but has more resources
to be explored. After a few years of paying them for not using their
services, I figured I needed to get some money back. So, to make a long
story short, I decided to give them a call and had them send me ALL of the
booklets that they have related to camping grounds not only in the US but
Canada, as well. It involves about 10 booklets filled with information of
many campgrounds in the nation. The cost of these little darlings if bought
from another source is about $5 per book. They have other things that are
sent if asked. Nothing is automatic with AAA. So, if you feel that you are
paying enough money and getting nothing, call them or go to their nearest
office and inquire about anything that you can take home without dishing out
any more money. I feel that it is a way to get something back for the money
that I have &quot;given&quot; them.

 Go for it now!
