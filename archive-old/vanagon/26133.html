&gt;Subject: (fwd) rare transporter
&gt;
&gt;I recently found an old, interesting vw transport.  The owner says it is a 50 
&gt;or 51, and it looks quite old.  The thing that confirms it's older, at least
&gt;older than anything I've seen, is the engine cover.  It is about twice as high
&gt;as a normal engine cover, and the whole engine compartmant is huge.  All of 
&gt;the parts are there, including all the glass and semaphores (or whatever those
&gt;turn signal things are called.  Anyways, I was wondering if anyone could give
&gt;me some more info on it.  Or, if anybody is interested in buying it, give me 
&gt;a call, or drop me a letter. Whatever.  It is way in the far north of Michigans
&gt;upper penisula.
