Subject: Ethanol



Hi Dave,
       I read your posting on a gopher site concerning ethanol. I
am a firm believer in ethanol. The average vehicle requires little
in the way of modification to use it. Carb jets must be widened and
gaskets must be ethanol capable. Other than that I am not aware of 
any thing else to be done to a gas engine. I do not believe that 
ethanol is corrosive to engines. I have never heard of any direct
proof of that. It is corrosive to certain gasket material. There is
a certain element in big business that is against ethanol and I am
certain that's where the rumour about corrosion got started.
      Tests in Nebraska a number of years ago showed 18% more con-
sumption of ethanol over gasoline but there was an 18% increase in
power to offset that. 
      Ethanol uses a little over 7 pounds of oxygen per gallon to 
burn while petroleum fuels use 14 pounds.
      ethanol requires a maximum temperature of 173 deg F to distill.
Cracking crude oil requires a far higher temp. This makes ethanol
possible using solar power technology. Also ethanol can be made from
virtually any flora biomass with varying degrees of recovery. For
instance; 1 ton of sugar beet will produce 300  gals of ethanol.
One ton of wood will produce 60 gals of ethanol.
      Big business and governments keep pushing towards methanol.
Methanol is toxic. It can cause blindness and is highly carcinogenic.
It is very complex and expensive to produce. It serves the same pur-
pose as petroleum as far as business and government are concerned.
Anyone can produce ethanol but it requires a major corporation to 
produce petroleum fuels or methanol.
      One other thing I would like to point out is that the internal
combustion engine was originally designed to run on ethanol. Running
an engine on straight gasoline or on straight ethanol will give better
performance than trying to run the same engine on a mix of the two.
This is why ethanol blended gasolines tend to give crappy performance.
