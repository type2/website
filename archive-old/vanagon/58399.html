Gilbert, welcome to the Vanagon list! I have been a member for over
two years and have found it to be the best source of information about
my Vanagon available. You will also find a bunch of the nicest people
here that you could ever ask to meet.

Good luck in obtaining that dream bus you described to us. Let us know
how it goes.
