FALLINS ADOPT VW CAMPER VAN
...Steve Dusts off Birkenstocks, Gets &quot;Back to Where He Once 
Belonged&quot; while Liz says &quot;What Took You So Long?&quot;
...Will They Head to Haight-Ashbury?

DATELINE FALLS CHURCH, VA.  

In a highly planned fit of enthusiasm, Steve, Liz, and Brendan Fallin 
have  adopted a Volkswagen Westfalia Camper Van from New York State.  
The van, an '84 Westy Wolfsburg Edition, has been dubbed Bombadil, 
after Tom Bombadil,  a favorite Tolkien character.

The Fallins located the van in true retro 90's style...via the 
Internet.  After months of searching online and in trade rags, their 
new mobile was discovered in Brewster, NY, about an hour north of New 
York City.

Jim Cristantiello, the previous owner, is a resto nut, and has 
brought several VWs back from the grave.  This one was discovered 
practically unused, but very neglected, and over the years Jim 
polished, tweaked, and accessorized it into the van it is today.

Bombadil arrived in Falls Church with 70,000 miles on the body, and 
32,000 miles on a new engine.  The Fallins plan to add to that total 
with a number of summer and fall camping trips.

&quot;This is really the one for us,&quot; said Steve.  &quot;The pieces fell into 
place, and it fits very well with where we want to be as a family.&quot;

As to rumors of &quot;just throwing it all away&quot; and becoming vagabonds, 
the Fallins say that's a bit exaggerated.  But they have a definite 
goal in mind...they plan to teach eight-month-old Brendan the meaning 
of &quot;ROAD TRIP!!!&quot;.  He's well on his way, too...he already has his 
first piece of tie-dye.
