Subject: Distributed Inductance Ignition Wires
Date: Mon, 20 Mar 95 12:18:00 MST


Hello,

There has been some discussion of ignition wires.  At 73,000 miles, my '84 
is going to be a candidate for them soon.  In other cars, I replaced the 
original distributed or lumped resistance wires with distributed (lossy) 
inductance wires.  The primary reason for going to these wires is that they 
are far less prone to conductor failure than the distributed resistance 
wires and have lower radio emissions than the lumped resistance wires.  As I 
recall, Bendix is one of several brands.

Has anyone had any experience with these wires in Vanagons?  Do I trash the 
metal shields?  etc.?

Thanks,
Mike
