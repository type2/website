Subject: Bug fuel prob?

        I stopped to help a guy today who's 70 bug had died on him. Heres
the problem, fuel had been pumped into the oil, was backfiring badly, the
engine wouldn't idle or after some time even turn over. He said it had been
galloping on him so I checked timing which was right on. Then I checked
compression and #3 tested at 75 the rest 110-120. We checked the float and
pin on the carb and both were OK. It has a new brazilian fuel pump, rebuilt
distributer, and rebuilt carb. So anyways I couldn't figure out what was
wrong with it but I was hoping that someone could give me some other
possibilities to look at. Thanks in advance for any help.
