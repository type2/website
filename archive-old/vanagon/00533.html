Subject: replacing fuel lines
Date: Sat, 23 Apr 1994 23:21:02 -0500 (EST)


The fuel lines in my 76 camper (the braided cloth over rubber lines) are
looking kind of shabby, and I think there's a leak by the distributor.  (the
cold-start-valve???)  Anyway, I was thinking about replacing them, especially
considering the stories I've heard about them catching on fire.

Do I have to get special lines or clamps?  (The bentley book said 35 psi...)
Does anyone know the amount and diameters of line needed?
Is there some special kit?  (unlikely...)
Has anyone done this before???

Thanks-
