&gt;When I start my engine after it has sat all night (ie. a cold start) it will

&gt;engine has warmed up, then it runs fine.
&gt;
&gt;I think this is because of a bad coolant temp sensor (sender?).  Since it is

&gt;bad, the default setting is for a running engine and when cold the engine 
&gt;requires a richer mix.  Without the input from the temp sensor the engine 
&gt;runs as if it were warm (to lean) and stalls.

Since the operation of the temperature sensor is a variable resistance you
can diagnose it (roughly) by removing the temperature sensor wire.  When the
sensor is cold it has a high resistance and as the engine warms the
resistance drops.  You can create an artificially high resistance (infinite)
by disconnecting the wire.  This infinite resistance will be much higher than
a properly operating temperature, but the computer should be tricked into
thinking that the engine is very cold and richen the mixture.

G'luck!
