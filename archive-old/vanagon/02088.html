Well... don't forget that old buses don't go very fast.  I'm spinning 
about 4000 RPM at 60 MPH, so I rarely exceed 70 (4500 RPM).

On the cross country note, I'd like to do it, and I'll mail a note to the 
Martha/David entity.  I drove my Chevy from PA-&gt;NY-&gt;CT-&gt;VY-&gt;CA when I got 
it.  I camped all the way, and slept in the car a couple times.  I've 
been thinking that I'd like to drive my bus to RI, but I haven't gotten 
around to it.  I'm rebuilding my motor right now, so it will be broken-in 
by next Summer.  :)
