&gt; &gt; That said, with all the buses burning to the ground, engine and electrical
&gt; &gt; problems I've read about, I'd like for list members to tell us why they
&gt; &gt; stay with VWs -- some more positive messages, for balance.

How do you describe an ethos?  Maybe all older car owners feel through 
their cars to a sense of a different time, a different world.  Maybe 
there's a mythos as well that an older car has as halo, a dream you enter 
when you get behind the wheel.

I know that growing up in the S.F. Bay Area and getting my first bus at 21
in 1973 involved both ethos and mythos.  Long hair, good pot, no
particular place to go.  Three trips cross country, one of which lasted
almost a year because my generator went out and I had no money to make it
back to California.  Boston wasn't such a nice place to spend the winter. 
Kansas City was a nice place to spend the spring and summer.  Four of us 
careening through Mexico for two months, searching for the perfect beach, 
the perfect village.  We found it.  We parked the bus, built a palapa, a 
palm frond shack off the side of the bus.  It had shelves and a window.  
A family adopted us and we ate two meals a day with them in their open 
air, sand floor restaurant/home.  75 cents a day for food.  

I am in grad school, 2 years from the terminal ph.d.  I never bought into,
nor do I intend to buy into, the ethic of consumption.  While I don't own
a bus now, if I'm funded next year, I will treat myself this spring and
get another old bus.  Part of it is the mythos.  But mostly it's the
realization we're feeding off the top of the food chain when we buy a new,
or even newer car.  The &quot;rational&quot; argument for vegetarianism says why eat
meat when you can feed far more people with the grain the steer ate? It's 
uneconomical to eat meat if other people's hunger matters at all to you.  

There's also a sense of not being a victim that owning a car you can work 
on engenders.  I owned an 82 diesel vanagon I felt a victim of.  My 66 
camper bus had only one black hole, the transaxle, and apparently, 
reading the posts from this discussion group, this is not a black hole 
anymore.  The sense of competence maintaining a complicated artifact of 
civilization develops is counter to how we seem to be expected to feel in 
the 1990s.  

It seems that some of us base our identities in having a new car, or the
fastest, most powerful computer.  We work jobs that operate in crisis
mode.  We find relief in the gleaming newness of a possession.  Some of
us, maybe through experience, learn to chuckle and realize that &quot;being a
mechanic&quot; in the fullest sense of the word, is farm more satisfying than
&quot;being a victim of a mechanic&quot;. 

And if when I'm headed up a dirt road on the east side of Cascades and 
the bus stops running, I don't get angry or frustrated.  I expect the 
worst, and plan for it, while hoping for the best.  It's all part of the 
grand adventure we calling life.  

Maybe part of the mythos of owning an older bus is this sort of 
attitude.   We only live once.  The social world wants us to speed up.  
Owning an older bus makes us slow down.  

While I sit on the side of that dirt road, broken down, I grab my 
sweeties warm hand and staring out across the canyon say, &quot;God it's good 
to be alive&quot;.
