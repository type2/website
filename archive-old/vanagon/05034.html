&gt; &gt;Anyone seen any of the plate-like vanagon hubcaps at a salvage yard?
&gt; 
&gt; check the yellow pages for Hubcaps (might be under Automobiles - Used and
&gt; Rebuilt Parts ... or something like that). some places specialize in hubcaps
&gt; and they don't always know what car they came off. most any 14-inch cover
&gt; should work. you might even find some you like better. ;)
&gt; 

Speaking of 14&quot; wheels, I've heard that certain model Fords are replacements for
the same size van wheels.  Anyone know this for sure?
&gt;
