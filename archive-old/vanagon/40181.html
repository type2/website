&gt; &gt;Will 215/70 14's fit ok on a Bus?  My '72 to be exact?  Would there be
&gt; &gt;any wheel well clearances?  Or is 205/70 about as big as you can go?
&gt; &gt;Would like to try some 215/70s from Goodyear (The Workhorse label) but
&gt; &gt;would hate to have problems due to size.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt;
&gt; The 215/70-14 will work fine.  The extra size will compensate for the reduced
&gt; load range of the standard tire.  Even though this is a truck labeled tire,
&gt; it is actually rated as a pasenger car tire, load range B.  Truck rated tires
&gt; have the size marked with an LT. Pasenger cars are marked with the P.  When
&gt; using the P standard tires, they must be de-rated 10% when used on a light
&gt; truck.  Considereing all this, a good set of high performance tires will
&gt; probably give a better ride and handling over the &quot;Work horses&quot;.  Pirelli
&gt; makes a tire called the APT400 in this size.  It is called a light truck
&gt; touring tire.  May be worth checking out.  Goodyear aquatreads work well
&gt; also.  Yokohama A378 is available in this size and only costs about $60.  H
&gt; speed rating also.  Hope some of this helps.

I am using a 205\75 on my 73 bus with no problems....I guess you could
calculate if that's bigger or smaller than a 215\70...
