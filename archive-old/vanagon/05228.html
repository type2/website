Martha eschews:

&gt;Every time you guys do something to publically denegrate my worth,
&gt;I'm putting on one more flannel shirt layer.


Ok, first off, as I learned in law school: &quot;Truth is a Defense!!&quot;,

second, Martha, that isn't a flannel shirt you should be putting
on, it should be a hair shirt....  8-)

besides, whatkinda wommin drives around in a VW Van willing to
pose in front of it in ANY type of attire...ok...maybe Cheap
doesn't do it....howabout:

Flat-Four-Floozie????
