Subject: Electric Window on the Fritz
From: chawk_at_juno_dot_com (j g shepard)

Hey Vanagoneers,

The right side electric window does not want to go down in my 88. I've
checked the switch and jumped power to the motor but it still doesn't
work. Anybody have any ideas? By the way, I found some tires for the
Van. Michelin LTX 195/75/14. They work really well but they wern't
cheap.

Justin
