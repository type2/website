Wendy,  another Wendy with an '85 Westy!  
We have the camper manual and I would be glad to photo copy the pages you
need.  Just let me know if you still need them and I'll get them off in the
mail.  I have a photo copier so it won't take long.  Do you need any info
about the fridge?  We have that too if you need it.
