&gt;
&gt;Comes with: Supercharger, all linkage, mounts, oiler, aircleaner
&gt;and double pulleys w/ belts.  Includes copies of original instructions.
&gt;
&gt;All parts are original and in great shape.  Blower pictured on 59 conv.
&gt;in June 1994 VW Trends magazine.  Increases power by a whooping 50%.
&gt;54 hp... impress your friends.  &quot;wow!... this one has AC&quot;
&gt;

...yes, but will it give my brick an extra 27hp or an extra half on top
of whatever it is that it has now?  ;^)

But then again, do I want my engine sounding like a bunch of crazed
Aggies?  (Subtle pun in that one, non-Texans need not apply  ;^) ;^)

Joachim (who's not really Texan either)
