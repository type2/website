Subject: Replacing fuel lines

My quest to become a nonWanaBuser continues.  I'm looking at
a nice '72 camper which has only been occasionally used the
past few years, and the owner can't get it to start, except
by misting gasoline right into the carbs but then is stalls
right away.  The theory was bad fuel pump, but I thought more
likely clogged line or filter--so I'm rooting around in there and
one of the fuel lines to the carb snaps right off, it was so cracked
and flaking.  I think--good thing it wouldn't start because there
would have been a fire!

I like this bus enough that I want to replace the fuel lines 
so my questions are--I've traced the lines leaving the fuel pump
going up but would like advice on how to get at them up by
the carbs:  should I start by removing the air cleaner and is
it right back there or is it better to try and remove some engine
tin and get in from below.  Does this question make any sense?
The line leaves the fuel pump and vanishes up; the lines leave
the carbs and vanish down and FRONT.  There's all this stuff in
the way, argh.  Don't any of you 73-and-on people start gloating
about your access hatches.

Also--I'm planning on taking the old lines to my FLAPS and getting
some fuel hose there, I don't need any special VW-approved hose do I?

Also--The gas tank was empty and the owner put a quart or so in.  I 
know gas is getting to the fuel pump (started to spill when I undid
the hoseclamp) but how worried should I be about gunk and crud?  I
don't think it was started for a year.

thanks in advance--you all are great--

soon to be a nonWanabuser?

P.S. some of you will remember I was looking at a '72 a few months
ago (thanks all for the replies)--I was pretty excited about 
that bus but when I told the owner I wanted to have a mechanic
look at it he got all weird and never called me back.  Hmm.
