Subject: 83 Vanagon For Sale

I posted this a few weeks ago but upon further review the van is not in
as good a shape as I thought. I think that the throwout bearing is
starting to go. At this point I think the van probably will need a
engine rebuild soon (currently at 90K on the 1st rebuild). The van has a
1.9 engine with many new parts. I do not have the time or facilities to
part out the van. $600 to someone in the Denver, CO area?
