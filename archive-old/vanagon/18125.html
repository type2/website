Subject:       RE: Re-organization of rec.autos.vw, PLEASE READ

&gt; How about rec.autos.vw.aircooled
&gt;                   .aircooled.van
&gt;               .watercooled
&gt;               .watercooled.van
&gt;               .events
&gt;               .misc
&gt;               .forsale
&gt; 
&gt; Since it looks like developing a new group it might as well be split up 
&gt; as much as possible. That way one could subscribe by their interests.

No, I don't think we are splitting it up enough.  My suggestion:

rec.auto.vw.aircooled
           .aircooled.bus.50
                         .51
                         .52
                         .53
                         .(etc.year of bus)
           .aircooled.van
           .aircooled.bug
           .aircooled.type3
           .watercooled.van
           .watercooled.all.others.that.I_dot_can't.think.of.right.now
           .events
           .misc
           .forsale
           .wtb
          
That sounds great to me!  We could effectively turn one news-group 
into 100's of little ones!  Then no one could complain...

ACK!
