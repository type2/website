Subject: '71 VW Camper Bus for sale in NJ - must go!
Date: 19 Mar 1996 10:51:45 -0500

I've posted before, and this is the last time!  If we don't sell
it, we're donating it to a charity for a tax break.

Goods things about the bus:

rebuilt engine about 3 years ago
excellent mechanical condition
comes with vw and muir manuals
no leaks
cot in pop-top in great condition
comes with extra engine
spare tire on front

Not so good things:

needs new engine seal
canvas and screens in top torn - not excessively
rust
no accesories (table, etc.)
must be towed
primer color
brake lights need work


All of this for $400.  We have too many cars (seven!) and must
sell some of them.  Buy it, fix the seal and lights, sell it for $800.
We don't have the time or knowledge.  It's a cute bus.  It deserves
a good home.
