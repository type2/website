 Not really although 84 was a split model year and the first year of the
 water-cooled engine. In 86 they went to a slightly larger engine (2.1l
 vs 1.9l) with a different fuel injection system and improved routing for
 the coolant pipes and hoses. &gt;&gt;

Actually all 1984s were 1.9L waterboxers.  1983 wat the split year.
(At least in the USA anyway)
