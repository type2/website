I personally saved a lot of dinero in my 2.1 upgrade going on right now
for my 84 Westy just because of the list.  In addition, I have received
an inordinate amount of support from list members in the past two (plus)
years I've been here, so it's only fair to kick in some bucks as well to
help transfer, maintain, if not improve the quality of the list.

Bus Boys just having paid the Quarterlies, our cash reserve is quite low
- but I've saved over $200 personally on my engine upgrade and will
donate that from my own pocket as well and I'm sure I can squeeze a few
(actually quite a few) bucks from the Bus Boys coffers as well to Ron to
get the listserver on-line soon.  Ron - Keep us posted.

To Gerry - a thousand thanks for putting up with the motley crew here in
Vanagonland.  I hope you have a permanent subscription for life, if you
wish to keep seeing our antics.......:-)

To Poor Richard Palmer -  T Shirts?  Whadda about all of those 1000 brand
new soon to be obsolete (collectible) stickers?
