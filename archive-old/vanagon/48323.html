Subject: High Dealer prices

My backyard mechanic broke off a small fitting that goes between the idle
booster valve(for the a/c and ps)and the vac hose.  The dealer had a heck of
a time finding it(not on the micro fich).  The dealer finally called and
said &quot;well VW does'nt make it in plastic anymore, only in brass.&quot;  Cost: $48.00.
Anybody out there have one?
Best,

Bill Lund
