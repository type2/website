&gt;Probably a voltmeter if you don't already have one, but I prefer vacuum
&gt;gauges myself. They have so many uses for this gauge, see a climer manual.

I've thought about this too.  I was thinking of tapping into the line that
goes to the brake booster, before the one-way valve of course.  Would that
work?  And is there a nice VDO (or at least black-faced) 2-1/8&quot; gauge
available?  It would make a nice economy-meter.
