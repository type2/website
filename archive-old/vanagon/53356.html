&gt;I have the engine cases unbolted but can't see how to get the pistons or

&gt;
&gt;What is a good source for parts for this engine? Is there anything else

Fred,
I found a Hydraulic Lifter remover that worked. It fits through the inside
of the pin, then you turn the handle and the end expands to catch on the
pin. Then you pull. It also has a sliding hammer built in, but you want to
use that with caution.
