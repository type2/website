Hi all,
Went to an auto paint shop to try and have some paint made up to match my
bus for minor touch up purposes. They had all the color swatches for VW back
to early 60's. Found out that the color of my '77 Deluxe Westy is HIPPY
GREEN!! Now that is the best name for a color of a vehicle I have ever
owned, surely beats midnight black.
Peace,       &quot;Comes a time when the blind man takes your hand and say's 
Scoob         Don't you see, got to make some how, on the dreams you still
believe,
              Don't give it up, you got an empty cup,
              Only love will fill, only love will fill&quot;
              Jerry Garcia
