&gt;
&gt;&gt; suddenly fills up and spits back this huge spray of gasoline that gets all
&gt;&gt; over my coat, shoes and gloves.  So the whole way home we get to enjoy
&gt;&gt; those wonderful fumes -- yuck!  Has anyone else experienced this?

I have rarely filled my bus full, but it happens to my bug. Try to slow down
the gas flow at the end.
good luck
