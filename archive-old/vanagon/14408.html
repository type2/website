Subject: Need info on '88 Vanagon Syncro...

I have a buddy who is looking to buy an '88 syncro (65k miles, $10k).  
He's done some research in the library, etc, but would like some 
netwisdom on the topic.  Any one have any pearls of wisdom that they'd 
like to share?

Please send mail as I just jumped on this list to seek this info.

Thanks a ton!
