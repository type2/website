Mine has points.  Don't know why you thought that it was electronic.  

Call the dealer or a FLAPS.  Either one should be able to tell you which 
cap you should have, although the dealer is the only one likely to have 
the correct VW numbers.

&gt; rotor on, lo and behold, points.  Would this be a concern as to which cap 
&gt; and rotor I should have?  Hard to tell which one this is, but the numbers 
&gt; I *could* read were: Z42 / 0 231 170 093 / 022 905 2055  (this while 
&gt; standing on my head).  BTW, the reason for the recent downturn in the 
&gt; Vanagon's state of tune seemed to be a &quot;nipple&quot; (be careful now) welded 
&gt; on the points that I *think* was caused by the cigarette lighter being 
&gt; stuck in the &quot;in&quot; position for a couple of days.  Would this do something 

This is normal with older points.  Metal migration occurs in the 
direction of current flow over time.  You can either file it flat or 
install new ones.  I'd suggest the latter if it's as bad as it sounds.  
Replace the condensor while you're at it, too.

&gt; similar to the radio being left on in a car w/o an accessory position in 
&gt; the ignition switch?  I *told* my 7-year-old not to touch it. :(  I'm not 
&gt; a mechanic, nor do I play one on TV.  Thanks in advance for any light 
&gt; shedding. :-)

The cigarette lighter is &quot;hot&quot; whether the key is on or not (at least in 
my van).  Why didn't it pop out?  If you don't need it and it could be a 
problem just go ahead and disconnect the rascal, or move the fuse block 
connector to a lead that's only hot when the key is on.
