Subject: TIRES, info and a little Survey.

Well driving my new '78 home Sunday I really noticed how
much better it (136k miles, origional ball joints, old shocks)
handled on its worn reinforced XZX's than the mint '77 I
brought home last weekend for my parents (88k miles, new ball
joints, recent shocks) did on its regular XZX's all other things
equal, and since I need new tires on the '78 and can live with
the unreinforced ones from the '77 I'm getting the parents to
pick up some reinforced ones for themselves.  So I call Tire
Rack to get my options and was suprised by the selection, now
if anyone is scared of mail ordering tires, don't be I've done
it many times, the prices are great, the service quick, and
never had a problem, I highly reccomend it so here is the list
for general information, I'd like opinions from anyone that
owns any of these on ride, handling, comfort, etc and I'll
try to get the mini FAQ on the WWW site updated a bit.

For starters if anyone does not know, Buses and Vanagons
up to the Syncro/Alloy era should have

185R14C or 185R14 reinforced these work out to 25.65 x 7.28 inches
(diameter x width) with a C or reinforced or 6 ply load rating.
A D load rating or 8 ply is even heavier duty.  Tires like these
carry a 40+ psi maximum inflation rating and a load rating typically
over 1500 lbs a tire.
 
195/75R14C is another good choice with dimensions 25.52 x 7.68

205/75R14C may be a bit big for a Bus at 26.11 x 8.08

27x8.5R14C might be run for added ground clearance but would be tight
in fact I don't know if they work or not.


Bridgestone

603V (a nice XZX like tread pattern, should be fairly smooth)
175R14C $59     185R14C $62     185R14D $65     195/75R14D $65

D691 Dueler A/T (aggresive A/T pattern)
27x8.5R14C $78

Dunlop

  Radial Rover RV
27x8.5R14C $77
  SPLT5
185R14C $78     185R14D $80

BF Goodrich
  Radial All Terrain T/A (aggressive pattern)
27x8.5R14C $86

Michelin
  LTX M/S
195/75R14C $??
  XCA
205/75R14D $88     205R14D $88 (205/80R14)
  XZX Reinforced (stock many late model Vanagons long lasting IMHO)
185R14 Reinforced $66

Goodyear
  Wrangler Radial HT
185R14C $104
  Wrangler Radial LT
195/75R14C $86
  Wranglet Radial AT
195/75R14C $86

Yokohama
  Super Digger SD05
195/75R14C $76

AND THE TRUE BARGAIN BUS TIRE !!!!
  Y356
185R14C $52     185R14D $59  A friend has these on his Vanagon, the
8 ply D rated version, they handle well but are sort of like ribbed
semi tires, not a lot of radial grooves and can get slightly
squirrley wet, but still at this price and incredible value, Tire
rack never seems to have the C raters stocked though.

Also Sears has a C rated tire can't recall the name
I think it is a 195/75R14 and goes about $75 each

An odd option if you have a SAMS club nearby is a bias ply
made by Kelley in LT7.00x14 6 ply for $47 each

Most of these tires are at least all season M/S patterns
I know there has been recent tire discussion but I really
seek opinions about the merits and demerits of any of these
and I'll collect said info for posterity, also does anyone
know if Continental still makes an appropriate tire, a lot
of Buses came stock with them in the late 70's.
BTW Tire rack is at (800)428-8355 24 hrs. and shipping is
usually an added $5-$10 a tire I think.
