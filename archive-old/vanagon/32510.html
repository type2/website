Subject: 	Bosch Blue Coils

I recently fitted and am running a bosch blue coil because it was easy =
to=20
get hold of when mine died. However I noticed that people think I should =

have a ballast resistor, which it doesn't have. What damage will I do,=20
and where can I get a ballast resistor etc.

TIA

Dave.

Hey Dave,

I run a blue coil in mine, that my &quot;nothing but air cooled VW's&quot; =
mechanic put on for me, and I don't have a ballast resistor either.  =
There may be more qualified people on the list to answer the question =
&quot;Why?&quot;, but I don't think that you have to have one on the old VW setup.
