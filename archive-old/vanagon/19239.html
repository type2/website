Subject: Lotsa Light



                       Let There be Light!

                                
So there you are, purring across the desert in the cool of the
night and there's a funny sound from the engine room and the purr
gets a little quieter and that damned red light comes on.  You
just lost the fan belt.

No big deal; you got a spare.  And the lug wrench is the same
size as the fan pulley nut and you've even got a screwdriver to
keep the pulley from turning while you take off the nut.  But the
flashlight has those Civil War surplus batteries and gives you
one last good-bye glow, like a tiny red worm and dies.  You're
fresh outta light.

                      Doing it in the Dark

If you got a bug, changing your fan belt in the dark isn't too
bad.  You've got your flashers going of course, and they throw a
little light into the engine room.  But let's hope you don't drop
anything, you'll be pushing your bug back and forth, playing
patty-cake with the ground hoping all those stories you've heard
about night-time desert creepy-crawlies aren't true.  (They're
true.)

But you have a neat little trouble light in your kit.  It's your
static timing light.  Connect it up, change the fan belt and
you're on your way.  

Sure is nice to have the right tools when you need them, eh? 
What?  You say it's back at the house.  I don't think that's a
very good idea, do you?  Why don't you keep it in the door pocket
with your fuses.  Whatdaya mean, 'What fuses!'

                          Reality Check

Most good cars provide a light under the hood, another in the
trunk, one in the glove box, a couple under the dash, one by the
ash tray...  Good cars provide good lighting; they assume you'll
drive at night now and then.  Cheap cars don't do that, assuming
you'll stay home glued to the tube when the sun goes down.  The
Volkswagen is a cheap car (or usta be!).  The only lights you get
are the ones required by law.

My 1973 Datsun has a little light under the hood, positioned so
you can check the oil.  It's a very smart kind of light.  (Only
after praising the Datsun people for their thoughtfulness did I
learn that such a light was a legal requirement in some countries
where 1973 Datsuns were sold.)

                      Letting in the Light

I've got four lights in the engine compartment of my 1965 bus,
two in the engine compartments of the Ghia and sedan, two on the
baja.  

On the Ghia and bugs I put one of the lights on a bracket pop-
riveted to the blower housing, positioned so as to illuminate the
distributor and that side of the carb.  The other light is
mounted on the base of the generator tower so I can see the dip
stick and the timing marks on the pulley.

The light fixtures I used are high quality new-surplus items
manufactured by Grimes, the aviation people.  They are solid
nickel-plated brass jobbies that cost a couple of bucks each. 
Pretty small; Grimes calls them 'panel lights'.  They use the
commonly available #1816 12vdc lamp.  (That's the GE number; it
cross-references to others that will fit.)  The lamp is small,
about like a flashlight bulb.  If you want more light than it
provides there is a halogen replacement.

I got the light fixtures from American Science &amp; Surplus (3605
Howard St., Skokie, IL 60076.  (708) 982-0870 )  The part number
for the lights is #10572.  Cost was about two bucks.

              Screwing Them On (or up, your choice)

When mounting the lights on the engines I made up brackets from
sheet steel or aluminum.  On the bus, I used aluminum angle stock
and mounted the lights on the overhead of the engine compartment. 
In all cases I gave the lights their own fused circuit,
installing the fuse and the light switch on a small panel tucked
up out of the way.  The panel is aluminum, shaped to fit,
installed with either screws or pop-rivets.

Since I was running an auxiliary circuit I figured I might as
well run a good one, going directly to the battery with a 10
gauge wire.  This is easily done in the bus and Ghia, where the
battery is in the engine compartment. On the '68 sedan I snuck
the wire under the body, fastening it securely at several points
and protected inside of black polyethylene tubing, the stuff they
use for drip irrigation systems.  On the '67 baja I pulled the
wire through the body channel with the other wiring.

Why such a big wire?  For the cigarette lighter.  Or rather, for
the cigarette lighter socket.  (I smoke a pipe; kinda hard to get
going with a cigarette lighter.)  The socket is fused with a 25
amp circuit breaker.  I use it to power a 12vdc air compressor or
a trouble light or a camping lantern or a ham radio or...  or
whatever you might want to plug into a cigarette lighter socket. 
I guess the thing would even work as a cigarette lighter,
although mine comes with a big red plastic plug to keep out the
dirt.  (Baja-dust is special stuff, capable of penetrating six
inches of steel plate.)

No one ever notices the auxiliary lights, unless they see them on
at night.  The lamps are hooded; the light shines where you're
looking, not in your eyes, and on the bus each of the four
fixtures is behind a rib or strut.  The wiring is wrapped in
looms and the looms secured with aircraft-type wiring clamps,
secured to the chassis with stainless steel sheet metal screws. 
The switches and panels are out of the way; you have to look for
them to see them.  No chrome, no colorful curly wires; everything
is built for the long haul and so far, has worked exactly as
intended.

                           Sermonette

I plan to keep my Volkswagens until I fall apart.  And until
then, I plan to keep doing what I like to do, which is to head
for places well off the beaten track.  The lights and the
auxiliary power outlet make things safer and more convenient, and
enhance the usefulness of my vehicles.  Installing them took a
bit of work but if properly done it's a one-time thing, good for
the life of the vehicle.  Such things are worthy improvements for
early Volkswagens.
