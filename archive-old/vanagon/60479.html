&gt; 
&gt; However, it turns out that the rotor (which I had just replaced less
&gt; than 3000 miles ago) was bad and after replacement and a tune-up, the
&gt; old van is running great again.

Could someone explain to me how a rotor can go bad in 3000 miles?  Some
people replace them regularly whether they need to or not, others, like
me, haven't replaced one since electronic ignition!
