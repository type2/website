Eric:
This could be an engine adjustment OR alternator deficiency. Here's my
theory.  My 86Transporter  , when first started , will ramp up the RPMs
for a second. Our 85 GL, which did not used to race upon starting would
experience this problem. I believe the alternator requires this &quot;blip&quot; to
get the field excited. Checking the voltage before and after should
collaborate this. The  problem subsided after I did a major tune up and
cleaned out the cold start bypass valve.
Good Luck &amp; Drive Safely

&gt;When I start the van -hot or cold- the battery and OXS dummy lights stay
on
&gt;until I blip the gas once.
