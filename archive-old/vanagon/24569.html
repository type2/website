Subject: VW event at Woodstock this past weekend

Can anyone summarize this past weekend's event for us or at least me.  I had
every intention of being there Sunday for the swap meet, but I had to work
late all week and ended up starting my van's newly transplanted engine for
the first time Saturday evening about 8pm.  I could probably have gone up
for the swap after pulling some sort of wacky all-nighter, but I figured
it was not smart to have a 200-mile round trip be the 2nd and 3rd times I
started a newly installed engine.  As it was, I spent 7 hrs. on it Sunday and
I'm still not completely done.  I really need a second VW van, so at least
one will always be off the ramps.
