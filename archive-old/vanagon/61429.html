Subject: RE: Trailer hitches

The tow hook mounted hitches will not hold a bike rack extended wit the two 
inch receivers.  I learned the hard way as the hooks snapped off on me.  
Luckily I was not on the highway.  I now build frame mounted receiver hitches 
that will hold the load of most hitch mounted    accessories including those 
storage boxes.  Let me know if interested.

I have also seen the hitch that mounts onto the tow hooks, it didn't have a
label on it so I am not of the manufacturer. I would like to find a similar
hitch with a 2&quot; receiver so I can put my bike rack on it.
