Mark Keller, do NOT try this at home:
snip
&gt; 
&gt;       I would consider trying a set of lower profile tires on the front
&gt; only. That way you don't mess with the rpm thing or your speedometer
&gt; accuracy for that matter. Light Truck/RV tire would have no benefit for
&gt; lowering your road horsepower, but would increase your cornering force.
&gt;

This suggestion is just plain DANGEROUS.
