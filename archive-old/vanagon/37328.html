Subject: How to display lambda sensor info

I've been unsuccessful so far in finding the LM3914 chip needed to build
the LED array shown in http://proffa.cc.tut.fi/~eppu/dev/EGO-bar.html,
so I'm interested in a good mailorder source where I can be fairly sure
of getting it on the first try.

AND/OR

Could one of you electronics mavens gin up a circuit that would allow
the O2 sensor info to be displayed on a voltage gauge on the dash?  That
is, could a circuit translate the O2 sensor's voltage range 0.0 to 1.0
into the voltage gauge's range of 8 to 16, putting stoich (.45-.5) at
the 12v position.  This switchable double duty would be a handy way
(I think) to get the O2 sensor's output onto the dash.  Doable?

If you sneeze you'll miss my telling you all I know about electronics,
so pls. be gentle.

Thanks!
