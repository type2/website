Subject: Re: Exhaust Stud Nuts

&gt;I have read in various places that bronze, brass or copper alloy nuts 
&gt;with copper based anti-seize are the desired thing to have on the 
&gt;exhaust studs.  Now, can someone say for sure which alloy I want?  
&gt;Also, where can I mail order about eight of them?  I am stuck in a VW 
&gt;wasteland.  They look at me funny at the parts counters when I ask for
&gt;parts.  I have heard that Porsche has nuts that work for this.  Any 
&gt;other suggestions?  Thanks, Jim

I've found that almost any nut I use on the exhaust seems to come loose
eventually, copper ones included.  My '71 now has brazed on flanges for the
lower heat exchangers with lockwashered grade 8 bolts, and the 2/4 outlets
have 15mm size nuts.  I then backed up all the nuts on studs with a second
11 or 13 mm nut, whichever would fit.  I hesitate to use either an
anti-sieze or locktight due to the temperatures involved.  My exhaust has
never been quieter.

Eug,
'71
