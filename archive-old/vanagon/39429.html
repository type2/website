Subject: O2 Sensor rust!


Immmmm Baaaaaccckkkk,
	Thanks to everyone who wrote with suggestions about my stalling 
problem. I installed the new temperature sendor and cleaned all the 
grounds.  I also got a O2 sensor from FLAPS for $50. I won't know if 
these items did the trick or not until it gets cold here...it's gonna be 
85 tomarrow:(
  	Anyway, my new problem is that I cannot get the O2 sensor out of my 
cat. conv. it has rusted into place.  I went by Midas and they could not 
get it out.  They said that they could heat it up, but that it would melt 
the threads and I would have to get a new cat., which would be $300 or 
something.  I have sprayed the bee-jesus out of it with Liquid Wrench but 
it still will not move. I'm not panicked yet...for I know that there must 
be a way!  If any of you out there have any idea what that way might be 
please let me know.  Thanks.

Your gratefull dependant,
Cory
'86 Westfalia
