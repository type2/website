In a message dated 95-11-26 08:12:14 EST, you write:

&gt;Can you tell if the clatter is one side or the other, or (from the 
&gt;frequency) how many cylinders are involved?  Is it constant (every 
&gt;revolution) or intermittent?
&gt;
&gt;
It appears to be contiuous, as if all the lifterss are contributing to the
clattering.
