Subject:       Re: '73 van, Water in Oil 

&gt; Can anyone explain how any water can get in the oil, I noticed that the
&gt; rubber grommet type thing at the bottom of the dipstick tube was a bit
&gt; shot away, but this is a small hole for water to get in ? and there has
&gt; been no rain for the last day or so.
&gt; 
&gt; I have now drained all the yuk out of the engine and replaced the oil.
&gt; What else can I do to ensure that all the water has disappeared?

I'd change the oil again.  There's sure to be some residual water in 
there that didn't come out of the first switch.

Sounds almost as if someone filled it with water if there is as much 
as it sounds to be!
