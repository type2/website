&gt; I am planning my first road trip in my Westy.  My SO and I would like to
&gt; travel North from TN toward Canada.   Does anyone have any suggestions
&gt; as to a route and sights to see?
&gt; If any one has the first week of JULY off and is ready to travel let's
&gt; make a caravan. Strength in numbers and all.  I truly hope someone will
&gt; respond to my request. I want my first trip to be a good one.
&gt; One question how do you keep the rear hatch from cutting you head off
&gt; when you raise it to get in side???
