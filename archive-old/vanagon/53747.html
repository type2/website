Of course, there could be many causes to your problem, but excessive
voltage drop in that long wire from the ignition switch (and the
connections] is a common one.  So, yes, it is possible that a relay would
help.  Bob Hoover &lt;veedubber_at_aol&gt;, I think, and others wrote some good
stuff on this subject.  Search the archives at
