Subject: no start problem

Volks- my Diehard battery fluid is above the plates, the terminals look clean
&amp; well connected.  No battery or other warning lights have come on, but I
guess they can't be counterd on.  Radio &amp; CB work but turning key produces no
starting sound whatsoever.  I've been drifting down my hilly driveway to
jumpstart.  Am I right that my Tugboat ('90 syncro westy) doesn't have a
catalytic converter this would harm?   I'll plug in the trickle charger
tonight, but I'm thinking it's not the battery- could the alternator not be
charging it while I'm driving?  Any really simple ideas I can check this
week-end?      Thanks    8(
