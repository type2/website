Subject: Re: Towing a bus

I towed one of clara's buses either to of from Santa Cruz over the HWY 17
Hill. I think we got a bug towing attachment and attached it with U-bolts in
a non standard way. One of the U-bolts came undone &amp; I remember fixing it in
a shopping centre parking lot. 
So the bug unit can attach to the towing eyes with U-bolts.

Isn't that right clara
