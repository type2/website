&gt;Now, if there was a lock for the Vanagon oil filler door.....

well ... there is. :)  but it's not sold in this country. :(
it's for the vanagon pickup trucks. it's a kinda gizmo thingie ... the lock
is mounted over toward one taillight and pushes/pulls an arm that engages a
hasp-thingie on the back of the oil door.

if you can come up with a lock that moves a large enough lever-arm, you
could make up one yourself.
