Subject: Heat Ex. Ques. '79 bus


Hi all,
	I am trying to order some heat exchangers for a '79 bus and since 
they appear to be a one year only, I am having a hard time finding them.  
One place has a &quot;type4 heat exchanger for '79&quot; but it is for the 
411/412.  Will this work on a bus?  (I'm guessing that it won't, but I 
wanted to check to see before counting it out.) 

	A place called CA Import Parts LTD has the correct exchangers but 
they are $40 more apiece than the ones above. If I need to go here has 
anyone dealt with them and what do you think about them?

	I am hoping to order these today so that I will have them by the 
middle of next week so I can get this bus back together and back on the 
road. 
 
Thanks in advance for any help.
dave.
