&gt; OK, there seems to be a STRONG sentiment to avoid the mountains and

&gt; this matter and there's been a noticeable tendency to prefer the
&gt; CA coast.  I rather like David Garth's suggestion of the Pfeifer
&gt; Big Sur State Park, since, as he puts it, it should be warmer
&gt; relatively speaking, and &quot;has it all:&quot;  redwoods, waterfalls,
&gt; river, ocean.

&gt; What's your preference?  Early December?  January?  
&gt; 
&gt; Let me know!


The weekend 10th of December is a bit tight for us (are flying to 
Germany two days later), January sounds way better.....

Keep us informed, which Campground/State Park it will be and if we have 
to make our own reservations (using MARTHA as a code???).

Thanks for taking up the hassle of organizing something like this...

See You Soon!
