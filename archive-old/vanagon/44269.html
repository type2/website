Subject: Re: 78 Westy: Green plaid seat fabric (ACT NOW)

OK I've been trying to get people to go in with me for ages on
this.

THE TRIM SHOP has one 20yd and one 30 yd roll of factory
yellow, orange, green, black, stock in orange and marigold
buses.  If we buy the entire 30 yd roll (I guestimate 10-12
yd per complete bus (54in wide)) they will sell for $10/yd
if I buy by the piece it is $16/yd.  I want 12+ yds, I will buy
and sell to anybody interested for the $10/yd + shipping charges.
They will sell only the big roll, and the price seems to go up 
everytime I call, but I think I can hold him to the origional $10.

GET BACK TO ME ON THIS ASAP anyone interested, if I get a couple
confirmed orders, I will order the roll Friday.  I was in Phoenix
a month ago and went and saw the roll thinking about checking it
as baggage but decided it was too big.  I feel their price is obnoxious
but in line on this stuff, it is OEM material and is brand new.

On another subject I seek a source for the smooth green vinyl to
use as piping with this material, the piping unlike the vinyl sides
is smooth not leather grained.

Also I note late green and brown buses generally have the brown, beige,
green, black scheme, material I also seek for the '78.
