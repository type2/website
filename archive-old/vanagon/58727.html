&lt;&lt; anyone know for sure if the rear bumper brackets (things the towhooks are
 mounted on) are the same for metal as well as fiberglass (deluxe) bumpers?
  &gt;&gt;

they're not.  the rear bumper brackets are essentially the same, but there is
a extra piece welded to them to support the fiberglass bumper.
