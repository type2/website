Subject:  Re: politically correct and you children's silly songs

&gt;Joel - your favorites, Big Bopper and Buddy Holly, were killed together
&gt;with Richie Valens (of La Bamba fame) in a plane crash on the &quot;day
&gt;the music died,&quot; immortalized in a tune called American Pie, sung
&gt;by Don MacLean.

Name another pop tune from the '70s that was written about Don McLean
singing &quot;American Pie&quot;, and its affect on the writer...
