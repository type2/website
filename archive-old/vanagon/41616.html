I think this may be where your problem starts.  My 87 &amp; 88 Vanagons have the
second port inside the plactic cover that runs from the floor to the ceiling
at the left/rear corner of the van.  You can remove the cover easily with
about 6 phillips-head screws.  I would bet that your 1990 model DOES have two
ports and that you need to uncover the second one.

Good Luck,
