Subject: Re: BAYWINDOW VS. ev HEATERS.


&gt;My Baywindows gets too hot from time to time.

So does mine. In summer. It's a pity I have to freeze for the remaining 51
weeks of the year. Mark Twain obviously never visited the north of England :)

The time of the year has come around to rip my heating system apart again in
an attempt to coax more than a feeble waft of warmish air out of the vents.
I put in an inline fan last year but it was still hopeless. I was lucky to
survive the winter with all my extremities intact. This year I'm going to
insulate all the pipes, check the thermostat and bung up the gaps around the
heat exchangers' outer tin. I know this is an old thread but there must be
something else I am missing. Despite air-cooled buses' reputation for crap
heaters I can't believe they're supposed to be this bad. Any ideas?
