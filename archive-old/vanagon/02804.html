&gt; &gt;Query: What are three main causes of problems or restarting an
&gt; &gt;aircooled Vanagon engine? The engine is equipped with an OXSensor and
&gt; &gt;I am wondering if the problem relates to the sensor's age (no idea),
&gt; &gt;electrical (ie coil) or the FI system (lack of fuel)? Thanks in Advance -DC
&gt; 
&gt; change the fuel filter. do it anyway.
&gt; 
&gt; also check all the little electrical connectors in and around the engine
&gt; area. you might be just getting some corrosion on the spade lugs.

A weak battery and/or bad/corroded cables will also make it hard to start.
Check and clean the terminals.  I once replaced a starter on a bug only
to find a corroded disintegrating battery cable. :(  But low or weak 
voltage causes lots of headaches for F.I. 

Just being thorough... ;)
