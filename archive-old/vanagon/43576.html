Subject: Re: Vanadogs

I have 2 greyhounds and a black lab that are Vanadogs.  In fact, we 
got our 85 GL just for them after we got our first greyhound, 
Galileo.  The black lab fit into our Jetta at the time with no 
problem ( he is small ) but putting Galileo into the Jetta was like 
trying to shoehorn Shaquille O'neal's feet into women's shoes.  It 
just doesn't work.  

They each get a window to stick their head out of and I get to clean 
the windows and side of the van each time we take a drive.  We have 
to almost spell the word &quot;drive&quot; at our house or they will go mad 
with excitement at the prospect of getting in the van.  Are these 
great dogs are what?  They love their Vanagon.
