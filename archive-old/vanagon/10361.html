&gt; &gt; Dave Kautz, says this is a no-brainer, well I guess I qualify. Will stick

&gt;   I didn't mean to offend. What I mean is there are only so many places it 
&gt;   can leak when it's not being pressurized. Patience and the &quot;paper-towel-
&gt;   wrap should reveal all.        
&gt; 
&gt;   Apologies,

&gt;From one Dave to another, no apologies necessary......it IS a no-brainer....DC
