Subject: Re: bus accident

&gt;HOW many cars will allow you to survive a 65mph head-on into cement?
&gt;
&gt;It doesn't seem to make sense but IMHO a bus is engineered.

That's pretty damned lucky.

A friend of mine took his crew-cab ('6x vintage) head-on into a semi on a
two-lane highway (probably fell asleep).  After three days they unplugged
him...

So, somewhere between 65 and combined 130 is the theoretical limit...
