Subject: RE: Correct idle speed for 60's engine?


Jonny querries:
&gt;Muir quotes the correct idle speed as 850 rpm.

&gt;My owner's manual says 550 rpm.

&gt;What do you people think?

I think both are right as far as what the upper and lower RPM limits =
should be. I have found, especially on 6v systems, that setting the idle =
at a point where the gen light glows dimly is a good guide (unless of =
course you have a non functioning charging system).=20
