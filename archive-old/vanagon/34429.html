Subject:       Re: Synthetic oil (Revisited -- Briefly)

&gt; 20*(he may not have been that specific).Hence this question: Wouldn't that be
&gt; a good thing rather than bad if it means that the oil is &quot;transfering&quot; 10%
&gt; more heat(10* -20*) from the interior of the engine to the cooler?
&gt; I'll admit upfront that this is strictly an academic exercise for me since I
&gt; have very little understanding of things mechanical but do enjoy hearing the
&gt; &quot;pros&quot; hash one out.

As I understand it, the synthetic stuff sheds heat better.  That's 
great and all, but that means that more heat is being transferred 
into the engine case.  Not what we want.  We want the heat in the oil 
until it goes to the cooler which then effectively cools the oil.  
Sure the synthetic stuff would cool better in the oil cooler, but I 
don't want the heat in the case.

Again, this is based on what I've been told, and some random logic 
(combined in no particular order!).
