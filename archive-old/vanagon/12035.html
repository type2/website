Subject:       Request help with my seat

It's drooping.  and my hair is receeding and turning grey.  Oops, 
wrong seat!

I have this new Westy rear-facing seat (thanks to Michael) that I 
need to mount to the floor in a somewhat removable fashion.  I DON'T 
have the seat rails that bolt to the van floor, so:

1.  Does anybody have a set of those rails?

and in the likely event someone doesn't-

2.  Any advice on mounting it without the factory rails?  Just 4
bolts and call it good?  I haven't seen the factory method of
mounting-- did the rails stick up from the floor (tripping hazard?)
or were they recessed in some way? The seat has 2 'C' channels (the
female part) running perpendicular to the seat direction.

All suggestions appreciated.
