&gt;	So, I want to buy a used 4'x 8' trailer and do it myself. Lotsa

&gt;	Again, Help? Advice? Anyone who's towed a trailer with a bus

&gt;Thank you very much in advance!

I tow a 4X8 trailer full of camping gear several times a year with my '79 bus
with 2L engine. Climing long steep grades up into the mountains is SLOW with
six people and one dog in the bus.  Probably pulling 1000 lbs in the trailer
with all the junk we take.  Built my own hitch out of 2&quot; square tubing, .25&quot;
thick, that sits behind the stock bumper with only the reciever sticking out
the rear.
