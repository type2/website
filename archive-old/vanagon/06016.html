Subject: Engine Disassembly, EGR, Air Pump

Tthe engine (1973 1700 Type IV)  is out of the bus to be overhauled over
the winter.  After an afternoon of mild exertion, the motor is sitting on a
workmate in my basement.  I have a few questions...

Some of the tin is very rough (rusty). In fact, it is a real mother getting
the screws out (screwdriver ...nope... vise grips ...nope...
chisel...nope... drill).  What is recommended for cleaning up old engine
tin?

Not to my suprise, the air pump is frozen solid and the EGR is all clogged
up.  Disposing of the air pump and associated equipment appears trivial,
but I am not sure how the EGR system is attached to the heads.  A pretty
wimpy peice of pipe sticks out of each head near the intake port.  Is it
possible to remove this and plug the hole?  I expect that a motor tuned to
run without the aforementioned pollution controls will pollute less than
with non-functioning pollution controls attached.

I have seen big-bore cylinders advertised for the 1700 (96mm vs 90mm)  are
these an easy swap, and would there be a noticeable increase  in power
without replacing the stock Solex's or exhaust?
