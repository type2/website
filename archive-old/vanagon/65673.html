burglers,
&gt;           one armed with a shotgun, wrestled with one younger and
stronger
&gt;           than me for a gun.  I got the gun, he got shot.  If any of you
&gt;           out there do not own a firearm for self defence, WHAT ARE YOU
&gt;           WAITING FOR?!?

&gt;      Though I will not welcome the &quot;opportunity&quot;, Gaston Glock and I
await
&gt;      anyone who attempts a similar crime in my presence.

&gt;      your e-mail name and assume you had money?)
