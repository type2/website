Subject: Re: 85 questionable mpg


Leaving for the Gaspe Bay penisula tomorrow and my 85 westy is getting
really lousy gas mileage. (10 mpg). It is not smoking at all but the tail
pipe is coated (inside) with a black soot. The power is about normal. I
put a new O2 sensor on about 5000 miles ago. Where it hooks into the
tailpipe it is bent like it got wacked with a rock or something. If I bend
it back it will definitely snap off. I put a fuel tretment additive in and
the gas mileage shot back up to 22 mpg, but the last tank of gas I put in
it got a whopping 11 mpg. I don't really think it is the O2 sensor. Does
anyone have any quick suggestions. I am going to drive about 15 hours
tomorrow. It would be great to be getting better gas mileage. Thanks a
lot.
Going skiing in the Chic Chocs!
