&gt;You could have the ring and pinion changed to match the performance of the
&gt;engine


Well, yes, but the range of available R&amp;P sets for that tranny are VERY
limited. The V6anagon has a final ratio of 0.85. With the tallest R&amp;P
available, I could make it 0.82. The difference would be practically
unnoticable, and not nearly enough for what the V6anagon needs. I tried
putting big tires on it (215/75R14), but those didn't help much either.
In fact, the speedo is EXACTLY accurate, meaning not much has changed.

Places like Transform modify trannies this way all the time, they told
me, but they usually stick to off-the-shelf parts, available in US or
Europe (which is where that 0.82 set comes from).

There's always fabrication, I suppose, if you are a master machinist
and design engineer, with a complete metal shop at your disposal.
I personally am none of the above, and wouldn't have the foggiest notion
of where to start. Gear design is a black art to me (a feeling born of
ignorance), and best left to the people in those smoke-filled rooms
at VW.

Anyone ever done any fabrication of gears from scratch? How difficult
is it? How many tries does it take to &quot;get it right&quot;?
