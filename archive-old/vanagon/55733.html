Well, I'v had the '81 westie for almost 2 weeks now.  There are a couple of
minor problems I could use some advice about.

First, when I start it, it takes several seconds (maybe 7 to 10) for the
oil light to go out and the buzzer to quit.  Then, if I let it idle too low
during the first minute of so it is on, the light will flash again.  It
seems to happen more when I am going out my driveway, which is down through
a ditch.

Second, the spedo sticks.  When I accelerate, it comes up much slower than
my actual speed, and when I slow down, it may not drop at all, frequently
remaining at 30 or 40 mph even when I have stopped.  The odometer works fine.

I took it out and sprayed some silicon into it, without noticible effect.
In hindsight, this was most likely a mistake.

Would soaking of washing it is solvent help?

To take it apart requires untwisting some twisted pieces of metal that hold
it together, and I'm not ready for that, unless that's the only way.

Next item -- there is a rubber boot connecting some sort of housing on the
back of the alternator to the body on the inside rear by the passenger side
taillight housing.  It looks like some sort of air intake.  It has come
off, and in the limited space available, I am having trouble putting it
back on.  I am hoping somebody has a great trick that will make this
easier...  probably not, but hope springs eternal...

Finally, I posted a picture of my new buddy on my web site photo page, at:

Thanks,


Bill
