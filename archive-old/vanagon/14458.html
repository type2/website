Subject: Re: backfire!

&gt;What causes are there for backfiring (mine's starting to do it on the 
&gt;down shift).  I know incorrect timing can cause this - why exactly?  Is there
&gt;residual compressed gas in the cylinder during exhaust stroke followed with
&gt;late ignition?  What other causes can lead to backfiring other than the 
&gt;timing disorder? 

Christian,

Assuming that your engine only needs a tune up, an incorrect point gap can
cause this problem too.  Points gradually wear out, and as they do, the
effective point gap changes, which could lead to backfiring.

Backfiring through the exhaust happens like how you've described it.  The
ignition spark occurs too late (bad timing) and incompletely burned fuel
accumulates in the exhaust manifold/muffler and can be ignited, causing the
backfire.

If your point gap is off, the ignition spark can intermittently not reach a
spark plug (misfire), thereby also causing the accumulation of unburnt fuel
in the exhaust manifold/muffler.

During a powered deceleration (while downshifting), later Buses (I'm not
sure how late) are equiped with a vacuum retard mechanism on the
distributor.  The &quot;can&quot; on the side of distributors with this feature have
two &quot;nipples&quot; where vacuum hoses are attached. During deceleration by
downshifting, unburnt fuel can be momentarily spewed into the atmosphere. 
VW designed the vacuum retard mechanism to reduce engine emissions during
closed throttle/high vacuum conditions that are prevalent when you
downshift under power.  A problem with this mechanism, or even its absence,
will manifest itself as backfiring.
