Subject: Re: '80 Vanagon emissions question

I'm not in NC but my '81 passed emissions last year here in Utah
with an empty catalytic converter housing.  It took some fiddling
on the part of the guy doing the testing, though.  You'll need to
find someone cooperative and willing to bend the rules, probably.

The bus didn't pass this year :(  Hence the engine in pieces.
