Subject: Re: Vanagon safety /picture

Funny you should mention this, just today I got a nice VW vanagon brochure 
from someone in South Africa. It shows a vanagon impacting the test wall. 
Usual wrinkle finish, but I would say that the dash hasn't moved more than 
half a foot, meaning you'd survive comfortably.  I can scan this if someone 
wants it for whatever purpose?   Tim
