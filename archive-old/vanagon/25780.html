I'm not. (reading about it, that is) I was on jury duty for a week and now
I'm home with a bad cold. I've tried to track down duplicates before and
never been successful.  I'll try again, but it's just vagaries in the mail
system.  Our mail goes through a rather large mail hub (serving over
150,000 users) so sometimes things get weird. Right now they are trying to
make some major changes to that system and having some trouble, so I
pretty much assume that that is the cause of the problem and once they
solve it, the vanagon_at_lenti problem will also go away.  I'll check to see
if there are multiple listserv's running or anything weird like that, but
I rather doubt it.  Hang in there. 

Lastly, (and this is for list people who are feeling frustrated), I
receive over 120 messages a day that are bounces from mailings to this
list (sometimes as many as 500).  Some of these contain the entire text of
the Digest form of the list. Sooo...don't feel bad if you get a few
duplicate postings.  Just think of what I see EVERY DAY. And try to keep
good track of your subscriptions to other mailing lists and unsubscribe
before closing your account. 

I'll cc the list so they know that it's not them.
