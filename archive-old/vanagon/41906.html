     &gt;I recently acquired a '68 parts bus. My question is: can I use this 
     &gt;ball-joint front end on my '59? Someone told me yesterday that I 
     &gt;could. I also have a '73 parts van, can I use the disc brakes from 
     &gt;that beam on the '68/'59? 
     
     The '68 only beam bolts straight onto a split. Although it rides a 
     little high so you would need to lower it (cut'n'turn, or adjuster 
     kit).
     
     The discs will go straight onto the '68 beam as well. Although you 
     should really change the master cylinder for the one with the pressure 
     release (Jim (BB) might be able to advise.). Any conversion from drums 
     to discs requires the corresponding master cylinder. This is because 
     the hydraulic system for discs means that the pads are in, almost, 
     constant contact with the discs. In town driving the hydraulic fluid 
     can expand, and without compensation for this expansion, the system 
     can become pressurised into locking the pads on and you get to a 
     seized state.
     
     The point is whilst I know a lot of people that have done the disc 
     swap thing, none of them have experienced the seizing problem but I 
     have heard about it several times on beetles.
     
     good luck,
     
     Lee.
