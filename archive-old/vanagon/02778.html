&gt;I have this fantasy that perhaps there is a halogen or other very bright bulb
&gt;with say 2 to 3 times the light output of the stock bulb to put in the back-
&gt;up light socket.  I really don't want to mount additional lights but I really need more illumination.  Any ideas?
&gt;
I saw halogen backup lights in the Herrington catalog a while back.
Kinda pricey, but then whaddaya expect from Herrington.
