Subject: 	'86 Syncro front shocks/rotors - Replacement Report

Same message second time - I didn't see this posted to the list.

Well I finally finished replacing the front shocks on my '86 Syncro.  Not
the easiest in the world, but doable.  Bentley describes the process fairly
well.  I also replaced my front rotors/pads at the same time although each
part can be replaced independently.  The only special tool I used was the
spring compressor.
