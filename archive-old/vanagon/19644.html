Subject:      Ever put in one of them wiper delays?



Its been a hot day, sittin in the buss, starring at all those wire, and coming
up short, get it, every time. I asked about using a three prong flasher relay
in a 69 buss. Seems I got in to much of a hurry putting in those pretty new
gauges. Turned it on, heard the blinker go off a few times, along with some
popping noise, and now no turn signals. Well, I ain't smart enough to quite.
Seems I got this here window wiper delay switch, you know, one of them fits
all cars kind. Hooked up a bunch of wires, located the slow speed wire, or I
think that's the one, hooked up to the power. When I just turn on the slow
speed it works.
  But when I turn on the delay, the wipers just kick down a bit then no
movement as the wires to the delay box get hot and, If I wait, the fuse goes.
I've gone through a mess of those fuses today--and they are a bit harder to
find and pricer when you do.
       So? Anyone else tried to attach one of these or should I just enjoy the
bus as it was and dream of the sixties?

Tim
