Subject: Austin and Central Texas Listies, and anyone else

We have finally settled on some sort of meeting time and location for a
meeting place. For those who are interested, and have not received any
information to date, it is as follows:

It appears that June 21, Scoot Inn, 11:00am(unless Craig says they
wont open early), is the mutually agreed upon meeting time. Below I will
put the directions to there from north, south, east and west. From the
looks of it, it should not be hard to find.

It is on East 4th Street something like 1308 E 4th or thereabouts.

-- FROM SOUTH - get on the northbound I35 access road anywhere before
Ceasar Chavez (East 1st). East 4th only goes RIGHT; there is a large
white warehouse (Pool Storage) right on the corner to mark it! Scoot Inn
is about 5 blocks along, on the left.

-- FROM NORTH - get on EASTBOUND East 6th St. Go a few blocks until you
see IRON GATE BAR on your right; this street is Waller. Take a right.
Cross tracks. First street after tracks is East 4th, turn LEFT. Go two
blocks to Scoot.

-- Folks coming from the WEST should take Caesar Chavez all the way to
I35

-- From the EAST, 7th or 4th should do ya.

Cheers,

David
