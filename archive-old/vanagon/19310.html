Subject: Dictionary Needed ... part II

Now that I've been here for 6 weeks and I've learnt the basic vocabulary,
I need definitions for some more words:

What is the difference between:
- Safari Bus
- AdventureWagen
- Campmobile
- Weekender and
- Westphalia ?

I know a Westphalia ... my wife drives one to work.
Some contexts seem to imply that &quot;Weekender option&quot; is the same thing as
a Westy, others would imply that is is a lesser conversion, maybe only
the convertible seat/bed without the Pop-Top(TM).

Is the Campmobile a US-made hightop ?
Is the AdventureWagen a Campmobile on a MicroBus foundation ?

You all can reply to me, and I'll post a summary of what I learn.
