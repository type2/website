&gt; 
&gt; I have had several people tell me that I should leave the FI on the 
&gt; bus.  But last Summer when this problem arose, I got the FI motor and 
&gt; put it in, I spend weeks trying to get it to work correctly.  No one 
&gt; knew what the problem was. I just want a bus that runs good.  I would 
&gt; rather have the FI if I can get it working.  
&gt; 
&gt;     Last summer no one on the list knew a fix.  Well now that the 
&gt; list has grown mabey someone with the fix has arrived.
&gt; 
&gt;     The probelm is that when the ignition is on the injectors open 
&gt; and stay open.  no pulsing.  The injectors are not grounding where 
&gt; they shouldn't.  Checked that.  I am getting a good siginal from the 
&gt; coil.  Wires are hooked up correctly.  Checked several times.  Air 
&gt; flow meter was tested and is OK.  Double relay is also OK. Grounds 
&gt; are good, connected as in the manual.  I even replaced the Brain box. 
&gt; No effect.  Cylinder head thermo is OK as is the air temp sensor.  I 
&gt; don't know what else it could be.
&gt; 
&gt;     I would like to fix it, but I just want my bus back and running.  
&gt; If I can get it working I will have to put carbs on, or mabey an 
&gt; after market FI system, I have had better luck trouble shooting them.
&gt; 
&gt;     Any solutions, fixes, or suggestions are greatly appreciated.

  Looking at Bentley and those awful &quot;current flow diagrams&quot; indicates that
  with the ignition on but the engine off the fuel pump should be off too. I'm
  guessing here, but if the engine is not turning I wouldn't expect any
  pulsing since the frequency signal is coming from the distributor. The signal
  voltage to the double relay comes from the flow sensor open or from the   
  igntion switch _only_ when it is in the &quot;start&quot; position.

  You might try opening and closing the points manually to see you can get
  the injectors to pulse. Otherwise look for a short that is running 12 volts
  through the injectors, by passing the ECU.

  Good Luck,
