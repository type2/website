Subject: 2nd Annual &quot;Love-Bug Off&quot; Sept 28/29th

Folkses:

Event:  2nd Annual North Florida/Southern Georgia/Alabama Love-Bug Off

Date:   Saturday and Sunday Sept 28th and 29th

We are fast approaching the deadline for reservations on camping sites and
need to confirm from listmembers who and what will attend.  Post me eMail
privately using &quot;Confirm&quot; in your subject header and we (I) will pay your
site reservation upfront (you can reimburse us when you arrive... NOS Safaris
taken in trade against cash....) You pay the entry fee (3.95 for up to 8
humans) upon entrance...

SITE:  O-Leno State Park
        http://www_dot_dep.state.fl_dot_us:80/parks/northcentral/oleno.html

Entrance fee:    3.95 (not Pepsi bucks)

Campsite costs:  All sites have a grill, wet firewood and water, power opt.!
                 cold water site...10.90 per night
                 with electrical...13.04  &quot;   &quot;

Canoe rentals:   3.00 per hour, seat cushions and oar(s) provided


UPDATE:  Good News, and a snag....  We have a local microbrewery who has been
so kind as to donate a micro portion of their regional brew for consumption by
the legal kind who consumpt.. Problem 1, Federal parks frown on open containers
of alcoholic beverage as the fauna are hard to card, and patrons start whistling
at the deer after a few too many....  We're working on a compromise...
         We have however, not had any luck trying to convince the powers
that be to let us entertain ourselves with the melodic rhapsodies of &quot;the
big white undies&quot; and other &quot;surprise guests&quot;!  A shame as I'm sure the
fauna (after a few
brews) who put on a side show which would rival any Letterman episode to date!


STUFF: Low key, but basically we're gonna have a swap meet and meet meet on
        Saturday along with obligatory frisbee tossin and river swimmin and
        BBQ'ing or vegie grazin, basking in the sun (tho it's mostly woodsie)
        as well as nature walkin and fishin (bring yer permit).. Great for
        the youngins less interested in VWs than we are.
       Sunday we're renting,dragging,borrowing a bunch of canoes along with
        packing some great grub for a cool water spring picnic while we float
        down the beautiful Sante Fe River... `Bout a 6 hour float and at the
        end (Rum Island) we'll catch a ride back up to our waiting vehicles..

CONTACT: Me  (Busbones_at_praxis_dot_net) Let me know who and how many (we're getting
        a reservation on their &quot;Group Site&quot; which will accomadate 140 of us
        with our vehicles.) That way we can spread stuff out and not bother any
        of the Un-Volkswagen folks. I need help organizing foodstuffs and misc
        stuff (any EastCoast Marthas?) as I don't put my salad forks in the
        proper place (ever!)
