&gt; Hi, I'm Amy and I am now the proud owner of an engineless, rust-enhanced,

&gt; make more sense to do one before the other?

My $0.02 worth is get it on the road first.  Engine first, then body 
work.  If you do it th e other way around, you might have a 
prettier-looking bus, but you won't be able to do much more than look at it.

Keep us up to date on your project, and have fun!
