Subject: Re: Sliding Door Silencer?

&gt;My '86 is a GREAT machine, but when the sliding door is opened at 2AM, 
&gt;everyone in camp knows what YOU are doing. 


HaHa, so you pee'd out of the vent windows yet? The only solution to your 
problem that I've found is to go out the front door, just pull in on the 
door handle as you open the latch. Less of a telltale 'pop' that way. tim s.
