Subject: 83's squeeky

        Well, my long weekend trip out to the nether regions of Alberta is
over :( but damn was it ever a great trip. I left on Friday with 2 freinds,
one of whom decided to bring his huge speakers, and man did they ever blast
the van! Its gonna be a pain to get those speaker wires connected back up
inside the top cupboard but it was worth it.
        We brought enough food for about 6 weeks, on a 3 day trip, and ate
about 3 weeks worth of it. Lots of great hiking, and even a bit o' fishin,
although we only succeded in losing 6 lures and catching nill fish.
        Now on to the problems: I drove about 200 km total on forestry
roads, and as soon as we got back out to the highway I noticed a
distinctive squeek coming from the wheel area. Now I had just replaced the
brakes 2 days proir so I thought that maybe they needed some breaking in
but that wasnt it. It seemed totally random, not linked to certain speeds
or anything. I thought maybe it could be a bearing???? thats gone bad, or
perhaps some dirt in a bad place?????  I really have no clue though. All I
do know is that it was up front near/around the tires. Any suggestions?????

curious George...alhtough my name is not a George.
