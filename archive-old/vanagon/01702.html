Subject: $700.00 fuel tank

Good VWrs

  My FLAG just called and gave me an estimate for the 
fuel tank replacement for my 82 Diesel (Blue, by the way Joel, nothing
hanging from the mirror, 3 original wheel covers, one missing).

 The estimate was $700.00 installed. Gee, and we were complaining about
exhaust system prices! His words were &quot;I don't know how they can
ask that kind of money...&quot;

  I suppose its time to let my fingers do the walking through the 
mail-order parts places. 

  Besides Recycled Inc (Which Steve Smith recommends, and since he is
                        smart enough to both live in Upstate NY AND
                        have a Diesel, I respect him (Although he needs
                        *5* speeds to get around. I only need 4!))
 (Does anybody have the phone number for Recycked inc?)
       
   Does anybody have the definitive (sic?) list a parts places (including
phone numbers? Soorry my typing stinks. I am in shcok over the above price
still.
