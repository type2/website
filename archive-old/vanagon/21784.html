Subject: Hot Feet in '85 GL

Dear fellow listmembers:

It's been hot here in Atlanta, GA, as it has been in most of the East and
Mid-west these days and I have been using my new AC compressor a lot.  It
seems to work pretty well until it gets into the 90s.  One of the reasons
that I think it doesn't work well when it's hotter is that the floorboard at
the front of the van gets really hot.  I have blocked off my fresh air
intake with foam rubber stuffed in since the fresh air leaks even when the
lever is in the off position, so hot air isn't coming into the van.  My
second seat passengers report that the AC works well for them, and the van
miraculously seems to never overheat even when stopped in horrendous Atlanta
traffic jams--the needle of the temperature gauge just gets slightly above
the LED warning light so that the LED can be seen, but never higher.

I have noticed that the problem gets worse when the van gets hot enough that
the second stage fan switch kicks the fan speed into &quot;high&quot;.  Is there some
way to insulate the firewall so that the heat is less of a problem?  Anyone
have any specifically creative solutions to this?

Although the AC compressor seems to work well, it groans rather loudly--the
shop that installed the compressor just shruggs.
