I have this same sticker, it looks great with headlights shining thru it from
the rear!...  $3.50 at Yin Yang in Sebastopol, same as yours.  I never even
noticed they were splitties till you mentioned it.  Duh!  But then, I never
used to check out every bus I saw on the street before joining this list,
either!
