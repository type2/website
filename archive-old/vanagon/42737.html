&gt;  My 86 Syncro fuel pump is leaking fuel again. I now have
&gt;    a fuel pump off of a 1980 Vanagon.  Can someone tell me
&gt;    if they are the same?? They look the same! HA Ha! The local
&gt;    autoparts stores are telling me that the Syncro fuel pump
&gt;    isn't even the same as a regular 2 wheel drive Vanagon.
&gt;
&gt;    Is there information somewhere that will cross reference
&gt;    Vanagon parts for different years and to other models?
&gt;
&gt;

It will work.  I have to wonder why they are leaking on you.
