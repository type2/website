Subject: a stupid question??

Hello,

I have a stupid question that I need answered. I hooked up an auxillary switch
to my cooling fan so that I could turn it on when I want to. I tested it out
and found the air was blowing in my face. Is this the correct direction for air
flow from the fan? Thanks.


Cheers, 
dave
