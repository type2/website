Subject: Re: Hoo Boy! (Was: Corrado Powered Westy Syncro - For Sale)


 tom, and everyone else...
 i did just call about some details...
 and it was basically the same old:
 used the diesel bell housing, starter, oil pan, etc...
 but for you syncro nuts, you would be interested to know that
 he said that he had to order a special gas tank from germany to make
 it work... he also said that he had been working on vanagons
 for years and that he did the conversion himself.
 however he didn't say it was easy. he seemed to sound as though it was
 a difficult process and mentioned that adapting the corrado w iring harness
 and computer was a bit time consuming.
 i think that the number he gave is his work number,
 he seemed willing to talk about the conversion, but now is not a good time,
 i told him that i would be in touch with him again and he seemed
 cool with it... if i learn anything from him , i'll post it...
 i'm really interested in maybe a VR6 for my crewcab...
 i'd get lots of power and still have heat....
 still looking for more info,though...
