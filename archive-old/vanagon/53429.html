Subject: clutch master cylinder

'82 diesel Westfalia
Questions:
1.  My clutch master cylinder is leaking internally.  There is a small
amount of corrosion about half way down the bore.  When I push
the clutch, the transmission engages slowly as the master cylinder loses
pressure.  I think it is caused by the master cylinder.  I took the clutch
slave cylinder and it looked fine with no external leaking.  Has every bodies
experience been that it is usually the master cylinder??
Can these be rebuilt??  Whom do you think has the best price for a new one??
2.  How do I drain the oil from the transmission??  I see a plug right by
the shift linkage but I don't know if this is the drain.  There is a plastic
cap on the top of the transmission.  I need a clue.
