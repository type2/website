Subject: '71 Clutch




It seems to have come time to replace the clutch on my '71 Rusty...
Uhh...I mean Westy. Since this is the 1600, does it take the same clutch
as the other VW 1600 products? (200?) (I think I have one around 
here somewhere!)

Also, being new to this list, doesn't it seem that almost everyone
has a '71 Westy? Maybe just more postings....
