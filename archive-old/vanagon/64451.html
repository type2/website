Subject:      Westfalia  Award Winner

Fellow List Members,
        I volunteered to serve as the support vehicle for my friend who enjoys
showing his 1979 triple white beetle convertible.  We traveled to
Gatlinburg TN for Annual Gatlinburg VW Expo.  Cool Show.  As we arrived
the area was pulsing with people.  There was a very good turn out.
Since parking was nonexsistant, we decided to enter my 1984 Westy in the
show.  I was three cars down from my friend,with the Refrigerator full
of refreshments, top poped under a large shade tree.
        I was surprised by how many people stopped by to looked the Westy.
Many of them had Vanagons in the parking lot.  After a make shift
cleaning of the Westy, we spent the day meeting new friends and admiring
the other VW.  Some people spend more on a pre 1960 beetle than we would
on a 1990 syncro westy.
        After a good dinner, we returned to the show area to turn in.   Not
until the next morning did we find out the area was closed to camping.
Oh well.     A Hotel cost $89 a night. I am glad we were asleep before
the security staff cleared the area.
        My second surprise came at the awards ceramony the next afternoon. My
friend was up against some nice Vws.. He did not win an award.     BUT
my beloved Brown and Tan 1984 Westfalia TOOK second place the the Water
Cooled Stock Class! I was elated and shocked.  We laughed about it all
the way home.    My friend was happy for me, but I know he was a little
upset because he had spent the week before the show cleaning his car
with a tooth brush.  I Just washed mine the night before show, in hopes
of getting better fuel economy.
        I just wanted to share a story about a little vehicle that has had a
BIG affect on my life.   I hope we never get to the point that some of
the beetle owners have. Many of their car are never driven, other than
on and off of the trailers for the shows.
As unique as the &quot;beetle people&quot; are, I still enjoy Vanagon owners who
drive and use their Vans on a daily basis.  Please wave and honk when
you see the brown and Tan award winner on the highway.
