Subject: R Bumpers not same+Pwdr Coat Info

&gt;Rusty just got through researching this same thread for the '67 Resto from
Hell (Westfalia). The description below (from Jon Christensen) is correct.
Yes, you can use either for a make do fit. If you're trying to be correct
then heed the description below. 
Also look out for the subtle differences in methods used for attaching the
bumper mounting brackets. Euro bumpers have two holes on the same horizontal
line, whereas the bumpers with standard (and maybe deluxe)over riders have a
single hole in the face of the (rear)bumper and a separate bracket mounting
thingy on the inside of the bumper. Keep your eyes peeled for the splash
pans that need to mount on the inside of the rear bumper on the corners.
Even if they are *somewhat* rusted or bent they can still be straightened,
bead/sand blasted and powder coated. They are some what hard to find in some
areas. I don't know if they are being repopped.

BTW: The correct percentage of gloss to ask for while getting (engine
tin,alt pulley, shifter, under carriage, etc.) powder coated is 40-60%. This
percentage will appear as semi-gloss. The 60-80% will look to you and I as
&quot;100%, gloss&quot; but will with-stand some subtle abuse. 

It is *suggested* that wheels be powder coated with 60-80%
100% black or white is way too much and will scratch. 
The percentage used is of course up to the individual to decide for
themselves. check with your local powdercoater source and ask for examples
of each before laying down the money.

&gt;Nope, the '63's have a slant at the front of rear bumper blade and the 
&gt;66's had more of a pointed edge:
&gt;                         ____           ____  
&gt;    side view:   63 =        /     66 =     \ 
&gt;                        ___/            ____/      
&gt;
&gt;This start of the non-slant was late 64 as far as I could 
&gt;tell, but it this is not an 'exact science'.  Of course you 
&gt;could use the '63's whithout hurting anything.  It will fit 
&gt;fine.
