Subject: More Idiot Factor

How about getting a call from the Mrs. who was driving the '57 single cab to
a luncheon appointment. She was all dressed up and it was getting to be
summer in Phoenix. She called and said that the truck &quot;was acting funny and
then revved real high and just stopped running.&quot; She was real calm about it
but I basically screwed up her plans due to a battery that wasn't strapped
down. It had bounced around in the area where the tray had been at one point
in time. The battery had slipped and ripped the ground wire off and came to
rest grounding out against the passanger side Kadron which shot bits of the
terminal post all over the engine compartment. She was actually enjoying the
attention of honking construction workers as I drove up to rescue her. One
of these days I gotta start getting her to dress like an Amish wife or tie
down battery. In her defense she knows to shut down the engine anytime any
light appears &lt;ASAP&gt; or anything doesn't seem right. No excuse for my sloppy
engineering... 

How about limping a 6v ghia miles across town &lt;konking out several times
along the way&gt; to a mechanic friend only to have him reach in and bend the
choke lead away from the choke body/element and send me on my way. Five
second fix!
