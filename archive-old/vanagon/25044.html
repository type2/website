&gt;Help!  I've been looking forever and can't find one.  I'm in the Wash DC

&gt;advertised more often.  Any suggestions on sources or techniques would be
&gt;greatly appreciated.  I'm shooting for a '78 bus (this seems to be the best 

&gt;of the 70's type II from what I can tell).


Personally, I prefer the 68-71 buses... less smog junk, engines are
a lot cheaper. OTOH, less power than the 1.7-2.0 liter later ones.

A lot of east coasters seem to come to the left coast to find unrusty
examples to drive and/or tow back. If you like, I can shoot you some
sample listings. Conditions of vehicles here, can vary tremendously,
from &quot;pristine&quot; to &quot;junk&quot;. Of course, there's always a danger in buying
any vehicle you haven't had a chance to thoroughly inspect.

If you do something like this, I'd suggest lining up (by phone) four
or five likely prospects, then coming here, renting a car, and hitting
all of them. If you're looking for a rebuilder, you might even rent
a tow-capable truck rather than a car. Though, you'll be putting 3,000
miles on it for the tow return. Maybe a big, mileage-is-free car, and
a universal tow bar and hitch? Possibilities are endless...

Good luck,
