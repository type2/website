&gt;I couldn't disagree more.  I think that people who keep cars in museums
&gt;should get to live in the museums along with their cars.  One shouldn't
&gt;have to worry about driving a car around, or leaving it outside, unless
&gt;the weather is a danger to the condition of the car.  I doubt that was
&gt;the case here.  Cars are meant to be driven and appreciated, not stored 
&gt;in locked rooms.

David,

I'm on your side.  Some place in Chermanny they've probably got a zero-miles,
right off the assembly line copy of everything VW has every built.
 Everything else is second-best, no matter how hard you try.

Guys get fixated on this NOS, OEM, All Original bullshit.  The shrinks even
have a definition of it called The Collector Syndrome.

My Volkswagens are pratical, working tools, not toys or museum pieces.  I fly
old planes and drive old cars because I grew up with them.  I know how to
keep them running and quite frankly, I find them to be more honest than the
modern stuff  

Less expensive, too :-)

-Bob
