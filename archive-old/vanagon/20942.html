&gt; Hi.  My '79 camper has just had a tune-up, and it runs pretty well.  However,
&gt; during the first few minutes of operation, it will not idle and it stalls.
&gt; Once it warms up a bit, it idles just fine.  Even if I turn the engineoff for
&gt; only 15 or 20 minutes, this problem occurs for the first couple of minutes
&gt; of driving.  Any ideas out there??
