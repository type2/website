&gt; Just read your post about the 86 Vanagon.  I just wanted to tell you that
&gt;Your bus doesn't have a timing belt. Well, actually if it's a diesel then
&gt;it would.  But I'm assuming that its a horizonally  opposed 4 cylinder
&gt;1.9L.  That engine is amazingly similiar to a beetle engine.  The cam runs
&gt;directly off of the crank.  So no belt needed.  As far as the muffler goes,
&gt;the last time I checked VW did not offer a warrenty on their Vanagon and
&gt;air-cooled mufflers. But that might have changed. If you bought your muffer
&gt;from a auto-parts store it might be warrentied.  I know that brands like
&gt;A-P and Walker offer lifetime warrenties and their VW mufflers. Hope this
&gt;helps.  Take care.

Hello Jim,
A-P and walker mufflers not the way to go.  Bosal units are much heavier,
have reinforced flanges, and will last for a while.  86 and later VW mufllers
are stainless and do have lifetime warranty.  They also expensive.  I am
getting ready to replace the one on the FUN BUS this spring.  As the original
has 126K on it, I will probably go to the dealer.  Especially since I also
need some of the Brackets.
Keep on Bussin'
Dennis.
