Subject: Towing with a 1.9L

I don't know if I'm jsut lucky but two years ago I towed a Uhaul trailer 
(6x10)loaded along with a full van from Denver CO to Boston MA. The 
return trip was towing a 66 Beetle I got from an Aunt. Trip out through 
PA was rough due to the lousy road. Trip back with the bug was fine. Get 
one of the towbars that hooks to the axle and the bug will follow you 
anywhere.
