Point well taken. I guess I get kind of emotional about that stuff, around
here I'm the one that ends up fixing the darn things when they don't work.
The word &quot;Mac&quot; sends flashbacks of all nighters trying to keep them up
through my head. I wouldn't wish that nightmare on anyone, and am just
trying to help the list continue to be the best mailing list that I've seen
on the Internet.
