&gt; Hi all:  I was wondreing if anyone knows if the Head gasket kits for
&gt; Wasserboxers that you get from aftermarket sources are built by the same
&gt; manufacturer as the kit that you get from the VW dealer? Is there only
&gt; one manufacturer of head gasket kits for these engines?

There are two brands that I know of, both made in Germany - Rienz (sp?) and
Elring.  The Rienz comes with sealant, while I have seen the Elring kits
packaged both with and without sealant. I have sold plenty of both brands
(and we have used both in our repair shop), and have not noticed any
discernable difference in quality between the two brands.
