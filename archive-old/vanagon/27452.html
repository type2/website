Subject: 3k on GEX &amp; blue ridge trip

          ok, one more trip report but short this time.  the rebuilt
          GEX has just shy of 3k on it now.  we left fully loaded for
          a 5 day jaunt to the n_dot_carolina mountains early friday
          morning.  13 hours later we were at the black mtn campground
          about 550 miles from home (gainesville, fl).  not bad for an
          old bus and staying off the super slabs.  the great thing is
          that on our last trip up there with the old motor we were
          struggling up the mountain in 2nd gear doing 30-35 mph tops.
          this trip we hit all the mountains as last time but in 4th
          gear doing 45-50 all the way.  what a motor!  other than a
          tight, newly rebuilt unit the only drastic change was going
          from a 28 pict to a 31.  and our gas mileage was right
          around 20 mpg, just like before.  we love it, even had heat
          (sort of) and needed it on friday night when the temps went
          down into the low 30's according to two thermometers in the
          campground.  and we really liked the newly installed
          jallousy windows.  i never liked leaving the rear hatch open
          while sleeping, too paranoid.  so now we crank open the
          windows and the screens keep the bugs out.  life is good!

          bad points were few.  one morning when i fired it up first
          thing, a cloud of blue smoke bellowed out the exhaust.
          never happened again.  several times on the way up friday i
          had to bump the solenoid with a screwdriver to get it
          started (once in heavy traffic, oops).  i'll tend to that
          this weekend, i hope.  brakes are mushy, but not pulling.
          i'll look at adjusting and flushing the system this weekend.
           of course all the weekend stuff will be scheduled around
          watching my Indians win the series (serious finger crossing
          here!).

          didn't see one other splitty the entire trip!  had a note
          pinned to the windshield from jonathan  up in black mountain
          but didn't hook up with any vw people.  sorry jonathan.
          hope to plan better next time.  this was our 4th anniversary
          trip and we're still acting like teenagers in love, silly
          stuff.

          in short, great trip, terrific bus, see ya in tampa and land
          o'lakes soon!     ray &amp; lea hale   gainesville, fl
