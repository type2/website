Subject: WTB: VW camper (westfalia?) in Newfoundland

 I'd like to buy an older VW camper later in the summer. Something that's still
  fairly reliable and would make a decent resoration job. The main problem is
 that I have limited funds.
 BTW are all 60s 70s campers westys?
 Anybody with a camper in Newfoundland that you want to pass on to a good
 home, please drop me a line via email.
