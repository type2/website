Subject: Re: Question: ...releasing clutch and *CLUNK-INK noise occurs

The clucking noise is in mine to if its a ding then I believe its the cv's in
the drivetrain.  I havent figured out if that is a major problem yet or not
but I hope not because hose cv's or the halfshafts are very pricy
items.....goodluck to ya and if that cv in the front is an outter cv get it
done immediatly because accidents can happen when those break....horrible
price for those too......
