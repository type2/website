It was interesting to monitor oil temperature during my recent trip to the 
Canadian Rockies. In a nutshell, what I observed was that oil temp would 
stay relatively stable at 190 when I was on a flat highway driving under 65 
mph. However, with sustained climbing in a lower gear, especially 2nd, temp 
would quickly shoot up to 230 at which point I would pull over and give her 
a rest. Also, once I made it up a pass and leveled out or headed down, oil 
temp would drop quickly.

I expect that you'll say - &quot;Ahhh,  that's only coolant temperature, What
about the oil temperature?&quot;  It is true that presently I am not able to
monitor oil temperature.  Oil temperature can be much more volitile than
coolant temperature, but after a sustained period under extreme 
condiditions
the coolant temperature will inevitibly rise if oil temperature remains 
very
high.  This would have been refelcted on the coolant temperature gage 
before
long &amp; it wasn't.
