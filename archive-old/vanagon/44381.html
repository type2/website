Subject: RE: WTB: 73 Bus seats with headrest (Connectiuct area)

Do Vanagon front seats have the same rail spacing as breadloaf vans?  I
have some nice Vanagon front seats and I don't know whether I can market
them only to Vgoners or to some bussers.  (They are dark brown vinyl and
nearly perfect.  Also have a brown corduroy middle seat.  That one is
free to a good home.)
