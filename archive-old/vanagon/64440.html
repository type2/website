&gt; Mine is glued on too - Needed to be carefully pried off.    After I
&gt; repositioned the wiper arm, I just reglued it with silicone.

If I remember right, it's not so much that it's glued down, BUT that there
is a COMPLETE tight seal! Air leaking (being sucked!) into the AFM will
screw up the function of the AFM as well as lead to it's early demise
(considering all the particulates that may get sucked into the AFM along
with the 'dirty' air).
