&gt; I've had two estimates to put in my RMW headliner - Both were around
&gt; $500 (for the labor) How does this compare to historical costs via 
&gt; vanagon list members?

Bring it to me and I'll do it with your help for the cost of a few beers
and an afternoon of work, I've done 4 late Bus headliners but never a
vanagon admitedly.
