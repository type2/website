Subject: Magazines by coincidence

A couple of magazines have been mentioned on the VW mail lists lately.  I 
happened to get two yesterday and noticed a couple things I thought I'd pass 
along.  

(dune Buggies and)hot VWs June issue.
	&quot;Swimsuit Special 96&quot;

Classic Auto Restorer
	Feature Restoration (one of several) 1966 Volkswagen Beetle
	Not a detailed article - more useful information here on a 
	regular basis.  But quite appropriate I'd say.
