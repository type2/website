Subject: speedo glass/lighting question


&gt;we also replaced our defunct and dirty and dim speedo yesterday.
     (snip)
&gt;about 8:30 pm we went for a ride and yes indeed the bulbs were bright!


The glass has fallen in, in my '71 bus speedo. And, the lighting is
VERY dim, despite all the bulbs being good. The fuel gauge, to the
left, is still plenty bright. Are these two events
related? Does anyone know how to lift the glass back up, and
fasten it in place where it originally was? Now, it has dropped down
flat about 1/4 inch, and rattles against the face of the speedo.
