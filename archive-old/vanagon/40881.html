&gt;&gt;&gt;Bullet indicators finished in '62 but 612483 would definatly
&gt;&gt;&gt;make this bus a '60.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Then I have proved nothing, since Steve said the number could also be
&gt;&gt;read as 672483, which would be a '61 according to the NEATO list.
&gt;
&gt;Tom F,
&gt;
&gt;  We have proved that its either a '60 or '61. But its impossible
&gt;to prove anything with inaccurrate details.

That sounds like my cue.

This thing definitely had bullet front signals, and tiny round rear
taillights. And, I'm 90% sure the second digit of the serial number
was a seven.

Most people have opined that this would make it a late 1960 or a 1961.

There seems to be some question about whether bullets existed in the
1961 model year.

Tom F mentioned that the number 672483 would be later than '60 - according
to the NEATO data at http://www.mindspring_dot_com/~deasterw/chassis.html

He also cited a source for the change over date from bullets as:

Anyone else?   :^)
