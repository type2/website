&gt; From:           derekdrew_at_aol_dot_com

&gt; I relocated my rear heater over to the side so I could get a big space under
&gt; my rear seat where I keep my winch for getting unstuck when I drive
&gt; irresponsibly.
Derek:
What side did you relocate the heater to?  Wow, that must be some 
kind of winch. What brand of winch is it and how do you hook it up to 
your rig?
