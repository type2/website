Subject: pouring petrol on the 'flaming' embers

Anybody notice how snitty the PC crowd of perpetual chatterers have 
become since getting their wrists slapped 2 years ago (&amp; if you wish to 
hear the pointy end of the Perfectly Self Righteous check out good ol'
Moonbeam Brown on KPFA 94.1)

But we all know that Big Daddy knows best - so who needs democracy; just 
the word will do ('People's Democratic Republic of...')

Me?  I just wanna '96 Syncro!!!  (Vanagon, not EV)
