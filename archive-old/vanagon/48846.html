&lt;&lt; One FLAPS says that CV mfg sells axles cheap to keep

 So the question is, anyone have experience with these brands?
 I can put CV's on my own axles but at twice the price of a 
 whole, already assembled axle, WHY SHOULD I? (other than the Muir 
 philosophy of getting close to one's transportation . . . )

Are these axles new or rebuilt?  If new, why the exchange?  My experience
with rebuilt axles for all cars is that they are a crap shot with a 30% come
back rate and cheap boots that fall off in a year or so.  Basically the
rebuilds are either cleaned units that come from the junkie or the are worn
out units machined to take oversize balls.  Of course the surface hardening
is no longer there and the cases wear prematurely.  I can get rebuilt shafts
for many cars for less than the cost of new boots and hardware, but usully I
end up better off repacking the oild ones, repalcing the boots and putting it
back on the car.  I have about the same success as those rebuild.  If you
plan on keeping the vehicle, make sure you get new joints if that is wheat
you need.
