Left Boston at 12:30 to pick up my co-conspiritor in crime in Providence
Rhode Island.  What a useful vehicle my '65 micro deluxe is.  The PPO
had fitted a westy fold-out bed (from the bay-window era).  Slept at the
beach near Matunick,R.I. and caught some tasty remnants from Hurricane
Marilyn.....
