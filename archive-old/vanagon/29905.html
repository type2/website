Subject:      Road Test - 1996 Volkswagen Microbus 2,6i (South African Vanagon)


VW Microbus 2,6
CAR, September 1995

The comfortable people carrier gets an engine upgrade

Stepping into a &quot;Kombi&quot; for the first time after a length absence is
like visiting an old friend at home - some of the furniture and
ornaments may have changed a little but the comfortable ambience is
still there.  The large, near-horizontal steering wheel, the panoramic
view, the wiggly-wand gearlever, the walkabout space, the distant thrum
of the rear-mounted engine is all so familiar.  The latest incarnation
of Volkswagen's stalwart people carrier is the Microbus 2,6i which,
on the face of it, is little changed from the 2,5i.  But the increase
in capacity is significant, for it marks the venerable Volksie's
continuance into the new era for unleaded fuel.

Regular CAR readers will recall that, in the May and August issues last
year, we reported that the Microbus platform was one of the first
affected by Volkswagen AG chief executive Ferdinand Pie:ch's
programme of reducing the group's (VW/Audi/Seat/Skoda) chassis platform
count to just four.  However, Uitenhage announced they had gained a
stay of execution on the South African market, hence the update for
unleaded fuel.

Which is not to suggest that superseded 2,5-litre engines are not suited
to unleaded, since according to VW, they are compatible with adjustments
which will be advised in due course.  What is likely is that the lower
octane of unleaded will result in some power loss for the 2,5-litre
versions while the extra capacity of the revised engines will largely
compensate for the loss.

The increase in capacity from 2480 to 2553cc has been achieved by
increasing the stroke from 92,8 to 95,5mm, the bore remaining at 82,5mm.
On currently available fuel this has done nothing for the engine's
maximum power and torque outputs, which stay at 100kW at 5000 r/min and
200 N.m at 3500 r/min respectively.  What it HAS done is improve the
torque at 2000 r/min from 175 to 190 N.m, an increase of almost 9 per
right where it counts, low down in the lugging range.

BOSCH MOTRONIC
Part of this improvement can be attributed to the adoption of the more
up-to-date Bosch Motronic M1.5.4 electronic management and fuel
injection system in place of the same supplier's mechanical K-Jetronic.
Among the Motronic's features is a fuel supply cut-off on overrun,
designed to aid fuel economy.  A cyclonic air cleaner has been adopted
to improve filtration for extended engine life, with the bonus of
better intake noise suppression.

To make the most of the better torque characteristics, the final drive
has been changed from teh previous 4,833 to 1 to a longer 4,571 to 1.
Newly designed and larger diameter alloy wheels, up one inch to
fifteen, and lower profile radial tyres, 205/65 in place of 205/70,
contribute to the alteration in overall gearing.

The overall effect of all these changes are improvements in fuel
economy and top speed but slightly inferior acceleration compared to
the 2,5i, which just about makes the exercise worthwhile considering
the nature of the vehicle. In real terms, you are not likely to notice
the loss of spinting ability but you will appreciate fewer trips to the
petrol station.  Interestingly though, our Microbus' test weight was
50 kg more than the Caravelle 2,5i we tested in May 1991 which, given
the blunt shape, might account for some of the lost urge.

On the other hand, it is also possible that the quirky gearlever
arrangement worked better on the Caravelle than on the Microbus. First
is isolated left and back of the gate and the change to second takes
time and concentration to execute smoothly; it is the biggest drawback
to initiating rapid progress.  Our testers even attempted standing
start runs from second to try to bring down the times.  The ploy did
not work but it did highlight the engine's torquey nature - second gear
pullaway in normal driving is an accepted technique ...  Of course,
driving full-bore through the gears also brings about the characteristic
porpoising effect, so it pays to take it easy and from your elevated
seating position watch the rest of the traffic scurry about.

FUEL ECONOMY
Claims of improved fuel efficiency are substantiated by the test
vehicle's 7,43 l/100km at 60 km/h against 8,33 for the Caravelle.
At 80 km/h the figures are 8,58 against 9,9 but at 120 km/h the two are
practically identical as aerodynamics come into play.  Our fuel index
of 15,86 l/100km for the test vehicle was backed up by a tank-to-tank
consumption, including the actual full test programme, of 16,25.

To put things further into perspective, a comparison of key figures
is given below.

COMPARISON BETWEEN CARAVELLE 2,5i AND MICROBUS 2,6i
                                        2,5i       2,6i
Top Speed (km/h) .....................   159        163
0 - 100 km/h (secs) .................. 14,40      16,11
l/100km at 100 km/h .................. 11,94      11,33
Power/mass ratio (W/kg) .............. 58,14      56,50
Mech. noise at 100 km/h (dBA) ........    70         68

We expected to achieve improved braking performance with the Microbus
because with the bigger wheels come 277mm diameter ventilated front
discs in place of 258mm solid discs.  Unfortunately, our test vehicle
had a tendency to lightly lock up the driver's side rear during the
stopping sequence with a result that the average time was practically
identical.  Remember, too, the extra mass.

Otherwise, the Microbus formula is much as before. The seats are covered
in typically practical flat woven cloth but do not offer enough support
for ache-free distance travelling. The flat door panels, straightforward
facia and overhead lit instruments give away the vehicle's ancestry, but
it all adds to that familiar feeling and does little to detract from the
vehicle's demeanour.  The minor controls appear robust and the accuracy
of the speedo and odo continues to be nearly spot on.

One desirable option fitted to our test vehicle was the overhead air-
conditioner, which worked well to bring down the temperature in what is,
after all, a large interior with a big glass area.  Outlets are
strategically sited along the centre of the roof and the air is boosted
by a four-speed fan that is a bit noisy on the top two settings.
However, it is not necessary to maintain full blast for very long.

SUMMARY
The &quot;Kombi&quot; has endured and the title has been the accepted generic
term for such vehicles for almost as long as they have been in
existence. Plus points are a comfortable interior and a smooth, quiet
ride. Ready access from the front seats to the rear is a boon too.
&gt;From the driver's point of view, however, the awkward gearchange seems
to be something that can't be fixed. Notwithstanding this criticism,
VW's Microbus remains the benchmark for locally available family
carriers and with its new heart, looks set to carry the mantle for some
considerable time.

TEST RESULTS:   VW MICROBUS 2,6i
CAR is the only South African motor magazine whose performance road
tests are carried out at sea level - where naturally aspirated car
engines achieve their peak performance - on a flat road to
internationally comparable standards.

The test car carries a crew of two, a full tank of fuel and German
Peiseler electronic road test equipment.  CAR's fuel consumption testing
is done with a Pierburg flow meter linked to a Peiseler computer.  Top
speed and overtaking run times are averaged both ways on a level road.
