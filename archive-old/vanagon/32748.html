Subject: Campground

Pretty soon I'll be asking you for help on personal problems. I 
have a campground membership in NY for sale, where should I post it 
on the net?  Also, the lever on my heater control broke.  VW has a 
new design so it would look funny.  Does anyone have old levers for 
an 86.  It's the second one from the bottom.
