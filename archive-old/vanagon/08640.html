&gt; OK so by that logic (to play devil's advocate) no. 1 should also run hot,

&gt; and the exit as well....I am wondering if the foklore about no. 3 carried
&gt; over to all air-cooled engines regardless of design, and I would believe
&gt; if I hadn't also heard about strengthening/welding no.3 cylinder in Vanagon
&gt; engines because of  some weak point.....another myth?    DC

&gt; To your first point, I don't agree. Cylinder #1 is further rearward in the
  car (okay, okay, it's only a couple inches). You can check this on your
  Vanagon by looking where the spark plug wires go through the sheet metal.
  
  I have heard mention too about welding up something in Type 1 cases around
  cylinder #3, but I don't understand why it is done. Could it be related to
  pulling studs?
