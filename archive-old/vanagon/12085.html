Subject: Rotting Fuel Vapor Lines


I have an 84 Vanagon that needs the fuel vapor recovery lines replaced 
(the ones that go from the top of the tank to the various overflow 
cannisters.)  The damn things are hard (impossible?) to access.  It 
appears to me that I will have to drop the fuel tank, can this be true?  
If I go to that much trouble what else should I do while I've got it out?

Thanks
Chris Arai
