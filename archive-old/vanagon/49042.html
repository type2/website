&gt;Yes I know this has all been gone over before but I didn't pay all that

&gt;I'm hooking up an Aux battery.  I want to isolate it.  What subtlties do I
&gt;need to know about isolators?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;The battery I'm installing is a 12V deep cycle gel cell (Wheel Chair
&gt;battery). This battery is relatively tiny (less than half the size of a
&gt;regular battery) and yet will provide 31 hours of juice at 4amps.  These
&gt;batteries will provide two times, or more, the capacity of a conventional
&gt;deep cycle battery at low amps (under 25) loads.   It also needs to be
&gt;charged like a conventional auto battery and NOT like a standard deep
&gt;cycle.
&gt;
&gt;So, what  do I need to know about isolators?  I have one I bought about 20
&gt;years ago (when I was just a tyke) from JCW and never installed.

I had a wheel chair battery installed under my seat.  My bus came with an
isolator already in place under the seat.

For more information, see my proto-Vanagon FAQ at

And feel free to contribute!  I just started this today!
