Subject:      Inside refigerator fans

I install 12V fans inside my refrigerator and was just going to wire it to
the vehicle with a switch somewhere so I can turn it on and off. But it
occured to me, is there anywhere on the fridge that I could wire the fans
to so that they would go on when the fridge is in use? I looked at the
wiring diagram and I did not see any way to do this. But perhaps someone
out there more skilled at reading wiring diagrams might see something I
missed.


Thanks
