Hey Volks,

I have just received our german vintage-magazine and could
see, that the Vanagon with chassis-no. 0001 is for sale
here in our town (20 mls from wolfsburg). Date of first
registration is july 79. Is anybode over the big lake
running a vanagon museum and looking for this rarity?
Even when I dont think so, good to know No. 1 lives...
