I think eight hours labor is excessive. Maybe five with the obvious learning 
curve.  To purchase this particular fridge new you need to refinance your 
house.  You should learn to service the fridge yourself as it does have to be 
done occasionally.  The less you run it on propane, the more often it will 
need cleaning.  Also, it is extremely important that all seals are sealed 
correctly.  Especially the chimney and baffle plates.

Subject:	RV dealer pricing on refrigerator

I have had my 84 Wolfsburg GL Westie for 1.5 years and the refrigerator 
has never worked on propane (but did work on electricity and battery).  
Owing to a job change which suddenly presents an unexpected 2 week 
camping oppoortunity we are heading north from Valley forge PA to Acadia 
NP next week. I was interested in trying to fix the propane refrigerator 
myself but I did not have the time to follow the wonderful directions 
sent by Sean Bartnik to clean the jets, etc. 


  So I brought it to an RV dealer (Media Camping in Media PA).  Last time 
I filled up the propane tank I saw gas leaking out of the fillup valvue. 
I wanted a pro to look into that before we went away.  While I was 
getting that fixed I also wanted an estimate on the refrigerator.  It 
worked two way and we usually used coolers.  I made it clear that I would 
take the unit without any work on the refrigerator, I wanted an estimate 
on the frig and I had to have the propane tank looked into.  Based on 
phone and personal conveyance of that I brought and left the vehicle.
  

I asked for a dometic estimate and (naturally) could not be told one 
until it was pulled out and looked at.  They test and soaped it up and 
found no leak.  They did lubricate a reset button just outside of the 
fill valvue.  Good work, no problem here.


Well a _good_  and _thorough_ cleaning was what it took to fix the 
propane dometic and I picked up the unit today and I was presented with a 
bill for $380!  No parts were included.

This represents 8 hours at $45 per hour.  They never called me with an 
estimate and never in my wildest dreams did I think it would get this 
high without any phone call or any parts.  Seems like he put on the 
blinders, fixed it and billed me without any regard for my wallet. I 
would not have had him go beyond $200 though I did not tell him that.  I 
cannot imagine ever valuing this refrigerator on propane to the tune of 
over $300.  I was told that $380 was typical for this work after it was 
done but never beforehand.

I would like some list opinions on this mechanics bill and lack of any 
estimate (as a matter of fact he never, ever called me in the four days 
he had my daily driver).  

What do you think? 

Does this seem exhorbitant?  

Does it seem like business as usual in the RV repair business not to get 
an estimate? 

Anyone have any idea how many hours were spent on the leak check? If 1-2 
of the 8 were spent, it would leave 6-7 for the stove?
