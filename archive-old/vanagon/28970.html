&gt; most excellent cleaner
&gt; 

&gt; Besides HOT, soapy, water, an excellent cleaner is Wurth's
&gt; Cleans-All.

Actually, I could use general advice: after dirt-roading it for a few
days down in Panamint, Saline and Death Valley, the inside of my engine
compartment looks like someone spilled a box of talc.

What's the best way to clean everything out (can't believe it would be
OK just to shoot a hose in there...)  Can your most excellent cleaner
work on all my engine parts?  What about belts, fabric hoses, etc?
