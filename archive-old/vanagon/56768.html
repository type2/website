Is there a good place to get odd parts without having to pay the high
dealer costs?
Items that I am looking for to put on my 86 GL
Power Steering fluid cap
Washer fluid cap
pipe that runs out of the water pump to the front of van (I think that the
thermostat housing is on the end of it, but haven't received my Bentley
manual yet)
small round fasteners that hold the panel to the inside of the hatch
(brown)
o2 sensor
Tach and heater control dash lights
Hatch supports


any help would be greatly appreciated.
