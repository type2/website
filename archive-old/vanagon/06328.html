&gt; I guess my post was too vague.  Everyone who responded seems to think that
&gt; I already have screens in the side sliding windows.  I don't, just the
&gt; sliding windows.  I was looking for a way to add screens yet still be
&gt; able to slide the glass window or somehow remove the screens on my 1987
&gt; Vanagon.
&gt; 

The way that Country Homes Campers does the screens (or have in the past)
is to take a screen, which looks like it might be from a pickup camper
shell, and _screw_ it into the body.  The aluminum frame around the screen
is big enough to cover the whole window and the black rubber gasket.  Most
I've looked at have the screws going through the black gasket material
into the body.

Not really removeable, but...
