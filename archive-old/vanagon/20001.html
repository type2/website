Proud as punch I was.

Nearly at 111,111 miles it was.

Getting back into reading the list properly, too.

The blue_thing went in for a service this morning.  Beautiful morning, with
the sun in the blue sky and the birds singing.  The service guy was good
enough to give me a lift to work and I was feeling good.

He came back an hour later.  D'ya know that sinking feeling you get when you
know something bad has happened?  Like an accident or that?  I got that
feeling when James walked through the door and didn't smile.

&quot;Go on,&quot; I said, &quot;how much will it be.&quot;  He said the head gasket is gone.

Great.  Another three hundred pounds down the swannee.  I *KNEW* I should
have sold it before this.  God, I'm depressed.

I've been sitting at home, indoors, all night in thirty degree heat
(centigrade) because it is so strange not having the blue_thing outside to
just sit into and whizz around.

Addiction is a sad, sad state.

O' course, now I'll fall in love with the damn thing all over again 'coz it
will be running well and I'll fix the dents and replace the windscreen and
vacuum the carpets and buy new tyres and ... 

Transporters, huh?

Not so much a means of transport.  More a way of life.

This deep and meaningless diatribe is sponsored by SAM motor services, where
T4s are resurrected.  :I
