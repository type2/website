&gt;Any oddities.  I think I noticed the fuel filler in a different spot, but 
&gt;maybe it depends on the vanagon year there.

I'm not sure about the years of manufacturer, but generally VW makes &amp; sells
vehicles in Europe about 1 year before importing them to the states.  Syncros
were imported to the USA in 1986, 87, 89, 90, &amp; 91.  In 1988 they sold
leftover '87s. 

In 86 &amp; 87 they were available in 3 models: Vanagon GL Syncro, Vanagon Camper
Syncro (adds poptop &amp; table), &amp; Vanagon GL Camper Syncro (adds stove, fridge,
sink, etc).

In 89 there were two Syncro models, the Vanagon GL Syncro and the Vanagon GL
Camper Syncro.

For 90 &amp; 91 there were also two Syncro models, the Vanagon Syncro (a basic
model with a rather spartan interior) and the Vanagon GL Camper Syncro.

All Syncro models have their gas tank located above the transaxle and the
fuel filler mounted near the right-rear corner of the van to accomidate this
gas tank location.

One Syncro only option is the rear differential lock.  If you intend to get
the most out of your Syncro traction-wise, make sure your van has one of
these.  You can tell if it has one by the inclusion of a little added control
panel with one knob located below the radio on the dash.

Good wheels for a Syncro are BFGoodrich Radial All-Terrain T/A in size
27LT8.5x14.
