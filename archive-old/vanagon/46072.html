Subject: front brake pads, how?

     Hi all,
     
     I am trying to replace the front brake pads on my 87 Vanagon 
     Westfalia.
     
     Bentley says that once the old ones are replaced, &quot;push&quot; the piston 
     back into the caliper housing so it will have enough clearance to fit 
     back down over the pads.  The diagram shows a tool of some sort which 
     is used to accomplish this.  Of course, I don't seem to be able to 
     push it in by hand.
     
     What is the best method for resetting the piston when replacing the 
     front brake pads?  Is there a FAQ file or a web site somewhere that 
     explains this process?
     
     I tried searching the archives, but found wading through thousands of 
     unrelated and incomplete threads too tedious.  I also could not find a 
     FAQ section on the subject, though I'm sure there must be one 
     somewhere.
     
     Thank you in advance for any help you can give......
