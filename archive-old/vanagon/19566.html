A Problem With My Pop-Top Seal


A problem with my pop-top seal?
A look confirmed my fear;
It seems the thing had begun to peel
Along the sides and rear.

I was quite gentle, used little force;
To remove it in one piece;
Cleaned out the rust, used too much glue
And avoided getting fleeced!

Alistair
