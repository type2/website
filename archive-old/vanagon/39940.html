&gt;  could anyone please tell what this green foam is in my engine? I have a 78

&gt; the  last time that I checked my oil that there was this green, slimy foam
&gt; on the oil filler cap and in the oil breather. I have an moderate oil leak
&gt; from the starter if that helps. Also is there any way to tell if you have a
&gt; collapsed lifter (hyd) ? I have this very light, erratic qlick sound, that
&gt; almost sounds like tapping, but it disappears past idle. Any insight would
&gt; be geatly appreciated. Thanks.

I'd also be interested in any replies to this since I just recently noticed this 
foam on my oil filler neck and cap.  I have no oil leaks that I can see.  So 
please reply to the list or if I've already missed some could you (david) please 
forward them.

Thanx
