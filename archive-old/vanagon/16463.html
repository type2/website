What do you say folks?
Everyone want to send Thom's Boss a &quot;please keep Thom on the Vanagon list&quot;?

&quot;He's very helpful to us and we would miss him&quot;?

		Or Maybe

&quot;Hey Fascist Scumbag!!!, He has rights to communicate with whomever
he likes!!! Screw you!!! Blah! Blah! Blah!!! Slave Drivin' Pig!!!&quot;...

Maybe the first is better :)
