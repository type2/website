Subject: Something positive

Since I am a new list member myself I believe that a lot of new members
may get the idea that old VW busses (and new ones) are not that reliable.
Hearing everyone's problems can be somewhat discouraging.  So lets hear some
good news such as how long some of you list member's old high milage busses
have run without any real problems.  Has anyone out there been able to go  
one year (everyday driving) with a 15 year old or greater, high milage bus
without any breaksdowns or problems (besides regular maintanence)?  I would
be interested in the reliability one can get out of these &quot;classics&quot;.

'77 Westy (about 3 weeks of trouble free driving)
'74 bus (never ran, parts bus)
'82 rabbit (at least a year of trouble free driving)
