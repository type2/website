Subject: Re: Waving Vanagon drivers (again)

&gt;Well, here's the scene in BC as experienced by a loaf driver:
&gt;
&gt;- Splitties ALWAYS wave back, even in city traffic.  &lt;snip&gt;
&gt;- Loafs wave back about 1/3 of the time in heavy city traffic, almost all
&gt;the time on 2-lane highways.  Westies wave more.  &lt;snip&gt;
&gt;- Lowered busses (when I rarely see them, and if I can't shoot them
&gt;first) never wave.
&gt;- Air-cooled bricks sometimes wave, but rarely.  Water-pumper bricks wave
&gt;back even less frequently.&lt;snip&gt;
&gt;- Eurovans: are you kidding?  &lt;snip&gt; I've
&gt;NEVER gotten a wave, or even an eye-to-eye look, from ANY Eurovan around
&gt;here on a paved road.  Yuppie mobile. &lt;snip&gt;

Oh, I get it...it's a social hierarchy! A pyramid of coolness. Let's see
here, check if I've got this straight--splitties are the coolest, step
down, step down, step down, and EVs are yuppie-mobiles (read &quot;scum&quot;).

Hmmm....something bothers me about this.._dot_can't quite put my finger on it,
but it smacks of, YES, THAT'S IT!     &quot;stereotypes&quot;

Stereotyping. Let's personalize this. I used to have long hair and drove a
loaf for many years. In fact, Tobin, I've loved reading your trip saga
because it reminded me very, very much of a trip I took to Mexico in my '74
VW van back in 1980 (but that's another looong story). I guess you would
have liked me then. I'd have waved back.

Now my hair is shorter and I drive a Eurovan. I'm driving a yuppie-mobile
you say, deductively then, I must be a yuppie! (in your eyes) Gee, I guess
I'm not cool anymore. I'd still wave though.

Funny thing, I feel like exactly the same person! By God, I think I am the
same person.

To paraphrase an old song: (sung to the tune of &quot;War&quot;)

        Stereotypes, uh, what are they good for?
        Absolutely nuthin'.....say it again, uh...

I've caught this feeling of &quot;cooler than thou 'cuz my veedub is (fill in
the blank-older, newer, air cooled, water cooled, super modified, stock,
etc.)&quot; from a number of posts in the past and let it go by. This time
(right phase of the moon, just enough caffeine, right time of day) I just
felt like responding. It kinda bugged me; I feel better now.
