&gt; Must be David S., I already threw mine out... seems they need to be 
&gt; fidged after being opened.  

You &lt;shocked&gt;opened&lt;/shocked&gt; yours?

&gt; And on the serious side (do we have one?), I always carry PowerBars for 
&gt; emergency food. A few of them and some water will last ya for a day or 
&gt; two. 

I am a believer in canned foods for camping, cause they don't spoil and are
cheap.  I usually eat out when driving around, and pick up some fruit and
drinks along with the canned stuff for when I am camped.  Some of my most
beloved canned foods are pork 'n beans, Campbells thick and chunky soups,
and chili.
