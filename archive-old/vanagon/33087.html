&gt; People have expressed concerns that: A) EV's don't have enough problems to

&gt; everybody should go out sell their house, quit eating, and get another
&gt; job so they can afford one!

Tracey:
A) No problem, I had enough trouble in 7 months to go around amongst all
the list members with EVs if they feel &quot;left out&quot;.

B) Problem.  My troubles will definitely skew the data!
