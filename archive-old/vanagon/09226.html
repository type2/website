Subject: MORE ROOF RACKS

&gt;The solution is to 1) ignore their weight limitations as being put there for
&gt;insurance reasons, 2) reinforce their basic bracket by adding some metal
&gt;under the pop top to distribute the load around better, or 3) add a 3rd or
&gt;4th cross bar. 

&gt;I do a little of #1 and a little of #2.


Derek:

Could you give a little more detail regarding your #2 solution?

Also - for all Vanagon rack users - have you resorted to carrying a ladder with 
you, or is there some clever scheme to getting boards/bikes on and off without 
one?

The folding ladders in the new Camping World catalog have caught my eye, and I'm 
trying to figure out a clever place to store one, but I'd rather avoid the whole 
thing if possible.
