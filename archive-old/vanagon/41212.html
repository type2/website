&gt;he says he carries new OEM units for $25.00 each, says they are
&gt;&quot;Stabilis&quot; brand made by Fichtal &amp; Sachs in Germany and that they are
&gt;the original equipment.

I got mine at one of the Houston BAP/Geon parts houses.
I think the left/right average was around $25.

I discovered something during the swapout on an '89 and a '90 - if the
right strut has only lost it's &quot;lock&quot; feature, but still has lots of
pressure - put it on the left and just buy a new right strut.

I found that this makes for a hatch that is almost hard to pull down, and
it cost half as much to get there...

And I wound up with spares for next time.
