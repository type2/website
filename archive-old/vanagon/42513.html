Subject: Re[2]: Exhaust Repair Bummer

     I wanted to do this this weekend but neither Orchard Supply or Home 
     Depot have M8 x 1.25 metric nuts in stainless (or any metric 
     stainless). Does anyone know of a source near the Pasadena/Glendale CA 
     area. 
     
     Thanks,
     Jeff


&gt;&gt;I recently used a combination of stainless steel nuts, bolts &amp; washers and 
&gt;&gt;anti-sieze compound when reassemblying my exhaust. Although won't be able to 
&gt;&gt;see the fruits of this change for years, I'll bet that the next 
&gt;&gt;dissassembly/reassembly will go much much easier.  I would recommend using 
&gt;&gt;only stainless fasteners with anti-sieze for VW exhausts.

     
&gt;I believe in this also.  When using stainless hardware it is extremely 
&gt;important to use anti-sieze.  If assembled dry, the threads will gall and 
&gt;strip while being assembled. Never to be removed again.
