Subject: Swivel Seat  part needed!!!!

Help!  I have the 2 of the 3 pieces needed for a Complete swivel seat.

  I have the Slide and the other Square part.  I think the part I need 
is a &quot;Round&quot; part?

  Any body that has one of these please e-mail me ASAP.  I found myself 
in a bind on this  and would like to remedy the problem.

  TIA
  Kyle
