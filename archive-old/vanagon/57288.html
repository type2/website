Subject: Alloy wheels

Alloy Wheels International,  OEM for most major makers, own a company 
called Revolution Wheels,  they custom make wheels to fit all sorts.

IMHO RFX style wheels look best on VW bricks, five spoke color centres 
alloy rim finnish.   I'm still saving for my set.


Check your specialist wheel supplier, or contact me and I'll try to find 
the factory fax/phone no's

Any European Vanagonners on this list?  Me? Based Netherlands.
