Subject: Starter relay bypass repost

Thanks to all those who reponded to my &quot;no start&quot; post yesterday.  While
that problem is still unresolved, several people were interested in the old
'hot engine - no start' problem that I said I had fixed with a with a second
solenoid.  

I sure can't take any credit here.  This proceedure is covered in Muir and I
am reposting a description which originally was put up by Jack Reed.  Hope
you don't mind Jack.  It's in the archives, but sometimes people have
trouble finding things.  I used this description and no more problem....at
least not that problem.  Thanks Jack!


&gt;I'd suggest you read this all the way through before you lay finger to 
&gt;van to familiarize yourself with what you'll need in the way of parts and 
&gt;the general flow of the work.  It's not that it's all that complicated, 
&gt;it's just that my stream of consciousness style of writing isn't meant to 
&gt;be an instruction manual but more of a general information guide to the 
&gt;task at hand.  Plus it's a lot less daunting once you've got a picture of 
&gt;the job in your mind.
&gt;
&gt;Basically what you're going to do by installing a relay prior to the 
&gt;starter solenoid is to create an amperage amplifier.  The wire from the 
&gt;ignition switch that normally runs to the solenoid will instead be used 
&gt;to dump voltage/amperage that's very near to the battery's full potential 
&gt;directly to the solenoid.  The reason that you'll be doing this is 
&gt;because the wiring, connectors, etc. between the ignition switch and the 
&gt;solenoid have degraded due to corrosion and resistive build up to the 
&gt;point that not enough current gets to the solenoid to fire it when the 
&gt;starter is hot.  In some extreme cases you won't be able to turn the 
&gt;engine over even when it's cold.
&gt;
&gt;The solenoid itself can be gotten from Checker (or its equivalent) for 
&gt;around $5US.  Just ask for a generic Ford truck solenoid.  It should come 
&gt;in one of two configurations, either a cross, with the two fat terminals 
&gt;(outputs) in one plane and two smaller terminals (inputs) in the other plane.
&gt;Or the two output terminals are in one plane and the two input terminals 
&gt;are on one side of the output terminal plane.  If you're not sure what's 
&gt;what ask the counterman (or woman, as the case may be).
&gt;
&gt;I'm going to preface the rest of us this by saying that since this is a 
&gt;generic document, if things aren't exactly the way I describe on your 
&gt;vehicle, don't panic, I'm just describing my setup and yours may vary 
&gt;from it.  If you can't figure it out ask the list or write me direct for 
&gt;advice.
&gt;
&gt;Before you start doing anything at all back by the starter, I'd suggest 
&gt;that you disconnect the negative battery lead and lay it to the side of 
&gt;the battery.  That way you won't accidently fire the starter, get your 
&gt;hair, shirt, whatever, stuck in the pulley, get your face ripped off and 
&gt;your wife, girlfriend, whoever won't sue me for a bazillion dollars for 
&gt;not warning you about this in the first place.  If you don't know enough 
&gt;to disconnect the electrical system when working on the starter, 
&gt;alternator, etc., I'm not sure you should attempt this in the first place.
&gt;Read the Idiot's Guide for a good primer on basic safety techniques.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Find an appropriate place to mount the solenoid by the starter.  If the 
&gt;only place to attach it is to the starter itself, make sure that it's a 
&gt;ground point and that vibration won't somehow cause the solenoid to come 
&gt;in contact with a hot lead (positive 12 volts), usually a red wire.  But 
&gt;not always, so check with a voltmeter if unsure of the wire's polarity.
&gt;
&gt;Remove the wire from the spade clip on the end of the solenoid and attach 
&gt;one of the post type connectors that you picked up at the same time you 
&gt;bought the solenoid.  Forgot 'em?  Better go buy some and take the 
&gt;solenoid with you to make sure they're the right size.  The old wrap the 
&gt;wire around the post and tighten the nut trick won't work if you want 
&gt;this to be a trouble-free installation.  Pick up a few feet of battery 
&gt;cable and a crimping tool while you're there.  Read on for the rest of 
&gt;the parts list.
&gt;
&gt;Attach the ignition wire (the one you just removed from the solenoid) 
&gt;to one of the input terminals, it doesn't matter which one.  Then run a 
&gt;new wire, preferably a black or brown one, to a ground point on the body 
&gt;from the other input terminal.  Once you're sure that everything's tight, 
&gt;run a fat (8-12 guage, whatever you have) cable from a direct battery 
&gt;connection to one of the fat terminals.  I used the battery connection at 
&gt;the starter, you can do the same.  Then run another new line (also ~10 
&gt;gauge) from the other fat terminal to the exposed spade clip that the 
&gt;original ignition wire went to.  You can use the original connector, so 
&gt;long as you didn't cut if off too short and you can use an electrical splice 
&gt;to connect the two ends.
&gt;
&gt;Several things to make sure of:
&gt;Make sure that all connectors, posts, are clean and bright.  Polish them 
&gt;with emery cloth if they're not.  Make sure that all your crimp 
&gt;connections are tight by trying (a bit more than half-heartedly) to pull 
&gt;them apart.  Redo the connection if they are rent (asunder, that is).  
&gt;Make sure that all screw/nut connections (like the hot lead on the 
&gt;solenoid) are nice and tight as well.
&gt;
&gt;If you're not sure which of the wires to the solenoid is the one from the 
&gt;ignition switch, put a volt meter in line between the wire you think is 
&gt;the correct one and ground.  With the volt meter on the Volts setting, 
&gt;have handy friend temporarily reattach the positive lead to the battery 
&gt;and turn the ignition key to the start position.  If you get 
&gt;approximately battery voltage, you know you've got the right one.  Make 
&gt;sure handy friend removes the battery cable before proceeding.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;I did this to my Rabbit and van about two years ago after experiencing 
&gt;more and more degradation of the starting system and have had 0 problems 
&gt;since.  I used a Bosch fog light relay on the Rabbit in lieu of the big 
&gt;Ford solenoid since I didn't think it was necessary (and because I had a 
&gt;spare one).
&gt;
&gt;Take your time, don't cut your wires until you're sure they're the right 
&gt;size and you should have a nice, neat installation.  Use cable ties to 
&gt;keep possibly errant wires out of the way of spinning, moving things and 
&gt;to prevent them from rubbing against sharp metal edges and shorting out 
&gt;the whole works at midnight in a blizzard after a bachelor party.  Hell, 
&gt;you shouldn't be driving then anyway, go crawl in the back and go to sleep.
