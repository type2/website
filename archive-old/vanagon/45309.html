&gt; &gt; Can't wait!!! Now, I went to set the time on my digital clock, the one in
&gt; &gt; the middle of the dash cluster. I obviously pushed too hard on the little
&gt; &gt; button because now my hours keep blinking and I can't turn them off! Any
&gt; &gt; ideas? 
&gt; 
&gt; Along this same thread, I too have a similar problem.  When I push in the
&gt; minute button, nothing happens.  Plus over the past year or so, the LC is
&gt; all slowly turning black.  Must be something warm in the lower section
&gt; because that is where it has turned black and is slowly creeping upward.
&gt; It's this way with the key on or off so it must be part of the clock
&gt; circuit or the wires feeding to it.  Any suggestions?

Sounds like both of you have a lot of time on your hands...
