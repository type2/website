Subject: building your own oil temp gauge.

Well, the university deleted my slip on Friday, and I just got back the mail 
services. 

Someone was saying that they saw some homemade gauges at a show sometime, 
and I got thinking about this.  I decided that I would take a shot at it, 
and was extremely sucessful.  I used a sender (number 38-5004) which fits 
water cooler VW's from 74?-89, mounted in the strainer plate.  I used a 
meter from a old tape deck, and a quad opamp chip- a LM324.  I ended up with 
a scale from dead cold to 250 degrees F.  The whole meter was calibrated 
with a restarant thermometer.  I basically tuned the full scale reading to 
250 and then marked every 20 degrees on the face.  I drew up some graphics 
to make the final faceplate, and it looks great.  It is a really simple 
circuit, and was a breeze to build.  

I'll give a full blow by blow account of the circuit if anyone is interested.

When I first installed the circuit in the bus, I thought the thing didn't 
work.  It turns out that with the air temp at 80, the bus (1600 stock DP) 
runs at 150-160 degrees.  I took the bus out on I81 and went up and down 
some mountains.  The highest the temp got was 190 degrees.  I was working 
the bus real hard though.  I also found that if I coasted down the 
mountains, I could lower the temp by 20 degrees.  

I'm currently working on a oil pressure gauge, I'll let you know how that 
turns out.

On the same line, using a similar op amp, you could easily make a exhaust 
analyzer.  For those who are complaining about the cost of DMM's.
