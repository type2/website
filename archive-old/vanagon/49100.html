I'm sure that's in a typical differential, not a Vanagon's

&lt;snip&gt;
&gt;Now the picture shows some stuff I can't fully comprehend, I assume
&gt;this to be some sort of friction clutch mechanism, but not like the
&gt;factory multi-disc clutch unit, nor like modern Torsen or Quaife geared
&gt;units. 

No. There's no clutch, it's engagement is by metal to metal mesh of large
wide &quot;teeth&quot;

&lt;snip&gt;

This type of differential is generally for off-road use.  It normally stays
in the locked postion until you go around a corner, then it unlocks and
allows differential action.  While on the road, the locking &amp; un-locking can
cause serious handling problems if your not very careful.  A lot of
off-roaders use these in vehicles that see very little on-road use.

For much more info on all sorts of locking &amp; limited slip differentials see:
