Good idea.  My reflectors are dirty because the lens are cracked and
allow rain water in.  Every 3 weeks, I get to take them off and dump the
water out of them--but that's a different story.  I plan on getting some
of the 3M film that you can put on headlights to protect them from
stones.  I figure it ought to keep the rain out.  Anyway, when I do,
I'll take your suggestion about cleaning the reflectors with one change. 

I'd propose using a baby bottle cleaner brush instead of the stiff
wire.  They are approximately the right length, have fairly soft
bristles (I would still wrap it in cloth--maybe an old sock?) and are
somewhat flexible so that it would, IMHO, be easier to get into all the
weird angles and corners of the reflector.  Plus, the bristles would fit
easily through the bulb hole.
