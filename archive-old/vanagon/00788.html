Subject:      Re: Rear axle nuts

I also use the 3/4 breaker with the pipe method.  Works like a charm.(also
essential for flywheel removal.) Does anyone have any ideas about how to
get a stuck drum off after the nut is removed? I've tried everything except
a drum puller, which may be the last resort... Thanx, A Van Fan
