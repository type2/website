Hmm - changing to yellow lights is still standard advice to Brits going to
France, and various methods of doing it are widely on sale. Have to check on
that. Beam diverters (to change the headlamp beam direction) are available
in clear or yellow. 

As I recall it's not been mandatory for visiting vehicles to have yellow
lights for some time, although (allegedly) white lights were unpopular. I'm
sure I saw yellow bulbs on sale in France last year, although I didn't drive
that much in the dark to see what was normal.

I was glad of the yellow beams when, coming off the ferry on to the first
English roundabout I got my priorities confused and nearly totalled a
passing taxi - with a bit of luck he thought I was French!
