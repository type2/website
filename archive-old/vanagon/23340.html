Subject:       Propane... again.

Hi Everyone.  Just a little blurb on propane tanks.  First off, there 
is a thermal couple in the fridge that will shut down gas flow if the 
flame blows out so you won't get gassed in your sleep.

I saw a demo film on propane tanks/explosions, etc a few months ago.  
These tanks are *very* tough.  The film showed these tanks going off 
rooftops, and no problems.  The weakest link are the lines and 
attachments to the tank (regulators/valves/lines).

It is these attachments that may sever in a crash and cause problems. 
With propane, you get not only a fireball, but a wicked explosion 
that is very powerful.

Propane is very safe providing basic safety cautions are heeded.  
This is all I am trying to say.  I hope that I haven't been a pain in 
the butt.

Harry.
