&gt;I thought my live would get easier finally having a VW with hydr. lifters
but
&gt;I'm not so sure after reading all this stuff lately on adjusting them.
&gt; Solids look pretty good now!

When they are good, they will pump up on thier own.  I personally do not play
with them, I just replace.  When rebuilding engines, I usually replace the
set.  I do not bother with this pump and prime and dissasemble stuff.
