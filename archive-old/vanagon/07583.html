Just thought I'd share this with the other Eurovan owners/operators out 
there as well as any others who are interested.

I recently returned from another long road trip; approx. 3,000 miles.

It was a good trip, overall, (the thrill of sitting behind the wheel all 
day, day-after-day is starting to 'wear').

Some rather significant events that may be of interest .....

For the first leg (approx 1,000 miles) I pulled a tow-dolly with a Toyota 
on the dolly. Went through the hills of western Maryland, West Virginia 
and Missouri (not bad; but got down to 35 MPH in only one instance going 
uphill). Had to put up with noticeable cross winds through Ohio and 
Missouri. Had to put up with CRAZY truck drivers all along the route (I 
noted that the drivers on this trip seemed determine to take themselves AND 
someone else out of the human-race .... got un-nerving information when one 
driver stated on the CB that he had been driving for over 16 hours and was 
determined &quot;to get to Kansas City or hell&quot; before he stopped ... I pulled 
over and he passed me with a double trailer and he was moving at better 
than 80 MPH, by my estimation ... this was in Illinois).

For the second leg, I did plenty of in-and-about driving in the area, after 
separating from the dolly.

On the return trip, I took the same route, but without the dolly.

I kept a decent log of miles, fuel and etc. I used one quart of oil for the 
entire trip (more than what's normally there).

I averaged 20 miles-per-gallon for the whole trip. For my Eurovan having 
32,000 miles and under the stress-conditions, I'm STILL very happy with the 
Eurovan.

I hope at 32,000 miles others can say the same.
