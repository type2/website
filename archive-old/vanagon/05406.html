&gt;So Thom Fitzpatrick says:
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; &gt;Just wanted to add that the new title says SALVAGE prominently, so there 
&gt;&gt; &gt;is no mistaking what you're getting. Some states don't do this.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Good point Bob, but I've heard of DMV screwing up and NOT putting it on 
&gt;                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
&gt;&gt; there.  There are also problems with some insurance companies not 
&gt;&gt; covering salvage vehicles for certain types of policies.  I'm a bit
&gt;&gt; fuzzy here 'cause I haven't actually done it...
&gt;
&gt;Boy, that's an understatement.  Gosh, I sure love paying my CA taxes
&gt;when I hear about the DMV paying 40 big ones (that's 40 million folks)
&gt;for a computer system they can't use.  I'm REALLY gettin' to hate
&gt;this state. :[

Here in Georgia the DMV messes up too.  Several years ago when they switched
to new style license plates (with peaches on them) they were several months
behind in entering the plate numbers in there system.  You took a risk by
going out of state and getting stopped.  People have been placed under arrest
because their number did not show up on the system meaning that it was a
stolen vehicle.

I have other fun stories about the DMV but I will save them for another day.
