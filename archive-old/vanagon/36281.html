Subject: More on anti-freeze





OK- I called Prestone to get their story on anti-freeze. They claimed:

   1 - Phosphate free anti-freeze is only needed over seas where they
        have hard water. what???? I never heard this before, but I have
        used thier anti-freeze for 60,000 miles over 5 years so far with
        out problem. So it could be true!

   2 - When VW said &quot;PERMANENT&quot; they ment it! The reason for
        anti-freeze replacement is because the rust inhibiter in the
        anti-freeze gets depleted as the iron in most engines rusts.
        The Vanagon engine is mostly ALuminum alloy and rubber/
         plastic hose. The only iron in the cooling system  I no of is
         the cylinder walls. Therefore no need to flush the system.

   3 - Last Perstone does have a phosphate free anti-freeze sold in
        a silver container. I'm sure it's more expensive. No I don't
        work for them.  Besides Vanagon head gaskets change the
        anti freeze for you.                 Eric Zeno
