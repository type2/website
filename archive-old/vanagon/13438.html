Subject: Re: need faucet top

Martha, I may actually have the part burried in our garage.  I replaced our
whole faucet three years ago after the dealer broke it!  (smart, eh?...and
yes, they paid for it)  I will try to find it this weekend for you and let
you know.  It is an original '85 faucet with the tilting spout...if it
makes a difference.  Wish me luck as I venture into the unknown..... :-0
