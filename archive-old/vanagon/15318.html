So Walter Haefeker says:
&gt; 
&gt; On my friend's 87 Vanagon Westfalia there is a propane leak coming out of a
&gt; tiny hole in the box just left of the main valve.  What is the purpose of
&gt; the box?  Is the hole part of a relief valve or does the box have to be
&gt; replaced? 
&gt;  
&gt; Where can I get spare parts for the propane system?  Is there a good place
&gt; to get this fixed in the San Francisco Bay area? 
&gt;  
&gt; Walter
&gt; 

Well, if no one else posts the locations in your area before I find my
Dometic authorized service listing, I'll post it then.

I don't know what that box is for at this moment.  Sorry.
