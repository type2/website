Hi!

I tired to email you about this but was told:
  Your message could not be delivered to 'wlund_at_bart.ccis_dot_com
  (host: bart.ccis_dot_com) (queue: smtp-ns)' for the following reason:
    '&lt;wlund_at_bart.ccis_dot_com&gt;... User unknown'


I would like to know more about the gas heater.  How hard would it be
to install in a '77 westy that did not originally come with one?  I
have the second battery to the left of the engine.  Will this
interfere with the heater?  Do these heaters work well?  Can they be
used while the bus is in motion?  How much are you asking for it?
Where are you located?  I will be hitting the road for a cross country
trip in a couple of weeks and might could come see it in person.

Thanks,
Kirk &quot;I love my camper, but I do chill easily&quot; Hilliard

'77 Westy

P.S.  Would anyone care to relate their experiences with this type of
heater?
