Trip Planning???

Everybody,

I have been using 2 programs for several years by the Delorme Company: Street
Atlas USA  and AAA Map 'n 'Go.  They are both fantastic programs for a very
low price (under $45 each).

In fact, I have a hand-held GPS (I'm also a Cessna Pilot when not driving my
Syncro Westy) that I plug into my laptop and follow my progress to ANYWHERE!
 I Love it!!!

Now, you don't need a GPS reciever to use these programs, but Delorme also
has a special price for Street Atlas USA and a dedicated GPS for your laptop
for about $125.00 total.

BTW,  I just finished 2 trips from Seattle to Colorado Springs using the
above programs.  The preferred route from the Seattle area to the proposed
camping site is through Yakima.  It took me apx 8 hours to get to Caldwell,
ID which is about 2 hours past the camp site if I remember correctly........
 The AAA Map 'n 'Go program will print out those neat AAA strip maps for you
IN COLOR!!!

Check it out!
