Subject: '65 Deluxe Bus Rebuild Question

Item Subject: cc:Mail Text
     I am rebuilding a '65 type 225 1500.  (No, of course I'm not going to 
     keep it 1500)  I'm looking for someone who's been this route before.
     
     I have taken the body to metal, using POR 15 Stripper and protected it 
     using the zinc phosphor coating and have it in my garage to keep it 
     out of the rain (it hasn't rained since May) so I'm not worried about 
     rust.  I have all the glass out and have stripped the interior out.  
     The tranny is being powercoated to match the new outside red, as well 
     as the tins.  I have treated all the floor pans with the POR 15 metal 
     preservative and rust preventative.  I am restoring the speedo to 
     prime condition. I have a 1776cc being built, even now.  All the 
     interior that will go back in will be in leather (man, am i crazy or 
     what?).  To say the least, I am trying to do a right job here.
     
     My question is this:  Should I drop the front axel an rebuild it, 
     since I'm this far in it?
     
     It didn't have a steering problem to begin with.  There was no play in 
     the box, no noise, no hard steering, anything.  But since I'm this far 
     down, should I go ahead and rebush it, re king pin it (or whatever), 
     etc.
     
     Is there someone who can give technical assistance while I'm doing 
     this, kinda talk me thru it while I'm in the process?
     
     I have Muir's idiot manual (it had my name on it, so I took it) and 
     Bentleys Shop manual. It doesn't look like that much of a job, 
     specially since I dropped the transaxel.
     
     Any help would be greatly appreciated.
     
     Thanks.
