&gt; Here's question for the other Syncro owners.  When my gas gauge reads 
&gt; almost to the bottom of the reserve area, it only takes about 16 gals 
&gt; to fill the tank.
&gt;
&gt; It seems like the gas gauge is calibrated for a 16 gallon tank rather
&gt; rather than the bigger 18.5. Any other syncro owners notice this?

I can't speak about Syncros but you described the same traits for the
non-syncros.  If you fill up the tank when the gauge gets to the bottmm
of the reserve area you only put in 14 gallons.  At the top of the reserve
its about 12 gallons.  I found out about the 14 gallons trick when I tried
to stretch the range out on a long trip.  I got nervous when the needle was
below the reserve and was about 30 miles from the nearest town.  I pulled
in the first gas station and was surpised that it took 14 gallons and
there were 2 more in the tank.
