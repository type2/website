Subject: RE: Good rubber



i also found the conti's terrible in snow.
even the weeniest amount of slush. a friend had
problems getting out of a wet grass parking lot
with those tires on his van.
currently running laredos all round at 44psi.
the ride is not harsh, steering effort at low
speeds is low, and they are better in side winds.
even though they are rated as m&amp;s, they do well
in the snow, but not as good as my old 72
westy, (more wt. on rear wheels?)

saw an ad for an aquatread type light truck
tire made by dunlop - any info?
