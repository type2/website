&gt;   These speeds are well above the cruising speeds of the *Planes*
&gt; I fly. The 145 number is AMAZING. Let's see some Asian *sedan* 
&gt; do that!

How about a Lexus with the 4 liter V-8?  :)  Okay, so it's a coupe, but
so is the Corrado...

Since everyone is doing it, here are the maximum speeds I have achieved...

=============================================================================
David Schwarze		    '73 VW Safare Custom Camper (90 mph, big downhill)
SAIC Comsystems, San Diego  '73 Capri GT 2800 (110 mph, chickened out)
schwarze_at_nosc_dot_mil	    '87 Mustang Lx 5.0 (140 mph)
			    '77 Ford Taunus V-6 (118 mph on German autobahn!)
			    '71 VW Beetle (78 mph on German autobahn, downhill, flat out, gutless piece of crap, heh heh, I was getting passed by VW Polos and Fiat Pandas, but I digress...)
