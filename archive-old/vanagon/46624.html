If your fuel pump relay is getting flakey, then there is a good possibility
that the main relay isn't far behind for the same behavior.  The main relay
supplies, among other things,  ignition.

Unfortuantely, the main relay is unique, there is not other relay in the car
that  you can swap for it like you did the fuel relay.

My suggestion:  replace BOTH the fuel and Main relays.  Do it now on your own
schedule and convenience so you won't get standed and need a tow or worse. 
The relays are not too expensive ($15 ea?) - I carry spares also.

Don't ask how I learned this lesson.  :-(
