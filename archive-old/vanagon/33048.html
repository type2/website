Actually, the horse logo is the symbol of Westfalen, Germany.  The 
shield of the state Nordrhein/Westfalen has two fields the left one is a 
river (the Rhine) one a white(?) field, and the right one is a horse on a 
yellow field (Westfalia). At the top of the shield in the middle, is a 
small red rose, known as a &quot;Lippische Rose&quot;, the symbol of a region 
called &quot;Lippe&quot; which is within the state. Class dismissed.
