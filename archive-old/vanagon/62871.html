Subject: Re: 87 Synchro - too good to be true ?

  Lets use a little common sense here. Any Car That was 10 years old,
  with 100k miles would be selling for scrap pricing, if this were
  the 1960's. Because of autos lasting longer and better design, this
  deal can be reasonable. BUT in MY Opinion you are on the edge!

&gt; Hello,
&gt; 
&gt;     I've found an 87 Synchro which is selling for $4200.  100K miles, nice
&gt; body, paint, etc.  Is this a good bargain or a sign of trouble ?  I've haven't
&gt; seen any 87's priced as low as this, and the fact that this is a Synchro (4WD)
&gt; makes me even more suspicious.
&gt; 
&gt;     Would anyone care to comment on the pros and cons of having a Synchro
&gt; rather than the 2WD version ?  I assume that there will be more maintenance
&gt; problems and less MPG, and since I don't plan to live in snow country for the
&gt; next few winters I wonder if I'll really need the 4WD (although it would be
&gt; nice in places like Baja California).
&gt; 
&gt;     Thanks in advance for any advice/comments/suggestions !
