&gt;&gt; Hi all: This kind of reminds me of when my wife and I went to Ensenada in
Baja one time. We left the bus parked on the street for a few hours while we
did some tourist stuff. When we returned there was a flier under our
windshield wiper that I promptly removed. Since I don't know much Spanish
the only word I knew was &quot;especial&quot; so I knew the flier had something to do
with a special that someone was running. We left in the bus and I started to
hear this reet-reet sound. I didn't think too much of it, I thought the
E-brake might be hanging up a little or something. Later on that day I
caught up with a friend and we were talking, and I pulled the flier out of
my pocket. We looked at it and decided it was from a brake shop having a
special on brake jobs. I didn't think much of it at first then I thought of
the new reet-reet sound. !!!!!!!!! I went to the rear wheel and pulled the
cap. A local had taken three lugbolts out leaving two in the wheel and they
were next to each other. Every time the wheel turned it stressed the
lugbolts and made the sound that you get when you tighten a lugbolt very
much. The shop obviously thought I would hear the sound and think &quot;Brake
trouble, lucky for me this guy is running a special&quot;,and he would get a job.
So when in Baja watch your nuts (and lugbolts).
