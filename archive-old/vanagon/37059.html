Vanagoons:

There's a propane/CNG thread on the Vintage list... I was wondering if 
anyone here has done a conversion and knows if anyone around specializes 
in them. It seems like it'd be a great way not only to pass the 
emissions test but also run a cleaner car on general principles...

Anyone out there done this?

I have a 1966 Ford F-250 that has run on LPG for the last oh....20 years or 
so.  300,000+ miles on the truck....my family has owned it since it was new. 
 We converted it to single fuel (propane) in the late 70's.

Will be glad to respond privately, or to the list if sufficient interest is 
manifest.
