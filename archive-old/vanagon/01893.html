Subject: oil for not-so-temperate climates


(for jim)

In upstate NY with three months of 70-90, three months of -20 to 20, and
six months of 30-60 (all degrees F) I run Castrol 20W-50 for the hot
season and 10W-30 cold season. I dont drive my 83 that much so i do
two oil changes a year about a month away from each season.

This is for an 83 Vanagon diesel, 83 Quantum, and 90 Audi 80
(guess which one is SO's car .....oh well she paid for it - as well
as all the others !!!!
