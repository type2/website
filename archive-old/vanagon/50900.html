&gt;I am pretty sure this is a Recall item.  I remember seeing something about
&gt;it in a book at the library.  I recall noting that the recall was for
&gt;'86's on and I have the same problem in my '85

unfortunately, the recall on the 86's was for fuel pickup and vapor locking
(they repositioned the fuel pickup hose in the bottom of the tank). they
did this to my 86 AFTER it died on me in rush-hour traffic in Colorado
Springs, CO!!! :(
