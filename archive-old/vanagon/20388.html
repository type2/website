Subject: Cheap Bentleys!!!

       Cheap Bentleys!!!   Cheap Bentleys!!!   Cheap Bentleys!!!

The manuals, not the cars, Berry! ;-)

I have found what has got to be the lowest prices on Bentleys that I have
seen in a long time and it is from all places J.C. WHITNEY!!!  They had
actual photographs of three of the manuals, not Artists conceptions,
and_appeared_to be unretouched.  They are as follows:

63-67    $72.99     84XK0977Y

68-79    $28.99     16XK6225R

80-92    $65.99     16XK6901N

This is from catalog number 45K, the spring/summer 1995 catalog for
Volkswagens.

The also have Haynes and Chiltons (yuck! puie!!) for $9.99

I think I'm finally going to get one! The Bentley not the Chiltons.
