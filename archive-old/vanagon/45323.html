&gt; I am going to look at an 87 Westy tonight. Considering buying it.  
Ad in
&gt; paper says: 119k miles, new tires, $7900.  The guy told me it's a GL in
&gt; great shape.  Tires are reinforced Michelins.  I have a 78 Westy and an
&gt; 82 Vanagon, but I don't know waterboxers and I'm not familiar with
&gt; propane Westies.
Check those tires! Mine had 2 new tires, but they were just cheapo 
passenger tires which I had to replace due to poor handling. They 
should be LT load range C, or reinforced 185 'R' 14. Weight rating 
should 1450 lbs+ at 40psi +. If they only go to 35 psi max, they are 
probably no good. Check carefully for coolant leakage, signs of 
crustiness around heads, head studs. Drive it for at least an hour &amp; 
monitor coolant level in tank. Check for leakage of rear heater core 
under seat - expensive to replace. Try to get rad fan to come on by 
heating up, then idling for 10-15 minutes. It should come on when 
gauge is at about 2/3 or so. 
Also check complete Westy pieces - front windshield curtains, rear 
curtains &amp; bug screen for hatch, screen for roof vent. Check fridge 
operation, esp with gas! Should feel cold after 10-15 minutes lit, 
and pilot LED on kitchen 'dash' will glow faintly when switch is on. 
(Lower left LED indicated by 'frost' symbol.)
Check sink water pump opration.

&gt; What should I &quot;look for/test/beware of&quot; that is specific to this 
model? 
&gt; I know how to check out a used car in general.  I'm looking for things
&gt; that are different on these late model Westies.  I've read the FAQ's on
&gt; recalls, etc.  I brought my tools and jack, so I'm ready.  Just point me
&gt; in the right direction! TIA.
