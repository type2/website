&gt;&gt; Well Steve, it's an 82 Westfalia.  I've looked under the rear bench seat, and
&gt;&gt; didn't notice a heater type thing, 



If  your vanagon is air cooled, then the dash knob is for a gasoline burning 
hot air heater that is underneath the centre of your van. It is tied into 
the normal heating system. The knob should be green, with symbols of a coil 
(ie. heating coil) and cross (since you'll need to pray some to get it 
working). The knob lights up when you turn it CW, and should tick, as it is 
a 15 minute timer. It should work without the key in the ignition. These 
things don't work in various ways, blown fuses, bad relays, motors, fuel 
pump, thermal switches, ignitors ...... You got cold air?, so the main fan, 
fuses, relays sound OK. Probably an ignition problem, no fuel/spark. You 
need a Bentley manual to get into this, and advice. tim s.    
(oh, and if the knob has only a white bar on it and the dial says 0 1 2 3, 
then it's for a rear under the seat heater in a wasserboxer. Big, ugly, and 
hard to miss, the heater, not the van!)
