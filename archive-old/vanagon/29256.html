Subject: Ball Joints




G'day.

I seem to be in need of replacing the ball joints on at least the 
left side of the Campmobile -- there's about 1/4 - 1/2 inch of 
play in the 2-oclock/8-oclock axis. Muir doesn't do ball joints, and
Bentley looks pretty forbidding.  Who's done this and what tips would
you care to share? Will the joints come out without a press? Do new
ball joints come with boots, or will I have to track those down?  There's
an alignment shop across the street, so I don't think I'll have to worry
about alignment (if indeed modern-day wrenches like aligning VWs). Anything
in the archives?

Any encouragment/handholding/advise appreciated
