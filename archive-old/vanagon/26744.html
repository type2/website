Subject: WANTED: Mini-bus, pref. Vanagon


  My husband and I are looking for a used mini-bus that is in a not
too shabby condition --- we are planning to move back to NY state in a 
few months, and thought that we could use it to move the 700 miles of 
highway back --- not to mention the 10+ best friends we travel with all 
over the country to conventions and such.  What kind of price should we 
expect for a mini-bus that has nothing too fancy (air-conditioning is 
unecessary, same goes for a radio/tape player), without too much rust, 
and with well-maintained parts.  We live in Ann Arbor, and don't have a 
car, and would greatly appreciate it if someone on this list has or knows 
someone who has a mini-bus for sale.
