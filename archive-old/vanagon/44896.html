Knew I forgot to mention someone.  My current tranny, which is 5 years
old, is quite vehement about jumping out of fourth when put under
load.  It's almost to the point where I can't hold it in with my hand.
Others have reported that Transform seems to be lowering their
quality.  At this point, I'm quite reluctant to have anything more to
do with them.
