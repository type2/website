&gt;&quot;Officer, you must be mistaken. Do you really think this van can go 80mph?&quot;
&gt;
&gt;I got a warning instead of a ticket that way in a '78 Westfalia. :)

That reminds me of what happened last year to my mother.  We were all in the
vanagon going into our nice city of Richmond Hill which has a 35mph limit.
The highway going in has a 55, 50, three 45 and 35 into town.  My mother gets
stopped doing 60 in the 35.  The officer let us go because he said that he
used to own a bus (didn't say what) and that we could not have been going that
fast!

As for being slow that's another story.  After high school I got two warnings
for doing 35 in a 25 and a 50 in a 45 when I had the 72 bus.  I guess you can
get away with it if you are doing over 60 because nobody believes that you can
go that fast.
