          I really dont want to read your foul, hostile language the
          first thing in the morning.  This is unsolicited for me too!

          Just learn some courtesy and ask  in a nice way to be off
          the mailing list!

          SAN FRANCISCO where we try to be kind and tolerant of many
          people!
