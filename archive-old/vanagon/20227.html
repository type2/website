Subject: Bus (or anything else) tow-bar


To All:

1.  Go to a busy tire shop that does trucks.  Get a used truck tire.  If they
want more than two bucks, go someplace else.

2.  Go to a hardware store.  Buy about a hundred feet of small diameter line.
 (Rope to you sandcrabs)  Also buy about eight feet of welded chain, a bolt
to secure it to itself, washers &amp; nuts as required and some bailing wire.
 (Look in the cement section; they call it Tie Wire.)

3.  Frap the two bumpers.  (That means to pad their inner edges so they can't
cut through the rope.)  Use a coir floor matt or sections of rubber hose that
you split with your knife.  (Knove in sandcrab lingo)  Fasten the frapping
securely so it can't slide around.

4.  Lash the used truck tire to the tow vehicle.  Each turn of the lashing
should be drawn up snug using a half-hitch.  Take as many turns as you can
but keep the lashing as close to perpendicular to the bumper as you can.

5.  Back the tow vehicle up to the towed vehicle so the truck tire is in firm
contact with the middle of the front bumper.  Lash them together as in #4.
 Rig the chain between the two vehicles in a figure 8 passing through the
tire.  Give it a little slack then fasten securely, safety wiring the
fastener with bailing wire.  (That is, wind some bailing wire around the
exposed threads so the nut can't back off, use some more bailing wire to
fasten the wrappings to the chain.)

6.  Use a small bungee cord to loosely fasten the steering wheel of the towed
vehicle to the door or seat.  The object here is to provide a positive return
to center and act as a shimmy damper.

7.  Rig your lights.  Test them.  Readjust your outside mirrors.  

8.  Test-drive.  The thing will tow; damn near anything will tow.  Test how
it stops.  Get the feel of it.  You are now about thirty feet long, weigh
nearly six thousand pounds and have a joint in the middle. If the tow vehicle
is a bus or bug, forget 4th gear unless your engine is bigger than stock.
 Drive the torque curve; keep your revs up to promote cooling.  Drive slow
(you will anyway) and keep your thinking about a mile ahead of the vehicle;
it will take you damn near that long to stop.

9.  If you encounter high winds, stop and wait them out or find a different
route.  The thing can get away from you very easily on steep descending turns
if you get slapped with a cross-wind.

10.  I don't know if this rig is legal, I kind of doubt it.  But I hauled a
vehicle about 700 miles (2 days) across three states and never got stopped.
