&gt;When I was a kid, our next door neighbor, Wendell, a bus guy, looked just like
&gt;St. Muir, (who actually got me into busses) gave me 2 tins of &quot;survival
&gt;biscuits&quot; dated 1956.  I actually tried some.  The most rancid stuff I ever
&gt;ate!  They came in big 5 gallon tins...

whoa, now! THAT was the civil defense stuff ... that crud was packed away
in schools and public buildings back in the &quot;cold war&quot; ...those biscuits and
the sugar-candy stuff was TERRIBLE!!! (we busted open a 5 gallon tin of the
stuff once :) ... i guess it was designed to make you think that radiation
poisoning was something to look forward to. :(  anyway, the army/navy/marine
stuff was MUCH better than the Civil Defense Emergency Rations.
