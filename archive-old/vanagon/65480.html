I decided to buy a 'drybag' that kayakers use, a few feet of white chain
link, and clamps to hold it down.  Won't know til next season how well it
works, but the cost was about $80.  Jim McCarthy, '87 Westy, Somerville, MA

&gt;     I got a firm quote of $95 materials, $180 labor just to have a canvas
&gt;     bag custom made for the Westfalia roof rack (cool idea if I might say
&gt;     so myself; sized to fit, straps and buckles to coincide with the tie
&gt;     down locations, flap-covered heavy-duty zipper, etc.)
