Subject: Daytime Running Lights

I got some real good advice from a parts guy at a Canadian VW dealership. It 
turns out that you only need one relay for daytime running lights instead of 
two, and the resistor shown in the Bentley manual is resistive wire and is no 
longer used in new applications - they let the headlights operate at full 
power even during the daytime. The relay's function is to turn off the DRL low 
beams when you turn on the high beams - evidently you can't run both filaments 
in each headlight at the same time without meltdown. I found a suitable VW 
relay at my local VWFLAPS (K &amp; K Automotive in Orlando, really good guys) for 
$10.00. Tomorrow its off to the dealer to purchase some pins for the fuseblock 
connector since I'm going to use an existing relay position (#4) to install my 
DRL relay.

My VW dealer has a 1994 Passat Wagon, fully loaded with 20,000 miles for 
$14,995.00. Any opinions on Passats would be appreciated since they are 
offering me a real good trade-in deal on my 91 for it.
