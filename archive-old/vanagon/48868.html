Subject: Re: Which Oil Filter??


Eventhough I don't have a Vanagon, I have exculsively used VW  and MANN 
(which makes the filters for VW) filters on my 86 GTI (210k miles) and my 
EV. MANN filters also show up in filters marketed by Bosch.

I'd rather go with the OEM stuff.....never scrimp on oil/filters, tires and 
brakes!  ;-)
