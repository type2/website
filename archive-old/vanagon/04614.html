&gt; I had a 72 westy for 17 years and I always considered it a dog of a year.

&gt; You had the horrible combination of the first year of the type IV motor, but
&gt; it was little larger than the beetle motor in the 71 and earlier motors.
&gt; while the later busses had those nice 2.0 litre motors. Meanwhile, the type
&gt; IV motors cost double the beetle motors that 71 busses had. 
&gt; 
&gt; And to kick me in the shins, the engine could only be accessed from the rear
&gt; instead of the top like later 70s era busssses. It made it a pain and near
&gt; impossible to work on the carbs, which always seemed to need work.
