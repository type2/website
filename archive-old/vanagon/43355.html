Subject: Re: More on wheel&amp;bumper colors

Mike White asked:
Was this color (L82 &quot;Silver White&quot;) used basically every year (50-67)? 

Ellis replied:
I would LOVE to act like a guru know it all, but I cannot claim to say yes
as the &quot;Gospel truth.&quot; I am not a guru by any means. I would think it was
but can't confirm. I doubt if anyone would know, care, or shoot you if you
applied it to the wrong year.

I have even heard of folks lucky enough to have totally straight bumpers and
all of the overrider bits have the wheels and bumper items powder coated in
a &quot;good enough&quot; white and mount them on  $25,000.00 supposed concouse
d'elegance buses bound for Japan.
I too would have done this on the Westy Resto but had a bit of Allmetal
bondo poop in the bumpers to make them look straight. Spending the extra $$
on a bumper shop that can do a perfect job on the bumpers and powder coating
might make sense to some due to the extra durability factor. I unfortunately
chose the bumper shop with so-so slam-bam abilities. I know now of a local
Phoenix shop that is a few $$ more expensive that do nearly perfect work.
Balance the body shop labor rate/time or your sweat equity versus the cost
of the more expensive/more talented bumper shop and powder coating to decide.
I also bet dollars to doughnuts that if painted, the bumpers will get at
least minor scratches during assembly. Likewise for the mounting of the
tires on the rims. Allow extra paint/time for touchups and color sanding if
&quot;perfection&quot; is your goal. Krylon and a 400 grit works for others. Don't
forget that making * yourself* (or your customer) happy is the key!

BTW: Another major lesson learned in the Resto From Hell was to dry fit the
bumper pieces together and to the bus prior to paint/powder coating might
save gnashing of teeth later on!
