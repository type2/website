&gt;What kind of tires does everyone run on their vans? I have a pair of 185R14 
[deleted stuff]

I just bought a full set of Michelin LTX's, and I'm incredibly pleased with 
them.  They are all season/mud and snow rated.  The contrast to the old tires
is incredible, but the old ones were badly worn, and a wheel alignment was
WAY overdue, so some of the improved feel is due to that.  I was driving in
heavy rain last weekend, and even when I drove through running water an inch
or so deep, the van did not feel like it wanted to wander or hydroplane.  Even
my Volvo doesn't feel as stable on wet roads.
