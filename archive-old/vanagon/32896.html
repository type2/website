Subject: 71:Timing:Carb: I can't get no satisfaction

I wouldn't dare post another timing question if I wasn't convinced that 
I've tried about everything. Obviously not *everything,* but at least 
everything practical for my budget.

My problem: the dreaded flat spot...but it's bad enough to interfere with 
my driving. I do have the 009/34PICT3 combination and I'm on the lookout 
for the proper vacuum advance carb. In the meantime, PLEASE, please, help 
me if you can. I'm getting worn out by this problem.

I did close off the hole in the lower plate in the carb (I think the 
lower one is the &quot;throttle plate?&quot;). This seemed to help with idle, but 
also may have exacerbated the flat spot??? I'm unsure...it's all blurring 
together.

My basic approach to date goes something like this:
1. Find TDC on #1. Verify rotor position.
2. Check dwell and set timing on 009 to 28 ATDC _at_ 3500 RPM
3. Adjust idle per Bentley. I corked off the vacuum line to the brake 
booster to assure no vacuum leak problems. I make sure the engine's nice 
and toasty.
4. Check timing again and adjust as necessary.

With this procedure, the flat spot is noticeable. I can fiddle around with
carb adjustment and lessen the flat spot, but I haven't even come close to
getting it to go away. The only time I didn't have &quot;flat spot&quot; problems
was with the carb adjusted to the point where the exhaust was smokey and
then I was probably getting 5 miles/gal and the bus wouldn't idle at a
stop sign...obviously not good. I thought I had the problem solved the
other day after blocking that hole in the lower throttle plate, but I
really only solved my poor idle problems. Once the bus warmed up, the flat
spot was worse than ever. 

I'm now contemplating taking the bus into a local shop and paying big
bucks to have them do the adjustment. I really don't want to do this, but
I'm feeling a little defeated by this problem.

Thanks! Joe
