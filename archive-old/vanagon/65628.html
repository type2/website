&gt; Darrell, I agree with you 101%.
&gt;
&gt; I have double checked your references and I think that you are right:
&gt; The &quot;v&quot; notch is 5% BTDC and the &quot;u&quot; notch is TDC. I  measured the
&gt; pulley, calculated the 5% offset from &quot;u&quot; notch and its smack on the &quot;v&quot;
&gt; notch.
&gt;
&gt; I just set up our '86 Syncro Westfalia as per Bentley and took it for a
&gt; short spin and it runs well.
&gt;
&gt; As I think this information is of general interest to the list, would
&gt; you like to post it to V_at_G?
&gt;
&gt; Larry
&gt;
&gt; BTW, I think that if too much advance is used one gets pre-ignition
&gt; knock and higher octane gasoline would be required.

&gt; &gt; Ok Larry I got it the Bentley book does illustrate on page 28.44 the U
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; notch is tdc for cylinder #1.Then they refer to the v as the timing
&gt; &gt; notch.This is what I more or less had surmised.
&gt; &gt;         So in my mind it is now very clear with the v notched aligned
&gt; &gt; with the
&gt; &gt; split in the case we have the correct or 5 degree btdc Bentley is
&gt; &gt; after.Most responses on the list seem to feel adjusting  for about 10
&gt; &gt; degrees btdc works best.I will set mine per Bentley,v at the split
&gt; &gt; and see
&gt; &gt; how it drives.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I have some confusion regarding the timing notches on the flywheel:
&gt; &gt; &gt; -------------^---------F
&gt; &gt; &gt; -----u-----------------R
&gt; &gt; &gt; When setting the timing (Temp Sender II disconnected, revs at 2000
&gt; &gt; rpm)
&gt; &gt; &gt; which notch gives the required 5 degree ahead of TDC? In other words
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; which notch is which if either?
