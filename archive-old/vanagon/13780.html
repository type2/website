   Ain't that the truth!  
   1)  When did you see the last VW commercial/advertisement?  A long time
   ago.  
   I wonder if the words &quot;precipitous decline in U.S. sales&quot; means anything
   to the
   highly trained and educated VWoA marketing staff?  
 
Actually in our area (Salt Lake City), there has been quite a few ads on the
television.  One brags about their 100% sales increase.

I believe the new Jetta III and Golf are really catching on.  As well as the
good looks of the new Cabriolet.  I see quite a few of the new models around
now.
  
   2)  Not that I like commercials so much, but what new cars/engine 
   variations do they offer?   For instance, the Turbo-diesel.  I called 
   VWoA and asked if they were ever going to offer another to the U.S. 
   market.  They said &quot;yes,&quot; in the Golf, Jetta, and Van in Fall '95.
   
I think this demonstrates that they are indeed trying to get in touch with
the US market again.
