Subject: '88 Rear brakes &amp; Shocks

Just tried to check the archives for info on doing front shocks &amp; 
rear brakes on our new '88 Westy, but I couldn't get to them. I could 
only find the recent message list. Is there a new address for the 
archives?

I was wondering on the difficulty level on these two jobs - The front 
end dips &amp; doodles quite a bit, so I was going to try some Cajun Tire 
gas shocks (Monroe, $37) since the next ones are KYB for $75. How 
tough is this job? Are the KYBs worth 2x as much?

Also, the rear brakes sound like they're worn (low grinding noises, 
especially backing down my steep driveway) - Is this job about the 
same as drums on a Jetta/Golf, or are there any pitfalls to watch out 
for?

TIA.

Shawn.
