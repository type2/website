The manual sez the 76 westy is 6' 8&quot; in height, and mine is pretty darn 
close to that.  I can juuuust fit mine into my underground garage... with 
about 1/16th of an inch clearance.  (Love to freak out my landlord by 
barrelling into the garage full tilt and watch his face as the daylight 
disappears above my camper!)
 
   yee-ha!!! sounds like something to scare my wife with...
