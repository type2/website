Rusty writes:
Due to scheduling problems with the new management at Deer Creek Winery and
for the convenience of &quot;everybody&quot; (politically correct cop out) and the
encouragement of a larger showing of VW lovers, the SOTO show will be held
within yelling distance of the VW Classic meet to be held on Sunday 6/11. If
Rusty VanBondo and his wife &quot;Cherry&quot; can drive across the desert from the
Planet Arizona, then you can bring the family, your girlfriend, boyfriend,
S.O., dog, tatoo and stuff 'em all into your VW and come have fun too!
