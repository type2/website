Subject: Re:  Don Lancaster's Intermittents

Where is this box anyway?
 
 &gt;&gt; There's also the rumored 3rd fix for this problem (aka The Don Lancaster
 &gt;&gt; Solution), which is resoldering some steel-leaded (!) resistor or another in
 &gt;&gt; the ECU.  Hey Gerry - is that Electronics Now article describing the fix (Feb
 &gt;&gt; '95?) ever going to make it into the archive?  I *have* heard from Vanagon
