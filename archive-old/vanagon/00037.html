&gt; 
&gt; Hi, Gang
&gt; 
&gt; A friend gave me an original owner's manual from a circa 1965 bus we
&gt; used to go surfing in.  Although there is no definitive model year declaration
&gt; inside, the copyright note says 1964, and all the pics look 1965 to me.
&gt; 
&gt; It is in pretty good shape, though there is a big blob of hardened resin or
&gt; epoxy on the cover.   That figures, given its heritage.
&gt; 
&gt; Free to good home, ie, the first 1965 bus owner interested in it!
