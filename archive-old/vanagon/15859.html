In essence this is the same as the mechanic told me  when we went for our smog
tests (Fred's Garage in Redwood).
The air mixture screw has little effect on leaness and hence pollution
because the O2 sensor will always compensate. He demonstrated this by
adjsuting the mixture and getting the same results. More surprising is
that your idle is not easily adjusted. Does yours have an egr? If so, this
could also be at fault since it could be easily pumping in more exhaust
than necessary. The other item to check/replace is the O2 sensor - your
idle will improve and outputs will be better. DC
