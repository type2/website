Subject: Buses by the Barns-KC Kombis

Hi All,

The Kansas City NEATO Chapter is having a 'Buses by the Barns' get
together this Sunday.  The barns are inbetween Lawrence, KS and Topeka and
belong to a fellow member who has collected many dozen Buses.  We will
have a picnic lunch, hay rides, and fishin at his private bass lake.  Oh
yeah, general 'bull' sessions will most likely fill the Fall air.
We're caravaning from Lenexa, Kansas (KC burb).  All Bus-loving folks are
welcome.  Sorry for the short notice.

email me before 5pm CST or else try Pinkney Newell: PinkNewell_at_aol_dot_com
