FWIW,

I am STILL trying to sell the same van, also well maintained but a
little worn for $1400, not to knock the other, it is probably a bit
cleaner, hell buy em both and have all the spares in the world.

Mine, new heads (30k ago), new P/S rack, new coolant and P/S pipes,
new front rotors bearings pads, used southern gas tank, tranny just a
tad rough cold, seam rust, wood rear bumper, but a nice solid
dependable running van. 96.5k miles now (notice how this goes up 1k
miles every couple weeks, this is a good running van folks, I'd peg
it at good to 150k without problems or excellent for parts)

Too many cars, this one saddens me, get it out of my life.
