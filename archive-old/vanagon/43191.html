The sexuality issue was probably overstated and was not tied directly into
the paragraph about Volkswagens. I read kinda quickly as I was skimming for
the OBVW content and smashed into the following excerpt.

&quot;The convertible has a special significance for most people. Not only is it
a sex symbol, but it signifies freedom, lack of restraint, and a &quot;fun&quot;
attitude towards life.  A woman patient who was depressed and felt inhibited
and unloved by her family bought a convertible because it gave her the feeling
of freedom she needed.   To others the convertible can be an expression of
Bi-Sexuality. In envy of women men may wish to have an opening of their own.
The convertible satisfies that unconscious wish.  A patient who was envious
of his pregnant wife and her ability to have a baby bought himself a convert-
ible--it satisfied his desire to have an opening from which a person could
emerge.&quot;


Now, I drive a 21 window with a big sunroof, have a rabbit vert, and play
on the weekends in the woods with my &quot;topless&quot; landcruiser. What does the
above paragraph tell you about my &quot;lifestyle&quot;  ;-&gt;
