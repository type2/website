Hi Bob,

&gt; What gas heater related components are under the dash?  The reason I ask

It sounds like either the combustion motor or auxiliary fan is about to 
eat it's bearings.  The sound would appear to come from underdash since 
the sound of either motor would get piped through the duct work.  Both 
fans continue to run through the cool down cycle.  Next time you hear the 
sound go and lift the rear seat.  If you don't hear the sound there then 
sidle under the driver's side of the van.  If you hear the sound there 
then it's the combustion motor fan.  Drop the belly pan and you'll see 
the motor at the front left corner of the heater, easily identified by 
the long plastic pipe running to the motor from the rear of the van.  A 
screwdriver is all it takes to remove the clamp that holds the motor to 
the heater.  

These units are not user serviceable.  Once you've got it IDed and out, 
try turning the fan by hand.  If the bearings are shot, you'll know it 
right away.  Ark Mirvis of NJ offers rebuilt ones in the $200 range.  Tom 
Johnson may have a spare he can sell you.
