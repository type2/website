Subject: VWs in Shakespeare!


VWs and Shakespeare????? Yep, one of the local wineries, Westport River 
Winery, has been putting on Shakespeare plays on its grounds for the past 
couple of years. This year, VW bugs and busses are going to be central 
characters....and I thought VWs only came into existance in the mid-30s..


According to the local weekly: &quot;This summer, the Westport Theatre Company is 
staging &quot;A Midsummer Night's Dream&quot; transported to a 60's mood and place.

Its a place of magical 12 foot flowers, psychedelic colors, VOLKSWAGEN BUGS 
AND BUSSES (my emphasis...), and music to touch the soul........&quot;

The play runs from July 11-13 &amp; 18,19 at the winery located in Westport,MA.

Got my tickets for the 13th.....anyone in the area thinking of going? Maybe 
we can have a VW caravan.
