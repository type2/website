Subject: RE: Temp. gage


&gt;I have FINALLY got out and bought me a cylinder head temperature
&gt;gage... installed it... and am enjoying watching the needle of the
&gt;gage (by VDO) go up.

I once tried to put one of these in a '69 bus. It came with a small
instruction sheet that said &quot;Sensor fits under 14mm spark plug&quot;.

One leetle problem... all upright VW engines I've ever seen, use the
W8AC plug or something similar, which is a lot bigger than 14 mm.
There was no way that that sender, the plug, and my spark plug wrench
would all fit into the same space in the cooling fins, all at once.
Believe me, I tried, for endless hours.

Does anyone know what 14mm plug they refer to??? Maybe something
the size of a 1975 Ford plug, but internally like the W8AC?

Where does your CHT sensor fit?

 &quot;Lord, give me serenity to accept what I cannot change, the strength to
 change that which I can, and the the firepower to make the difference.&quot;
