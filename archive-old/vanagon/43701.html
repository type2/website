Subject: Type 2 Engine Mount

        I assume this subject has come up before, but I just discovered this
mailing list and couldn't find the FAQ.  I have just recently become the
co-owner of a 71 Westfalia Bus.  The engine is in good condition but one of
the bolts from the rear engine mount on the drivers side has broken out,
taking a small chunk of the block with it.  Talking with the local mechanic
I was told there is a kit you can buy to mount the engine from the four
bolts on  the oil pump.  Does anyone know what this kit is called, and where
it might be available?  Any help would be appreciated.

Thanks in advance.
