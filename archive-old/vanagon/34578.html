&gt;&gt;Today I was looking at my bus (1974, non-FI) and noticed some weird 
&gt;&gt;things in the airscoops.  There seems to be some metal tubing that comes 
&gt;&gt;up out of the engine, bends and heads back down into the engine 
&gt;&gt;compartment.  This tubing is about 1/4&quot; in diameter, and at the top there 
&gt;&gt;is a section that is about 1&quot; in diameter and about 6&quot; long.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Any ideas what this is?
&gt;
&gt;Yes I do.  These tubes are part of the fuel Vapor revory system.  They conect
&gt;from the top of the Gas Tank and lead back to the Carbon Canister at the top
&gt;of your engine compartment.

Oh?  Here I always thought it was a mechanical cattail.  You know,
seed pod.  I envisioned it working something like a cross between a
dandelion and a pine cone.  In the event of an engine bay fire, those
things burst open, and millions of little parachuted bus seeds spew
forth from the air vents, properly scarified by the combustion of the
gasoline vapor (aided by the direct connection to the top of the gas
tank).  Hopefully, one of these seeds floats on the air currents until
it falls into a suitable iron smelting furnace, whereby the process of
VW bus life begins anew. :-) :-) :-)

Oops, not /friday yet...
