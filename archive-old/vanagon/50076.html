Subject: VW SHOPS in Toronto

Hayman Motors up at Finch &amp; Dufferin at416-636-6789

or Lorne Park Car Centre in the West end at Lakeshore &amp; Royal Windsor
905-823-8787

are a couple of VW shops with expertise in the Toronto area.

Anybody else know of a place or person who might do good work for low prices?
