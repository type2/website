&gt; &gt; Also, if you have any trouble accessing these files, let me know.
&gt; 
&gt; So how do you access this stuff.  I guess I missed or deleted the
&gt; post on how to use gopher.  Maybe I mixed it up with porqupines
&gt; and skunks, I dunno.  ;)

&gt; &gt; Enjoy!

For the time being, don't ask.  If you know how to use gopher and want to 
see what state of disarray the gopher is in today, go ahead and connect, 
but if you don't know how to use gopher, I'm not going to tell you much 
until I get it working right, and it ain't working right now.  I'll post 
something, but I'll have to wait until after Friday ...  &lt;grin&gt;
