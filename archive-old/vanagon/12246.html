Subject: Vanagon Sheetmetal

This is my first letter to this group. I have been lurking in the shadows 
for a few days and feel it is time to join in. I own a 1984 Sunroof Vanagon
that I converted the interior from a 1985 Wolfsburg Weekender.  It has only 
84,000 miles on it and i love it. 
My question is, up until this past winter the body was perfect. I got sideswiped
and need to know if anybody knows of a source for body panels for Vanagons.
Also, Has anybody experimented with alternative engines in their 
Vanagons(perhaps  a VR6)... just curious.
Thanks.
