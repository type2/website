The low beams on my 87 Westfalia are really terrible and I've decided that 
my next upgrade project will be to add relays and rewire for higher wattage 
bulbs. Have any of you done this? If so, were you satisfied with the 
results? Should I run the new 12V wire directly from the alternator or from 
the battery?
