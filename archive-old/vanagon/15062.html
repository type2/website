All this talk about cracked heads and leaking head gaskets is starting to get
me worried.  I may buy an '82 Westy with 81k (never had a rebuild).  How long
can I reasonably expect it to last without needing a major rebuild, i.e., 
what's the typical trouble-free lifespan for an aircooled Vanagon engine?
