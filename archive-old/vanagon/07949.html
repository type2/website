Subject: Resgistering A Salvage Car

Howdy,

	Some people asked me before how you would register a car that has
already gone to the junkyard.  I was at DMV again yesterday trying to get
my bus registered, and picked up a little info sheet.

	You need:

	Application for registration, filled out by all listed owners 

	Junk recipt previously issued by DMV
-OR-
	Bill of sale from the dismantler
	
	Bill of sale from each seller, if it was sold since the time it
was reported junked

	Vehicle verification (don't know what that is)

	Brake and light certificate

	Smog certificate

	weight certificate (for trucks)

	And then you pay a bunch of fees.

	So this _is_ possible and legal.
