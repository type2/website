So Brad Hopp says:
&gt; 
&gt; 	Well, they went straight to the starter system with a voltmeter.  
&gt; After finding everything checked out, one of the guys asked me how much 
&gt; gas I have.  Given the mood I was in, and my typically smart mouthed 
&gt; attitude I said &quot;None, it's diesel and there is a quarter of a tank. 
&gt; Hmmmph.&quot;  We went over to verify this fact.  The needle was just barely 
&gt; on the red portion, and of course the tank was as dry as the Sahara.  
&gt; What I got then was a humiliating lesson on how to read a gas gauge.
&gt; 
&gt; BTW  when ever it gets below 1/2 tank, it becomes very unreliable, as it 
&gt; will &quot;float&quot; from empty to half full with the slightest bump/incline.    
&gt; 

Great story Brad.  Takes guts just to tell a story like that.  I'm sure
we've all been there but don't want to discuss it.  

As far is keeping track of gas.  I just reset the trip meter and depending
on the type of driving I'm doing, I can pretty much estimate when I need
to get gas.  Typically, I don't go more than 230 miles.  I like to fill
it when it's about 1/4 tank.  I think we've had a discussion before about
how many miles one has gone before that stalling sensation started.

Cheers!
