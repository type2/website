Subject: a &quot;splitty&quot; paint question (sorta long)

this is a question i have been intending to post for a while, bear with
me..........

I would like to repaint my 65' Westy (model 231) to its' *original* colour.
Trouble is the dreaded PO removed the sticker behinfd the pass. seat that
indicates what the orig. colour is/was. MY question is..........

what information does the metal tag that is rivited behind the front
passenger seat provide? does it tell you what colour the bus originally
was?? What do all those numbers mean?? I know the bus was originally white,
but what type of white is the question (pearl white, lotus white, cloud
white, blue white etc??)

colour photocopied colour chips aren't much use as &quot;white&quot; colour chips
don't reproduce too well on a white background :(

FWIW the bus has been repainted an incorrect quasi beige colour

Also when I worte to the VW museum in germany for orig. paint colour they
wrote back with something like 15,32,45. What do these numbers mean?? They
sure aren't an &quot;L&quot; code.

Are there any other info tags on the bus that I am unaware of that would
specify the original colour of the bus?

One final question, do people know if a 65' westy would have come with a
two toned paint job??? my friend's 66' did but is that correct for 65'??
