Subject: Tires AGAIN!

My wife took the Vanagon in to get a pair of tires.  I went through the 
regular warnings like &quot;you know they never have the high pressure radials in 
stock so make them show you the pressure rating&quot;.  Both my wife and the tire 
store went through this drill 2 years ago, but...

As usual when she got home the tires only had a 40 psia pressure rating.  
These are Michelin XZX 185R14.  The 55 psia tires they replaced were 
Michelin XZX 185R14 *C*.  I have been very happy with the &quot;C&quot; tires but my 
experience with any lower pressure tire on the rear of the vehicle inflated 
below 45 psia is that it sways and is more unstable than usual at highway 
speed.  The ply ratings are identical on the tires.  The load rating on the 
&quot;C's&quot; is 1710 lb. on the &quot;non-C's&quot; its around 1500 lb.

The store will replace them when they get the others in (Evans Tire at 
Alderwood for Seattlites) and gave us no hassle.  Any recommendations?
