&gt; Any way
&gt; you go will be an improvement, it will be hard to overdrive any of these
&gt; lights in a Vanagon, but I note also for the ultimate in lighting, a
&gt; friend has a set of the Hella &quot;aux low beam&quot; driving lights, instead of
&gt; being a normal long range driving light or even a low low fog light
&gt; pattern these double or triple your low beam lighting area.
&gt; Unfortunately go about $120 a set I believe.

I have the Hella aux low beams on my 86. I added them because the reflective
film of the square headlights was pitted. I felt this pitting was 
compromising the light output and the aux low beams are less expensive than
new headlights.

The aux low beams work great, I highly recommend them.
