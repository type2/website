Hi Erik and list,

Yep! I'll be there!! I'll be arriving Saturday late afternoon/early evening
and will be leaving Monday morning. I'll be in my white '71 Rustfalia
assuming all goes well with the new carb install. Been *REAL* busy and
haven't got around to it yet :-(  If not, I'll be in my wife's blue '86
weekender. But the '71 will have to be pretty darn bad before I show up to
a GASS show in a waterboxer ;-&gt; Just kidding, really!

I'd love to get a list camp sight together! Ted Finesman (tedebare_at_aol_dot_com)
will there in his white/tan '75 standard on Friday. I'm sure I could get
him to save some spots for us.

It's a good possibility that some of the Marshwiggles will be there with me
too. So if any other musicians are going to be there, maybe we could have a
campfire jam? Todd Swangstu of CampBox News *promised* me to show up with a
guitar. He's a great guitar player! Look for my '71 Rustfalia and Ted's
nice white/tan '75 with &quot;Tri-Transporter&quot; signs. Also, look for an upright
bass with &quot;American Gothic&quot; painted on the back, that'll be me!

the
&gt; G.A.S.S. show in Columbania, Oh next weekend. I've compiled a list of
who's
&gt; going to be there and when, that I know of, it's listed below. First, the
&gt; listing of show info from the G.A.S.S. site....
&gt;

&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; Erik O (87 Syncro Westy) Sunday
&gt; Eric Z (86 Syncro) Sunday
&gt; Neil O (74 Westy) Saturday  [I'm trying to get him to change days]
&gt; Mike M (70's Westy) Sunday
&gt; Mark K (91 Carrat) Sunday  [you gota see this van, it's the salvage
rebuild
&gt;               
&gt;                             from Flordia talked about on the list lately]
&gt; Tony M &amp; friends  ?????
&gt; Susan S (88' Westy) Sunday
&gt; 
&gt; That's all I know of right now. If you're in the area let someone know
and
&gt; stop by. The N.E. Ohio area is not that big on VW vans, so this is one of
&gt; the few important events of the year for us. Tony M mentioned something
&gt; about getting a little section together at the show for listmembers.
