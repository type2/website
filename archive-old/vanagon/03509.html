&gt; I checked the FAQ's and other related info on the gopher and could not
&gt; come up with a corresponding number to the plugs that I just installed.
&gt; They are Bosch Super W7CC (no 0 241 235  574). The FAQ does not list a
&gt; W7CC for air cooled Vanagons but does list a W6CC for them and a W7CC0
&gt; for water cooled. Since I asked for a cooler plug I'm wondering if the
&gt; guy sold me the wrong kind. They look identical to the previously
&gt; installed NGK B5E S. Anybody know of the Bosch W7CC plugs and wether a
&gt; cooler plug helps?  Thanks in advance  -- DC

I have an '81 Vanagon, and use Bosch Super W8CC.  I just asked for
plugs at the local VW shop, and this is what they gave me.
