&gt;&lt;&lt; My wife was coming home from a long trip, when she started to have
&gt;problems
&gt; getting the van into gear.  I found that with the clutch pedal to the floor
&gt; it would grind into reverse.  With the clutch pedal to the floor you could
&gt; shift into 1st-4th, but it would grap within the first inch of pedal
&gt; movement.  The fellow who works on my van has looked at this problem before
&gt; and said the &quot;shift guides&quot; are worn.  The problem went away, but now is
&gt; back.  Any help would be appreciated. Van has 140K on it.
&gt;  &gt;&gt;
&gt;Sounds like the clutch is not releasing.  Could be a hydraulic or pressure
&gt;plate problem.

I think it still might be a linkage adjustment problem...  Having gone
through this problem three times now in the last six months.  I think the
only reason that I have had the problem more than once is that I was afraid
to adjust the linkage far enough, each time only moving the linkage
adjustment just far enough to get the van to shift from 1st to 2nd without
binding.

Last weekend, I had to adjust it again.  I wasn't looking forward to two
hours of trial and error, and frankly I was just fed up with it.  I moved
the linkage A LOT this time (at the union directly behind the gas tank).
The change was amazing--for the first time I have a very clearly defined &quot;H&quot;
pattern, I don't have to depress the shift lever to get it into 1st (risking
putting it into reverse).  It also goes into reverse with minimal effort.
This time, the adjustment process took 15 minutes.  It shifts like a new car
now for the first time since I bought it 2 years ago.  I cleaned up the
linkage at the transaxle with some mineral spirits and regreased, this
helped even more.  All my boots have deteriorated and I'll have to face that
issue when I get the courage to dismantle the connection at the tranny.

But first, I have to replace the rear heater valve, put in new coolant for
the winter and rehose my fuel system before I catch fire (Joel has warned!)
