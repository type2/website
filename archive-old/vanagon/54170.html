Subject: vanagon problem

Something sent to me, but more technical folks than I may be able to
help these folks:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Dear Mr coyote,
I am the owner of a 1988 vanagon of which I just recently purchased and 
am currently taking my first extended roadtrip in.  100 miles from 
Seattle I encountered a shuddering problem much like a clogged fuel 
filter.  I took the van to a VW dealer in Yakima, WA only to find out 
that the problem was a badly designed bosch airbox wiring harness that 
according to the service manager was loading up with voltage and causing 
the brain to believe it was deaccelerating when in fact I was not this 
blurb in the brain was apparently a problem that many VW dealers had a 
hard time convincing Germany of, (according to the service manager in 
Fort Collins, CO they would either not believe it was happening or just 
would not admit it).  
Anyhow, I am now in New Mexico at a freinds and I found your web page 
and thought maybe you had heard of this problem, (the new wiring harness 
cost $150.00 installed and after 1800 miles of problem free driving with 
it, the problem returned 100 miles from my destination of Las Cruces, NM 
 though to a greatly reduced extent)  This problem sounds like it should 
have been recall material and it really pisses me off!!  If you have any 
ideas or know of anyone who can help me my e-mail address in Seattle is 
globalig_at_nwlink_dot_com  -   Thanks in advance!! and happy volkswagoning.
