Subject: Camper tables

Has anyone had all of the paint flake off of the table bars where they are
clamped
by the bear down knob?  This has happende to both the front and rear tables
in my '88 westy. and the flaking paint seems to be traveling up the pole.

Has anyone tried power coating these items to prevent the paint flaking off?
