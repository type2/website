&gt;&gt;&gt; tinny tim. :)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;wasn't *tinny* tim Tom Terrific's younger brother?  or maybe that was
&gt;&gt;a different Emily Dickens novel.
&gt;
&gt;no, no ... Tinny Tim is the real name of The Tin Man, from the Whizzer
&gt;of Ahs (also known by humans across the world as The Pause that Refreshes).

(or was it Paul Rubens - &quot;The Paws that Refreshes&quot;)

I thought Tinny Tim was Rusty VanBondo's cousin, son (and carbon copy) of
Ferrous Bueller, who 
was married to the late pop star Selenium. I also heard that Ferrous was
behind on his 
antimony payments.  They got divorced after it was know that he'd spent some
&quot;quality time&quot; 
with Freddy Mercury.  She couldn't belive he had the gallium to cheat on her
like that.  Its rumored the
divorce was one of the drawn out argonizing affairs, but I'm too noble to
meddle in such affairs.

Isn't it kinda ionic how these family trees happen?  Guess I couldn't miss this 
golden to opportunity to bring this up.  

Anyone here old enuf to rember Tom Lehrer? Kip O'Data?
