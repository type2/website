Ha Ha, Yes, That's all true! I saw a report in the Finish TV late November
last year. I don't understand a word but the pictures are looking strange
like a bad criminal story. I couldn't believe that this is true, but it
is. Oh, the Finn's have to deal with a lot of cars stolen in Europe and
passing Finland on their way to Russia.
