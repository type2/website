Subject: Workshop manual advice wanted

I live in the UK, my van is 1989 1.9L watercooled Transporter,
twin carbs.

I'm after a good workshop manual for this van.  Is there a Haynes
manual?  Is it any good (I've had some bad experiences with
Haynes Lies)?  Is there a US manual which covers this model?  Are
there any VW workshop manuals available? Are THEY any good?

Thanks

JP Nicholls
