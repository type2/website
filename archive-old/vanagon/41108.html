Would those with info make the posts to the list in general as any v-gon 
owners would like to have shopping options.

thanks,

| Volks,
|
| After being in the list for sometime, I have found plenty of parts stores
|for the pre-80 vans, busses, etc. But, what I haven't seen are sources of
|parts for the Vanagons except for, of course, VW dealerships and their
|outrageous prices.
|
| Besides West Coast Metrics, which sells some parts, where do you
|Vanagonites buy parts (Vanagons and Vanagon Westfalias)? Send e-mail direct
|to me if you will. I highly appreciate the information.
|
| Thanks!
