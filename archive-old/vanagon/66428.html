&gt; Hey folks,
&gt;
&gt; I have what may turnout to be a simple question. But before I go tearing
&gt; things apart I thought I bounce the question of ya'll! When using our
&gt; fridge on the last couple of road trips I noticed that the weakest of the
&gt; power sources was the propane. In fact, last weekend it did not even seem
&gt; to work at all on propane.
&gt;  The fridge warmed right up to room temp.
&gt; I thought maybe I was out of propane, but the stove seems to work just
&gt; fine, thus propane!

You didn't specificly say, but it sounds like you didn't check if the
burner was lit.  Check the diode, and also feel the vent cap (sould be
warm).
