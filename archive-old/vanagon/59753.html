Subject: Vanaru / Subagon XT6...

I have located a Subaru XT6 in a junkyard w/ a good engine, and the price is
reasonable.  Has anyone else attempted this swap to a flat 6??
this seems like the only economically feasable way to put a waterboxer 6 into
the Vanagon, as finding a wrecked Porsche Boxter in the local junkyard ain't
gonna happen any time soon.. It seems as if a Subaru waterboxer 6 engine
would fit with the least amount of modification to the engine compartment.

anyone done this??
