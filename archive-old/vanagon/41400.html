Okay, here's my suggestion. All you bicyclists, get yonselves one of them 
whoa cool listserve stickers and find an appropiate place (listserv 
approved... oh no, not this thread again...) and I promise not to honk at 
you if I see the sticker in the designated area. On the other hand, if 
recognition is up your alley, we'll find another spot to mount the 
sticker and in that case I'll make it a point to honk for you when you 
fly past my old van on your two-wheeled self-powered wonder.
