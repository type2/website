&gt;EATEN THROUGH!!
&gt;	This is where it gets wierd... Supposedly there is a problem in
&gt;Germany (that is nearing epidemic proportions) with a small rodent-like
&gt;creature, called something like a &quot;mardar&quot;, I think, which just LOVES to
&gt;eat rubber hoses!  Supposedly they can smell the hot rubber smell eminating

i don't have any trouble believing this: my sister's Voyager and Caravan i
know of were both 'attacked' by squirrels and/or chipmonks ... apparently
chrysler's brand of engine wiring smells attractive to them!! and the dealer
couldn't ever get my sister's quite right again ... so she traded for a
new one. :)
