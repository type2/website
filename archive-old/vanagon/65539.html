Subject:      1980 Vanagon Owners Manual

Howdy all,

I have a 1980 owners manual for a vangon, non westy.  It is in pretty
OK shape, came from one I stripped last fall.  FREE to the first person
who responds to me.  I will ship it free to keep my Karma points high.
I will be out today at noon through next week so don't expect to hear
back until next weekend but I will.

Looks like I'll miss the Jerome JAmboree as I couldn't get an
appointment to have the CO adjusted until 9/22 and I don't want to drive
it and risk running too lean and cookin the engine.  (It got messed with
during the lastest non running episode)

Anyone have a mixture adjustment process that doesn't use the exhaust
emission sensor?  I tried doing it with the rpms but that did not seem
very reliable.  The idle also got moved.

Take care,
KW
82 westy
