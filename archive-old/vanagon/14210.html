Hello,

A comment on Cetin's (cs_at_sypro_dot_com) comment 3 on David Kao's solution:

I think that this is a good solution and agree that the switching speed 
should be high compared to the wiper systems natural inertia.  Anything over 
10 Hz should be fine.  However, I disagree with using a large capacitor 
since that will cause very high switching currents for the power transistor. 
 The voltage is actually not the issue.  Maintaining an average current 
equal to the current of the motor when run on 6V is the real issue.

I looked back through my old messages, and I unfortunately couldn't find 
David's circuit.  (Must have had a different subject.)  If he didn't have a 
heavy diode across the motor or power transistor (reverse direction), the 
circuit needs one.  This diode provides a current path for the motor while 
the transistor is switched off.  Without it, very high voltages are possible 
which may kill the power transistor.

My last comment is that there is some possibility the switching circuit 
could cause radio noise.  If this is the case, a small capacitor could be 
placed across the power transistor to slow its switching time.  Since this 
would heat the transistor a bit, the better solution would be a ferrite 
doughnut on either the power lead, or the motor lead to absorb the radio 
energy.
