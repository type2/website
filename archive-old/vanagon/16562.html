Subject: westie rear seat transplant?

This should *not* be an easy job.  The dimensions of the type II and the
Vanagon are different by about 2 inches.  You're better off taking off
the middle seat and sleeping on the floor (I used to put my feet in between
the two fron seats when we had the 73 buses) on long trips.

I'd say hold out until you can find a weekender that is junked somewhere.
The weekender's rear bed is *very* comfortable, since it is much wider
than that of the Westy's.

 &gt; I've got an option on a used rear seat/bed assembly from a late 70s bus,
 &gt; but dunno if it'll smoothly go in the back of my '83 vanagon.
