Subject:      seeping from core flange

After having the VW dealer pressure check my cooling system, a leak was
found in the rear heater core.  The rear heater valve was reported to be
leak free.  I then had the core replaced with original VW unit along with
new o-ring, a slight seep (about 1 drip per 5 minutes) is leaking out of the
flange that connects the core intake to the valve assembly.  It is fastened
with 2 hexhead screws.  Should I march it back to the service center or try
to tighten the screws another 1/4 turn.  If the verdict is to tighten, how
much force should I apply?

Thanks
