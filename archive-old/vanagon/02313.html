Subject: Rear speaker mounts
Date: Tue, 26 Jul 1994 21:48:53 -0600 (CDT)


My 1984 Vanagon GL had rear speakers at one time.  I still have them, but
all the bus still has are dangling wires.  The small black thermoplastic
mounts that screw to the inside of the roof with two screws apiece are
both broken.  I've tried to buy more from my local dealer, but their
searches of microfiche and shelves add up to zilch.  They sold me a
speaker mount for a newer bus to try, but it doesn't even come close.  I
even read them the part number molded into the part, but they couldn't do
anything with it.  Does anyone have a source for these things?  I don't
really want to get them from the junkyard, because the same aging process
that apparently got both of mine would likely have been at work there,
too.

Thanks for any suggestions.
