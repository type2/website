Subject: Fiche to Paper
Date: Fri, 20 Jan 95 9:33:03 PST

A local business will copy the microfiche for my 89 syncro westy to paper for
$75.  A bit steep but if folks were interested in 86 on exploded view paper
single sided copies at say $15US each then five of us could ... well the rest
is obvious.

If I get 100 replies then the price will be adjusted accordingly.

If I don't get three replies then I'll keep squintin'.

I disremember how many pages there are but I suspect a copy charge of 0.03 per
page is SWAG for duplicating.

Reply email so I can keep track.

The fiche is 000.7360.19.21 VWPN  1-1991 dated.

alf ( old eyes, recent westy)
