if you live in the land of the endless sun and the rust free buses you pay
in cracked rubber you can find nice rubber on rusty buses in the rain belt

schizo ellis sez:
Send them to VanBondo!!!!!!
contact &quot;us&quot; at:
jim_at_1dc_dot_com or 
vanbondo_at_primenet_dot_com

VW Donations gladly accepted. I'll even refrain from saying nasty things
about the folks that send the grey window rubber, grey mats for the front
seat and will be especially nice if you send a grey plastic moulding for the
poptop cutout  in the headliner that is in less than five zillion pieces or
real tight OEM left Safari latches. 

Endless sun = dry rubber, Rainy climate/salt = rust.  What's the answer?
Montana or Northern NM? Hmmm...
BTW: Unrestored rust free &quot;totally devoid of rust&quot; buses in AZ are 90% a
thing of the imagination.
