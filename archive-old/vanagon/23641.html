&gt;Just talked to a mechanic acquaintence of mine who told me a story about a
&gt;recent deal. He said that he and his venture capitalist partner spotted a
&gt;local ad for a 1992 VW Bus, bad motor, must sell, $900. Call xxx-xxxx.
&gt;This is either B.S. or a true Bus Story (B.S.) Although the acquaintence is
&gt;a definite salesman who could sell water to a drowning man, the source of
&gt;the story isn't inclined to exaggerate to me about stuff like this. He said
&gt;that he had never run across a deal like that before.

well ... True Story Time: :)
one day at work, back in about 1979, the manager of the Customer Engineers
comes in, all pissed off at the world. seems that he had seen an ad in the
paper the previous day, and thought it was a joke:
&quot;Mercedes-Benz, 4-door, like new, $100.&quot; yeah, right. well, that's what he
thought, too. so he ignored it.

he gets home the previous evening and sees the teenage kid next door washing
and waxing a big Mercedes. so he walks over, and asks if the kid's dad got a
new car. &quot;nope. this is mine!&quot;, says the kid. big smile. BIG smile. seems the
kid was too stupid to know a joke when he saw one, so he called the phone
number in the ad, went to see the car, and bought a 500E for $100. that's
ONE HUNDRED dollars, folks. actually, he had to get his dad to sign the
papers, cause the kid was not old enough (under alabama law).

it seems that the lady selling it gave this story: her husband had sent her
a telegram, from Bermuda, where he and his secretary were frolicing. the
telegram said he wanted a divorce, and she (wife; seller of Mercedes) should
keep the house, and sell the car and send him half. so she did.

there are TWO morals in this story, if you look hard enough.    :)
