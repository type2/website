&gt;The 86 Westie is at VW having the heads replaced. I've checked my 
&gt;records and can't find if the timing belt was replaced.  I have 
&gt;98,000 mi. what should I do?  Also, the muffler was replaced by VW 
&gt;in 89 is there a lifetime guarantee?  TIA  Sherwin :-{)
&gt;
There is NO timing belt on an 86 Wasserboxer.  It uses a 'Timing Gear' that
id driven driectly from the camshaft and keeps time for the distributer.  The
gear usually will outlast the life of the engine and requires no service.  It
is similar in design to a pinion gear in a standard american car
differential.
