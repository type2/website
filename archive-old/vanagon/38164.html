Subject:       WTB any Crew/double Cab

I am in the market for a restorable pickemup kombi.  Something 
in the south east michigan area would be nice because I have 
basically no means of towing anything.  Price is definately an issue. 
I paid a total of $400 and a bean burito for my last 5 cars. that 
includes the bus.  If I could find something that fits this 
Incredible string of cheep cars it would be wonderfull but I won't 
get my hopes up.  
I am also concidering picking up a standard beetle or a Delorean :-).  
If anyone knows of one of these in the area cheep I may be 
interested.

Thanks for any leads.
Ed
