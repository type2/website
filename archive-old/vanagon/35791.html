i was cutting up a 67 bus last week (oh, the thrill of dustruction).  to
excuse myself i must say it had the wheel wells hacked, all the doors were
bad, it was rusted bad, and dented worse.  The paint was, shall we say,
interesting.   I tried the count the layers like the rings in a tree.   So I
was cutting off the nose and part of the front floor on the left which was
solid, and the right hand dogleg which someone had replaced at one time.   It
is rather complicated to cut the nose off.  I cut through the left side
dogleg, across the bottom of the bit that slopes up to the drivers seat to
the middle of the floor.   Then i cut around the back of the dog leg on the
right side, parallel to it, down to the big rust hole.   i got a hammer and
bent the metal and rust up to expose the frame member, and cut it.   then i
cut along the front of the floor to the heat tube, and just to the rear of
it.  Then i took out the steering gear box with column attached, and the
clutch and brake pedals.   Then cut a straight line from the heat tube back,
just to the left of the reinforcements by the brake lever.   then it had to
be cut across two main frame members, one lesser one, under the car on the
left side, through the heat tube, and then finally across the window pillars.

i came to the realisation that the front floor of a bus actually is pretty
darn sturdy

however, if the collision is a bit above it, or at excessive impact speed,
that may not matter.     Nader said they were unsafe at any speed, and
frankly i think automobiles are extremely destructive and unsafe.   The whole
idea of zipping around at high speeds is nutso.    A friend of mine was in an
accident Thursday when a trailer came loose from a car going the other way,
came into his lane, rolled up his bug's hood, and the tongue of the trailer
hit his head.  :'(   I hope he is going to be ok.   :)     :)

actully the earliest buses didnt have as much frame strength in the front
from what i gather from the parts lists  (50 and 51s, that is, old clunkers)

what i find a pain is that when i keep a safe following distance, people like
to jump in front of me.   once my friend pulled over in his 61 on the freeway
because of a wobbling in the rear, ond this guy pulled over a screeched to a
halt in FRONT of us to tell us the wheel was wobbling.  Duh  swift move there
dummy.
