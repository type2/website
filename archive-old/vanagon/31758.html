So Glen Hadley says:
&gt; 
&gt; The only thing that I see that I would take issue with is that the apark
&gt; plugs should be replaced at every 3000 mi tune-up.  I have always checked
&gt; and cleaned at 3000, replaced at 6000.  I always run Bosch plugs,
&gt; sometimes platinum and sometimes copper-core.  I let platinums run about
&gt; 12000 miles.  I also do not replace condenser, rotor and cap at every
&gt; tune-up.  I typically check and clean at 3000 and 6000, replacing them in
&gt; the 9000 to 12000 range, unless I am having some sort of trouble.

Thanks for your reply Glen.

This seems to be a good point and I will re-state this area as best I 
can.  I was just going off of the standard VW maintenance schedule for
early air-cooleds. 

Thanks,

P.S.  I hope I get more responses from the &quot;Vintage&quot; group as they are
      a larger population of the &quot;Air-Heads&quot;.  ;)
