Subject: Auxillary Heater

I am considering buying an 82 Westy Diesel, but it doesn't have an
auxiallary heater.   In the archives I found an article giving the details
of installing an Eberspacher BA6, but I think it is more than I want to
tackle.  I would like the heat for camping, not for driving, so I would
like to know what other simpler options there are.  In my 92 VW Fanatic
Camper, a propane heater was installed.  It consisted of a furnace and a
small control box.  It appeared that that all that would be needed to do is
connect the propane, add some venting and connect up a few wires for power
and the thermostat.  Would this be a viable option?

Thanks in advance for suggestions.
