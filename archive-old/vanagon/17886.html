&lt;Cetin's story on an E-van purchase deleted&gt;

&gt; I think the dealer sales person was really upset, and even my wife was very
&gt; upset with me, but I still do not think what I did was immmoral.  The trouble
&gt; is, most dealers are probably aware of this method...

Congratulations on what I would call &quot;excellent&quot; car buying negotion 
skills. 

When buying a car, it is much easier to &quot;nice and gentlemanly&quot; when it
comes to negotiating the price. But nice people don't save money on the
purchase. If you stick to your guns, it is possible to get a good deal. 

As far as the salesman being upset, let me ask this question: Is it better
to have an upset salesperson or $1000 in your pocket. Obviously, that is
a non brainer. So the salesman was upset. Big deal. Would he have been 
upset if you were upset because he was able to gouge another $1000 out
of you? I think not.

If car dealers set reasonable markups and everything was up front, then 
the purchase price haggling would not be an issue. Then, neither the 
purchaser nor the salesperson would be upset. But that is a perfect 
world and one we won't see for a while.
