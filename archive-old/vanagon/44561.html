&gt;It's a 77 (78 engine) that recently had new P's &amp; C's, and rebuilt Mark

&gt;those 1000 miles it used about a half quart of 30 weight. I was thinking
&gt;the synthetic might give slightly lower temps. Any answers to that? And it
&gt;would be less likely to break down in the higher temp range?

True on the last statement, supposedly.  I tried synthetic in my engine at
one time, and didn't notice any significant difference in indicated oil
temperature.

&gt;I plan on doing 60 or so to keep the temps down. At what temps should I
&gt;pull over and let it cool?

I would pull over before it hits 250, as an absolute maximum.  Best to slow
down before it gets that hot, though.  I consider 230 a sign that I am
straining the engine.

&gt;P.S.- Oh yeah, on the way back we'll be towing a small 4 x 8 utility
&gt;trailer containing his stuff. Nothing heavy, mainly stereo stuff, TV,
&gt;etc...anything to look out for towing this?  Thanks

Ack.  Just don't floor it.  Keep the temps down and the RPM's up.  Towing a
trailer cross country with a VW bus is a scary proposition (for your
engine, at least). Good luck...
