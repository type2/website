Subject: RE: LSD, the geat hippies, lineage..

&gt;I wonder, though, whether driving a 1990 Vanagon is a way of keeping
&gt;in touch with those roots without appearing odd in terms of society today.

Hell, just bought an '87 to rip up the roots I got and sink a few new ones
{`_~}!

For me, the whole point of gettin' a bus again is that the past (and all
its alterations) need only be as distant as the next time we take to the
road to hit an evening hatch (flyfishers we are) or to catch a show at the
Gorge at George (Washington that is) and blow off busting our hump to get
home in the dark.

This summer, we'll see ya' at Lollapolooza (much better lineup than
Woodstock inc), but next summer it may be Tierra Del Fuego or Homer AK.

(Set a course for adventure, your mind on a new romance...)

Paul
