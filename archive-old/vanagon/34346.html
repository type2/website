Subject: Leaping from the pits of the &quot;Have yet to Post&quot; club

Hello all! I've been a avid air-cooled maniac for about 3 years now and I 
thought I'd take the opportunity to grace you all with a little 
background on my beautiful '69 camper bus.

This gem of mine only set me back a cool $1200.00 last August and is worth 
every penny and more! I purchased it from some lady who was moving out of state 
and needed to unload some goodies to make her trip a little easier. At 
this time I too was in the process of preparing for a move and needed a 
little more room than what my '72 Super Beetle had to offer for luggage 
space (aw, who needs a spare tire anyways, huh?) Since the purchase, the 
van has been virtually trouble free, which boils down to only one simple 
instance 2 weeks after my purchase where the pin that holds the clutch 
cable to the clutch pedal sheered off from I could not begin to guess at 
how many years of use. My baby has carried me through thick and thin, or 
at least through as much of it as I've had to handle in the past 5 
months. 

After the first time I drove my swim coach's '87 Westy around, I knew 
that my little Beetle just wasn't enough for me anymore. Viva la Volkswagen!

On an ending note, I've been looking to rework the interior of my camper 
van and need help in finding places that carry camping package parts? Any 
suggestions out there or do I wait till the next swap meet/show?
