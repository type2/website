Subject: Gratitude and success

Thanks to everyone who responded to my question.  I got many, many
responses, all helpful.  Is this list great or what?  Special thanks to
Arlyn Strano, of Strano Foreign Car, an extremely friendly lady.  (This is
the same Strano Foreign Car listed at the top of Muir's recommended parts
places list).

here's the success story:  For those who don't remember, my 76 was leaking
like a mother, under the driver's side, around the oil filter.  So it turns
out to be the oil pressure sending switch.  $6.50 (expensive, another FLAPS
had it for 3.90, but they were closing before I could get there).  Had to
widen the hole in the cooling air duct a little to get the socket down in
there, but mission accomplished.

To those who suggested a leaking oil cooler:  you were right, but that's
not the majority of the oil.  And I am most grateful yall were wrong :).

Maggie rides another day,
Eric
