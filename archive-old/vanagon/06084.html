Subject:      fuel mileage

FROM: H YATES
Hi there.  I have a '90 Syncro Westfalia with air/ps, etc.  Fuel mileage is
very consistent at 23 mpg (Imperial Miles Per Gallon) no matter what the
conditions.  The air conditioning doesn't seem to effect mileage either.  WE
don't use the van in town so I don't know what our local mileage is.  We have
111000 Km on it now.  Our cruising speed is 100 km/h (62 mph).  I have been
keeping records since the van was new regarding oil and fuel consumption.

Thx.
Harry
