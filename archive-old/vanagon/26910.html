&gt; a little bit courteous??

&gt; in the last 15 years in this town, the rule of thumb has become:
&gt; &quot;when you go through a GREEN light, look both ways first!&quot;

just to add a bit of balance to Joel's lamentations, i was traveling
through Brainerd, MN yesterday, a town of about 16,000 people.  not
big mind you but still a good flow of traffic as it is on a major
state highway.  the power was out for about a 3 mile stretch of the
main thorough-fare through town and all stop lights were dark.  i
was impressed with the way drivers behaved themselves, taking turns
at each stop-light as if it were a posted 4-way stop.  it was 
refreshing 'cause there were no cops, no traffic control, just people 
acting with a little consideration.
