Subject: Pulling Gen on '71 Bus

--SweetPea70_at_aol_dot_com said:--
&gt; Hence, the generator must come out. There is only about 3
&gt; inches of space between the top of the compartment and the fan shrouding to
&gt; lift it and wiggle the gen. out. Would it just be easier to drop the whole
&gt; engine and go from there?? 

I did the generator-pull-without dropping the engine soon after
aquiring my '71, before I was a savvy as I am now {grin}.
It is definatly doable...the hardest part is getting those
two screws out of the sides of the shroud [behind the manifolds].
Nowdays, with my experience of dropping engines, I'd probably go
that route, but since you don't have the luxury of time, if I 
were you, I'd try the engine-in-bus trip first. If you can't get 
the shroud up, its fairly easy to put it back where it was
and get professional help....much easier than getting the engine
back in without enough help or tools...just my 0.02 worth.
