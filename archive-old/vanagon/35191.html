Subject: re EV Confusing Manual, Help

&gt;I would like to thank the list for lots of good information. I
&gt;just bought a new '95 EV Camper. As a result of having gone back
&gt;and read all the archived list messages, I feel I've made a much
&gt;more informed purchase.

Hey great! Welcome to the fold. Using this thing, you realize how much
larger inside it really is!

Now the bad news: one thing you might check is the weld joints at both the
top of the A pillar (windshield) and the bottom of the B pillar (behind the
front door). They sometimes have minor cracks in the paint which VW will
repair for free. (All EVs I've looked at have a crack in at least one of
these places.)

Also, if you have any money left, check out the Sidewinder II awnings they
sell for it. Seems to be one of the few awnings still available for it.
Pretty nice.

&gt;The result is a manual that's difficult to use. The climate control
&gt;section is a good example. The pictures show controls that don't
&gt;match the ones that are on my vehicle, and the text refers to controls
&gt;A,B,C,D which leads the reader to flip constantly back to the picture
&gt;and try to figure out the equivalent controls on the vehicle.

Yeah, I know about the manual. Lots of interesting options that don't
exist. I would sometimes just check the sheet to see if that particular
thing was installed on mine.

&gt;Two very basic things that the manual left me confused about that I'd
&gt;like some guidance on are: what type of motor oil is recommended? The
&gt;manual talks about &quot;environmental&quot; motor oil, what are they talking about?
&gt;Secondly, is premium gas needed? The manual talks about a lot of different
&gt;octane rating systems which left me confused.

I don't know what that 'environmental oil&quot;  means either. Dealer tells me
SG or SH grade oil, with SH preferable. Weight depends upon the temperature
I think. I don't have the manual in front of me.  They put Castrol GTX in
mine for the breakin, after which I'll probably switch to synthetic.
regarding the gas: that confused me too. I'm not sure which of the methods
in the manual corresponded to the current US pump ratings, which is (R+N)/2
I think.
Anyway, I've been running 'middle grade' in it - pump says 89 octane - and
haven't noticed any knocking. Perhaps someone else could truly enlighten us
on the proper octane rating system and how that compares to RON and
whatever else is mentioned in the manual.
