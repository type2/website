Well I bought a couple more buses last Saturday.  A high school
buddy who now is a campus missionary came by a few months ago
and fell in love with my 59 single cab.  A month goes by and I
get call from him.  He was talking to a friend at his church
telling him about my buses &amp; how he wishes he had one.  Turns
out the guy's father had a crew cab and his brother had a 21
window.  When my friend asked what ever happened to them the guy
says &quot;Up until 5 years ago they were stored on my father's farm
in the barn.  After my father sold the farm they moved them up to
my brother's cabin&quot;.

Two weeks ago my friend moved to Boston to attend divinity school.
Last Friday I get a call from the guy's father telling me my
friend had given him my number.  He wants to sell the buses.
Saturday I went over to his house &amp; we climbed in the 59 and
drove an hour up to where the buses were.  

The crew cab was a 62 and complete except for the rear seat.  One
gate on the passenger side needs to be replaced.  If anyone has a 
source for these, please let me know.  The wheel wells were cut
out (DOH!) and scoops were over the engine air vents.  It was 
parked in 85 because the transmission popped out of 2nd.

The 21 window was a 63 and had no engine or interior in the back.
His son was a landscaper and had used the bus to carry plants in.
It was rusty, but can be brought back.

After looking them over I ask the man what he wants for them and
he says &quot;Oh, about $200 for both of them should be about right&quot;.

We had a deal.  I gave him $200 and drove him home.  He told me he
was glad to give them to someone who could put them back on the road
and told me stories about how he used to love to drive the crew cab.

The 66 Hardtop Deluxe is now officially up for adoption.
