Subject: Vanagan Runs Too Cold

I have an 83 Vanagan Waterboxer that runs cold and refuses to warm up in
cold weather.  I have changed the thermostat but no change.  When the
problem first occurred I assumed a thermostat stuck open.  I went to the
local parts house and found the right thermostat though it cost $20.  After
changing it went to operating temperature while idling in the driveway so I
thought the problem was solved.  The next day or so I decided to drive into
town (12 mile round trip).  Temperature never got above the marks that mark
the low range (half-way between the low end and the low fluid warning
light.  One other symptom is a loss of coolant at about the rate of a pint
every 2 weeks.  There is no sign of fluid loss anywhere and when this
problem first occurred about a year ago I had a leak down test (overnight)
performed but the results were negative.  Has anybody got any ideas?  I
would really appreciate adivce/help on this.
