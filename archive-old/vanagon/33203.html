Had a great recirculation heater system on my '66 Micro Deluxe w/curio, 
though the heat was quickly lost through the ceiling. Buy a blower fan from 
a marine store and hook the intake to the &quot;rear&quot; heater box and the blower 
fan exhaust to the &quot;front&quot; heater box. This takes cold air from the floor in 
the rear, heats it twice and pumps it like crazy to the front vents. Nice 
heat.
