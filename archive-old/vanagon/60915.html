Subject: Re: alternator brushes

&gt;Thanks to Greg, Joel, Randy and Don, my alternator has been successfully
&gt;removed. And they were all right, it was easy.
&gt;
&gt;I took it to a local place that rebuilds them and they tried swapping
&gt;out the regulator without any luck.  They did say that the brushes were
&gt;extremely worn but they didn't have any of the right ones that they
&gt;could put into it.  Now my alternator is back at home without a dime
&gt;being spent on it yet.
&gt;
&gt;So, where's the best/cheapest place to find the brushes?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks all,
