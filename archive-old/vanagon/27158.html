&gt; I am currently looking to move closer to my work. In Phoenix it's almost

&gt; Westies is totally nuts! I am having a tough time just finding a double
&gt; carport. At work, the parking garage claims a 6'8&quot; clearance at one entrance
&gt; and 7'0&quot; at the other. I have *roughly* measured the '83 Westy to be near
&gt; 7'. The '67 should be slighty shorter. Sorry folks I'll park out side!!

The garage where i work, (Hey Lon, I work at the City Center Mall) the guy
who sold me my monthly parking pass siad the garage is 6'10&quot;, the entrance
at the door had one of those things that hang down that reads 6'8&quot;.  I can
fit everywhere in the garage except the entrance.  I now have some yellow
paint on my skylight.  so the '85 westy w/ skylight and &quot;heavy duty
suspension (?) is taller than 6'8&quot; and less than 6'10&quot;
