Subject: Re: Rust Question

Waxol is the best stuff. And yes, it is designed to neutralize existing
rust! But it isn't so good for exterior surfaces like the pipes you have in
mind. I seem to remember a post from a while back that those steel coolent
pipes are no longr available at the dealer. But the plastic pipes work great.


&gt;Hey All:
&gt;
&gt;I was under my Vanagon today and noticed that the pipes leading up to the 
&gt;radiator have lost their rust-coating and are starting to rust. Soooo, I 
&gt;searched the archives for some info on rustproofers and found Waxoyl.  My 
&gt;question is:
&gt;
&gt;Is this stuff good for surfaces that are already rusting.
