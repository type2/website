Before Big Sur, our next crazy social event is yet another wild party (here,
my house), and following are or may be coming:


Bradley Magnesium
Jeff Schneiter/Argo?
Al Knoll?
Steve/Linda Johnson?
Hugenards
Bill/Jean Abbott
Sam/Clara Williams
Mr. and Mrs. Bob Park - pansit

me/etc.

&quot;Pansit&quot; refers to a wonderful Fillipino dish Bob Park and his wife are
bringing for the potluck, and the rest of you are welcome to sign up, as well.  ;)
