&gt; There's no timing belt in MY vanagon. The horizontally opposed 4 VWs all

	Gerry,
	I've owned or inspected every front engine VW from Dasher to
Eurovan. They do indeed, each and every, have a timing belt, just like
a diesel Vanagon (which uses the same straight-4 as Rabbit/Golf/Golf///
blah blah blah)
	Aircooled VWs I have encountered all have pushrods. Porsche
Carrara engines (4 cam, 4 cylinder- *real* Carraras) have shaft drive
out to the cam boxes, and the 901/911/930/993 flat six has chain drive
to their single-cam per head.
	As I said, if Dave has a gasoline Vanagon, then he has no
belt. 
	Bill
