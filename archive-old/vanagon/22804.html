     Mark,
     
     &gt;Well the new rubber etc. is going in my front door windows with all 
     &gt;the glass and little metal pieces.  What I can't figure
     &gt;out is how to attach the metal piece with the notches in it that the 
     &gt;sliding windo latches to.  It has screw holes it it, but there are 
     &gt;none in the door top.  Does it screw into the felt strip, rubber 
     &gt;strip under that, or what?
     
     The notched strip screws onto the inside of the door frame. So it 
     should have holes for these screws.
     
     Lee.
