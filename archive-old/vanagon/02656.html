&gt;Speaking of removing my bus steering wheel and putting it in the oven
&gt;at 300 degrees for thirty minutes, umm,

why? why, uncle Carl? why are you doing this? huh? huh? huh? huh, carl?
why are you doing this? huh? :)

&gt;How the !_at_#%$ do you guys get yer steering wheels off of yer busses?

ok. the way i got mine off was to go down to the local sears store and
order the big mother socket (i think it's 24mm ... or was it 28mm?) that
fit the nut on the wheel. first, you have to get that little horn button
out of the way. that's fun. :)  on the vanagon, look around the edges of
the button (or around the back of the arms of the wheel ... can't remember
which year does what).

once i got the socket, it was no big deal to loosen that nut. i couldn't
get a crescent wrench in there, but a box-end might fit.  get the nut off,
and just start thumping the wheel around the outside rim (where you put
your hands when driving) from underneath. after a few minutes of thumping,
it was loosened up enough to come off.

installation is the reverse of removal. :)

&gt;have y'all(s) done it in the past?  Someone before me put the wheel on
&gt;rotated by 180 degrees, which is fine except for the part about driving
&gt;thirty miles down the road with an uncancelled blinker going %-( ...

it's possible that someone screwed up the alignment underneath the car.
if they take all the ajustment out of one side, it'll move the wheel like
that. might want to get that checked first, then (with the alignment correct)
move the wheel to where you want it.
