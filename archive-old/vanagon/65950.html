&gt; Subject: Continued oil buzzer/warning light hassle
&gt; Date: Thursday, September 25, 1997 12:54 PM
&gt;
&gt; Thanks to all listees who gave advice on this problem 2 weeks ago.
&gt;
&gt; Vehicle: 86 Syncro, 131M, engine in good shape.
&gt;
&gt; Symptoms: The oil warning light/buzzer come on after the first cold start
&gt; of the day.  The warning begins about 30 seconds after start-up (about
the
&gt; time the engine gets to 1500+ rpm, and maintains that minimum rpm for a
few
&gt; seconds).  If I simply idle longer at initial start up, the warning waits
&gt; until I drive off and the revs get to 1500+.  This regularly occurs if
&gt; ambient overnight temps are under 60 F.  (In Minnesota, most nights are
&gt; colder than this.)  Warning stops after a few tenths of a mile of 30 mph
&gt; driving.  Occasionally, warning comes on at idle after engine is fully
&gt; warmed up, but stops as soon as normal driving resumes.
&gt;
&gt; Initial solution: Dump Valvaline 10-40 and Fram filter, and replace with
&gt; official VW filter and Castrol 20-50.
&gt;
&gt; Results: Warning comes on at same time but seems to go off sooner.
&gt;
&gt; Qustions: Am I really low on oil pressure?  What should be done next?
&gt;
&gt; Research: Vanagon archives indicate a &quot;high&quot; and a &quot;low&quot; oil pressure
&gt; switch.  The &quot;high&quot; (.9 bar, 13.1 psi) switch is effective at 2000+ rpm.
&gt; Does this mean that I should get a new &quot;high&quot; switch and/or check all
&gt; electrical connections for this circuit to assure that warnings are
&gt; accurate instead of electical gremlins.  If switch is ok (and/or replaced
&gt; if defective), does this mean warnings are accurate (as the symptoms
&gt; replicate consistently), indicating oil pump replacement is necessary.
&gt;
&gt; Any hints/advice will be greatly appreciated.
