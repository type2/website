Hello all,
	I have been trying to get in contact with K.E.P. but the phone
number that I found in the archives will not go through.  Does anyone have
a newer number?  The number that I'm trying is, (805)272-1147.
	Also has anyone here had a Subaru engine installed into their
Vanagon?  Any reliability problems? TIA
