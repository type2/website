Subject: Crossing a Syncro w/ Camper


Hello all,
	I was wondering if it is at all feasible to turn a rear wheel 
drive Westy into a Syncro.  I'm considering this since Synchro Westfalias 
don't seem to come any cheaper than $13,000, while non-Westy Syncro's 
seem to be under $5000.  So, when my engine collapses, it's got 129K on 
it now, I'll just buy a cheap Syncro and get a new(to me) engine, 
transmission, and of course AWD.  Please let me know if I've stepped 
outside the confines of reality.  Thanks!

Cory
