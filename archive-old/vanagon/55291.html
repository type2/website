Subject: Re: Euro headlight.


&gt;&gt;&gt;I saw late model vans ('86 and up) with round headlights (in the US they
&gt;&gt;&gt;would've been rectangular) that weren't the normal 7&quot; (18 cm ?) but much
&gt;&gt;&gt;larger like 9&quot; (23 cm).  I saw these on all the police and ambulance Vans
&gt;&gt;&gt;as well as regular Vans.  What were these lights, and are they available 
as
&gt;&gt;&gt;a modification?  Or are they a government only type option.

&gt;&gt;No, the duo round headlights are sold as regular.

&gt;I think I we're on the wrong wavelength.  The round lights I'm refering to
&gt;are BIG, much bigger than the standard round lights found on pre '86 Vans
&gt;here and most over there. The Golf's are the standard size, and no where
&gt;near as big as these others.

The light I refer to fits the full vertical size of the upper grille. There
are no bigger lights which fit into this place, not on my knowledge. All
police and ambulance vans have same headlights I have on my own. No special
options for government purposes.

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt;&gt;&gt;A second set-up had the  normal round head lights but with driving lights
&gt;&gt;&gt;in the grille similar to the later model GTI's (up to '91).  Do you know
&gt;&gt;&gt;anything about these?

&gt;&gt;Do you speak about quad round headlights in the upper grille? I know that
&gt;&gt;this are available from VW South Africa and an American supplier (250 
USD).
&gt;&gt;Ask Chris (102660.66) for details. But I can check if this are available
&gt;&gt;from VW parts suppliers.

&gt;Yes that's the one.  The upper grille has driving lights like the '90 GTIs
&gt;do.  But South Africa?  I can't believe there isn't a European 
manufacturer.

I guess they are available from Votex, Germany, I have to check this first.

 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt;&gt;Additional lights are available for an extended lower grille. Two 
different
&gt;&gt;sets are available: Dou retangular foglights or beams, quad retangular
&gt;&gt;for foglights and beams.

&gt;This is a new one for me.  How much are those, and who sells them?  I have
&gt;the D&amp;W catalog ($10 in Europe, $45 over here) and I didn't see that 
listed.

Winkler:
Duo retangular fog lights, lower grille from turn to turn light, including
bulbs, wiring and relay
DM 350.00

Quad retangular lights, lower grille between turn lights
DM 530.00

Oettinger:
Foglights in lower grille extensions (turn lights within the frame),
Hella DE-System, OE 631 009 00
DM 704.00

&gt;PS where do you live?

I'm located near Du:sseldorf, Germany, at the boarder to The Netherlands.
