Parody Title       : The Split from '69

Original Performer : Bryan Adams
Album              : So Far So Good

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

I got my first real Bus then
Bought it from a friend of mine
Drove it 'til the engine quit
'Twas the summer of '69

Oh that bus was so cool
No complaints, though I drove it hard
When it quit, I got another
Won't drive any other car

But when I look back now
That bus it seemed to last forever,
And if it had survived
Yeah, it would have won those trophies
It was the best 'Dub of my life

Ain't no use in complaining
Since VW's got a job to do
But I miss that great splittie style
Eurovans just don't do, no!

Breadloafs and Vanagons, oh -
They should have kept that style forever
And if we had a choice,
We'd keep them in production always
Those were the best 'Dubs off the line

... That was the summer of '69 ...

But I'm just killin' time
But those were great Busses!
I wish they could be mine - 
I guess nothin' can last forever - forever no

And now the times are changin'
Look at all the Dubs that came and gone
Sometimes when I drive my Vanagon,
I think bout the splits for which I still long

Breadloafs and Vanagons, oh -
They should have kept that style forever
And if we had a choice,
We'd keep them in production always
Those were the best 'Dubs off the line

Back in the Summer of '69 ...
