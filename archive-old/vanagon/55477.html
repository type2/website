Subject: Re: Syncro Update: The Perfect Sleeper, Better Tires, &amp; Stud ?


	My local VW dealer wants $9.50 ea.  However BBS makes replacement
studs for the vanagon that are long enough for alloy wheels, well the
carat wheels at least.  Sorry I don't know the part # from BBS.  But they
are $5.50 ea.

&gt; The main thing I need to run the BBS's on the Syncro are longer studs.
&gt; Anybody know a part # for studs that are about 1.5 cm longer for a Syncro
&gt; or the rear of a reg. Vanagon?  TIA,
