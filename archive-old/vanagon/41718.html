Subject: Re: deer (true story)


&gt;The question that I come away with is, why did the cop kill the deer
&gt;if it had recovered?  Was it still pretty messed up?

Naah, he just took advantage of the pummelling and abuse of a helpless
herbivore, to indulge in his repressed desires to glory in blowing the
brains out of any living creature he could find.   ;)

Of course it was messed up. Why else would he have done it?

ObVW content: The shots probably scared the bus as much as they scared
any wildlife around.   :^)
