Subject: Re: thread on underpowered?

&gt;
&gt;BUT ... with my handy dandy trip computer, i did some semi-serious testing
&gt;at steady (cruise control) rpms ... clocking the fuel consumption over ten
&gt;liters or so (takes about an hour at each rpm). and this is what i found:
&gt;
&gt;4000 rpm  4.3 min/liter =&gt; 18.1 mpg   at 67.0 mph

Isn't 67mph at 4000 rpm kind of slow?  The bentley manual says something like
18.1 mph per 1000 revs in fourth gear.  When I'm turning 4000 in fourth gear,
my speedo is at 72 or so.
