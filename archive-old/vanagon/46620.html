howdy volks,
	Since the list is splitting so am I :')  I'm heading to Atlanta, 
Savannah, New Orleans, Houston, Galveston, and eventually Austin.  Not 
necessarily in that order, and with numerous detours to anyplace that 
strikes my fancy. I just did a compression check= 130, 125, 130, 140. 
Not bad, huh?  
	For spare parts I'm taking: points, plugs, plug wires, rotor, 
dist cap, coil, carb, 9 quarts of oil, fuel filters, 12&quot; of fuel line, 
hose clamps, valve cover gaskets, and a partridge in a pear tree.
Did I leave anything important out?  

Anybody who is between here(northern VA) and Texas and thinks there is 
something/body I should see or meet, let me know.  I'm taking off 
tomorrow late afternoon.  I really appreciate all the good information 
and camraderie exchanged on this list.  It'll be the only thing I miss 
after I leave.  Well, maybe my girlfriend.  Nah, she dosen't even like 
VW's (what was I thinking?)

If anybody would like to respond email me personally as I'm no longer on 
V_at_L.
