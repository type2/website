Subject: GNATT Update - Yosemite
Date: Fri, 9 Jun 1995 23:48:50 -0700 (PDT)

Hi Volks,
	I haven't found out for sure, but apparently Dave Kautz has heard
that most of Yosemite is still snowed in.  This is going to throw a major
monkey wrench in the GNATT schedule, and I don't know what to do about it
yet.  If Tamarack Flat campground is closed, that only leaves the
reservation campgrounds open, and they will be packed.  Suggestions at
this point would be welcomed (please post or send them to Martha as my
e-mail access will be sporadic for the rest of the trip).

Thanks,
	-David

p.s.  We are at Alistair's place on Vancouver island, BC where he and 
his wife just treated us to a wonderful dinner!  This place is awesome,
you all should see it!  :)
