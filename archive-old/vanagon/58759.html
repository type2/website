Subject: Re: Start/No Start 87 Vanagon

I had this exact problem on my 87.  In my case it turned out to be the 
start/selenoid (one unit).  It turns out that Bosch has redesigned them 
slightly...hopefully for the better.  My bad one turned out to be full 
of water through the little rubber grommet where the wires enter the 
unit.
