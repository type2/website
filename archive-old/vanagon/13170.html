&gt; &gt;Okay, hear are the possibilities I know of:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;1. The needle gas inlet valve on the top of your carb may be loose.
&gt; &gt;   Fix: Take off the top of the car and tighten.
&gt;                       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Well Heath, now that you and someone else has gotten soooo much mileage

Cheers!
