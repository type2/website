All,

There is a certain M-code for this option, it is called
something like &quot;1.2 ton loadcapacity&quot;, this was mostly
ordered on pick-ups. If you have a cooperative VW-dealer
you can ask him to look for &quot;M-code rearshocks&quot;, that's
what i did. For my '73 they were not available anymore,
(although you can probably still order them straight
from Boge, Bilstein or Fichtel &amp; Sachs with the VW part#)
My dealer told me that the last known prices was around
750,- Dutch Guilders EACH.  750 : 1.65 makes us$454.55 !!!

Brian.
