&gt; 
&gt; Btw just got Recycled Incs catalog - new for 94-95 - very informative-
&gt; they sell lots of new and recycled stuff (for purists, junkyard parts)
 
   Could you post the address/phone of these guys? This would make a great
addition to Joel's FAQ project...
&gt; 
&gt; Anyone else out there have a five speed on their vanagon? With my whopping 
&gt; 48 HP its really nice to have an extra gear for hilly Ithaca.
&gt; 
   Sure, I was satisfied with 48 hp and 4 speeds and 4 heater levers. 
Now I find out that somebody else has more speeds than I do. Maybe
I'll add another heater lever or something...
