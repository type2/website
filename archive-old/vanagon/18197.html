Subject: brake question

On my brother's `61 he has an interesting brake problem--the passenger rear
wheel will start dragging. All new brake stuff except lines. You can
go to the rear and loosen the bleeder screw and there will be some pressure,
back the adjusters off a bit, and it will be fine until the next time.
