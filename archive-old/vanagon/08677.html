So Thom Fitzpatrick says:
&gt; 
&gt;  	After I put the right drum back on, I was hearing a slight scraping, and 
&gt; I just figured it was the spiffy new shoes, so I didn't worry about it, but
&gt; now it makes loud scrapy-squeeky noises when I drive.  But not when I first
&gt; start out, I get about a mile or so and then it starts, like it has to heat
&gt; up first to make the noise.

How well did you clean off the drums?  Did they need turning/replacing?
That's what I'd suspect.

&gt; 
&gt; 	The bearing looked so-so, not quite over the hill but with a darn good
&gt; view of the valley on the other side.  
&gt; 
&gt; 	Any ideas?  Should I just replace it out of principle?  The brakes are
&gt; so radically different now, its like a whole new bus!  And I haven't even 
&gt; touched the back ones yet!!

That depends on you.  Was it easy for you to tear into this job?  Or was it
a PITA?  For me, I'd replace it as long as I was in there as well as anything
else that looked like it had a 'good view of the valley'. ;)  That way, I 
don't have to tear it apart again for a while and not have to be thinkin'
should I or should I not have done it?
