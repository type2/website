Old Beer Bottle                &lt;i didn't make this one up. it's old&gt;

It was only an old beer bottle,
Afloatin' o'er the foam.
It was only an old beer bottle,
Near a million miles from home.
In it there was a message,
On which these words enthrone:
&quot;Whoever finds this bottle
Finds all the beer is gone.&quot;
