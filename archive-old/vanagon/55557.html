Subject: 86 syncro needs ne engine

Hello, I have a 86 VW Vanagon GL Syncro, with a 131k miles and it's 
tired.  Would like to put a new engine in it but nobody in my area will 
touch that. If you know of somwone or have an idea where i could find 
some more info in the Vail Colorado, Denver area, it would be 
appreciated.  Thank you.
