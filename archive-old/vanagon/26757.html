Subject: Re: Winnebago Rialta

Yes, saw one last weekend.  Looked like a skunk coming out of a garbage can. 
Small EV front sticking out of a BIG box that says I'm fat and expensive and 
I waddle.  The Westy-look is no more!  It falls into the same category as 
1/4 ton Toyota pickups with similiar tumour growths on their backside, butt 
ugly.  Didn't go inside, it was private, not at a dealer.  My wife was not 
impressed by the eyesore either.  While there are few real alternatives to a 
Westy, there are lots of choices similiar to the Rialta. Doubt it will grab 
a big market share. IMHO!
I have seen the next size Westy, built on VWs LT15 or LT28 trucks, Audi 5 
cyls up front, rear drive. These are impressive beasts, standing headroom 
with a 6&quot; hightop, beds are across the beast, real 'living-room' feel due to 
the open space inside. This would have made a better 'Rialta'. Again IMHO.  
Want one of those next, for really extended touring.
