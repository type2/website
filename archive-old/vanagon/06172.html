Subject: Re: Heute ist Freitag. Schtats again. :) + Fine Poetry

Thanks Joel, for statistically locating my place in the Universe.  
Now that I know where it is, can I leave?

But first, poetry:

The small town cop follows
my Bus, waiting and hoping
for drugs and hippies
but finding
only
a middle-aged couple,
one bald one stocky,
with a bad map
