Subject: Re: 1989 Westy Parts Available (sob)

&gt;There is a 1989 Westy parts car that has recently been sent to the local vw
&gt;dismantlers. If anyone needs parts, let me know.
&gt;

I'll take the interior, all of it, please arrange removal , crating, 
shipping ( to Maine), BTW will this cost more than $500????  Seriously, once 
again I'm SOOL, looks like I'm never going to get a home on wheels buit into 
the Syncro.

Out of curiosity, would you ask the going price for all the interior 
fittings, you pick style, I'm curious as to what I will have to fork out 
(eventually?) thanks tim s.
