&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Into a typical garage (most owners' garages that I know of), it
&gt; will barely fit (with standard tires).  If you have one of those
&gt; little plexiglass domes protruding like a gunner's port, then you are
&gt; out of luck...

	My '91 has the skylight and will pass through a standard garage
	door opening if I make sure the door is all the way up.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;   I've checked the usual sources, but couldn't find what the height of a
&gt; &gt;   Vanagon Westfalia is.  Does anyone know?  (I'm wondering if one would fit
&gt; &gt;   in my garage.)  Thanx!
&gt; 
&gt; 

	The total height is listed in the owners manual (I looked for
	capability of driving into car washes). I don't have here (at work).
	Will note to look tonight.

	scr
