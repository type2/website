Subject: Update: 16&quot; Syncro Photos
Date: Tue, 15 Apr 1997 15:05:42 -0400

Got an email and several images from a member of the Europe based Syncro
16&quot; Association. Not a lot we did not know, but plenty of action: A
syncro in Africa, some shots during an off-road rally, and out in the
boon-docks
of Europe.

Its at the usual place,  http://www.pipeline_dot_com/~tforhan/swhome.htm 
 

Enjoy,

Tom F.
