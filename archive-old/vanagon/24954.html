&gt;If you think /showers are cool, you oughta check out Steve &quot;Ratboy&quot; 
Johnson's
&gt;electric porta-potti.  I think he has some electric pliers, too.  BTW,
&gt;that's all on his &quot;FIVE&quot; cyl. westy.

Don't think I want to know what the electricity is used for in the john--
surprise, instant cure for constipation, to keep those pit stops short?

As for the electric pliers... &lt;shudder!&gt;
I'll just let nature take its course, I guess.
