&gt;    Do any of you keep a computer on your brick? Besides the engine one,
&gt;I mean. I'm restoring a '73 Westy and want to build a system into it, one
&gt;way or another. Got any ideas? Any good sources for larger size LCD
&gt;screens? I figure I could just mount a motherboard, powersupply, etc.,
&gt;right inside a wall panel, and forget the case.

You mean a regular PC? How about a laptop? There is an accessory out there
so you can plug it into the cigarette lighter. If you want I can check my
manual.

I wonder if there exists some sort of device that you could plug in
between the engine (maybe the fuel injection) and the PC and then some
software allowing you to monitor/analyze the engine. I know that --at
least for the early fuel injected engines-- VW had a computer they used
for diagnostics and which plugged right into some receptacle in the engine
compartment. That might be a starting point.
