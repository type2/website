Subject: SOTO directions found/Classic tix info

Over the past few days, VanBondo has brow beat both the fine folks at
Periscope Enterprises and the folks of SOTO.
In a paraphrased version of a private reply to my inquiry about tickets to
the Classic and directions to the SOTO meet, Mr. Rich Kimball &lt;
vwclassic_at_earthlink_dot_net &gt;, the promoter for the Classic wrote:

*Classic Tix*
If you go to the toy show, (at the Irvine Holiday Inn- 714/863-1999)Saturday
after the SOTO you may purchase a discout ticket from my daughter, or you
can call in a MC or Visa on Monday &lt;ellis figures that getting tix via snail
mail at this late date oughta be done VERY early in the week&gt;
Periscope can be contacted at:
(714)544-1759 phone or (714)731-8780 fax
Of course regular entry fees can be paid at the gate on the morning of the show.

*SOTO directions*
Saturday June 7th
The Long Beach Vets Stadium is indeed in Long Beach. You get off the 405 at
Lakewood Blvd and go inland, just opposite from Circle Motors where several of
the past regular meets have been.
========================
Call early and tell 'em that VanBondo sent cha!
See y'all there!
