Hi All,

I'm getting nervous now.  In your opinion, are we about to make a mistake 
buying a new  1997  Eurovan Camper as far as VW reliability and parts and 
service is concerned? 


Will we be able to easily get parts for the engine and drive train now or 
in seven or ten years?

Is this 97 EV going to be a pain to maintain?????

Like most of us in the mailing list I'm pretty mechanically inclined and 
I feel confident I'll be able to fix, or redesign or redo most of the 
plumbing, electric and so forth of the van. Is there alot to the &quot;life 
support&quot; systems on board that we would have to rely on expensive or 
nonexistent service personnel?

Will we be able  to easily  get parts for the Winnebago equipment 
(stove,refrigerator, heater)?



I could really use your help!   We don't ever spend this kind of money 
($35K) so I am feeling very anxious not &quot;knowing the ropes&quot; of  VW 
Performance, Parts and Service. 


Thank You x 1000!   (or is it 35,000?)
