&gt; &gt; What's ever'body doin' over July 4th weekend?  Any trips in the
&gt; &gt; making?

There is a great music festival in Jamestown, NY (near Erie, Pa) called the
Great Blue Heron Music Festival that takes place anually over the July 4
weekend (Friday through Sunday).  My wife and I go every year.  Wide
variety of music: folk, rock, bluegrass, world music, blues, native
American, you name it.  Mostly regional or out-of-the-mainstream acts,
although some now-popular bands like 10,000 Maniacs and Rusted Root started
out playing at this festival and/or it's sister festival two weeks later in
Ithaca, NY (The Grassroots Music Festival, equally recommended). There are
also crafts booths, workshops, kids events, and more. Both vehicle and tent
camping are available on site, which is rather scenic, with lots of open
space, big trees, and a big lake right in front of the camping area
(swimming allowed).  The festival is small and not terribly crowded.
Admission is around $40 or so for the weekend as I recall, including
camping.  This year Stefan Ufer from the Type 2 list will be meeting us
there; I don't know of any other list members going but there always seem
to be at least five or ten Westies there.  There is a website for the
festival; not sure what it is offhand, but I'm sure you could pull it up
with a search engine, or let me know if you need me to find and post it. 
Evon and I drive about 6-8 hours to get there every year, and it's easily
worth the trip.  If you're anywhere near NY or Pa., I'd highly recommend it
for a very relaxing and entertaining July 4 weekend.

By the way, about 1/2 hour from there is a small, private RV campground
right on Lake Erie that Evon and I found by chance a couple of years ago,
and now visit the night before the festival every year.  Never very crowded
(at least so far). You pull your Westy right up to the edge of a cliff
overlooking the Lake Erie.  There is a rickety stairway leading down to a
small, secluded beach and a small waterfall on the rocks nearby.  Really
beautiful view from the camper, with the sound of the waves in the
background all night long.  Costs about ten or twelve bucks for the night
as I recall.  Don't remember the name of the place, but could give vague
(but probably sufficient) directions to anyone interested.
