Subject: Re: winch on bus?

Someone asked about winches while I was away on vacation.

I use a 4,000 lb Warn winch on my Vanagon. I keep it under the back seat and
get it out when I am stuck. Works great and it is normally hidden from view
so it doesn't muck up the appearance of the vehicle or get stolen here where
I park in NYC on the street. I relocated the rear heater to the left (next
to the brain) side so there would be space for the winch under the back
seat, then I added hidden locks to the back seat to deter theft.  

I think it draws 380 amps to start but then less after it is moving, like,
90 amps or so. I put in the Warn 2 gague cable and have quick disconnects
for power hidden at the front and rear of the vehicle so I can winch out
backwards or forwards. Tow hooks added to the vehicle make convenient
attachment points for the chain that comes with the winch.

I also carry and use a high lift jack. Both items have saved me many times.

As for finding no place to attach the winch cable, I have found that the
secret is to bring lots of stretchem straps and lots of extension wire. I
carry 3 30' 2&quot;stretem straps and have two lengths of cable (100'?) so almost
a football field length in which to find a tree. 

I used to carry a hand operated winch but it is really inadequate compared
with what you get with the 4,000lb electric jobbie.

In really bad mud I always double the winch line back to the vehicle via a
pully and so get 8,000 lbs of pull instead of just 4,000 lbs. Any winch less
than 4,000 lbs on a Vanagon really isn't worth much.

The front of a Vanagon is a nice place to mount a winch permanently if you
prefer as the metal is quite beefy.
