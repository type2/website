Subject: lesson relearned

          another lesson relearned.  i've driven the '66 bus a little
          over 3k since the rebuilt motor, including to mt. mitchell
          and back to florida and have never complained about the
          brakes.  in fact i bragged about them a few months back on
          this list.  my wife borrowed the beast last week and came
          back ranting about &quot;no brakes! almost killed!&quot;.  sooo,
          saturday she parked my butt in the driveway with brake tools
          and a pot of coffee and said &quot;fix it!&quot;

          i grumbled of course and protested it was a waste of time
          and the brakes were fine when i drove the bus, blah, blah.

          they were SO FAR out of adjustment i was amazed they still
          worked.  1/2 hour later we went out for a test drive with me
          in the driver's seat and i damn near put lea thru the
          windshield at the first tap of the pedal.  wow!

          so a public apology to lea for being a butthead.  and a
          public reminder that it is amazing what we can get used to
          as normal especially when the condition gets slowly worse
          rather than all at once.  i was pumping the brakes every
          time i used them, which i now realize every time i get
          lurched forward now that they are adjusted properly!
          regular maintenance, brothers and sisters.  it is the only
          way to be safe.  end of lecture.
