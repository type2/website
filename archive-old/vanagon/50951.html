Subject: 87 Synchro CV Boots

I just bought and '87 Synchro, and an outboard front CV boot let go the 
first day (did I turn a corner too tight?). I plan on pulling all the 
axles and repacking the joints.  What's the best CV boot available, and 
where can I get them?  Is there a split boot available (for a temporary 
measure)?

Also, where's a good place to get VW and Vanagon parts in the Boston 
area?

Was I surprised when I did a Net search for &quot;Vanagon&quot; and found this 
mailing list.   Now I have something to look forward to when I check my 
e-mail!
