Subject: Reinforced Sidewalls and Eu

Ric &quot;I like to late brake for exit ramps&quot; ponders...

&gt;So, after all this....do I NEED reinforced sidewalls on my EV??

Well, Ric, if you're the kind of driver I think you are (and I'm pretty
sure I'm right...), I think you might want to keep looking for those
reinforced sidewalls.  I don't think anyone *needs* reinforced sidewalls,
but if you'll recall the thread we had last summer on the list about tires,
I think it was pointed out that making directional changes on non-reinforced
tires resulted in additional wallowing from sidewall flex due to increased
vehicle weight.
  
Have you considered the following?:

1) Mail order tire stores.  I believe this was also discussed last summer,
and though I've never purchased tires mail order, I'm seriously considering
giving it a shot with a set of Yoko A509s for the wife's GLI/GTX.
Anyway, the MXLs *might* be less $$$ going that route.

2) I saw in the Zender catalog a T4 Transporter (as PJ would say) with
what appeared to be 16&quot; wheels.  Now considering the slim pickings in
65 profile truck (reinforced) tires, I doubt if the rubber mounted on those
wheels (probably P-Zeroes) were reinforced.  Of course, you probably
wouldn't have a lot of flex with 40-45 profile tires.
The only problem with this is $$$$$x4.

3) Picture this: you and the family are out for a nice Sunday drive in the
&quot;new&quot; 944 when you spot an EV in the Used Car lot of the (dreaded) VW 
dealer.  Curious, you stop to look it over and notice that it only has 
10K mi. on the clock, and the tires, Michelin MXLs in 205/65/15, all look
&quot;almost new.&quot;  Drawing on all your lawyerly traits and ingratiating skills,
you manage to take the EV out for a test drive, alone, and inexplicably
find yourself in your driveway....
An hour later you're back at the dealership, telling the salesperson that
the EV wasn't really what you were looking for, that you were more of a 
Ford Windstar kind of car shopper....
Best of all, your tire dilemna has been postponed, oh, say 30K mi. or so.


OK,OK, so #3 above is really a JOKE; I couldn't think of any more witty
options for Ric to pursue in his tire search, which must really be 
taking a toll on him, as he just hasn't been his ol' self since dukin' it
out with those Vintagevw folks last week...   :-)
