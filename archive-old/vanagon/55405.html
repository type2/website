Subject: Vanagon &quot;annihilation&quot; on TV.......

Did anyone elso see FOX's &quot;Worlds Scariest Police chases&quot;? 
One of the chaces involves the pursuit of a stolen Army tank wreaking havoc in a
residential area somewhere in SoCal. The driver is intentionally running over
vehicles and anything in his path.
One shot from a Police chopper zooms in on a dark grey metallic Vanagon (the
color that was widely used on the '87-'88 wolfsburg ed.) that is right in the
tanks path......
SQUASH!!!!
It actually pushes the Vanagon backwards for a bit until it hits a RV, then
squashes the Vanagon, as well as the RV behind it. 

They later show a closeup of the Van after it was squashed. The drivers side and
the roof were crushed to the ground, and a little of the passengers side
remained.

ouch...
