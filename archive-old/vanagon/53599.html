Subject: Can I route wires through the fire wall


Hi--this is related to another post regarding cruise control systems, but 
more general in nature.....

I want to locate the servo mechanism for the cruise control under the rear 
bench seat away from significant electromagnetic interference.  To do so, I 
would like to route the vacuum line and cruise control throttle cable 
throught the fire wall, past the gas tank and into the engine compartment.

Has anyone done such a thing?

With the gas tank inbetween the fire wall and engine, i fear some serious 
turns would be involved in the routing, something that would introduce quite 
a bit of drag to the control cable.

any help out there?

please respond to me directly as I do not recieve daily list correspondance.

thanks, and happy new year,
Fred porter
