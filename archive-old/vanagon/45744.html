Colin,

Thanks to you and Tim Smith for tips on shocks and rotors.  After my test
drive tonight I'll post my project review.

I did find the flat head screws needed for the rotors at my ----  local VW
dealer.  First time I had been there in years, and actually got away for a
part under a buck!!.  Anyway I got two extras for you, no charge, if you
want.  Just need a mailing address.
