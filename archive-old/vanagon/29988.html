     &gt;This is an interesting way to sell a bus... I could see it if it
     &gt;was some rare beast of a vehicle, but...

     It will certainly be interesting to watch. If you visit the site
     (latecomers, its at http://www.ebay_dot_com:80/aw/item.cgi?item=464930 )
     every day or so, you can see if there is any action.

     If no bids are forthcoming, e-mail the owner. Heck, e-mail him anyway.
     Maybe he'll tell you that he THINKS the parts van is a '60, and
     that it has a funny big door in back.

     Since I'm notawanna splittie, its up to someone else.
