Last bike haul I had BOTH.  5 bikes do not like to fit on 1 carrier !
I have an old clamp-on-the-bumper type for the front and a strap it 
on for the back (kids bike on back).

&gt; &gt;after having one mounted in back for a while, i gave it up and went 
&gt; &gt;to a front mounted.  the dust accumulation was incredible in back.  
&gt; &gt;i'd rather have bugs than dust.

&gt; Me too, more protein.
