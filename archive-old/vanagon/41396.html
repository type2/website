Subject: Re: Alert:Water tube

These water tubes were extrememly rusted on my '87.  The price for 
new ones was some ungodly number so i sandblasted mine and &quot;Extend&quot;-
ed them for rust treatment.

The dealer here does routinely replace these as a service item for 
Medi-Van's fleet.  They DO get rusty, they DO leak and they ARE still 
readily available, if ya got the clams.
