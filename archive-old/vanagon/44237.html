Subject: Touch-up Paint for Vgon?


The V6anagon has more than its share of paint dings, some recent,
some not. a few oldies have rust developing under them, which I'd
like to sand down and coat so they don't get out of hand.

But my FLAPS doesn't have any paint shade that's even close to the
pale yellow/medium brown colors of the car, which I think (well, guess)
are original from 1980.

Other than the dealer ($12 for a teensy bottle, special-ordered), does
anyone know of a place to get some touch-up paint that comes real close
to VW colors, give or take a little sun fading?
