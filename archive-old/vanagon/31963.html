Wasn't there an ad out a few years ago for the Corrado that had a Beetle 
being dropped off a cliff?  I think the voice-over said something like
&quot;Before, this was the only way to get a Volkswagen to accelerate form 
0-60 in less than 8 seconds(or however fast it was).&quot;

Maybe I'm just making stuff up, I can't remember for sure.
