Subject: Re: Gas Heater Documentation

Ooops, sorry.

I'm pretty sure it's the BN-4 Eberspracher. I don't have the bus with me, 
so I can't check right now.

My apologies if anyone was asking on the list. I'm set to digest at the 
moment pending some project completions. I love the list, but I can't 
resist reading the mail as it comes in. My only solution is digest mode, 
which is a good way for me to minimize the distractions and maximize 
production for the University-machine I work for 8).

&gt; Tell the list what type of heater you have (BN4, BA6, etc.) so we can go 
&gt; through our archives and tell you if we have a manual or not.
