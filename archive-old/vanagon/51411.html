All,

&gt; country side, I just had to check out the VW dealer in La Paz.  

&gt; The best part was the price, because for a mere 45,000 pesos you 
&gt; could have one of these (I didn't get a price on the bus).  On that 

Wow cool!  Then maybe I could get one sent over to Australia?!  Hmm...I 
would like that!  A brand new (or even 1,2 or 3 years old even!)  Cool!

Hey, how about buying just one of those Beetle 1.6 l fuel injected 
engines to put into my bus?!  That'd be nice! 

Darren.
