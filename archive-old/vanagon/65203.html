 Your stop light episodes sound too familiar.  Unfortunately, it could be
 many things.

My 87 had similar symptoms.  Upon a very expensive diagnosis and repair we
found a burned out &quot;idle speed motor&quot; as the mechanic called it, which also
finally caused one of the little black boxes associated with it to fail.
 After the fix, I had problems with rough idle at stops with the same type of
take-off problem.  That problem turned out to be a loose throttle body caused
by one missing bolt/nut and the remaining bolt or nut loose to the point that
starting and take-off was slow until vacuum sucked the throttle body back in
place.  The throttle body problem fix was real cheap but the other problem
cost me about $700 with the pre-tune-up required for proper diagnosis of the
fuel injection system.

Good Luck
