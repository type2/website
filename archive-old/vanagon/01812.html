A recent question querried:

&gt;Has anyone seen the TV add for the Corrado with the &quot;bug's eye view&quot;?
&gt;Wonder what that would be like if they did the same add for a Vanagon?

First off...it was an ad for a Golf /// I believe...

Second, the bug would get to within 5 feet of the Vanagon and
be splattered against the built up airpressure wake infront
of the vanagon...why else would Vanagons be referred to around here
as &quot;bricks&quot;?
