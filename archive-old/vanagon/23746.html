Subject: Wheel Bearing Questions...

All,

This weekend I worked on the wheel bearings, as I assumed that they needed to
be replaced. Well I was wrong, as some suggested, the brake pads were adjusted
a little too close, and was causing the unusual noise. Readjusted and now all
is hunky-dory. I noticed that my brake drums are getting a little ragged
looking. Is there a way that the races for the wheel bearings can be removed
and put in new brake drums, when the time comes, without taking them to a
maching shop? The PO did good and put new seals, and wheel bearings in and they
are quite far from worn, so naturally I would like to save them when I get new
drums. Also someone sent me a message imploring me not to stick aftermarket
gauges in my Thing's dash, I can assure that person that I have no intention
of cutting up the dash anymore than the PO did.  My intention is to mount them
below the dash in those mounting pods that bolt to the underside of it.
Speaking of dashboards, does anyone know of a source for dash pieces.  The
section of the dashboard where the light switch is, has 3 extra holes drilled
in it where the PO put in a homemade turnsignal setup, when the switch on the
steering column went bad(supposedly) haven't tested it yet. On that note, does
anyone know how to test that switch w/o pulling the steering wheel, as I do
not have a wheel puller, and is the steering wheel puller really necessary?

Thanks,             74 Thing
