Subject: AC Blowing Out Black Material
Date: Mon, 31 Mar 1997 12:42:21 -0600

Lately when I have been running the A/C on my 88 Westy the unit has been
blowing out bits of a black plastic material that looks like it is from
some kind of air filter that has been chopped up by the A/C fan.  The
A/C seems to work OK but I wonder if I should be concerned about this,
what is goning on, and whether I should have it fixed.

Also is it possibe to upgrade the A/C on an 88 Westy to run on the new
(R134?) refigerent? Are there kits available and who should I have do
it. Hopefully not my VW dealership.  As you may know the A/C on an 88 is
different, the entire unit is in the rear roof with outlits in the rear
only (beacuse of the pop-top).
