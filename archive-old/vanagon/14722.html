&gt; &gt;Can anyone fax me a copy of the manual pages for

&gt; &gt;1985 vanagon Westphalia. Any tip sheets also appreciated.
&gt; 
&gt; At the shell prompt, type &quot;man coolant&quot; and see if that helps, or if
&gt; that doesn't work, try &quot;man -k coolant&quot; or if you're a Berkeley type,
&gt; try apropos coolant.

As far as I can tell, this is just some humor, right?  I imagine the 
Bentley manual does have such information, a unix shell will not.

Thanks anyway.
