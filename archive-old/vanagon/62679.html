Hi Volks,
    Just a quick reminder that next weekend 18th-20, I'm having a VW
campout in North Adams,Mass.  Its a good time, just ask Ric Golen and
Tom Forhan. There were a coule of other listmembers there too but their
names escape me right now.   Ric will be there again this year. (Tom has
other commitments)   We have a Potluck supper and this year we'll have a
catered pancake breakfast. Caravan, hiking, a canoe trip and lots of
stuff for the kids too.   This could be a good chance for an East coast
List member Camping get together.  If your interested please let me
know.  It only cost 16 per nite w/electic and water.  Take care.
