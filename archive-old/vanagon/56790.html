&gt; Has anyone ever installed Gene Berg's Short Shift Kit in a Syncro or 
&gt;       know if it's possible? I called and asked the folks at Gene Berg but 
&gt;       they didn't know. Maybe someone's tried it (?).

A while back I inquired on the list &amp; Joel Walker wrote:

what the kit is, is an aluminum plate, that you put under the metal plate
at the base of the shift lever. then you move the little collar that keeps
the shift spring on the shift lever itself (you must move the collar up
a little bit, to compensate for raising the plate).

this effectively shifts the fulcrum point of the shifting. so the upper
end of the shift lever doesn't move as far, while the bottom of the shift
lever (connected to the shift linkage) moves the same.

look on page 34.6 of the bentley: the Berg plate goes under the &quot;Gearshift
lever bearing housing&quot;. the collar is called &quot;bushing&quot;, and is kept in place
by the &quot;set screw (M5x8)&quot;. what berg does is move the set screw &quot;dimple&quot;
(that the set screw screws into on the lever) up the lever a bit.

now, notice the bushing over under the &quot;gearshift lever housing&quot;, to the
right of the middle of the page. and the &quot;shift rod, front&quot;. see the
peculiar design?? now, look on page 34.10 ... this is the Syncro shifter.
the &quot;shift rod, front&quot; and the bushing that connects to it are different
shapes. the &quot;gearshift lever bearing housing&quot; and the &quot;bushing&quot;/collar are
the same. but i don't know if the differences would make the shifter cause
any problems with the transmission.

i THINK the Berg plate would fit. but whether it would work as advertised,
i don't know (no knowledge of Syncro shifters). :(

... it might be worth $20 to find out?? ;)

I never did order the parts to find out.  Has anyone else?
