Subject: Now For The Best Lug Nuts!

People,

Thanks for the answers to Yellow Headlights :-) I am wised up now.
Having had a good time with that I will now go on to:

Every time the wheels have to come off my 91 Carat, 2 or 3 lugnuts lose
their chrome dress cap. The remaining steel nut holds the wheel on but
is is a truely ugly thing. I am tired of replacing them.

Is anyone using a one-piece, decent-looking chrome or stainless lug nut
on these Carat-type mags? I would love a set of these.
