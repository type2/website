Hi Tom,

I am potentially very interested in one of these heaters. Just a few 
questions, that others might want answers to as well(pardon me if they've 
been answered before):

-Are these heaters made specifically for automotive use?

-Is the fan adjustable or one-speed?

-Any specs on the current draw or propane use rate (per hour or whatever)?

-Is the &quot;mushroom cap&quot; mentioned in the archive included?

-What is the warrantee? I assume that we'd have to pay shipping back to
England... 


Thanks for your time and effort in putting this together,

Jon
