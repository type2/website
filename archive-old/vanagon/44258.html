Steve,

 Try Tri-City Paint on Miramar Road. The &quot;Ivory&quot; that they mixed for my 1980
Westy is an good match to the original paint. They sell auto body supplies for
pro shops and DIY. I paid about $15 for a quart. It was more than I needed. 
So I had them put the leftover into an aerosol can for $5. They were very
helpful guys.

&gt;The V6anagon has more than its share of paint dings, some recent,
&gt;some not. a few oldies have rust developing under them, which I'd
&gt;like to sand down and coat so they don't get out of hand.
&gt;
&gt;But my FLAPS doesn't have any paint shade that's even close to the
&gt;pale yellow/medium brown colors of the car, which I think (well, guess)
&gt;are original from 1980.
&gt;
&gt;Other than the dealer ($12 for a teensy bottle, special-ordered), does
&gt;anyone know of a place to get some touch-up paint that comes real close
&gt;to VW colors, give or take a little sun fading?
