Subject: Re: Mike Plicky's Air Flow Sensor


 -=&gt; Quoting vanagon_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu to Jack Reed &lt;=-

 va&gt; Just got the results back from the dealer concerning my van and it's
 va&gt; emission and idle problem.  It seems that the problem is with the air
 va&gt; flow sensor. The previous owner, or a mechanic got into the sensor and
 va&gt; caused some problems...why they broke into the box I don't know.  The
 va&gt; mechanic said that the computer and idle stabilizer were fine.  Does
 va&gt; anyone have a used air flow box for a 1986 and up Vanagon for sale?, or
 va&gt; know where i can get one??  I figured this would be the best place to
 va&gt; ask.  VW wants $450.00 for new one. ouch 

 va&gt; Thanks
 va&gt; Mike Plickys 1987 Syncro 

Send the numbers off the air flow meter, Mike, I have an older one that
may work.
