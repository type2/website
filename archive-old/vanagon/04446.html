&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; 	I'm still stumped on the starter problem.  I charged up the battery for
&gt; 2 days at 1 amp, and the lights are nice and bright, but the starter still
&gt; only makes groaning noises when I try to crank her over.  I'm on the
&gt; verge of yanking the motor out and replacing the bushing, but that seems
&gt; like a lot of work to do that little thing.  (I know how to yank the motor,
&gt; I'm just lazy.  I can do it in under 10 minutes when properly motivated)
&gt; 
&gt; 	Any last minute suggestions before I embark on this?  Am I barking up
&gt; the wrong tree?
&gt; 
&gt; 	I know its not the switch 'cause I jumped the wires manually with a
&gt; screwdriver to the same effect.  It just makes a loud chatter/groan.  Its
&gt; brand spankin' new, too!
&gt; 
&gt; 	Any help is always appreciated!
&gt; 
&gt; 	In other news, I am going to order the sunroof cover tomorrow.  I'm
&gt; going to go with plain black vinyl for now.  Maybe someday in the future 
&gt; I'll move up to canvas, but I don't feel I need it yet.  Stay tuned for
&gt; the upcoming saga!

I'm gonna be in your area this weekend... maybe we could do some trouble-
shooting on it?  I'd like to see your bus, anyway...
