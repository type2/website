Subject: RE: 87 Syncro - Cost of New Tranny??


Last Dec I replaced mine with a rebuilt unit from All German Transmission 
 in CA.  $2000 for the unit with a $400 refund for the core return of my 
broken unit.  If things are going bad, get a complete estimate first, such 
as clutch and linkage.  To increase longevity, maybe replace the tranny oil 
after the first 1000 mi on the new unit.

|Anyone ever do new trannys in their syncro.  Did you replace the syncro
|mechanism too.
|
|Is there preventive care to keep the old one goin.  I have not had any
|trouble as of yet, the differential lock works too.   But,  Since I have
|replaced just about every other part, I assume that this is the next to 
come.
|
|I guess, what the bottom line is, do I need to start saving now.
