Subject: Re: Screens and Wiper Fluid Pump (again!)

I Just tuned in to the thread ...

I had a gizmo on my SAAB (it was aftermarket, made in Sweden and sold by
the dealer) which was basically a heat exchanger you put in-line on the 
rad hose.   You cut a 3&quot; section out of the host, clamped this puppy in
place, reroute some hoses - instant hot washer fluid!

It was a heavy guage metal, copper clad and wound with copper tubing the
same ID as washer hose.  It worked great, and not only in the great
white north.  Hot fluid does a great job of dissolving all those
swamp bug guts in the south too ..

 &gt;
 &gt;While you are fooling around with the wiper fluid system, why not try and
 &gt;rig something up so that you get heated fluid on the windshield. Maybe
 &gt;connect to a length of coppper tubing and run that alongside the rad.
 &gt;What do you think?
