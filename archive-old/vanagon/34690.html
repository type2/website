	Hi All...

	Gotta ? that is VW related... just not Bus/Van related...
=09
	Did BRM ( those nifty Cal-look wheels) ever make a four bolt version =
for  post '68 cars...??

	I just looked at a '69 Karmann Ghia coupe today that I swore had BRM =
wheels on it.... the kid who had the car said he thought they were some =
kind of aftermarket 914 wheel.... had never seen anything like 'em =
before....

	BTW... I am buying the car, so don't ask where it is...   ;-&gt;


	if they are BRMs... they are worth more than what I'm paying for the =
car...

	also has anyone else ever seen a roof rack tent for an early '60s =
bus...
 	My Mom just found some pictures of my Grandfathers '60-'61 Kombi and =
it has this tent on the roof ; Wedge-shaped, with tall end at the rear =
of the bus, runs from rear of bus to about the middle of the side =
doors... looks to be about 3 1/2' at the rear and a foot or so at the =
front... square zippered door right over the rear wheel... ladder hooks =
on rain gutter and rests on tire ( it may store up under the roof =
rack...) it also has a custom made tent/room that is hung over the rear =
hatch door when hatch is open...	=09
	I vaguely remember sleeping in this tent when I was about 11-12 ( =
mid-late 60s...)

	Is this like a Rarest of the Rare for Buses....??

	Trying to get my B-in-L to scan it for me so I can post it on somesone  =
Homepage...
	Also have pictures of my Dad's '57 and Granddad's '59 Bugs camping =
together on the Gaspe' Peninsula in summer of '60... had a custom made =
tent that fit between the two bugs when sitting about 4' apart...
