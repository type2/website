&gt;There is no need to chastise yourself simply because you mis-read 
&gt;the original question. You were trying to be helpful.

I'll second that.  I didn't mean to chastise or quiet you, It just seemed
there was a misunderstanding that I wanted to clear up.  I'd encourage you to
continue to be helpful.
