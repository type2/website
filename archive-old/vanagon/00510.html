&gt; 
&gt; Can someone tell me a source for temp sensors that is close this price?  
&gt; I just called the dealer, and he wanted $40 for it.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Gerry

I don't have an answer to your question Gerry, but with all the discussion
on the sensor going bad, it sounds like a good idea to keep a spare in the
car along with the idle valve.
