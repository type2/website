Subject: Digital oil change record
Date: Mon, 28 Aug 95 8:34:13 PDT


Seems like every time I change my oil, I manage to mash my finger against
the sharp part of the engine when the oil plug loosens.  Leaves me with
a real nice record of oil changes on my hands.  I can sort of tell - by how
the scar has healed - how long it has been since the last oil change.

Sorry, I know its not Friday, but it happened to me on Friday.  (Oh, and 
this post applies to the blowers as well as the pumpers!!! :-)

Cheers,

Albrecht
