Subject: re: why we love out bricks so much

I love my brick so much because I sit up high and can see what is going
on.  I love shiny steel bumpers, the kind that say&quot;go ahead and cut me off
in your Korean Shit Box and die, maggot!&quot;  I love being in vechicular
control on a snowy day.  And the number one reason I love my '85 Vanagon
Westphaila Wolfsburg is:  Mini-vans suck.
