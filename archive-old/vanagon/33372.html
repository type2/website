Subject: Tires, EV troubles, dealers, warranties, La Push, idiot factors

Here I go bunching them up again:

Tires: the EV Camper uses UK-made Goodyears, load range &quot;C&quot;, pumped to 50 lbs.
They seem to ride fine, no traction complaints, we'll see how they wear.)
The Dunlops I put on the Vanagon camper were load range 'D', also pumped to
50 lbs, and they made an incredible difference in the handling and
stability of that vehicle.

EV troubles &amp; dealers: I continue to watch with baited breath. So far mine
is ok mechanically. Those cracks in the windshield-pillar paint (at the
weld joint) were repaired by the dealer, as were the other two paint cracks
I found in the base of each B pillar. I was concerned about corrosion at
these points and they repaired them without a hassle. They did need some
slight convincing that I was not an idiot when I told them the camper
battery had a dead cell - but when I brought it back the 2nd time and told
them that I had not only measured S.G. but also voltage they took another
look and promptly replaced it. I have one other glitch right now but I
can't make it repeat reliably yet - the power door locks sometimes don't
lock the sliding door until the 2nd time they're activated. The mechanism
goes its grinding, and I can see the lock button wiggle a bit, but it
doesn't go down. I talked to the dealer, and it wouldn't happen there (of
course) so I'll just continue to watch it.
These are all minor things, so far I'm extremely pleased with this vehicle.
(Although I did receive another extended warranty offer from VW in the mail
last week - anyone familiar with these?  Is there some catch of which I'm
not aware, like the way they define &quot;breakdown&quot; or something? )

La Push: I talked to someone out on the coast today, apparently they've
already started clearing the land for the 'resort' going in. It's
definitely on First Beach - in that big overgrown area at the south end of
the beach. (I was wondering how they were going to keep the resort visitors
from seeing the less-than-idyllic condition of the town of La Push - looks
like they won't have to won't even have to go into the town. It sounds like
the road that I used to use to gain vehicle access to the top of the beach
is already plowed under, but i'm not certain. The old campground remains
open, just not as nice a view from there. They may also be building up onto
the headland between First and Second Beach - if you know the area - its
not NPS land until the very top. I'd say that Second Beach isn't going to
be the isolated wonder that it used to be anymore either - and First Beach
is definitely toast.

Idiot Factors: I've done a couple, the most recent was breaking off the
spark plug in my Vanagon. Required a really big extractor to get that
sucker out. (That's the requisite VW content.)
Then there was the time in Pennsylvania that I left 30 weight oil in my 68
AMC Javelin and a cold snap hit. No engine block  heaters to be found
anywhere. Couldn't start the thing for 3 weeks at least.
But  my favorite (or at least the one my wife likes to remind me about
because she was there too) was when I replaced the fuel pump on my Chevy in
some Seattle parking lot, only to discover that it was actually just out of
gas.
