 Thanks for the comments. I guess my intent is to put together the best
 bus for Mexico/Central America travel:

 I took my '76 Camper down there several years ago and I would of really
 been deep in caca if I had needed any engine parts.

 However, parts for 1600cc powered buses can be found worldwide....

 Of course, a '71 Bus would be a mechanic's dream, but, alas, I've been
 spoiled by the royal comforts of my '77 camper... What to do ???

 This has to be possible since VW sold them that way in Europe and the UK. I
 have the Haynes manual for '68-*'79* 1600 cc buses but, unforrtuneatly most
 of the photos are of an early bus. Parts that would be required are engine
 mounts and rear hanger, the sheet metal to go between the 1600 engine and
 the late style engine bay and apron. The bell housing is different, but may
 not matter &lt;the type IV has bosses for the mounting bracket which isn't used
 in the 1600 scheme&gt;and the final drive in the gearbox is different for the
 1600 &lt;5.38 vs. 4.57&gt;. There may be more required, but this was all I could
 account for comparing the manuals.

 I would think that there are copious quantities of the required parts sitting
 in junkyards all over Europe and the UK. Some advertisers in VW T&amp;A and the 
 like appear to import used stuff from abroad, perhaps contacting one of them
 would provide some insight.

 I raised a similar question recently, though not in context of &quot;south of the
 border travel&quot; and the list consensus was &quot;Why?&quot;. Can anyone on the list 
 comment as to getting stuck in Mexico for lack of Type IV parts? Are there
 situations that a call to GEX won't solve &lt;they even have a Mexican phone #&gt;?

 New Mexican buses have water cooled engines, new Mexican bugs have fuel
 injection and catalytic converters. Most of the parts I get for my type IV
 come from Brazil - Is there really a problem travelling down there and 
 getting necessary repairs with a later bus or Vanagon?
