&gt;&gt;Chris,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;If you don't have the ignition timing scale (can't find my Haynes off hand
&gt;&gt;but in the Bentley manual I'm borrowing it is number 22 in figure 7-4 on
&gt;page
&gt;&gt;21 of chapter 5) on the fan housing a replacement was still available about
&gt;&gt;two years ago from VW.  I got mine from Capitol Imports in Columbus, Ohio
&gt;&gt;before I came up here in Jan 94.  It's black plastic instead of the
original
&gt;&gt;painted metal but it makes getting TDC and getting timed a LOT easier.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Hope this helps.

&gt;&gt;P.S.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;The canvas is the child cot that goes over the front seat.  Just not a very
&gt;&gt;big child.
&gt;
&gt;I called Burnsville VW this morning and that part is still available.  It is
&gt;part number 021-119-249E and it costs $3.25.

Chris,

Found the Haynes!  That part is in figures 7.1 and 8.2 in Chapter 3.  The one
in the pictures is the original painted metal.

Brad
