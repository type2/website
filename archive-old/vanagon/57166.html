Subject: Re: What do you keep in your bus? [F]


Surveyeth Coyote Lussier, on a Monday, in order to tempt the virtuous,
though we did not succumb:  ;)

&gt;Along the lines of the great &quot;What do you have in your Powerbook?&quot; ads, I'm
&gt;starting a &quot;What do you have in your bus?&quot; web page.  Send in your
&gt;submissions!  I'm going to illustrate this page with as many pictures as I
&gt;can find of the folks on the page, so if you have a picture of yourself
&gt;online, let me know where I can get it!


-- 300 pounds of tools &amp; spares. Including 4' &amp; 6' cheaters, 1/2 &amp; 3/4 flex
handles, 3/4 breaker, bench vise, about 250 yards of wire, and several
gallons of oil. Four jacks (floor, bottle, scissors, Bilstien). Two
manuals. Aircooled and willing to pay the price. So there you oozers. ;)

--.45 ACP and I don't care who knows it either.

--Two children's slippers, one winter jacket, crayons, a very small purple
sock, one Little Mermaid flip-flop, several shriveled fries, much crumpled
drawing paper, two little girls, one Mommy, one Daddy, and a vast amount of
love.
