Subject: RE: Popping 4th gears


I agree with the Tim Schlaile mantra . My dear old Dad used to frustrate me
when I was a know- it-all high school kid. ( and vice versa I'm sure!) He
would shift into forth gear before he hit 25-30 mph. I would get so mad! Now
a days i'd give anything to be able to just ride in the car with him and let
him drive any old way he wanted to.  =)


&gt;On the subject of the bungee corded shifters....I seem to recall this problem
&gt;in my '69 camper and I was told by someone who was a respected mechanic that
&gt;one reason for my tranny's early (&lt;&gt;100K miles) was that I did not get up
&gt;enough revs/speed for 4th gear. The manual says van must be going at least
&gt;35 MPH for 4th. I used that as a mantra from that day on and never had another
&gt;tranny die on me (yet) ....don't shift until 35...don't shift until 35...
&gt;it just so happens that 35 is the speed at which I could shift into 4th gear
&gt;without using the clutch.
