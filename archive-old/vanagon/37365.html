Subject: Should I buy '65 crew cab?

Hi All,

I found a 65 crew cab through the S.O.T.O newsletter earlier this month, and I
talked to the guy who owns it (a few hours away from me). Really nice guy,
loves the splittie, loves vans, and may have a hard time parting with it.

But, he did send me some pictures today, and the price seems right, and, and,
and... the problem is I feel like I should jump on it and just buy the damn
thing, but I worry about the time it may take to get the body into shape.

It's got *some* rust on the front driver's side door at the lower hinge (about
the size of a fist) and some rust-through along the lower side body panels. In
addition the side gates are not attached, and a previous owner has welded some
pipe on the sides to create a makeshift stake fence around the rear bed. Other
than that, it looks to be in pretty good shape.

My question is, given the brief above description, should I go for it? Or am I
going to regret the day I ever bought this thing because the rust damage is so
bad? Any general comments about restoring splitties would be appreciated as
well.

Fish or cut bait?,

Bren
