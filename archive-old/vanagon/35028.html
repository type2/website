Subject: Can someone tell me how to remove e-brake cable on '71?

I'm trying to adjust my spring plates to level the bus, but I need to remove
the emergency brake cable so I can move the bearing housing out of the way.
I've got the brake shoes off and the cable disconnected at both ends, but
what I really need help with is how to get the cable &quot;housing&quot; (the outer
part of the cable) detatched either from the backing plate or from the
metal tube it's connected to at the other end.  Bentley and Haynes don't
really show that part and I can't figure out how it's supposed to disconnect.
Thanks!
