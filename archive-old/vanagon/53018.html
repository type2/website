Subject: Re: 80 Vanagon Accelerator Cable Sticking


You have water in the cable.  Crawl under you van and trace the cable
back fron the front.

You'll find various couplings along the way that are just pieces of
tubing.  Most likely one has come off (use a hose clamp on it) and
you've been blowing water up in it as you drive.  I had to replace mine,
but you MAY be able to spray something in it to displace the water.

Go to a motocycle shop and get cable lube with a fitting to attach
to the cable ends and spray away.

 &gt;Hey folks,
 &gt;
 &gt;My acclerator cable is sticking when it is cold...Last year it never did
 &gt;this (even at -30F).  This year it does it at any point below freezing...
 &gt;
 &gt;How do I fix it?  Is there a lubricant that can be applied with cable still
 &gt;on the van?  Where is it most likely freezing up ?...
 &gt;
 &gt;Thanks,
 &gt;
 &gt;Mark
