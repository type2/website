Subject: Re: Midas or not

&gt;I used Midas for a catalytic converter on an '86 GL. In and out in &lt; 2 hr.
&gt;Cost: $220.00 vs. Dealer $900.00.  Catalytic is still working 3yr later ;)


yup same here, good job they did but the van sounds different now, weird.
Check their guarantee and make sure they cover everything.
