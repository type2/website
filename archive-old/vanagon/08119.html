Subject: European Car Mag Onto The List!

Yo Dudes! 

I received a letter back from the editor of european car magazine (VW &amp;
Porsche) stating that he'd like to be on the Vanagon list. His address is
EditBrown_at_aol_dot_com. Can you Joel or Gerry add him to the list or send him
e-mail telling him now to get added. 

Here is his message back to me:
