Subject: Amen, and Amen! Re: Gerry and new listserver.

        My grateful thanks to Gerry for his work on this mailing list. My
few weeks on have been a homecoming. I'll post the &quot;rest of the story&quot;,
when my deal is done! Kudos to a pioneer, and a toast to someone I've not
met but who has  enriched my life. And BTW (my first acro) thank you to
Gerry's significant others for allowing his time to this list!!!
&gt;
&gt; I caught your comments, re: mac and VW list.

Of course, in addition to being a VW fanatic, I'm also a Macintosh fanatic
- so why not get a cheap used Mac, run Macjordomo, set it in a corner and
not ever worry about the hardware?

Amen! Seems as if somebody would have an old CPU to donate, but nice and
new is also a tempting excursion. Currently I live in N. Ohio, but I'm to
travel to the Houston Area to visit my dad this June. Our project is to
rebuild a wreaked 91 Carat I recently purchased. Regards and Me 2! $$$
