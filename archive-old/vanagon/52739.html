Subject: Porsche engines in Vanagons

There was a thread a while ago, and I just found the brochure from
Martin Schneider.

He has a kit for this, minus the engine.

Syncro -- $1775, Regular -- $1695.
Bolt-in conversion for 3.2 Carrera engine, automatics need not dream.

He also has Vanagon brush guards (another thread) a while back for $179

He calls his Syncro Porsche Vanagons &quot;Brush Panzers&quot;

MSDS
(818) 453-8823  maybe, or (818) 448-8726 (both are listed...
