Subject: /f Uses for a Diesel Ease (TM)

Bought a new Interstate battery at the VW Dealer yesterday ($65) and 
the service manager threw in a diesel fuel preheater in the deal.  
They were cleaning out inventory and had some of these that had been 
around since Corn Flakes.  Wondering what to do with them, he said to 
another mechanic, &quot;Let's give one to Dan Houg, he'll make a still out 
of it or something.&quot; 

It is kinda cheapo looking and consists of a large diameter tube for 
coolant to flow thru and has a section of fuel line wrapped on the 
exterior of it to pre-warm the fuel.  The entire device is covered in 
closed cell foam for heat retention.  Plain hose barbs on all ends.

sooo.....  what to do, what to do.......

the thing is too short to get good heat transfer eg for shower water
heating.  it is too ugly for jewelry.  can't figure out any 
pyrotechnic angle for it.  might be dandy for keeping diesel fuel 
from gelling but otherwise i'm stumped.

ideas anyone?
