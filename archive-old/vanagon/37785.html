Subject: RE: Personalized License Plates


&gt;&gt;&gt;and the new one is
&gt;&gt;&gt;NFA 4295  (a &quot;stealth&quot; hippie plate so as to avoid a bit of hassle)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;In any list this size, no matter how intelligent and/or perceptive the
&gt;&gt;normal
&gt;&gt;clientele is, there's always someone who just doesn't get it.
&gt;&gt;In this case, I qualify without reservation.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;OK, what does NFA 4295 stand for?   &lt;hanging head in shame&gt;
&gt;
&gt;        Wait wait! I know I know!! &quot;Not Fade Away&quot;, April 2 1995. NFA is
&gt;the song, 4/2/95 is the date the Grateful Dead performed it.
&gt;
The bad joke from the Coen Brother's new film &quot;Fargo&quot; is:

Did you hear about the guy who was too poor for personalized plates?

He changed his name to 326 MRX.
