Ok Ok Ok...

jeez, talk about outing the lurkers, what with the weekly statz (&quot;sniveling
lurker&quot;) and now this plea...making us come clean here, huh?

so who is this lurker and what's he doing here?  well, i've been around for
a couple months! but really can't add a whole lot right now...been busless
for many moons.  i follow the digest, typically a day or two behind, though
lately about a week plus!  oh yeah--some of you know me from the quattro
list, and i've seen a few other names from another air-cooled german car
list that starts with &quot;p.&quot;  amazing how interests tend to parallel.  

i'll put myself in the &quot;wannabus&quot; category;  i'l  probably be there for
awhile.  i *think* i'm looking toward an early 80s westie into which i'll
transplant a certain german boxer-6 engine....aren't dreams fun?

as for history, i learned to drive a manual trannie on a '73 white on
orange-red type ii.  also learned to parallel park in that, but chickened
out on my driving test and used my mom's volvo.  i later &quot;stole&quot; the thing
from my dad and used it as my daily driver to hi school when he bought a '64
chevy p'up.  that was almost 20 years ago and i haven't had an a/c VW
since--bunch of w/c things instead:  Rabbits (2), Audis (3) including my
current quattro.  the folks also have a couple VW products (another Audi and
a Jetta).  the wife has a honda--oh well.

ok.  back to lurk mode.
