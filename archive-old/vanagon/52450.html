 In the case of air bags, the politicians just got the ball rolling, 
 with no regard for consequences. And, yes, VW could maybe supply a 
 &quot;safer&quot; airbag, as they apparently do already in Europe, but I 
 suspect that this &quot;safer&quot; (I'm only assuming it is) airbag does not 
 meet US specs, right? That's the ISSUE in my mind: stupid laws 
 enacted by stupid politicians. &gt;&gt;


  The above is correct.  Remember also that VW put  air bags in thier cars
due to consumer pressure.  Many people I know did not by the Jetta 3 hen it
first came out because it it the last car you could buy without airbags.  Had
people not purchased Chrysler products with the airbags, and ABS brakes,
 maybe they would not be so common place.
