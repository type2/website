Subject: Rear seat belt (Westy 85)

Hi,

This morning I had try to use an Envenflo car child seat (the type for the
older ones). Both rear seat belt of my Westy 85 are too short. My Jetta 91
have a fixed belt (like the one in left of my Westy), I was wondering if it
is possible to use this seatbelt (or another) to have a longer one. Any
input will help.

Thanks
