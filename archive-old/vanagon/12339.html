Subject: Re: FS: '85 VW Vanagon (fwd)



&gt; I have a 1985 VW Vanagon in pristine condition but for one small
&gt; problem--the engine.  ...text deleted...
&gt;
&gt; If interested, e-mail me at sjbarry_at_ucdavis_dot_edu, or call after 5:00 in 
&gt; Dixon, CA at (916) 678-5397.  
&gt; 

I just looked at this one.  I wouldn't call it &quot;pristine&quot;.  It has a few
dings, small dents, chips and scratches, mildew carpets, dirty cloth
seats, etc.  Minor body work, paint and a detail job would make it look
pristine.  Right now, though, I'd call it &quot;average for its age&quot;. 
Mechanically, it doesn't look too bad.  I would have bought it, except
that the body is barely better than the one on my '82.  Seems like a fair 
deal.
