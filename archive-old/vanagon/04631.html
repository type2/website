Subject: Solex Parts

Anyone know of a source for Solex parts other than what's contained in the
rebuild kits?  I recently rebuilt one and it was missing a spring when I took
it apart.  No one (including dealer) has the spring or even says they can
order it.  Although, I wonder what the dealer would do if they were repairing
the vehicle and needed the spring or other part of the carb.  Recommend a new
carb?  Maybe...

Doesn't make sense that you can't get individual parts for these carbs -- or
can you?  You tell me...

Thanks!
