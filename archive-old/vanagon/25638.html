Subject: Insurance Industry Regulation (was RE: BUSES, VALUE &amp; RESALE)

Public Citizen, in Washington DC, the group founded by Ralph Nader, is very
active in lobbying government to control insurance company rates, etc.  Many
states have their own chapters of this organization.

In Texas, it's called Texas Citizen Action, based in Austin and Ft. Worth.
They made a huge difference in the favor of consumers when Gov. Ann Richards
appointed the head of Texas Citizen Action to head the Texas Board of
Insurance.  Since newly-elected Gov. Shrub Bush has been in office, he's
appointed white males from the insurance industry to the Texas Board of
Insurance and fired the consumer advocate, resulting in much higher rates
for the general public.
