Subject:  76 van throttle sticky. 

Hello: I'm totally new to Volkswagon mainatainance, and have what I hope
       are two simple questions:

I have a 1976 VW van with seats (not the camper) with a 2000cc Fuel Injected
engine. The fellow I bought it off called it a Type II. Is this the correct
designation?

The throttle on my van is a bit sticky. It works fine except the first 
few times you push it down. It initially sticks and does not move. As you 
push harder it suddenly lets go, and moves down quite a bit. After the 
first few times per trip it is OK. It doesn't take a lot of force to overcome
the stickyness, but it is awkward on slippery roads in the winter as my minimum
throttle setting is too high after it releases, and depresses a bit. 
I think it scares the neighbours when they see a bright yellow van coming down
the road sideways at them;-)

Thanks Bill Crick
