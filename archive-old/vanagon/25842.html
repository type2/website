Subject: Re: PROBLEMS WITH A '72?

Stock carberation.  There is a religino that divides type1 and type4 
engines.  '72 is the first year of Type4 engines in a bus.  Other than 
the sucky umatching pair of carberators (good I can't speel that word) 
when we had on '72 camper (I as a kid) it was a great van.
