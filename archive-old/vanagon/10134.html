Subject: [W] The Drive to Dublin. W stands for waffle. 

I suppose that a report on yesterday's journey by the blue 
thing to Dublin might not be all that impressive, considering 
that it did the 350 miles without a single problem, and I 
missed running over a labrador (dog - not islander) by 
millimetres in a dump of a town called Roscrea.  The VW dealer 
in Roscrea is selling the garage, so if you want to invest, be 
my guest.

Anyway, the wipers were the best they have ever been, thanks to 
the suggestion to bend the arm.  The average cruising speed was 
between 70 and 80 mph.  Ever notice the way that a diesel 
loosens out after 50 or 60 miles?  And that it revs better with 
oil in the sump?  :)

My fuel consumption was 38.5mpg, with about 50 miles of city 
driving included.  (can't wait to read the replies to *that*!)

Apologies for the abstract post last night.  I was shattered, 
red-eyed and p*ssed-off when the mail was eaten by my own 
computer.

*** SUGGESTION : Would the collective noun for ourselves on the 
list be VANAGONDOLIERS?  Your input welcome ...
