&gt; &gt;The propane on/off knob on the outside of the van leaks propane

&gt; 
&gt; The same thing happened to my '85.  I went to a local Propane dealer and he
&gt; installed a generic non-VW valve on my tank for about $30, parts and labor,
&gt; including new gaskets.  This compared to threats of out-of-production parts
&gt; and/or price quotes in the hundreds (??!!) from local RV specialists and
&gt; the VW dealer
&gt; 
The '81 has a common ReGo valve on it same as a jillion 20lb grill
tanks out there, looks to be the stock valve.
