Subject: '81 2.0L in '73 westy no fit?

I just crawled out from under my van -- the '81 2 liter I'm putting in
it doesn't seem to fit. Oh, it goes in, the tran shaft meshes with the
clutch splines, etc. Then when I try to tighten up the four mounting
bolts, and it gets down to the last 1/2&quot;, something is binding. I've
done many a transplant -- but nothing with this new an engine. What it
reminds me of is when I tried to put a 1600cc in a 1200cc bug. The
flywheel was just a bit too big, and you had to grind out the inside
of the transaxle clutch housing --- is that what the problem is here?
Does anyone know if they made the flywheel bigger between the 1700cc
and the '81 2000cc??? I hate to pull it all out to look.
   Or is there some other difference I'm missing? Surely someone has
done this before. Please e-mail me as I read the list on the web.

All is impermanent -- but this too shall pass away, and the way of the
Samurai is death, so speak your mind now, or forever hold your peace.
 
The fundamental delusion of humanity is that I am in here, and you
are out there.
