From: &quot;Thom Fitzpatrick&quot; &lt;thom_at_tim_dot_com&gt;

&gt;Forty-eight states, ten provinces, three countries ... all in 31,153 miles,
&gt;127 days, and a 1995 Mercedes-Benz S320.  this guy buys a brand new $60,000
&gt;car and takes off on a four month trip!!!! not only that, but when he changes
&gt;the oil, he puts NEW oil and NEW filter, runs it 15 minutes, then changes the
&gt;oil and filter AGAIN!!!

Well, I change the oil twice whenever I buy a &quot;new&quot; car and I'm not
sure of its maintenance history.  I do the same for the tranny fluid...
