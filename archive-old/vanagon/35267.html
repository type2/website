Subject: Question on VIN info file....

When I subscribed to this list (maybe 6 mo. ago?), I found somewhere a
whole set of VIN info files that were compiled by Skip Montanaro.  In
the file for 68-79 buses, there is the following:

&gt;1979   Chassis Number 219-2000-001  -    219-2300-000
&gt;       Engine Number  GD-0-040-001  -
&gt;
&gt;       [... deleted ...]
&gt;
&gt;1)  Body made slightly wider (1.6 inches extra)
&gt;2)  Catalytic converter introduced into exhaust system

This has bothered me since the first time I read it.  How could VW
have made the body 1.6 inches wider, when they knew they would be
discontinuing this model the very next year?  It seems to me this
would have required new body panels for the front, rear, roof, floor
and engine deck, reengineering and retesting of the chassis, new rear
seat and headliner, possibly a new windshield, Westfalia would have
had to re-design their camper interior, etc. etc. etc.  Essentially a
whole respecification of the entire car.  Is this what was done, even
though the model was being discontinued a year later?

Or was it something more minor; maybe a new law changed the way VWoA
reported the width of the vehicle, and instead of measuring edge of
left air scoop to edge of right air scoop, they had to measure left
edge of bumper to right edge of bumper?  Or maybe they redesigned the
airscoops or bumpers, such that they stuck out 0.8 inches further on
each side?  Or maybe they changed the side door and opposite side body
panel, so that the *interior cargo space* is 1.6 inches wider?

Can anyone explain this claim about the extra 1.6 inches?

Thanks,
Rodney
