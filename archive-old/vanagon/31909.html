Subject: Re: '53 Deluxe for sale (fwd)

To All--
Yes, it's true. . . April is for sale. 

However, she is not the oldest and best preserved Deluxe, that honor goes 
to Mike Hornbecker's '52 with approximately 18, 000 miles.

I wasn't exactly serious when I told Greg Lambert I'd trade it for a 
EuroVan Camper. . . but in a way that's what I'm doing. I want to upgrade 
and expand the available campers in Roamin' Holiday (my VW camper rental 
biz based in Albuquerque and Phoenix), and I'm working on various angles 
of doing that. Selling the '53 is one way, and the most likely scenario.

The vehicle isn't perfect cosmetically. There are better restorations. 
But for age and completeness, it is one of the best. I also know it's 
history in fairly complete detail (originally sold and used in France as 
a school bus, for instance).

So, call for more info. (505) 255-6611

Tom B.
