Kyle;

The list has been receiving/posting it's usuall 50+/- messages per day.

The list hasn't expired, but it will be moving sometime next month. More
info will follow in the next week or so.

Have you seen the &quot;lists&quot; request for donations. As part of the move, we
will be purchasing some software/hardware to support the list at it's new
home. A computer system, operating system software, and Internet
connectivity have been donated.

Chris
