Subject: Wolfsburg in sheep's clothing

Over the past year I have been converting my 1985 Vanagon GL into a 
camping vehicle.

My goal was to be able to comfortably sleep in the van while camping.  
The result produces guilty feelings in me for being so 
comfortable, while my friends shiver in their tents sleeping on the 
cold ground.

Here's what I did:

First, I removed both back seats.  I built a platform out of 3/4 inch 
plywood in the center of the van which was extended the height of the 
engine compartment towards the front of the vehicle.  I then installed 
duct work allowing the rear heater to continue to be useful.  I also 
added a 200 watt amplifier and two 6X9 Pioneer speakers to the front of 
the platform - I'm a musician and must have good tunes!!  I covered the 
palatform, the rear interior panels and floor with new blue carpeting.

On top of the platform, I was able to put a queen size futon 
mattress(which is very comfortable I must say!).  I added curtains on 
the side and rear windows(which were already darkly tinted, as well as a 
set behind the from seats.  I added additional interior lights for late 
night reading, screens for the side windows and a roof rack.

Incidentally, I saw a friend who owns a 1983 Wolfsburg Edition and asked 
him what it was.  He began to explain its sleeping capabilities and 
showed me all of the accessories.  It seemed to be very close to what I 
created.  What I coincidence!

The whole job cost well under $750 and is the envy of my friends - 
especially my friend who sold it to me in the first place.
