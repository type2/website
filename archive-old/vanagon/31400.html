In a message dated 95-12-22 17:01:56 EST, you write:

&gt;The guy I talked to the longest claimed
&gt;that differences in length of rods tended to be so small that
&gt;only one deck height needs to be measured, likewise that there
&gt;is insignificant difference between head chamber sizes, and that
&gt;compression ratios will be within a hundredth for all cylinders.

Shea,

I strongly suggest you measure deck height yourself, and your chambers, and
then do the numbers for compression ratio.  While rod length may be very
close, the length of the rod is only one of several factors that make up deck
height.  Other factors are your crankcase, cylinders and pistons.  

Only factory-new cases, or those which have been 'decked' are the same
dimension from the center-line of the crankshaft to the top of the spigot
hole.  

Depending on the brand of cylinders you use, it isn't uncommon to find
variations of as much as sixty thou in cylinder height from the spigot ledge
to the top.  Cofap (Brazilian) are especially bad in this department.  Often
times you'll see a set in which the cast fins don't even line up, the mold
having been joggled out of alignment before the iron was cast.  When cast in
this manner, the cylinders are unusable since the 'kink' in the fins prevents
normal air-flow.  But when the cylinders are not of a uniform height, you can
turn the three longer ones to match the shortest, if you have a lathe.  Mahle
and NPR are very good in holding to a consistant cylinder length.  

Your pistons are usually very close to identical between  wrist-pin
centerline to piston-top... but not always. It's wise to check.  Use the
wrist pin as one surface, the head of the piston (upside down) as the other.
 You'll need a surface plate and surface gauge but the check takes only a few
seconds.  If the difference is more than ten thou, I usually take a light cut
across the face of the fat pistons.  Here again, you'll need access to a
lathe.

Having all of your parts uniform allows you to commence assembly with a known
base-line.  Even so, tolerance stack-up errors can lead to some surprises
which you will have to even out to achieve the smoothest running engine.

Quality of after-market VW parts varies wildly, and a high price is no
assurance of high quality.  It's best to check things out before you commence
assembly.

Anyone can assemble a Volkswagen engine but the difference between proper
assembly and the other kind is akin to the difference between night and day.
 Or winners and losers.  When it comes to proper engine assembly, details
count.

Trusting your rod length to establish deck height only works well with
mono-block engines, such as V8 or in-line four.  For aircraft and VW engines
-- those mating on the crankshaft centerline, it's always best to measure the
deck height of each individual cylinder.  The variations will surprise you.
