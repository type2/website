Subject: [A] FOR SALE 75-79 BUS Fuel Injection Parts
Date: 12 Apr 1994 06:27:07 GMT

I have the following lying around that could be very useful
to the right person...

All are used.  All are postage paid, $35.00 ea. (neg.if unreasonable).  New
prices are $175-350 each.  Although, there's no guarantee with used parts,
I've tested each.

(1) Brain (computer) from a 75 bus FUel Injected (I assume will fit 75-79)

(2) 1 Bosch Intake Air sensor rheostat thing (7 pin) will fit 76-79 busses

(3) 1 Bosch fuel pump. Electric, 35 p.s.i.  1 terminal re-soldered otherwise
excellant.

Other parts available: All for that same fuel injection system 75-79 busses
        thermo-time switch
        oil pressure switch
        fuel injectors (2)
        cold start valve

prices neg.
