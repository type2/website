&gt; &gt;&gt;But the problem with using a winch often involves where to attach the cable
&gt; &gt;&gt;rather than the winch.  Since the only real tree in Baja is busy shading the
&gt; &gt;&gt;plaza at San Ignacio, finding someplace to fasten the cable can stretch your
&gt; &gt;&gt;ingenuity to the snapping point.

&gt; &gt;The high lift jack is cheap and reliable and doesn't require 80-200 amps to 
&gt; &gt;work. Winch electrical hookup was enough to put me off the idea. 2nd 
&gt; &gt;battery, heavy wire everywhere, maybe a heavier alternator... Winching 
&gt; &gt;yourself out will drain a battery in short order. No fun if you can't start 
&gt; &gt;your van once you get back on solid ground. If you just want to get off 
&gt; &gt;slippery surfaces then a cheap block and tackle set, 1000lbs, 6 foot pull 
&gt; &gt;may suit. Packs away tightly also.
&gt; 
&gt; You guys are NO fun!! Don't you realize that a winch will only look macho
&gt; as long as everyone *believes* it's useful! 
&gt; 
&gt; Now I don't want no winch anymore... &lt;pout&gt;


I'm still thinking about a winch for the Thing, but probably not for the 
EV.  Yup, that Macho reason.  Goona put all the silly geegaws on it that 
the 'Off Road Pickups' do (not that most of them EVER leave asphalt - 
except to drive on concrete).
