Subject: Re: Syncro Driveshaft Universal Joints 

  They all insisted that this Vehicle has no universal joints.
&gt;Does anyone know of a suitable replacement or have a part #. VOA wants well
&gt;over $145- EACH. Ouch.
&gt;  
&gt; Several months ago(hmmm, maybe a year and several months ago) there was a
ad in Hot VWs magazine from Six States Distriubitors Inc. that advertised
that they had Syncro joints for $49 ea. I don't have time to look it up
right now but if you have some old issues look through the advertisers index
in the back you should be able to find the number. Six States have many
outlets and I don't know which store had the parts. Let me know if you can't
find them
