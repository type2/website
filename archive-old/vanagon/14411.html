Subject: Re: Need Information about Eurovan(s)

In reply to Mantis' querry whether the EV is a sell out to minivans...

Its obvious you have never driven or probably even seen a EuroVan...
they handle better, have just as much interior room (if not more
as far as cubic feet), and more power....

Sell out indeed!
