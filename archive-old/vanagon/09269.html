Subject: Caravan to Pfeifer/Big Sur? 

	I just got off the phone with Tobin Copley, who's down from B.C.
and wondering of there is going to be a caravan of busses, and bus people,
going to the camp-out this weekend.
	Sounds like a good idea to me but there's no way I can get
away early. Tobin's talking about leaving Palo Alto around 1:00-2:00pm
on Friday. (Shoot- they'll get there before dark!)

	So, 1) Anyone wanting to caravan, at 55 mph, note, with Tobin,
give him a call at Martha's where they're staying. You can't reach him
via email because he's not at home, and Martha's server is gone unless you
use her alias: Andrea2_at_aol_dot_com

	2) I'd like to connect with someone who's going to the camp-out
earlier than I and give them the groceries I'm contributing so they arrive
in time. I'm contributing salad and bread, as well as fish for the
chowder, so whomever carries it just has to shake up the dressing and 
pour it out- easy stuff. Nothing worse than the guy bringing the salad 
being late!

Tobin can be best reached at Martha's phone # (510)376-4321

I can be reached at work: 408 451 3278, or occasionally home, 408 374 8073
