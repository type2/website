Joel:
Very interesting information, Thanks!

It's humorous now but I have a more complete picture of my dealer's
motivation.

I had a '91 Vanagon and several times it sprang fule leaks. I even had it
towed back to the dealer from a significant distance (I was surprised that
the dealer offered and paid for the towing). Even though I thought I
was out of the warranty period, the dealer made the repairs and it cost me
nothing, each time.

Finally the dealer pulled the engine and re-configured the entire engine
compartment. When I had one more fuel leak, the dealer was &quot;eager&quot; to have
me consider a trade-in for my present 'toy'.

  Quality is no guarantee of success, to do nothing is to guarantee failure!
