Subject: Re: 73 Westy into California...how hard?

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;The vehicle in question is a 73 Westy with a  currently non functionning
&gt;&gt;air pump and blocked off EGR.
&gt;&gt;

I brought my 73 super beast from Ohio 13 years ago to the San Francisco Bay
Area. I had no difficulty getting it smogged and registered. I don't remember
if I was charged any smog impact fee (probably not). But the car was very
carefully inspected by DMV. They verified if my car was the original one
(not a stolen one trying to register under a name of a dead one from a junk
yard from Ohio). I did have all original smog devices in the car. Well,
actually there was none. The 73 SUPER BEAST did not have EGR nor air pump,
nothing... There wasn't anything special in terms of smog requirement.

But, it had an air conditioner. Yes, it had a small condensor behind
the little grill under the front bumper. It had a heat exchanger under the
front winshield and a compressor at the rear left corner of the engine.
I tried many times to charged it with CFC and it did heat up my engine
and blew &quot;cool&quot; air inside the car. Honestly, just felt &quot;cool&quot; but not
actually cool. It did almost cooked the engine instead. Anyway, should not
have sold it.
