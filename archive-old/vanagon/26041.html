&gt; And no smart remarks from water-pumper drivers and Floridians, ok?  That
&gt; coolant leak is your penance for your smart mouth.

us?  talk smart?  moi?

maybe you could get even greater heat by just running the exhaust 
into the cabin, that way you guys could claim almost 100% efficient 
utilization of the energy and heat in the gasoline.  might be as 
noisy as your fan tho...

:)

================
What?  Usn's out here in northern Ca, suffering a heat wave, where rare winter
temperatures are below 40 deg. F -  make smart comments - heaven forbid!  

Maybe if you rigged a recirculating pump to pour water over the jugs and pump
it into the cabin through some kinda heat exchanger and then back over the
jugs??     :-)
