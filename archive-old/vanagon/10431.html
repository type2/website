Subject:       thanks for compression data

Thanks to all for the discussion on compression.  After I posted that 
message I realized that on the back cover of the green Bently manual 
it had the factory specs-- sorry.  BUT it was very useful to me to 
see what some of the other 2.1L in good shape were running (ie 140 
psi).  
 
We'll see how this '87 checks out on Tuesday...  ya know, one's mind 
conjures up visions of this near perfect van with a dry underside, I 
can't stand the wait.
