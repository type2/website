Subject: 5/19 VW Caravan to Michigan Vintage Show


Hey there everyone,

	the Michigan Vintage VW Club is hosting its annual show in Auburn 
Hills, MI at the VWUS headquarters this Sunday, May 19.  Folks in the Ann 
Arbor/Plymouth areas will becaravanning to the show.  If you're in the 
area, come join us!

	Here's the scoop:  the caravan will begin at 7:30am on Sunday at 
Arborland Mall in Ann Arbor.  Arborland is located smack-dab at exit 37B 
of US23.  Meet right at the base of the giant Arborland time/temperature 
sign.  You can't miss it.

	Next stop:  pick up the Plymouth folks.  They'll be waiting for 
us at the Sheldon Rd. exit of M14.  Just take the (long) exit ramp, go 
straight through the light (when it's green:) and you'll see the VWs 
right there in the parking lot of the Sheldon Rd. Ford plant.  Target 
time for the Sheldon Rd. pit stop is 8am.  We'll then go directly to 
Auburn Hills, arriving promptly for the 9am show start time.

	See you Sunday!  Drop me a line if you have any questions or need 
better directions.  You can also find info on the following web page:
