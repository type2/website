On starting a stored air-cooled engine...there are several precautions you
can take: prior to storage remove plugs and fill  each plug with
storage oil (CDN Tire has this) and periodically hand crank the engine
over a few times. Come spring it will take a few tries befoe the oil is
flushed out (this is very light weight oil that finds it way past the
rings) but you will still need to change the oil after you have run the
engine for 15 minutes or so; putting stabilizer and/or gas line
antifreeze also helps ensure no moisture gets through into the fuel lines
(could be a big problem with FI systems). The battery should be stored
inside if it is not fully charged. I usually spray all components in the
engine compartment with WD 40 or Rust check...


You should probably put gas stab and gas line antifreeze  in your tank now so
as to avoid a major problem at start up. Water in the FI system can be
destructive.. .

If you haven't taken any of these precautions and have not been turning
the engine over periodically (ie once  week or so) here is what I would do:
hand crank the engine over a few times. Do not remove the plugs from
the distributor and turn the engine over that way; it could effect the
ignition system. This should be sufficient to lubricate the system. Make
sure the battery is fully charged and at its highest capacity. You will
need the power to over come a) corrosion on all of the terminals and b) to
turn over the thick oil...

The engine should start but just in case &quot;starter fluid&quot; might help...
though I have never used it in an FI system...


Two things to keep in mind: corrosion/resistance does build up over the
months on many of the electrical terminals, so you may find that ie your
wipers or lights don't work initially; usually a scraping clean of the
fuses helps a lot. Also keep an eye out for any animals that have set up
shop  around and about.


We have had our Westy on the road for almost 5 days since its &quot;coming
out&quot;. No problems and since the oil is synthetic and has only been in
there for less than 500 miles, it won't be necessary to change it immediately
as I would normally do for dino oil after a long storage and short
periodic start-ups in cold weather....DC
