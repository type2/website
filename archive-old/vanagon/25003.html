Subject: [Q] Mail order sources for Redline MTL gear oil?

Mail order sources for Redline MTL gear oil?

Can someone please give me the name and address (or fax#, email 1-800,
whatever you have) of mail order sources for Redline gear oils?

I changed my gear oil a few months ago. I called around to just about
every auto parts store in the ROchester area, and none had Redline MTL.
Neither did they have any good quality 75W/80W GL-4 weight oil.
I ended up putting in Valvoline GL4-5 oil, but I wanted to change
again to the real stuff now, before it gets cold again. So please
someone help me with find a Redline source.

PS The original oil (from '82) I replaced still looked pretty ok,
and level was right too. (But seemed stupid to put it back) Buying 
the VW gear oil would completely kill my (poor grad student) bank 
account though. The dealer wanted something like $50/l. Never seen 
any oil near that price before!
