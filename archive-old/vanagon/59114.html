Subject: Wanted: Syncro Owners manual

Hey, All-
I bought an '86 Syncro GL recently (I, like most of you, love it) and I need
the Syncro owners manual as it came with only the standard Vanagon manual. I
want to refer to the sections regarding the Diff locking switch and all the
fluid amounts &amp; changing procedures. Also does any one have bumper ends-front
and rear, for this beast?
