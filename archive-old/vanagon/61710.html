Subject: Fuzzy Gasket

Hi Listees:
            I'm looking for the 'fuzzy gasket' that goes between the 
drivers (or passengers) door and the door post. I assume that it is for 
the heat or air transfer from rear to front. This is for an 86 Westy.

Thanks if you can help, or even if you can't. You are all the greatest 
and am learning a bunch..........
