Subject: RE: Vanagon with Porsche power.

The kit from Martin Schneider Designed Systems (for mounting a 911 six in
a Vanagon) comes with pieces for use of the stock 4speed or the Porsche G50

5-speed, at purchaser's option.  100mph with the stock 4speed must be about
6000 rpm.   Doable, but I'd be scared.
