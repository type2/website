&gt;         As I will be getting new tires for the front next week I just
&gt; wondered if anyone knew anything about the Michelin Kevlers? The are on
&gt; sale right now at Tire Warehouse here in Edmonton for $69.00/each
&gt; (installed and balanced), and were regularly $108. It seems like a great
&gt; deal , and they have them in my (or should I say 'our' size which is 185 R
&gt; 14).
&gt; 
&gt;         And if anyone can suggest something equally good yet still
&gt; relatively inexpensive I would be much obliged. I do realize that my life
&gt; is riding on these things, but at the same time I only have a certain
&gt; amount of money to spend. Its kinda like how I buy generic Noodles and
&gt; Cheese instead of the good Kraft stuff.  :)

Never heard of these, but if they are really a 185R14 meaning 
reinforced, and the weight rating is 1400lbs or more, then it's 
probably not a bad deal, since they're Michelin. Check the max. psi 
rating though - it should be 40 psi at least. 
 
Incidentally, I rotated my Yoko Y370s to the rear &amp; put the Conti 
TS750s on the front, which confirmed my suspicions: the Conti's are 
junk. They are *way* too soft, even on the front at 42psi. And 
judging by the number of rock cuts in them, I'll be replacing them 
soon with 2 more Yokos.
