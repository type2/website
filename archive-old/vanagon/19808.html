Yes - assuming we are talking the totally manual mirrors of the vanagon.

The mirror mounts to the body with two phillips head screws, remove them and
the mirror.  There is a plastic or rubber pad between the body and mirror
&quot;footing&quot;, if you lift it off and look &quot;into&quot; the mirror footing, you will see
a 10mm nut (can't swear to the size).  This nut compresses a spring that
supplies tension between the socket of the &quot;footing&quot; and the ball of the
mirror.  By now there may be some white kind of corrosion residue, you may
want to remove the nut first, clean things up, apply a thin film of lube (keep
it from getting to the ball/socket interface!!) and re-assemble.  How tightly
you torque the nut will determine how freely  the mirror moves onece
reinstalled.
