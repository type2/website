Subject:      Re: bolts for Vanagon centre seats

&gt;The van is new to me and i took delivery of the van without centre seat,
&gt;subsequently got the seat from the ex-wife, sans the 4? bolts that hold the
&gt;seat to the chasiss.  The guide holes are in place and are positioned OK.
&gt;Does anyone know what the thread and the presumably metric size is ?

i measured mine: they are 8mm x 1.25 pitch thread. they have an &quot;8&quot; strength
rating stamped in the top of the bolt.

hope it helps. :)
