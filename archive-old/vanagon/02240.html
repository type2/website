&gt; If we go with an agenda (which being a free country people can choose to
&gt; ignore in part/whole) i think the first item of business is to propose a 
&gt; maximum miles per day figure. If we stay at about 400 miles/day, if someone
&gt; wants to do a side trip and then catch up they wont end up dead doing it.
&gt; Maybe break each day into at least two legs (more if there's more to see)
&gt; with a destination in mind for a late dinner time - then sing/dance/sleep
&gt; as you fancy.
&gt; Thelast time i did this was eight years ago (Ithaca NY to LA via south, up
&gt; West coast and across the plains and midwest back home) i remember 12
&gt; hours a day driving got very old day after day....

My current plan goes something like this:  Drive 300-500 miles in a day,
stop for 2 days, repeat.  I have a route semi-planned out, so far I'm up
to about 18 stopping points (about 8 weeks worth).  I will be mailing it
out soon to those on my &quot;interested&quot; list.  If you want to get on this list,
please e-mail me privately!

&gt; More babbling - if we want to stuck togethr, i think bricks (thx steve) will
&gt; need to drink first, followed by loafs and owls. With at least two legs a day
&gt; there is a natural drinking time so that would keep us together. (Diesel
&gt; bricks cruise all day on a single tank just to wet my whistle  btw)

Speaking of the driving portions, I was thinking about the *order* in which
we should drive.  I think we should go approximately in order of age, oldest
first.  Partly it's a matter of honor (the elders should be the leaders,
right?) and partly it's a matter of holding down the pace to that of the
slowest few members, which I assume would be the older busses (no offense :)).
Besides, when a brick needs to drink, they can just zoom up to the front of
the line and lead everyone off the highway, right?  

&gt; I would write more logistics stuff but martha will smash my fragile
&gt; psyche with more posts about &quot;cutting the knots out of wood so they dont
&gt; stare at you ...&quot; (no i dont, i paint closed eyelids on them)

I would write more stuff too, but I am supposed to be sending that stuff
out to the interested parties privately, and I already said too much here...
