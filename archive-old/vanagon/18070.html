&gt;Subject: Rebuilding Heads?
&gt;Hello all. Jiust found out about this group, and hope you can help.
&gt;I have an '81 Vanagon air-cooled with a 2000cc engine. She has 143,000
&gt;miles on it and is in need of an engine rebuild. Does anyone
&gt;know who still rebuilds VW (411) heads? As far as I know of, no one
&gt;in the Cleveland area does this anymore. Lisa
&gt;

Lisa, welcome to the world of headaches, not that I want to depress you, but 
I am a realist.   If you want to be in the Vanagon subculture, you must be 
prepared to be give constant attention to your Vanagon ---especially with the 
miles it has on it. You must be rich in order to be able to afford supporting 
a mechanic and his/her family or be a mechanic yourself.

I own an 82 Westy with 141K miles.  I have the exact same problem you have. 
At 101K I installed new rings, fixed the oil leak and I replaced both heads 
with 1 rebuilt and 1 new....   The rebuilt lasted 500 miles and now I have 
just learned that my new head lasted only 40K miles. I might have caused the 
new head to fail myself because I was using synthetic oil and I have recently 
heard that synthetic oil is not good for Vanagons. The new heads that I 
bought were made in Spain and cost 325.00 each but now I want to find a new 
head made in Germany ----if I can.

If I were you I would look in the VW magazines and mail order a long block  
engine from GTX  ----I did for my 68 Bus 10 years ago and was pleased.  And 
they give a worthwhile gauruntee --- unlike all machine shops that rebuild 
heads and even new heads don't come gaurunteed.

Have fun ---I've got to go to the dentist.
