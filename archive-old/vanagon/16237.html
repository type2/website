&gt; I believe your bus could be a Sportsmobile conversion out of Andrews, Indiana
&gt; (like mine!) or possibly an Adventurer High Roof out of California.  I know
&gt; Sportsmobile is still in business doing conversion vans (Fords and Chevys -
&gt; yuck!), but I'm not sure about Adventurer.  I have a Sportsmobile camper that
&gt; I put Adventurer cabinets in, so they both sound familiar!

Just thought I would mention one thing that might help.  The Safare has a
unique (as far as I have seen) folding bed arrangement.  Instead of a
bench across the rear that slides out into a bed, the Safare has two
small permanent benches on either side over the wheelwells, and the bed
is a U-shaped contraption with two piano hinges that folds out and lays
on the seats.  I really like this setup because you can leave your
bedding in place and just fold the bed over on itself.  Takes about 10
seconds to put the bed away in the morning, and another 10 seconds to
set it up at night.

Here's a really bad ascii of the bed arrangement (side view)

B = pillow
Q = mattress
