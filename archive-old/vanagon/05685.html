Subject: replacing all cooling hoses


Hi,

For my '83 Vanagon, I like to replace all its cooling system hoses.
Besides the cost of dealer hoses bing ~$900, the sections sandwiched
between frame and fueltank are hard to get out and IMPOSSIBLE to insert
the new ones in. Have you done a total hose replacement? What are those
&quot;be aware&quot; things? How did you handle the hoses over the fueltank? (Did
you remove the fuel tank? I prefer not to do any work with fueltank.)
Any advices are greatly appreciated!

Regards,
James
