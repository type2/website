&gt;    You can pick up a hammer operated &quot;impact driver&quot; at most flea markets or

&gt; I've used them plenty on the case screws on motorcycles over the years.  It
&gt; might even save a screw that allready a little stripped.  Good luck.

And, I find that when trying to unscrew a tough one, it hlep to give the 
impact screwdriver a whack in the tightening direction.  Then put the 
impact driver back on unscewing direction.  I think it has something to 
do with Murphy's law.
