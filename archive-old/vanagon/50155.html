&gt; I'm looking for push rod tubes that can be fitted to my '87  
Vangon's 2.1 l
&gt; engine without removing the heads.  West Coast Metric has them  
but wants
&gt; $45.00 each for them.  Is there a cheaper source for these spring  
loaded
&gt; colapsable push rod tubes ?  Preferably somewhere in Canada or  
someone who
&gt; will ship them to Canada.

I am not sure about the 2.1L, but I just purchased a set of 4 from  
N&amp;D Automotive in Mississauga for our 84.  These were collapsible,  
but not spring loaded.  I believe each was about Cdn$35 including  
seals (which are very expensive).  BTW, N&amp;D carries a lot of good  
stuff at very reasonable prices, i.e., Mann filters, Conti belts,  
etc.

Cheers,
