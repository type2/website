Subject: Wanted: Westfalia Camper Van 1988-1994

 Please give an e-mail to me if you have a Westy for sale.  I am willing
 to travel to look at a good deal.  If you have info on prices in Europe
 please provide.  I am planing to export the van to Europe for a one
 year tour.  I have been told this is the cheapest way to get the van vs
 buying in Europe.
