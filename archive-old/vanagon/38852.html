Hi Jeff

The best kind of oil you can use is fresh oil.  The weight depends
on where in the world you live.  If it's consistently below freezing
all year, I wouldn't recommend 40 weight.  If it's always warm, don't
go with anything too light.

I use straight 30 weight in my Bug.  What's important is that you
change the oil often.  Your Bug (I'm assuming it's stock, no increased
oil capacity) has a small capacity for oil, and no filter, so you
will want to keep it clean.

&gt; Hi.  I just rebuilt my '71 bug engine and am ready to fill her
&gt; up w/ oil.  I was wondering if I could get any input on what the
&gt; best kind of oil to get is.  I am thinking synthetic, but don't think
&gt; I can afford it.  Is that synthetic/natural blend any good for air
&gt; cooled engines?  If I go w/ natural, what weight should I get?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt;
