Subject: sliding door vent window
Date: Thu, 08 Feb 1996 13:59:56 EST

OK,
	I guess this is my first official posting to the list seeking
	help regarding a bus that I OWN now :) .  OK, this is a '78 bus
	and the lower pivot for the sliding door vent window has rotted
	away and is now nonexistent.  This means that I must replace
	something.  Bentley says how to get it out and in so that's not
	the problem.  I'm wondering if I have to buy a whole new frame
	or if the frame is in pieces and I could buy the bottom piece
	separately?  Is the frame readily available from a FLAPS or
	maybe a FLforeignAPS (I have a good one at home in Tennessee) or
	is this more than likely to be a junkyard item?  Prolly junkyard
	if I can find one in good shape.  Also, has anyone else had to
	remove that window?  Is it as easy as it looks? (I know, it's
	never as easy as it looks, but just checking.)  Hints,
	suggestions, ideas???

	Thanks,
	Sean
