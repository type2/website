&gt;On Fri, 8 Dec 1995, Maher, Steve (SD-MS) wrote about a cheap pair of rear
&gt;struts for the Vanagon.
&gt;
&gt;I was looking at the rear hatch of a friends old Volvo station wagon the
&gt;other day and noticed that the left 'strut' was simply a tube within a
&gt;tube combined with a simple mechanical latch/lock.  The right side had a
&gt;regular gas? strut.  This seems like the way to go to avoid replacing
&gt;them once a year.
&gt;
&gt;I doubt if the volvo mechanical strut will fit, but I'll check.  If not
&gt;it should be possible to fabricate one - possibly using an old worn out
&gt;strut.
&gt;

&gt;'80 Vanagon, struts still work
&gt;

Big A Auto parts sells Strong Arm brand lifts for all the Vanagons at about
$25 each.  They work great.  Is that cheap enough?
