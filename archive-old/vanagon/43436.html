&gt;I'm installing oil pressure and temp gauges and need to get one more gauge 
&gt;to fill a 3-gauge cluster. What's the most useful/interesting gauge to have 
&gt;after oil pressure and temperature?

A Voltmeter.  This is extremely usefull foir monitoring the electrical
system.  If the voltage is good, the alternator is doing its job.  Can laso
be used to monitor battery condition during starting.
