It's most likely an &quot;Adventurewagen,&quot; made by Adventurewagen, Inc., in Fort
Bragg, CA.  Although the company is still in business, the owners switched
to Fords after the introduction of the Eurovan.  The company has
historically acted as an informal broker for used vehicles, so if you are
interested in the Vanagon conversion you might give Ed Andersen there a
call.  There is also a basic web site - I don't have the URL handy, but
searching under the company name will get you there easily.

The fiberglass top adds 18&quot; to the van height, for an approximate height of
8.'  The fact that I, at 6'1&quot;, can stand up inside, is the envy of my
Westie-owning friends.

&gt; Hey all,
&gt; Today while driving by the local VW dealer I saw a Vanagon sitting in the
&gt; lot apparently awaiting servicing.  Why anyone would take it to the
dealer
&gt; is beyond me, but that's another story :) .  This Vanagon was an
air-cooled
&gt; model and had a non-Westfalia camper coversion.  It had a white fiberglas
&gt; roof similar to the roof on David Schwarze's Safare camper, with the
&gt; sliding windows on the sides of the high-roof.  The camper was beige and
&gt; the roof was white, looked like it added a couple feet to the van. 
Anyone
&gt; know what company made this type of conversion for Vanagons?  Could it
have
&gt; been a Safare?  
&gt; 
&gt; I've not seen this one around town before, thought it was kinda
interesting
&gt; :)
&gt;
