Responding to David Carment's message ....

There have been times that I WAS in that &quot;permanently 'on the road' &quot; 
category. Something in my mind about the law, pride, ego and stupidity did 
not permit me to consider buying a vehicle and &quot;camping out&quot; on the street 
(some of the places I did, however, were much worse).

It's strange, that almost as soon as I decided to make lemonade out the 
lemons I was being handed in life, things began to change!

As I was able to get back in school and become more self-sufficient, 
getting a car and &quot;getting away&quot; from my daily environment was a relief and 
high priority. There were restrictions from time-to-time, mostly money, 
that prevented visiting some places.

With cooperation and an adventurous spirit of my mate, we took off on a few 
trips with full knowledge that we had just enough money for gas, tolls and 
maybe to recover from a minor emergency. There would be just enough to get 
there and back! Definitely, there was no money for a hotel/motel/KOA (not 
even a cheap one)!

We spent many in highway rest areas (some with hourly restrictions - no 
hassle from the law). We spent time in truck stops (met some really 
wonderful people and took strange showers). We visited YMCAs &amp; YWCAs for 
showers and comfort facilties. We visited 'kitchens' and shelters for some 
meals. In one instance, even pretended to be arriving early for position 
interviews and were allowed to use the employee facilities to 'freshen up'.

Now that we have gotten to where we can &quot;pretend&quot; to afford better, we try 
little things at least once during our road trips, just for the fun of it.

We don't forget that there are people out there who may not have the 
OPTION. We try to look for signs of them and make an effort to offer a bit 
of comfort and assistance, if it does not seem to be infringing on their 
pride, dignity and privacy.

Wish all of you would take that kindly into consideration and sometimes 
extend a helping hand just because ...

A helping hand can make sunshine on a very cloudy day.
