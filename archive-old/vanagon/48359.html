Subject: Valve failure on T3 watercooled

I have just bought a Type 3 VW Transporter-based camper, and I
have just read in Motorhome Monthly Magazine that the valves on
this type of vehicle are made in 2 pieces, and it is common for
them to fail at around 50,000 miles. The contributor to the
magazine recommended chaning them before 50,000 miles to prevent
serious engine damage.

Is this true?  My van is 1989 1.9 watercooled.
