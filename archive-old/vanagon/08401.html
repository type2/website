Subject: Fuel line replacement
Date: Mon, 19 Dec 1994 09:47:30 -0600 (CST)

I have replaced all of the fuel lines on my 71 bus that I can see.  
There is a metal line running from the fire wall in the front (FIF) of
the motor and I replaced everything from there back.  Bentley mentions
something about how this metal line is hooked to the tank by a 
flexible line.  I think this was right.  There were no pictures or 
description here or in Muir.  I would think one or both of these books
should have a detailed description on how to replace all your fuel 
lines.  So, is there one in there that I missed and how do I get to 
it?  Oh, just a FYI.  I ordered the 801 series and a catalog from Berg 
last week.  The woman on the phone said $30.94, the receipt in the 
package said $30.94.  My Visa was charged $30.94 plus the $5.70 
shipping.  I don't have a problem paying this but was a little miffed 
that I was never told about it.  Is this a common occurance from them 
or a one time goof?  TIA for any help with my fuel lines, Jim.
