&gt; What other neat camping toys does anyone know about?

&gt; If not toys meant for camping, how about a list of things you all
&gt; throw in when traveling - things not necessarily related to
&gt; camping, or to car parts/tools, etc., but which just make life
&gt; easier?

&gt; s-hooks
&gt; butane hair curler
&gt; solar AA battery recharger
&gt; inflatable pillow
&gt; bicycle pump
&gt; binoculars
&gt; magnesium flint
&gt; candles
&gt; collapsable sterno stove
&gt; credit-card-sized solar calculator

Woodall's Campground Guide
15' Grumman Canoe
PFD's (Personal Floatation Devices)
Paddles
&quot;Nature Bound&quot; Field Guide (tells what plants are edible and what are
poisonous)
Extra motor oil
Chainsaw oil
A good-sized axe
Extra pliers, screwdrivers, and rags
Rhubarb Pie
...
