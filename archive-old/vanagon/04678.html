&gt; before you go on a trip, get a GOOD lug wrench and TRY IT OUT! that is, take
&gt; at least one wheel OFF the car with it. test it out. and make SURE that you
&gt; can loosen and tighten ALL the lugs on ALL the wheels. and, if you can do it,
&gt; NEVER EVER let those idiots at tire stores or anywhere use an impact wrench
&gt; on your lug nuts.   otherwise, you will be sadder but wiser, like Mike and
&gt; me. :(
&gt;
&gt; i have a lug wrench that i have found to be exceptionally easy to use and
&gt; well made. it's by Votex and i got it at my vw dealer in atlanta for about
&gt; $15 (probably up to $20 by now). it has an extendible handle so you don't
&gt; have to grunt and groan with little short handles, and it is L-shaped, so
&gt; you don't have those X-arms trying to bruise your family jewels. if anybody
&gt; wants more info, let me know and i'll post the model number and the phone
&gt; number of the dealer. i don't know if anybody else sells these things (never
&gt; seen them in Beverly Hills or other catalogs).

I make it a habit to remove the lug nuts and tighten them myself at home so
that it would be easier to remove if on the side of the road.  Instead of a
lug wrench I carry a 1/2 inch breaker bar and a metric impact socket.
This works fine for me.  I have broken regular sockets trying to remove tight
lug nuts.  Also keep on hand some spare lug nuts and bolts.  I have broken
those when taking them off.  I came up with these ideas from autocrossing
where I change four tires with a windup jack in 20 minutes.
