Joel and others,
What really gets me is why would VW risk their future and reputation to
steal car designs and and other sensitive information from a sh*t
company like GM??  Why would VW want to lower their standards?  Maybe
they figured their new cars lasted too long.  Maybe they wanted them to
break down more often and wear out more quickly just like those GM cars.

I don't get it, but if VW loses this suit and has to pay GM billions of
dollars, I fear what will happen to VW.  Bankruptcy?  Man, and we think
it's hard and expensive to get parts now!  Imagine if VW went under!
Granted, that's worst-case scenario but I don't like it.

Sean
