Subject: Vanagon/Eurovan Junkyards List

Hi folks,

Well I was over at my FLVWD parts counter picking up some bus stuff and
moaning about how I couldn't find a NOS driver's front 1/4 for my 70 bug
(shameless non bus ad) when my top notch parts manager gave me a June 95
copy of the Used Auto and Truck Parts Locator.  The following are what is
available for your vanagons/eurovans in junkyards around the country.  If
anyone wants the address/phone # of any of these yards let me know and I'll
send the info.  If the demand is great I'll just post a list of this info.  

This monthly publication costs $76/year (probably not worth subscribing to). 
If I'm able to get the info again, I'll keep posting it if it is useful.

(Abbreviations:  FEA=Front end assembly, RB=rear bumper, DT=drive train)
