&gt; Meanwhile the Schwarzemiester came running up to my van as I
&gt; was obviously driving up from the &quot;in&quot; direction he asked &quot;Wait, 
&gt; where are you going?&quot;  

doh.
&gt;			  He wanted to know if I wanted to go on 
&gt; an excursion to a local mining tunnel that was in the area and 
&gt; assured me that it wasn't that far and we'd all get there in the 
&gt; vans and then go to Randsburg for lunch.  I told him I was game 
&gt; for the trip.  I should've paid better attention to the little tune 
&gt; playing in the back ground of my mind.  It was playing a little melody 
&gt; with a male duo singing something about a tour boat going out on 
&gt; a three hour tour.

DOH!

&gt; We rambled out onto the highway and headed south on 14.  As we were
&gt; high-tailing it along Schwarzemiester thought he spotted one of our
&gt; party on a bicycle going in the opposite direction.  I figured this
&gt; could be one of the Schwarzemiester's delusions...

DOH!!!!!

&gt; As the gap narrowed the cyclist finally gave up the ghost and slowed
&gt; down.  The Scharzemiester applied the brakes and pulled over and
&gt; nearly side swiped the cyclist.  

DOH!!!!!!!!!!!
&gt; 
&gt; We took a turn at a road with a sign that pointed the direction
&gt; to Randsburg and traveled the road for a few miles.  Schwarzemiester
&gt; made a turn on to a gravel road and stated that this was surely
&gt; the road to the tunnel that was our goal.  We all trusted his
&gt; judgement as he had been there before. 

uhhh...

&gt; We treked through some more rugged terrain and then we found ourselves
&gt; driving down a washout.  Bewildered, the Schwarzemiester was at a loss
&gt; as to where we were although he kept up the pretense that the sought
&gt; after tunnel was just around the next bend.  

DOH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
&gt; 
&gt; While in the middle of the wash-out we were traversing rocks and
&gt; decided it was time to stop and and send scouts to see what was 
&gt; ahead before going any further.

&gt; We decided to go to Randsburg for lunch and headed down the road.
&gt; It was at this time that the Schwarzemiester enlightened us to the
&gt; fact that he just discovered that we were on the wrong road to the
&gt; tunnel.  

D'OHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

&gt; 	    As the map was passed around we saw that the road we were
&gt; on was marked as &quot;bad&quot;, &quot;very bad&quot;.  For 4-wheel drives only.  Only
&gt; someone who drives a Safari VW could have not understood the maps
&gt; meaning.  

D ' O H H H !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

&gt; 	    We joked about it and said things like, &quot;We're tough, We don't
&gt; need no stinking Synchro's&quot;.  But I knew in the back of everyones 
&gt; mind they were thinking, &quot;Who is this leader that has taken us down 
&gt; this mysterious road?&quot;  &quot;And to what purpose?&quot;  

Ummm... yeah.  I wanted to separate the &quot;men from the boys&quot;, so to speak.
After that experience, Martha asked me, &quot;That was great!  So when are
we gonna drive to the North Pole?  I'm ready!&quot;, while Steve said something
like, &quot;I want my mommy&quot;.  Heh heh...

Nice story though, Steve.  :)
