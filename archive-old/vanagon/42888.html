Subject: Re: losing traction


&gt;&gt;The problem with front drive, and one reason I haven't owned another front
&gt;&gt;driver, is that when you lose traction you lose steering as well.  The
&gt;&gt;steering whell was all loose while this was happening.  I was only 16 at
&gt;&gt;the time, so my experience in driving in emergenct situations was zero.
&gt;&gt;It scared the hell out of me and I was overly careful for about a month
&gt;&gt;afterward.
&gt;
&gt;A different GF of mine had the same hydroplaning experience in a
&gt;rear-wheel drive car, and I don't think she had much better steering
&gt;than you did while her car was doing lazy 360s at 55mph.  Somehow she
&gt;missed all the other cars on that 4-lane non-divided highway,
&gt;including the car she was trying to pass, missed the cement barriers
&gt;on the shoulder, and came out unscathed.  As I remember, she was
&gt;careful for longer than a month.  ;-)
&gt;
&gt;ObVW: Has anyone ever done any hydroplaning in a bus?  Somehow I'm
&gt;glad I've never had that experience.  A bit of purposeful fishtailing
&gt;on wet pavement certainly, but no hydroplaning.  Knock on wood.

When my '69 bus engine split in half years ago, I replaced it with an engine
from a '74 bug (alternator, DP, 34PICT-3, funny EGR valve) that had hit
a long stretch of standing water in the depression left by millions of car
and truck tires in the travel lane of a freeway (I-70 thirty miles west
of Denver). He finally came to a halt after rolling over five times.

On the same stretch of freeway, I used to play tach and speedo games
in an '82 Nissan Stanza, putting the left front tire in that water and
jazzing the pedal, watching the gauges go up and down, up and down,
while the car plowed along on its merry way. I was younger, stupider
(hard to imagine), and obviously a lot luckier then. Put Goodyear
Arrivas on it, and the problem lessened *somewhat*.

Keep in mind, Volks, that VW front ends are a lot lighter than those
FWD cars... 'nuff said.
