Subject: dual battery relay

One (heavy wire) goes to the main battery terminal. One (heavy wire) goes 
to the auxiliary. One goes to ground. The switching signal (smaller wire) 
is usually wired to the alternator warning light.

If you don't have a service manual with camper wiring diagram, you can 
borrow mine (I'm across the parking lot :)
