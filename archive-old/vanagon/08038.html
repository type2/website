Subject: deep cycle battery charging
Date: Tue, 13 Dec 1994 10:16:41 -0700 (MST)

Hello,
I am considering buying a deep cycle battery for my vanagon ... But I would
like to know, is there a different type of charger which is required in
order to charge a deep cycle battery?

Also, apparently there is a new type of battery available now ... the
&quot;optima&quot; battery.  This battery seems to not use acid (I still think it
must use acid of some kind), the electrode plates form cylinders and it
seems to be capable of deep cycle behaviour together with having more
cca.  Has anyone heard about these things or used them?

In the keeping-warm department, I have now seen a 68 watt electric pad
at a truck stop which one sleeps on to provide additional warmth.  This
might be something one could use to add more sleeping comfort.  

Also, I have now bought some of those chemical hand warmers.  Actually,
earlier someone suggested these also.  My idea is that if I find myself
stuck somewhere with a low battery on a cold morning, several of these
placed around the battery may increase the battery output enough to start
the vanagon.  Apparently, the packs may produce 130-140 degree temperatures,
run for up to 18 hours and if you place an opened warmer in an airtight
enclosure, the heating will stop until it is opened later.  Has anyone used
these things?
