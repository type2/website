Mico,

I agree with your key observation that many subscribers merely use the list
to kill time while someone else pays the bills.  And does the work.  You can
get a feel for this by comparing weekday vs weekend traffic, addresses and so
forth.  I make an exception for students but not a very big one.

Since that type of person rarely has much to offer besides half-witted
one-liners, I insert their data on a kill-list and thereafter never see them.
 I probably miss a few messages but I've always felt quality was more
important than quantity.

I subscribe to a number of lists and probably receive more traffic than most,
but I joined them, not the other way around.  Rather than expect them to
modify their lists to suit my individual situation, I've dealt with the
matter in a manner that suits my situation, which is to say it may not suit
yours.
