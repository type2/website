&gt; Firstly, what is the correct way to connect all the vacuum points on
&gt; the engine. I've got the vaccumm from the left hand carb connected
&gt; straight to the dizzy advance/retard, the way I would expect it to
&gt; be on any other car. However, the right hand arm of the air box has
&gt; a thermostatic type switch which I think should be in the circuit
&gt; somewhere? Then there is the pipe that runs between the carbs. This
&gt; has a small `box' in the middle with another pick off point. I've
&gt; just blanked this off, and as the engine seems to run fine, it stayed
&gt; like that. Where should it go?

It is meant to go to the air pump.  I have mine blocked off as well.
&gt; 
&gt; Secondly, I would like to balance the carbs. I took the van along
&gt; to the local carb place (with a big Solex sign hanging outside), to
&gt; see how much he would charge, but he refuses to touch vw campers?!?

You need special tools to do it &quot;right&quot;.  I just set them the way the
manual told me to and left them, and it ran fine.
