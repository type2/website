&gt;&gt;BUY IT!
&gt;&gt;BUY IT! 
&gt;&gt;BUY IT!
&gt;&gt;(Anything I tell you three times *must* be true.)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Seriously, the price of a rebuilt 1600 is running 4-800, installation 
&gt;&gt;shouldn't be more than $500, plus $650 for the bus and you got a $3000 
&gt;&gt;vehicle for &lt;2000.  A deal!  I would of course conduct the mandatory 
&gt;&gt;haggle, but not too seriously.  Look at it this way, if, as your address 
&gt;&gt;suggests, you are in VT, any rust free vehicle is worth a grand, running 
&gt;&gt;or not :-)=  
&gt;FYI
&gt;Actually I live in Christiansburg, VA.
&gt;_at_vt_dot_edu is Virginia Tech!!
&gt;No offense taken.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;$3K for a bus??
&gt;serious???
&gt;I don't think it has all the options, such as a stove...
&gt; 
&gt;I was planning to build an engine myself.  There is a VW shop in town which 
I can get to do the machine work. :)
&gt;I'm looking at 6-800 for parts and machine work so...
&gt;total cost should be 1250-1450.
