&gt;&gt; But I'm curious: why do you want an air-cooled engine?

&gt;Ive lost 2 engines due to cooling system problems, air cooled might be
&gt;my solution....but I'll consider any engine...
&gt;

With most air-cooled type 4 engines (bus/early Vanagon/1.7 or 18L 914), you 
are merely trading one weakness for another (a propensity for cooling 
system problems vs. a propensity for dropped valve seats).  Plus you are 
getting a less powerful motor with poor heat.  Not that I dislike type 4 
engines (in fact I like them alot!), but they have do their own weaknesss, 
just like the wasserboxer does.  Can't comment on 911 engines, though...
