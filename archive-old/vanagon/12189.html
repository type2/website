&gt;Does anyone have clever and reasonably priced sources for door and window 
&gt;seals for a '71 bus?  Mine are just a tad non-existent.  Also, any clever 
&gt;fixes for floor holes (not really huge) that won't require replacing the 
&gt;floor?

Try laying up some fiberglass over them.  Its worked for me wonderfully 
before.

Clean all the paint and crap off, and then use a few layers of say 6 or
8 oz cloth or mat across.  Overlap the holes by a about 4 inches or
so on each side with the cloth.  If you use the good clear surfboard
resin, you can watch the road while you drive!
