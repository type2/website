Subject: VW/T&amp;A..PC types make me puke!


Martin, Martin, Martin &lt;snicker...snicker&gt;

Your comment: &quot;I can't belive how many uptight, politically correct
'sweety boys&quot; there are on this listserver!


First off Martin, its so refreshing to see that you have someting
to contribute...after all this is the first time I have read
anuything from you on this listserv....

Second, It is obvious that you are the typical reader of VW T&amp;A
and DB&amp;HVWs in that you aparently do not read CONTENT, but rather
look at pictures (probably while locked in the bathroom).

If you DID read content, you would have read, and hopefully
comprehended the fact, that my gripe with VW T&amp;A deals with the
idea that the magazine editors write poorly, write at a 6th
grade reading level, and use the bimbos in the magazine as
a way of either masking their lack of editorial and production
quality or appealing to a group of pre-pubescent mastibatory
motorheads who don't give a rat's ass about content, quality, etc.,
but would rather drool over the fact that this month's
&quot;Sano Resto&quot; has a blonde whose breasts have more cubic displacement
than the engine sitting in the back of the vehicle...

&gt;From your command of English and your own literary style, it appears
that you are in the second of this group. For that, my friend, you
have my sympathy.

I do agree with you on one point, this T&amp;A discussion has reached
its saturation point...and its now time to look forward to such
technical subjects as Friday Funnies....or Joel's lists...or
even how we get the tables on our EVs to stay in place.
