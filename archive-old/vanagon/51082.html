Subject: Re: Filling westy water tank

&gt; So when the little gizzy that lights up the leds in the $$$ indicator panel
&gt; gives up, how do the cognoscenti fill up their water tank without overfilling
&gt; and flooding out the interiour (Br.)?
&gt;  eh? (Cdn)

I don't think it would flood the interior unless you had a problem 
with the vent or filler hose. My gauge has never worked (I destroyed 
it trying to fix... :( , but I just pop in the garden hose set to a 
slow trickle, then proceed in packing the van. After 15-20 minutes, 
it will start to dribble down the side of the van. If I need a *full*
tank I'll, let it dribble slower for another few minutes, otherwise, 
it's done. I always drain the tank after each trip, so I know about 
how long it will take to fill.
