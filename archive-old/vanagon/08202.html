Subject: Syncro Westy wanted EAST of the Mississippi

     Correcting an earlier, slightly obscure posting,
     I am looking for - well, you've read the Subject
     line. :)

     As this appears to be one of the Holy Grails of vandom,
     I'll gladly offer a finder's fee for the machine I
     eventuallty buy. Would $100 motivate you to read your
     local want ads? Thanks.
