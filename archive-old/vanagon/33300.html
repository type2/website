Subject: Import duty 

        In a couple of weeks I be taking my '61 micro bus out of hiding and
sailing with the ferry over to Sweden. Then I'll turn sail right back, and
declare an official entry. The big day must occur after the 28th of
February, 1996. From that date my bus will be 35 years old, and it will be
classed as a veteran vehical, and taxes determined according to an
alternative set of rules.
        The formula for  cars under 35 years would leave me with an import
duty bill of 180% of the original 1961 purchase price in Denmark. That
works out to be about 21,600 Danish Crowns (I believe with today's exchange
this would be $3800 US. By waiting to the 28th of February, my bill should
work out, by way of a bizarre formula, to be about $1100 US. Still tough
stuff: but as they say over here, when you purchase a new vehicle and are
faced with 180% you end up paying for three vehicles but only driving one
away.

        This brings me to my question: the formula used to calculate duty
is based on the original sales price, excluding all duties and taxes, and
whatever. What would a 1961 type 221 have sold for in North America new? I
haven't got a fixed price here yet, but I was told that it was about 12,000
crowns, depending on the model. This works out to be about $2,1000 US at
today's rate.
thanks
