&gt;Aha!   I knew it!  I have long mainted that the male brain occupies
                                ^^^^^^^
&gt;a different location in the body than the female one!!!!!   :)

Didn't you know that all males have a one-track mind?  And it's usually
not on VWs.

Of course, I could make a comment about the spelling ability of the
female mind, but I won't.
