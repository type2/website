Subject: Please help my 81 Vanagon live again :(

After dropping the gas tank to have a leak repaired, my faithful companion
refuses to start. Turning the key brings on the usual lights, but the engine
won't crank over. The battery is fully charged and I've had the starter
checked and cleaned all the crud off of the contacts, but still no go. The
really scary part is that I think the engine is seized up because I can't
even turn the engine over by hand. How could this happen? The thing ran like
a champ before having the tank r&amp;r'ed. It did set for a few weeks, but I've
done that before and had no problem getting her/him to run. 

I guess the bottom line is: What magic spirit do I use to un-seize the engine?

thanks
