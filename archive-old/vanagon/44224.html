&gt; I have never seen a walk thru dormobile either, although I have seen a
&gt; &quot;flip seat&quot; dormobile which i _assume_ is original. 

	on May 5th at Duxbury beach MA, there was an older Fel		
la who had a '69 walk-thru Dormobile... icebox was behind passenger seat 
divider, cabinets ( all low) were along drivers side wall... stove was 
under/behind passenger front seat... you flipped the seat forward stove 
came up from behind it(anchored to divider)leg swung down from under 
stove, shelf pivoted up from seat bottom and attached to stove... it was 
kinda neat... Bus itself was complete, but very rough... not much rust 
to speak of... all the curtains were hanging in shreds... rubber was 
dried to crusts... top canvas had been painted with spray paint..(looks 
like it was an attempt to make the canvas more &quot;room-darkening&quot;...)

	Gentleman didn't really want to sell it at that point 'cause it 
was his only running vehicle...!  supposedly he has 6-12 cars/busses in 
various states of disrepair on his property which are all &quot;projects&quot; 
that he'll get to someday...
