Subject: Cargo Limit

I have an 82 Vanagon Westfalia.  The door sticker says the GVW is 2250 kg.

How can I tell what amount of cargo weight I can safely add to the bus?

Any ideas on what problems would be caused by exceeding the weight limit by
say: 10% or 20%.  This would only be for a 2-3 highway drive over good roads.


Thanks
