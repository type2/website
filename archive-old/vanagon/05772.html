On the other side of the Blue Book, Carter VW (possibly the biggest VW
dealership in the country) out in Ballard (Seattle's ole Scandanavian
ghetto) will always have one or two Syncro Campers on the lot, stickered
invariably at about 2x bluebook (figure 21k for an 87, 24k for an 89,
26-29k for 90-91). While I'm sure you can deal on these prices, it's
definitely not a good point from which to start. And of course this is a
double windfall for Carter as the buyer is locked into them for financing.
No bank or credit union is gonna' give you a 20k loan for an 87 Vanagon, no
matter how cool it is.
