Subject:      Re: Repair parts?

Hi, I'm new to this forum, but I find it interesting. I purchased a 1989
Wolfsburg new and service in Illinois has been difficult. I need to find a
source of aftermarket parts. Can anyone help? Right now I am in dire need
of a complete exhaust. I checked the dealer and it would be cheaper to have
a local machine shop build a custom one from stainless steel!

$479 for the complete system including gaskets, but not including the
catalytic converter, muffler strap, and nuts &amp; bolts.  $99 more for the
CAT, $15 each for the straps.
