Subject: fuel problem solved

Thanks to all those who wrote to me about the fuel problem I described 
last week.  I couldn't figure anything out, so I took off heading west on 
I-40.  Got some gas in Asheville, started up the engine, and I couldn't 
go more than about 5 mph.  I drove for a couple of miles, and it was 
getting close to 5pm, so I asked where the VW dealer was.  It was on top 
of a big hill, and I just couldn't make it up.  So I sat there parked 
illegally while these VW mechanics drove by on their way home.  I was 
able to get back on the main road...barely any power left...and I pulled 
into a camping store.  Of course, in the parking lot, there's a guy with 
a '78 westy attempting to install a GEX engine that he just received.  I 
didn't notice him until after I was committed to pulling into the lot.  
Unfortunately, he couldn't help me diagnose the problem, but he told me I 
could camp out there for the night (which I did).  The employees at the 
store were very helpful, and they let me use the phone for a while and 
gave me some recommendations for people to call.  At least one you 
mentioned the air flow sensor flap, and once I figured out where it was, 
I was hoping that would be the problem.  I pushed it and it seemed to 
move quite freely, and I was able to compare mine to the other guy's  in the 
parking lot.  I thought I'd have to get towed in the morning having only 
made it 220 miles on my trip.  

After spending a restless night thinking about what would happen, I 
decided just to try starting it up in the morning and see if I could 
drive it to someone.  Of course, it starts right up and drives very 
smoothly...going up hills and everything.  The mechanic says to me, &quot;I 
can't fix anything if nothing's wrong.&quot;  Makes sense to me, and I knew 
that already, but I was hoping that I could figure out something.  The 
people at the camping store told me that I was crazy to drive across 
Kansas in a bus without AAA. 

After hanging around Asheville for a couple of hours trying to decide 
whether to turn back or keep going west, I decided to burn some fuel 
heading west, get some gas, and see if the problem would come back.  
Well, it started happening a bit outside of Kansas City (the slight 
burping.  Then I had to hold the steering wheel as if I was making a 
right turn for 2 hours while driving down I-70 in Kansas.  The wind was 
blowing consistently from the North and every time I would go under an 
overpass, my bus would veer toward the wall...reduced my mileage by about 
a third during that stretch.  Also, it was raining hard, 32 degrees, and 
cold water was dripping on my shoe.  I made it through though with all my 
muscles contracted from the cold.

By the end of the day, I was in Fort Collins, CO from whether this letter 
is being written.  The bus was cruising smoothly at speeds faster than I 
had anticipated, and it sounded nice at the high altitude.  I'm convinced 
that moving that flap solved the problem even though it didn't feel stuck 
at all, and I didn't have to call AAA.   I Drove about 1500 miles in 36 
hours, and everything sounds good.  

Just wanted to let ya'll know there was a happy ending.
