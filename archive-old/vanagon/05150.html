&gt;In Skinned Knuckles magazine I saw an ad for a little filter they sell for
&gt;your coolent system. You put the filter in the coolent hose somewhere and it
&gt;catches little pieces of metal.
&gt;Good idea?

Skinned Knuckles?? what is that? :)

------------Skinned Knuckles is a wonderful magazine about restoring old
cars. The editor, Matt Jacobs? is tremendous. Since all of our cars are
becoming old and need restoring, I read it.

question is: how to you get it out easily to clean/change the filter? does
it screw on to an installed coupling? or must you uncouple the coolant hoses
(and thereby dumping a gallon or so all over yourself) to install it or take
it out.

--------------not a screw on. A dump gallon type system.

if it was a screw on, like the oil filter, i kinda like the idea. probably
just another place for the coolant to leak out, though.

i wonder if that Oberg super filter would work on coolant?
