About the squeek in the front wheel...I had a small stone jump in there 
and made me quitc concerned.  I took off the wheel and began digging 
around in the brakes and a small stone that was ground on one side fell out.

Probably is not what you have but ya never know.

p.s. I lubed my 77 campmobile and loved every minuite of it too.
