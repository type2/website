Subject: Re: Heater cable connects to valve... how?

&gt; But I digress.  The fiche does not show the clip that connects the cable to
&gt; the heater control valve--it does show a clip that fits the cable to a lever

&gt; ends.  I can't figure out how this works, can anyone explain?

i think that clip may be the same on both the lever and valve ends. 
i replaced the cable on the '87 last year.  those clips are kinda
rinky-dink but they seem to work once installed.  the one on the
heater valve is a bugger to reach and have sufficient strength to
clip it on.  it works by the 'lip' of that clip snapping over a
plastic flange on the heater valve.  if the cable is cocked one way
or the other, the clip won't snap in place and it flies off in a
random direction with the force of a slingshot.  i think i was able
to finally snap that lip in place with my fingers but they had a
permanent indent from the clip for about 2 days.  i'd also tried a
needle nose and a channel lock pliers.  that clip will be the
hardest part of the entire job.  drop the spare tire and lie on the 
carrier with a big o' trouble light next to you.  have something for 
your head to rest on to reduce fatigue.  and then just keep at the 
bugger until you get it.  you get to treat yourself to a reward after 
it snaps in place.

 It's not cold &gt; here yet (Atlanta) but
it is just around the corner (not meaning to make the &gt; Minnesotans
on the list laugh too hard). 

oh we wouldn't do that, it cracks the frost on our lips :)
