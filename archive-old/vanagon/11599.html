Evan Estern inquires about Monza mufflers. I installed one on my '75
Camper back in August. Cost about $115 at the Bus Boys. I am disappointed
with the quality. They were painted with cheap, non-heat resistant paint
which burned off and stunk like hell. Corrosion ensued immediately. I spent
the best part of an afternoon derusting the thing and repainting it with
BBQ paint, but that didn't help much. Maybe the $175 ones are better. Ask
the sales clerk about their origin.

I also find the muffler to be a bit noisy. I haven't noticed more power.
Rather, it's less because I try to keep the noise down. Besides, the
heat exchangers are the limiting factor here.

Tune-ups are painful with CO blowing in your face and the hot exhaust tips
burning your legs.

However, they are *much* cheaper and simpler than original VW parts. But
so are the other one-piece exhaust systems sold by many after-market
companies. Don't forget to order the 2 gaskets and 6 automotive nuts and
bolts, while you're at it. 

Wish you lots of fun removing the old system... :)
