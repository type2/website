Subject: 1st trip, no probs

        Well my forst official trip in my new mobile is over. It was a
short 3 day jaunt around the Alberta countryside and out to the moutnains,
but fruitful nontheless. I must say that if this is what camping in a VW is
all about, then sign me up baby cause I love it.
        It was just about the best camping trip Ive had. Evrything worked
great, stove, fridge, and the van itself.
        I'd like to congratulate and thank the german wizard who designed a
fridge that perfectly holds 15 bottles. The guys amazing no?

        So all in all I drove 1200 kms, and had more fun than I have in a
long time. I cant wait to take it out to the coast in a 2 months. Should be
great.

        thanks for all your help in getting me this far. You know who you rae.
