Subject: my buddy is reeeel interested in a Westy

All,

My buddy down the hall is a long time VW owner and loves my '83.   
The long and short of it is that he is interested in getting one.  
So,  is there anyone in the Mid-Atlantic area that may know of one 
lurking about and ready for a new home?
