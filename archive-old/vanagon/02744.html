&gt; 
&gt; In his suggested list Steve mentions a Coleman lantern, gas or propane. He
&gt; says he has gas only because it was given to him. What about the Coleman
&gt; electric? An add for it says it can be charged off of 120 or 12volt. It could
&gt; be charged while driving and the charge is supposed to last 4 hours using both
&gt; light tubes and 7&gt;8 using only one. Are these any good, it seems like a lot
&gt; friendlier way to go, eh?

Yeah, my wife got one of these without the charger.  I would imagine the charger
one works better.  The one we got uses 6 or 8 D batteries.  I forgot because we
hardly ever use it.  It's pretty dim compared to the gas lanterns but might be
a good trade-off for those not wanting to infringe on other campsites with too
much light.  I like to you a blanket hanging on a strung out rope to buffer my
gas one.  I also have a rechargable Coleman heavy duty flash light that is 
great for working under the car in the dark because it's bright and has it's
own stand.  It has a cigarette lighter plug in so I can charge it while driving
as well as a 110V AC adapter as well.  Got it from my mother-in-law for Christmas.
Turned out to be one of the best gifts I've gotten.
