&gt;Ok, let's really open this can of worms.  I've yet to hear/see anything 
&gt;that totally disenchants me from the notion of hydrogen fuels, outside of 
&gt;the technological challenges, which as we all know are not 
&gt;insurmountable.

======================

I'm no engineer and I really try my best not to play one on the internet, 
but I'm with you; I think hydrogen burning vehicles are conceptually the 
the most viable possibiliy for the future.

There are two main problems with electric cars that I see:  first, the 
additional layer of processing (and consequent loss of efficiency) 
required in energy production as pointed out by several other list 
members, and second, the massive, MASSIVE solid waste 
manufacture/disposal/recycling problem introduced by batteries.  
Batteries are full of extremely toxic stuff which require extremely toxic 
manufacturing processes to produce.  The more efficient modern batteries 
most likely to make it into electric autos due to their ability to hold a 
charge and be recharged are made with large amounts of exotic heavy 
metals so toxic it makes lead and sulphuric acid look like as dangerous 
as a twinkie in comparison.  Imagine trying to keep that out of the 
groundwater as millions of autos requiring billions of tons of this crap 
are manufactured.  Besides, I doubt electric cars will never become very 
practical performance-wise until an affordable natural temperature 
superconducting or near-superconducting material is available.  But this 
would also make the production of hydrogen (from bloody SEAWATER!) that 
much more efficient/inexpensive.  

Come with me; your getting very sleeeepyy:

The year 2007:

VW Busses and Vanagons are commonly retrofitted with compact, powerful 
hydrogen burning  engines using off-the-shelf internal combustion 
technology and a giant Bic lighter-like fuel cell that can be exchanged 
with a full one at any roadside service station.  The surprisingly 
light-weight fuel cell are of course of a design able to withstand the 
impact produced by a hydrogen burning locomotive, which along with our 
busses produce an engine exhaust that smelled very much like fresh 
laundry.  The only downside I see is that the number one green-house gas 
(if you believe in such things) is water vapor  =8^)

Cheers!

Peter.
