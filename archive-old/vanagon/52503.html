Subject: Where can I find affordable parts?

A water pump for $185 for my 87 syncro--forget carrying a spare.I just bought
a low 
miles syncro with a few kinks to work out. Can anyone tell me where to beat
dealer
prices? I'm in Boston now and will drive cross country soon. Mail order info
would be cool too. Sure there's JCWhitney for some things. Thanks.
