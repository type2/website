&gt; After three months we finally got our 85 Vanagon running.  The reason was to
&gt; replace the water pump.  Now running on its third pump!
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; We are pleased how everything turned out.  Also, we replaced the clutch
&gt; last November.  It took us just six hours to do that (we could have done it
&gt; in less time but we had other things going.)   With the brakes and the shocks
&gt; done last year also, we have a &quot;new&quot; car for a while.

Congratulations on getting back on the road with you classic wheels.  I was
wondering if you could post some tips and what to watch out for when dismantling/
remantling the engine in and out from the vehicle?

Thanks for the info.
