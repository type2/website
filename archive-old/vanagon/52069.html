&lt;&lt;        I have two questions:
 
                 1. Is the receiver/dryer composed of some sort of desicant
 material, to absorb any moisture from the freon?
 
                 2. If the answer to #1 is yes, then can I gently toast the 
 receiver/dryer the the oven for a few hours, at say 100 degrees C,
 to drive off any accumulated moisture, and then reinstall the unit in
 my AC freon circuit?
 
         And no, don't ask why I am recommissioning the AC, with 
 30 cm of the white stuff on the ground!
  &gt;&gt;
Yes the dryewr uses a dessicant.  The dessicant will break down and drying it
in an oven only worsens the problem.  If the dessicant breaks free, it will
destroy the compressor, expansion valve and I have even seen this cause a
hose or pipe to rupture when the system gets clogged.  Spend the money.  It
is cheap insurance.
