Subject: re: brakes on EV and other EV stuff

I bought the van at 36,000 miles and I'm at about 40,500 right now.  I 
don't know if the brakes have ever been done.

As a follow-up to any of you Eurovan owners, the grinding noise that I'm 
getting from the right front, is according to MIDAS the breaks.  I will 
find out for sure this weekend, when I might get a chance to do the brakes.

Regarding the rattling noise I was getting from the catalytic converter 
area, I've got a VW dealer to bit** out.  I took the van in to get the 
tie rod end boot replaced($8.00 part and $120.00 labor) and have them 
check out the rattle.  Here is what they found, &quot;there are a bunch of 
small rocks shoved under the heat shield that are causing the rattle.&quot;  I 
say, &quot;ok, whatever, if you can't cut it off and reweld it, leave it alone 
and I'll deal with it.&quot;  

Well, one week later, I leave the van at MIDAS to get the grinding noise 
checked, thinking front wheel bearings, and to have them check the 
catalytic converter. The mechanic said the grind was that the front 
brakes were just about completely worn out (they wanted $140 to do them, 
nope I don't think so), and AMAZINGLY the heat shield had a broken weld 
and that was the source of the rattle.  Even after I declined the brake 
job, I asked how much to just weld the thing back.  They said &quot;NO 
CHARGE,&quot; I said &quot;ok, thanks.&quot;  Drove the van home, and wow, no more rattle.

BTW I asked the dealer about checking my van for piston slap, and of 
course the dealers mechanic, whom had worked on VW's for 12 years had 
never heard of it.  So I promptly took them a few excerpts from this 
list, said here look at this, and please call your regional service 
manager and find out about it for me.  Of course, I've heard nothing.

&gt; $120 a set?  Wow, a little too steep for me.  I'd try the FLAPS version
&gt; first.  My EV rotors are not vented, btw.  I'd be interested in a write-up
&gt; on the procedure when you're done.  BTW, what mileage are you at now?

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Has anybody out there done the front brakes on their Eurovan?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Mine are almost gone, VW wants $120.00 for the pads alone.  NAPA has them 
&gt; &gt;for $40.00.
&gt; &gt;Also the dealer asked me if they were vented, have you seen any Eurovans 
&gt; &gt;with vented rotors?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Do these prices aound about right?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Does anybody have any pointers on doing it?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Is it any worse than a Vanagon?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I haven't got my Bently yet (two months and counting).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Thanks for any help,
