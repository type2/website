&gt;I keep seeing in the paper, ads for marine batteries. Aren't these
&gt;deep-cycle types, used for electric trolling motors etc.? Why wouldn't
&gt;they work as auxiliary batteries in Westies, to power the stereo,
&gt;lights, fridge etc. when stopped?

Too big (tall) to fit in the standard battery compartment.  Should fit under
the rear seat though.
