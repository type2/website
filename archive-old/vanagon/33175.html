Subject: Re: Taking care of pop top fiberglass

Hello Mark.  You don't say what year your van is, but if it is the 
painted top (with clearcoat), just wax as normal.  I use carnuba 
based wax (soon to try Zymol with 35% carnuba content).  It cleans 
really well, and keeps like new.

Harry.

&gt; What's the proper treatment for prolonging the paint on a Westfalia pop
&gt; top? Should it be waxed with a good carnuba-based auto wax?
