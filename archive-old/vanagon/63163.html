Subject:      FS - '86 Weekender FS soon!

Hi Volks,

Well, we ended up buying Lon Herman's '85 Westy and won't be needing our
'86 Weekender, no more room at the inn!  This van is the subject of many
recent postings relating to &quot;running rich&quot; and such. We just bought the van
in February, when it was in need of much care! Cosmetically it was great
and unaltered, but it had been neglected mechanically. Since then, much has
been done (witnessed and aided by the list!) to bring it to its current
shape. Here's as complete a list as I can muster, I'm sure I'll forget
something!

- 1986 Vanagon GL Weekender (no poptop)
- 142K
- Auto tranny
- Dove blue metallic color - only a couple of very minor dings and chips
which have been touched up, NO rust or seam rust. The paint is in great
shape and looks great. No signs at all of any collision or repair.
- Interior is in near perfect condition with rear cushion still there :-)
Everything has been recently steam cleaned
- NEW a/c compressor which will be freshly charged before sale
- FI system thoroughly gone through! Either replaced or refurbished
everything!
- Engine runs cool, slightly below 1/2 when driving and just slightly above
half when idling for extended periods, with the fan cycling as it should.
We originally had the engine checked for head gasket leaks when we first
purchased the van and all checked out well!
- NEW radiator, thanks to me overtightening the bleed screw and cracking
the aged and brittle plastic housing while explaining to my wife the
importance of checking and bleeding the coolant, DOH!
- auto tranny fluid replaced and works great!
- brakes thoroughly gone over with new pads, turned rotors, and such
- NEW rear shocks
- NEW Michelin MLX (reinforced sidewalls, etc., etc.) tires, including the
spare!
- Blaupunkt AM/FM stereo
- I'm not listing a price yet as I haven't decided, any opinions?

I'm sure there is a lot I'm forgetting. If anyone wants any more detailed
info, p-mail me. My wife and I (and 5 of her students) took several 600
mile trips in the van without fail. The temptation of the Westy was just
too much! Not to mention Melanie just bought a new Golk Trek to commute in.

Anyway, that's it for now. I'm sure there will be many more &quot;adventures&quot;
with the '85 Westy!
