Subject: Re: some dull boring statistics ...

&gt;Dull and boring?!  I think not!  :)
&gt;
&gt;Unfortunately I am a recent member and I don't believe I was included in this 
&gt;count.  I am in San Jose, CA and have a '64 Deluxe.  I would love to know some 
&gt;of the other people in the bay area who have split-windows.  Send me private e-
&gt;mail and maybe we can swap parts and info.
&gt;

Dull and boring... I think so (No offense to Mr. Walker or anyone who likes
this stats list) but I think it's too bad that there isn't software (except
for WWWeb) that allows a nicer and more creative way to present otherwise
boring statistics.  Wouldn't it be cool to have the oppurtunity to take a
look at everyone's different ride?

I guess real time teleconferencing and flat panel display technology is
still a ways off. ;-)
