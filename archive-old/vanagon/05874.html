Subject:       Re: dim lights when revved

&gt; Reason being - I've noticed at night that the Batt and EGR lights 
are
&gt; barely glowing, but the weird thing is that they both go out when I'm
&gt; idling - its
&gt; only when I'm actually driving under load that I can see this.

If it helps your mindset, my lights glow too at night.  My mind may 
be fabricating a tech bulletin on this but I seem to recall one that 
said essentially, &quot;Relax, Don't worry, Have a Homebrew.&quot;  Oops, wrong 
listserv.
