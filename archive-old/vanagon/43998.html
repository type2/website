Subject: Help installtion Aux.battery 1985 westy


&gt;
&gt; Hello Vanagon list, I would like to install a deep cycle aux. Battery
&gt;under the rear seat of a 1985 Westy. I have read that a battery isolator is
&gt;not good,but should use a high amp relay(how high of an amp?). Local RV
&gt;store wants $45 for a battery cut-out relay. Anyone know a cheaper
&gt;alternative? Could you not use, say a 1970's Ford starter relay? 

        There are two basic types of relays, Continuous and intermittent
duty. All starter relays are intermittent duty. They are designed to operate
fast and often, hence... The coil of the relay pulls in hard so you have
less arcing. It also draws more current when holding. If this relay was left
on for a long time it may be a fire hazard... It will get warm, if not hot
to touch.
        You need a continuous duty relay. They are designed to be on for
long times, do not get hot, do not use much current. Not to many around the
automotive sections... try RV shops, or aircraft supply. In aviation it is
called a master relay to disable battery power to the airframe.

        Why did you hear the Isolator is not good?
