Subject:      sagging visors

Hi all,

Thanks for the starter problem suggestions... as soon as it stops working
again, I have some idea of what to look for.

Next... very minor, but very annoying: Any thoughts on what to do with a
terminally sagging sun visor, short of replacement.  I've tried the obvious
tightnening of the screw that looks as if it should control tension, to no
avail.

Thanks,
