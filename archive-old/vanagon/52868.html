Subject: Vanagon sighted in Germany


On German roads near Dusseldorf I sighted a light-blue Westy
with a Vanagon emblem on the rear hatch. The plates says
MYK-?? ??? which is in the middle west section of Germany.

It is a turbocharged Diesel and as I know the real Vanagons,
this is a simple emblem mismatch. The driver visited the US,
I'm sure.
