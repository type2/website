Subject: Re: The $20.02 Paint Job

Oh yeah!!! (huff and puff!) I am totally offended and feel real insecure and
will retaliate with some transference of aggression. (huff and puff!)  I
wouldn't *ever* over react to someone's opinion that doesn't exactly match
mine or respond to obvious flame bait for the sake of shaking up the list
members. 
My wife and I saved up real hard for OUR sponges!!! I mean we're not some
rich pukes, we waited for Dollar Daze at K-mart an then went shoplifting. We
never realized how diffy cult it was to hide sponges! I for one had to
compromise an git the paint that all of the mistakes are blended together.
We kinda like the Bahama Beige color though! I had to stand on top of the
bus an just pour it over the top until it oozed down the sides. This method
helped seal the dried out rubber, tighten up the door rattles, and seize the
windshield wipers. Mebbe this winter the rain and snow won't end up in my
lap. I used to hate it when the package tray would fill up with water over
night and then sloosh all over my Oshkosh, Unionsuit, and Johnson unit at
the first hard right turn of the morning. We topped the bus all off with
fifteen year shingles. Boy, what a chore it was to get all of those nails
throught the metal. Now my bus is as slow as the Vanagon! Cool! =) For the
detail areas we had to take a mouthfuls of paint and spit it through a straw
that we stole from McDonald's. You know those industrial strength thick
mothers that you could chew on the whole length of I-5 and never break
through it. We had to compromise for the wood palette roof rack. We also
discovered that vice-grip pliers make a great shifting coupler. As it whirs
around, it creates a cool banging noise that helps kamo-flawge the sound of
the solid tranny mounts and the no squelch noise from the CB. We couldn't
afford seat belts so we decided to make the kids stand up in the back and
hang on to bungee cords like a cheap subway. We tell them to pretend that it
is the 'BART.' Sometimes we play like were riding the 'El' or the Manhattan
Midtown Express. Works great until we &quot;stop short&quot; with the baby sitter in
the van. ;)

 It would be real easy to get defensive about YOUR opinion *BOB* but I
prefer to be the ultimate friendly guy who never stands up for himself
(Except this time if you promise not to be mean back). Otherwise I apologize
and will quiver in the corner. But hey, you did bring up some good points.
Thanks for the sermon!
