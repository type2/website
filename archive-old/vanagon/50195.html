&gt; I live in the UK, my van is 1989 1.9L watercooled Transporter,

&gt; 
&gt; I'm after a good workshop manual for this van.  Is there a Haynes
&gt; manual?  Is it any good (I've had some bad experiences with
&gt; Haynes Lies)?  Is there a US manual which covers this model?  Are
&gt; there any VW workshop manuals available? Are THEY any good?
