Subject: Car covers to fit a Vanagon?

Who out there keeps a cover over their Vanagon while it's parked?  I
only drive mine a couple of times a week and don't have the garage space
to keep it inside, but would like to preserve that schmancy TITIAN RED
paint job.

Anybody have one they really like?  Where'dja get it and how much was
it?  Preferences on materials, construction, etc.?  Any used ones out
there for sale cheap? &lt;:-]
