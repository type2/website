Subject: Re: Berg short-shift for Vgon

At some point you probably do need to get a more serious starter, and FAT has one,
but 2.7 liters does not seem to be the crossover point.  Note, however, that I
haven't been through a winter with it yet.

Alternator comes with the engine; stock VW alternator would not fit.  (Porsche
alternator sits inside the fan shroud, belt driven along with the fan.)

5speed transmission would be wonderful (although the Porsche six is a lot hap-
pier at 4500rpm than the VW four) but a good one is $1500 alone, and then you
have to get it to fit and shift.  If I put another $1500 in, it will be for
air conditioning from ICE, first.
