Subject: Re: 20 years ago today....I bought 2 bugs!

Hi,

Enjoyed RGOLEN's poem, especially since it had special significance for me 
today...I made a purchase last night and am going to pick up the goods today 
after work.  I have been looking for a late 60's to early 70's bug for my 
wife, and low and behold last night ran across an ad in the paper for a 71 bug 
PLUS a 56 bug (it was referred to as a package deal), and tons of parts.  
$1500 asked, we settled on $1300.

The 71 is a daily driver and will do nicely for the wife.  The 56 is basically 
&quot;all there&quot;, but needs assembly, tinkering, etc.  Both are rust-free and seem 
very sound :-) !!!

I think I got a steal.  My wife is still looking at me sideways, trying to 
figure out how I managed to buy a bug for myself whilst acting as her &quot;buyer's 
agent&quot; ...

For RGOLEN: Since I'm just getting back into bugs (I have a 71 Westy which 
brought me to this list), I noticed you referred in your poem to a 'Deluxe 
56'.  Can you tell me what this means, and any other 56 tidbits you may want 
to offer?  TIA
