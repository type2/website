I have to say this &quot;Tailgators&quot; thread has been the source of much
amusement.  Here's another idea.  I wonder if there's some way to
simulate the dissolution of a retread tire, that is, feed some
long strips of tire rubber out one of the wheel wells.  As it
whips around before flying off, it gives tailgators plenty
of time to get scared and back off.  I've seen this happen
to an 18-wheeler and believe me you get out of the way.

Or an addendum to the dropped-muffler trick, let it go
but still attached to the bus with a piece of coathanger
wire, this will shoot sparks for a few minutes before
letting go.  Kind of like warning shots across the bow,
then get serious.  Bombs away!!!!!

Or you all could just get '63 and earlier buses:  the back
window is so small that when tailgators get close enough
you can't see them at all so they don't bug you.  :-)
