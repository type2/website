&gt;I am still looking for a drop in replacement for my large sunroof

&gt;Any hints?

&gt;i just had a thought fleetingly pass behind my eyeballs:  yachts.

I just happen to be a yachting camper (until racing season ends;
then I'll become a camping yachter), so I'm familiar with that
stuff.  I called a friend of mine who is the manager of the
Sausalito West Marine Products store.  She quoted me the price of
$160 (plus tax [depending on from which State you order] and
shipping, of course) for a 10&quot; X 10&quot; marine deck hatch by Vetus.
The next size larger is 12&quot; X 12&quot; for $260+.  There are other more
costly manufacturers and certainly much larger deck hatch sizes.
The largest you can drive a motorcycle through and you don't want to
know the price, but it'll go around the world and not break or leak.

I also happened to ask the company in Hollywood who manufactures the
goodies for the Westphalia campers (can't remember their name right
now and my notes are at home) and they quoted me a price of over
$200 for an authentic replacement hatch.

If anybody wants to try West Marine, they have knowledgeable service
folks at their mail order number 800-538-0775.  They'll beat or
match anybody's prices, so if you want to haggle, do your shopping
first.
