I think the above two participants might be bringing all you need!  I 
only hope they bring enough for all.  BTW, you should learn a few code
words to disguise your contraband.  :)  Don't you know the government 
scans everything on the net.  If Derek has access to the software you 
can bet your butt the DEA does.  Have fun.  I will be thinking of 
you all as I ride out a rainy cold spring weekend in Nebraska.  Jim
