Subject: 87 &quot;Drivetrain&quot;/engine noise


Hello Again-

Thanks to those who responded to my last post(s) regarding the noise on my 
87 Vanagon.

After more troubleshooting I have isolated the problem to the AC compressor 
&quot;clutch assembly&quot;.  After removing the AC belt, I can feel the end play in 
the clutch assembly.  More questions...

Has anybody ever replaced the bearing/clutch assembly on their AC 
compressor?  My AC was working fine.  I hate to pay to &quot;break&quot; the system to 
replace the entire compressor (and big bucks for more freon) if I can 
repair/replace just the clutch assembly or bearing.  Any info much 
appreciated...

Thanks-
