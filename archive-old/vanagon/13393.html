Subject: Oil Leak Problem II  help!!!
Date: Thu, 16 Mar 1995 15:15:40 -0500 (EST)

guys,

i wrote yesterday and got lots of response.  i have since investigated the
probelem, and found that it is very likely not the valve cover gasket. 
the oil drippage seems to be coming from underneath it and slightly toward
the crankcase--pushrod sleeve seals perhaps?  i also do not think that it
is the oil cooler, as the leak seems to be ON the engine itself.

thanks to all who reply.

evan

ps-if it is the pushrod sleeve seals, how easy are they to fix? (is engine
removal necessary?)
