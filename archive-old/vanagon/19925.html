Subject: Converting an '83 Vanagon to propane


I've just aquired an an '83 Vanagon and am interested in converting it
to run on propane.  I have heard that there are carb kits available in
the $500-1000 range, and I think with some creative welding I can mount
the tank just forward of the engine compartment (inside encased in metal).

Anyone attemped this?  Any feedback appreciated.

Thanks,
Paul
