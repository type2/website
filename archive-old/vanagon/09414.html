Subject: Re: Brake master cylinder rebuild?

&gt;
&gt;  I have a '67, which has a one-year only master cylinder. 
&gt; the cost for this year only is around $150.00 and up. 
&gt; 
Richard,
Before you go and buy a $150 master cylinder or a rebuild kit
check with your FLAPS for the master cylinder.  I just purchased
3 that fit '58-'66 for $15/each.  A friend of mine purchased one
for his '67 from Downey Auto Parts for $30-40.  Brazillian, but
better than a rebuild.
