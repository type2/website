&gt;
&gt;Hi Stevie,
&gt;
&gt;Obviously, that high-resistance coil wire will make your VW run
&gt;really badly (and the spark plugs might even look like it's been
&gt;running rich).  A 1.5 ohm primary coil is close to OK, but it's
&gt;easy to check your coil for sure.  Once you have a good coil
&gt;wire in place, you can look at a spark while it's running.  With
&gt;the engine off, ground a spare plug (maybe clamp it to the case
&gt;lightly with a pair of vice grips, taking care not to mash
&gt;threads or crack the insulator) and hook it up to an ignition
&gt;wire that you've temporarily borrowed from its real plug.  Start
&gt;the engine (yeah, it'll run rough since one of the real plugs
&gt;isn't firing...)  then look for a fat, bright blue spark instead
&gt;of a thin, yellow, or dim one.  (Well, with Bosch Platinums
&gt;you'll always get thin, which might be why my '72 hates 'em.)
&gt;
&gt;You could also just pull off an ignition wire and hold the metal
&gt;end a quarter inch or so from a ground and look at the spark
&gt;that way.  Even though it's lots quicker, it seems messier and I
&gt;can never hold still enough to get a consistent spark and look
&gt;at it at the same time.
&gt;
&gt;No doubt you already know this, but you should always use
&gt;insulated tools when you're messing with running ignition wires,
&gt;in case one of them should have a leak.
&gt;
&gt;Good Luck!

Dennis,
My 82 Vanagon had problems starting last month --especially on humid days.  I 
thought at first it was the ignition relay dieing but come to find out the 
ignition wire from the coil the distributer.  It measured at 8500 ohms.  I 
bought a new one and it measured 900 ohms and my problems were solved. The 
factory book recommends that you replace wires when they get at 10000 ohms, 
but, as usual, what is on paper often is not reality. The spark was shorting 
out at the coil tower because there was so much resistance in the wire 
---going around the insulator boot and hittting the ground terminal--- all 
very secretly.
