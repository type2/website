Subject: Camshaft assembly...not smooth
Date: Sun, 13 Aug 1995 20:32:44 -0400 (EDT)

Hi Y'all,

'71 bus, 1600 dp.

Was hoping to mate the halves of the '71 bus  crankcase today, but after 
installing the new camshaft and giving it a few turns, I'm holding back. 
The (old) crankshaft turned smoothly before installing the (new) camshaft. 
After installing the camshaft and then turning the crankshaft forward, it 
would seem to hang up after half a turn. With a little coaxing, though, 
it would  continue.  Turning the crankshaft backwards lifts the camshaft 
out of the bearings a little bit.  According to Tom Willson, this means 
that the backlash is too tight.  Then what do you do??? How is this 
remedied?? I don't think the idiot's guide addresses backlash.

The camshaft is a -2, just like the old one.  I must admit that the 
distributor driveshaft was too sloppy...about .065&quot;.  Wilson recommends 
no more than .050&quot;.  He also says better to much than to little slop.  
Should I hold up the assembly and get another shim?  Could this cause the 
crank/camshaft not to turn smoothly?

While I'm at it, what grade of Loctite do you use on the rod nuts? Red? I 
used the blue because that's all I had, but now that I may have to go to 
the parts store anyway, is it worth breaking them loose and doin' em again?  
These torque to 24 ft/lbs, right?


Any help ASAP would be great!  Thanks to those who have already 
helped and I haven't thanked you properly.

Mitch
