Subject: The Tehachapi Run



                    The Tehachapi Run

Monday night I had my Chinese dream.  Along with three other
recurring nightmares, the Chinese dream is my legacy for two
tours in Vietnam.  The healing salve of time has left the
circatrice of my physical wounds crinkled and white but the
mental wounds of those wasted years remain unhealed, the horror
forever fresh.  I assume there is a lesson in this.  Perhaps one
day I will understand.

The Chinese dream often occurs when it rains.  You can't hear
them approach the wire when it rains.  They'll turn your
Claymores around, aim your own mines back at your.  There is a
need to be extra alert when it rains.  It was raining when I
awoke, soaked with sweat, the scream strangled in my throat.  

The nightmares come in Technicolor with stereo sound and even the
smell of death supplied.  Following such night terrors there is a
need for reassurance, for on the moment of awakening and for some
time after the dream is my reality, all else a myth.

I arm myself, dress and patrol the property.  There are no
Claymores guarding my driveway.  It makes no sense to go prowling
in suburbia at three a.m.   Yet I'm convinced that the day I do
nothing will be the day the dreams comes true.

There's no going back to sleep after the nightmares.  They are
too vivid, too likely to recur so long as it remains dark.  Time
enough to nap later, when it is light.  Instead, I work in the
shop.  Sometimes I write.  A few times I've scrubbed the kitchen
floor, an act of contrition for the woman who loves me and in
doing so, is herself punished for a war that never should have
happened.

Tonight there's plenty to do in the shop.  I'm working on two
engines, a stock 1700cc Type IV to power the Rincon Rocket and a
very special two liter upright destined for Bob Polys'  Porsche Spyder
replicar.  Both need heads.  The T4 heads are simply worn out,
needing seats as well as guides.  Replacements will have to come
from Mark Stephens' shop in Tehachapi, California since I don't
trust the methods other shops use to replace the valve seats. 
The heads for the Spyder engine are a thornier problem.  I've
been unable to find suitable castings on which to build the big-
valve heads needed to make the Spyder engine come alive.  The few
good castings I've found are two expensive while the others were
simply trash, unsuitable for use in a high-performance engine.  

A few days ago I'd called Mark Stephens' shop and the foreman
mentioned having heads for uprights as well as T4's.  Suddenly,
at 0320 Tuesday morning I decide to drive to Tehachapi, about
four hours away.  Such is the logic of nightmares that it seemed
like a good idea at the time.

There are but few logistical considerations for such a short
trip, coffee to be made, a note scribbled for my long-suffering
wife, loading heads and tools and spare gas into the bus, check
the oil.  In a light rain I motor through the tunnel of the
night, down Buena Creek, hang a left at Twin Oaks Valley, climb
up the narrow notch of Deer Creek canyon.  By 0410 I'm on I-15,
heading north.  

The bus is running well, the engine a throaty purr.  There is
some slop in the steering that I'll take care of before starting
on the Inuvik trip but if I watch my speed and if the cross-winds
aren't too bad, the steering is acceptable.  The big engine wants
to stretch its muscles but I keep it down, wanting to conserve
fuel.  There's no one on the road but me and a few trucks.  They
pass me on the flats but I walk by them on the upgrades.  In
northern San Diego county, I-15 is a roller-coaster.

Grinding up the long grade near Fallbrook, I ran into heavier rain. 
My windscreen is coated with Rain-X and I'd not needed
the wiper until now.  There is enough heat to keep the glass
clear and all the gauges are in the green, 50 psi, 190 degrees,
13.5 volts and about 3,500 rpm.  The speedo says I'm running just
over 55 mph but the tires are larger than stock so it reads a
little low.

I've built quite a few engines.  I test them not only on the
stand but on in the vehicles they power, under actual road
conditions.  If I follow Gopher Canyon Road to the freeway
instead of taking Deer Creek, Indian Truck Trail crosses I-15
exactly 50.2 miles north of my house.  After installing an engine
I fill the tank at the Chevron station, drive to Indian Truck
Trail, turn around, come back to the same pump and top up.   The
road test takes about two hours and covers city streets, a twisty
section of county road, two remarkably steep grades and nice long
stretches of freeway.  By refueling at the same pump, the hundred
mile trip gives me a fair estimate of the engine's appetite. 
I've made the loop so many times the landmarks are familiar even
on a rainy night.  But I-15 north of Indian Truck Trail is
territory I seldom travel.

I pass Indian Truck Trail shortly after five a.m.  The trucks
have vanished, having taken the shorter I-215 north.  Unfamiliar
with the route and in no rush, I'm content to swap certainty for
time.  And while I'm in no hurry, everyone else is.  Even at this
early hour the four-lane freeway has become dense with commuters
sucked from suburban beds in Temecula, Murrieta and Elsinore by
the lemming-urge of a regular paycheck, or a desire to live where
the air is not brown and drive-by shootings happen only on
weekends.  The rain is heavy but traffic is moving about seventy-
five miles per hour.  I'm doing better than sixty but I'm the
slowest thing on the road.  A biker rockets past throwing a
rooster-tail of spray and seemingly vanishes, as does all else
before me.  I assume the freeway has taken a sudden dip and have
only a moment's warning before running into the waterfall.  It is
a  rain cell of tropical intensity, the deluge so great that even
on high the wipers -- and the Rain-X -- are useless.  Water
spurts from the overhead console and through the side-glass.  I'm
in a tin box being pissed on by a thousand angry elephants.

A white station wagon was zooming past at a rate of knots.  When
it hit the water it lurched, as if a tire had blown and swerved
into my lane, decelerating rapidly.  No brake lights.  Indeed, no
lights at all!  I couldn't stop.  The bus was surfing, the tires
barely touching the road.  I accelerated, signaled, snapped into
the #3 lane, cutting off an angry pair of headlights but missing
the white station wagon that continued across traffic to the
shoulder and out of sight astern as I moved back into the slow
lane.  A blue Toyota zipped alongside, flew formation with his
cockpit light on to make sure I could see the bird he was
flipping me.  

The rain cell was as small as it was intense and the stream of
traffic punched through with little trouble.  Coming out of it, I
acquired a mascot, a pair of headlights clinging to my sixty mile
per hour coat-tails as the mad rush swirled past.  The headlights
were close together, the vehicle one of those tiny things driven
by people who can't afford a real car.  I guessed it to be a
commuter unnerved by the encounter with the rain cell, seeking
the security of the bus' stately progress as I piloted the blocky
vehicle through the storm.  

The lights stayed with me as we dropped down into Corona, stayed
with me into the mixmaster of the 91 interchange and the signs:
LA, thisaway, Barstow, thataway.  Suddenly we were alone.  No one
wanted to go to Barstow at five a.m. on a Tuesday morning. 
Except me and my mascot.

Coming out of the interchange we picked up more traffic,
including trucks.  The flow thickened to the clotting point but
was again swept away, this time by the I-10, which sucked my
mascot off my stern, swirled her up and over and away to some
mindless task in Los Angeles, fifty miles and more than two hours
away, for the arteries of the Los Angeles basin are clogged to a
mind-numbing crawl by six a.m.

Once past the I-10, the old bus began climbing the alluvial fan
leading into the mountains and Cajon Pass, the 4,200 foot gateway
to the high desert.  I passed the Highway 66 off-ramp, a
surviving appendix of the famous Route 66 from Chicago to Los
Angeles.  There is only one good pass through the mountains.  For
the next fifty miles I would be traveling the modern analog of
that Depression Era ribbon of concrete.  But I would get no
kicks.

Except for me and few trucks, the six lanes pointing north were
incongruously empty, unused, a prodigious waste of effort.  But
coming toward us was a river of white light, a million commuters
pouring down the pass.  They live in the high desert and drive up
to a hundred miles each way to work. Heading home, they will pack
all six lanes, desperate to return to their cardboard houses,
plastic furniture and evenings of canned laughter from the boob-
tube.  Such is the modern version of the Good Life.  As to why
they're willing to travel so far for so little, the high desert
communities have become virtual ghost-towns as a result of military
base closures.  A twenty-five hundred square foot house on a
quarter-acre lot can be had for as little as $100,000, dirt cheap
by southern California standards.  

The grade steepened as we neared the summit and full throttle
gave me only fifty miles per hour.  I was passing a steady stream
of trucks, other vehicles occasionally whizzing past in the
outside two lanes.  The gauges and my ear said the bus was
running fine.  I've added extra instruments that I feel are
necessary for proper engine management, mounting them in the
overhead console of the 1965 bus, positioned so the needles are
horizontal during normal operation.  I don't read the actual
values, merely note the position of the needles when scanning
them, an automatic thing.

I'd just flicked an eye toward the instruments when I flew into a
cloud.  And the cloud was filled with rain.  Still on automatic,
I reached for the carb heat control, forgetting I was in an old
Volkswagen bus and not an airplane.  And being in a bus, I was
also in near proximity to other things,  unseen in the white
buckshot hammering against the windscreen.  My headlights picked
out a reflector on the tail of a truck and I oozed past it
cautiously.  Visibility was less than twenty meters and the rain
was intense.  As quickly as we'd flown into it, the cloud
blew away and visibility opened up to a mile or more, showing a
long line of headlights coming toward me across the inside of a
slow descending curve.  

The rain slacked off as I crossed the summit.  The trucks shook
off the water, snorted their way into higher gears and passed me,
one by one.  My turn-off came up and I arched up and over old
Route 66 onto equally old Highway 395.

I stopped at the Outpost Cafe to refuel the bus and me.  I like
to run off the top of the fuel tank, and to take a break every
two hours or so.  It was ten minutes after six.  Despite the
weather, I'd logged one hundred and twelve miles in two hours, a
credible run for a thirty year old machine.  It took five and a
quarter gallons of gas -- 21 mpg -- to top off the tank.  Off to
the east a creamy smear of dawn was visible though breaks in the
black clouds.  It looked like the weather might be clearing.  
Inside the cafe, elbow to elbow with a counter full of truck
drivers, I ordered an omelet.  It's hard to screw up an omelet.  

Conventional Wisdom says the food is always better and the
waitresses always prettier at truck stops.  I've driven a truck
and know both are lies.  Truckers don't stop where the food is
good, they stop where there is room to park a sixty foot rig.  With a
captive audience, the food at truck stops is often warmed-over
garbage, slopped down in front of you by an ogre with a hairy
mole on her nose named Vera.  The waitress, that is. Not the
mole.

The Outpost Cafe isn't like that.  The young woman who served me,
promptly and without error, was pretty and vivacious without the
cloying folksiness affected by so many food servers.  But the
omelet was something of a trial.  It was a very good omelet but
only slightly smaller than a door mat, a hearty meal for a family
of four.  I snuck a peek at the truckers on either side,
wondering if I was expected to share.  The heavy-set Bubba-type
on my left was busy talking to his broker on his cell phone, the
remains of a plate of ham &amp; eggs before him.  The cowboy-type on
my right was eating a croissant while working the crossword
puzzle in the LA Times.  In ink.  So much for Conventional
Wisdom.

Knowing I wouldn't need to eat again for several days, I
staggered back to the bus and coaxed it out onto 395 from the
chain of lakes that formed the parking lot of the Outpost Cafe. 
Highway 395 runs from Mexico to Canada through what to me is the
most scenic part of our nation.  Despite the current weather
Indians call it 'The Land of Little Rain,' others call it The
Great American Desert and see little worth in its broad and
barren vistas, going there only to set-off the occasional atomic
bomb, dump their garbage or build shrines to avarice and greed. 
But I like the desert and always have, although I didn't know why
until after Vietnam.  I like the desert because it isn't jungle. 
And your eye can see as far as it can see.  Nobody sneaks up on
you in the desert.  But today my vista was limited to a gray
curtain of rain, visibility reduced to less than a mile.

Within a hundred meters of the cafe I saw the first Joshua Tree,
roughneck relative of the lily.  It was a welcome sight, one that
stirred old memories.  When I was a boy I tried to climb one. 
After all, people call them trees and climbing trees is something
boys are required to do as part of their rite of passage.  It was
a learning experience.  We don't have Joshua Trees in the low
desert nearer my home.  Like the boojums of Baja, Joshua Trees
are specialized things, picky about who they associate with and
where they put down roots.  

The high-desert wind was giving me trouble.  I reduced speed but
the gusts were still swatting the bus around.  The road is just a
two-lane ribbon but has generous shoulders.  I scooted over when
approached from astern, letting the truckers get on with the
nation's business.  At Kramer's Junction, where highway 58
crosses 395 at a precise ninety degrees, I hung a left and headed
west toward Tehachapi and the Pacific Ocean, if I were in surfing
mood.  The rain, heavy at times, continued.  Gray veils
descending like torn curtains from smoke-black clouds.  But the
wind seemed less and I was making good time.

Highway 58 isn't properly a freeway although it's better than
some.  Mostly divided road with two lanes in each direction, it
marks the northern boundary of Edwards Air Force Base, linking
such notable towns as Boron, North Edwards and Mojave before
snaking into the mountains past the useless forests of dismantled
wind machines, the environmentally correct boondoggle that served
only to enrichen a few politicians while killing a lot of hawks. 
Tehachapi sits in a pleasant valley near the summit.  The weather
was worse here, with heavier rain.  I began running into patches
of fog as I neared the town.  Then I realized it wasn't fog but
clouds.  Tehachapi Summit is above four thousand feet.

I got to Tehachapi just after 0900 and called Mark Stephens' shop
for directions.  Bill, the shop foreman and duty telephone-
answerer, asked what I was driving.  When I said a VW bus he
suggested gently I go back home, visit them another day,
explaining that the shop is on the end of several miles of
unpaved road and the unprecedented amount of rain had made access
extremely difficult.  &quot;I drive a van myself,&quot; Bill said.  &quot;And I
can't get it in here today.&quot;

Having come over two hundred miles it seemed only proper to at
least make an attempt to travel the last seven miles.  And having
been raised on a farm, I'm no stranger to mud.

Pavement took me as far as the oaken forest above Tehachapi, the
bare trees desolate and ghost-like, cloud-wrapped in veils of
fog.  When the pavement ended, so did the road signs and my first
attempt lead me to the very summit of the ridge, right through
the cloud layer only to find my way blocked by a fallen tree.  I
had lost my way in the smoke-dense cloud.  Turning the bus on the
narrow, muddy track took more luck than skill.  Coming down, I
realized the only tracks were mine.  I abandoned the imperfectly
copied directions and began following the most recent tracks in
the mud, having a number of adventures along the way.

The scrub-oak forests above Tehachapi cover some beautiful
country and it were summer this would be a pleasant and scenic
drive.  But in the cold February rain and ankle-deep mud, it took
me an hour to reach the shop.  Both the bus and I were a bit the
worse for wear at the end of it but the reward was worth the
effort.  I swapped the old Type 4 heads for a set of Stephens-
rebuilts and picked up a pair of absolutely beautiful 44x37 heads
for the Spyder engine.  Mark Stephens has a lot of racing
experience and knows the difference between what works and what
looks pretty.  I had a nice time chatting with Bill, and a
busman's holiday poking about the busy, well equipped shop.

Getting back to Tehachapi proved almost as difficult as getting
to the shop.  I'd spent an hour at the shop and the rain hadn't
let up the whole time.  The water was across the unpaved road at
two places, deeper now than before.  A couple of 4x4's, churning
their way to and from the shop had provided a good trail to
follow but made navigating the flooded parts more interesting
than before.  One section wiped me out twice, forcing me to roll
back down, find better traction and tackle it at a different
angle before I made it to the top.  The bus was mud-brown to the
doors by the time I was back on pavement.  The rain quickly
restored the original finish of chalky green and rusty red.

I refueled at Tehachapi and worked out the fuel consumption
figures.  This too is part of proper engine management.  If you
see your mileage beginning to dwindle it's pretty good evidence
your engine needs attention.  But I didn't believe the numbers. 
They said I'd gotten near forty miles to the gallon out of the
last batch of fuel.  Thinking I'd misread the odometer at the
last stop, I headed east for home on highway 58.  As I came down
from the hills onto the desert floor it felt as if I'd run into a
pillow.  The wind was so strong that full throttle gave me barely
50mph and the gusty wind warning signs posted along the highway
were not there just for show.  The mileage figures for the last
run were correct.  I'd been blown across the desert by a forty
mile per hour tail wind.

Staggering into the wind, the bus and I lurched toward Kramer's
Junction.  In Mojave, a sign had blown down near the Casa de Gasa
and the flags outside the 20 Mule Team Motel were standing
rigidly from their poles.  An RV was off the road near Boron, a
big fifth-wheel rig come to grief at the chicane across the
railroad tracks a few miles farther on.  But the wind cleared the
rain and I could see mountains fifty miles distant that you'd
swear were only a few minutes away.  Slowing for the turn at
Kramer's Junction, a pair of crows flashed past, echelon left,
rowing slow wing-beats in the soggy air yet flying faster than
kestrels.

The wind had been shifting slowly to the south, gaining in
intensity.  Turning south at Kramer's Junction put the wind dead
on the nose.  We did well enough in the wind shadows cast by the
rolly terrain but the wind would punch our speed down to forty when
we topped the roller-coaster swales.  With their higher profile, the
wind was effecting the big rigs even worse, as I discovered when
I caught up to them.  They were running nose to tail, passenger
cars and pickups darting out of the procession, looping their way
past the string of trucks like pawns on a backgammon board. 
Without enough power to play the game, I tucked the bus in behind
a moving van, enjoying a free ride as we were pulled along in its
wake.  Traveling in convoy, line astern, our speed was determined
by the slowest truck.  The thirty miles to the junction with I-15
took nearly an hour.  In that time the weather closed down again,
driven by a massive wall of dark clouds building to the
southwest.  The light went out of the sky and a heavy rain began
to fall.

I had told my wife I would be home shortly after noon but it was
already later than that.  I continued south without bothering to
refuel, knowing I could get close enough for the jerry can to
carry me home.  On I-15 above Cajon Pass the intensity and
turbulence of the wind caught me by surprise.  I could barely
maintain 45 mph but even at that the shaky steering needed inputs
of as much as forty-five degrees to keep me in my own lane. 
Tipping over the crest of the summit brought some relief from the
wind and my speed quickly built up.  But so too did the rain.

Forward visibility shut down as I re-entered the cloud layer,
dwindling to less than twenty meters.  The slow lane was closed
for repairs, traffic bunched up in the remaining three lanes, rain
coming in torrents.  I ran into a denser rain cell than the one
encountered that morning.  All around me cars had their emergency
flashers going.  A few sought refuge on the shoulder only to
encounter the markers closing off the outside lane.  Soon there
were toppled markers littering the roadway.  Over in the fast
lane a blue Volkswagen screamed past at an insane speed.  It was one
of those real kewl bugs, lowered, windows tinted black, Cal-
looked, shaved and equipped with lots of tail pipes.  The deck
lid was propped about six inches away from the body, a trick of
marginal value on the drag strip, worthless on the street and a
definite no-no when driving through a torrential downpour at
ninety miles an hour.

Cars littered the shoulder.  The rain was coming down so heavily
it couldn't flow away fast enough.  We were on a six percent
grade yet there an inch of water on the roadway.  At the 138 off-
ramp a white coupe was in the weeds, headlights pointing this
way, the driver standing beside it oblivious to the pounding
rain, peering at the car quizzically as if waiting for it to
right itself.  

Incredibly, below the pass the rain was even heavier,
obliterating all forward vision.  There was two inches of water
on the roadway and the shoulder was flooded.  The noise of the
water on the nose of the bus was deafening.  The wiper broke,
hammered to one side, lay there twitching until I shut it off.  A
tour bus lurched into my lane toward the shoulder throwing up a
tremendous bow wave.  The wave hit my bus, ripping off the air-
scoop on the left side, punching me onto the flooded shoulder. 
Water squirted from the overhead console and dribbled across the
dash, oozing in through the lower corners of the windscreen.  My
feet were wet from water driven up around the pedals and gear
shift.  I skied along in the wake of the tour bus, managed to
avoid it only because its tires squeegeed a track for mine to
gain the traction they needed to pull back onto the roadway.

The water blown into the engine compartment by the wave from the
bus now appeared on the inside of my windscreen as steam.  I
rubbed it frantically as I struggled to avoid the gaggle of
vehicles that seemed to be as disoriented as me.  And there was
the blue bug, flooded out, dead, off the shoulder of the fast
lane.  There IS a God.

We drove out of the storm cell suddenly into a world of water. 
Trucks had sought the refuge of the shoulder and the world seemed
filled with blinking yellow lights, diffuse through the spray,
for cars continued to race past at far too fast a speed, like
children playing in a mud puddle.  I would of stopped if I
thought I could do so safely but the splits at the 10 and 91
forced me to run in the number three lane.  With traffic on both
sides, I felt it best to maintain my course and speed.

By the time we reached Norco the pavement was no longer
underwater although brown lakes had appeared in every swale
beside the freeway.  Traffic was much lighter, too, the weather
having performed a kind of natural selection.  All of the smaller
cars had vanished leaving only trucks and heavier vehicles on the
road.  And one old Volkswagen bus.

As I climbed out of Corona the sky cleared and for a moment I
caught a patch of blue off to the east.  But overhead remained a
confusion of clouds, slate to sooty blue, stratified or
flocculent depending on their elevation, the hills a ragged black
border below.  In a month this will be a green and flowering land
and only the hills will remember rain.

I stopped near Lake Elsinore and drained the jerry can into the
tank.  Parked well off the road, the bus at a steep angle, water
leaked from it in a constant dribble, from the cargo bay and
cockpit and even the engine compartment, which showed signs of
having been flooded.  Yet through it all the engine had never
faltered, the faithful throb of its exhaust never changing.

I tightened down the wiper blade where it had spun on the shaft
but there was nothing I could do about the missing air scoop. 
The twin scoops create an over-pressure of about 1psi in the
engine compartment, sufficient to maintain a steady flow of air
through the oil cooler which is ducted to the low pressure area
behind the left rear wheel.  With only one air scoop the oil ran
ten degrees warmer than usual.  I kept an eye on it as I motored
home.  

Having experienced such heavy rain I was worried about the
condition of the shop.  With its earthquake-damaged foundation,
heavy run-off defeats the berm I've thrown up and water comes
inside.  But the farther south I traveled, the less evidence
there was of any rain at all.  At the low spot in Deer Creek
canyon there wasn't even a puddle.  When I reached the house and
carried the heads into the shop, the floor was dry.  Out back of
the shop the rain gauge had captured less than a tenth of inch
since the day before.  

I unloaded my tools before parking the bus down in the field
below the house and went up to start supper.  The 440 mile trip
had taken twelve and a half hours.
