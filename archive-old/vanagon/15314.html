Subject: Temperature sensor II in '77

Has anyone had experience with a faulty temperature sensor II on their Bus?
Mine has been stalling after driving for maybe 15-20 miles, when I idle. Some-
times the oil light flashes but the motor keeps on, and the slightest pressure
on the accelerator gives perfect idle RPM. After cooling down the idle is fine
until it gets hot, but even then not every single time.

So I suspect a temp sensor. The one on the cylinder head in my bus is not
easily accessable (as is stated by Bently), rather it seems to be covered
by the metal shield over the heads where the spark plug wires connect to the 
plugs. 

Has anyone had similar symptoms with a faulty sensor or is there something I
am overlooking?

Mucho TIA
