Subject:      well, fooey!

some of you sent me some off-list mail earlier tonight, and dufus-fingers
here wiped it out before looking at it. :(  i didn't even see who it was
from, so anybody who thinks they did, please resend it.

sorry to bomb the list with it but i'm pretty sure it was some of you
degenerates out there that did it. Ed McMahon ain't got no internet access
yet, has he??? :)
