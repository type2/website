I was tootling home from work yesterday, cranking along, an I hear this
noise.

Whenever I get the bus up to spped, I get this tweety-whitle sound from
&quot;back there&quot; and I've learned to block it out.  It should go away when I get
everything buttoned down and all...

But this time it got loud, REAL loud.  So I put the clutch in, and start 
to coast, trying to figure out what it is, and its gettign even LOUDER!

I'm just about in panic stage right now, thinking my engine is about to
self destruct, and then I look back and upward thru the sunroof and
see the KC-135 overhead into Mc Lellan, and my heartrate starts to return
to normal, everyone starts laughing at me and I always fall for that one...
