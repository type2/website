Repellancy can be much improved a lot if you spray two cans of Scotchgard
(silicone fabric spray) on it at the start of the season.   We've not had
any problems with water soaking through (no camping in gale-force winds
yet, though).

&gt;that your experience is that it doesnt keep out the weather? or are you
&gt;just being extra carfull?

&gt;Dave,
&gt;
&gt;You don't need to be carefull...  you'll just get wet.  Anyways, my
&gt;experience is the canvas does soak through in what I would call a moderate
&gt;amount of rain.  Its just a &quot;water repellant&quot; treated canvas.  If the rain
&gt;is being driven by the wind you can accually feel the water come through
&gt;the sides.
&gt;
&gt;One of my ideas is to use two layers of a rubber treated nylon  with an
&gt;insulation blanket between them.  My goal is to have something to cut out
&gt;the weather and wind and also to help retain heat inside the van.  I'm
&gt;looking for something that can stop the rain, but I am also planning on
&gt;camping in Idaho and Montana this winter.   So I would like to retain as
&gt;much heat as possible with the top up.
&gt;
&gt;Enjoy,
