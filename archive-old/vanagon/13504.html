&gt; My warranty expires in 1997. When that happens, what should I do?  
&gt; 
&gt; I am contemplating suicide.

Sell it and buy a RWD camper, though an unfortunate thing to do
it is your only real solution if you wish to remain sane.
After our '86 Vanagon dad briefly flirted with an '88 (I think)
Syncro out of warranty but only with 28,000 miles and we had
known the previous owner, bought it used from the dealer, tranny
blew to kingdom come a week after we had it and he considered himself
lucky to be able to return for full refund.  I went the Syncro route
myself with a '86 Quantum, no viscous coupling but still extreme
rarity in the U.S., It was the best VW I have ever driven but after
taking it from 70,000 to 150,000 miles I decided there was no way
I could keep up with the repair costs since all parts were dealer
$$$ only even if I did all the work myself.
