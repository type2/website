Subject: Re: Syncro Tire Rotation

rounded outside edges.
&gt;
&gt;So here's my question:  Should I have the tires rotated again, this time
&gt;dismounting them from the wheels and flipping them so that the relatively
&gt;unworn inside becomes the outside? Or will this just be a waste of
&gt;time/money? These are fairly aggressive tires with only about 20K miles on
&gt;them, and part of what I am wondering is whether my snow traction be better
&gt;with more tread to the outside of the tire (it seemed as if I had better
&gt;snow traction when the tires were new)?
&gt;
&gt;Any Thoughts?
&gt;
&gt;Paul


   Just remember that once you've worn a tire in a certain direction, that
you Keep the tire rotating in the same direction!  

  I've seen what happens to tires that have been mistreated in this manner,
NOT a pretty sight!
