Howdy,

	I was holding back any type of nastiness toward my previous 
employer, 'cause  was hoping to get a WORM of my home directory.

	He's decided not to give it to me, so those of you that have 
offered to help me persue &quot;alternate channels of satisfaction&quot; may go
forth and have fun.

	Those addresses again are:

	cmark_at_tim_dot_com
	thenderson_at_tim_dot_com
	trans_at_netcom_dot_com

	Thanks for the help!

Thom
