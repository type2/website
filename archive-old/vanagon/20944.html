&gt;why not call it after your favorite composer?? like Tchaikovsky ... it's
&gt;loud, and it's a euroPEANIST. :)

&gt;Rusty says:
&gt;For awhile I thought of calling it &quot;Butch&quot; after Butch Trucks one of the
Allman Brothers Band (when they were good). I also thought of calling it
&quot;Bungee&quot; due to the methodology behind fourth gear. Tchaikovsky just takes
too many brain cells. Besides, the truck rides like the Rollins Band sounds.
Take that for what its worth! Ask your kids they'll clue you in. ;)
