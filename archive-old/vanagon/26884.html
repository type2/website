&gt;Also, I'm considering (only considering) selling this well maintained, 4
&gt;spd, tornado red beauty as I get ready to send a second child to college.
&gt;I'm sure my priorities must be screwed up here.  Can I get an idea of what
&gt;a vehicle like this might sell for.

Send the child to college in the van, cuts down on dorm fees, a good Coleman 
stove and monthly shipments of K-D (kraft dinner) and you can still keep the 
van! Tuition?  Oh well, maybe not then..... sell the child?

I'm curious.  I bought my first new GL in 1986 (an '86) and over the next
&gt;five years  I experienced 4 gas tank implosions. At 30k, 34k, 48k, and 55k

Wild, never heard of it, must be a plugged vent, VW would surely fix that 
with tank replacement.  You using a fuel pump out of a Rolls-Royce turbo-jet 
engine or something? &lt;g&gt;  Tim Smith
