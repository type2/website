&gt;Mike Benthin:   (quoting myself)
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Otherwise, if I'm not on a hill, I get underneath with my
&gt;&gt;trusting 14g wire with alligator clips on each end and
&gt;&gt;attach one end to the pull-off connector on the solenoid
&gt;&gt;(red wire goes to it), and touch the other end to the HOT
&gt;&gt;terminal from batter to starter- it should try to kick over.
&gt;
The comments on not lying under a vehicle that could roll over me are well
taken- HOWEVER, I don't START the vehicle this way (well OK, I have, but
made SURE it was in neutral and someone had foot on brake.), I usually just
TOUCH the wire for a second to make solenopid click, THEN squirm out to try
car- 99% of time it will start.  Just banging with a hammer on the solenoid
usually works also......When working under my vehicle I always use wheel
blocks front and rear and Jackstands or cinderblocks along with jack left
in place.   Mike Benthin
