Subject: Pop Top &quot;Loaf&quot; for sale

Someone might want to also share this with our type2 brothers and sisters -

Seen in San Jose on Bascomb Ave.  (500 block, just north of Valley Med.
center) is a &quot;mango&quot; loaf with a pop top.  When I saw it last week end, the
top was up and driving by, the canvas looked in good shape.  Similarly,
noted that the front and right side of the bus appeared in good shape,
paint oxidized, but apparently intact.  Have no idea of mechanical
condition of drive train or interior, but seller has a sign asking $600 obo.

That's about all I know about this vehicle.

Harvey
