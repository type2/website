Subject: Vanagon Tire Information -- Tires &amp; Companies

In December, I purchased a 91 Westfalia and the original equipment tires needed
replacing.   I talked to numerous tire dealers and everyone wanted to put 
me in a passenger car tire with no consideration for load carrying 
capacity or suggested tire pressure.  I even had dealers suggest I put 40 
lbs of air in tires that had a maximum rating of 35 lbs.  I knew enough not 
to do that, so my search for tire information started.  This is my first 
experience with a Vanagon so I scanned the net looking for help.  I found 
Harry Yates web page and he directed me to this list and I have read the 
archives, and your current comments about Vanagon tires.  After talking to
dealers and manufacturers, I have some information which has helped me and 
may be of interest to anyone looking to replace tires.

My Vanagon's door sticker suggest two tire sizes:
185 R14 C  6 PR with tire pressure of 43 lbs front and 53 lbs rear
205/70 R14  97R with tire pressure of 30 lbs front and 40 lbs rear

The C 6 PR in the 185 R14 tire stands for a load range C tire with a 6 
ply rating.  The 97 in the 205/70 R14 tire is a load index rating that 
equates to a load carrying capacity at maximum inflation pressure of 
approximately 1600 lbs.  According to VW technical support people (800 number),
any replacement tire should have a load carrying capacity of
approximately 1600 lbs when properly inflated for the rear.

The real problem is that VW contracted with one or two companies to 
make a tire &quot;specifically&quot; designed for the rim size and weight of the 
Vanagon.  For example, Michelin made the MXL in many sizes, but they only 
made a reinforced version in the 205/70 R14 size which fit the Vanagons.
Finding a replacement tire with the recommended load carrying capacity 
at the correct air pressure only becomes a problem if we don't
want to replace the tires with the original tire or if the 
manufacturer discontinues the tire.

Some of you suggested a 195/75 R14 as an alternative tire and I 
wondered what the width and height difference between the three tire 
sizes were.  For one tire manufacturer, the differences are:

				Inflated		Inflated
				Width (inches)		Diameter (inches)
		185 R14		7.8			25.7		
		195/75 R14	7.8			25.6
		205/70 R14	8.1			25.4

Finding tires with the VW recommended load carrying capacity in those three
sizes became a short term hobby (compulsion) and the following is what I 
found for &quot;all season&quot; type tires.  Besides each manufacturer is their toll 
free customer assistance number.  While I tried to do a thorough check,
it is possible I missed a tire from the manufacturers I called since 
technical support reps knowledge of their own tire line varied (that is 
another story in itself).

Goodrich and Uniroyal  (800-521-9796),  Dunlop (800-334-4646), and 
Goodyear (800-321-2136), said they had no all season tires with the 
load carrying capacity recommended by VW--at least not in those three sizes.

Bridgestone 	800-847-3272  (U.S.A.)    800-267-1318 (Canada)

	603V    185 R14 C 
	This C range tire has 1570 lbs carrying capacity at 50 lbs of air 
	pressure and 1390 lbs capacity at 40 lbs of air pressure.

	603V   185 R14 D
	This D range tire has 1850 lbs carrying capacity at 65 lbs air 
	pressure and 1430 lbs at 45 lbs air pressure.


Michelin 	800-847-3435

	MXL Reinforced   205/70 R14	
	Original tire on many Vanagons.  97 load index and 1580 load 
	carrying capacity at 40 lbs.  They will not manufacture any 
	more of these tires but a few are still at dealers and in 
	warehouses.  I'd stay away from these since if you ruin a tire 
	in a year of two, you will have a lot of trouble finding 
	a replacement.

	MXT Reinforced   205/70 R14     
	A tire they have just started importing from Europe to 
	replace the MXL.  Some are already in the Michelin distribution 
	warehouses and the load index is 99 with a 1709 load carrying 
	capacity at approximately 50 lbs. air pressure (they didn't have 
	precise inflation information). Michelin said they don't use all season 
	designation in Europe so these tires aren't officially rated as all 
	season, although the tread pattern is an all season one and looks like 
	their MX4 tire.  Supposedly, this tire has been sold in Europe 
	for years.

	XC4S    185 R14 C
	Michelin's one suggested application for this tire in their manual 
	is the Vanagon.  The carrying  capacity is 1710 lbs. at 55 lbs. 
	air pressure.


Yokohama 	800-231-9987 (Texas)
	
	Y370G     LT 195/75 R14  Load Range D
	This tire has a load carrying capacity of 1710 lbs at 65 lbs of 
	air pressure, 1530 lbs carrying capacity at 55 lbs of air pressure, 
	and 1435 lbs of carrying capacity at 45 lbs of air pressure.  
	As many of you know, Harry Yates likes this tire and says it is 
	an &quot;excellent&quot; all season tire.


If you have experience with any of these tires,  it would be great if you 
would share it with the rest of us.
