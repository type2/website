&gt;Hi. Read with interest your post on oil pressure. Any suggestions on the
&gt;gauge? TIA.

Michael,

I would recommend a tube-type guage.  You can get them at almost any
autoparts store.  They are all pretty much the same in quality.  The
exception is the high quality guages with big name brands.  They claim to be
the best, I think they are just over-priced.  

Anyway, an oil pressure guage can connect to the oil pressure sensor where
the pressure is measured and then relay the information electronically to the
guage in your dash.  

A tube or capilary guage hooks directly to you oil pressure sensor on the
engine and feeds the oil through a thin tube all the way to the guage in the
dash.  The guage then measures the pressure and gives you a reading.  It is
more accurate because there is no 'electrical middle man' to foul up the
accuracy of the reading.

Having been through enough oil pressure problems (VW, Mercedes, etc...) I
can't tell you how important it is to know EXACTLY what the oil is doing when
it comes to your crank and camshafts.
