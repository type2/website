I too run the KYB's with LT Michelins.  Rides like on rails.....well
like a &quot;Bus on Rails&quot;.  I encourge you to check with Bus Depot.

&gt; I've had KYBs on my '87 for some years with good luck. See the Bus
&gt; Depot web
&gt; page for sale prices - about $28 last I checked.
&gt;
&gt; For a real budget Rocky Mountain Motor Works now lists Brazilian
&gt; shocks for
&gt; Vanagon at about $16-18. No idea how they work, but not much to invest
&gt; and
&gt; easy to change.

&gt; I'm interested in the Readers experience on specific shocks.  I would
&gt; like some very HD, non air shocks.  I am open to suggestions and have
&gt; a
&gt; frugal budget.
