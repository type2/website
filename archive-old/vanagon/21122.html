Subject: Re: Problem w/temp gauge

I was checking the plugs the other day - all tan and brown with gaps
slightly larger than normal. I regapped and cleaned them and the idle and
acceleration improved dramatically. These are w7cc plugs which are one
step cooler than called for...they seem to do the trick..even though they
are not listed in any of the FAQs for any of the Vanagon years...



Anyway, removing no.3 plug was tricky as usual because this is the one with
the head temp sensor. I found that the sensor's two wires had both their 
covers rubbed off at the point where the tin contacts them. A bit of
permatex combined with electrical tape covered them back up but I doubt
this will last long since the heat is tremendous. The readings
seem the same as before.
Related to this: has anyone else noticed the short time span of spark plug
boots on the air-cooled Vanagons?

Also, I do not recommend putting the sensor at the FI head temp sensor
location because the readings will be significantly lower at  that point
and may give a false sense of security. That is the head at that point
reads in the range of 200-225F.
