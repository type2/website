Subject: HELP 1985 Westy Losing Power

Lost power I40 outside of Albuq. New Mx, van would not build RPMS. After
stopping replacing a vaccum line on the fuel regulator, ran OK. Lost
ignition in Arizona, replaced Hall sender in distributor and Hall generator
(control unit) Power problem reapeared in Nevada running north on 95. Seems
after an overnight stop, it ran normal. I cleaned all the ground
connections but it did not seem to help. The power lose was not a surging
(like a fuel filter or pump) However, I did experience a surge(fuel or
ignition?) at one point, but only lasted a few secs. I have done most of
the elecrical test according to Bentley, all OK. Note I was pulling a
trailer/motorcycle.I am touring the westy coast now on the bike will pick
the van up later outside on Reno.
Need Suggestions:
1. Should I replace the fuel pump/ filters?
2. Think the Control Unit (Brain) is causing the problem?
3. Could the altitude cause the problem?
4. Know anyone in the area of Reno tht could find the problem?
5. Anyone have a used control unit? Complete elecrtical?
I will be checkiing my E-mail before I leave Seattle in the next few days.
