Subject: Rust spots

I remember seeing a discussion earlier about removing mud flaps.  
Someone was saying that there were several screws to remove, some
of them inside the fender.  They said they needed their child's arm
to reach inside to hold the nut while they refastened it.

This weekend, I was preping my '89 Westy to be sandblasted to fix some
rust spots around the valve covers and one by the mud flap.  There were
only 4 screws holding it on and one of them was missing.  Two of the screws
went from inside the body (where I couldn't reach them), through the body
and into the mudflap.  They looked like ordinary wood screws.  I have no
idea how someone reached down inside the body to fasten them in the first place.
There was some kind of rubber gastket or grommet around the screw that was holding
it into the metal of the body.  After about half an hour of trying to figure out
how to get them out, I just pulled and the screw and the rubber gasket came out.
I think I'm just going to clean up the rust, fill the holes and paint it over
since I'm doing the whole side panel. 

Another problem I noticed, while preparing for sandblasting, was the valve for water.
The access cover is to the rear of the other two.  I was able to get access to the
first two from inside (electricity and gas) by removing the fridge, but the one
for water is behind the cabinet and there is a back panel on the cabinet.  Short
of removing all of the cabinets from the Westy, is there someway to get access to 
the water attachement from inside?  I was considereing cutting an access hatch in
the back panel.

Anyone have any comments?
