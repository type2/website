Subject:       Re: Crazy Man with Parts Stash (long)

&gt; injection tester.  Says he wants $3000 for all the parts and if he 
&gt; doesn't sell in a month, he will send 'em to the crusher!  Doesn't want 
&gt; to give out his phone number (unless you are serious about buying it all) 
&gt; and doesn't want to have to dig out specific parts.  He won't drag it to 
&gt; a swap meet and appears to just want to get rid of it (for a price).  He 
&gt; says he won't crush the Notch, but will the rest.  I offered to run ads 
&gt; in the newsletter and on the Net, but he wasn't interested and didn't 
&gt; want people calling just to talk.  Anybody out there want to cough up 3 
&gt; grand to save this stuff?  I sure can't.

Well this guy wants the world for free and he wants it now dammit!!!

What kind of guy is this?  If he was seriously thinks that it is 
worth $3k, then he'd never crush it.  Sounds like a classic selling 
tactic.  Stoopid.

If he _really_ did want to sell it, he'd:

A) Give out his number far and wide to answer questions and sell 
parts.
B) Sell parts singly (easiest way to sell the stuff!)
C) If he wants good $$$ for it, take it to swap meets.
D) Sell it all for a dirt cheap price.

Why crush it when you could sell it for _ANY_ amount over what you'd 
get back in scrap metal value?

It doesn't add up.  But then again does anything ever add up other 
than my bills?
