Back from Quan Yin:  I agree with you Chris and would absolutely terminate
their coverage if their tickets were anything more than minor.  Same policy
for even being near substances (when driving) and seat belt issues (they
never go without).  And actually, factually the only reason to continue them
under my coverage is that to obtain it independently is even more expensive.
And do remember I wasn't whining or complaining (altho i do have a black belt
in both and can demonstrate special proficiency) I was just offering numbers
to the group to appreciate how other's insurance may be relatively
inexpensive.
Regards, QuanYinLyn
