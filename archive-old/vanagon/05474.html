Subject: Drinking Water Dump Valve

Dave, 

Excellent job on the hot water heater. This installation is the most elegant
solution to a problem that plagues us all and I plan to follow you. Over
time, this concept should become a model for all Wesfalia owners to follow
because it is so logical, elegant, and just plain right. 

Another thought:

All we need now is an electric valve positioned in the bottom of the drinking
water tank which will open should the water reach 34 degrees or below. This
way, we would never have to worry about the drinking water freezing on us
during those periods that the vehicle is not being driven, and hence not
warming the water. 

The valve would open and dump the contents of the tank. Do you think your
Granger valve would accomplish this task? Also, we need to select an
appropriate thermostat for this mission.
