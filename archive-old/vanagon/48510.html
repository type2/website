Subject: Re: Free Camping book still available ?



&gt;We traveled for about 4 months in our '76 Riviera camper back in 
&gt;'84. An in valuable resource we had was a book, that I think was 
&gt;titled &quot;Free Camping&quot; that listed as you would expect places that 
&gt;had free camping.  Listed small towns that had a small central 
&gt;park (enticing one to eat and spend locally), community parks, 
&gt;forest service camps, etc.  After our trip I passed the book on to 
&gt;another fellow cheap traveller.  Anybody know if this book is 
&gt;still in print, available??  BTW spent on average of $5 per WEEK 
&gt;for camping, mostly to get a shower.

As my wife and I will soon be leaving for our cross-country trip in 
an '83-1/2 Westy, I, too, would be very interested to learn of such 
a book.  If anyone knows of it, please post it to the list as a 
whole.
Thanks,
