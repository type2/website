I'm only on the list for one reason and do not recommned splitting it into
smaller groups. Consider it a &quot;social science&quot; experiment. Probablity
theory predicts that eventually this list will make a significant
contribution to humankind. Until then, and no matter how long it
takes, we cannot split the list. The risk is too great. We owe it
to our children and their children and to future generations

The reasoning is simple: Remember
the old adage: if you locked a 100 monkeys in a room with typewriters
that eventually they would type out the entire range of Shakespearean
sonnets?  Well by the same logic 400 of us (or whatever the heck the
numbers are) are bound to collectively produce something intelligent
eventually.
