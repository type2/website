Subject: 1990 Truck Dependability Survey

I saw this in the Data section of the March 27, 1995 issue of Autoweek.
It's interesting that the Vanagon (I assume they're talking about Vanagons)
is a truck though not imported as so.

Nissan and Toyota are tied for best overall truck line for dependability for
model-year 1990.  That's according to a new J.D. Power and Associates survey
of nearly 12,000 original owners of 5-year-old trucks.  As the chart above
shows, their score was 109, 17 above the industry average of 92.  Nameplates
below the industry average are (in alphabetical order) Chrysler, Dodge, Geo,
Isuzu, Jeep, Oldsmobile, Plymouth, Pontiac and Suzuki.  Land Rover was not
included because its sample size was too small.
