Ok,Ok...So I haven't actually got up the courage to cut the bent up nose
off the bus yet, and have been instead tinkering around the new motor and
figuring out a few -minor- modifications...

Purists, wait a minute before you get the `lectronic gallows as I do preface
this by stating up front....No whale tails on this bus no matter WHAT the
crosswinds are like...;-)

I need feedback on a coupla matters which I think I've resolved (or figured
out) but my logic is such that it always helps to have a few &quot;grounded&quot;
individuals to walk me through my serpentine theories..

Prologue:  The following is in reference to my 66 bus (in case my previous
posts were lost/ignored/forgotten,etc.,etc.) which I am in the process of
restoring/tailoring for my specific needs... While I would love to drive
around in a fully restored 66 Samba which would vie with any other Deluxe
for the cover of VWT, I have this time set my hopes a bit lower. I am going
instead for the nice utilitarian van type look..No butcher, but maybe a
non-nos item here or there... ie...

Item 1: My gas gauge is dead, the sender unit in the tank however, is Ok.
        The Bus has only one cut-out for a gauge (just left of the speedo)
        and I'd like to use it for my cyl head temp gauge...So...
        I happened to have a later model type 1 Speedo head with an integral VDO
        fuel gauge (and a bevy of idiot lights) which I rebuilt (and reset to
        -0- for my new engine) which after much sleuthing and crosswiring I
        got to function perfectly. This BTW for anyone who may consider doing
        this kinda swap, is a real simple conversion. Look at the next VW meet
        for a post 71 type 1 speedo head. It comes with the basic idiot lights
        for gen/alt and oil pres., plus lights for rear defrost,atf level, high
        and low beam lights.  The high beam indicator I kept. I intend to shift
        my oil temp idiot light to the rear defrost light, and keep the hdlight
        idiot open for future expansion.

Question 1,2: I measured the circumferance (sp?) of my tire(s) on both the bus
        which has 14&quot; rims, but 185 radials, against my beetle which has 15&quot;
        rims and 165 radials and they are within 1.0&quot;..As far as I can tell by
        doing the 60mph marker to marker test on the interstate I'm close to
        actual speed...ie, 60mph on the speedo is approx 60mph..takes basically
        1 minute to get from one mile marker to the next... Am I right? or are
        my basic physics off? The tires on the beetle are a lower profile than
        the tires on the bus..I guess this makes up for the difference in the
        actual rim circumference?
        Based on question 1, I'm wondering _IF_ I am off on my basic calculation
        how (if possible) I can adjust the speedo head to compensate for the
        difference...

Item 2: My local &quot;U-Pull-It&quot; junk yard has a few late model busses (by which I
        mean mid 70's) with the full width rear seats. As this one did not come
        with either the middle or the rear (and as I have nothing other than a
        few mount plate holes on my floorboard as reference) I was curious if
        any knew if the seat frames were similiar in construction. The reason is
        if they were (as the front seats are) I'd simply snag a seat frame and
        then recover it with replacement vintage nauga-vinyl from sew-fine or
        some other...

Item 3: My bus is a converted 6 volt `66. That is, the lights, gen, bat, and the
        basic assorted stuff is, but the wiper motor and the infamous vdo clock
        are still 6 volt. I plan to snag the 12v wiper assembly out of my parts
        67, but am wondering what to do for the clock? Are the step-down units
        available for wiper motors sensitive enough for the clock?

Many thanks in advance....
