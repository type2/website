Hello Vanagon Gang,
I'd just like to report to all those who sent me words of encouragement
about trying to find a job that I have finally found a position.  My
email address will remain the same, however, for now.  The relationship
to the list:  I'll drive the vanagon there after I fix the sink. :)
Thanks, gang!
Stuart
