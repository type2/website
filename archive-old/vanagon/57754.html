Subject: Fridge Woes

In preparing for the upcoming camping season (my first with this bus), I
tried all the appliances in my bus.  The stove works fine. The fridge
worked great on 110v but I couldn't get it to work on LP.

I tried starting it several times with no luck.  I uncorked the drain tube
beneath the fridge but it was bone dry.  In the start up procedure for LP
operation the manual states the following:  &quot;press the button for LP gas
operation - the electronic gas ignitor is working. This will make a ticking
noise and at the same time the indicator light will flash.&quot;  In my attempts
to light the fridge I never got a &quot;ticking&quot; noise and never got the
indicator light to light or flash.

Any thoughts, possible solutions, probable causes out there?

Thanks
