Subject: low temp and howling

1. Since it started getting a little cool outside my temp gauge has been 
reading very low.  Is there any way of finding out whether my temp 
is really low or the sender is bad?  Are there any dire consequences of 
running the car with the temp not high enough?  Will the water temp 
that's being measured here affect the combustion process?
Sometime's it's up near the center, but most of the time it's just 
barely above the mark at about 1/4 the gauge.

2.  I've got a strange howling in my engine compartment that I can't hear 
when I open the engine compartment.  I only hear it from the passenger 
compartment.  It's always there, and starts when I start the engine.  It 
doesn't vary with engine RPM.  It sounds like a howl at C-sharp an octave 
above middle C.  Can anyone think of something that might cause a 
constant sound - moving or not?

Thanks.
