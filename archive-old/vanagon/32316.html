&gt; A few years ago VW produced and distributed a list of the
&gt; LAST air-cooled inventory they had available.  I have to
&gt; assume that there is very little VW-produced material still
&gt; available to us as owners of vintage VWs (directly from VW,
&gt; that is)
&gt;

VW still stocks a lot of NOS AC parts, it is kinda reserved for
people who visit the Wolfsburg Museum, they have somebody who
looks after that. The stock consists of left-overs and stocks
that are bought back from VW-importers and VW-plants worldwide.
Besides that you'll be amazed by what the dealers still stock,
i dont know about VWoA and its dealers of course, but often my
dealer is even cheaper than the FLAPS.
The only thing is, when you're an OBG of the purest kind,
(Original-Bolt-Guy) watch out, a lot of things are replaced
by newer numbers, in other words it's not exactly original,
especially in the N-numbers (nuts, bolts, washers etc.)

Brian.
