Subject: vanagon engine lid

This weekend for the first time I hefted the old and new (metal and plastic,
respectively) versions of the vanagon engine lid side by side.  I hadn't
realized how much lighter the plastic one is.  Those of you (eg Westy
owners) who lift off the the cover rather than rocking it back against the
seat should keep an eye open for a plastic lid in wrecking yards.

In related news, my release 1.0 engine lid, with an 8-inch high &quot;hat&quot;
on it to clear a Porsche engine, is available.  Over the weekend I 
implemented release 2.0, based on a plastic lid, and with a lower 5-inch
hat since I've got my Porsche engine installed lower than stock height.
Anyone in metro NY area contemplating a Porsche coversion, my lid would
save you one fabrication step, and would clear either carbed or FI Porsche
sixes from 2.0 to 3.0 liters.
