Subject:      Synthetic Oils

I have been enjoying the discussion on oils.  I am amazed at the knowledge
on the list.  One more question - can you mix synthetic oils.  If you can,
if you mix 5-50 with 10-30 in 50/50 proportions, do you get 7.5-40?

I have been running Castrol Syntec for several years now.  I cannot make up
my mind about 5-50 vs 10-30, so can I mix them?

Thanks,
