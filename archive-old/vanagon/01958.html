Never dipdawick with someone who sniffs airwick!

Actually, airwick was this hideous smelling &quot;airfresshener&quot;
sold in the 60s and 70s in the civilized part of the
world, and still a major airfreshener and food product in
places like, for instance, Alabama. It consisted of this
pint bottle of colored, smelly liquid to which this wick
was dipped into. Actually the wick had this metal frame
to keep it erect...you popped off the cap and then
raised the wick (wow...one could get a number of
different meanings from this...) and the liquid would
evaporate and make your trailer or room smell &quot;nice&quot;...


Didja ever notice that both joel and forest gump came from
Alabama??  Deviant is as deviant does....  8-)

I wonder if they are both the same....hell it would be just like
forest to create long lists or even long songs...hell the man ran
around the country three times....forest went to nam...and so
