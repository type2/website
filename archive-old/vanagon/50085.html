I agree that it's probably F.I. related.  There are plenty of possible 
problems, and I would carefully check all F.I. connections (parrticularly 
to the air flow meter and all grounds), but these are a couple that I have 
run into in the past.
Dual relay may be failing to provide constant current to the fuel pump, due 
to either a fault in the wiring or in the dual relay.  You could measure 
current, or for testing purposes, just hook up a constant hot from the 
battery to the fuel pump and see if the van keeps running.  Also, the temp 
sensor may be faulty or disconnected.  You can take the wire going to the 
temp sensor and run it to ground, which will take the temp sensor out of 
the circuit for testing purposes. 
Good luck...Isn't F.I. troubleshooting fun!?  :(
