Subject: help...is my engine dying?

hey now,

well, to be brief, my van was running really rough after a mountainous trip.
i thought i had a fouled plug. okay...i took the plugs out, bosch platinums,
which are only a month old. they were dripping with oil. #'s 2, 3, and 4.
they looked like they were 2 years old. put my old ones back in, which, btw,
look newer even though they are a year old. still running rough at idle speed.
all wires are fine. i figure a) engine is running way too rich, tho i don't
have a gas smell, b) maybe something is really wrong, c) the engine is dying
or d) which is b and c. any advice? i'm not losing oil...
