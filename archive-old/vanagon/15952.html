Subject: Re: 1987 Brazilian Crew Cab FS

&gt;
&gt; This is a 1987 Crew Cab Transporter from Brazil.
&gt;  It is one of four brought into the country several years ago and
&gt;   is the only one to be titled legally.
&gt;
&gt;  This is a 68 thru 79 bodystyle bus. It is in better than new condition.
&gt;  I am not the owner, he is a friend of mine.
&gt;  
&gt;  yes, it is a 1987 and it is not a vanagon
