&gt;Yes, I did use some teflon tape, everywhere.  The elect. connection 
&gt;(ground) did cross my mind, but when I later pulled out the temp. sensor 
&gt;to test, I am convinced the teflon tears and there is metal-to-metal contact.

Well, the admonition came from VDO themselves (in their catalog). I did
not make this up :)

&gt;For the oil temp. I've got a porsche friend checking his catalogs for a 
&gt;sump plate with the fitting.  Or do I have to drill a hole in mine?

BusBoy Jim had a suggestion. It was my impression that the Porsche sump
plate is hard to find.

&gt;I can then eliminate the T and 6-inch nipple.  I don't want to cut the 
&gt;tin for the pressure sensor.  I like the idea of a flexible hose.

VDO also sells a few adapters. T's, flex hose (I believe); will look it up
and let you know. 

&gt;BTW Sami, I chickened out of mounting the gauges in the dash. :)

I'm kind of relieved. You see, I didn't mind doing this to my own bus,
especially because I don't intend to sell it. Ever. But if I were shopping
for a bus and saw the &quot;alteration&quot;, it would signal to me that the guy or
gal had no respect for the bus and probably did some other non-kosher
things to it.
