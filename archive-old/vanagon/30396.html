Subject: FS '70 camper van $500

                        Dear fellow listmember:

I now realise that I should have written this letter in the first place.
You see I have a neighbor who has a '70 westfalia that has been sitting
in his driveway forever.  I recently asked him if he wanted to part-out
the interior and he said he would be willing to sell me the entire interior.
Since I only wanted a few little things I thought I'd post a messege to
see if maybe others would be interested in the remaining things including
the closet, seat/bed, table, sink etc.  

Today he informs me that he wants to sell the entire van.  The van has
rust, especially around the front window. The engine supposedly is rebuilt.
I personally don't think it's worth restoring and can only be used as a 
parts car.  Perhaps if several people want parts they could pool their 
money and buy it.  I'd be willing to negotiate on your behalf in exchange
for a few items.

Any questions...please feel free to e-mail me...sorry for my lack of
clarification.

Martin
