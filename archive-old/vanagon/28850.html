&gt;The first time I tried to find my ISCU (Idle stabilizer), before I had a
&gt;Bentley's, I didn't find it. It's located in front of the right tail light.
&gt;I haven't tried it but it might be possible to reach it by removing the tail
&gt;light assembly, I wouldn't recommend this approach. The better, correct?,
&gt;way is to remove the plastic panel just to the right of the air cleaner. 

I removed the tail light to get to mine.  This approach worked just fine.
 Why would you not recommend this and why would all the work to remove that
panel be more &quot;correct&quot;?
