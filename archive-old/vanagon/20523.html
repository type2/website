Well,
as it turns out, I am just in the process of starting to redo my wallpaper.
I think the problem with the peeling comes from having vinyl stuck to wood.
There are 2 different rates of expansion, I guess, so what is going to give
is the glue ... hence the nasty result.  There have been some hints from
people who have replaced this stuff ... use 3M90 (I can only find 3M77).

&gt; I have a problem with the _wallpaper_ peeling from the ceiling of my 82 
&gt; camper. The plastic foil just comes loose at several places. Has anybody 
&gt; out there tried to fix this problem?
