&gt; Don't agree to anything. 
&gt; Get yourself a lawyer before the meeting (they must be good for
&gt; _something_?). If this is not possible, postpone the meeting.

Boushwa!   

A problem like this should be amicably settled between parties without resorting
to Liars.  Go make a good faith attempt to resolve the issue on your own.  If you're 
unhappy without the results OR the shop hasn't lived up to it's end of the bargain,
THEN get yourself an attorney.  Or just ask yours to write a letter.  You'd be amazed
at the results you can get with just a letter.  Lots cheaper too.
