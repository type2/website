&gt; I saw the thread in the archives about OEM cupholders
&gt; being seen at K-Mart or Wal-Mart. Well, around here, no luck.
&gt; Wal-mart doesn't have anything like it, K-Mart has a cheap
&gt; imitation, no joy either at the local warehouse-type parts 
&gt; stores. So several questions:
&gt; 
&gt; (1) Anybody seen any lately?

Yes.  Several places.

&gt; (2) Where?

Like I said, &quot;several places&quot;.  Oh, you want to know which places?
I've seen and bought them at auto accessory stores.  Not regular parts
stores, but stores that specialize in auto goodies like bras, fender flares,
&amp; cup holders.  A couple of ones locally seem to be oriented toward
accessories for American vans and pick-up trucks. They carry bed liners,
&quot;captains&quot; chairs, pedestal tables, tie-downs &amp; stuff like that.

&gt; (3) Are they really identical to the VW unit, or just similar.

VERY similar.  They look as if the second company used the original item and
tried 000to make a duplicate.  The original ones had a circular ring that a
soda can fit into well.  Lately (for several years) the ring has been
replaced by two seperate arcs that can slide apart to fit larger cups and
mugs with a handle.  The mounting holes on all are in the same position as
VW's.

&gt; If that is the case, maybe it was the K-Mart version (with a
&gt; spring steel band holding the cup) was the item talked about earlier.

No.  All the ones I've used (plenty) have molded plastic circles or arcs
holding the cup.

&gt; (4) Anybody actually buy one and know who the manufacturer is;
&gt; maybe I could contact them to find someone retailing them?

Don't know.


Good luck,
