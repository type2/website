Subject: Re: Engine substitutions

Engine substitutions? What kind of VeeDubber would want to get rid of precision
German engineering? Well,...
 
In the past three days I've dropped the 2L from my '77 bus -- newly acquired
for a song. It ran when I picked it up, so how bad could it have been, right?
 
#3 cylinder had detonated for I don't know how long and the cam looks like the
picture in Wilson's book titled &quot;not an acceptable core.&quot;
 
Right off the bat, with new p&amp;c's, at least one good head, bearings, gaskets
(thank goodness the clutch looks OK), I'm looking at a minimum in the $600
range. Yowza.
 
So I, for one, would be very interested in a low-cost alternative, at least for
the time being. But hey, if it may be even cheaper in the long haul, who knows?
 
I, too, would like to know more about Kennedy's swaps. What engines could be
dropped into my bus? (With an appropriately priced adapter.)
 
Looking through old issues of Hot-VW I've found the following addresses:
 
Engines INternatioal
115 NY Mall Westroads, Suite 250
Omaha NE  68114
	&gt;&gt;&gt; They advertise putting a &quot;Mitsubishi turbo engine&quot; into VW, keeping
VW tranny. $3 for info

Kenedy Engineering Products

Palmdale CA 93550
	&gt;&gt;&gt; Started the thread, $2 for catalog
 
I do not know anything -- ANYTHING -- about these companies or their products.
I am interested in putting a Type I in my bus, mainly because I have several
engines sitting around, and a rebuild kit as well. (Isn't it interesting how
these VW will keep running and running long after their bodies have died a
nasty WI salted-road death?)
 
If anybody knows more about these, or any other, I'd love to hear about them.
I'd sort of like to know what's available with Kennedy; I don't want to wait
for the mail, and I'd like to decide soon.
 
On a related thread, thanks to everyone who warned about Performance... I guess
some things are too good to be true. I have noticed that most P&amp;C's for 2L
busses cost in the mid $300s, but that GEX lists for $167. On the phone, the
guy I talked to said they were Brazilian. I know GEX has been advertising a long
time... but this is an imperfect indicator of quality. Opinions?
 
Finally, are there any shops/mail order that you recommend? I have good vibes
about the parts place in Auburn Hills, MI, but have never ordered. The boneyard
from which I did all my previous shoppin (almost) has since cleared out most
air cooled stuff (Argh!).
 
Thanks in advance!
