Subject: Re: Seat covers for 86 Bus Plus 

While on the subject ....

What is the difference between a 1986 Vanagon Camper and a Vanagon Camper Wolfsberg 
Edition???

I'm looking to buy a Wolfsberg Edition and I am not clear about how it differs from a 
standard Camper.

&gt;&gt; I have never heard anyone use the term &quot;bus plus&quot;. Most of the list
&gt;&gt;  refers to it as the &quot;weekender&quot; package. Actually, I like the term bus
&gt;&gt;  plus better, but I usually call mine a Westy because it has the pop-top
&gt;&gt;  (with Westfalia on the front and back). 
&gt;
&gt;Speaking of 86 Vanagon model names:
&gt;VW's name for this model was the &quot;Vanagon Camper&quot;.  The Westys with the full
&gt;compliment of camping stuff were called the &quot;Vanagon Camper GL&quot;.  
&gt;The term &quot;Weekender&quot;, while reasonably descriptive, is confusing because VW
&gt;never used this name to describe any Vanagon with a pop-top and they did use
&gt;this name to describe the fold-down rear seat &amp; cushion option on the
&gt;non-camper models.
&gt;
&gt;While I like the term &quot;Weekender&quot;, don't be suprised if someone else has a
&gt;different interpretation of what it means.
