&gt; &gt;When I changed tires about 10 months ago, I called VWOA. The &quot;consultant&quot; or
&gt; &gt;whatever told me they recommended the Michelin MXLs even though they were
&gt; &gt;205s. He said they felt they handled better. I haven't seen anything saying
&gt; &gt;they aren't all weather though. They got us through the &quot;Great Snow&quot; this last
&gt; &gt;winter. Oh, BTW Joel... the MXLs are 6 ply (I remembered there was a Q in your
&gt; &gt;mind earlier). Anyway, I went with the MXLs and they feel GOOD. They have also
&gt; and MXL's are ok, good tires.

                Be aware there are &quot;non&quot; reinforced MX Ls available, too. Those
                fancy new S(L)aabs come with'm.
