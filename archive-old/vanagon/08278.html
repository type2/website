&gt; DO NOT USE A DUAL BATTERY ISOLATOR ON A VW BUS! Sorry to shout but 
&gt; this point seems like it needs repeating as the isolator thing keeps rearing

&gt; voltage as an American alternator and you therefore shouldn't make it 
&gt; fight its way through the voltage drop that an dual battery isolator 
&gt; entails (typically 1 volt).  You can do it, but it will take a long 
&gt; time to recharge your batteries. It is much smarter and cleaner 
&gt; to use high current 12 volt operated relays instead.
         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

What would it take to install something like this?  How would it be wired 
and how would you choose a relay?

Very interested!
