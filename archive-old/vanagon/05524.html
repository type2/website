Subject: Re: Subject: Westy Q's


&gt;Would adding some westy-type equipment be a waste without the added
&gt;headroom the poptop gives?
&gt;
Nope, it's a helluva lot cheaper than buying a used Westy, and since the 
only time I need a top up is for doing dishes/cooking I don't miss it on the 
current flat-top. Just cook/wash at your campsite/table/treestump whatever. 
In cold weather the top is a major heat loss item. Better a 
panelled+insulated roof. A flat top van doesn't look so suspicious street 
camping BTW, dark tint the windows,  use dark solid color curtains and park 
in front of the Ritz, they have the nicest bathrooms.  The top is damned 
nice to have however in summer with two kids asleep you can still have 
company over. If you want a bunk in a Vanagon flat-top get one of the old 
front hammocks and fit it in above the headrests. It works, our 4 year old 
fits well, or dump all your winter jackets etc up there if sans kid.  go 
westy young man *,however you can.   tim s.
