Subject: RE: engine removal 71 bus


&gt;The problem I have is not with the bolt turning, but not staying still
&gt;'til I get the nut on. The clean thread trick didn't work for me last
&gt;Sunday, hence the willing (?) volunteer lying under the bus.

I see... sorry I got the wrong idea, Ian.

Have you tried lowering the engine several inches after removing the
rear engine hanger bar? I find this enables me to reach these top two
bolts from *above*, and use a wrench, screwdriver, or vicegrips to
hold it still.

Don't lower it too far-- I have a hunch this could bend or otherwise
screw up the front shift linkage-- that little cage that goes on the
shift fork shaft coming out of the front (FIF) of the tranny.

Steve
