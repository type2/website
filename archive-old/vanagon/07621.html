&gt; Re: &quot;things General Motors does, blatantly, to avoid 'doing the right thing'
&gt; for their customers&quot;
&gt; I have no love for GM, the cars or the company, but I think GM is getting a
&gt; bad rap on this issue.  GM did the right thing already: sold a truck buyers
&gt; wanted at a price they wanted to pay, meeting all applicable regulations in
&gt; force.  If that's not good enough, what keeps me from suing VW because lack
&gt; of power inhibits accident avoidance?  I bought it.  If I change my mind 
&gt; about how safe it is, I'll sell it.  My problem, not the vendor's.  Flame off.
&gt; Your turn.

&gt; 
  According to my neighbor who works for Failure Analysis Associates (they are
  the ones who found the incendiary devices used to get the pickup to &quot;light&quot;
  up on television) the safety record of the GM pickups with sidesaddle tanks
  is quite good and does not deviate from the type of fatality rate and 
  incidence of fire seen in other pickup trucks. Although I am not a big fan
  of GM or their products, the scent I detect is that of P.I. lawyers after
  big bucks. Flame off too.
