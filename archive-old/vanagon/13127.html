Subject: interior panel recovering


I once tried to replace the interior panel &quot;wallpaper&quot; on my '82 with
thick all vinyl wallpaper. It was beige/ivory with a surface texture on on
side that produced moire patterns (some would say &quot;cool patterns&quot;), the
reverse side had a texture very similar to the stock covering. I got
the stuf very cheaply from a wallpaer store, it was left over from an
office job. My mistake was to try and apply the stuff in winter, even the
relatively mild winter here in Victoria, the temp was around freezing.
This made the vinyl stiff and uncooperative. I used spray contact adhesive
and it was a wee bit tricky to get the vinyl down onto the panels (removed
for job) without any bubbles. the panel that is above the driver and
passenger area was especially difficult, the trick is to take it out and
lay it so it has the same bend. If the paper is applied onto a flat panel,
when the panel is in position and bent/curved, the paper can and will wrinkle.
On reflection, it is a job for warm temperatures and no wind, and maybe
vinyl is not the best choice for vans that will see painfully cold
weather, (vinyl gets very brittle at -20 C).
