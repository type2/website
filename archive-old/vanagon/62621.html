Subject: Multivan or Westfalia

     
     
     I am in the market for a 90-91 Vanagon, either Multivan or Westfalia.
     
     I am tempted toward the Multivan for its 3 extra passenger seats, but 
     will sure miss an onboard sink, stove and fridge.
     
     Will I be better off buying an all-in-one Westy, or a roomy Multivan 
     instead and just buy a cooler and Coleman stove for camping? 
     
     Does cooking in the vehicle stink it up? How reliable is the fridge? 
     (I have read several posts about cooling problems, and pilot lighting 
     difficulties.) Does the convenience of the camping equipment outweigh 
     the extra weight and loss of interior space?
     
     I'd love to hear from someone who's owned both, and can give me the 
     advantages/disadvanges of each vehicle.
     
     Thanks. EJ
