&gt; I was just reading the latest VW Trends, and a couple things of interest came
&gt; up:
&gt; 
&gt; 	The writing style has degenerated even further.  Some articles (like the
&gt; one on the 23 window bus) appear to be targeted to people who have no idea
&gt; what a VW is!
&gt; 
I must agree, I was insulted by the tone of this article. Sort of like
&quot;Golly gee, look at all those windows...no one has *ever* seen those
before. Can you believe how gosh darn crazy this thing is???&quot;
Oh well, at least (I think) it was a driver, and not one of those
chromed front beam, brake drums, and exhaust system busses...
