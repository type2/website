Spotted the CHP randomly pulling vehicles over to do a Dyno smog test 
last week, thus the last post on dyno testing Q's.  Now on to the 
legal stuff.

One is obligated to pull over when requested, but NOT required to be 
tested.  Article in the local paper stated such, though the CHP won't 
volunteer the information, that you can refuse to participate.  
They'll try to convince you to be tested though.

I would refuse on the basis of lack of airflow to my engine, period, 
unless of course they would replace my engine! if it burns up.
