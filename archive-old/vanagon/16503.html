Arrrgh!

Again, you guys are getting together. Again, I will be out of
the area. I was in FL last time, I will be in PA this time.

But, I will be coming back into town that evening, so I will
try to be there. I may be an hour or so late, but I will try.

See ya! (We need more lead time on these things)
