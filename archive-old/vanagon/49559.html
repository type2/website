Subject: need advice on water pump

Here's the next repair on the agenda.  I hear my water pump going. 

Anybody have any idea how much a water pump should cost and how
manyu hours of labor (for a paid mechanic) are involved in replacing
the pump?

Also, I've been hearing it for a couple hundred miles.  Can I likely go 
another 100 miles or so with a fairly low probability of complete failure?
You are not required to anwser this question.

Thanks for the help as always.  

david
