&gt; I doubt anyone can prove or dispute the Techroline theory, but I have one 
&gt; question:
&gt; 
&gt; How do the deposits end up in your oil? 
&gt; 
I have read that through the combustion process it ends up in the 
oil.  My dealer, and other people I have talked to say this is so.  
Not too sure of how/why, etc.  Maybe somebody could explain the real 
reason.  I too would like to know.
