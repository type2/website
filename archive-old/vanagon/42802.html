Subject:       A quick question for Ghia heads.

Sorry to waste the bandwitdh here, but since this does apply to 
Volkswagens (even if they are of another flavor):

The neighbor next door wants to sell me his Ghia.  He's the original 
owner, and it's a '68.  His son's done a touch of damage to the front 
corner, but other than that there is no rust or dents.  It is 
missing the side moldings.  A good buff job and the thing would be 
sharp as a tack.  Apparently it has a newly rebuilt 1600 in it.  
Overall I'd say its in GOOD condition, like a 6 or 7 out of 10.

He is telling me to find out what they are going for and make an 
offer.  I asked what he'd take, but he wouldn't say... wanted me to 
find a fair value.

Anyone?  Now don't tell me it's worth as much as I'm willing to pay, 
because I know that. &lt;Grin&gt;  I'm wondering if anyone's seen some real 
selling prices?  

I really want to spend about $600-700, but if they are averaging 
less than that, or way more, I'd like to know...  I do plan 
to explain my lower offer because in a '67 or older I woudn't have to 
deal with emmissions, and since this one is a '68...

Please respond privately!  Thanks!
