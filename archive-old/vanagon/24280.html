Subject: Wanna Westy


Does anybody on the list hail from the Long Island NY area?  If it is not to 
much to ask and somebody could anyone from LI browse through the NEWSDAY 
classified once in awhile for VW poptop Westy's and let me know via the 
list?  I' ve always had excellent luck with this paper's classified section 
but no longer live in the area.

Has any one on the list bought anything from 4ever4 in Peterborough, NH? 
 The owner of this searches out rust free South West VW's and ships them up 
to New England.  I considering this as an option for the purchase of my 
Westy.

Thanks,
P. Jensen
