Subject: '64 Single Cab Value?
Date: Wed, 15 Nov 1995 08:54:02 -0600 (CST)

God help me.  I am going to look at a '64 single cab on Thursday.  
Those of you who have followed my work on the '71 bus will know that I
have no money.  I am trying to get my dad to buy this one.  I will be 
his mechanic. :)  I have only seen this in the dark and will get a 
better look on Thursday.  I wanted to get a ballpark figure before I 
headed out there.  There is no asking price yet.

Engine has recently had the top end redone.  It is from a 68.
Tranny is in good shape, doesn't pop out of any gears.
No rust through the body, only surface.
Still 6 volt
Steering box is getting sloppy but still has some miles left.
New exhaust
New front seat
Good snow tires in the rear
No door panels, no headliner

The guy said he and his son bought it as a project and are down to the
interior bits.  The son went away to college and lost interest.  He 
has been driving it on and off on his 30 mile commute.  He is the second 
owner.  The guy wants it out of his driveway.  I noticed that the 
latches on the engine cover and gates are missing.  The rockers did 
SEEM solid.  I don't know how much of that is bondo, etc.  I get it 
for a couple of hours on Thursday so I will give it a full check over 
then.  What would you be offering?  Who has that book that was used to
figure out the value of Opie?  Dean?  I will let the rest of you know if
it doesn't work out for me.  Thanks, Jim
