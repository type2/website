I'm glad Palmer came in on this because I was thinking about an East Coast 
versoin but didn't want to retain the title of &quot;sole instigator&quot; :)

I'd like to help plan and will certainly try to participate in either an 
East-Coast version or some where in the Mid-Mid-Midwest (draw a line 
between the Atlantic and The Mississippi) for a venture.

We can show those rich, west-coast (high-rollers) types that we have some 
beautiful country and sites (for starters - Blue Ridge, Great Smokey, 
Ozarks ... don't mean to exclude but am trying for brevity) that are well 
worth visiting!
