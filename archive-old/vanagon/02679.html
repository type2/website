Subject: reverse light switch


ooops - just noticed last night my vanagon inspection expired end of July -
checked all the requisites - no reverse lights - fuse, and bulbs okay.

havent rolled underneath yet to check by shorting switch, but looks like
a bad switch to me. Its a 5 speed diesel - i hope its not an orphan switch
or bang goes the bank account .....

anyone have  fitch at work (and boss on vacation) ???

im probably not as desparate as i sound - having lived in a small upstate
NY town for 7 years i can take it our local garage who will inspect it, st
sticker it and fix it when the parts come in the next week (unless you
dont have any brakes or the like ....)

what the hell is a fitch (or a desparate) you ask??

i meant a fiche i think  :-)

sps
