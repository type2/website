Subject: Car Talk

NPR has a weekly program, Saturday mornings in my area, called CAR TALK. 
Two mechanics, Tom &amp; Ray, field call-in questions. They have a great 
sense of humor making their show funny as well as informative. For you 
car song fans out there, at mid-point station identification they always 
have some car-related song snippet in the background. Try identifying for 
a challenge.
