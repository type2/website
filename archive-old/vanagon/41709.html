Subject: 1990 Vanagon Wolfsburg Edition??

Vanagonauts,

I'm working on the 1990 version of my Vanagon Model Year Summary-USA
 write-up and can't seem to determine if there was a Wolfsburg edition made
for 1990.  Can anyone confirm if this model exists and if so, what
features/differecnces made it unique?

Thank you,
Jim Davis
