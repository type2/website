Subject: What's a REASONABLE Oil Leak (!)
Date: Mon, 05 Aug 96 18:14:26 -0500
From: &quot;W.R. Transue&quot; &lt;trans_at_castle_dot_net&gt;

OK gang, I'm contemplating whether its worth my while to tough out an oil
leak or get to it and just fix it. Here's my story:

First, I'm relocating to NJ and most of my tools etc. are in Colorado, so
I'm limited withy what I can personally take on right now.

I've got a new '87 Westy Syncro which needs a few things addressed, one of
which is the oil leak. Personally, I'd like to wait a few months and get
settled in a new house w/ my tools and do a rebuild (selas, etc.). So I'm
worried that I'll spend this money for a mechanic to fix this leak, and just
end stripping the engine down in a few months anyway.

The bus drops a small bit of oil (primarily after long runs when the engine
is fully heated) leaving a 3-4&quot; radius spot after sitting for several hours.
Barely noticable on the oil stick (maybe a quart every 2,000 miles or so). 

It's a pain leaving spots, but given my experience with my old 77, a
certainly not uncommon occurance.

The leak appears to be coming from between the engine &amp; manual tranmission
seal (though after a recent oil change to 20/50 its seems to have gotten
better.. would a lighter oil have seeped more??).

So given all you've read, what would you do? Am I risking anything by not
taking care of this now?

Thanks for any help (and sorry its such a bonehead question.. just literally
contemplating my repair logistics).

Bill
