&gt; I thought you could pull the generator without dropping the engine, you need 
&gt; a large wrench/socket to get onto the nut that's nearest the fire wall/gas 
&gt; tank and another to fit the pulley end. Brace the hidden wrench against the 
&gt; engine case, use so blocks of wood 2&quot; x 4&quot; etc. and keep some pressure on 
&gt; with the other wrench until things are braced and you can really reef on it. 
&gt; It eludes me how to keep the generator shaft still for this operation if 
&gt; needed however.  Anyone? tim s.
&gt; 
&gt; If you can plug in an overnite battery charger maybe you can put this off 
&gt; indefinately?
&gt; 
&gt; 
You can do this easier by pulling off the carb, extracting the generator 
and the fan (via the four small bolts in the fan housing face) and then 
dealing with the gen., and fan outside the vehicle-- just torque that 
large fan bolt properly when you have the new generator attatched to the 
fan housing plate and the fan itself. ---Piece of Cake!!! WITHOUT 
DROPPING THE ENGINE!!!!!!!! just have a milkcrate to sit on.-a must!
