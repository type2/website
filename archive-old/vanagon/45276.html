Subject: Query about Weddle Engineering Differential Locker

Currently I have a transmission that pops out of 1st gear
during hard deceleration.  Purchased a rebuilt transmission
from German Transaxel of America about 3 years ago at 132,000
miles.  It turn out that it is still under warrently and
they will pay shipping both ways as well as repair the trans-
mission for free.  With that kind of service, I'd highly
recommend them for anyone needing a transmission rebuild.
	German Transaxle of America
	6312 Nels Anderson Road
	Bend, Oregon 97701 
	503-382-7723

I'm considering putting in a Weddle Engineering locking
differential and wondered if anyone has had any experience
with this unit.

Thanks,
Fred
