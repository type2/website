Subject: Re: Air Conditioning problems on 90 Westy

Hi Ian.  As Jim, states,   there is a box in  the westy linen closet 
that has to come out to gain access to the 2nd valve.  

Hope this helps,
Harry



&gt; I think this may be where your problem starts.  My 87 &amp; 88 Vanagons have the
&gt; second port inside the plactic cover that runs from the floor to the ceiling
&gt; at the left/rear corner of the van.  You can remove the cover easily with
&gt; about 6 phillips-head screws.  I would bet that your 1990 model DOES have two
&gt; ports and that you need to uncover the second one.
&gt; 
&gt; Good Luck,
