&gt;What are we supposed to do with drained coolant these days?  I imagine that
&gt;down-the-gutter is somehow harmful to the environment (or maybe just my
&gt;cat).

our local parts suppliers have started taking in used oil, anti-freeze, and
(if you're dumb enough to just give them away) old batteries. it's part of a
recycling program of the local governments. might be worth a check with some
of the FLAPS in your area. sure beats leaving it in a jug out by the garbage.
(the garbage folks used to recycle it for us).
