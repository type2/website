&gt; What sort of shape is your weatherstrip around the pop-top in? I had the
  same &quot;lifting&quot; problem on my '72 and it improved dramatically when I 
  replaced the rubber weatherstrip around the perimeter. I think the airflow
  over the front and windshield may get under the pop-top and lift it when
  the seal is poor. I think the replacement strip was about $65 from West
  Coast Metric. Well worth it, IMHO.

&gt; On my daily commute, I drive a two-lane rural road that has traffic that 
&gt; moves very fast.  Sometimes a combination of strong winds and large trucks 
&gt; going 65-70mph will cause the front of my Westy pop-top to pop up about 1.5 
&gt; inches and stay there.  There are some little clips in the very front that I 
&gt; think are supposed to keep this from happening, but they aren't doing their 
&gt; job and I don't think they are adjustable.  For the time being (to keep from 
&gt; permanent damage to the top hinges) I have a BIC ski hold down strap keeping 
&gt; the front down.
&gt; 
&gt; Questions:  Anybody else ever have this happen?  Are there any adjustments 
&gt; in the top mechanism that would fix this?  Are these little hold down clips 
&gt; (they are shaped like question marks (?)) unique to the '73 or did they use 
&gt; the same thing on all Westy's?
&gt; 
&gt; Any help and advice would be appreciated.  TIA.
