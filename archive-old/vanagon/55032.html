Subject: CB vs. cellular for Mexico

I'll be traveling alone for a couple of months in Mexico in my Syncro and am
thinking about having some sort of emergency communication system.  Knowing
absolutely nothing about CBs or cellular phones I'd like to hear opinions on
what might work for me.
Being well acquainted with Mexico, I wouldn't hold any hopes for trying to
call police (other than the Green Angels), as they might do me more harm
than good.  Do truckers in Mexico use CBs as commonly as in the states?
