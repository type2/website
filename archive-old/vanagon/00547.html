&gt; Where can one buy engine compartment seals for the Bus?  I would like to

&gt; half 'n half sealed  :-).

Try a VW store.  Or mail order from a VW magazine.  Also, it helps if you 
mention what year... there are 4 generations of Buses on this list.

&gt; I have engine compartment seals for te Bug, perhaps it is possible to fit
&gt; these into my Bus?  How about using rubber from a tire inner tube to make
&gt; my own seals?   Someone suggested to me to use pieces of rubber made from
&gt; the heavy-duty rubber used for roofing.  Who has messed around with custom
&gt; engine compartment sealing?

I would suggest just buying new ones.  It only cost me 15 dollars to do 
my bus.  If the one for the bug looks like it'll fir sure, sometimes 
thing will interchange.
