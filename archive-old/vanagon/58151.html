&gt; The Rialta is not the Eurovan Camper.  The Rialta is the $45K to $55K 
&gt; beastie sold by Winnebago dealers.  Parcel delivery box looking thingie 
&gt; put on the chassis and cab of an EV.

	Actually, I don't think Winnebago uses the VW chassis.  I believe
they do their own and only use the cab with engine/drive.

Summary:  Rialta is a Winnebago.  Sold and serviced by an RV dealer.
          Eurovan Camper is a VW.  Sold and serviced by a VW dealer.
