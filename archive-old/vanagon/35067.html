I need help bodaciously bad. '73 Kombi with type 4 w/ 34PDIST
dual carbs. Major problem at the time was it backfired and ran
rich as black plugs. Had elect. fuel pump. I agreed to rebuild 
the carbs, tune up and lose the back-firing. &quot;Piece of cake&quot;.
I rebuilt the carbs, they had different main jets &amp; were way out
of line for engine. The floats had no retaining springs. One of
the carb pump delivery tubes was gone and fuel just ran down the 
side of the venturi. All the O-rings were rotten &amp;/or gone.
I was doing this as a semi-favor so I swallowed my dismay and hunkered down
and did them right just for drill.
 Removed elect. fuel pump &amp; put back to stock.Elect. went over 10psi. Stock
is 3-1/2 plus.
I reinstalled the carbs to find it still loads up and back-fires.
OK - vacuum leaks. I chased all those down and rewired a few items 
that kept trying to set the engine room on fire. 
I got it running and balanced the carbs at idle but they still load
up above 2000 rpm. I put the timing light on it and it's running
all over. Back to town 30 miles away for a new distributor. The 009
was what I bought. Eliminate the possible vacuum problem once and for
all. Will not start on timing mark. OK find TDC myself. Can't turn
crank and stick finger in hole at same time. Probably saved a finger
I pulled of the valve cover and got both valves closed, feel in the
plug hole for how close I was to top. I think it's close.
Got it started and everything is going along fine. Balanced the carbs
again, no I do not know how but this rebuild kit says tweak this and
that until this occurs and it seems to work part of the time.
Engine has run about half hour by now so I hooked up analyzer and
timing light. Grabbed the timing lite, lifted tail door to take a 
look and it died. Had the guy who owns it come over and play remote
starter for me, no spark from coil. Checked juice to coil good &amp; hot
Grabbed a spare coil installed. Zip. Two in a row? Maybe. Took one 
right off of his car and installed it. He took the first one that 
failed and stuck it in his car and it ran! His coil still don't spark
on the PIG. We have hot to coil + , wire to points on - and continuity from
coil to points. Points are brand new as is the dist.
and both were working fine. The gap is there the action is there.
I would check that voltage from points to coil but I don't know what
voltage it is (dumb sentence) ie 12 v , 50v ?
It has been going on like this for 9 days, even I
don't respect me. There is one other wire going to the 
negative side of the coil that goes off into the LOOM.
I can see no way it could affect any of this. (of course 
I tried it off and on). At this point I read my own stuff and ran
out to see if the dizzy was even turning, it is. At this point I 
have only the wire I'm holding to the case for spark from center tap.
&quot;Of course, it's the wire!&quot; This morning I moseyed out, got the wire
and vom and tested it for continuity. It's good, and the only thing 
left is superstition. 

              Anyone got even a crazy idea? 
              
              &quot;it doesn't get any better than this&quot;
                                            west &quot;thanks&quot;
