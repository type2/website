&gt; Just keep in mind that every time the fuel pump swallows air may be the lost

&gt; injection pumps should never be run dry.  This goes for any make of car.

    GEEE Dennis..... Did you hafta tell us that. I always thought
    that might be the case but, didn't want to know that to be true.
    I have had to many problems with burns to think about this! Well
    not that many autos blowing up so it's can't be much to worry about.
    I havn't seen any over inflated pumps yet!
