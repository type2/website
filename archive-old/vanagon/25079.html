Subject:       '72 update

I went ahead and installed a '74 axle beem and it worked perfectly.  
As of Saturday I am crusin again.  The entire operation took about 
4.5 hours, 1.5 to remove and 3 to change over things such as master 
and booster, reinstall new beem, reattach everything, and bleed the 
system. That was at a slow learners pace. I highly recommend a 
doityourselfer if any one is concidering an axle beem replacement.  
Thanks to all who offered advice and support.
                        Ed.
