Subject: Oil Temperature Gauge/ air cooled bus

Hi all,
Wanted to get this out before friday, which I understand is a day for humor,
I want to put an oil temperature gauge and sensor in my '77 westy. Wondering
whether or not to go with a dip stick style. Also wondering if anyone has a
good source for one of these. Your thoughts are always appreaciated. I also
am worried, last night I had a dream that was very vivid, I was working on
setting my valves and timing to the absolute perfect positions. 10 days ago,
before I bought my Bus, I didn't even know what timing or valves were. The
blonde who usually occupies that space is not gonna be happy :)
Peace,
Scoob 
'77 westy
&quot;The Bus come bye and I got on, thats when it all began&quot;
