Subject: Bruno #1  Big Phillips Screws

wow - great haul of junk.

my advice on taking off cargo doors:
 
tools needed:
  propane torch 
   squirt bottle of water (bicycle bottle works great)
    big screw driver
   big hammer
    Big phillips head bit that fits on ratchet,   or use vice grips on big
screw driver.

Torch it!!   TILL IT GLOWS.  Really.   When it glows,   squirt water on it to
shock the rust out.  (Steam steam)  Then put the  screwdriver in the screw
and whack it hard with the hammer a few times.  Try the screw now, while
pressing in hard.  Torch it again.  Whack it again.  The bottom ones are
worse.   Dont even try to turn them until you've torched them a couple times.
   The bus wont melt.    Get a can of primer, 90% or higher zinc content to
squirt on the areas where the paint was baked off.

This may sounds extreme but I've taken enough doors off that I don't want to
waste time.   I have also had the head off the screw break off.  I didn't
care, as at the time I wanted the door, but to put another door on that bus
would be a problem.   Another time my SO took a door off a bus to switch
doors, and the plate that holds the threads that the big nut screws into
broke loose and fell down inside the body.  The piller had to be cut open and
another piece welded in so the other door could be attached securely.  It was
the bottom one.  Said, &quot;I should have torched it again&quot;

This is good for taking bumpers apart, too.   I hate it when those 13mm s
break off in the bumper tubes.

my two cents   :_at_)
