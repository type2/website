Subject: Re: Converting an '83 Vanagon to propane

&gt;
&gt;I've just aquired an an '83 Vanagon and am interested in converting it
&gt;to run on propane.  I have heard that there are carb kits available in
&gt;the $500-1000 range, and I think with some creative welding I can mount
&gt;the tank just forward of the engine compartment (inside encased in metal).
&gt;
&gt;Anyone attemped this?  Any feedback appreciated.

I have a book that describes converting to LPG, called Technologocal Self 
Sufficiency (by Robin Clarke, Faber Paperbacks). It gives the address of 
this bloke:
Jerry Friedberg, 
Arrakis Volkswagen, 
PO box 531, 
Point arena, 
California 95468. 
He sells a manual, 'How to convert your auto to propane', and kits to do the 
job. The book was printed in 1976 so that address may be out of date though.
