Subject: Oil fill- 20W50 for '70 1600sp

	Jeff,
	The late ECI, the rebuilder who made my '70 engine, required multi-
wieght for their warranty, and I'm using regular (dinosaur) oil versus 
synthetic- I can't get behind leaving the oil in the engine for a long 
time, even though reputable sources say that appropriate synthetics look 
new when drained at dino intervals. 

	This week I'm using Penzoil 20W50. My brother and his wife run 
20W50 in their Beetle.

	ECI also required the oil be changed after the first hour of
running, which seemed like a good idea. There was some sludge on the 
drain-plate, and a few bits of gasket material, although the oil itself 
looked nearly new.

	I define an oil change as draining the oil AND pulling the
drain plate (six little nuts hold it on) and cleaning it and the screen.
My plan is to do this every 1500 miles or so. (I've got 2xx total on
the new engine to date.)

	Cheers!
	Bill
