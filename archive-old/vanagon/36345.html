&gt; Anybody know how much of the chemical energy stored in gasoline is used by a
&gt; standard motor?  5%?  10%? 20%?

At best gasoline spark ignition engine efficiency is about 25%. Diesel 
engine is about 35%. The other 75 or 65% is expelled as waste heat through 
the engine cooling system and exhaust.

&gt; He was under the impression that a gasoline motor tuned to run one constant
&gt; load (a generator) at one speed only, could be *much* more efficient than one
&gt; that had to have the capacity to carry a car from stop to 65mph.  

That is very true. Engine efficiency is best at and over 60-70% of rated
full power. Cruising at 60 mph a modern compact car uses maybe 10hp and
a vw type II about 30hp. Assuming a 100hp engine thats way below the
most efficient range. A textbook on the subject would have a more
detailed discussion on this. For an introduction see for instance the 
first few chapters of &quot;Auto fuel systems&quot; by Duffy. Complete record
see below.

Cars using a combination of power sources, such as gas-electric and
diesel-electric are called hybrids. There is a lot of ongoing research
in this area. Usually the diesel-electric combination is favored
because of the greater efficiency of the diesel. The vw diesel is currently 
used in stationary diesel generators. However, the generators in
the installations I've seen have been too big to be suitable for 
installation in a passanger car.

Mitsubishi is currently developing a direct injected gas engine.
Efficiency is predicted to be close to that of a diesel engine.
(But it is essentially a diesel engine running on gas fuel. Mpg won't
be as good because of the inherent lower energy content of gasoline (About
13% lower by volume.), but thermal efficiency should be similar)
