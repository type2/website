&gt;I have a friend that is looking into a '84 Weekender with automatic
&gt;transmission and A/C.  It has 143,000 miles on the original engine.
&gt;My friend has yet to see it but it is described as being in good
&gt;shape body/interior wise.  The guy is asking $3800.

&gt;Does that sound like a ball park figure?


I just purchased (actually will finalize the deal tomorrow) the 87 weekender
that Tom Kreyche advertised last week. It's got 157,000, automatic
transmission, A/C, PS, Cruise Control, Auto Door locks, and a couple other
goodies. I'm paying $2800 and the Van is pretty good condition. A couple
scratches and small dents, and the interior is fine for an 8 year old van. The
transmission slips a little in second, but not noticeably under most
conditions. $2800 is what Tom asked for and I thought it a fair price
considering I'm probably looking at a rebuild sometime fairly soon, but who
knows for sure. The engine is running strong now. and could give me quite a
few more miles. I have an '84 Chevy Cavalier with 265k that's never had the
heads off, so I for one believe that anything can happen.
    Anyway, $3800 for an '84 in similar shape sounds high.
    Now that I've moved from a wannabus to a real owner I'm looking forward to
the next Bay Area Pizza Gathering.
