Subject: wanted: rear exhaust pipe for 2.1l wasserboxer

After I checked out the early 70's bus I went to back out
and bumped into the base of what was once a light pole. This
bent, but did not crack the rear exhaust pipe on my 2.1l
wasserboxer. DOH! Anyway, does anyone have an extra one of
these they want to sell or does some one know of a place to
get a good price on a new one. I saw in the Parts Place cat.
they have them from $135.

TIA,
