Subject: Re: Middle Seat for 87 Vanagon GL Westphalia Camper

&gt;I don't know if the standard middle two-person seat from a 7-seat van
&gt;will fit in a camper with the refrigerator in place -- the one I pulled
&gt;this seat from had the refrigerator removed at the time.  It looks
&gt;promising, though. My seat is 46&quot; wide, and the space between the
&gt;refrigerator and the closed door (on an '80 Westy) is about 48&quot; -- so it
&gt;might *just* clear.&quot;

Let me know what happens since I am planning the same treatment.  I just
found a middle seat at the wreckers yesterday and am calling today for
their price.  If it is reasonable, I will buy it and occasionally install
it for extra seating (5th &amp; 6th seat) in my '91 Westy.

An earlier posting I made to The List had several replies saying it is
do-able.  The List never lies.
