&gt;Instrumentation problems!  The speedo is quick -- it is slow getting up to
&gt;the mark, doing so in spurts, and then it hangs at 20mph when I am stopped.
&gt;Probably getting gummed up somehow -- I sprayed WD40 in it that last time
&gt;this happened, and it seemed to work.  same again, perhaps?  Other lubricant
&gt;ideas? Different problem likely?

get some of that graphite stuff that is specially made for cables (you can
check with motorcyle places if no car parts houses have it) ... and use it.
in the worse case, you could remove the whole cable and clean it and regrease
it. :)

&gt;Fuel guage is a new one.  Seems to not know whether it wants to work or
&gt;not.  Sometimes it is fine, then it will act as though I shut off the
&gt;ignition.  Bumps seem to affect it.  At one point, I thought that wiggling

could be bad connectors on tank sender. or the tank sender is going bad. :(
there is a way to replace the sender without removing the tank, but it
involves cutting a hole in the 'floor' of the bus, just above the tank. i
have the instructions already typed up if you want them.
