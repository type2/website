&gt; &gt;Does _anyone_ out there know where I could find a suitable tow hitch (Class
&gt; &gt;1) so I don't have to go out and fabricate one myself?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I would be so grateful, I might just stop by on my way across and buy you a
&gt; &gt;few beers!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Please to be emailing me at  yeebot_at_aol_dot_com  because I no receive digest
&gt; &gt;anymore (at least til I get a comany acct!)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Thanks for all,
&gt; &gt;Mike

&gt; Mike -
&gt;   Did you ever receive any response on this??  I'm also interested in a 
&gt; tow hitch for a light duty utility trailer, to fit my 79 Van??
&gt; 
&gt; Could you email me any info - or let me know if you got none, so that I 
&gt; can begin to design/commission/steal a suitable hitch???
&gt; 
&gt;   Good luck on your trip!!

Have you guys tried the Yellow Pages.  A couple of years ago I took my 
'82 camper to Mann Trailer in Seattle.  They do custom trailers and 
install all kinds of trailer hitches, including custom work.  They 
indicated they could install a hitch, that would handle any load I 
wanted, up to, and beyond, the vehicle maximum load rating!  The maximum 
BUMPER hitch capacity, was another thing however - only a few hundred 
pounds.  The custom hitch would have been welded/bolted directly to the 
vehicle structure in some way.  It was expensive, and it was only going 
to be for occasional use, so I never did get it done and can't vouch for 
how it would have handled.
