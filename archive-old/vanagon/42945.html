Subject: Need Help Setting a Price for my 93 Eurovan MV!
Date: Sat, 25 May 96 14:31:01 -0500

Hi Gang,

Well, the time has come. Since purchasing the Mint '87 Westie, its only been a
matter of time before we had to give up The Big Red Van. Does anyone have a 
subscription to the NADA price book? Could I get some help determining a selling
price?

Here's a full description:

1993 EuroVan MV. Red, with black bumpers and trim. 49,800 mile (200 miles
left on the original warranty!). 5-speed, power windows, power locks, dual AC 
and heaters. Also have the EV bug deflector. Have replaced both headlights since
December, also had the temp sensor for AC replaced last fall.

We have the excellent VW cassette deck, and have upgraded all four speakers. 
Only one Minnesota winter, as we moved to Vancouver, BC for a year in August of 
'94, a few months after we bought it.

The 93 EV PISTON SLAP situation was corrected under warranty last November at 
about 40000 miles. For what it's worth, that repair involved most of an engine 
overhaul and replacement of all five pistons with new pistons ringed with teflon
pads. We've done regular oil changes every 3500-4500 miles.

This vehicle will need new tires by the end of the summer, and we have had very 
light body work done to the rear lid owing to backing into a protruding garage 
wall. There are also some small rock chips on the hood (will touch it up this 
weekend).

I had expected to drive my baby for another 100K miles, but spotting the Westie 
changed all that! 

I'll do a little price research this weekend, and put an ad in the Mpls and St. 
Paul papers next week. Until then, does anyone have price suggestions?

Thanks for the help!

-Steve
