Subject: appropriateness (was Re: finding bad syncro wheel bearing)

&gt;Okay I admit I did have the .sig file in the replay but it was not JUST
&gt;the .sig that was political.  It is political opinion that the 'GUMMINT'
&gt;is too big and out to get us.  This is what I was pointing out.  The .sig
&gt;confirms that current neo-conservative anti-government point of view.  I
&gt;would not object to silly comments about pets in a joking manner THAT
&gt;applied to volkswagen transporters.  Remember the cats and ferrets in the
&gt;air duct threads of a few months ago.  That was '/F' level related to VW
&gt;vans.  The 'GUMMINT&quot; out to cheat you and take everything you own is not
&gt;related to VW vans.  But this too is diverging from VW vans so any other
&gt;comments ought to be private as well.

        Buzz. Thanks for playing.
        The answer we were looking for: Our good ol' gummint won't let me
buy a brand new VW bus. I think this is the sort of interference Steve is
referring to, and it bugs the crap out of me. I cannot purchase the vehicle
I love and desire because some dork-in-a-tie decided that my vehicle of
choice is too dirty/unsafe for me to own. This has nothing to do with being
a ditto-head (I am most emphatically not, although we see eye to eye on
some issuses), and everything to do with my personal freedom to own a new
VW transporter being legislated away from me. Uncool, in any political
form.

Peace,
