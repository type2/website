Ric,

First off, sorry for the repsonse to the whole list, but
Ric didn't include his email address. Shame, shame.

&gt; I'm in Dartmouth...stuck between New Beige (New Bedford) and
&gt; Fall Rive...

Anywhere near the Nort Dartmit Mall? :-)

Specifically, I live in Portsmouth and work in Middletown. I
grew up in Somerset so I'm familiar with local pronunciations
of the area.

Ask me about the longest bridge in world joke.
