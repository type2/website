Subject: VDO oil temp sensor


Ok, after calling that VDO place, and having them
tell me its NLA, I believe its NLA.....

Does anyone have an extra sump cover for the 1.7/1.8/2.0
that they could part with so I can make one?
(would rather not mess up the only good one I have)

Also, Re: Breakdown lanes:
 
	It gives me the shivers to think of anyone staying inside their
car waiting for help.  The interstate is far more dangerous than most
people know.  Its really good no one got hurt; a few years ago here a
semi clipped a stalled Pinto on the shoulder and killed a sleeping(?)
family of 3. My father, who gets to go tow these cars, said it was a mess.....
