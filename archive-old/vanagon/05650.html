&gt;Hi All:
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;The gas gauge reads fine when full to 3/4, but then it drops like a
&gt;lead balloon.  Any clues on this?
&gt;
&gt;I've got more ?'s, but I've rambled on long enough.

I've got an 82 diesel Vanagon and the fuel gauge did the same thing. I took 
it apart 
to see if it could be fixed. There is a P.C. board inside the fuel level 
sensor inside the tank
and one of the traces was broken on mine. I tried to solder it back 
together, but it
didn't work out to well because a wiper rubs on it to give you your fuel 
level. Anyway
the wiper wouldn't pass over the solder. Replacement was the answer for me.
