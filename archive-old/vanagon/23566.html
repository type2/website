Subject: Alternator load

OK, here's my two cents on alternators (and generators) sucking
up horsepower based on load:

Horsepower and Watts are two different units to measure the same
thing:  Power.  One horsepower is (according to the Unix units
program), 745.7 watts.

I don't know a typical rating for a VW alternator, but I do know
there are 70 amp alternators flying around in slightly larger
airplane engines.  70 amps, at 13 volts, is roughly 900 watts,
which is about 1.2 horsepower.  Now consider that the alternator
isn't 100% effecient at converting mechanical power into
electrical power, and figure that to produce 70 amps, you'll
need something over 1.5 hp.  I don't know quite what you'd do to
draw that kind of power--I think my bus headlights are 70 watts
(.1 hp!), and even considering resistive losses, alternator
effeciency, etc., you shouldn't really notice anything when you
turn on the headlights.  Electrical A/C might be another story...

A really good thing about alternators is that they *don't* suck
power all the time, only when they're producing power.  Besides
the bicycle generator experiment that someone suggested, if
you're ever in the SF Bay area, check out the Exploratorium
(http://www.exploratorium_dot_edu/); they have all kinds of cool
electrical experiments set up, among others.  It's pretty
convincing to be pedaling along on a stationary bicycle
connected to a generator, then when someone flips a switch and
adds 5 100 watt lightbulbs to the circuit, the pedaling gets
*much* harder.

Dennis
P.S.  I think really good cyclists can generate 1 hp for a few
minutes.  I can keep up 1/2 hp for 10 minutes on a Stairmaster
(which uses resistive loading of a generator for physical
resistance).
