&gt;&gt;The origin of the term is unclear.
&gt;
&gt;I thought it was because the pistons' movements are reminiscent of the
&gt;fists of two boxers pounding each other. &lt;?&gt;

I saw that idea in a magazine review... sounds contrived and farfetched,
to say the least. The word comes from the German language, doesn't it?
Probably bears no resemblence to the English definition...
