&gt; What's the dang deal with the propane fridge? I can get it to light, but it
&gt; won't get cold. 

Well, you don't say what year were dealing with, but here's a stab in the
dark.  Are you turning up the dial that controls how cold the fridge temp
gets?  I know this sounds dumb, but I think I'm even capable of this one. ;)
When you're tired from driving and getting things set up, sometimes, you
not thinking is not as clear, so you overlook little things like that.
Other than that, if you got the pilot light going, I can't imagine why
it would not cool down.

&gt; 
&gt; Don't you just love these Vanagons?

Cause they give us lots to talk (and laugh) about.

Nice report Jackson,
