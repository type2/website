Actually, in a rebuilt axle the only thing that should be original is the
axle shaft... Both CV joints will have been replaced along with the boots 
and
grease... you can do all this work yourself for a fraction of the cost of
&quot;Rebuilt&quot; units...

I just did my own for about $75 a side... and it takes about an hour each
side...
