Is there an archive somewhere of heaters for Vanagon/Buses?  I'd
like to be able to heat my Vanagon when I'm far off the beaten
path.  Basically I just need enough heat to heat the inside for a
few minutes at night (just before going to bed) and a few minutes in
the morning.

BTW, does anyone up north in Canada have a Syncro with the water-heating
auxillary heater?  Does it work well?
