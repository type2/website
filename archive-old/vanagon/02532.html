 Hi,

&gt; Now of course the Westfalia won't start...anybody experience hard starting 
&gt; in damp rainy weather? Are Vanagon's susceptible to this problem? If so 
&gt; what is the best way to prevent it. ( I'm assuming this is the problem....).

 The only time my '71 westy didn't start it was because the HT leads were
dirty and in wet weather the current shorted to ground through the damp dirt.

 In my case this was visible as sparks around the leads when it was dark enough
to see them. It took me a couple of tries to work this out because I didn't
have anyone around to crank the engine while I watched.

Cheers,
        W.
