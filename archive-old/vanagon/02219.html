&gt;Joel!  Your gas study is incredible.  Now 'fess up... do you:
&gt;alphabetize your tool belt?

nope. don't have no tool belt. carry everthin in a BIG box.

&gt;categorize your fish bait in the tackle box?

don't fish. too many bones. too close to cat food. :)

&gt;have everything neatly and perfectly folded in your dresser drawers?

you kin git dressers with drawers?

&gt;saw knot-holes out of scrap wood, because you &quot;can't stand the
&gt;     idea of them 'staring' up at you?&quot;

if they're not holes, how could you tell? besides, i never use 'scrap' wood!

&gt;refuse to use pushpins unless they are all the same color?

i only have one color. they came in big plastic box. all clear.

&gt;keep your dusbuster in a cozy when it's not being used to
&gt;     vacumn up crumbs while you eat?

dustbuster? izzat wunu them iddy biddy vak-you-um sucker thingies? or is
that like a dirt-po-leece? i don't think we have those down here. all we
have are those Big Mutha Tool-Time Tim Taylor Sears Die-Hard 900HP 400PSI
WET-DRY-DAMP Self-Propelled Computer-Controlled Suck-the-chrome-off-a-
trailer-hitch models. :)  i, of course, also have a Suck-a-golf-ball-through-
a-garden-hose model, but it's out in the garage.  when we want VACUUM, we
don't settle for any of that namby-pamby dainty little pick-a-brick-off-
the-carpet crap. we want one that will INHALE that brick!!! :)

actually, i'm pretty much like ... well, somebody out there: a walking
contradiction, partly truth and partly fiction, taking every wrong direction
on my lonely way back home. ;)

but i do love them buses!
