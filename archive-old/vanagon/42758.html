Subject: Under the Bus



                        Under the Bus

Down Baja way when you have a really bad day you get under the
bus.  If you're on trail and the thing will still run you roll it
up on the side of the trail, wait for the ground to cool off then
crawl under.  Shade.

You don't have to get under your bus if you're on pavement. 
Someone will come along pretty soon, carry a message or you to
the nearest place of refuge.  But out in the monte you crawl
under.  Steel makes a better a shade than a tarp and south of
Insurgentes the sun is vertical at noon.

I been laying under the bus a lot lately, wishing I was down in
Baja.  Sixty degrees.  Light rain.  Brisk wind.  Hell of a thing
for late May.  But the bus kept me dry.  Okay, sorta dry.  Then
the axle fell on my head.

The front axle assembly on a bus is fastened to the vehicle with
eight bolts, four to a side.  Big mothers.  12mm x 1.00.  Fine
thread.  Head takes a 19mm wrench and a lot of muscle.  But
that's not the only thing keeping the axle in there, or rather,
keeping it from coming out.  You gotta pull the brake lines off
the wheels and the steering link off the swing-lever and get
those emergency brake cable outta there, along with the clutch
cable -- they run between the torsion tubes on the front axle and
will keep it from coming free, as does the forward section of the
shifter-rod.  When you want the axle to fall on you, all you
gotta do is take all that stuff off then remove the eight bolts,
four to a side.

Of course, it'll just hang there.  That's when I crawled under
the bus to see what was wrong.  Wriggled the axle.  Seemed to be
free.  Wriggled it some more and sure enough, there it came, all
two hundred and fifty pounds of it.

I managed to catch it on my forehead.

The reason it was so heavy was because of the spindles.  And the
brake drums.  I pulled the wheels &amp; tires but left all that other
stuff on there figuring it would be easier to remove once I got
it out of the bus.  And off of my forehead.

My bus has a bad swing-arm pivot.  It also has worn tie-rod ends. 
And the whole outfit was pretty dirty so I figured the best thing
was to pull it out, scrub it down, fix it and put it back.  Don't
ever let someone talk you into doing this unless they're willing
to hang around and help you put the sucker back in.

I took it all apart, right down to the leaves in the torsion
tubes.  Cleaned everything up real nice.  Cleaned and painted the
trailing arms, swapped lefts for rights to even up the wear.

With just the leaves in the torsion tubes the front axle assembly
don't weigh hardly nothing.  Got it into position then crawled
under it, got it across my chest, nice and even, took a grip on
the upper tube and pressed it into place.  Or tried to.  It's a
tight fit.  Crawled out, went around to the right side, built up
a stack of wood under the thing, went around and did the same to
the left side then wriggled one of the bolt-holes into alignment
and stabbed it with a screwdriver.  Went back to the right side,
did the same thing but put in a bolt.

Working back and forth, side to side, I got a couple of bolts
into each flange then wriggled it around, got in the other bolts,
torqued them up nice and even working from side to side.  Started
putting things back together.  Got the cleaned-up trailing arms
back on -- had to use a pipe clamp on the upper ones because the
rubber snubber gets in the way.  Took off the rubber snubber but
it didn't help -- the tube the snubber fits over gets in the way
too.  Pipe clamp worked fine.  Eased the arm up and over the
snubber bar, snugged the arm down on the torsion leaves so the
locking bolt lined up real nice.

Got the Allen-head locking bolts into their pits, the locking
nuts torqued down.  Clamped a hardened steel parallel to the
lower trailing arm eye, measured the offset, calculated the shim
stacks.

Full days work, sixteen hours, most spent cleaning-up and
painting.  It is just past midnight, too dark to fool with
setting up the link-pins, getting the spindles back on.  Hoped to
finish tonight but it looks like I'll have to sleep on it.
