I have a partial set of tent poles for a pre 67 canvas awning for
sale/trade.  I don't have the &quot;L shaped&quot; poles that make up the roof
pitch,  just the straight poles. 

I'm looking for Westfalia wood rack parts.  I need the main hoops, 
uprights etc...  If you have just one piece let me know.

Thanks,
Erik
