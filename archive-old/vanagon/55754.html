Subject: Needed - EV Oil Filters

My dear friends (particularly you EVers):

Some time ago (about two years, I think) there was some traffic about
getting oil filters for the Eurovan in bulk or from some source (mail
oreer) OTHER than a VW($) dealer and saving a few bucks.

I've searched my old message traffic and can't find anything like that.

Now that I'm in a place the dealers love to have us, I'm getting
&quot;everything BUT the grease&quot; when I need to do an oil change.

In my locale (Saint Louis or Joplin, MO are the nearest dealers - both
100+ miles away) the Eurovan oil filter is still listed as a 'dealer
only' item, and it costs BIG bucks!

Got any informationj on a source for Eurovan filters (name, phone,
addresss) that you can pass to me?
