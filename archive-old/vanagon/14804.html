 &gt; Yes, I plan on going.  I'll be leaving Friday afternoon to go to Boone,
&gt; NC to visit friends there &amp; plan to camp Saturday night near Farmington.
&gt; I stayed at a campground within 10 miles of Farmington last year.  Plan
&gt; to parts hunt saturday if you have any hints on where to find &quot;treasure&quot;.
&gt; 
Is that the KOA off I-40? If so, or even if not, how much was it? how
was it? what did you think, etc...

&gt; Keep an eye out for me, I'll be in a '77 Chrome Yellow Westfalia.
Ok, I will be in the rainbow '67...
