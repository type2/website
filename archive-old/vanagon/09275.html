Subject: WestCoastTrip - Sat breakfast


I shall volunteer to make a 24 egg scramble, almost like a Denver
omlette but messier and with more stuff. Feeds about 10 to 12 people.

Things that would go with it - toast, bagels, home fries, hash browns,
salsa, fruit, ?? Could someone please volunteer to bring some such stuff.

 jeff
ps. there are 40mph winds hitting the coast, and some 20+ft waves, and
a whole lot of rain today.
