Subject: Line bore 2 liter?

  Eric Baden's mechanic says he can't get bearings to line bore the case
  for his '81 Vanagon? Same mechanic also wants to use earlier &lt;round port&gt;
  head?

  Eric, I suggest that you call Leonard at AVP in Sacramento, CA. Their 
  phone # is 1 800 548 5766. AVP is the outfit from which I recently bought
  my rebuilt long block and Leonard spent hours &lt;literally&gt; talking with 
  myself and a friend about VW engine rebuilding. He gave us a very thorough
  tour of his shop and during that visit we saw hundreds, if not thousands,
  of cylinder heads. He can probably tell you whether you are better off
  with round ports rather than square. I'd be wary though - if you would
  have to buy the earlier heat exchangers to go with round port heads, they
  might cost as much or more than the rebuilt heads themselves! Leonard 
  should also be able to advise you as to the availiblity of the bearings
  required for your rebuild. I don't think that there is anything unique
  about the bearings in your '81. I theeeenk that main bearings were common
  amongst all the 17/18/2000 engines. It was the rod journals that changed
  in diameter when VW went from 1800 to 2 liters.

  You can tell Leonard you got his name from the Vanagon list - He knows we
  exist but doesn't have internet access yet. 


  Best regards,

  Dave
