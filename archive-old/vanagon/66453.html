Subject:      Clean your luggage rack

A while ago I took the luggage rack completely off the car to see what the
roof looked like underneath.  I couldn't believe the mess underneath.
Fourteen years accumulation of leaves, twigs, earth, etc.  Fortunatly the
roof was perfect underneath - I don't know why it hadn't rusted right
through.  Maybe time to clean yours?
