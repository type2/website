&gt;&gt;yup. that's what it says:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&quot;1985 Discovery Volkswagen Camper, LT400, imported, self-contained, 
loaded,
&gt;&gt; new motor, 6-cyl., diesel, 5 spd., 18 mpg, brakes, tires, winch, shower,
&gt;&gt; stove, sleeps 5, many extras, parts, all paper work, parts all avail. in
&gt;&gt; US, $18,700 obo  (818) 735-7963&quot;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;which is, i think, a Burbank, CA area code. this is the much larger van,
&gt;&gt;built by VW and MAN (of Austria). it looks somewhat like the Vanagon/T3,
&gt;&gt;but is larger. an LT400 (they start at LT250, i think) is a BIG truck. :)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;might be worth a look-see, if you live in the area. :)

&gt;For those east coasters who might be interested in a LT series motorhome
&gt;also, there's one for sale in Jersey. Cheaper too, I think.  It may 
actually
&gt;be at the Atco NJ (Hotco :&lt;) VW show this coming sunday the 13th.
&gt;I'll be there gettin burned to a crisp, as usual.....

The LT series vehicles are referenced as  LT 30, LT 35, LT 40. The number
specify the maximum total weight of the vehicle, LT 40 is specified for
4 tons.

Even the 6 Zylinder seems not to be the original one. The LT is equipped
with AUDI 5 Cyl.. engines. I may be wrong and have to check the leaflets.
