 &gt; &gt;My driver seat armrest has collapsed. 

 &gt; The armrest is attached to a bracket that's attached to the seat.

On my '84 Vanagon GL we have the folding arm rests on the front two seats.  
One came loose so I investigated and found that on these seats, the arm rest 
bracket is held on with two flathead machine screws with allen-wrench sockets 
in them.

You need a 6mm allen to take out the socket head cap screw that holds the rest 
to the bracket, then you can get to the flathead screws.  

One had come OUT, so I put it back.  The wrench I used turned out to be a 5/32 
allen, but I'm sure it's really metric.

I wouldn't bother to post this, but that when I checked the other arm rests, 
EVERY SINGLE ONE was loose.  So tighten 'em up, folks, it only takes ten 
minutes.
