Never run the engine without a thermastat.  Will actualy reduce cooling
capacity as the circulation bypass is also controlled by the thermastat.
 During normal operation though, the engine will run too cool.  I suspect
that you have a bad t-stat or even a bad gauge.  A defective or ungrounded
gauge regulator will cause both the temp and fuel gaufges to read high.  It
is mounted on the back of the instrument cluster.  A plugged radiator will
also cause the engine to run warm.
