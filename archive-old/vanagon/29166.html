Subject: WTB: '65 Bus Nose, Window Surround, Safari Kit
Date: Sat, 18 Nov 1995 11:01:55 GMT

Wanted: Replacement front, including window surround, for '65 Microbus
Deluxe.  Must be in good condition or new.  Unfortunately, Wolfsburg
West is no longer supplying this piece.  Other suppliers?

We'd also like a set of Safari Windows.  We already know about dealers
for these but used ones would be fine if they're in reasonable
condition.
