&gt; pulling the engine out are three separate steps.  You don't have to position

Although this is a great idea, I will note, that I figure driving
the Van up you average set of ramps will provide enough clearance
and may be a lot easier.  I never dropped the Wasserboxer in the
'86 but we did replace the clutch twice, removing the tranny.  I figure
if it was enough room to get out the tranny, would have been enough to
get out the engine as well, but I'm not totally sure.  Anyway was
your average parts store 10&quot; or so pressed steel ramp set.
BTW I note for Bus restorers, driving a Bus back up a set of ramps then
jacking up the front and sitting on another set, provides great
clearance for working beneath the bus, and better stability than jack
stands IMHO.
