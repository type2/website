&gt;&gt;Well, now the bus seems to top out the powerband at around
&gt;&gt;3000 rpm. I thought that an extractor (over the stock m,uffler)
&gt;&gt;would increase top end, not lessen it. I used to be able to turn 45
&gt;&gt;with no trouble, but shortly.

&gt;&gt;What should I do here. It feels like it is having troubles
&gt;&gt;holding 50 MPH, and I get a bad snap-crackel-pop-Boom coasting
&gt;&gt;down a hill in 2nd, overdriving the engine. (Means lean,
&gt;&gt;right) Also increased my oil temp about 20 degrees on the
&gt;&gt;short run
&gt;&gt;I took yesterday.

     Sounds like the muffler is causing some serious
     back-presssure.Especially since you say oil temps went up! Means that
     the engine is working harder to pump the air through.
     Where was this storage closet? In a barn? Maybe there is a mouse nest
     in there! The snap-crackle-pop is an exhaust leak. Fresh air is being
     drawn in during de-accel, and is combusting in your pipes.

&gt;&gt;What jet sizes are people running with this setup? I want torque,
&gt;&gt;but I gotta be able to get 4000 RPM to make 60 MPH. Any slower around
&gt;&gt;here, and Im a traffic hazard. And I have heard that some upsizing
&gt;&gt;of the jets are required when switching to an extractor. And I gotta
&gt;&gt;keep the temp down, even if I have to run a little rich to do it.

     I doubt jet sizes are the problem. If anything, the older motors were
     run a bit on the rich side. I used to use the &quot;adjustable main jet&quot;
     that was avail to lean out the mixture a little on my Bugs. Just gotta
     watch the temps, a little too lean and you will blow it!
