Subject:      neat web stuff (hi-top eurovan)

for those of you with web access (netscape and all that), check out

http://tawny.bu_dot_edu/JandJ/Journal/Journal.html

and go to the Photo Gallery to Look at Germany CD2919-070. it's a picture
of a hi-roof Eurovan. the folks are buying it after tromping around Nepal
and some other places. anyway, the van is apparently a &quot;Fanatic&quot; model. ;)

the rest of the Journal is pretty neat (from what i saw). the only &quot;gotcha&quot;
is that she seems to be calling the van a &quot;Vanagon&quot; instead of a Eurovan! :)
(but the picture looks like a Eurovan to me!)
