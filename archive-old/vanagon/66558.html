&lt;&lt; I would be interested in the experiences of the individual who is using
the Audi
 5000 Turbo wheels. I had an '86 5000 CS turbo.  These are ET35 off-set
wheels.
 Aside from machining the center bore, how did you get the center cap on the
 wheel over the Van's extended hub? How does it handle? Does it track
straight?
 How is the &quot;on-center&quot; feel?
  &gt;&gt;


Actually, they're not ET35.  They're ET45. ( I currently drive a Audi 5000
turbo daily)

Here's what i did.
-bought a set of 4 Audi TURBO wheels at the local junkyard. (who cares about
the Audi center caps, you wont be able to use them anyway)
-got the center hub holes machined out to about 2.5&quot; dia.
(if you want center caps, you can use the vanagon carat wheel center cap, tho
you have to give your machine shop the center cap at the same time you have
the centers of the wheels machined, so they can machine the centers to accept
the vanagon alloy wheel cap.)
it cost me 10 bucks apiece to machine each wheel.
-got some elongated lug studs for the rears (1/4&quot; longer than stock - this
wasnt a syncro, so i only had to get ones for the rears - the elongated studs
on the rears aren't necessary, but more so just piece of mind.)
-use audi 5000 lug bolts up front (NA if a syncro)
-remove those 2 useless bolts on the rear drums that hold the drum to the
stub axle.. (why are those on there anyway??  )
-then theres the fronts...there are 2 ways of doing this.
the first way is to grind the inside rim lip of the wheels a bit. (i've seen
this done)
the second way (and easier) is to run a wheel spacer up front (about 5/16?)
this and the other way are to keep the inside lip of the wheel from rubbing
on some front suspension member who's name escapes me at the moment.
you only need to do this on the fronts, the backs will bolt right on.

as far as handling, it handles as well as any other vanagon., and with the
15&quot; wheels you get a broader range of tires to suit your driving preferences.

as far as a technique to get these on the van without machining, ask Jim
Catterson at
termite_at_rocketmail_dot_com
i dont know how he does it...maybe he uses wider spacers.. (10mm)
he put the audi turbo wheels on his '91 syncro.
