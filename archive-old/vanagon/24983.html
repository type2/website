Hi!
	Went to the junkyards today.

	Saw a few vanagons, lots of breadloafs, no splits :(
	
	Interesting find: in one of the breadloafs was this A/C gizmo.
It's logo said CCOOL.  It went across the ceiling just behind the front
seats, with bridge to another piece above the front window.  It had what
looked like a condensor in it, but I have no idea where the compressor
would be.  One guy was trying to tell me it was electric.  Should I go back 
and snag this piece?

	Saw a safari camper like dave's, too.  Also a camper with a toilet!

	I went out there to get some of those tubes that connect the motor
to the body for the heater.  I got 4 at the first placce, $1 each, and
2 at the second place.  The second place wanted $9, and I said &quot;no way.  I'll
give you $1&quot; and he took it.

	Saw an Oval, most of the good stuff was gone. No rust that I could
find, even under the rear seat.  It had rear seats which may or
may not have belonged to it, and a good gas tank.Wouldada been a good
car excpeft for they use a forklift to move them around, so it was 
kinda tweaked now.

	Another intersting score was a set of chrome and glass driving
goggles - $1 at a garage sale on the way home!  Also got a sears 30 gal 
wet/dry shop vac for $10, and about 15 feet of tubing for it!

	Also saw several BMW's (bavarias, 530is, and 02's) a Lancia,
and a corvair
