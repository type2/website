Subject: Re: Window tinting

I just had my windows tinted about two months ago. I went with the real 
dark shade in the back windows and the darkest legal shade on the driver 
and passenger door. Had it done by a pro. No bubbles. I suspect the ones 
we see with lots of bubbles are done by guys who are trying it for the 
first time in their driveway. I watched the guy do it to mine. Didnt look 
to tough. He cleaned all the windows inside and out real good. Rough cut 
the film and laid it on the outside of the glass. Used special xacto type 
knife to trim to fit on the outside. Wet down glass on the inside. Apply 
film. Use squeegie to get out bubbles. Piece of cake for someone who knew 
what they were doing. 

There is a lot of glass in a vanagon. Expect to pay a premium over normal 
cars/vans. Mine was $250. I shopped around. Price varied from $$200 - $300.

&gt; &gt;I've done my research and am having it done this weekend.  I like
&gt; &gt;a survey for which is best way to go.
&gt; &gt;I've seen lots a vans with windows tinted but two ways really (I
&gt; &gt;think) look good:
&gt; &gt;a. a darker tint (75% grey) all windows except driver side and
&gt; &gt;   passenger side.  i.e. everything behind doors.
&gt; &gt;b. a medium tint  (60% grey) all windows.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; I have a second question: Is there more than one tinting process?  I've
&gt; seen some really bad looking jobs that appear to be stick-on and full of
&gt; air bubbles.  Personally I'd rather wear shades.
