Hi all,

I'm thinking about buying an '89 AdventureWagen Vanagon conversion, but
had a few questions and was hoping folks on this list could help.

What are the pluses and minues of the AdventureWagen compared to the
Westfalia?  I'm a little concerned about the permanently raised roof
(instability in the wind, lower gas mileage, problems with overhangs).  Is
this really a problem?  What about storage space between the two?  It seems
like there is more in the AdventureWagon, but that might just be an
illusion and add-ons (such as a roof rack) are basically not an option.
What about general convenience and comfort (are the amenities and access to
them better/worse in one versus the other)?  Driving-wise, is it better to
have the weight more evenly distributed side-to-side?

Also, how popular are these vehicles?  Do they retain their value as well
as the Westfalias or, being more unknown (and a little funny looking :)),
do they depreciate faster?  Are they difficult to sell?  What sort of price
is fair for one of these in good condition?

Thanks in advance!

p.s. BTW, is there any source of information about AdventureWagen on the
web?  I searched all over but couldn't find anything.
