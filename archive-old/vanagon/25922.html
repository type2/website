Use the clear vinyl available at ``lumber yard department stores'';
places like Home Depot.  It's not optically clear, but it's good
enough that you can tell when something's coming up behind you.
Admittedly, backing up is still best done with side mirrors.

It's kind of expensive if you buy an entire roll and have no other use
for the stuff (around thirty or forty bucks), but you only need about
seven feet for a bus (YMMV, measure first), and sometimes you can
convince them to sell you just what you need.

============================================
They used to sell clear vinyl at fabric stores by the yard.  I used this trick
years ago on a 65 Plymouth station wagon (that was purchased in NJ but in
Phoenix in the summer on a vacation trip and didn't have the heavy duty A/C
that is provided for vehicles native to that area) to keep the passenger area
cool and let the cargo area stay warm.
