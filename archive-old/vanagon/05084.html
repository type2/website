Subject: Cheesy fridge door latch

O.K. what do people who actually use their fridge do to keep the door 
closed? My door no longer stays shut since the cheap metal piece bends 
with the slightest pressure.  Tell me there is a better alternative to 
attaching a padlock latch (like on a tool box) and a pencil to wedge in 
the spot where the padlock would normally go!

                          
                               Later,
                                    Brad
