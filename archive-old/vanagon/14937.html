Subject: this Sunday!


Ok, I think the general concensus is NOT to do a camp thing this weekend,
but rather to meet at the SJ VW swap/show this Sunday afternoon.  Jon
Peters tells me it opens at something like 8 in the morning, so
those of you wishing to make a long day of it may want to show
up there early morning.  I suggest that we all meet somewhere
(Jon, or someone, can you suggest a specific place?) there at
1 p.m.  We can then show videos, see more of the show, and
then do the potluck thing at 5.

Ok, to arrange the food, I need to know how many are planning to
attend, then I'll post some categories for signup.
