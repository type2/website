Subject: Re: Vent window on 84 GL

In a message dated 96-02-02 13:49:57 EST, you write:

&gt;However, the clasp used to secure the window, I can't seem to find 
&gt;out how to remove the backing so that I can reinsert it through the 
&gt;new window hole. Any suggestions? Also, there seems to be some glue 
&gt;on the window at the pivot points?
&gt;
&gt;

Matt,

I sympathize with you.  Some slime did the very same thing to my 85.  The two
pivot points just unscrew with a torx bit.  The pivot lock has a pin that you
have to tap out (VERY GENTLY).  Once this pin is out the mechanism will just
slip out.  The pin is located on the inner side of the lock if it were still
installed in the van.  Good luck.
