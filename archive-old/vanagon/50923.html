&gt;&gt;Hi Volks,
&gt;&gt;        I called the &quot;VW dealer&quot; here in Traverse City, MI to check on the
&gt;&gt;cost of a rear heater core for my '86.&gt;and none of the ancillary bolt-on
stuff like the shut off valve. If they
&gt;still want $800, call Camelback VW at 800.876.5199. Tell them you want the
&gt;Internet discount and I bet they'll send you one for less than $150.

        Or goto a radiator shop, core in hand and tell them, &quot;I want one of
these&quot;.  A real radiatior shop will be able to order a standard core and cut
off and use the end caps off your core that you walked in with.
