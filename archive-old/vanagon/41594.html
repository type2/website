Subject: ground wires/strap (85 vanagon)

This may be nit-picking, but just trying to CMA!

For my 85, in doing the heads, I forgot to note where the following ground
wires were attached.  Can someone help?

There are 3 together in a bundle--I think these go together on the top of the
head.

Another 1 comes from the connector mounted to the water pump assembly.

Another 1 is connected to the distributor cover.

Also, there is a 1/2&quot; flat braided strap, about a foot long, grounded to the
body under the ignition coil.



If anyone can tell me where these go, thanks-- I'm about ready to turn the key 
(after 6 months!)

David
