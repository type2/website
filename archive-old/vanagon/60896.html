Larry:
	 I don't know where you saw this vehicle, but it sounds like one that
was for sale in AutoWeek several months ago, haven't seen the ad lately.
It said it was a Volvo diesel powered, 4 wheel drive, VW camper. wanted
$24000 for it. It was located in Utah. I believe it was listed as a
1983. Sounds interesting, huh!

To everyone:
	It would be very helpful when you have something for sale, or need
help, to tell what area of the world you are in.
