it would appear that the bay area up north (the one sitting atop the next
Big One! :)  is the clear leader.
the only CA i don't know what to do with is Eric Townsend ... i don't
know if he's north or south. :)

for the grumbling Washingtonians, you'll notice that your request has
been granted. big deal, you're all on the west side.  but i don't
know where three of you are.
Eric Oster, and Ben McGough ... i don't know where they are. and
Rick Gordon is on some island that i can't find on the map ... i can
assume it's over by the ocean, but i'm not sure. ;)

i guess texas and pennsylvania are next, eh?

sigh. the things i do just to keep other people happy. :(
