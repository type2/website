Subject: Re: &quot;Eurovan Can't Get Hitched&quot;

Gee, I don't know...My 1995 Eurovan has a 2&quot; receiver hitch
(by Reese) which was installed by a local hitch and trailer 
supply.  The mounting replaced various amazingly heavy metal
bits which I think used to hold the rear bumper on.  No muss,
no fuss.

Of course, I use it for bikes &lt;grin&gt;.

&gt; We have a friend that needs a bike rack for a 1997 Eurovan for a cross

a
&gt; trailer hitch attached to it, so therefore they could not mount a bike 
rack.
