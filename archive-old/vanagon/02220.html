Subject: Re: &quot;Muir solenoid trick, and resistance!

I have been watching this thread with considerable interest because I 
have the same problem.  Every once in a while the car would not crank.  I 
started fine on a roll, but no crank at all.  I looked up the diagnostic 
in the VW shop manual and tested the solenoid by shorting it to the wire 
coming straight from the battery to the starter.  Not only did the 
solenoid click, the stater cranked the engine (never work on a car in 
gear).  Indeed for a week afterward, everything worked fine.  Then 
repeat... etc., etc.  After a while, the only way to start the beast was 
to turn on the ignition, crawl under it and crank it from the solenoid
(I am real tolerant of car faults). eventually this got to be wearing and 
so I decided to look into it.
  The things I have tried include:
1) clean all the contacts.
      basic but it helped a little
2) test ignition switch and wire from ignition switch to solenoid wire.
   also tested double relay and all other wires linked to starter circuit.
       switch, relay, and wires tested OK with minimal ohms resistance.
       wished for an ampherage guage that handled 60amps DC (no go)
3) checked alternator output and fan belt tightness
       the nut had fallen off the bolt at the bottom of the alternator 
       and the belt was loose as a goose. replaced bolt and belt. 
       tightened all.  got a 25% reduction in problem, but not a complete
       solution.
4) test battery 
       replaced battery, which reduced problem frequency by 90%
5) gave up
       I am resigned to crawling under the car once in a while.
Let me ask, however, for someone to post the original &quot;Muir solenoid 
trick&quot; as I missed that posting.
