&gt; &gt;    Hey you guys,
&gt; &gt;    
&gt; &gt;    Just order something from them, i.e., send them some $$$, and 
they'll be
&gt; &gt;    glad to pay attention and send a catalogue with the order

my friend sent his $$ for just their catalouge and never got one! he 
finally gave up phoning them long distance to find out what was going on. 
The phone bills were costing him more than the catalouge was worth!.
&gt; &gt;    &gt;........
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Since I am probably one of several who only
&gt; &gt;knows of them from this list and only knows
&gt; &gt;how to reach them via their non-functioning
&gt; &gt;AOL account, perhaps you could tell me what
&gt; &gt;the physical address is?
&gt; &gt;
