Subject: Re: oil change help

Thanks for all your help, this is how it worked out:

The nut for the oil screen was fine and easy to remove. By the oil drain
plug being stripped I mean the nut was almost rounded so when I tried to
turn it the edges became more rounded.  It was a 13mm but the socket I had
couldn't get a grip on it.  I went to my mechanic and borrowed a different
socket and that got a firmer hold but I still couldn't budge it.  I tried
liquid wrench, but I didn't want to go as far as vice grips because I would
have to put something back on and I didn't want to rip it to shreds. I
didn't have a pipe to put over the ratchet handle for leverage so I ended
up taking it to oil changers and had them deal with it.

Thanks to the earlier postings about these guys I hovered over them. I told
them about the screen and had them take it out. I looked it over and it
looked in really good shape so I will change that the next time around. In
the meantime I will check the gasket for leakage. the only problem was he
put in 4.2 quarts of oil instead of 3.7 so I had them take some out.


Thanks for the response!!

Maggie
