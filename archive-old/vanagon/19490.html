Subject:      just a reminder: Tomorrow is Friday ...

ok, folks ... now i KNOW that there are more silly people out there than
just me (Alistair, are you listening??), so let's not forget that tomorrow
is FFFriday. and it is tradition (started by that slacker, Bill Kennedy!)
for folks to produce some strange stories/poetry/rhymes/recipes/etc.

just a warning.  :)
