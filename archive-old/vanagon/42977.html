Subject: Red and White Bus on Blocks, or should I bother? 
Date: Sun, 26 May 1996 10:01:19 -0700

Hello everyone,
While I'm biding my time until there is a convergence of funds and product 
availability on the Eurovan front, I've been watching a red and white bus 
next door to my sister in law's house grow moss.

Thinking this would be a nice bridge vehicle until the EV, I was wondering 
if I might get some direction from the list members regarding the 
following:

1. Where would I access the FAQ that would tell me what year this bus is? 
My guess is that it is a mid '70s, red on the bottom, white on the top, 
without the white &quot;V&quot; on the front.
2. Does the FAQ contain info about relative value of busses? (For example, 
this bus looks fairly straight and complete, but is rumored not to have the 
engine installed.)
3. Should the bus be for sale, which book(s) might you recommend for repair 
work?
4. Any tips for approaching the owner about selling his bus and negotiating 
a price?

Thanks in advance for answers to the above and any other info or advice you 
might have.
