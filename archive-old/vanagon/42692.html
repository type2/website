Subject: '82 Westy idle speed too high
Date: Wed, 22 May 96 13:09:04 -0500

Hi all,

Joined the list a few days ago. Someone just asked my main question before I had
a chance.  Haven't seen an answer yet, so I'll ask too.

The idle speed on my aircooled 2.0 L is way too high.  I'm sure it's not a 
vaccuum leak, I just spent the time and money to replace _every_ seal and 
grommet on the engine intake side (and the engine compartment too).  I am sure 
that it is mechanical wear in the intake  butterfly valve.  It won't 
consistantly seat in the same spot, so the idle varies alot.  Sometimes when I 
stop at a stoplight I can tap the gas and the engine speed will come down, 
sometimes not.  I've looked at the plate in the valve, and it is worn such that 
it gets 'cocked' in the bore slightly sometimes, leading to the high idle.  The 
air by-pass screw adjustment is maxed out.

So my question, does anyone fix these things, or is there an aftermarket version
available?  Last time I checked the dealer wanted several hundred ($300?) or so 
for a new one.   Maybe someone has a used one they are willing to part with?  
Rather get this one fixed if I can.

TIA
