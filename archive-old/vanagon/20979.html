Alistair Bell  asks: 

&gt;But lo, another mystery... one of the pushrods has been &quot;grooved&quot; about &gt;1
1/2&quot; from one end. It is as if it was done on a lathe, 1/4&quot; long, 1/4&quot;
&gt;deep. I only noticed it after I had all of the pushrods from one side in a
&gt;tub so I don't know wether it was the head or case end.

Sounds like your push rod tube had a sharp edge on one end, maybe nearest the
lifter.  I've seen milder versions on some push rods from an engine I tore
down.  The lifter will do the rotating and the edge could do the cutting.
 Maybe the depth is related to the destruction of the cam lobes, etc?
