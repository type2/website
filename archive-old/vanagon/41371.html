Subject: '54 RDH Deluxe update - metal toy store

        I took a break from cutting and welding to pick up some metal I need
to fabricate additional pieces.  I wen to this place in Sacramento called
Blue Collar. 
        
        I'd never been there before.  The place is a metal toy store!  Every
type of metal, fastener, dohickey and whatsit is there.  I bought a 4x8
sheet of .080 mild steel to use to fabricate the rest of the frame rails.
Paid $45.  Gotta keep this place in mind for the other parts of this project
coming down the pike...
