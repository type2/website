Subject: Winchs ? ? ? 

Hello All,
  Anyone know if the front bumper on the EV's can support the stress of a
winch. I was thinking of getting a winch that can has 4,000 lb. of line pull
for the front bumper. I was also thinking of getting a trailer hitch
put on and the adapter to put a winch on the hitch. Anyone with know how
in this area, suggestions are welcomed.
