Westy 2nd Battery
Hi,

I have an 88 Westy with a constant relay connecting two batteries.  The relay
separates the two batteries when the ignition is turned off.
I'm replacing the accessory (2nd) battery which sits behind the driver's seat. 
I've been using a standard auto battery but it's not holding a charge very long
anymore.  It's been in service for about 2 years and *usually* rarely gets used
for more than a few hours of reading light/cell phone/portable computer use. 

I have a few questions:
1.  Is it a good idea to use a 'deep cycle' battery?
2.  What's the difference between the two different types (standard vs deep
cycle)?  Will a deep cycle battery last longer (in terms of years of use)?
3.  Does anyone have suggestions for a good (and preferably inexpensive) battery
that fits in the 7&quot; tall x 11&quot; wide x 6.5&quot; deep compartment in the vanagon
behind the driver's seat?  Model number/supplier/mfg/cost?

Thanks a zillion.  If possible please email me directly as well as posting to
the list as I'm off-list right now but check the archives regularly.

P.S. Martha-who was that who installed the golf cart batteries for you in Big
Sur?  Was it David?  David are you there?
