Subject: Re: Headlight oddity


&gt;&gt;But that Chev alternator does have a few odd characteristics. When I
&gt;&gt;first start the engine, the alternator light stays on, and voltage at
&gt;&gt;the battery is rght around 11.5 to 12 volts-- obviously the alternator
&gt;&gt;isn't alternating, and the battery is discharging as it supplies current
&gt;&gt;for ignition, lites etc.
&gt;
&gt;It's bad ju-ju. I suggest you tape a five dollar bill and an Ace of spades
&gt;to the inside of the engine compartment. Lighting  a few candles wouldn't
&gt;hurt either.


This would be the smallest sum I've spent on a VW in quite a while!   :^)
