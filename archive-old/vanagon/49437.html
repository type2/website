Subject: Weddle Engineering, Locking Differentials, &amp; Syncros

Vanagonites &amp; Syncronauts,

I know the subject of locking differential and Weddle Engineering has come up
before, but I thought an update could be useful as well as some more complet
information about Weddle.

I just talked with Chris Weddle (wed-el) of Weddle Engineering.  
Chris is the son in a father/son team of their 2-man shop.  

Their phone number is:
(310) 310-598-2731

Their mailing address is 
Weddle Engineering
P.O. Box 15466
Long Beach, CA 90815

They specialize in mail-order repair/rebuild of VW transaxles and
installation of locking differentials in VWs and trucks/SUVs.  He said that
they sometimes get more help when business demands it.  Although they don't
have any &quot;walk-in&quot; business, you could visit their shop by appointment.


Lock-Right locking Differentials:
----------------------------------------
Weddle sells the Lock-Right lockers manufactured by PowerTrax.
For the Vanagon they have two different models depending on which
transmission you have.  

The model #1310 is for transaxles with 2 spider gears and installed in vans
up to 1985.  They sell the 1310 for $264. + installation.

The model #1311 is for transaxles with 4 spider gears and installed in vans
from 1986 to 1991.  They sell the 1311 for $293. + installation.

If you need to ship or deliver your transaxle to them and they'll do the
installation.  Installation costs around $100 for each unit.

This type of locking differential will change the handleing characteristics
of a vehicle in a curve or around a corner and can make the handleing
unpredictable if you're applying significant power or changing the amount of
power mid-curve.  Has anyone on the list driven a Vanagon equiped with a
Lock-Right in the rear differential who can shed some first hand light on
this topic? 


ARB locking differentials:
------------------------------------
ARB is a maker of air operated locking differentials that are manually
engaged at the discretion of the driver.  Chris said that an ARB could be
installed in the rear diff of a Vanagon but that it would cost much more than
the Lock-Right due to the need to use a different transmission case, and
install air lines and an air compressor.  He did not have a price for this.
 It sounded like he'd looked into doing it and had a plan, but he didn't seem
as if they've done this before.


For Syncros:
----------------------------
Chris said that the Lock-Right can be installed in the front differential of
a Syncro for about the same price as in the rear.  Installation may be a
little less.

I asked about installing a VW vacuum locking differential in the front diff
of a Syncro that didn't come from the factory with one.  He said that they
have not done that but have looked into it.  They found that the Vanagons
with locking front diffs also had different part numbers for their front CV
joints and axles.  Chris speculated that this must be stronger axle
components to handle the stress of having the front diff locked-up, but
couldn't say for sure.  I speculate that he might have been looking at a
fiche of a 16&quot; wheeled Syncro and that the different axle components may have
been required due to that difference.  Who knows?

Chris said that they sometimes can get ahold of 5.43:1 ring &amp; pinion ratios
to replace the standard (for North America) 4.86:1 ratio gears.  He said the
parts were hard to get and said that the switch was fairly expensive.  They
have done this before by selling a remanufactured transaxle with the new gear
ratios and taking a normal transaxle in as a core.

Chris sounded knowledgable and was pleasant to talk with.
