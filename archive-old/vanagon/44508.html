Subject: Re: Vanagon engine transplants /f


&gt;Why don't the police put up a sign on that stretch of highway warning
&gt;against using JATO units strapped to various Chevys (Sometimes it's a
&gt;nova), since it's obvious that someone hits that rock face at least once
&gt;a month in this manner, what with all the differences reported each time
&gt;this urban legend is re-hashed?

I first saw this story about a year ago, possibly in its original form
since there were no exploding tires or marks from same, no melted asphalt
from the rocket, and no sign the vehicle had become airborne.

Plus ce change, plus de le meme chose...

I'm still waiting for the report on whoever's putting the 1400 HP engine
from a P-51 in his Vanagon (no, it isn't me). How many times will that
story be re-posted until the van is flipping over and over sideways from
engine torque alone while going in a straight line.
