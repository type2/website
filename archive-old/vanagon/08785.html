Subject: Re: Need advice:  Trouble after rebuild
Date: Mon, 26 Dec 94 21:11:44 EST

Having gone through a similar experience, after a rebuild (engine caught
fire - so  perhaps count yourself lucky) here is what I think may be your
problem: the valves were/are too too tight/ timing is too far advanced. It is
not
uncommon for the valves to tighten up after a rebuild. It is therefore a
good idea to readjust them after an initial 20 minute break-in. Tight
valves will cause an engine to overheat and cause a loss of power as you
describe. 
 Your best bet would be to go for the tow - check the compression and
timing and the valves on all four cylinders. Let us know how it turns out

&gt; Dear air-cooled Wizards:
&gt; 
&gt; Well, I just got through rebuilding the 1600 in my bus.  Everything
&gt; seemed fine for the first 50 miles, and then I started to 
&gt; lose power.  Now there is a loud growl from the crankcase and she
&gt; doesn't idle so good.  Can anyone offer advice as to what might
&gt; be wrong, and how I could have caused this?  Second, I'm currently
&gt; 35 miles from home -- should I call a tow truck, or have I already
&gt; done the damage I'm going to do and just (try to) drive it home?
&gt; 
&gt; Here's what I have done to the engine:
&gt; 
&gt; 1)  New (used) case, line-bored, new crank and cam bearings to fit.
&gt; 2)  Old crank and cam measured OK, reused.
&gt; 3)  New pistons and cylinders.
&gt; 4)  Old heads ground, new valves and guides.
&gt; 5)  Oil pump in spec, reused.
&gt; 6)  I followed Muir meticulously during this procedure.
&gt; 
&gt; Any advice from old hands gratefully accepted.
