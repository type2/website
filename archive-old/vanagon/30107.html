&gt; I am using four Yakima 'wide body brackets' (adapters) screwed on(in)to the

&gt; the inside) to put on the regular high Yakima raingutter rack system. Have
&gt; carried up to four single / two double sea kayaks on it w/o any problems,
&gt; exept for the inconvenience of loading and unloading &lt;grin&gt;. However, I
&gt; always use additional straps to hold down the poptop, and bow- and
&gt; sternlines to keep poptop, racks, and gear on the van! You have to remove
&gt; the kayaks to pop up the top, but can leave the racks on!

The PO of my '74 camper did pretty much the same thing. He too used to
carry kayaks and I now use it for my sailboards.  In addition, he put 
in two wooden struts about 80cm long which hinge down from the ceiling 
of the pop top.  When the pop top is up (mine is the type which remains 
level when it's 'popped') the struts are swung down and slid onto the 
edges of the pop top opening.  This provides extra support, letting me 
leave the gear tied on. This setup works well although you need a bit
of strength with a full load on top, and the bed in the pop top can't 
be used. 

One word of warning.  The extra weight on the pop top has caused some 
excessive wear where it contacts the underlying fibreglass cowling.
