&gt; &gt;Thanks Tim!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Wish I had a garage, my hands are gonna' be COLD!
&gt; 
&gt; Well, it is a PIA to bleed the 2WD clutch because the bleed screw is only
&gt; reachable while lying underneath.  You _may_ be able to get at it, it's
just
&gt; ahead of the engine on drivers side, inch or so forward of the trans
face.
&gt; Heating gently to get it working, followed by a bleed would be my first
go,
&gt; since I'm a cheap bastard and the FLAPS here still cost a bit. No Kyle
deals
&gt; avail.  Oh... phone the dealer too, they now use the Brasilian
rebuilts/new
&gt; units and their brake parts prices have dropped by 50-70% in last couple
of
&gt; years.  It's likely not worth trying to get a seal kit and rebuild it,
odds
&gt; of screwing up are good, need a hone,  time hurts, and you may end up
doing
&gt; it again anyhow.  Since you are selling, do the least decently possible,
&gt; heat/bleed.  Then buy the cyl?  I don't have a garage either, dammit.  If
&gt; you have to go under, get some heat in the engine, run it up to temp.
&gt; Touching cold metal really draws the heat out of you fast.  This can make
&gt; the diff between hellish and just regular misery. ;)  bye, tim
