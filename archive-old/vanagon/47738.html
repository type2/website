 Anyone know what needs to be done to remove and disconnect the EGR Valve 
 in a 2 Litre FI Bus engine?  Any vacuum lines need to be plugged?

Assuming everything is set-up correctly, you should save money to buy
repalcement engines.  The EGR on these engines lowers combustion chamber
temps,(Peak Flame Temperature).  This reduces the tendancy of the engine to
knock, ping, and melt pistons.  The control of the PFT also reduces smog by
reducing the formation of NOX.
