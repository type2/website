Subject: 72 bus for sale

My friend has a stock 1972 bus he would like to sell.  It's located in
San Jose, CA.  Everything is stock, there has been no major work done.
The engine seized up on him yesterday.  The odometer reads ~73,000 he says
its probably ~273,000.  The Bus is parked in from of MY house and can't
stay there any longer than a week.  If you're interested in saving this
bus you need to hurry.  He is asking for $200.00, you tow it away.

Contact:  Al Beltran  at  (408) 366-7945  with any questions.

Thanks
