Subject: Re: Wasserboxer ATF cooler replacement

I just did this same job about a week ago. There was no problem disconnecting
the front tranny mount and lowering it a couple inches to get to the 
upper bolt on the atf cooler. Just keep it supported with a jack and you 
will be fine. I spent more time studying what needed to be done than 
actually unbolting it and doing it. It turned out to be pretty easy. Go 
for it.
