Subject: Re: coil spring adjusters \ 73 bus

To those that have emailed me privately asking about my shocks, I'm sorry
but I don't have a source for them.  I got them used, and they look like
they have a few miles on them.  I couldn't find any brand names on them,
but I didn't look that hard.  The shocks themselves are yellow.  My friend
Mitch has an identical set on his '73 bus as well.
