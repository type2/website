&lt;&lt; Does anyone out here have power door locks? If so, how is the wire to the
 sliding door routed? I am installing  an aftermarket kit and am stumped at
 how to do a sano installation, all the other doors have hinges so this is
not
 a problem. Is there slack in the wire when the door is open or ?  &gt;&gt;

Derek,
The wiring to the sliding door goes through a 4-pin contact on the front end
of the door jamb.  There are 4 spring-loaded pins on the jamb and 4 contact
pads on the leading edge of the door.  When the door is closed the circuits
are connected.

I installed aftermarket door locks on my 87 Syncro and found that the best
way to replicated this VW setup was to just purchase the VW parts.  I was
able to find mine at a junkyard.  The other place where you'll need VW parts
is in the lock assembly for the rear hatch.  I studied the mechanism for
several hours and came up with 2 or 3 different ways to fabricate linkage &amp;
brackets and attach a lock actuator to it.  Unfortunately, none of them
seemed adequate to me.  I decided the best way would be to use a VW lock
assembly designed for the power door locks (yes, they're quite different).  I
was able to find this a a junkyard as well.  I recall VW's price on it was
prohibitively expensive.  With this lock assembly in hand, I disassembled it
and my original one and swapped the keying cams so that the new lock would
work with my van's keys.

The whole thing was a bit of work, but well worth it.  While you're at it I
hope you're including a remote function on the power locks.  I love being
able to just pust the little button on the remote and hear the locks go!

Good luck,
