Subject:      skid plates

i got my copies (i have one in german and another in english ... originals,
that is, in addition to the copy Derek sent me) from these folks:

    Kundendienst / Customer Assistance
    VOLKSWAGEN AG
    D-38436 Wolfsburg
    GERMANY

they were very nice to send me the stuff, but they kept getting it wrong!
first it was in german, then they sent the one for the Golf/Passat!!! so
FINALLY i get the bus/vanagon/LT one in english!!  only took about a year. :)

so anybody that wants a genuine vw tech manual, in its own little blue
cover, them's the folks to write to. :)
