If you are not averse to traveling 30+ miles south to San Jose, then I know an
excellent mechanic/garage for working on VW busses. Hoffee's garage in SJ,
don't remember the number, he's in the phone book. Mechanic is a VW trained
master and knows his stuff...oh yeah, he's very reasonable too..
the usual disclaimers, blah, blah, blah...
