&gt; You need to treat yourself to some fun reading.  You should get a copy
&gt; of the 'Idiot Book' and read the part about checking the electronics.
&gt; It's not that hard.  Muirs book gives you enough to get started checking
&gt; the basics which is usually what's wrong most of the time.
&gt;
&gt; You browse the book stores for other books that introduce you to electronics.
&gt; Maybe one of the Fuel Injection manuals would be good.
&gt;
&gt; You may even track down your troubles before the MG's do.  As a matter
&gt; of fact, I guarantee it.  ;)

Great idea, Steven!  I actually have about 3 copies of the idiot book, from
multiple purchase of splitties in the past with hidden treasures included
under seats and all...  I remember that section for the squarebackers.
Good writeup, and based on the Common Sense approach that I crave (but
seldom see).  I'll do as you suggest and seek out an auto electronics book,
too.  Been frustrated with not only the EV's problems, but the daughter's
Volvo has a rough idle and surges that the damned Chilton manual is poor at
helping me solve.  The wife's Montero
is FI'ed, too, but that thing just works forever, it seems (unlike a
certain EV).
