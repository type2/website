&gt; I noticed that Harbor Freight has a 
&gt;3/8&quot; drive, 0-80 ft/lbs(unit?) for under $20.   Is this a good wrench for 
&gt;a do-it-yourselfer? Or should I pay the $50+ for a Craftsman?  (I hope 
&gt;this is not a religious issue.)

Craftsman also sells a less expensive one.  I bought it a few weeks ago and I
think I paid $20.  It's a pointer and scale style wrench.  By the way I saw
it at the local Pep-Boys (with different packaging) for $30.
