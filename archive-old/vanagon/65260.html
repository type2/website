Hi Budd,

Just so happens that I also have an '86 Syncro, and if I run a
multi-viscosity oil like the 10-40 you mentioned, I have similar
low-pressure warning lights and buzzers going off.  I checked with AVP,
from whom I purchased my rebuilt 2.1 waterboxer, and the technician
there told me they never recommend anything but straight 30-weight for
Vanagons.  Well, I'm currently running straight 40-weight for the
summer, and the change took care of the low-pressure problem.  Come the
cold El Nino-based winter that I'm sure is right around the corner, I'll
change to a 20-50, but the AVP guys say to never go to a 5-xx or 10-xx
weight.  Might be worth a try going to a single-viscosity oil.

What do the techies on the list think of using 30-weight versus
multi-viscosity oils?  I'd be interested in having some others confirm
the AVP advice.

As to the Beatles names for your vehicle, my Syncro wears &quot;RANCID&quot;
plates so I'd have to vote for something more punk.
