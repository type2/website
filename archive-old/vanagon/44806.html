Subject: Mid Atlantic Camping: Yes to Dogs!

To all interested parties:

This is National Forest land, and dogs are allowed, as long as they are 
&quot;restrained&quot;. I count two so far...

Kids are also allowed, and it looks like there will be a goodly number 
of them as well - many more than dogs. They will probably be less 
restrained.

Bring either an entree, salad/veggie, or dessert for Saturday nite.

Friday arrivals will go off to sample the off-road trails Saturday 
morning, so if you arrive then and don't see a bunch of buses, have 
faith...we will be make a point of being back around lunchtime.
