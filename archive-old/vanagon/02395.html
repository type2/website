Subject: Re: 1988 Syncro Pickup


&gt;1988 Syncro Pickup &lt;single cab with canvas cover and frame&gt;,
&gt;California legal, facotry wheels and top. 80,000 miles. Very rare.
&gt;$24,000. (206) 454-8066 Message phone only. I will return your call.


These beasts were imported into Canada, I've seen a couple of the double cab 
versions, my personal favorite. No canvas up though. The $24K strikes me as 
outrageous! Canada's biggest dealer for the Vanagons is Owasco VW in Oshawa 
Ont., a call to them might start a reasonable search, especially if you told 
them that the price could be up to $30,000Cdn. for a 5 year old vehicle that 
sold for ~$22,500Cdn. new.              tim s.
