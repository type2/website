&gt; I live outside of New Roads (upriver from BR, across the river from St.
&gt; Francisville, towards Marksville).  Ian, if you're from Shreveport,
&gt; you've probably heard of it--but no one else on the list would have!

	Hey, What do you mean no one else on the list would have? We live in 
Jackson (that's Jackson, Louisiana) right across the river from you 
(Tonya Pope), just east of St Francisville. We have been looking 
around for somewhere to work on the Westfalia in case we come across 
something which we can't handle ourselves. Any ideas?
	Also, anyone know what the consequences are of removing the cat 
converter and nothing else (back pressure change?)? I'm thinking of it 
because I might want to take the Westfalia to Central America via 
Mexico and have concerns about being able to find unleaded 
everywhere(anywhere!). 

Thanks.
