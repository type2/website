Subject:      VR6 Bus now with text

Hi Volks,

   For those of you interested, I finally got the first quick-and-dirty
translation of the VR6 bus story posted on the web page.  Check it out at

http://www.relitech_dot_com/helmut/VR6-engine/vr6-engi.htm

   But do not stop by the Volkswagen Bus Engine Swap Page. The new page
is not linked yet. There still is a problem with the color table used for
the .GIF images, but clicking on there shows you tho whole extended picture
in natural colors. Any help in fixing spelling/grammar failures would be
appreciated.

Thanks.
