Subject: Carb Icing? ('68 SP)

Hi Volks,
	 I had some problems on my way to work this morning, which I
suspect may be due to carb icing. Can anyone confirm/deny that these
symptoms add up:

 The van:	'68 with Single port 1600 upright, reconditioned last month
			(No preheater hose to air cleaner)
 The weather:	Just above freezing, heavy rain showers
			(Snow over ~800m, I'm at sea level)
 The problem:	Fine at startup. Short warmup (late for work...)
		After a few minutes, misfires followed by stall at lights
			(checked electrical connections- noticed frost
			 on intake plumbing below carb)
		After a short wait with engine off, restarts, runs,
			still misses at medium-high revs
		Rest of trip to work (half hour) the missing gradually
			diminishes and van will run at my normal 55-60 mph.
			(on arriving at work the intake is still frosted)

 Does this sound like a reasonable diagnosis? If so then I guess I should
try to find the parts to reconnect the preheat hose: The tube from tin to
air cleaner is just that, isn't it? What is the flap on the air cleaner
supposed to be connected to? From my '71 I recall a cable but not what should
be at the other end of it (some sort of thermostat?).

 Thanks for any help offered!

	W.
