Thanks to those who replied to my post on the bumperstickers.  Well it now 
seems that the web server here at ohio-state is a little messed up, so it will 
be a few days before everything is restored.  I can't even get into my own home
page.  For thoses who were interested the stickers consist of either a bug or
bus on jacks with its engine out and a skeleton working on it with th word
FahrFromMoven written across it.  It was just a neat little drawing I made on
my computer.  Just woundering what all you air cooled people thought.  In case
I actually decide to print them out.  Once again as soon as the server is back
up, They can be seen at http://www.cis.ohio-state_dot_edu/~winemill . Unless
they completey change the server to a new location and then I will let those
interested know the new location.
Thanks
Brad
