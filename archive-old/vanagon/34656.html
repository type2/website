Subject: Re: EV Panel Van and Value

&gt; &gt; We couldn't be happier with our MV.
&gt; 
&gt; I was looking for an MV Weekender when I bought my GL.  VW's 800 number was
&gt; great at locating all the new EVs in the US.  Took them about a week to do
&gt; it.  Turned out that there were only 2 MV weekenders left, in Hawaii, and
&gt; they were both automatics, so I bought the GL.

No MV non-weekenders?

&gt; &gt; EV Panel Vans ARE sold in Canada at very low prices. I saw one at work in
&gt; &gt; Montreal last week. Also, last fall I found a VW Dealer in Edmonton Alberta
&gt; &gt; advertising on the NET. Their Transporter Panel Van, apparently available
&gt; &gt; with a 2.4 litre 5-cylinder diesel engine, lists for $20,995 Canadian. That's
&gt; &gt; about $15,785. US. Don't know what one would need to do in order to bring
&gt; &gt; it into the States.
&gt; 
&gt; That's an awesome price!  [which makes me wonder, why does VW list the
&gt; basic van used to make the 95 camper at about 22K?  I figured it SHOULD be
&gt; around 16K.  If you add their 9K for the camper interior (cripes!) on top
&gt; of that, it still wouldn't be too expensive, and I'D be driving one today!
&gt; I doubt very much if you could import a diesel truck to use in California,
&gt; at least.  As far as the rest of the US???

The camper is based on an extended length EV/T4, could that help explain 
it?  Extra reinforcements on the bottom to allow the roof to be cut open?

&gt; Don't understand why VW doesn't bring the trucks back to the US.  People
&gt; are actually DRIVING those Japanese substitutes!

Thought it was protectionist tariffs and laws...
