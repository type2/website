Subject: Car Talk


&gt;   These car talk guys slam the VW vans every chance they get, advising people
&gt;   that the only good thing about the vans is that you can sleep in them when
&gt;   they break down. I am not sure I can disagree with them technically, although
&gt;   they haven't addressed the matter of heart.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
Well, they also say some nice thing about them, too (as other posters
mentioned)
However, contrary to what the other posters said, they have a *much*
lower opinion of Volvos, especially their driving chracteristics.  They also
love to beat up on Pintos Escorts, etc....

All in all, I've only heard them talk rescpectfully about Mercedes, the
Ford F-150 truck and a couple of other brands...

One remark they made made to that 16-yr old about the VW Bus was that it
would not break down on him, because, technically, the van would never
be completely 'unbroken' anyway...

I like to listen to them, but I guess I'd never call them up.  Imagine the flak
one would get when forced to admit they own two VW vans!!!
