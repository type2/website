&gt; I was at the local used book store during lunch today (looking for a
&gt; Bentley manual), and found the book &quot;Fix Your Volkswagen&quot; by Jim Purvis.
&gt; Kind of a fun book as it was published in 1964 and covers both the 1200 and
&gt; 1500. It's got the original cover on the front with a bunch of elves
&gt; climbing all over a Bug.  No bus specific content, but still fun to thumb
&gt; through. Anyone used it before?

I had the '68 version which was bought by my dad shortly after
he bought the '69 bug. Good pictures, but, I don't know, 
kinda like a paraphrased Bently. Maybe better reading as
a referance work than to be used as a service manual.
