&gt; Here's a credulity-straining opportunity one of you H2O enabled Vgon fans
&gt; may wish to investigate:  1991 Westy, said to have 3000 original miles,
&gt; $12,500.  Located in Hackensack NJ.  I stopped to see it because it is so
&gt; pretty: white, with the Carat wheels and lower body cladding.  Body looks
&gt; perfect with exception of a small but severe ding on the passenger side
&gt; rear corner: maybe 3/4&quot; deep and confined to an area 2&quot; in diameter.
&gt; 
&gt; Story is told that the camper was used very little and then stolen.  When
&gt; it was recovered the transmission was gone, so it sat some more.  Then the
&gt; transmission was replaced and it sat some more.  Now the owner and the
&gt; shop the van is at want to get it sold; the way they are advertising it is
&gt; by letting it sit in the same spot without a For Sale sign for four months
&gt; or so now.

You better watch out that Derek Drew doesn't get a hold of it.  He'll chop
it up and store it in his fathers attic for spare parts!  ;)

Otherwise, it sounds like a pretty good deal.
