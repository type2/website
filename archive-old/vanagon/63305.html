&gt;I have a '93 Eurovan MV which has a couple of broken cupholders($30/each

&gt;Vanagon MV. They are square with the &quot;cover&quot; folding down to become the
&gt;base and a plastic ring folding up to hold the cup. I don't see a VW
&gt;part # on them. I've been told one can buy the exact same thing at
&gt;WalMart or PepBoys for about $9. The only thing I found at WalMart was a
&gt;$3 cheap black plastic cup holder that resembles it but it won't last a
&gt;week. Anyone seen these?

I'm not sure if it will help you, but check out
