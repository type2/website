Well this is my $.02, seems to me that our early
diesel Vanagon, '82 or '83 can't remember had the
same manual adjusters as the late buses, but our
'86 I swear was self adjusting, however it seems the
self adjustment may not always have worked because
I swear I used to adjust them manually anyway and
recall taking the drums off and trying to figure why
they weren't adjusting, but could have been on a Jetta
or Rabbit as well, all our VW's run together in my mind.
A good tip incidentally if your adjusters are geting
hard to turn, frozen up with rust, gunk, etc.  Take them
apart now while you can, clean the surfaces of the little
star thingy and the thing it rides in and the threads.
Use some fine sandpaper followed with degraser, then apply
a good antiseize, sparingly but enough for a thin coat on
everything, antiseize can take the heat and won't melt
onto the shoes but will sure make adjustment easier next
time, particularly on an old bus.
