Trace and Bill wrote of EV MV table problems:

I've encountered Bill's problem; the one w/ the table that refuses to stay
put.
This was my solution:
1. take the two screws that hold it (the latch) to the bottom of the table.  
2. determine which way the latch needs to move (in my case, it needed to move
closer to the edge of the circular metel ring, which cannot be adjusted)
3. on the two holes of the latch which have NOT been used (i.e. there're no
corre-
sponding holes in the table) go ahead and mark where the screw will mount the
latch and c-a-r-e-f-u-l-l-y start the holes for the screws.
4. after you've given the screws a good start, put the latch back in place;
you can
use double stick, or mounting tape if you want.  with the latch in place,
finish off
 the installation by making sure the screws aren't torqued so tight that they
strip
out the threads in the table.

Lotsa luck...
