     A spark plug insert fits about the same size,  but then you need to 
replace your drain plug. Someone sales the right thread insert, I haven't
been able to find then. There are rubber plugs that work well. I keep
one in the glove box, just in cases. If you use a thread insert put 
high temp. lock-tite on the insert before installing.
