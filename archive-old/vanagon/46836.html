I think that you're on to something here! I'm sure glad that my '87 
doesn't know that it is supposed to have all these cooling problems. 
It has over 125K miles on it and has made several trips to the Pocono 
mountains in PA towing a pop up camper (during the summer, running 
the AC) and the temp gauge only goes a little over half way up.

I bought the van brand new in '87 and the only troubles I have had
with the cooling system is a water pump failure and a fan resistor
failure. I have owned other non-vw cars and believe it or not, things 
break on them too!

Later. . . . . . .Brad
