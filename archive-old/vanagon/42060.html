Here's an odd one...

When the V6anagon was trying to shed its clutch in San Jose, the vibration
got so heavy that the bolt fell out that connects the shift lever to the
shift tube that goes back to the transmission. I heard a loud CLUNK under
the car on the freeway, and a rattle like something was bouncing off the
bottom of the car. Couldn't see anything bouncing along the road in the
rear view mirror.

But when I was nearly at my destination, went to shift again, and the
shift handle fell over like a broken neck. VERY weird feeling. Pushed
the V6anagon into a handy parking lot (Valleyfair for you SJ types),
dived underneath, pulled off the little box that shields the connection,
and found that the lever and tube were no longer on speaking terms.

No problem (compared to the clutch problem) sez I, I'll just head
over to a hardware store and get a bolt to stick in there, as soon
as I get the size of the bolt. Well, guess what-- the holes on either
side of the coupling, are different diameters.

Does VW have a bolt in there, that has one end larger than the other?
Or is it a pin of some kind? I currently have an Ace Hardware special
that I torqued down enough to get me home, but who knows how long it
will last.

VW dealer here says there's a special bolt in there, with a (special?)
nut, and also some bushings from a Rabbit(?). All pretty cheap. Anyone
have this particular bolt, lying around in a parts box? What kind of
pin/bolt/skyhook is supposed to be in there? Why is it special?
