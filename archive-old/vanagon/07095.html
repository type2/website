&gt; A while ago I mentioned a heater that I was thinking of installing. It is

&gt; 
&gt; electrical - 12V
&gt; crystal energy cell
&gt; 300watts/1200BTUs
&gt; 102CFM
&gt; draws 25 amps
&gt; fan and heater
&gt; 
&gt; Q: will this be at all sufficient to add extra heat to the van and is
&gt; 25amps an overwhelming drain on the battery?

It's like having your highbeams, low beams and brake lights on all at the 
same time.  Okay when the engine is running, but don't leavi it on while 
you go shopping.
I installed one of these in a friends old bus.  1200 BTUs isn't very 
noticable unless you're holding your hand right in front of it.
It is however enough to keep a window defrosted.
