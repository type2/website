Howdy Volks,

My '72 Westy, Stimpy, is having problems starting.  When I get in and crank
the starter, it sounds like it or somepart of it is spinning, without
engaging the flywheel.  If I put Stimpy in gear, and rock it forward and
back (just a inch or two), it will then start.  I tested the battery at 
the local FLAPS, but the result only said &quot;charge and re-test.&quot;  I went 
ahead and bought a new battery (the old one was over 5 years old), put it
in when I got home, and the exact same thing happens.  The generator light
doesn't come on when I'm driving, and I don't notice any other electrical
problems.  Any ideas?  I did a cursory examination of the starter/solenoid,
and didn't notice anything out-of-the-ordinary.  The solenoid was replaced
16 months ago, but I suspect a different problem, since the symptoms are
different (Bad solenoid, nothing happens.  This time _something_ is 
happening)

Any help would be greatly appreciated.  I'm assuming I'm may have to
replace the starter, but would rather not have to...

Nate (and Stimpy)
