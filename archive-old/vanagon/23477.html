Subject: /F How not to do restorations

&gt;From a magazine: The Car Collector &amp; Car Classics; October 1995

(hope they don't sue me)

RESTORATION TIP, NOT - Joseph Aaron tried an innovative approach to make 
adaptions to his car at his home in Wesley Chapel Florida.  Aaron needed 
to bore a hole in the exhaust pipe of his car.  Lacking a drill, he tried 
to shoot a hole in it with his pistol.  He was hit in the leg when the 
bullet ricocheted.

BTW this is an intersting magazine.  Lots of ads for car accessories.  
Emphasis seems to be American cars - don't think I've seen an article 
about a single foreign car yet.  Some 'techniques' would apply to VWs.

(Maybe this 'endorsement/review' will keep me from getting sued... ric?)
