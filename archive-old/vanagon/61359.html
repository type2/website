Subject: Replacing the Rear Main Oil Seal
Date: Fri, 13 Jun 1997 10:43:51 -0500

Hi,
I'm about to replace the rear main oil seal on my '89 Vanagon - automatic. 
 I don't relish the thought of dropping the trans, but it's better than the 
alternative...   I have ordered an Oil Seal from Ron (thanks!) however, I 
notice an O-ring that is shown in the Bentley manual (section 13) on the 
page that shows the shim arrangement.  I can't find the part number for 
this O-ring.  Anyone got a clue?

Also, any hints regarding dropping the trans would be great.  Do I need the 
fancy seal installing tool?

TIA,

Bo Kersey
