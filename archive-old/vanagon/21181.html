&gt;&gt; To extend this tanget just one more bit -
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; USAF KC135 tankers used water injection on take-off to boost thurst.  The
&gt;&gt; injected water increases the mass flow of the engine and hence the thrust.
&gt;&gt; One caution, if you are riding in the a/c and don't know about the water
&gt;&gt; injection, it runs out shortly after lift off and the sudden and significant
&gt;&gt; drop in sound would make you think that the engines (all 4) just quit!
&gt;&gt; Harvey

All this reminds me of the guy who strapped a JATO(jet assisted take off) unit
to the top of his car, and then tried to take a curve in the road before the
unit finished its burn cycle.
