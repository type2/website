Subject: Re: Pad over engine &amp; Fire extinguisher



&gt;I was looking for new pad that covers the engine and completes the lower
&gt;bed in my Camper.  Any suggestions?

Try to get a pad from a Diesel where available. They are made of plastic
and not as heavy as the steel ones. I guess they will be reduce the
engine noise better because the  denoiser is glued onto it. I used the
plastic to raise a part of the lid. I will send you part# if required.
