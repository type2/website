My thanks for all the responses to my comments and questions. And I've 
got a few more.

VANAGON STEERING WHEEL HEIGHT  When I began my search for a camper I had 
a close look at the vanagons and thought they were great untill I sat 
behind the wheel. The angle differs greatly from that of the bus. I'm a 
little over six feet tall and that wheel was right in my lap. When I
tried to move my feet from gas to break pedal or over to the clutch pedal 
it was an exercise in frustration. Is there any safe way of adjusting the 
height or angle of the steering wheel? Did VW eliminate this problem on 
the Eurovan by making it adjustable?

OIL LEAKS  I'm told that oil leaks are standard with air-cooled engines. 
My mechanic noted that my 77 Camper is leaking through the main engine 
seal and that it would be a good thing to replace. He said I could drive 
indefinately with it the way it is as long as I kept the oil level up. He 
mentioned that the quality of seals differ a lot and a high performance 
one would be the way to go. Seals are inexpensive but getting them in 
place is not. Anyone care to comment on this?

VW SHOWS  How do I find out if there's a forthcoming VW show in my area? 
I live in the Boulder-Denver area. The last time I heard about one was 
way after the fact.
