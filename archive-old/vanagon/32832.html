Subject: RE: Much mail

This is not a flame, just look at it like this. 

You wouldn't buy a copy of every newspaper every day and complain you didn't
have time to read them all. You wouldn't subscribe to dozens of TV channels
and then complain your eyes were going square. You wouldn't stand too close
to a fire and complain your arse was getting burnt.

If there's too much mail to read, it's simple. JUST DON'T READ IT. 

I like getting a lot of VW mail, why else would I come to work in the
mornings :)
