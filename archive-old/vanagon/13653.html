Subject:       more 'Ghost harness' info

Quoting from a blurb in Import Service:

After driving for an extended period of time at a constant speed, 
some water cooled Vanagon engines may loose performance or hesitate 
and surge.  In many cases, the symptoms will disappear after turning 
off the engine and restarting.  After that, the symptoms may not 
reoccur for several weeks or months.

A new wiring harness (P/N 025 906 302) is available to correct this 
problem.  The new harness provides better signal voltage 
stabilization than the old harness it is designed to replace.

To install the new harness, remove the air flow sensor harness 
connector.  Install the new harness between the main harness 
connector  and the air flow sensor connector.

There are active components in the new wiring harness.  For this 
reason, there is no continuity between terminal number 2 at one
of the harness connectors and terminal 2 in the harness connector at 
the other end of the new harness.  This is normal and should not be 
considered a fault.

All other connector terminals should have 0 ohms resistance from one 
harness connector to its mate in the connector at the other end of 
the harness.  Keep this in mind when troubleshooting this system and 
performing continuity checks.
