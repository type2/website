&lt;&lt; After reading a few stories of car and van theft on the VW USENET
 groups, I'm wondering what people on the list are doing to minimize
 the risk of theft.  I realize that a determined thief will get your
 vehicle, no matter what.  But how to best deter the small time
 hotwire and smash 'n grab variety?  &gt;&gt;

Just remember.....one of the easiest ways to break into a Vanagon is knock
off the 2 little plastic lower tabs on the slider windows, and the thing will
slide right open from the outside....

Ever seen the locks they have on jewelry display cases in dept stores?  The
kind with sliding glass doors?
those locks would prevent someone from getting in if they try to pry out the
little plastic tabs. 

Anyone make these especially for sliding car windows??
