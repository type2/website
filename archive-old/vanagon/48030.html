 Today, after seeing a new puddle under the engine, I started chasing the
 leak.  Turns out that yet another plastic piece (cheaper than metal
 which works) has failed.  Directly above the drive shaft (passenger side)
 is a black plastic &quot;tower&quot; where the left and right hoses connect to
 both the heater hose and the main radiator hose. 
 
 The heater hose connection was &quot;loose&quot; and upon wiggling it, broke off
 in my hand.  It's bloody obvious that a piece of plastic this small
 simply cannot withstand the stress from a length of hose hanging off
 it!   
 
 I urge all of you to carefully check this connection next time you are
 peeking under the car.
 
 *whew*  I feel better now ...

I know it doesn't make much difference, but we should keep complaining to VW.
 This plastic cooling system junk has got to go.  This is a common problem in
all thier vehicles.  They must know this baecause some cooloing system parts
are metal castings in the syncros, but palstic in the normal vans.  Check all
those connections regularly, especially at the heater cores and valves.  I
had that stupid plastic bleed screw for the rear seat heater break on a
number of vehicles.  I always repalce it with steel.
