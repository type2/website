Subject: Stricter emissions laws (was Re: Why there are so many cars etc.)


&gt;It seems that in New Jersey they have implemented a much stricter emissions 
&gt;test;  the kicker is that if you fail the inspection a second time
&gt;your car is essentially condemed!  That means it can not be sold in 
&gt;this state, ever driven again in this state  etc....Just think of the 
&gt;implications,  I may be forced to buy a new Honda or something....
&gt;This law will put a big crimp in my VW lifestyle.  So please help!


Register it in Pennsy.  NJ loses the tax revenue... too bad.
