Subject: RE: Clutch pedal doesn't return?


&gt;I'm looking at a bus, trying to decide if I should buy.  I noticed
&gt;that the clutch pedal doesn't return to its normal position, but rests
&gt;about 1&quot; or 1-1/2&quot; below where it should be.  You can lift it the rest
&gt;of the way up w/ yer toe, but then it falls right back down again.

I had a '69 bus that started doing this. The culprit was a broken
coil spring mounted on the clutch lever of the transmission, on the
outside, where it was fairly easy to get to. Don't recall what a new
one cost, but it couldn't have been that much (knock wood)-- it was just
a bent-up coil of steel wire. I also don't recall whether it was possible
to remove the cable arm from the throwout arm that went into the clutch
housing-- or whether I had to remove the throwout arm itself-- which
might need the engine removed first.

This was on a '69 bus-- anyone know if the '78 he's referring to, has
a similar setup?

As I recall, I drove the bus for a long time with this broken spring
with no ill effects. The spring essentially makes sure there is no
pressure at all on the release bearing and pressure plate once you
let out the clutch. If the spring breaks, then the pedal is sort of
&quot;riding the clutch&quot; a very teeny bit, with maybe a few ounces of
pressure. If it's not enough to make the clutch slip (I don't think
it is), then you should be fine-- replace the spring next time you
pull the engine. Or, if it's not necessary to pull the engine to
replace that spring, then just wait till a warm sunny day when there's
nothing you'd rather do than crawl under your bus and let dirt fall
in your face for 20 minutes or so, and replace it then.  :^)


&gt;P.S.  I live in NJ.  Two weeks ago, I was in Seattle for a few days.
&gt;I don't understand why people complain about &quot;Seattle rustbuckets&quot;.  I
&gt;saw *lots* of buses and vanagons and they all looked to be in very
&gt;good or excellent shape from the outside.  I got a closeup look at a
&gt;'79 w/ sunroof, and it was PRISTINE.  Here on the East Coast, I
&gt;haven't seen a bus that clean in 10 years!  Over Christmas, we took a
&gt;trip NJ -&gt; NC -&gt; NJ, and in 18 hours of driving on I-95, I saw exactly
&gt;3 Vanagons and 1 Bus on the road.  VW Wasteland!  I saw that many in
&gt;each trip from exit 13 to exit 17 on I-90 in Seattle--about 5 miles!
&gt;What are you all out there complaining about???

Who's complaining? We're not the ones who picked the wrong coast.  ;-)
