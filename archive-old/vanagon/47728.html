&gt; does anyone know if there was ever a walk thru dormbile offered on pre 1968 busses??
&gt; 
&gt; On a similar vein does anyone know if walkthru 23 or 21 windows were offered? If they were I see no 
&gt; reason that a walk thru Dorm. could not have been made?

THere was a walk-thru 23 for sale about 2 weeks ago.  $2500, but it
was rusty.
