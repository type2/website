Subject: Re: Elephant Ears

     michael,
     
     &gt;I am attempting to use a pair of authentic Volkswagen &quot;elephant ear&quot; 
     &gt;mirrors for my splitty. Does anybody on this list know the 
     &gt;differences between authentic VW mirrors and aftermarket repros? I 
     &gt;was always under the impression that elephant ear mirrors 
     &gt;manufactured by Volkswagen had &quot;VWOA&quot; stamped on the back of them. 
     &gt;Anybody have anything else to add?
     
     I just fitted some West Coast Metric EE mirros to my splitty last 
     month. They appear just subtly different, ie different screws etc.
     The difference is that the arms are painted black not chromed like the 
     real ones. I saw a place advertising the real ones CHEAPER than the 
     WCM ones after I bought mine though :-(
     
     Lee.
