Subject: RE: Metrinch Wrenches


&gt;Has anybody tried those Metrinch Wrenches they advertise on TV? It's
&gt;supposed to be one set of sockets and wrenches that would fit just about
&gt;any kind of nut/bolt known to man... even rounded off ones. How do they
&gt;fare on our good ol' VW's?

I tried one of those one-size-fits-all wrench things with the swivelling
hex-shaped steel loop on the end (not the Metrinch ones you're talking
about, sorry). One good pull, and SNAP.

I'll stick to Craftsman.
