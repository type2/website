Subject: 1988 Syncros?

VanListies,

I am curious to find out if anyone has a definitive answer as to whether or
not VW sold Vanagon Syncros in the United States for model year 1988.  

The '88 brochure has no reference at all to the Syncro, but a couple of VW
publications seem to hint that there may have been some 1988 Syncros.  In an
issue of the Weathervane (VW's dealer employee newspaper) a Vanagon is
described as being a 1988 Vanagon Syncro.  Also, the 1988 Owner's manual
shows all kinds of stuff specific to Syncros.

My speculation is that the Weathervane was in error and the Syncro stuff in
the Owner's Manual was for Canadian Syncro models.  Does anyone out there
have a U.S. model 1988 Vanagon Syncro or any other definitive means of
answering this question?
