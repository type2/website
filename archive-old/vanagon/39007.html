And Poor Richard thus responded to Richard Golen (RICHARD????!):

&gt;so whether or not it is reflecting light or not doesn't matter to them. As
to
&gt;the fact that most (NOT all) country stickers are white, I am well aware of
&gt;that. Most country stickers don't have that country's e-mail address on them
&gt;either.
&gt;:)
&gt;My purpose was not to create an imitation country sticker, so that people
would
&gt;say &quot;Duh, what country is VW???&quot; but rather to use that concept as a
starting
&gt;point for the design. Anyway, yes I am a bit defensive and taking it way too
&gt;personally I'm sure, but hey, you know how those crazy bus drivers are...
&gt;:)

OK, well I'm no fan of the 'Dead by any stretch of the imagination, but what
say
we make the next list sticker something along the lines of the list address
over
(or around) the facial likeness of Jerry Garcia?
