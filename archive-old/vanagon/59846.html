Subject: Re[2]: Outrageous oil change prices

     Reminds me of the time I had an All Tune and Lube do an oil change for 
     me.  
     
     The technician lowered the rack with the 5 foot tall oil drain pan 
     still under the front end.  I was watching through the fish bowl the 
     whole time when the guy had my car's front end 5 feet off the ground 
     and the rear tires on the ground.  Looked like herbie the love bug 
     poppin' a wheelie.  I thought the thing would be crushed but it held 
     the car until the idiot realized what he was doing.
     
     I couldn't even speak.  It was like an out of body experience.
     
     Sodomy, I tell you, even for $17.95.
     
     'Greg

Reminds me about the time I had KMart change my oil.  Came off the rack 
with the oil light on.  Put it back on the rack.  I watched them change 
the oil again.  Light still on, but the guy said he could feel the oil 
circulating thru the oil filter.  Must be the sensor, they said.  I got 
a mile down the road before it froze up.
