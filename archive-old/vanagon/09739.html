Subject: Re: Idle and Timing

&gt; I can turn the air screw all the way out but the idle only
&gt;increases to a point, approximately 900 rpm and will not go any higher.
This is
&gt;with the idle stabilizer disconnected.

Mike, my '85 is the same way.  I couldn't get it too run any faster than 950
or 1000 RPM if I wanted to.  No rough idle problems though but it seems like
something must be wrong.  Letting out the idle adjustmetn screw that far
makes it appear like there is a vacuum leak
