I second Joel's confirmation that things like this really do occasionally
happen. Of course I've heard the story of the older mother that sells the
$50. Chevrolet that belonged to the son that got killed in Vietnam or the
husband that died and left the 2 door Chevy etc. etc but these things do
happen. I would be the first to admit some silly things are propogated on
the list for the sake of stirring up the list's faithfuls but the '92 story
posted on Saturday was a true deal. I was the one that inserted the term
&quot;van&quot; because that is what the ad had listed. I don't understand why it
would be weird to think that '92 'vans' didn't exist in the USA. Did I miss
something similar to Chevrolet no producing a Corvette in 1983 due to the
retooling for the then newer styling/model design? Or is it that we are
being picky nad some what snobish regarding the proper terminology between
'vans',splitties,bays,vanagons,eurovans,sychros,etc.?
Dismissing the faint possibillity of these occurences, to me, reduces the
odds for those of us that continue to search them out. 
*Example 1* 
Another friend of mine followed up on an ad for a  that I had ignored.
Looked for nearly a year for a '65-67 Westy. Couldn't find any for sale
during this time period. My wife and I located one that we thought would be
a good starter. We soon found out that it wasn't so we blew it out. Then we
bought the bus that ended up being the '67 Westy resto from Hell for $1600
because it was far more complete outside of no motor. We were rather
'searched out' and tired of the exasperating buy/sell mode and adopted a
&quot;can't look at them all mood.&quot; Immediately on cue I see an ad in the paper
for 'vw camper' $600. I dutifully ignore it and get a call form another
friend that had followe dup on the ad and bought it form the original owner
complete with cot, running driving for $400.
He's been driving it since. I have yet to come close to driving mine.
*Example 2*
My recent story about the two early 1960's Mercedes &quot;23 window&quot; style buses.
I didn't want to deal with them and my friend got them (plus tons of related
literature) for free. &quot;Get them off of my lot, please&quot;
