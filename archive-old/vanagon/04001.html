Back in early August R-134 conversion kits were being discussed.  At that
time I mailed the following letter to VW:

Dear Sir/Ma'am,

I am the proud owner of a '84 Vanagon and a '85 Golf.  I purchased the Golf
new in April of '85 and just recently acquired the Vanagon.  I thoroughly
enjoy the experience of driving my VWs and currently have no plans to get
rid of them, which brings me to my problem.  The air conditioning systems 
have stopped functioning in both vehicles.  The old a/c systems are based
on the soon to be obsolete and very expensive R-12 freon.  I am in the pro-
cess of planning and budgeting for the repair of the a/c systems and would
like to know about any R-134 conversion kits available for my two VWs.  It
would make my day to find out that VW already has or is planning to offer
conversion kits for their older vehicles.  If VW is not planning to offer
such a kit, I would like to know of any third party product that has VW's 
blessing for making the conversion possible.


Fahrvergnugenly yours,

Dear Mr. Huff

Thank you for your letter of August 8, 1994 concerning the R-134 conversion
kits.  I am pleased to inform you that our engineers are working on such a
project, however, Volkswagen has nothing currently on the market.

Our parts department is not aware of any third party product to advise.  We
will continue our development efforts and advise the public as soon as one is
available.  Thank you for your interest.


Sincerely,

Sally D. Eberle
Volkswagen Customer Relations

Sure would have been nice if they would have mentioned a time frame for
their conversion kits.  I would like to get the ac fixed in at least the 
Golf next spring since that is the wife's transportation, but I would really
like to hold out for a R-134 system.
