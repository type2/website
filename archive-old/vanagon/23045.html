Subject: CV Joints??
Date: Fri, 18 Aug 1995 16:09:36 -0600 (MDT)

Has anyone ever put a CV joint back together and had it just plain not 
work? I know how to do it, okay? I've done them before, I have RTFM until 
I'm blind -- the other ones went fine -- I didn't mix up the parts from 
one to the other -- I did it and re-did it a couple of dozen times, 
rechecked and rechecked to make sure I didn't have anything backwards, 
and didn't even have to force the outer ring into place -- it goes 
together quite easily, and the narrow grooves and wide grooves are lined 
up correctly, etc. But once together, the only thing that will move is 
the ball cage. I can take it apart, put it back together very easily, but 
it won't move. The only thing I can figure is that possibly something was 
deformed or worn out of shape, and I don't have the exact same balls in 
the exact  groove they were in before?? Weird, weird weird!
