Subject: Stereo FAQ

Hi Folks,

I posted about my &quot;budget&quot; stereo setup in my Vanagon on monday and 
many of you requested details.  There were so many requests that I 
decided to write up a Budget Stereo FAQ for Vanagons.  For those of 
you who would like to receive it, please let me know.  It is fairly 
long and I've done it on Microsoft Write that comes w/ Windows as a 
txt file so I don't want to waste everybody's time by posting it 
here..  This is so most of you can read it with no trouble.  I'll 
send it as a file attachment to you.

I'd also like to receive suggestions and ideas from anyone out there 
who has something to contribute.  I'll add these to it and put it on 
my webpage when I have that up in 2 or 3 weeks.

Cheers,

Greg
