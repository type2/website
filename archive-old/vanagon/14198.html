Subject: Re: Flue cover

Please reserve 2 of them for me.  Thanks Steve, Bruce

&gt;Okay folks,
&gt;
&gt;Just for your info.  The AAA RV store that Al spoke of does not
&gt;normally carry the flue in stock, so I'm ordering 25 of them.
&gt;I plan to keep 5 of them.  5 have been spoken for.  So that
&gt;will leave 15 that I can sale at cost plus postage if necessary.
&gt;So it will be first requested first served.  But as of now I
&gt;will need you to send the money up front and I will then send
&gt;the flue.  The cost of postage will depend on where you're from.
&gt;I would add $2.00 for postage to the $5.00 for the flue and
&gt;that should do it.  Any extra will be sent back with the flue.
&gt;If you're really desperate and I run out, I'll order more, but
&gt;I'd like to work up a list first before I commit to more okay?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks
&gt;
&gt;Steven
