Subject: Re: HELP advise on purchase of '70 camper

i have seen buses get to the point that the sliding door will actually fall
right off, because the rocker is so rusty! So when you open the door make
sure that your feet are not underneath! I don't know how difficult it is to
replace that section of metal. My guess is that it takes a bit of work to
get the metal welded up and have the door slide properly. Other areas that
are typical for bay window busses to rust are

- behind front wheels (on the inside of the wheel well)
-at the bottom of the sliding door
-the battery tray
-at the bottom of the windshield

michael&gt;O.K. this is my first chance at moving up from the Wannabus list and
&gt;I would appreciate some pointers and suggestions.
&gt;
&gt;I left a message on an answering machine of a house that has and old
&gt;camper resting away in his back yard.  He called me back last night
&gt;and told me it is a '71junker he hauled home for parts to fix up his
&gt;'70 that he says is in &quot;decent&quot; shape, and yes he would part with the
&gt;two of them.  I am going to look at them tomorrow morning and really
&gt;have a couple questions that I need help with.  He says the '70 has
&gt;&quot;some&quot; rust, the battery compartment is bad, and the sliding door he
&gt;says has a problem.  He describes it as there is an area on the
&gt;bottom track where water has a hard time getting out and it needs
&gt;fixed because the door will jump out there if you aren't carefull.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Also he describes a rubber drive bushing by the steering box that is
&gt;bad and needs replaced ??
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I know the battery compartment goes, but is the door rail one of the
&gt;soft spots that goes first or can I expect lots of rust ?
&gt;
&gt;What parts from a '71 would be usable on a '70 ?
&gt;
&gt;He says it runs good, swears it has only 36K miles on it, canvas top
&gt;is good, has an ice box, sink, and stove, also has an extra more
&gt;powerfull engine in his basement that would go, and the '71 would go
&gt;with it for $1000.00
&gt;
&gt;Please advise if you can, and other high dollar repair things I
&gt;should look for.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Thank you,
