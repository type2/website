 Dennis has suggested that I could get a doughnut that is flat with a 
 guide ring on one side.  You suggest that I use a triangular gasket since 
 I have the original collector pipe.  So, how can I tell if the Cat. 
 converter I'm looking at will accept either the gasket or doughnut?  It 
 has been mentioned that the Walker converter will take either.  Are there 
 after market converters that will only accept the doughnut, or is the 
 collector pipe the determining factor?  Thanks for setting me 
 straight.....I don't know where else I'd get this information.

The cat will have a chamfer in the inlet opening if it can accept the donut.
 No chamfer, need gasket.
