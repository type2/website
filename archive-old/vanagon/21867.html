HELP!!!

After the trip from hell this weekend (Houston to Tulsa) in 
our 84 Westie, the A/C compressor gave up the ghost.  The 
clutch seized, over- heated and blew the seals out of the 
compressor.  The local A/C rebuilders want $225 for a rebuilt 
and some of the major distributors want $250 for a new 
compressor.

Here's my delima.  This seems like a lot of money to invest in 
to a A/C system that is doomed to obselence at the end of this 
year (as you know, the manufacture of R-12 will end at this 
year).

So, does anyone know of a cheap supplier of rebuilt compressors 
(~$120) or any tips on converting to a R-134a system?  The 
compressor in mine is a Sandon Industries SD-508.

Please respond by private email, as I am a &quot;digester&quot;...

P.S. - Don't bother trying to find a aftermarket gas cap for 
these besties...  Aftering visiting 5 places on the way out of 
Houston, ended up driving to Dallas with a rag shoved in the 
filler tube and going to 2 VW dealers and paying $35 for one.  
:-(  On the up side, the gas mileage increased by %15.  Guess 
the old cap wasn't working too well.  So, if the person who 
stole my gas cap is a subscriber, you should go buy a new one!
