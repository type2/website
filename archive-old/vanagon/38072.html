&gt; option is to bolt it in with the #3 sparkplug. I feel bad about
&gt; contradicting David Schwarze, but it's feasible: you only need to bend a
&gt; right angle into the VDO CHT sensor. 

Been there, done that.  Still didn't fit - not enough clearance.  But it
it works for you, great!  I don't know what's different on your engine,
but something has to be, cause there is NO WAY that sucker would fit
under _my_ spark plug.  :)
 
&gt; The CHT gauge kit is, like, &quot;self-powered.&quot; :-) The heat will generate
&gt; tiny amounts of current in the sensor (forgot the term for this
&gt; phenomenon)

I believe it's &quot;thermocouple&quot;.
