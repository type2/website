&gt;A couple of weeks [maybe three?] ago I posted the suggestion [and
&gt;volunteered to organise] of a touring the Maritime provinces plus
&gt;Newfoundland and Labrador next summer.  The message was also a straw
&gt;poll to see how much, if any interest, there was for this idea on the
&gt;two lists.

[...]

&gt;	- Many wanted to keep the daily driving down [in comparison to
&gt;	the regime of the Inuvik trip] so that we can &quot;stop and smell
&gt;	more flowers&quot; along the way. 

Christa and Tobin had the same goal for the Inuvik trip.  Unfortunately, the
distances to cover were great, and there were time constraints.

My preference (when I do this again) would be to spend more time near
interesting towns.  I enjoy meeting people, and on this trip the only folks
I got to know well were those travelling.

Next time I go to Inuvik, I'll stay a week, minimum.
