&gt; Question #2:
&gt; I am paranoid about the dropped valve seat problem.  How prevalent is it?
&gt; What is the experience out there with rebuilt heads?  Do I have 'em rebuilt
&gt; locally by any shop that says they do VW heads?  (Does anybody have experience
&gt; with any shops in the Sacramento, CA area?)  Or should I send them down to
&gt; Mark Stephens because he guarantees &quot;No More Dropped Seats&quot; and pay the
&gt; shipping charges AND much higher prices (twice as much)?

Here's the bill from my local shop. Original quote was $89 a head. They
didn't have rebuildable 1800 heads in stock and made me wait a couple of
weeks until they finally suggested I use 2 liter heads instead. Since I
don't race my bus too much, I agreed to go with that, even though 2 liter
heads have smaller valves.

HEADS
Rebuild 2.0 heads                        89.00 X 2 = $178.00
Exhaust studs repair                     12.00 x 2 = $ 24.00
New intake valves (4) &lt;because I asked for them!&gt;
flycut (1 pair)                          29.00 x 1 = $ 29.00
weld to seat		                 20.00 x 2 = $ 40.00
seats (2)    		                 11.95 x 1 = $ 11.95
bad core (1) &lt;really just a tiny crack&gt;  75.00 x 1 = $ 75.00   
						   ----------
(total)                                              $357.95

I estimate that Mark Stephens would have charged me $169 x 2 + $35 = $373.
The $35 would have been for welding up the cracked head, a job the local
guy apparently lacks the skill for. Add shipping to that (maybe $30
round-trip?).

Next time, Stephens gets my business.
