&gt;7. Keep your wiper fluid full (you'll need lots of it) and refill the gas
&gt;   tank when it's half empty. Keep a first-aid kit, jumper cables, and 

Hold off on filling up your wiper fluid.  The stuff we buy down here in
the south is NOT the same stuff they use in the north.  My parents
recently went from Texas to Michigan and had their wiper fluid freeze
solid.  After it warmed enough during the day to melt it, my dad added
the northern stuff which helped.  At least it didn't freeze until it was
around 22 or so.  But that was because it was being cut with the
southern stuff that was still in there.

Upon returning home, give your van a GOOD bath.  The salt they put on
the roads wreaks havoc on the body and paint jobs.  Don't forget to get
around the wheels especially good.

Have fun!
