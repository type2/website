Subject: ? Oil Drain Plug removal

I thought even a mechanical idiot like myself could take over Tug's frequent
oil changes, but got stonewalled by the frozen drain plug.  The corners were
rounded before I began.  I used a 13 mm socket &amp; some WD-40 (hah!), but sone
realized I was getting nowhere fast.  I'm now told if an air wrench won't jar
it loose, it may need to be drilled out.  All I can see is big $ if I can't
keep it from locking again.  I've checked LiMBO's articles &amp; the archives,
but didn't find removal info.  Can I buy a denser metal plug made for my '90
sycro Westy?  Also, opinions re Bar's Leaks in coolant- waste of $?  Despite
the proper type, mixture &amp; replacements, at 103,000 mi. both sides have
drips...  Counsel, please.  TIA!
