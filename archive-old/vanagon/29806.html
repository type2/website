Subject: Re: Sears Trailhandler A-T tires

BTW, I have one Trailhandler Radial LT, size LT195 75 14 that I'll donate
if anyone needs it. It's unused (or virtually unused)--it was the spare.
Contact me directly if interested.

&gt;&gt;&gt; transformed the Bus, steering light and responsive (as much as it could
&gt;&gt;&gt; be) no sway, no buffeting by semis, rock solid.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I did not get a reduction in my swaying, buffeting, blowing or wandering
&gt;&gt;after putting Trailhandlers on my '89 Westy. I'll recheck the pressure
&gt;&gt;though, since it could be off a tad.
&gt;
&gt;I was happy after putting a set of these on the rear, they worked well, and
&gt;I have hauled almost 2000 lb inside when using them.  Try the pressure at
&gt;38-42psi, was good for daily driving.  Maybe a ball joint is getting wobbly?
&gt; Found this out on my '87 after ditching the 4 plys and putting on 8 plys.
&gt;Handling feel 'sharpened up' to where I could detect upper ball joint slop
&gt;over much reduced tire squirm.
