&lt;&lt; I just got a new primary battery installed.  A Sears Diehard
 International.  The battery has a vent, but Sears didn't connect it
 to anything, and it's not apparant to me where it would connect.

 Where is the external vent connection for the primary battery?
 Is it bad to leave the battery venting into the battery
 compartment?  &gt;&gt;

Neither of my Vanagons have any provision for venting.  I've seen Westies
that have a vent tube leading from the battery comaartment to the outside,
but have never seen a passenger model with this arrangement.
