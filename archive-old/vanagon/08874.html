&gt; 

I have a Yakima rack on my '78 Westfalia on which I have loaded       
several kayaks and other gear 
plus myself walking around loading things on top of the poptop with no 
problem.  I would guesstimate a 400 pound load. I've even popped the top 
with kayaks on top by standing on the luggage rack and lifting the bow of 
a boat while my wife pushes on the bar from inside the car. Makes the 
bus look like a rocket launcher but so far the hinges and top give no 
sign of significant strain.

Enjoy!
