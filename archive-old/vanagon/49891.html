Subject: Front Seats for EV


Hello everyone,

During my search for Vanagon seats I got a nice leaflet from
Grammar including drawings of their seats. I like to forward
the Grammar description of the EV-seat:

 ------------
For heavy utility vehicles, comfortable operator seats designed
to maintain the health of the driver even during a long work
day have been standard equipment for years. Not so for light
utility vehicles. Due to the lack of air supply for a vehicle,
the best that could be done until now was built-in mechanical
suspension. Apart from the seat cushions, most light utility
vehicles have no additional suspension elements available to
them. Field measurements have determined that rigid seats work
counter to even relatively good vehicle suspension.

Grammar's operator seat MSG 90.3 C with pneumatic suspension
and its own air supply is independent of the vehicle. The
MSG 90.3 C automatically adjusts to the weight of the user with
the push of a button. In this way the suspension can be varied
from hard to soft.

A pneumatic lumbar support, infinitely adjustable in both height
and depth, protects the spinal column. The depth and inclination
of the seat can be adjusted independent of each other. The
result is the optimum seating position. Controls are ergonomically
placed as easy to reach without changing the position of the
seat.

With the MSG 90.3 C, Grammar now offers a seat designed to
protect the comfort and health of light utility vehicle drivers,
just as we have done for many years for heavy equipment operators.
