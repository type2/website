Subject: Westfalia for Sale



hey now,

saw a van in raleigh for sale...it's a westfalia, classic orange...'76 FI
very nice looking. floor is solid, interior is immaculate. didn't do a 100%
inspection but i didn't see ANY body rust...took a quick peek 
underneath..very clean. engine looked good..heard it run..very smooth. 
has 140,000 some miles. didn't check out the pop top. owner said the po 
was an old dude...he has all the service records. asking $2500. haven't 
seen such a clean looking van in awhile. if interested, email me and i'll 
send you his number. he said he had just bought an '89 and needs to seel 
this one. it looks great....i'm not connected with this van at all.

ps. if i had the cash i'd prolly buy it after a complete inspection. *sigh*
