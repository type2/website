&gt;Quoting from today's AP newswire:

&gt;+-----
&gt; But Tuesday, only seconds after he took off from Watsonville
&gt;Airport, something went wrong. The engine seized up, white smoke poured out
&gt;and the propeller stopped. The pilot tried desperately to loop back to the
&gt;runway but lost altitude too quickly. The little two-seater crashed through
&gt;a picket fence, slid down a hill and flipped over, smashing into the back
&gt;of Inez Tucker's barn and bursting into a ball of flame...

&gt;Imagine, working 18 years on this project only to have the engine seize on
&gt;the first trial run. What a sad tale. Wonder what happened...

He probably took the thermostat/cooling tin off of the engine. RIP
