&gt; I was in line at an idle at the outside bank teller window for too long
&gt; today and I heard this loud fan come on.  I looked at my temperature gauge
&gt; and it was up a little bit over where it usually is but not up to the line
&gt; that I guess indicates that &quot;you in deep doo-doo now&quot;.  Anyway, the fan
&gt; came on for about 10 seconds or so then shut off and did this again about 2
&gt; minutes apart about 3 more times.  I left there and drove about 1/2 mile to
&gt; a store, spent about 10 minutes in the store and when I came out the was a
&gt; pretty steady stream of antifreeze  coming out of my engine area.  I opened
&gt; the license plate hatch and checked the bottle and couldn't make out where
&gt; the level was so I opened it.  The antifreeze was almost up to the top of
&gt; the bottle (or tank).  After waiting a minute or so, the leaking stopped
&gt; and the level in the bottle went back down to the line where it should be.
&gt; I drove home from there (about 4 miles) and watched the gauge all the way.
&gt; It was in the normal area and the van ran fine.  Do I need to worry about
&gt; this? 

Nope.

 Does this fan just come on when the engine is overheating? 

Yes, I live in Texas, and I only here it on hot days stuck in traffic.

 How do
&gt; you keep from loosing the coolant?

Don't put so much in.

 Why have I never heard this fan
&gt; before????

You are a Yankee!

&gt; Thanks for wisdom in advance
