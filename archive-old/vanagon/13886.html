Subject: Re: Tool Sticker Shock

&gt;I am down to the last couple of things for my toolbox.  I decided to 
&gt;buy 3/4&quot; drive sockets and breaker bar for the big stuff.  I don't 
&gt;plan on being anywhere near a Sears store with my bus much of time so 
&gt;this is my piece of mind.  Sears does not sell 6 point sockets for 
&gt;these big sizes.  They do sell 12 point.  I just got off the phone 
&gt;with Snap-On customer direct order line and this is what I heard.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;     			Sears 12 point		Snap-On 6 point
&gt;
&gt;30mm or 1 3/16&quot;		$8.99			$22.90
&gt;
&gt;36mm or 1 7/16&quot;		$10.99			$27.99
&gt;
&gt;42mm or 1 11/16&quot;	$13.99			$37.50
&gt;
&gt;The Snap-On sockets are air-impact, industrial finish.  That is all 
&gt;they offer in those sizes.  They might be worth the money and I might 
&gt;just buy them one at a time as I need them but I was wondering if 
&gt;there are alternatives.  My brother works at a shop so he might get 
&gt;them cheaper than that, but I doubt it will save much.  Any other 
&gt;ideas?  Thanks, Jim

My local CT Farm &amp; Country store carries individual 6 point impact sockets.  
In metric even!  They are about midway between your figures.  All with a 
lifetime gaurentee(sp?).
