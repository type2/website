Subject: Shift kit Vanagon

What can I say? This list is a huge resource... I had in mind about a 
Gene Berg shift kit to a vanagon. Browsing through the archives, I found 
some good hints of mounting. At Vanagon_dot_com at vendors is the adress to 
Gene Berg. Perfect! One thing thou, is this kit aviable in Europe?
