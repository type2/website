Subject:      Where are you when you write?

To all Vanagoners:

I would like to make a suggestion.

When you write into the list, it would be nice to know approximately
where you are writing from.  Sometimes it is about something for sale,
or a problem where the regional location may have an impact (cold starts
in Alaska and Florida may have slightly different climatic influences!)
and it is almost impossible to decode the e-mail address to tell where
the heck you are.

Perhaps as part of your signature, you could indicate your location.
Even the state/province or even country would be an improvement.  I
don't think this will violate your personal security, and will make the
list easier to use.
