Subject:      forget the disk brakes?



Well, after a couple of the responses I received concerning putting the disc
brakes from my 71 on a 69 camper it sounds like more of a job than I want to
deal with. Still haven't decided though. If I keep the drum brakes aren't
there shoes that help the drum brakes work better? I noticed in the Sept. Hot
VWs the mention in the &quot;Parts Bin&quot; they mention &quot;lined brake shoes&quot; for off
road use. Anything that could help improve drum brakes and save my aching
back?
