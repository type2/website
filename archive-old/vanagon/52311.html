Subject: Re: '97 T4 Campers

This is a comment also on Richard Palmer's &quot;VWoA website fun&quot; posting
of nov.21.96:

I hate to say it, but the VWoA Web posting is a disappointment to an 
Internet browser and veteran VW camper owner.  

You'd think that VWoA, or some Web-smart dealer, would have rushed 
a picture of the new 1997 EuroVan Camper for prospective buyers
to see;  in reality the graphics and model specs posted on 
http://www.vw_dot_com/welcome.htm belong to the 1995 model.  

I took a quick peek at a 97 VR6 here in Seattle late Oct.:  it has 
somewhat sexier white bumpers and rear view mirrors, better mid-seat 
floor attachments, and of course the 6 cyl engine and higher price. 
Still the same Norcold refrigerator.

Also sitting in the lot were two used 95 Eurovan campers with some 
20K miles each!  Makes me wonder why anybody would want to sell so soon?

Finally, a side note on the marketing power of VW camper names, 
or why &quot;grass is greener on the other side&quot;: while on this side of 
the Atlantic we get to drool over EUROVAN CAMPERS, them German folks 
are sold CALIFORNIAVANS!

	Just got back from Bob Lewis VW in San Jose. They didn't
have a T4 camper, had just sold the last one, expected more this
week. Its got the VR6 and a 4 speed automatic. Asking price is $36K

They also have a '95 with 7K miles on it and its got a 5 speed- $29K. 

These are Winebago conversion but not the bloated thing built on
a single-cab chassis. I got a brochure. The fine print at the bottom 
of the brochure states:

Call 1-800 DRIVE VW or http://www.vw_dot_com (C) 1996 ......
