Subject: Re: backfire!

OK, OK sorry to be so much of a smart alec. I called my professional guru
garage and described the scenario. the first thing he said was &quot;exhaust
leak&quot;. we already know that much. When asked if it could have anything to do
with the INTAKE gaskets he confirmed that the engines would run like heck
and wouldnt idle worth beans. The suggestion (as a confimation to what has
already been discussed) was to replace the EXHAUST gasket(s) with new every
time an associated exhaust component is removed. i.e. replace all gaskets if
both J tubes or heater boxes are removed. Make sure that the size of the
female end of the exhaust muffler is of similar size to the male end of the
heater box or J tube. The guru also said that a bad condensor could cause
performancce problems but mainly in the acceleration end rather than in the
deacceleration curve. The guru said that a tight valve &quot;might&quot; be a cause
but is doubtful.
I personnally have had a tough time keeping the clamps tight on the single
cab. Driving over bumps, rough roads, potholes,and general vibration will
loosen them faster than you can say &quot;backfire&quot;. Its maddening!
I have also heard of folks adapting the male\female\clamp area to a
flange&amp;bolt set-up similar to the typical early domestic headers. I haven't
resorted to this yet but it sure is tempting.

Sorry again about the smart alec response but the donut sucking muffler
sounded a bit unusual. Silly Me...
