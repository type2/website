So Martha Rubin says:
&gt; and that surrpetitiously.
&gt; 
&gt; it took 24 hours to freeze and cure is no fault of Bill's  :).  Steve Johnson 
&gt; proved beyond a doubt to all of us that he could make deviled eggs without 
&gt; Linda, although I still think we REALLY need her on these events to bring along 
&gt; everything everyone else always forgets and to keep us calm.

Well, credit where credits due.  Linda did boil and peel the eggs which was
a definite pain according to her.  On the same day that our drain pipes 
decided to back up! :(  She hung in there though and got many things ready
for me while I was at work.  What a woman!  :)

&gt; wanted to see what happened when magnesium burned.  With the aid of a multitude 
&gt; of spirits and various substances, plus some special glacier glasses which 
&gt; block out 90 percent of glare, this was one awesome fire!  Typical of the IQ we 
&gt; were beginning to recognize in Calif. park personnel, the ranger wanted to know 
&gt; what magnesium was, IF this fire was outside the pit (do they let blind rangers 
&gt; drive??), and if the fire was hot.  DUH.  She also wanted to know whose 
&gt; campsite this was, and of course we all immediately pointed to Steve, who had 
&gt; only arrived just about 30 minutes before.  She informed S. that this fire 
&gt; could constitute a $750 fine, but hey, Steve, wasn't it worth it?!?  I mean, 
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
&gt; the flames, the drama, the heat, the massiveness of the whole experience!?

Ummm... I'd like a site away from the central one next time, thank you. :)

&gt; wonderfully resilient and strong they were.  Anyway, after Steve took some of 
&gt; it home to Linda  - what a guy.  a

She said it was good except for the extra lemon which I actually liked! :)

Ditto for Kudo's to Al and Jeff for their excellent breakfast efforts!
