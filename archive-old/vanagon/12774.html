&gt;On the news a couple of weeks ago, about the woman who threw her kids
&gt;off the Long Beach bridge (and then herself) there was a white bay-window
&gt;parked, doors open, at an angle on the bridge.

I saw that too.  I hypothesize that it belonged to the surfer who threw 
his board down (50') and jumped in to save them
