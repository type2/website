Hmmm??  I try to keep track of this stuff and I don't recall seeing anywhere
mention of an '89 Wolfsburg Westfalia.  You do mention that the emblems are
on the front doors, while all Vanagon Wolfsburgs I've seen have the emblem
just in front of each door.  My guess is that the P.O. bought and applied the
emblems and not wanting to cover them up with a bra, placed them on the doors
where all his adoring fans could see that he had the only '89 Wolfsburg
Westfalia in existance.

If the emblems are really in the correct position, I would really like to
hear if someone can verify the existance of an '89 Wolfsburg Westfalia.
