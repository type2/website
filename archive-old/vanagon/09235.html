&gt; that will line up the release slots and you can pull the bulb holder out and
&gt; replace the bulb. then reinsert it and turn 90 degrees again. once you see
&gt; how it works, it sorta makes sense. ;)

Warning. Do this VERY carefully.  The foil is easily damaged and is a 
$100+ part.  Furthermore, the bulbs tend to be at the end of the foil 
where it's weakest.  Also, just for reference, my plastic cover comes off 
without removing the brake sensor wire.  It just lifts right off.
