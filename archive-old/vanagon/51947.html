Subject: Light Covers for EV

When I needed headlight covers for my eurovan, and no covers made for it 
I took covers from Audi 100 84-91. They are a reasonable fit as they 
are, but with a little trimmimg in the corners it looks like they are 
custom made. Dont try to mount the little self adhesives brackets if the 
headlight lens are cold, they will not stick. Also be sure to de-grease 
the lenses before mounting. 
One of my fog light lenses cracked today, when i was blasting trough 
deep water. They are really pricy $$$$... I would say about 180-200$ 
each side.
I should try to get some covers for them too.
