Yup.  Whenever the engine shows the least bit of stumble or rough 
running, that's the first step in my troubleshooting technique.  I try 
and have it on hand _before_ I need it though.  I bought a couple of 
shrink wrapped two-packs from Checker awhile back.  I think the pair was 
$4.  Don't know if they still have any left but it's worth checking ;).
