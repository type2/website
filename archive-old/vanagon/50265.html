Subject: CCC's this weekend!


Just a reminder - our gathering is this Saturday evening, at Pelican
Inn on Muir Beach, west of San Rafael.  Starts at 6.  Bring darts
if you play, and an appetite/thirst for British pub fare.  Hope to
see you all there!  Place closes at 11 p.m., so don't come too late.  :)

 Current lust list: DC/12v coffee-grinder &amp; blender, a Eurovan TDI transporter,
  black currant juice, a moped, hot showers and a faucet top for my '81 westy,
   and last but not least:  a pair of those old-fashioned metal roller-skates,
    made, I think, by Winchester (but any would do) - the kind which fasten
     onto the outside of your shoes and are length- and width-adjustable
      with a metal key.  They have leather straps for the ankle.  They were
       very popular in the 60's.
