Subject: Spam and a question

Larry confessed to actually liking MRE's (one has to question his mental
state) and said:

&gt;The M-113A2 Armored Personel Carrier has a diesal heater inside that
&gt;heats up a meal in minutes.

Actually the heaters run on gasoline, as to the engines of those death
traps.  The fuel cell is fiberglass, attached to a relatively unarmored
portion of the side wall(not that APC's are that armored 1/2&quot; thick
aluminum). Actually they had a really cool air conditioning type setup
for the driver, and crew chief. If you remove the engine panels on the
inside, there is enough air drawn into the engine compartment to move
quite a bit of air through the two small hatches to keep you cool in 120
degree days.

Now for some ObVW:

Nobody responded to my earlier message about the lower torsion arm
stops, and whether they can be moved(should I take this as a hint). I
want to rais the rear of my Thing, and I do not want the torsion arms to
be banging on the lower stops all the time. Can they be moved relatively
easily?

Thanks,

David
