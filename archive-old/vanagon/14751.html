Subject: Re: Ball Joints/SOLD

Hi Peter;

I have sent the ball joints via Canada Post, same week delivery. UPS forgot 
to tell me that they would accept cash, only COD at your end for an 
additional $6, or 'on account'. Purolater takes all coin of the realm, incl. 
VISA, but wanted $15 for their service. Hence Canada Post, sent today, 
Apr3rd. to arrive thid Friday. I threw in a set of O-rings for your pushrod 
tubes, for those free days when you want to crawl under your van and get 
totally filthy.  tim s.

got you cheque, $105, last Fri. thanks!
