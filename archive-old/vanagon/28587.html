If you want to surf you need to know how to swim.  Not in the intellectual
sense, you have to enjoy swimming; you have to be pretty good at it.  There
are a few guys who break this rule but they only serve to prove its
importance; they're lousy surfers, never truly at home in the water.

If you want to maintain your Volkswagen you have to know how to drop drop the
engine.  The Volkswagen was designed around modular components.  The engine
mounts to the tranny with four bolts, as does the front axle assembly.  The
rear axles and tranny mounts to the chassis with twelve bolts.  Professor
Porsche envisioned a vehicle in which the major wear components could be
easily replaced as complete assemblies.  This permitted quick maintenance and
fostered specialized overhaul and repair centers for rebuilding engines,
transmissions and front axle assemblies.

That principle remains valid even though Volkswagen has abandoned such repair
centers.  Indeed, all of the principle's of Ferdinand Porsche have been
largely abandoned by Volkswagen AG.  Today they are just another motor car
company.  But the wisdom and genius of Professor Porsche are forever embodied
in the early VW sedan and Transporter, and in their underlying simplicity, a
key feature of which is easy removal of the engine and running components.

Some months ago I described how to remove your engine, hoping to show that
it's really a simple operation.  Yet I continue to hear people speak of
dropping an engine in terms best used for running a four minute mile or
digging the Panama Canal... with a teaspoon.  The fact is, the early-model
Volkswagen engine probably weighs less than you do, it is one of the lightest
automotive engines ever designed, it was designed to be easily removed and
replaced. 

If you own an early Volkswagen, dropping the engine from time to time is part
of the natural order of things.  You must drop the engine to replace the
clutch, a periodic task.  You must also  drop the engine to do a valve job or
to replace your engine compartment seals and a number of other maintenance
chores are most easily accomplished with the engine out of the vehicle.  

There are really only two kinds of Volkswagen owners, those who have removed
their engine and those who are going to.
