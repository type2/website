&gt; can you?  You tell me...

I know you can fairly easily get the accelerator pump discharge tube 
separately.  I think check the Rocky Mountain Motorworks (or Bus Stop) 
catalog.  Also, the idle shut-off switch and the automatic choke, if 
you use it.  Also, I recently bought locally a barrel nut that you use to 
attach the accelerator cable (they always fall out when I'm not looking 
and I lose them).  Got it at an independent repair shop that handles 
VWs.  May just be a standard part for any carb.

What someone said about getting extra carbs for parts is a good idea.  I 
got a used stock carb (30 PICT-3) at a bug show for $5.00  There were 
boxes of old Solex carbs.
