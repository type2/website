Subject: fuel type for bus...

    Thanx for all those responses to my question about the fuel for a 73 bus.
I guess the bottom line is I can use unleaded, but preferably 91 octane or
more (Iguess that would make it premium). Maybe toss in a tankful of leaded
once in a blue moon....right ???
  By the way: you guys are a REALLY active mailgroup...how do you manage to
read all these messages every day ? Or are all of you full time computer
eggheads ? any suggestions ??

                    Gregor, 73 westy...
