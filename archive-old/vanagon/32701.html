&gt; hey now,

&gt; ... i inserted the key on the drivers side and unlocked the
&gt; door. when i took the key out, the lock was still attached!
&gt; now, i can still lock the door but of course i have to enter
&gt; through the passenger side! any ideas how to fix this? i've
&gt; got all the parts though the mechanism kinda fell apart.

I don't know what year you have, so I can't be specific,
but cylinder/core mechanisms on push-button splitties
are held in by a tiny set screw.  It is accessible (and
therefore able to be tightened) by removing the handle.
There is a slot in the core that the set screw rides
in when the core is turned by the key.  Maybe over the
years the screw wore down or loosened enough to let
the core slip out attached to your key.
