Subject: Need key for 88 Vanagon
From: chawk_at_juno_dot_com (j g shepard)

Went to the local dealer yesterday to get a couple VW keyblanks (the ones
with the VW logo and rubber handle) and the parts dude said they were NLA
(no longer available).  Is this true? They had cheesy generic keyblanks
but I want originals. I guess I'm to picky. Does anyone know where I can
get original keyblanks? I have only one key and I lose stuff frequently.
Help! Thanks.


Justin
