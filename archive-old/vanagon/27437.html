&gt;When I open up the back door on my &quot;new&quot; '89 Syncro, the two cylindrical
&gt;doohickeys (isn't that what Bentley calls them?) hold up the door just
&gt;long enough for me to get my arms full of the stuff I'm trying to unload
&gt;and then begin to let go, eventually bonking me in the head if I don't
&gt;duck out of the way in time.
&gt;
&gt;Is there a way to recondition these things?  Maybe (hopefully) just
&gt;relube the plunger seals?

No way to &quot;recondition&quot; these, you'll need new ones and they're pretty
expensive.  Another solution that you can use (instead or in addition) is a
little plastis hatch prop thing.  It's made for just this purpose &amp; mounts on
the rod such that when the hatch is lifted all the way it snaps in and holdt
the hatch.  When you want to close the hatch, just flick the little lever out
and the hatch comes down.  I got mine from J.C.Whitney, but I've also seen
them at Wal-Mart.  I use mine in addition to properly working supports and
have positioned it so that it does not automatically click into place every
time I open the hatch.  When I plan to have the hatch up for a longish period
of time I just engage the little lever manually.  I speculate that this might
give longer life to the supports if the weight of the hatch isn't bearing on
them so long.  I think these things are about $5.
