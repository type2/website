The person who did mine today was a Mr. Anderson. Very, very nice. Even
fixed my heater cable bolt while he was at it. No exhaust leaks and it
looks like everything fits like it is supposed to but I haven't had a
chance to crawl underneath yet.

&gt; I suspect the guy that is replacing these boxes is applying too much
&gt; torque
&gt; &gt; to these small studs that are embedded in aluminum.  He should know
better.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; A lot of people have said this guy is nice, and did a good job on their
&gt; &gt; bus, but I am not happy with the &quot;work&quot; he did to my bus.  ....
&gt; &gt;YMMV but if this guy is going to work on your bus I'd suggest keeping an
eye
&gt; &gt;on him or volunteering to do the swap yourself.  I sure wish I had.

&gt;
&gt; Question .......Is there only one person doing these replacements or are
&gt; there several ?
&gt;
&gt; Maybee this would account for the discrepancy in the reports on the
&gt; quality of work performed!
&gt;
&gt; Does anyone have the name of the person (or persons) doing the work?
