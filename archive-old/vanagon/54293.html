Subject: Re: weird problem w/ poor 85 Westy gas

&gt; 	Is there knock sensor on the 2.1 Digifant engines? I know the
&gt; Digifant II is based on Bosch's Motronic FI system and one of the Motronics
&gt; was the first to use a knock sensor. I thought the knock sensor was designed
&gt; for use with turbo systems to advance/retard the timing to the instance before
&gt; the engine started knocking. I didn't think there was such provisions in
&gt; the Digifant ECU...
My '90 GTI 8V used Digifant *and* had a knock sensor. But, as far as 
I can tell, none of the w/b engines use one.
