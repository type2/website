Subject: Re: '80 Van won't start (sometimes)

Bruce, this happened to my '77 Westy two months ago. Battery and alt. good
but no go! I never found the exact problem, but since I cleaned the contacts
of all electrical connections related to starting, I haven't had the problem.
Especially check the ground strap in the engine compartment near the battery,
the heavy red wire from battery to starter, and the ground on the driver's
side of the tranny.

Good luck, and think simple!

Scott
