Just a guess,but I'd say that if you live where it gets cold in the winter,
someone was trying to conserve calories...It's supposed to be an exaust
vent and no, it shouldn't be taped up...

&gt; My '88 has black plastic air grills at the rear bottom of the front
doors. I
&gt; took the door panel off to install a map tray in the right door and
noticed
&gt; that the hole in the door behind the grill is taped up with black tape.
&gt;
&gt; Does anyone know what these grills are for and why they are taped up?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks
