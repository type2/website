Subject: RE &gt; CA Smog Check II 

Bill Abbott distributed the following data where HC are in &quot;ppm&quot; and CO is in
%:  

	Average of actual vehicles	Smog Check II standard
	&lt;1100 rpm	&gt;2500 rpm	&lt;1100 rpm	&gt; 2500 rpm
Year	HC	CO	HC	CO	HC	CO	HC	CO
66-67	212	2.3	182	1.7	700	5.5	600	4.5
68-70	192	2.3	163	1.7	650	5.5	600	4.5
71-74	147	1.8	123	1.4	550	5.0	400	4.0
75-80	60	0.3	52	0.5	220	2.0	180	1.7
81-83	42	0.1	37	0.2	120	1.5	150	1.5
84-86	37	0.1	31	0.2	120	1.0	150	1.2
87-92	29	0.1	20	0.1	120	1.0	140	1.0
93+	17	0.0	12	0.1	100	1.0	130	1.0

This is the data I have been trying to get - you see my take on this is that
they define a Gross Polluter in terms of exceeding the limits by a significant
amount.  What they never have said is whether or not they have changed the
limits, and HOW they go about changing them -because if they can change the
limits without any public input, review, or oversight, they have the ability
to make ANY vehicle a Gross Polluter.

I went back into my records* to see what the standards were for the last time
I had a smog check run.  Here's the info:

Test Date	1100		2500		Vehicle
       		HC	  CO  	   HC	  CO
3/96		500  	5.5    	Not Tested        	`68 LeMans, 350 cu in.
8/95		100	  1       	220  	1.2	             	`86 BMW, 2.8L

What this tells me is that the current Smog Check II standards are more
liberal  in some areas, tighter in others:  

For the `68, allowable HC limits are up from 500 to 650 ppm, CO remains the
same, and limits are established at 2500 rpm where before there was no test.

For the `86, allowable HC limits are up from 100 to 120 ppm at &quot;idle&quot; but
allowable HC limits are down to 150 from 220 ppm at 2500 rpm, and CO remains
the same in both cases.

What is also significant is that there appears to be no GROSS change in the
limits.

*  I keep my printouts from each smog test so that I can compare from test to
test to see if there are trends that will indicate how my engines are wearing.
