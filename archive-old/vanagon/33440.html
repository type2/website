&gt; Thom makes a good point.  I imagine the semaphore-in-need crowd is fairly
&gt; small.  Out here in the North East, most people don't even know what a 
&gt; splitty is.  I'm kinda concerned that a knowledgable VW'er would resort to
&gt; this form of &quot;borrowing&quot;....

We had a bad streak of &quot;gripping&quot; a while back.  There was a group of
8-10 guys who would go out each night and swipe stuff, even entire busses,
which they would strip.  Then they would go to shows and sell the stuff.
A couple of the guys got the crap beat out of them at the Kelly Park show
a couple years ago.  Someone recognized his stuff, got a couple of his buds
together, and went after them.  That didn't seem to stop them, however.
It seems everyone suspected them, but nobody was able to catch them in
the act.  They seem to have moved out of town; nobody has seen the guys for
a while now.

But, in the eventuallity that they return, or someone takes their place,
(which is almost inevitable) I use alternative means of fastening and
try to keep the bus in the garage at night.  I also use a club, which
I know isn't totally effective, but its better than nothing...
I also have a steering column lock that I wanna put on, when I figure out
how and where to drill the holes...
