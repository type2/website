Subject: Kadrons on SP engine

I'm considering putting dual Kadron solex carbs on an engine for
a '71 bus. Either a single-port or dual-port engine, 1600cc or bigger.
I've always heard that dual-port heads breathe better, but that
single-port heads are sturdier. Something about cracks developing 
in dual-port heads, from the intake port to the spark plug hole.

Anybody had any experience with putting dual carbs on a single-port
engine? Does this free up the breathing of the intake system? Any
info/examples of your experience, would be appreciated!
