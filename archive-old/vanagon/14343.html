Subject: (fwd) Anyone want some vanagon Diesel parts?

Saw this on r.a.vw today:

&gt; From: roshaugh_at_oucsace.cs.ohiou_dot_edu (Robert F. O'shaughnessy)
&gt; 
&gt; 	A friend of mine just bought an 82 Diesel Vanagon that had been
&gt; converted to gas (a carbed Rabbit engine no less!) when the Diesel dropped
&gt; a valve.  Either how, she's got the remains of the Diesel in the back seat
&gt; of the van and wants to know if anyone wants to buy them.
&gt; 	The head was severely gouged so we pitched it.  She still has the
&gt; block, but the #2 cylinder wall is gouged.  I can't really tell if you
&gt; could bore it out or not.  We pulled the glow plugs and injectors before
&gt; we threw the head away, so we've got them.  Best of all she still has the
&gt; injector pump and lines.
&gt; 	Drop me a line if you are interested.
&gt; 
&gt; 	Thanks, 
&gt; 		Bob
