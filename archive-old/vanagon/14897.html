&gt; If the bottom bolt is really tight, you may have to loosen it.  I think
&gt; it is a 13mm nut (one of those with the builtin plastic washer that
&gt; keeps it from turning easily) that can be reached with an open end between
&gt; the fan housing and the engine block.  Then again, I may be barking up the
&gt; wrong tree, or driving up the wrong road, or sumthin.  =)

  You're right again, I took mine apart Sunday and it's just like you
  said except that I don't think mine had any plastic in the nut.

  &quot;May the Schwarze be with you&quot; &lt;A line from &quot;Spaceballs&quot;, revived by my
  kids during the off-road extravaganza at Red Rock, also apropos when you
  need mechanical advice&gt;.
