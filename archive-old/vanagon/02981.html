&gt;Addressing the original question, which is better, Castrol GTX changed
&gt;every 3,000 miles, or a synthetic oil changed at 3,000 or 5,000, or 7,000?
&gt;When it comes down to it, the extra cost (about $7/4 quarts vs $16/4
quarts)
&gt;would be worth it, if there was a difference.  

	If you're operating under *severe* conditions, e.g., racing, then
it might be worth it.  All that I have heard from people who have torn 
down motors beyond 80K is that if you change the oil and filter every 3K,
then the crosshatch from the original factory cylinder honing will still
be visible in the cylinder bores.  Sounds like dead dinosaurs do the job
just fine.

&gt;I must have missed the &quot;conclusive&quot; report posted earlier, so maybe it's
&gt;time for a repost, or at least a followup discussion.

	It is included at the end of this article.

&gt;One more question;  has anyone tried Kendall Oils?  My father swears by
&gt;them, claiming the other brands spend their money (and hence your cost)
&gt;on advertising, whereas Kendall oil is just higher quality.

	From what I understand, Castrol uses the best additive package
of all dead dinosaur oils, so that's what I use.  Kendall is commonly
used by dealership service departments, which I don't trust to do anything
except maximize their profit, so I don't respect their choice of oil. 
That,
of course, is nothing but my own personal bias and should be taken or
discarded as such.
