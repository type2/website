&gt; high-performance applications.  Check a speed shop like SuperShops or
&gt; one of the hotrod mags for more information.

Yeah... what Dave said.  My roommate works for Vic Hubbards here in the 
bay area, they're a real performance shop.  And he said they have 
them in 3 different pressure ranges there.
