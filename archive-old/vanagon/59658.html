Subject: 83 or 85?

Well, thanks all for helping me in my decision. I have decided to buy the 83 due to its simplicity and ease of repair. besides, i like the owner's attitude and meticulousness (sp?). I will pick it up tomorrow and drive it home (5 hours), wish me luck!

I will need to do some repairs to it before too long, namely front calipers and rotors. Anybody have an idea about how much these should cost and a good source to purchase vanagon parts (apart from VW!). Private replies are fine to keep traffic down on the list.
Thanks
Rio
