Subject: Warmer bus talk

     Hi all,
     
     With all this talk of partitions between cab and back area, I've gotta 
     tell you about my mates panel van. It's a '66 Panel with twin sliding 
     doors (ooo, rare) and has a factory fitted partition between the cab 
     and the loading area. It looks something like:
     
       _____________
     /     ____     \ 
     |    |____|    |
     |              |
      -------------- 
     
     Yep that's a little window to see through as well. It's the only one 
     I've seen but it's genuine. I figure you can make one from some 
     hardboard (you know the 3 mm thick cardboard stuff that the door 
     panels are made from), cut a hole for a window, and perhaps nail some 
     upright wood to it for rigidity. I've got a spare rear hatch glass 
     which would make a cool window, just use a window rubber out of a 
     bread-loaf bus that had NONE-factory side windows - the ones that 
     stick out.
     
     Now it's starting to get cold over here I might really do this.
     
     Lee.
