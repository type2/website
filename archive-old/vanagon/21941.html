Thanks everyone for the great ideas:

1. I could probably mount the brackets up higher, but, I hoped to use 
the predrilled holes that seemed to be already in the correct place on 
the front pillars.--If I move it up to high wont be much room though.

2. The poles are the same length so it appears that is not it.  

3. Is everyone sure that maybe the busses didn't get a little wider in 
76??--Who knows.

We will solve this mystery!!!!????
