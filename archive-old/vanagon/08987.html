&gt; 	But am I the only one out there who's torn the air 
&gt; conditioning out of his van? The A/C didn't work when I bought the 
&gt; van, and I didn't personally care for it- it made the engine bay 
&gt; cluttered, and the big plenum/control thingie over the windshield made 
&gt; the windshield seem too small. I left it alone for a while, but I 
&gt; finally got sick of hitting my head on the duct that ran the length of 
&gt; the roof- really a pain when making the bed, etc. And, how could I 
&gt; criticize those who blow holes in the ozone while continuing to 
&gt; consume freon myself?

You obviously don't live in Atlanta, GA!  My '85 does not have the same 
arrangement for AC as yours does, and mine isn't presently working either 
(i don't think it is, anyway, it may be to cold to really know) but I 
think I'll concentrate on getting mine fixed and try to make sure that it 
doesn't leak the freon from now on.

That does bring up an interesting point though--what about CFC-Free AC 
for Vanagons and when will replacement refrigerant become illicit? or 
illegal for that matter.  Any info on this subject is greatly appreciated.

Welcome to the list!
