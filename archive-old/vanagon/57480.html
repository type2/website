Subject: Cooling System

        Looking for help from one of you with a Bentley Manual ( I still
await mine!). I recently replaced my temperature sending unit. In doing so,
some of the cooling was drained. I have replaced my sending unit and have
purchased and mixed some new phosphate free antifreeze. My question is, can
I refill the system or do I have to go through a particular bleed proceedure?
        Thanks in advance!
