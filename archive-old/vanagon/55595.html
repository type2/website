Subject: SA Quad light grille UPDATE

Hi, All -
 
I'm currently sifting thru the feedback, looks positive.

here's another website you can punch up with a pic of a brand new SA &quot;Microbus&quot; 
( I know - thats sacreliege to call a Vanagon a &quot;Microbus&quot;!!, but hey - I didn't
name it)

So, as you know - any reference to &quot;Microbus&quot; &quot;Kombi&quot;  &quot;Caravelle&quot; &quot;Volksiebus&quot;
etc.  is all referring to the current Vanagon bodied 5 cyl rear engined  Vans
that are still being made there. (this was forwarded to me by a someone in SA -
he thought the name &quot;Vanagon&quot; sounded strange...) I don't blame him  :&lt;)

Anyway - here it is: ( &quot;R&quot; is the South African monetary unit, the Rand)
I must tell you - the pics take a long time to load, and there was a bunch of
&quot;schrapnel&quot; on the finished image...
-Notice how the lower rad. grille goes all the way to the turn sigs....
and the bumpers are different too, and I believe those are the European version
of the Carat alloy wheel....
try it out.

&gt;Check out a pic of a current Microbus with the new-style dual round
&gt;headlight grille at:

&gt;
&gt;If you're on the vanagon (awful name!) list you might want to point them at
&gt;it as I gather there is some interest in the Audi-engined SA Micros. Just
&gt;to update you, VWSA still builds the old rear-engined Microbuses (as you
&gt;know) with a choice of engines: 1,8l carb-fed Golf engine, 2,3l FI Audi and
&gt;2,6l FI Audi. They come in Panelvan (1,8 only), Volksiebus (1,8 and 2,3),
&gt;Microbus (2,6) and Caravelle (2,6) guises. The Volksiebus version is the
&gt;equivalent of the old Kombi, tho nowhere near as spartan. They are also not
&gt;cheap -- the 1,8l Volksiebus costs over R80 000 (R4,50 to the dollar) with
&gt;the Caravelle starting at nearly R150 000.
