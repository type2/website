Hey Nick, 
It is true that those boots last longer.  I prefer the darker red version.
Don't even bother to use the split boot again.  I've tried various methods
to seal those, and even if you seal with silicone goop you will still get
a  vacuum leak.  It is a bitch to change  those things without pulling the
engine.  Maybe it's time you graduated to that stage.  VERY easy on the '71.

Gooday, 	
Chris   '71 ? ... and assorted bugs.
