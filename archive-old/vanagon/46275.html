Subject: Firearms and Inuvik?

VanBondo is not going on the Inuvik trip but had a random thought go off.

Let's suppose &quot;someone&quot; wanted to pack while on the Alaskan Hwy. Let's also
suppose that it's illegal to carry firearms into Canada. How does &quot;someone&quot;
get the weapons (protectors of the ass) into Alaska? What are the applicable
laws? What permits are required?
I personally have as many weapons as I have skateboards...
