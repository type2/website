Subject: PORCHE or Aircooled CONVERSION for 91 Vanagon ?? Has it been done.

My 91 Vanagon Carat 2.1 Seized up....
We are thinking about a conversion to a Porsche 6 cyl or and Aircooled
Bus engine.  What sort of conversions make sense and have been done...
are there any &quot;kits&quot; for this.

Thanks in advanced.
