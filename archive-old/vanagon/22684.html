 David,

 I spoke briefly with a co-worker who has an '87 Vanagon about tires. His
 solution was to by automotive XZX &lt;non-reinforced&gt; and use them on the
 front only. He told me that the non reinforced tires are not rated to
 the inflation pressure necessary for the rear of the Vanagon and he had
 dire warnings about the handling of the Vanagon with the rears inflated
 to only 32 psi &lt;he experimented&gt;.

 Frankly, this seems like a pretty flakey solution to save $70 on a pair of
 tires. You can no longer rotate front to rear, and what do you use as a spare?

 I've been ponying up the bucks for the reinforced Michelins &lt;$90 each, last 
 time!&gt; but plan on buying the LT195/75-R14s that Costco sells for $50 or so
 next time. The LT195/75 have almost the same overall diameter as the 185/80s
 do, they are rated to inflation pressures of 50 psi, have the correct 
 load range, and have a M&amp;S &lt;that's M&amp;S, NOT S&amp;M&gt; tread pattern which I'd
 like for off-pavement and winter use.
