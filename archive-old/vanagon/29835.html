Subject: Oil Oil Oil Light....


My name is Matthew, and its been one year since my last Vanagon Problem.

(NuBus - '82 Diesel)

Ok...So...I stopped at the construction site of my new house, and
looked at the work-in-progress....and when I came back, I started 
NuBus..I noticed two things:

   1) The oil light was on.

   2) The brakes sucked.

So, since I was 4 miles from my current home, I broke rule #1 and drove the 
rest of the way home. (If my wife pulled that stunt, I'd divorce her...)

The engine didn't make bad sounds, although with a diseasal, I don't know
if I would hear the sound of cylinders scoring. Also, the brakes still
sucked.

So...looking for input....

1) Could my sensor be bad? How would I know? (I checked the oil level..)

2) Why did my brakes start sucking at the same time?

3) Does this have anything to do with the fact that I received my 
   NETVERGNUGEN shirt today?
