Subject: 82 vw bus needing home

Ingine blown worped drivers side head. automatic in good shape. Air 
condistioning system holding r12 charge when the motors running you can 
look forward to being cool. Color Yellow with cream roof. My wife calls 
it a paper weight. I am sorry that it does not have a true VW parent. 
Please bring adoption papers (best offer). I think she might be going 
stir crazy sitting in the garage all by herself. May be someone in the 
mental heath field? Location Raleigh, NC
