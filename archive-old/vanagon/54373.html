Jeff,

I can't believe that the coil have to be changed with the
&lt;&lt;-- sorry, I only know the German's --&gt;&gt;
TSZ (Transistor Zu&quot;ndung) you called Hall Control Unit.
There is also another box DLS (Digitale Leerlauf
Stabilisierung) which keeps your engine on perfect idle
revolutions. The DLS can be switched out by pulling both
connectors and putting them together without the DLS. But
I'm not sure if FI engines have this DLS.

Rudy, check this simple test first and look at the
connectors if they are corroded. Same on TSZ and
coil connectors.

If it doesn't help you may change the TSZ (HCU).

Do you have a tach? What's about this?

When I replaced my coil on my Hall ignition CA '80 Westi, I was told,
and Bentley sorta concurred, that I also needed to replace the Hall
Control Unit also.  I, being cheap, didn't.  I was experiencing
intermittent cutting out before and after the coil replacement.

Apparently they two should be replaced together.  Rudy indicated that
the coil was replaced, but not the Hall Control Unit.  This might be
the culprit.  Check around on prices, I found it anywhere from $65 to
$125.  The Hall Control Unit is the one mounted on the aluminum heat
sink on the side of the engine bay.  It has other names, and several
FLAPS had no clue as to what I wanted.  Be persistant and specific,
bring your manual(s) to show them what you want.

I replaced the HCU and all is well in the engine bay.

BTW, Rudy, I hardwired a remote starter in the engine bay to help
locate the culprit (lots of cautions come with such installation).
If you can't find the HCU, email me, I found it at a small shop in
Grass Valley at the lowest price, could be lower out there however.

Hi! I have 80 vanagon that has been a total learning adventure. The
symptoms started about 5 months ago. It began with occasional loss of power
(like I had turned the key off) which was remedied usually by just
restarting. But it progressively got worse to the point that it wouldn't
start. I've replaced(whew!)the coil, dual relay, thermo time switch,
cylindar head temp senser, air flow meter. All to no avail. Does anybody
have any suggestions? any and all ideas are appreciated,
Thanks... Rudy B. Santa Rosa, CA

After some prodding on engine specifics -

Here is some info on my 80 vanagon ignition gremlin:
 1) CA emisson controls so it has a halls control unit

 2) It seems to die(ha ha) when I'm crusing at a lower rpm(I don't know the
rpms cause no tach), it doesn't happen when I'm excelerating(sp?)

 3) It seems to run fine for approx. 20-30 minutes. then the little buggers
start #_at_$%*&amp;^ing with the ignition....so it seems to heat related.

It used to restart after a few minutes but it has gotten so bad that it is
starting. once again thanks for any and all suggestions...Rudy B. Santa
Rosa, CA
