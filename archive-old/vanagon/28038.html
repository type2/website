&gt;
&gt;For $20 bucks you can get the Coleman 400,000 cp spotlight which will also
&gt;burn a hole through a wall.  It is smaller and more compact and has more than
&gt;enough power for most NORMAL people.  It also comes in an 800,000cp version
&gt;with a bigger reflector.  
&gt;
&gt;REMEMBER, it is not so much the power of the bulb but the effeciency of the
&gt;relflector which is most important.  HOW the light is distributred is
&gt;critical.  It's not the gun it's the gunner...(tell THAT to John Holmes...may
&gt;he rest in peace).  I've been very impressed with the Colemans and they
&gt;should be considered as an alternative to the Brinkman.  
&gt;
&gt;And, by the way, have you measured the cp?  Is it a true million or only a
&gt;paltry 900,001?
&gt;
&gt;Let's have a light off.  You use your Brinkman and  I'll use my Coleman and
&gt;we'll see who can burn out more retinas of passing cabbies.
