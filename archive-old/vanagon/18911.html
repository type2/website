Blowing in the Wind.
    by Bob Dylan Thomas Wolfe Blitzer &amp; Dasher &amp; Prancer &amp; ...

Why does a bus weave all over the road,
And never seem to stay in one lane?
Yes, and why does it slow down so much on the hills,
And make your job of driving it a pain?

The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind,
The answer is blowing in the wind.

And then why do those trucks seem to fly past your van,
As you rock back and forth, side to side,
And then why do the muscles in your arms and your legs,
Seem to ache at the end of your ride?

The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind,
The answer is blowing in the wind.

Why do you think, as you drive down the hill,
That your speed is a bit more than norm?
And then why do you think that the rain jumps around
On your windshield as you drive through the storm?

The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind,
The answer is blowing in the wind.

How do you drive when the weather is bad,
And it's raining to hard for you to see?
And so, how do you drive when the snow hits your van,
Hits it hard enough to make you want to pee?

The answer, my friend, is slowing in the wind,
The answer is slowing in the wind.

As you drive in your bus on the freeway at rush,
How to you keep your anger subdued?
Yes, and how do you calm all your innermost fire,
When those boneheads are right in front of you?

The answer, my friend, is driving with the Zen,
The answer is driving with the Zen.

And so how do you make up these silly old songs?
And then how do the words find their way?
Yes, and how does this happen each week after week,
And always it seems on Fri-day?

The answer, my friend, is going round the bend,
The answer is going round the bend!  ;)
