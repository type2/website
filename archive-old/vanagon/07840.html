&gt;&gt;They are complete with the fold-down armrests, but did not come in orange

Now wait a minute! These aircooled guys are taking the reserves from us
vanagoneers!#? What do you mean vanagon seats are more comfortable? They are
terrible!!! I know how bad they are kaus I got two vanagons and the seats are
the worst of anything I ever experienced. Leave them alone in junk yards.
Kaus my vanagon will need them someday. Well, can you at least leave those
GL seats alone? Kaus they got the worst arms on them. You can have as many L
model seats as you want. OK! OK! Just don't get too close to junk yards in 
California. You may have GL seats anywhere else kaus I am going to need them 
here in California.
