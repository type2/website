Subject: 	questions about '83

        Well got back yesterday from my second weekend trip in a row, =
which
was even better than the first. Some friends and I went out to a local =
lake
and hung at the beach all day. Met this guy how had parked just down =
from
me in a '78 and he said he had the original tent with it, but then
mentioned that it attached to the back. So how big are those things and =
how
do they even attach?=20

(stuff deleted)

The tent in question is a tent made for bubble window passengervans =
without the rear fold down seat.  These hooked on the back of the car =
and were supported various ways, depending on the manufacturer.  I have =
one for my 78 westy, and it really adds to the space inside.  Also, when =
I have my side tent, my rear tent, and the top up, I have more canvas =
than sheet metal!!
