Subject: Junkyard Syncro Report

Hi All,

I had the oppurtunity on Friday to visit an 87 Junkyard Syncro that Bob
Hufford reported on a while back on the list.  It's just south of
Springfield, MO.  The drivetrain is gone, but the driveshaft, rf axle and
cv's are still there.  The rear bumper and dash are gone, but all the
other stuff is there. The lr 1/4 is tweeked, but to my eyes it looked like
a great rebuilder.  BUT! The yard is very pricey and refused to even
consider selling it as a rebuilder.  BTW, std wheels, manual shift, blue
cloth interior.  They do ship out parts: 

Hwy 160 Import Salvage, Inc
Route 1, Box 112-1
Nixa, MO  65714
1-800-843-3256
1-417-725-264
Jason or Dan Tourville
