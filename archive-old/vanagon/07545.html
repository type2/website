&gt;Someone, I think it was Joel, recently posted some names of companies that
&gt;might stock '81 Vanago speedometer/odometers.  After much dissection of the
&gt;beast I think we are about to give up on it and VW says the replacement
&gt;from them will cost $250!!!  Please repost/post any information you all
&gt;have about buyin replacment speedo/odos.

first, buy a copy of European Car, Hot VWs, and Excellance (or just look at
them in the store and copy down any ads that seem worthwhile). :)
next, get out the yellow pages.

call other dealers across the state and country (as seen in the above
mentioned ads) ... not all dealers charge the same prices.

check the yellow pages under &quot;auto&quot; and also under &quot;Speedometer&quot; or &quot;Measuring
Instruments&quot; or stuff like that.

one of the old ads i have is
North Hollywood Speedometer      now this ad is pretty old, so it's likely
6111 Lankershim                  that at least the area code has changed.
North Hollywood, CA 91606
(818) 761-5136

i thought the one i recalled from Excellence ads was United Instruments or
something like that in L.A.

the point being that lots and lots of cars use VDO instruments, and the
bigger cities (LA being one of those) will have repair places that can
either fix it or swap it or sell you a used one. but you gotta go look for
them. :)
