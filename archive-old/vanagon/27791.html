&gt; Hi!
&gt; I'm an auto technician-formerly with Volkswagen, now with Mercedes-Benz. I
&gt; work at a MB-BMW-AUDI dealer here in Westmont,Il. I worked on VW's from '72
&gt; to '83, everything from '84-'86 and MB's from '87 to present. I'm happy to
&gt; find this mailing list, and would be happy to help any of you if I can.
&gt; I've owned buses since I learned to drive in '67,presently have a '84
&gt; Vanagon-I love it. I've done a lot to it, head gaskets, clutch, fuel
&gt; sender, replaced the coolant tubes, repaired various running problems,etc.
&gt; I also have a friend who seems to specialize in Vanagons, and works out of
&gt; his garage. If I'm stumped on something about a Vanagon, I call him. Again,
&gt; happy to be a member of this list, and willing to help!
&gt; 

I dunno guys...
I don't think he's got enough qualifications to join our group.

Should we let him in?

:)

Just Joking Yug.
