Subject: re: backup (non)lights?

Someone asked:
&gt; Does anyone run halogen bulbs in the reverse lights?  Will the sockets
&gt;neet to  be  changed out as well?  Where can the bulbs (and sockets if
&gt;necessary) be had?
And M.W. replied:
&gt;There's only one thing to say:
&gt;Backup lights?  I don't need to steenkin' backup lights!  :-P &lt;grin&gt;
 &gt;- Mike White 

Amen to that!  I'll add backup lights to my little list of &quot;optional
accessories for Bugs/Buses&quot; (remember last time I wrote about unnecessary
fuel gauges. . .figuring,  that's what you got an odometer for.)  Anyway,
the distinct screaming and &quot;crunch!&quot; of pedestrians underneath my Bus always
lets me know when I've backed up sufficiently.

(P.S.  Add a smiley to the end of that statement, of course.)
