Subject: Cinderblock thru Van window

Whenever my friend Kevin takes his '85 Weekender into Philly, he knows he
takes its life in his hands...

This weekend somebody threw a cinder block through the driver's side
sliding window.     :-(

He's got a new window, and he wants to just replace the sliding part
(avoiding the rubber seal replacement for the whole window housing).

He thinks he can take out the track that the sliding window, well, slides
in, but he doesn't want to take things apart without being sure that this
is the right (read: _nondestructive_) way to do it.

Can anyone who's done this give him a tip? His email address is
Ransom999_at_aol_dot_com.

Thanks,
Dave M.
