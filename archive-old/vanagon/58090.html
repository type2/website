Subject: RE: Rocker Panels for 87 Wolfs.

When I banged into someone with my 91 and damaged the right corner of the 
front bumper, the insurance quote for the repair totaled $800.00. The front 
bumper (unpainted) from VW was $599.00 The long side panel on the drivers side 
was around the same price. The rear bumper was around $150.00 and the end caps 
were $90.00 each. I didn't price the sliding door panel or the smaller panels 
for the front doors and the right rear wheel arch but would imagine that they 
are in the $90-$200 range. All of these items come unpainted. I'm not sure how 
the clips that hold the panels on are attached or how much they cost, but they 
probably aren't cheap. BTW, I took my $300.00 from my insurance company (after 
my deductable) and went to my local VW FLAPS with bumper in hand. They 
repaired the cracked bumper, repainted the silver/gray and the black strip, 
then put a coat of clearcoat on for $200.00.  

If you really want the rocker panels and haven't won the lottery lately, you 
will need to get them off of a junker.

BTW I priced the five parts that make up the front spoiler at a dealer and 
came up with $300.00+ for everything.

I really like the look of the 89-91 Vanagons with the 'rocker panels'.  

What would the VW dealer price be for them? 

What would the procedure be for mounting them onto my 87 Wolfs?  Is
drilling part of the steps?
