Subject: water tank float prob. solved...( I think)

Hi Everyone.  I posted  to the list a few days ago the problems I was 
having with incorrect water tank float readings for my '90 Westy.  

I checked out the float and determined it to be OK by using a digital 
volt-ohm meter.  I was getting consistent readings throughout the 
various ranges on the float.

By rapping on the meter, the led's would reflect the correct level.  
Like, oh yeah!  Also, I noticed, that by leaving the meter on for a 
few minutes (letting the components gets warmed up), the meter would 
also automatically drop to the correct level.  I was getting a green 
or yellow reading on an empty water tank initially.

So, I washed the circuit board (both sides) with gasoline using a 
paint brush to remove all or any oxidants that are on the board.  I 
also resoldered all the contact points for the components on the back 
of the circuit board.  Well, when I plugged it back into the van, it 
worked right away.  

So, this is good.  I hope that the problem is solved.  I'll know in 
time if it resurfaces.  This display panel is $278 CDN at my local 
dealer for no more than $20 CDN in components.

Harry.
