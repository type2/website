Subject: Re: Heater Blower Resistor Replacement

&gt;&gt; 1) Am I correct about the resistor location?
&gt;
&gt;NO, the resistors are located behind the driver's side headlights.
&gt;Remove the headlight assembly and look below toward the outside and
&gt;locate two large ceramic wrapped resistors.


I believe these are the resistors for the rad fan, the heater blower
resistor is inside the airbox, was in my 2 85's and an '87.  Tim
