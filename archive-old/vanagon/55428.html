&gt; &gt; I second the idea that there is no way to machine the heads. The geometry

&gt; &gt; The reason for this is that the head is &quot;supported&quot; by the cylinders not
&gt; &gt; the gasket as in conventional engines.

&gt; &gt; Removing any metal from the sealing surface of the head would make the

Hi, I wonder how critical the dimension between the cylinder seal area
and the rubber gasket seal area is? I have found that dimension is
different between the German heads and the Spanish heads. The Spanish
heads have less pressure on the rubber gasket.
