&gt;While I'm at it, wouldn't it be lovely to have the European Vanagon option
&gt;of headlight washers? The resevoir tank has two pumps, one for the

uhhhh, you realize this IS an option on the vanagons?? there are two little
tower-thingies that stick out of the plastic grill (between the headlights)
and squirt onto the headlights. don't know about the pumps or any additional
reservoir.

which brings up a question for the british bunch: since your steering wheel
is on the RIGHT-hand side of the car, where is your windscreen washer fluid
reservoir? if it is on the right-hand side as well, then we could all have
fun having TWO reservoirs (one american/canadian on the left side, and one
UK on the right side)!! :)

i think the 3-4 feet of tubing wrapped around the radiator pipe sounds like
it should work, and is a whole lot cheaper than the SAAB thingie (not as
elegant, i admit ... and certainly not a real &quot;gizmo&quot; ... but still cheaper).
and the sprial of tubing should retain enough fluid to a first squirt of nice
warm fluid ... course, if your windshield is really dirty, you'll be back to
cold fluid pretty quickly.
