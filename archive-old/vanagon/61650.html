&lt;&lt; Any of you SW Vanagoners know if the temperatures create problems driving
 in and out of Death Valley?  My kids are on the road headed that way in my

Best remedy when needle is &quot;going where it shouldn't be&quot; -

Kill the A/C, crank up the heat and roll down the windows.  It really works,
you can see the needle drop.
