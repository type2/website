Subject:      Re: automatic vs. manual transmission

&gt;&gt; I have found a nice 87 which I might purchase, but it has an
automatic
&gt;&gt; transmission.  Would anyone care to comment on the pros and cons of
the
&gt;&gt; automatic tranny ?

My '85 is an automatic. The Vanagons are legendary for being
underpowered. An automatic adds to the problem because _it_ decides when
to shift, not you -- and often it shifts before I would -- resulting in
not getting extra power from having the engine at higher RPMs. Also,
being a 3 speed, you get worse gas mileage on the highway because you
don't have overdrive (the 4th gear on a manual).

That said, I enjoy my automatic. Having resigned myself to never having
tons of power, the auto works just fine. I just put it in gear an go.
Very handy in stop and go traffic. Having only owned the van for a
month, I can't yet comment on the reliability of the transmission.

To get maximum mileage (and the least wear on the engine) accelerate
gradually. One of the list members (sorry, I forget who) suggested
imagining having an egg between your foot and the accelerator pedal.
Accelerate slowly as to not break the egg.

In the end, I would have gotten a manual if I had the choice, but as
rare as these vans are getting to be, when the right one comes along you
have to take what you can get. I got auto and I am happy with it.
