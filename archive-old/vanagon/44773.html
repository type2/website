&gt;Hi Volks,
&gt;
&gt; With all the talk lately of CB's in VW's, I just couldn't resist....
&gt;
&gt; &quot;..and eleven long haired friends of Jesus in a chartreuse Microbus.&quot;
&gt;
&gt;If you don't remember, your bus is older than you are.

&quot;better put that microbus in behind that suicide jockey...
 he's hauling dynamite, and he needs all the help he can get!&quot;


And, BTW, did any of you hear about this wagon train to SLC,
recreating the Mormon &quot;diaspora&quot;?  I heard a piece on NPR about it
yesterday, and had to smile when the reporter said, &quot;She hopes to
reach the Council Bluffs by the 4th of July.&quot;

&quot;If the wolf don't howl and the river don't rise,
 we can make that valley before we die...&quot;

Sometimes I feel that way in a bus, too.

-Rodney
