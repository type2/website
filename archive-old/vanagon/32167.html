&gt;
&gt;Volks,
&gt;        I've been wanting to install a vented propane heater in my bus for
&gt;some time.  One thing I am wondering about though.  Those of you that
&gt;have installed them, are you using the stock propane tank?  The little
&gt;dinky one?  My '73 Safare has a slightly larger tank than the Westy (3
&gt;gallons) but I don't think I could get more than two nights worth of
&gt;heat out of it.  If I'm camping in the snow in the boonies for a week,
&gt;
&gt;I have a 6000 BTU vented heater installed which seems to be more than enough to
&gt;keep us warm on ski trips.  At this output rating a gallon of LP will provide 17
&gt;hours of continuous heating.  Since we don't really run it during the day, our
&gt;capacity for 51 hours of heat generally gives us about a week's worth of heat.
&gt;If we want more, I have a quick connect hose fitted to the heater that lets me
&gt;plug in a portable 5 gallon tank.
&gt;
&gt;Enjoy.

    How is it vented? Where did you buy the heater? What was
    involved in the installation? How is the heat controlled?
    Is the tank in a cage to keep it from being crushed in an
    accident?
