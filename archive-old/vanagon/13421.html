Wow, what *are* these things. They are gigantic (be warned ye who don't have
T1 connections) but they are great and all the detail is great. In netscape
they look gigantic and I am not sure how to print, exactly. 

Anyway, who wrote this and why? It seems like a sort of neat manual for the
head gasket repair.
