Subject: Mazda model badges for sale

Hi, I am not a list member but hope this information
is of interest to you anyway.

I have a limited stock of badges for Mazda cars of the 80's
which I bought from a car body repair shop which closed down.
These are the badges which appear on the trunk(boot) lid and
indicate make, model amd engine type. They are often of a
quality where the chrome begin to flake off after a few years
especially in a bad climate, so new badges could come handy.

I figure you Mazda enthusiasts could be interested.

The stock includes the typical plastic chromed badges
of the 80's models as sold in Europe, such as :
&quot;MAZDA&quot;, &quot;323&quot; &quot;626&quot; &quot;929&quot; &quot;LX&quot; &quot;DX&quot; &quot;GTX&quot; &quot;1.6i&quot; &quot;Gt&quot; &quot;RX7&quot;, etc.

I figure $6-8 a piece would be fair + freight costs.

Send a reply with your specific needs or ask for
a faxed list. Make sure you include your fax number if so.

I can also sell the entire stock with good discount.
If so request a faxed list so you can estimate the value
and maybe make me an offer.

The stock also includes some 100 badges for other makes such as
Opel,SAAB,BMW,VW. All new orig.parts.
