&gt; I was talking with David Schwarze this morning on IRC, and we both
&gt; thought it might be kind of fun to have a fall or even winter
&gt; gathering of west coasters from the list (anyone else who wants
&gt; to make the trip, welcome, too, of course!).  We both liked the
&gt; idea of Yosemite but agreed it would probably be too crowded,
&gt; even given the time of year, and David suggested Sequoyah, south
&gt; of Yosemite.  
 
Sounds nice, Sequoia might be a little chilly in Dec. or Jan.
How about the Anza-Borrego desert?  (west of San Diego)

Yosemite is quite a trek from Tucson, I probably wouldn't make it.

If I make it I promise to do photography while there.

 Cheers,
