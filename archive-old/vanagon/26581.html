Subject: Mechanics in London

Can anyone out there recommend a good VW mechanic in London? I'm
looking to buy myself a bus - something like a late 70's baywindow -
soonish but not being an ace VW mechanic (yet) I'd like to
have it looked over by someone who is before I part with any cash.
I know that some of the motoring clubs offer pre-purchase inspections
but these seem pretty pricey (about 160 pounds), not to mention a 3 or 4
day waiting list.

I'm planning a grand tour of Europe next summer - so I've got between
now and then to get to know my bus and sort out any problems. I'm still
pretty new to this VW business so any general advice about buying and
about getting ready for a big trip would be much appreciated.

Cheers,

Rob.
