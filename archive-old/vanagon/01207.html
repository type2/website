&gt; anachronistic old Harris said:
&gt; &gt;Does it matter how fast you drive on the way to the bank to get the
&gt; &gt;withdrawal (oh, and a withdrawal of extraordinary magnitude, I'm sure)
&gt; &gt;needed to keep the 1990 running?
&gt; 
&gt; the answer is: Yes.
&gt; 
&gt; you see, it involves Supply-Side Economics, Ripple-Factor Monetary
&gt; Distribution, and Fraudulent Check Bouncing.  By driving faster to
&gt; more than one bank, you can actually withdraw enough money to keep
&gt; a Water-Cooled VW Bus running.  And running it must remain, in order
&gt; to stay one step ahead of the High Sheriff and his Process Servers!
&gt; 

Remember that when the going gets real bad, a Vanagon Syncro is the 
_only_ way to escape to mountains and let the process servers eat 
your dust.  He he he.

&quot;Over hill, over dale,
As we leave the dusty trail
And our Syncros keep rollin' along...&quot;
