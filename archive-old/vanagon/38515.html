&gt; 
&gt; 1974 Custom Safare (non-poptop camper)

John,
	You have stumbled upon a fairly obscure camper - I have one similar
to it.  I have put some information on it up on the web at:

http://www.teleport_dot_com/~des/vw/daboat/

You said this isn't a pop-top, and I assume it isn't a hightop since you
didn't mention that.  It probably doesn't have the electric fridge or
stove then either.  Patrick Tower has a bus like this, if I remember.
He and I are the only Safare owners on this list, I think.

As far as I know, Safare is out of business.  I believe there were less
than 1,000 made.  Their floorplan is unique, but their build quality was
not very good.  The wood paneling in mine was falling apart.  If the
interior of this camper is in good shape, it is quite a find.

I would be very interested to know what the serial number of this
camper is.  I would guess it's in the 7 or 8 hundreds.  I have only seen
numbers between 600 and 1,000.  Maybe they started at 500?

All I can say is, if you like it, buy it, but don't expect to find parts
for the interior, and don't expect to see others like it in the
junkyard, EVER.  Don't have time to write any more about it now - please
let us know how it turns out!

-David
