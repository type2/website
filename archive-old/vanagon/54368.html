To remove the upper return springs, I placed a common screwdriver tip 
into the springs and pushed towards the center to unclip the inner 
end of the spring.

For re-assembly, the reverse didn't work.  I finally figured out that 
you can install the outer end of the spring to the shoe, then the inner 
end to the clip, and THEN install the shoe into the lower holder 
(whatever it's called).  Then one can finaggle and lever the upper 
part of the shoe into the cylinder holder.

This sounds like a good technique, too.

&gt;     Ob. 1)  VW really meant you to pull the hub when doing this job.  The 
&gt;     upper return springs are virtually inaccessible with the hub in place. 
&gt;     Solution:  After trying for an hour to get at these springs ( I like 
&gt;     to use finesse not brute force when working on mechanical systems) , I 
&gt;     decided to try removing the wheel cylinders since I had to replace 
&gt;     them anyway (they leaked).  I discovered you can easily use the 
&gt;     adjuster bar to spread the shoes apart, unbolt the wheel cylinder and 
&gt;     (after breaking it free with a light tap with a soft blow hammer) 
&gt;     rotate it 45 degrees and remove the wheel cylinder.  After that you 
&gt;     can back the adjuster bar back down and get at the springs with ease.  
&gt;     Reverse the procedure to reassemble the brakes.
