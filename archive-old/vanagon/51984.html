Subject: Re: Canada Customs

&gt; Hi Everyone.  A few weeks ago I mail ordered something from the US, 
&gt; and today I got a card in my mailbox for a parcel.  GREAT, I think!
&gt; 
&gt; I ordered some auto parts from Connecticut for $35.00 US.  Canada 
&gt; Customs wrote me up for the following:
&gt; 
&gt; Value:  $35.00 US X 1.3316 = $46.61 CDN
&gt; Duty:                 $0.84 
&gt; GST:                  $3.32
&gt; Handling fee:     $5.00
&gt; Total Payable:  $9.16
&gt; 
&gt; Ironically, I ordered the EXACT same thing EXACTLY a year ago, and 
&gt; none of these charges were applied.  
&gt; 
&gt; So, fellow Canucks, be aware of the tax man when ordering from 
&gt; outside of Canada.  I am a little confused as to why I have to pay 
&gt; GST for something that wasn't purchased in Canada.  Hmmm....
&gt; 
&gt; Harry.

I think it may be related to which courier is used, and how it's 
declared - I've had packages reach me overnight from the US, with 
value over $1000, and paid NO taxes, then waited 2-3 days for a $50 
item to clear customs other times... If it's a large $ item, it might 
be worth paying extra for FedEx or DHL.
