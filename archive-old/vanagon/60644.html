Subject: Putting Side Rocker Mouldings on Westy?
Date: Thu, 29 May 1997 13:51:33 -0400

I bought a used set of side rocker panel mouldings off a '91 Vanagon, which
I plan to put on my '89 Westy.   These are the plastic mouldings that
attach to the rockers and hang down a few inches below the body, found on
later-year Vanagons.

My question is, were these mouldings originally used on any Westies, or
just on the multivan campers (without propane)?  If they weren't originally
used on Westies, has anyone else put them on a Westy? I'm wondering whether
there will be enough clearance to fill the propane tank, or whether I'll
have to modify the drivers side moulding if I ever want to have propane
again.  The reason for my confusion is that a customer stopped by with a
'91 Westy, and his did not have the mouldings.

Thanks,
