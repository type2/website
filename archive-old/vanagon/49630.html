Subject: Bike racks


During my search for new motorhomes catalogs I found
an Italian address of a bike racks manufacturer:

FIAMMA
Via San Rocco, 56
I-21010 Cardano al Campo
Italy
Phone   +39 331 709111
FAX     +39 331 263777
E-mail  fiamma1_at_galactica.it

They have a nice 64 page catalog containing a little
bit more than bike racks. They also member of RVIA,
FRVTA IMHA/RVIC, FMCA of USA. So I guess they are
present on the local US market. Do someone know
Lloyd A. Lawson, P&amp;L Mobile Repair, Orlando FL?

German address of FIAMMA is:

FIAMMA
Zentrallager Deutschland
Gelthari-Ring 5-11
D-97505 Geldersheim
Germany
Phone   +49 9721 89077
FAX     +49 9721 805254
