&gt;&gt;I am offended by the protrayal of Eurovan owners in that commercial
&gt;&gt;that Jonathan brought up. 

I would bet there was an executive committee decision to use a van the masses
don't recognize in an effort to not anger the &quot;Dodge Boys&quot; et al.  

I recently ran into a similar type advertising example using the EV.  A PC
I recently bought included a CD which is supposed to help you make a decision
buying a car.  Supposedly *all* cars are included, however the EV is omitted.
The funny thing is the CD cover art shows an EV (only)...
