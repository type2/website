Subject: RE: Sqirting water on an oil cooler et al


I have trouble understanding the logic in this also...  The only way
I can see this happening is that the thermostat shutting down the
fluid flow into the radiator because the radiator is too cool and the
thermostat is fooled into thinking all of the engine is cool enough
that the coolant can bypass the radiator.  Am I missing something
here?
