SOTO/Classic Weekend Events
Friday, Saturday, and Sunday June 7-8-9, 1996

Time to get the word out and make plans!
VanBondo plans on attending the SOTO and Classic meets this weekend.
Will Camp at the Box on Wheels on Sat. for sure and hopfully Friday if
possible. The '67 Resto isn't complete so look for an ordinary looking White
'83 Westy with non stock wheels on it. The Gene Road Rally is actually
fairly fun. The gathering after words features food and  tons of *very nice*
raffle prizes! I will pass on it this year though due to scheduling/drive
from AZ.
