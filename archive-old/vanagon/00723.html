Subject: Westfalia Clubs ??

I am the proud owner of a 1977 VW Camper, and in search of a group of people
who share my interest in these VW's. Anyone know of a  club, in the central
NJ area with special interests in the Camper. Any info will be helpful. I am
looking for phone #'s and/or adresses for any such club(s).
