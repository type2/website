Hello,

When did a bus have a sunroof (except a deluxe).  In the latest issue of =
HotVWs on page 74, there is a 64 Standard(Kombi?) w/ a sunroof w/ no =
smaller windows like a Deluxe.  Is this factory?  What models had this =
as an option.  I thought that the sunroof was an option only on the =
Deluxe version.

Thanks,
Erik
