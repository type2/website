Subject: Parts needed

Hi, just thought I'd throw this on the list and see if I get any responses.

I am looking for some '86-'91 grey interior pieces.
-grey sliding door panel with grey velour insert
-grey headrests ( anybody take them off of the rear sofabed and don't use them
anymore?)
-front carpet in grey
-rear engine cover cushion in grey that goes w/ sofabed 
-jump seat hinge covers in grey
-front spoiler under bumper
-f&amp;r fiberglass bumpers
-power mirrors

if you have any of these items or know of someone or someplace that does, then
I'd appreciate if you could E-mail me with a response. thanks!

BTW, I have a complete blue velour interior out of a GL that I'm selling. I also
have misc. sidepanels and blue velour front buckets out of another GL.

Thanks again,
chris
