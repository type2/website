Hello,
I think I now have realized the conclusion to both problems:  the strange
sound and the blower fan.  My conclusion is this:
something (crud?) get stuck in the blower fan and was making the strange
sounds that I reported.  The stuck stuff resulted in the fan fuse (located
in a bad place) to blow.  Hence, I believe that both problems have now
been identified and mostly solved.
Thanks for all the advice!
