&gt; My '80 Vanagon has about 173K miles.  Original engine went about 155K 
&gt; fairly reliable miles (main problems were oil leaks and a couple of bad
&gt; lifters, and that damn accordian thermostat kept failing) until a valve
&gt; seat failed and made a minor mess inside the engine.  

My van has 86,000 on the clock and has 16,000 since the valve drop/rebuild-
over-christmas-break-gawdawful-expensive episode in 1991.  I would be
willing to bet that those are original miles, too.  73 campers don't seem
to run for very long at a time.
