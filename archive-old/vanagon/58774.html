In a message dated 97-04-22 14:38:51 EDT, you write:

&lt;&lt; no tach in my dash, just a clock &gt;&gt;

you must have a &quot;WWW&quot; (Wolfsburg Westy Weekender) (don't tell Jim Davis I
said that.. :&lt;)
or more officially known as a &quot;non-GL&quot; Wolfsburg Ed. Camper. 
I think if you get a dash cluster (speedo/tach/digital clock/etc.) out of a
'85 up Vanagon GL, it will plug right into your 14 pin multipoint connector,
and work, since all '85 up Vans were wired for the tach. The non-GL Vans had
no tach. (VW had to cut costs somewhere!!  :&lt;)

So, you need to find a whole speedo cluster from a '85 up Vanagon GL.
