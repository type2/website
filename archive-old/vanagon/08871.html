In the 10,000 miles we have put on the Westfalia, I have used 2 Frams, the
Canadian Tire equivalent manufactured by Fram and a Bosch and can
honestly say that there has been no noticeable difference in oil pressure
either at speed or at idle between them . OTOH, switching from 30 W single
grade
to 40 W single grade and then to 20w50 did increase in each case the oil
pressure. Now I am using 10w30 synthetic with a slight drop in pressure.
What makes this interesting from my perspective is that adding a remote
filter and second cooler actually BOOSTED pressure by 10psi not the
reverse which is the conventional wisdom. So in a never ending search for ever
better oil pressure, the next time around the choice will be an original VW
filter. DC
