Subject: Fuel line clamping

My friend Kevin ('85 Vanagon Weekender, wants another Westy) has found that
hemostats (the hospital kind) make great fuel line clamps.

This was after a trip to the hospital because gasoline poured into his ear
canal.

You can sometimes get them at flea markets, car shows, and, of course,
through medical supply stores.

BTW, I've heard that a partially empty or empty fuel tank is even worse than
a full one--the vapors will ignite more easily, and explode the tank.

Let's be careful out there.
(My wife laughs when she hears careful and my name in the same sentence)
