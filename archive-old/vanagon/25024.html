     Wagonworks on Rt. 1 South of Crystal City is the place for
     quality work. They did an outstanding job on my Audi, with its
     very difficult pearlescent white paint.

     Also, check back issues of Washington Consumer Checkbook, available at
     local libraries. Tthey do reviews of body shops every couple of years,
     rated for both quality and price.

Does anyone in the D.C. area know of a good auto body place.  I friend of
mine was rear-ended while driving her ghia, and my bus has few dents that
need fixing.  Thanks.
