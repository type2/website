Subject: Re: Weekly Statistics

&gt;I suggest that when any of us attend any gathering of Volkswagen owners that
&gt;we carry with us and display in some prominent place, a placard or sign
&gt;telling of the existance of the Vanagon list with easy instructions on how to
&gt;join, how to buy a computer, how to rebuild the 3/4 clutch hub of a late
&gt;model tranny, and other useful tidbits other Type II owners have been lusting
&gt;for.
        I can see easy, concise, single placard instructions for the
purchase of a computer, the rebuliding of a late model 3/4 clutch hub and
how to buy a computer. But how to jaoin the Vanagon list in clear concise
terminology that even purveyors of Muir can understand???   It'll never
happen.    ;-)

Peace,
