&gt; 
&gt; My power steering has quit on my '87 vanagon.  I don't see any leaks and
&gt; the reservoir is full.  Any ideas  ?  Pump  ?   Is there a warning  signal
&gt; 
&gt; Frank
Pump died on our '86 right after warranty expired, seems much the same,
no leaks but had seized and belt merely spun over the pully, got a
used one, Parts Place Inc. tracked it down from another yard and gave us
a very good deal, replaced it and the filter and no problems there were
a lot of metal shavings and we worried about the rack, but drained and
replaced all fluid, changed the filter again after about 1 month and it
worked goog till the van lost its life.
