  Thanks for the replies.  I'm currently travelling around and
about in my '75 westy.  It's been fun so far from SF to Phoenix
but I need to find a rider to keep me company.  If I stop long
enough to get a canvas sent out that'll be my next project.

  One thing I need to reair soon is the heating system.  I'm missing
a hose from the front heater junction (just behind to front tires)
the vent under the rear bench seat.  I've been looking for a long length
of flexible duct to no avail.  Is this supposed to be some particular
type of dutct or will anything work fine?  I found some flexible rubber
hose, but it would have to be carefully hung and doesn't seem durable..
