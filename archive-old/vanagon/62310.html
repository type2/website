Subject: 91 Vanagon Vent Wing Window!!!!

Does anyone have a clue why my 91 vanagon vent wing windows only turn 90
degrees therefor not allowing the wing to cool me down as they were designed
for. My old bug I remember used to turn 180 degrees and worked almost as good
as AC when the speed was right. Is this some new safety regulation?Beacause
if not it is really a stupid design and quite annoying especially out here in
the desert..
