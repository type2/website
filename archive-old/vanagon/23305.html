Okay, so it's dangerous if the flame were to go out while driving.  Is
it not also dangerous for the flame to go out while you are camped,
sleeping, during a storm?  I guess anything with gas and a flame is
relatively dangerous, driving or not.  One solution would be to get a
warning device that detects a gas leak, or lack of oxygen.  But if there
are so many risks, why are there so many three-way fridges in RVs?
Actually, a gas leak while driving is probably *less* serious than when
parked.  Why?  Because there is likely to be air moving through the
vehicle which will help disperse the gas, as opposed to it filling up
the inside of the van.  Comments?
