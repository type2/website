&gt; I have an opportunity coming up to travel for three months after
&gt; graduation.  I was planning on traveling from California (current
&gt; location) to Florida across the bottom of the U.S.  From there, I would
&gt; head north/northwest to Michigan.  Then west to washington, and finally
&gt; south back down to California, and home.
&gt; 
&gt; I will be traveling in a 1979 Westfalia.  I will be leaving at the end of
&gt; August and returning by Christmas.
&gt; 
&gt; Now for my questions:
&gt; 
&gt; 1.  Any areas I should definately hit along the way?
&gt; 
&gt; 2.  Suggestions for inexpensive camping?

&gt; 
&gt; Any suggestions, questions, or comments are welcomed and appreciated.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,

1)If possible, check out Zion and Mesa Verde National Parks. New Mexico
is very nice, too.
2)Rest areas are a great way to inexpensively take full advantage of
your Westfalia.
