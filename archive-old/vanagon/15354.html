Subject: '66 bus mirrors

          my '66 kombi came with almost rectangular mirrors but a
          little narrower at the bottom than the top.  they look very
          old in design as well as wear.  all the pics i see of this
          era show round mirrors on the type II.  the catalogs i have
          show round.  i purchased the same shape i got with the bus
          from whitney and they sucked,, big time!  the chrome looked
          very bad, if in fact it was chrome.  the ball and socket
          joint on the back of the mirror was loose so they wouldn't
          stay put and they couldn't be adjusted properly.  i sent
          them back and haven't bought anything else from them.
          anyone have an opinion as to what style mirrors were stock
          in '66 and where i might obtain a decent set of
          replacements?  my right side mirror has no finish left on it
          and is half filled with water and has been for four years.
          after a few months i marked it and it has changed one bit in
          four years.  i'm thinking of very small fish in there. at
          least a couple snails.  even in this florida heat it does
          not evaporate.  hell,i want new ones anyway.  you can't talk
          me out of it!    ray
