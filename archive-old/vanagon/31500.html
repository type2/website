Wild &amp; Crazy VW'ers,
Catch you all later.  I'm simply driving around my smushed '71 bus, hoping
the oil filter doesn't fall off, doing virtually nothing to it, not even
checking the oil, since opening the engine compartment exposes me to
splattered battery acid. Have some happy holidays.  I'll get back on the
list when I start putting the 78 x 90.5 back together.  

Eug,
oh for that collision insurance, '71 westie.  Anybody need a 1600 engine?
