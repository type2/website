Sure.  After tearing the whole thing apart, the switch was what was wrong 
the whole time.  It's suspicious, though.  The switch went bad because it 
got hot inside and melted.  Several of the switches in this van have had 
that happen to them....  I'm conjecturing that it was getting harder to 
turn the fan in the cold weather, so the current went up....???

&gt; no sign of coolant anywhere.  Is it possible that it's leaking and
&gt; evaporating that fast and only under pressure?  There was plenty of air in
&gt; the thing. 

I'd still like an answer to this question.  Does anyone have an opinion here?
I took the heater core in the house -- it was dry.  Hooked it up to a 
faucet and kept everything dry.  I ran hot water through it until it was 
good and hot and then plugged up the outlet.  There was no air or water 
coming from the core.  Is this a good enough test?  Was that enough 
pressure?  House water temperature is probably 120F.

Resting.  Back at it tomorrow.   I'm pleased because it really wasn't 
THAT hard to take the dash apart.  Just took some time.  I replaced the 
shear bolts on the steering with 8mm bolts.  Didn't use any sealant -- 
there wasn't any on the heater box in the first place, so I didn't think I 
should put any in.

All opinions and comments welcome.
