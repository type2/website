ferchrisake Ric,

Stop complaining abt. automatics: they shift when they should and are
recommended for towing!   OK,  the dogs invariably bump the shifter into N
when they move from back to front,  but there is a &quot;rev limiter&quot; in the
computer to prevent serious damage....

Happy New Year and have a good trip!

Moe ('93 EV auto, '92 GTI) (manual...)
