Well I still don't either, regardless of this fact I called in
an order today, wanted to get ahold of Jim to give him a piece
of my mind (though I can't spare much) but he was gone, got
Bill instead who was very apolegetic (been getting that for like
2 years now).  Anyway ordered about $100 in stuff for the '81
to prep for the big upcoming vacation run to Mount Rushmore,
Bill said that the 800 number has become the &quot;catalog complaint
line&quot; seems to me they'd take a hint at that.

I will say I could not have orderd all these things from
RMMW so Bus boys a good choice, prices about equal f.i.

VDO oil temp gauge about $30
sender $13
fuel hose $5.15/m (a bit more than RMMW)
vacuum hose $.95/ft (&quot;)
intake manifold hoses $2.50 each (why is WCM out of line on these?)

but the biggies new engine mounts all round really needed
thanks to PO mechanics reversal of support bar

RMMW does not sell
cost $10 and $13 each (much better than dealer or Recylcled Bugs)

Plus got my 10% list discount makes up the difference in prices
pretty much so I guess thumbs up again to Bus Boys, but 

GET THE DAMN CATALOG OUT TO EVERYONE ALREADY!!!

Oh and PS guys I can now get genuine rubber OEM VW CV boots
for $8 locally why do you guys still want more?  Was getting
the same polymer ones BB's sell for $7 but can't get them anymore
but for real VW instead I won't complain.  Same guy that gets
great price on Pentosin, Bosch filters etc.  I strongly rec
everyone check carefully their locale for small import parts
places who know their stuff.
