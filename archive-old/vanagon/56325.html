Scott C. thus said:

&gt;As an avid cyclist, there is a big debate over low cost mail order vs
&gt;mom and pop bike shops.  I see a similar problem with Ron's business.


I've been down this road before (on both sides of the fence,even) and
it pretty much boiled down to this...if it's a piece of hardware that
has no ambiguity and no chance of error (and a big enough cost diff
to cover S&amp;H vs. tax, it's going to (probably) be mail order.

You'll never catch me buying stuff like spokes and clothing, etc from
mail order for the reason Scott stated earlier.  I can also appreciate
a straight answer from someone who understands EXACTLY what I'm
talking about and charges a fair price to boot.  If you have all the answers
then mail order may be for you, otherwise, retail at the local FLAPS/
pro shop is a fair price to pay.  Just my opinion, of course.
