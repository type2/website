Subject: Emission Test Readings
Date: Thu, 23 Jan 1997 14:02:37 -0800

So I took our '87 GL to the Emisson Test Facility over lunch.  This was
my first ever trip to said facility not having owned gasoline car in 17
years.  I've now been a gasoline driver since of July!  Oh the
speed...the power!  Anyway...the  test revealed the following:
	
		Hydrocarbons	CO	CO+CO2
Limit:		220 PPM	1.2%	&gt;6.0%
Idle:	  	97 PPM		.01%	14.76%
3K rpms	18 PPM		.33%	15.19%

So needless to say I passed.  However, these readings are my only data
point.  Do you guys get similar readings?  Are these reasonable
readings?  Do these readings only indicate how well my emission controls
are working or are there any indications of engine problems.  Why does
one measure CO+C02?  Which way should a healthy engine trend?

Thanks in Adance Fellas!
