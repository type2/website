Subject: The end of the list

I just want to mention that I'm willing to run the list, but I'd need to
purchase a machine and software (LISTSERV) to host the list, which would
cost approximately $1500.00.  Bandwidth is not a problem... my site has a T1.

If folks on the list are willing to pony up an average of $3 apiece for a
host machine and the LISTSERV software license, I'll run the list.

Hello fellows,
    I for one am willing to pay the $3.00 or even up to $10.00 to preserve
the list.  It has saved me money many times, and am willing to pay a little
back.  I applaud Ron, the list management must be a Herculian task.  I feel
kinda cut off from other Vanagon owners here in Arkansas,  there are only 3
listees here.  I see one Vanagon a month on the average, on the highway.
I've only see one Syncro here in 4 years of looking.

     I call on all the listees to support the list. Its not as glamorous as
save the whales, but it hits closer to home.

THREE CHEERS FOR THE LIST, LONG MAY IT LIVE!!!!!!!!
