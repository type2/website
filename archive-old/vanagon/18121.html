&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;My wasserboxer motor is surging at idle. 
&gt;&gt; ...
&gt;&gt;The symtoms are constant surging between 900 and 1200 rpm after hot and at
&gt;&gt;at idle.  When driving all seems fine. &gt;&gt;

Your problem could be just improper idle adjustment. If the idle adjustment
is set to too high this surging symptom could happen.
