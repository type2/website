Subject: `66 electrical, `61 microbus dilemna...

Well, fixed my electrical problem on my `66...I (mumble mumble) kinda
(mumble) putthewiresonwrong. *ahem* Like someone pointed out. The new
box I got works beautifully, and is no longer a fire hazard. I heard
of a place that will rebuild said boxes: anyone know where?
  Next point of interest: I know of a `61 microbus for sale. (700.00/
pretty negotiable!) This is probably the most complete bus I have
ever seen! (Even has the (optional?) mercury gas gauge!) I always
wondered what went into that hole! Center seat, spoon latches on the
popouts, &quot;VW&quot; gas cap, etc. etc. And get this--the original 40hp
motor that came with the bus when purchased new! (This is the second
owner, motor rebuilt _at_about 75K.) This baby runs and drives like new,
(105K miles!) and purrs. No tranny problems. Battery box pretty gone,
light rocker rust. (I have the replacement panels from a failed
attempt at resurrecting a `63 micro, if anyone remembers.) Still 6V.
Aye, now here's the dilemna: he wants to trade my `62 bug for this.
My `62 bug isn't great, but is rust-free, has a 1500 I paid 75.00
for, has tranny problems, but is really straight. And runs pretty
good, but has a suspicious low vibration from the motor(?) when
it gets warm. The motor also has about 1/4&quot; of endplay. (But, hey,
75$ for an engine I've put 2-3K on so far?) It runs perfect on short
trips. Any advice/comments?
