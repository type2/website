&gt; Here's a puzzle for you.  let me set the stage.  i recently bought a '65
&gt; ucro deluxe. It has a 74 bug engine in it with about 5000 miles since
&gt; rebuild.  Acceleration was GA poor.  sort of had to pump it when shifting
&gt; low gears.  would cruise real well.  While waiting for a clutch cable, I decided to rebuild the 34PICT-3 carb.  I think the acceleration - stalling problem 
&gt; was due to a loose front nut holding the carb to the intake.  But i decided to
&gt; do the rebuild anyway.  Reinstalled, started up but ran Awful.  Like on three
&gt; cylinders.  Carb severely icing up (ambient temps 5oC).  Removed carb and 
&gt; noticed something missing.  What was it?  Ans. later

Just a guess.  Was it missing the idle cutoff jet?
