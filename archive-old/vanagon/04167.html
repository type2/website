&gt; if you kids don't stop this nonsense, i'm gonna start hitting you with 
stuff
&gt; like Choo-Choo-C'Boogie,  Boogie-Woogie Bugle Boy of Company 
B, When My
&gt; Dreamboat Comes Home, Glow-worm, Picnic, Poor People of Pairs, 
and other
&gt; wonderful renditions by truly Great Artists, as sadly mimiced on 
such shows
&gt; as The Hit Parade (that was back when television was a novelty!! 
and you had
&gt; to walk down to old man Moncrief's furniture store to see one). ha!
&gt; 
&gt; chuck berry, elvis presley! ha! buncha damn kids! what about the

I remember the 78's but why drudge up the past.  A little Fat's Domino 
is enough.  Who wants to remember the McGuire Sisters on Arthur 
Godfrey (sp?) .
