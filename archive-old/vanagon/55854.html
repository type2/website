-- [ From:  * EMC.Ver #2.3 ] --

Malcom,

I'm interested in both itineraries. Have you figured out the best way to
cross the Atlantic?  I'm told that there are carriers out of Halifax which
carry vehicles, but I'd had no luck getting information from Partnership
Halifax (WWW site) other than the phone numbers of a number of freighter
companies.  I've been told that all Volvos imported into the Northern
Hemisphere come by carriers out of Goteburg, Sweden, through Halifax, so I
suppose that there is a return passage opportunity to Europe as well as a
direct passage to Canada from Europe.

A ferry would provide the best situation, passage for the vehicle and
accommodations for the passengers. Crucero Express, between Panama City,
Panama and Cartegena, Colombia, has ceased operation, so that raises
serious obstacles for less than extremely rigorous crossing of the Darien
Gap.  The literature of travel is replete with accounts of the difficult
crossing of region except on foot, cycle or with 4-wheel drive vehicles.

Johan Nyberg, our list member in Sweden, is looking into the transport
question through his friends in the Swedish shipping business.

At least one of us should plan on going from Prudhoe Bay down.  It would be
great to do the whole spine of the world in one go.

Has anybody in Europe thought about doing a North Cape to Capetown run at
the same time.  At least there'd be a city at the end of the trip to
celebrate New Year's in.
