Subject:  electrical/convenience stuff

I recently got an Adventurewagen, and compared to a westy it is a little
sparse on the conveniences.  I think i would like to install a deep cycle
battery to power one of those electric cooler things (and other stuff),
and possibly charge the battery with a solar panel.  I have little
knowledge of electrical systems (other than what I learned in an EE
class long ago) and wondering if ther is a good resource book about
12V systems to get me up to speed.  I'm also wondering if anyone has
ever used one of those cooler things, and if there may be another
alternative (other than ice) for keeping my food and beverages cold on
trips. I have access to westy conveniences (sink, stove, fridge,cabinets)
from an 83, but I am thinking that trying to put them into my van may be
more than I can handle.  If it is easier than it seems, please let me know.

Thanks,
Matthew
