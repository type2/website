Subject: Repost :FS 1977 VW Westfalia



     I have a 1977 VW Westfalia pop-up camper in mint condition.
     This vehicle has been garage kept since 1977, has a sink, ice box,and
     sleeps 4.  Canvas and interior is in excellent shape. Paint looks like
     knew. This is a once in a lifetime find! I also have most of the
     records.
     If you are interested perhaps I could send a video.

     Asking $4,500           86,000 miles

     This would be great for &quot;dead heads&quot; or fisherman.

     If your interested please e-mail at:

     Thanks,
     Scott
