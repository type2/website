Subject: Calif. SB 42: Pray for no more smog checks!


California Vanagonatics:

I sent a note to Calif, State Senator Quentin Kopp, who sponsored
the Calif. bill exempting cars 25 years old and older, from the
state's stringent smoge checks. I asked him for the current status
of the bill. In response to my query, I received the following today.

 ---------

Dear Mr. Maher:

        Thank you very much for your letter expressing support
for my Senate Bill 42 which would exempt from the biennial smog
check requirement all vehicles 25 or more model years old.

        I believe that the relatively modest number of vehicles
older than 25 years and the operating characteristics of such
vehicles provide a firm basis for the smog check exemption
proposed in my legislation.  As I have stated on numerous
occasions, I will endeavor to ensure a fair, effective and
convenient smog check program.  I will need the support of like-
minded people such as yourself, because the Governor's Air
Resources Board announced its opposition to the bill, based upon
the contention it would eliminate potential removal of three
tons of air pollution per day.

        SB 42 was approved by my committee (the Senate
Transportation Committee) on January 21st, 6-0, and by the
Senate Appropriations Committee on March 17th, 7-1.  I presented
SB 42 to the full Senate on March 20th, and I am pleased it
passed unanimously, 33-0.  The bill will next be heard by the
Assembly Committee on Transportation.  The date has yet to be
announced.

       Once again, thanks for your interest and support.  If
you require additional assistance or information, just notify me
accordingly.

                                        Sincerely yours,

                                        QUENTIN L. KOPP
                                        &lt;Senator.Kopp_at_SEN.CA.GOV&gt;
