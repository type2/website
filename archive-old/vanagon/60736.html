Subject: 84 overheating


My 84 has started to overheat and I guess I should fix it before it 
become a bigger problem.  The temperature gauge sits right around the 
warning light when driving on the highway, but if I'm in town, the gauge 
is above the warning light and yesterday the light started to blink.  The 
fan wasn't on when I pulled over, so I suspect that maybe that switch is 
screwed up.  I called up a mechanic and he said it could be air in the 
system which also makes sense to me, especially when I turn on the front 
heat, I smell anti freeze (so there is place for the air to get in).

If someone who has had this problem or has any ideas would respond, I 
would appreciate it.


Blake
