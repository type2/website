Subject: Re: Rear License Plate Door, Vanagon

Hi Everyone.  Just a quick note... don't pull too hard on the oil 
fillter tube.  It may not extend.  When our van was new, it was 
missing the extension tube, and the assembly had to be replaced as a 
warranty item.

Harry.

&gt; Just remove the oil cap and pull on the neck of the tube. If at first you
&gt; don't succeed, keep pulling on it, and voila, the oil filler tube sticks
&gt; out of the access door behind the license plate.
