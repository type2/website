&gt; So, what I wonder
&gt; is is it really, REALLY necessary to have that rear mount?  Inquiring minds
&gt; want to know!

Well, when the bolts holding the back of my engine to the 
carrier broke, the engine sagged enough to drag the crank
pully on the carrier [couple of inches, anyway]. I would say
not a Good Thing, but I'm sure it's been done....
