Subject: Re: oil temps 200what?

For what its worth: a) the VDO gauge has 230F in the middle of their
gauge; 120 and 300 are on the outer most extremes. I would think that
gives a pretty good estimate of normal. b) the more important thing is oil
pressure in relation to oil temp (IMHO). Haynes states that oil pressure
should be a  minimum of 28psi at 2000 rpm when the oil is 180F.If this
value is obtained then doesn't it make sense that all pressures at higher
oil temps will be consistent with what the VW engineers intended?
(Assuming that temps do not exceed the point where oil no longer lubricates).
