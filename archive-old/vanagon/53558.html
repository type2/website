oh boy oh boy!! i put a lot of research into this back when i planned on 
restoring my 75 storage shed....unfortunitly my meomory doesnt work to 
bloody well. pht!

but, what i do remember!!

one method involves a UV-sensitive plastic that is injected into the hole 
or crack at high pressure, which is allowed to cure in sunlight for 
ohsolong, then polished up.

another one is a much cheaper version of the stuff that JCWhittney (and 
others) sell as a do it yourself kit, works ok, but doesnt last as long, 
and polishing it out with out the right tools can be a pain..

if you just want it to keep from spreading, slathering superglue in there 
works good..as long as you can do it without gluing your fingers to the 
winsheild...:)

there are a few other methods, but i dont remmeb\mber 'em..:( sorry..



now, if anyone wants to offer up their opions on polishing all levals of 
scratches out of glass (plastic too..:) they are welcome too..

i've got sratches to fix after the thaw on poor Itchi's windshield...not 
to mention my 400$ armani glasses!! (that due to good conections i was 
able to get for 145$..:) thank god, else i wouldnt have been able to get 
any, there for wouldnt have pased my drivers test...lol..:)


later...david
