Subject: SoCal Syncro for Sale (was RE: syncro)

I bought a syncro westie in Oregon last summer, while living 
in Washington DC. It worked out very well. 

I detailed the process on the list, as the situation developed.
Check the archives for messages under my name in July, August, and
September. 

Your best bet would be to find someone that has syncro experience
to check it out...there are qualified listmembers in the area , but 
they will have to volunteer themselves!

$25K? Much as I would like to see my syncro westie appreciate, this
seems high. But it is a used car lot, a Lexus dealer, no less, and
they probably make more money on used cars than the new ones. It took
me a month or so to get the used car lot where I found my vehicle to
realize they were not going to get their crazy asking price in the pickup 
country of Pendelton Oregon. 

There will be more competition for this one in Southern California...I 
would call a bank in the same town and determine the Kelly Blue Book 
prices, trade-in and retail. Presume they paid the trade-in value and 
offer a price that would allow them to make a grand or two off the 
transaction, but still below retail. If you can get if for retail,
you are doing OK, IMHO.

If you want a Syncro Westie, don't forget there is also one for sale
in New Mexico.

(inerest disclaimer)

Good luck,
