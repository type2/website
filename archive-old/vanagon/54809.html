Obviously, there is a lot of interest in more stickers.

Hopefully, you can order another batch in the near future.

Thanks.

&gt;NO! I don't have any stickers available right now, so please don't send an
&gt;order, unless you don't mind waiting a few months for more. It costs a few
&gt;hundred bucks to print a batch, and I am pretty much broke right now building
&gt;an engine. I'm not sure why the offer is current in the archives, but it's
&gt;definately not. I may do some in a few months, but in the meantime, Ken Hooper
&gt;has printed up some cool stickers of a different design. So, if you want some
&gt;of my design, just sit tight. In the meantime, to soothe that jones, buy a
&gt;couple from Ken. Here's all that info:
&gt;
&gt;The stickers are purple ink over chrome Mylar. The lettering resembles the
&gt;T-shirt and is &quot;reversed&quot;, so the stickers look purple while the lettering
&gt;looks silver. These have a coating over them to preserve the ink and keep
&gt;the chrome from being so glossy that it's obnoxious. Permanent adhesive,
&gt;they're designed to be mounted on the exterior lower left corner of your
&gt;rear window. Panel drivers will have to improvise.
&gt;
&gt;I said originally that these would be oval like the v_at_l stickers but it
&gt;looks like they'll be more circular instead. Take a look at the artwork and
&gt;you'll understand why.
&gt;
&gt;Stickers are $2 each, includes shipping in US.
&gt;
&gt;Here's the design:

&gt;Anyway, sorry about the confusion. I'll print up more eventually, but these
&gt;should hold folks til then...
