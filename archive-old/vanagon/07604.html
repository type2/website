Greeting fellow AirHeads,

I'm usually just a lurker here, but feel I must speak up after seeing some
of you slam grits.

 Now every region has some unique foods that others don't understand:
Australia has Vegamite (can you say axle grease?)
I hear some yankees put mayo and/or gravy on french fries (Eeeuuuuu!)

My girlfriend and I go out to breakfast every Sat. morning, and I always have
a whole-wheat biscuit, soysage (soybean sausage), yogurt-based gravy, and
CHEESE GRITS. Yummie!

I've also heard that if you have problems with ants in the kitchen,
sprinkle some grits around- they eat them, the grits swell, ants go pop.

Lovin' grits in North Carolina,
-gary
