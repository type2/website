&lt;&lt; Does anybody know if the mechanicals (ie. pedal assembly, shift linkage
 trans mounts, etc.) from an 82 Diesel will swap into an 86 Auto trans
 equipped Vanagon? The 86 has a blown engine and the 82 is rusty and beat
 up.

Sell the 82 and use the money torwards a good used engine for the 86!

just a suggestion,
