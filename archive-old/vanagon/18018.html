Subject:       broken wire survey!

How many of y'all have a drivers side speaker or electric mirror not 
working on their Vanagons?  I have an '85 and and '87 and both of 
them have broken wires (now fixed).  the '87 with power and heated 
mirrors had like 90% of the wires in the bundle broken.  Spliced in 
more length and fresh wire so we'll see how long that holds.  Maybe 
its a function of our balmy (-40 degree F) winters.  think VW has a 
Secret Warranty for THIS problem?  :)
