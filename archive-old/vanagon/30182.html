Subject: Re: Vanagon Idle Speed Problem

FWIW, the idle stabilizer was replaced twice (under

 YMMV.

&gt;  My questions are first, has anyone experienced something

&gt; did replacing the idle stabilizer valve fix the problem? 
Second, does it sound
&gt; like the idle stebelizer valve could produce this problem?
