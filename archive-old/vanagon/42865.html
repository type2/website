Subject: Westy for sale

ALL,

Not sure if this is taboo or not.  If so, ignore my ignorance.  But I am in
SoCal (LA) and am selling my 1980 Westy.
125k miles on van, 10k on new rings and pistons, 1k on new heads/valves,
many new mechanical parts($3500 worth).  Fair body/interior.   Runs strong.
Looking for $3800 for it.  Apologize if this is irritating.  Email
directly if you are interested.  TIA.
