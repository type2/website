Re pricing rant: In an interesting case a few years ago,  Mercedes-Benz
tried to stop North American busisnesses from selling parts for MBZ
vehicles, period. They didn't want any competition, whether the retailer
was selling same-source OEM parts, fenders from Taiwan, Belden spark
plug wires, etc. and applied the type of pressures that you might
imagine. Nobody's interests were well served in this case, and a Federal
court had to step in and tell them that that is not how things are done
in the US, at least. I used to work at Mitchell Manuals at the time, and
repair information was difficult to get from them for similar reasons.
Things have gotten much better since then.
