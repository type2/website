&gt;I don't know the proper nomenclature, I guess.  This thing was a Westfalia
&gt;pop-top, a full-width bench seat/bed in the back, Wofsburg logos, a
&gt;little removable refrigerator behind the passenger seat, and a funky
&gt;rear-facing seat behind the driver, with a storage compartment under it.
&gt;A table folds against the wall on the driver's side.
&gt;
&gt;So what is it?  Many others have this arrangement, with some reporting only
&gt;the studs left on the floor where the reefer went.

It sounds like either a &quot;base&quot; camper from 86 or 87, not a GL Camper.  I'd
bet it is either:
A. 1986 Camper Wolfsburg Edition, not a 1987.  
B. 1987 Camper that someone applied Wolfsburg Edition badges to.

1987 Wolfsburg Editions were not pop-tops and had a pair of rear facing
removeable seats behind the driver &amp; front passenger.  No &quot;storage
compartment&quot; part to these seats.  They did however have the folding side
table and &quot;aero-style&quot; fiberglass bumpers.  1990 &amp; 1991 Multivans had
interior arrangements like this but added the pop-top and a rear storage
cabinet.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;He's asking $7900, and the place is called &quot;Foreign Auto&quot; in Los Banos.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;The owner (Steve?) was real nice.

&gt;&gt; &gt;Westfalia Weekender??  If this has a poptop, rear bed/bench and two rear 
&gt;&gt; &gt;facing single seats it's a Multivan. Excellent choice, all the Westy
stuff
&gt;&gt; &gt;you need without the price!! Add a full kitchen later if you happen upon
a
&gt;&gt; &gt;deal. $7900 seems a bit high those repairs total $500 +/-.
 
&gt;&gt; VW didn't introduce the Multivan model in the USA until 1990.   Did they
have
&gt;&gt; them in Canada before that?
