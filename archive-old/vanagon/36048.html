So Veeduber_at_aol_dot_com says:
&gt; Another person opined that since ALL of my trips were disasters of one sort
&gt; or another, I should keep them to myself and not waste the bandwidth with
&gt; obviously trumped-up accounts.  

Sounds like someone needs to learn how to use there account better.

&gt; However, should the general feeling be that such trip reports as I've
&gt; submitted in the past are of no interest, I'll abide by the wishes of
&gt; electronic community of which I'm privileged to be a part and pull the plug
&gt; on the word processor.

Oh please.  Anyone who doesn't like trip reports and thinks they should
be banned is just being anal.  This group isn't just about the technical
aspects of VW-ing.  I consider your (Bobs) trip reports as real-life on
the road learning experiences.  Other trip reports cover places people
go and open up possibilities for others.  They're inspirational.  I
for one enjoy them both.  Isn't that what we got these buses for in
the first place?
