Subject:       pancake vs. up-right

I am not sure of the difference between a pancake
motor and the pre 1971 upright for the type II buses.
I have a 1971 camper. I have assumed upp until now that it is the 
1600 dual port motor.  The numbers on the motor do not match because 
it has been switched for one bred in mexico.

Ok, Ok I know this sounds naive,
and i have done some homework, also some reading, and have found some 
differences, fan in the back of the crank, low profile, to to many 
hoses, etc. but nothing how to identify the two by the crank case. my 
questions remains:

How would I spot a pancake motor vs. an upright motor if i was looking 
at the crank case broken down and the cylinders lying on 
a table next to it?

[Anybody know serious problems putting a 1973 1600 from a Bug on my 
1971 bus? I believe it also is dual port.]


thanks ahead of time.
