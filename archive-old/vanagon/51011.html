Subject: Re: Cost of Heater Core

&gt;         I called the &quot;VW dealer&quot; here in Traverse City, MI to check on the
&gt; cost of a rear heater core for my '86.
&gt;         When the parts guy got back to me he first apologized, I knew that
&gt; this was going to be bad news. Over $800!! We discussed the part, and we
&gt; agreed that that was what I wanted. It was NOT the whole box, just the
&gt; heater core.
&gt;         Wow.

Something's wrong here... I got mine replaced in March (dealer paid 
for it, as I had just bought the van). Just checked again - $258 CDN 
from VW dealer in Victoria. This works out to less than $200 US, so 
I'd call around a bit...

(ps: I'm assuming the '88 is the same as '86 )

'88 Westy (336k)
'85 Jetta TD (359k)
