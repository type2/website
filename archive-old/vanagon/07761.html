Subject:       &quot;quick&quot; question on buying a '72

Just kidding-- I know there's no such thing as a 'quick' question.  
Here's the deal:

'72 Camper, 56K miles, parked since 1985 and definately a tow-home 
job, red squirrels gotten into it, known exhaust problems
 but was running/being driven when parked, 
some perforation body rust ahead of rear wheels otherwise quite 
solid, totally oxidized paint, needs lots of TLC and fresh rubber 
parts.  Oh, its got AC (yuck) and a complete tent setup!  Is this 
worth $500?  What is it worth?  (this may be my Norton replacement, 
BUT no commitments yet)
