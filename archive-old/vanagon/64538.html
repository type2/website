Subject:      Re: Heat Exchangers replaced by VWoA

I suspect the guy that is replacing these boxes is applying too much
torque
&gt; to these small studs that are embedded in aluminum.  He should know better.
&gt;
&gt; A lot of people have said this guy is nice, and did a good job on their
&gt; bus, but I am not happy with the &quot;work&quot; he did to my bus.  ....
&gt;YMMV but if this guy is going to work on your bus I'd suggest keeping an eye
&gt;on him or volunteering to do the swap yourself.  I sure wish I had.

Question .......Is there only one person doing these replacements or are
there several ?

Maybee this would account for the discrepancy in the reports on the
quality of work performed!

Does anyone have the name of the person (or persons) doing the work?
