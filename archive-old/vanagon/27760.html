Just an update with my experience with the slip-on white walls.

The front wheels look fine, but the backs &quot;rippled&quot; - I think from the
massive amounts of torque produced by my fire breathing 1600 single
port :)

Anyway, one of the rears gave up the ghost tonight.  It started to separate 
from the rim, so I yanked it, although part of it is still under the bead :(

next time I'll go with _real_ whitewalls...
