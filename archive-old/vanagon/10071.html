&gt; Subject: RE: Inline Heaters
&gt; Chris Chubb wants to draw air from under the back seat, warm it, and blow
&gt; it back into the interior.  Chris, regarding getting benefit of blower and
&gt; engine fan, check out a Porsche 911's system (74-77 at least). They take
&gt; air pressurized by the engine fan, bring it through the electric blower 
&gt; whether the blower is on or off, then split it to send it to the two heat
&gt; exchangers.

Sounds like they use the engine fan to boost the electrical fan.
Mignt be possible, but I dont have a lot of room between the
fan outputs and the heater inputs. (1600 DP)

I was mostly wondering where the tubing for the fan would be run to go 
from under the back seat to the sides of the engine compartment.
There isa gas tank in there (making me squeemish about running a
saber saw to cut the holes) and not a lot of room.

What kind of fan would give me the most draw? A tube style
inline fan or a squirrel fan? (And some nice, homestyle registers
in the cardboard for the air intake)
