&gt;Eurobago (1995) Hits and Misses:
&gt;Please add your own comments!
&gt;
&gt;After travelling for the first time in our Eurobago we made
&gt;comparions between the German and US converted Eurovan.
&gt;
&gt;Hit:  Increased interior room makes it very comfortable compared
&gt;to the smaller eurovans.  There is still 2.5 feet to walk around
&gt;with when the bed is down.
&gt;

I know. in the winter rains it was particularly nice - there's actually
room to sit in there all night if you have to.

&gt;Miss:  Stupid Norcold fridge wouldn't work on propane.  It would
&gt;also drain the auxiliary battery in an hour or so.  The german
&gt;eurovan's fridge we have run for days on the battery.
&gt;

Another problem with the fridge. I must just be lucky. Were you at
altitude? Or would it simply not ignite?

&gt;Miss:  Water system.  The pump is turned on by a switch and then
&gt;a knob is turn on at the sink to allow the water to flow.  This
&gt;means the pump is on when no water is being used and the pump
&gt;seems to be louder than before.  Plus, you can no longer see the
&gt;water tank.  It is hidden under the closet.
&gt;

My pet peeve as well. I *hate* that pump. Switch is stupid. They're
replaced it with on-demand system in '97 model. Eventually maybe
I'll get one from West Marine and replace it myself.

&gt;
&gt;Biggest miss:  The loss of a dream.  It is symbolized by the
&gt;stupid fridge.  It seems like you are suppose to plug your van
&gt;when camping losing the sense of self-sufficiency.  May be once
&gt;the fridge is fixed we will feel better about this.
&gt;
once you're on propane the fridge is fine. in the winter, to run the
furnace for any length of time you might need to recharge the battery
every day.

I'd highly recommend you get a copy of the Winnebago Service Training
Manual - it will help understand how furnace works better, has some
troubleshooting info for appliances, and is relatively cheap. Part
#701674-18-000.

Also do you want your comments up on the EV page?
