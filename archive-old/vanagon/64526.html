Paul,
&gt;From what I can gather, this seems to be a universal problem with aging
Vanagons. Everyone I personally know with one has dealt with the same thing
at some point or another. When mine went out, about 3-4 yrs ago, my 5 cent
cure was to use a foam ear plug ( easy to put in and take out). I did that
for about 2 years till I finally found a good one at a junk yard. If there
was a way to dissasemble the latch mechanism, you could replace the
U-shaped spring and be done with it. But alas, VW in it's infinite wisdom,
made it a replace only item...
Good Luck,
Bob Bellanca

&gt;
&gt; While on this topic I might as well ask if anyone has any advice on how
to
&gt; fix the the inside lock.  The piece that you push up to unlock the door
won't
&gt; stay in the up position, making it impossible to leave the door unlocked.
&gt; Granted this isn't a big deal. The PO stuck a wire nut in the hole when
he
&gt; wanted to keep it unlocked, however, it would be nice to have it work the
way
&gt; it is supposed to.  Oh yeh, I don't think that it makes any difference,
but
&gt; just in case.  It's an 81 Westy.  Thanks in advance.
