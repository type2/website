Where's the spark come from? If it is the generator, it's been my 
experience that the things are kinda hard to get out even with the engine 
_out_. I imagine (and have heard) that it's possible to do it with the 
engine in, but I would rather take the 20 minutes (OK, you're a 
beginner--half an hour) to pull the engine and have all the space I need.
