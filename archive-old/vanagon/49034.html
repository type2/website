Subject: 1980 Vanagon

I have a hypothetical question...
Suppose I had a 1980 Vanagon that was mechanically very sound. This bus
would have the gas heater. It would have the weekender interior from a 1985
Vanagon installed. It is not a camper. It would be painted with a western
theme including in Roy Rogers rope style letters... &quot;Roger Bellow and the
Drifting Troubadours&quot;.  It would still need some surface rust repair, but
has never seen road salt so had no rust beneath. All of the brakes would
have been replaced including the master cylinder. 

Mind you, this is a hypothetical question... what would this vehicle be
worth if I were to sell it?
