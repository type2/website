Ok.  I've said it before, but it's been a while.  Discussions about what
belongs on the list do not belong on the list.  Please discuss VW Vans --
fixing, driving,  buying or selling -- on the list.  If you have something to
say about the running of the list or what belongs on the list or how the list
should be configured or how to subscribe or unsubscribe or whether the list is
up or down or any of that, please send it to me or to the person you have to
say it to. 

Don't discuss it on the list.

Thanks.

P.S. Fridays are for light humor that is VW related.  Not for inflammatory
political discussion.  Got a poem or a story?  That we like.  Got a gripe or
axe?  Keep it to yourself or send it to me personally.
