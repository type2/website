Indeed!  The manufacturers of the tire know what the safe limit of their tire
is, don't exceed that or you're asking for trouble!  What's more, I suspect
they wouldn't be too sympathetic when you take it back after the blowout!
(&quot;Well, I know it only said 32 lbs on the side of the tire, but on the car it
said 48, so I followed what the car said... why'd this tire blow?!?&quot;)
