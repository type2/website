Subject: free '58 bus

I knew that would get your attention!  I saw this the Frederick
Hansson's VW for sale page:

-----------------
To GIVE to good home:
1958 BUS, pretty rough but would make a good project van for someone low 
on bucks. I don't
want to send this old soldier to the crusher! No engine but has clear 
title. Will someone have pity
and bring a trailer to Stillwater, Oklahoma. I'll even help you load it 
up! Please call 405-372-7179
evenings or e-mail duck_at_pp.okstate_dot_edu
(Jan 16) 
----------------

The race is on!
