Chris--

The dealer just replaced that coolant hose right?  You might just have
an air bubble that's fooling the coolant sensor.  Try bleeding the
system a little (in a pinch add plain water, but try to find some good
antifreeze--phosphate free--to add the proper mixture in if necessary).
Since you haven't done this yet, I presume, here's how.  Get somewhere
where the front end is about a foot or so higher than the back (the
higher the better).  Start the engine up and let it get good and warm
(normal operating temp.).  If you remove the grill in the front you'll
see the radiator.  On the top left as you look at your beloved van,
there is a screw to loosen to bleed the system of air.  Loosen it, now
the tricky part if your by yourself.  You need to keep the engine
revving, have the heat on full blast and watch the screw until you stop
seeing little air bubbles escaping.  And keep an eye on the coolant
level in the back.  If you have some big air pockets, you may have to
stop the engine and refill the rear and then continue.

I experienced similar troubles that were rooted in the coolant temp
sensor that goes to the brain.  After I replaced the sensor, it
continued to act this way for 1 or 2 days until all the air escaped.  If
it continues to trouble you, it may be the sensor.  For an 87, the cost
is only $12 or so and very much a do-it-yourselfer.

Good luck,
Tonya
