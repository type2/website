Subject: Has anyone R&amp;R'd the distributor in a sy


Hi Volks,
My desire to tinker with my van continues......
Since the monroe shocks didn't work out (suggestions for reasonably priced 
BOGE's?), I now want to work on the ignition system since it really isn't 
running smoothly and my local mech scoped it and found some problems he 
relates to the distributor, especially since the whole mechanism has play in 
the shaft running to the engine.

Has anyone replaced the distributor assembly in a 2.1 syncro digifant? 
 Where  did you get your part?  I got a quote for a rebuilt bosch unit from 
Trak Auto for ~$176.  Sound in the ballpark?  The local mech quoted me $600+ 
for  a new unit.

The van has 135kmi on it.  Checked with good compression, new bosch wires 
and platinums.  I just don't feel like I've been spending enough money on it 
after replacing the tranny in november 95 and the starter in march 96  :-)

Thanks,

relax and spin
