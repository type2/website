Subject: Re: A wrecking yard in the Seattle area.

&gt;Just went to see what the Woodinville Auto auction was all about,
&gt;and saw a couple of neat things; a 1979 bug convertible, a 1974 Thing,
&gt;a couple of mid-70's bugs, and a 1976(?) westy to be sold this Saturday.
&gt;  Anyway, when I'm in a new place, I kinda like to cruise around and
&gt;see what all's there, and I stopped at a place called Gerry's foreign
&gt;auto parts, ltd. They had quite a few busses/bugs from all eras, including
&gt;a couple of vanagons (An `84, and a 8?), a `59 micro, a `62 single cab,
&gt;(Driver's rear all smashed. :( Or I might have considered it.) A relatively
&gt;complete 1976(?) westy, amoung other things. I guess I looked like a
&gt;criminal, as they had to have someone escort me through, and I didn't
&gt;get that good of look at anything. Oh, also a `59 ghia, and a `61.
&gt;They seemed kind of pricey to me, but YMMV.

good to hear of more wrecking yards with type II's in them. May i make one
suggestion though- mellow on the acronym's! the minute i think i have a
complete handle on acronym's a new one is invented (i.e. YMMV). Now i have
to ask what is this new acornym!
