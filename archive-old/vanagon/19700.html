Subject: Re: Is my engine a type IV?

&gt; Lisa Quinn asks:

&gt; Hi all! I am confused. I have an '81 westy with a 2.0L fuel injected
&gt; air cooled engine. Is it a type IV? If it is a type IV, will parts
&gt; like heat exchangers listed &quot;for all type IV&quot; fit my engine?
&gt; Thanks in advance!!
&gt; Lisa
&gt; 

 Well, yes and no. Your engine is a type IV by design but there are a few   
 variations that prevent everything fitting everything. Heat exchangers are
 one of the variations. The heads used up until 1979 are called &quot;round port
 heads&quot; and the heat exchanger pipes extend up inside the head and seal with
 a copper &quot;ring&quot;. Head from 1979 on &lt;sometimes referred to as &quot;vanagon heads&quot;
 or &quot;square port heads&quot;&gt; have a flat sealing surface  for the heat exchangers
 and use a more conventional gasket. I think it is necessary to get the 
 correct heat exchangers for the type of head you have.

 Be a little wary of the &quot;fits all type IV&quot; phrase. There are CARS &lt;the VW
 411 and 412&gt; which are the true type IV. They are the original &quot;hosts&quot; of 
 the type IV engine, which subsequently spun off into the bus and the Porsche
 914-4. If the remark &quot;fits all type IV&quot; was applied to heat exchangers, that
 would indicate to me that they are early type &lt;round port&gt; since the 411 and
 412 were long since dead and gone before the heads were changed to square 
 ports. 

 This &quot;type&quot; stuff is always confusing.
