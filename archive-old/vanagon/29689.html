&gt;&gt;however, i think the alternator or regulator is shot.  if you remove the
&gt;positive wire from the battery, engine dies right away. 
&gt;  =====================
&gt;Brandy:
&gt;Lifting the alternator lead to the battery when the engine is running is a
&gt;significant NO-NO !!!!!!!!  It can generate significant voltage spikes that

hmm, well i detatched the only cable from the positive battery post, i
assume this is the same thing (there is no wire directly from the
battery to the alternator).  when i am in the middle of nowhere what
is a good way to see if my alternator is no longer working?  in the
bently manual it shows how to test an alternator, but i don't have an
ammeter, or a switch to isolate the battery or a variable resistance
doo-hickey.  is there anyway i can tell if my alternator is shot with
just a VOM.  

troubleshooting on the field so to speak is a slow process for me, man
of little (but growing:) knowledge, so any advice would be great.  

thanks,
	brandy
