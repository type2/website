&gt; Finally, has anyone ever driven a VW van of any vintage on the Autobahn?
&gt; My only reservation in getting one over there is that it will be *way*
&gt; underpowered to the point of being unsafe.

Don't worry, the speed limit for trucks on the Autobahn is 80 kph (50 mph)
so if anything you will be doing a lot of passing.  Just be very careful
before pulling into the left lane to pass on two lane autobahns.
