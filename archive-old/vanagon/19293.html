On Sat., 6/17/95, David Mancuso signed off with:

&gt;'87 Wesfalia (The Great White Appliance), 11th in a series of VWs

David, David, David,.....

If you were on this list last summer (and I suspect you weren't) you would
recall that there was a discussion of what made this list special, and why
there wasn't something along the lines of &quot;chryslershitbox_at_lenti.med.umn...&quot;

Anyway, the world according to Joel, is divided into people who consider
their vehicles &quot;appliances&quot; (that would be the minivan crowd), and those
who consider their rides something on a higher plane (that would be us).

Perhaps &quot;The Great White Brick&quot; or something like that might be forthcoming 
:-)
