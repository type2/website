Subject: &lt;Syncro/all&gt;  fender lip rubber

Hi all,

Got a note from Tom Nischk, (sent to gerry.etc too) on rubber fender
extensions like you see on TriStars (and Jeeps).  Dealer here has the
listing/price no problem.  Cash flow is serious.


left front upper 251 853 717 or 717A  $213
rite front upper 251 853 718 or 718A  $213
left front       251 853 719 or 719A  $162
rite front       251 853 720 or 720A  $162
left rear        251 853 817 or 817A  $237
rite rear        251 853 N/A    818A  $336
                                    -------
                            Total =  $1313Cdn (~$1K US) + taxes


#'s with A on end are for 14&quot; rimmed vans, without are 16&quot;.  The 16&quot;
version requires a 6&quot; long sawzall trimming of front lip, near rear down
ward leg. Don't know why no 818 listed?  Don't know why it costs more
than 817 either  But for these prices who cares anyhow.  

bye, Tim
