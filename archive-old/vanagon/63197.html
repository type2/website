Subject:      Weight of 2ltr air-cooled engine ???

I have a '81 transporter with a 1973 cc aircooled engine.

For repair I would like to remove the engine ( just the engine,
not the transmission !) from under the vehicle and bring it
to my garage. This shouldn't be too difficult according to the
manual. I wonder if it is possible carrying the whole thing
with two people into a car and mounting and remounting it using
a simple hydraulic jack. What is the weight of such an  engine  ??


                        Any tips:     Ger de Graaf.
