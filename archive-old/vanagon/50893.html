Subject: Dream Trip-day jaunt in Mexico

Hello All
        The ultimate dream trip has got to be a ride from the central
highlands of Mexico to the Pacific coast.  I have actually driven this once
in a 94 Mexican model 'baywindow' which is factory watercooled, powered by
a modified Rabbit engine.  If you start somewhere in Michoacan (Lake
Patzcuaro or higher) go through the Balsas, and come out on the coast
between Lazaro Cardenas//Zihuatanejo you will have encountered every major
type of ecological zone that is present in Mexico (2100 meters asl+ to sea
level).  It takes from 6-8 hours but is best done in a couple of days.
It's two lanes most of the way some of which is harsh switch backs with
awesome drop-offs (severe penalties for falling asleep at the wheel).  Here
is the basic itinerary

Start at Lake Patzcuaro, having spent at least a day driving around the
lake, snapping photos, dodging buses on the dirt one-track at the north
side of the basin, and hiking at Chris's 'magi-spot' (or a couple of days
mountain biking on burro trails for the truly adventurous).

Day one --head towards Uruapan on [rt 14] stopping to see the
archaeological zone at Tingambato on the way.  Have lunch in Uruapan, hang
out, have fresh fruit, or spend the night.  Takes you from the sierra to
something akin to subtropical, huge drop in elevation, air will feel like
soup.

Go on from Uruapan to Nueva Italia [rt 37].  This town is essentially a
huge truck stop, but depending on how long it takes to get here, this may
be where you spend the night.  This section of road is truly incredible,
huge dissected canyons, arid plants, and it is just starting to get way
hot.

The section from Nueva Italia to the coast [rt 37] is where your vehicle
and your driver will earn their mettle (and all those Pina Coladas slurped
up on the beach).  Here you go through the Balsas river valley which is
essentially desert.  100+ temps, arid/arid/arid/, and the only people you
will see be will lolling in the shade on a very comfortable hammock.

After Arteaga you will ascend the coastal range (Sierra Madre del Sur) and
descend onto the coastal plain.  This is two-lane switchbacks all the way,
starting in desert, and changing to tropical at the summit when you leave
the rainshadow behind.  You can stay at Arteaga (another truck stop), which
is just before you ascend the coastal range, if you become bogged down for
time.  From the summit to the coast is all downhill, second, gear,
switchbacks, with glimpses of the coast at every break.  At the bottom you
take rt 200 to either Playa Azul and points north or to Zihuatanejo and
points south.

You can also do this trip on the train, which you can pick up in Mexico
City, Patzcuaro, Uruapan, or Lazaro Cardenas.  You can take the bus at
Lazaro anywhere.  I have done this as well, it cuts down on the switchbacks
for those who get motion sickness.

Well, there it is, I'm getting excited just thinking about it.  will be
doing this trip in January, in a Mini-van, not a bus unfortunately.  Of
course to get to Patzcuaro and the beginning of this short jaunt you have
to go through lots of Mexico as well (at least two days worth) -- what a
bummer.

Thinking of fresh seafood

Chris
