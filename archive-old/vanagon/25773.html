Subject: Re: Antique Criteria

In Missouri the vehicle has to be 25+ and there is a one-time fee of 
$25.  No annual inspections, but you are limited on mileage and where you 
can drive it (parades, to shows, to repairs, 500 mi/year limit [I think], 
not more than 150 miles from home [again from memory, which is faulty]).  
You are *supposed* to keep a log of your travels.  I use it primarily to 
make the Busses in the back yard exempt from local &quot;junker&quot; laws (much to the
neighbors' chagrin). ;-)
