Subject: Results from a compression test.

I finally got around to giving my '77 westy a compression test.  I took it 
off the road in December due to a steady loss of power (it was maxing out
at around 5 mph in the end).  The compression test read 110# for cylinders
1 and 2.  0# for cylinders 3 and 4.  I must say that a while back (in time
not miles) the previous owner had a shop give it a tune up where they got the
compression to go from approximately 0# in cylinders 3 and 4 to 50# with a 
valve adjustment.  Well back to my compression test.  After squirting oil in
the cylinders, there was no increase in compression.  I have some ideas of what
is wrong, but I would like to have &quot;your&quot; expert opinions on what the trouble
probably is and what I should do to correct it.  
	I know very little about the history of this bus but it does have
a 2 liter FI engine (I think it is the original).

Thanks, 
Brett

PS.  When checking oil level I noticed what appears to be an incredibly fine
metal particles in it.  It sort of has a matallic glint to it.  I can feel no
grittyness in it though.  I don't remember seeing any metal on my last oil 
change only 700 miles ago.
What gives?
