&gt; Working with my 87 &amp; 91 Vanagons I've been surprised how sensitive
&gt; they are to slight changes in ignition timing. After timing a
&gt; replacement engine &quot;by the book&quot; (5 deg. BTDC) one car had terrible
&gt; low-end response, feeling very dead when starting from a stop until
&gt; the engine hit over 3000 rpm.

With help from the list, I did a complete tune-up this weekend on my
'84 Vanagon (with DigiJet). Let me first say that it was so much
easier to do than on my other car, a Saab. The Bentley manual states
that one must FIRST set the timing, then the idle speed, which seems
backwards to my experience, but, alas, I did so. The list members
comments were precise.

I used the 5degree ATDC mark, and the engine settled down very nicely.
It now idles very well and steadily. I then set the idle, and the
engine runs very well, especially when revving up.

I know the '86 and up buses had the DigiFant injection which I think
is much more sensitive. My mother in laws '89 Golf always ran poorly
with the symptoms you state above until she found a VW mechanic god in
northern PA who set everything up correctly. He also made her always
use 89 octane or more (not regular 87 octane, but &quot;plus&quot; or
&quot;premium&quot;). That was 180K ago, and since then she has had no problems
(except for hitting three deer...).

You might want to check the vacumn hoses throughout the engine
compartment. There are quite a few. My buses DPO used windshield
washer hose on most of the connections, and it fit very loosely. After
redoing all the connections with the proper lines, the engine ran much
better. Then, after the tune-up, it really started to run well.
