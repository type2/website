Good question.

On my first try, I did indeed transmit the bashing up into the subframe and
subsequently bent a localized area a little bit.

So on my second try, I added a hand sized plate to distribute the load. I
now recommend this.

So now if I bash too hard, I'll distort a larger area of my frame so that
won't be so bad.

Wait, is there something wrong my my logic here?

I am thinking that it is an easy thing to reinforce the frame at that point
by means I have already started, but no, I am much happier now than before.
I cannot imagine off-roading my syncro without having reinforced the
subframe at the midpoint, since after only a few trips, the subframe would
be up against the muffler, and would then transmit horrible sounds into the
van interrior.

The driveshaft protection rails should also be supported at their midpoints
with little pieces of angle iron up to the regular frame of the vehicle.
This way, you can put real weight on those driveshaft rails (driving over
dirt humps) without fear of bending them.

&gt;
&gt;Derek,
&gt;Are you concerned that this will just transmit the &quot;bashing&quot; load to the
&gt;frame (body? there's really no traditional frame) and cause more expensive
&gt;damage than just to the  subframe?
