Subject: Found one!  Need advice!

Hi all,
	Thanks to everyone who has sent me mail about finding a van for 
my family ( full camper, seats 7 etc...).  I am sending an accompanying 
mail message that explains what I decided on for camping stuff.  

Till then I need some tips on what y'all think about the actual VW Van we 
found:

86 Vanagon GL, 2.1L, 4spd, 110k, Engine Rebuild (new heads) this past 
July (Guy did it himself though), Exc shape, New clutch, new alternator, 
beige/gold, original owner, PS, AC, No rust, minor dings--nothing odd for 
11 years old, New CV joints, Has met all recalls, Fold down bed, 7 
seater, no pop top, no camping equipment, $3900.
 
	Original owner and he has ALL documentation (even including the 
original sticker!).  This guy appears to be a real do-it-your-selfer.  
Used to be a mechanic and has kept up the vehicle.  Selling because older 
&amp; kids have moved away--wants something smaller.  Also think he has itch 
for a new vehicle.

	Any suggestions?  My wife is concerned about an 11 year old 
vehicle being our primary vehicle.  
	Any concerns with the 86 model?  We'll be in Germany remember for 
the next 3 years so parts and maintenance will be available.  
	Seems pretty good to me but remember I'm new at this.  It drove 
great and has been in central CA its whole life.

	Any info would be appreciated.  Thanks again...Thad
