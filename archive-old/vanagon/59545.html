&gt; I just want to mention that I'm willing to run the list, but I'd need to

&gt; If folks on the list are willing to pony up an average of $3 apiece for a
&gt; host machine and the LISTSERV software license, I'll run the list.

I'm game...3 bucks apiece isn't much to ask to keep this list going.
Of course, not to belittle the work that it takes to run it...thanks
for all you've done, Gerry!
