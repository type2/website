&gt;Hi y'all.  I've been looking for installation infor, and parts required for
&gt;adding auxillary battery under driver's seat, as mentioned in my owners
&gt;manual of 89' Westy.  I've also noticed that there's mention of aux. bat. in
&gt;large Bentley for this year.  It has wiring diagram, showing routing, but I'm
&gt;dumb to this, and would like to find step by step proceedure required.  Too
&gt;many times, I've had to jump start because I didn't realize that stereo might
&gt;be on low, or whatever.   I carry jumpers, but the aux battery seems like the
&gt;perfect solution..    Any know-hows out there, or directions of who to
&gt;contact for what I seek?  Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Take a look in the battery compartment under your driver's seat. Many
Westy's came from the factory wired to accept an aux battery. Look for a
relay (silver or black cube about 1&quot; by 1&quot; by 1&quot; with several electrical
terminals). If you have one of these (as did my 87 Westy) all you need is
the proper battery, a ground strap, and a bit of wire and crimp-on
connections. If you have this setup, email me and I'll detail what I did to
install an aux battery. Note that the factory setup for the aux battery will
only supply power to your fridge and cabin light. You'll have to run an
additional power line to your dash to power your radio if you want it on aux
power. The fridge will deplete the battery in two or three hours. Still, an
aux battery does provide backup security in the event your main battery
croaks. But to start your engine with the aux battery, you'll have to jump
it to the main battery.
