&lt;&lt; I own a 81 Westy and was wondering if anyone knows the reason for the tan
 paste that forms on the inside of my oil cap.  It seems to me I read
 something bad about this years ago in Consumer Reports, in an article on how
 to buy a used car, however, I don't remember what it said.  Is this a big
 problem?  &gt;&gt;

Oh No!!!!  It's the &quot; '76-'82 Creamy Goo&quot;  thread now rearing it's ugly head
again on the V_at_L!!!!!
