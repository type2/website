&lt;&lt; Anyone had one of these done? &gt;&gt;
Frank I had this done to my 84  10 years ago and it has held since.It is a
good idea to have it checked to make sure the tires track w/ the front and
the camber is correct.It helps the handling too.Do not do it on a brand new
car though.It must settle first.
