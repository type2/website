&gt;&gt; Hello...I'm a 15 year old who is interested in VWs.  What I am &gt;&gt; planning 
on doing is buying a car in bad shape and then fix it &gt;&gt;up....

You forgot to mention where you live as this will probably determine the 
quality of your &quot;bad shape&quot; bus.  One is bad shape from southern CA probably 
wouldn't come close to one rusted into the ground in upstate NY.  I would 
recommend purchasing a running vehicle, one where the mechanics are good but 
maybe with cosmetic damage.  I say this because you may not be prepared for 
the expense of fixing the vehicle mechanically.  You can always fix cosmetic 
stuff as time goes on, minor body work, paint, etc.  The ones with sinks and 
beds are campers, most made by Westfalia.  These will cost you a bit more.  
Don't be overwhelmed by all the &quot;neat stuff&quot; inside and ignore the blue smoke 
coming out of the engine. I would probably recommend a breadloaf bus '68 to 
'79 as these are cheaper to fix than a Vanagon.  Replacing the entire exhaust 
system on a Vanagon costs anywhere from $350 to $1000.  The radiator alone is 
$300.  If you get a pre '72 bus you'll have a 1600 cc beetle motor in it that 
is very inexpensive to replace and/or repair. 
	Go to a bookstore and buy a book called &quot;How To Keep Your Volkswagen Alive 
For the Complete Idiot&quot; by John Muir (sp.?).  Not only is this a good book for 
repairs it has a very good chapter on buying a Volkswagen.
