Subject: 84 GL Exhaust System

I need to replace everything.  Front, back, connector, catalytic, muffler 
and pipe.  I've priced the dealer and would rather buy a nice used car.  
I've checked the Parts Place in MI and still find them high (plus have heard 
one bad story about their exhaust components).  Now I'm thinking of having a 
muffler/exhaust shop be creative and just put to-gether some pipes hook it 
all together and see if it works.

Anybody with a more solid solution?
