My brother is always giving me a hard time about my vanagon and its &quot;cab
forward&quot; design, he says they have &quot;just enough sheet metal in front to
break the wind&quot;

&gt; point well taken...but, of course, by definition of the WORD...&quot;cab
forward&quot;
&gt; i'd say my cab just aint gonna get no farther forward..:)
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; then there is the wonderful dodge stratus..i think...that advertises the 
&gt; wide stance bit....now, not saying vw invented it, or even had it &lt;i.e, 
&gt; early bsses.:)&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; but i'l be DAMNED if it took 'em this long to figure it out.
&gt; 
&gt; gee...wider, lower, hmm...less prone to roll in tight corners, therefore 
&gt; all 4 tires hold even traction and hold the road better.......
&gt; 
&gt; of course, not saying that they never came up with anything good, either,

&gt; although off the top of my head i cant quite think of anything...:)

&gt; &gt; No disrespect but by Chryslers definition the rear engined buses are
not 
&gt; &gt; cab forward.  BUT...
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Cab forward is the engine mushed as far forward as possible with the 
&gt; &gt; wheels moved to the corners.  
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Older buses had the engine obviously not pushed forward and the wheels 
&gt; &gt; were not as far to the corners as possible.  Lets though look at the 
&gt; &gt; newer VW buses.  Well engine is mushed as far forward as possible. and 
&gt; &gt; the wheels are pegged to the corners.  SO the EV is cab forward.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Lookj at the slope of the hood on the various vans and minivans.  EV is

&gt; &gt; the sharpest rake of any non-rear or non-mid engined bus.

&gt; &gt; &gt; yeah!! i rememrber that one now...
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; i was watching the Chrysler minivan commercial, andit said something 
&gt; &gt; &gt; about &quot;more interior space &quot; than (posssiblpy said) any car in its
class 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;due to its cab forward design&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; i started screaming at the TV of course...i tend to do that these
days..
&gt; &gt; &gt; told the TV that hy ol' 69 has more interior space than it, with its
REAL 
&gt; &gt; &gt; cab forward design..and that my 75 has even more, with its total
lasck of 
&gt; &gt; &gt; interior...and roof...hmm...i think i was just in one of those moods,
ou 
&gt; &gt; &gt; know?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;They've &quot;invented&quot; the following so far....
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;-&quot;Ch**sler - We invented the Minivan&quot;   (a.k.a. the sh*tbox)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;- &quot;Ch**sler - We've thought of everything&quot; Introducing our
revolutionary
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;concept
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;of  dual sliding doors on a van  (what a breakthru concept!!!)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;-&quot;Autostick transmission&quot;   Duh, there's a first.....
(Hmm....weren't they
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;ones who also came out with that push button auto trans? looks
like that one
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;was
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;a real winner too)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;-a (sorry excuse for a) Pickup truck with 3 doors....(or was that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;chevr-oilet?)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;can anybody else think of any more of their &quot;inventions&quot;??
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A BIG one!!  With the introduction of the Intrepid/Vision/&amp; the
Chrysler
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; model I can't remember the name of, the touted their breakthrough
design
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; inovation of:
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;                   &quot;Cab-Forward design&quot;.  
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You want cab forward?  I got cab-forward!  All Vanagons have
&quot;cab-forward'&quot;.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  All previous versions of VW's van have &quot;cab-forward&quot;!!!
