&gt; To the point..the 1982 Westfalia is in need of an electrical cover, that
&gt;is, the cover that goes on the outside of the van where the water hookups
&gt;are located. VW wants $25 for the thing with the hinge pin. The color is
&gt;black with the graphics in white.

Order from Delta Six direct.   They are now called Euro American RV products.
