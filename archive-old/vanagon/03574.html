&gt; BTW, on my long long summer trip I waved at everybody in VW vans.  Any body see
&gt; me?  I'm in a guacemole green 76 with a big black storage box bolted to the top
&gt; rack - in front of the pop top.  I have Indiana plates.

I took a trip to Mendocino, CA (redwoods, beach, etc.) and
waved/flashed (headlights, that is...) at a dozen Westys with ONLY ONE
RESPONSE. Then I broadened the waving/headlight-flashing candidates to
include any bus....still, &lt; 5% response....I was devastated....the
sense of brother/sister/personhood, family....pulled out from under my
feet.

I was up with my fiance(e?) finalizing our wedding plans (on the coast,
in October), and my future mother-in-law and her husband met us at the
campground for a one-night stay - we all climbed into Cassie ('89
Westy) - me and Leslie on top, Christy and Charlie (the parents..) on
the bottom - what a cozy family! Oh yeah, our dog Kira (48 lbs of
mini-lap(NOT LAB)ador) was on top, too.

This further affirms that Leslie is the woman for me to spend the rest
of my life with....and the parent-in-laws get kudos for going along with
this!

Still waving.....and flashing....and single....for awhile...

Steve
