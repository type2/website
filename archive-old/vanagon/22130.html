Subject:  midwest vw woman (f)

went to the fabric store the other day for some upholstery fabric for my
seats.  i asked the elderly woman at the counter if i could take a bolt
(from the cheap table) out to my van and compare it to the interior.  she
said she'd have to accompany me...so we go out to the van and her face
lights up and she says 'we used to have one of these!'. i asked her
when/what kind etc. and it apparently was an earlier double cab pickup. 
she was surprised that i knew what one was.  'yeah, we used to put a
mattress and in the back (she had the canvas top) and drive all the way
to s. dakota every year to camp.  blew it up going up a hill though.
(shakes head) i loved that thing.'  i could sense that she really did.

it was pretty neat.
