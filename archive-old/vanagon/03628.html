What's all the ballyhoo about?  The centerfold trick was funny, harmless, 
and did the trick.  It can hardly be accurately described as an act which 
&quot;terrorized&quot; the woman.

Incidentially, I drove 8K on my trip this summer, and fortunately my bus 
was bypassed by potential thieves.  My vent windows don't even *have* 
locks!  I guess putting off the bodywork and paint job wasn't such a bad 
idea, after all.
