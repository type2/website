   Muir sez you don't have to pull the head to replace the PR tubes.  Do I
have to de-torque the head and pull it off slightly to pull/replace the PR
tubes.

Thanx agin

On the old type-I engines, the haed must come off to put back in a stock pushrod
tube, or you could use an aftermarket 2-piece unit.
On the type-IV engines, just remove the rocker cover and arms (and possibly a
big wire clip) to pull it out. Be sure to buy new O-rings for re-assembly.The
newer, brown (Viton) ones are the one to get.
