Subject: Head Gaskets are shot. Should I swap heads?

 
  Any advice much appreciated.  My head gaskets are leaking after an
overheat.  It's an '87 with 68K miles on it.  Should I kick down and do the
heads at the same time? The mechanic thinks it's almost always necessary.
 I've heard the contrary.

                                              Thanks,
                                              Rob Halligan
