&lt;&lt; Any comments on which I should go with????  Both offer about the same 
 rolling diameter.  The 16&quot; option is a little more spendy.  I have 
 gotten good feedback on the 215X60 R15 combination and it is my current 
 favorite.  I would hate to miss an opportunity to get the best handling 
 though so I throw this out to you. &gt;&gt;

If you don't have a syncro, go with the 15&quot;.
I've run ( y'all know this by now..) 15&quot; Audi 5000 turbo wheels on a Van and
they do fine as far as clearance and handling. I was running 205 60's on
them, but that was only because the tires on the wheels off the Audi were
already good. 215's are a better choice.
