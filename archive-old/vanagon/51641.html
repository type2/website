Happens every time, every where (that I've tried) with my '86.  I just
stand back...

&gt;&gt;&gt; ... I can't for the life of me prevent
&gt;&gt;&gt; the tank from overflowing when filling up, unless I use miniscule
&gt;&gt;&gt; pressure at the pump.  Does anyone have any pointers as to what, if
&gt;&gt;&gt; anything, may be wrong.  Or is this a feature?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;My 87 Vanagon GL has the same 'feature'.  If I let the pump go until the
&gt;&gt;automatic cut-off, I ALWAYS have fuel spitted back out.  It's been that
&gt;&gt;way since I bought it a year and a half ago.
&gt;&gt;ANYBODY OUT THERE, PLEASE POST TO THE LIST IF THIS IS NORMAL OR IF THIS
&gt;&gt;IS SOMETHING MORE SINISTER!
&gt;
&gt;i don't think it's anything sinister. ;)  with my 88 GL, it seems to
&gt;make
&gt;a big differnce WHICH pump i use at which gas station. some pumps are
&gt;more
&gt;touchy than others. and i've noticed that in other states, the
&gt;sensitivity
&gt;of the pump cut-off also varies.
&gt;
&gt;usually! i can stick the nozzle in and hang the thing on the filler
&gt;hole,
&gt;with the handle in a vertical position, and put the little lock on.
&gt;most of
&gt;the time, it works fine. every now and then, it'll kick-back and splash
&gt;gas
&gt;out.
&gt;
&gt;so all i can advise is to try other pumps and other gas stations and
&gt;see if
&gt;it still happens. also notice if your bus is tilted one way or the
&gt;other.
&gt;there's one station in town that is &quot;tilted&quot; and if i get on the
&gt;high-side,
&gt;it'll always splash back.
