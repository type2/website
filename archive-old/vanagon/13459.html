hole .. by Derek Drew_at_interport_dot_net 
&gt; Alert. Alarm. 
&gt; Uh...I don't think you can cut that hole. There is special reinforcements
&gt; for that hole in a factory westy and god knows what you would have to do to
&gt; replicate them. I don't think they are documented very well either. 
&gt; I think you have to consider cutting just a little hole.  
&gt; The consensus I have gathered from experts is that you really cannot cut
&gt; that hole. 

Feh...  Special reinforcements?  How special ??..
If one doubled up the sheet metal around the hole, and had a weding shop
reinforce the undercarraige a bit...  This should be very do-able...
