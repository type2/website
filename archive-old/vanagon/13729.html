  I have noticed fuel spilling out of the hole (vent) under the fuel tank hole
  in my 71 westy. It pours out enough to stain the side of the bus, thats not
  a big deal its a crappy paint job, but is this an indication of a major
  problem or am I obsessing?


While I personally like the stain effect (I must since my '71 bus has a
pretty good one), it is probably not a good idea to drive around with
explosive, carcinogenic, and fairly expensive liquids gushing out.  You
might try tightening up the bolts holding the filler to the body and see
if that does the trick.  This worked for me over a period of a couple of
years but they always loosened up after a while and needed to be
retorqued.  The worst time was right after filling up and weaving up and
down Mulholland Drive in the Hollywood Hills.  The gas fumes were awful
but they did have the advantage of covering up the stench from some salted
anchovies that I bought for surf-fishing and that I suspect were lost in
the stupid black hole that sits underneath the driver seat.  I don't know
if I replaced the gasket (and I don't remember if there actually is a
gasket on the filler connection) but I do know that my last retorque
succeeded in snapping the heads off of not one but two bolts.  I then
drilled four holes and put in big sheet metal screws that to this day have
worked without any trouble.
