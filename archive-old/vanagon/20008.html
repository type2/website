Subject: Re: The dirty work

&gt;I've just stripped the engine from my '71 bus, thought I'd get a gallon 
&gt;or two of solvent to put in the bug sprayer, and clean the daylights out 
&gt;of everything.  The only place I've found solvent by the gallon was $20 
&gt;bucks!!!  Ouch, and WalMart doesn't have it.  Perhaps there's something 
&gt;cheaper and almost as 
&gt;effective on grease, like Dawn dishwashing liquid?  This is probably OK 
&gt;on the shrouding, but how about the inside of the crankcase?  What are 
&gt;the tricks and tips on this type of cleaning job?  Also, is there a list 
&gt;of Mustdos While the Engines Out? 
&gt;
&gt;I deeply appreciate the help I get from this list!  Working on the bus 
&gt;has certainly been more fun thanks to you generous gurus and others who 
&gt;ask the questions that I was also wondering about.

Paint thinner at wal mart is $1.64 a gallon.  I use it in a parts washer and 
used the said washer to clean a engine before.  As far as must do's, I would 
change the trans seal, and check the cv's and the starter.

Good luck.
