&gt; My cellphone adapter( for the lighter), which worked fine in my Chev Blazer,

With my cell phone adapter I got a plastic sleeve that I have to slide 
over the connector part.  Apparently it is not an uncommon size 
distinction.  Other Cig light stuff has the problem you mention.

Hmm...  I got a Chevy S10 and a EV.  Similarities maybe?
