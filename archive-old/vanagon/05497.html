&gt; &gt; Well, considering I've seen '89 - '91 Syncro Westies in the paper for
&gt; &gt; sale at SF Bay area VW dealerships for $17K - $21K, I thought his price
&gt; &gt; was laughable.  But, I suppose he'll be the one with the smile on his
&gt; &gt; face when someone coughs up the dough.  Between the dealers and private
&gt; &gt; parties that advertise in the SF Chronicle, there always seems to be
&gt; &gt; about 2-3 Syncro Westies, and another 1-2 Syncro Transporters advertised
&gt; &gt; in the Friday news.  They don't seem to be _that_ rare around here.

&gt; 
&gt; True, but I guess it depends on the shape it's in.  $24K is a bit steep
&gt; but I think he can get it or close to it.  I wished I'd bought a Syncro.

Pardon me for intruding, but what makes a syncro great and desireable?
Does it handle better in the snow/rain/mud?
Is fuel economy better or worse?
Does it ride smoother?
Does it handle better?
Will it go off road?
Is it expensive to repair?
Is it peppier?

Just curious - DC
