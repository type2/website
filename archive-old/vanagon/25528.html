&gt; Thing as there is.  And the fact that rust is 25% the mixture by weight gives
&gt; it a great Vanagon-list spin.

Grin!  

So the moral of the story is that I should not attempt to smoke in my 
bus if I have accidentally run into a big pile of aluminum powder! 

I can see it now.  my engine compartment gets really rusty, and one 
day when you least expect it as you start up the bus, WHOOOM!  The 
engine's gone in a fireball of glory.
