Subject: AAA info request..

David Shepardon wrote advice to boycott AAA, I say join, then get as many 100 
mile tows as you need or can muster every year.  If they are paying tow 
trucks, they'll have that much less money to promote the gas guzzling, anti 
environment policies David also identifies.  Edward Abbey LIVES !
