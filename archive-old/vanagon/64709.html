Late 70's (?), early/mid 80's vanagon have an &quot;engineering&quot; defect in the
gasoline tanks. To give the tank structural integrity the tanks were
engineered with grooves/valleys in the surface (top and bottom). Sounds
reasonable! Unfortunately the valley's on the top of the tank collect(ed)
water and grim and there is no way for this water/dirt to flow off the top
of the tank. So these tanks succumbed to early death by rust-through at
the tops of the tank. What is really scary is that the cardboard
&quot;fresh-air/heated-air&quot; venting tube (that runs from the back end up to the
front) passes over (lays on top of) the top of the tank. So gasoline
leaking/splashing out of the holes on the top of the tank saturate the
cardboard vent tube. The fumes subsequently &quot;vent&quot; into the cabin. On
really hot days, your cabin can become a gasoline vapour chamber. If you
happened to be a smoker and opened your vanagon door with a lighted
cigarete ... Adios! I don't smoke, but there were days when I would open
the sliding door to my vanagon (82' GL, 2L, FI) and almost become overcome
with gas fumes. Yes, I did get the tank (and all the hoses) replaced at my
expense. There was a recall on the gasolin tanks, but I'm unsure of which
years and what was exactly in the recall. I do know that the tank and all
the hoses on my 86' Westfalia were replaced by VW as part of a recall,
whether it was part of the same recall or not, I don't know.
