Subject: Re: 12 Volt Halogens (was RE: generators vs. camping (long and tiresome))

12v Halogens are available from:

1. JC Whitney (a halogen dome light, bulb for back up lights usable 
elsewhere) and other FLAPS.

2. Home lighting stores have low voltage halogen lights designed to use 
with transformers on 120V. The 12V ones are very usable. I was able to 
get a set of 3 small 10watt undercounter lights and Home depot for about 
$40. (Don't use the transformer)
