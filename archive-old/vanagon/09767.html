Well, to my dismay, all N.C. State parks are closed to family camping
from Nov 30- March 15. Along this reprehensible trend, the several
places I have stayed in the mountains are also closed  for the winter.
  So, there is ONE park open now, it is the Jordan Lake State Park. It
is on highway 64, around Apex, N.C. which is actually closer to D.C, and
around the same from the South.
  They have 100 spaces available now, 6 people per space (as many
vehicles as you can fit! ) and it's $9.00 for a regular space, and
$14.00 for a space with a power hook-up (this is per space, not per
person) The park gates are open 8 am - 6 pm, and the number for all
wishing further details is 1-919-362-0586. This is the park office, open
9-5. As Isaid, this is on a lake, with trails to hike, etc. Ihave talked
to several people that have been there, and they all said it was nice.
   So, what think the people? How many of us are interested? When do we
want to do it? Speak now, or forever hold your peace...
Richard
