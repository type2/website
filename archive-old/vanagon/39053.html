&gt; I have two 185 R 14's and 2 185/75 r 14's on my van on opposite sides, in
&gt; opposite corners!  Might this tend to make my van handle funny?

&gt; A local dealer called and has the following tres in 185 R 14... which one
&gt; doyoyu think is best? (this is the size printed in my van)
&gt; 
&gt; michelin mx $96.00

&gt; Bridgestone d rated 8 ply $88.00

	Tire sizes with no series number ie: /70, /75 are a 82 series 
profile or 82% of the overall width...
	
	Passenger tires are not measured across the tread for width, 
rather they are measured sidewall to sidewall mounted on a wheel at 
proper inflation...
	The exception is LT tires such as 27x8.50R-14 this is 8.5&quot; 
across the tread...
	This information was taken from a Yokohama Tire guide... other 
Brands may vary( but only slightly)...	
	
	The Revs per mile is an indication of how it will affect your 
Speedometer and Odometer readings... the Taller the tire the fewer the 
revs, the slower the Speedo reads...,but the faster you will 
accelerate...

		I have been selling tire for 4 yrs at Costco Warehouse 
Club and have been in the Auto Parts industry for 15.  I have been into 
VWs since my Dad bought his first New Bug (1957, I was 2)...
