Subject: accelerator problems


Interesting.

My '87 Vanagon's accelerator lost half its range today.

I was only able to press it halfway down, returning from
staten Island traffic this evening...  After spending some time getting
the pivoting mechanism off and deciding it was OK, and
then re-assembling it, I looked at the engine compartment:

here's what I saw:
1) the A/C compressor belt had come completely loose 
   and was rubbing against the alternator belt!!!  Took care of that real
   quick.

2) the bead-type chain that is attached to the throttle assembly (cruise
   control?) had gotten loose at the other end (not sure exaclty where),
   fallen to the side of the manifold, and gotten stuck -- it was repventing
   the throttle arm from moving more than 1/2 of its range.
   I took the bead hting (?) off of the throttle end, and now the 
   acc. pedal works all its range...


3) the spring that is supposed to pull the throttle arm back had
   gotten loose, tigthened it

4) the throttle arm had rust &amp; grime all over, did not move smoothly.
   a generous dose of WD-40 took care of that.
