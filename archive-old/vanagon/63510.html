I'm not overly knowledgeable about fuel injection problems, but this
definitely sounds like one.  I've had a similar problem with the
hesitation in my '79 bus and suggest this:

Check to make sure you have good clean and firm electrical ground
connections. I know, too easy, but this got rid of the hesitation for
me. But it still wasn't running right, felt like it WOULD hesitate or
something.  

The main problem for me turned out to be the air flow meter/sensor,
which tells the computer how much air is being sucked into the
cylinders, which the computer uses (along with the info from the temp
sensors and all that) to determine how much fuel needs to be injected
for proper mix, etc.  A faulty air flow meter gives wrong data to the
computer, maybe lagging behind for a second before it snaps to and goes
&quot;oh, you're accelerating!  You're accelerating....oh, yeah, I'm supposed
to tell the computer how much air is going in--hey computer!&quot;  and that
time lag could be the hesitation.

Just a guess...

&gt; 
&gt; Hear is a teaser for the problem solvers. 
&gt; 
&gt; 1.  Upon driving off a high pitched squeel, not too loud comes from
&gt; what
&gt; sounds like the right rear of the car.  Maybe wheel well.  The sound
&gt; stops
&gt; when the brake is applied then continues when the brake is released.
&gt; After
&gt; about a mile or so it goes away until the next time the car sits for a
&gt; little while.
&gt;         Any ideas?  
&gt; 2.  Yesturday, Peggy told me that the camper did something strange.
&gt; on one
&gt; trip it hesitated three separate times.  This occured in both third
&gt; and
&gt; fourth gear.  The car acted as if the gas peddle was released.  It was
&gt; for
&gt; only a moment and then the car resumed normally.  
&gt;         Again ideas? 
&gt; 3.  Thanks to everon who helped with the oil plug problem.  I haven't
&gt; found
&gt; a complete solution yet but I'm certainly better informed.  I hate it
&gt; but I
&gt; may be using the rubber plug for a while.  Anyone know where I can get
&gt; the
&gt; coil incert that can be threaded in?
