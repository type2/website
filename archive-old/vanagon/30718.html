&gt;has completely eliminated my leak problems.

&gt;Good luck

&gt;brian.

I would add the caveat &quot;that you *know* of&quot; to your
sentence.  If the seal has shrunk that much, water may be
sitting in that channel under your fix.  Ask an old splittie
owner about rusted windshield bottoms.  No substitute for
replacing the seal in the long run.

I had a commercial auto glass firm replace my windshield
('84 Vangagon GL) as part of my insurance coverage.  &quot;Never
done one like this&quot; was his observation.  New glass, old
seal, means water in the foot wells every time it rains.  I
ended up buying a new seal ($80 from VW) and installing it
myself.  No more leaks.
