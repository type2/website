Subject: Re: survey of insurance rates/companies

What type of coverage are you talking about?

While mine is not a camper, 87 vanagon GL -- back seat makes into queen
size bed, with curtains tucked under it for privacy, I have 10/20/10
with uninsured motorist, full collision coverage, second car discount,
van is my car to drive for work (female--BARELY old enough to not pay
the young(teenager) driver rate), drives approx. 100 miles round trip
daily to 'medium' size city, and I have one accident on my record
(completely the other guys fault--his insurance paid everything--not
mine).  I pay Farm Bureau just under $50 a month -- roughly $600/year --
would be slightly less if I didn't pay monthly.  The Vanagon replaced my
crushed car (also an 87 though) but my insurance for van was only about
$3/month 
more than the pre-accident car.  So, it doesn't appear that the accident
affected my rates.

Interesting thread tho ...
