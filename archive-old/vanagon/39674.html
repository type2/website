Or how about this:

A CHP pulls onto the shoulder of the PCH right up behing a VW.  He looks in 
the front passenger window and sees nobody.  The curtains are drawn on all the 
back windows so he tries the side sliding door.  When he sticks his head in 
it's a large condominium-looking entrance way with hardwood floors and 10 foot 
ceilings.  He finds the occupants in the huge stone-tiled kitchen cooking a 
gourmet meal on a gas range.  They invite him to join them for dinner.
