I use a Graber, (pronounced Gray-bar) hatch mounted rack.  they are
available from most Swinn shops for around a hundred, as opposed to those
pricey top mounted rackes which might look really spiffy but are not
practical for the Vanagon unless you are of Wilt Chablerlain's proportons.
Last year I hauled three mountain bikes 3400 miles from Missouri to Utah
and back, no problem.

ps: In case you are contemplating it, I found the Slick Rock Trail in Moab
Utah breathtakingly beautiful but -no-place-! for a fifty year old out of
shape college professor!!
