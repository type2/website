Subject: VW-HELP! I'M GOING TO CUT AN ACCESS PANEL IN MY '71 BUS
Date: Tue, 18 Mar 97 14:15:05 PST
From: Nick Pace &lt;nickpace_at_rand_dot_org&gt;

The always helpful Tom Peterson suggested that I contact you all.  I'm not
a member of this list (though I should be) so any replies should come back
directly to me at nickpace_at_rand_dot_org.

This is a cry for help dealing with experiences you might have had with
cutting an access panel into the rear deck of a '71 Bus in order to make
removing the fan housing possible with the engine still in the van.  At
6:00pm PST today, unless someone tells me that I'm about to open a
horrible can of worms, I'm going to plug in the sabre saw and begin the
creation of a rectangular opening directly above the fan housing.  I've
seen a similar set-up in '74 and later busses.  I figure I could sheet
metal screw a larger plate on top of the piece I've removed and then screw
that onto the rear deck when I didn't need it open.

If you have had direct experience with this sort of thing, please email me
ASAP.  I'm tired of dropping the engine to perform fairly routine work and
I've got to check my oil cooler seals.  My generator is also just about
due for a change and it would be easier if I could have the housing out
before extracting the generator.  Yeah, I can get the engine out and on
the ground in just over an hour but it's not fun and it's a lot of extra
effort that I don't need.  I'll drop the engine, though, if someone tells
me that the hatch lets in cold, fumes, noise, etc.

Thanks for your quick response.  If I go ahead and do this, I'll post a
note to the NG about what happened.

Nick
