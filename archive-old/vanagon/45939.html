Subject: Re: VW Factory Rep on List


Here's a possible way of getting VW's involvement on the list...the VWAG web 
page....as I recall there is a section on their web page where you can write 
directly to their customer service department. Perhaps someone can volunteer 
to send them some e-mail via their web page, along with a copy of Joel's 
stats (yep...they DO come in handy) to show them what interest there is in 
VWs on V_at_L. 

Its a good sign that VWAG's web page lists Coyote's Invinuk (sp?) web page, 
Thom Fitzpatrick's web page and some others directly related to this 
list...so obviously they're out there watching....its just a matter of 
making the connection between V_at_L, the Bus web pages and VWAG. 

Maybe we could even send a list of members' names, etc., as well??


I'd volunteer for such an undertaking, unfortunately, I'm up to my ass in 
alligators.....
