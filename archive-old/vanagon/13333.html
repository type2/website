Subject:       What's the difference?

I know that different countries use different names, but can someone 
tell me the differences between the different names that people are 
using on the list? I've got a '69 bay window bus, sometimes I call it 
a bus, sometimes a camper (it's got windows and a devon eurovette 
interior) and sometimes a combi. So what are Vanagons, Eurovans, 
Buses, Kombis, Syncros and Campers?

Over to you...

B ) 'later...
