Subject: RE: EV tire update....

Ric,

This is probably the best solution for your situation....  IMHE I have had the 
best of luck with Michelin products over the last 10 years...

     Jon


I just called Tire Rack to see if I could get the tires for my
EV mail order...the Michelin MXLs for the EV are available on a
&quot;priority hold&quot; basis...aparently they are in limited supply
and Michelin will ship 4 out at a time...it takes 3 to 4 weeks
to get the tires &lt;sigh&gt;.

The salesperson suggested that I go to an &quot;H&quot; rated tire which
would have a sidewall similar to that of a reinforced sidewall.
