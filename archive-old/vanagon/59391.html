Subject: Gas and temp gauge QUIT

...at the same moment, for second time in two years.  The last time, I lived 
with it for the winter, but I don't want to try it going into the summer.  
Anyway, when I had it fixed, the mechanic said all he did was put in a used 
relay/whatever/thing that just plug in behind the fuse panel.  Along with 
working gauges, the van also had a new sound when the door was open with the 
key in the ignition (sounded like my 88 Jetta used to: an up-and-down tone 
thing).  I'm wondering if anyone knows whether or not I can just scavenge a 
replacement from wrecked Jetta or Golf, or whether this item is specific to the 
Van.  Or is this one of those VW electrical voodoo things where replacing one 
thing brought something totally unrelated back to life?

Or should I pretend that I'm in my 73 Thing and just watch the odometer between 
fill-ups?
