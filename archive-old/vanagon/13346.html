Subject: Whens a vw camper not a vw camper?


This months Volksworld has an article on a vw camper that is not
a type 2, its a type 1! It is a conversion called the `SuperBugger'
available from an outfit called Super Campers in Costa Mesa (?) in
the early 80s.

A donor beetle is cut off at the base of the windscreen and fitted to
the front of what looks like a very small winnabago 
(well to me at least), to provide the car interior and camping 
facilities. The whole thing is 14 ft long, 79 ins wide and 84 ins high 
and looks very strange indeed!

The photos of the interior make it seem very luxury inside when
compared to a standard type 2 camper, with wall to wall carpeting,
wood (look ?) panelling, cooker with extractor hood etc etc etc.

The original 1600 has been taken out to a large 2100cc, which the
owner reckons on over 20 mpg and a reasonable performance on the road,
but given that the conversion is even more slab sided than a type 2
I wonder how it copes with side winds.  

Very interesting but I think I'll stick to my bus.
