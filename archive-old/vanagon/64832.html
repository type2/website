Subject:      Recent trip

We recently took a trip to the Gila Cliff Dwellings, about 40 miles north
of Silver City, New Mexico.  The van ran great, except that after a long
climb, it would lose some power while still warm, and only at low RPM.
Once it had cooled a bit, it returned to normal.  I'm wondering if this is
related to the vapor lock problem we had once since the rebuild.

At any rate, we took some pictures of the van on the trip, and if you are
interested in either the van or the scenery north of Silver City, you can
view the pictures at:

I want to give a special thanks to all those on this list who helped with
instructions and advice during the rebuild.  Your help made this trip
possible.

Silver City is about two hours from our home.
