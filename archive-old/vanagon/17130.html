Subject: For Sale&gt; Carb kit for replacing FI


Just recently I was having some problems with my 78' bus fuel injection
system.  Not able, or patient maybe, enough to solve the problem after a
couple of months, I bought a hardly used Weber two barrel carb kit, a
009 distributor and a new lower pressure fuel pump.  Just as I was
taking the mass of twisted tubes, wires and sensors out of my van, I
noticed that my EGR system was letting atm pressure into my intake air
distributor.  With the hole plugged, everything is cool and I need the
cash back for a new windshield for this stupid PA inspection thing. 
I'll unload the whole smash for $325 or best offer.  Thanks

 Will Northrop.
