&gt;Try taking it through one of those brushless car washes. The high-
&gt;pressure spray does wonders.


If I could find one where they don't whine, &quot;We can't fit your van into
the bay-- it's too tall!&quot;, I'll certainly try it.

Remember the good old days, when the VW bus was the *smallest*
van on the road?  :^)
