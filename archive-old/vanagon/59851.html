Subject: help with stumbling 89 GL 2.1 Westy

Hi listfolks!  I need some advice relating to problem I'm recently
encountering on my 89 Westy.   Just last week, as I rolled up to 90,000 miles
it started occuring.  After a normal start-up, and idle,  the engine would
stumble, and hesitate as I applied the gas, or turned on the A/C.  It appears
that any type  of load causes this hesitation... until I reach 3000 rpm, and
then it seems to accelerate normally.  From a dead stop,  I have to feather
the gas pedal, or the engine acts like I'm flooding it.. when this happens,
 I let off the gas a little , until it seems &quot;to catch&quot; and then I can
generally accelerate on up, as long as I don't press too hard on the gas.

For starters, I've replaced the O2 sensor,  checked the voltage to the idle
stabilizer valve and made sure it was humming,  reset the throttle valve
switch, replaced plugs, rotor, dist. cap.  I have a new fuel filter, but I
did the fuel pump regulator check per Bentley to see fuel quantity cfs from
return line of pressure regulator.  Just last year I changed ignition coil to
new green label Bosch, and when she went dead  on a trip last year,  it also
required a new ECU.  I also replaced temperature sensor last October.... but
I'm wondering if this might still be my culprit, since the problem seems to
get worse as I warm up the engine.  It never does stall though at idle,
unless I've got A/C on.....  by the way,,, I've run techron through a couple
of times, and gone through several tanks of fuel

ANY HELP WOULD BE GREATLY APPRECIATED....

Thanks...
