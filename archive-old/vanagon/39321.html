Subject: Re: T3 Ghia

Jason-
The Ghia is from Dallas. It is very straight, but does have some 
rust,mostly on the pan. It is a '64 1500S T34 Ghia. The car is white 
with a black top and is mostly complete. All of the tough stuff is 
there like, Taillight assemblies, doors, glass, bumpers, turn signal 
assemblies, seats, rear view mirror ,and drivetrain. The engine is 
removed, but it had the dual carbs and other parts with it.
I hope this helps. The main reason that I am selling the car is that 
I am self-employed and tax time is a bitch. The car also is a 
project, and would require some love and devotion. I do have the 
original owners manual ,but no clean title. It has been sighed and 
never transferred by a P.O. please E-mail if interested.

Brian,
I e-mailed you about a list of the parts you had for sale.  In the
list you included that you had a T3 Ghia that you were going to sell. 
I wanted some info on car.  What kind of shape is it in-body, engine,
interior, etc.  Is it complete?  If not what is missing?  Any info
will be helpful.  Thanks, Jason
