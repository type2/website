Subject:      misc. ramblings about locations


ok. time for a reality check here. now, if this Great Expedition and
Circumnavigation of Bus-dom is to be planned, much less effected,
then there is gonna have to be some more data accumulated. :)
as in, where everybody is.

for example, no since in driving through nevada or utah ... cause
nobody says they are there. so let's get those cards and letters
in the mail, and let's see what sort of route Martha is gonna have to
plan for this raucous rabble of random rovers. (hmmmm. too bad we're
not rich british car drivers!). how about Boisterous Band of Busing
Buffoons.

right off the bat, i think we can eliminate Australia and United
Kingdom. :(  unless we procrastinate long enough for the Trans-Siberian
and Alaska Highway Bridge to be built ... still a looooong detour to
the U.K. and we still can't get to AUS. into canada, anyone?

Total       133

well, anyway. get them locations in so a plan can be laid out to
bypass any 'empty' states. :)

have you guys really really thought about this? i mean, even five or
ten buses rolling together down the highway is bound to attract some
attention, don't you think?  maybe get on CNN? in the Guiness book?

maybe the Passing of the Hubcp is not such a  crazy idea after all.
maybe everybody could sign it (engraved?).

just thinking out loud, folks. :)
