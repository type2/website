&gt;Questions:
&gt;Is is possible to get a 195 or 205/70R14 profile and still get the 
&gt;proper load rating?
&gt;Of those mentioned, which have shown good results?
&gt;Any others which are not mentioned which should be?

195/75 or 205/70 really require reinforced sidewalls or load range c for
needed capacity.  215/70 is rated at 1554 pounds _at_ 35 psi.  This is enough to
carry van at it's max GVW.  Handling is great also.  Some tires now rated to
be inflated to 44psi(fuel economy).  These work even better as they can be
inflated to the pressures recomended on the door panel.   Provide better
handling also.
