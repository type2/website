Subject:      CO Adjustment?

Has anybody figured out a way to do the CO adjustment without taking it to
the dealer?

I just finished doing a tune-up on my 1987 Vanagon and was trying to think
of a way to do the CO adjustment in the Bentley without the VW Dealer Gear.
 I have a couple of O2 sensors, any way to use an external O2 sensor and
meter to calculate CO Increase/decrease?  My van runs OK but the CO
adjustment hasn't been performed since I've owned it.  Had no trouble
passing CO or CA emissions...

I am stuck taking it to the dealer?

Anybody know of a VW shop in Dallas area to do it if I can't?

Thanks-

P.S. Joel please move me from Boulder, CO to Dallas, TX...
