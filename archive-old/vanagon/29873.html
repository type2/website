One of the problems with CV reassembly is that they can be put together 
backwards (but won't work that way). Once you take your CV apart (ONLY 
DISASSEMBLE ONE AT A TIME)--excuse me, was I shouting?--if you don't keep 
track of which side goes with which side, it's easy to mix it up. 
AND...if you get it put back together wrong, it can be a BEAR to get 
apart again to correct.

I like Bob's idea of keeping EVERYTHING oriented so it all goes back 
together EXACTLY as it came apart. Next time I do one, I'll definitely 
follow that advice!

Take your time taking the CV joint apart. Make sure you know exactly how 
it came apart...and then put it together exactly the same way. Don't let 
your eyes play tricks on you.

It's not really anything to be afraid of. It's easy really, especially if 
you pay attention and don't get it put back together backwards.
