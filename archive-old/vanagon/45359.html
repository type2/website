Subject: Cycling Fridg Condenser Fan 83 Westie

My 1983 Westie's refrigerator apparently has a thermostatically 
controlled fan to aid the natural chimney effect induced air flow over 
its condenser coil.  I've heard it cycling on and off everytime I've used 
the refrigerator, and not only does it bother me with its noise, but I 
hate the idea that it's using up the battery's reserve.  Surely this 
isn't a normal design occurance for times when the ambient temperature is 
as low as 70 degrees F. is it?  Has anyone experienced and corrected 
this?  I suspect the heat sensor is triggering to an on condition at too 
low a temperature.  Please help.
