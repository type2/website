Subject: Re: Possible soundproofing alternative? (was: Seek and Ye Sh


   I'd noticed some silver-colored adhesive insulating pads in
   a Griot's Garage catalog, unfortunately they are out and do
   not expect more. I wondered how well the &quot;Roadkill&quot; stuff in
   the VW magazines would help insulate ye olde Transporter?

&gt;     trucks, big rigs, or tractors, as in tractor trailer.  Anyway, this
&gt;     material was used along with an adhesive which was used between the sheet
&gt;     metal panels and the frame of the vehicle.  This combination was said to
&gt;     reduce vibration and noise considerably.
&gt;
&gt;     The foam was available in different thicknesses from, as I recall, a thin
&gt;     sheet, maybe 1/16&quot; to 1/2-5/8&quot; or thicker.
&gt;
&gt;     I'll keep looking for a source.
