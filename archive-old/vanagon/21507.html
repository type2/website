Subject: RE: Tire question



&gt;I have an 82 Vanagon and I need two front tires. I dont have the cash to
&gt;sport 2 new reinforced tires. Has anyone ever put passenger tires on
&gt;their van? Or am I crazy to even think about it?


I have always put ordinary 4-ply radial passenger car tires on my busses
(a '69 many years ago, and a '71 now). In fact, I just went to Discount Tire
here in San Diego, and put four 215/75R14 tires from BF Goodrich on my
'71. Yes, they fit, except for a slight rub going into a bumpy driveway with
the wheels fully turned left.

Haven't heard any loud bangs, or seen any strips of tread flying off yet.
On the '69 I had two Goodyear Polysteels, 195/75R14, and two no-name
tires, size ER78-14 (now those were old!). No tire failures!

I suspect that the specification for 6-ply (reinforced) tires, comes from 
the
bus's maximum load capability, which I think is around 2,000# (!) If you 
fill
your bus up with firewood or a full waterbed (interesting?), then I would
say you definitely need reinforced tires. But if you don't, then check the
max weight rating on the tire, and decide if your bus will ever exceed this
on any tire. If it won't, then don't worry, be happy!

My $0.02 worth.
