&gt; 
&gt; My front mats in my Vanagon, the two mats that go on either side under the
&gt; driver and front passenger's seats, are worn. I remember that I bought them
&gt; at the dealer. Does anybody have a line on the best place to go to buy new
&gt; ones? Mine have nice little VW logos on them.

&gt; 
I bought the ones from JC Whitney. They are medium/dark blue and match 
the original carpet very nicely. There is no logo or anything but they 
fit perfect. Go for the plush hi pile ones. Also bought the long narrow 
one for the rear passenger seat area. Need a couple more of those to 
really cover it all but at $20/piece it will be a couple pay days before 
I order the other ones.

Peace,
