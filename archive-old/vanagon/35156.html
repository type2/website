Hiya, Kris!

Nice to hear from you.  And good news about the job.

Top Dead Center occurs twice per engine revolution in a 4 cyl, 4 cycle
engine.  If you align the TDC notch on the pulley with the centerline of the
crankcase, you are at TDC... for 'a' cylinder, the trick is to know which
one.  That's where the distributor comes in handy.  Checking the distributor
should tell you which electrode is within the firing arc of the rotor.  Using
#1, and putting a notch on the distributor body is fine, if the distributor
and the driver-gear have been properly installed.

Without reference to the distributor, you watch the SEQUENCE of the valves as
you rotate the engine in the running direction.  When the intake closes, then
the exhaust closes, then the mark comes up on the centerline, you are at TDC
for that particular cylinder.

Do not trust the looseness of the rockers to be a good guide for TDC, use the
centerline of the crankcase.

If doing a tune up, pulling all of the plugs permits the engine to turn over
very easily.  You can pop the right valve cover, get your head right down
near the ground while your hand is on the fan belt, and watch the valves as
you rotate the engine.  When you see the I-then-E sequence of valve
actuation, bring the mark to the centerline then dive under and do the valves
for #1.  Then rotate the engine BACKWARDS 180 degrees and do the valves for
#2.  This saves you all that crawling around.  Put the valve cover back on
and you're done on that side.  Rotating the engine BACKWARDS another 180
brings #3 to TDC so crawl under, pop the cover and do #3.  Another BACKWARDS
180 and #4 is at TDC.  Do the deadly deed, put the valve cover back on and
you are all done under the vehicle.  Should take no more than a few minutes.

Back topside, rotate the engine BACKWARDS another 180 degrees and you are
back at #1.  You can pull the distributor now and install the new points,
making sure the gap is perfect.  Leave the clamp attached to the distributor;
loosen the nut that holds the clamp to the crankcase and pull out the
distributor and clamp as a unit.

With new points installed and properly gapped, plug the distributor back in,
reinstall the washer &amp; nut securing the hold-down clamp and clip your static
timing light to the points-lead, the other end to the alternator B+ or some
other source of 12v.  I like to leave the key off when I've got my head
around the fan belt.  All that long, silky blond Surfer God hair, you know.

Now you can loosen the clamping nut.

Rotate the engine to align the timing mark with the crankcase centerline.
 Now grasp the distributor and rotate it a little, back and forth, hunting
for the precise point when the lamp first comes on.  Tighten the clamping
nut.  Put away the static timing light and connect the points-lead to the
negative terminal on the coil.

Now you can put in your new, properly gapped sparkplugs.  Verify their leads
as you connect them and inspect their air seals, replacing any that have
hardened.

The engine will now run and should idle, if the carb is properly adjusted.
 To verify your timing, connect a stroboscopic timing light to the #1 spark
plug lead and examine the timing dynamically.  If it needs a bit of tweaking,
loosen the clamping nut and GENTLY rotate the distributor.  Also look for any
jitter in the timing, which could indicate a worn distributor shaft or gear
train.

I've written this out in detail for the purpose of contrasting it with what
follows.  Because of the rapid rate of wear between the stock valve adjusting
screw and the valve stems, your valve adjustment is nothing more than a
compromise.  You must adjust your valves frequently to keep your engine's
performance near the peak of its curve, and that means as often as every
thousand or fifteen hundred miles.  I know, the manual sez 3,000 is fine.
 Unfortunately, that number is also a compromise.

If you have installed swivel-foot rockers you need adjust your valves only
half so often, since the larger contact area of the swivel-foot wears at a
much slower rate than does the stock rocker.  And swivel-feet are easier to
adjust, too.

If you have installed plantinum-electrode sparkplugs they will last up to
four times longer than conventional plugs, saving you both time and money.

If you have installed a CDI module, your points will last longer than the
rubbing block -- up to 50,000 miles.  You will have to adjust them once or
twice during that period but they need not be replaced until the rubbing
block is toast.

And of course, had you installed hydraulic lifters at overhaul time you would
never need adjust your valves again.
