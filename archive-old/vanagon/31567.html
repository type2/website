Subject: Back In Service

To all on the list -

Due to computer problems (including a hard disk crash, etc.), we've been &quot;off
the air&quot; so to speak for awhile.  New 1.2 Gig HD and a host of improvements
later, we're back.  However, we are not yet re-subscribed onto the list but
will do so soon.

If you have E-Mail for Bus Boys, we of course can still be reached at our
E-Mail Address and it is checked daily, usually late in the evenings.

We wish to extend thanks to those on the list who have called for info and
purchases at Bus Boys throughout 1995 and hope to serve you all in the coming
year.  Have a SAFE and Happy Holiday!!

Jim  /  BusBoys_at_aol_dot_com
