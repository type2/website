(re banter about how to mess up someones acct, root logins etc.)

'UNIX' can be loosely translated as 'Yes, you can do it, if you ar
e willing to grep 100Mb of man pages ....'

you can root login on most any node sans passwd if you are 
mildly motivated, hence UNIX is known as a 'non-secure' system.
