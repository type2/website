&gt;Yup. It's the water pump for sure.  I listened to it as per Joel's
&gt;instructions with an aluminum tent pole (isn't that what you said? &lt;smile&gt;).

NONONONONO!!! not an aluminum tent pole!! i said 'Tubing', like plastic or
rubber tubing! hell, if you listen to any water pump with aluminum tubing,
it always sounds like it's about to rattle itself to death!!! ;)
