Blaine,

Yes, please try it and let us know.  I've considered the same solution
(using the left side shelf).  I've also considered a very low-end work
around which would involve using flex duct to route air from the left air
outlet to just above the driver.  This would make it easy to get around
the pop-top opening.  Sounds crude, but when I'm waiting for ever for
cool air to get from the back to the front I might not care.

Thanks,
Ivan

&gt; 
&gt;      Folks-
&gt;      
&gt;      Forever bemused by VW's inability or unwillingness to do something 
&gt;      about front A/C in the Westfalia (just CAN'T use that cutsey name), 
&gt;      I've been wondering:
&gt;      
&gt;      How about sacrificing that left side &quot;shelf&quot; and installing a blank 
&gt;      duct (similar to the one over the sliding door, but without the 
&gt;      vents). At the rear, the duct would have a fitting to go into (and 
&gt;      replace) the leftmost air director on the A/C unit.  At the front, it 
&gt;      could terminate in an air director or two.  Or a more involved 
&gt;      installation might include ductwork that you install above the ceiling 
&gt;      panel with a couple of vents to bring the air away from the back of 
&gt;      your neck.  Maybe even an inline fan to help the air get through the 
&gt;      tube.
&gt;      
&gt;      Anyone done something like this on their own?
&gt;      
&gt;      Should I try it and then sell you all copies?
&gt;
