Subject:  little bro needs ride

after having purchased an 81 adventurewagen for me (with my $) in
april and delivering it to my door in michigan, my brother (who is not little
anymore) has returned to the los angeles area and is looking for his own
vanagon.  to be specific, an 87 or newer, pop-top weekender ideally, but
will consider any.  he's also looking at things. he's looking seriously - he
needs transportation.  if you have any leads (within a couple hours of la)
on prospective new members of our family, please let me know. 

thanks, matthew
