Subject: Concept 2 update (mexico city)

Business associates have just spent about seven weeks in Mexico City
wrapping up a project. The word is that the Concept 2 is driven on a daily
basis in Mexico City. &quot;The new beetle looks like the old one but the rear
wheel is only a couple of inches from the rear bumper.&quot; It was confirmed
inconversations that the rear fenders look like they were exactly the same
as the front fenders. Typical bowden tube troubles with the &quot;greenie&quot; beetle
taxi cabs. (chatter, chatter, chatter).
Contrary to the cliche' Cheverolet is rare down there. Current model Dodge
Ram and Ford passenger sized truck bodies (cabs) are the placed on five-ten
ton extended frames with variations of  industrial type flat bed configs.
Supposedly, the two auto makers have ten plants down there.
&quot;Buy American&quot; ~ unhuh, right. ;-)
