Subject: Engine Out!-'87 Syncro 

Hi to all you Vanagoneers, Loafers, Syncronauts, etc.

Just a quick update on my '87 Syncro's progress which hit the list with a
post titles something like: No Oil Pressure - '87!

Well it was diagnosed as probably bad rod bearings through the kind of noise
that it was making and instead of swapping with a rebuilt I decided to swap
with a used engine.  I bought a 1990 engine with 30,000 miles for $1,750
complete with clutch, distributer, exhaust including cat &amp; muffler,  &amp; fuel
injection stuff.  Well the old engine was prepped for removal last weekend
and removed yesterday with the help of a dear friend.  It went very smoothly.
 The only hang-up was trying to pull the engine straight back from the
transaxle without binding on the transmission shaft or the lower engine
studs.

Now the engines are side by side waiting for me to do a little work before
the &quot;new&quot; engine gets installed.

Exhaust:
I'll have to move the Syncro exhaust pipes from my old engine to the '90
engine (they had to make them different!).  Does anyone know how to tell it
the catalytic convertor is good or bad? Does anyone know how to tell it the
muffler is good or bad (aside from having holes in it)? 

Clutch:
The microfiche I have has the same part number for the Syncro clutch pieces
and the 2WD clutch pieces.  Does anyone have any reason NOT to trust this and
use the newer clutch from the 2WD '90 engine?  Also, I have 60,000 miles on
the clutch release (throw-out) bearing.  Does anyone know how to tell if this
one is worn out?  Or, should I just replace it anyway to be on the safe side?

Thanks in advance for your advice.  It is very much appreciated!

Happy Vanagoning,
