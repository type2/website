Subject: Re: proper oil temp

I have a '66 westfalia with a 1776 engine.  The oil temp has been running at
around 180-185, this being around town and driving to work.  Just recently I
stated working a much warmer area and the oil temp now creeps up to 190-200
degrees.  Does anyone know the proper running temp and how high the temp can
go before I must stop to cool it off.  I run 20-50w oil with doghouse cooler,
and oil pressure running at a constant 45 psi at speed,  15-20 psi at idle
when warm.
Thanks QueJ
