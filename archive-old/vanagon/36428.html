Subject: re: Diesel starters

&gt;I've had mine for nearly four years and have been through 3 new
&gt;starters
and
&gt;one rebuild.
&gt;I wish I know what the problem was, but the starter is one of the
&gt;weak
points
&gt;on the diesel Vanagon.

I haven't looked closely at the Vanagon diesel starters, but if a 
Jetta one would fit, you may want to try it. My 85 Jetta is still on 
the original starter (and alternator, and tranny, and...) at 341K 
kms, with no signs of wearing out.

(mind you the starter's also about 8&quot; from the battery, vs 8 feet in 
the Vanagon...)

I haven't lost my mind;  I'm sure it's backed up on tape somewhere!
