Subject: Real Cheap traction

In Uk in the 50's and 60's there was a form of sport called auto-cross. The
car that excelled was the lotus seven. The key mod to make these go through
the mudwas to change the handbrake to a 'fiddle handbrake' this mod can be
done on a pre 68 bus. The mod is to have 2 handbrakes side by side. They can
be grabbed together as an emergency/parking brake. If traction is lost on one
wheel the appropiate brake is applied and voila out of the mud you go.  Has
anyone here modded a bus like this. I also would like to know can it be done
to a 70 westy
