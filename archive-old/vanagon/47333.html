Natasha!!

Listen real close.....

No closer.......

Put your ear right to the screen.....

Dooooooouuuuuuhhhhhhhhhh!!!!

That was my best Homer Simpson sound for not filling the coolant in the
right (or er ah left I suppose) reservoir!!

I took your advice, and filled the reservoir with the engine running with an
approx 60% water 40% coolant mix.

Temp stabilized properly and no blinking light!

So I guess the newbie deserves 40 lashes for not knowing about such a basic
component!!

Thanks so much for your advice. Saved me a tow, and probably $90-100 at the
closest VW shop for them to top off the reservoir!!

Let me know when your in Northern NJ... drinks are on me!!

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; So I fill the empty resrvoir (the main one you fill behind the license
plate
&gt; &gt; ) with water to start with (thinking I'll add coolant next batch as the
&gt; &gt; water circulates). I start the engine, and let it run for a while,
thinking
&gt; &gt; the thermostat will open up the  valeve and coolant will start to flow.
But
&gt; &gt; after a few minutes of running, I see the heat start to creep up slowly,
but
&gt; &gt; steadily towards the top of the indicator, and I shut things down for
fear
&gt; &gt; of a seziure (probably paranoia, but I ain't taking chances!!).
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; Wait -- that's the wrong coolant tank to fill!  You want to fill the other
tank
&gt; -- the one with many hoses, blue cap, etc.  The level sensor is in the top
of
&gt; that tank (inside is a &quot;well&quot; to get this thing to blink when there is gas
&gt; present).  If the LED continues to blink more than 5 seconds after you
turn on
&gt; the key (you don't need to start it) then check this tank and sensor.  *I*
&gt; think VW did a good job on this cooling system, although overcoming the
long
&gt; distance to the radiator is hard (of course indy cars do this also). 
Normally,
&gt; you just keep the little *overflow* tank (the one behind the license plate
&gt; door) filled -- don't let it get empty, or you'll get air in the system. 
The
&gt; ring-around-the-engine-lid seems to help to get bubbles out of the system,
too.
&gt;  Normal maintainence is really simple --  changing the coolant is not so
&gt; simple, but doable.  You should plan on coolant changes once a year.
&gt; 
&gt; The level sensor is two wires dipped in the tank.  If you run too much
&gt; antifreeze, it doesn't conduct electricity, and blinks the LED.  I suspect
that
&gt; ALL water would make the sensor (but not your engine) very happy.  Use the
&gt; *minimum* amount of antifreeze the manual recommends. Anitfreeze does not
&gt; conduct heat very well, and only raises the boiling point of the water mix
&gt; slightly.  If you live in very cold places, you might consider running a
&gt; different mix summer and winter, but this means the pain of antifreeze
changes
&gt; twice a year.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Like any pro mechanic, I THEN break out the shop manual and read about
&gt; &gt; refilling the coolant (well after the fact!!). It describes the steps of
&gt; &gt; elevating the front of the vehicle, clamping hoses, opening up bleed
nuts
&gt; &gt; etc. Now I don't have my tools back East yet, so I don't have anything
to
&gt; &gt; elevate the van with (other than the jack), but I do follow the
procedures
&gt; &gt; with the bleed nuts. Coolant starts to run out of the radiator valve
bleed
&gt; &gt; nut (a bit bubbly but seems to subside), but no water which I added to
the
&gt; &gt; reservoir moves at all... and the temp still continues to rise rapidly.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; These engines warm up quickly.  Do you mean it overheats immediately? The
&gt; overflow tank water basically only moves when the engine cools down and
sucks
&gt; water in from this tank.  Also check the valve in the blue cap. Blowing
into
&gt; the little pipe where the hose to the overflow tank goes should make a
nice
&gt; duck call.  Sucking should block (not a one-way valve, but the sucking has
to
&gt; be at 15lbs/sq&quot; or so to release the valve).  A VW dealer can check this
for
&gt; you with the right tester.  If you need a new one, you should get the
whole
&gt; tank, which include the cap, the cap alone costs almost as much and these
tanks
&gt; need periodic replacement -- they crack.  A tiny (invisible) crack in this
tank
&gt; caused me grief!
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Soooooo..... I figure one of the following has occured:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 1) A nasty bubble has gotten into the cooling system and is preventing
&gt; &gt; coolant from circulating properly (although I had the coolant running
out of
&gt; &gt; the radiator bleed nut which would indicate some circulation is taking
place
&gt; &gt; ).
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 2) A blockage has occured somehow in the cooling system
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 3) Water pump has failed (but again, there seems to be some flow if its
&gt; &gt; flowing out of the bleed valve, and also there's no tell tale sounds or
&gt; &gt; coolant leak to indicate the pump has gone).
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 4) When the coolant sprayed around its shorted the temp sensor/coolant
senor
&gt; &gt; giving me a false overheat indication (highly unlikely but..)
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; There's no coolant leak since I replaced the hose.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; if you are talking about the &quot;little hose&quot; that i think you are (the
one
&gt; &gt; that
&gt; &gt; &gt; goes between the power steering pump belt, into the right side
cylinder
&gt; &gt; head)
&gt; &gt; &gt; that's an air-bleed hose. notice that it goes up to a &quot;loop&quot; around
the
&gt; &gt; engine
&gt; &gt; &gt; and that loop is connected to the coolant reservoir.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Hmm. don't know if we're talking about the same hose... The one I
replaced
&gt; &gt; is about 2&quot; long, and probably about 1 1/2&quot; - 2&quot; in diameter (its on the
&gt; &gt; right hand side of the engine, wedged between the power steering belts
and
&gt; &gt; the alternator belts.. in fact optimally you have to disconnect both
belts
&gt; &gt; to work on this small section of hose). Its not one of those 1/4&quot;
diameter
&gt; &gt; hoses which connects up at the engine compartment bleed valve..
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Anyway, I'd sure appreciate any tips about what may be going on (and
sorry
&gt; &gt; for the lengthy description but I thought it might shed some light).
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Damn VW sure made filling coolant a bitch.. do you have to go throuigh
all
&gt; &gt; this bleed valve stuff when your topping off coolant on an average day 
(in
&gt; &gt; other words when you haven't blown a hose or something)?
