_______________________________________________________________________________
Talked to a VWoA lady, described the problem, told her my 83' westy has only
61k original miles. Told her I got a repair bill dated 1991 when it was at 46k
and had the sysmptom of the leaking gasket. She said sorry VWoA is not going
to help me. She said VWoA will not help my old car for such a problem.

  If you enjoy the vehicle, bite the bullet and fix it on your own.
  No point in being irritated at VWoA or whoever it was you talked to
  on the phone.

  opinions regarding Volkswagens?)
