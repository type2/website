&gt;The absolute *best*
&gt;way to get a deal, IMO, is to go cruising around middle class
&gt;neighborhoods until you see a VW bus in someone's driveway or yard that
&gt;obviously has been sitting a while.  Knock on the door and ask them if
&gt;they will sell it.


Been there, done that... I call it &quot;bug-hunting&quot;, from back when I was
into bugs. I fully agree that it's effective.

Kinda difficult, though, for the guy in VA who wants to buy a rust-free
CA car... I was really aiming that post at out-of-staters.

BTW, when you bring a car from outside CA, into the state, and register
as a permanent resident, you have to pay a $300 fine 'cuz it doesn't
have CA smog equipment on it (yes, even if its emissions meet CA levels).
My question is, if you buy a car in CA and take it to some other state,
they DO pay you $300, right? ...right?

(that sound you just heard, was a pig on its takeoff run)

Steve Maher   smaher_at_gi_dot_com   '80 V6anagon, $300 poorer
                              '71 VW Transporter FS-- anyone wanna make
                                    a quick $300?

P.S. No, they don't. It was a JOKE.  OK? OK.   :^)
