&gt; Howdy gang... I could really use some advice....
&gt;
&gt; I was driving my 87 syncro westy home the other day.. about an hour
&gt; of highway driving. I came off the highway and stopped at a light.
&gt; When the light turned green I went to shift into first (I was in
&gt; third with clutch depressed), I couldn't get the shift out of gear
&gt; and into first.
&gt; &gt; Seriously I really could use some advice as to what to do. The van is
&gt; laid up and I am desperate to correct the problem and get it back on
&gt; the road.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks in advance!!

Hi: Sounds like the 2nd gear slider. You need a rebuild. I had mine done
for about 900$ with all new German bearings and wear parts.
