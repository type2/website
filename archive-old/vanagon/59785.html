Subject: Re[2]: (Fwd) Outrageous oil change prices

     But if you've ever had one of those cheapo 45$ oil changes and they 
     didn't re-torque your heads properly, you really understand the value 
     of 55$.
     
     You get what you pay for.  Pay for sodomy, get sodomy.



&gt;
&gt;Having said all this, I dunno how hard it is on a VW bus.
     
You need to remove the engine.
