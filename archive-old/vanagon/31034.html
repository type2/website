Subject: Pulling a boat

Felix, my 81 Westie with newly rebuilt engine and auto tranny, is running
fine at 2000 mi.  Question is:  I have a small boat.  Should I even think
about pulling it with Felix.  I'm out shopping for another vehicle
otherwise, and with only 2 of us in the house, one of the 3 existing
vehicles will have to go (probably my sweet lil RX7).  The boat is a 1960
Dorset fibreglass runabout foamed between the shells and refitted for scuba
diving with a 50 hp Johnson (70s vintage).  In all, I'm sure it's under
2000 lb towing weight.  Am I asking for trouble?  Appreciate any advice.
