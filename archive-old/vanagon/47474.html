Subject: Re: upgrading 86-up headlights

On this headlight topic I'd like to bring to the attention the H4 
Bulb.

  I installed these in my boss' 71 bus and he'll never use a regular 
halogen again!  

  The only thing to be careful of is that they're intended for off-road 
use only!  Well I've been using them in my 79 scirroco for the last 3+ 
years without a problem!  Only thing I did notice is if you flash 
someone slower than you to get them to move, don't hold them on too long 
or you'll Sunburn their neck!

  Thought I'd throw the H4 out ther and see what comes of it.
