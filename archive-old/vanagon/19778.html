Subject: Re: hot oil? How hot is TOO hot??
Date: Tue, 27 Jun 1995 10:42:54 -0700 (PDT)

Robb,
	Here are the temps I consider tolerable, FWIW.  I've come to use
these based almost solely on advice given in &quot;How to HotRod your VW&quot;,
which, despite the title, seems to be a great source of info on air
cooled VWs.  Don't take these temps as more than a data point, though -
they are just what I use for myself.

&gt; 1. What temp is &quot;tolerable&quot; so long as I change my oil at, say 1,500
&gt; mile intervals on this trip of 6-8000 miles?

230 F
 
&gt; 2. What temp is &quot;back off jack&quot;? (And how do you back off? Slow to 50.
&gt; Stop. Say a mantra while burning incense? Buy absolution?)

250 F

It seems that the faster the engine turns, the more the temp goes up
(at the gauge, which in my case is in the sump, not so good).  I
find that if I &quot;lug it&quot; at 50mph in 4th the oil temp will never go
up, but I know it is really hot in the journals, and suspect there
is not sufficient agitation in the sump to get the hottest oil down
to the sensor.  If I instead drive 48 in 3rd, the temp shoots way
up very fast - much too fast to be solely attributed to increased heat
output, presumably because the hot oil is now making it to the sensor.
But, the engine is now also generating more heat.  When I need to get the 
temp down, I downshift one gear and slow to an equivalent RPM.  This
usually equates to going from 55 in 4th to about 40 in 3rd, and that's
what I do.  I could hold a faster speed in 3rd, but it would just get
hotter.
 
&gt; 3. What temp is &quot;pull over this instant before you totally screw it all
&gt; up.&quot; (Before the pressure light comes on and the rods start playing 76
&gt; trombones....)

270 F

&gt; I have an external oil cooler, but the more I look at it, the more
&gt; concerned I become. I can't seem to fit it above the tranny. Just too
&gt; big. I could mount it amidships, but I'd have a LOT of line going to it,
&gt; and I'd have to put a heavy grate in front of it to protect it. Also,
&gt; I'm not sure how good the airflow would be unless I rigged a scoop or a
&gt; fan.
&gt; 
&gt; Finally, as best as I can tell, the &quot;inlet/outlet&quot; plate that screws in
&gt; place of the oil filter. (This is a 73 type IV) would have to have the
&gt; hoses pass below the tinwork on the undersideof the underside of the
&gt; cylinders. In other words, the hoses would be practically the lowest
&gt; point of the car. I'm not real thrilled about this last item...

I don't see why this would have to be the case.  Doesn't the plate go
above the filter?  Couldn't the hoses go inside (above) the tinwork?
