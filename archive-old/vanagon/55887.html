&gt;Shakin' n' shimmyin' down a long dirt road the other day I lost the center
&gt;silver colored knob of the hubcap on my '91 Syncro Westie.  Any clues as to
&gt;where I might find a replacement?

I wouldn't exactly call the alloy wheels &quot;hub caps&quot;......but it seems as if
you're talking about the center cap for the alloy wheels.
The're still available from the dealer for 9 bucks or so.

(well, by deductive reasoning, I figured you couldn't be talking about the
plastic full wheelcovers, because they have no removeable center cap....)
