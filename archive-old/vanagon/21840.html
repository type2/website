Subject:       Re: Bumper rubbers?

&gt; I'd like to try and find some replacement rubbers (the up and down type)
 else... My bus is a '72 by the way. Neither Parts Place, not West Coast
&gt; Metric has them available. Does anyone know of a source???

Have you tried the local pharmacy?  &lt;Sorry, couldn't resist...&gt;
