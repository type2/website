Subject: Re: T-shirts - a suggestion


Thought I'd pass along how T-shirts were done by one of my friends on
the rec.windsurfing news group.

One person on the list, Luigi Samanzarro (sp), thought it might be a good
idea to design a shirt so when we were at a sailing site, you would know
another sailor was a participant on rec.windsurfing.

He came up with 2 designs. One for the front and 1 for the back and then 
posted the designs in gif format to the group.

The neat thing he did was to include the email addresses of each person 
who expressed an interest in getting a shirt. (He also did sweat shirts).

The addresses were &quot;dropped out&quot; in courier typeface on the back design.

He was able to fit over a 100 addresses since they were just entered as 
lines of type and about 5 addresses could fit on a line.

for example, a line might read:
JWALKER_at_ua1vm.ua_dot_edu tobin_at_freenet.vancouver.bc_dot_ca busgirl_at_netcom_dot_com ja
ck_at_fortnet_dot_com RGOLEN_at_umassd_dot_edu &lt;and so on&gt;

Since it was done in a fixed width font, when the end of a line was reached,
the address simply continued on the next line.

It lent an additional sense of pride since each person felt some ownership
of the design. (Not to mention that my address was one on the top line :-).

So, this is just a suggestion, take it for what it is worth.
