Subject: Re: Remember those chips of metal....

When I rebuilt my 1700 some of  the cam bearings (one half only) were worn
through the top silvery layer to a coppery layer underneath.  I imagine at
this point things start to wear pretty quickly.

I  was suprised as well that only one of the bearing halves had a thrust
face (shoulder), but that's the way it was on the replacement bearings
also.

For $10 or whatever, I don't imagine we're getting the most hi-tech bearings

&gt; I _finally_ got around to finishing my engine teardown &lt;'74 1800cc type IV&gt;
&gt; and I've found the source of those pesky metal chips. It is the camshaft
&gt; bearings &lt;!&gt;. I find this very puzzling - I've had a lot of sh*tty old cars
&gt; over the years and this is the very first time I've seen camshaft bearings
&gt; give any grief at all. BTW, the rod and main bearings look just fine. The
&gt; cam itself shows wear, perhaps not unexpected in an engine with 108 kmiles
&gt; on it.
&gt;
&gt; The bearing material appears to be seperating from the shell backing, coming
&gt; off in chunks. The only one that isn't breaking up is the insert with the
&gt; flanges on it for thrust. That's another question I have: There are five
&gt; bearing inserts with out faces and only one with - is that normal? Intuitivly,
&gt; I would expect a pair with thrust faces. The engine is a rebuilt from VWOA,
&gt; done in early '80s.
&gt;
&gt; One hypothesis I have for this failure is that the case is distorted and
&gt; has caused the cam bearings to overheat. Another hypothesis is that they
&gt; are lousy cam bearings and have slowly been falling apart for years. I'd
&gt; appreciate hearing anyone else's thoughts on this. Has anyone on the list
&gt; experienced a similar problem?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt;
&gt; Dave
