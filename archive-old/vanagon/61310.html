&gt; I think that what you are looking for is a MultiVan not a Carat.  A carat
&gt; is just a luxurey version of the normal 7 passenger Vanagon.  The
&gt; MultiVan, Wolfsburg Westfalia Weekender in the older days ('86), has the
&gt; table, rear facing seats, closet, pop-top, but no sink or stove.  
I would have to disagree,

At an auto dealership near where i live they have an 88 carat automatic
for sale. (poorly maintained, interior stained, high miles, and they want
over 10k for it..)

it has rear facing jump seats, a convertible rear seat a table, and
alloys.  This sounds exactly as they described.  It has no poptop or
cabinets (they didnt mention wanting these...)

My $0.002

&gt; &gt; ur family has grown and our volvo wagon has not, therefore we'd like to add
&gt; &gt; a vanagon to clan.  We treat our cars as well as we treat our children and
&gt; &gt; would make good vanagon parents.  If anyone has a well cared for carat ready
&gt; &gt; to go to a new home, ours might be just the ticket.  We are interested in a
&gt; &gt; manual trans, good body, and well mechanically maintained vehicle. Our four
&gt; &gt; human children want the two rear facing jump seats with the fold down table
&gt; &gt; and front facing rear convertible bench.  Oh, and by the way we're in the NY
&gt; &gt; metro area (NJ).  I can be e-mailed at nutley_at_crossnet_dot_org  or NutleyARC
&gt; &gt; _at_aol_dot_com or phon either John or Tracy at 201-667-9121
