Subject: EV Cat

	My friends Ken and Charlotte have an EV, have had it for
a while, they haven't complained about this. GM's Camaro/Firebird
has a bump in the passenger seat floor for the cat. Every water cooled
VW I've owned had a catalyst under the floor and I certainly don't
have to run the air conditioning all the time. At 381,000 miles 
in aggregate, I think we'd have noticed this problem....

	Its important to remember that VW-Porsche_Audi management,
particularly in this country, is really fouled up. Dealer service
is also often fouled up. Possibly this induhvidual's engine is runing
*way* rich and the catalyst is functioning as an afterburner...

	Cheers, all!
	Bill
