&gt; Dropped by NAPA and they said $138.  Said I could also use a general 
&gt; purpose one if I wanted to do some wiring.  Uh...I donthinkso.
&gt; 
&gt; What's a reasonable price?  Ron?


Bosch makes the identical 02 sensor with a different plug on it, at a far
lower price.  You would have to cut the plug and splice on the correct
plug.  It really isn't as difficult as you think, since the wire color
coding is the same as on the Vanagon harness. (The '86-up sensor has three
color-coded wires; the '85-down has only one.)  The nice thing is that this
identical sensor is only $39.95 ($29.95 for the pre-'86 1-wire version),
and it is a Bosch, not a &quot;generic&quot; brand that may not quite match the Bosch
specs.  By comparison the Bosch sensor with the correct plug is $119.95
('86-up) or $69.95 (pre-'86).
