&gt;Reading some of the posts, I get the idea the people go mudslinging in the
&gt;syncros.  Is a syncros a real 4X4 kind of vehicle, like the toyata 4wd pu I
&gt;had?  I thought it was 4wd in the same sense as my dad's subaru legacy is a
&gt;4wd, i.e. better on road traction, no jumping logs and boulders.

In most situations the Syncro's off-road capability lies between the two.
 Much closer to the 4x4 truck capability than the Legacy's.  In some
situations, the Syncro makes a more capable off-roader than the Toyota 4x4
you mention.
