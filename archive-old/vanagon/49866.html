Subject: RE: source for cover, '90 westy

**eric states that it's not a good idea to cover a vehicle

i agree in part. it's not a good idea to cover a vehicle with certain non
breathable covers. it's a good idea to cover one with a breathable cover. i
don't see why it's not good to cover a vehicle with the right type of cover.
RMMW sells good covers that allows the vehicle to 'breathe' and discourages
mold, mildew, etc.
