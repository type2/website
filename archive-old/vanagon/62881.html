Hello Listees:

And thanks to all who provided moral, technical and even legal support in
response to my &quot;who knows?&quot; lug bolt post.  Thanks to Joel Walker who
drives even farther than I do for service. Thanks to Mark Keller who
advised me of the cost /theft motivation factor of those lugs as well as
dealership inside insights. I agree the mechanic himself is the least
likely suspect.  And Chris, yes the are alloys, and the black lugs make 'em
look really dowdy! and Bob, you can be I'll take it to the top.  And to
Steve Walker, now that I've found the list I intend to do more work myself,
but you are correct, time is a factor.
And thanks to Jack Bateman, I will indeed force the issue.  And Yes, Norman
Leong it really is 115 miles to my nearest dealership, I grew up in Salt
Lake City, Ut. Where VW's of all kinds are popular and plentiful.  But
where I now reside in Missouri they are somewhat scarcer and less loved -
just makes me appreciate mine more!  And finally, Thanks to Jeff in NYC,
you're a great judge of character man, seems we have more than vehicles in
common !

I know exactly how to procede now, I'll keep you all posted and yes Alex,
I will post the name of the dealership if I don't get satisfation.
