Volks,
	Since the camping trip was called off for this weekend, I had time
to visit the junkyards.  Threw the tools in DaBoat and cruised down near
the Mexican border where there are four, countem four big junkyards
where you pay a dollar to get in and the prices are real cheap.  I left
home at 8:45 and didn't get home till 5:30.  Needless to say, I found
quite a few busses there.  Since I hadn't been down there in around 6
weeks, everything was &quot;fresh&quot;.  Well, to me at least.
	I spent a total of around $140, and for that got the following:

Eberspacher BN4 gas heater (plastic vent cracked all to hell, not sure I
                            got everything that goes with it.  How the
                            heck does this thing work anyway?)
Norcold 12/110V refrigerator (seal and inner door panel missing)
Chrome front bumper w/black rubber strip
pair of nice black metal speaker grills
72-79 taillight lens
73-79 front turn signal lens
antenna
a million other little odds and ends
brass (copper) ring for horn
fill hose for washer fluid tank
left rear piece of engine tin

The last three are items I remembered people asking for on the list.  If
those people are reading now, e-mail me and I'll get the parts to you.

To say that I hit the mother lode of breadloaves today would be an
understatement.  I ransacked at least 20 busses, plus saw one split,
three Vanagons and a Vanagon westie.  One vanagon looked like it had been
hit by a train.  It was a front-left impact, and there is no way the
driver could have lived through it.  I don't see this as evidence that
the vanagon is unsafe, however, because just about any car would have
yielded the same result, this accident was so severe.  I also saw two
breadloaves that had burned.  Seems there is almost always one in one of
the yards.  There was so much bus stuff at the yards, I could have spent
a month's salary just stocking up on parts that I know I will need
someday.  Those of you who need things for your busses should do
yourselves a favor and drive to the nearest large city and check out the
junkyards.  They are a great source of parts.

I found yet another Safare Custom Camper, in the same junkyard and
even almost the same spot as the last one.  And it was even the same
color!  I thought I was hallucinating.  This one was #828 made in 7/74.
I got a table leg to replace mine which is kinda rusty, and a small tray
(removeable) that mounts under the glove box to hold drinks and food.
It's an original Safare piece.  Unfortunately, the fridge was in several
pieces and the propane tank was gone or I would have snagged that too.
I want a second tank.  This Safare was a high-top, and identical to mine
except for color and lack of air conditioning.  It was orange with tan
and yellow interior.  Not as bad as it sounds, really.

One thing I looked for but didn't find was a choke cover for my right
carb.  I have at least three left covers and no right ones and they are
not interchangeable.  That sucks.  Another thing that sucks - I dropped
my 13mm wrench into the top of one of the cylindrical steel
thingamjobbers that supports the junk cars while I was taking off the
bumper.  D'ohhh!  Kiss that wrench goodbye.  :(
