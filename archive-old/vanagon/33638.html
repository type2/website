Subject: Re: Proper Starting Procedure 

&gt;This thread seems to be developing into a discussion of the proper starting 
&gt;procedure for VWs.  I of course, am no expert and in the course of looking 

My '85 started when you turned the key, always, without touching the gas 
pedal, and warmed up fine any weather.
My '87 needs the pedal blipped as I turn the key or it won't fire readily or 
idle up decently.  This is worst in cold weather.

And your conclusions....  '85 was good, '87 has minor probs in FI system, 
likely part of the idle circuit.

and my '72 dual used to start every time by stomping the pedal to the floor 
while cranking, pumping raw gas through both accelerator jets down its throat :)

PS:  When starting trans is in neutral AND clutch to the floor, always, all 
weather, FWIW
