Subject: Re: new van, inspect'n &amp; warrnty questions

&gt;&gt;I have heard bad reviews of the VW synchro from mechanics and owners.  
&gt;&gt;Apparently the cylinder heads are flakey.
&gt;
&gt;This *post* is flakey! 
&gt;
&gt;The cylinder heads are the same between syncros and non-syncros so this
&gt;makes no sense. Also, most bad reviews are either self depricating humor or
&gt;syncro owners trying to make everyone else feel better about owning a lowly 
2WD.
&gt;
&gt;Post what ye know, not what ye muddled brain dredges up from the mire.
&gt;
&gt;Uh... 
&gt;
&gt;..I feel impish today, I guess...

Flakey or not, I know somebody with synchro who had to pay quite a bit of 
money to repair her cylinder heads.  I stand by the statement regardless of 
any (w)imps out there.
