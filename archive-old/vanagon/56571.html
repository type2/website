&gt;I don't know how much you want to spend, but theyre's a company out in AZ
&gt;called Street Beat that makes sliding (microbus style) ragtop sunroofs in any
&gt;size you want. Pricey, but they look cool....


Alternatively you can look for a junked Renualt Fuego (R-18?) with a black
heavy nylon rollback roof.  Opening is about 4 feet by 3 feet, huge, and
roof folds back accordian style.  Nice thing is these are totally self
contained power roofs.  The frame is fully stainless steel, contains the
gear tracks and the motor unit is within the sliding section. Just add a
rocker switch for open/close. Interior colour is medium brown, so-so colour,
has ample mouldings to hold/cleanup headliner cut.

 Cutout in roof is simple flat edge (although Renault roll a short right
angle lip), no work beyond sawing/priming and about 30 small holes for
bolts.  They just fit between the two end roof ridges, cutting out the
centre one. They extend beyond the small dips in the centre ridge, so
fiddling would be required.  Anyone near me want to buy one?  Found the
Westy kit before I got it installed.  Tim
