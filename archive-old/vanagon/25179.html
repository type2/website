Subject: center brake light question


Thom:

I have seen your restoration pictures on the web.... great job!  I have
questions about what you responded to Michael Heron:  you wrote..


&gt;'57s that claim that they were factory.  The clue to whether or not a
&gt;center brakelight is &quot;correct&quot; (not you Michael, just in general) is 2 sets
&gt;of wires coming out of the loom at the top/rear/center of the engine compartmen&gt;instead of just one.  The one set is for the licenseplate light, the second is
&gt;for the brake light.  There will also NOT be a brake light circuit in the
&gt;two tail lights.  This means you should also have &quot;bubble&quot; tail lights.  The



I just obtained a '56 panel and really haven't looked to much at the circuitry.
Does you reply to Michael imply that only the center brake light is used for
braking signaling?  Also, does the '56 or the '57 have the bubble tail lights
that you spoke of.  I noticed in your resoration job that you took out the
center brake light on the deck lid and you put in smaller tail light lenses.
Are these the &quot;bubble&quot; lenses for the '56?  Also in your restoration you put
on amber/red? bullet lenses on the front turn signals that are smaller than
the common cone-type.. are these also '56 or are they earlier?  Thanks
