Subject: Westy w/o engine


I posted one yesterday about this '83 Westy that I may purchase that has no
engine.  It was a water cooled originally.  My question, never having owned
a water cooled, what is the consensus regarding the type of engine I should
put in--water or air?  Is there another option for this year?  Is there a
specific manufacturer of engines that I should look for and others I should
avoid?  BTW, I live in the LA area.  TIA.
