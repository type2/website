Subject: Running diesels rich

I run my Vanagon diesels pretty rich, mainly for power---but the
down side is plenty of smoke.

On the back of the pump (where the 4 lines to the injectors come out)
there is a slotted screw and a 13mm nut that tightens it up.

Start the engine, let it idle.  Lossen the bot, turn the screw inward,
which will make the engine run a bit richer.  The idle may go up, so
be prepared to set the idle back down.

Take the vehicle for a drive, watch the amount of smoke pouring out the
back, but you should see a considerable power increase.

Just keep your foot off the floor, (G)
