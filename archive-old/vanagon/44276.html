Subject: Re: CB placement

&gt;To all of you bus owners with CBs, where did you mount them?  Please note the
&gt;year of you bus/vanagon so I picture the dash setup.

&gt;
        After seeing all these locations listed, and after thinking of all
the holes in my already mangled (by the PO!!) bus, I've opted for the
handheld variety. Got one for $49, coming next week via UPS ground. Since
it's handheld, I need not purchase an external antenna, and it is easily
transferred from car to car, or left at home. Seemed like the most sensible
way to go.

Peace,
