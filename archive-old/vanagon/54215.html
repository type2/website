Howdy.....

We are ready to make a life long dream into reality.  We are going to bite the 
bullet and buy a Eurovan...for better or for worse....

What is a good price for a used 95 automatic with 50,000 km or 32,000 miles.  
It would be an automatic with full camper conversion.

How much for a new 97 eurovan.

Thanks for your help!

The nervious wannabes.
