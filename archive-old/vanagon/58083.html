Subject:      stoopid statz: one last comment :)

thanks for all the feedback, folks. i've been really surpised at all the
replies, mostly &quot;hey! how come i wasn't listed?&quot; or &quot;you did this wrong!&quot;
or just a few hundred people owning up to what and where they drive. :)

but some comments made me think that lots of you think that Unca Joel
RUNS the list. no so. :) i'm just the ornery old Stat-Keeper.

Gerry Skerbitz runs the list, keeping it going at all hours of the week,
sitting up with it when it's sick, watching it play in the yard, etc. :)
he's the poor sap who got conned into starting the list three years ago
 almost to the month. (gee. i wonder WHO could have conned him like that??)
:)

so those warm feelings of comfort and delight at having a bus list to
be part of go directly to Gerry (and his school, who lets him run the
list on their machine). :)

me? i'm just a state worker who had a couple of years when nobody knew what
i did. ;)  unfortunately, some ratfink squealed (and if i find out which
one of you it was, i'm gonna flatten your tires!!) and i now have &quot;real&quot;
work to do every day. :(  but i can still keep up with the list at night! ;)

hope you found the added stat-trash in your email box interesting. :)

ye olde Stat-keeper
