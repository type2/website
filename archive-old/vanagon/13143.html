&gt; Hi Harry, thanks for the advice. I actually try to find Yokohama Y370 as
&gt; you have suggested in the past on the list (was it by you?). I have not 
&gt; found it yet. It sure sounds a very good choice. Except one question, the tire

Hi David.  I am in BC, and purchased these tires through the Big-O 
chain.  They are available at most tire dealers here.  Even Costco 
carries Yokohama's (not sure about the Y370 specifically).  Keep 
looking, they are worth checking out... BTW, I'm not affiliated with 
any tire shop or Yokohama eventhough it may sound that I am :)

&gt; size 195/75 is a little wider and bigger (in diameter) comparing to the 
&gt; original 185/75. I actually compared a Uniroyal LT 195/75R14 with 185/75R14
&gt; found found it to be an inch taller. I guess my vanagon can run at a bit higgher
&gt; speed.

I believe Joel created a chart a little while ago regarding outside diameters 
of various profiles, etc.  It is true that going to the LT195 will 
alter a few things.  1.  They are one cm wider.. better handling 
benefits there.  2.  Yes, they are a bit taller as well (not sure if 
it's as much as an inch.. have to check Joel's notes).  I didn't 
notice any real significant gearing change with the Syncro.  It's a 
bit taller, but didn't slow me down on all the mountain passes I go 
on.  3. Nobody out here stocks a reinforced 185/75 other than a 
Continental.  The Michelin has a very soft sidewall, even with the 
XCH4 series, and they aren't heavy enough to support the added weight 
of the Syncro Camper.  The Michelin load rating is for approx 1325 
lbs, whereas the Y370 goes up to 1765 lbs.

&gt; What's the price did you pay for the Y370?

I paid $480 (CDN) balanced, installed, new valves stems in March/93
for a set of 4.

Hope this info helps.

Harry.
