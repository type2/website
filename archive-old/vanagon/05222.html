You see, Dan.  The list is more than the sum of its parts, and, though in 
some ways having it available via netnews would make it better, in others 
it would make it worse, and in the end, as the ruling tyrant, I choose to 
maintain the personality of the list the way it is.  You just heard from 
a few of the most verbose posters (the people who make the list so busy 
that you wish to heck it was a newsgroup) and most of the rest qualify as 
full or part-time lurkers.
I'd really rather the list didn't get cluttered up with this discussion 
so:

       End of disucssion.

And now back to the discussion of ...  what was it we were talking about?
