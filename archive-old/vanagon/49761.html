I notice on your page that David Heard does'nt have an E-mail link. He 
probably does'nt want to be inundated with mail concerning his non- existent 
club and newsletter that he still steals money from people for. Mr. Heard, if 
by chance you read or hear of this message, Pound some California sand up your 
A**. Have a nice day!  Tom Czerniak

I added a bunch of cool stuff to my web site today:

* New Hall of shame entries, including a pic of SOTO President Dave Heard
and all his 17 or so busses.  Now you know where the money goes...

* Pic of Charlie Hamill's ladder truck

* Pix of Todd Olmstead's '55 Deluxe

* Pix of Ed Hughes' (sp) '53 Deluxe
