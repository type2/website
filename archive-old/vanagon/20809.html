Subject: A lurker revealed, names, antenna question


Good morning, all:

I have been lurking on this fine list for a couple of months...and have found
this group informative, charming, and generally a group that I wish I was a
member of...

We got Grandma back (the name? One black night 18 months or so ago, some
vandals
roughed up my white unnamed '72 westy...scratches, broke a mirror or two, tore
off the gas door...and my son said &quot;that's as bad as mugging someone's
grandma! And it stuck...) from the body shop...She's beautiful! Lotsa bondo,
to be sure, but for now, the body is very good, and the paint is very good. I
am delighted...although now I have to start on the interior (engine and tranny
are excellent, so far...).

The question: in their attempt to fill all of the (many, many) holes, the
bondo kings filled where the radio antenna was... the job was so good, I am
clueless as to where to put it. Can anyone tell me where the antenna goes on a
stock '72 westy? I know it is on the front...Front right, near the windshield,
but if anyone has the rough (or precise) measurements, I would appreciate it!
