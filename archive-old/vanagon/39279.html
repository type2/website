You probably didn't get one of your valve covers seated properly. You 
couldn't develop an oil leak by moving engine with distributer out. If it's 
leaking puddles of oil, it must be from the valve covers. Easy fix, just 
take the offending cover off and reseat it properly. Did you use new 
gaskets?
