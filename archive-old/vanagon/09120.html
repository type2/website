Subject: Eurovan Camper

I just saw a Eurovan camper much in the same line as a Westfalia, but 
with some nice touches. The interior done by Winnebago. This is NOT the 
Rialta (sp?), but a true camper. More crowded than the 80's Westys, but a 
very nice unit - at $33+K it should be!!!
Anyone have some camping experience with this unit? The salesman said 
that they had NO information or manuals on the unit. Didn't have a clue 
how to make things work. I offered to take it out and try everything, but 
he didn't think that was an especially good idea. 

One particularly good idea was that it has a 5 gal. propane tank. Does 
anyone know of an acceptable modification of the Vanagon models to 
replace that dinky 3 gal tank with something larger?

Happy New Year all - Jack &amp; Vera
