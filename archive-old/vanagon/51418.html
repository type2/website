Subject: Re: Diesel questions/engine swaps etc.

&gt; 
&gt; 1. What year(s) did the turbo diesel jettaand/or rabbit  sell in the US?
Rabbit '84 (and maybe '83, not sure)
Jetta - '82-92 using same 1.6 from at least 84 on.
Golf '85-92.
&gt; What 	displacement?
1.6litre for all except maybe early 82-83 models. All Golf/Jetta 
models are engine code MF, with hydraulic lifters added in late '86. 
Same code used for hydr, look for sticker on valve cover to indicate 
hydraulic. Also 1V engine code used for &quot;eco-diesel&quot;. I don't think 
this was sold in Canada, so I've never seen one. Less power &amp; complex 
exhuast, so I would avoid it.
&gt; 2. Has any one installed one of these in a diesel vanagon?
Several list members have; they will likely reply.
&gt; 4. Will a diesel bellhousing fit on a waterboxer trans?
Apparently it will.
&gt; 5. What is the ideal trans for a gas engine swap into a diesel vanagon
&gt; (just curious-I 	would prefer a turbo diesel conversion-maybe a
&gt; TDI aahhh).
The TDI would be preferable to nearly any gas engine, if you could 
find one, of course.
&gt; 6. I've heard the Audi 5000 5sp trans is very similar to the vanagon
&gt; trans. Is this a 	suitable tranny donor? I bought a complete 5000
&gt; wagon w/ a 5sp for $800 	last year but just sold it a couple of
&gt; months ago. 
&gt; 7. What about an Audi 5000 Turbo swap?
Not sure, but I suspect you'd find too many difference in 
intake/exhuast positions. Golf/Jetta engines are much more common, 
and the audi is almost identical.
&gt; BTW I used to build BMW racecars so fabrication and mechanical work are
&gt; not problems.
Good Luck.
