&gt; Dammit Janet, I go into the weekend with no electricity still. I
&gt; really hope I have some for the niners/cowboys game on Sunday!! I
&gt; mean, if I lived in a VW bus I would at least have a fridge and heater
&gt; to make me comfy.

I think you meant the Chargers/Steelers game, right?  Who would want to
watch the niners?  What a boring team...   :)
&gt; 
&gt; No one has given me an update on the Copley's travels, doesn't someone
&gt; know where they are?! I also need to apologize to them...my roommate
&gt; was a dick to them when they stayed over on Sunday - I can't apologize
&gt; *for* him (especially since he meant to be a dick), but I can
&gt; apologize for not telling him to shut the f*ck up and kicking his ass.

Well, I was expecting to hear from them before now, but they haven't
contacted me.  Maybe it was because I mentioned that they could help me
move this weekend.  They also could have gotten stuck somewhere, since
the flooding has closed some roads.

While I've got yer attention, I got my pictures back from the trip, and
while many of the night ones didn't come out well, there are some
interesting shots, including one of the half-eaten 24 egg omlette!  I
will try and scan them later today and have them on the web by this
evening.
