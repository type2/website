&gt;&gt;That's your brain, man! Oops, I mean your Vanagon's brain :). Be good to
&gt;&gt;it, it's veeerrry expensive.

&gt;What does this mean?  I'm all for preserving the synaptic moment but what does
&gt;this thing think about as I'm sporting down the road?  What is it called and
&gt;does it have anything to do with power regulation or battery charging?
&gt;
In Bentley terms, it's the fuel injection control unit. See pp 24.48. As
far as I know it has nothing to do with power regulation or battery
charging.
