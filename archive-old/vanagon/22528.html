&gt; Since we are on the subject of bench seats my '65 bus's
&gt; rear bench seat is in 2 pieces. The back cushion is detached
&gt; from the seating cushion. Seems to me they should be attached!
&gt; (My middle seat is in one piece)
&gt; 
&gt; Should the rear seat be one piece and, if so, how can I
&gt; attach these two separate cushions?
&gt; 
Mine was separate in my '67, and actually in my '78 as well...
