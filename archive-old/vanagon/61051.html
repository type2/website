Subject: Front Differential FS


	Alright here is the rest of the information about the front
differential for sale .  It is located at:

	Blake's Small Car Salvage
	2559 Rd 5
	Erie CO 80516
	1-800-665-4326
	EMail is djm_at_indra_dot_com

The guy that you want to talk to is Dave Moore he will be able to answer
all your questions.  The syncro that it is off of is in very good
condition.  A lot of it's parts are now on my Westfalia, and it's
transmission is up in Canada with fellow listee Tim Smith.  Engine sold, I
bought the exhaust and alloy wheels:), but other than that everything is
there...I think.
	So they open at 8am MDT.  I'm sure that it will be firat come
first serve.  Good luck everyone, and be sure to tell him I sent you.
Thanks:)

Cory
