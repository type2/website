Subject: T4 Engine Overhaul

Aaron,


Regarding your questions:

First off, you may yet have an 1800cc engine.  Your message didn't make it
clear that you were reading the serial number from the engine rather than the
blower housing.  Bus gets bumped in the ass, they swap blower housings.  

If the CB serial number you cited is on the right-hand half of the engine
casing to the rear of the oil breather box, you only know it started life as
a 1700... but the thing is old enough to vote.  It could have been overhauled
as an 1800, which involves nothing more than opening up the heads to accept
the 93mm jugs and is a very common mod, with sets of 1700 jugs often very
hard to find.

So that's a baseline you want to nail down:  'What engine am I working with?'
Best bet is to clean one of the pistons, if they aren't too badly damaged.
You should be able to read the size stamped in the top.  But mebbe not.

The whole point here is that if you have 1800 cc heads and plan to reuse
them, then you need 1800 cc jugs.  Ditto for the 1700's but be damn sure the
heads are reusable.

Split-case engines are a little tricker than mono-blocs, and air-cooled's
have their own suite of tricks to play on you.  But if you know a box-end
from a crows-foot, you should do okay.

Your inventory of new parts sounds okay but I think you'd be wise to use
swivel-foot adjusters rather than stock.  They wear much, much slower,
maintaining proper valve lash for thousands of additional miles between
adjustments.   Another money/engine saver is a CDI module.  I've posted
several 'sermons' on each of these subjects.  

You didn't mention oil pumps.  If yours is badly scored, replace it.  A
high-volume pump for the Type I will fit/work just fine.  (Type IV pump is
about $130, Type I about $30.  Laws of economics apply.)  Just make sure you
get the type that mates with your cam gear.

Nor did you mention a clutch disk.  It is part of the engine assembly and you
have to drop the engine to replace it.  Best do it when you overhaul the
engine.

Now let's do the quiz, one by one.

1.  The cost of balancing varies by geographic area and by the quality of
shops within a given area.  I get my engines balanced at the same shop that
does aircraft and racing engines.  He charges $250 for a four-cylinder, three
for a six and whatever the market will bear for a V8.  He does the pistons &amp;
rods as well as the rotating components.  Eleven miles away there is a
balancer set up in the machine shop of a tractor &amp; pump maintenance outfit
(pumps are always balanced).  He charges fifty bucks per engine, rotating
components only, but can take up to a month to get around to the job.

Let your fingers do the walking.  Balancers advertise, just like hookers and
politicians :-)  Call around, get their prices.  Make a list.  Then talk to
speed shops, ask who they recommend and why.  Best thing to do is find a real
engine builder in your area, ask him.  Hint:  The older he is, the better.
When it comes to Volkswagens there's always a lot of 'instant experts' around
any college town.  (You're about to join their ranks :-)

2.  Stems of the valves, not shafts.  Valve stems, rocker shafts.  They are
called poppet valves and their shape dictates the use of stem rather than
shaft.  I don't know why.

Yes, stem seals are  the sign of a quality overhaul but for an odd reason.  A
freshly overhauled engine doesn't need them.  Their benefit becomes obvious
as the guides accumulate wear, when they serve to reduce the amount of oil
sucked down the intake guides and blow-by via the exhaust valve guide.  Of
course, by the time the engine has that much wear no one wants to pull the
springs to install the seals.  So the good rebuilders install them as a
matter of course at overhaul time.  

Type IV engines are known to eat their young.  And their valve guides. So use
new guides.  And install stem seals, although the engine will get you to
California and many miles beyond without them.

3.  You can use #518 sealant on the whole thing if you wish.  Or Permatex #3
(the soupy black stuff).  I tend to use #2 Permatex on steel and cast iron,
the modern stuff on aluminum and magnesium, mostly because one cleans up
better than the other. The truth is, If your parting-line surfaces are dead
flat, no dings or nicks or puckers around the studs, any good thin-layer
sealant will work,  but you must avoid filled sealants, such as #1 Permatex,
or any of the RTV compounds.  They form too thick a layer.  

But with the Type IV it isn't the parting line sealing that's a problem but
the bolts, which are more numerous than on upright engines.  Use #3 Permatex
on your washers when you bolt-up and you'll usually have a leak-free engine,
no matter what they tell you :-)

4. The Type IV is an aluminum casting.  It doesn't use paper gaskets between
the base of the cylinders and the crankcase.  Type I engines are magnesium.
The gasket was meant as much for corrosion control as for sealing.  I use #2
Permatex on the spigot shelf.  I've also used RTV compounds here when the
spigot bore was a bit loose.

5.  Go down to the local FLAPS and get yourself a tube of moly CV joint
grease.  Use it for your assembly lube.  But don't overdo it.  Nice, even
coating on all bearing shells, brush it into your gear teeth, put some on a
paper towel and roll your tappets in it until they are uniformly coated.
Pre-lubing is more important than most people realize.  Don't trust Vasoline
or motor oil.  The one is too thick, the other too thin.  Reserve the use of
motor oil for installing the pistons into the jugs, and even then, don't
overdo it.  Assembly should leave the part neat and clean.  Also, clean.  And
don't forget to keep things clean.  Work in a clean area.  Wear clean
clothes.  Work alone.  Do not permit distractions.  Work with the parts layed
out in a logical fashion so that a missed step is immediately obvious.  And
be sure to keep things clean, including your hands.  Keep a pint of lacquer
thinner near at hand, plus paper toweling.  Clean up any mess immediately and
don't feel shy about taking frequent breaks.  A properly assembled engine
will give twenty years of normal service, a few minutes here or there during
assembly is time well spent if it insures a proper assembly.

It's vital that you work with clean hands and tools, for they are the vectors
of contamination.  Keep your tools neatly layed out but in two distinct
areas, those you are using immediately to hand keeping others at a distance.
Wipe your tools down frequently, ideally after each use.  While this sounds
excessive, forming the habit of wiping a tool beflore laying it down is one
of those odd little insurance items.  A clean tool can not contaminate the
work.  The act of wiping the tool and laying it down defines its location in
your muscle memory, you hand will find it without hesitation when next it's
needed.

This will sound odd but you really do more of the engine assembly in your
head than on the bench.  For that reason it's important to keep your head
neat, uncluttered and clear.  
6.  Yes, you may check end play with feeler gauges.  But such methods are
only as accurate as your tools, which with feeler gauges isn't very accurate,
which makes the point moot.  Tom Wilson describes a handy feeler gauge method
in his excellent &quot;How To Rebuild Your Volkswagen Aircooled Engine,&quot; which you
should have on hand when you begin assembly.  The wiser course is to use a
dial indicator for checking/setting end-play.  As an ME student, you should
have a clock to play with anyway :-)  During pre-assembly you'll find a dial
indicator valuable for checking cam lift and gear lash in your valve train
and wear in your valve guides -- a clock is a basic tool for engine assembly
and a good-enough one costs less than twenty bucks.  Cheep.  I've mentioned
their use and listed sources in several of my 'sermons.'   I think you would
be wise to save money in another area. 

End of Quiz  (How'd we do?)


Tips &amp; Hints?   Keep things clean.  Take care of your tin-ware.  Make sure
the thermostat is working and properly installed.  Tune your carb with the
help of an oxygen sensor.  Change your oil before it needs it.  Make sure
your tin-ware isn't leaking -- good spark-plug seals, etc.  Make sure your
engine compartment is as air-tight as you can make it, good hatch seal,
engine seal and good grommets on all cables entering the compartment.  Be
especially careful to seal the alternator and use a new boot on that tricky
elbow fitting.  It likes to break. 

Chase all of your threads, clean the crud out of them.  Use new hardware if
you can find it.  (Those little cheese-head screws are 6x1.00 mm, lotsa
places carry them.  Ditto for warpy washers.)

Proper washers, loctite, safety wire -- are all cheap insurance.  Get into
the habit of using them.

Deal with the engine in a professional manner.  Pay strict attention to
details, especially cleanliness during assembly and a good fit/finish on your
tin-ware.  Use oven cleaner to remove the grease from the tin-ware, paint
remover to strip the paint, elbow grease and sand paper to remove the rust.
Straighten any parts that are bent, replace any nuts that are missing, weld
any cracks and patch any holes.  Then lay on a good coat of red primer and a
couple of coat of gloss black.  The results will look professional and that
will give others the clue.  Engines are managed chaos, things to be
respected.

When rewiring, solder and crimp all of your terminals.  Throw away those
crappy plastic collers on crimp-on electrical fittings.  Use graduated layers
of heat-shrink tubing.  And tear that computer connector outta there!  It's a
monument to bad engineering.  Scrub down the engine compartment until it
shines then give it a coat of wax.  Keep it clean enough to eat off of.  A
clean engine compartment makes inspection, maintenance and repair much
easier.  Anyone can driver a booger... and most people do.  

If your battery cables are corroded, replace them.  Shave the new terminals
to a perfect fit on the posts and put down acid getters before you install
the terminals.  A gas-tight connection not only handles more power, it is
less likely to corrode.  Neutralize any corrosion in the battery tray with
baking soda but keep it to hell away from the battery.  With the acid
neutralized, use a phosphoric acid compound to convert the rust into ferric
phosphate then seal it good with anti-rust primer.  No sense painting; it's
just going to do it again.  But an acid-getter pad, either the milspec cloth
stuff or the impregnated paper you'll find at a FLAPS is a wise precaution
under the battery.  Use a bungee chord to keep the battery from moving
around.

When the engine is out of the vehicle is your only chance to check your fuel
tank straps and vents.  On a 22 year old vehicle, such a check makes good
sense.  The firewall plate over the fuel tank has four concealed screws that
you can only get at from the bottom, the middle two through holes in the
tranny mount.  Search them out, see if they'll come free -- but think about
how you're going to replace them before you do the deed -- you need a
Phillips screwdriver that will grip the screw, allowing you to insert it.
The other screws are obvious.  Check the rubber couplings of the vent hoses
for signs of leakage and replce them if needed.  The main filler neck and
overflow vent are accessible through the large round pie-pan just forward of
the battery.  And if the pie-pan is missing, fabricate a replacement.

If you plan to install a booster relay for the starter solenoid, placing it
just beside the alternator's voltage regulator would make for a neat lay-out.

When you put things back together be sure the aux heater fan is properly
ducted to the engine.  There are flapper valves in the fan housing that
prevent your cooling air from escaping through the auxiliary fan via the
ducts.  No ducts, big leak, engine runs hotter than it should.  You may not
notice this during cold weather (although I wonder why anyone would not want
a heater, if only for demisting), but it can be an engine-killer in the
summer time.

Since you're starting with new jugs, you may wish to read my 'sermon' on
cleaning &amp; painting them.

If you don't have a test stand, promise yourself you'll drop the engine and
retorque the heads after no more than 300 miles.  This is perhaps the most
important part of your break-in cycle, after the oil/flush/change routine.

Balancing is some of the smartest money you can spend.  Besides running
smoother, a balanced engine runs cooler.  If you've never been in Yuma in
July, you've not gotten acquainted with HOT.   Your engine spends much of its
life in 'Yuma'.   It needs all the help it can get.

Good luck with it.  Sounds like it's going to be a fun trip.  Keep me posted
on your progress, engine and otherwise.  (It's not just an engine, its an
adventure :-)

PS -- Re-reading this I seem to have mentioned tin-ware a few too many times.
Or did I?

The average driver would not tolerate a leaky radiator; a puddle of coolant
beneath a wasserboxer triggers an herioic response to seek out and destroy
the salesman.  Or the leak.

Yet when it comes to air-cooled Volkswagens I see almost daily examples of
otherwise mechanically astute owners who shrug off huge holes in their
tin-ware -- in their engine's cooling system -- as things of no importance,
not worth their while to repair.

I've a hunch such people assume that since there is an unlimited supply of
'coolant' a few leaks don't matter.  If that is the logic behind their
thinking I hope you can see the flaw, and pray they never go down to the sea
in ships  :-)  -- rsh
 
PPS -- A thought to keep in mind.  As a student of Mechanical Engineering
much of your educational task is rote-work, mental regurgitation.  But if you
keep notes of this engine overhaul, and if those notes clearly illustrate the
proper formulation of questions, the search for answers and a concise
description of the process involved, your overhauled engine will fulfill
certain requirements of your education.  To reap the benefit of having
fulfilled those requirements you must petition your instructors in a clearly
worded letter outlining the project and its goals.  If they are educators
instead of 9-to-5 drones they will respond with certain tasks for you to
accomplish and report upon completion of the overhaul.  

To make it work you need a 'hook' such as 'Comparison of Power Enhancements
Resulting from Volumetric and Dynamic Balancing of a 1970's Era Powerplant.'
Or...  something else.  (Ask the list.  With nearly 600 minds at work there's
no problem that can't be solved.  Or confused :-)

The bottom line is, at the very least, a certain enhancement of your grade --
assuming the damn thing doesn't throw a rod the first time you fire it up.
But be careful.  Doing a professional overhaul can mark you for life, as can
writing a coherent account of it.  Look what happened to Tom Wilson, Bill
Fisher and all the others.  Building race cars.  Flying airplanes...   Awful
way to go through life, people giving you money for doing something you would
have done for free if they'd asked you nice.  Terrible fate in store for
Aaron, the Air-cooled Engineer :-)
