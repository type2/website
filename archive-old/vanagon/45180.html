Subject: Eurovan Camper How Much$ ?

I bought a EV MV when I really wanted the Westphalia conversion available
in the rest of the world. I first saw the Winnebago conversions stickered
at 32K and I just saw a listing for them at 28K.  Still a huge massive
chunk of change.  Anyone on the list have one and care to share how much
they really cost.  I loved my 82 Vanagon conversion (even though it was
cursed) and the EV is now too small to camp in since  baby has arrived.
