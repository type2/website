 So, I assume it's a 1987 VanagonGL Westfalia camper. &gt;&gt;

Ok. I have spoken w another listmember w/ an '89 full GL westy and his
doesn't have the filler tracks in the floor either. 

But they did in '85 on the full GL westys. 

so somewhere between '85 and '87 the florr tracks were dropped (why, I don't
know - It seemed like a neat Idea to be able to pop out those filler plates
and slide in a seat, buy VW works in mysterious ways... (kind of like taking
away the glovebox on the first Jetta III's....)

so I apologise for insinuating that your '87 westyGL had the tracks, when it
obviously doesn't.

I was wondering if other listmembers could go and check under your cargo
floor mats and letsee if we can come up with the years the westy middle seat
floor tracks were available.

So, westy GL owners, go look under your mats and report what you find to the
list.
