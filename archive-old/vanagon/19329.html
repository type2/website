&gt;From: Veeduber_at_aol_dot_com

&gt; The generic nature of hydraulic seals also applies to O-rings, filters,
&gt; fasteners and every type of bearing and bushing.  If you'll take the old part
&gt; to the right counter it can usually be cross-referenced to a current part
&gt; number and source.  The trick is finding the right counter.  In most large
&gt; cities a good place to start is at the oldest independent auto-parts house;

Bob brings up an interesting point on getting parts that aren't made any more.
We have done the same thing for other cars.  Hoses can be custom made by taking
them to a hydraulic hose place or bearings obtained from a bearing store.
Usually these places are located in the older, industrial parts of 
towns/cities.  They can be found in the yellow pages but most likely to have
just an entry instead of an ad.  Another place for references is the heavy
equipment/truck parts dealers.  We did that for getting custom made a/c lines.
Going this way is also much cheaper than the dealer or FLAPS.
