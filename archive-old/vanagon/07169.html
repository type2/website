Subject: Re: Adjust Battery LED Pot

Just to reiteterate: the info from Hayne's which stimulated this thread
initially; states that: the green LED functions at 12.5 volts and above;
the yellow below 12.5 volts and the red between 12.5 volts and 12 volts.
So both Harmon and Derek are right: a battery below 12 volts is in danger
of not being able to start the car, still it seems that 12.5 and above is
sufficient and perhaps a little less would be ok...DC

&gt; &gt; &gt; You all know that 11.9 volts is a dead battery; 12.25 is half charged, and
&gt; &gt; &gt; 12.6 is fully charged, right? 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;     No, that's not true. A battery in good shape, fully charged would 
&gt; &gt; read about 13.5 volts, not 12.6. Any battery that only reads 12.6 after
&gt; &gt; a good charging-up is ready for retirement. And anything reading only
&gt; &gt; 12 or less is junk. In fact, I wouldn't dream of keeping any battery
&gt; &gt; this time of year that read anything less than 13v after a charge.
&gt; 
&gt; Harmon,
&gt; 	I think you will find that as soon as you attach a small load
&gt; to that battery, or leave it sit for a few hours, the voltage will drop
&gt; down to around 12.7.  I wasn't sure of this myself until I got a decent
&gt; digital multimeter.  The 13.5 reading that one gets briefly after charging
&gt; a battery is pretty meaningless.  I have had old batteries that read 13.5
&gt; after a charge, but dropped to 10.5 (or less) within a few minutes when they
&gt; were put under a 5 amp load (da fridge).
