So Harvey Chao says:
&gt; Ice!  Crushed Ice!  many uses - cooling drinks, keeping food cold in an ice

Another good thing for you folks that are overheating in your cabs with no
AC is to carry along a medium sized spray bottle.  When you're hot, just give
yourself a few sprays and enjoy the wonderful effects of evaporative cooling.
That's what your sweat was doing in the first place but for some reason, the
spray bottled water is much more effective.  For those of you in the humid
regions of the world...well, I know I would have AC.  I just can't stand
humidity. :[   

&gt; back and check the rag.  In my experiences, a crack at the bottom of the
&gt; filler tube will result in an oil soaked rag.  The rag, absorbing the oil,
&gt; will keep the rest of the engine  and tin clean if there is no other source of
&gt; a leak.  The solution is to blow $35 and order a new tube and &quot;O&quot; ring from
&gt; the dealer.  You will re-use the cap and dipstick.  The bolts that attach the
&gt; tube to the elbow are metric cap screws - ab out 6 or 7 mm.

Nice article Harvey!

Even though I don't drive a diesel (and never would) I can appreciate the
preventive maintenance aspect and not-too anal-retentive nature of trying
to keep ones engine compartment from looking like a grease fire just waiting
to happen. :)  Clean engine compartments are much easier to deal with than
greasy ones and you can locate problems much quicker.  But the best thing
about keeping an engine compartment clean is that while you're wiping things
down, especially during detailing section, is that you catch any flaws or
potential problems as you go along.  I take great pleasure in wiping down
the engine compartment.  It's really therapeutic and informative.  Remember,
you don't have to do it all in one day.  Just start a little at a time and
eventually, the whole engine will look spotless!

Happy Cleaning!
