&gt; &gt; I am still suprised that these coupling are not offered as replacements for
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; spider-gears for positraction diffs in the aftermarket.  I'd love to have
&gt; three of these 
&gt; &gt; instead of two diffs and one.
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt;  Anybody?
&gt; 
&gt; I'm not sure exactky how you'd propose to do this.  One VC for each half-axle
&gt; to maintain the axle speed proportional to the driveshaft speed?  This would
&gt; put a constant &amp; heavy load on the VC, a condition I'm not certain it's well
&gt; suited for.  With this layout, the VCs would &quot;unlock&quot; while coasting in a
&gt; straing line and then allow the driveshaft to spin untill they locked up when
&gt; the driver re-applied power.  Also, they'd both tend to lock while turning a
&gt; corner on pavement - an undesireable situation.
&gt; 
&gt; I must have misunderstood what you're suggestion.  Care to explain a bit
&gt; further?

    WEll, If you put a VC on each Half shaft you would not need the
          differencial!!! Now that would be cool on both front
          and rear.!
