Subject: Re: no start :(

I'm having starting problems also. I believe they are just battery
related since when it is charged, it starts no problem. The alternator
could be suspect, but I haven't seen the alt light come on at all. The
voltage at the battery terminals with the engine running is around 14
volts.

I have experienced this problem too. After long highway drives, stop
for gas, and Murray won't start. What are the details here? Did you
change out the solenoid?
