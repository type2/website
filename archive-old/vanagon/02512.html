&gt; Old MacDonald had a Bus
&gt; VeeWee VeeWee O
&gt; And on that Bus he had some CV JOINTS!
&gt; VeeWee VeeWee O
&gt; With a WHINE-WHINE here, and a WHINE-WHINE there
&gt; Here a WHINE, there a WHINE, everywhere a WHINE-WHINE.
&gt;

I was wondering what that whining from my right rear wheel was - could
it be the CV joint(s)?

Last week I ordered the Bentley book as a first step towards my
independence from dealers with suspect integrity. But, of course, I
risk ruining poor Cassie ('89 Westy, 95k miles) by thinking I can
repair more than I really can. I continue to live with the image of my
'71 Beetle (yellow, named Kato, as in Peter Sellers' &quot;little yellow
friend&quot; in Pink Panther movies....), engine out, disassembled, Idiot
book in hand, trying to get it all back together...I was not a natural
mechanic...just ask the mechanic to whom I took Kato to put it back
together RIGHT...

But, that was 15 years ago - I'm older (yes) and smarter (maybe...) now
and feel confident that I can perform various repairs on Cassie,
especially with the deep well of knowledge available on the net.

I welcome comments on whether a beginner should work towards the
following repairs during the first 6 months of learning:

	1. If the WHINE is from the CV joints, can I tackle this repair
	   as one of my early projects with the Bentley book?

	2. I was told by the dealer that I have $800 of repairs to the
	   cooling system (radiator leak, water pump leak, maybe
	   more?).  I know I consume/leak coolant - I always check to
	   top it off every 100 miles or so - so I know I have a
	   problem. Can I replace the radiator? The water pump?
	   Whatever else might need repair?

Also, what list of basic tools should I plan to buy as an initial
investment? How much do these cost (for reasonable quality tools) I
welcome the advice from the numerous Vanagon sages out there....
