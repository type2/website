Subject: Oldest Bus in Britain

Seeing the interest and details re barndoors in the States recently I thiught
you all might like to know about the oldest bus in Britain. Owned by bus
collector and VW addict Charlie Highgate (you may have seen him at Bad Camberg
with his Hi-top ambulance) it is a Jan '52 Panel Van chassis 20 020 791,
registration 321 WY. Up to 1961 the van had been in use in Germany and had
only one owner since arriving in England in '61. Charlie tells me he still has
a lot to do, though the top half is pretty good, the bottom...say no more!
Still, all the NOS panels and bits needed came with the van!
Charlie also has an April '52 Microbus. It has one of those small hood air
vents on the front and also an opening rear window with flynet. It also has
factory fitted Eberspacher heater!
currently Charlie also has a '54 Microbus Deluxe, a '58 Panel van in original
Underberg livery, a '58 Microbus (originally a fire truck)...and his Hi- top
ambulance!
There is a worldwide register for Barndoors - co-ordinated by Peter valentin
in Germany. Peter was the guy who arranged the barndoor meet/display at Bad
camberg this year; he also is collecting and translating all part nos and
modifications to '50 - '53 buses. He'd love to have you on the register -
contact him at Bismarckallee 54, D 63739 Aschaffenberg, Germany. His '51 Bus
is something else! If you have a barndoor - send him the details!
