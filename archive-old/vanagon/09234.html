Subject: 87 vanagon for sale


Upgrading to lower mileage vehicle, so I'm selling my trusty '87 vanagon.
San Francisco Bay Area location

Here's the details:

1987 VW Vanagon GL
High mileage (155k)
Weekender package
Cruise control
Air conditioning, completely checked last summer
Electric mirrors
Electric door locks (some need tweaking)
No significant damage, a couple small scratches though
Engine runs great, just passed smog easily
Consistently gets 19 mpg
New plugs, rotor, distributor cap, oxy sensor
Also just paid registration for 1995
Automatic transmission, slips a bit in 2nd up steep hills, but is
perfectly driveable.
New master and rear brake cylinders (needs some bleeding, still spongy, I'll 
probably get around to it)
Bentley manual included

Reasonable offer not refused

I'm considering buying a '90 vanagon if I can find a weekender with low 
mileage. Also have looked at Eurovans at Bob Lewis VW, they have a couple GL's 
there with about 18k miles but want $21k, even if they drop to $17k it's a lot 
of dough for a used vehicle. I looked at Fords, you can buy a new '94 with 4.0 
liter engine for $20k. VW screwed up big time: I've always owned VW vans and 
would for the rest of my life except there aren't any new ones (for all 
practical purposes!) Buying a '93 Eurovan seems risky for parts availability, I 
think I read there's been less than 10,000 sold in the US.
