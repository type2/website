Hi Martha,

Carol and I would like to come, but now she is negotiating at work to have
next saturday off.   She should probably be able to do this, and then we
will come friday after work and contribute something to the stew
(scallops?), as well as a side dish.

We probably woudn't arrive before 8 - 8:30.

Of course I haven't made reservations yet, so I hope they are still
available.  I'll try to get back to you tomorrow with a confirmation.

sorry i missed the pizza.

John
