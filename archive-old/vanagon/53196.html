&gt;
&gt;hi all yet another question
&gt;
&gt;i just picked up a 1900cc motor for my terrorist van for 100.00. from what
i understand i have a 2100cc in my 86 vanagon with digifant set up.  im
familiar with the aircooled vw but not yet with the vanagon. 
&gt;
&gt;my questions are what is interchangable between the two motor? as far as
heads,pistons,altenator,water pump,flywheel,rocker arms,valves,oil
pump,lifters, etc. im not to worried about the bolt on stuff cause i will be
still using digifant.i know the the 2100cc has a longer stroke, but are the
rods and journals the same. is the exahaust the same between the 2? this
will end the questions for now but for 100.00 i felt that i couldnt go
wrong. or did i? 
&gt;
&gt;thanks Jonce
