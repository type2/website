Thanks for the post.

But, it does bring up a question.  The new harness seems to be an addition 
to the existing harness rather than a replacement.  Has anyone looked at the 
thing to see what's in it?  Some of us may be able to build the $100 harness 
for $10.  A cottage industry may spring up!

Thanks again,
Mike
