Use of a 20mm Ammunition container &quot;rocket box&quot; to hold a container of 
gaoline works pretty well IFF the seal is ok on the rocket box.  To test it
put a couple of quarts of water in the box, latch the lid and put it out in 
the sunshine upside down.  If it doesn't leak you're in business.  The 
hermetic seal provided will guarantee fumes and spilled petrol WON'T escape
into the interior of your van.

BTW using two rocket boxes side by side with the lids interlocked makes a 
fine fire-proof table on which one may barbecue or dutch oven with aplomb.

This is a &quot;vulgar boatmen&quot; trip trick from long ago.       

Ye fine roket boxes also perform as excellent sealable poop bins and several
companies make fitted &quot;seats&quot; for just such a purpose.  Check your local 
river runners supply store for details.  (Northwest River Supplies, Four 
Corners Marine, etc,etc.)

Now back to the tales of cloned sheep...
