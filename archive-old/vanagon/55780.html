Thad,
	I think alot of people are going to have fun with this, but my thoughts
are that this Country Homes place is a bit expensive. I remember some of
your requirements for a family camper from the previous thread, but with
that kind of cash you could buy two Westys. You drive one and the wife
drives the other. Then you could make all the bad kids ride with her :-)

&quot;perfect camping for three... me, my girlfriend, and one goofy dog.&quot;
