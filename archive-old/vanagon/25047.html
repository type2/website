Found another bus to contemplate this weekend...

Its a '61 double door kombi kamper (can you say that 5 times fast?)

Bad:  Wheel wells cut out, wrong taillights, nose bashed in.  Misc &amp; sundry
      dents.  Front floors have some rust, can't see cargo floor (see 
      under heading &quot;good&quot;)

Good: Its a double door, only 1 piece of glass is missing, not too rusty,
      comes chock full of parts. (bumpers, engineparts, etc)  Really
      full.  To the gills!

He was asking $400, would prolly take $200

Whaddaya think?
