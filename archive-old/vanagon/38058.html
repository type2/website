Subject: Bus Antenna

I Have a 67 westy... I am trying to find an antenna for my bus....

Everyone that I have called only have the straight antenna.. the base of
my antenna is at an angle and the actual antenna has a 90 degree
bend to make the antenna straight...(the base is on the drivers side)

any ideas??

Thanks.... Tim McKane '67 westy..
