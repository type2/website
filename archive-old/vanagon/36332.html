&gt; In your case, might you have an intermittent short someplace, that

I wouldn't be surprised if something like you guys describe is at the root
of the problem (though I've never blown fuses).  What they told me at about
3 this afternoon:  Fuel pump needs to be replaced, gonna cost you 600 bucks
plus labor!  Cripes!  I called the first parts store I could find, and a
stock Bosch replacement is under 300, not that that's cheap either.  Shit,
I could rebuild a 1600 for that!  Pissed me off.  I told them to check the
battery contacts, and he said they would.  Also told them that they
replaced the fuel pump last year about this time (probably needlessly,
too).

I bet they didn't check the battery connections or the system voltage.
We've come to a synaptic crossroads here, where the dealer mechanical
Mental Giants (MGs for short) &quot;go their own way&quot; and fix the car according
to a higher authority (presumably above that of even Hebrew National's),
ignoring the other &quot;signs&quot; available to them.  Anyway, at 5pm I call to see
where's my car, see?  They ordered a new pump and will put it in tomorrow.
I asked why the fuel pump, when they said there was no spark either?
Doesn't that point elsewhere???? [right answer: yes.  MGs answer: why, no,
of course! Leading to &quot;Parker's Postulate - PP for short:  &quot;There's a right
way, a wrong way, and the MG way... IN THAT ORDER&quot;].  The MGs reminded me
that I didn't bring it in for it's 30K checkup (I didn't remember there was
one, but would have done the &quot;work&quot; myself anyway if I'd known, so as to
minimize the deliterious effects that are often associated with leaving
your ride in the hands of the MGs!).  Said the spark was there, but it was
weak and the rotor and cap need to be replaced.  Maybe, but come on!  Ain't
that too wierd a coinkydink?  Okay, so I've been driving the last 2K miles
on borrowed time!  Hell, the spousal unit's Montero didn't need a tuneup
till almost 90K miles on it, and before there were &quot;100K till tuneup&quot; ads
on cars.  On the positive note, they think they pull it all off under
warranty.  Negative side is that I don't believe it'll solve my problem,
which is probably along the lines of what William and Steve are talking
about.  In all probability the new pump and cap and rotor will provide just
enough juice to make it run again long enough for the car to find a
suitably distant or dangerous location to strand my ass again...

&gt; I really hope Tim just got a Lemon.

Holy Moley, Mother of Cripes!  I hope NOT! 8^)

&gt; Is there a Lemon Law that might
apply to his vehicle?  How many miles have you put on it so far?

Yes there is, but the details hose me, I think.  Problem has to occur at
least 4 times (I think) within 12K miles from end to end, with the left end
within the warranty period, and the dealer unable to solve it.  I've had
lots of problems, but the only ones the dealer hasn't been able to solve
have happened twice, this time being the second time about 20K miles after
the first.  They are replacing the pump based on less than a year since
they put the last in.  So, even if the mileage didn't screw me, the fact
that they replaced everything rather than actually finding the problem
probably does, because the problem never gets identified!

&gt; I drove the Vanagon 150,000 miles without ever getting stranded.

Where is it?  I WANT it!

&gt; For what the Eurovan cost, I expect that same.  :&gt;

I didn't pay a &quot;lot&quot; for the EV new (18.36K), but I expect a lot from ANY
new car.  I certainly don't like the idea of shelling out large lumps of
cash for repairs while I still have that monthly chunk to contend with.
I'd love to see a fixed loan rate and term offered during which the dealer
covers EVERYTHING related to operation of the car - minus gas, insurance,
and registration - yes, even oil changes, till the loan's paid off!  That
would protect the interests of both the manufacturer and the buyer by
ensuring that the car is fully maintained even if the buyer doesn't have
the cash for regular maintenance.

I still like the EV layout the best, but I bet my problems aren't gone.
Trouble is that I'm not an electrician, and doubt I could find the &quot;real
problem&quot; if it's in the circuitry somewhere.  Would have to give up on the
thing in that case.  Looked around, and even the dreaded minis are way more
expensive than I paid for the EV.  And the Previa is the only one that you
can buy anymore with a 5-speed, though that's extremely hard to find.
Gawd, I don't want to go that route again...!

&quot;Although things are not always what they appear to be, they often are...&quot;

PS:  The tow truck drive, the one that pulled me off the freeway (I know a
LOT of these guys!), said the VR6 engine has one head over both banks of
cylinders, even though they're in a V pattern??  Is this physically
possible?  [Since I'm into antique cars, I've seen a lot of strange
configurations, but never anything quite like that!].  Is the EV VR-6
really coming out??? Maybe I'll swap for one after all...  Beats the snot
out of an Astrovan!
