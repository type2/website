Subject: 84 Wasserboxer Coolant Level Light (U)

Continues to flash while running. Checked 14 point connector at panel, tightened 
nuts on gauge, replaced both sensors on thermo housing and sensor in bottle. 
Coolant level (Sierra) full. However, that side of panel is goofy, fuel gauge 
wanders and clock has stopped. Related? Becoming discouraged.
