Subject: vanagon with hiccups

Christie,, are you sure it's physical gripping of brakes that's causing
hangup?  On my 89 Vanagon, I just finally cured my problem which sounds
exactly like yours.. Would surge just a little at stops for first few miles,
than, at the go, it hesitated, and my oil light lit up a little, ...like I
was stalling...   After checking lots of stuff,  it finally turned out to be
my ignition coil... I used a radio shack multimeter and used the Bentley
manual for what correct readings should be on coil contacts, and it didn't
add up.. I bought the new coil, and whammo... White Cloud now runs like a
dream!.... Not saying it's engine, or electrical.... just symptoms sound a
lot like mine in near same model year vehicle...
