Subject: New Heads/Coolant Pressure

Recently Bill indicated
&gt;new heads will increase the coolant pressure.

Why is that?

I've had the typical head gasket problem on my '86 syncro.  It was replaced
in '88-89 with supposedly a newer, better head gasket.  No problems since,
although I've noticed a slight coolant loss (1/4 - 1/2 inch) over the last
3000 mi.  What causes the pitting in the heads?

Thanks for the info.
