Subject: wOW, and head torques

Busus,

This is an incredible list, I'm having a great time with everyones posts.
Martha, perhaps I can make it to Bodega with my sweetie (girl, not car).

Question for the air-cooled folks; 

What head torque specs do people have in their various manuals for the 8mm
case inserted studs?  I find 22-23(Muir and Chilton), 25(Haynes) and
18(Berg) ft. lbs and wonder what others come up with.  What is the VW
factory spec? (from a VW factory manual I hope)
