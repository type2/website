Subject:       Re: Fram Oil filters

David asks:
&gt; Dan do you recall what kind of readings they were getting before and
&gt; after? TIA DC -- 
Nope, didn't get that specific with the dealer.

Joel questioned the mindset of the dealer starting to replace the oil pump 
without checking other things first.  That is bothersome if that was 
indeed the case.  Could've been gas diluted oil etc.  However, in the dealer's
defense, this was just a casual conversation before heading out the door and all 
details weren't covered.  

I vaguely recall a Consumer Reports ( that fount of knowledge and 
objective reporting) article measuring the particle size various 
brands would pass thru and Fram was rated the highest-- which also 
means the finest sieve size hence PROBABLY most restrictive.  I know 
there are many design variables affecting flow rate, filter media 
surface area being quite significant.
