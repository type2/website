Subject: Re: Sodium Filled Valves (Was &quot;Anyone There&quot;)

	Are 914 &quot;Porsche&quot; heads really different? I thought
it was a straight type 4, in 1.7, 1.8 or 2.0 litre form.
I've heard rumors that the cam was different, but I find
that somewhat hard to believe. 

	Anyway, if you want old 914 parts, Automobile Atlanta
is the place to call. They're honest, have a good catalog
and can answer questions.

	Muir's book says to go get sodium filled exhaust
valves when rebuilding heads. They cool the valve more
effectivly by having molten sodium metal inside the
valve stem and head- the sodium doesn't quite fill the
space and so splashes back and forth, conveying heat from
the head of the valve to the stem, from which it is conducted
out to through the valve guide. (This is why worn valve guides
are a bad idea- the valves overheat.)
