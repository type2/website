&gt; I just got a '64 21-window and there's a large red dash light above the wiper
&gt; switch (to the left of the speedo) that I can't figure out the purpose of.
&gt;
&gt; Anyone know?
OOh! OOh! It works with the emergency flashers, basically to show when they're
on. It was in '65 busses as well...
