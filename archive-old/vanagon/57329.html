Yeah, don't pull too hard.  The seal at the bottom end of this assembly
is none to strong, and damaging this seal, or the one in the cap leads
to crankcase air leaks.  These air leaks will affect your fuel-injection
which counts on a sealed engine (all leaks in the case where air can be
pulled in are bad).
