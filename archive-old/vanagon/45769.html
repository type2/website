Greetings,	

Well I finally got my '72 Westie home and in the garage.  It's all orange with a
very dirty tan top.  So today I've been pouring over the thing, checking 
everything out (so why is it I didn't do that before hand? ;-)   ).So here's the
rundown.  Chassis number 2322221612.  The bus has almost no collision damage, 
just one very small ding on the very end of the front drivers side.  The rust is
confined to the rocker area on both sides.  Unfortunately this is through and 
through on the passenger side as well which means the sliding door jumps the 
lower track and falls just as it is about to close.  Her bottom looks sound and 
the jack points are still there and look usable (probably not by me though).  
The drivers side floor rusted through at one point and someone riveted a piece 
of sheet metal in.  All in all the body looks very workable.
	The inside looks great.  Everything looks stock and is complete.  The canvas 
top and cot is sound but dirty.  There is also a hammock type setup.  I also 
have the snap on screen for the rear hatch and that looks brand new.  I 
shouldn't have to do much at all to the inside.
	The engine is a different story.  The original 1700 is long gone.  In its place
is a Beetle 1600 dual port junkyard engine (I assume from the rusted away heat 
exchangers). Number is AH161271.  I assume it is older than '70 since it has a 
oil pressure control valve.  The engine turns but I'm told has low compression. 
I'm planning a rebuild.  So now....

The questions to the more knowledgeable or anyone with 2 cents.....

1. What do these chassis and engine numbers mean?  They don't                   
seem to match up with the numbers in Muir's book.

2.  What is the best source for replacement body steel?

3.  What is the best way to clean the canvas and the fiberglass? 

4.  The rear engine support bracket is gone.  What are problems associated with 
not having this installed with a 1600 in a bus?

5.  There is one of those add on oil filter/pumps and this engine.  Comments?


Thanks
