Subject: Re: Full flow oil pump



To All:

If you're using a Type I engine in a later model bus with the rear
cross-member, and are using the adaptor plate that replaces the oil pump
cover, the plate may be adapted to serve in a full-flow oil filtration system
by welding a fitting in the appropriate place.  The plate must be ground flat
after welding.

I don't like this arrangement; the things seem to leak more than they should,
but if you've no other engine case available it's a workable fix.  Your
engine will last a lot longer with a full-flow system installed.
