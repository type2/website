Subject: A genuine NOS Gedore tool for removing ACVW pull switches.

All,

A while back i bought a new/old Gedore tool stock.
Gedore is a German/Austrian Quality brand.

These are screwdriver looking things with a red wooden
grip, the guy i bought them from told me they were
used for old carradios. These tools were made somewhere
in the 60s but still *new*, per three in their original
sealed packaging.

They can be used for almost every ACVW pull-switch.
It has a socket that fits over the switch-shaft
into the two notches of the nut. It won't fit the
baywindow headlightswitch, this one has a smaller nut.

This tool will keep us from damaging our dashboards and
switch-nuts with pliers, screwdrivers and hammers,
especially on non-super Bugs.

I sell 'em for $15us each, including P&amp;P by airmail anywhere
in the world.

Brian.
