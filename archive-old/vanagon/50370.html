Subject: FS:  '85 Westfalia GL, $4250 (Pa.)

This camper was bought in Germany and brought to the US by the original 
owner.  It is sort of a metallic brown/copper color with a light brown 
poptop, and is in excellent running condition.

This has the upgraded interior (plusher seats with armrests, velour 
interior, etc.), pretty much the same as used up thru '91,  plus 
Power Steering (in fact, I just had a new factory-rebuilt power steering 
rack installed.)  

Mechanically needs nothing that I know of.  Runs great, drives well.  4 
speed. 109,000 miles. Recent alignment, steering rack, newer water pump.
Trailer hitch. Power steering/brakes. No A/C.

Interior is very nice. Full camping package: Sink, stove, fridge 
(AC/DC/propane), sofabed, table in rear, etc.  (Missing small front table, 
as usual.)  Poptop canvas is perfect.

Body is decent. Looks nice, and has no dents.  However, there is the 
typical slight surface rust along the seams, and along one seam the 
rust has spread out about 2-3&quot; on each side of the seam.  Also some surface 
rust next to the drivers door handle, and on the lip of one wheel well.  
However, this is all surface rust - no holes.  Also, there was rust around 
the 3 camper inlets on the drivers side (the jacks for AC plug, city water, 
and water tank fill). The previous owner, reasoning that these inlets are 
not needed (you can fill the sink tank or run the fridge without them) 
simply riveted a metal plate over them rather than fix them.  This and a 
cracked windshield are the only real flaws with the camper.

The camper currently has 5-spoke 15&quot; aftermarket Vanagon mags that the 
previous owner purchased in Germany.  The asking price of $4250 includes 
the stock wheels and hubcaps; I would want a little extra for the chrome 
wheels, or would sell them separately.

I am in Pa., between Philadelphia and Allentown.  Email or (610) 754-8989 
for more info.

Thanks,
Ron Salmon
