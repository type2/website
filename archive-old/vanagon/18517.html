Subject: Performance Decisions

&lt;&lt;Friends...I was previously known as SweetPea70 but have since changed
accounts.&gt;&gt;
    I put this to you::::::: Ramona and I are about to embark on a
cross-country voyage to Colorado where we will live in rust-free harmony for
the immediate future. Ramona needs upgrading before the onset of serious
travel and I've obtained a Bus Stop catalog from Rocky Mtn. Motorworks. Is
this a good co. to deal with? (I realize I just opened up a can of worms
there...) In shopping for a new long-block engine, how do theirs compare to
others? The two choices I have are the stock 1600cc remanufactured and the
&quot;high performance&quot; 1641cc for slightly more bread. How much more power does
the 1641cc offer in comparison to the stock?? What are the pros and cons of
either??? Do I also have to buy an engine installation kit to put it in?
What's the best way to go here? I wanna be sure she'll have enough power to
tow a small trailer and my camping gear. Also, how do I check to see if my
oil cooler is in good shape? Engine out?? How does one tell if it's shot?
    Anyways, I really need some fast advice here! This trek came up sooner
than I'd anticipated and I need to get the ball in motion! Any towing hints
would be apprecitaed too! How well do these puppies pull?     Thanks! Rach
