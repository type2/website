Subject: New Westfalia Brochure

I just received the new Westfalia catalog from Germany.  I sent them a letter
knowing I was in the market for a new Westfalia, and they sent me the new
catalog for the 1996 VW EV Westafalia along with many other conversions.
All of the text is in German, but there are some GREAT pictures.  Does anybody
know what the differences between the Westfalia EV Camper and the Winnebago
EV Camper are if any?  Thanks a lot
                                                  Jeff Layton
