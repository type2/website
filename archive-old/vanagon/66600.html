&gt;With a 5w50 oil, the base stock is 5W with modifiers to make it act

&gt;The problem is, these modifiers break down over time, even in as
&gt;little as 2,500 mi.
&gt;Once this happens, you basically have base stock oil, in this case 5w,
&gt;which is too
&gt;thin for pre-1990 engines

As I understand synthetic oils are designed to overcome this very
problem, which is why they protect longer and better....and cost much
more.

Any petroleum engineers out there??
