Hello--

Hey, what do you know it's ColumBUS Day.

This thread brings up a question I've had since I bought my Vanagon, or there
abouts. When I was first driving, (late 70s) my grandad, a former mechanic,
said if my car was properly tuned, after a long trip on the highway there
would be a white powdery residue inside the tailpipe. And lo and behold after
a long trip in my '71 Karmann Ghia that Thunderbird exhaust tail pipe had
white residue in it. Life was good.

Now with my Vanagon, and I suppose my 81 Honda before that, the inside of the
tailpipe is always black. Even after a long trip. (I wouldn't say sooty.
Although it was sooty until I changed the 02 sensor a few months back.)

I'm hoping this has something to do with better emissions or the catalitic
converter, but I'm no engineer. In fact my father is an engineer and he's no
engineer. So who has the facts on this whole thing? Was my Grandad wrong
about this white residue? Is the lack of the white stuff the sign of a poorly
tuned engine?

Any info will be greatly appreciated.
