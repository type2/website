Subject:      Re: Insuring a Camper: Title as Motorhome!

Westfalia owners:

Here in Canada, all Vanagon Westfalias were sold with a CSA sticker
outside on the driver's side which states that the van is a certified
Motor Home. (CSA = Canadian Stds. Assoc., similar to UL = Underwriters
Lab.) When insured as a Motorhome (at a much reduced rate), the stove,
fridge, etc. are also covered. I don't believe that non-motor home
insurance covers these camper items, however, your home insurance policy
may.

&gt; Along these lines, some smart PO of my 82 Diesel Westy got it titled
&gt; here in Texas as a motorhome. My title reads MH and I pay considerably
&gt;
&gt; less registration and insurance as well. May want to consider seeing
&gt; what is required to title your Westy's as motorhomes. Apparently the
&gt; infrequent usage of MH's give a tremendous break in insurance and
&gt; registration, at least here in Texas.
