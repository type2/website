Subject: Repaired AC engine temp - good!

Well, I took the first road trip on the repaired engine today - and results
seem to be pretty good. Although I do not yet have my head temp gauge
working (the sensor wires were abraded and one was broken - any ideas to
repair/replace let me know!) I did have the oil temp and pressure working
fine. Crusing on the highways (and byways) of the Olympic Peninsula I
stayed at 180F while driving, rose to 200F upon stopping. This is *much*
better than before, when I was getting an average drivetime temp oof 220F.
Now I hope I can get it over 210F occasionally just to boil out the water &amp;
stuff from the oil!
(Driving on the freeway the other day I did approach 210 after stopping so
this shouldn't be that big a problem!)

Power is a bit better too - I can at least take some hills while still in
4th running about 2500 rpm. Before I would have *had* to shift to 3rd - now
I do anyway since peak torque is at 3000 rpm.

And for those who were keeping track, the following items were repaired:
- heads flycut to provide a new smooth surface after having them leak so badly
  (around #4 the head was black from the combustion leaking out!);
- real head gaskets (aka sealing rings) this time;
- valves removed and relapped (they looked fine but were leaking a little bit)
- new fuel injector (to replace the burned off one)
- new valve guides
- new coil (old one wasn't a 'resistor' type)
- new plugs &amp; points
- misc seals and gaskets

on the road again, just in time for the rainy season,
-rick
