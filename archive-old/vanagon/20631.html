Brad asks

&gt;1.  Is it possible to install a 1700 with the cooling tin in place?

&gt;2.  Is it REALLY possible to do Number 1(no bathroom jokes) with the seal
on?

The answer is yes, but IMO it's a heck of a lot easier to put the engine(with
tin and seal)/transaxle back in as a complete unit rather than breaking them.
 Although it means pulling out a few extra bit (linkages, CV's etc) the
half-hour it takes to do this more than compensates for trying to slide a
Type IV onto a gearbox input shaft with the gearbox still in the van.......
