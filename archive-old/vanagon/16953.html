Subject: Syncro/Westfalia Transplant


     Derek said to persevere, but after six months of wanna Syncro Westie
     east of the Mississippi, with no results, my imagination is getting
     fertile, or worse.

     I have seen several nice Vanagon Westies, and at very reasonable
     prices. I have also seen a couple Syncros, at reasonable prices.
     So what is the opinion of the cogniscenti? (1) How crazy would it be
     to do a transplant? (2) Which way to go: which should be the donor?
     (Yes, I do want the pop-top!)
