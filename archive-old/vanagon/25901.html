Subject: Reclining rear seat



I live in E. PA and have heard of an 84 Vanagon for sale with
a blown engine.  I would like to buy as a part Van but do not
have adequate funding.

Several people have asked for a couple of small things but I need
to sell something worth some real money in order to afford it.

The rear seat reclines, I was hoping to keep it myself, but it looks
like I need to sell it if someone is willing to buy it.

The Automatic Transmission is good and it also has working AC.

Anyone who want soomething, put in your bids.

Please send mail directly to me.
