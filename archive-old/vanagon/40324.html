Damn! You beat me to it! And I even had the silly answer at my finger tips.

Tin snips! ;-) There is no problem so big that tin snips cannot make it bigger.

BTW, What rocks?  (other than your unfortunate change of geography)  Visited
your home page today and was glad to learn that you had found a 2L to stick
in da boat.  As the 2L is about all I have left of 'the luggage' (my '78)
and I have, like you, now installed it in a '73 camper (albeit, mine is an
un-modified Westy, and therefore, probably a pound or two lighter), I got to
ask a question.  A bunch of the pre-FI folks on the list have written to
congradulate me on getting the bigger engine (rather than the older body
{the actually progression}).  Is the 2L in your car noticably more powerful
than the 1.8?  Still in 3rd on the way to San Beradino?  

On the third hand, when will you be back on the east coast?
