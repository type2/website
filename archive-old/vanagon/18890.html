Subject: '73 T II Thangs 



	Hi Y'all,


	Does anyone out there know about the length-difference of the
	headliner-rods of a '73 Single Cab?
	It happenes to be that 1 of the 2 is longer, so how do I know what
	is the front or rear one?

	Also, finding a new original headliner wasn't that hard, but I have
	problems finding the original plastic sleeves that go over the end
	of the headliner-rods, anyone ideas where to find them ? Used is O.K.
	as long as it's VW.

	This is a pretty neat car, I'm going to inform Y'all about it soon.


	 	Have a nice day :)


	 Brian aka Volx
