Subject: Re: Road sign interpretations - (F)

&gt;I remember getting the stuffing slapped out of me by my mother (on the way
to Mass/Catholic church services) after reading this unfamiliarword painted
on the side wall of the local Circle K convenience market. I didn't know, I
just piped up and asked in a real loud voice what it meant. Of course my mom
handled it with the greatest of grace and compusure. &quot;Time Out&quot; and
&quot;Sensitivity Parenting&quot; were not invented yet. She just reeled around in the
'56 Buick Special and demanded that &lt;slap!&gt; &quot;Dont'&lt;slap!&gt; you &lt;slap! &gt;ev
&lt;slap!&gt; ver &lt;slap!&gt; say &lt;slap!&gt; that &lt;slap!&gt; word &lt;slap!&gt; again &lt;slap!&gt;
young &lt;slap!&gt; man!&quot;
In my innocent first grade (John Glenn, haircutted) mind I must have been
thinking **** mom don't get so ****ing riled up! Ever since I cringe
whenever I enter a Circle K store and smile when I see &quot;Merge Ahead&quot;
