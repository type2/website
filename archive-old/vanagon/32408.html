  I get a good spark to all
plugs.  When the engine is running I get black, wet soot from the tail pipe
that smells like gasoline.  When I turn the engine off, I can smell the
engine compartment reaking of fuel.

====================
Check the fuel  pressure at the manifold that feeds your fuel injectors.  You
will have to look up the proper spec for it, I'd make a vague guess at around
30-35 PSI.  In the Bosch FI system that I am familiar with (BMW Motronic, and
I believe that the system used in VWs of your vintage is also Bosch and quite
similar), there is a fuel pressure regulator on the injection manifold.  There
is a hose that connects the pressure regulator to the intake manifold that may
be loose, missing or leaking, or the regulator itself may be faulty.  Sounds
like you are running rich, a good guess is a too high fuel pressure, possibly
from a bad regulator, and it floods the engine when you shut down.
