&gt; Hey, I was browsing that auction web and noticed this one too:
&gt; 
&gt; 1958 VW Type II Deluxe

The problem I see with buying a bus this way is that you really 
don't get to see what you're getting, and I see the potential for fraud.
And how do you know where the thing is?  Its one thing to get a great
deal, but what if you find out the bus is in norwestern BFE?
