Subject: Re: 1964 micro manual!

     Hi,
     
     I was lucky enough to pick up a '64 edition Intstruction manual from 
     the Santa-Pod meet two weeks ago. As has been pointed out aparantly 
     buses have good heaters ;-). It even says that If you open the front 
     vent-wing a little it'll get warmer coz the fan can pump more heat 
     into the cab - err, NO.
     
     Lee.
     
     ps, Hmm I've been thinking if I take the heater cable off the heater 
     boxes and attach it to a piece of Uranium then fix another piece of 
     Uranimum to the floor inside the bus. Then turning the heater control 
     would bring the two pieces of Uranium together. You could adjust the 
     amout of heat produced by screwing the nob in or out. Oh, and remember 
     to adjust the cable so that the Uranium pieces don't touch! Than have 
     a little fan blowing the hot air onto your body - yum nice and warm.
     Can anyone see any flaw/drawbacks in this seemingly easy way to heat 
     your bus?? ;-)
