Subject: 1986 AC part Wanted:

     My AC failed over the last week again. I had a buzzing at the
     back C-piller and the van was getting smokey inside.

     It turns out that there is a small black box called the AC
     thermostat located on that C-piller that regulates the temperature
     by turning on the compressor, as required by the inputs from the
     front control and the evaporator temperature. It burned!!
       Does anyone have a spare from a donor they want to sale or
       trade for some heads or something.
