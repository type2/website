Subject: Buses in print

If anyone happens to read U.S. News + World Report, within the first ten pages 
is an ad for GTE,concerning technical innovation. Pictured is a surfer sitting 
in the doorway of a 68-71 baywindow that looks extra clean. A VW bus in an ad 
about technical innovation,in the 90's imagine that! Tom Czerniak
