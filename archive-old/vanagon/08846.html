So Dan Houg says:
&gt; 
&gt; They put a guage on and indeed it was low.  They were just about to 
&gt; start by putting an oil pump in it when they noticed the Fram filter. 
&gt;  They changed to a Volkswagen one and immediately gained 5 psi at hot 
&gt; idle and 10 psi at highway rpm.  Now this could be due to just an old 
&gt; vs new filter or is this a typical experience with Frams?  My oil 
&gt; light flickers at idle and I will be changing to a VW filter to try 
&gt; this out!
&gt; 

Well, if I have to use a Fram, I'll only use it in the warmer months
because it doesn't have the OEM filters built in by-pass valve.  So
when it's cold, the valve will adjust for thicker cold oil.  In the
summer, it's not as big an issue, since the oil is typically thin
enough in the morning.  I've never experienced the flickering oil light
problem with a Fram filter on.  I change the oil at every ~2,500 miles. 
I've also not used the Fram filter for quite a while.
