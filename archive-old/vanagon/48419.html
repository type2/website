Subject: 85 Value

Could someone give me the ball-park price on this VW Vanagon?

'85 110k miles.
Probable scored cylinder &amp; burnt valve on left side.
Average condition outside, excellent condition inside.
Bronze color
new shocks
new tires
front brakes good, rear need cylinders and shoes.
AM/FM w/cass &amp; speakers
AC (but needs charge)

My considerations on this car are to sell as is and buy another cheap 
used car, put in a used 
motor and trade/sell it, put in a rebuilt motor and run it two years.
