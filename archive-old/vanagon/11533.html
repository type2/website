The following is an excerpt from a magazine called &quot;Camping &amp; RV&quot; -
Jan/Feb 1995 issue.  The article is entitled &quot;A Class of Their Own,&quot; and
is about Class B motorhomes:

...&quot;One RV brand that's been around for a long time is Sportsmobile (tm).
The company traces its roots to the '60s when it was the first 
American company to begin converting Volkswagen buses into pop-up van campers.

In a twist of irony, many of these early campers found pop-culture
owners who, after succumbing to traditional capaitalism for a
couple of decades, now find themselves looking for a convenient way to
travel with the grandkids.  Perhaps it's true that nothing is ever-new -
only rediscovered.

Though the Westfalia company ultimately gained the official Volkswagen conversion contract, Sportsmobile retained its proprietary roof retraction mechanism. 
The apparatus allows the top to extend straight up, rather than merely 
tip from one end.

That this company remains alive and well in RV manufacturing business
some thirty years hence is an accomplishment in itself.  The success,
though, may be largely traceable to a proven commiotment to
the customer.  You see, in contrast with many van camper
manufacturers, Sportsmobile will convert even used vans.

This is worthy of acknowledgment since few RV manufacturers will deal
with pre-owned vehicles, or for that matter, one-off custom
contracts.  While Sportsmobile personnel will certainly be happy to
sell you a brand new, fully converted unit, they also don't shy
away from working on older vans that have already been on the
road.

Decades of experience has shown that some customer want only the 
patented, retractable roof mechanism installed in their present family
van.  Said to be deployable in less than ten seconds, once
installed, the new pop-up top nets owners 6'9&quot; of usable headroom when  
needed.  Perhaps best of all, with an appointment, the modification
can usually be performed in a single day.

Confirmed RVers, though, often insist on a fully-operational
motorhome - one that can be conveniently stored in a garage.  In
this instance, the company invites potential buyers to select
from among 40 standard floor plans.

The average RVer opts for a sofa bed, galley, refrigerator,
microwave, closet, pantry, and Porta-Potti.  All can be 
installed in full-size Ford, Chevy, or Dodge vans.  True boondock
campers can have their home-away-from-home comforts installed
on an aftermarket-modified, four-wheel drive van chassis.

For increased utility, the Penthouse option developed by Sportsmobile turns theelevated roof space into additional sleeping quarters.  The alfresco 
effect made possible by zippered windows is highly touted by users.
Though the 41 x 75-inch mattress is viable for one adult, it will
probably be a bit too cozy for double-sleeping other than small
children.

Not to be outdone by their competition, Sportsmobile also offers several fixed fiberglass top conversions for aficionados of this design.  These range in
height from the mildly-raised vista top, to the travel-ready hightop camper.

Interestingly, the interior layout of a Sportsmobile need not be
limited to strict RV applications.  Mobileoffices, services, and repair
businesses are frequently accommodated.  I mention this as a sidelight to 
further define the breadth of designs achieved by this company, as well as
its willingness to work in the custom arena.

Prospective Class-B buyers should be aware that fuel economy and
highway characteristcs are usually better with pop-up style
van campers.  Greater stability in high winds can also be expected.

However, permanent high-top units have advantages such as better
insulation in cold weather, and greater security.  Another plus
is that the floor plan is always ready for habitation, and need
not be set-up at each stop.  These definite trade-offs between each 
style means that the decision as to which is best is purely personal.

Home and Park motorhome, and Sportsmobile pop-ups, are but two brands 
available to RVers seeking a Class-B getaway vehicle.  There are
others worthy of consideration, many with their own special
traits of patented equipment offerings.

blah blah...stuff deleted....

now, do any of you happen to know where this company called Sportsmobile
actually is?
