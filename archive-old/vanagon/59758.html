New pages on the website on-line catalog:

Coolant System Parts with Exploded Diagrams - Diesel and Wasserboxer
Models
(Includes Radiators, Fan Switches, Coolant Tank Parts, Temp Gauge Sensor
Switches, Water Pump &amp; Thermostat)
Coolant Hoses with Diagrams - Diesel and Wasserboxer Models
Heater Hoses with Diagram - Diesel and Wasserboxer Models

Note:  A lot of these hoses shown are currently only available from VOA
but we're working on bringing them in directly - even then they're
atrociously expensive from the fax quotes we're getting from across the
pond.  I've shown as much as possible so that list members and other 'net
Vanagon surfers can have references as to what are the replacement parts
and their locations, even if they have to go to VOA to get them (Don't
forget Camelback VW in Phoenix, AZ - usually the best [but still not
cheap] prices on hoses).

Westy Refrigerator Parts, covering all Dometic Fridge Models 80-91
(RM182, RM182A, RM182B &amp; RM182B EGI)

OK - back to the 84 Westy engine project - I'd like to get it finished
before the next millennium starts.  Geez, it's already 95F and it's not
even 11:30 yet.
