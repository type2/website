Subject:      Questions about Vanagons

I am looking at early 80's Westfalia Vanagons and am wondering how well you
would recommend them.  Are there any years which I should avoid or can I do
no wrong with a good used Vanagon Westi?  Oh yeah, how are they in the snow
and extreme cold.....I'm moving to Massachusetts?

I would greatly appreciate any info you can give me on buyiing an early
80's
Westi.
            Thanks again  --Jason    (Dentonair_at_aol_dot_com)
