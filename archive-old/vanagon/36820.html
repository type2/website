Subject: Re: winshield seal replacement

Have someone else do it.

I had a new used window put in my 76 for $60.00 and with as much time and
effort(finally took 3 people to get mine it) I would not have wanted to do
it myself.--This was a a glass shop.

I know you can do it with a friend, but if mine was the norm...it is a real
pain in the butt.

&gt;I just finished repairing the rust damage beneath the winshield last

&gt;for some tips or hints on installing the new seal. I'm sure you guys have 
&gt;done this many times and know some great tips on how to get it done 
&gt;easier. Thanks.
