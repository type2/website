Subject:      How to Pop off Sliding Door Panel

Volks,
My door handle on sliding door is getting &quot;wiggly&quot;, and in need of an
&quot;adjustment&quot;. Looking at Bentley and door panel, can someone give me the
safest way to pop off the panel w/o damage (permanent bends etc.) to the
panel or loss of the body plugs holding it in?
