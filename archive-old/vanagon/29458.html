&gt;What the heck *is* the final word on jump starting AFC busses?  The
&gt;manuals always say &quot;don't EVER jumpstart&quot; (I imagine positive or
&gt;negative spikes from the donor-car might fry your ECU) but on the other
&gt;hand, I've always gotten away with it. (Those VW automatics *do* have at
&gt;least one drawback...).
&gt;What's the collective wisdom - has anybody ever fried their brain doing
&gt;this?

well, i jump-started my 80 bus several times (went through three sears
die-hards in seven months ... the last one was still in the bus six years
later) with no ill effects. and i've jump-started my 88 bus about three
times, and no trouble so far.

i think the trick is to be very careful about making sure you have the
polarity correct ....
