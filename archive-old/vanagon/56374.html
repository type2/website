Subject: Running a business...

I wasn't aware that Tim Smith had taken over the List administration...
It seems he is one of just a few who object to Ron's new Venture... I
don't see anyone being held at Gunpoint here... If you don't Like what's
going on, you are free to leave... 

	However, I do object to One person GIVING orders to another List
member...

 	I have no objections to what Ron, Kyle, Jim, or any other Commercial
concern is doing here on the Lists... as long as they don't get out of
control, let them have at it...

		getting really tired of Tims' rants...
