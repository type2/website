Subject: saw a 1996 VW bug at the jamboree

It was kind of cool to see.  It looks like a 78 with a few mod's.  namly
they shaved the front turn sigs and put them in the bumpers.  no rear side
window vent things.  The interior was a bit different.  The motor, weel i
would not want to work on it.  i could hardly see the case under all that
FI stuff.

The persone who had it was selling air conditioners for VW's.  that was
his demo car.  He said it was going to be in some movie.  nice AC unit
though.  he told me that the pump would not saverly hamper my 40 HP motor.
i still do not beleve that.

anyway, it was neet to see a bran spankin new VW bug. 

Take care and God Bless
