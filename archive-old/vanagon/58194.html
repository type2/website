&gt;That would be me, and I still have it. The problem is that I haven't had

&gt;(looks &quot;official&quot;)
&gt;The reason I don't want it for my Westie is because it limits clearance
&gt;if I am in a off-road/camping situation. Also, at 32, I am still able to
&gt;get into the vehicle without the need of an extra step... :)
&gt;I will appreciate any suggestions as far as price for this. I do have a
&gt;couple of pictures of the running board that I would like to put in the
&gt;net, but have no idea how to do it. (I guess I need a scanner?)
&gt;Thank you.

Hi Cris,

haven't seen any responses to you yet wrt price, and i certainly have no
idea.  am glad to see that you're in OR, as if we can come to a price, i
will be driving up there in late May, and could avoid shipping.  I think
i've seen one of these on, and it did look &quot;official,&quot; but i hope not
*really* expensive.  I do plan to be camping, but not really much off-road.
Even tho i'm 57 and disabled due to a lung condition, i'm capable of getting
into my Westi.  Just thought the step might make it a little easier to get
some of my oxygen equipment up and in, and also be easier for my 14-y/o dog.

So, you don't really need to get a scanned image, unless you think it's in
your interest  to open it up for bids, maybe.... I imagine someone will know
what the price range should be.  

btw, i *still* haven't managed to figure out on what website I saw it --
some kind of classifieds, i think, from a whole list i found once and not
since.  Can you tell me where it was?

Hoping to hear from you and that we can work out somethng helpful to both of us,

Gail
