Anyway, since nobody responded to my post about paint selection, I guess
they didn't get thru..

So her's the message again:

Wie Ghetes!

        I was at the Paint Store (Jerry's Auto Paint &amp; Supply) to get some
K201 and DT860 (hardner and reducer) and I was browsin' thru the &quot;bargain
rack&quot; where they have all of the mis-mixed paints &amp; stuff, and came across
a color I like.  I got the guy to gimme a dab on a piece of cardboard and
took it home to my SO for ratification. 
        
        She liked it, so I'm gonna get it.  Its almost like the factory Dove
Blue, but with a tinge of purple, and a hint of gray.  A very distintive
color, at the least, but not obtrusive at all.

        Best part is, I get a whole gallon for $20!  Anybody whose ever bought
auto paint can appreciate the bargain!  You can't even get decent _house_
paint for that!

        For the more sophisticated among us, it is PPG Deltron, which requires
the DAU (like DAU82) clear or Concept 2000 Clear, with appropriate catalyst
and harders.  The paint itself needs the reactive reducer. (can't remember
the product #)

        TOnight I had the SO sanding down the inside of the cargo doors, and then
I gave them a quick coat of BattleShip gray Krylon to spiff them up.  I also
got out the shop vac and vaccumed out 20 years worth of horsehair seat
filling from under the front seats (my new seats don't use the horse hair)

Follow up:

	My SO ratified the paint selection, so I bought it yesterday, along with
an pressure guage that mounts on my paint gun ($20). It makes a big difference!  

	I'm still working out the dents, in a sort of &quot;roughing-out&quot; stage.  
Once I have the major work done I'll go back and detail the small dings and
scratches, etc.  I won't start that operation prolly until I can yank
out all the windows and lights and stuff (ie no rain!)
