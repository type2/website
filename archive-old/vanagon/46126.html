Steve, you read my mind.  I have been wondering about new tires but 
thinking, &quot;That's too dumb a question to ask these folks...might get 
some real sarcastic responses like, 'Tires, nobody's put tires on a VW 
van in this country since '91.'&quot;

My tires tend to rot before I need to replace them from tread loss.  
Burning rubber isn't a specialty of this van.  But does anyone out there 
have a tire they just rave about?  I need a good town and short trip 
tire.  And being in Seattle I think a lot about hills and rain.

Thanks
