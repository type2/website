Subject: Re: PNW camping trip

Since Rick Gordon first made the suggestion in mid-February, the archives 
accumulated some 6 people making some 9 posts to the list.  This note is
an attempt to summarize the info for everybody's benefit, and to suggest a 
unified thread, enabling interest to grow.
 
Places suggested in WA:
- San Juans: Orcas Is. (Moran State Park), Lopez Is, etc
- Whidbey Island: Deception Pass State Park
- Marrowstone Island: Fort Flagler (off hand I know nothing about it)
- Olympic National Park: Heart of the Hills, Lake Quinault (40 mi no of Hoquiam,
  nestled in the rain forest)
- Olympic Peninsula northeast: Dungeness Spit Recreation Area 
- Olympic Peninsula central coastline: Ruby Beach/Kalaloch/Mora/Rialto
- Southwest: Fort Canby, just north of the mouth of the Columbia River, rugged 
  coast line, Columbia fishing village Illwaco nearby 

Places suggested in OR:
- Northern coast: Cannon Beach, OR
- eastern OR

No BC suggestions made yet:

Time suggestion, duration (I assume we're all talking about wrapping the trip
around a weekend?):
- 2nd half of April
- 1st half of May 
- 2nd half of May: Canada's Victoria Day long weekend, US Memorial Day 
  long weekend (24-26.may)
- 1st half of June
- later

The Vanagon 1997 archives  http://    www.med.umn_dot_edu:8553/misc/archives/v97/ 
can be easily searched by key words such as: camping, NW, trip, PNW and camping,
and other simple boolean requests.  I suggest that we adopt Rick's original
subject title &quot;PNW camping trip&quot;, that we each mention or home location, that
we state a 1st, 2nd, 3rd preference for time, duration, and location.

My 1st pref:  Memorial Day Wknd, San Juans (if a location reservation can be 
arranged)
2nd pref: 3 day wknd in May, central Olympic Coast (or Lake Quinault if the
coast is too windy)
3rd pref: quick 2 day wknd to anywhere within 100 mi of Seattle
Blackout: month of July
