&gt;You probably didn't get one of your valve covers seated properly. You
&gt;couldn't develop an oil leak by moving engine with distributer out. If it's 

&gt;leaking puddles of oil, it must be from the valve covers.


If you have excessive crankshaft end play, and gave the crank pulley a
good whack (don't ask me why anyone would do that), then you could
unseat the crankshaft main seal under the flywheel, and get puddles
of oil from there. Not real likely, since you'd be getting puddles long
before you started working on it-- normal clutch action puts plenty of
fore-and-aft stress on the crank already.

If you somehow bonked the oil cooler, this can also cause leaks. But
they'd be more the drip-drip variety than the puddle kind.

Both of these things can happen whether the distributor is in place
or not-- has nothing to do with that.
