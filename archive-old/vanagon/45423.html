&gt;I am trying to find the location of the front brake reservior on a 1990 
&gt;Vanagon.  I understand that it is somewhere near the front left side of 
&gt;the engine but I cant find it.  Any help would be appreciated!
&gt;
&gt;Thanks...Andy

The brake fluid reservoir (not just for the front brakes) is located under
the instrument cover behind your speedometer.  Sit in the driver's seat and
put bothe hands on the back of the cover, grasping the little depressions on
each side meant for your fingers.  Pull up and back and the cover will snap
off.  To access the reservoir, disconnect the little electircial connection &amp;
unscrew the cap.

Good luck,
