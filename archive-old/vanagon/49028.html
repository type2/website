Subject: NEw hampshire Junkyards

Was up in the N.E. area over the last week , we cruised by a  couple of
junkyards that held a fair amount of &quot;treasure&quot;. The 2 that were pretty well
organized and chocked full of goodies are Anchor in Plaistow, N.H., they had
about 9 type II's, lots of good condition seats and interior stuff, a few
still had motors, windows, axles, and decent sheetmetal. This same place
also had 3 Vanagons, 1 air-cooled and 2 water. The seats, interiors, and
panels all are in pretty decent shape. No motors though. One of the guys who
works there {Dave} has an 82 or 83 passenger vanagon FS .Ran pretty nice and
looked real good , I think he wants to get rid of it real cheap, the usual
disclaimers apply. Their # is 800 382 5235. 
   The other place was in Lowell MA, called Holland Used Auto Parts. They
had 4 Vanagons 3 water cooled and 1 air. The air still had a motor. The
sheetmetal on all of them was pretty much shoot, thoughthe insides were
pretty usable. The front seats were all intact  with armrests included. All
of them were missing the instrument clusters, they seem to be a pretty hot
item. All glazing were also intact that we could see. The only drawback was
that the yard was pretty disorganized. Theier # is 800 654 8202. Their
prices seemed to be real fair, we got 2 screens, rear wiper motor assembly,
2 bumper caps and an assortment of trims pieces for $25 . My wife actually
says it more fun the antique hunting !
