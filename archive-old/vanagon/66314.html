Yes, doomed, in the hands of the uberdude that created the VC!

Does this problem relate to any noise appearing in the VC just when it
starts to foul up? I have a clinging noise in my VC when driving slow,
but it does not bind when turning. [yet] Hard to hear because the VC is
in the rear in a EV.

Still I think that it could be worth to see if a Torsen diff could
replace the prescious VC. No problem for me thou, my company has big
bucks, but I know some people dont... Could be a budget alternative.
