I'd love a '71.  I just don't have the space or money, but I do have room 
to work on it.  :)  Anyone wanna buy it for me?  It's only about 10 miles 
from my house.

&gt; Say Dave, am I supposed to take the whole longblock as a spare part when
&gt; I trip? 

Of course... you never know when yours is going to blow up.  Even if you 
do have a 100% Berg engine.  Take a couple just in case.  :)
