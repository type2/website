Subject: Re: gasoline differences. :) you should never have asked!

These are interesting results and would seem to confirm David's 
assumption, 87 RON AMOCO and SHELL do seem to offer slightly better value 
for the money..still it would be interesting to compare with an aircooled 
which has slightly less power over all. Wouldn't the differences between 
RON's be 
magnified when an engine is weak to begin with (especially going up hills?)
