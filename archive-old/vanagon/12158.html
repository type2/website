Hi, I'm considering a couple of different VW vans to purchase soon,
and one of them is an '86 Vanagon GL. The body seems really good, but
there is 178,000 Kilometers on it.

Any and all comments appreciated.

What problem areas should I look for?

What price range in Canadian dollars (I know you'd have to see it,
just curious).

Thanks,
	DAN
