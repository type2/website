Subject: OBRS: First call out?

Hmmmm,

I was thinking that perhaps I could be the first call-out for the OBRS.  My
family and I will be arriving in San Francisco on 13th Jan and living in or
around Palo Alto for a year or so......

First job is to find that long lusted after 23 or 21 window deluxe. I'll get
this bus to a good running and repaired condition while in the States (parts
are more common and cheaper there than here I think) and then ship it back to
Aus 
(I know I know but it's one going to a very good home).....

Look forward to meeting some of you folks.  Are we on for Mavericks Thom?

Rob K.
