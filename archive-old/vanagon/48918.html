Subject: FS:  1976 Westfalia Campers

I have three '76-77 pop-top campers for sale that I have been working on 
this summer.  Prices $1675, $2650, and $3950.  (The latter one is almost 
MINT!)  I posted details on the Type II list and rec.autos.vw.aircooled. I 
won't waste the bandwidth posting all the details on the Vanagon list since 
they are aircooled, but I seem to recall that when the list split, 
wannabusers were put on the Vanagon list, so I thought I'd mention them 
here.  If you want full details, e-mail me, call (610) 754-8989 (my friend 
John will be here to give info while I'm out of town), or look on 
rec.autos.vw.aircooled.
Thanks,
Ron Salmon
