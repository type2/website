Okay 'A KILLIAN'  is William Killian in Woodbridge VA (30 miles south of DC)
who has a '93 Eurovan MV.  I grew up with family travels in a '69 
White Campomobile replaced (in mid-trip when an early Civic mushed into 
it in North Carolina) by a '72 Butterscotch Campmobile.  I last saw that '72
in Blacksburg Virgina much the worse for the wear with Bluegrass 
Bumperstickers.  I hope to get an old air cooled camper or a Synchro.  
Maybe an old dual Cab pickup as well.  Also have a '73 orange Thing (okay 
not a bus).

My 2 cents on the Eurovan tires... Mine purchased as 'NEW' last fall has 
Goodyear M+S tires as stock - don't know the model.
