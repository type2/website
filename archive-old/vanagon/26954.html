Thanks to all who responded!

I changed the plugs as David suggested and the problem went away. I
wouldn't have thought that the plugs would be dead considering i put
new ones in about 4 weeks ago... I guess playing around with the
carburator jettings didn't do them  too good...

Oh well, one less problem to worry about... its now time to
finally find out the right jettings for the Weber carb... James, any
luck?
