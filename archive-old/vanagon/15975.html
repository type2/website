     I had the heads replaced on my '90 Vanagon GL (60,000 mi. -- VW 
     participated). After the first one was replaced the second began 
     leaking within a week, and had to be replaced, too.

Should I have the other head taken off too?  He didn't remove the motor, 
he is doing it inside.  While it isn't currently leaking, there does 
appear to be some old residue.  What to do?  Help!
     
1.  Where to order heads from.
2.  New or remanufactured.
3.  To do the othere head, or not to do, that is the last question.
     
thanks much,
chuck
