Herzog-Meier in Beaverton, OR, has Eurovans of various types. The ones
on display are campers, but they said they had others.

   Herzog-Meier Volkswagon
   4275 SW 139th Av 
   Beaverton, OR
   503/644-9121

I have used their service department with great success.

I bought my latest Rabbit from them too. :)
