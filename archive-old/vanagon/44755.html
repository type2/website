&gt;&gt; &gt;Can anyone in the group find a referance to what a *HIGH* oil temp 
&gt;&gt;is? 
&gt;&gt; &quot;How to Hot Rod your VW Engine mentions 270 as &quot;appalling&quot;, if I 
&gt;&gt;remember  correctly.
     
&gt;Got my copy off the shelf.
     
&gt;page 89:
     
&gt;&quot;deplorable, but its not an uncommon condition.&quot;
     
&gt;&quot;275 degrees F. can be considered acceptable with a good 40 to 50 weight oil
     
     
     
     Just remember this is from how to &quot;Hot Rod&quot; your engine. While 
     acceptable for racing it probably isn't good for the longevity of the 
     engine. As I recall from the Berg catalog, nasty things can start to 
     happen at over 230 deg.
