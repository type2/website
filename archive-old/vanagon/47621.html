&gt;I presume this is a bell housing. Sounds like it is a stock part.
&gt;I wonder if it has any part numbers on it.

You are right, there have been a VAG part number on it. Because of secret 
reasons, someone had rub out that number. But I recognize the 
AUDI-Veedub-sign on it. I remember, that Volvo and VW light truck LT 35 (and 
also some Porsche and Passat) are powered by AUDI engines, I suggest to find 
that housing in one of that vehicles. But which one has a gearbox like the 
Vanagon?
