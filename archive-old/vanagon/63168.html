Subject:      need parts sources around Ottawa, Canada

Hi Gang,
I finally got around to posting a message after a long break -- I have
kept up with the list mail, though....


I am currently in Ottawa, Canada for a temporary assignment, and I
took the '82 diesel westy w/me...  I thought I might take care of a
few items on it, while I am here, and have a little bit of a free time
in my hands (I do not have to be at home at a given hour :-)

Any good mechanics/parts vendors suggestions around Ottawa?

1)
Muffler has a hole in it from backing into a curb ; fixable? new
 muffler?  in any case, I'm not going to do this myself -- I'll pay
 someone to do it for me.


2)
Need front brake pads, and the rotors to be re-surfaced.  Any mechanic
the Ottawa list members can suggest for this job?

3)
Need a vacuum pump for the diesel engine ('82 / '83).  The vacuum leak
is back again, and I think I am ready to stop being a cheap skate and
buy a vacuum pump.  A used one would be OK.  Any suggestions for this?

4)
Any Ottawa area list members who'd like to get together for a beer?

Thanks,
cetin
