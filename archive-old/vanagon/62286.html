&gt; One word of advice, check out the &quot;pin switch&quot; used on the sliding door.

Charles,

Thanks for the word of advice!  I got my alarm installed yesterday and it
seems to be great!  I'm very happy with it.  It seems to work just fine...no
one's stolen it yet!  (yuk,yuk).  Anyway, I'm still getting used to it, I've
managed to set it off several times by accident already.  

I mentioned what you said about the sliding door pinswitch.  So, the guy at
the shops said no problem, he pulled out a different kind of switch from his
bag of tricks and put in this plastic rounded end pinswitch.  Sticks out
about 1.5 inches.  He said if it still feels like its in the way later, I can
take a pair of pruners (like the kind you cut tree limbs with) and cut it
shorter. He said don't go any shorter than about 3/4 of an inch so that it
will still get pushed in when the sliding door closes.

How far away do your remotes work?  Mine seem to work only as far as about 25
feet.  Maybe the batteries are dying?

BTW, the three times my van was broken into was each in different states
while traveling.  (Including getting stripped in NYC)!
