&gt;Anyway, it still backfires.  If anyone has any great suggestions as
&gt;to why it might be backfiring, and how to fix it, I would really 
&gt;like to hear from them since I hate loud/noisy engines.  
&gt;
I think most of the time exhaust backfires are due to leaks, either between
the head and the manifold, or where the heater box/J-tube connects with the
ring gasket.  Will it do it at idle when you flip the throttle open and
closed?  If so, I've found leaks by waiting until dark and then watching as
I do this.  Sometimes you can actually see flames/sparks from the place
where it's leaking.
