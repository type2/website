Chip,

  I have a couple of things to add to this thread;

  Check out my web site (www.volks-motorsports_dot_com)  There you'll find my feelings on 
AVP in the engine page.

  I've personally been to AVP a few times.  I work in a VW repair shop and parts 
store.  WE also do machining.  It takes alot of tooling these days to build a 
&quot;reliable&quot; Air-Cooled VW engine.  With the quality of the gasoline these days the 
engines run hotter than they were originally designed too.

  People like Leonard at AVP have done extensive work to curb this problem.  I've seen 
the process in which his engines are built, tested and checked!

  I've installed about 8-10 of his engines over the last 6 months or so.  I've been 
happier with the care and craftsmanship that I see in the AVP engines than even some 
of the ones that had come from our in house builder.

  I've been working fulltime in this shop for 7 years, I installed my share of engines 
over that time.  Some of the engines that we used in the past from one of the other 
California builders we've had to resurface the heads due to Poor QC steps etc.

  I want to breifly touch on the &quot;Core&quot; topic;

  I have a customer that expressed how unhappy he was that he went with another 
companiy due to the fact that the price was &quot;Lower&quot; in the beginning.  After all was 
said and done he spent $2400.00 on a 1.9 Waterboxer engine!  His &quot;Running Engine core&quot; 
 Had a bad everything.....?  Makes me wonder too how much profit some of the 
rebuilders are making by &quot;Burning&quot; the customers of the core money?

  I am in the VW business, I won't hide that.  I &quot;Created&quot; Volks-Motorsports directly 
because of what I saw on this &quot;List&quot;!  I wandered into the list about a year and a 
half ago, I found alot of knowledgeable people and also a number of people that needed 
different kinds of help.  I gave my knowledge when I felt it appropriate, and I 
offered parts when I saw I could help someone.

  After one &quot;post&quot; that I wish I knew who's it was (But I can't) I couldn't stand for 
it anylonger.  The post was to the effect of, &quot;I've been searching for this part for a 
week or so.  I finally found a source but it's going to take 3 weeks to get the part 
and I'm paying (An awful amount) for it.

  Well I sat there and thought to myself...., I have 10 of those on the shelf and I 
sell them for 1/3 the price this person was paying for it.  At that moment I started 
the Volks-Motorsports Idea.  I wanted to share the wealth of parts and resources that 
I have with the &quot;List Memebers&quot; and the World!  I did this to help people, I was 
taught early in life that what goes around comes around!  I know from my earlier days 
that if you screw someone, you'll get screwed!  I now help out in any way I can as 
much as possible, sometimes too much but that's what life is all about.  If you have 
it to give do so.  Selfishness has gotten people nowhere.

  When I started the V-M-S, I knew so little about computers (I still do!) and how the 
list worked too!  That I didn't know I wasn't supposed to post my products for sale on 
the list.  I refrain for the most part from doing so now.  I've dealt with many 
members from this list.  I now I have every intention of going out of my way to help 
Anybody who calls me needing help.  I doubt that there's anybody out there that I've 
pissed off due to my way of conducting business, (If so let me know).

  I love the list, I hate loading all the e-mail sometimes, but I know that I have so 
many places across the World that I could stay if I needed a place too just because 
this &quot;list&quot; exists!  I Thank Gerry for all he's done to keep us together thru all the 
time he has.

  Thanks for letting me ramble, I rarly do so but..........

  Kyle
