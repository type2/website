Subject: what type of carb to use?

I am in the process of building a ground up 1776 for the bus and am
wondering for the sake of argument what set up in the asperation dept
I should use.

The engine will be built for durability not lead footing, but I do need
a little ummmpf now and then to buzz the on ramps with and clamber around
the foothills up north. I'm thinking a lite cam (say a 100/110),&amp; I'll have
the crank balanced and 8-pinned, but other than that just clean and match
port the heads with whatever carb setup I decide on.. 009 dist. and a decent
extractor/quiet muffler arrangment will finish the engine up!

I've run 34/3's mostly on the older beetle and my recent pick-up, and have
a weber progressive 2bbl on the 72 bus (1800) which seems to not be plagued
with hesitation aka Flatspot.  I have a Weber plenum for the 041 heads, but
am lacking the pre-warm pipes...are they necessary down here in Florida?
would the Weber be a reasonable candidate for a stock head set-up? or should
I consider dual carbs?

hmmmm?
