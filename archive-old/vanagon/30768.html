Hello, All--
Since there seems to be confusion about this Westfalia Syncro, I shall 
elaborate.

This IS NOT the Westy from Taos (I don't even know about that one). This 
is the one that the Knifke's of Kentucky sold last Spring, and was 
originally owned by Charlie Abilene, the founder of &quot;Westfalia Wanderers.&quot;
It is very clean, has 85,000 miles, meticulously maintained. Interior is 
just about perfect (small scratches on a table). Couple small dents on 
body. Two small spots of rust, as far as I know. Rather new deep tread 
Michelin tires, awning. 

I am only custodian for the vehicle, here in Albuquerque. It is owned by 
someone out-of-state who hates to be involved with the buying/selling thing.

We are not taking a commission on the sale.

Color is bronze. I don't know what it's called officially, but is a 
darker, richer color than the &quot;gold&quot; color.

&gt; h, you got the Syncro part ok, but I think
&gt;      the convention is &quot;Westie&quot; ;-).
&gt; 
&gt;      Anyway, Joel just posted this one last week:
&gt; 
&gt;      1986 Westfalia Syncro, with full camper setup, A/C power mirrors,
&gt;      tinted windows, $12,750 or offer.
&gt;      (505) 255-6611 (NM) delivery possible.
&gt; 
&gt;      Ah, the fun of the chase...

&gt; 
&gt; If this is in the Taos area and it's gunmetal grey, and was owned by a 
&gt; nice realestate bimbo, I've seen it and it's thrashed.  Sister lives in
&gt; Taos.  I visit often.  She wanted 16.5K before.
