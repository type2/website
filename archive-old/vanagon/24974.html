&gt; Ummm, the current itinerary *does* call for us to return via Alaska, briefly.
&gt; We come down by Tok, and then return to Canada.  Looking at my Alaskan

&gt; are no roads that go down the panhandle, for example.

Ooooh, expensivo!  Those ferries are NOT cheap.  Veeerry pretty, but not 
cheap.  Thought I should mention this before too many people get their 
hearts set on this idea.  I thought it would be cool, too (and it is!), 
but abandoned the idea after looking into the cost.  Too dear for bears.

And their is no real road system on the panhandle, but quite a good road 
network through a lot of the rest of Alaska.  But we have our own reasons 
for choosing Inuvik as the most northern destination.  If some folks want 
to head up to Prudhoe Bay, and take the extra time to go that route, then 
that's great.  But IMHO (and that's all it is) the route to Inuvik on the 
Dempster holds greater aesthetic appeal.  

Ron's right in that the planned Inuvik trip route will pass through a 
little bit of Alaska.
