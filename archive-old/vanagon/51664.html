Subject: 82 diesel westy for sale RI

I was putterng aroung southern RI yesterday, and stumbled onto this.
Cream colored 82 Diesel Westy for $3000.  It has minor surface rust along 
some seams, but there are NO major dents or dings thatb I noticed.The 
sign proclaimed a &quot;new&quot; diesel engine and camping interior fuctional.  
Everything inside seemed intact and relatively clean.  The tires were not 
so hot.  It seems like a good deal...
