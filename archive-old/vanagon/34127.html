Yes the snow is two feet deep, and the Pioneer hadn't been out of her 
hidey-hole for some time, so I started her up (easy as ever), and 
took her out on the open road.

The usual stutter as I floored it was less apparent than usual for a 
nice change.

I drove to the corner, and took a left.  As I shifted down to second, 
I found myself in reverse, as the shifter tried to engage.  (I have 
no shifter guide plate, so there's no safety push-down to get into 
reverse.

&quot;ACK!&quot; My immediate response.  Over to third, yeah that went in, back 
down.  Reverse again.  Sheesh.  Up and over in the middle where there 
is usually no gear, and, Ahh...  There's second.

That's odd.

Down the street some more.  Why is second in the middle now?  In fact 
they are all a little to the right!

Pull up to the stop sign.  &quot;Dang, got reverse again!&quot;  Over to third, 
over to first.  Hmm.  

Take a right.

Next stop sign.  Try second by going straight down.  &quot;Reverse!!! -
What the fetch!?&quot;  Go for third.  Nothing.  Go for first.  The gear 
shift is just LOOSE!  What's going on!  Go for reverse.  Yep.  We 
have reverse.  

Choose your own adventure:

A) Drive home in reverse
B) Do Egghead thing and fiddle with it some more.

Let out clutch.  Move around gear shift.  No gears now!  Regret 
choice B, and try to go with A).  &quot;Doh!  No reverse now!&quot;

Push bus out of the road.  &quot;No tools.  Too cold.  Walk home.&quot;

Long story shortened.

Got car to tow bus home later that night, and I thought it was 
probably the coupler from tranny to shifter.  Get down in the gravel 
and road dirt/salt/snow under the bus.

Yep.  Screw in coupler is most the way out.  Anyhow, I only had some 
channel-locks, so I managed to screw it back in enough to get it to 
go into first gear.  I think it is about 90% stripped out.  It just 
kept turning though.

Drove home in first.

So the question:

It looks fairly easy to replace it.  I imagine that I don't have to 
loosen the whole tranny.  Rather just shift into the gear which 
pushes the tranny half in the most, undo that, put the shifter in the 
gear that pulls the connector rod all the way forward, and undo and 
replace.

Anyone else done this?
