So Joel Walker says:
&gt; ... someone comes along with something new:
&gt; 
&gt; Joshua Tree Wood Trim
&gt; 2525 Arapahoe Avenue, Suite E4-337
&gt; Boulder, Colorado 80302
&gt; (800) 769-9178  FAX (303) 413-1817
&gt; info_at_woodtrim_dot_com
&gt; 
&gt; it's wood trim for Vanagons. yup. no kidding. :)  they have a kit, $390
&gt; ($790 if they install it). available in Brazilian Rosewood, Italian Walnut,
&gt; Santos Rosewood, Elm Burlwood, Italian Burlwood.

Oh shoot!  Now, besides curb feelers, neon wipers and neon underbody lights,
I'm gonna have to buy Burlwood trim for my interior so I can have a 'sano'
bitchin' van.....   Oh wait!  Maybe I can use contact paper instead?!  

;p
