Subject: Re: FS: '89 Westy at 200% profit!!! /f

&gt; signal by which set of rules they play. For instance, don't tell me
&gt; you're selling a bus because your wife wants to clear the driveway,
&gt; when in fact, you're advertising a new bus FS every month or two. 
&gt; 
But it's *true*!! It's a long driveway, and VWs are everywhere...
.....

Huh? Oops. Sorry, I was daydreaming again... ;)))
