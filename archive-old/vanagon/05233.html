Subject: Re: Rear shock absorber replacement, '83 Vanagon

&gt; Howdy,
&gt; For an '83 watercooled Vanagon, I like to replace its rear shock absorbers
&gt; myself. Would you please forward me your help on these?
&gt;    (1). step-by-step of how-to-replace them.
&gt;    (2). which brand (a mid-range quality is fine)?
&gt;    (3). any helpful hints. (My VW shop manual doesn't even say anything
&gt;         about this job. Maybe it is a job too easy for many people to even
&gt;         worthwhile explaining it.)
&gt; Thank you very much.
&gt; Regards,
&gt; James

I'm sure others can give more detailed explanations, but the short
answer is that it is really really easy.  You basically jack it up,
unbolt the top and bottom, swap in the new one, bolt it in, and you're
done.  I don't even think you need to take off the wheel.  (At least
this is how it was when I did my '81 a couple of years ago).

I think I put in Monroe Gas Magnums (their heavier duty truck shocks),
but did not really do much investigation before buying them.  They work
just fine.
