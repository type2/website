It's so nice to find other people of similar vintage and similar interests.
Every so often I get to thinking about how old the VWs I see out there
really are.  I saw a '74 Super Beetle today (which I still consider too
&quot;new&quot;) and realized that it's 20 years old.

The Bozobus is three months older than my wife, but I was only a little
over five when he rolled off the line.

How many of us can remember the *first* time Richard Nixon was nominated
for President?
