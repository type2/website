Subject: Re: '84 VANAGON A/C &amp; OTHER MYSTERIES

&gt; Here are some more less critical questions...
&gt; 1) Any idea how long the refrigerator can be run using propane? I 
&gt; think the stock tank holds 3 gallons? 
In cool to warm weather 65-80 deg F, we got about 20 nights using the 
fridge for 8-10 hrs a night. This included occasional stove use for 
boiling water, although most cooking was done outside the van.
During hot weather, I emptied the tank on a weekend (temp ~ 
100F) running it all day &amp; night, but I can't be sure how full it was 
to start with.

&gt; 2) Can the refrigerator be run off propane whilst driving? The manual 
&gt; isn't specific on this.
Many owners say it's fine, since the gas will shut off if the pilot 
goes out, but I find the 12V works just fine if the fridge is 
already cold from the night before. Our 2 week trip to California 
worked great with gas at night, 12V while driving. (see Trip Report 
on my web pages)

&gt; 3)About how much do the gas-struts which support the rear hatch/door 
&gt; cost to replace? Should I go to the dealer?
No!! The dealer is EVIL (just kidding). I think Kyle at VolksCafe has 
them - he's on the list, but I forget the address.

 4) What are the pros and cons of installing a seconf battery under the 
&gt; drivers seat? (I camp often, but am not used to comfort.._dot_usually I 
&gt; camp from a motorcycle)
Unless you run the stereo alot, or other things which use lots of 
power, it's probably not needed. We've camped up to 3 days without 
starting the engine &amp; had no problems.

&gt; 5)My petrol tank leaks when near full. I assume it is leaking from the 
&gt; level-sender. How do I get at this? There seem to be two great straps 
&gt; holding the tank to the frame; How are they secured?
Not necessarily - there is a complex venting system used - others 
will tell you more, I've never had a problem (yet).
 
&gt; One last great mystery...  On the dash just to the left of the lighter 
&gt; socket is a smaller socket. It is a type I have never seen before. It 
&gt; is only about a third the size of  the lighter socket and no mention 
&gt; is made of it in the manual? It could be aftermarket, but it doesn't 
&gt; look like it. Haven't checked it out with the multimeter yet or tried 
&gt; to follow the line behind the dash (if there is one). Is this familiar 
&gt; to anyone? What is it and what is it for?
Sounds like you *may* have a gas heater ? Others will tell you more, 
I'm sure.
