Subject: Re: '73 Westy Questions ('72 comparisons)

&gt; &gt; Not sure if it changed for the '73... 
&gt; 
&gt; nope it changed in 74. the interiors for 73 and 72 are very similiar except 73's 
&gt; often got the uglier (IMHO) &quot;darker&quot; woodgrain and sometimes i have seen cabinet 
&gt; handles that were white as opposed to the standard black

Wow I wonder now.  We went from a '69 to a '72 (in mid vacation we got 
smashed by an early Civic - still hate Hondas).  The '72 had white/gray 
handles.
