&gt;Like I said in the just-previous post, it may be the battery contacts after
&gt;all.  That COULD explain why the clock was essentially resetting itself the
&gt;day before it died.  Maybe the voltages to/from the computer were dropping,

In the V6anagon (non-computerized, the way cars SHOULD be), I had an
odd problem whereby the ignition kept losing 12V every now and then and
the engine would quit cold. If I rolled the right fuse in its holder,
the 12V came back, engine ran fine, and I would live happily ever after
until the next time it happened.

I replaced a few fuses, and cleaned up a lot of loose wires that were
rattling around the engine compartment (PO did a sloppy conversion),
and haven't had the problem since.

I suspect that there was a stray 12V wire in there, occasionally touching
metal. Since no fuse actually ever blew, I suspect that there was some
dirt or corrosion on the fuses, and that whenever this loose wire touched
metal, it caused enough current to try to flow thru the (corroded, high-
resistance) connection, to heat up the connection and cause a lot more
oxidation/corrosion until it stopped conducting entirely. Rolling the
fuse ground away enough crud, that the joint conducted again.

In your case, might you have an intermittent short someplace, that
is doing the same thing? Have you ever actually blown any fuses (sorry,
I didn't save the beginning of this thread where you may have covered
this)?

BTW, VW fuses can blow or break, without ever looking like they're
blown. Take them out of the holder, and they fall apart in your hand.

My $0.02...
