So John Clavin says:
&gt; 
&gt; It was HOT.  By 10 am it was already 100 degrees as we climbed the
&gt; long hills across the desert.  The second stage fan came on several
&gt; times (unusual for my normal driving pattern) and I took to turning 
&gt; off the a/c on long grades.  

I would expect the second stage fan to come on more frequently in
this type of driving.   Especially in the stop and go city driving.
I usually turn off my AC to on grades during excessively hot days
or on steep grades when I need all the speed I can muster. ;)

Another note of interest.  My VW manual states that after a long
drive in hot weather or a steep climbs, when you stop you should
let the engine run for a couple of minutes.  I do this quite 
regularly after a freeway drive.  Like John Ritchie says, I'm
probably being over-cautious, but I don't like big repair bills. =O
I presume that this running the engine bit equalizes the temp 
troughout the system so as to eliminate hot spots.  I hate to
think I'm doing it for nothing.


Glad you made it okay John,

Cheers!
