New ones:
40. You wear the &quot;wet clothes&quot; in order to drive single cab on rainy days
due water build up in the package tray.
41. &quot;Balancing the Dellortos&quot;is as close to sex that you've had since Adam
was a pup.
42. Have missed more than one anniversary replacing a throttle cable in a
dark parking lot. The wife has learned to expect it. She was with you for a
couple of them.
43. Recognize &quot;The Resto&quot; as a form of birth control.
44. All relatives give your family a &quot;fake time&quot; for important events so
that you will actually arrive on time.
45. Your mother was completely disassmebled at the US/Mexican border,
because of her attitude.
46. You have driven to a Christmas part at night with the top down &quot;because
it is a convertible.&quot;
47. The wife prefers the single cab over the nice car because &quot;it has less
blind spots.&quot; (Sure, Honey)...
48. You don't have to ask last names when someone mentions Martha, Clara,
&quot;Charlie,&quot; or Joel .

Sorry Ger... (time for a scolding)
