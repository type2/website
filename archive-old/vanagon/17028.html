Subject: Re: 2 litre align bore

&gt;Greetings all
&gt;
&gt;I have a second hand 2 litre short block which I intend 
&gt;rebuilding and fitting into an 1800 Kombi camper.  
&gt;
&gt;Upon dismantling the case I discovered writing (VW logo and
&gt;some numbers) on one of the main bearing journals (no. 2) which
&gt;suggests to me that the case has not previously been align bored.  
&gt;Does this logic hold true for those in the know?  
&gt;
&gt;Thanks in advance.

I don't think your logic is all that good.  The case could have been line 
bored and then oversize bearings installed.  I don't think that the VW logo 
means bonestock parts.  The best way to tell is to measure the bore.  The 
case should measure 70 mm (2.7559&quot;) if it is standard.  You should be able 
to measure this roughly with a ruler which has at least .5 mm increments.  
Line bore oversizes are .020, .040, .060, .080 inches.

If it is in good shape, and standard bore, I'd think you have a jewel there.
