Subject: Pop Top seal replacement

It seems that most of the Westies I've looked at (from 83 - 87) have 
needed a new pop top seal. ie: once it starts to come apart, it 
rapidly falls apart.

I've priced new seal kits at $600 (dealer) or $150-200 (aftermarket), 
but I was wondering how tough they are to install. It appears they 
thin side section is glued to the wider front section at the two 
front corners - does it come this way, or is special glue needed?

If I'm looking at a Westy which needs a seal, is it better to get the 
seller to replace it first, or talk him down on price and do it 
myself. I'd rather do it myself &amp; know that it's done right, but I'm 
not sure if this is a tough job or not. I see so many vans with 
failing seals, that I'm beginning to wonder if there's a reason for 
the owners not fixing them.

Shawn
