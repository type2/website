Hi Charles,

Have you checked the vacuum lines?  I found a hole in the one that hooks to
the fuel pressure regulator caused a similar problem in my 84.

Hope it helps, at least they're cheap to replace...

&gt;Hi there,
&gt;
&gt;I have a probem with my 86 Vanagon GL.  It starts right  up, even on the
&gt;coldest
&gt;mornings, but when it has warmed up, it starts to misfire, running too rich,
&gt;black smoke out the exhaust, and with  no power to pull even the smallest
&gt;hill.
&gt;But when I turn the motor off and start it up again, it runs fine for awhile,
&gt;and then the misfiring starts again with the black exhaust smoke.(snip)
