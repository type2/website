&gt;      My local independent repair shop recently bought a BUNCH of odds and 
&gt;      ends from a defuct store in southern NM.  I picked up a set which 
&gt;      included the right-front and both rear mud flaps (the rear ones have a 
&gt;      VW emblem) new for an even $100 - now I've got a matched set.
&gt;      
&gt;      *You dog, what a deal!

       Before y'all get too excited, this was the only set I saw, but I'll 
&gt;      ask next time I'm in the store.
&gt;      
&gt;      *I for one would like to know if a similar deal becomes available.
&gt;       Both of my front flaps have separated at the &quot;hinge,&quot; I fixed them 
        by using small door hinges.  They work great and are probably 
        stronger than the original, but they look tacky.  I want new ones!
       
       BTW- is it mandatory on this list to give one's car a proper name?  
&gt;      &quot;I'm tryin' to think, but nothin' happens!&quot;
&gt;      
&gt;      *While participation is not mandatory, failure to do 
        so will be entered in your permanant record &lt;grin&gt;
