Subject: Splitty ditties..(f)

Sitting there brain dead on Friday night? Me too. Sonambulating into Saturday?
Thought you might like to share some little Splitty ditties we published a
while back.....
There once was a Splitty called Bill
Whose engine was chronically ill
Its pistons had popped
Its valves had dropped
and its big ends were over the hill

Pablo was a Split Screen van
His owner was a &quot;charming&quot; man
One day his pet mamba
Slipped off in his Samba
And hissed &quot;why doesn't this one end in a rhyme?&quot;

And after a day of deconstructuralism thats about all I can cope with.
Remember what the dormouse said....
