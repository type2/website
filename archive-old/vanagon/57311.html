Subject: Help on importing a EV Double Cab from Canada (still at it)

I like to thank all the input received from the list members as I seek my 
holy grail.

It seems like the best synergy is in the Northwest as vehicles sold into 
British Columbia are fairly close to US vehicles (how close I'm still 
trying to figure out) and the Seattle customs office has the most 
experience dealing with these matters.

I would like to found out from any of the Canadian list members who owns 
or has access to any style Eurovan (it would be great if it were a double 
cab) what the safety/emissions compliance sticker located on the drivers 
side door pillar has listed.  I'm curious if there is any mention of US 
compliance or any mention of EPA/DOT/NHTSA.

Finally, if anyone has had experience importing a vanagon double cab, I'd 
love to hear about your experience.

Again much thanks for the help!!!

Regards,

Colin
