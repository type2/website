&gt; I bought a 70 amp battery and placed it in a plywood tray-the plywood was

&gt; 45 $$ is outrageous. You can get a servicable plastic battery tray at Grand
&gt; Auto for ten bucks. It's not a highly engineered piece. Who cares if it
&gt; comes from Denmark? A plastic battery bucket could come from Somalia for
&gt; all I care.

these are metal...i dunno if i want to keep a piece of wood in the engine 
compartment on a permanent basis...danish vs. brazilian is much 
better...and in my case it's gonna have to be welded in cuz most of the 
old battery try and metal is gone.
