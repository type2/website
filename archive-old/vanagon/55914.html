Hello,

I received one of these as a gift a few years back.  Here in Phoenix the 
summer temperatures are 100+ every day.  At 100 degrees in the shade, no 
wind but in free air, the unit managed to cool 25 degrees steady state. 
 So, at 75 degrees internal temperature, it was pretty useless around here. 
 If the ambient temperature was 75 degrees, I infer that the device would 
cool to 50 degrees, which would be a lot more useful.

I gave the unit away.

Mike
