&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Probably the price of a rebuilt starter/solenoid.  Maybe 100 bucks?
&gt; 
&gt; I put a rebuilt solenoid on my existing starter, and have had no 
&gt; problems.  Rebuilt solenoid was $30.00 CDN at Bow Wow parts in 
&gt; Vancouver.  Solenoid replacement is an easy DIY job.

For some people.  :)  The $100 I mentioned above was assuming someone
put it in for you.
