&gt; 87 Vanagon GL:
&gt; 
&gt; 1)  Trying to replace coolant temp. sensor for FI.  Part given to me is
&gt; #025 906 041A.  Part I think (or thought) in van is #251 919 372.  Part
&gt; (again I thought) is at top of coolant expansion tank in rear corner of
&gt; engine compartment.  New part doesn't look like old part and old wire
&gt; connector won't fit into new part either.  Am I trying to stick this
&gt; thing in the wrong place?  Or do I need a different sensor?  HELP!!!
     THis sensor in the coolant tank controls the dash light!
     The sensor you want in near the thermostat!

   It sounds to me like a wiring problem that I had.
   Trace the wiring from engine to computer. Easy job. Just need the
   book. Pull on wires gently. You will probably find the problem
   in the temp sensor wire where the engine rock! With a meter you
   can test the temp. sensor. No need to replace if tests OK. This
   is a common problem in the Vanagon!
