Subject: Re: Free Vehicle Work Area Covering

I have an offcut of carpet in my garage that I keep for just this purpose.
I roll it under the area I want to work on. It's a damn sight more
comfortable than working on the concrete (or adjoining grass), tools, nuts
and screws don't get lost so easily, and I can pull it out from underneath
with all the tools, sockets and so on that I've been using, making it
easier to pack up.
