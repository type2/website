Subject: Water from a/c dripping everywhere!


I have an '87 GL Wolfs. The a/c works well, exept that lately there is a
lot of water pooling on the rug and over the engine compartment. I assume 
this is dripping from some part of the a/c. (I'm in Honolulu and use air
pretty much year 'round.)

Is there a drain line that is plugged or disconnected? Where should I look
for it?

Thanks and aloha,

Gordon Smith
