&gt;        If I remember correctly, you have the Weekender package in your 
&gt;        93.  I got your address earlier but have not had time to ask for 
&gt;        your opinion about it.  E Vans are rare around here and that 
&gt;        package is practically nonexistent.

weekender package in a eurovan?? sounds interesting? whats with those E Vans 
are they VW's way of selling out to the new minivan craze, or are they 
comparable to the vanagon?
