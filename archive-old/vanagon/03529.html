Subject: [W] head gasket leaks
Date: Tue, 30 Aug 1994 00:08:45 -0400 (EDT)

Here is a summary of responses to my '84 Vanagon, Help! message 
a few weeks ago.  Thanks to all who responded!
 
&gt;My '84 Vanagon camper has this problem where every 30,000
&gt;miles or so the head gaskets begin to leak, causing gas buildup in
&gt;the water  cooling system.  This first appears as a rising coolant
&gt;level in the overflow tank next to the oil dipstick. Next the
&gt;dashboard heater quits because it fills with gas.  Finally (about
&gt;2K miles later) the leaking gas literally blows coolant out of most
&gt;of the cooling system and the temperature sensor begins to signal
&gt;imminent meltdown...

CV:
I had exactly the same failure mode, but only after 115k miles...
...I had my one head seal job done by the local dealer...if it is
fixed correctly it will last more like 100k miles.  My office 
colleague with an '85 GL got 85k miles.

JL:
My temporary (it has lasts 6 years/70,000 miles) fix to this
problem is to thuroughly flush the cooling system once a year...
When mine started having the same problem after its headgasket 
replacement at a cost of $900 in 1987, both my VW shop and local
VW dealer believed the headgasket would have had another meltdown
and cracked gasket AGAIN. I refused to believe it and pay another
$900 every 30~40K miles. Since 1990, I have been flushing the whole
cooling system every fall. From then on, my water-boxer with 
&quot;supposedly cracked headgasket&quot; has added another 70k miles. Well, 
when it crowls up the Russian Hill in San Francisco, its temperature
does go up a notch or even overshot the temperature warning light. 
But, by moving the temperature leveler right-and-left, the 
temperature comes down easily. 
It is a fact that these early VW's ('83-'87) water cooling system, 
due to its high elevation radiator and very long hoses, is VERY 
easy to have air accumulated in it. After a while, air will start 
cooking your cooling system and cause major damage. So, the 
periodical flush becomes a very important preventive maintenance.

HSD:
It sounds to me an awful lot like your head bolts/studs are 
stretching.  This used to be a big problem on the rabbit diesels...

MM:
I have an 85 camper. My engine leaks all the time. My mechanic 
says that it is a vw problem and live with it. He does only 
german cars and has for 35 years. I don't have the problenm as 
bad as you describe but if it is that bad try contacting 
consumer affairs...
 
JC:
In my '85, I had an experience last week of coolant overflowing 
the overflow tank. Level rose. meltdown was signalled by temp. 
sensor. They drained and replaced the coolant and could find no 
other &quot;cause&quot;. It now runs fine and temp is back to normal...
After they changed my coolant, the symptoms disappeared. The 
Santa Barbara Vw dealer who did the work felt they didn't 
notice any cause for it...
