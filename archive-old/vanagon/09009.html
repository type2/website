Subject: returned parts.

I just returned parts to 4 different places -- NAPA, Big Wheel/Rossi, 
Champion and the dealer.  $59.66 in returned parts -- no cores either.
There's a Christmas present.  The clutch project cost me almost exactly 
$200 including disk, plate, release bearing and pilot bearing and a 
couple of tools and some grease.
