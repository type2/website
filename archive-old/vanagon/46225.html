Subject: Re: VW Customer Relations on Westfalias in US

Hi,

&gt; Man, I wish we could get a VW rep on this list, but I expect they'll
&gt; say they've already done enough research &amp; know what us loyal VWers
&gt; want even more than we do.....

 They don't care what us &quot;loyal VWers &quot; want. We're a minority. If you
run a big car company you don't make money by catering to minorities
(not unless you have some sort of mega-flexible production line that
lets you retool for small production runs and a design operation that
can feed it efficiently, at any rate).

 The very fact that we care about our cars makes us unusual. Unusual
means outside the mainstream means expensive &amp; difficult.

 If you find that Consumer Reports/Which? style publications tell you
what you want to hear then you are in the mainstream and can buy cheap,
otherwise you are on your own (or, at best, with the rest of your
minority). This is reality, and it bites. We can complain but being
realistic we are not a big enough factor to influence policy that is
geared to the mass market. This is true for cars, washing machines,
stereos, furniture, cameras, whatever.

 When it comes down to it you can follow the flow, have an easy life
and buy a Honda (or a Vauxhall or a Fiat or whatever, depends where
you are) or you can decide to do things differently. But you need to
be clear that being different will cost you: time, money, hassle,
whatever. If you want owning a VW to be easy and cheap, move to
Germany.

Cheers,
	W.
