&gt; I want to create a VW Bus
&gt;FAQ.
&gt;
&gt;I get asked all kindsa questions all the time.  I got tired of typing the
&gt;same answers.  I want to be able to tell people &quot;read the FAQ at
&gt;http://www_dot_calweb_dot_com/~thom/busfaq.html&quot; and live a calmer, more peaceful
&gt;life, with more time to crash into trees on my mountain bike.
&gt;
&gt;Anyway, after all that marketing BS...  I am looking for input into this
FAQ.
&gt;

Great idea!!!   What kind of input are you looking for?
