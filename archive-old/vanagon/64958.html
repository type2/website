Subject:      Headlight covers, square headlamp Vanagon's

Does anyone have knowledge as to where I could purchase a set of wire or
Lexan headlight covers for the square headlamps on an '87 Vanagon?  I
have replaced two this year due to rock damage at a cost of $111.00
each. Any possible resources would be helpful.
