Subject:       Bosch Filters now _at_ Cdn Tire!

I'm still off list, but thought I should share this with other 
Canadian listies:

While picking up a set of Bosch platinum plugs for the '88 Westy 
($4.29), I noticed some Bosch oil filters at the parts counter. Out 
of the 3-4 sizes there, they happened to have both the diesel and gas 
VW ones. Prices were $2-3 less than most places, about what they 
charge for Fram:

Gas models: $ 4.69
Diesel models: $ 5.69

ps: This was in Victoria, so it might be worth asking your local Cdn 
Tire if they don't stock them. They said it would be a stock item 
from now on... :)

pps: All this started out as a trip to pick up some pampers... I 
guess I'll be hiding the filters &amp; stuff ;)
