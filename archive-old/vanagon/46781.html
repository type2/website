Subject: Weather Info - Inuvik thru Northern Cal

For those traveling to the Great White North from the Southern California
area, please be advised that the temps here in the Redding Area and
throughout the Sacramento Valley have been quite HOT for the past two weeks,
ranging from 95 to over 110F in spots.  Last night at 11:30PM it was 92F at
my house 6 miles east of I-5.

The dome of high pressure causing this has started to move east today, so
temps have been coming down - about 94F today at the shop (it was 85F at 9:10
this evening at home).

Traveling at night thru here may be one of the things you may have to do.
 The other alternative is to take the coast route (US 101) as it is much
cooler, but may add to your trip time (It is beautiful up through there,
tho).  There has been sporadic late afternoon thundershower activity north of
Crescent City.

For those sticking with I-5, there have been numerous late afternoon and
early evening thundershowers north of Shasta Lake and through the Siskiyous
past the Oregon Border.  There are also temporary traffic delays as the
annual &quot;tear up I-5&quot; contingent from CALTRANS is busy at work in sections
from Shasta Lake through Weed.

We now return you to your regularly scheduled programming ;-)
