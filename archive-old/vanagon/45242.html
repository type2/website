Howdy Volks,

Please excuse the non-van content, but does anyone know of a source of 
info for GTi's on the net (tech, mailing lists etc.)?  I am looking to buy one 
this fall for use as a winter vehicle (my 76 Westy is CCCOOOLLLDDD 
up here! :). Please e-mail me directly as I'm on digest mode and dont 
usually see anything for a while. (it took me all weekend to catch up with 
my reading).  Thanks in advance.
