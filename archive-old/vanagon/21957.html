&gt; 
&gt; Hey Yaaalll!
&gt; 
&gt; Ive been monkeying around with the muffler on the '71 Bus the
&gt; last couple of days, and I have some questions. (Of course)
&gt; 
&gt; First, I cannot get the passenger side heat exchanger off. The front 
&gt; two nuts are rusted onto the studs, and resist all efforts to
&gt; romove them. I even tried cutting into them with a hacksaw blade,
&gt; but to no avail. I got most of one off this way, but the other
&gt; one is too far up there to get at. I cant fit my nut splitter
&gt; around it, as the exaust pipe is right there. I dont want to have to drop the
&gt; engine to get at the nut, but I might. Any suggestions? (Man, those
&gt; 8 copper nuts should make this job easier the next time.)


GGM answers:
hey lazy guy, take the blade out of the hacksaw, wrap it up in your 
handkerchief, and reach up and grin and bear it and just cut the nut down 
the side.  

 &gt; Second, I want to remove all the rust ffrom the heat exchanger
&gt; I did get off. It is solid all over, but quite rusty all over the surface.
GGM answers:
first scrape it with a sharp putty knife, then use a wire brush, then
then spray it with cheap oven cleaner (pure lye, pure sodium hydroxide) 
to remove all the grease , let it sit for as long as you can wait.  DO 
NOT GET OVEN CLEANER ON THE ALUMINUM GUTS.
Then rinse it off over and over with your garden hose with lots of water.
Then paint the outside only with straight muriatic acid from the  
hardware store.  wait about 15 minutes and use the garden hose again.  
You must use extreme caution with oven cleaner (base) and with acid (acid).
do not breath any fumes. do not splash anything into your eyes, wear 
rubber gloves, all waste goes into your gravel driveway.
&gt; 
&gt; Third, does this POR stuff handle heats that the heat exchanger sees. I
&gt; seem to remember that it is limited to 300 F, right? I guess I will
&gt; just be using Rustoleum BBQ paint (On sale for US$1.99 a can!) I would
&gt; like to paint it silver, but I have never had a high temp silver
&gt; paint hold up like that BBQ paint.
&gt; 
&gt; Should I spray a little of that BBQ paint INSIDE the air pipes to the 
&gt; heat exchanger? After it cures, it should not be toxic, right? Right?
GGM answers :
don't spray anything inside the heat exchangers that you don't want to 
breath in the future. It is bad enough already to breath in the leaked 
engine fumes and the rusted (aluminum oxide) heat exchanger AND THE 
ASBESTOS from the deteriorated flexible tubes

&gt; I pressure tested the exaust pipe like this. Fill a baloon with air and
&gt; spread the end over the flange on one end. Do the same on the other 
&gt; end. If both still have theier air in five minutes, the exaust
&gt; pipe is not leaking into the heater air. (It Worries me.)
GGM answers:
I prefer a real pressuse test.  I made up a jig that I bolt to one end 
(flat 1/4 steel with two holes at the correct spacing ,neophrene gasket) 
and then I use a Fernco (plumbing part) to rig the open exhaust tube to 
pipe fittings with a pressure gauge and a tire filler valve.  I put in 20 
pounds and let the air temperature stabileze and I look for a constant 
pressure hold over several hours.
