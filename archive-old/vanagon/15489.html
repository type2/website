&gt; &gt; What are y'all doing, drinking a couple pots off extra stong coffee

&gt; &gt; be able to last a night.

&gt; Sure, I'll testify,  ;)

&gt; With all the alcohol you consume Bradley dude, I would presume all the
&gt; other excess moisture gets absorbed! eh?  ;)

Umm... that's the only thing I can figure.  And I even drink a quart of 
water before going to sleep to prevent dehydration and hangovers.
