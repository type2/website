Subject: Re: A Friendly Wave

I wave at post-bay-window buses on long journeys when I get bored. 
(means over 20 miles for me....well this is England!) They usually 
look at me like I am mad.

........although, driving around the little town where my parents live
this old-ish guy in a commercial late 80s vanagon thingy waved at
me really sheepishly. I'd just driven there &amp; was fed up of non-
waving VW drivers, and I noticed his wave too late to return it.....
shame.

What *really* bugs me is the number of bugs (ha ha) who completely
ignore me. Do they think I'm beneath them or are they just ignorant?
