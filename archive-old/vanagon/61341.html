&gt; You just gave the reason the front Westy tables are always missing. 
&gt; They're always &quot;in the way&quot; and get removed from the camper, never to return.

   THis is also the same as the middle seat in the standard Vanagon.
   I had a man offer 2 of them to me for free. My relpy: NO thanks,
   I already have 6 of them, to fit in my 2 Vanagons!
