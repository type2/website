Howdy!

Last week I mentioned that a friend of mine was looking for a camper.
He found this at a dealer:

'85 Westfalia, automatic, A/C, one owner, $6,950.

miles unknown. We're going to check it out this afternoon, but I would
like to know all you people's opinions on what a fair price would be,
assuming the vehicle is in good shape.

TIA!
