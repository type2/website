I also have a 97 EV Camper and you have me a little concerned about the
need to improve to water proofing of the pop top canvas. Am I to assume
that your experience is that it doesnt keep out the weather? or are you
just being extra carfull?

&gt; I have a 1997 Eurovan Camper and I live in the soggy PNW.  I was
&gt; thinking
&gt; about attaching velcro pads between the inside lip of the poptop and
&gt; the
&gt; canvas tent.  From this I was thinking about attaching anything from a
&gt; cut
&gt; and fitted shower curtain to an insullated/waterproof  curtain of some
&gt;
&gt; sort.  The free end of the curtain would then be bunggied to the
&gt; window
&gt; from, mirrors, or the base of the van to keep the curtain fairly
&gt; tight.  I
&gt; would probably need to prop the roof up so it doesn't get pulled down.
&gt;
&gt; Anyways,  this is what I was thinking about to better cope with
&gt; camping in
&gt; the rain and snow of the winter months.  Does anyone else have any
&gt; suggestions, or is their something on the market already?
