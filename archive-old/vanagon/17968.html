Subject: water pump woes!

We have a 1981 Westy, and until a few days ago we had running water for the 
sink. The pump seems to have died suddenly. I took a look at the fuse, and it 
looks OK, though I guess I should replace it to be sure it's not that basic. 
Unfortunately, our system is not wired conventionally so I'm not sure how many 
changes were made. The previous owner seems to have broken the faucet but rather
than replace it, he glued it in the open position and connected the faucet 
switch wires together. He then wired in a separate electric switch to control 
the pump. Although this worked, it prevents us (if I understand the setup) from 
hooking up to a city water supply since it would flow continuously. (The outside
connector is broken too, so that's not an option yet in any case.) The other 
annoyance about this system is that when it worked, it was either off or on full
blast. I assume you can control the flow when the sink switch works.

Questions:

1) Can someone describe the wiring on a pristine setup?

2) Do I correctly understand the city water connection?

3) If not the pump or fuse, what else commonly goes?

Any advice would be appreciated.
