&gt; So William R. Kennedy, NJIT CIAT, 201-596-5648&quot;_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu says:

&gt; &gt; Top speed was said to be 130mph.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Anyway the Vanagon six conversion is not all that hard, and the result is not
&gt; &gt; one of those V8-in-the-pickup-bed abortions with no earthly use, but a very
&gt; &gt; logical next step in the same design direction your van was already headed.
&gt; &gt; Try it; you'll like it.

	And Steven Johnson replied:
&gt; 
&gt; I would, but I'm afraid that getting it smogged would be out of the question. :(
&gt; 

	Steven, Bubba!
	Transplants are legal in California, provided you preserve
the smog stuff from the donor. So a VR6 EV would have to have the stock
VR6 intake, sensors, computer, etc, and the stock ehaust manifold, 
catalyst, etc. Once you hit the muffler, I believe the only requirements
are noise related. Of course, it all has to work within spec, but that's
never been a problem that I've been aware of.
	For example, there are some crazies in southern California who
install 5.0 liter Mustang engines in Miatas. (ok, its a 4.9. Ford call it
a 5.0). Its smog legal, because all the Mustang system parts carry over.
Fact is, I've seen one on the road, and I have to say, love VWs as I do,
a 2200 lb car with 225 HP would be a GREAT DEAL of fun!!!

	So why not put a 64 Chevy V8 in and have no smog stuff at all? Ah!
The exact rule is that the vehicle has to comply with the newer of the 
applicable vehicle or engine smog requirements. So you could put a
327 rat motor into your EV, but you'd have to pass stock EV tailpipe
emissions.

	Which implies that a GTI motor into a diesel is possible, but I
can't imagine how you'd preserve the as-spec'ed exhaust manifold and catalyst
from the GTI. This is the great crime- you can't change ANYTHING in the
regulated equipment, legally.
