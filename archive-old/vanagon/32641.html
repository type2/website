&gt;Now, right off it appears that the 12V variety is too big for a Vanagon

&gt;some posts into the holes on the side, it might just fit.  I say might,
&gt;because by my measurements it was just too close to tell for sure.  I think
&gt;the only way to tell for sure is for someone to try it.

I talked to one of their engineers.  Cutting off the posts won't work as the
posts are hollow.  &quot;Eeeek!&quot;, he said, &quot;You'll vent the battery!&quot;

Also, their deep-cycle battery is in testing with some people, though the
release date is in the indefinite future.  It will be the same size as their
non-deep-cycle battery (9-15/16&quot; long, 6-3/4&quot;wide, 7-13/16 high).
