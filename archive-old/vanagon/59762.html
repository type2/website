Subject: Re: Stupid questions

     Hi Stu,
     
     There are no such things as stupid questions, only questions that have 
     been answered 10 million times before and can be easily found in the 
     archives:    %-)

     You should switch the fridge off when you turn the van off, otherwise 
     you will drain your battery.  It's okay for a few hours, but it 
     doesn't take long to strand you, and it's way too easy to forget that 
     you have it on.  I know, I've ruined a battery by repeated discharging 
     cause I keep forgetting the thing is on.
     
     I have no problems running the propane while driving.  In fact I 
     prefer this method to running on 12V.
     
     Just remember to shut off the pilot when stopping for gas.
     
     Hope this helps!

Okay...here's some stupid questions...
     
     
Should I leave the refrigerator on off of the battery during the summe?
 Or should I
shut it off when I turn the van off...(I have been shutting it off)
     
Can I use the propane for the refrigerator while driving?
