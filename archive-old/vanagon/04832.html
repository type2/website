Subject: Re: stranded

This is a little late on the &quot;stranded&quot; theme, but
what the hell.  Years ago, when I was a wee little lad
&amp; my Dad was packing me off to college in a shockingly
ugly 5 year old Plymouth Valiant, he presented me with one
hell of a big lug-wrench--the 4-sided variety.  I've carried
it faithfully every since &amp; it's never failed me, despite
the best efforts of air-wrench wielding mechanics.

For years I've lived on one back road or another, and
until very recently have probably averaged 4 flat a year.
To the odd lot of tools I drag around I also added a plain
old bicycle pump--can be a lifesaver.
