Subject: Fuel Tank Cover Removal?
Date: Sat, 19 Aug 1995 19:22:27 -0500

   I know I've read this somewhere before -- probably here -- but
what's the secret to getting the bus ('73) fuel tank cover off? Seems 
like there is supposed to be two hidden-away screws but I sure can't
find them.

All is impermanent -- and this too shall pass away.
