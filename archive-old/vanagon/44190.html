Subject:      Wood paneling in 69 campmobile



Does anyone know, in the campmobiles that have the wood paneling, did the
front doors have wood paneling as well or regular padded type of panels?

Also, anyone replaced the wood panels, like the inside of the rear hatch? If
so, what type of wood did you use? Thanks,

Tim--69campmobile
