Subject: South African Vanagon grill source info

This is the &quot;411&quot; on the guy that I mentioned meeting at the VW Classic in
June. He had the 4 rounded headlight grill set up. Was asking $400. cash and
carry at the show. 

You might want to mention that this info came from the guy in the White
Westy parked next to him and his doublecab Vanagon. He won't G.A.S. or know
me from Adam. I got the major feeling that he likes &quot;late models&quot; (lets say
'78-'96) big time and only delves into early bays and splits if forced.
Correct me if I'm wrong.
