Oh God! Not again!

I thought we just resolved this?

Now for some ObVW:

I am trying to block off some air coming into my 79 Westy via the fresh air
ducts.  I have tried blocking off the front vent with a towel only to find out
that it keeps the vent from opening, is there some other opening that
air leaks in from, say from underneath the front of the bus?

Freezing mind want to know.

Cheers,

David
