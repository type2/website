Subject: Re: an inexpensive muffler

Hm...


i'd have to say this is quite a runnaround way to do it..

i mean, #1 a header and stinger dont cost THAT much more..:) or, a driend 
of mine just replaced his stocky, complete w/ german mounting kit, 
tailpipes, germain pipe clamps, and brazilian muffler &lt;used his old 
heater connections stuff&gt; and 1 &lt;one&gt; stud that we had to cut to get the 
old muffler offf, for a total of 45.73 at NOPI.  25$ for brazillian 
muffler &lt;took DBHVW ad, and they gave us that price + 3 dollars for 
diferance between over the counter and m/o&gt; the rest covered the pipe, 
and install kits.

instead of 130$....:)


anyway...

or hell... a MONZA at normal prices OTC only cost me ~70$'s..

&gt;    I have a good cheap fix for a rusted muffler problem. The total
&gt;    cost to replace your muffler goes from $130 to about $30,
&gt;    and some work.
&gt; 
&gt;    Here it is. First at your local FLAP get a hold of their
&gt;    Sound Solution exhaust catalog. (Trak had a catalog but
&gt;    it took an acted of congress to find someone willing to
&gt;    work with me.) In the back you will find      
&gt;    a universal muffler part #18696, for about $20. It comes 
&gt;    with a small tail pipe and an adapter to 1 7/8&quot; pipe.
&gt;    You also need a 3 bolt flange that bolts to the CAT. with a
&gt;    I.D. of 2&quot; to go to the muffler. The only flange I could 
&gt;    find,  had 2-5/8&quot; from bolt to bolt and 2-1/8&quot; I.D. 
&gt;    center hole. Because of this I needed a 2&quot; O.D. to 2&quot;I.D. 
&gt;    adapter to go between the flange and the universal muffler. 
&gt;    I had to cut about 3/4&quot; off of the adapter to get the proper 
&gt;    length. I put every thing togeather, rotated the muffler to 
&gt;    sit at the bottom of the c-bracket, and tack welded everything 
&gt;    in place. Once welding was completed, I bolted the muffler to 
&gt;    the CAT. Last I needed to add some scrap metal to take up 
&gt;    the slop in the straps that go overtop of the muffler.
&gt;    This muffler works go. It is a little louder at the low end,
&gt;    but to me this sounds even better. Just got my PA state 
&gt;    inspection, and $100 buck of bear money.
&gt;
