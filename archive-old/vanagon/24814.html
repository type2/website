Subject: waving in the heartland

'... amber fields of grain.&quot;

if anyone is feeling slighted due to a lack of wave (wave deficit) i
suggest a trip into America's Heartland.  this is really just a
fancy euphemism for farm country.  the SDP (Standard Driving
Posture) is left arm resting on knee or on the window sill (window
rolled down regardless of weather) - hand grasping wheel at 9
o'clock, right hand resting on wheel at 12 o'clock (High Noon). 
when meeting another vehicle the index and middle finger are raised
off the wheel in a friendly acknowledgement of the on-coming car. 
timing is crucial.  the &quot;wave&quot; must be performed at the exact moment
the oncoming car occupant  is within good visual range but late
enough so that if the driver isn't ready, the 'waved to' party will
not have time to respond with an acknowledging wave.  

this has some very useful functions that have been selected for thru 
years of rural breeding.  it is sort of a regional non-verbal 
communication recognition pattern.  a 'foriegner' is detected by an 
early wave (far too eager-- they must want something) or a late wave 
(evidenced by startled facial expression and a jerking of the hand 
into view, albiet late).  both types must be viewed with suspicion.

while useful, it does necessitate an adaptation of ones' usual 
driving style, however, the rewards are great.  up to a 90% 
signal/wave ratio can be achieved with practice and observant 
diligence.  ..... even when driving a vanagon.   :)
