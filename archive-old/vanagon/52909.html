David,

I'm not sure what the problem is but the dull knocking noise does not sound
good(no pun).  I will be in Asheville this weekend if you still need help.

&gt; Hi all,
&gt; 
&gt; ANY HELP APPRECIATED!!!
&gt; 
&gt; A little history first:
&gt; 
&gt; Did a top-end overhaul (head gasket, valve job, rings, rod bearings, 
&gt; etc.) about 4,000 miles ago.  A couple of weeks ago, noticed loss of 
&gt; power; also had heard a dull knocking noise (just a few knocks) when 
&gt; starting.  So......this weekend I:
&gt; 
&gt; 	changed the fuel filter
&gt; 	removed the catalytic converter
&gt; 	retorqued the heads
&gt; 	readjusted the valves
&gt; 
&gt; Now, it won't start!  Tries to turn over, but just sounds like somebody 
&gt; wheezing!
&gt; 
&gt; I've checked all the obvious things I could think of (plugs, rotor, what 
&gt; else?).
&gt; 
&gt; I BEG FOR HELP!!!!!!!  I REALLY wanted to get more than 4K out of this 
&gt; last repair!
&gt; 
&gt; Becoming desperate,
&gt;
