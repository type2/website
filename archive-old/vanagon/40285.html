Subject: No Dual Cab, yet!

Hi All,

I'm still looking for my dream dual cab. Doesn't look like I'm going to
have an appropriate vehicle before the CCC trip to Red Rock this weekend. I
do have word from on high though that I won't be laughed at if I show up in
either my teeny-weeny little Japanese beast or my big old hunk of Detroit
boat anchor iron.

I was closing in on a potential lead that I had from the San Jose, CA Kelly
Park show two weekends ago. It was a 1968 dual cab with a '71 front end,
and '71 dual port engine. Paint was shot, but otherwise the body and engine
were in great condition. Problem was, I was second in line and I missed it
by that much. Sorry about that chief!

If anyone sees something ('68-'71 dual cab), do let me know. I'll trailer
anything that's not in running condition. Just want a body that is
relatively straight and rust free (kind of a metaphor for life!).

Cheers,

Bren

I'm as confused as a baby in a topless bar.
