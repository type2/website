&lt;more from the first message!&gt;

The drain plug I took off with the short allen piece and a 17 mm open end
wrench to turn it, there 'aint a lot of room there!
I filled both the Diff and the tranny with Red Line MTL and so far the
shifting is ever so slightly improved-a bit smoother, but no dramatic changes
like the discovery of an overdrive fifth gear or something. But I think the
synthetic formulation is better than the average gear oil and having filled
it yourself, knowing exactly how much is in there now, is a good feeling.
