&gt; &lt;&lt; &gt;I've never heard of an Eberspacher control panel mounted there. Are you
&gt; sure
&gt;  &gt;it's an Eberspacher??
&gt; 
&gt;  &gt;Yes, I can READ. Amazing, how those letters work.

Our Syncro Westy (purchased originally in Canada) did NOT come with a
Eberspacher (or any other supplimentary) heater. :=(
