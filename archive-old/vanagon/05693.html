We bought our first bus last April and were on a road trip down to
the Oregon Coast and this guy in another westy waved at us.  This was
the beginning of our qus..quest to propogate the VW community in our
corner of the world... rainy Vancouver.  There are tons of vans on
the road ehere and now we have a core of &quot;wavers&quot; whom we see
regularily an we move about.  Its interesting to observe the
demographic of our wavers... male,20-something (goti is best) are the
best candidates.  Some of the female drivers have taken a while to
wave back but I'm sure that a strange guy waving at them in traffic
is probably something for some people to be unsure of.  Anyway, in
our incessent attempt to find community in a TV culture, keep on
waving !!!!
