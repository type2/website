Subject: Re: Checking out new Winnebago EV's

Can't speak to the deal for your Westy, but I just got a 5-speed '95 (with
furnace;without ABS) for $29K plus tax and license. This included the awning and
the rear-hatch add-a-room options. You can probably go lower; I decided to give
my business to the people who treated me decently and made the experience a
pleasant one, low-price be damned.....
