&gt;Hello Mark.  The racks your are probably referring to are made by 
&gt;Paulchen of Germany.  These racks are the Rolls Royce of racks for 
&gt;many different vehicles.  They are light, very strong, and can be 
&gt;outfitted with many different options to contain various objects.  
&gt;Bikes, kayaks, storage boxes, skis, etc.  They fold out of the way 
&gt;when not it use, and they lock onto the tailgate lid.  No holes are 
&gt;dilled into the body.  The rack can support over 200 lbs.  They are 
&gt;very popular on Vanagon's in Canada.  They run arounc $400 CDN for a 
&gt;basic configuration.  These racks WILL NOT damage your vehicle.
&gt;
&gt;Wishing I had a Paulchen
&gt;Harry.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Recently I've noticed a couple of Vanagons with interesting looking sport 
&gt;&gt; racks mounted on the rear hatch. The racks appear to be made just for the 
&gt;&gt; Vanagon. They are constructed of black tubing, approximately 1/2&quot; to 3/4&quot;
&gt;in 
&gt;&gt; diameter and mount to the top and bottom edges of the hatch. Anyone know
&gt;who 
&gt;&gt; makes/sells these racks?
