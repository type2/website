Subject: Need advice on '77 bus
Date: 27 Nov 1994 15:15:48 -0500
 

Hello all, I'm looking for some advice on what I should do with my old '77
bus. I was still using it in '87 when a CV joint broke. I towed it to my
parent's place to repair at a later date. Shortly after that, I bought a new
'87 vanagon, which is still running fine today at 107K miles. I repaired the
CV joint on the '77, but with the new van I just didn't have the incentive to
get it back on the road.
 
So, the '77 has been sitting around ever since '87. I did start it up every
now and then just so that the engine would not lock up or anything. It's been
setting outside for most of the time. It's been inside for a while now,
though. There is quite a bit of rust on the outside, but the floorboards are
solid. If I had the time and money I would restore it. The engine has the
exhaust studs broke off, but that is the only thing that I know is wrong with
the engine. A few week ago I drove it around in my grandfather's field and it
shifts beautifully and has plenty of power. The engine is a 2.0 fuel injected.
 
My question is (finally) should I just junk this thing, or is it worth
something to someone? It seems a shame to just scrap the engine and trans, and
the body could be fixed. Also the interior is in pretty good shape.
 
Thanks for any advice.
 
Later. . .. . . Brad
