Has anyone thought of or designed an above the head console for storage,
tapes, lights, tools, etc? This would fit above the driver and front
passenger.

JC WHitney has one that that fits most vans and looks a lot like something
you see in aircraft with the airflow vents and directed lights.....too
expensive though!
