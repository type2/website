Subject: Mushy Ignitionn

Hello,

I have a friend with an '86 Water-Cooled Vanagon who is complaining of a
&quot;mushy&quot; ignition. When engaged, it does not good contact right way, as if
the whole unit was way worn.

Has anyone else had a similar problem or know of an inexpensive cure? Thanks
in advance!

RAS
