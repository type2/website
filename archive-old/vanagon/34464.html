Subject: &quot;Volkswagen: A Week at the Factory&quot;

	I saw a neat little book the other day:

		&quot;Volkswagen: A Week at the Factory&quot;
		(Chronicle Books, 1992)

	This is a collection of black &amp; white industrial photos taken by
Pete Keetman in 1953 at the factory in Wolfsburg. It follows the
creation of  VW's from stacks of sheet metal to row upon row of
brand new '53 bugs and buses parked in their lot. Yum...!

	Those of you Volks in the middle of restoration projects will drool 
over the photos of stacks of body parts, brand new and ready for 
paint, piled up on the factory floor...hundreds of beetle wings, floor 
pans, bus roofs.... 

	 Oh for a time machine and a big shopping cart!

              were piled together on the floor)
   '71 Bus (In my future I hope!)
