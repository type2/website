Subject: Re: Power Steering

     I had the power steering rack to leak down all of a sudden when my 85
Vanagon was about 5 years old.  The rack had blown it gaskets.  7 years ago a
new power steering rack was going to cost $600.00.  
     I bought a gasket kit for $99.00 at the local VW dealership and took it
back for a refund when I discovered that I could not get into the rack unit.
 I finally found a manual rack for $150 at a junkyard and replaced it.  Can't
tell much difference except when the front tires get low on air pressure.
