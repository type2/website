     Not mine, of course.

     Listmember Alex Munro spotted this one in Tacoma, Washington.  I
     tracked down some details.

     90 Syncro Westie
     One owner (traded in on an Audi Quattro-why not have both?), 70K-80K
     miles, roll out awning, portapottie (?),TV and VCR, white color, grey
     interior, &quot;very clean for a vehicle of this age&quot;.

     Price? He said, &quot;Oh, 19-20, something like that&quot;. Well, I asked him
     to check. He looks it up...asking $21,995, so I suppose they are
     hoping to get $19-20. Offer $17!

     Contact:

     Ihave no commercial interest, of course, just doing this to try to get
     all good examples into good hands...
