&gt;Joel's recent repost of a forsale notice for an '86 Westfalia
&gt;included mention of a &quot;slide-in captain's chair for seating 5&quot;.
&gt;I have heard of these, and I sure would like to have something to
&gt;seat an extra person or two (the Westy is just a 4-seater!).  Was
&gt;this a dealer option?  Are there any aftermarket outfits that
&gt;make a seat for this?  I have been told by a couple of local
&gt;van customizers that they could improvise something, but I'd
&gt;rather get a proven product.

yup. it was a dealer-orderable option on the 85 - 87 campers (i don't think
it was available in the u.s. before 85 and i don't recall seeing it after
87).

now ... here's the rub: $$$$$$. i wanted to replace my 2-person bench in the
middle with two of these single seat camper captain's chairs. ok. no big
deal, right? wrong. try to find a camper in a junkyard ... then try to find
two that have that option. good luck.

ok. just buy the thing from the dealer. how much could it possibly cost?
well, it seems they wanted about $800 EACH!

needless to say, i still have my bench seat in the bus. :)  but i'm still
looking and thinking. :)  i'm semi-thinking about building/welding a box
and putting a driver's seat on it. that's basically what the camper extra
chair is. and it (camper chair) has the swivel plate of the camper front
seats. the box under the factory one has a pull out drawer for storage, and
the seat belts come out with the whole chair. it bolts to the little 'runner'
that the bench seats also bolt to.

i've not seen anything aftermarket that looks like it would work as well ...
all the van custom stuff sits on pedestal-type mounts, and me personally, i
don't like that idea.  i think the welded box would be better.

my other thought was to split the 2-person bench seat and get some upholstery
shop to mend the split. only trouble is, you don't have any armrests like the
camper chair does.  so i'm back to getting two more front seats, and making
some sort of box for them. but that's another 'project' ... :)

anybody that wants to do this, let me know and i'll send you a xrox copy of
my 'project' papers.
