&gt; 
&gt; With regards your posting, number
&gt; 
&gt; &quot;4/Used '90 or '91 Vanagon Westy around US$10k&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; I have spent the last two months looking for a '91 Westy and have not found
&gt; anything decent for US$10k
&gt; 
&quot;Around&quot; has to be given a fairly wide interpretation I guess, and I
agree that finding the bus you want is difficult especially if it's
a camper and your very particular about what you want. Several listees
can attest to this. Tom F. and Shawn W. gave very detailed reports to the 
list from their Westy hunting experiences. See the archives.
Difficulty variries with area, and some people have travelled far
to get their busses. My approach is to be patient, and check all
the local small ad's magazines. Locally in Rochester we have
at least 10 different ones. Remember that the more unlikely place
an ad shows up in, the more chance that you are the first caller.
The more widely advertized (internet!) the more potential buyers.

I should say that these are not the prices I'm used to seeing on the Internet,
but the Internet is not the place I expect to see the best deals
(as argued above). 

Good luck,
Martin

&gt; I have found 2 Westies in the $22K range with low miles, well maintained.
&gt; The first had 29,000 miles and sold before I could make an offer at $22,000.
&gt; The second was listed at $22,500 and I am second in line to get it with 36,000
&gt; miles. If you know where I can ger a '91 Westy with low miles in excellent
&gt; condition for $10K I would love to hear from you. I have found '89s and '87s
&gt; for $18,500 and better with 80,000 miles, rebuilt engines etc.
&gt; 
&gt; What kind of condition and how many miles would you '91 have at $10K?
