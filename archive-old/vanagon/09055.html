Per Alan Torrigino:

V&gt; I mounted my racks to the poptop of my '84 Westy using the Yakima bolt on
 &gt; rain gutters that mount on the _side_ of the top. I forget what the name of
 &gt; this adaptor is but it was made to mount on a Bronco and mounts with four
 &gt; bolts per plate. Very important as the load will be in shear rather then
 &gt; tension.  I mounted them as far back as possible to get the load out of the
 &gt; windstream created by the front windshield. The back set is touching the
 &gt; rear hinge.

 Alan, how did you go about mounting those rain gutters? Any trouble with
 those bolts rusting and causing a rust &quot;dribble&quot; down the fiberglass. I'm
 thinking of dipping them in silicone before I put them in.

HATE drilling holes where no holes exisited before....
