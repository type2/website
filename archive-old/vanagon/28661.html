Subject: RE: 1980 Vanagon Engine Work


&gt;I've read about people dropping the engine on buses up to 79.  I'm looking 
at
&gt;a engine overhaul and exhaust work on a 1980 Vanagon Camper I bought.
     &lt;snip&gt;
&gt;I just left my friendly neighborhood VW specialist and he'll do the job for
&gt;$5,000 plus -  Ouch :-(

I've never rebuilt an engine either. But for many VWs (and a Ford Mustang
V8) I've taken out the engine, bought a rebuilt long block, transferred
all the outside stuff (carb, gen, clutch, cooling, etc.) from the old to
the new, installed the new, and driven away smiling. Eventually. It costs
a lot less than what your friendly(?) VW guy said, and puts you on a first
name basis with your bus. And it can be done by some one like me-- certainly
no pro-level mechanic. I've never done a Vanagon, however.

NOTE OF INTEREST (MAYBE): I just bought an '80 Vanagon from a guy who
put a Chevrolet 2800 V6 into it, using the adapter kit from Kennedy
Engineered Products (KEP). The kit goes for around $550, the engine
anywhere from $500 to $1000 depending on condition and completeness, and
you have to fabricate a few parts. Uses the original Vanagon clutch.
If you're spending the money anyway, you might consider this option.
KEP makes adaptors for many different engines into VWs.
