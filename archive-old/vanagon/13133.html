&gt; Uh, I disagree.  Only stripif you really have to, and are prepared to
&gt; handle repainting from bare metal.  The sanding and primering are good,
&gt; and throw in a good coat of sealant.

    From doing a few bus paint jobs as well as about five or six
other jobs, I agree with Thom, in actuality bare metal is only for
a total resto or a show car, for your average job simply

1: DEGREASE WELL (this is most important, with a quality product
                 (PPG DITZLER ACRYLICLEAN IS THE BEST I HAVE SEEN)

2: Do body work, finish sand all over with 220 to 320 wet for bite.
   Wash liberally with clean water then dry and degrease again.

3: Shoot a coat of good sealant. (if you want and suspect
   incompatibility of original and your primer to follow,
   remember most sandable primers are laquer based and will
   sometimes lift even original well hardened enamel)

4: Shoot a coat of good primer.

5: Sand the primer with at least 320 wet wash then degrease well and 
   shoot the topcoats (clearcoat is nice).

In general on a normal repaint only go to bare metal if it is really
necessary like if the roof of a bus has oxidized and etched down to the
metal, in any case if you go to bare metal you must before any paint
use a chemical etchant preferably one leaving a zinc coating or at least
use a metal etching primer.  It is then nice to shoot one of those
catalyzed polyester filler primers to fill the paterns etched from
exposure.
    A good tip that will make the job particularly on a Vanagon
or bus is to find someone near you if you are not doing yourself and
pull all the windows befor painting, they won't have to mask, it will
make for an entirely better job and will look 1000% better even compared
to a well masked job, similarly pull all the exterior emblems and
doorhandles, you'll thank yourself for the little extra time when the
paint doesn't peel back from weatherstrip and when you don't have to
look at the disgusting overspray on rubber, mask the door weatherstip
well also.  I prefer PPG paints if you are not going with an exotic OEM
like GLASURIT. Dupont, and RM are OK as well but stay away from cheap
part store stuff, usually the quality stuff is not much more, if you are
doing yourself you might have to shoot laquer (dries) but in general use at
least hardened (with urethane) acryllic enamel or urethanes for
longetivity and chip resistance.  There are a couple really good do it
yourself books, I cant remember titles but o good starter one i recall
is paperback about 3/8&quot; thick and has an older red 911 on the front.

Good luck,
John Anderson
