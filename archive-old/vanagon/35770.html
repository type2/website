&gt;&gt; Also consider a weird one that happened to me. One of my 69's rear brake
&gt;&gt; drum splines just plain wore out. The stub axel splines were fine, but the
&gt;&gt; matching ones in the drum wore/rusted to paper thinness and then sheared
&gt;&gt; off one day when I tried to pull away from the curb. Just a slight
&gt;&gt; tick-clicking (not the clacking I've heard from CV's) was present. This
&gt;&gt; problem is possibly the least expensive of your suspects. Good luck!
&gt;
&gt;So this happened more than once, the same happened to me on a '73 Bug
&gt;left rear drum, the axle nut wasn't tightened correctly.

Lack of proper torque on axle nut is source of failure here.  Need to buy the
proper tools.
