Sorry to get metaphysical so far from Friday, but:
&gt; 
&gt; I'm happy to discuss my reasoning
&gt; with everyone, but frankly, I don't think I am going to change my mind about
&gt; this unless someone runs two identical engines in a laboratory, etc.
                           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Obviously, identical engines do not exist.  Nor identical conditions.
