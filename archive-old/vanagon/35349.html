To All:

Appending a downloadable file containing a virus or other sociopathic
attention-getter to an e-mail message is a common ploy of the dweebs.

Some software automatically downloads appended files.  Even with software
that provides the option of NOT automatically downloading, if the user is not
familiar with the hazards, they are liable to select the automatic download
option, theirby making their systems more vulnerable to penetration than
should be the case.

Unsolicited files should never be allowed into your system.  And considerate
persons do not send junk mail.

Lists such as this survive largely due to the thoughtfulness and maturity of
its members, and the courtesy they display toward one another..

-Bob
