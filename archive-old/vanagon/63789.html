Well If ou have the original in, you will soon have to replace it anyway   
as the new federal laws require a different type of refrigerant ( 134A?)   
.  The old compressors can't use the new &quot;green&quot; stuff.  However, have   
you determined if the compressor is bad or just simply low on freon?

You might still be able to get the old refrigerant ( R 112), however,   
since it is illegal to manufacture it, the price will almost be   
unbearable.  You can still use the old stuff legally, it is a big   
problem, however, finding it at an earthling price.

The AC compressor robs any car from precious horsepower, including the   
V8's.  My experience has been with my 85 that the power loss is not   
anymore significant than any other car.  Yes, loosing power on the   
Vanagon is a bigger deal than on a GMC Yukon but the loss is inevitable.

As per taking the A/C out, you must be certain that there is absolutely   
no freon left.  Warm air could indicate no freon, little freon or lots of   
freon and a bad compressor.  All that freon is still under pressure so be   
super careful.  I recommend taking it to a pro to ensure there is no   
freon left.

I have heard that the A/C system is not that difficult to remove, just a   
lot of work.  That's about all I know.

Subject: AC - To junk or not to junk

Hello all. I have an '85 Westie with the original AC installed. The AC
does not get cool any more and I am considering pulling the whole thing
out to recover the storage space. I live in Seattle and rarely need AC.
Also, with my automatic, I can't imagine robbing any engine power to run
the AC -- it is too slow as it is. Questions:

1) Are AC units cheap to fix?
2) Would it damage anything to remove the unit (carefully)?
3) Would anyone be interested in purchasing/inheriting the unit if I
take it out?

Thanks.

Scott Semyan
