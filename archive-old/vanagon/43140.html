Subject: Corrado Powered Westy Syncro - For Sale

Syncronauts - Here is the scoop on the Corrado Westy Syncro!

The vehicle is in Santa Barbara, sellers name is Ran Bullard.  Tel: 805 569 8830
Sonds like a very interesting guy - his reason for selling is that he has
built a steam powered boat which weighs 10,000lb and needs a big vehicle to
tow it.  Apparently the boat goes through the water absolutely quietly with
wood fuel!

Anyway he bought the Bordeaux (Burgandy) Westy Syncro late 1990 new.
Thought it was underpowered and soon after began looking for a replacement
engine.  At around 30,000 miles he found a Corrado supercharged engine in
Portland.  It was in a brand new Corrado that was rolled on a test drive -
30 miles on the clock.  He purchased the entire engine and computer etc.
It has been in the Westy for 60,000 miles and going beautifully.  He sold
the 30k Vanagon engine to someone who put it in an 89.

The conversion was pretty simple he said.  Main problems were mating the
computer from the Corrado to the Vanagon and the exhaust system.  He tilted
the engine like the diesel and put on a VW diesel starter.  Had to get a
new fuel tank from Germany - exactly like the original but with an extra
indentation.  EPA had not approved it and would not allow its import.  He
got it sent to Canada and then reshipped to SB!  The whole job took about
3.5 months.

Here is the interesting part - the only signs of the swap on the exterior
is a G60 emblem on the rear door and a 3&quot; diam exhaust pipe!

Other details:  89,000 total miles, 5 speed, diff lock, power door locks,
PW, UNGO Alarm system, $4000 stereo!  Centra 15&quot; wheels, 225R75 tires,
Kennedy clutch, bunch of reading lights, waxed weekly, absolutely
immaculate!  Passes CA exhaust test with about 1/10th pollutants of regular
VW!  He said that the tester thought his machine was broken and after
checking the guy placed a metal sticker to the door frame to explain the
readings.

Price around $30,000 - he says he has $50,000 in it and has been working on
VW's all his life!  I have not seen it but I can go look when I get a day
spare if there is interest.  I certainly would like to do that!  For more
info go to the seller.
