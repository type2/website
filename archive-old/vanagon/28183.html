see  attached for background......

I spoke to a california tranny rebuilder and I believe he said that a guy he 
knows is returning every 18 months for tranny rebuilds with an installed 3+ 
liter porsche.

I also am interested in more horsepower and the same california tranny 
rebuilder said that kennedy engineering has a kit in the works for a subaru 
turbo DOHC that will turn about 190 hp.

(I referred to the calif. tranny rebuilder anonymously 'cause i didn't want 
to misquote or otherwise misrepresent)

|     &gt;We've been wondering why the South African Syncros don't use the
|     &gt;larger Audi 2.5 litre motor that their 2WD Vanagons use and I
|     &gt;recalled something that suggests the answer.
|
|     &gt;I remember when I used to correspond with ultra-high-end aftermarket
|     &gt;company Oettinger (germany) that their six cylinder Vanagon motors
|     &gt;came in a 180HP version and a 135HP version (approx. going from
|     &gt;memory). They wouldn't install the higher HP of these two motors in
|     &gt;any Syncro as they said the 4x4 transmission could not stand it. :-(
|
|     Yet the 3.2l Porsche 911 engine MSDS uses is installed in a Syncro.
|     In stock configuration, that must be about a 230hp engine. We need to
|     talk to him about how the drivetrain has held up; certainly, he
|     will know the weak links.
|
|     My confidence that we (Syncro owners) could handle substantially more
|     HP was based on the fact that MSDS has demonstrated the 911
|     conversion, and it appears successful. Some of these conversions,
|     specifically the Audi non-turbo 5, are similar in HP to the Oettinger
|     4 cyl. engine.
