&gt; QUESTION
&gt; I do have a question for y'all tho?  The seals on my doors are totally 
&gt; shot. Where
&gt; would be the cheapest place to find replacements.  I was wondering if they make
&gt; like a bulk stripping that could be used in the VW's, or do I have to 
&gt; go with the
&gt; premade ones that cost $$$$   $70+ just for the slider.  I don't want 
&gt; all this work I've
&gt; put into the bus to go to waste, but she leaks like a pasta strainer right now.

I replaced my drivers door seal with a new one from J.C. Whitney.  I think
it was about $25.  Works great!  We'll see how long it holds up.  My seals
are all in pretty bad shape too but the MOST annoying leak was right by my
left ear.  Now that that one is fixed, I think I can live with the others...
