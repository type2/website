Vanamaniacs,

Many o' question saved up:

Just off the list:

&gt;AVAILABLE:  Kitchen Unit from '84 Westy. 2 burner stove, sink w/pump and
3-way frig.  All works,VGC, have all hardware. Will give away for $500.00
plus shipping.  Also have middle 2 seater from '86 van.  Official Vanagon
Factory repair manual, paid $79.00 great condition, sell for $60.00 plus
$7.00 shipping. Call David (770) 422-7450  Kennesaw   (GA).&lt;

Called the above number due to great interest in kitchen unit and was told
it was not a working number... Anyone else strike out? Any other kitchen
units for sale? What are the options for a Syncro owning &quot;wannacamper&quot;
conversion. I see there is a RV show coming to town. Mostly Behemoths I
imagine...I'll keep my eyes open for potential vendors.

 My van  intermitantly sends oil warnings (ie. warning light and nasty
buzzer at 2000+ RPM). When this happens I shut-down and find other means of
getting to point B. On a couple of occasions the warnings have stopped when
I release the gas and the rpm's drop. More often, I just let the van sit
for a day or two and &quot;tadah!&quot; the warning signs are gone. What ya'll think?
A short? Wiring problem? Serious oil pump failure? All advise will be
taken...

 Drastically need a sound system tune up! Any suggestions? I know there are
many options and magazines full of  BOOMING automotive sound systems, but
what is suggested for a Vanagoniac whom wants some bass? Any thoughts on
speaker placement? Brands? etc?

Thanks for any input!     R.
