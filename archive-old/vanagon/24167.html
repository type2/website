Subject: Rolling Stone VWUS/Jerry Garcia Ad


While at the Lawrence, MA VW show Sunday, I overheard a conversation
regarding an ad in the next issue of the Rolling Stone from VW US.

Aparently its a line drawing of the front of a Splittie with a tear
rolling out of one side windshield and underneath &quot;Jerry Garcia 1942-1995&quot;.
I just went down to the bookstore on campus, and its not in the 9/7 issue
of RS....so it will probably be in the next issue.
