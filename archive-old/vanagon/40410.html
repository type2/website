Subject:  aerodynamics 

&gt;
&gt;&gt;My favorite sentence so far:  &quot;The closed body of clean and pleasing
&gt;&gt;countours offers extremely low air resistance.&quot;
&gt;
&gt;What's so strange about that?
&gt;
&gt;A bus is much more aerodynamic than, say, the Oscar Meyer Wienermobile.
&gt;Or the vehicle that brings the Space Shuttle from the Assembly Building
&gt;out to the launch pad.   :^)


 What about a Zamboni? Any bets?

What about a 61 Caddy?
