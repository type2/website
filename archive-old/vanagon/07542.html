&gt; 
&gt; &gt; dashboard lights work and I have a brand new set of heater/ventilation 
&gt; &gt; knobs effective today and the new brake and clutch pedal covers for the 
&gt; &gt; ones that were not there (I was scratching up those nasty dress shoes I 
&gt; &gt; make myself wear to work).  BTW thanks to Mr. Stone in the People's 
&gt; &gt; Republic of Scarberia ;-)  for the Wiring Diagrams.
&gt; 
&gt; Where did you get the new pedal covers?
&gt; 
At my closest VW dealer, Jim Ellis in Chamblee/Atlanta, GA.  
Surprisingly cheap, all things considered at $2.40 each, the entire set 
of heater/vent slides (4) was just over ten dollars and the biggest 
surprise to me is that they actually have all this stuff in stock. I 
figured they'd have the pedal covers but the slides surprised me.&gt; 

Thanks for the advise on the seat, I got the bolts out but the rest was a 
mystery (still no owner's manual and Bentley doesn't cover this among 
other things, such as '85 model AC) --
