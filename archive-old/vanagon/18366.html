Subject: bodega pack.list


Please note Bradley's prod to take care of the mixtix reservations thing.
At Bodega Dunes, there are 2 vehicles allowed per site.  To insure space
then, at least one of your duo will have to have the mistix reservation.
To insure ADJACENT space, at least one will have to get there as early
as the park allows (which I think is 2 p.m. on Friday, although they,
like other parks we've encountered, may be flexible on this).  

In the meantime, here's the updated general list of things to bring:

Things to bring to Bodega:
charcoal for BBQ - and we need a BBQ ceo volunteer
your own bird to BBQ on Friday evening
