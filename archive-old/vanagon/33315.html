Subject: Got my diesel Vanagon home.

Well it's here.  I bought it knowing it had a bad clutch in it.  The PO was
originally going to follow me home in case I needed a tow.  In the end, he
felt that it would be best just to hook it up to his full size van and tow
it the 15 miles to my house.  Pretty harsh on the brakes, but we did okay.

After he left, I started it up and drove it around the neighborhood for half
and hour.  It only slips if you get on it (an oxymoron with the diesel),
though it doesn't &quot;release&quot; all the way.  So it either needs a pressure
plate (besides the disk and seals), or they backed off the clutch adjustment
in hopes of stopping the slip.  I never hit fourth gear, but below that it
has more power than I thought it would.  I wasn't worried about hurting my
neck, but it goes okay.  It isn't any louder inside than our old '75 gas
Rabbit, and maybe slightly louder than our '79 bus.

He had told me that he had some extra parts to throw in.  When I got there I
looked in back, and here's what I got:

-A good cylinder head from a 1600 solid lifter.  It won't fit the Vanagon,
but it will fit the Golf I just bought.

-Two injector pumps, one of which is brand new and the other is good.

-Two alternators

-A starter.

-Axle nut tool (the kind you whale with a hammer).

A couple other things that have slipped from short term memory (I forget
why), but that's the highlights.  I noticed that I've also got a bone dry CV
grunching away back there (funny what you can hear while tooling down the
road with the engine shut down).  The kids are already calling it the Magic
School Bus, and are hounding me to go out and look at it right now.

Later.
