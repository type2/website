Subject: RE: Tach for '84


&gt;&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt;&gt; Hi Folks - has anyone tried to retrofit the tach from the &gt;85 vans
&gt;&gt; into
&gt;&gt; an '84? My '84 has a clock where it SHOULD have a tach; said clock
&gt;&gt; has
&gt;&gt; inset fuel and wassertemp gauges (at 6 and 12 o'clock,
&gt;&gt; respectively). 

Been there, Done that. I installed a complete guage cluster from an '88 
into my '82 Westy diesel. The only thing that was different was the 
placement of the wires in the big plastic connector that the cluster 
plugs into. With a few hours of quality time with the Bentley, I was able 
to re-position all of the wires in the connector to the appropriate 
spots. Absolutely no cutting of any wire was nesc.

Now, I just need to get a gas engine to drive that tach.....
