Subject: Re: Oil on the rear window!!! Thanks.

Thanks for all the answers....  I guess I was the originator of that thread,
 but I must add that the leak is only while driving, and is accelerated by
highway speeds.

There is not much clue under the engine for where it is coming from.  So I
have been in the habit of filling to the 2/3 full level,  but every once in
awhile, someone else fills it for me....  Those are the times I consider
really trying to track the source. But, I live near Seattle, and every time
this happens, we are in the middle of a rainy period.  By the time the rain
stops, the leak is done also!

So, maybe some day, when the Sun comes out and I'm not too busy trying to
cram in all the recreation I can,  I'll fill the oil to the brim and hang out
on the rear bumper at 65 MPH and that should be the end of the mystery,  if
not me!

Thanks to all!
