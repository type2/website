&gt;Hello Friends.
&gt;
&gt;Out of the blue, a '57 23-window has become available, and I don't know if I
&gt;should buy it or not.  Here's the scoop:
&gt;
&gt;'57 23-window.  No major rust, has all the chrome, good canvas sunroof, the
&gt;original interior, the jail bars, even the original glass tail-lights, etc.
&gt;No engine.  It is in superb shape.  The guy wants $3500 for it.  
&gt;
&gt;It needs a new paint job, and brake work. (And an engine.)  I do have my
&gt;tricked out 1776cc for it though.
&gt;
&gt;I have to go look at it and make a deposit by 2:00 MST or else another guy is
&gt;going to get it.
&gt;
&gt;If anyone has _any_ suggestions, mail me now!  I really appreciate it!
&gt;
&gt;Is this price in line with the rest of the country (excluding CA, of
&gt;course!)?

Without the motor? Hmmm.  That would be a bargain in California!  Kombis
are fetching $2000-$4000.

I would buy it.  These don't pop up very often!
