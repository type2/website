   You may or may not  want to replace the glove box with an
   older style shelf. This is why the panel is &quot;predrilled&quot;

&gt; Shortly after embarking on our first trip in our new '88 Westfalia, my wife
&gt; commented that she would really like a 'pocket' on her door like the one on
&gt; the driver's side door.  Well, I could understand that right away, 'cause I
&gt; liked the convenience of the one on the driver's side.
&gt;
&gt; So I ordered one for the passenger side door.  Upon taking the passenger
&gt; side interior door panel off, to install the pocket, I found the panel was
&gt; pre-drilled, as I had expected to mount the door pocket.  Ah,,, all is
&gt; well, fits like a charm.
&gt;
&gt; It was a week later that I tried to open the glove box (on the passenger
&gt; side naturally) with that side's door closed.... Guess what.  The glove box
&gt; won't open now with the door closed!
&gt;
&gt; I may be able to make some small adjustments to both to enable enough of an
&gt; opening to stuff something in or grab something with a slim hand, but the
&gt; clearance is probably the reason why VW didn't put pockets on both doors in
&gt; 1988.
