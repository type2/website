Dan,

very nice descriptions of your mirrors. I have this problem
every three years, but with right tools it is fixed on a
one-minute highway stop.

Open the feet of your mirrors with a Philips screw driver and
tight the bolt inside with a metric range 10. Do not tight to
hard, you may adjust the mirrors after this.

This from my mind, I've done it two years ago, sorry if the
dimension is wrong. But next year I can give you an update
when I have to fix my ones too :-)
