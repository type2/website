&gt;All the recent threads re: flammable substances, exploding batteries and
&gt;other general stupidity made me think that others on the list have
&gt;encountered other interesting road hazards. Anyone care to share?

the funniest (? ... you had to be there), to me at least, was the sofa that
unstrapped itself from the back of a pickup, LEAPED into the air at a bump,
and slide along the asphalt at 60 mph ... until it was drop-kicked into the
median by an 18-wheeler!

i was a ways behind the 18-wheeler and he never hit his brakes so i don't
know if he wasn't watching ... or just did it on purpose to &quot;clear the road&quot;.
but it &quot;just sailed right out there ... just sailed right out there ...&quot;. :)

the pickup never knew it had lost anything. just kept right on going.
