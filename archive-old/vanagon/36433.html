It was written:

&gt;&gt;It doesn't hurt to
&gt;&gt;write (with white shoe polish) on the rear window of the towee's
vehicle,
&gt;&gt;&quot;CAR IN TOW.&quot;  If you live down South, or somewhere where most of the
&gt;&gt;residents can't read, this might not help.
&gt;&gt;

should
&gt;&gt;try that there Powerbait what's made by Berkeley... :-)
