&gt;My Dad bought a new Alpine in '60, and regretted it once Sunbeam started
&gt;stuffing engines larger than the entire car into them. Had an eye for
&gt;Tigers ever since, and forgot the Ghia &lt;hanging head in shame&gt;

actually it was Carroll Shelby of Shelby Cobra Fame who was stuffing Ford
Motors in the Alpines... He started in '63 with a 260 V8, 64 with the 289 V8,
and last but not least 
'round '66 or so with 302 V8..

Maxwell Smart also drove an Opel GT coupe in the last Season....
