Subject: Bus Capitol of the World

I was in Jerusalem last fall and I noticed an inordinate number of old 
busses, singles and doubles...
I spent alot of time drooling-
The Palestinians of East Jerusalem seem to be EXCELLENT mechanics.
Does anyone know of a specific reason why the VW bus is so prevalent 
among this people?

Just Curious,
Corbin Connell
'65 bus.
