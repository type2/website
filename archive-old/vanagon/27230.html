Subject: Tailgating


All--

Another perspective on the tailgating issue, in the form of a story 
recognizable to all of you with daoist leanings.

When you are crossing a river and another boat strikes yours, you stand, 
shake your fist, and scream with anger at the helmsman.  But when a boat 
strikes yours, and you notice it has no one in it, you say to yourself, 
&quot;empty boat,&quot; shrug your shoulders, and row on.

When someone treats me stupidly on the highway, I think of this story and 
say to myself, &quot;empty boat.&quot;  It helps with the anger.

Mark
