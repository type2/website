It may not be the entire problem but you've got to start somewhere. Fix the
thermostat, diesel ignition is caused from heat. The heat from the
compression being at 23 to 1 is all it needs. Diesels gum up if they're not
run hot. If the problem persists try running ATF in your fuel. It doesn't
matter if it's Dextron or Mercon. ATF is a very high detergent and helps
keep your injection system clean.

&gt;P.S.  Thermostat seems to be stuck open, little heat and the needle doesn't
&gt;move off cold ( I know the guage does work after taking the car over the
