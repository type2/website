Subject: RE:  Vanagon Engine Swap Alternative

For those individuals who are interested in more power here are three=20
options:  two apply to 2.1 liter engines (1986 and later), three to 1.9
liter engines (1983-85=BC

1.  If you have a 1.9 liter engine and it's time for a rebuild consider
sending your crankshaft out to be stroked to the same specs as the 2.1
liter engine.  Then reassemble the engine with 2.1 liter pistons.  If=20
you throw in a mild RV cam, you should experience approximately a 15-18%
increase in performance - approximately 100 Hp.  A nice boost for a very
modest investment.  If you are interested - email me directly, and I'll=20
give you any assistance I can:  technical advice, suppliers, etc.

This options adds between $250.00 and $500.00 to your overhaul costs.
Dependw on how you want the crank stroked and whether you go for=20
lightening the flywheel and balancing the entire reciprocating assembly.
Its also a great way to save a crank with a bad journal.

2.  If you have either a 1.9 or 2.1 liter engine, a modest performance=20
boost can be realized by replacing the stock throttle body with a larger=20
one.  Weber had one available several years ago, but they are currently=20
out of production.  I'd appreciate it if anyone knows where a supply of
these might be.  Another option might be to adapt an overbore Rabbit=20
throttle body.  If anyone is interested in this let me know, as a=20
collegue of mine (Ben Watson - you might recognize the name form one of=20
the books on Bosch Injection Systems) has indicated that this might be=20
a viable alternative.  Should work well in conjunction with #1 above.

3.  A third option for all engine is turbocharging.  There is a fellow in=
=20
the Seattle area that successfully races turbocharged waterboxer engines=20
in sand rails, producing over 150 Hp reliably.  If there is enough=20
interest, perhaps we could convince someone to take on the project and=20
&quot;kit&quot; the turbo.

I invite your comments.
