Subject: methyl hydrate/methanol/MTBE use

The term 'methyl hydrate' thru me for a loop, nomenclature-wise, so i 
had to do some checking around.  It appears methyl hydrate is one of 
the common names for:

methanol
wood alcohol
methylated spirits
methyl alcohol

all being the same animal.  someone please correct me if i'm 
inaccurate here.

anyway.  methanol COULD be used to lower emissions but it has some 
drawbacks.  first, the mechanism of lowering emissions is by 
introducing additional O2 in the combustion process (methanol = 
CH3-OH) thereby producing a cleaner burn.  

HOWEVER, methanol has some inherent problems with fuel systems. 
when 'gasohol' was first introduced it got a bad rap for causing
fuel system problems.  while there were many factor for this,
probably the most significant reason was that METHANOL was initially
used in the gasahol formulations.  methanol raises havoc with
certain types of rubber components in needle valves, vacuum
diaphragms, fuel pumps, etc.  methanol also contributes to fuel
system corrosion and is to be avoided at all costs in fuel injected
vehicles for this reason.

ETHANOL, on the other hand, IS more compatible with fuel systems and 
is currently the component in gasahol, at least in most states.  it 
also lowers emissions to a degree by the same mechanism as methanol.  
had the gasahol been intially introduced with an ethanol formulation, 
the negative reaction to gasahol would have been much less.

gas-line anti-freezes come in two flavors, methanol based and 
isopropyl based.  if you have a fuel injected vehicle, always choose 
an isopropyl-based anti-freeze to reduce the chance of fuel component 
corrosion.  BTW, don't add the 'rubbing alcohol' so commonly sold in 
drug stores as it hydrated with 30% water and is not an effective 
fuel additive at that point.  due to the chemical properties of 
isopropyl, it can only practically be made at about %95 strength, the 
remaining 5% being water.  occasionally you can purchase pharmacy 
grade 95% isopropyl, it is marked such on the botttle.

back to emissions. what IS added to fuels to specifically reduce
emissions (and engine knock) is MTBE or methyl tert-butyl ether. 
this is a volatile organic compound derived from methanol (derived
from natural gas) that is added to gasoline either seasonally or
year-round in many parts of the US to increase the octane level and
to reduce CO and ozone levels in the air.  it can be a very regional
additive to target high-smog areas.

the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 mandate that compounds that add 
oxygen be added either seasonally or year round in areas that exceed 
the air-quality standards and currently oxygenates are added to more 
than 30% of the gas in the US.  estimates by the Oxygenated Fuels 
Association figure that by the end of the decade, more than 70% of 
the fuels will contain oxygenates.  MTBE is commonly used because of 
its low cost, ease of production, and favorable transfer and blending 
characteristics.  gas can contain up to 15% MTBE by volume.  in 1993, 
MTBE ranked secon among all organic chemicals manufactured in the US 
at a worth of about $3 billion.  can you say 'Stock Investment?'
