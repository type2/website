Subject: Van Update 

All,


	Well thats my christmas break over and i spent most of it lying
	on my gravel drive under the van. As you may remember i could
	not select any of the gears before, and removal of the gearbox
	was required. Well with the gearbox out i removed the nosecone
	and found that the actual selector rod (the hockystick shaped
	piece of metal that pulls the gears out) looking at it from the
	top it was slightly curved but the original one was straight
	(easy mistake to make!) so we replaced that. Also we discovered
	that the clutch was stuck because it had been sitting around for
	such a long time, with this freed everything was replaced and she
	started after a couple of attempts.
	The only thing i think that its going to fail its MOT on is the 
	headlights being only 6 Volt i switched them on and they barely
	shone on the wall 2 Meters in front, i dont know how to get them
	any brighter, the bowls cannot be rechromed as its a special
	metal, but i am sure that slightly dull headlight bowls would not
	make that much different, any ideas?

Cheers,

	Ben Ryan
