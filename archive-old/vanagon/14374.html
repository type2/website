Well, this morning I bought myself a new toy.  1959 Dove Blue single
cab pick-up!  This one is really a nice one.  I can't believe this
one was within 20 minutes of me &amp; I never knew about it before.
Just goes to show you never know where these rascals are hiding out.

Now between the new 59 Single-cab and the new 64 Type 34 Karmann
Ghia, I've got to get rid of some of the others.  If anyone is around
the southeast looking for a 61 Single-cab or a 73 Westfalia mine are
officially up for adoption.
