ER&gt;Sure Wish I Could Find Deals Like That In Phoenix, AZ!

OH QUIT WHINING.

To all the rust belters out there I have seen paradise and it is AZ,
flew into Phoenix last weekend on business in Yuma, drove between
said cities.  I have never ever seen so many clean rust free VW's in
my life.  Bay buses all around, Bugs by the billions in Phoenix proper,
probably more than Jetta 2's and 3's together.  In Quartzite I saw
people
living in clean splittie campers.  BTW a real nice Thing for sale in
Yuma at
a place called something like The Buggy Works from what I saw after
hours through the fence.  Stopped by the Thing Shop formerly Trim Shop
in Phoenix to try to haggle on the Westy interior fabric they have. 
Frankly
I was not impressed, restoration of some parts meant spray painting
black
with some Krylon, shop was sort of dumpy compared to what I expected,
but
restoration of side curtains and tops seemed to be being done quite
nicely.
On a side note the owner seems a real jerk, his wife and other workers
nice
enough though.  Still I will likely order 1 roll of late
yellow/green/black/orange
Westy fabric if somebody wants some.  Price is $10/yd 54&quot; wide plus
shipping
charges, I should have 15+ yards after reserving enough for a future
recover
of the parents '77.  BTW they also have a fairly rust free 21 window
roof from
beltline up if someone wanted a project, minimal rust around sunroof
and skylights,
I do not know price, it is cut a few inches up the side windows.
