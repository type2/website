Responses are just my opinion of course....

&gt; Update, I did not buy that '93 GL, at least not yet, I'm trying to let 
&gt; the dealer simmer for a while.  So far I've only been able to get them 
&gt; down to 15,600 from 15,900, kinda irritating.
&gt; 
&gt; However, I did find a '93 MV about two hours away.  I went and checked it 
&gt; out last night.  It has 36,000 miles, is in generally good shape and they 
&gt; are asking $17,000 for it.  I haven't been able to contact the original 
&gt; owner yet and the dealers story is that a 50 year old woman owned it and 
&gt; traded it in on a Passat.
&gt; 
&gt; Here is my problem, I have only driven three Eurovans, this being the 
&gt; third.  One was a stick and the others were automatics.  The long and the 
&gt; short being that I do not have a feel for these things yet.
&gt; 
&gt; Question #1 --
&gt; I don't remember how the other Eurovan with an automatic that I drove 
&gt; felt, but the MV that I'm looking at (and really, really want) seemed 
&gt; kind indecisive about which gear to use, and jerked quite a bit when 
&gt; changing gears.  Could this be the reason this MV is $1,500 cheaper than 
&gt; any others I have found? Is this anything normal or characteristic?

If the MV is only $1600 more than the GL and the MV has auto the dollar 
and cents answer is simple.  MV.

I've always thought the auto in my MV was 'clunky'.  I got the only MV 
for sale in the area at the time or I would have gotten a stick.  There 
is a 'S' switch on the dash that changes the shifting characteristics of 
the EV.  If it was set differently between the two auto you drove it 
could lead to one feeling different.  I've never thought the EV felt 
indecisive about shifting.  I've wanted it to shift while it didn't and 
not when it did but thats why I prefer stick shifts.  Hard to really 
answer the question though without actually being able to compare it to mine.

&gt; Question #2 --
&gt; Regarding the dual A/C, the air in this one felt great in the front just 
&gt; like the other ones, but the rear A/C blower seemed kind weak.  Here 
&gt; again I don't really have anything to compare it to.  Can the rear air be 
&gt; diverted to other vents, reducing the flow?  Could it be all six roof 
&gt; vents being open, that makes it seem like it dosen't blow that hard?
&gt; What are your experiences with this?

THis bothers me.  My rear A/C can turn the large box into a refrigerator 
darned quickly.  The front A/C seems about the same as A/Cs in almost 
anything else I've driven.  The controls for the A/Cs take some getting 
used to.  I'm going to guess you aren't too familiar with the controls 
only because you've said you're not to familiar with EVs no insult 
intended by the base description .  Tor un the A/C at all you have to 
turn the front A/C on to one of the three A/C positions - Big Flake, 
Little Flake and 'double' flake.  For maximum, normal and split level 
A/C.  Its compressor and blower seem to be fully independant of the rear 
A/C other than the on/off/ function.  The rear A/C is set with the twist 
knob.  The blower with the other knob that I think is also a twist but 
has only certain places it can go.  Don't have the Van here at my 
computer of course so I have to go by memory though I go on 'auto-pilot' 
reflex in the Van.  If the Blower is set to max and coldness to max it 
should freeze you out in a relatively few minutes.  The kids are always 
telling me to cut the A/C down.  Remember though it is a BIG box so it 
isn't an instant comfort.  The front has much less volume to cool.

&gt; Question #3 --
&gt; What temperature do the engines usually run at?  Most the time while 
&gt; driving the MV it hovered about the half-way mark. Then I let it idle for 
&gt; about ten minutes in hot FL with both A/C's running.  The temp rose to 
&gt; about 3/4 and stabilized.  Is that about right?

I believe that sounds about right.  Idling with both A/Cs has got to be 
pretty hard on that engine.  I don't think mine gets as high as 3/4s but 
I'll have to check the Van while running it to consciously see the 
temperatures it runs at.

&gt; Question #4 --
&gt; Has anybody had any CV Joint experiences with these things are they more 
&gt; difficult to change that Vanagon CV's?

Mine's too young still.

&gt; Question #5 --
&gt; I really want to pull a 19 foot boat with this thing, does anybody have 
&gt; any towing experiences with the EV, and is a stick or automatic better?

I'm planning on towing VW THings behind my EV.  Just got the hitch 
yesterday and haven't installed it yet.  Other more technical types might 
be able to answer which is better stick or auto for towing.

&gt; Any responses would be greatly appreciated.  I really don't want to pour 
&gt; $17,00 down the drain.

The added features of the MV make it a far more valuable vehicle than an 
GL (IMHO).  The fold down bed and fold up table are used constantly in 
mine.  The easy pop out, fold up whatever rear facing seats have been 
very valuable too.  Wouldn't want to have to fuss with a 'two seater' 
compared to two single seaters.

Other than the A/C my inclination would be a the MV over the GL in the 
vehicles you've described here.  Others might feel differently of course.
