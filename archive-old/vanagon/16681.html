Subject: I've go to sell the syncro

Hi folks-

It's a sad time for me.  My wife and I are looking to buy a house and the
first thing that needs to go is my syncro.  (cash will help with the down
payment).  Anyway it's a 87'.  Here is a brief history....


Bought new 1993 with approximately 45,000 miles

Since then I have taken excellent care of it.  ie oil changes every 3000
miles, drained and replaced blue goo coolant every year.  Replaced just about
all sensors.  Had it tuned and maintained by VW.  With some hesitation.

Heads were replaced by VW at approximately 55,000 miles, no leaks etc.
New muffler and cat.
New rotors
New tires
Has a few small dents other than that exterior real good
Interior excellent, no stains etc.
Current mileage 70,000
Diff lock not working

What should i be asking for it??
I paid approximately $8,000 for it.
Your help would be appreciated.

ps.  once we have the house I've already warned my wife that i will be
looking for another one!!!!


Thanks 
Mike
