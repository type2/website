Subject: Free stuff!

	Folks,
	I've got the brand-new fan shroud that ECI send with my motor,
genuine made in Taiwan, with sorta cheap fresh-air ducts to the heater boxes.
It didn't have the nipple for the evaporative control stuff for my '70 bus
so I got the right shroud and this one's surplus. Complete, works, brand new,
doesn't have the little nipple on the starboard top that connects to the 
charcoal canister. FREE TO YOU!! Bay area people can just pick it up-
out-of-towners, it would probably cost about $7 to ship. Send me postage
when you get it. 
	First person who calls and can pick it up gets it. If you can't
pick it up, first person who wants it gets it AFTER we wait a week to 
see if someone will pick it up. I'll take names and numbers from the
first 3 people who call- #2 or #3 get it if #1 doesn't show up.

	I've also got some cool neoprene tubing. No particular VW
application, but you're a creative lot. 1.5 id, 1/8 wall thickness, 
8 foot lengths. I've got 10 sections of it. 

	I've also got a roll of grey vinyl- could be used as a
tarp, carpet protector, etc. 6' X 15?

	Finally, I've got some wire-reinforced air-duct tubing. Like the
cool aftermarket silicone rubber stuff I had on my 914, except this
is normal black rubber, so maybe not good for hot air connection? Who knows? 
The pieces are about 3.5 inches ID and 3 feet long or so. The wire 
reinforcement means you can bend it but it doesn't go flat. This is just
the thing for additional air-ducting with little fans, etc.
