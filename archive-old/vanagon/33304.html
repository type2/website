The block heater is really a fine idea, and I don't think it costs too 
much.  I'm not sure of its exact current draw, but it's fairly substantial 
(i.e. like flipping on the switch of a small space heater), so maybe a 
nice 12AWG extension cord would be best, despite its expen$e.  I plug in 
my diesel most nights via a timer that allows 3 hours of heating right 
before it's started up, which it then does like a champ.      

If no block heater is available and it's really cold out (10F or below), 
then the motor will start somewhat quicker WITHOUT the cold start lever, 
but once it starts the lever should be pulled out.  

I'm not sure if there are any retrofit kits to add a fuel line heater to 
your '86; 87's and later did get a fuel heating system (which 
recirculates diesel through a heat exchanger, letting the engine oil heat 
up the diesel and recirculate it through the fuel filter--though this 
wouldn't help on startup unless a block heater was used).  

All this being said, the be$t deal would probably be thinner oil (not too 
thin), diesel anti-gel, and a nice heavy-duty battery.  And don't forget 
extra &quot;flat fuses&quot; (50A) for your glow plugs.     

Good luck, and congrats on the new diesel!
