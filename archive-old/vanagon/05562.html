&gt; Does anyone out there carry a porta-john? Those available commercially seem
&gt; flimsy. I'm 6'4&quot; and 215 lbs and I don't want to gamble on paper thin plastic.

I can't vouch for anything currently available, but nearly 20 years ago
when I was 10 or 11, I would accompany my father and a bunch of similar
raving lunatics and hippies (there were _real_ hippies in the Pacific
NW at this time) on whitewater rafting and kayaking trips.  We had a
port-a-potti (TM) which held up well for us as well as some of the more
larger members of the troupe.  Port-a-potti is the brand made by
Thetford (thedford?), and they seem to be pretty well made.

Don't know what's happened to quality, etc, in the past 20 years, though.
