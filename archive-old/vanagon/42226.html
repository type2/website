Subject: Mid-Atlantic Camping Trip Announcement

A core group of DC area Syncronauts has zeroed in on the weekend 
of June 22-23 for a weekend of camping, off-roading, and admiring each
other's vehicles. Families encouraged. We'll do a pot-luck dinner 
Saturday night.

Though  we will have four or five Syncro Westies present, all 
listmembers are welcome. We'll make sure the campsite will be accessible 
to all vehicles, and it will also serve as a jumping off spot for people 
that want to go off road to get their vans dirty, pull tree stumps, and 
the like. 

Two general locations are under consideration: the Pine Barrens of 
New Jersey, perhaps with a side trip to the beach, or in the highlands 
of Virginia/West Virginia, maybe in Geo. Washington Nat'l Forest or 
near the Dolly Sods Wilderness Area. What's your pleasure? Once 
decided, we'll keep the list informed.

If your thinking about attending, please drop me a direct note at
tforhan_at_usa.pipeline_dot_com , and I'll keep a list.

90 Syncro Westie
