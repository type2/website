&gt; I purchased a 1776 from Strictly Foreign. One of the reasons was because of
&gt; they had a warranty. Had the engine less than a weak and it caught on fire, my
&gt; 69 camper is now gone. Sunday night it went up in flames.

I'm so sorry. Please accept my deepest condolences. :(

&gt; It wasn't until the deal was set and I was waiting for the
&gt; engine that I recieved a letter saying that the engine warranty was valid only
&gt; if I had a &quot;proffessional&quot; put it in, and they had to sign off, including the
&gt; 300 mile tune up and the 1000 mile tune up.

Well, I don't know how the law is out by you, but in most places, if a defective product causes 
damages, they are not only liable for the product itself, they are also liable for damages it 
causes. They may make you sign all sorts of stuff saying they aren't responsible, but that's 
mostly to scare you. They are. That's not the warranty, that's just regular product liability.

The problem I guess is that you need to do some forensic work to determine just what caught 
fire. Is there enough left (sorry) to give you some clues?

Best of luck, and once again, my condolences on your loss,

- Anton
