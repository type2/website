Subject: westy manuals and other stuff

	This may have been discused before, but I didn't see it in the 
FAQ--not that I know how to use it.  Where does one go about getting 
original style westy manuals?  One that describes the intricacies of 
usage and one on maintainance which includes wiring diagrams.  
The previous owner messed with the wiring on mine and while every thing 
works, there seems to be a short which slowly drains the battery.  I have 
narrowed it to the fridge, perhaps one of the relays but have been 
unwilling to pull it out.  Since I have been connected to 110v for the 
past year, my battery has been spared, but when I do need to drive and 
use the fridge, the charger goes into overdrive.
	
	RE Tyres:  Sorry about wasting space responding to old mail.        
Just realized that I was a month behind.   Interestingly, it corresponds to
the date school resumed.  Now I am buried under alot of books and lab junk.

	BTW, If the newbie Victor reads this, please tell me where all 
those speakers are.  I have four speakers in the usual spots but would 
like more bass and treble.  I have those woofer styles, 8 inch, 
uninstalled and some amps and things but I don't know where to put them 
without seriously compramising(sp?) the storage.  Ofcourse since I live 
in CA, I don't have a stereo, but some day......
