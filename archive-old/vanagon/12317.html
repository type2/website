&gt; Hi everybody. I'm curious to know if anybody's speedometer has broken on
&gt; their Vanagons. I have an '85 and the speedo and Odometer both broke last
&gt; month. I have no Idea how far or fast I'm going.
&gt; 
&gt; Previous to it breaking it was off by wuite a bit...70mph was actually 55,
&gt; 90mph was about 65-70.
&gt; 
&gt; How much would it cost to get it fixed?
&gt; Is it something that isn't that tough, or would it be better left to somebody
&gt; else?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for the info

We recently replaced the speedo/odo module on our 1981, and it was easy.  If the
problem is with the speedo cable, it may be more complicated - I'm not sure - 
but replacing the speedo/odo unit is pretty easy.  If it is just the gauge, not 
the cable, you should be able to fix it with a trip to a junkyard for a new 
module - a fair price out here in CA is about 50 bucks.  Remove the dash pod, 
take out a few screws, unscrew the old unit and slip the new one in.  15 minutes
work.
