Dear Helmut,
Thank you for your response to my questions about fender lips.  They
look white to me in the picture - it must be a NEGATIVE PHOTO!! .  If
my addition is correct, is the price now, with the $15.00 customs fee,
about US$228 ?  May I suggest that we all send $235 or $240 to cover
any unexpected fees or currency exchange moves.
Please tell me again where to send my check.
