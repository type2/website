Subject: Help locating a certain VW scrapyard in the US

     Hi US'ers,
     
     A while back someone posted a message saying that they had visited a  
     VW scrapyard. I remember them saying that it was more of a family 
     thing than a business though.
     
     The main point being that the scrapyard owner had about 25 Eberspacher 
     (or however it's spelt ) petrol heaters. And since the yard was in a 
     hot area there was no demand for them. He said that they were racked 
     up in some shed in the scrapyard all in perfect condition.
     
     Ring any bells ??
     
     Were you that person who posted this message ?
     
     I have a feeling it was someone in California.
     
     cia,
     
     Lee.
