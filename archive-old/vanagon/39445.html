Subject: Re: Oil temp

Yes.  The engine is designed to work best within a certain temp range. If
the engine is too cool then all the variously carefully clearenced engine
parts won't expand properly causing excessive wear-and more.  Any good oil
cooler (I would think) should have a pressure relief valve or something to
prevent the oil from flowing through it when the temp is too cool.

&gt;Is there such a thing as an engine running TOO cool?
If an engine is well-tuned and running fine,
&gt;would it make sense to add an oil-cooler as a precaution?  Or could you
&gt;bring the temp so low as to put the motor in a constant state of &quot;warming
&gt;up&quot; and never reach proper range.
