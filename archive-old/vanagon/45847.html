&gt;I just bought my first Westfalia, a 1984.  Would anybody have experience with
&gt;installing a 3rd seat belt for the rear bench?  Has anyone tried rigging
&gt;something up behind the front passenger seat?

there are two Tech Bulletins on this: one for the center seat (to install
shoulder belts for the driver's side passenger); and one for the outside
two passengers in the rear (third) seat. while they may NOT work for
Westies, if anyone wants these bulletins, let me know and i'll ship the
email file to you.
