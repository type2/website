&gt; And then Steve suggested:
&gt;  
&gt; &gt; The color and the name together, had to come from
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;      &quot;Purple Mountains' Majesty&quot;.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Doh!  You mean it's not from &quot;Her Majesty's a pretty nice girl but she 
&gt; doesn't have a lot to say ...&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; 
Might even more appropriate to go with the next line:

&quot;Her Majesty's a pretty nice girl but she changes from day to day.&quot;

Of course, that's if she's a fickle bus
