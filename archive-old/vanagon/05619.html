So martha rubin says:
&gt; 
&gt; Ok, I know it sounds crazy, but I got this flash of an idea tonight
&gt; on the way home from work.  Have been thinking about this issue
&gt; of how to &quot;heat&quot; the camper while camping, without having to
&gt; rely on electricity and/or propane.  What about some sort of
&gt; custome made, small woodstove that vents to the outside?  I've
&gt; seen something similar to this made out of mexican pottery,
&gt; sometimes used atop a kitchen counter and vented externally,
&gt; so why not in the van?  This would allow the use of wood,
&gt; perhaps even pellets, prestologs, whatever one could find.
&gt; 
&gt; Any ideas on if this would work, and if so, how to make it?
&gt;

Yeah, I've seen this done in a few westies (westy's?) and I
think it's fine as long as you have a good wood supply.  I've
seen little pot belly type stoves.  The one I remember was 
up behind the drivers seat in a 'brick' type camper and had
a stack that went out out where the window used to be.  

I think this would be useful if you were actually living in
the vehicle.  Kind of messy.  I wouldn't do it otherwise.
Seems like it would be a bit of a hassle to keep feeding the
stove though IMHO.

Might get soot on your flannel too!   ;)
