&gt;&gt;For what it is worth, I also thing the legacy engine would make a better
&gt;&gt;choice.  Correct me if I am wrong but did the 6 cylinder come only in the
&gt;&gt;SVX?  If so you will have to consider the avaliability and cost of the
&gt;&gt;engine and replacement parts.  Not to mention, the strain on the drive
&gt;&gt;train, you will also need a brake system upgrade to stop the
&gt;&gt;shoe box when you are doing 100+ with 7 people, while pulling the trailer
&gt;&gt;and the A/C blasting. Also subaru no longer produces the SUX?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;Subaru also produced the XT6 with a flat 6.  I believe the SVX replaced
this model.
