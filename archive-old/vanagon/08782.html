Steve,

Thanks for your comment.  I'll replace the screw, as you suggest.  I did 
raise the front end, but I'm coming to the conclusion I need a good full 
day off in good weather and go through this thing from start to finish 
while the parts stores are open.  I think I can get at it this weekend.
