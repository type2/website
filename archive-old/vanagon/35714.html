So dean c aukes says:
&gt; 
&gt; Now the questions.  This vehicle, Opie, had set for 3.5 yrs before I got it. 
&gt;  The pressure plate and area around it has red dust all over it - like rust. 
&gt;  Do pressure plates dry out, or is this likely from surface rust from the 
&gt; friction plates?  Can you lube pressure plates?  What, if anything, should I 
&gt; replace?  Pressure plate?  Throwout bearing? Clutch?  Entire cross shaft?  I 
&gt; have bent the cross shaft supports back vertical, but is it likely to happen 
&gt; again?  I still have trouble thinking of what could cause this.
&gt; 

Hi Dean,

If you have the money available, you should replace any questionable part
in there.  As it has been sitting, you don't really know the condition.
So if you replace the pressure plate, clutch &amp; T.O. bearing (definately)
you know what you've got and you don't have to mess with it again for
at least 30K miles unless you somehow botch the job.  You might check
the condition of the flywheel too.  How are the teeth?  Are they chipped
or worn?  That's a hefty expense, but sure beats not being able to turn
over the engine. ;)  

In a nutshell, fix it all now and you know where it stands.
