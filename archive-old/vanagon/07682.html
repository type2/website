&gt;&gt; On the way to night school last night, In the school driveway,
&gt;&gt; I smashed the van...
&gt;&gt; Arrrgh!
&gt;&gt; The worst part is, because it's the front of my van...
&gt;&gt; People (insurance people) will assume it's my fault.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I hate morons, I hate morons, I hate morons.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I'm not in the mood to have to deal with this shit right now.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I'll give details later.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;
&gt;Sorry to here of your mishap.  I hope it goes the other
&gt;way for you.
&gt;
&gt;BTW, Why is it when I have a comparitively minor problem, someone
&gt;else has a much worse one?  ;P

Its a _streak_!  I got rear-ended in my 911 on the way to work this 
morning!!!!!
