Subject: Info on Vanagon/Audi 5 cyl Bellhousings

Hi All,

I spoke with Weddle Engineering yesterday on the subject of Audi 5
cylinder bellhousings for Vanagons sold in South Africa.  According to
them, they are essential the same as the Diesel Bellhousings that can also
be used for VW gas motors.  There may be a slight variation, but they said
the diesel bellhousing will work for an Audi 5 cylinder transplant.  I
went ahead and ordered their last new South African Belhousing for a
future project.  8-)  More on this later.

Check out Helmut's website for great info on this type of swap into an 80
Vanagon camper.  email Helmut for the URL, sorry I don't have it handy...
