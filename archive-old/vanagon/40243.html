Subject: report on Monroe shocks for Syncro


Friday I picked up the bright yellow monroe magnum gas shocks (part # 34970 
front and #34971 rear, may have reversed the #'s), totally psyched as they 
were $36 ea.  But when I dropped the old Boge rear out and let the new 
monroe extend, it was not long enough.  Further it was not short enuf when 
fully compressed, nor was the dust cover designed to provide clearance near 
the upper bushing as the boges are.  Didn't try the fronts because of the 
additional work required to remove the old shock.

DOES ANYBODY KNOW THE EXTENDED/COMPRESSED LENGTHS OF THE FRONT SHOCKS FOR A 
SYNCRO?
I could check this against the specs for the monroe.  The front shocks for a 
syncro seem to be the hard ones to find and the monroes may match 
(hopefully).

sorry for the bad news
