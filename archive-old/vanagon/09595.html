Subject: East Coast?  SouthEast vs. NorthEast
Date: Tue, 10 Jan 1995 07:49:34 -0800 (PST)

I'm not opposed to doing it in Southern Ontario, I wonder if my bus might 
be, though.  I guess I haven't had it long enough to completely trust it 
yet.  I love Ontario and the exchange rate is pretty good right now (.74 
is it?).

However, if we don't want to split into NorthEast and SouthEast groups, a 
more central location might be in order.  Someplace that almost all of us 
could get to by driving a day.  West Virginia, Maryland, or Southeastern 
Ohio would be good from here and roughly 10--12 hours on the road, 
roughly the same from Massachusetts and less from Southern Ontario.

Let's be geographically practical now.--

And all the puppets in this digital jail / They're runnin' around in a frenzy
In search of the Holy Grail. /
They're havin' virtual sex. / They're eatin' virtual food.
No wonder these puppets are always in a lousy mood.
