Thanks for the reply, but I'm afraid not.  The entire handle, inside and
outside just &quot;wobbles around&quot; on it's shaft.  It isn't that the handles are
loose on the shaft, but rather that the shaft is loose in its &quot;bearing&quot;.

my symptom was a door that you had to bang hard on
the handle to get it to open, and finally it just wouldn't open at all
any more.
