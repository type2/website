Subject:      performance exaust for '90 question

 Volks,
     Can anyone tell me if a hp increasing exaust is available for the 2.1l
waterboxer?
I have a '90 Westy with chronic exaust problems and am looking to replace
(instead of repairing every month) the system.  Here in the foothills of the
Great Smokeys a bit more hp would come in handy....any ideas, even if not
exaust related, would be appreciated.  Thanks.
