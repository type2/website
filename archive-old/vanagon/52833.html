Subject: WTB: 86 &amp; Newer Vanagon Needing Work

Hi all,

I am looking for an 86 or newer Vanagon passenger van, preferably needing
work.  I'd love to have a Syncro.  The prospects should have a 4- or
5-speed. Leaky headgaskets or even a kaput or missing motor is okay.
Dents, paint condition are unimportant, but signs of rust are a negative.  
Wheels and tires do not matter.  The price should be reasonable.  I have 
both my 84's sold soon, and I would really like an 86 or newer Vanagon
and I have been stockpiling parts for such a purchase.  I wish that yard
near Springfield, MO would sell me their junkyard Syncro, but no go.  8-(

The search area is limited to the midwest/plains states, an 8 hour radius
of KC is within reason if it needs to be hauled.  If it is road worthy, I
may consider a further search in the continental US if the price is decent.
If any has or knows of anyone else; a shop, salvage yard, etc; that has or
may have such an animal, please let me know.  I know it's waiting for
me out there somewhere!  TIA,
