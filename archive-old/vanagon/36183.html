Subject: STOLEN BUS: VANCOUVER, B.C.

No, no, not MY bus, but a neighbour who lives in the same building as me.

Vancouver, PNW list-folks please keep an eye out for this bus!

Stolen in the early morning hours of Sunday, February 25.
Stolen from the West End, Vancouver.

Description of the bus:
Late 70s (78?) westfalia camper, deluxe version (with built-in stove, etc).
Avocado green, no front-mounted spare or mounting bracket.
Tinted rear windows, with &quot;Santa Cruz&quot; sticker on rear window.
He had repainted the front and one side with a brush (!), and the colour 
did not quite match.  There is an area of grey primer still showing by 
the passenger side engine compartment intake vent.
The thief had broken a driver's side window to get inside, so this damage 
may still be in evidence (unclear whether the vent window or the 
larger window was broken).
Originally a California car, so rust-free.

Anyone seeing this vehicle please contact the Vancouver Police Department 
at (604) 665-3535.

Sorry to start the week on a down note....  :-(
