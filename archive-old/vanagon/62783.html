Subject: pump H2O

Hi all

Nice idea on the recirc.  Go check an Audi Turbo for the little
standalone unit for same purpose.  May even work for a shower pump
Martha!  Found on drivers side of engine (in my '86) in plain sight
below/front of brake cyl.  Follow the wires and pickup the thermostat
while you're there. The heater lines can be T'd into since they are not
controlled by the main thermostat, Audi feeds in there, picks up via a
wierd upper rad hose molded in T.
