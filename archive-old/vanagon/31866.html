Subject: How MUCH tranny gear oil in '80 V6anagon?


Thank you all for your informative responses to my question about the
transmission in the '80 V6anagon-- I now know where the filler plug is!!!

Sounds like it's higher up than the plug on my '71 bus's tranny. In the
'71, you filled it with gear oil until it started to overflow from the hole,
and in this way you knew you had put in the right amount (if the bus was
sitting on level ground, of course).

How much do you fill the '80 Vanagon's 4-sp tranny? Keep putting it in
until it overflows the filler hole, as on the '71? Even though the filler
hole is higher (if that's what it is) than the '71's filler hole?

Thanks in advance,

Steve Maher   smaher_at_gi_dot_com   '80 V6anagon
