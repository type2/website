&gt;&gt; While in the process of installing an in-line blower in my 1972 Pop-Top, I
&gt;&gt; managed to break off the entire tube (the tube that runs from the junction of
&gt;&gt; the heat exchangers and the front of the van).  It was a litttle more rusty
&gt;&gt; than I expected.  Any thought on fixing this?  
&gt;
&gt;We put a piece of PVC pipe in my friend's '59. Works a treat - he never
&gt;realized he could have that much heat!

Is PVC acceptible for this application in terms of vapors it may give off
when heated?  It's really convenient to use, but I'd like to be sure of the
safety factor first.  In any event it might be safer than the original
rusted out pipe with asbestos fibers leaking in from the gaskets/insulation.
