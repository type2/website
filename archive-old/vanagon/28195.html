&gt;Hi, all you wanna-more-hp Vanagon Junkies.
&gt;
&gt;I know of a wrecked Volvo 740 Turbo Diesel
&gt;with the six cylinder VW engine so I called and
&gt;asked the dealer/junk yard to measure the engine

&gt;Does anybody else have any comments about fitting
&gt;a six VW/Volvo TD engine in a Vanagon ?
&gt;
        I don't know nuthin' bout puttin' that big ol' six in yer vannie,
but mah pa has a 740 Turbo Diesel, an' he done tol' me the durn thang runs
hot on #6, shortening it's life. I really don't know much about it, having
only spoken with him on the phone about it, but it sounds kinda like the
hot #3 we airheads (w/out doghouse) deal with. I suppose it's better than
the Wasserboxers I keep hearing about that need new head gaskets every 20k
mi. If you really want to know more about it, email me and I'll get him to
type it up real quick for you. BTW, I think he does have a lot of miles on
it, it just doesn't last as long as most diesels.

Peace,
