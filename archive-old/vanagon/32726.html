Subject: Jetta manul forsale

I realize that htis is the vanagon list but, I thought that there might 
be some other dyed in the wool VW owners out there that are in need of a 
85,86,87 GLI, Golf and Jetta manual. 

This manual is also in reasonable condition and I think $40/bst 
reasonable offer shipped gound is about right.

No I'm not getting rid of my VW's just the manuals for the cars I don't 
have any more.

95 Jetta GLS (wife's)
