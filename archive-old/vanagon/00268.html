&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Does anyone have any technical info sources about the AWD system the 
&gt; &gt; Syncro uses?  I recently bought a syncro, and am curious about the
&gt; &gt; 4wd system.  And I can't read German, so sources in English would be 
&gt; &gt; most helpful!
&gt; 
&gt; Hi Jim, Welcome! You came to the right place. Hang around here for a 
&gt; while and you'll get an education on SYNCROS.
&gt; Fill us in on your new toy. What year is it and what type (7 pass or 
&gt; westi...pickup... 16&quot; wheels?)  
&gt; 

My new van:  '87 Syncro GL 
	     the good:
             :-) Titian Red (_really_ looks like a brick!)
             :-) has the weekender bed
             :-) Runs great!
             :-) passes inspection/emissions!
	     :-) came with 3 gal of VW coolant!
	     the bad:
	     :-( no diff lock
             :-( has 106K miles
	     :-( stock 14&quot; rims with stock Michelin MXL 
	     the ugly:
             :-( has low compression (125 across the board)
             :-( has a noisy tranny
             but...
	     I love it!

My van came with all the records, and I can't imagine myself bringing
a car to the dealer.  Each receipt was for at $300, and a lot of them
were for no-brainer items (brake pads, new coolant, oil change, sliding
door lock).

I must admit though, maybe never having owned a new car has spoiled me.
My wife's new Mazda 323 (no flames, I would have bought a golf, but there
weren't any new ones on the lot at the time!) needs the 30K service.  I asked
the guy what they do, and he said &quot;Everything&quot;.  &quot;Everything&quot; includes plugs,
oil and coolant change, timing, new belts, repack rear bearings, for the low 
low price of only $410!  Another dealer wants $490!  

Are these normal rates nowadays for a simple tune-up? (rhetorical question)

-Jim
