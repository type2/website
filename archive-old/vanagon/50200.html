&gt;Hey Guys,
&gt;
&gt;I just changed  my coolant after checking out the archives first.  One
&gt;thing that was mentioned  was that the radiator bleeder valve looks 
&gt;like
&gt;a brake bleeder.  My bleeder is nothing more than an 8mm bolt (maybe
&gt;tapered).  Is this right? 

*That is correct

&gt;is no big thing, taking the CV off of the axle to change the boot seems
&gt;a little bit harder.  I don't have a press, will I be able to get the CV
&gt;back on the shaft without one?

After removing the circlip I have had them come apart without to much
fuss. DO NOT ATTEMPT TO HAMMER ON THE SPLINED END OF THE AXLE
SHAFT!!!!!!!!!!! It will mushroom out and you will really have a hard
time getting it off. While your there I would go ahead and repack the
CVs and check for wear. DO NOT mix parts between CV parts.

&gt;Fuel filter thing - I need the one that's about the diameter of
a coffee mug

If yours is metal I believe the filter is a permanent one i.e. does not
need to be replaced on a routine basis.
Good luck
