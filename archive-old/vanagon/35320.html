 F.Y.I. - Owners Manuals etc.

I thought of those of you doing restorations when I saw a brief article about
a fellow/outfit in Framingham Mass. whose specialty is the collection of
&quot;service manuals, wiring diagrams, parts books, even showroom literature&quot;. 
Apparently he then sells this (or copies???)  to interested parties.  The
article was identified this as a source of material and info for those who are
restoring vehicles to original condition.  It states that this person and his
6 employees have &quot;over 6,000 square feet of warehouse filled with carefully
stored paint chip charts, service manuals, photographs, owner's manuals etc. 
Each person has an intimate knowledge of the material.  That familiarity is
enhanced by a computerized inventory update of new acquisitions to help with
the vagaries of memory.  Questions are handled promptly on the telephone and
books can be shipped nationwide via United Parcel Service or Federal Express. 
The outfit is headed by Bob Johnson, and is called Bob Johnson Automobile
Literature, at 21 Blandin Ave. in Framingham , Mass, 01701, phone (508)
872-9173 [answered during EST business hours].  No indication of what any of
this will cost you.

Standard disclaimer - I have no association with this outfit, etc etc.

Harvey
