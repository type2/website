Subject: Re: Golf/Jetta engine in gas Vanagon

List,

  The shop I work for,(Volks Cafe) have done a number of these 
conversions.  As long as you have a Diesel to get parts from, it's 
&quot;Fairly&quot; striaght forward.

  One of the biggest problems we run into is that the Fuel Ijector lines 
need to be lengthened. Other than that, a little fabricating of the 
intake to the manifold and you have a very nice running Vanagon.

  We've played with a few different exaust systems too, and found that 
the stock Diesel works the best!  Every other kind we've tried has 
broken quickly.

  I get to drive these Conversions, and I've driven Vanagons with V-6 
Power plants too, I Really like the &quot;Feel&quot; of the In-Line 4 Cylinder 
engine in a Vanagon!

  We also have a customer that has a 5.0 Ford engine in his Vanagon, 
Quite a scary feeling to drive that one!

  Anyone that wants more info on these e-mail me and I'll do my best to 
answer any questions you might have.

  Kyle
