&gt;ok. so the left coast is getting tooooo many. if all you dudes and dudettes
&gt;from the shake-and-bake state will tell me your relative location within
&gt;california (north or south), i'll make the changes. but you are gonna have
&gt;to tell me ... cause i don't know where all those suburbs are and i don't
&gt;have a map here at work. :)  i know where san fran and san diego and l.a.
&gt;are, but i have no idea where many of the others are.

OK, Put me down for Northern California.
