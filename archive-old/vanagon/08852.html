&gt;start by putting an oil pump in it when they noticed the Fram filter.

now folks, this is what disturbs me greatly about the dealer service folks:
THEY were gonna replace the oil pump, before checking stuff like the filter
... do they not have any experienced people?? :(  &lt;see below&gt;

&gt; They changed to a Volkswagen one and immediately gained 5 psi at hot
&gt;idle and 10 psi at highway rpm.  Now this could be due to just an old
&gt;vs new filter or is this a typical experience with Frams?  My oil
&gt;light flickers at idle and I will be changing to a VW filter to try
&gt;this out!

well, me personally, i tend to follow the observations and experience of
a porsche mech in b'ham: he tried Fram filters on porsche 911s and 914s
and decided that they couldn't handle the volume/flow ... that they actually
screwed things up. so he won't use them in his shop. Mann filters are supposed
to be identical to the VW filters, and if you buy VW filters from the dealer,
look on the box, and you'll see that they are made in the u.s. (well, from
the u.s. dealers, anyway) ... in Michigan ... which is where Mann makes their
filters. the Mann filters i got from the FLAPS had identical coloration and
markings and wording. only the cardboard box was different.

now ... having said that, Fram seems to do fine on american water-cooled cars
... but that porsche mech won't use them. he prefers Puralator (which i had
never heard of till i went to his shop). but then he's a bit peculiar about
stuff like that. uses only Kendall motor oils and Champion plugs ... he hates
Bosch spark plugs. but then, he sees a lot more plugs and oil and filters
every day than i do. except that his interests are in getting the things in
and out quickly, whereas i can be a bit slower without losing money. i've
never had any problems with Bosch plugs or Castrol oil, but i've never tried
the Fram filters myself (always replacing them if i buy a car with one on it).
