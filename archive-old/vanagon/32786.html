&gt;&gt;Is there any way I can sort out who e mails me direct, and which e mails come
&gt;&gt;via the Vanagon list?
&gt;&gt;I think I have replied to people via Vanagon when they may have e mailed
&gt;&gt;direct! (90% of our email is VW related, my lady wonders if she is the only
&gt;&gt;VW  widow, I think not!!) Cheers! Dave.

I am presently communicating with the keeper of the list, Gerry Skerbitz and
will post results of his efforts on this subject.
