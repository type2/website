&gt; Well, I glad to get that off my chest!  Any words of encouragment
&gt; or sympathy appreciated.

Sorry to hear about your loss, Dave.

Noticed that you've moved to Flagstaff.  I was wondering if you could look up
some friends of mine.  They're real easy to find, you may even have a need for
their services, being new to town.  Just get on South San Francisco Street 
and look on the right side of the strett for The Cosmic Cyclery.  There's a guy
in there (the owner, actually) name of Elson Miles.  Would you tell him I said HI!
when you get a chance?  I would greatly appreciate it.

Thanks,

Jack
