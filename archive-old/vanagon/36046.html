Subject: Re: The Tehachapi Run/milage

In a message dated 96-02-24 01:49:40 EST, you write:

&lt;&lt; ps, it has already rained 17inches this year here in Oly, WA.  but not all
at once!     Sounds like a looney trip!

 &gt;&gt;

Clara,

Yes, it WAS a rather looney trip, which is why I felt it justified the
telling.  And the account was factual.  But not everyone thought the same.
 Several people thought I would benefit from their expressions of disbelief,
one saying the thing was all bullshit since THEY had not experienced any
heavy rain that day. .

It wasn't until after  writing the account of the Tehachapi Run that I
learned the Mt. Wilson observatory recorded thirteen inches of rainfall on
Tuesday, the day of the run.  Our annual average here at the shop is fifteen
inches.

Another person opined that since ALL of my trips were disasters of one sort
or another, I should keep them to myself and not waste the bandwidth with
obviously trumped-up accounts.  Another cast doubt on the veracity of my
mileage figures.

Looking back, I can see that 'The Road Trip From Hell',  getting Grendel home
and the 'Tehachapi Run' could give the impression that my travels are plagued
with difficulties.  They are not.  And those accounts were equally true,
including the mileage figures.  Indeed, most of my trips are entirely without
incident, either personal, mechanical or meteorological.  I make a 900 mile
trip of familial obligation several times a year and somehow manage not waste
any bandwidth writing about them.  Ditto for 99% of my travels.

However, should the general feeling be that such trip reports as I've
submitted in the past are of no interest, I'll abide by the wishes of
electronic community of which I'm privileged to be a part and pull the plug
on the word processor.
