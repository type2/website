Subject: Kelley Park potluck, 4/9

Hiya, gang-BUS-ters!

I'd like to propose that we all gather at approximately 4:30pm AFTER
everyone's had a chance to check out the Vintage VW show/swap, and unwind
by viewing the Red Rocks videos and stills over good company and supper.
(or some variation thereof)

Will that work for the rest of you planning to attend?  Since the part of
Kelley Park I know best is Happy Hollow, I'd like for someone else to
suggest a convenient location for us to gather (Jon, can you make a 
suggestion or two?).

Watch out Steven J., there's gonna be an EV at one of these gatherings yet!
