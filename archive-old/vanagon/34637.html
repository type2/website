Subject: Re: Repost - 1980 Vanagon seats

&gt;The &quot;normal&quot; position for this seat is against the left wall of the van.
&gt; Since the Westy stuff is already there, you would be mounting it toward the
&gt;right side of the van.  I doubt the holes would line up, but drilling a few
&gt;new ones would be easy.  On my van, all the seat belts mount to the seat

Grin, just turn the rails around..... :0)  Tim
