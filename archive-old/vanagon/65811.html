&gt;Questions, anyone, would my 86 westy operate ok without the cat
&gt;converter?  No emmissons test here. The exhust tips would come closer to
&gt;the center for me if that were the case. Would the tips clear the tow
&gt;hook bumper hitch?

I thought that the Fuel Injection system uses the O2 sensor attached to the
CAT to make mixture adjustments. Removing the cat may be a problem?

Probably the best solution would be to simply knock the insides out of the
cat and keep it in the system. (See the John Muir manual for the rabbit
under &quot;gutting the cat&quot;) Be careful as there may be dangerous (i.e.
carsenergenous) stuff in cat guts. If you took the cat out you would have
to make a custom bracket to support the muffler.
