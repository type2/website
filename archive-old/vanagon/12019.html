Subject: Carry Warning Triangles 

Possibly the most valuable bit o' kit that you can have in your 
VW - introducing the warning triangle.

It was mentioned yesterday in the thread about Ric's bug and it 
reminded me of the incident I had a couple of years ago.

I was driving my black Jetta in my usual boisterous manner on a 
road that I travel almost every day.  It's a twisty, lumpy 
tarmac road that can be great fun, if the conditions are right.

On this particular evening, I was about two miles from home, 
approaching a blind bend.  I suppose I was doing my usual 60 
mph. at that point.  Half way around the corner, in the middle 
of the road, was a Chrysler Sunbeam.  Stopped.  With people 
behind it with shocked expressions.  Right in front of me.  Oh, 
shit.

On this one occasion I didn't hit anything.  The front fork of 
their car had collapsed and dug itself into the road surface.  
Although there were five people in the vehicle, no-one had 
thought to warn traffic coming around the corner.  One lady, 
who happened to be standing at the rear of the car when I came 
barrelling towards them said that her life flashed before her 
eyes!

I was angry.  Really angry.  I could have killed these people 
and they didn't even have the smarts to know that anyone 
approaching that corner could not see them until it was too 
late.  Secondly, if a car had been coming on the other side of 
the road, I would have hit it head-on as I swerved to avoid the 
Chrysler.

As they didn't have a triangle, and there are no laws in 
Ireland to force you to carry one, I gave them mine.  I had to 
explain what it was for AND tell them where to stand to flag 
down approaching traffic!

It was a good thing that I had given them the triangle.  When 
they returned it they told me this: about ten minutes after I 
left, another metal missile bore down on their car.  The driver 
had not seen the lady trying to slow him, but screeched to a 
stop when he saw the triangle.  Whereas I missed 'em by feet, 
he missed 'em by inches ...

I feel VERY strongly that triangles should be carried and USED, 
too.

I'll get off my soapbox now.
