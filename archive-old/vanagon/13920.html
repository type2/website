&gt;     &gt;&gt;      Ok Kombi lovers,
&gt;     &gt;&gt;      the way I understand it is this, &gt;
&gt;     &gt;&gt;      Model         Features
&gt;     &gt;&gt;
&gt;     &gt;[snip]
&gt;     &gt;&gt;
&gt;     &gt;&gt;      Deluxe Micro  Microbus with deluxe extras, (extra side window, 
&gt;     &gt;&gt;                    clock etc.) and options of skylight, corner      
&gt;     &gt;                     windows and sunroof.
&gt;     &gt;
&gt;     &gt;I think the corner windows were not an option on the DeLuxe -- that 
&gt;     &gt;is, you were &quot;stuck&quot; with 'em (sigh).  You could delete the sunroof 
&gt;     &gt;and portholes/skylights, but not the corners.
&gt;     &gt;

&gt;     What was I writing??  Yes, of course the Deluxe always had corner 
&gt;     windows.
&gt;     
&gt;     Lee.

You are both right.  Joel's post explaining the different models says that
in 1964 the Deluxe no logner has corner windows.  And my '64 which is a
Deluxe (the kelly blue book says 'Deluxe Wagon' if I go by VIN number) does
not have corner window (or sunroof or portholes - sigh).
