Edie Hintz list of &quot;dead&quot; musicians in his band kind of reminds
me of my fantasy album (or CD)...

Dead Artists Live....featuring Janis, Jimi, Elvis, Morrison, etc...

or howabout the latest retrospective from Lynird Skinnird (sp?)...
&quot;Some of us are dead...&quot;


getting off of the T&amp;A bus...
