Subject: Re: WTB Seat belt parts


I wrote--
&gt;&gt;&gt; I am in need of the seat belt latch mechanism and the plate that mounts 
&gt;&gt;&gt;  to the seat base, if you have a set (2) please drop me a line.

And then Bradley wrote
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;It would really help if you said what year you would like them to be 
&gt;&gt;for.  I think are at least 4 different types of seatbelt latches that 
&gt;&gt;I've seen.  And I happen to have a couple from an '81 vanagon.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;And while I have everyone's ear, it would be nice if people had thier 
&gt;&gt;vehicle, and location in thier .sig.  It reduces the guessing.  If 
&gt;&gt;someone needs help, I'm much more likely to offer my help (as in beyond 
&gt;&gt;Email help) if they're in the bayarea.

Sorry, you are correct. I need the latches and  plate for the front 
 buckets on a 78.

I wish I could comply with the signature area but I am getting this 
 E-mail address on the good graces of my employer and actually use it 
 to correspond with anal retentive marketing types who would have a 
 tizzy if there was anything remotely un-corporate involved. Oh and 
 also I can't figure out how to make Microsoft (gag-spit) mail use a 
 constant signature string.
