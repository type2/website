&gt; 
&gt; Problem:
&gt; 
&gt; I have been having problems with the starter system on my '78. It fails 
&gt; to run the motor, but if I short the solenoid, the motor will work for a 
&gt; while, but any long high speed runs will cause the system to return to 
&gt; non-functioning status.  Fortunately, I live in an area with plenty of 
&gt; hills.  
&gt; 
&gt;  I think I must have missed the original description of this problem, but,
 at the risk of sounding stupid or repeating advice that you have already
 received...... When I had my '72, it developed a problem where it would 
 generally start cold but, after a long drive, it wouldn't turn over. The  
 similarity here extends to your mention of shorting the solenoid: that would
 start the car under any conditions. I started looking for a voltage drop
 somewhere in the system and tracked it...... all the way back to the starter.
 The crimp connection on the wire from the switch, at that very last terminal
 where it connects to the solenoid was the culprit. And, if you think about,
 it's no surprise - it's out in the weather, there's vibration, etc.. The fix
 was free. With the assistance of some acid flux to clean things up, I just
 soldered that wire and terminal together to &quot;reinforce&quot; the crimp. No more
 problems!
