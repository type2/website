Hello All-

I am new to the list and new to VW Vanagon's.  I want to purchase a used
Vanagon in the next six months.  I prefer a passenger van, but am tempted by
the camper vans.  What do I need to know/look for?  I notice that many
Vanagon's that are over 8 years old have rebuilt engines.  Is this normal?
 What kind of mileage should I expect from a vanagon?  Any body out there
have a Eurovan?  Should I choose that over the Vanagon?  Help.

PS:  What do all the different types mean (i.e. GL, Westfalia, Synchro, etc.)
