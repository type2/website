Subject: Re: Gas heaters in Splitties

&gt; How is the duct-work for the gas heater hooked up in a splittie?  Does it
&gt; hook up to the main heater tube (and crack windshields:-}  This sounds 
&gt; particulary good given that a wall behind the cockpit is a frequent 
&gt; temporary cold-weather addition.

The stock  gas heater is mounted in the left side of the engine compartment 
w/the ductwork routed along the side of the gas tank then exiting under 
the rear seat.  I added a length of dryer hose to pipe the hot air to the 
cockpit--not pretty but functional.
