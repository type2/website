Subject: Thermostat housing on 87 Waterboxer
Date: Thu, 18 Jan 1996 22:32:10 -0600

I recently replaced the thermostat in my Vanagon (87 Waterboxer), the
Bentley manual (Back cover under &quot;Coolant system, section 19) says I should
tighten the bolts on the housing to 61 pound/feet, is this correct?  It
seems excessive when the housing is plastic, does anybody know if 61
pound/feet is correct, or what it should be tightend to?
