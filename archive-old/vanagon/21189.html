Subject: Re: PVC pipe awning trick

Ted M.

Negative! The pipe slips on and off. Very temporary usage. I dont have time
for extensive ascii art so please imagine the the PVC pipe that has been cut
on atable saw as the letter C that is almost closed except for the width of
the blade. Have someone help you position the tarp so that it drapes on to
the top of the bus roof. For kicks lets say that the tarp lays on the roof
two feet beyond the rain gutter. The rest of the tarp will hang down toward
the ground. Then lay the pipe on top of the tarp which is on top of the
gutter. Place the cut out edge of the pipe so that it will slip onto the
gutter. With a little wiggling the pipe will retain the tarp onto the
gutter. Then figure out a method of supporting the remaining amount of the
tarp to create the roof effect. I used one of those ugly blue cheapy tarps
with the grommets in the corners. The pipe does not come in contqct with the
grommets.

Home sliding window thingies would work too!
BTW: was your dad a HS football coach in Phoenix?


  &gt;Rusty,
&gt;Could you spell out for me how exactly to make this as I am having 
&gt;trouble visualizing it.  This would make my frequent baja trips all the 
&gt;more comfortable.  I have used a tarp with grommets attached to 
&gt;home-sliding-window clamps that fit nicely on the rain gutter.  But your 
&gt;idea sounds like the pipe is permanent.
&gt;Thanks,
