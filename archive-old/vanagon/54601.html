Subject: Brake Drum Removal

First things first.  This is the best list.  I got more response about my 
posting than any other list that I belong to (Porsche 356, Mercedes).  
Thanks to all that responded.

Greatest thanks go to Tim Smith.  He suggested that I could pull the drums 
without removing the castle  nut (46mm).  He suggested that rust 
accumulates between the drum and the hub thereby &quot;welding&quot; them together.  
I used Tim's method of hitting the outer edge of the drum until the drum 
broke free.  I didn't have to hit it very hard, and it just popped off.   
As far as clearance is concerned,  it was not really any more difficult to 
do with the hub on.  All parts are readily accessible, and I even learned 
an easy trick to get the retaining springs back on.  Just attach one end to 
the shoe,  hold the shoe about an 1&quot; below the brake cylinder, and twist it 
slightly towards you and towards the hub.  You can easily clip the spring 
to it's mount and just pull the shoe to its appropriate place.  Total 
installation time, including, removal, installation, parking brake 
adjustment and cleanup took a little over two hours.

Thanks again for all your help!
