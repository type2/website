&gt; I just picked up an external temperature sender from bugpack.  you know, 
&gt; one of those nine dollar jobs that attach to the #3 cyl. tin shroud 
&gt; screw.  Is it o.k. to attach the sender on top of the tin, or is it 
&gt; necessary to remove the tin and attach the sender directly on the head?

If it's anything like my sender (mine is the VDO kit) you will want to have
it mounted directly on the head to avoid a false (lower) reading.  If you
really don't want to do that, you can mount it on top of the tin at the head
and just remember that the indicated temperature is probably lower than the
actual temperature.  It will still be useful to see when you are running
hotter than normal.  Nah, mount it directly on the head!
