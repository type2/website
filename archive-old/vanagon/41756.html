sounds interesting, seeing as how i really cant afford a new set..umm, i 
may be rong though, but, on the quick glance i had at the tires on it, 
they looked like 15's though..but, if they ARE 14's, i'll definitly keep 
you in mind..

thnaks..

&gt; If you go for it, I have some tires I took off the DOA Syncro when I
&gt; parted it out. They may interest you. They are a  set of four Arizona 
&gt; M+S, 205/14 radials, with 10/32 tread -thats like zero wear. They are
&gt; passenger car rated, so they really should not have been on the Syncro
&gt; because they weigh so much, but I think they would be fine for you. They 
&gt; are an off-brand, but in great condition. I have a spare also, an
&gt; Michelin (I can't remember the model, but M+S again, same size, with
&gt; 9/32 tread. A great spare. I'm asking $25/tire, plus shipping, which
&gt; would be something like $5/each. 
&gt; 
&gt; What do you think?
