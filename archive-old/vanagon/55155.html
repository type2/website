Subject:       RE: Schematic Programmable Delay Circuit


&gt; Folks, we've been there, done that. Check the archives at:
&gt; http://www.med.umn_dot_edu:8853/cgi-bin/msg?m=msg02539&amp;a=/v96/vanagon.96.01
&gt; 
&gt; It explains the idea and gives the part number for a replacement wiper
&gt; relay from VW that will give your Vanagon programable delay wipers. $35
&gt; bucks or so, unless you dig one out the local junkyard. The you just
&gt; replace the current relay with the new one.  Many other VW/Audi products
&gt; have this feature: you can too!
&gt; 
Just called the dealer (Speedway in Victoria). Part # is apparently 
now: 1HM 955 531C, and is $ 47.72 CDN.

Local FLVWAPS (BowWow) told me the &quot;1HM&quot; indicates a dealer only 
part. ie: they have a relay ending in &quot;955 531&quot;, but it's a standard 
wiper relay. Has anyone located an alternate source for this (other 
than used)?
