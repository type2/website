&gt;
&gt;&gt;On the highway segments I moved along easily at 55 to 65 and the
temperature
&gt;&gt;found it's way up to 240 to 250*. It was interesting to hit a low spot over
&gt;a
&gt;&gt;creek or other cool area and see the temp swing 10* momentarily. It was
&gt;about
&gt;&gt;85 to 90* outside. How do these things survive in Az etc?
&gt;
&gt;hmmm. shouldn't be quite that high. you might want to start thinking about
&gt;adding an external oil cooler. just for paranoia's sake.
&gt;
&gt;

Yeah, I believe that's where I am. The JCW kit is about $100 and looks easy
enough to do. Along with wear problems, the high temp forces me to keep the
idle way too high to keep the pressure up which is annoying and probably
leads to other problems as well.

Thanks,

Weston
