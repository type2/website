Subject: 02 sensor

Some folks expressed an interest in the 02 sensor thingy.  I'll try to
oblige here.


&gt;&gt;I'm using the O2 sensor on anything I run I decided.  Might as well know
&gt;&gt;whats going on in that exhaust since I went out and paid the big money.
&gt;&gt;Kind of wish I had built the meter myself, but I didn't know how at the time.
&gt;
&gt;        Uhh, how? I thought about this and didn't really know how, but I
&gt;could use one of those goodies.

I thought I had the old posts for this hanging around, but now I can't find
them.  Maybe they're on the computer at work.  Basically you hook up a
generic 02 sensor in the exhaust path, usually one that has a heating
element in it and needs 12VDC.  Then you measure DC volts with a voltmeter
up front.  My expensive Haltech meter has 16 led's, but all it is is a box
with leds that measure DC volts.


This from another guy.............

&gt;I got a little side pipe with M18 threads welded to one of the two J 
&gt;pipes, bought a normal Bosch oxygen sensor ($36.00) and ran one wire from 
&gt;it to the dashboard where I installed some cheapo digital voltmeter from 
&gt;Radio Shack. I found in a Bosch FI book a calibration curve (voltage vs. 
&gt;lambda) fora Bosch Oxygen sensor. SO I know at what voltage reading I'm 
&gt;running at lamda = 1. Higher Voltages mean rich, lower ones lean.
&gt;I used this information to tune my FI system, like setting CO screw on 
&gt;the AFM.....
&gt;It works great so far, but I'm wondering how I coud convert the voltage 
&gt;reading into a direct lambda reading. Did you buy a gauge which can do that?

(I brazed the nut on at the collector merge)

And from another guy..............

&gt;Just a word of wisdom to those of you playing around with your O2
&gt;sensor meters... be sure to install them (the O2 sensor) BEFORE the
&gt;catalytic converter (if so equipped).  Otherwise, all you are
&gt;reading is diddly-squat in terms of meaningful data.
&gt;
&gt;2 great books on O2 sensors/fuel injection are (info posted earlier 
&gt;but what the heck):
&gt;
&gt;Fuel Injection and Engine Management by Charles Probst
&gt;
&gt;How To Tune and Modify Bosch Fuel Injection by Ben Watson

If I find any more past posts, I'll get back to you, I'm sure someone had
the voltmeter readings and their conversions somewhere.  Maybe I'll have to
get the book.
