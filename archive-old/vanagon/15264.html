Subject: Re: 1972 Bus for cheap - Ethics??

&gt;As people on the list may be aware, or not, I am moving to San Francisco in
&gt;June/July.  I am bringing my 73 Westy with me from Canada and I have been
&gt;warned that it may not be cheap or easy to get it liscenced in CA.  Now, if
&gt;one possessed less than lily white standards, what is to stop one from
&gt;swapping the VINS from a  CA beater bus like the one below to one's 73?

Need a nicely matched set of numbers, ie. engine, trans, front and rear VIN, 
or a good excuse as to why things ain't so. On the ethics point of view, the 
balance of VW dom in CA is being preserved, nothing added or subtracted, 
ahem ahem, but you are defrauding USCustoms of duty and CA air quality act 
of some funds. On the other hand you are adding to both by generating 
revenue which you will be taxed on, and buying gas, so it might not be 
sooooo bad.
         Apparently older Porsches are often borne again, due to restoration 
requirements, ie. a newer tub with transplanted mehanicals. which came 
first, the chassis or the running gear? Since I have a CA vehicle up here, 
an amazingly lightly rusted 1966 Porsche, I would really look into ditching 
your CDN Westy in favor of a CA one, then bring it in duty free as 'settlers 
effects'. How strong is your sentiment for it?  tim s.

PS: have VIN #s for 72 Westy + CDN reg, would you please bring me one back? 
Mint shape only. Nudge. Nudge.
