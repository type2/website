Subject: Has This Happened to You

I've recently had what I'll call an &quot;emotional, significant event&quot; and
wondered how common does this occur.

While doing a Higway trip in MY THING I was overtaken by several big
trucks (wouldn't have happened if I was in the Eurovan) and I was
physically moved by the wind of the passing trucks from the driving lane
and onto the shoulder.

While trying to slow down, I ran upon a pile of rocks that had broken
and fell from the ledge adjacent to the road.

The situation immediately went down hill. I had to stop since I could
tell that the vehicle was not moving smoothly or like it had been.

Upon stopping and doing the 'inspection thing', I discovered BOTH
passenger-side tires were flat.

After two-hours of &quot;interaction&quot; with an unusually intelligent highway
patrol-type, several peope at AAA Emergency road service and a tow-truck
driver, it was determined that the rocks had ripped the sides od the
tires (ala beyond repair). The vehicle was transported to my home.

Later, I purchased two tires at a &quot;reliable&quot; Goodyear dealer. It was not
until AFTER the tires had been mounted on rims that the dealer-person
told me they did not have the equipment to balance the tires.

I'm now searching the are for some firm/entity with the equipment get
the tires balanced.

regards,
