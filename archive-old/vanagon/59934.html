Subject: Syncro for the Last Frontier

      I'm headed for Alaska soon and I want a Syncro to take me there.  I've
been road tripping around in a '73 Datsun 510 with no heat for the last 5
years.  Spent way too many nights in the front seat .  I think it changed my
posture.  Spent way too much time digging out on almost level ground.  I love
the old Datsun 510 (thier quite neat cars too) but the syncro is my ideal
machine.  Right now I'm in CA but would travel far for the right rig.  Would
love a We$tie but their out of my reach.  Any help finding one would be
greatly appreciated.

                                             Thanks Much,
                                                     Peter Schaefer
