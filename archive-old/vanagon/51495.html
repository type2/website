Subject: Change '87 Vanagon ATF to Change ALL ATF (Questions)

Volks,
Sorry in advance for so many posts w/wasserboxer question, but I intend 
to change the ATF in &quot;Das Boot&quot; today and will not have a manual for a 
few weeks.
Can any one instruct me on the procedure for draining the torque 
converter after the ATF sump has been drained on my '87 GL. On US/Jap 
vehicles I drained the pan (if equipped w/plug) and then added some ATF 
to the filler, removed the ATF cooler line (pressure side) to the 
radiator, started the engine and let the torque converter pump say 
5-quarts into a container. I would of course stop the engine and top the 
ATF filler frequently to ensure the torque converter never starves.
In this way I replaced 100% of my old ATF w/new. This wasserboxer 
autoboxer is a new animal to me: no ATF cooler lines to remove and pump 
the ATF trapped in the torque converter.
Anybody got any ideas, I just bought this creampuff and want to put in 
the synthetic ATF I have used for years and don't want to mix it heavily 
with old/contaminated ATF remaining in the torque converter. Any and all 
input appreciated.
Thanks Volks
Regards
Mark B. Magee
