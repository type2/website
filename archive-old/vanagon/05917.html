Well, for what it is worth,
I for one am quite thankful that Canadians are so close to Montana.  When
my vanagon broke down last week, it was some very nice Canadian young
people who drove 50 miles to bring my wife and I back home.  It is a bit
hard to imagine that Americans would have been so nice.
Thanks, Canada!
Stuart Hutton
