&gt;&gt; I suppose this subject comes up all the time in this group, but here it is
&gt;&gt; again! I want a Westy tent!!!!! Needs to fit a 78 Westy. If anyone is
&gt;&gt; the owner of one of these and wants to sell it, PLEASE e-mail me.
&gt;
&gt;Me too!!!  After getting rained on constantly in Pfeiffer, it suddenly
&gt;became more important to me.

That would be a cool addition to a surf-mobile.  How much modification to 
the body is necessary to put one on?  

Ever seen the full blown circus tent version?  They're wild!
