Subject: RE: Octane ratings

I thought Octane (if as in methane, propane, etc...) refers to the number 
of carbons in the molecule *(Oct- = 8)*  The -ane suffix refers to the 
type of bonding between adjacent carbons (single bond) Par l'example octene
would mean at least one double bond (-ene suffix).  I was wondering what
the rating of gas in terms of octane (i.e. 87, 89 etc) refers to.  Is this 
related to some percent (or proof) of octane in the gas?
