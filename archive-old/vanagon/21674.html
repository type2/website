well, it's suggestive, lurid, and no stranger to vice ... so be warned!! ;)

Can She Dance the Polka?
(dirty filthy-minded old sea chanty, sung by VW mechanics during their
work, but one that teaches a moral lesson)


As I drove down, along the coast, another bus I spied,
A'sitting lone beside the road, and looking like it died.

I stopped to see if I could help, and maybe lend a hand,
That bus was full of pretty girls! I never felt so grand!

     So me old Volkswagen
     Ain't for dragging,
     Sure, she runs quite well,
     But can she dance the polka?

They asked if I could fix their bus, they'd pay me with a treat!
And quickly I was 'neath that bus, a'working in the heat.

A simple fix, a cable loose, I fixed it right enough,
Then they said to follow them, they lived just down the bluff.

     So me old Volkswagen
     Ain't for dragging,
     Sure, she runs quite well,
     But can she dance the polka?

I followed on for just a mile, and pulled down to the strand,
Where they were camped upon the beach, their tents pitched on the sand.

They gave me wine, it tasted fine, but it went right to my head.
Then they threw their clothes away, and they carried me to bed.

     So me old Volkswagen
     Ain't for dragging,
     Sure, she runs quite well,
     But can she dance the polka?

When I awoke next morning, all naked in the dawn,
My watch, and my wallet, and my lady friends was gone.

Now, I don't miss the money as some other fellows might,
But I wish I could remember if I had some fun that night!!

     So me old Volkswagen
     Ain't for dragging,
     Sure, she runs quite well,
     But can she dance the polka?
