This sounds good - where do I find info to contact 'Wolfsburg West', 'Rocky
Mountain Ripoff Works' etc?

Thankx-

&gt; &lt;&lt; 	Next Question: How about easy-fit mudflaps? The VW dealer ones are
&gt;  expensive. Heard of any other ones? Maybe something from a different
&gt;   car that work? I'd like not to have to drill a lot of holes. &gt;&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Wolfsburg west , Rocky Mountain Ripoff Works and others carry the repro VW
&gt; logo mudflaps for the bus.  You can put there on a Vanagon too.  Troy
&gt; Heintzenrater (sp?) of G.A.S.S has a set on his V-gon westy. 
&gt; 
&gt; cheap, about 25-35 bucks a pair.
