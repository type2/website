&gt;
&gt;To convert to having a majority of electric vehicles is going
&gt;to mean a major increase in the generating capacity of this

&gt;either fossil or nuclear fuels. Couple that with the idea
&gt;that electrical generation under conventional methods is
&gt;not all that mechanically efficient...and, by the way, neither
&gt;is recharging batteries. So there is a double whammy effect
&gt;here.

&gt;If we are going to have alternative power sources for our cars,
&gt;I don't believe &quot;plug in&quot; electrical vehicles are a long term
&gt;answer....a technology such as fuel-cell or solar cell is...
&gt;but as Bob said in his first posting, big industry decides

Hi Ric,

[soapbox mode on]

We are now up to 4 cents as I add my two.  I join you in your critique of
the electric car as a panacea. It is not.  While being an engineer for an
electric utility I can see some benefits (such as using generating capacity
that would otherwise be idle to charge vehicles at night.  Did you know that
there is nuke and hydro power that is sold as dump power at night for less
than a penny a kwh?), I believe the costs of electric cars far outweigh the
benefits.  Plus it lets California continue to put its pollution in other
states because most of the new generation for California seems to obscure
the view of the Grand Canyon because its in Arizona ( a bit of an
exaggeration ).  But I digress...

I wanted to add something to your comment about &quot;industry.&quot;  And Bob too.
While big industry trashed the mass transit systems of Southern California
and nationwide, why didn't the opposition succeed in stopping them?  Bob H.
seemed to think that the bribes paid for it at least part of it.  GM bought
them.  The cities or transit authorities sold them.  We could have made a
law making it illegal to buy a mass transit company from someone for the
strategic advantage it offered. :) Don't get me wrong.  I am not defending
GM, but merely trying to increase the understanding that for businesses to
succeed, they must understand and react to the marketplace.  And somehow
jobs are created by big bad business at the same time they are pursuing this
strategy.  Business ethics, someone once said, is an oxymoron.

If we wanted to stop GM at that time, we should have used the transit more
thereby raising its value and made it indispensable OR, stopped the transit
authorities from selling them by political means, OR stopped buying any cars
from GM so they wouldn't have the money to buy them.  Did anybody know those
answers in 1946?  What made them palatable or unpalatable back then?
(Substitute the word Microsoft for GM and 'something computer related' for
mass transit and this discussion turns into the thread from h*ll.) In 1996,
there is nothing we can do about the loss of these transit systems 50 years
ago.  

But, there are at least a couple of alternatives for stopping future changes
we disagree with.  We could build a government so large with so many limits
on freedom and so much bureaucracy and regulation that it forces people to
build and maintain mass transit systems or electric cars or eliminate CFCs
that myself, my kids and my grandkids pay for because OBVIOUSLY we know that
we need them.  I mean this in an ironic way.  Some people think they can
tell me that mass transit is absolutely needed and I must absolutely help
pay for it.  And since there will never be enough money to pay for
everything the Annointed Who Know Whats Good For Me wants, I am a Bad Person
for telling them I won't pay for it and disagreeing about Their absolute
requirement.

OR, we could agree that too much power and limits on my freedom are resident
in elected politicians.  We should limit their power by taking away the
money that funds their power.  Take responsibility from them.  Keep your car
forever.  Teach your kids the same thing.  But in America, you can't keep
someone else from buying what Detroit or Hiroshima or the Transit Authority
is selling.
