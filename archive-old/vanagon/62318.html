Subject: Is Digi-jet Bosch?

Hello--

I'm currently fumbling through my Fuel Injection problem. I found the book on
Bosch Fuel Injection Technical Support available via mail-order from Rocky
Mountain Motorworks. Can anyone tell me if the Digi-jet system on my 83
water-cooled is a Bosch product? Or, will the Bosch literature give me
insight if the Digi-jet is manufactured by VW? (I'm currently 40 miles from
my Vanagon, so I can't just open the engine compartment to check.)

I've already replaced most of the vacuum lines and will replace the line from
the aux. air valve (which seems old and dry at best) this week when I get
back to the bus. The idle is low and rough (about 800 rpms), then surges for
about thirty seconds, then back down low again. It will stay at the low idle
for a while then for no apparent reason surge again. The idle adjustment
screw does nothing to increase the rpms. If I close it all the way it will
stall the engine. But to open it at all it keeps 800 or a little less rpms.
It runs OK on the road but seems to surge a little here as well and lack
power. The power seems weak esp. on hills. Although it's my first Vanagon (2
mos.) it seems much less powerfull than I imagine it would be. But I know
it's not a speed demon.  

The engine is newly rebuilt by VW of Canada, and the spark plugs are (were)
badly carbon fouled. I cleaned them up. (This is in part due to a bad gasket
at the throttle body meets the plenum which I replaced. Thanks all for the
advice on finding and fixing this vacuum leak). The timing seems OK, but it
may be hard to get exact with the rough idle. If anybody has an &quot;ahh-hahh&quot; to
offer it would be much appreciated. Otherwise just the advice on the Bosch
book or any other will be appreciated.

And Happy Fourth to those in the USA! (Sorry to gloat if you're British.) I
was hoping to get to the Deleware Water Gap this weekend, and last weekend
for that matter. But the Magic Bus is celebrating it's independence instead.

TIA
