CA&gt;The standard price of the motors [VR6] are $4k-$5K(used) and you have to
make sure
CA&gt;you have the complete harness and all accessories.

Ludicrous, local yard was asking $1500 complete with fi stuff and
accesories,
for 19k miles out of a stomped '92 (first year admittedly the ole
distributor
ignition model) Passat.  They likely still have, anybody interested?
