Subject: Re: Re[2]: Windshield Wipers Summary

A few years ago I helped a friend of mine paint my truck. After we were
done and were cleaning it up so I could drive it home he grabbed some steel
wool and either enamel reducer or thinner, both do the same thing for the
purpose used for here. And he proceded to clean my windows, inside and out.
My first reaction was not good. He said &quot;Trust me&quot;. When I drove the truck
home later that night I was amazed at the clearness of my windows. Never
would have believed it had I not seen it myself.

&gt;???????????    Are you both sure about this?  Don't like scouring
&gt;windshields and Bon Ami is scouring powder I thought.  Tried Windex? Works
&gt;fine for me. Spray it on thick and rub/wipe thoroughly, lifts grease film
&gt;fine.  Do the inside too!   Tim

&gt;&gt;     to be cleaned with &quot;bonaime&quot; (spelling). It's like Comet, or Ajax,
&gt;&gt;     but will not scratch the glass.
