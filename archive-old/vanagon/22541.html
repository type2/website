Subject: RE: Whatever happened to... (was: Vanagon Power?)

sm&gt; a strong exhaust smell. Replaced both boxes with cheapie
sm&gt; aftermarket ones, and suddenly the heater was wimpy-- only seemed
sm&gt; to work on warm, sunny days. I've since learned (from this list!)
sm&gt; that some replacements are little more than J-tubes with shrouds,
sm&gt; and that the good ones with internal fins must be sought out.

        Anybody know what the quality of the boxes from Whitney is? Or
other sources for heater boxes that won't cost me more than my bus? (rather
difficult item-I paid $150 for my bus, but that's another story...) Thanks
in advance.

Peace,
