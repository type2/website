G'day,

I'm one of those list lurkers - given the internet is new to me - and &quot;list
type forums&quot; even newer.  I have been amazed - ne horrified at the ease at
which some - few individuals - can be so quick to &quot;flame&quot; - in so &quot;public&quot; a
forum. 

All i know is that this list is wonderful forum - and i would hope that, as
in the response from ms. Wacker, that all that went wrong with Bus Boys was
timing.  Rob i suspect will have his money very soon.

Enough of this &quot;thread&quot; ?
