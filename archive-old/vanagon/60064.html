Subject: New Vanagon List Update, II


I had a nice chat with Ron this morning. Apparently, his net connection
has been down for the past few days and may continue for another day or
so. 

He's informed me that he's received *one* check so far. He's compiling a
list of contributors that will go on a web page. This page will serve as a
&quot;receipt&quot; of sorts that we received your check. He'll let us know what the
URL is as soon as he gets back in the saddle.

LISTSERV, the software that runs the list is going to cost us a bit more
than we had anticipated. They've got a net unfriendly (STEEP) pricing
scheme. We've modified our original cost estimate (for hardware and
software) from $1500 to $2000 (give or take $300). Based on the pledges
we've received via this list, the price should not be a problem. We
currently have around 700 subscribers to the list, but not everyone is
active. If we get at least $3 from each person we should have minimum
funds. If you want to write a check for an even denomination ($5, $10), that
would be much appreciated as well. All monies will go into the machine and
software.

We are also soliciting help from other groups that may want to set-up a
listserv as well with the intention of sharing costs.

So send in those checks in. Write the checks to Ron Lussier and send
them to:

Vanagon
c/o Ron Lussier
10164 Parkwood Dr., #8
Cupertino, CA 95014-1533  USA

We've got a hot T1 internet connection just waiting for our vanagon list.
