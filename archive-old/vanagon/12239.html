&gt;
&gt;Got knows what this says, but there is something about fascism at the end.
&gt;Anyway, he seems to want help.


Another false alert:
he's just looking for help because he needs to move his furniture. He
needs to borrow a VW van or *similar*. Wasn't able to rent one.

His sig is against fascists. He wants them to leave the net. And he's
against all kinds of laws and controls; government, etc...
