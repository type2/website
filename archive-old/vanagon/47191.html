Subject: water pipelines

Ever notice how long the Alaskan Pipeline is? Care to take a guess at it's
diameter? Think they'd spend the extra money for this enormous diameter if they
could get the same flow through a 2&quot; pipe? The anamoly between plumbing and
electrical circuts applies both ways; the smaller the orifice (greater the
resistor) the lower the flow (remember you multiply the resistance by the length
of the resistor, for those of us working outside the realm of the
microcomputer). But don't forget to add into the equasion the heat lost while
the coolant travels to the radiator. I also think that VW products were highly
engineered, and that very small tolerances to ALL variables apply. I don't think
that any mistakes were made in the engineering, and all systems will operate AS
SPECIFIED. All ratios and tolerances are critical, inlcluding the coolant mix
ratio. Not that I have a leg to stand on....
