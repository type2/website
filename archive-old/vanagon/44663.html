Subject: RE: Scat Enterprises?


&gt;Anybody have any experience of Scat Enterprises, out of Redondo Beach, CA?
     &lt;snip&gt;
&gt;However, if someone knows that these guys have only been around for
&gt;three weeks or somesuch, I'd rather not think too much about calling
 ^^^^^^^^^^^

Uh, try three decades.

Scat is one of the oldie-but-goodie VW aftermarket suppliers. I've bought
bits and pieces from them over the years, generally with good results.
Never bought an engine, so can't attest to the quality there. Things
change, of course, but when a company has been in the same line of work
as long as Scat has without losing all their customers, they must be
doing *something* right.

I'm not affiliated with Scat, just a satisfied customer.
