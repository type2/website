Subject: '87 Camper FS

I went to my local dealership to get some parts today. Among a whole
bunch of Volvos and Jeeps, they had a very nice '87 camper. It is
silver, with blue interior. The peculiarity of this one is that it is
not a Westfalia, but an aftermarket conversion. Very well done, indeed.
The pop-up goes straight up (as opposed to the Westie's &quot;triangle&quot;), and
it doesn't have a roof rack in front. Instead, it has a nice, operable
sunroof. Comes with side awning, curtains, tape player,etc. Manual
transmission.No air conditioning.(Non-GL?)
Interior is non-Westfalia, so the thing can seat 7 passengers. The rear
seat turns into a bed. It looks VERY clean. They are asking $10,000 for
it. 
Just in case anyone in the neighborhood is interested...
I have absolutely no monetary interest in this. (Nor any other interest,
for that matter).  
I forgot to check the mileage, but can do a more detailed inspection if
anyone requires so. 
Cris.
'91 Westie &quot;Fafner&quot;
'66 Kombi (Being painted, Neptune Blue)
'67 Deluxe (parts car, only because I have no title!)
