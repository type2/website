excuse my ficticious email address and the cloak-and-dagger routine.  DO NOT
try to reply to it.  reply to the list in general if you are interested and
i will email you privately. or call me.

but i do have a shell from a BA6 heater.  now this is just the stripped
shell, no sensors, motor, switches, wiring, relays, etc.  just the metal
shell.  and it has a problem:  the aluminum combustion blower motor housing
is stuck in the steel heater housing and is broken/corroded and looks to be
a rat to get out.

PRICE = free + cost of shipping.  for me, this beats it going to the scap heap.
