&gt; &gt;Now, if I can only figure out why the headlights go off and the radio

&gt; &gt;
&gt; Because they're meant too! You can just move the radio connection to an 
&gt; ignition  controlled terminal at the fuse panel if you don't like it. Might 
&gt; need a twinned spade lug to do it if those terminals are all full. My Rabbit 
&gt; shuts off the (factory) radio with the ignition, something I hate when 
&gt; waiting around, since all those red lights on the dash are annoying just to 
&gt; get the radio. My Honda has a radio only position on the switch, with the 
&gt; key in. I think VW wants you to enjoy the radio in your van when resting, 

My Radio stays on with the key off, so long as the key is in the ignition.
(85 vanagon).

&gt; without leaving any keys in the ignition. I usually rewire the radio to be 
&gt; available anytime, for convenience. The headlight thingie is for us absent 
&gt; minded professors, just like the drivers door requiring your key to lock it. 
&gt; I've still locked myself out BTW!  tim s.

I've got a coathanger riding around in the rear bumper, I've learned to 
break into 85 vans pretty quick now(lots o'practice:))

&gt; 
&gt; 
My question is... what's the un connected terminal in the ign. switch for?
The one that only gets power when the key is off?
Someone told me it was a european thing about leaving a sidemarker light on
when parked...   ???
It seems to me more like somthing for an alarm.
Anybody know the real answer?
