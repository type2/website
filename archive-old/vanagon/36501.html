Subject: RE:Mexican Busses



&gt;The Mexican Vans use the Rabitt based engines.  These engines are reliable
&gt;and easy to fix.  parts are available and reasonable.  Since VW had the
&gt;rabbit in the van, I still do not know why they spent the money to engineer
&gt;the Waterboxer nightmare.

This one has puzzled me also. If people are replacing the Diesel 
 engines with gas, why didn't VW do this in the first place?  Is the 
 rear cargo deck height higher on the diesel vanagons? Why Why Why?
