Subject: Possible KYB Shock Source

Hello All,
	Has any one had experince with a company named Performance
Suspension Technology, of Montville,NJ.  Thier webpage,
http://www.p-s-t_dot_com/ , advertises KYB shocks for $119 for 4, with free 
shipping. This is about $40 less than I've found locally.  Information on 
other sources will be welcomed.


	Thank You.
