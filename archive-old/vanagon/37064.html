Subject: South America Update

Hello everybody! 
	We are accumulating some excellent advice, and making 
some interesting contacts for our big voyage to Chile. Thanks to all the 
members of the list. 
	When things get a little warmer here, we will hopefully get ambitious
enough to try and tackle some of our van's problems.
	
	As for &quot;THE LIME GREEN DEBATE&quot;, the colour is sheer artistic genius
in my humble opinion.

	-Al Joseph
