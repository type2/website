Subject: RE: Strange Electrical Problem - '56 Bus


&gt;The '56 has once again developed an electrical gremlin.
&gt;
&gt;A few weeks ago, it started doing this thing where it would not
&gt;start if it the motor was hot.  It would just turn over weakly.
&gt;If you let it sit, for a while, it was fine, or if you pushed it,
&gt;it would start right up.
&gt;
&gt;It got worse and worse, so I put a new battery in.  The old battery had 
leaked
&gt;pretty bad, and there was acid everywhere :(
&gt;
&gt;Now when I turn the key, it just clicks.  If I keep working it, it 
eventually
&gt;turns over rapidly and fires right up.  I can hear the &quot;ping&quot; of the 
starter
&gt;gear, but it doesn't turn over at all.
&gt;
&gt;I have the &quot;Muir Solenoid&quot; installed.  The starter and bushing are just 
over
&gt;a year old.
&gt;
&gt;Any ideas?  I was thinking the ignition switch might be bad:  One day when 
it
&gt;did the &quot;slow turning&quot; trick, the ignition switch stuck itself in the 
&quot;start&quot;
&gt;position a couple times, so I could take the key out, and it would still be
&gt;turning the motor over!
&gt;
&gt;Any ideas?

Sounds like it's been voting Democratic too long, Thom.   :^)
