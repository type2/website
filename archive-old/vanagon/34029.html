So Dave Kautz says:
&gt;   With apologies to Steve Johnson, I'm going to disagree with the notion
&gt;   that driving 70 mph wears the engine at the same rate that driving at a
&gt;   slower speed &lt;in the same gear&gt; over the same distance for a longer time 
&gt;   does.

David!!

I never said that it wears at the same rate!!! I said that there was not
much dent in the life of an engine.  Especially compared with stop and go
city driving.  I know that a brick at 70mph hour will be more wear than
at 55mph simply from the amount of extra strain on the engine and probably
the extra heat on the valves.  

So please don't quote me as saying something that I didn't.

Thank you,

Steven
