Subject:  Aux. Heaters in Vans                    Ref:  

With all the recent discussions about adding additional heaters, auxiliary
heaters,  space heaters, furnaces, etc. to camper vans or just plain vans
(wouldn't have anything to do with the coming winter would it?)  it occurs to
me to offer this suggestion to the group at large :

If you are planning to augment the engine heat with some (any) kind of
additional heater, especially for use in winter camping, long drives, and/or
while sleeping in your camper, invest a few bucks in one of those battery
powered carbon monoxide  (CO) gas detectors.  These are the CO analog to the
home smoke alarm.  They could save your  life sleeping in a small, poorly
ventilated heated camper.  I'd hate to loose anyone of you to CO poisoning!

Regards
Harvey
