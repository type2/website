&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;        Has anyone ever heard of this tire brand?
&gt; 
&gt;  I am reposting the following to the list. For some unknown reason it
&gt; didn't make it through correctly last time.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   My friend is a Equine Vet. He has a Toy##a PU that he puts thousands of miles on going to the different farms and ranches in the area. He put Coopers on his truck and had very good luck. He used a larger tire than you indicated though. Cooper ,from what I understand, is the only American tire company left. Cooper made a deal a while back to make tires for Sears. I don't know which ones. I know Michelin makes tires for Sears too. I just saw a Syncro westy that had 205/R14 Roadhandler tire
