Subject: Shiftless

I just replaced the tranny on my '81 vanagon, only to find that the
shifter doesn't reach far enough to go into any gear. At first I thought
it was just a linkage adjustment problem, but after hours and hours of
trying, I'm thinking it's something else. I've got the Bentley, did the
adjustment as per that, to no avail. That adjustment, btw, is
essentially to select neutral on both shifter and tranny, then use an
appropriate guage (either .75&quot; or .82&quot; depending upon chassis number) to
adjust side movement.
   Mine shifted okay before, it's just that third gear was blown. So
now, if I lengthen the shaft long enough to get it into first, let's
say, it then would be too long for second. The tranny can be shifted
into any gear back at the tranny, so what it seems like is that there
simply isn't enough length on the bottom end of the shift lever (below
the pivot point) to push the lever on the tranny far enough in any
direction. 
   Are there different shift levers for different trannys? The above
mentioned two different adjustments don't seem even remotely enough
difference in movement to do what is needed.

  Please reply off list since I only read the list thru the archives.
Thanx.
