Cris,

Just had this problem on my 90.   Problem was the connector hooking the
wire harness to the switch, (in the driver's side panet) which had gotten
corroded.   Cleaned them and it's fine.

&gt;Hello again.
&gt;Another thing attempted-unsuccesfully-this weekend was the electric
&gt;mirrors. The one on the driver's side only moves from right to left, the
&gt;passenger one doesn't move at all. I can hear a &quot;click&quot; each time I move
&gt;the switch, though. 
&gt;Dissasembled the whole driver's side unit today. Cleaned connections,
&gt;checked everything and did the procedure mentioned in Bentley to
&gt;increase adjustment range (66.3), but this didn't fix the problem. 
&gt;Checked the archives, with no luck. Can anybody help? I am sure I am not
&gt;the first one with this problem... 
&gt;Thank you.
