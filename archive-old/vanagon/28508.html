Subject: Re: Help: Crew Cabs are worthless

&gt;that a driving vehicle is worth something.  She also said that the appraisal
&gt;company called around a couple dealers and that the going price for a mint
&gt;one is $700, so mine must be worthless.

        WHAT??!!! I can't find a *used, rusted* splittie for much less than
$600. I guess '68 rules out the split, but $700 for MINT??!! Hell, that's
what you pay for a hunk o' junk that runs!! My buddy in Cal paid about $3k
for his '65 (? not sure on year) crew cab. Where's these dealers and how
many can I/we buy???!!!!

Peace,
