Subject: 1966 Volkswagen VW Van for sale

1966 Microbus.  Replaced transmission, engine runs well, it's a 1400 I
think.  Body in good shape, painted primer red.  Jalousy windows, step
through front seat.  Fold down bed/seat in back.  Good tabs.  I just don't
drive enough to keep it.

A few stupid things to fix, like brake lites, but otherwise ready to roll.

$1350.00 OBO    It's parked at Summit Ave East and Lorretta - 1/2 block
north ofthe intersection of Summit Ave East and Olive way.  Across from
Boston Market, Capitol hill, if you want to drive by and see it.
