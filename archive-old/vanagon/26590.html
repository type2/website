Subject: 81 Vanagon Blues Revisited.

Last month I posted my saga on the list, of 8 engines in 75K miles for my
81 Vanagon.  Engine #8 is shiny and sitting assembled on trusted mechanic's
shop floor.  It is promised for delivery to me Monday - just in time for
'Striper' fishin.  Oh boy, oh boy, I can't wait!  I gave him a copy of my
posting and some of the (less critical) replies.  He was appreciative, so I
am hoping for a lasting rebuild of my stock 2.0 replacement this time.
Will keep y'all posted.

By the way, how about VANAGONADS?  (sorry Martha, definitely not
politically correct - forget it !)
