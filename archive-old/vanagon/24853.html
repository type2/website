Subject: Correct timing for '72 Bug

Sorry this question isn't about a bus, but I know someone on this list will
be able to help me out.  My engine code starts with &quot;AE&quot;.  According to St.
Muir, my timing should be static timed to 5 degrees ATDC.  My question is
this.  When the notch in the crankshaft pulley lines up with the crack in the
crankcase, is that 0 degrees or 5 degrees ATDC?  BTW, in case it makes a
difference to anybody, everything on the engine is original so I know the
pulley is the correct one and all that.  Any help would be greatly
appreciated.
