Subject: Trucks

	Dave Thomas wants a VW Pickup.
	Dave,
	Pickups and crew-cabs exist, but are somewhat rare. Turns out
there's a 25% import duty on trucks- as long as VWs were the only alternative
form of pickup, they were still imported and still sold. With the advent
of the Japanese pickup truck, often shipped here partially assembled
and with beds and tail-gate manufactured and installed in the USA,
the VWs became, apparently, uneconomical.
	So split-window pickups and crew-cabs are about as common
and bubble-window AND Vanagon trucks. I've seen a Vanagon Crewcab
on the road, one of the local VW places has another as the shop truck.
Other than those two vehicles, the newest pickup/crewcab I've ever
seen in the USA is a 1976 crewcab that someone brought back from 
Germany.

	VW finally solved the problem with the Rabbit-based pickup
(Made in USA) of the 80s, then completely lost the recipe for selling cars
in the USA.

	Anyway, pickups and crewcabs *are* out there, just a bit
rare. Join LiMBO/NEATO/SOTO, etc. Go to the shows. Read the papers.
It took me about 3 months to find &quot;Little Martha&quot;, my '70. I bought it
sans engine and still haven't got 'er on the road, but progress is made
every month, at least. I paid $1200 for a vehicle w/o engine. I've seen
95+ point restorations for $8K (bay-window crewcab) and had people
with fresh paint and Safari windows on a '63 seriously ask $4900 for
something without functioning turn signals... The '86 was in primer
over the original German Army (!) paint and said to be asking $3500.
Expect to pay at least $2K and be surprised (and pleased) if you don't.

	Owing to proximity to Canada, and cold, I'm told the Pacific
Northwest is a good place to buy a VW truck. Had I not gotten involved
in the one I bought, a trip to Seattle would have been next on my agenda.

	Of course, I do these things all wrong and you'll doubtless find
a Vanagon Pickup for $1500 if you're patient enough! They'll want
another $2K for the Porsche Speedster parked next to it in the barn...
