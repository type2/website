Subject:      starting problems

This is our first message to the list, so i hope I'm doing all correctly.
Anyway... on to the problem:

Our 84 Vanagon has had the same starting problems as one of the other list
members has described over the last few days. Most of the time, it starts
just like it should, but once in a while (once every couple of weeks?) All
of the normal indicator lights come on, a &quot;whirring&quot; noise is heard in back
(a fuel injection pump?) but no starter, no solonoid, nothing.  Did this
again tonight, and I pulled the plug to the ignition switch, tested it (for
continuity) as per the manual, and all tested okay.  Plugged it back in,
still no start.  Then pulled plug partially off to test for voltage across
the switch in the start position, and when I turned the switch to start, it
started!

Needless, to say that was the end of my tests... can't test for a problem
that no longer exists. Does the continuity test tell me that the switch is
good, or can there be other problem in the switch itself?  Any thoughts on
where to start my tests next time?

Thanks for anything and everything in advance.
