EVEN IN UP HERE IN ALASKA THE PROPEX COMPACTS ENOUGH HEATER!

&gt;I have looked at these heaters--they are 3 to 4 times the size of the
&gt; Propex and I think would require you to put holes in the side of the van. The Propex vents through the floor of the van.

I'VE SEEN THESE LARGER UNITS MOUNTED IN THE FRONT CABINET UNDER THE SINK
AND VENTED THROUGH THE SIDE OF THE VAN &quot;UGLY VENT SYSTEM/BIG HOLE&quot;.  I
BET THEY USE 3 TO 4 TIMES THE PROPAIN TOO!

PROPEX HEATER:
I've found that the 3 gallon propain tank on the Westie is enough for
ALL gas appliances (propex/cooker &amp; fridge) on extended trips of around
a week.  The Propex (as I was origionally told by the manufacturer) is
VERY miserly with fuel consumption.  As for reliability it's been
superb, the only problems I've had have been with snow, slush &amp; general
winter crap blocking up the inlet/outlet pipes.  I've had mine since
1992 and would not be without it!!!  I also fitted a carbon monoxide
detector above the lower bunk, under the A/C unit for those who have it
(just for peace of mind &amp; its never gone off).
