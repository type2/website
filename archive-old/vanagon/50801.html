Subject: Elizabeth Forge pix http site 

Many people it turns out don't do FTP (y'all old farts: stop laughing!),
so I added a bit to the page I wrote for Mssr. Robertson's nice drawings
and now both are on the same page.  Please note the sizes, they are
quite large.  If I get a little time, I will thumbnail them sometime
later. The URL is:

http://www2.ari_dot_net/dworkin/vw/

Have at it, volks!
