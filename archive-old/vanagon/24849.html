Subject: Re: VWofA suing over VW piccie use???

A few comments:

*1.*
VWoA would be wise to recognize the potential within the &quot;supporters&quot; of
their products. I beleive this non support by VWOA to be one of the biggest
potential faux pas of marketing history. Originally they enjoyed one of
biggest advertising/marketing sucesses in world history now they are risking
stepping on their third leg by not fostering those who, in the near future,
may be able to purchase (or are currently purchasing) the newer product
line. If VWOA is reading this post then I beg them to please wake the heck
up! Thank you VWOA for sending one of your corporate marketing
representatives and supporting us at the Arizona Bus Club Jamboree which was
held at Jerome, AZ, USA on September 15, 1994. I personnally have not heard
of any other VWOA support of the secondary market since then. The biggest
potential target market of VWOA's new product line exists within the
existing secondary market. Granted, not everyone can afford to or would
choose to purchase a $20,000-$40,000 vehicle. More focus and support needs
to be placed toward the development of the long term target market rather
than focusing all effort on today's bottom-line results.

*2.* A representative of VWOA, (Ms. Sally Eberle) attended the event
described above upon receipt of an invitation from the Arizona Bus Club. Her
attendance of the event was truly appreciated. As an individual, not as a
member of any organization, I support promoters of all events to formally
and professionally extend the invitation to your next event. I do not
condone any inflamatory communications or malicious actions by any
individual or group. Contact:

Photographic and Illustrative renderings of (most)anything can be deemed to
be &quot;works of art&quot; and can be copyrighted by the creator of the image.
Certain limitations and restrictions apply, but this game can be played to
the Nth degree. Logos, trademarks etc. are protected but only to a point.
Find that point and stay just outside of the legal no-no side. As an artist
and a businessman I support protection of copyrighted works of all kinds. I
never support plagerism but I will always fight for civil liberties and
common sense. I have not been able to connect to the site in question. If
photographs, illustrative or other creative works created and copyrighted by
VWOA are being used in their original form without permission from or credit
being given to VWOA in a site belonging to other than VWOA then I
personnally think that it is possible that changes may be necessitated. I
encourage everyone to create new concepts and works. Wisdom, insight, and
common sense should prevail.

The comments above are *only* the opinions and expressions of Jim Ellis and
no one else. These opinions are covered under a little known and
increasingly attacked concept within the United States of America usually
referred to as the &quot;First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States
of America&quot;
