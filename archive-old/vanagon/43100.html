&gt; 
&gt; but seriously, what do you mean by this?

The handle that goes on the dash and/or the area on the wall 
behind the driver's seat.

&gt; do you mean by this that it has a smaller engine lid, and a big back hatch?
&gt;   or the suspension is different.    BD firetrucks  have piano hinges on the
&gt; deck lid and hatch in the back. 

Small engine lid, barndoor nose, ambulance hatch.
