Subject: Need Vanagon Tires

I've been looking for a long time for a Vanagon information clearinghouse. I'm
glad I've finally found it!

I have many questions about Vanagons, but I'll limit them to tires and wheels
this time. If you can offer any insight, opinions, recommendations, please send
them to me by E-mail as currently my only access to Internet is through
Compuserve (mail only).
I currently own an '86 Westphalia. I have the original equipment Continental
Transport tires that need to be replaced immediately (one has already begun to
separate). I have surveyed the tire stores and they recommend ply tires as the
reinforced tires are hard to find and not much cheaper. They have recommended
the Bridgestone 603V (6 or 8 ply), the Michelin MX4, and a Sumitomo 8 ply.
Any recommendations? Will the ply tires be noisier or have a harsher ride than
the reinforced? Road noise being very noticeable in Vanagons, are any of these
quieter than others?
I've also considered taking this opportunity to replace the wheels with the
alloys. Any pros/ cons to this idea?

Thanks in advance for any information you can pass along; I don't have much
faith in the tires stores' experience with Vanagons.
