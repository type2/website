Subject: window screens

I have a 93 Eurovan MV which has the sliding windows behind the passenger
seats. I have seen similar windows on Vanagans that have screens
and I understand the camper models of the Eurovan
also come with screens for these windows. I was wondering if it is possible
to buy these screens separately and install them myself. Anyone have any
experience with this? Thanks for any suggestions.
