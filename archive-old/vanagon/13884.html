Subject: Sticker vote update



Just a hello from the Secretary of the Vanagon-List State to let folks
know that I've received a number of votes and plan to tally results,
etc.  in a few days - I've been swamped at work the last 10 days, thus
the slow tally.

When will my employer understand that work should NOT get in the way of
my ability to absorb the Vanagon list flow! Some people just DON'T
understand....

For those of you who haven't voted, don't let this opportunity to
participate in Vanagon democracy (or is that anarchy...?) pass you by -
VOTE! (mail to wall_at_mcm_dot_com).
