Subject: Re: fiberglass polymer/wax removal


&gt;Anyone know something non-abrasive that melts
&gt;nasty polymer/wax from the uneven surface without hurting the paint?  I've
&gt;twice used a liquid from a cleaning supply store (no listed ingrediants).
&gt; It's better, but all that rubbing and hosing still has left a lot.  Simple
&gt;Green, amonia, turpentine, blowtorch, etc.?

I don't know that this will work, but it's what I'd try:

Go to a printer's supply and get a gallon of something called &quot;blanket
wash.&quot; Ask for the blanket wash that's water-miscible and slow-dry. Put it
on with a squirt bottle (they'll have those at the printer's supply, too),
let it work for five minutes or so, and hose it off hard with one of those
adjustable brass gizmos.
