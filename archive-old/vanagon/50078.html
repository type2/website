Subject: Type2 SO-42 Westy minutia needed!

In pursuit of the completion of the '67 Westfalia restoration I am looking
for a couple/three minor items. Anyone who is parting out any year SO-42
Westfalia please reply.

*Rear clamp-large closet cabinet*
Clamp type item which secures the rear end of the large closet cabinet to
the bus body. It is shaped like a 2.5&quot;-3&quot; circular metal plate that is bent
into a 90 degree angle along the 12 and 6 o'clock positions. An accompanying
clamp looks like a metal strap that has a short length of threaded rod
brazed on to it. A smallish nut holds the whole affair together after the
threaded rod is inserted through the cabinet. If you have seen one then you
will know what I mean. I know *exactly* what it looks like due to reference
photos taken, but would hate to have to fab the whole affair...

*Spare tire retainer* (Insight and part sought...)
Bench type splittie buses &quot;theoretically&quot; came with an item to secure the
spare tire, as it sits in the well behind the seats, to the back of the
bench. I think that it was either a flat plate that reached across the hole
in the five lug wheel or it may have been shaped like a numeral &quot;2&quot; with a
hole drilled through it on the flat portion. If it is the numeral &quot;2&quot; then I
have one. Can anyone advise? I will look at this closer this weekend.
&lt;Common sense indicates that this is a non-&quot;must have item.&quot;&gt;

*Brass table catch~female*
The main deck table hinges from the driver's side wall. On the bottom side
of the table is a smallish (male) brass piece that was to hook into a
matching female brass item that was screwed on to the base of the wall. The
intention was to keep the table secure in transit. 99% of the 65-67 Westys
out there are missing this female item. Does anyone have one of these?
Again, I eventually could actually make one given the right machine shop
opportunities and time or live with out it. It would be nice to have one if
the oppty presented it self.
I will check at local cabinetry shops etc. or punt =)

Please keep you eyes peeled for these items if you happen to go to a show or
have them laying in your garage. Contact me privately.
Thanks!

The clamp for the closet is the only real immediate &quot;need&quot;!
Heron, Swangstu, Clara, Hammill? Neato's OBR?
