Subject: Re: Don't Use: Click type torque wrench?

Click type torque wrenches are not immune to crappyness.
Snap-on type work beautifully,
I've seen some at a flea market that I wouldn't use to torque a garbage can
lid.
Ditto mechanical dial types.
But I have never seen a needle type that was worth a damn.

all IMHO o'course
