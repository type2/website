I tried to E-Mail you directly but the message bounced.   Thanks for the
offer of the Bently pages on the power steering.  I will take them if you
don't mind.  It is beginning to look like some kind of blockage in the
system maybe at the relife valve, dirt or ?  Anyways, I will try to flush
and refill the system this weekend.

Send to:  Frank Condelli, 5634 Carp Road, Kinburn, On., K0A 1H0

Thanks 

Frank
