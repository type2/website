&gt; At this point, wouldn't it have been just as easy to sell the
&gt; engine, push the bus in the river/creek/ocean and fly home?  Train?

Thom, you seem to have missed the point.  The joy is not in the 
arrival.  It is in the trip.  Myself, I am focusing what tiny amount 
of positive energy I have towards Bob and his task.  He needs it.  How
can anyone who is his own mechanic on a 40 year old vehicle advocate 
the 'easy' way out?  :)
