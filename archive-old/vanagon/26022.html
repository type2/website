Subject: Re: Hit from behind

tob&gt; I'm just glad as hell you're o.k. I dread the day we hear about
tob&gt; one of us actually getting hurt (or worse) by DWI bozos. I figure
tob&gt; that getting behind the whell of a car, even once, with too much
tob&gt; to drink should disqualify the driver from ever holding a liscence
tob&gt; again. The stakes are too high, and I've lost a couple friends to
tob&gt; DWI drivers. I'm so glad you could walk away from this one.

        For 5 years I rode a Suzuki GS850 as my only transpo in the LA
area-2 years of which I made a regular trip to San Diego on the weekends.
To avoid traffic, and because of my work schedule, I rode extremely late at
night-never got on the road before 11, often not 'till 1 or 2. Got real
familar with defensive driving. Almost every night I'd pull over after
IDing a drunk, sonetimes 2-3 on the same night, and call it in to CHP on
one of the call boxes. Never saw one pulled over, but I did my part-plate
#'s, auto description &amp; everything. Still do it whenever I see one. Those
bastards can really ruin your day when you're on/in anything with less than
10 wheels. I guess my point is to urge social conciousness upon one and
all-if we call 'em in, they *might* get nailed. And a maybe is better than
nothing.

tob&gt; I wish I had a nice '71 to sell you. Cheap.

        Likewise. Hang in there bud, karma will take care of both you and
the moron in the nova.

Peace,
