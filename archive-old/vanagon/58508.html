Subject: Sheesh? Duct Tape? BTDT

Sheesh, you guys are doing it the hard way :-) !  Simply remove the
upper grille and locate the ventilation air intake (covered with a black
plastic mesh screen) and put duct tape over it!  Works wonders :-)

Sean

Yep, Sean, I been dere done dat.  I was looking for a &quot;designed method&quot; as 
VWAG didn't supply either the foam filler I used to back up the &quot;riggers tape&quot;
(better than Duct Tape) or a roll of finely crafted Schwartzwalder Special
Autobahn Certified non phospate duct tape.

I shall continue to yank the grill in late November, stuff the intake with
foam, cover over with &quot;riggers tape&quot; AKA &quot;Gaffers Tape&quot; and leave it until
the poppies bloom.

The foam filler adds a bit of support behind the tape so it doesn't cave in
under the massive pressure differentials caused by right laning at 60MPH.
