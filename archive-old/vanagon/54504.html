Subject: Re: Friday!

In the beginning, we all have to learn . . .

4. I can't believe I actually drove down the Blue Ridge Parkway with my sail
   up! Thankfully my partner started looking for the reason for the drag on
   our speed and saw the roof still in the up position! (no wonder all those
   campers were staring at us as we left early in the morning.)

&gt; 
&gt; How about some&quot;I can't believe I .....&quot; in or to my vanagon?!
&gt; 
&gt; 1.  I can't believe I tried to kick snow off my mudflap when it was 5 
&gt; below zero!  (I now have a nice three inch tear in the flap).
&gt; 
&gt; 2.  I can't believe I didn't check my brake fluid before I left on the 
&gt; three hundred mile trip!  (Especially when I knew I had a leak!)
&gt; 
&gt; 3.  I can't believe I backed out of my garage with the roof vent propped 
&gt; open.  (That was a $165 mistake!)
