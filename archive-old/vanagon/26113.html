Subject: Re: cleaning carburator

&gt;Hi all,
&gt;
&gt;I'm about to rebuild the carburator of my '73 bus and was wondering
&gt;what you guys recommend for a thorough cleaning. Specifically, I want
&gt;clear  all passages with compressed air, but can not do this with the
&gt;normal air hoses provided in gas stations (can not control the
&gt;direction and flow of the compressed air by just pressing valve with
&gt;the finger). Does there exist a nozzle out there to hook to these air
&gt;hoses and make it easier and more precise to direct the compressed air
&gt;into the small passages of the carburator? If not, any other ideas?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks!

I've heard from reliable sources that _vinegar_ is the stuff to use for
cleaning carbs.  The acid content works as well as the super-toxic carb
cleaner stuff.  Sort of a mechanics secret I think.  Still have to blow them
out, I know you can get nozzles for compressed air chucks, we have one at
work.  I doubt if they would fit a gas station air hose though.

Eug,
