I had the same type of questions when trying to install a radio.  I 
took said radio to a local radio installer and asked them.  Very 
friendly and offered some advice.  Turns out on some of the newer 
equipment has to &quot;pull&quot; power rather than be &quot;fed&quot; as we usually 
do.  I has something to do with having a separate pwer supply or amp 
or something, anyway if in doubt have a pro look a your particular 
installation.  Same with speakers, more money  = more wires ! ?

&gt;&gt; I figured this would be a simple hook up of existing wires but I've run into
&gt; some unidentifiable wires.  For example, my radio has one red wire for power
&gt; but when I look at the hot wire from the van it is three wires leading into a
&gt; wire harness.  What might three wires be doing here?  Is one of them a
&gt; neutral, the other a ground, etc.?  Or are the other two here for moral
&gt; support?  Can I simply wire all 3 together into the red one?  Also, the
&gt; speakers have two wires each coming from the van and the radio has, of
&gt; course, only one for each speaker.  I originally thought this was a ground
&gt; for each speaker but someone said this could be a &quot;+&quot; and &quot;-&quot; connection.
