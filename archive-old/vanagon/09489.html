Subject: Re: W pretour trip report

I forgot to mention a BIG thank you to everyone who fixed all kinds of
things on my westy:

John Hugenard - for diagnosing and replacing a bad fuse under the 
driver's seat.  now, thanks to him, I'll have water, and the rest
of my lites, etc. in the DC system work.  Also, thanks for the lube job
on the seats.  The turn and swivel much better now.

Steve Johnson - for testing and diagnosing my rear reading light
problem.  I'll get the right bulbs tomorrow, I promise.

David Schwarze - for laboriously removing one of his very own brake
lite lamps for me to try.  Especially in the &quot;condition&quot; you were in.


Thanks to all of you nerds!
