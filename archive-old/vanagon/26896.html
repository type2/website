Subject: '74 Type II carbs

I have a '74 bus with dual carbs. About four years back I replaced my 
worn-out single Weber with two Brazilian-made Solexes that are very close to 
the originals. The bus runs like a bat outa hell, but will not pass 
emissions (mixture too rich). I have since learned that the carbs were 
jetted for a methanol/gasoline mix. I (and my mechanic) can not get any 
replacement jets for these carbs. My mechanic manufactured some jets that 
allow the bus to limp through the emissions test, but the bus runs so poorly 
that I have to change back to the rich-mix jets after passing emissions.

Anyway, I want to get legit with emissions and have a good-running bus. What 
should I do? Are there any after-market carbs out there that will allow the 
bus to pass strict emissions testing and still run decently? I'm also 
looking at a major engine rebuild in the next year or so. What about 
scavenging a '75 or later engine with fuel injection?
