Here's a puzzle for you.  let me set the stage.  i recently bought a '65
ucro deluxe. It has a 74 bug engine in it with about 5000 miles since
rebuild.  Acceleration was GA poor.  sort of had to pump it when shifting
low gears.  would cruise real well.  While waiting for a clutch cable, I decided to rebuild the 34PICT-3 carb.  I think the acceleration - stalling problem 
was due to a loose front nut holding the carb to the intake.  But i decided to
do the rebuild anyway.  Reinstalled, started up but ran Awful.  Like on three
cylinders.  Carb severely icing up (ambient temps 5oC).  Removed carb and 
noticed something missing.  What was it?  Ans. later
