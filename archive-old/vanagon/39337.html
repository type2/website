Subject: Re: Winnebago EV?

&gt; Now I've seen the EV Westfalia Weekender as well as the 
&gt; Winnie Rialta.  Was this another Winnie or a possibly a new Westie?!?!  

Quick run down of (pseudo) camper Eurovans.

Weekender - bed, cooler, pop-top, no real furniture

Winnebago/Westfalia conversion - Latest editions of the old classic, 
Winnie's in the US, Westies in the civilized world.  Pop-top, bed, 
fridge, stove, etc.

Rialta - Much larger Winnebago conversion using the drive train and cab 
of an EV (T4) but a Winnebago built box on the back.  nonpop up top but 
its already tall.  Lots of stuff including a shower and toilet.
