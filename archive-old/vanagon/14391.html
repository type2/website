Subject:      online car stuff

i got this from the honda list:
gopher://gopher.enews_dot_com:2100/11/showroom/edmunds
 --  OR  --
gopher://gopher.enews_dot_com:2100/11/showroom/edmunds/make

This is the online Edmund's car price guide which has the invoice prices
for just about every car, including Honda and Acura.

...
for those of you (like me) without all that fancy URL and WWW stuff,
try gophering to just
gopher.enews_dot_com
that got me a menu of a whole bunch of stuff. :)
