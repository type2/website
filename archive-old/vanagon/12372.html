Subject: Re: Sticker non-consensus solution



I've got it...sort of taking a cue from Joel's suggestion of a 1&quot;x1&quot;
square of reflective tape on the back hatch...what we need is something
&quot;computer&quot; to put on the back hatch, that would be on one hand small...
and unobtrusive...and on the other hand relatively identifiable...

Wait...I've got it...I betcha Steve Johnson could get us a whole
shitload of them defective, returned Pentium chips...we could
cut off the little &quot;legs&quot; from them, rendering them even more
useless for future use ... that ought to make Intel happy...
then we could put some double stick tape on the back of 'em
and glue them to the back hatch of our busses...

Hell we could even have a slogan &quot;Pentiums...blindingly fast, but
in accurate....VW Vans....unnervingly slow...but accurate (?)
