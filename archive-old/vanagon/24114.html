Ah yes, the Small on Safety Thread again.  This was one of Nader's
diatribes against autos.  It includes such scientific tests
as ramming a Ford Galaxie 500 into the back of a '56 beetle and
being amazed at the results.  It also refers to buses as by
far the most unsafe vehicle of any kind on the road, based on 
statistics that show it involved in more single-car accidents
than any other.  The theory being they get blown off the road
or the swing axles were unsafe.  My counter theory is that there
is just a small chance (in 1971) that maybe some of those people
driving buses had been, uh, stoned or something.  

Probably also didn't have the first ed. of Muir to tell them
to replace their swing lever pin bushing (which I'll be
doing this month :( I'll make sure to keep off drugs until then).
