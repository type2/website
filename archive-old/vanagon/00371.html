Subject: One last EV/Vanagon/Caravan observation....


First off, I would like to thank Gerry Skerbitz, Steve Johnson and
our &quot;trivial expert&quot; Joel Walker for a most stimulating and interesting
discussion ( or was it an arguement...remember that old Monty Python
sketch anyone?) on Vanagons, EVs and Chrysler shitboxes (can we all
agree on the Chrysler shitbox designation?....after all they don't
even have a ladder frame like a VW) this weekend.

I would like to close with one FINAL observation. Grateful Dead stickers
do not look out of place on a EuroVan, Vanagon or early VW vans. They do,
however, look WAY out of place on a Caravan!

;-)
