Subject: New member's starting problem

Hi, everybody.  I'm new to this list, posting from Allentown, PA.  I 
bought an '84 Vanagon with 144K miles on it about 2 weeks ago.  I've been 
really happy with it until the day before yesterday.  Then my problem 
started.

&gt;From a cold start, I drove about 4 blocks, stopped briefly at a bank 
machine, then restarted normally.  I drove back to the corner of my block 
and stopped, again briefly, at a convenience store.  When I tried to 
restart the van again, it turned over normally but would not start.  I 
tried and tried, but no luck.  I left it alone for an hour or so while I 
licked my wounds at home.  Finally I returned with my son to do some 
serious damage, but, with one more try, it did start up, though with some 
difficulty.  I drove around for awhile to recharge the battery, and 
everything was fine.  I assumed I had inadvertantly flooded it and vowed 
to never even touch the gas pedal while starting.  But it happened again 
today.

I drove about 4 miles from work to that same darned bank machine, turned 
the van off briefly, and it refused to start again.  It sits there now as 
I wait for both of us to cool off.  Can anyone help?

P.S.  What is the title of the Peterson book I've seen mentioned?  I have 
a feeling I'm going to need it.

Thanks.
