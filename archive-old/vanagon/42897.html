been there, done that (last december).  except it was my 85GL.

#1 injector line looked like the culprit.  Specifically, the 1 1/2&quot; hose
between the injector and black plastic manifold must have just barely been
leaking 'cause it was still mostly intact after the fire but was clearly
the hottest spot.

spent 2 months scrounging wrecking yards and reconstructing.  now every oil
change (and sometimes between when the mood strikes) i turn the key on w/ a
cold engine but w/out starting the engine so the fuel pump will run and
give a thorough leak inspection.  look for dampness not just drips.  check
for chafe points on all the hose runs under the deck.  lots of sharp edges
on intake plenum, alternator stands, et al.
