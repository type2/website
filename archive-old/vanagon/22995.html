Subject:  intermittent hard shifting q

on the way to work yesterday (rainy morning) i stopped to pay a parking
ticket.  backed out of parking spot into traffic lane, and the van did not
want to go into first (or second or third or fourth).  wiggled the shifter,
revved, double-clutched, still didn't want to go into first.  wiggled more. 
put on the hazards.  took a deep breath.  tried again - went into first no
problem.  this sort of scenario persisted at most of the stops for the rest
of the way to work, and on the way home - intermittently, but more often
than not.  once i get going, it's not a problem to get into the higher gears. 
noticed a while ago that the rubber bushing where the linkage connects
to the trans is rotted away, and ordered a new one (have to go pick it
up).  looked at manuals/checked archives last night, but i haven't got a
clue. what might cause this to happen all of a sudden?  please help! 

thanks, matthew (81 adventurewagen)
