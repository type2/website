&gt;Next to very small widths being measured in BCHs, which I will not spell
&gt;out in an archived forum, my favorite measurement joke is hearing something
&gt;described as a &quot;metric b*tch&quot;, 2.2 times worse than a b*tch.
&gt;B.

The larger-scale version of the same thing, which has been current here for
as long as I can remember is a metric schmidtload (bowlderized) which is 2.2
times as big as the American version.  Of course, if you want to pack it,
you use the same size blivet, just pack it a bit tighter.

I use it as the proper torque range for rear axle nuts, gland nuts, and gas
station installed lug nuts.
