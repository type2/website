Subject: another EV piston slap engine confirmed

Dealer finally acknowledged (after 13 long days) that my EV
engine does have piston slap. Didn't matter how much I told them
about other EV piston slap problems (via this great list).  Apparently
it's so bad with cylinder # 3, that it's easy to tell just by wiggling
the piston in the cylinder.

I have been on the phone with VWoA several times, and they still haven't
acknowledged this as a &quot;known&quot; problem.  The new service adviser (who 
I'm slowly coming to trust (should I even use that word?) says that
there's still no confirmation forthcoming from VW to him yet on piston 
slap as a problem.  BTW, he said some VR6 engines in Passats have it.

This isn't over yet.  There's still the decision on how to handle the repair,
and then actually doing it.  I'm envious of the other list members that
had everything diagnosed  and fixed in a couple of days.  They're
at least taking care of me with a rental GEO Metro, which I am mercilessly
flogging.  

Anyway, thanks to the list for making me aware of this, and keep your
fingers crossed that it will be returned better than before.  I'll let
you know the outcome.
