Subject:      Re: Rear License Plate Door, Vanagon

i just use my left hand to hold the license plate oil-check door open.
when i'm adding oil, i pull the little add-oil tube extension out and
after putting the plastic oil container into the tube, i let the door
up until it hits the container and holds it in place. so the door and
the container work nicely together.
