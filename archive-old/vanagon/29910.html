This happend to me a few  weeks ago.  I jumped into the van ('87),
started it, backed out of the driveway, and as I drove down the street,
the oil light and buzzer come on.  I immediately turn around and as I
pulled into the driveway, they (buzzer and light) went off.  I then hopped
into the Jetta to do my errand.

The next morning, the oil level was fine.  I started it and it was fine.
I test drove  and it was fine.  I drove it to work and it was fine.  Over
Thanksgiving we did a 700 mile road trip and it was fine.  In fact, I
almost forgot about it until this thread appeared.

So, is there a condition that could actually be causing an intermittent
low oil pressure, or is the problem in the switch itself?  Thanks for any
help.
