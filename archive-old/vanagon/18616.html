Subject: factory rebuilt engines?

I noticed an ad recently for a bus with a factory rebuilt engine.  Quite 
often on the list we talk of GEX and others for engines, but has anyone had 
any experiences with an engine they purchased from the VW dealer.  Out of 
curiosity I called my dealer and asked what the price was for a '73 type 4)- 
$1400.  Is this price out of line?  Would we expect them to be able to do 
this better than others, since the last aircooled engine vehicle from them 
has been over 10 years ago (not counting Mexico).  Hopefully they would be 
more knowledgeable about the engines than my dealer is.

Just wondering, since my dad had one put in a '65 bug we had and it lasted 
until my brother rolled the car - I think 10 years and near 80,000 miles.
