Subject: Places to get vanagon repairs on cross country trip

I will be starting an 8,000 mile trip soon and would like to have a list 
of good VW shops, just in case.  We will be leaving North Carolina for 
California, via Iowa, then heading up the coast to Seattle.  From there, 
we will go to Yellowstone, back to Iowa, then home to NC.  If anyone 
knows of any good places to get a vanagon fixed along the way (this seems 
to include most of the US!), please let me know.

Bill
