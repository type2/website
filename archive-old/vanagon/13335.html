&gt;I'd buy a barndoor bus, preferably a 53 or so. Then I'd buy a wrecked
&gt;synchro and a wrecked Porsche 930.
&gt;
&gt;With an airchisel, I'd cut the body of the barndoor off of its chassis. I'd
&gt;do the same thing to the body of the synchro, just leaving the ladder
&gt;frame.

[...]

&gt;As a final touch, I'd dump my wife, and find a 18 year old (to
&gt;avoid statutory rape laws) Blonde, Big Breasted, Bikini Bus
&gt;Bimbo. 
&gt;
&gt;Of course after doing all that, my bus would be guaranteed to
&gt;make it to the cover of VW T&amp;A...oops Trends!  ;-)

I'm glad someone mentioned this.  I picked up a copy of this magazine, and
was amused / disgusted by the number of women in bikinis.  The computer
industry used to do this same sort of thing, but I think those days are
past.  (I might not complain less if these were cute guys in the bikinis :-).
