&gt;I think I paid $1600 for my '75 last year in CA.  It needed cleanup,
&gt;still needs new canvas &amp; seals.  I've probably put about $1000 into
&gt;it since then.  It's ready for some minor bodywork and a paint job
&gt;about now...
&gt;

Paid $1300 for mine in May '94, very little rust, no dents/scratches, bad
seals, good canvas, sink (no pump), ice box (that's ICE box!), original UGLY
plaid interior.  BUT, &quot;rebuilt&quot; engine had to be rebuilt AGAIN after 1500 mi.
for another $1200. (and PO had conveniently disappeared!)  I've put another
grand into tires, brakes and fix-it's.  Oh, it is also sloppy going into 2nd
(hits &amp; grinds reverse if not careful) but, hey! it's part of Pumpkin's
personality!
