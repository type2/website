Subject: Cold Idle (lack of)

From: howard_at_aur.alcatel_dot_com

In the spirit of idling problems, here's mine which is a bit
different from the others currently on the list. I have an '87
Westy with 70K miles. It often stalls if the engine is cold
when I come to a stop unless I keep my foot on the gas. It 
usually has an ok idle right after starting, but if I touch the 
gas and then take my foot off it will stall. The problem seems
to be worse when it's hot outside. My theory is that whatever controls
the curb idle when the engine is still cold is not working properly.
That may be why the problem is better when it's colder out - the engine
is colder and it's easier for this mysterious part to detect a cold engine.
I know there is an idle control valve and idle stabilizer. Does either
one of these affect just cold engine idle? Is there a sensor that
is involved? I read the FAQ and replaced the coolant temperature sensor.
This didn't seem to help. In the last 5 months I've also replaced the
O2 sensor, plugs, rotor and distributor cap. Does the wiring harness
upgrade affect cold idle? How can I tell if this has been done - I'm
the third owner.

Thanks in advance for the help!
