Subject: Re: 12-point tool source

Since I seem to be in the minority (hey, I have orange hair; can't help
it), I thought I'd share some more info on sources for the 12-points. Bob
Hoover, in a direct reponse, noted that JCW sells a kit of 6, 8, 10 &amp; 12mm
12-pointers for about ten bucks.

Thanks! Joe
