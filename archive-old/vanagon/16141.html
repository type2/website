Subject: Re: CV Injection Procedure??

Check for a post on 4/21 &quot;Grease Needles for CVs, Rabbit Joke..&quot; for
instructions on how to use the &quot;needle&quot; technique.

A full disassembly/repack is much better--plus you can check conditions in a
face-to-joint way. I'm in the process of doing it to the front of my synchro
and, you're right, it's time-consuming. I'm really doing it to replace
cracked/torn boots.

Injecting grease with the needle would at least give you peace of mind in
knowing there's grease in the boot and that's worth something if you want to
put off the more complete job. I've run a joint nearly dry to the point it
was occasionally making noise, but if I'd injected grease, it may have been
fine. At some point, though, they'll need visual inspection and repacking. I
think Joel is getting a great life span on joints by repacking every 75k or
something like that.

Tough decision. How many miles on your synchro?
