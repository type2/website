Subject: RE: Governors (i.e.-rev limiters)


&gt;Hi all, just a quick question.  I'm working on getting my '66 Westy ready
&gt;for the road and I was just wondering if anyone out there still has a
&gt;governor on their carb.  I mean, it was put there for a reason, right?  At
&gt;what RPM is it supposed to intervene?  If I decide to take it off, it
&gt;looks like I just need to take the whole spacer-like thing out from between
&gt;the carb and the intake manifold and then get shorter studs for the carb.
&gt;Is this right?


Hmmm... have to admit ignorance here. I've never seen/heard of a rev
limiter on a VW engine, excpet for an ignition-cutout plunger on a
special rotor for certain bus distributor.

I *have* seen an odd EGR valve, that was fitted to a spacer plate between
the carb and intake manifold on a '74 bug engine in Colorado. I've heard
that these things exist in '73 California bug engines too. Got rid of
it pretty quickly in Colorado way back when, when I installed a Thunderbird
single-QP exhaust that didn't have the special EGR fitting from the bug
engine. Left the spacer in place, and covered the port in it with a piece
of aluminum from a hobby shop. A dab of Aviation Form-a-gasket helped.

Any chance this is what's on your engine? Or am I simply showing my
ignorance (wouldn't be the first time!)
