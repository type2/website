&gt;Jose,
&gt;
&gt;I'd call a locksmith. They have all sorts of stuff most humans never will
&gt;see. Plus its their speciatly.  Then, you can tell us. Seriously, I have a
&gt;frined in Tampa, FL who does this work, They are interesting people, and
&gt;very clever. So it's no answer, but a did you think to ask kinda response.

&gt;&gt;Hello, all
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;        Somebody has any idea in order to close the compartment for where the
&gt;&gt;levels of oil, water, are controlled etc.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;        This this very easy to open, (alone throwing of the), and I have
&gt;&gt;thought of putting a locking of security in order to prevent possible
&gt;&gt;robberies (bar of oil, plug of oil or any mischief)=20
