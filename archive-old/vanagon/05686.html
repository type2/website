Hello All:

I've been following for some months now, on behalf of my father.  He is the
proud owner of a '75 and an '85 Westfalia in Saint John, NB. But make him an
offer. :-)  He and Mom will be making a three(ish) month visit to England
this coming March, where they hope to tour the country side with one
excursion to the continent.  In a Westfalia.

He has researched the cost of renting versus shipping, and is pretty much
convinced that the '75 is coming with him.  I am curious if there are other
alternatives, such as possibly a third Westfalia.  Definitely not a '95,
even though the symmetry is appealing. Probably something used.  Can anyone
advise on the state of the market in those climes?  Would a right hand drive
be comparably priced, in case he wanted to sell the '75 in England?  Any
other advice or comments I could pass on?

Thanks in advance
