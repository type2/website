Subject: short-term rust stopping

From: Dieter Dworkin Muller &lt;dworkin_at_village_dot_org&gt;


So I'm about to go pick up yet another VW (a beetle), as a Christmas
gift for someone.  It's in pretty good shape, except for a major rust
hole in the left front wheel well, that allows road junk into the area
under the fuel tank (in front of the wall that you push the pedals
towards.  The floor pan doesn't appear to have rusted through yet.
Since I'm not in a position to do serious rust removal/repair on
this vehicle at the moment, does anyone have any suggestions on a
quick rust-stop that should last for a few months?

My current theory is to use some substance that converts rust to
something else (I've vaguely heard about them), and duct tape some
metal over the hole itself.  As I mentioned above, this is a
time-buying hack, not a true repair.

My apologies for being somewhat off-topic, but at least it's a VW....

Any advice will be greatly appreciated.
