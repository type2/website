Subject:      Re: Wax &amp; Paint

On my '84, the paint codes are on a sticker near the fuse
panel (above the clutch pedal).  Take the paint codes to the
VW dealer to get the correct paint.  As far as wax goes, I
just finished bringing back to life the paint on my '84,
which had been neglected by the PO for several years.  After
trying different compounds, I found that the best and
easiest approach was to use McGuiers (sp?) Body Scrub,
followed by their cleaner/wax formula.  I ended up with it
looking like new!  Also, to minimize the frustration, I did
only one or two panels of the van per day.  It took about a
week, but was worth it to be patient.

&gt; I have a 83 beige? and brownish orange?  Where can I get the correct
&gt; color names for touch up.
&gt;
&gt; Also what are your suggestions for wax/polish?  I am not too keen on the
&gt; job ahead.
