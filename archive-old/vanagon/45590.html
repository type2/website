Subject: [NEED INFO] `82 Westy Diesel (questions)

I have the opportunity to buy a rather worn `82 Diesel Westy.  It is cheap,
beat,
but has a rebuilt diesel engine in it.  My questions are as follows:

        -- How rare is the Diesel Option in a Westfalia??

        -- How reliable are the Diesel Westies??

        -- What's the going rate for an `82 Westy, gas and diesel?

        -- Was the original Diesel a flat or in-line 4??

More questions to follow, I suppose.
