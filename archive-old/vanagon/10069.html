My vote is for the Chargers.

I have to qualify that however ... Stan-the-man was originally with the 
Washington Redskins.

The 'nut' in charge of the Redskins, plus Joe Gibbs, plus others, were so 
&quot;in love&quot; with Mark Rypen that they let several potentially GOOD 
quarterbacks go just to keep Rypen!

Every time the chargers win, I love the fact that the Redskins' respective 
nose(s) gets rubbed in their own stupidity!

GO CHARGERS!!!!
