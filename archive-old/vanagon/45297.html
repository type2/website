Subject:       1966 Split Bus - What Carb ?

I am just about to fit my 1500 engine back into my newly rebuilt 1966 
split camper. The engine is currently fitted with some strange carb 
with a manual choke on it. I have a few SOLEX carbs lying around in 
my garage and I do not know what one is correct for my engine.

Any help by email would be most appreciated.
