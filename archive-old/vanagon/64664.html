Subject:      Re: Vanagon Syncro Delayed Start

&gt;I have an '86 Vanagon Syncro with a rebuilt AVP 2.1 engine.  Sometimes,
&gt;especially worse in colder weather, I have to turn and hold the ignition
&gt;key for several seconds before the starter motor turns over.  In warm

Fascinating...

a.  What is an AVP engine?

b.  Sounds like an electro-mechanical l problem ... what happens during the
20-30 second wait?  Not a peep from anything?

One theory ... the starter solenoid is sticky in cool weather.  I had this
problem once.

This is what is supposed to happen when the ignition switch is turned to
the start position:
1. Current flows in the solenoid winding, creating a magnetic field.
2. Magnet field pulls on a big metal plunger in the solenoid.
3. Plunger moves, and the starter gear is driven to engage the ring gear on
the engine flywheel.
4. Plunger motion also closes a heavy-duty electrical switch between the
starter winding and the battery - starter motor starts to spin.

My plunger got gooey with dirt and grease.  In cold weather, the friction
increased and caused it to move sluggishly.  One would like it to move with
a &quot;snap.&quot;  I took my solenoid apart (two screws), cleaned and very lightly
lubed it.  It's worked great for years.

BTW, the solenoid cannot be accurately &quot;bench&quot; tested alone.  Steps 1-2 are
a simplified description, and the magnetic field is actually built up in
two stages during the plunger motion.  If you do remove the solenoid, mount
it back onto the starter before bench testing.  Make sure you've got a good
source of current (like a car battery).

I'm assuming you've checked out other aspects of the system (battery,
cables, etc).

Hope this helps.
