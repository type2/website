Subject: T-SHIRT PRICE IS $15.00 NOT $10.00

This is so people don't miss this.  I'm putting the price in the subject 
line. I'd hate for you to have already gotten a bunch of $10.00 bills 
because people missed your followup.

&gt; think that perhaps he should start on the idea, and talk to the people
&gt; who would make those wonderful, happy shirts that everyone wanted. His
&gt; radio station always worked with a certain shop, who gave them a great
&gt; deal. He called, and began to discuss prices. Because these
&gt; super-special shirts had to be perfect, he wanted the best.

&gt; oh my, those prices were a bit higher than he thought, as the price
&gt; breaks for 100 or so shirts are definately better than those for 25. 
&gt; -high-quality, natural colored shirts(37 or less) $8.50 each
&gt; -5 different color screens (each $15) - $75.00
&gt; -art preparation charge- $25.00
&gt; And these are all at &quot;preferred customer&quot; rates.
&gt; Anyway, much to my chagrin, I would say that $12.50 would be more like
&gt; the cost. So with tax, I must pathetically ask for $15.00, to cover
&gt; postage as well, and $20.00 for international orders. We *can* get
&gt; shirts for $10.00, but they would be boring plain white t-shirts with 2 or 3
&gt; colors (black outlines included). Since I want these to be the best, I
&gt; must red-facedly ask for this. I hope this is agreeable, and sincerely
&gt; apologize for the stupid confusion, caused by my excitedly jumping into
&gt; this project without doing a little checking first.
