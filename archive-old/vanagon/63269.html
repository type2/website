I'm not sure what that has to do with the headlights and grill tho'.

Am I missing something?

&gt;      They drive on the left side of the street in S.A., right?  Gotta go

&gt;
&gt; Wasn't Chris Turner (JordanVW_at_aol_dot_com) talking about organizing a group
buy
&gt; of these from South Africa?
&gt;
&gt; Maybe we could shame him into getting back into the game ;-&gt;

&gt; &gt;      Does anyone out there have a line on getting Euro-spec headlights
&gt; for
&gt; &gt;      the late Vanagon?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;      I don't want to go retro to round lights (always wanted a Vanagon
&gt; with
&gt; &gt;      rectangulars).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;      Do our Canadian friends suffer with the same S.A.E.-approved junk
&gt; that
&gt; &gt;      we have?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;      Anyone in Europe with access to a few good wrecking yards want to
go
&gt; &gt;      into business?
