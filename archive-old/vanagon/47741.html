Subject: NEED '81 Cooling Tin and Steering Column Cover NEED

Oh the perils of two lists, had to figure out how to send to
both.

Subject says it all basically, if anyone out there has an
air cooled parts van I need.

all of the right side cooling tin IE lower (case to heat exchanger),
front lower (piece from front tin down to previous piece), rear right
(around oil filler tube, under fan etc), upper right (over cylinders),
and most importantly rear upper right (under alternator, connects
rear right to upper right).  I also need the 2 left lower pieces, I
first mentioned on the right side).  Local bug guy promised me these
for $25 but I've been waiting 3 weeks for him to get a set off.

Could also use a brown (or I guess if price was right black) steering
column/ignition switch cover.
