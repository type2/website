Subject: Re: Door Handle Repairs

&gt;split-window models.  Apparently removal of the core involves
&gt;removal of a dowel-pin instead of a set screw.  Anyone else have
&gt;any experience with this or am I the only one here fool enough to
&gt;take these handles apart?  If I can't drive the dowel-pin out, it
&gt;looks like I'll have to drill it out and install a new (probably
&gt;bigger) dowel-pin upon assembly.

Yup, tiny dowelpin to push out. Use a finishing nail cut off and filed flat
to make a tiny punch.  Or buy one?  Then it's no problem to remove the core
with the tumblers BUT make sure the key is in the barrel when you pull it
out or you may loose a tumbler.  Mine were gunged 'open', just put a dime
into the key slot to lock/unlock doors.  All my vans have had this happen on
all doors except hatch.High winter salt and cheap zinc lockbody.

Once the barrel is out put it to soak a few hours in a strong cleaner,
'calcium-lime-rust' CLR is what I used.  WD40 is useless. Then get a fine
flat tip screw driver, about 1/8&quot; wide blade and use that to tap loose the
slider tumblers.  Takes a while and quite a hit to get some of them moving.
Patience. Keep track of where they came from, screw this up and you get to
play find the code, with 7 tumblers I think.  Good time to rekey oddball
locks too. 

bye, tim
