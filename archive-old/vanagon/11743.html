Subject: Re:  early wheel hubcap clips

Thom,
  I bought the clips that Wolfsburg West sells, They are great! They come with
there own rivits which are a little tricky but with a block of steel and a 
ball-peen hammer they go on like cool man.  Never had a problem. Still lookin
for that ignition but am losing faith.

                                              Steve
