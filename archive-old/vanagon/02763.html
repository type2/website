Subject: fuel injection woes

I have a 76 Westy and recently survived my first camping trip.  Before leaving,
I had my mechanic adjust the fuel injection.  (The Westy wouldn't idle unless
it was warmed up for 10 minutes or so)

The Westy idled great for about a week after the adjustment.  Then, it returned
to the same sputtering without a lengthy warm up.  Thereafter, the problem got
worse.  It won't idle when it's too warm - unfortunately I had to discover this
in stop-n-go traffic on a crowded freeway full of anxiety prone weekenders.

I have another appointment this Thursday with the mechanic.  Any advice on what
service I should request?
