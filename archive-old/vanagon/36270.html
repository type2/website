Here's the CDI module manufacturer's info taken from the Hoover Sermons=
 Website:

&gt;                     Good News About CDI Modules
&gt;=20
&gt; In an earlier sermon I bemoaned the fact J. C. Whitney no longer
&gt; carried the points-triggered CDI module I believed to be most
&gt; suitable for installation in early Volkswagens. (Part number
&gt; 73XX4959N, or its waterproof cousin 73XX7080X)
&gt;=20
&gt; Mr. Keith Gawlik, a fellow subscriber to this list and a resident of
&gt; Boulder, Colorado, tracked down the manufacturer of the CDI module
&gt; and provided me with an address and phone number.
&gt;=20
&gt;           Universal Corportation
&gt;           730 Independent Avenue
&gt;           Grand Junction, CO 81505
&gt;           Tel (970)242-5267
&gt;=20
&gt; (Yes, that's the correct Area Code. It is one of the new ones.)
&gt;=20
&gt; A call to Universal put me in touch with Mrs Eileen Iles, who told
&gt; me they were waiting on new tooling for the extruded aluminum case
&gt; (which also serves as the heat sink for the module). The delay had
&gt; disrupted only that one model and she expected it to be back into
&gt; production (and back in J. C. Whitney's catalog) in the near future,
&gt; promising to let me know so I could pass the word.
&gt;=20
&gt; As I mentioned in an earlier posting, I've had perfect reliability
&gt; from this unit in numerous installations, the only failure being one
&gt; dead out of the box which was promptly replaced, no questions asked.
&gt; (And that was so long ago I'd lost the address.)
&gt;=20
&gt; Mrs Iles was surprised to know she had customers on the Internet
&gt; (she said to say 'Hello').
&gt;=20
&gt; Hello!
