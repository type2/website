&gt; This is a Load Range D, 8 ply snow tire.   Our local Nokia dealer can get
&gt; them for 100$ per tire (includes mounting only, balancing is 8$ extra).

I've got the Nokia Hakappelitta 10 in 195/R15 for a light truck for $89
shipped to my house.  You can call Greer Enterprises at 414-747-0996.
I put them on my 95 EV-Camper about 2 weeks ago. They are GREAT tires. I drove
from Warren,NJ to Albany last friday night in asnow storm, 5 hours. I traveled
between 45-55 on snow covered road and didn't slip once.


&gt; The size is 185R14.  They are stud-able (although this shop charges 24.95

That's what those holes were for. cool.

&gt; per tire -- rip-off!).  They are &quot;directional&quot; with a little arrow on the
&gt; sidewall that shows direction of rotation  (so be careful when backing
&gt; up :-).  I've got these on my Jetta -- they're excellent in snow and,
&gt; in spite of the very aggressive tread, are relatively quiet and handle
&gt; well on dry roads.  I have no experience with them on a vanagon/bus.

They work well. Just remember to tell your mechanic that they are directional.

&gt;
&gt; My mechanic &quot;found&quot; these.  When I called this same tire shop a week ago,
&gt; they said Nokia doesn't make a reinforced tire in that size.  FWIW,
&gt; the shop is STS Tire House in Poughkeepsie, NY (914) 471-2515.  STS would
&gt; have to order them right from Nokia, so I imagine any Nokia dealer could do
&gt; the same.
&gt;
&gt; Along with the Gislaved Nord Frost II (which I've already ordered), this
&gt; makes two reinforced snows (in the correct size) available.  Both of these
&gt; are reputed to be excellent tires.
