&gt;         So, would everyone who wants to please send me directly the year 
&gt; (and month if possible) of their vanagon wasserboxer and the mileage 
&gt; currently on the chassis. If you have had serious motor work that involved 
&gt; replacement of the engine or say pistons/main bearings, could you indicate 
&gt; the mileage when that occurred. Maybe we can figure out something regarding 
&gt; lifespans. Catastrophic failures due to total coolant or oil loss should be 
&gt; identified, since these hopefully are not normal lifespans.   Thanks, I'll 
&gt; post a summary in a couple of weeks?    tim s.

Hi,Tim--
The highest mileage Vanagon in our fleet is an '85 (auto transmission, if 
that's relavant) with 107,ooo miles. It needs the head work done now, and 
actually needed in a few thousand miles ago. Sorry this isn't too specific.

We keep this one because it's in such good overall sahape, and it's our 
only automatic (some folks need it)

All of the others have muc less mileage, and no major motor work has been 
done on any.
