&gt;My fuel pump started howling and humming today.  I called a couple of
&gt;parts places (the dealers were already closed).  $149 (on sale!) and
&gt;$199.  Can anyone tell me what the dealer price might be or if these are
&gt;the same prices others are seeing around the country.

unfortunately, that's about the going price. :(

&gt;Also, is there a chance to repair the thing, or am I out of luck?

you MIGHT be able to get it repaired at some official Bosch place, or
some local &quot;we fix anything&quot; shoppe ... but if it's howling, it's gonna
be some sort of bearings or something inside, and they'll likely only
come from Bosch. supposedly, the thing is cooled by the flow of fuel through
it, so it's not like a &quot;regular pump&quot; (that you could fix).

best to call LOTS of places for prices. especially some of those 800-numbers
on the west coast. good luck.
