&gt;&gt;Alan Funt is still alive and well in Pebble Beach and playing avid tennis
&gt;&gt;there, last I heard, by the way....
&gt;
&gt;But... does he drive a VW?????

He must, with that sense of humor!  My favorite was the partition in the
hotel, with a door marked MEN.  On the other side was a conference room
full of people, and a camera of course.  Remember one guy walking through
unzipped.
