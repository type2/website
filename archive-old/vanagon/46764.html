Subject: FS: 87 Vanagon Wolfburg Ed. in NYC

Hi,

I have to sell this Vanagon because of repeated vandalism it suffered.

Condition of ther car:

It starts and drives fine. All electrical works except the AC because of
freon leaking.

It was hitted from behind in January this year so the rear door and the rear
right side quater panel is dented. Rear pumper is also gone of course, as
also the rear hatch glass.  Otherwise it is in acceptable condition.
   
Interior is OK, the seats are in very goog shape. 

New parts put in within last year include  a rebuilt rack and pinion, whole
exhaust system (downpipe, Y connection pipe muffler everything), rebuilt
alternator, new battery etc.

Price $150. Car is located in Brooklyn, New York

The catch is, you have to tow it away because three of the tires have been
slashed.  If you have a set of spare tires, you could change it on the spot
and drive it away.

Interesting party cuold reach me at 718-372-3382  ask for Vincent,  or via
e-mail  mak9833_at_aol_dot_com 

Car has to be sold before Saturaday to avoid another parking ticket.
