Well, Steve beat me to it. :) I whole-heartedly agree with him, especially
if you live in cold Canada. Let me just add that you should test your
thermostat before hooking it back up. Drop it in boiling water and see if
it expands. (Not too sure by how much, probably around 1 inch (2.5cm).) If
not, get a new one for US$10-15.
