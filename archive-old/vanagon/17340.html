Subject: Lost Vent Window

I NEED TO VENT   - Pun Intended :)
 
I need to congratulate myself because my bus was selected to be broken into 
by some vandals, yesterday.   Even if I don't drive it stuff breaks ! :)  The 
thieves used a blunt object to break the passenger vent window and then 
reached their hand through the window to unlock the door and then preceded to 
ransack the bus of its belongings.  Strange thing is, the thieves took mostly 
mundane stuff: crappy set of ratchets and tools, tire cleaner, fix-a-flat, 
parts cleaner, a new bottle of synthetic tranny oil, Arggh!, the change in 
the ashtray and some under coating spray.  Maybe a couple of things I can't 
remember.   They left a $100 ceramic heater, a cow skin draped over the back 
seat, the case of oil under the seat, wooden chairs, didn't even touch the 
glove box.  Makes you wonder.

It is a hassle, but I live in Washington DC and therefore am aware that there 
is a greater chance of having my bus broken into.  I guess I will spend the 
half hour and hook up an alarm to the front doors with a 8 second time delay 
and a klaxon speaker.

I have already located the glass replacement I need and will pick it up 
tomorrow on the way to get a fried at the airport.

Strange thing is, my good friend Vicki had here van broken into, three days 
ago on Monday.  Weird.

Well thanks for the bandwidth and letting me vent, back to my life after I 
call the police and become a statistic.

JOHN 70 bus or actually almost a 70 bus until I fix the window and the 
tranny, but that is another story.
