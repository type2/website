Subject: Re: Slipping clutch, rookie owner

&gt; I am a new VW van owner (1973) with a slipping clutch.  I have a couple
&gt; of VW repair books and have been contemplating fixing the clutch myself.
&gt; I have a couple of questions that some of you may be able to answer and
&gt; make the job easier.
&gt;
&gt; 1.  Just because it is slipping does it need to be replaced?
&gt;
&gt; 2.  I am new to VW's and mechanics in general.  Is this too much to
&gt; attempt on a first try or is it pretty simple if you follow the manual?
&gt; I.E. is there potential to do more damage by installing a new one improperly?
&gt;
&gt; 3.  How much extra wear am I putting on the engine by drving it as is?
&gt; Lots? None?
&gt;
    1. before you buy expensive stuff make sure it's not just an adjustment
thing: check if the pedal free play is correct (i think it's supposed to be
between 1 and 3 cm, check your manual...).
    2. if correct adjustment doesn't fix it: it's a fairly simple thing to
replace it, but you need to drop the engine. the clutch is attached to the
flywheel. if you do it, replace the whole thing: clutch disc, pressure
plate, flywheel oil seal, throwout bearing, pilot shaft bearing. should cost
you about 180.- .
    3. if the clutch is really dead then i don't think you can ruin it
any more by driving it a bit longer because once you do fix it you'll
replace the whole assembly anyways. however, if it's just an adjustment
problem and the clutch disc itsself is good, then you'll wear it fast by
not adjusting it correctly.
    4. whatever you do, do it fast. you'll feel much better looking at
yourself in the mirror in the morning after you actually fixed something
(own experience !). your stomach cramps when looking at your bus will
disappear as well...it's magic...
    bus on !            gregor / 73 westy &quot;Festus&quot;
