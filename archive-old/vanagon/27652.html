Arright, Isherwood, SPILL IT!  Where?  Who?  We want names, addresses, 
phone numbers!  Where are they?  How are the prices at their yard?  Been 
there yourself?

Ya can't just tease us like this...

Maybe we could do a family picnic/part search with all the vancouver area 
list members and their families some weekend?  Sounds like a great time 
to me!
