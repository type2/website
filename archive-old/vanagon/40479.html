Subject: Two Successes in One Night!  A New Record!

Congratulations Dave! 

and may I add a big &quot;Me Too&quot;?  Yes Volks, after a couple of false starts and
new wheel bearings I have achieved mobility!  the brakes brake, the steering
steers (mostly), the wheels roll, the tranny shifts, and the engine runs.
The Monster Lives! (and well).  Sincere thanks to all of you who offered
advice on the transplant.  By my count, I saved two engine in-and-outs
directly related to advice recieved from the list.  The only major repair
left is the new axle beam (a minor bit of work {HA!}).  Anyone needing
advice on fuel-injecting a '73-'74 is now invited to apply here for advice
(worth every cent you pay) ;-).
