Subject: Re: Tools



Tool recommendation: one of those barrel shaped rechargeable electric
screwdrivers. I have a Black and Decker model and although it may seem
wimpy or toy-like, it is amazingly handy for: sheet metal screws, interior
fittings screws, screws in tight places where you can just barely reach
never mind twist your wrist, hose clamps in similar tight spots.
They really are timesavers.
