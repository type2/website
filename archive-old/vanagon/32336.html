Subject:       '72  c.v. joints

Hello all.  
    over the holidays I got my lower ball joints replaced.  wuerths 
automotive repair took care of the job for $150, half the price of 
anywhere else i checked.  if anyone needs a good mechanic located in 
romulus mich. let me know and i will send you more info.
    on the way to get the ball joints replaced i began hearing a 
nasty bangy ratchety cluncky sound.  it goes away and usually only 
lasts a few moments but I suppose it is time to learn how to do 
c.v.'s.  The problem joint is the outer on the drivers side.  when 
the bus is in the air with that particular wheel being rotated you 
can see a distinct point in the rotation where the shaft lifts 
straight up and then back down into place.  can anyone tell me what 
happened, where to find info on how to do it (ie. where to find a 
hoover sermon), how much parts should cost, and whatever other 
information a newby to c.v.'s should know?
thanks in advance.
Ed.
