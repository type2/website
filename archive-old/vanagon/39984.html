Tom,

I looked at your number again and now have a definitive answer for 
you.

You have a 1964.  Your VIN number is 1 308 189.  The 1964 model 
year started with VIN number 1 144 282 and the 1965 model year 
used the new numbering system starting with 215 000 001.

Also, the Turquoise and Blue-White scheme was only used from 
1961-1964.

Hope you are satisfied with this answer.  I am 99% sure it is 
correct.

Dave

&gt;Dave is talking about http://www.mindspring_dot_com/~deasterw/neato.html
&gt;I had used that site to decode the optional equipment and paint codes,
&gt;and to confirm that the first three digits of the VIN indicated it was
&gt;a Standard Microbus, RH Cargo Doors, LH Drive, so a big thanks to Dave 
&gt;Easterwood and the rest of NEATO. But there is no build sequence or
&gt;year of manufacture data.
