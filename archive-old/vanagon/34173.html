Subject: Programmable EV Wipers, EV news, etc....

Ok, here's the scoop on the EV programmable windshield wipers. The GLs and 
MV versions of the EV SHOULD have programmable wipers. However, if you have 
an early EV (the serial number on mine ends in 001948), then you probably
won't have the programmable feature. Mine did not come with it....however,
I showed the dealer the catalogue and they gave me a new wiper relay
free of charge.

If you don't have the programmable feature, its just a matter of getting
the wiper relay from a Golf /// GTI, a Passat or later Eurovan...removing
the old relay and putting the new one in. It should cost about $15.

To see if you have it....turn your wiper on to &quot;delay&quot;, then turn off
the wipers, count to ten, and turn them back onto delay. Your wiper
should sweep every 10 seconds. Turn them off again, wait 2 seconds,
and your wiper should sweep every 2 seconds. 

As I recall, you should be able to program the sweep from 1 second
to 90 second intervals.


No on to the news....

We weren't able to get a T4 from the rental agencey...instead we
had a Peugeot 806 minivan, about the size of a Chrysler $hitbox. It was 
nice, handled well. Could carry 8 passengers. It had sliding doors on
both sides (pre-dating Chrysler by 2 years....), the rear seats, both
front and rear could be moved back and forth, or the middle could
be flipped around to face the rear. Each section of the seat could be
folded down separately....The shift (it was a 5 speed...something you can't 
get in a $hitbox) came out thru the dash and was perfectly placed
at hand level.

Why the discourse? Well, I saw a Sharan at the VW dealer in Grenoble...
bottom line, if you removed the badging from the Peugeot (and incidentally
Lancia and Fiat which share the same body....but use their own mfg's 
engines) and the Sharan and put them side by side....its hard to find
any differences. I was not too impressed.....the Sharan seemed to be
cut from &quot;generic-mini-van-cloth&quot;. The one in the showroom was
150,000FF....or about $30K....UGH!

In the dealer's lot was a 96MV...with a 2.4 diesel! From what I recall, the 
MV was originally a 2.5 gas engine only van. I managed to get a rear fog 
light for the MV. It mounts in the &quot;square&quot; on the bumper ends....and I bet 
most of you thought those &quot;squares&quot; pressed into the bumper ends were VW's 
attempt to be &quot;artsy&quot;!  8)

Unfortunately, VW of France (as with VW US) doesn't have much of an 
accessory listing for the T4, so I was not able to get any ventshades. At 
one time, VW of France sold a &quot;console&quot; which mounted on top of the dash. It 
could hold cassettes, cans of soda, pens, etc. However, VW had to stop 
selling them in France because of the danger of flying objects (at face 
level) should the van come to a quick stop.

Speaking of cassettes, Shell stations were selling music cassettes (or K7s 
(Kay Septs) in french)...one of which was called &quot;Slow Forever&quot;...it 
contained music which I recall made excellent &quot;parking&quot; mood music  8)..on 
the cover of the cassette (also available in CD) was a rear shot of a 
split-window bug...and thru the split windows you could make out..or should 
I say see a couple making out....Naturally I had to buy the cassette for the
picture! Hmmmmmm....I used to use a similar logic when I bought Playboy...I 
had to buy them for the articles!!  ;-)

There's probably more stuff to tell you about the trip...but I'm still 
(after 5 days) re-adjusting to US time (been up since 5am)
....its time for coffee!!!
