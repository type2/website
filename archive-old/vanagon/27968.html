&gt;&gt; he could hear voices, seemingly a chorus. There was John Lennon,
&gt;&gt; Jim Croche, Janice Joplin, James Brown, Elvis, Ricky Nelson
&gt;&gt; and Jackie Wilson.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;Uh, I hate to be a nitpick, but please, James Brown's not dead yet! (I'm
&gt;not sure about Ricky Nelson...)

I'm sure Elvis is NOT DEAD.  I saw him in the supermarket just yesterday,
arms piled high with Ring dings..
