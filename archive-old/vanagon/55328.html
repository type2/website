Subject: EV piston slap - how noticeable?

Say,

Y'know, I've got a 93 EV, and I'm just about certain it's *never*
made the noises that've been described in this list as symptomatic
of EV piston slap.  

My previous two cars were both VW diesels, a rabbit and then a Jetta,
so I know and love that very, very distinctive sound.  Nope, if we're
talking about something that's *anything* like diesel clatter, I don't
think my EV's ever done that.  

How many of 'em did?  A lot?  Most?  Mine's got almost 78,000 miles 
on it.  If it had been slapping without me noticing it all this time,
would it have blown up by now?  What happens?

How noticable is it?  Mine has always impressed me for its 
smoothness -  even when cold.  It just starts &amp; runs smoothly.

Somebody wrote that their dealer confirmed it with a stethoscope.
Is that what we're talking about?

Thanks -
