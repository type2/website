Subject: Cooling System Flushing and Plastic Parts


On Wed, 2 Aug 1995, Jim Arnott asked about those Prestone cooling 
system flushing adapters on a Wasserboxer...

On the same day Tim Smith said &quot;DON'T DO IT!  The heat in the engine 
compartment is high...&quot;, which is true... so mount the adapter away
from the engine compartment...

I had to replaced my coolant level sensor and the expansion tank 
that the sensor is mounted in. These plastic parts had dried out from
the high heat in the engine compartment. The top of the sensor broke
off from it's base and the tank had cracks in it. The sensor cost $7.00
and the tank, at the dealer, was $50.00 8-O... Joel has informed me
that this is common and happens every 40K miles or so...

The gist of all of this is keep an eye one those plastic parts in the
cooling system, they just don't hold up to the heat.
