Don Gibbons answers to my questions are below. 

Thanks Don, I appreciate the info on the head gaskets. While the air 
conditioner is wonderful, I have been careful to turn it down or off if 
the temperature gauge moves above the indicator light. I have even turned 
the heater on when I was in bumper to bumper traffic to keep the temp 
indicator near the light and not above it. Am I being too cautious? The 
fellow I bought it from recommended doing this to keep it cool. 

Thanks again.

&gt;Hi, welcome to the list.
&gt;1. I may have started this thread about hi temps and head gasket problems.
&gt;The water jacket gasket is made of a rubberlike material and as such will go
&gt;bad the higher temp it is exposed to. Anything that keeps the gasket temp
&gt;down will make it last longer. I sugested a coolant re-circulation pump as
&gt;are on some recent VW's. Other then changing the coolant and making sure
&gt;that it does not get low there is nothing that can be done to help gasket
&gt;life (short of getting the gasket temp down)
&gt;
&gt;2. Only a little high. If you walked into a VW dealer and asked that the
&gt;entire system from heads to tail pipe be replaced the bill would come to
&gt;three digits (yes maybe $3,000) All is not so dim. The after market has all
&gt;parts at a fraction of the dealer price. I did my syncro (most of the parts)
&gt;for less then $600. But keep in mind that the factory parts are very good
&gt;and last a long time
&gt;
&gt;3. The best site is the list and its archives.
&gt;
&gt;4. I had a 82 that was not very good in the snow depending on how loaded it
&gt;was. With empty it was OK. With a full load (lots in front) it was not very
&gt;good. After that I had a 87 syncro (so maybe I am spoiled) with 4 snow tires
&gt;that went thru anything. Studed tires are best in bad conditions and should
&gt;get you thru most winters.
