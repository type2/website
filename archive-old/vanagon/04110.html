&gt; DC:  a person of mass is a fatso, yes.  I thought maybe I could
&gt; use that term on Steve, since he described eating, drinking,
&gt; and sleeping thru most of his vacation, while his poor
&gt; gyno-companion had to drive and drive and drive !  Perhaps
&gt; I should have used a nicer term:  metabolically challenged?
&gt; alternative body image?  motivationally deficient?  metaphysically
&gt; different?  cosmetically oppressed?   ;)

What!!! I did most of the driving!!!!! Sheesh I mention a couple
of trade offs and I'm called a fatso?  I drove from Florence OR to
Redding (Remember that place Martha?) in about 10 hours and then
Linda drove 2 hours home.  Hmmmf!  Anyway Martha, you really need
to put that Theasaurus down and pick up a Bently instead. ;)
