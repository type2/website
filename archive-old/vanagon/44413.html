&gt;Hey everyone, i just noticed that when i turn my blinker to the right it

The blink rate is determined by the amount of resistance the lamps present to
the circuit.  In a two-lamp circuit when a lamp burns out, as one of yours
has apparently done, the blink rate effectively doubles.  If you have a short
in the system the blink rate will be zero (ie, maximum resistance).  If both
bulbs burn out or are disconnected, the blink rate will be one lonely click.

Trucks, RV's and other vehicles with large numbers of blinkers normally use
the blinker to trigger a relay so the blink rate remains the same no matter
how many lamps are in the circuit.  A ballast resister across the blinker
allows the blink rate to be adjusted.

With a two-lamp circui, as is common on passenger vehicles, the sound of the
blinker tells you if all of the lamps are operating.  With relay-driven
circuits multiple lamps are used on each 'corner' of the vehicle so at least
one will always be operating.  A visual inspection is required to tell if a
lamp has burned out.
