&gt; Has anyone actually installed the Optima &quot;bullet poof&quot; battery.....  the one
&gt; that uses coiled cells??
&gt; 
&gt; Upon preliminary measurements, looks like it is too tall to mount upright,
&gt; but could possibly be mounted on it's side using the side terminals.  Also
&gt; looks like there is a need to cut the top terminals off to prevent shorts to
&gt; the body while the battery is on it's side.
&gt; 
&gt; This configuration looks like it will work as long as you do not use regular
&gt; battery cables with the thick terminal ends as they will again protrude too
&gt; high.....   Is this confusing or what??
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway,  I'd like to use this type of &quot;dry&quot; battery to power all the
&gt; accessories in my '87 Syncro Westy.  Also, it would lessen the chance of
&gt; someone drilling through the battery to drain the acid to kill my alarm
&gt; system.
&gt; 
&gt; The batteries are expensive, but so is my stereo and Syncro!
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,  Curt Long

I see Optima has a deep cycle battery as well as their 800 amp standard
battery.
