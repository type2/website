Subject: engine swap \ oil cooler \ 73 bus.


 i just read in muir's that he suggests replacing the oil cooler every &gt; time you pull the engine - any opinions on that ? that's a spendy part, 144.-
&gt;  at busstop. or are there cheaper sources ? someone on the list suggested
&gt; blowing it out with compressed air and reusing it. seems more reasonable to
&gt; me. what do i look for in a visual inspection?
&gt;     bus on,
&gt;             gregor \ 73 westy &quot;FESTUS&quot;
