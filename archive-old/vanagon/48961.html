&gt; HI:
 There is a 17mm Allen style plug on the side of your trans up by the gear
section. Pull that plug out and the fluid level should be so that it level
with the bottom of the plug hole. It is nice to have a small pump to pump
the oil up into the trans through a hose altough it is possible to use a
squeeze bottle like the one that Valvoline gear lube comes in. I was just
thinking that Mercrusier sells a little pump for about $6 or $8 dollars that
would work nicely. I just bought one to put lube in my boat outdrive. You
should be able to find them at any boat store.
 I recently had my Syncro trans rebuilt and put VW synthetic oil in it
(17.50 per liter). It is very light oil and I am very pleased with the
shifting performance it now has. I suppose a lot has to do with the rebuild.
I read in Bently that if you just change the fluid you need about a liter
less oil wich means that a liter stays in the tranny. Did the factory put
synthetic in the tranny originally or did they put in dinosaur? If they did
put in dinosaur will the liter left over mix and work well with the synthetic
