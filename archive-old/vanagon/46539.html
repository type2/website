	Tim,
	Having the dual Kaldrons melted down to puddles of aluminum 
sounds like a very hot gasoline fire. I'm very glad you and yours are ok.

	Someone suggested asking the local fire department for help
in figuring out how the fire started, and that might be a good idea if
you contemplate putting the same arangement into your next bus!

	I often *hate* learning experiences.

	Bill
