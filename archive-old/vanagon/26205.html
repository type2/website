&gt; &gt; Does fuel injection protect against this type of fire? (no carb, fuel 
&gt; &gt; lines configured differently)
&gt; 
&gt; My uncle haa a 76 that sprung a leak in the little hose that conects the 
&gt; injectors to the fuel line, be sure they are in good condition.
&gt; 
Likewise remember the fuel line still passes though a rubber grommet
in the firewall, not an exactly thrilling solution.   Depending on
year either a rubber hose goes though or the steel ring main goes
through the firewall, either way potentila trouble, keep an eye
on all lines on the f.i. engines, particularly the ones above the
heater flapper box oultets, the ones to the injectors seem to last
better actually, particularly '77 and '78 with rubber covered pressure
hose not the cloth covered stuff.  For that matter, I vaguely recall
Porsche issuing a recall on the 914 where all the cloth covered hose was
replacd by the higher quality (and price) pressure hose, I reccomend
it for all Bus f.i. hose work, the best source AUTOMOTION porshe parts
people, goes like $12 a meter to the cloth covered $8 or so.
Mind you the cloth covered is still infinitely superior to any
parts store product.
