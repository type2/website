Subject: Re: Heading to Colo. TRAILER TALES

-- [ From:  * EMC.Ver #2.3 ] --

Doc,

We drive an 84 Westy, 157,000 miles on spedo, original engine.  About 30,
000 recent miles towing.

We pull a Coleman Versatrailer with a Fibreglas top (150 pound tongue
weight, 900 pound capacity) all over the country, including the Rockies of
Colorado and 10,000' Bear Tooth Pass in Wyoming.

The hitch is a Valley item, class ONE, if I remember correctly, obtained
and installed at Pep Boys for about $145.00  It mounts inside the bumper
and requires two 1/4&quot; cuts of the bumper on the bottom side.  Cosmetically
it is OK.

The essential part is to make sure that you mount the trailer to a bar
attached to the structure of the vehicle.  The bumper is too fragile to
bear the weight and trauma of an attachment to the bumper.

Anticipate lots of slow driving, uphill, in low gear, too. Spare the
brakes.  Give yourself lots of time on your travel schedule.

Best regards, 

Tom Hanlon
Palm Springs, CA
