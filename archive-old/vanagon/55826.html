Subject: RE: Needed - EV Oil Filters

Ric sez:

&gt;The oil filter is in a real tight place,
&gt;and it does not appear that the =
&gt;usual slip wrench would fit into the area.

It is indeed snug, but you *can* use a 
conventional oil wrench to loosen the filter.

The only caveat to that is that you cannot
be someone with monstrously big hands, but
hey, that's not my problem...  ;)

Personally, if I had the gumption, I'd get
a sandwich plate/adapter and move the damn
filter location to somewhere where I don't 
have to remove the %$#_at_! engine cover every
time I change the oil!
