Subject: Re: BLOWN HEAD GASKET....HOW MUCH $$??



&gt;Does any one know the cost of new head gaskets ....
&gt;also if I bring it into a shop what is a usual cost to replace the
&gt;gaskets?

I've seen a wide range of prices on head gasket kits, even as high as $150 
per side, especially if the garage is selling you the parts. If you can't 
find a good price locally, I could get them for you for $65 per side 
(German).  An decent price for labor might be $300-$400.

Replacing the water pump also wouldn't be a bad idea while the motor's 
apart, if it hasn't been done before (easy to do while the motor's apart, 
more difficult later).  Also, it is possible to do a head gasket job with 
the motor in the van, or by removing it.  My mechanic prefers to do it with 
the motor out. He says that since the job goes quicker once the motor is 
out, it almost offsets the extra time required to pull the motor, and it 
affords the opportunity to inspect the clutch, etc. in the process.
