Subject: '56 bus starting problem - solved???

Ok, remember the problem with trying to start the '56?  First it was just
slow turning, so I replaced the battery and tightened everything up, and it
changed to just clicking and not turning over.  It worked prolly 50-75% of
the time, which wasn't good enuf.  I replaced the ignition switch, which
didn't do squat.  At first whacking on the starter worked, but even that
stopped working.

So today I replaced the starter.  Seems to have fixed the problem, but we've
heard that before.  The other one was just over a year old.  I don't think
they really &quot;rebuild&quot; them - I think they clean 'em up and repain them.  The
starter s'posedly has a lifetime warranty, so we'll see.  I can replace a
starter in about 15-20 mintues, so I guess thats not _too_ bad, but I'd
rather not do it...
