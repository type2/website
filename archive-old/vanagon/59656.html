Subject: Big-O Hercules on SyncroWesty?

Big-O Tires has a Hercules 195/75/14 Load Range D tyre for $51.
This would save $150 over the cost of Yokohama Y370's and almost 50% on 
the MXT's.

Does anyone know of anyone who has used this tyre on a Syncro Westy or 
any truck? 
With what results?

TIA 	Joe
