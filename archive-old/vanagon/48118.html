You know, I'd almost swear I've run across another kind of LED--one with
only two leads that emits red if you run it one way, yellow if you run it
the other. But this seems a little impossible, if I'm to believe the folks
who've been talking about LEDs the last week or so, who I think have said
LEDs will only go one way...Maybe it was all a dream...Auntie Em! Auntie Em!
