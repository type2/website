Subject: South SF Repair shop

Hi kids,

I just saw the following repair shop review on the Porsche list, and thought 
some folks might be interested in it. I personally have never heard of this 
shop, but its not exactly in my neck of the woods either. For all I know the 
reviewer is one of the owners....

FWIW,

Erik

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Forwarded note follows....

  I've found a repair shop where the proprietors are HONEST, FAIR, and 
SKILLED at VW Type IV repair and diagnostics.

GANDALF'S GARAGE, 
Specializes in VW Vanagon, Transporter, and Type IV
1681 C &amp; D Old Mission Road
South San Francisco, CA 94080
(415) 755-2580

Rodrigo and Gretchen Castano, Proprietors

A friendly and warm couple, shop is very busy, mostly of course VW Vans &amp; 
Vanagons and all the older watercooled cars.
    Rodrigo was able to accurately diagnose my COLD &amp; WARM MISS problems 
as an ECU that had failed on 1 of the 2 Injector Trigger Channels.    He 
confirmed my deductions that my trigger points, grounds, harness and 
temperature sensors were all O.K..   I felt good about this since I had 
systematically followed the 914 Fan Web guide on Bosch-D Fuel Injection 
and ended up concluding that the ECU was only bad element.  Sure enough, 
switching only the ECU instantly cured the MISS problem...hooray!

 GANDALF's did not try to mark up parts, or charge for misdirected labor 
(they eat there own mistakes).  GANDALF9s does not try to 3stick2 you 
just cause the label on the outside says 3Porsche2, they charge VW 
prices for VW work.

  Gretchen Castano runs the front office and is very knowledgeable about 
automotive repairs and VW9s herself.  Gretchen is totally fun to talk 
with especially if you are an old VW fan.  In her native Nicaragua, NEW 
BRAZILIAN-made Beetles and COMBIS are the backbone of transportation.   
Gretchen had me drooling over the prospect of taking a container full of 
very young (or even new) VW models home that haven9t been available in 
the U.S. for at least 20 years!

GANDALF's is very very busy, so there is some wait in getting repairs, 
but I'm very satisfied.  

you will be too!  very nice people
