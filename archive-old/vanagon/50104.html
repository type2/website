&gt;Subject: Fresh Air Leaks in Vanagons
&gt;
&gt;Of the people who responding to my informal poll if they were able to shut
off fresh air supply--12 people said they could not shut the supply off--3
persons e-mailed claiming they had no problem.
&gt;
&gt;Later in the winter, I'll pull the dashboard out and find out why--also to
find out why my fan emits a high pitched sqeak.  Meanwhile, it's getting
chilly here in Atlanta and it's time to pull the foam rubber out of the
intake and retire the AC for the winter (except for running a few minutes
once a week to keep it lubed).
