Bob,
I couldn't agree with you more. If you have been following my posts 
 about my 78 &quot;Lima Bean&quot; you will see my frustration in dealing with 
 the later motor.  I am not sure but I don't think your 72 has the top 
 hatch, it makes a big difference, you can reach the plugs with ease. I 
 am thinking about buying a 72 because the green thing is such a 
 tremendous piece of kaka. If that happens I plan on ripping everything 
 I can use in the future off of it and selling the carcass to a 
 cruncher, but before I do I am going to cut out the hatch and figure 
 out how to weld it in the 72. I guess the good news is that the type 
 IV is a lot better on the inside.

Keep up the goos will,
Clay
