Well... not really. My 1985 VW Vanagon GL Westfalia Camper (are ya still with
me?) is in fact, a GL. It also has cloth seats, arm rests that fold up (part
of seat), a jump seat (to those of you that have been asking I'm not sure what
I'm doing with it yet), and a large rubberized mat for the middle area that is
the same carpet as the entire interior.
