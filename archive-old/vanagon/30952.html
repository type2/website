There's a first cut of Demented Dworkin's Used Bus Bits at:

	http://www.village_dot_org/vw/parts

The data's pretty slim right now, as there are only entries from
Martha, William Abbott, and myself.  As a result, the number of things
you can search on is small, also.  As new entries get added, the
search keys in the subsididary pages are automatically updated, so
they'll grow over time.  It'll make more sense once you actually poke
around a bit.

Constructive criticism would be extremely helpful, as I'm not really
good at web page design.
