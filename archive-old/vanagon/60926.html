No, not my Vanagon :-)

At the local dealer here in Johnson City, TN (Sherwood Nissan/VW), I
noticed today an '87 Vanagon for sale.  It's dark blue w/ a gray stripe and
has the alloy wheels.  All the windows are tinted, and it even has Joel's
favorite tint strip at the top of the winshield.  I didn't see any rust
when driving by but I can give it a closer look if anyone is interested.  I
have no idea about selling price or engine condition, but again, I can find
out if anyone's interested.  Likewise, if anyone wants to find out for him
or herself, I can give you the phone number of the dealer.

Johnson City, TN is located in northeastern Tennessee, about half an hour's
drive from the VA/TN border.

Sean
