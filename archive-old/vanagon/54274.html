Subject: Re: Brake Bleeding, here I go again

&gt; Well, with my record intact and my sanity not, I shall venture forth 
&gt; this weekend to again bleed my brake system.  We shall see if the 
&gt; advice from various listees shall penetrate my skull and result in a 
&gt; successful bleed job (of which I have had 100% failure).  I have 
&gt; gotten used to spongy brakes over the years, obviously.
I just did my Jetta, which has never given me trouble with spongy 
feel, but here's what I did:

-Work from farthest wheel: R rear, L rear, R front, L front.
-Attach tube to valve. Open ~ 1/2 turn or less.
-Begin pumping until res. is almost empty. Fill with new DOT4.
-Continue pumping slowly until new clear fluid appears.
-Slowly close valve while pumping.
-wait a minute or so, then open valve slightly &amp; pump 1-2 times more 
until air bubbles go away. (letting it rest seems to let the air 
collect together again, if there's any left).
-move to next wheel.
-My Jetta used close to one litre to flush the system.
-Avoid opening valve too much. If it wobbles in the threads 
(tapered?), it seems to left air IN, while the fluid is going out.

I plan to do the Westy soon; hopefully the same process will work... 
:)
