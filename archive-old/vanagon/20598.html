&gt;I noticed my shift coupler was in bad shape.  Maybe thats why it likes

I've been doing a little preventive maint on my '73 (lubrication, cv joints, 
wheelwell undercoating) and I thought that since it shifts like rowing a 
boat, I would replace the shift coupler.  I thought that might help a lot.  
I went to the local FLAPS and he recommended the urethane shift coupler set 
(with new cage) - said it lasts longer, less play, etc.  Same price as 
stock.  I got it and installed it.

I must add that as part of the R&amp;R I replaced my extractor system with a 
type 4 muffler, and after 5 years it is very nice to have quiet.  But, I 
knew I had more, different noise on the first test drive.  There was a lot 
of transmission noise.

Well, long story short, my trans has almost 130k on it and the gears are 
making some noise now.  I went back and bought the stock rubber coupler set 
and that fixed the additional noise problem.  The bus is quieter inside than 
it has been for years.  And I guess the stock isn't so bad - the first ones 
lasted for 22 years.
