Subject: David Schwarze's site


Hi all,
I've been poking around in David Schwarze's Web Site, down loading various
pictures and stuff (Making myself envious of the various west coast van 
trips).  Any way, I grabbed a bunch of pictures, and the first 
Martha_stuck.mpg.
The pictures all turned out well on my gif/jpg viewer, but the mpg was
impossible to watch, jumping and thrashing all about.  It was my first
time using the mpg viewer, so I don't know if it is my software or the
file. (or if it got corrupted in downloading).  Has anybody else had
any trouble with this file?  Has anybody else downloaded it?

Gerry, If this is the wrong place to ask these questions, sorry, please
don't boot me off.  :)

Schwarzie, has anybody else mentioned problems with the mpeg?

Thanks all.


Cheers
