&gt; &gt; Hi all:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Can anyone tell me how old a vehicle in California has to be in order to
&gt; &gt; be exempt from auto emission testing.  I've been told &quot;20 years old&quot; and
&gt; &gt; I've also been told &quot;1966 and newer&quot; are tested.  Does anybody know for
&gt; &gt; sure?  Has this changed recently?
&gt; 
&gt; As it stands today, 1966 and newer is correct.  Quentin Kopp has
&gt; introduced legislation to have the exemption date &quot;rolling.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; Excellent, I wish him the best of luck in getting it through. That's what we are working for here in Washington. Thanks for the info.   Todd
