Subject: '71 rebuild questions


Greetings friends!

No, I don't have 71 questions; I have a couple about a '71!

I'm doing pretty good on my rebuild; things were going
pretty smoothly, until last night.  I did the classic
'drop the nut into the case' thing!  The engine is nearly
complete, I'm adding the externals and tin.  The only opening
to the inside is where the fuel pump goes, and of course,
that's exactly where I dropped the nut!  Now, I can see the
darn thing resting on the distributer drive shaft, but on
either side it's a long drop to the depths of the case.
I plan on using a magnetic extractor (I don't have one,
believe it or not), but in case it falls, what are my
chances that I'll be able to fish it out of there (maybe
through the oil screen opening?), without having to open
the case again?

Also, when I positioned the distributer drive shaft, I
didn't get it exactly in the same place that it was when
I removed it, and the result is that when the number 1 cylinder
is at top dead center, the rotor points roughly perpendicular
to the case parting line.  This shouldn't matter, right?
Alls it means is that I'll have to rotate the distributer
to a slightly different orientation, right?

Thanks, all!
