&gt; Hi David.  I believe that nobody pays much attention to front plates 
&gt; anymore.  However, I think that you  only have to display a front 
&gt; plate if the place of registration requires one.  ie. BC vehicles 
&gt; require front plates, and if you are missing it, you can get a ticket 
&gt; if the police are bored.  If an Alberta vehicle, which doesn't 
&gt; require a front plate, is LEGAL in BC since the origin 
&gt; of registration doesn't require it.

Thanks for all of the replies.  California *does* require two plates, but
in the past I have driven with only one.  I did get hassled at the Calif -
Arizona border once for not having two plates.  I was mainly concerned that
I would get to the Canadian border and they would turn me around cause I
only had one plate.  That would throw a huge monkey wrench into GNATT!  But
since I am not entering Canada in BC, it looks like I will probably be ok.
Which is good, since there is no way for me to get a replacement plate in
one week.  *whew!*
