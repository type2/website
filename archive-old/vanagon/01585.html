Subject: Owner's Manual for '73 Westphalia?

Does anyone have an owner's manual for a '73 westphalia they would be
willing to photocopy for me?
The utility of some of the contols still eludes me.  For example, there is
a round knurled knob on the center of the front seat frame (drivers side
only) that seems to tighten a rod against the back of the seat frame, but
which seems to have no effect.  Also, there is a knob on the floor of the
bus, next to the front right corner of the driver's seat.  This knob is
connected to a (sticky) bowden cable that runs through the floor of the
van.  Is this some sort of heater/fresh air control?  At first I thought it
might be a manual choke, but the van has an automatic choke, so it isn't.
