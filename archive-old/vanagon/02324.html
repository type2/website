Subject: 1977 VW bus needs home

Howdy there,
  I have a 1977 VW bus, green with a white top.  It is in decent condition,
no major rust, transmission ok etc.  The engine is in real good condition
except for the little fact of a blown oil cooler.  This would be a good car
for a first time restore-er.  I have the bible of VW repair called &quot;How
to keep your Volkswagon alive for the complete Idiot&quot; which walks you
through every major or minor procedure you can think of, including replacing
the oil cooler.  Unfortunately this involves removing the engine, and since
I have another car, this is not a real heavy priority.  Now here's the
kicker, this car is going to be towed to the junk yard tommorrow! (Tues 7/26)
I would rather it went to a good home, but alas, work and the prejiduces of
the Champaign city police would have it otherwise! ;)  Therefore I
am offering this car to anybody willing to pay for the towing, before
tommorrow morning!  (ie all you have to pay for is the towing, the car
is free)  If you are interested, please call (217)355-6536 or send email to
this address (ap10655_at_coewl.cen.uiuc_dot_edu) ASAP!!!

PS. You must have real good karma to work with this vechicle and it doesn't
    like bad thoughts.  Seriously.

PSS.  1977 VW bus 2000cc 4cyl fuel-injected pancake engine,
       generally driven on 800 mile trip (one way) from illinois to VA
 (4 times, ie 4x1600 miles), my family has had it for 10 years.  200K+ miles
       I had left it for 4 weeks in Chicago over Christmas and then
       drove it 2.5 hours down to school.  The oil cooler let go the day
        I got back, I think that the disgustingly cold weather then the
        sudden drive then more cold did her in.  I am fairly certain that
        it is the oil cooler since that is what a VW engineer told me and he
        sounded dead certain.
