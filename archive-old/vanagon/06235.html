Subject: rain and slow leaks

speaking of rain, i just discovered my Vanagon has some kind of leak in the
front. I have it parked on a *slight* incline (my driveway) facing uphill,
and I found water on the driver's side after a day of rain. I mopped that
up, couldn't find where it came from, so I turned it around and parked it
facing downhill.
(This trick worked on our 76 Rabbit so what the hell...)
 But now I found a (smaller) puddle on the passenger side. There seems to
be a slight dampness on the metal behind/under the dash but I can't see any
definite traces. Whaddaya think? windshield seal? door seal? top seal?
(it's a 1980 VSI conversion.)
Maybe I'll sit out  the next storm in it and watch for dripping:-)

Later,
Rick
