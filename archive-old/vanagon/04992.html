Subject: RE: 6-ply tires???

&gt;By the way, my first driving impressions of the tires are not good.  When
&gt;I swerve the bus, it feels like the back end is floating on tapioca, and
&gt;it is very unstable in crosswinds.

&gt;Thanks for any help,
&gt;	-David

Which Trailhandlers did you get? There are several different models
available. I bought the Trailhandler APTs for my 87 Syncro and am quite
pleased with them. They are a load range C tire and for me there was a
dramatic decrease in the type of behavior you are describing when I
installed them in place of the non-reinforced Tirestone all-season radials
that were mounted when I purchased it.

One thing to check. The Sears guys inflated my tires to 30 PSI all around,
rather than to the manual's specifications.
