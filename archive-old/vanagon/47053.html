 So, I desperately need advice on verifying this. Did I forget anything? 
 Should I recheck? A second opinion? A local vw specialist (not a 
 dealer) said it would run about $1000 :( I've never done any kind of 
 repair to this scale but I'm not afraid to learn and try. Should I be? 
 I've printed all the applicable articles from the archive, got my 
 Bentley. Anything else? Any advice or opinions would be greatly 
 appreciated!

If engine is overheating with fan not turning on, the cause is usually a flow
problem.  The Radiator has both inlet and outlets side by side.  Frequently,
the housing will crack internall allowint the coolant to flow from the inlet
and back to the outlet.  This is especially a prblem at low speeds since the
water pump is not pumping water fast enough to gat any water to flow through
the Radiator.  To inspect, drain the system and remove the 2 radiator hoses.
 Look up and or feel with a long screwdriver if there are any internal
cracks.  Look real close because the crack is small when cold but it will
expand when heated.  I usually can not see the crack unless I remove the
Radiator and get a light shined in there.  It is usually hard to see.  So
look very carefully.
