Subject: 86' stalling/mechanic problems
Date: Thu, 7 Nov 1996 11:49:32 -0500 (EST)

I have recently had a lot of work done on my 86' including a
rebuilt engine from AVP, new clutch, and new idle stabilizer.
Recently i took the van back in because of the following:
with the ac on, the idle is very high and the idle stabilizer
stays on.
This problem is quite mysterious to me, but I think this is
definitely something that should be covered under my 90 days
parts and labor warranty.  My mechanic does not seem to agree
with me.  In any case, if there is something wrong with the ac
unit, it is soemthing they did reassembling the engine
as it worked fine before having the rebuilt engine put in.  
My mechanics solution to the problem of the high idle was to
keep the ac off and re-adjust the idle.  Now the engine stalls
when cold and the idle searches a little, but is fine and
smooth when warm.  Is this a sign of a vacuum leak, or can this
be linked to the idle stab.??  To top it all off, i just
realized that my back-up lights are not working, and it is not
the fuse or the lamps.  
	I think that i need to make a list of things that are
obviously done half-ass and go threaten my mechanic.  The
problem is that i am not sure that I have the expertise to
recognize all of these things. If there is anyone in the 100
mile radius, ie. D.C , Richmond, BLacksburg, Roanoak or
possibly further that could help me locate and distinguish
these problems i would greatly appreciate it.  I think that my
mechanic is trying to take advantage of me b/c I am a 24 year
old out of state grad student in a predominantly college town.  
Thanks in advance for any help/advice.
