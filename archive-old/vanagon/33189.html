        Definately installing the engine and air-cleaner support before
getting that primary wire grommet (battery + to starter solenoid)
squared away counts for me. I didn't remove the engine, but did have
to disconnect all the wires and remove the air-cleaner support to get
the grommet installed.

        But my personal 'best' so far is all that work to get
my heater box flap levers on the inside, including buying a second
set of heater boxes and fabricating parts and having them welded,
and purchasing the extra lever kit and everything, only to discover
that the operating cables are on the OUTSIDE and the extra levers have
no function. No excuse. I did the work 25 feet from the bus.

        Then there was my brother's friend who bought a sunroof
breadloaf, took it home, washed it, cranked back the roof and
went for a drive. The sunroof drain pipes were all jammed full
of dust and corruption, and at the first vigorous stop, several
gallons of really icky water sloshed out of the the recess where
the sunroof is and splattered both front seat passengers...
