&gt;Does any list member know where one can rent a Westy or Eurovan Camper in 
&gt;the Twin Cities area?  We'll be visiting the end of July and would like to 
&gt;tour the state.  I already tried the Minnesota web page and found nothing,
&gt;so additional leads would be most welcome.

&gt;
A quick check with the three major VW dealers in the area (Burnsville VW,
Westside VW, and Countryside VW) found that no one there knows of anyone
renting VW campers.  BVW said they were down to two campers for sale and that
they would get no more for the rest of the year.  Two (WVW and CVW) said that
they get asked this question a lot.  Might be a good business to start around
here, renting VW campers!
