&gt;A few days ago I noticed a collection of tiny wet spots on the driveway
&gt;where I park my 91 Vanagon MV.  So I look underneath and sure enough there
&gt;appears to be a drop of coolant dangling from the right cylinder head area.
&gt;What is the diagnosis??  Head gasket?

first thing, look at the little hose that goes between the power steering
belt, on the back (bumper) end of the engine. there is a little flange
on the engine that the hose connects to. look carefully and see if that
flange is leaking. it is prone to do so, and the coolant leaks down and
gets on the bottom of the engine, looking like the head is leaking.

&gt;If it is a head gasket, are we talking big bucks??

if it IS the head gasket, yeah. fraid so. :(  if it's the flange, you're
looking at, oh, $20?? pray for the flange!    good luck.
