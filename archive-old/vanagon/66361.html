Subject:      Propex heater

With regards to the Propex heater, can it be operated while the vehicle
is in motion?  Does air ever come in the vent pipe and blow the furnace
out?
You guys are making the Propex sound like THE heat solution for an
air-cooled van.  Now the question is, where can I get one?  Does anyone
have one for sale (in the U.S.)?  Are there any out there interested in
making a group purchase?  Ron at the Bus Depot, are you interested?
Winter is coming on and the BaseCamp needs a heater!
