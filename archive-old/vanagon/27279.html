Subject: Re: Gas Heater for Sale!!!

Jeezus,  I can see why Ark Mirvis is in business, hold those calls folks.
I'll testfire the heater this coming weekend.  If it emits heat/hot air and
cycles on/off correctly several times I'll sell it as a gas heater.  If it
emits 10 foot long belches of flame and raw gasoline it will be sold as an
'anti-tailgating device',  just tell the police it was installed backwards
you figure.  If it explodes into high temp. shrapnel, it's not for sale,
but feel free to contact my wife about the Syncro.:&gt;   Tim Smith
