&gt;Recently, I replaced my 87 syncro tranny with a rebuilt unit.  I am coming 
&gt;up on 1000 miles on the new unit and considering changing the tranny oil to 
&gt;remove any chips, badness from the break in of new parts in the rebuilt 
&gt;unit.  Two questions:
&gt;
&gt;1.  is this really necessary/recommended?
&gt;2.  if yes, would replacing with synthetic tranny oil enhance shifting, esp.

&gt;in cold weather and also last longer since it doesn't (?) breakdown as 
&gt;quickly as dino oil.
&gt;
&gt;In the recent discussion of synth oil for engine I saw some words about 
&gt;increasing the likely hood of gasket leaks.  Would this be reduced by having

&gt;new gaskets in with the new tranny?

I would repalce the oil after a few thousand miles to get rid of the wear
particles.  VW claims that the oil should never have to be changed.  They
also so the CV joints never need to greased as long as the boots are good.
 I've seen too many joints and thransmissions fail due to lubricant failure.
 Both items properly lubed should last forever although Vanagon trans do have
some parts that fatiuge for the heck of it.  The 3/4 synchro hub is most
famous for 84 and later. I think it borders on being a recall item as they
did redesign the replacement parts.  I use Mobil synthetic in all my
Transmissions and fill all my rebuilds with the same.  Winter shifting is
definately better and I haven't had a failure in my Syncro's.  Yes I have
two.  A gluten for punishment.
