Subject: *Front* Engine *Compartment* Seal

Sorry for the misnomer in my first post regarding installing a new front 
engine seal.  I meant to say engine *compartment* seal, that is, the seal 
that keeps the engine compartment sealed against the engine tin--you know, 
the one between the fan housing and the gas tank.  I would like to replace 
this on my '71 Westy without removing the engine.  Is it possible?  

If I could install a front *engine* seal without pulling the engine that 
*would* be a neat trick wouldn't it?! ABRACADABRA.....

Thanks,

Ron Van Ness
