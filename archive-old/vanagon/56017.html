Subject: re 1995 EV Winnebago - Cracked Top

&gt;
&gt;Oooohhh... what a sinking feeling.  Just got a call
&gt;at work from my wife - while brushing the snow from the
&gt;poptop of the EV this morning, she detected a large
&gt;and growing crack, driver's side.
&gt;
&gt;Sounds like a complete replacement is required.
&gt;
&gt;Any other EV owners had this problem?

Damn, if you just don't have all the luck with that thing!
(Just how much snow did you have up there anyway? Here I mostly have to
worry about the weight of the moss growing on anything left outside at this
time of year!)
I hope this one is still under warranty - this is the first cracked top
I've ever heard of - although as I recall my '80 Vanagon had a couple of
cracks showing in the interior ribs - nothing external though.
