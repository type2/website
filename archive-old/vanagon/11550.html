Subject: Type IV oil in bellhousing :(

OK all you characters out there ('cause Suffering Builds Character, as we 
all know :)

I pulled my Type IV engine (again, getting quite good at it) since I'm 
still trying to get the right spacing to get the clutch to work (On a 
standard Beetle 'box) Anyway I think I've sorted _that_ problem out.

So I find about a cup of oil in the bellhousing. Engine oil. And the 
engine has run for maybe 30 minutes, idling, revving, couple of times 
around the block. I've just rebuilt the thing, case was line-bored, crank 
was ground, all the nice things. So: what could cause this oil?

1. When I pulled the engine from the donor car, there was no oil. So the 
crank isn't cracked.

2. I did put in a new seal, could I have broken the seal when fitting?

3. Could the oil return hole (into the crankcase) be blocked?

4. Could too much (or too little, but I doubt that) oil in the crankcase 
be the cause? My dipstick isn't working so well...

5. _Anything_ else?

I'll be removing the flywheel for a look tonight. Please cc me by email 
if possible, I get the digest.
