Yeah, I found out people actually have other interests besides Buses!

&gt;Everybody took lots of pictures and it is my understanding that some will
&gt;be posted on the net. We got Bob and Bradley's splitwindows, Dave and
&gt;Patrick's breadloaves, and Martha and Jim's vanagons. Bill drove his sexy
&gt;Corrado VR6.  (While waiting for his even sexier singlecab to be fixed
&gt;up!)

I think the drag racing through the parking lot was the best part! ;-)

&gt;Merry X-mas and HAPPY NEW YEAR!!

I agree! I had a blast meeting everyone, and I hope you all have a nice
holiday.

Bob
