Mark:
I recommend against occasional &quot;runnings&quot;. If you do not get it up to
operating temp for at least 20 minutes moisture builds up in the oil. I
would plug up the exhaust and air intake (moisture and rodent proof) and
remove the battery to somewhere warm. A trickle charger on a timer would
not hurt either. 
Good Luck
