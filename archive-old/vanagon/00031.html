I'm not sure if the previous message got through. Here it goes again.

My '73 Westfalia had COOL(tm) airconditioning when I bought it in '81.
It was installed around '78 for a trip from L.A. to Chicago by the
previous owner.  I had to tinker around with it and add freon to get
it to work. Once it did, it was so cold that 'snow' would come out of
the vents under the dash.

It *really* taxed the engine. It was bad. Eventually it broke down
and I removed it from the car. Added more tin where the dealer hacked
their way in to fit the compressor.  I don't really need it here in
Southern Calif. - we don't have seasons here. ;-)



While I'm here...Does this list come in a digestified format?
I had 84 mail messages this morning. Whew.


Jack.
