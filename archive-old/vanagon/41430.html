Subject: Re: 66 VW Camper (fwd)


&gt;I have a 66 camper that hasn't run for 10 years.....had a rod knock when I
&gt;parked it.  Body is  not great, but a VW mechanic could probably get it
&gt;going  and it would be good for backwoods (ie. fire roads) camping.  It
&gt;has an external oil cooler and some other special parts. 50
&gt;bucks and you drag it away.
&gt;
&gt;e-mail me if interested.

Uh oh, sounds like another Grendel.
