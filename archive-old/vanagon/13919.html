Subject: Re: alcohol burner question

&gt;Thanks Derek for your great info.  The kind of burner I was
&gt;talking about was actually the one made for heat; I forgot
&gt;to distinguish that from the one for cooking, but I guess
&gt;either would work.  


Martha, 
I never said that the Orego was made for cooking. It is made for heat. 

I used to drive with the Oregos going all the time in my 72 bus, but as tim
said, it sort of gets expensive after a while.

I never felt this was dangerous. You would understand this if you saw the
Oregos in action. There is a flame, but the flame is deep in there and
doesn't spread even if you tip the thing over.
