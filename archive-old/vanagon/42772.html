&gt; &gt;What is the general thought on aircooled 1600's and synthetic oil?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Thanks for the input...
&gt; 
&gt; I believe strongly in synthetics,  however, without an oil filter, the
&gt; beniifit of extended drain intervals are limited.  

A fellow here at work is into Formula V racing (they use stock VW type 1 
engines). He used to use regular oil, changed every race, and tear down 
the engine at the end of the season with noticable wear. He changed to 
synthetic, never changed the oil all season, and at tear down time, there 
was no wear at all. It's gotta be good.
