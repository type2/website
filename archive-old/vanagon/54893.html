&gt; &gt; &gt;I was looking for new pad that covers the engine and completes the lower
&gt; &gt;  &gt;bed in my Camper.  Any suggestions?
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt;  Try to get a pad from a Diesel where available. They are made of plastic
&gt; &gt;  and not as heavy as the steel ones. I guess they will be reduce the
&gt; &gt;  engine noise better because the  denoiser is glued onto it. I used the
&gt; &gt;  plastic to raise a part of the lid. I will send you part# if required.
&gt; 
&gt; Concerning the engine lid though, all later models (87+) I've seen came wth
&gt; the plastic lid, while and 82 diesel's I saw came with the heavy metal lid.
&gt;  I think VW changed over sometime between 82 &amp; 86 from metal to plastic on
&gt; all the lids.
&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone know when this change was made?
&gt; 
Both my 84's have the plastic lids.
