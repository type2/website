Subject: Re: A Freindly Wave

&gt;it's the Yuppie crowd ... the one's that caused the death of the bus as
&gt;we know it. :(  they don't wave at all. even in their Bimmers.

Well you know the hard-core yuppie-scum are looking down their noses at VW
drivers anyway... ;)
&gt;
&gt;i wave at all the buses. but the Eurovans and the Vanagons RARELY ever wave
&gt;back. even some of the breadloafs look at me like i'm nuts.
&gt;
&gt;but i did get a wave and peace-sign from a dark blue Eurovan the other day!

I get waves and peace signs often in Die Frau; and frequently in the
Vanagon, oddly enuff.  And once I even got headlight flashes &amp; wild waving
from a whole bunch of folks.  Of course the spare tire was falling off the
front...
