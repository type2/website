Subject: Looking for watercooled Double cab pickup

I am still lookong for a doublecab pickup, water cooled.
Thought I had one in Ontario but the guy decided he wanted collector 
price. I want something to drive and can't justify top $ just cause 
something is asthetically appealing compared to conventional alternatives 
like extra cab pickups...
Anyway if you come across a double cab post here or E-mail me

Thanks
