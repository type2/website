I would have the PO drop the spare tire carrier and check the steering 
column couplings.  If they are cracked or broken the bus behaves like the 
rach is bad by wandering all over the place.  As far as the worn front 
tire, I'd have an alignment done first and let them pinpoint the trouble 
spots.
