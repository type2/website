Subject: Re[2]: Dealer service ripoff?


	The bit about not turning discs or drums is obiously factory
made balogna. A good reason, in and of itself, to find an independant
service place. Sad, really sad.

	The thought of a '&quot;Bullet Train&quot; break system' [sic] cracks me
up... but I assume he means brake...

	Bruce Anderson, the Technical Director of the Porsche Club
of America recommends against braided stainless steel-over-teflon
brake hoses. They work good, and are universal on racing cars, but
the stainless steel braid work-hardens and fails catestrophicly, 
quite a bit different from the stock rubber hose.
	Anderson said, at a 914 maintenance seminar that I
atteneded, that he knew of one automobile accident that would
be traced to failed stainless-braid brake lines and no accidents
that could be laid to failed rubber line.

	This seems like good advice and sound reasonaing...

	Bill
