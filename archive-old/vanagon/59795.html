&gt; Dennis:
&gt; 
&gt;    Thanks for info on Rialta pricing.   IMO, it's one of the nicest   
&gt; class B van camper packages out there, few of which feature both widebody
&gt; design and decent interior styling. 

	It's been a few years, things may have changed.  But RVs with
engines used to be defined based on body type as:

	Class A:  RV body built from the chassis on up.

	Class B1: Van, body intact, modified for recreational use, e.g. with
captain's chairs, beds

	Class B2: Van, body intact, modified for commercial use,  e.g with
racks and such

	Class C: Van, cab only, with RV body built on behind

The Rialta would be a Class C since the EV cab is used.  The EV-C would be
a Class B1.
