Subject: 65 pop-out window disassembly

    Hullo all,
    
    Does anyone have any brilliant ideas about how to disassemble the 
    pop-out back window frames on my '65 bus. I'm wanting to replace the 
    rubbers and noticed that there's outer and inner and in-between rubbers 
    in the catalog - but how do you get the frame apart??
    
    Any ideas gratefully received!
