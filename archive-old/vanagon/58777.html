Subject: Oh those leakin' heads!

One more time:  My '91 Carat was just diagnosed once again with a head gasket
leak at 77,000 miles young.  Happened about 25 thousand miles ago as well.
 VWoA paid for gasket and head replacement back then.  The regional guy is
saying 'no-go' this time around.

Question: Shouldn't this first repair have lasted at least more than 25K?

Also, the dealer is saying they may have to replace the heads again, maybe
not.  After only 25K, does that sound like it's believable.  They won't know
'til they open her up.

Price quoted is roughly $1,300 for the gasket job and roughly $400 per head
if necessary.  HELP.  I need some real good advice.  We're not talking small
dollars here.  Also, is this a job for Super Arbitrator?

Thanks in advance from a former air sucker (''71 Camper) and current
disappointed water dripper.

Sam
