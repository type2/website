OK Doug I can take a dare!

I've got the DATA to back me up, so here goes...2 months of used VW van 
clippings from the San Francisco Chronical and the San Jose Mercury News tell 
me that non-Westy vanagons '86, '87, '88 with similar options are running from 
a low of about $2200 bad condition to $7000 with lowish miles. '90s are going 
for a lot more $$, $12k common to see.

Here's some example ads:

'85, needs motor work, $2200
'86, 63k mi, $4500
'86, synchro, 130k mi, $4.5k
'85, immaculate, $3950
'87, , ? mi, wolfsburg, $6900
'85, ? mi, $3450
'89, wolfsburg, 69k mi, $12k
'85, needs mtr wk, $2200
'84, 32k mi, wheelchair system, $5900

I figure mine has all the desireable options but does need some work. Bonus 
points for new registration, higher horsepower engine (can't remeber is it the 
digifant or digijet?). In CA you have to sell with smog sign off, so no extra 
points. So I think that $2800 is a reasonable price, try that on for size!
