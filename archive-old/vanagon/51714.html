Subject:      Re: Mudflap installation - any tips?

if you can get to the web pages, you should look at Harry Yates' web page.
he's got some really neat home-made mudflaps on his syncro.

i tried to figure out how to mount the vw mudflaps and gave up ... i'd have
to drill holes into the sheet metal of the body, and i decided i did NOT
want to do that. after seeing a few campers with broken mud flaps that
scratched the body as they flopped about, i'm glad i didn't put them on.

anyway, look at Harry's page. you might get an idea of a better way to do it.
