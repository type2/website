Subject: Re:  Bike Racks

I just got a Paulchen rack, and I want to encourage folks to get one of
these if they can possibly afford it.  It's a beautiful rack, and fits
wonderfully onto the Vanagon rear hatch.  It's so low-profile that my Van
cover still fits with the rack on the van!

I took some pictures and will be posting them to my web page soon.
