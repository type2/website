Subject: Re: Introduction and Re: Second batteries..



I've got two auxillary &quot;marine/RV&quot; type batteries in my 85 Westphalia. I 
put them under the rear bench. Have to be careful with wiring. Must also 
be enclosed to minimuize risks. I had an RV place to the install.

It's great.

You also benefit by using very heavy guage cable to maximize throughput 
of amps. Short runs of wire. And you should consider putting a variable 
control on the alternator so you can jack up the amps flowing in.

&gt; Hello, fellow VW bus-folks:
&gt; 
&gt; I was reading the newsgroup when I read the info on this group,
&gt; immediately stopped reading news, and subscribed to the list.
&gt; The first posting I got was:
&gt;  
&gt; &gt; I saw a note about someone asking if anyone had put a second battery into
&gt; &gt; their bus.. I've got a 73 and would be interested in the info too... I was
&gt; &gt; thinking about possibly running a deep-cycle as a a second, mostly for
&gt; &gt; camping (leaving the lights and radio on, etc)..

&gt; Strangely enough I have (among others) this same exact question.
&gt; 
&gt; See:
&gt; I just bought a '73 camper (my first VW) from a garage that had just
&gt; rebuilt the engine and put in a new clutch. (The guy didn't want to
&gt; pay the bill)  I will undoubtedly have other questions, including
&gt; the one above, but my most urgent is:
&gt;  
&gt; How should I treat my new engine?  I want it to last as
&gt; long as possible and hope to avoid any break-in mistakes that
&gt; would shorted its life.
&gt; 
&gt; Any tips appreciated.
&gt;
