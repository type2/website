Subject: I need advice....

I recently hit a BIG bump in my 1985 Vanagon and, evidently, some seals
in the rack ruptured. Power steering fluid just flows out!  My mechanic
says that he could replace the seals but wasn't sure how long it would
last.  He also said that he couldn't &quot;guarantee&quot; his work and
recommended that I purchase a rebuilt rack.  Got one price off the net
of $450.00 with my core.  Whoa, had no idea they were so expensive?

So....looking for recommendations.  Should I go with the &quot;unguaranteed&quot;
work and hope for the best or just go ahead and &quot;bite the bullet&quot; and
get the rebuilt rack?  Perhaps there's another alternative?

BTW, I just subscribed to this digest yesterday and am delighted you are
all out there.

Looking forward to hearing from you soon.
