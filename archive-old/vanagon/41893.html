So Marlin Bates, IV says:
&gt; 
&gt; Here is the problem:  When I put the parking lights one the front left turn
&gt; signal is as bright as the sun but the right one is fairly dim (esp. in
&gt; comparison to the other).

You need to the swap the wires on the left one so that the parking light
lead is connected to the dim filiment and the bright one is used for 
the turn signal/flasher.  

Oh no.... I've *never* made that mistake before....   ;)
