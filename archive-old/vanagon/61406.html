Subject: Wheels &amp; Tires

OK all you Vanagon Experts out there,
	I am new to the list and have been searching the archives for info
on what wheels and tires will fit on a stock '91 Vanagon GL. I see the
15&quot;x7&quot; Borbet II wheels recomended, one post says something about a 16&quot;x8&quot;
as well. My question is, will 15's or 16's fit, and do I have to size down
the tires similar to the TireRack &quot;Plus Concept&quot;? I use the bus for all
manner of things and would love to put larger wheels and tires on but don't
know about clearence, performance etc. Does anyone have experience with
this?
Thanks in advance.
