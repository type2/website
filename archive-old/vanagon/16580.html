&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Hi,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;It looks at if there once used to be a mud flap behind the
&gt;&gt;front/right wheel: a metal piece that could have been part of a mud flap is
&gt;&gt;still there.  Sami ('75 Westy)

My 83 westy has only one mud flap on the left side to protect the propane tank.
I looked at the right side and could not see any trace of a flap being there
before. I am not sure there was one there.
