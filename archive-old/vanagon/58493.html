Good advice.

However, I would not recommend going wider than a 205/70R14 with going to a wide rim.  Also, 
there may be clearance problems with larger tire sizes.

&gt;the 185R14 is a pretty dinky tire, no way will I use them. 195/75 and 205/70

&gt;Ditto on the Contis, they sucked when on as OEMs. If that Bridgestone is the
&gt;one I was shown, it's like a transport truck tire, designed in the 70's for
&gt;Oldsmobilge Wagons etc. Worth checking on Goodyears too BTW, the Wrangler AT
&gt;6ply in 195/75 looks like an excellent snow tire, best treads I've seen in
&gt;that size. Also for those of you who want big sneakers for their Syncros,
&gt;the AT is avail in 27/8.5/14 6ply
&gt;
&gt;the door sticker on my SYncro lists 185R, and 205/70 as 'stock' sizes on the
&gt;14&quot; steel rims. 195/75 fits nicely in between. These rims are same as any
&gt;loaf from '70-79 so all above sizes should suit loafs/vanagons. Why do we
&gt;keep coming back to this?  I think a mini FAQ is required, sent out upon
&gt;sign-up and/or every month.
