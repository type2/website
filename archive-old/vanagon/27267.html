Subject: NON VW...electric cars
Date: 23 Oct 95 15:01EDT

Sorry for taking up the bandwidth, but I'm looking for info
in electric autos.  I've used a net browser to find everything
I can on the WWW, and now I'd like to know if you folks can turn
me on to any dealers, owners, outfits that do conversions or sell
parts/kits, etc.  Any help would be appreciated.  (I've seen all
kinds of info out there that say that they are coming to CA...are
they available yet?)

Thanks!
