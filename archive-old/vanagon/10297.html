Quick suggestion for pushing the pistons back in the callipers. I
found a 6&quot; &quot;C&quot; clamp at a yard sale once. Whenever I need to push
the pistons back into the calliper, I put the stationary end of the
clamp on the calliper opposite the piston and the screw part of
the clamp onto or into the piston and then crank away! It pushes
in even the most stubborn piston...and does not chew up the
surface of the piston like a pair of pliers or grips might.
