Subject: Re: Fridge temps/Help

I need fridge advice. I salvaged the interior of an '84 Westy and am working 
on the fridge. Can someone tell me if the fridge will run/cool if it is 
plugged into 120Volts only. I can see no reason why not, but it didn't chill 
the fins at all in over an hour, nor was any heat drifting out of the 
exhaust duct. Do I need the 12volt also connected? Is the thermostat 12volt 
or something??? TIA

misc parts I could use:

Sink drain connector and cap for underside
table, arm, front mount (on drivers seat)

Send'em along pls.
