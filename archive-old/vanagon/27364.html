Subject: Heating (Eberspacher and VW T&amp;A)

Hi folks,

A few weeks back I posted a 1-800 # for Espar, the comany that sells
Eberspacher gas/diesel heaters in North America.  I recieved a free manual
from them for my old BN4 heater when I called to inquire about local
dealers.  Originally I was told that some parts are still available for
older heaters--well after calling dealers in my area for a combustion blower
fan for the BA6 and a BN4 models I was told that parts for these heaters are
no longer available.   

So, if you have a model other than a BN4 or BA6 you could try to call, but
don't get your hopes up.  

Speaking of VW T&amp;A, I remember hearing over the net this past spring that a
summer or fall issue would deal with a &quot;new&quot; heater for buses.  Did anyone
who gets that rag see such an article?  I'd be curious to hear of any
heating innovations.
