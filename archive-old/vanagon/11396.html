Subject: Re: Ecu &amp; Idle Stabilizer

They told me &quot;they all drive like this&quot;, so I sued 
&gt;in small claims court after an authorized Bosch centre replaced 3 components 
&gt;following 2 days of testing. VWoC settled out of court for the full amount, 
&gt;$2,500Cdn. This was after they had replaced the ECU brain twice.  Be 
&gt;persistant.   tim s.
&gt;

Cool, the little guy wins.  It doesn't happen very often, but it sure is 
nice when it does.  Definitely be persistent!
