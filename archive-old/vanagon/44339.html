Hi Jonathan!
Sorry I did'nt answer before, was out for several days. I'm glad that you
are planning the honeymoon in P.R. Well, I'll recommend to stay in San Juan
for several days and hang around the Old San Juan. We have wonderful places
to go, specially if you are the type of people looking for good food and
fun. You should probably come to San Juan on thursday morning and go to visit
the west part of the island next monday and stay in a guest house in Boque-
ron near by the ocean (town of Cabo Rojo) for about 4 days. In that little
town what you will see is beautiful beaches, a bunch of crazy guys and a lot
of fun. I'm asuming you like informal type of environnment. Bring light clothes
( for Amanda a couple of tangas will be O.K.) I mean shorts and 100% cotton
T-shirts because at this time of the year Puerto Rico is really hot, don't
 forget some formal clothes (just in case you want to go to Discos or casinos
and some restaurants). Here we wear most of the time casual clothes. Most
of the recognized credit cards are accepted everywhere but don't forget to
bring some cash.  As soon you get here contact me by phone (787)765-7689
at home or (787) 764-0000 Ext. 2198 at the University of Puerto Rico.

See ya!
