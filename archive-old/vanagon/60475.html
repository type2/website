&gt;FYI,
&gt;For good photos of the EV Winnebago camper check out:
&gt;http://www.owasco-canada_dot_com/winncamp.htm.
&gt;
&gt;Owasco is a large Canadian VW dealership specializing in campers:

&gt;'86 Syncro Westy

Does this mean the EV Winne and not the EV Westfalia is sold in Canada?

Looks like the passenger bench seats are a slight improvement over what I
remember seeing in the 95 camper.  Any one know if arm rests are available
or are the somehow molded into the surrounding interior walls?  Also what
happens to the middle seat when you are camping?  Does it fold down?
