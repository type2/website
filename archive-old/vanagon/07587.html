Subject: Article: Vanagon Hop Ups

Here is the article from Hot VWs about adding performance parts to the 
Vanagon engine.  FYI, I did not include the picture captions since they
were the same descriptions as the text.  One of the pictures did show a
complete engine but did not have an exhaust system.  The valve covers
shown in the pictures are the bolt-on type.  Another picture had one on
a dyno with a GMC blower and Magneto that produces 385 HP _at_7800 rpm.

Enjoy!

Off-Road Racing the Wasserboxer
By Lane Evans

     For almost twenty years, the trusty Type 1 had been the mainstay as
a power source for off-road racing.  In the last several years, however,
the search for power and reliability has brought other power options to
the sport - Type 4, Porsche 911, Toyota and Rabbit.  With the
introduction of VW's 1983 new car line up in October of '82, a new
option surfaced - a 1915cc water-cooled flat four.  Development of this
engine has been slow but on going.  RaceKraft, in Phoenix, Arizona, has
been working with the wasserboxer for almost two years and, with Station
1's Steve Godfrey, now has one competitively running in a Sandhawk Class
2 entry, own by Steve.  John Isaacs, owner of RaceKraft invited us over
to his shop for an overview of the assembly of Steve's 86x100mm water-
cooled.
     John likes the future potential of the water-cooled because of it
horsepower capabilities through larger bores and higher compression
ratios, on Steve's engine they're running 11.8:1!  Higher compression
ratios have been a primary sore spot on Type 1s because engine life, in
many cases, goes down proportionally as the compression increases.  This
off-road engine is shown with a dual Zenith 32 NDIX setup, but is back
on the dyno looking at the potential using Webers.
     Like the Type 4s, the wasserboxer's case is aluminum, with aluminum
alloy heads, aluminum water jackets and steel sleeves.  John likes the
aluminum case aspect of the wasserboxer because of its toughness
compared to the almost brittle properties of a self-cured mag/alloy Type
1 case.  Still, reinforcing is done at the back of the case on the
number three cylinder side as with almost all performance Type 1s.  The
case was also clearanced to accommodate the Berg crank (86mm stroke). 
The bore has been increased from the stock 94mm to 100mm, using
cylinders made by Billet Machine's Mark Niver.  John went to Arias for
the pistons and Carrillo for the rods.  The cam is an Engle FK10 (310
duration, .385 lift), with Dial-In straight cut gears.  The head utilize
stock valves (34.5mm exhaust, 40mm intakes), inner/outer valve springs
(Bugpack outer, stock inner), Scat Type 4 solid lifters, Norris push 
rods, 1.4:1 Empi rocker arms and are mildly ported by Gary Zillman of 
Headflow Performance.  As we speak, John is putting together another set 
of heads with 37.5mm exhaust and 46mm intakes, all part of the ongoing
development
     Like the Porsches, oil squirter jets have been install in the case
that spray the underside of the pistons with oil - primarily for
cooling.  John uses Weber idle jets, they're a lot cheaper than buying
nozzles from Porsche.  A windage tray was also designed that, with a
Melling Type 1 oil pump and Berg relief-valve cover, routes oil to the
suction side of the oil pump so the pump is always primed.
     Once the short block is assembled, aside from the wasserboxer's
stock water pump, the other top-side bolt-ons are fairly standard - Type
1 fuel pump, Bosch 009 distributor, Type 1 valve covers, and stock
alternator.  For off-road, a UMP power steering unit is added, mounting
to a slick Mark Niver built bracket.  As we mentioned, Zenith 32 NDIX
carbs are used atop match-ported, modified ARPM manifolds.  Once the
engine is fully assembled, except for some noticeable additional
plumbing, the wasserboxer is almost indistinguishable from its air-
cooled brother, unless you spot the Rabbit diesel radiator first. 
Weight-wise, it is about 20 pounds heavier than a Type 1, but does have
its advantages.  We'll stay in touch with John and Steve as they
continue to develop the engine.  As we mentioned, they do have several
other combinations that still need to be explored, but they feel the
potential is at hand, plus the advantages we've discussed.

performance water-cooled flat four, call John Isaacs at RaceKraft, (602)
