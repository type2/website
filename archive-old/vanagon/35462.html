&gt;&gt; like to get one that matches the year of my bus (1969).  Does anyone have
&gt;&gt; any suggestions?  For junkyard/dismantler suggestions I am in Northern
&gt;&gt; California in Stockton which is 1 hour south of Sacramento.

Thom&gt; I like Pozzi's in Sacramento; thats where I got mine.

Seconded.  And thanks to Thom for sending me there in the first place
:-)
