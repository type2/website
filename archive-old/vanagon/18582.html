Subject: engine: rebuild or replace?

I've got 166K on my 77 camper's engine and blue smoke when I start it.
I'm not mechanically-minded and I don't have the tools or space or time 
or knowledge to do the job myself. But the engine will have to be rebuilt
or replaced in the near future. Which is better to do?

My mechanic says a proper rebuild may cost up to $2000. I notice places,
even Sears, advertise rebuilt engines for substantially less. What's the
better direction and why?
