Blaine,

1.In my '84, the filler is under the rug to the left of the clutch pedal.

2. For tent, etc., try VW Canvas in Texas near San Antonio.  See http:

     Folks-
     
     While I'm (still) waiting for replacement owner's manuals to show up 
     at the local dealer, I'm beginning to wonder where the filler for the 
     front washer tank is hidden.  'Course, if my memory weren't going, I'd
     think to ask the dealer when I call to check on the manual - I'm 
     getting ready to leave on a trip and I can just imagine the fluid 
     giving out about 100 mi into it.
     
     Also, is it worth asking if there are any Westfalia tents for sale?  
     (Don't laugh me off the list, okay?)  Is anyone making similar tents 
     in North America?  (I know; if it's not on the VW tent page, it 
     doesn't exist, right?)
     
     Has anyone had any luck getting a reasonable facsimile made by a local
     canvas company?
     
     If you see a Silver Westfalia this weekend going through Moab, Capitol
     Reef, and around the north end of Lake Powell, honk and wave!
     
     -Blaine
