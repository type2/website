Subject: cleaning carpet in-situ

Greetings and happy friday!
        Does anyone have experience cleaning antifreeze out of
carpet/soundproofing without removing the carpet? My under-the-seat heater
core gave way a short while ago and that antifreeze will NOT dry up. I made
a feeble attempt at pulling up the carpet and soundproofing last night but
it is really glued down and I just seemed to rip the insulation and
stretch/mis-shape the carpet. No matter how long I suck with the shop-vac,
there always seems to be more.

        how about one of those carpet cleaners that the supermarkets rent
out? Any ideas or experiences?

thanks, pat
