Subject: Re: Corrado in a Vanagon

When I had my transmission rebuilt by a local mechanic (A very good 
mechanic in Dallas!)  he mentioned that the transmissions in the 
Vanagons were actually Audi units.  In fact, I remember him 
mentioning that he obtained some parts for mine from an Audi 
transmission source.  I wonder if it might be possible 
to obtain &quot;gearing&quot; that would take more advantage of something like 
a VR6 or Corrado G60 engine.
