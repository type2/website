Okay boys,

I'm planning on a similar swap.  I have 3 options, an '87 8V GTI, a G60, or
a VR6.  I have some good experience with modifying all those engines, and a
friend who is a true expert on what mods work and don't.

Please keep me up to date on your experiences, and feel free to ask me any
questions about the GTI/GLI engines.

James
