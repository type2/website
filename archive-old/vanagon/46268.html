&gt;--- Fact is when the engine is turned off, the pistons usually come to rest
&gt;all in the same position (roughly!) (ie- not at tdc or bdc) so when you
&gt;fire it up, the starter grabs the flywheel in one of 2 positions- whack
&gt;straight onto the
&gt;ring gear. Now if you move the flywheel 90', as I have done on a couple
&gt;of crap engines, you are effectively using a stronger and probably less
&gt;starter wearing part of the flywheel.---
&gt;
&gt;** When I read this it got me thinking, he has a point.  I had a 66 bus
&gt;with a 1641cc engine and a degree wheel pulley.  I used to noticed that
&gt;when I turn off the engine it would come to rest a about the same point
&gt;everytime.   Same thing in my bug too.  So whats my point?  Well none
&gt;really, just backing up Aaron's point about the starter hitting the
&gt;flywheel at roughly the same points.  Just my to marks worth.  Take care.
