Subject: Adjust Battery LED Pot

I adjusted the pot behind my LED panel with a simultaneous volt meter
attached to the battery. I turned lights on and off until the volt meter read
12.5 volts and then I adjusted the pot so the green light just went on.
(since 12.6 volts is a full battery). At 12.4 volts the LED reads yellow.

You all know that 11.9 volts is a dead battery; 12.25 is half charged, and
12.6 is fully charged, right?
