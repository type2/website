Howdy,

	Well, there was no turkey in my stars for today, so instead I
worked on the bus.
	
	I got the idiot lights working, finally!  I bought a good multitester
yesterday, which helped a lot!  I had put new plastic &quot;lenses&quot; in the 
speedo for them, but I'd never been able to see them before!

	While I was in there, I also got the speedo lights working!

	The turn signal turned out to be more of a challenge:  they used to
work, and worked a little after I put the bus together, but got slower
and slower...  Also, the left one appears to be shorted (continuity
between the two posts...)

	Then I took the bus down to the car wash - it was due.  It got
a B+ on the pressure washer test, which is much more severe than any rain
we get here.
