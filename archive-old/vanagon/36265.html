Subject: Re: Wasserboxers with Gas Heaters?

There is a factory-installed gas heater in an '84 Westfalia that is in the
Roamin' Holiday fleet. It's a Canadian model (from Alberta), and I assume
that was an available option generally in Canada in that year.

I don't know what type it is, or how easy it would be to transplant it into
another Vanagon. It works the same as the gas heaters in air-cooled models:
turn a knob on the dash, and after ignition the heater works for about 15-20
minutes, then shuts off on it's own. It does not have a thermostat.
