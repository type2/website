Subject: Re: CV Boots

If I'm not mistaken, the split boots are really for the pre-68 buses. I 
wouldn't know if they fit or not on later models.

IMHO, the CV boot replacement is feared or loathed more than it should be. 
It only takes a couple hours to pull one side, disassemble, clean, 
inspect, reassemble, reboot, and install...and I'm painfully slow about 
bus repairs. Of course, the first time I tried it, I pulled the wheel to 
get to the CV (insert ridicule here). It took several days that way. \-0

Funny, it's one of those things that so many POs procrastinate on and yet 
so essential to the overall well-being of the bus. In the future, it will 
be one of the essential, immediate tasks on any VW purchase I make. I'm 
beginning to realize that there are a handful of such things you just 
ought to do right away after purchasing a new (new to you, that is) VW.
