&gt;I went to the VW dealership in Central Fl. to look at the new Winnebago
&gt;EV's.  They looked real nice, although I like the lower pop-top on the
&gt;Westfalia EV.  Well by the time I got finished looking at the vans, the 
&gt;salesmen said that he would give me $13-$14K for my 89' Westfalia, and
&gt;already had contacted a potential buyer for it.  I have 60K miles and 
&gt;my van is super clean.  The new Winnebago was $30K.  Does anyone know
&gt;how good a deal this is?

For spending that much money, I would look at a Rialta.  Almost a real RV.  I
got a price of $42K on one fully loaded including roof A/C and generator.
 Included 13&quot; color tv, batroom with shower and hot water, sleeps 4 or seats
8.  As an RV it can be financed for 15 years and the interest is tax
deductible as a second home.  Find a dealer that has one and check it out.
 Of course for this money you can almost get a full size RV. But the Rialta
is still practical to drive daily if needed. Although I love the current FUN
BUS, I wouldn't mind owning one of these.
Saving my pennies,
Dennis.
