&gt; I hate to let you know this, but when I took my pump apart under similar

Well, that's going to happen to the pump that they use.  The pumps aren't 
really self priming, so they need to be below the water level.  That 
makes it so there is constant pressure on the pump.  It can help a little 
if the pump is mounted with the motor body above the pump head.
