Subject: philosoph.advice

Hello to all,

I have a '65 split window, original paint, original interior (excpt 
uplstry), only a little rust (under the battery), with a '71  1600 SP, 
original leaking trans, original leaking weather stripping. It sounds 
pretty desperate but it runs well and looks pretty nice too.
  My wife and 
I are planning to move from Western Colorado (Dry) to the Twin Cities (Wet).
I am continually wrestling with the idea (and the cost) of a complete 
restoration, but sometimes I feel that it is necessary in order to keep 
this 30 yr. old vehicle on the road.
I would like to hear some opinions regarding the restoration of such a 
vehicle (the guy who sold it to me felt it should be placed in a museum) 
i.e. NOT DRIVEN, but he also pieced together the enging using misc. parts 
which I have subsequently removed and replaced-  so he really showed some 
inconsistencies.
 Where should I begin?
Are there any anti-rust compounds (I've heard of a zinc/nitro mixture???)?
Will a move to Minnesota be the death of my bus? 
Should I stop driving it in order to save it-  This doesn't seem to do 
her justice.
Any advice or philosophical discourse (to drive or not to drive) (to 
restore or not to restore)  would be greatly welcomed.

Thanks, 
Corbin Connell
