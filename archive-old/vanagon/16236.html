Tell me more, Jim. Do you own the sandblasting equipment or did you rent
it? Do you need an enclosed space or a garage? Did you lift the van? How
much $$ is involved? How 'bout plastic media (I heard a large bag of those
is expensive)?

I really would like to take care of this since 4 years in Missouri have
caused a fair amount of surface rust. I'd be willing to pay a shop $100 to
do it for me, but I'm sure that won't go far. Or would it?

Thanks!
