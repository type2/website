Hi Ric, all OK? You said:

&gt; It seems to me that VW has been having problems with these things burning 
&gt; up...all considering that I purchased the &quot;B&quot; resistors last July and now 11 
&gt; months later they have a &quot;D&quot; version.

As you probably know, VW parts can be long on the shelf as well, maybe you
get a &quot;B&quot; version again next time...

Brian,
