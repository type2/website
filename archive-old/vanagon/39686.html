Subject: (Fwd) Vanagon

A gentleman from the BMW Digest contacted me w/ the following 
message.  I don't really know the answer to his questions.  I THINK 
that the transaxles are compatible (w/ modification) but if anyone 
can give me some info, I'd be glad to forward it on.

	Hi Greg.  I noticed you drive a Vanagon and had a question. 
Aren't the transaxles on these in the same family as older VW bugs, etc? 
I was looking around for a cheap, sturdy transaxle for use in a mid-engine
transplant I'm considering and the Vanagon came up in conversation with a
buddy of mine.  Is it a 4 or 5-speed?  Final drive ratio?  TIA, Ron.

Various old BMW, Alfa, Lotus.
