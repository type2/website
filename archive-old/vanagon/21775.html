Subject:      forgot to include the list ...

On Fri, 28 Jul 95 19:18:12 CDT, Ric &quot;Rabble-rouser&quot; Golen mouthed off:
&gt;Joel...if you REALLY wanted to put out some useful stats while
&gt;our list-fuhrer Gerry is away...howabout the annual list
&gt;of who has the most posts? Huh...huh...
&gt;Gerry's away...let's play!!  ;-)

well, after the last Fiasco Follies, gerry just disemboweled that function
on the machine. however, *I* have been keeping up with the totals myself
... purely out of scientific curiosity, of course. ;)

so, here are the top ten posters (from 01/01/95):

RGOLEN_at_umassd_dot_edu                 Richard Golen       7,340
SJOHNSON_at_PCOCD2.INTEL.COM         Steven Johnson      1,113
NRUBIN_at_S1.CSUHAYWARD.EDU          Martha Rubin        1,112
BUSGIRL_at_NETCOM.COM                Martha Rubin          935
DCARMENT_at_CCS.CARLETON.CA          David Carment         704
VEEDUBER_at_AOL.COM                  Robert S. Hoover      645

JBRILL_at_UNLINFO.UNL.EDU            James Brill           227
GSKER                             Gerald Skerbitz       226
JWALKER_at_UA1VM.UA.EDU              Joel Walker           117

the rest of the bunch feel below the triple-digit mark. so all of you who
dislike stuffed email readers, these are the ones at whom you may scoff. :)

ol' 117 :)
