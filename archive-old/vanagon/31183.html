&gt;I want to replace the factory installed rear speakers on my '87.  These are

(rear-most)
&gt;cover?  Will the AC components fall on my head?  Is there anything I need
&gt;to be forewarned about?  Thanks in advance ...

STOP!  That's NOT just a cover.  That big plastic A/C thing is what the A/C
evaporator (VERY HEAVY) is mounted to.  To remove/replace the rear speakers
just remove the 4 screws that hold each of them in and the speaker will drop
into your hand.  If you intend some modifications to the A/C &quot;cover&quot; (like
for bigger speakers) I'd seriously suggest doindg the work with it in place.
 If you MUST remove it, it won't be easy.  First you need to remove both of
the vertical side covers.  Then prepare a way to support the weight of the
A/C unit.  At this point you could certainly use a friend to help you ease it
down, but he won't last long if you expect him to hold the thing!  The A/C
hoses run into this unit and you won't want to disconnect them, and without
disconnecting them you won't be able to move the thing very far from where
it's at right now.  I think the bottom line is to avoid removing the thing if
at all possible.

Good luck!
