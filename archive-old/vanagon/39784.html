&gt; Well the lug nuts I reported on never did come off.  After a 2 weeks of
&gt; WD-40 soaking, tapping, and tugging I took it to a nearby service station
&gt; where we commenced hex-stripping and chiseling.  Now it's off to the dealer
&gt; to get the rims pulled, replace studs and lug nuts as required.  Of course
&gt; the mirror is still out of action too.  And changing the oil today  I
&gt; noticed a badly cracked exhaust header.  Such is life with a 140k mile vehicle.

Ouch!  Sounds like a bad case of Vanagony.
