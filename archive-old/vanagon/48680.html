 I had water leak from the A/C unit once.  It actually would get the carpet
 wet by the rear of the sliding door.
 
 The pan you describe is drained by two hoses that go down the side panels
 part way.  I couldn't get to them from in the van, but from outside you can
 remove the air intake grills on the van sides at the rear upper corners
 (the black plastic grills).  Inside there you should see a black rubber
 hose.  Mine had some piece on the end that plugged up with who knows what,
 probably some growth of sorts.  I just removed the piece.  Never leaked
 since.

That rubber piece is actually a check valve.  It plugs up with dirt that the
A/C washes out of the air.  That piece should not be removed as it functions
to keep air from flowing backwards through the tubes.  With the fan on high
and the van traveling at highway speeds, enough air will flow through the
tubes to keep the water from draining down.  A long trip with out stopping
will make this evident.  Cutting a small notch in the flap will allow more
dirt to pass and allow the water to drain faster but you should not remove
the flap.  I often use my van for long trips and It took me two years to
figure out why I still got rained on with the ruuber tips removed.  I now
clean them twice a year.  Only takes a few minutes.

Dennis.
