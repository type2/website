Subject: re: brakes on EV

$120 a set?  Wow, a little too steep for me.  I'd try the FLAPS version
first.  My EV rotors are not vented, btw.  I'd be interested in a write-up
on the procedure when you're done.  BTW, what mileage are you at now?

&gt;
&gt;Has anybody out there done the front brakes on their Eurovan?
&gt;
&gt;Mine are almost gone, VW wants $120.00 for the pads alone.  NAPA has them 
&gt;for $40.00.
&gt;Also the dealer asked me if they were vented, have you seen any Eurovans 
&gt;with vented rotors?
&gt;
&gt;Do these prices aound about right?
&gt;
&gt;Does anybody have any pointers on doing it?
&gt;
&gt;Is it any worse than a Vanagon?
&gt;
&gt;I haven't got my Bently yet (two months and counting).
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Thanks for any help,
