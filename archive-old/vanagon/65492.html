Subject:      Kool patch, Alternatives?

Ideas anyone?

        I called all over and no Kool Patch.  I found a Cold Patch, will
that work?  I sthere something special about Kool patch or will any similar
product due.  Anyone have experiance with another product?
        My westy is originally form the south, rust free but the
undercoating is thin or even flaking off in big pieces.  I want to keep it
in order.
