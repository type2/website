Subject: Re: expensive heater boxes

&gt;914 heat exchangers, stainless or not, will not fit Type 4 van.  914 engine
&gt;is in the middle of the car, wrong way round (taking the van to be &quot;the way
&gt;God meant engines to face&quot;.)  

yup, Amen

The heads on VWs the 914 are reversible, ie. fit left or right side, so what 
points forward backwards on a 914 can be swapped to point backwards on a VW, 
IF it bolts in at all!. The side to side width may not fit ANY recognizable 
914 or VW muffler when installed in a VW, the flanges will line up nicely 
though. BUT (humble apologies) I have NOT done this, that's why the 
suggestion to phone Automotion for advice. It was bolt-to-bolt centre 
distance problems, rear valence clearances and heater junction box 
position/orientation that would really stymie this process. I can't tell 
about the heater air flow directions (in/out) in the small photo in the 
catalogue, if they're both on the same end this would be awkward to say the 
least. I've been desperate/frustrated enough to consider any potential 
stainless steel option for bus exchangers, since the prices are comparable. 
They rust out in &lt;5 years here, even though still exhaust tight through to 
the tailpipe. Sorry for any confusion about direct bolt-in possibility!
        As a small aside, a pair of European heater boxes I once bought, 
grey-market ones supposedly from Denmark, did not have the fittings for the 
auxilliary electric fan ducting, despite everything else being perfect. Not 
cold enough in Denmark!?
         Happy 1st. or 4th. depending on which side of the fence you're on. tjs
