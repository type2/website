Subject: FS: '80 Vanagon Stock Exhaust

Hi All,
        I am currently looking at an '80 Westy which has a *brand new*
stock-style *aftermarket* exhaust system on it, with less than 100 miles on
it.  The asking price for the van is currently a little bit too high for me
to be able to handle, but I could do it if I were to replace the stock
exhaust with a pacesetter muffler.  My question is &quot;anybody want to buy an
exhaust system?&quot;  When I priced one for an '82, it was ~$600, I would be
able to do this deal if I could get $400 for the stock system.  If $400 is
too steep, I'll take offers or suggestions on how I might be able to
provide this van with a new home.
Thanks,
Dave.
