&gt;        J.C. Whitney has Gens. for $54.95, V. Regs. for $11.95, shipping
&gt;will run about $10. Phone is (312) 431-6102. I recently found my gen for
&gt;$49 from Hi/Lo auto parts, v. reg for 15 from Western auto. Gen. came w/
&gt;lifetime warranty. I don't work for any of these guys, just like to find
&gt;deals on parts...

BEWARE the J.C. Whitney Voltage Regulator!  The one I bought two years ago
was a poorly made Taiwanese model that looked extremely light duty.  Before
I dared install it I first tried out the ignition coil I bought (from J.C.
Whitney also).  The brand new (non Bosch) ignition coil caused missing. I
replaced it with a used Bosch unit and the missing went away.  This led me
to conclude buying electrical stuff from Whitney is a waste of $$. YGWYPF.
YMMV.
