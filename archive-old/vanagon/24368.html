Subject: Re: _V_O_L_K_W_A_G_E_N_ emblem removal

Removal of said emblem was accomplished on the '67 &quot;westy resto from hell&quot;
via removal of the little clips located behind the hatch interior panel.
Once the clips were removed the emblem will slip right out/off. Replacing
the clips can be done through your local Ace hardware store. I even noticed
that HOME DEPOT carries these clips in the hardware aisle.

Micheal F asked:

&gt;I'm about to repaint the back hatch of my '72 Bus, and I'm wondering how
&gt;and if I may safely remove the _V_O_L_K_S_W_A_G_E_N_ emblem that's there
&gt;for subsequent post-paintjob replacement. I tried prying off the inside of
&gt;the hatch for an internal shot, but succeeded only in leaving marks on
&gt;that panel. If it snapped on/in to the hatch at one point, I fear that the
&gt;snaps are corroded. Anyone done this before? Any advice is appreciated!
