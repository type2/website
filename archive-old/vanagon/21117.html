Subject: HELP!!-Pricing for '87 VW Camper

I found one!!!  I need help on it's value and what to look for.

I have been wanting a VW Camper Van for over a year.  I just found out about
a '87 VW Camper van, GL model,  that is for sale 5 miles from my house in the
SF Bay Area.  It has only 39,500 miles on it has the pop top, fridge, stove
and sink, automatic transmission, air conditioning, cruise control.  It has
had only one owner and has been kept in the garage.

He is asking $19,500.  Seems like a lot to me.  Is it?  What would you expect
to pay?

I have never bought one of these before.  What questions should I ask about
the vehicle?

I am going to see it tonight.  Any help or suggestions would be GREATLY
appreciated.  Please email me directly at:

RScherber_at_aol_dot_com or 
RScherber_at_DLAccess_dot_com

Thanks,

Rhonda :-)
