John: I'm green with etc.  My '82 vanagon with nothing in it but the 
radio playing gets 11.5 mpg in San Francisco, admittedly not the highway. 
&gt;From what I gather, this may be about right (depressingly) for 
stop-and-go, congested urban driving in a hilly place.  Mine, of course, 
is aircooled but the engine is not dissimilar to yours, from what I 
understand. I have not had it out-of-town enough to get a fix on highway 
mileage.  Cheers, Art McGinn
