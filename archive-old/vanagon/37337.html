The reinforced tire has been recommended tire since 1964.  

I just had to buy 2 tires for my '77, and it gave me a headache.  The 
tire sales people seem to not really care what you're saying most of the 
time.  I had more than one tell me I didn't need a load range C tire.  
Well, I may not, but that's what recommneded, and that's what I'm asking 
for.  Of course I'm also poor, so I didn't feel like spending $100 for 
each tire.  I found that most tire places would only have 1 tire in the 
size range I needed, even the places that sell more than one brand.  

I was tempted to buy the Uniroyal Laredo at the PriceClub because the
price was right ($55), but the max load was a bit low for a load range C. 
I like how the Wrangler AT looks, but it's a bit pricey at $105 each. 
Most of the tires I found in local stores were in the $80-100 range.
I finally bought a pair from a place that knew right away what I was 
supposed to have, and offered a tire named Jupiter for $48.
It's a 185R14C, 1710 _at_ 50psi.  Seems to ride pretty well.

The catalog tire dealers in R&amp;T seem to have a good range of tires, for a 
lot less than the local tire dealers.  The next tires I buy may be from 
one of them.  This time I couldn't because the tread was seperating on 
one of my tires, so I didn't have time to wait for it to be mailed.
