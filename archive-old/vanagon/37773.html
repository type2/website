Hey all,
This morning my girlfriend and I drove from here (Fredericksburg, VA) to
Alexandria VA.  It's about an hour's drive.  I didn't see any buses on
I-95 on the way up but once we were in Alexandria, I saw three Westy
Vanagons within 5 minutes.  One was parked on the side of the road and
was VERY green and also looked to be in really good condition.  Another
one passed me going the other way, his was blue and also looked pretty
sharp.  Then another one passed me going the other way, it was white and
looked to be in pretty good shape, except he was having exhaust problems
(LOUD) and by the soot all over the back door, his was either diesel or
running way too rich.  Got a wave from all the ones that were running.

Keep on busin',
Sean

P.S.  Also saw one red EuroVan but it just wasn't the same ;)  (just
some flame bait for the EuroVan drivers ;)  -- Bill Killian, no need to
respond, it's just a little joke :) .

SET ASBESTOS SUIT = ON
