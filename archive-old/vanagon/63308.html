&gt; Hey Folks,
&gt;         I just signed back onto the list after a 2 month absence and I am
&gt; continuing my search for &quot;the perfect Westi&quot;.  There is a diesel for sale
&gt; in my area and it sounds very nice.  It has 100,000 miles on it with an
&gt; engine rebuild within the last 10,000 miles.  The fuel distributer and
&gt; alternator have been replace within the last 5000 miles.  The body sounds
&gt; great with little or no rust (it has been stored winters).  The interior
&gt; has a few stains and no rips. I have 2 questions:
&gt;
&gt;         1. What do list members think the general price range should be
&gt;         (Kelly Blue Book puts it around $4000)?
&gt;
&gt;         2. How difficult and expensive is it to put a gas power plant into
&gt;         the van if the diesel is to slow?
&gt;
&gt;         I really appreciate the time people take to answer my questions and
&gt; I hope to hear from you soon.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,

I have a 1984, Gl, Westy, Wolfburg in mint condition. The interior is
beautiful. The tables are all present and the Refrig works on
AC-DC-propane.  The body is tan over Brown.  It is in exellent
condition. It needs nothing other than a coolent change.  The AC has
been recently retrofitted to r132a and blows cold.   I am asking $8000
firm.  If you are serious about buying a mid 80s Vanagon, you will buy
this one when you see it.  I am located near Knoxville TN.  Drop me a
note or call. I have pictures if you would like to see them.

 The van has 64,000 original miles. The PO put a in new clutch, clutch
 master cylinder, and muffler. The power steering rack has been
replaced.
 It has recently had a tune up consisting of an oil change, plugs,
wires, distributor, and fuel filter.
         The canvas is in excellent condition.  The top seal has been
cleaned and reattached.  The shifter linkages were resently cleaned,
greased and re-adjusted.  The AM-FM cassettee player work well with no
static.
     Because the van is a Wolfsburg it has the third center passenger
seat.
 It will seat 6 with seat belts and 8 if they really like each other.
 The PO put new tires on the van about 2000 miles ago.   This van is
 beautiful.
           WHY am I selling?  I have found a Syncro Westy I would love
to have.
 My SO says 3 Vw at one time is enough.  I must sell one to bring home
 another.   This van is my 13 Vw, I don't buy junk and I maintain them
 like a fine piece of equipment that they are.
