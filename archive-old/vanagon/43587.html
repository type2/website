Subject: Re: '85 Temp. &quot;Warning Light of Doom&quot; - Question

In a message dated 96-06-03 22:18:16 EDT, you write:

&gt;I am under the impression that it is a single source of input -- that of the
&gt;coolant &quot;float&quot; in the main coolant tank.  If that's the case, mine needs
&gt;replacing, since it has gone into &quot;flash--pull over now&quot; mode without other
&gt;provocation twice in the past week.  I then religiously check the level of
&gt;coolant in the main and recovery tanks (both OK), and even check the
&gt;radiator bleed screw (no bubbles).  After I start up again, the light is
&gt;gone.
&gt;

To my knowledge the coolant level sensor probe is the only soruce that will
make the light come on.  Remember though that even a momentary drop in
coolant level will latch the light in the ON state and it will remain on
until after the coolant level rises back to normal AND the key is turned off.
