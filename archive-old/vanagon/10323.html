Your peadal will still have a lot of travel if the rear brakes aren't
properly adjusted.  I just did the wheel cyl's and shoes on the rear, blead
the brakes all around, and now the peadal is right tight, feels like new.

The emergency brake handle only moves 2-3 clicks now also.  Locks up good
and tight on hills.

I got the wheel cyls and the shoes for ~$13.00 each (39.00 total).  What a
bargain.
