Subject: Re: Privacy curtain in VW bus

I used a thin, flexible metal rod (probably 3/16&quot; diameter). I formed it 
to the countour of the roof and used in the inner seam where the roof and 
body meet to hold it in place. Got some fabric and made some curtains and 
it was done. I don't know if this will work on a '70, but on my '61 it's 
perfect and inexpensive.

&gt; 	Hi pholks.
&gt; This may be an answer to my own question regarding the curtains.  Saw a 
&gt; friends '70 in which he installed 1cm wide trim strips across the top of 
&gt; the ceiling just behind the front seats whith screws at the ends and the 
&gt; center only.  This made it possible for him to have two  normal curtains 
&gt; looped  on the trim wherin he could pull the two curtains to either side.
&gt; The curtains could be any length but only long enough to extend to the 
&gt; center.  Now that I think about in, it looks very similar to the curtains 
&gt; across the back window in my westy, except of course, the trim is 
&gt; bent to follow the arc of the roof.
&gt; 	I had thought of the curtains which extend around the side and 
&gt; front window but since I am living in mine, I wanted something simple 
&gt; that I could open and close quickly. Thus also I had seen and scrubbed 
&gt; the idea of snaps for the center curtain.   The front of my westy has become 
&gt; the green house and storage area.
&gt; 	I am going to try this perhaps next weekend and I will report my 
&gt; success and or failures.
