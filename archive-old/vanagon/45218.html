Subject:       Re: Can transmisson be rebuilt?

&gt; If you have a &quot;split-case bus&quot; like my '56, you can get an adapter 
&gt; put in a later transmission, otherwise known as a &quot;tunnel case.&quot;
&gt;

Thom, do you have the adapter?

A PO put a '67 in my '57 and I only have one problem:  The whole 
tranny is loose!  When I hit bumps I can feel it move around 
slightly.  The stick shift also lets me know.  You never know where 
you're going to find third and fourth.

I replaced the rubber mount but still have trouble.  Just curous 
about  your experience.

I sounds like I might end up doing this in my '59 if it has a locked 
tranny.
