&gt;  wrt the silver socket secret, there are few things of which we are sure:
&gt; they seem to appear only on aircooled westys built in 1980, 1981, 1982.
&gt; This in itself is baffling....Dc -- 
&gt; 
 
 My '74 Westfalia has a 12V silver socket beneath the glove box. The owners
 manual shows it in use, running the compressor that was included to fill the
 collapsible spare tire with which the vehicle was originally delivered.

 BTW, I was looking at the manual to see how the bus was named after 
 yesterdays discussion. It is referred to as the &quot;VW Campmobile&quot;. Although 
 the Westfalia name can be seen on the camper in the pictures, the only
 place that &quot;Westfalia&quot; appears in the owners manual in on the back cover.
