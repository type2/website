Subject: Re: Oil cooler for 81 (and 67) Westy

Wedston at Remuse_at_aol_dot_com was asking about installation locations of plate
type external oil coolers... inside or outside of the eng compartment?

Wes, this is the exact question that I have been tying to answer for weeks
relating to the '67 Westy project. In short, I have heard &quot;guru-expert&quot;
advice from both schools of thought relating not only to the oil cooler but
also the external oil filter.
Protection of the components seems to be one thought ~ inside the compartment.
Cooling of the oil is the other school~ outside of the compartment as long
as they are out of the *immediate* vacinity of the exhaust.

Actual location (available space) of the 72-pass Mesa cooler with the
electric fan is my problem. Folks are apted to say that they will fit up
above the rear axle half on the driver's side. I have tried everyway
possible to fit the items in this area to no avail. Investigation leads me
to believe that the recommendations actually come from Type I folks who run
J-tubes, not Type II folks with heaterboxes. I am tempted to ask them to
prove their point. ;-). Another suggestion boils down to some sort of
cutting of the metal in the driver's side battery tray coupled with some
sheet metal fabbing to create an exit port/dump for the hot air coming off
of the cooler. I'll be &quot;darned&quot; if I am going to cut anything on my '67 bus
at this point.
The same 50% of the &quot;experts&quot; consulted say that I shouldn't need the
cooler. The other 50% say &quot;Congratulations on building a motor that's going
to seize in two months with out it.&quot;

I am frustrated to the point of where I am tempted to cop out and simply
install a stock DP with dog house and drive the silly thing. Admittedly,
it's may be (or is) a matter of the VW Peter Principal in my case. I need
answers also!
