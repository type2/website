&gt; Unfortunately I did not receive the recall notice. I purchased my Westy
on Mar
&gt; 30, 1995 and immediately sent in the 'change of ownership' card to VWoA.
After
&gt; the fire loss I called to check on recalls and found:
&gt; 
&gt; They do not bother to change the ownership records until a new owner
calls in
&gt; with a problem. In my case it was TOO LATE!
&gt; 
&gt; They denied that there had EVER been a recall of ANY KIND on my Westy.
But data
&gt; I now have show that this in not the case - there appear to have been 2
recalls
&gt; 
&gt; 	If you have either the recall notice and/or the paperwork on the
&gt; repair and would be willing to send me a xerox/FAX of these I would
greatly 
&gt; appreciate it.
&gt; 
&gt; Thankx -

&gt; &gt; Hello Kenyon.  I have a '90 Syncro Westy and I had my vehicle in for 
&gt; &gt; a recall in spring of 1995 to get the fuel injectors and components 
&gt; &gt; replaced.  This recall (campaign RV) was to do with an engine miss 
&gt; &gt; and cold start problems, not fire.  
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; VW changed the following:  fuel injectors, connecting fuel 
&gt; &gt; distribution rails, fuel lines, hoses and clamps. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Did your vehicle have this recall done prior to the fire?  
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Sorry to hear about your loss.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Harry. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; PLEASE - if you have experienced any problem with the clamp/O ring
assembly or
&gt; &gt; &gt; fuel injectors on your '91 Vanagon - contact me with your
information.
