Subject: bicycle racks

Does anybody have any suggestions for bicycle racks for a '77 Westfalia??  I
spoke to a VW dealer, and they didn't have a clue.  I'd prefer the type that
attaches to the rear door.  Any comments as to increase in fuel consumption
with these bike racks, especially on long trips ?
