Subject: WTB: Nose Bra for 76
Date: Wed, 21 Aug 1996 11:04:40 -0600 (MDT)

Hello again Volks,

I am looking for a black nose bra for my 76 Westy.  Of course, it has the high mounted 
signal lights (72 and later).  The antenna is mounted on the drivers side and is just a 
single hole mount.  Anyone out there have one they don't want/need/like??  I could 
arrange shipping if so.  I know that RMMW has them, but they're too expensive given 
the fact that the CDN dollar sucks.

Also, I need the little metal plate that fits on the outside of a Westy where the external 
AC power cord comes out.  I'n not sure what years will fit it tho'.  I currently have a 
dish towel stuffed in the hole to keep dirt and water out of there.  Anyone??  Please 
e-mail direct as I'n not on V_at_L and I get type2 in digest.  Thanks.
