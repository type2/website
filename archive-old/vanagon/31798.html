Subject: coil over shock info 


      Hey there folks.
             Well here it is.  Type II '68-'79 (that's all I checked, mine's
a '72) take rear shocks of the same dimensions, so these SHOULD work on
those years with a few modifications.  Well here goes with a few specs.

              original                                coil-over 
    
lenghth ext.  22.875&quot;                                   22.5&quot;
   collapsed   13.5&quot;                                    13.375&quot;
mount hole dia  12mm                                    5/8&quot;

      Well as you can see the length difference shouldn't have any
significant impact on they're installation.  The diameter of the mounting
holes are the same top and bottom on both shocks so a couple small sleeves
should solve that.  And guess what, the sleeves on the shocks that were on
my bus (although a real chore to remove and install) fit nicely.  Now for
the biggest but still relatively minor problem.  Since the shock has a coil
spring around it, it's approx. 1&quot; larger in diameter and wouldn't clear some
sheet metal down there in the nether regions.  Fortunately a spacer about
1/2&quot; thick slid on before the shock solved that.   Remember to put one top
and bottom to keep the geometry correct.  It left me with about a half a
thread showing but why would you possibly need more than a full nut's worth
of threads?  You wouldn't.  I hope this helps all your draggin' ass buses.
By the by,  as I mentioned earlier I manage a FLAPS here in Florida. I sell
these for $30.81 ea.  You should be able to get them for that at any larger
auto parts store. They list for $73.95 ea  and installer price is $45.31 ea.
The price I quoted is jobber price and smaller stores may be reluctant to
sell them that cheap because some may pay that themselves.  
                   Happy hoisting,
                        Doug
