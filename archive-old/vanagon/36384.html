&gt; Here's what I'm looking at : 1963, the owner says its a deluxe but it
&gt; has no sunroof or windows on the roof. It does have all the side windows
&gt; including corners. Not a walk thru so I'm guessing it was a nine
&gt; passenger???

That would be a &quot;corner-window deluxe&quot; or &quot;15-window deluxe&quot;

&gt; The rear seats are gone, but the interior panels are all there. The
&gt; exterior is rust FREE but the rear wheelwells have been cut out, It also
&gt; has the deluxe trim on it.

How about the cargo floors, can floors, battery compartment, etc?

&gt; No motor, no rear bumper.

Bumper and motor are easy to get.  The trim for the bumper is trickier.

&gt; He's at $1000 and I'm pretty sure he's not gonna move.
&gt; This bus is located in rusty Pa. so getting a rust free body without
&gt; traveling a zillion miles is a big plus BUT what about those wheelwells??

Check out the Das Bulli Haus page: they have the wheel wells, and you can
weld them in.  http://www_dot_calweb_dot_com/~thom/dasbulli.html
