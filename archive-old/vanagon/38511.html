Subject: Redline MTL for '88

Finally tracked down some Redline MTL for both my '88 Westy and my 
'85 Jetta TD at:

Gorge Performance Parts, Victoria BC
380-1457

They were $13.50CDN, but I got 5 qts for $ 11.50 each.

Since I'm familiar with the Jetta tranny, I did that last night. The 
old synthetic which I put in 145K ago was now a deep golden brown colour 
- it was nearly clear when I put it in. The Redline looked more like 
power steering fluid going in - red &amp; thin. Drove it this morning - 
it was frosty and about 2 degC - no more crunch in 2nd gear!! The 
shift movement was much smoother engaging gears. The only crunch I 
did get was going into 1st while still moving ahead, which I've always 
had. The 2nd gear crunch was replaced by a slight stiffness when 
cold, but no crunch! Since my Jetta tranny now has 345,000 km on it I'm 
very impressed. The only thing it did not cure was a bearing growl in 
neutral when I let the clutch out, which I suspect is the release 
bearing. Oh well...

I'm hoping to do the bus Friday if all goes well. One question: how 
much clearance is there above the filler hole on an '88 tranny? Will I need  
to be creative with a spout to get the oil in? (and no, I don't want 
to cut a hole in the floor of the bus... ;-))

Ok, one more question: While at a local wrecker whom I trust quite 
well, he told me it would be a good idea to drop the tranny &amp; bring 
it in to a shop (not his) to have the front (rear of tranny, front of 
bus) bearing replaced. He said it's about $100 pts, $ 100 labour if I 
bring in the tranny, and could save me from major grief if this 
bearing goes... It is making a good whining noise now (with 160K km 
on it), so this does sound reasonable. Anyone else heard similar (or 
contrary) advice?

Shawn
