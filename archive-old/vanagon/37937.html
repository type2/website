&gt; It's a sad day when you gotta worry about sh*t like that.  I'm a native
&gt; German, and I gotta tell you, I had tears (of laughter, that is) running
&gt; down my cheek when I read your translation.  Actually, every time I read
&gt; one of your translations.

My last one, the Spanish one, got forwarded to somewhere and I received
a nasty flame from sombody who I've never seen post here, and who obviously
didn't understand the lightheartedness of my translations.

I know I don't have to include the disclaimer for anybody here's sake, 
but when these things get forwarded, it's possible for it to be seen
by someone who just doesn't know the relationship shared by our list,
and doesn't understand that you can poke fun at things without 
putting them down.

Sorry all, I seem to have begun ranting.
