Subject: Tach for '84 

Hi Folks - has anyone tried to retrofit the tach from the &gt;85 vans into 
an '84?  My '84 has a clock where it SHOULD have a tach; said clock has 
inset fuel and wassertemp gauges (at 6 and 12 o'clock, respectively). I 
notice from Bentley that my fuel gauge (at least) has a different scale 
factor than the &gt;85 guage and that the cluster has a different harness, 
not to mention Bentley doesn't show my temp gauge... in short, it 
doesn't look like the drop-in that I had hoped for.  Has anyone done it?
