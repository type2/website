&gt;Subject: Leaky head info needed

I was bopping arount the WWW looking for water cooled vanagon head gasket
leak info and got errors when accessing the &quot;Technical tips&quot; on &quot;Leaking 
head gaskets&quot; and &quot;More head gasket leaks...&quot;.  The error said the
file did not exist.  Can someone e-mail me these files.

Also, does anyone have the text for the Vanagon Tech Bullitin on
&quot;Cylinder Head Re-Seal (1.9L and 2.1L)&quot;?  The Bullitin number is 15-90-T01.

Thanks,
