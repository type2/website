Hi Chris &amp; list 

Well just that, instead of a slidingdoor a door will give you more space inside or what!
and why not use a door from a crewcab????

Joel gave me inspiration to another thing, why not make a slide out thing ??????
for about a meter or so, like the big trailers 

Remember this is my first wv camper, before you FOTCL : )
      

&gt; &lt;&lt; In the fear of getting lynched, has anyone installed doors instead of the
&gt; slidingdoor????       &gt;&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; How? and Why??
