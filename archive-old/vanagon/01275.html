Subject: Re: loose wipers


I had a similar problem with my 86 GTI, I got a couple of thin washers
and a 1&quot; section of copper wire (18 ga). I removed the wiper arm, then
stripped off the insullation from the wire. Next I spread the wire
along 1/2 of the hole inside the wiper arm. I then put the arm back on
the wiper shaft, placed a couple of thin washers on top of the arm
and tightened the whole thing down.

It worked for two years (through snow, rain and rallies) until I decided
to break down and get new wiper shafts and arms.
