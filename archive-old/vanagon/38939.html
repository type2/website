Subject: Re: rusted brake bleeder valves

Try a 6 point deep socket, it will be less likley to round off the valve.
Failing that, use WD-40 and a big vise-grip or a pipe wrench to really
torque it.  Be careful not to bend the valve, it will break! The valve will
probably be damaged after all that abuse so have access to new ones to
replace them with. Good Luck

PS is that Paris Texas or Paris France?


&gt;Hi,
&gt;        following advice from experts on the list, I have
&gt;changed the hoses that lead to the front calipers. However,
&gt;I can't bleed the brakes because the valves are rusted in
&gt;place. Trying to open them with a 7mm wrench, the wrench
&gt;eventually turned around the piece.. Does someone have a
&gt;gpood idea how I can resolve this? I have to get it done
&gt;tomorrow because I need the van to pick up friends in
&gt;Paris on Friday!
&gt;Thanks a million!
