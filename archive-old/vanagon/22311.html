Richard,

Apparently, one of the sermons you've attributed to me (Heater Cable
Replacement) was written by someone else.  As a matter of fact, I don't
recall writing anything about heater cables.

If the person who sent me a rather rude message pointing out the error would
care to identify themselves to the net I will be happy to make a public
apology for what I'm sure was an innocent clerical error.

Otherwise, stick a sock in it.

-Bob
