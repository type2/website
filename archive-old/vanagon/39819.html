After having sat back and read the news on this list for about a month, I
have a couple of questions that I haven't seen touched yet.  Maybe somebody
out there can help me out, so here goes:

1.  We are planning on driving our '80 Westfalia from Ontario to Inuvik this
summer and at some point joining up with the rest of the gang from the Top
of The World Tour.  As much of the road from Dawson to Inuvik is unpaved, is
it a good idea to fabricate a stone guard to protect the gas tank, or is it
really unnecessary?

2.  I've checked the Battery FAQ but still haven't been able to come up with
the answer to this next question.  I want to install a second battery in the
compartment under the driver's seat.  What is the best way to hook it
up....through a battery isolator or through a battery selector switch or is
there some other way that I'm not considering.

3.  Tires!!  I'm still somewhat confused.  I understand that a reinforced
tire is the only way to go.  What is the recommended size, based on handling
characteristics and performance?  Should I go to something with a larger
footprint, ie. 205/75R14, a good idea...what are the plain english pros and
cons??

I know the last two questions have been kicked around over and over again.
I've probably missed the specific answers to my questions somewhere in the FAQ
files but bear with me.  Any direction is appreciated :)
