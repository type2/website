I am thinking about:

Oil Pressure Gauge
Oil Temp Gauge
Coolant Temp Gauge
Head Temp Gauge
Exhaust Temp Gauge
Oil Level Gauge
Air-Fuel Mixture Gauge
Remote Tire Pressure Gauge

Beer Inventory Gauge		(stashometer)
Beer Carbonation Gauge		(fizzometer)
Beer Temperature Gauge		(Chillinometer)
Beer Quality Gauge..Schmidt all the way to Red Hook	(calibratable as 
							the night 
							progresses)
Driver Stress Level, (skin temp, heart rate)
&quot;Are we having fun yet&quot; funometer gauge
Decibel Meter for parties in quiet campgrounds with mean rangers gauge
On-Line Stock ticker fed wirelessly through CDPD wireless modem
Loran
GPS
Moving Map with full color monitor
Remote camera to monitor rate of head (engine and human)leakage 


  OK I'm done.

This way you can feel like you are driving the control room to a 
nuclear power plant instead of your bus.  TGIF
