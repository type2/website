Subject: Re: time vs. rpm vs. wear 

Speed does affect Wasserboxer Engine Life.  Actual testing with installed
gouges and infrared scanners has proven to me that oil temparature increases
proportionally to speed and load.  Vanagon _at_ 70mph = oil temp 170+ degrees F.
 Filling engine 1/2 quart low lowers temp.  I use a 16 plate oil cooler and
thermstat to keep oil temp under 220*F.  2.1 liter engines have water cooled
oil cooler,(between filter and case). This works fairly well until 60 or 65
mph, no A/C.  When engine is shutdown,  high oil temp will heat up water in
engine due to no circulation. This contributes to gasket problems.  After
extended high speed run,  let engine idle to cool oil and heads.  Low temp
fan switch will help keep pressure off cooling system.  I can get these for
you.
