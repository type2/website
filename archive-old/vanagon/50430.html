&gt;When we purchased our Vanagon a few months ago noticed how the passenger side
&gt;mirror would slowly head south.  It keeps its adjustment about the X &amp; Y axis
&gt;but loses altitude on the Z axis.  Every couple hundred miles you have to get
&gt;out and pull the mirror back from its drooping position.  The drivers side
&gt;mirror is another story.  On a trip to Colorado we noticed that the mirror
&gt;doubles as a 75 mph indicator.  When you hit 75mph the mirror folds back
&gt;against the door.

Hi - I wrote a fix-it article ref this (common) problem a few months ago;
basically a hex fitting is pulling out of the mirror proper (has a thread on
the other end that goes thru the part that attaches to the bus &amp; tightens
with a hex nut.  The short description fix is to press the fitting back into
the mirror, cross-drill thru the whole mess, &amp; install a SST roll or dowel pin.
