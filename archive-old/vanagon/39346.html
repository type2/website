On school buses....Claraw_at_aol_dot_com, you mentioned you saw a school bus 
with a VW Bus welded on top?  What show did you see that at?  A good 
friend of mine used to tour in her '63 Kombi and mentioned that school 
bus was quite the setup!  Funny that it pops up again....I hadn't heard 
anything about it in at least a few years!

I've seen a number of them.  There was a medium length one with a green and
blue paint job last summer, with a 64-67 on top,   in spring a few years ago
a long grey one with a bullet turn signal bus on top,  Ive seen them with two
on top,  and with a bubble window and a split on top,   one facing each way.
 At S.I.R. last year i saw a red one that a guy in canada had just done, he
said he was going to hook up the buses wipers and running
lights................
