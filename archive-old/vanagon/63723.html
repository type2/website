Subject: Change the Stats Joel: GTI Westy Replaces Syncro Westy :-)
Date: Mon, 11 Aug 1997 18:44:36 -0400

Just wanted to let everyone know I've taken a few steps back and sold the
87' syncro Westy and just purchased an 82' GTI Westy. Man is this a sweet
ride. I bought the van fron the owner of Streetsboro Foreign Auto in
Streetsboro Ohio. He built the van for his retired father, who gave it back
after he found he didn't use it all that much. The engine had only 25000
miles on it. The trans is from an 82' aircooled van and is well suited for
the GTI power. Elmar says he's done over 20 of these conversions over the
years and from the looks of the engine compartment it shows. The intake and
fuel system is from an 80 rabbit (CIS) and the exhaust is strictly diesel.
It passed EPA inspection after the conversion (it has a cat.), but I won't
need to get it checked because it qualifies as a motorhome, which we don't
need to check here in Ohio. 

If anyone is going to be at the Bugfest in Cincinnati Aug 16th or the
Gatlinburg show in Tennessee Aug 23&amp;24 or Busses By the Arch, make sure you
stop by and say hi. I'm working on providing a live internet telecast from
the BBTA show in honor of Charlie Ford and his travels. If you havn't heard
of Charlie you should check out the Type2 archives and read up on him. He's
out there doing what alot of use wish we had the guts to do. I met him at
the Columbus show and he is a real nice guy. One of those people with
personalities you just can't forget. More on the live telecast after I talk
with the cellular ISP. 

I'm working on revamping my websight and should have things settled this
week. I want to get some pics of the GTI setup online soon, but first I
have to ship a package out to this Karl guy in texas who I've been treating
like a chump lately.
Later.
