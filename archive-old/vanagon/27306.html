Subject: The '80 Vanagon is no more.

Well... the body is now in several large pieces in the driveway.  If 
anyone want the engine hatch as an extra for that Porsche conversion let 
me know now, it going to the Scrap bin tomorrow.  Along with the rear 
suspension, including the drums.  So if anyone wants these parts, this is 
your last chance.  

I feel bad that I cut up this Van, but at least other people are making 
thier buses better with the parts.  I already gave someone the side panel 
from the Van, so I hope it works out for him.  In taking this thing apart 
I've spent about 30 hours cutting and stripping, I didn't really keep 
track of the time.  I also used up 12 Sawzall blades ($12), and 7 metal 
blades for the Skill saw ($17).  And a bunch of trips to the scrap yard 
to drop off parts of the bus.

Here's a few other parts that are available, I'll put out the full list 
in a few days with prices.  If I didn't list the part you want here or 
the other short lists I put out, then it's spoken for, or I'm scraping it.
(Or I forgot)

Left tail light 
Right front parking light 
Pedal assy.
horn
Master clutch cylinder
Front emergency brake cable (dlr only)
Emergency brake handle assy
Speedo cable, upper and lower (and the weird box in the middle)
Right front suspension
