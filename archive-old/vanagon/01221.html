 Hi,

&gt; I've been wondering about something, and I figure that this group can =
&gt; help if anyone can. I've got a '76 Campmobile (&quot;The Loaf&quot;) and =
&gt; I'm wondering if there are such things as Diesel 4x4 Campmobiles.=20

 Yes, there are. Unfortunately I don't know if there are many in the Americas.

 There are even turbodiesel synchro westfalias (drool...) in the UK, and
elsewhere in Europe, too, I'm sure.

 There must be *some* in the US, I doubt that they were ever imported, though
(Joel?) but some may have been persionally shipped and it must be possible to
get conversions done. It'd be a project just to find one though, let alone to
keep it running. Canada? Dunno. They seem to have a healthier attitude to cars
there, though.

 I think the only breadloaf 4x4's were experimental. Diesel transporters came
to the UK in about 1982 and I think the synchros wern't far behind. I think
it'd be about 1984 or so before you could get a turbodiesel synchro but that's
a guess.

Cheers,
        W.
