Subject:  re:Bus as primary residence...

what about showers? (i don't even know martha, but i know she is
thinking about this).  seriously, i have been thinking of doing this next
spring to save some $ after i move to wherever it is that i'm going (job,
please).  i'm thinking of going somewhere and paying someone i know
meager change (cause that's all i have right now) to utilize their
driveway (plug-in included, hopefully) and shower facilities.  since i'm a
pretty decent and creative cook, and i love to share food i have prepared
with folks, i could also prepare healthy vegetarian meals for them as
partial compensation.  i would also be willing to tend a small garden for
the production of household vegetables.  now i'm getting carried away,
but this would be pretty much the ideal situation.  any takers in oregon?
