Subject: RE: Lousy idle and sneaky booster leaks

Dave Kautz points out correctly that your vacuum leak may be far from the
engine, but you can confirm or eliminate the brake system without digging
into the dash:  disconnect and plug the engine end of the vacuum line (white
plastic hose in extreme northwest corner of engine compartment).
