&gt; &gt; It works on the same principle as the hokah pipe.  and it uses a 20% 
&gt; &gt; alcohol mixture.  I plan to install one in my bus as soon as I get the 
&gt; &gt; chance.  I used one in my pinto and it did give me a little gas mileage

&gt; &gt; don't know.  I'll do up a drawing and post it somewhere appropriate. 


       Hi  gang! 
          I  have  not  been  reading  in  details  what  the  subject  
is  all  about, but  a  mixture  of  water/alcohol  injection  is  use  
in  the  military  version  C-130's   series.  Is  a  turbo  prop  4  
engines  airplane  use  for  cargo.  Normaly  they  used  just  for  
take  off.  Providing  more  cooling  at  full  power  settings.
