&gt;&gt;&gt;     I've got an 85 Westy, and I'm curious if anyone's every cut out
&gt;&gt;&gt; the 'luggage rack' and installed a sunroof on one of these. I don't
&gt;&gt;&gt; need the extra space, and it would make summer driving a hell of a lot
&gt;&gt;&gt; better (no AC). Does this make any sense or is there some problem that
&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm overlooking?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Michael, I saw a Westfalia Vanagon last summer that had a sunroof AND  
&gt;&gt;the luggage rack in front. The owner had cut a square out of the center 
&gt;&gt;of the luggage rack and put in one of those glass/removable sunroofs. It 
&gt;&gt;wasn't a very sano installation, but not noticeable unless you looked in 
&gt;&gt;from above.

I put an aftermarket sunroof into the front 1/4 of the raisable shell.
The sunroof has a crank which pops up the back portion and then slides
the glass 2/3 of the way back.  The crank can be reached from the
driver's seat so it's convenient to operate while underway.  Helps
ventilation a lot and you can get to stuff that may be on the roof
racks.  For rainy climates, this solution is not as good as the stock VW
vent because you can't leave it open more than a bit without getting
water inside.
