We're approaching the same point but through mileage not age (bought it 
as new in late '94), so we too are interested in this.

I'm getting real unhappy with the sound of the engine as it starts in the 
morning.  The local dealer swears that it isn't that 'piston slapping 
thing'.  They claim that it is only if the sound is always present 
contradicting the information posted here earlier.  Is the piston slp 
problem a drive train thing that would give me extra time or is it only 
under the 24/24 bumper to bumper?  What do I do to convince the dealer 
to reasses the engine?

Only things we've ad problems with so far are the various plastic pieces 
particularly on the MV jump seats.  The clips break off and the seatbelt 
parts scratch them.  We also had one of the cup holders break and the 
replacement was slightly different - beefier looking so I hope it holds 
up better.  Don't have power windows so we didn't have that problem.  We 
have (unfortunately) an automatic so does the shifter problem pertain 
only to sticks?  There was a recall that did affect us but I can't 
remember what it was.  Something minor like an engine fire problem &lt;g&gt;.

I really do feel this is an exceptionally well designed vehicle (despite 
the '90s levels of plastic).
