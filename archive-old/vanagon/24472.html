Subject: Bob's trip (D+3?) Addendum

Bob made it my apartment at about noon today.
Dropped off his motor, enough tools to manufacture a bus from scratch,
and some candy for my understanding wife. :)
Loaded everything up in my (untested, not-really-charging-a-battery-yet)
`72 standard bus. We'll go down to his `67 on Tuesday, and start work.
You kow how you get a preconceived picture of how people are going to look
before you even see them? Well, Bob pretty much matched what I _thought_
he was going to look like. Eerie.
