Subject: Swivel seat sticker

Hey you all:
I found this really cool VW original sticker (No. 253010043) in a local
VW mechanic/fanatic. It goes with any Vanagon with swivel seats:

&quot;WARNUNG! Drehsitz wahrend der
 Fahrt nur in Fahrtrichtung benutzen.
 N'utiliser le siege pivotant que dans le sens
 de marche pendant le deplacement du vehicule.
 Swivel seat must be in forward
 facing position while driving.&quot;
I am not sure if this is a rare item, but if anyone is interested, the
guy has about 6 of them, grey, about the size of a driver license. I put
mine on the center console,towards the passenger side, and it looks very
nice and original. They have the VW logo and a diagram of a front seat.
He sells them for 2.65 each. Let me know. Obviously, I don't have any
monetary interest in this...
Cris.
