Subject: Re intro

Hello all, I would like to welcome myself back.  I graduated from college
in May and have been without a net for a few months....
I am Larry Stivers now living in Columbus Ohio, I like to wave at all the
Type 2 people here but none wave back (except that couple in the Eurovan
Westy)  Me- I am on the net for group therapy due to the fact that i own a
85 Westy(tan)- and I am headed towards clutch of the month club, too.  
Q:  Ya'll have frequent trouble with &quot;throttle switches&quot;?  Trusty local
repair shop said I need them, I switched to higher octane.
Q2: My steering has developed the shakes at highway speed, what is that?
(I had an alignment 6+ months ago-do I need another or is it worse?)

Jim Kirk, of Indy, Had did the trip through this way and further back east
work out?

There is a VW show in Metro Columbus on the 12 of August, but I don't know
where, someone please advise.

peace
Larry &quot;Wha 'cha mean I need another______?&quot; Stivers
