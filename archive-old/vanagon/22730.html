Rusty,
	I pulled my '67 apart before I shipped it to New Zealand from 
Southern California.  I had owned the bus for 6 years at tis time and 
found the occasional hand rolled and papers.  During the tear down, I 
found two pretty nice pipes but no bags or sheets of paper with funny 
stamps on them.  I recently shipped it back and did another tear down for 
US Customs.  I found nothing and they didn't look.  Gary Gibson  Found 
lots of change and lost pocket knives, mine!
