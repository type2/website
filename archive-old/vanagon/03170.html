This morning topped it off...

  As still a &quot;rookie&quot; owner, I have been learning more and more
about NuBus' ('82) affect on other drivers. IT DRIVES THEM INSAAAANNEE.

  I live in the dairy country outside of Syracuse NY, so I drive
country roads most of the time. I have noticed that people cannot
stand to be behind me, no matter how fast I go. 

  Even when I am bumper to bumper with the car in front of me,
people behind me will pass, even going as far as crossing
double yellow lines to do it. NuBus brings out the NYC-driver
in everybody.

Two theories

 1)Its a bunker-burner, and people can't stand the diesel exhaust

 2)People can't see over or around it. I actually see them driving
   straddling the double yellow line in my side mirror.

 3)People get *very* frustrated over slow acceleration. (Hey, I make
   it to &quot;speed_limit+5&quot;, but it takes a little while to get there)

So now I find myself spending time looking *behind* me so I can pull
over when I see Mario Andretti trying to pass. I figure they are going 
pass anyway, I might as well make it easy. Then I can follow them
RIGHT ON THEIR REAR BUMPER (since thay are never going *faster* than
I am, and they usually slow down once they pass) Sort of a Vanagon Enema.

p.s. Yes, I am originally from NYC, where commuting is a competitive contact
sport.
