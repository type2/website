Subject: How  to remove torsion arms, bearings?

The first step on the agenda for my new 73 bus is removing and welding the
brackets on the front torsion tubes.

Getting the front end out was been a little more complex than I
anticipated.  As someone else mentioned, taking these things apart is a
little like peeling an onion.  Fortunately - and suprisingly for a 20 year
old vehicle -  nothing was impossibly rusted.  To get the torsion tube
assembly out I had to disconnect the drag link to the steering arm, the
shift rod linkages, the clutch cable, the master cylinder and the wheel
calipers.  I also removed the rotors before dropping what remained of the
front end.  In any case, a lot of this stuff needed overhauling anyway.
For example, the shift rod busings are completely worn - the bus has that
'omnishift' feeling.

So now the front axle is sitting on my workmate.  I have removed the tie
rod arms and 3 out of 4 ball joints.  The bolt on ball joint number 4 is
very stubborn - I have to find a longer pipe!  My bentley manual has not
yet arrived from JCW so I have a couple of questions for the experts:

1.  How do I remove the sway bar?  The nuts came off OK, but the bolts are
intractable.

2.  How do I remove the torsion arms, bars, and bearings.  Muir indicates
that the torsion arms should just slide out after loosening the set screws
in the center of the torsion tubes and on the torsion arms.  I did this and
(suprise!)  - no sliding.  Is it time for Mr. Sledge Hammer?  How about the
needle bearings - do I need a special extractor to get these out?

Thanks for any and all replies.
