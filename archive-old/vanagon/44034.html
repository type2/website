My family enjoy the great fun of busing around the continent in a very
bright 'hippy' green '76 westfalia.
  The only problem left to be solved (because I think I've had all of
them!) is the fact that the kids will all soon be hearing impaired if we
can't reduce the amount of NOISE inside the camper when we're driving on
our merry way. Does anyone out there have some practical advice short of
installing a subaru engine !!!
  I've tried thick carpets thick undercoating etc.   The thing could still
be used for a Pink Floyd Tour amplifier box.
  Thanks alot................Eddy. (going deaf)
