Subject: FAQ site?

hey now,

anyone know the address for the FAQ? i figure alot of the questions i have
could be answered by that....i might even tackle something as complicated
sounding as adjusting the valves or doing the timing once i read up on it.
;-) i hope these things become everyday chores...sure sounds like ya need to
be a certified mechanic! :-)

learning...and learning...and learning....
