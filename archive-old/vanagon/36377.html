&gt; Been frustrated with not only the EV's problems, but the daughter's
&gt; Volvo has a rough idle and surges that the damned Chilton manual is poor at
&gt; helping me solve.

Repairing fuel system related problems on modern spark ignition 
automotive engines can be a nightmare. The manual is often not detailed
enough on all the sensors and electronics. A good source of information
is the emmission tuneup specifications. See for instance &quot;Mitchells&quot;
tuneup guide. You should be able to find this one in a good library
and copy the sections related to your EV (and your daughters Volvo).
