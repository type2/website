Subject: Re: T-SHIRTS /flames

&gt;High quality 100% cotton t-shirts, of a natural, earth-tone.
&gt;5 color screen print design, featuring front views of all 4 generations
&gt;of transporters, as well as &quot;NETVERGNU:GEN&quot;, and the list address in


Hey, can I get one with a big red circle and bar over the Eurovan? &lt;eg&gt;
that's &lt;evil grin&gt; ;&gt;

Whee, it's flame bait time. Must be near friday, I'm getting giddy.

PS: for some fun, scan the rec.outdoors.rvs news group.  Good discussion 
regarding the shipping of young boys across state lines in motorhome storage
