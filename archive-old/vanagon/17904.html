&gt; 
&gt; As far as the salesman being upset, let me ask this question: Is it better
&gt; to have an upset salesperson or $1000 in your pocket. Obviously, that is
&gt; a non brainer. So the salesman was upset. Big deal. Would he have been 
&gt; upset if you were upset because he was able to gouge another $1000 out
&gt; of you? I think not.
&gt; 
Whew, haggling over thousands of dollars for car prices. 
That discount is more than the total price I've ever paid for a bus!
:)
Ah, those loveble, drivable, antiques!
