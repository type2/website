&lt;&lt; &gt; hey todd -
 &gt; does your TriStar have the plastic fender flares, AND the fiberglass
rocker
 &gt; moulding??
 &gt;
 &gt; let me know asap.
 &gt; thanks

 Hi The Tristar has black plastic fender flares and is painted flat black
 on the bottom (from the lower body crease or groove that goes down the
 side that is 8&quot; up from the bottom)(burgandy top)instead of the bolt on
 rocker mouldings. Looks good. I need to get some pictures taken so I can
 send them on the web.
