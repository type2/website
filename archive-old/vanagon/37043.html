Eeeeek! What are all those &quot;=20&quot;s in your message?

About the Syncro &amp; driveshaft:  I think that not having the driveshaft in
might slightly (very silghtly) increase the wear on the Syncro's viscous
coupling.  In normal operation both sides of the coupling are rotated at the
same speed, the back side from the transmission &amp; the front side by the front
wheels.  By not having the driveshaft installed, the viscous coupling would
need to keep the coupling's input shaft rotating and this might add a
slightly greater strain on the coupling.  I think the only fuel milage gained
would be by not carrying the weight of the driveshaft - probably about .001
mpg.
