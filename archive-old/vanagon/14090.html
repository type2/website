Subject: Tires:Bridges603/Yoko370

Hi, if anyone has either of these tires could you describe the tread pattern 
for me. The dealers here don't know exactly what's what.  ie. Yoko is 
'ribbed', well, so am I FWIW! Any other 8ply tires out there, barring 
Gislaved (sp?) which I can't get here. TIA   tim s.
