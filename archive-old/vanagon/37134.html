Subject: Westfalia Stove Part Needed!

Dear Listmembers--
I'm in dire need of the stove valve that operates the right-hand burner for
an '84 or later Westy camper. The brass stem that the plastic knob fits onto
is broken on mine (this is the part that rotates).
Anyone who know of an organ donor stove?
