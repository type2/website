David,

&gt; &gt; First, I couldn't rebuild mine for $35 apiece because it's the $hafts that
&gt; &gt; need to be rebuilt, and that can't be done with a kit, but only by a
&gt; &gt; carb machine shop (so I'm told).  
&gt; 
&gt; It was $35 for both, and for that price, it couldn't hurt.
&gt; The throttle plate assembly that you are referring to is separate from
&gt; the carb, and can be taken in to a machine shop to have a bushing
&gt; replaced rather cheaply.  I think my local shop was gonna do mine for
&gt; $40 each.  Instead, I hit the junkyards and found some real good ones for
&gt; a couple of dollars each.  I think I even got a couple extra ones, which
&gt; I might be persuaded to part with, since you *do* have a Safare, and all :)

Is this an actual offer?  I'd love it if you could make it that easy on me.
I still have to get the rebuild kit and do the rebuild, but I would really
appreciate it if you were willing to part with a couple of these guys.
I wouldn't have the foggiest idea if what I might me able to find in a
junkyard would still have enough life left in them, and it would certainly
save me some time looking.  If this was purely in jest, could you please
advise me as to what to look for as far as wear.  I'm trying to spend as
little as possible on the bus right now so I can afford some not-so-
desperately-needed photographic equipment.

Also, could you advise me on the best place to get a rebuild kit and
(briefly) what this will entail for a newbie as far as time and effort?
I do have both the Muir book and the Bentley book (a bookstore up here had
it *in stock*), so I'm just looking for an overview as well as any
important details that they omit.

Thanks!
