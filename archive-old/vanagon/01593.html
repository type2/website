&gt;Well, I'm determined to take my new '60 bus 175 miles
&gt;south of the border for 5 days later this month.  My
&gt;  e) I'm bringing tons of surf gear, long/short boards, coolers, water
&gt;     tent, sleeping bags, chairs, so how much extra bus care (oil) stuff
&gt;     do I really need?  What are some crucial 'don't go without' items?

Take one of those $15 ding repair kits - nothing like being stuck in BFE with
a hole in your board!

Take some of that Fix-a-Flat stuff.  Its saved my butt a couple of times.

I also use those &quot;soft racks&quot; that clip onto the rain gutters, so I can 
_secure_ the board to the roof when I crash for the night.  Sometime boards
can grow legs and wings (like when its windy)
