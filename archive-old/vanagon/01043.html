Subject:      bentley manuals

by all means check out several different places to get the vanagon or bus
bentley manuals ... if you order from Bentley, it will cost you a bundle.
likewise, a lot of dealers will charge you retail (or more). however, SOME
vw dealer parts depts. will sell it cheaper. so check around. check the ads

these are by no means the ONLY people who sell the books, just the ones that
advertised in those magazines. and some of them don't have the same ad in each
magazine, so you have to look in at least two.  it helps to SEE one of the
books, so you can decide whether you want to get one. but my feeling is that
if you are planning on keeping the car and working on it yourself, you'd be
well rewarded for the money spent. besides, it's kinda fun to look through an
anatomy book for your bus. :)
