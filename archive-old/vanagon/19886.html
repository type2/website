Subject:       Re: Blowing coolant hoses.

Dan said:
&gt; &gt;blowing out is getting combustion pressure into the cooling system 
&gt; &gt;and popping 'em off.  been there, done that in a rabbit diesel.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;head gaskets would be the likely culprit. sorry.
&gt; &gt;
then Tim said:
&gt; thought about this too, pressure cap should blow off pressure at 15psi or 
&gt; so, anyone verified a pressure cap malfunction. You should blow your coolant 
&gt; into the overflow tank, along with gasses.... anyone know if this tank 
&gt; breathes? It should!  tim s
&gt; 
and back to Dan:
2 things:  One, the cap may very well be malfunctioning (and that 
COULD even be the ONLY problem) and not releasing either normal 
pressure or combustion leakage.

the other:  assuming the cap is working, that coolant overflow tank 
cap  has a rubber gasket in it.  i think it seals fairly tight, being 
designed for accepting just a &quot;burp&quot; of pressure from the cap 
overflow, not a continuous amount.  But the construction of the 
overflow certainly isn't meant for very high pressure and maybe that 
would burst before a hose would if the cap was working normally.  
Maybe it is just a bad cap.

Lets think positive and cheap...  buy a new cap first.
Start at the dealership right off when looking for a cap.  NOBODY 
(yes, i'm danming myself to be wrong) will have a cap for the new 
wasserboxers, say 85 and up.  they are only around $12.
