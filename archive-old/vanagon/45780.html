Subject: max wading depth  

Hi,
I've got an 88 SYNCRO. The handbook just says that the max depth or wading
depth is 350mm or just over a foot.
Has anyone got experience fording rivers or knows how to extend the maximum
depth. I'd love to cross some rivers which may have a depth of up to 2 feet.  

Any help would be appreciated.
Cheerio
