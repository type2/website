Subject: What's going on with Michelin?
Date: Thu, 28 Jul 94 14:24:30 PDT

I hope someone can answer this.  I need to front tires for
my '91 GL and have been to the local Michelin shop here in
Sacramento.  He says the tires for the vanagon 205/70 R MXL's
(reinforced) are on back order and can only be ordered 2 at
a time.  Has anyone else had problems getting these tires?
Is there a good substitute?  I vaguely remember reading something
about Continentals.
