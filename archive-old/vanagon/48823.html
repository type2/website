Subject: !!!!!TRI STAR!!!!!:HI  change the stats!

 
&gt;Hi all:
   Today was a very good day! I finally took possesion of a 91 Tri Star. A
month or so ago I posted a message about it for sale in the Portland,OR.
paper. I didn't call about it because I was getting ready for the Inuvik
trip and I didn't think I could afford it anyway. Well, the trip was cut
short because of various problems and I came home and read the postings from
people who had seen it for sale at the Portland and Seattle VW meets. I
hadn't seen one yet and decided I wanted to look at it and I remembered The
posting I had sent to the list that had the guys number on it. I looked in
trash and still had the message, called the guy, looked at it, had to have
it. There was a problem with the title that took a couple of weeks to
straighten out and today finally got everything together.
It's in very nice shape, burgendy in color with grey interior. It's pretty
well loaded with power windows,locks and mirrors. It even has seat heaters.
I havn't seen many crew cab Vanagons, but have been told that most of them
are 3 door like the old ones, but this one is a 4 door. For the next few
nights you'll find me out in the shop detailing it.
