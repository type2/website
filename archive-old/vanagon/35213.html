Subject: gas heater fuel pump needed
Date: Tue, 13 Feb 1996 09:57:55 -0700
From: Dieter Dworkin Muller &lt;dworkin_at_village_dot_org&gt;


Well, I've had two different shops tell me I need a fuel pump for my
gas heater (Eberspacher BN4).  I suspect the first shop managed to
break the pump, since the problem I asked them to look at originally
was that it heated fine, but the fan would sometimes never cut out.
In any case, does anyone have any ideas on where to find a fuel pump
for this guy?

Thanks.
