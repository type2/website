Subject: Rear Windshield wiper

Hi

I just got my '89 Westy out of storage for the spring.

I bought it last fall and drove it straight into storage.  When I
bought it, the rear windshield wiper didn't work, but it does
spray fluid when I try it.

I opened up the panel on the back hatch and discovered that the motor
was fried.  The brushes fell out in my hand.  I took the whole 
mechanism out and took the motor off the actuator.  I called a
VW dealer to ask about replacing JUST the motor.  They said &quot;Sure,
no problem.  You can buy just the motor&quot;  How much?  $204.30 + 15%
tax.  Ouch!

Does anyone know of a place in the Montreal area (or by mail) where
I could get one for significantly less?  

Thanks

Kedar
