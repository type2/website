Subject: Re: Cuttin' a big ole hole in my roof...


&gt;	My quesion:  How is the Westy reinforced to allow for (1) loss of
&gt;structural integrity due to the gaping absence of roof, and (2) the weight of
&gt;the upper bunk to be supported by the remaining bits of roof?
&gt;
&gt;	One bodyshop has already agreed to cut the hole for me; I just want
&gt;to make sure I don't do anything unsound here.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;--Dale

Although I haven't done a Vanagon, I have fitted pop-tops to three Bay 
window buses. The original Westfalia camper was based on a factory sunroof 
model that already has reinforcement and a handy hole. But the aftermarket 
conversions just cut a big hole and reinforced the edges with a frame of 
steel tube or angle. If your wrecked bus has a sunroof hole you are in business.

The first roof I fitted was from a wrecked Westfalia and I cut out the 
sunroof section and grafted it into my bus, with some plates to tie the 
edges of the hole to the rail running round the inside of the roof. With 
hindsight I wouldn't have bothered with the sunroof section, although it 
does make the finished job look tidy. The roof is pretty solid as long as 
you leave the cross members alone. The roof just needs reinforcing at the 
mounting points for the bed, etc. The other two roofs (rooves??) were Devon 
types which need a bigger hole and removal of the crossmembers. I just 
dollied the edge of the metal to form a lip (this is how Devon do it) and 
welded in some 1&quot; tube between the front and rear crossmembers. I could sit 
on the roof and it wouldn't flex. 
I have heard that VW do not condone cutting out the roof cross members on 
Vanagons, unless they are replaced. This is why most Vanagon campers (at 
least in Europe) have solid high-tops which have replacement cross members 
built in. This isn't a problem with the Westfalia roof as it was designed to 
fit over the smaller sunroof opening. 
It can be done, as long as you think before you cut anything. Just mail me 
direct if you want any details.
