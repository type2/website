I subscribed 4 days ago and had not checked my mail. I was very
surprised to find 101 new messages. 2 weeks ago I had the luck to run
across an 89 gl camper at the local used car dealer. This is a guy whom
I had previously bought a car from and I also do their computer work. I
noticed it was sitting in the rear of the lot and was looking a little
haggard. So I went in and inquired about it. Turns out this van has 47k
original miles, the interior is still scotch guard hard and looks like
they were real easy miles. The whole thing is currently involved in an
estate settlement it has appearently sat somewhere for a while. I was
salavating as I inspected the interior and exterior of the van. A little
elbow grease and this thing would almost look new..Anyway I turned to
&quot;the&quot; information source to find as much as I could on this thing, and I
must say this has been an exciting 2 weeks. 
ps
the van is still in probate and I have already accumalated a wish list.
