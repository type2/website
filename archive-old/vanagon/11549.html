&gt; Well, Patrick, it depends on how recently you ate spinach and Wheaties.

A tougher question is how long does it take to *close* the pop top? Its
always hard to get those folds tucked in, the screen neatly folded and the
bedding if any above flat enough. Plus there is that chance of it not
being closed properly and driving away or worse not closing it at all and
driving away.... DC
