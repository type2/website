Subject: re:  Free(?) VW History Book

I called the vw ag #  (1-800-444-8987)  and they did indeed say they'd send a
history book.   Also a video.   Also there is a commemorative piece of
artwork (subtle ad?)   showing  a split screen bus with a tear coming out of
one headlight,  and 'Jerry Garcia,  1942-1995'.   

 Isn't that sweet?   I'm amazed that VWOA  is associating themselves with the
whole Deadhead/alternative/hippy scene.   But hey,   what do you all think of
when you think of a splitscreen?    Why did I see dozens at the last show I
saw in Oakland?   Why was Bob's tale of rescuing Grendel so riviting?  Is it
a coincidence that the bus was painted psychedelic and had traveled far?
  This is the stuff our modern day fairy tales are made of.   (Buses from the
Schwartzwald made by elves?)  We can free our minds and make our dreams come
true.    
            
         put put put......
