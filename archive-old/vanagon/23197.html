&gt; i just got an excellent deal on a 1974 Vw Bus with a rebuilt engine...for $300
&gt; from my roomate...excellent shape. i'm psyched, it's my first vw. there are a
&gt; few things that need to be done....right now i'm working on the cv boots.
&gt; 
&gt; 1) I can get the boots themselves for $9.00 from an auto parts store. or i can
&gt; get a 'kit' with the clamps, bolts (tho i don't know why they would give me
&gt; bolts), one boot and the grease needed. this doesn't seem like a deal for
&gt; $18.95. should i replace the bolts to the cv joint itself if they look okay?

     I seem to recall that somewhere in my notes from this
     list is stern advice to REPLACE the bolts and avoid
     disasters when they're not welcome. And how often is that?

&gt; 2) The right rear joint came off easy. not so on the other side. i've got two
&gt; #$%_at_!&amp;! bolts that seem to be frozen. i was straining on one and kind of
&gt; stripped the head of one bolt...the head is still there but the ratchet doesn't
&gt; fit anymore. then i tried with some vise grips. no give. then i tried
&gt; saturating it with WD40. no give. any suggestions? i'm guessing if i can't get

     Soak 'em in WD40, wait five minute, take something suitable
     and give them one distinct, concise tap each. Wait thirty seconds.
     Try it again. I haven't tried it with CVs but with more than 
     one other recalcitrant bolt...

&gt; is there any other way to clean up the ball barings and the cv joint itself
&gt; without using gasoline? i don't have a great way of disposing gasoline...

     If you use gasoline, keep in mind that it and fluids like it
     pour right into your body and bloodstream, they see you as
     being a relatively porous entity and walk in like ghosts.
     This is not a healthy thing. I read somewhere that gasoline
     explodes and burns, to boot.
