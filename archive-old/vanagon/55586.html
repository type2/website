&gt;You'll find a plug at the bottom of the case.  Open it and the transmission
fluid will drain

You'll find the plugs well corroded into place, you'll need a 17mm Allen
wrench or some similar tool.  BEFORE you dump the oil make sure you can get
the upper filling hole plug out!!  Otherwise you will be SOOL.  I use a
cheap pump from Crappy Tire/FLAPS to get the oil in, 75W90 Castrol from
KMart works fine. There is no easy way to get oil in other than the pump,
unless you like oil down your arms, all over the tranny, in the drive, and
you want to spent 1/2hr fighting it.  Buy the pump.   bye, tim
