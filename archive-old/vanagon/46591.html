&lt;&lt; I have two 2 1/16&quot; VDO guages that are about to go into the dash of my
 '71 bus.  The OD of the gauges is 2 1/32&quot;.  The hardware store has 
 hole saws of 2&quot; and 2 1/16&quot;.  Is the later too large?  What have the 
 rest of you used? &gt;&gt;

Jim -

Use the 2 1/16&quot; hole saw.  Remember 1/32&quot; is half of 1/16&quot;.  You'll do fine.
