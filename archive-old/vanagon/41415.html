Subject: Help with installing windows needed please

Howdy,

Working on the '69 Westy this weekend try8ing to put the windows back in.
Got rubber on the window glass.  Tried to put it back.  It does not want to
go.  I don't mean just the interior lip.  I mean the whole top half of the
friggin' window!  We beat on that thing for close to 2 hours and STILL
could not get it all the way in.  How does one install windows?  Am I
missing something?

Please help!
