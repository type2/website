Rainer etc.,

If you are lucky, that small leak that you have left is the culprit.  This 
leak breaks the coolant recovery system.  However, it is possible that 
there is a head gasket leak that is allowing excessive combustion gasses 
into the cooling system.

I recommend that you fix the leak first and repeat the bleed process.

Mike
