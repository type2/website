Subject: Plug gap &amp; CDI

In response to inquiries about my set-up on the CDI Tiger 581
This is how I ran it with the CDI.
1600DP engine in '71 bus
Stock dist., dwell 25 deg. on my 8cyl. dwell meter.
Timing 5deg. BTDC
Plug gap.increased to  .040

The engine ran great before...didn't after putting in the CDI (less responsive)
and today after going back to my points I can verify it ...quick throttle is 
back!

Go figure....(and I know I wired it properly...not that hard)
