Hey all,
I've got a couple more questions about the Dometic fridge in my '81
Westy.  This past weekend I did a &quot;test-run&quot; of the fridge to make sure
it was up to the upcoming camping trip.  Well, with outside temperatures
in the 40s and inside temperatures probably in the high 60s to low 70s
(electric heater) the fridge inside temperature was hovering between 40
and 50 degrees F.  This was with the temperature control turned to max.
I would hope and assume that the fridge would be able to get below those
temperatures with that kind of ambient temp, especially with the
thermostat control on max.  When I put my hand over the grille inside
the van, between the counter and the wall, I could feel the heat from
the fridge.  It seemed pretty warm, as you would expect.  However, I
think the fan that is mounted back on the coils should have come on.
This fan didn't come on at all when the fridge was running.

Today I did a little detective work and discovered that when I bridge
the contacts on the thermo-switch for the fan, the fan does not come
on :-( .  This leads me to believe that either the fan is bad or I have
a bad ground somewhere.  FWIW, the LED control panel is disconnected (I
pulled the plug at the rear of the panel) but I looked in the wiring
diagram and did not see a connection between the LED panel wiring and
the fridge fan wiring.  Perhaps someone else can check that for me.

Basically, here's the deal.  There is a yellow wire that runs to the
switch and is powered 12v all the time.  I tested this wire and found it
to be live.  The wire connects to one contact on the switch and the
other contact on the switch also has a yellow wire, which continues down
to the fan motor.  The thermo-switch is mounted on the fins at the rear
of the fridge.  Does anyone know the temperature at which this switch is
activated?  

Anyway, the yellow wire supplies 12v to the fan motor, and then a blue
wire runs from the fan motor back out (this is ground), then plugs into
a 3-point connector which is visible if you open the under-sink cabinet
door.  The blue wire is connected via the connector to two black wires
which presumably run to ground.  That's kinda where I lose it because
it's unclear to me from the wiring diagram what goes on from there.  The
other points in this connector are two red wires, one of which goes off
to power the LED panel and the other carries the 12v to the yellow wire
which goes to the thermo-switch.  These red wires are, of course, live.
Then there's a white wire which connects to a brown wire, and I haven't
determined their purposes yet.  

What gets confusing is that the two black wires connected to the blue
wire plunge int a wiring sheath.  Coming out of the sheath are two
smaller sheaths, one of which goes to the connector for the LED panel
and has two black wires and one goes to the sink pump switch at the
faucet with two black wires.  

If anyone can check the camper wiring diagram in their Bentley or Haynes
(remember, '81 Westy) and confirm or deny my analysis, I'd really
appreciate it.  I fear that without the fan working, the fridge is not
working as efficiently as possible.  I'll be carrying some perishables
with me on the camping trip and I want them to stay fresh.  I'm tempted
to just pull the fridge and sort out this mess for myself, so how long
does that typically take?  

How long does it normally take or when does your fridge fan (the one
mounted on the coils at th rear of the fridge) come on?  Am I worrying
needlessly?  

Any and all help is appreciated,
Sean
