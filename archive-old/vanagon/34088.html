Subject: Re: solar panels for van (long)

     &quot;CB&quot;,
     
     Glad to hear from you.  
     
     In your message there seemed to be a vague implication that I was 
     talking about electric heat.  I hope not.  Didn't mean to.  It would 
     take more PV panels and batteries than your van could carry to provide 
     reliable electric heat - - and they would cost much more than your van 
     is worth.  What I meant was electric power for the combustion air and 
     air circulating fan on a propane-fired heater.    
     
     I've since sold it (didn't fit into our current lifestyle - was paying 
     too much to store it), but what I had was a poptop tent camper 
     trailer.  It had a large Sears Diehard Marine Battery that was 
     connected to the towing vehicle (F*rd Truck) via an RV battery 
     isolator.  (I strongly recommend these, BTW, if you have multiple 
     battery setups.)  This setup was supposed to charge the camper battery 
     and run the 3-way refrigerator from the F*rd alternator when the 
     camper was being towed.  (We were never exactly sure how much charging 
     actually went on.)  The camper had a variety of 12V appliances 
     including lights, 3-way refrigerator, propane heater, and electric 
     water pump.  The heater was (I believe) a 6000 BtuH Dometic unit that 
     featured forced draft combustion and fan circulation in the camper.  
     It had a &quot;sail switch&quot; - a flapper in the combustion air stream that 
     would close a normally open microswitch, allowing power to flow to the 
     propane gas solenoid valve.  The sequence of operation went like this:
     
        1)  Thermostat senses temperature too low
        2)  Fan starts
        3)  Sail switch senses air flow OK to burner
        4)  Gas solenoid valve opens (assuming pilot light on, etc.)
        5)  Burner fires up
        6)  Camper heats up
        7)  Thermostat senses temperature OK
        8)  Burner and fan stop
      
     At any rate, when we first got the camper and started using it, we had 
     trouble running the heater more than about 2 nights.  Even if we 
     avoided using the lights, the battery would just get too run down at 
     about dawn on the second day to run the furnace fan fast enough to 
     actuate the sail switch.  This was typically in Wyoming high country 
     where it gets pretty cold at night.  And it was a bummer on three day 
     weekends.  
     
     The only solution we had at the time was to back the truck up to the 
     camper, plug in the electrical hookup and run the truck engine to 
     re-charge the camper battery.  Not a very efficient or effective 
     solution!  On a couple of trips, I borrowed a small gasoline-driven 
     generator and used it to recharge the battery.  I found this to be a 
     pin in the posterior, not to mention very contrary to the reason I 
     went up in the woods to start with.  
     
     Eventually, I came up with the idea of using a photovoltaic (PV) 
     panel.  I'm not sure where or how.  I think it was when I read an 
     article about solar power for isolated cabins, etc. in a sort of 
     back-to-the-woods alternative lifestyle magazine I found while sitting 
     around the waiting room at my wife's chiropractor.  It occurred to me 
     that this was a potential solution to my problem.  So I started 
     looking into it.  
     
     Had a hard time finding panels (I was still in Western WY at the time 
     - not quite the edge of the earth, but you can see it from there!)  I 
     eventually located a company called PhotoComm in Denver that handles 
     the panels and a variety of related equipment.  I got the panel from 
     them.  It cost around $400 (ouch!) - but this compared favorably with 
     the cost of small gasoline generators at the time.  Especially since 
     the panel would produce no noise and no pollution. 
     
     I never really &quot;installed&quot; the PV panel on the camper.  I used a 
     couple of pieces of aluminum angle for standoffs and just clamped it 
     to the roof of the camper before I raised it to the &quot;up&quot; position 
     (It's a poptop, remember?) at our campsite.  Used a piece of an old 
     heavy duty extension cord and a female trailer hookup fitting to 
     connect to the panel to the camper's electrical system (via the male 
     fitting already on the trailer).  
     
     It worked great!  We used to leave on camping trips with the camper 
     battery fully charged, and as long as there was any sunshine at all, 
     we could depend on the furnace continuing to work well for three or 
     four nights easy - and more, given good sunlight and reasonably 
     temperate nights.  Never really gave it the &quot;acid test&quot; - the longest 
     we ever used the camper was 5 nights.  It was quiet - just sat up on 
     top of the camper and did its job.  In typical situations, there was a 
     bit loss of charge every night than could be made up during the day, 
     but it worked!  I consider it to be one of the best recreational 
     equipment investments I have made.  I still have the panel and will 
     keep it, pending purchase of another (VW) camper some day (when the 
     kids are gone).   
     
     ENGINEERING NOTES - -  
     
     This is to the best of my memory - some of the details may be 
     incorrect or obsolete  -  PV panels come in two types - 
     self-regulating and non-self-regulating. 
     
     The non-self-regulating types are intended for use in large, fixed, 
     multiple unit installations with a controller unit that controls the 
     amount of current going to the battery pack and to the load, etc.  The 
     non-self-regulating panels have lower internal resistance, higher open 
     circuit voltage, and are slightly more efficient than the 
     self-regulating panels; but - if used without a controller - they will 
     definitely overcharge the batteries to which they are connected.  
     
     The self-regulating type has higher internal resistance, lower open 
     circuit voltage, and is slightly less efficient; but they will not 
     ususally overcharge batteries.  In an RV application like this, you 
     want the self-regulating type.  You can just hook 'em up and you don't 
     have to buy a controller.  
     
     When you wire it up, oversize the wiring two or three sizes (why lose 
     expensive PV power to resistance from small cheap wires) and make sure 
     you fuse the panel approriately.  Make sure you have a good, 
     corrosion-free ground and that all your connections are weatherproof.  
     Frequent inspection of your camper electrical system will help keep it 
     trouble free.  In my experience poor grounding due to corrosion and 
     loose fasteners is the most common problem.  Corrosion in connectors 
     on the positive side is also a factor.  Both of these are compounded 
     if your wiring is run underneath the vehicle - exposed to weather and 
     mechanical hazards.  These things are a lot easier to cure in the 
     driveway than at 2:00 am at some remote campsite.
     
     Installation - -
     
     You don't want to install PV panels flush with the top of your camper. 
     They're flat black in color and get d*mn hot when exposed to the sun.  
     If installed flush, the heat will build up beneath them - reducing 
     electric production efficiency, degrading the PV materials, and 
     possibly damaging the top of your van.  I would suggest that at least 
     an inch of standoff is appropriate.  A couple of friends of mine use 
     PV panels on their camper vans.  One has fabricated an adaptor that 
     allows the panel to be held by his Yakima ski rack.  Another just lays 
     his panel across the factory-installed luggage rack and uses bungee 
     cords to hold it down.  
     
     Speaking of that, you definitely need to have some kind of a hold-down 
     to keep PV panels where you want them, unless your area is wind-free.  
     If you intend to permanently install them on a camper van, obviously 
     they'll have to be substantially secured to the van roof.
     
     Using multiple panels - 
     
     I have engineered some multiple panel fixed installations in isolated 
     locations where it was deemed appropriate.  But it seems to me that in 
     a camper van application that one quickly reaches a point of 
     diminishing returns.  After all,  the PV panels aren't cheap, and a 
     secondary means of charging the camper battery is inherent in the 
     van's engine and alternator - even if it is inefficient.  It really  
     depends on your particular needs.  
     
     -  If you're traveling in the van daily, you don't need a power 
        alternative at all - just let the alternator charge up the camper 
        battery.
     
     -  If you plan to take basically weekend trips, one panel should be 
        sufficient to supplement your fully charged RV battery. 
     
     -  If you plan to park the van in one place and camp in it for a long  
        while in a location where sunshine is intermittant, you might 
        benefit from more than one panel.  But I doubt it.  You'll mostly 
        fully charge your battery early and your (expensive) panels will    
        sit around the rest of the day with nothing to do - unless you add  
        another battery, which starts this whole cycle up again.  You 
        should start the van up once in a while anyway, so why not let it 
        run a while and charge the batteries.     
     
     Using more than one battery - -
     
     -  Unless you are quite religious about starting your van frequently 
        to charge up its single battery, you should have a separate RV deep 
        cycle battery with a battery isolation setup - (you can get at any 
        decent RV dealer).  Almost nothing is worse than waking up in the 
        morning to a dead battery (I know, believe me).
     
     Battery Safety Note - -
     
     -  Batteries produce hydrogen gas when charging.  Hydrogen gas can 
        easily build up to explosive concentrations and can easily be set 
        off by a spark or open flame.  If your camper battery is inside the 
        van, it should be vented to outside.  Battery boxes, flex hoses, 
        and exterior vent fittings are available at RV and automotive 
        dealers.
     
     Using more than two batteries - -          
     
     -  Unless you wanna set up a communications base station (like Bob 
        Hoover has described (see http://www.sky_dot_net/~rmk/hoover/) or have 
        other LARGE electrical needs, more batteries are likely to be a    
        detriment rather than a plus.  You will pay for the extra weight 
        every time you fill up with gas.  And you can't just hook 'em up in 
        parallel - since you never get back ALL the electricity you put 
        into a battery - - your losses at the bottom end of the charge will 
        double.  In many ways, one fully charged battery is worth more than 
        two half charged ones.  Isolators for multiple battery    
        installations are available, but not at every RV place and they get 
        pretty pricey. 
     
     Alternative Possibility - -
     
     -  Gravity heater - these are often seen in smaller, well-insulated 
        hard-wall camper trailers and pickup-mounted campers.  These 
        heaters use millivolt controls, driven by a thermocouple heated by 
        the pilot light.They do not have a circulating fan - they depend on 
        natural convection to circulate the warm air inside your camper.  
        They also depend on natural draft to supply combustion air - so 
        their capacity is limited.  But so is the volume inside a VW    
        camper.
     
        The lack of fans and the use of millivolt controls means that these 
        heaters require no 12v electicity.  Hence, no battery and no 
        requirement for supplementary power.  
     
        If you were to insulate the heck out of a VW van (see Hoover's 
        sermons, URL as above), and maybe add some insulated curtains with 
        velcro strips to hold them to the windows, you could probably get
        away with using one of these heaters.  It wouldn't be as fast or as     
        effective as a fan-driven heater, but it would keep the chill off.  We 
        used to use one of these heaters in a friend's trailer on late fall 
        hunting trips.  It was really nice to come in after a long cold day and 
        find the trailer toasty warm. 

        Find a good RV dealer who will let you look thru his propane appliance 
        catalogs and see what you think.  If the need for a furnace is the only 
        thing that's driving you to install a camper battery and all the rest, 
        this may be a more appropriate solution.  

     Don't hesitate to e-mail me if you have further specific questions.  I'm 
     not sure how long I'm going to be at this address (funding problems seem 
     likely to effect my employment) so also email to:  rdyd26a_at_prodigy_dot_com 
     
     Since this summarizes answers to questions others have asked, I'm also 
     going to post it to the list as well.

Hi,
  A friend passed along your note on supplementing van power with pv panels. 
Did you say a single 50 watt self-regulating panel can provide for 5-6 day's 
auxillary power needs, including heating.  If so, I'm interested in what kind 
of heater you are using and the storage set-up
     
Thanks!
