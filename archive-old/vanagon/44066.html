&gt;I am trying to install a cruise control (from Sun Distributing) on my '89
&gt;Westy and I cannot find a way to connect the actuator cable to the throttle.
&gt;It seems like it would be easy, however, there is no place w/in 18&quot; of the
&gt;throttle to fix the cable sheath.  

When I installed cruise in my 87 Syncro I routed the cable from the throttle
forward &amp; toward the passenger side so that it came near the firewall.  Near
that point I installed a large bracket on the top/left engine/transmission
bolt so that I would have something to anchor the cable to.  You should be
able to find something suitable at the hardware store to make a bracket from.

&gt;From thisd attachment point the cable curves toward the left/rear area of the
engine compartment.  I mounted the actuator in the space just forward of the
left tail light.

Good Luck,
