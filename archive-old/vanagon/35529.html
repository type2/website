&gt; &gt;         I don't know about &quot;not reliable&quot;. Seems to me that a car is only

&gt; &gt; half-fixes to a car for 20 years, and it will become very unreliable. If

&gt; I strongly agree with this sentiment.  I get sick of hearing people laugh
&gt; about how they always see VWs on the side of the road.  Well gee, I wonder
&gt; why?  Of course you don't see other older cars on the side of the road
&gt; because they couldn't even make it that far.  They all went through the
&gt; crusher already.

Hey!  I'm THERE!  I've rebuilt carburetors on the side of the freeway
(cleaned them with WD-40, that is) at least 6 times in the last 20 years
because the PO of my 67 bus must have never put more than a couple of
dollars of gas in the aquarium at a time.  Lots of rust flakes made past
the fuel pump filter and that damned cheap clear plastic filter (I KNOW
most of you folks have [are?] used[ing] these!) and clogged the carb jets.
Once, all I had was a church key!  Couldn't get the carb of the manifold,
but managed to take the cover off and clean it that way!  Never more than
15 minutes on the side of the road each time.  What with all the licorice
whips they put under the hoods of cars these days, just getting TO the carb
(or FI) would take oodles of magnitude longer than that!

Keep them old buses running!
