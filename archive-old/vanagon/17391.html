Subject: The Bus Stop, torque wrenches, type IV parts,  buying a bus

	I've had very good service from The Bus Stop- call
and ask for Shelly. Tell them you have lots of friends. Give
them one more chance, but let us know what happens too. Fie on
them for sending you bad stuff!


	I've got a pointer-type torque wrench, and my experience
with my 914's type IV filter-screen bolt was that I torqued it up
to 8, 9 ? foot-pounds and it went about 210 degrees at that torque before
it started tightening up and I stopped. It leaked until I went
through this exercise. NEVER over-torque the screen bolt- it apparently
pulls on something really tender in there and all the 914-heads advise
working up to the correct torque very gingerly. It was a job that
a pointer type wrench is perfect for.

	On the subject of type IVs, the Porsche dealers had German-
made oil-change kits, two copper washers, plated with some white metal
(Silver?) and two REALLY thick gaskets, for about $1.93, while the
local VW aftermarket places sold Brazillian kits for about $2.75
with plain copper washers and thinner gaskets, last time I was
in the market. Having seen their sales drop to 4 figure numbers,
Porsche went through and rolled some heads in the parts pricing
area a few years ago. Type IV owners might try comparison shopping
for factory maintenance parts.

	Ian has one of those super slick spiral spring oil filter removal
tools which worked well on my type IV. I bought one of the big spring-band-
which-snaps-onto-your-socket-wrench-extension oil filter wrenches and it
worked well also. That one's a bear to get off without a good tool.

	On the subject of which torque wrench I wouldn't use, I try
not to own 'bad' tools. A good click type does its job using simple
physical principles, as does a good pointer type. Click type are
a LOT cooler, but in that great 1961 factory tour video of the
Porsche factory, every torque wrench you see is a pointer type,
so I figure they're not tools of the Devil or anything that bad.
I was poor when I bought my first torque wrench, and I still have it.


Scott wants to buy a bus and wonders if there's a good guide.
Answer: For my money, the Idiot's book has a good rap on buying
a used car, not the only way to go but a good one. I recomend
the Haynes manual for what a messy old bus really looks like too.
Finally, isn't there a DIY book from England that just came out?
