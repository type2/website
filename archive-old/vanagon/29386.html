Subject: CA buses for sale in the SF Examiner

I was bored at work today, so I started looking at the paper that was 
laying there.  I couldn't find the comics, so I read what was there, the 
classified ads.  I was going to bring it home and post the interesting 
ones, but I forgot, so I'll recount the ones I remember.  There were 
probably over 20 advertised.

'93 Eurovan Westy, $18,500
'65 crewcab, $3200 (I'd gladly trade my '66 and '72 for this)
A couple '90 Westys in the $10k+ range, I think one was $19k

Sorry I don't have phone numbers and stuff.  I don't subscribe to the 
examiner.

Bradley
