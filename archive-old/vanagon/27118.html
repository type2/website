&gt;I got my '79 for $150 (it runs, not well, but it runs) and my '67 for $300
&gt;(it runs, too) so it definitely pays to shop around!  There always seems to
&gt;be a lot of busses for sale in the VA/DC area, maybe you should road-trip up
&gt;here and shop...

i think i forgot to tell the list that i found a good condition 1970
westfalia camper, that ran, for $300.. it was amazing (it was located in
Springfield, VA).  My friend and i were going to split the cost and buy it,
but we had no place to store it.  His little brother bought it; a sophmore
in high school, with a camper, lucky. With my pristine '85 for $2800, and
this 1970, it was the summer of the great bus deals!
