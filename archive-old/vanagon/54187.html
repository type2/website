Subject: Re: NEED HELP Olympian Catalytic heater installation

Mark,
I've go the product information for the propane regulator on my '89 Westy.
The  regulator on my '89 is a Marshall Brass 260-00 Series One Piece Two
Stage Regulator.  The specifications say that the regulator is set for a
nominal 11&quot; water column.  The maximum capacity for the regulator is
240,000 BTU per hour.  I hope this helps.

I'm wondering if your catalytic heater is jetted for propane.  Maybe that's
the problem.  Or maybe it's just so effing cold there that you'd have to
set yourself on fire to warm up.  

I know that I have a 23,000 BTU kerosene heater that will warm an entire
uninsulated house up to a comfortable temperature in a fairly short time.
That's with outside temperatures around 20-30 deg F.  Hope this helps.

BTW, I've scanned all of the propane documentation that came with my '89
and I'm in the process of mailing it to Gerald Skerbitz so that he can post
it on the web site.

Regards,

&gt;Hello from frozen Montana,
&gt;
&gt;I purchased an Olympian 6100a catalytic heater yesterday.  I installed it in
&gt;my Westy, but I'm dissatisfied with it's performance.  
&gt;
&gt;To install the heater, I placed a flared t at junction where the gas was
&gt;coupled to my stove unit.  Part of the t included a swivel type extender.
&gt;B/c of the swivel the connection dropped from a 3/8 to 1/4 for that
&gt;particular fitting.  From the T, I ran 6ft. of 3/8 inch flexible hose that I
&gt;had the local propane co. fabricate.    Approximate length of the hose is 6
&gt;feet.  The install was extremely easy.  
&gt;HOWEVER, I'm still cold.  .
&gt;
&gt;The owner heater manual says &quot;the heater is designed to operate with a
&gt;manifold pressure(the gas pressure down stream from the appliance controls)
&gt;of 10.5&quot; w.c.(0.38 psig). A gas supply pressure of 11&quot; w.c. (0.40 psig)
&gt;minimum is required at the heater controls.  The supply line must be
&gt;equipped at the cylinder with a listed regulator set to deliver the
&gt;specified pressure.&quot;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Questions.
&gt;Is the regulator on my bus the proper size regulator?  1980 VW vanagon Westy
&gt;
&gt;  Is the swivel fitting that reduces the t from 3/8 to 1/4 causing a loss in
&gt;pressure? 
&gt;
&gt;The heater has a maximum output of 5,800 BTU/hr.  Is this adequate for
&gt;heating the interior of the bus?
&gt;
&gt;Any and all info would be beneficial....thanks for the time...
&gt;
&gt;Mark
