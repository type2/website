Subject: Re:  Bugtop

&gt;You wouldn't believe...uh..strike that...maybe you would....Anyway, on the way
&gt;back to Santa Rosa from San Francisco today (I drive a bread route)I caught a
&gt;glimpse of the most amazing thing:  No, it wasn't a Thing, but it sure was
&gt;wierd!
&gt;
&gt;This particular beastie looked to be a breadloaf bus, garishly painted (looked
&gt;good!) with the top of a Bug welded on.....rear first, and all windows
&gt;intact.
&gt;This strange creation whizzed by the other direction to quickly for me to
&gt;get a
&gt;good look, but from what I could see, it was cool!

        Well, I just watched an old movie (1974) called &quot;Harry and Tonto&quot;.
It's a cute movie-lots of bugs in the background. The story is about an old
guy-70-something-who gets evicted from his New York apartment, and ends up
going on the road to Los Angeles. Pretty cool movie. Anyway, at one point
in Arizona he gets picked up by an old codger in a splittie panel van with
a bug top welded to the back/top. Looked kinda cool.

Peace,
