&gt;Aside from stone chips peppering the face of your fine vehicle, has anyone
&gt;noticed any rise in engine temp from the reduction of air being rammed down
&gt;the vents.  I imagine this would have some detrimental effect down the line
&gt;somewhere, especially if you were air-cooled.

not really ... remember that you are still moving through the air at x mph
... even if you are behind the truck. now, if you are REALLY close ... like
within 5 feet or so, well ... maybe. but even that ought to get enough air
from beneath the trailer.

i have noticed the drop in temp when running in the summer and being rained
on ... quite noticeable. but not a rise in temp behind anyone.

since i have that little driving computer that tells me instantaneous mpg,
i asked a driver (over the cb) if i could get right up behind him ... he
said he didn't care and would tell me if anything came up. so i got pretty
close behind and tried to see what sort of mileage difference there was.

where i had been getting about 22-23 back about two truck-lengths, i saw the
meter stay around 37 mpg when i got within the vacuum behind his trailer.
the big problem is: you cannot see ANYTHING!! and he cannot see you.
remember, if you can't see his mirrors, he can't see you at all.
so i don't recommend drafting/tailgating at all. i've done it to see what
was the fuss, and it really does work like they say it does, but i'm telling
you it can't be worth the danger.

only if you survive, do you realize how many really stupid things you did. :)
