Subject: Oil light/buzzer combo

To the List,

I want to rig my camper so that when the red oil pressure light 
illuminates on the dash, the opened(while the keys are in the 
ignition)  door buzer will come on.  THis way I will never, hopefully 
, drive any distance with the oil light on.  Has anyone ever tried to 
do this, or know how it can be done?

Thanks
