Subject: SStones' van accident


I said I'd send the details,
Today my news reader's down so I have lots of time... Here goes.

I am following Shithead in the left eastbound lane of my school driveway.
The right lane is parked up.  The road is wet and slippery.
Shithead, without signalling, pulls left into the on-coming traffic lanes.
S.H. slows way down... I catch up to him, I assume he's turning left.
As I catch up to him he pulls back in to my lane and brings his pontiac
to a complete stop.  
I, however am no longer paying attention to him, There's a pedestrian
Crosswalk coming up,  I'm watching to make sure no one's going to run
out in front of me.
I threshold brake very well and get my front bumper
nice and low for the CRASH!!!
I get out and ask him what the fuck he's doing in all these lanes.
He was avoiding the yellow ripple on the road that passes for a slow down
warning, kinda like a speed bump but tiny.
If you were stopping anyway, Why did you avoid the bump?
He was stopping for the empty pedestian crosswalk.
Why did you stop for the Empty crosswalk?
He did'nt think it was empty, or at least claims that he didn't think so.
He is of course sitting with his rear wheels in the crosswalk.
Either it was empty or there's now a body under his car.
No Body... My eyes were right all along.
We do the info exchange thing... I go to night school...

But!!! Because it's the front of my van to the back of his car... 
Legally it's gonna be considered my fault for not stopping in time.
For once, no fault insurance is going to benifit the victim maybe.

I'm not looking forward to this.  Insurance claim damage estimate in 
3 hours... wish me luck folks.



Cheers
