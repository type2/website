Subject: NEED a Bus

Thom,
I realize that you deal more in early Buses, but maybe you can help me out.
I am from the Foothills(near Nevada City), but am out on the East Coast
till May.  I have done some limited work on Transporters(69/72) and am in
the market for a Bus for myself as soon as possible.  I am looking for a 78
Westy Camper model.  If I am completely off base on the improvements of
this engine and model over some of the previous ones, please let me know.
Any information you can provide to me about possible Buses for sale.  I can
get back there at most any time to check out any leads.  Thanks for any
help you can provide, and if you have the address to Bus Boys it would be
greatly appreciated.

Peace
Roger
