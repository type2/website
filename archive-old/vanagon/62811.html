Subject: 84 Westy - thinking of buying

We're looking at an '84 westy, 148K miles on original engine, new trans 2 
years ago, minor dents and rust (as far as we can tell).  Anyone care to 
hazard a guess as to a fair price?  I expect we'll need to stick a new 
engine in it soon (and how much do engines run?).  We're test driving it 
tomorrow.  Suggestions on what to look out for (besides the sweet smell of 
coolant)?

Cheers,
