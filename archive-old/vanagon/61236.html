Subject: Westy heating query

I'm wondering what (if anything) other Westy owners have done to provide
heat in the van while camping. I know the air cooled Westys had gasoline
heaters. But are there other options that can be used while camping 
i.e. propane, 12V DC, other??? Any suggesstions would be appreciated.
