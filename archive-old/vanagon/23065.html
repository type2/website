The &quot;chrome yellow,&quot; what I think Tobin kindly refers to as mango, 
together with the green/orange/yellow plaid upholstery, formed some kind 
of passive theft deterrent system. I was reluctant to kiss the stock 
color goodbye because it was a stock color, but I couldn't live with the 
weird off-yellow color and I've seen the green color you're referring to...

&gt; Hi, 
&gt; Been scrapin' and scratchin' around all the surface rust spots today and had
&gt; a remarkable revelation. In those spaces where the 2nd paint job just flaked
&gt; away to reveal the original coat I discovered that it was DIFFICULT to
&gt; scratch that paint with a STAINLESS STEEL TOOTHBRUSH! I couldn't believe it!
&gt; Where can I get this paint? My plan was to do a *meticulous* prep job then
&gt; have Miracle paint it. Is this a good idea? Can I get my own paint, say from
&gt; VW, then have Miracle use that? The original color was that pea-green. With
&gt; all due respect to those of you actually like that color it is just not for
&gt; me and mine. Leilani (artistic and cosmic Director) had something like a
&gt; bright yellow in mind. I htink I read a post that mentioned an orginal
&gt; &quot;chrome yellow&quot; does this sound right? 
&gt; Anyway, all suggestions greatly appreciated.
