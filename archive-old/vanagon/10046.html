 my girlfriend tells me that she saw them in australia on her vacation, they
&gt;&gt; also have them for the rear lights, iguess in case a koala is tailgating.

&gt;Avery,
&gt;
&gt;It's really sad to hear that the Australian VW buses are so slow.  But if 
&gt;kangaroos are really that fast, why didn't they use them on Road Warriors 

But he said _koalas_ were tailgating!  Geez, that is one slow bus!
