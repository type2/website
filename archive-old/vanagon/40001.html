Subject: missing


	I was on the way home from break a few weeks ago
and the bus ran quite well on the way home.  Before I set
back to school it rained and the bus started running terrible.
Put on a new distributor cap, checked the wires and timing
and now I am thinking fouled plugs?
 
	Could it be in the valves?  I *hate* doing my valves
(type IV)  Its feels like it is missing a little bit, even at speed
but will still run 70.

	Any ideas?  I would appreciate some mail as I am administering my own list
now and read this one really spottily :(

Many thanks,
Matt (2.0 L, '77 w/ FI if it matters)
