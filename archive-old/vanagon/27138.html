Subject: RE: Rust Revalations in So. Cal.

Jim,

One of the options we have in the rust belt is to not drive
our cheerished vehicles during the salty times, that is, if
one can affort a winter beater like an older Audi Quattro.
When this is done, I think the rate of rust may even
approach half of what it would be near the coast areas
of California.

91 MultiVan (still plan to fix it up)
90 Vanagon GL (donor for fixing MultiVan and converting the
     Syncro into having a rear seat that converts to a bed)
