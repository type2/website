&gt; Cool! 4 '59's and 3 are Singles! Yeah!
&gt; 
&gt; Sorry. Got a little excited there.
Yeah and before the listserv, I thought mine was the only one left.  Good to
know I'm not the only crazy.  Incidently Bob, I got mine when I lived down
there.  It may be in Utah, but its treated well.  Currently doing restoration
and conversion to 12V as time permits.
