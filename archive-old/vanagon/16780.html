&gt;
&gt;&gt; Don't even bother trying to get the right hose, even if you fix it it never
&gt;&gt; worked right to begin with.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;
&gt;Actually, my washer system is one of the few things that works well.  I
&gt;pumped it up at the beginning of summer two summers ago, forgot about it
&gt;as I stored it outside through a winter up here in the great white north,
&gt;(we're talkin' -35c) and was able to continue using it for most of the
&gt;next summer without pumping it up.  I suppose it's never safe to
&gt;stereotype a VW van. 

Same here. After replacing the valve inside the steering column to stop me 
getting a lap full of water every time I used them, the washers work great 
and seem to hold pressure indefinitely. Mind you, the constant rain in 
England means we never need them anyway.
