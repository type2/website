&gt;I know this subject has been kicked around before, but I've never seen
&gt;these specific questions answered:
&gt;
&gt;Has anyone on the list upgraded their Syncro to 15&quot; or 16&quot; wheels?

With a 27&quot; wheel in the wheelwell, there's not all that much room to move up
to a larger tire.  I think a 29' would be about the limit presuming you don't
want to do some serious trimming on your van's fenders.

Also, if you're doing much driving in low gear (like off-road or trying to
get unstuuck) then adding larger sized wheels will make the gearing higher
and reduce the ammount of torque you can apply to the ground.  Also going
down steep off-road downhills I often wish I had lower gearing.  Larger tires
would worsen this problem.  Of course the gearing in the differentials could
be changed, but I can only imagine how much $$$!!! those parts would cost.

&gt;Also, does anyone know the any of the details regarding the optional 16&quot;
&gt;wheels available on German Syncros - such as specs, construction (steel or
&gt;alloy), whether they have matching hubcaps - etc? Will these wheels fit
&gt;within the stock wells used on US Syncros?

My understanding is that the 16&quot; Syncros were much more than a different set
of wheels.  I believe the suspension/shocks were different as well as the
gearing.  If you find out anything along this front, I'd love to hear about
it.
