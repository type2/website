Subject: EV with shakey clutch

My '93 EV MV has developed this awful vibration when I press down the clutch
pedal.  Does anyone know if this is indicative of the need for a new clutch
(YIKES)?  Has anyone experienced this with their EV...and any suggestions as
to what I can expect from a mechanic?  Any advice and insight is much
appreciated.
