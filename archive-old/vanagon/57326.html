Subject: Westy felt channel strips...Agh!

Greetings listees,

I've been hunting around for a week to replace the shredded felt channels that
the front passenger door windows roll up into.  So far it looks like only the
dealer carries them for $55 each.  I found a couple of resellers that would
discount that down to $48 each but I'm gritting my teeth of laying out that much
dosh.

So the Q is:  Can I use the felt strips from a Type I ($24 for a pair) in my
1989 Westy's front doors (No chrome strip)?  I hear they are very similar and
wonder if anyone has tried this or, ahem, any other acceptable solution.

Many thanks in advance to those courageous few who dared to try.
