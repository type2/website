Subject: Re: How to change ATF in 90 Vanagon

&gt;Assuming (for the sake of nice even round numbers) that the trans held 5
&gt;quarts and that you drive the van in between to circulate &amp; mix the fluid.
&gt; Outside the US, please substitute the word liter for quart or qt.  :-)
&gt;
Having just removed my transmission, differential and torque convertor and refilled them I found 
that the the whole unit holds 5 quarts of ATF when drained completely. I did have my convertor 
rebuilt so it was completely empty when I refilled. You can always pull the transmission and drain 
the torque convertor as per the Bentley - that only leaves about 1/4 of a quart in the convertor.
