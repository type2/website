Ok,


Note: elm users hit the &quot;&lt;&quot; key now!

	So far I have 10 people interested in the trip to Sacramento.

	The tentative itinerary choices include such diverse elements as Fear,
surprise and a fanatical devotion to the pope.

	Oh wait, wrong sketch.

	The choices are:

	Dinner _at_ Pescados (or)
	Lunch _at_ Pescados
	Bike Ride down the Merkin River
	Tour of Fitzpatrick's Body and Paint (not all its cracked up to be)
	Mud Wrestling

	Looks like late July or early August are the best times.  Everyone 
seems to be committed in the first 2 weeks in July.  How about the first week 
in August?
