Subject: Air conditioner -  receiver/dryer advice

        I have heard it said that if your freon circuit has been left open
to the air for a long period, that when recommissioning the AC, you
are enjoined to replace the receiver/dryer.

        I have two questions:

                1. Is the receiver/dryer composed of some sort of desicant
material, to absorb any moisture from the freon?

                2. If the answer to #1 is yes, then can I gently toast the 
receiver/dryer the the oven for a few hours, at say 100 degrees C,
to drive off any accumulated moisture, and then reinstall the unit in
my AC freon circuit?

        And no, don't ask why I am recommissioning the AC, with 
30 cm of the white stuff on the ground!
