Subject: Can I visit you?

Yes, anyone on this list!!!

Our trip around the US in my recently purchased 82 Westy is taking shape.  We
plan on leaving Seattle on April 1, heading down through Oregon via Klamath
Lake, then west to Klamath and down 101 to SF and area.  Then were off to
Yosemite, across death valley to vegas!  From there, Grand Canyon (North
Rim), Mesa Verde, Aztec Ruins,, down 285 to Carlsbad caverns,  to san
antonio, to Houston.  From there, it gets pretty general.  Up the east coast
perhaps, to NYC and then either across the top of the US or the bottom of
Canada.  If you want to drop me a private message with your name, address &amp;
Phone, perhaps we could meet as I pass by.  Also, any other hints on must
sees, and things to &quot;give a miss&quot; would be great.  I wish I was able to be at
Red Rock, but there's a chance we will pass as we travel.   I'll be signed
off the List while I'm gone, but try to check my private mail as I travel
around.

Count down... 12 days!

in from any old terminal I might find).
