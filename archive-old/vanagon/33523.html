Subject: stretch net for 'falia luggage racks


I bought something some of you may be interested in - a bungee stretch
net with non-corrosive hooks, which is made to attach to most vehicle's
luggage racks, but which i think will work fine on the westy luggage
rack (should work on either bread loafs, or vanagons, although I
haven't &quot;tried&quot; it - just bought it by eyeing it and guessing that it
would fit fine.  Anyway, it's sort of a criss-cross X-diamond shape
pattern, all in one piece, you just attach the hooks to the hardware
on your poptop, and I think this would be good for keeping in duffle
bags, gas tanks, etc.  (Remember that, at least on the vans, the max
weight up there is something like 150 pounds, maybe less).  

Someone else on our list has one of these, can't remember who - Kautz
maybe?  At any rate, it comes in small and large (perhaps maybe even
medium, but they didn't have that).  I bought large, and the &quot;dormant&quot;
dimensions of this are:  40&quot; x 50&quot;.  It's chartreuse for the artistically
sensitive.  :)

Anyway, I bought it at a store in Pleasant Hill, CA, called Hogan's
Sporting goods on Contra Costa Blvd. (didn't get their card, but I'm
sure they'd be in phone info for the 510 area code).  It's made by
Bungee International, in Chatsworth, CA.
