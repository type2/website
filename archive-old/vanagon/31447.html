Used to be able to get block ice at every gas station.   We traveled the 
country coast to coast using only the ice chest type ice box in a '72 
Westy.  Now that all you can get is cube ice its not as easy to use that 
type of cooler.  Cubes melt way to quickly.  An ice pick was one of the 
more important tools we always carried.
