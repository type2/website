Subject: 85 westy query

Hello and welcome back;  Last week my dad (age 80) called me up excited as a
teenager about this 85 westy he had discovered while out garage sale'in with
my mom.  The way he described it he sounded pretty much convinced about it,
but could I come down and have a look?  I went down yesterday to have a look
and a drive.  It's an 85 westy GL automatic,  I crawled underneath it with
my flashlight, no leaks anywhere, the factory undercoating was still there
everywhere except on the rack and pinion.  This one has 3 heaters in it the
dash , the underseat one and a gas heater.  Everything works on it 80000
kms. (50000 miles) we went for a drive, smooth, quiet, easy to drive.  I
crawled under it once again for another look while it was hot, still nothing
wrong.  My dad and the owner lady went over all the westy stuff, and
negotiations began, she started out asking 12,000, dropped to 10 right away.
When I suggested 8 she started saying &quot;maybe you don't realy want this van&quot;
so I doubt that she will budge on 10.
My dad doesn't know how much longer he will be able to drive and wonders
about the wisdom of this purchase.  What can I tell him?  Larry Carter
