Subject: Which carbs.?

Here are the answers to your response questions.

single barrel

PO took off the fuel injection

Problems: won't idle, occasional flat spots, less power than usual...

I'm pretty sure there isn't a brake dragging (I'll double check in 
the morning)

I still need to check the compression

Is there a simple way to check for a stuck choke?

Thanks again to everyone who has helped us!
