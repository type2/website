&gt;Hi everyone-
&gt;    This last Saturday I took the twelve hour trip upnorth, to pick up the
&gt;'52 barndoor.
&gt;
&gt;      The guy I bought it from had only owned it a month.  He bought it from
&gt;a older man, who has a farm about four miles from his house.  Derek, the guy
&gt;I bought the bus from, took me to meet the guy.  He was very nice, and let us
&gt;check out his VW graveyard behind his barn.  I couldn't believe my eyes!
&gt; There if front of me was a '56 panel van, five other split window buses,
&gt;three bay windows, one thing, one fastback, and a bunch of bugs.  I almost
&gt;had a heart attack when the old man (Ed) said I could take what ever parts I
&gt;needed.  I wanted to get back on the road, so I didn't have time to take
&gt;anything, but I asked him if I could come back in the summer to get any parts
&gt;I needed, and he said sure.  So I loaded up the Barndoor and headed home.
&gt; What a great day! 

Ok Eric, fess up.  Where is it?  Come on, you can tell us.  We promise not
to scavenge, honest!  Please tell me it's in MD or VA....

Bob.
