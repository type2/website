Subject: Aftermarket Cruise questions . . .

My newly purchased '91 Westy has an aftermarket cruise that 'works' in
strange ways. As there is no 'brand' name on it and no instructions for
it I am seeking assistance from anyone who may have any clues. The local
aftermarket shops here simply say &quot;we didn't sell it, you have no infor
on it, it's not worth our time to fix it.&quot; They will replace it for $400 or
so. That's more than its worth to me.

Curise controls 'look' like the standard ones that were on my last '91 - I
guess all are about the same. But it works like this:

&gt;From 35-55 mph you can set it and it will hold/work.

Above 55 mph it surges, up and down, and then cuts out. Sometimes it just 
cuts out! But it will not hold at all?

When it is working, if you
1) blow the horn
2) put on the turn signal
3) dim or raise the headlights
and probably other things I haven't found yet! It cuts out - as though you
had tapped the brake.

An it will not always reset?

Any and all thoughts on this are welcome. It is mounted on the steering
column (2 screws) and the cable then goes into the steering column cover.
I will have to remove the cover to trace the wire.

Thankx-
	Kenyon
