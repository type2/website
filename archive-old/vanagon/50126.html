Subject: Zoning violations and free buses

Greetings fellow bus junkies. I had an unexpected visit from the auto theft
division of the Denver police department Friday. About 5 cop cars showed up
and started checking VIN #'s of all of my VW's stored in the back yard and
alley. They gave me a really hard time and told me that I needed to remove
the vehucles ASAP or they would have them towed and I would be heavily fined.
So, this brings me to the point of my post: If any one wants any FREE bus
shells, please E-mail. I have a '70 Westy, '73 Bus, and a '73 Weekender,
also there is a '59 Single Cab shell w/ no nose for the taking. I am
stripping the vehicles
now, so if any one wants any parts they are 1/2 of what I usually charge, so
grab them fast. Please help save the buses. Also, all of the parts are German
and guaranteed good. 
Thanks for your help,
Josh
