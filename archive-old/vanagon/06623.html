Subject: Re: Blumenvasen


	My friend Richard used to have a Blumenvasen made out of a little
plastic bottle neatly attached to something near his heater controls in
his Jetta. Not to be outdone, I got a little holder with a suction-cup
that held a rose to the fixed vent wing window on my 914. With a big
rose in it and the top off on a sunny day, life was very good indeed.
	Short of drilling a hole in the dash, I haven't figured out how to
attach a blumenvasen in my Corrado, which is ANOTHER reason I need a
second car. 

	Bill
