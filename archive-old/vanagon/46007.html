Subject: Diesel Overheating...HELP!!

Howdy,
My diesel has been overheating for the last 5 months. I can drive until 
the overheating light is on, then touch the radiator ANYWHERE with no 
fear of being burned. I can then open bleed valve and out spurts 
coolant(60%) and air(40%). After 3 or 4 minutes, the radiator is hot and 
the temperature starts to fall. But then I have to add a half gallon of 
coolant.

During the 5 months I have: replaced waterpump, replaced then removed 
thermostat, had radiator cleaned and rodded, replaced radiator-style cap, 
flushed system (5 times), bypassed oil cooler (found oil in coolant), and 
I have bled the _stupid_ system for 30++ hours.

What else can I do?
