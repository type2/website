&gt; Thanks, David.  The fit on the tubes w/seals, both old and new, was so

&gt; with VERY SOFT metal, and was careful not to nick or crush the tubes.  
&gt; Installation went very well, with a solid thunk, as each tube found it's 
&gt; way home.  I was also careful to make sure that the spring wire was 
&gt; correctly situated.

Obviously, you might be able to apply apply a promising technique of 
sealing your pushrod tubes when you have an aircooled engine.

But what's about the watercooled ones? You cannot easily remove your 
pushrod tubes. So is there also a promising technique except of 
installing telescope tubes which are a bit expen$ive.

Oddly enough there are weeks when my tubes are heavily leaking and other 
times when there is no single drop. Anyone experienced this, too?
