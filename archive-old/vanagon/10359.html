Subject: Re: I Want a Westy Tent !

	
	Regarding the Westy tent.  I have one which I don't want to sell, 
sorry, as I live in it along with my van.
	To the (a) point.  The tent is from a friends 71' Westy and I 
have an 82' and it fits perfectly.  So, there seems to be some 
crosswestability with them.  This may ease the search.
	And while I look out of the office, I see that it is raining once 
again.  The first rain this season brought down several inches along with 
the tent. The short pitch along with the amazingly tight weave combined 
to allow some 3 gallons of water to collect.  The weight snapped the 
snaps and dropped the top.  Since I left the door ajar (unzipped), all 
that water just rushed right in and stayed to soak my books, tools, and 
cloths.  Nice rubber flooring keeps water out, or in.  So if you do get 
one, besure to set up on level ground (I can't) and get a plastic tarp to 
draw up tight over the external frame. 
	There, I've said it.  I feel that a giant weight has been lifted 
off my shoulders, at least 3 gallons worth.
	Happy hunting....Walt 82' Westy 71' 2002..
