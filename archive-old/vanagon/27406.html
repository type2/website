Subject: News Flash:81 Vanagon passes emissions!!!

Hi All,
Well I rolled the dice and came up a winner.  My thanks to all that 
replied with their ideas (John Huguenard, Joel Walker, Bradley M., John 
Anderson, Gary_at_arizona_dot_edu, anyone I might have forgotten and 
particularly Ed Buzz for his idea on adjusting the AFC) since you saved 
me the need for _another_ waiver.  As well as adding to my, and I hope, 
your collective wisdom on the AFC/L-Jetronic system.

As for what I did to pass:
Adjusted the AFC spring 4 clicks tighter
Plugged the charcoal cannister with a piece of electrical tape
Pulled the dipstick out about 3 inches

Readings:
	Idle	2500 rpm	Limits		Results
HC ppm	71	42		400		Pass
CO %	1.22	1.28		1.50		Pass
CO2 %	5.4	10.6		N/A		N/A
RPM	1172	2446		N/A		N/A

For those who haven't been following this thread, here's the thinking 
behind the above actions:
Tighten the spring 2-4 clicks to fool the ECU into thinking conditions 
are leaner than they are.  Plugging the cannister prevents vapors from 
the gas tank from getting into the system.  Pulling the dipstick out 
reduces the vacuum in the crankcase as well as introducing fresh air so 
that an emissions are lessened.

Again, many many thanks to all that helped me with this one, I truly 
appreciate it.

Jack
