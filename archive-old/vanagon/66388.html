Subject:      Vanagon Parts

I am looking for a solution to one of my problems.  Can you Help?

I have a 1986 Vanagon Westfaila Synchro which for a variety of reasons I
have
removed the stove and refer, the storage cabinet and water tank, the
closet
and the propane tank.  All of it is in very good condition and perhaps you
have a need or know someone that might be looking for these items.

I am looking for the two upholstery panels, tan in color to cover the
removed
cabinets, etc.  The two panels opposite the sliding door.  I am also
looking
for a set of stock VW alloy wheels for the same Vanagon.

Any help would be appreciated.  Thank you in advance.

Tom
