Subject:      Re: Dropped from Vanagon list

When I fell off the list I turned to the archive
http://www.automatrix_dot_com:80/~skip/volkswagen/vanagon-list/
to catch up.  Jim '87Westy, Somerville MA

&gt;I had to re up also, not part of one of the big isp's. As far as I know my
&gt;mail box has never been full. I went to vanagon_dot_com to see what was wrong,
&gt;imagine my surprise when I found out nothing was.
&gt;I did miss the vw posts.
&gt;I figured it was one of those things. Thought you might like to know, might
&gt;not too!
