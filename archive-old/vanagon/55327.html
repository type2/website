Subject: Re: ECU q's

&gt; &gt; Does anyone know if an ECU from an '84 with a 1.9L and a/c will work on an
&gt; &gt;  '86 with a 2.1L and a/c?
&gt; 
&gt; No.  It won't work.  The 1983.5 to 1985 vans use an ECU for their Digijet
&gt; fuel injection that is significantly different than the 1986-1991 Digifant
&gt; equipped vans.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;  If not, anyone know of a reasonable $$ source for a good one.

Try:

Larry       - Partstore_at_aol_dot_com
Jimmi James - info_at_bugworld_dot_com
Kyle Wade   - vwmaster_at_volks-motorsports_dot_com

And let me know how you make out.

I just got a Digijet ('85 &amp; back) ECU for $200.00 + $7.50 freight from
Larry at PartStore.  Working fine.
