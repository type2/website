&gt; 
&gt; Where did you order it from and what was the price?
BowWow $90 - their Surrey store just got them in: Surrey- 594-4300 
or Marine Drive - 325-9970
 
&gt; I never got a useful answer to my question about the $17 manual at AMAZON, 
&gt; so I'm going to assume that it isn't the real Bentley Manual.
$17 sounds a little too good... What's Amazon?
 
&gt; Any info and phone numbers would be appreciated.

I haven't lost my mind;  I'm sure it's backed up on tape somewhere!
