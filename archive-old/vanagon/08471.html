Subject: pizza on the 22nd

Allright everybody,

&gt;From your responses, it would seem that a pizza dinner on Thursday the
22nd would be a good choice. The 2 alternatives would have been Wednesday
the 21st, which I find too short on notice, and Monday the 26th, which
seemed feasible but not easy because of relatives, etc. 

Now we should decide WHERE to go. Zack's on College in Oakland has yummy
Chicago style (deep dish) pizza, but they usually also have a *really*
long line. I'm open to any suggestion and, as far as I am concerned, it
can be anywhere in the Bay Area. So send in your suggestions and then we
can vote. 

Oh, and Maria, my wife, will probably come too. Don't hesitate to bring
your SOs and kids, too. And, if you don't come in your VW, bring some
pictures! 

If we need to make reservations, it would be good to have an estimate of
the number of people, too. 

So far, the potential participants are:

Martha Rubin		nrubin_at_s1.csuhayward_dot_edu
Jim Macklow		macklow_at_sybase_dot_com
Dave Kautz		dkautz_at_hpsidms1.sid.hp_dot_com
Bill Abbott		wabbott_at_townshend.Corp.Megatest.COM
Bob Kenyon		rrk_at_rahul_dot_net
Patrick Tower		poser_at_leland.stanford_dot_edu
Steven Johnson		sjohnson_at_pcocd2.intel_dot_com
Jan Allbright		jallbright_at_mayfield.hp_dot_com
Sami Dakhlia		dakhlia_at_wuecona.wustl_dot_edu

See you soon!
