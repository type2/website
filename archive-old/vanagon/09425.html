Subject: Re: ADVICE/OPINIONS interior

long live cheesy vw westy interiors. i personally like the plaid, but a lot
of people like something slightly more tasteful. if you do remodel your
interior, i would save the orig. fabric. who knows, someday you way want to
restore it back to it's beautiful polyester 70's glory!
