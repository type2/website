Subject: Vanagon 84: Water Coolant Reservoir

Just got an 84 Vanagon, whose Water Coolant Reservoir is leaking
coolant.  From the back of the lift trunk of the Vanagon, I still can't
tell if it's the main coolant reservoir (center) or the auxiliary
coolant reservoir (left).  I think it's the left one, but the engine was
blazing hot...  I'll figure it out when the engine cools down.  

1. Anyway, can someone fax me the instructions from the Bentley manual
for replacing both the engine coolant reservoirs?  My fax is at
408-495-3097.

2. The dealer is asking for $60.00! (yipes!) for this coolant reservoir,
I haven't found a Vanagon in the junk yard, and the dealer has to
special order.  I've looked at the Web Pages for Vanagons, and there are
several choices for Wholesale parts.  Are we allowed (as end-users) to
call these factories/distributors?  Otherwise, anyone know a reputable
place I can either mail-order one or is located in the SF Bay Area?  

3. Also, I'd like to purchase a Bentley manual. Is the Bentley the only
one available?  Whether Bentley or another manual, where did you
purchase your manual?  I think that the Bentley is being sold at $89.95,
kind of expensive compared to my other car manuals ($39.95, $59.95,
etc.).  Anyone know where I can get any detailed manual at a cheap(er)
price?  

Thanks a bunch!
