&gt;Subject: Core charge for Vanagon Transmission?
&gt;
&gt;Hi all:
&gt;
&gt;I bought a transmission at a wreaking yard yesterday, but since I'm
&gt;not going to pull it 'till next week, I paid the yard owner up front
&gt;to &quot;hold&quot; it for me.  As we were settling up he causually mentioned
&gt;that I could pay the core charge when I actually come back to get it.
&gt;
&gt;It never occured to me that there might be a core charge on a piece
&gt;bought at a wreaking yard.  Is this normally done on rebuildable
&gt;parts?  What's a reasonable core charge in this situation?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks.

$200 was the core charge from a FLAPS in my area when I was looking to buy
a rebuilt tranny with a guarantee.  This is the first time I ever heard of
a salvage yard charging a core charge on something but its been a while
since I bought a transmission or engine this way.
