Dave,

In regard to your querry about whether or not the list owner can own an 
address...the answer is plainly NO.

What is involved here is a trade mark or brand name. The concept is rather 
simple....you can't get trade mark protection on your home address because 
it identifies a particular geographical location. An internet address is a 
geographical identifier, rather than identifying terra firma, it identifies 
a specific location on a network.

So there is no ownership. 

I'm sorry that the list owner of &quot;type2&quot; is incurring expenses in running 
the list. That was his choice, not the choice of the list members. In fact, 
I don't recall any of the list members of V_at_L getting any say in the matter. 
We were told 24 hours prior that the split was happening....and boom it 
happened. No discussion...no vote...nada.

Tim Smith has a point in his response....do any of the owners of the 
web-pages ask or demand payment....no...so why should we have to &quot;render 
unto Ceasar&quot; or in this case the list administrator because he feels that 
the list name is his property. Well it isn't, period.

If it were, then every time we sent a posting to the list, we would be 
violating his rights by typing &quot;type2_at_primenet_dot_com&quot;, and therefore we would 
have to seek his permission before sending a post to the list.

If anyone has ownership in the list names, it would be Volkswagen, 
considering &quot;TYPE2&quot; and &quot;VANAGON&quot; are protected names under trademark law.

Ric
