Subject: Westfalia Insignia

Yes, Westfalia insignia is readily available.

Simply go to a sign shop and choose an appropriate font (they usually
have a slew of fonts up on the wall, write down what you want it to
say W-E-S-T-F-A-L-I-A, N-E-V-E-R-F-A-L-I-A, or what have you, tell them 
what size you want, pay them, and the computer cuts up the vinyl letters 
ready for application.  Not sure how much it'll cost.  Maybe $30.00?
Or, probably less now that there are a lot of these shops around.
