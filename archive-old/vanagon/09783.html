So L.S.Griffiths_at_physics.salford.ac_dot_uk says:
&gt;      a heater box exhaust tube - without the heater box shroud and fins.
&gt;      I am going to weld a water tight tube around this J-tube as below:
&gt;      
&gt;      J tube \ ___
&gt;              /               water tight tube
&gt;        out__|_____________ /
&gt;              \_|__________|___
&gt;                |__________|_ 
&gt;                              in
&gt;      
&gt;      Then (change of tense) add an inlet tube at the bottom towards the
&gt;      rear of tube and an outlet tube at the top towards the front of the
&gt;      tube. We thought that the cold water should enter the water box as 
&gt;      far away from the exhaust port (of #3) as possible to minimise exhaust
&gt;      tube cooling. Cooling the exhaust might result in large exhaust 
&gt;      pressure difference for number 3 cylinder - something to think about.
&gt;      
&gt;      Ok so then fit a water pump (electric or fan belt driven) obtained 
&gt;      from a junk yard to power the water around. Then two 15mm copper house 
&gt;      radiator pipe the water to and from the cab. In the cab fit an 
&gt;      all-in-one radiator and fan unit from a, you guess it, small Italian
&gt;      car. Seriously all small water cooled FIATS seem to have these nice
&gt;      little water heater units in the engine bay that consist of a small
&gt;      radiator and boost fan in a nice little box. Connect the copper
&gt;      pipes to the in and out tubes on the FIAT radiator and mount it
&gt;      somewhere under the dash board and err, maybe bingo you have a toastie
&gt;      bus in winter. Well I'll let you know if it works.
&gt;      
&gt;      Some other points to note are that you will need a header tank in the 
&gt;      engine bay to &quot;let off steam&quot; and don't forget that foam lagging round 
&gt;      the copper pipes. Don't worry about boiling in Summer, just drain the
&gt;      water off coz you'll not need the heater in summer.
&gt;      

I realize this is my third response to this thread, but fingers just love to
hit that send key. ;)  Anyway, I just realized that this system might be a 
solution for those with air-cooled Type II's that want to have heated water/
showers in their beasts similar to Dave Garths magnificant system.  I think
alot of people will be interested in your results Lee.

Good Luck!
