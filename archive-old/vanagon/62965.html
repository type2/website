yup, I can see your point.  I have an '85 Westy, 2wd, 1.9 L and it is
truly gutless in mildly hilly settings.  I've actually had to have all the
riders get out of it at a paved camp ground in the mountains by Sante Fe,
much to the amusement of onlooking campers.  I still love it, but at times
like that I curse VW for making a camping vehicle that can't handle
anything but the meekest off-road terrain.

&gt; RE: both messages below,  I looked for a year for my Syncro.  It took that
&gt; long to believe the prices being asked for them in Seattle.  Mine is an 87 GL
&gt; Syncro Westy.  I watched several '90 and '91's with 60,000 miles go for
&gt; $23,000 and $25,000 right before my eyes while I was waiting to have my turn
&gt; to look.
&gt; 
&gt; All I can add is look it over carefully and decide if you are prepared to pay
&gt; the price to keep replacing things as they go bad because all 10 year old
&gt; cars have things that need replacing.
&gt; 
&gt; As far as what I think about Syncros over 2WD Vanagons:  The GRIN factor on
&gt; my face has more than trippled on my explorations in the mountains and the
&gt; snow.  I have the money to keep it in top shape,  and I have wanted one since
&gt; I saw the first one in '86.   Check with the Kelly Blue book.  The NADA book
&gt; has always been way off the real selling price.
&gt; 
&gt; Also, at 100,000 miles, you are near the point where many things are ready
&gt; for replacement, you just have to weigh the costs and the selling price to
&gt; determine if you are ready for the expense.   If you only drive in good
&gt; weather on good roads, you will never know the difference,  but you'll be
&gt; missing all the fun of going where the Syncro can go.  The Compound low gear
&gt; has proven very valuable to me on steep streets and very slow moving traffic
&gt; jams, not to mention off-road exploration!!!
&gt; 
&gt; Good Luck

&gt; &lt;&lt; Lets use a little common sense here. Any Car That was 10 years old,
&gt;    with 100k miles would be selling for scrap pricing, if this were
&gt;    the 1960's. Because of autos lasting longer and better design, this
&gt;    deal can be reasonable. BUT in MY Opinion you are on the edge!

&gt;  &gt; Hello,
&gt;  &gt; 
&gt;  &gt;     I've found an 87 Synchro which is selling for $4200.  100K miles, nice
&gt;  &gt; body, paint, etc.  Is this a good bargain or a sign of trouble ?  I've
&gt; haven't
&gt;  &gt; seen any 87's priced as low as this, and the fact that this is a Synchro
&gt; (4WD)
&gt;  &gt; makes me even more suspicious.
&gt;  &gt; 
&gt;  &gt;     Would anyone care to comment on the pros and cons of having a Synchro
&gt;  &gt; rather than the 2WD version ?  &gt;&gt;
