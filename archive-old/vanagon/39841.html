Subject: Re: FS: Westy tent, freestanding


This is just to let you know that the tent sold already this morning. 
Since a number of you were interested, I simply decided to offer it to 
the first person who contacted me.

Happy camping,

Joerg

&gt; After I sold my Westy diesel (I had it in the paper for only a day), I 
&gt; will also sell my tent.
&gt; 
&gt; This tent is freestanding (attaches to the van) and it has never been 
&gt; used (except set up twice in my backyard).
&gt; 
&gt; My brother brought it from Germany last summer, when I still imagined we 
&gt; might be going camping with our twin girls (born June of last year). It 
&gt; has never been used for the simple reason that we're so busy now that 
&gt; camping is simply out of the question and if we get a break, it's just 
&gt; too much work.
&gt; 
&gt; The color is grey (to match the canvas of the late eighties westies) with 
&gt; yellow stripes and big windows that can be zipped open or closed. It does not 
&gt; have a floor.
&gt; 
&gt; I'd like to get around $400 since it's in perfect/new condition (around 
&gt; $750 or $800 new, but a new one you have to pick up in Germany yourself). 
&gt; Make an offer.
&gt; 
&gt; Please e-mail me at
