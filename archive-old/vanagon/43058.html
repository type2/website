Subject: Re: 91 Vanagon, oil pressure anomaly

&gt;Right to the problem: Every time I exit the freeway, the oil pressure 
&gt;light and buzzer (you know, the one that triples your heart rate in a 
&gt;split second) come on. In every instance, I have immediately pulled over, 
&gt;stopped the engine, and checked the oil (always fine). I turn the engine 
&gt;on again after a minute or two and everything is fine (no light, no 
&gt;buzzer). Is this my vans way of telling me it doesn't want to leave the 
&gt;freeway? 8-) Any advise of information is appreciated.

Hello Patrick
     I had a similar problem with my '86 syncro.  Just after getting off the
freeway the oil pressure would drop (guage installed) and the light and
buzzer would sound.   I too thought it was just low oil level.  This
happened this spring when temperatures started to hit the mid 80's.  I was
still running 10w 30 oil.  I changed the oil to my summer oil of 20w50 and
the problem has'nt returned.  The manuel recommends 20w50 for temperatures
between 20degF and 85degF.  for tropical heat it recommends 40 weight oil.
The manuel also warns if you run 10w30 5w20 or 5w30 oils to avoid high speed
driving if the temperature is above the limits shown.
     Try and run 20w50 and see if that solves your problem, assuming you are
running 10w30or something else.
