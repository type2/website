&gt;This has the signs of developing into a great thread, complete with VW
&gt;content! Come on, VW freaks/hacks/nuts... what was YOUR silliest/most
&gt;embarrassing embodiment of blank stupidity, incurred while working on
&gt;a VW?
&gt;
As a teenager in college, I had a '64 Ford and a '70 Mustang.  One summer
I was switching the motors between the two, to put the big engine from the
sedan into the Mustang.  I'd done all the research to get the right motor
mounts, clutch linkage, etc.  My dad was helping me, but basically just
handing me tools and parts, that kind of thing.  I'd got the engines switched,
and was in the process of bolting everything up.  The cars were in kind of
a vacant, semi-wooded lot behind our house.  When this particular exchange
took place, I was bolting the headers to the engine, a kind of tedious job
that required me to be mostly tangled up in the engine compartment.

Dad:  Isn't this the oil drain plug?  (holding it up in his hand)
Me:   (Kind of impatient because I was having trouble starting a bolt, and
       had to stop and crane around to see what he had)  Yeah, that's it.
Dad:  (Pause)  Didn't you already fill it with oil?
Me:   (Still concentrating on the bolt and not making the connection)  Yeah,
      a little while ago.  (Why's Dad keep bugging me with these stupid
      questions?)
Dad:  (Another pause)  THEN WHAT THE HELL'S HOLDING IT UP??

Hit my head on the hood from being startled, then took a couple of seconds
to process the question and put it together with the drain plug in my dad's
hand.  We both had a pretty good laugh at that point.  Five quarts, right
on the ground.  Pushed the car forward a few feet, put the plug in, added
more oil.
