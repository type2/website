&gt;&gt; 19,100cc's!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!     WOW!!!!!!!              I WANT ONE OF
&gt;&gt; THOSE!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Can you imagine how fast the Westy would go with 
this?
&gt;
&gt;Reminds me of an old George Carlin skit.  If you had everything, where
&gt;would you put it?  Same thing here, the engine would fill the whole van!
&gt;The other problem you'd have is keeping tires on it...

Stretch your plug wires quite a bit, too, wouldn't it?
