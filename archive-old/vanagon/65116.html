&gt; My 91 Westy seems to have no power when cold.  I let it run for about 30

&gt; let out the clutch it just wants to die instead of go.  I have to really
&gt; give it gas, and then after a minute or two, it goes fine.  Anyone have
&gt; a fix?

        Be patient with your VW!
        Let it warm up and your engine will last a lot longer. 90% of engine
wear happens during those first two minutes, a good time to avoid high
rpm activity. (Read what John Muir has to say about this)
        I have disconnected the automatic choke in my '66 kombi(so it doesn't
run rich, not even at start up time), this brings my warm up time up to
about 5 minutes. Its only a matter of getting used to waiting a little
bit longer, and in exchange you are really helping your engine.
