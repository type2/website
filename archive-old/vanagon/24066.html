Subject: Diesel 82 Westy

Hi all! Somebody called me today and offered me a Diesel 82 Westy, I pro
promised to him to go and see it on Monday. Is anybody out there who
could tell me anything about diesel Vanagons? The guy is asking $4,800.
Is that price worthy? Currently I own a 1978 Westy that is 95% original
and no complains. See ya later!
