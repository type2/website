&gt;I too went with the Thule fake rain gutter system and often carry two glass

&gt;whitewater boats on top.  Does anyone know what kind of loads those struts
&gt;can take?  
&gt;
&gt;I also  plan to spring for the Thule super high feet which will fit in the
&gt;rain gutter over the luggage top not the pop top for when I only carry bikes.
&gt; With the thule fork mount system I should still be able to till pop the top
&gt;with the bikes on.  The height is no big deal.  Jump on the wheel well and
&gt;grab the bike.
&gt;
&gt;The down side to carrying bikes on the back is that some day someone will hit
&gt;you or you'll back into something.  Been there, done that.  I think
&gt; expensive sporting equipment belongs on the roof or on the trail.   Wwatch
&gt;the drive-in windows and the garage
&gt;

Yes, I'm sure we've all either done it or know someone who has gone under
something that we know we've previously cleared and don't remember until we
hear the crash that we have skis/bikes/kayaks/surfboards on the roof.

Been there, done that.  Happily it was just one of those wooden warning
signs that hangs on ropes so Caron's skis didn't get damaged.  I'd hate to
think what would have happened if it'd been bikes.
