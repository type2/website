Subject: Re: Rear window defogger, '81 Vanagon

&gt; 
&gt;    Or is the grid really a bunch of resistive wires in parallel, such
&gt;    that one (or more) of the lines would work, even if the others aren't
&gt;    working?
&gt; 
&gt;    The wiring diagram suggest the defogger is one long resistive wire.
I think it is, but splits into a bunch of parallel ones on the window... 
Sounds like most of yours have scratches, except the one that's 
working. You can get conductive paint to patch any scratches you 
find.
