Austin,

Great Story
  While in Yellow Stone I saw a woman, who was busy talking, walk into a
1800 pound buffalo.  Not a pretty sight, but amusing non the less.
  Later that year while stopped in a buffalo crossing I watched a couple
of kids snapa photo of another buffalo standing 6 inches outside of
their Chevy conversion van.  NOT amused by the flash the buffalo butted
the van.  That was interesting, but watching the kidds swarm through the
van, screaming, yelling and flogging their parents made us laugh so hard
we could barely breath.  It made an interesting dent that I would have
left in my van just to tell the story.
