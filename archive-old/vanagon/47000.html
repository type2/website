I think you have a clogged radiator.  
Been there, done that.  

Take the rad to a shop and have it flow tested and &quot;rodded out&quot;.  
Beware - depending on the type of corrosion and gook in the rad, the rodding
out process may be only a temporary fix.  Expect to pay $50 for the process
if you carry in the rad, $100 or more if they take it out.

good luck - Frank

BTW - new rad is $400+  (which is what I ended up doing :-(  )

 &gt;Subject: Greetings Again &amp; Overheat Help
 &gt;
 &gt;Hello All:
 &gt;
 &gt;As a desperate measure to preserve my sanity (and to keep some portion of
 &gt;the day for doing my actual job), I dropped off the list about 6 months
 &gt;ago. But news of the water/air split was enough to get me to resubscribe
 &gt;and see if I can bear the traffic, so here I am.
 &gt;
 &gt;And wouldn't you know it, I've got a problem.
 &gt;
 &gt;Over the past month or so, my '87 (Syncro Westy) with 69k miles has begun
 &gt;running hot. Historically, the temp. gauge would sit right at the center
 &gt;(over the warning light) when the engine was at operating temp., and the
 &gt;cooling fan would only kick on in warm weather traffic. Now, in cool
 &gt;weather it's running 2/3 towards the top of the gauge, and the fan is
 &gt;coming on any time I'm not at highway speed.
 &gt;
 &gt;I took it into the shop where we've done the following:
 &gt;
 &gt;new thermostat &amp; bleed system	- No change
 &gt;system pressure test 		- OK
 &gt;2 different tests for CO2 in coolant	- Negative
 &gt;thermal probe test of coolant temp	- roughly normal at engine outflow,
 &gt;radiator, engine intake.
 &gt;exam all hoses, etc.			- OK
 &gt;
 &gt;Other info:
 &gt;
 &gt;no abnormal water pump noises
 &gt;no coolant backup into overflow tank
 &gt;coolant has been changed frequently over the life of the bus
 &gt;turning on heater significantly reduces engine temp (almost back to normal)
 &gt;no external signs of head gasket leaks
 &gt;fan temp switch and temp gauge both concur that the engine is hot
 &gt;(functioning seems correct)
 &gt;rear passenger heater air does not seem very hot, even when engine is
 &gt;definitely hot
 &gt;
 &gt;Any guesses as to what's going on here?
 &gt;
 &gt;Thanks!
 &gt;
