Hit the junkyards today.  Lots of westies, a bay-window panel (!) but
no split windows.

Got an early radio for the bus.  It's an early 6v/12v switchable.  I paid
$5 for it, brought it home, hooked it up, and all the smoke escaped! :(

Quite a few bugs in various stages of disembowlment.  A lot of early low
back seats laying around. I sued to think these were hard to find...
A few bugs with mechanical fuel guages, too...
