&gt; Just to have a last word on the antennas.  The glass mount CB antenna that

&gt; Location of the antenna is not influenced by the vehicles body unless is
&gt; uses the body as a &quot;ground plane&quot;.  And that means that the antenna must be
&gt; attached to the metal of the body.
&gt; 
&gt; The glass mount doesn't need a ground plane, so therefore the reception
&gt; will be omni directional, and the body of the van will BLOCK the signal
&gt; going to the front and left.

  Sorry to disagree but the wave length of a 1/2 wave CB antenna is 18 
  feet. The body is 9 feet and the antenna is 9 feet making a total of 
  18 feet. This is called a 1/4 wave antenna. Anything smaller has
  what is called a base load, (a coil), that simulates a 9 foot antenna.
  Therefor placement of any CB antenna is very important!
