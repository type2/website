Subject: Re: List Stickers, shall I make them?

Great idea...we'll take three. 

Some thoughts, though, some for the old, some for the new:

Not too big, please, especially for the earlier splits
who hardly have a rear window anyway (I know, Thom, some
don't have *any* rear window).

External application, plase. I don't want to 
be pasting something over all those defroster wires, or my 
original Farpherwhatever sticker. 

TIA
