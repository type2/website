Subject: Re: rain &amp; pop-top?

Jeff,

I have weathered several nastly storms in my westy.  If the canvas is in
good condition it will not leak.   Just like stereched canvas on a tent 
the canvas will become saturated with water, but will not leak. If
objects are lying against the canvas, which is wet, they will adsorb the
moisture.  If you discover a leak it will likely be a seam or a open
area.  Duck tape will work for  quick fix, but remove it asap for it
leaves nasty adhesive behind.   No longer than a day or so.   
  I have often been surprised by how quickly the top dries.  You can
spent a hour to two drying asap possible after the rain ended or spent
years smelling mold and mildew.   Just treat it like a good canvas tent.
Always put it away clean and dry.

Call if you have more questions

&gt; Hello all--
&gt; 
&gt; I'm new to Westfalia Camping. Can I leave the pop-top open in the rain? Is it
&gt; water-proof? If I do leave it open will it need a long time to dry before I
&gt; can close it? I'm particularly frightend of mold.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm off on a camping excursion soon and would appreciate any advice on this
&gt; topic from those of you seasoned campers.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks
