Subject: RE Bentley Thermostat housing torque values

-- [ From: Thomas D. Hanlon * EMC.Ver #2.3 ] --

I recently replaced the thermostat in my Vanagon (87 Waterboxer), the
Bentley manual (Back cover under &quot;Coolant system, section 19) says I should
tighten the bolts on the housing to 61 pound/feet, is this correct?  It
seems excessive when the housing is plastic, does anybody know if 61
pound/feet is correct, or what it should be tightened to?

Dave and Other Listees:

That 10 Nm value appears to be a typo or erroneous figure appearing more
than once on that Quick Data back cover table.  Note the preceding and the
following values in the column:  pump pulley 20= 15; thermo switches 30=22;
and then compare the 10=61 value for the thermostat. Using a ratio and
proportion approach,  it would appear that &quot;about&quot; half of 20nm  is 7 1/2
pounds and &quot;about&quot; half of 30nm  is 11 pounds and &quot;about&quot; half of 10 nm is
somewhere at 5 ( plus or minus)) pounds, in the range of 6.1 pounds which
would apply if the decimal were missing.

Note that the same 10 nm = 61 pound feet&quot; value appears at the &quot;thermostat
housing&quot; &quot;specification&quot; under &quot;Water-cooled Digijet and Digifant&quot; further
down the list. 

To my untrained and inexperienced eye, it would appear to be missing a
decimal point. Maybe an engineer or a mathematician amongst us would
analyze the figures.
