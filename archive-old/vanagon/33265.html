So Nathan Lebron says:
&gt; Just found out that after 140k miles, my heads are leaking.   The VW 
&gt; dealer is quoting $850 to replace both of them and a VW garage is telling 
&gt; me $1250 to replace and have it machined( what the hell is that?)
&gt; 
&gt; Help me!  I am not rich yet!

How bad are they leaking?  Check yourself, do not trust the dealer.
If it's minor seepage, you can you a product called BarsLeak to 
seal it up.  You just pour it in your expansion tank and run the
engine until the thermostat just starts to open.  This should take
care of any small leaks.
