The bett things I've found for clamping my fuel lines are the 
racheting plastic 
clamps that are made for surgical tubing.  I  leave it on under 
the car, and when I nedd to stop the flow for a while, I just reach 
under and pinch 
it.  It releases by pulling lightly on a small tab.  There are those
 who would say that this is kind of a dumb way to 
do things, since clamping down on old rubber isn't always  
smart, but I figure if I'm dumb enough to let my lines get 
so old that I need to worry about cracking them, it's my own fault. 
If you go this route, however, get clamps that will fit larger tubing 
than the 8mm we run--you don't want the buggers applying pressure 
when they're relased &amp; shutting off your fuel flow.

The bet thing about it is that I'm never under the bus at three in 
the morning anymore yelling for my brother in law to find a 
pen/pencil/bolt/golf tee/stick.
