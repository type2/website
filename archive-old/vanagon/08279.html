Dear friends.

A repeating problem I see on the list is caused by folks who insist to 
re-transmit the original message when they are making a reply.

Please, please, P L E A S E .... If possible don't send the message again 
if you have no specific purpose to do so when you reply.

Perhaps you can cite the appropriate lines to which you are replying.
