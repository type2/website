Subject: Taps and Dies are so cooooooooool!

The pop out windows on my '62 (like everything else) were
removed.  Some of the screws (there are screw holes in the window
frame, and a big long skinny hinge welded to the bus body)
were drilled out; the rest of the holes were pretty trashed
too.  So, I decided to make all the holes one step bigger and drill
and tap as necessary.  My little Sears Metric tap and die set 
zipped into action and I actually tapped my first threads!!!!

It was a big thrill to see the formerly smooth drilled hole
turn threaded!!!  Some tools are just too coooooooool.

Excited beyond belief,
