Finally got my 88 on the road after an engine rebuild with an additional
head removal b/c of a cracked (rebuilt) head. That's a whole other
story.  Anyway, I need a few parts to finish my resurrection. I need an
antenna, passengere power window switch, and a Wolfsburg emblem.  The
dealer wanted $88 for the window switch. OUCH. If anybody is parting out
a Vanagon with power windows , I'll buy the switch.

Are there any other camping trips planned for the Va. or NC area?
