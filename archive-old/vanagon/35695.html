Subject: Re: Crashworthiness of Bug Vans 

Had an encounter with my '71 Bus about a year ago. On a rainy, wet-street
day, travelling about 40mph on surface street, light ahead goes red, Taurus
ahead slows to stop, I push the brakes and nothing happens (later found
piston failure on rebuilt caliper, just beyond warranty period). I hit him
from behind (he was virtually stopped at time of impact), slowing the van and
pushing him forward. Van still has considerable momentum, so I hit him again.
And again a third time before stopping. Pushed him about 1 1/2 car lengths
into the intersection. Damage to Taurus: a few scratches on bumper (rather
impressive as those bumpers are plastic). Damage to bus: Taurus bumper-shaped
indentation across front sheet metal just above bus bumper. Looked pretty
ugly, but structurally held together rather well. Upon closer inspection
during repair with outer front skin removed from ventilator intake down, I
was rather impressed at the lack of damage internally. The large box where
the vents all meet was undamaged. The lower floor and reinforcement where the
outer panel is attached at the bottom was undamaged as well. Bus now
completely healed with new outer skin. Granted this was not a headon but with
the car ahead stopped it was about a 40mph impact speed. For what it's worth.
