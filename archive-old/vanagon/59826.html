&gt;About $100 for the Freon and $10,000 for the fine. Do not open a system

&gt;The run up in prices on Freon result from the Montreal Protocol of 1989
&gt;that mandated the worldwide elimination of CFC's within a very short
&gt;time frame. We are well into final implementation of that protocol and
&gt;they are getting very serious about enforcement. You may not get caught
&gt;but who do you know that can/will sell you the Freon?
&gt;
&gt;BTW: smuggling Freon in from Mexico is becoming a big business.

What's going on in Arizona re: Freon?
