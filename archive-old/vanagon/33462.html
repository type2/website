Subject: change the stat's and help!

well, i never thought it would happen, but i now own a 2nd generation 
bus.  i could not pass it up.  i swore i would only own split window 
bus's, but not any more.

i just bought a 1975 westfalia bus.  it is fuel injected, auto trans, air 
condition, and other things that i have yet to find or learn about.  the 
reason i am keeping it (at least for a while) is the interior.  this 
thing was never used.  the camper is in mint condition.  everything thing 
is there (i think) and works.  no rips, or worn parts.  ugly thought.  
the questions i have now.

1.  i have two extra boards that have panaling on them.  one is about 
1x1' and the other is about 1x3'.  they look like table parts, but i 
can't figure out where they go.  anyone?

2.  there is a extra padded cousion that is in the spare wheel box.  
(mine is on the nose)  what is it for?  where does it go?

3.  This is a type 4 motor.  it likes to stall at idle when it is cold.  
what would cause that.  

4.  What is the best manuel for this bus?

5.  does anyone have a original or could photocopy a original westy 
manuel so i can find out hoe everything works?

6.  Anything else i sould know. 

thanks to anyone who can help.

take care and God Bless
matt
