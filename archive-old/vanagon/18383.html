Subject: Re: [f] Kavorkian drove a VW

&gt;I believe that the young kid was FROM ARIZONA!!! Way to go!~ (get it?). Dr.
Death could just claim that a leaky exhaust pipe or &quot;gas&quot; heater was to
blame. As usual, I see things like this and think &quot;Parts Bus!&quot; The wife and
I spotted the bus on the report and immediately forgot about the serious
ramifications of &quot;youth&quot;enasia and instead sat up in our seats and
similateously yelled &quot;Late Model!, Late Model!&quot; That's why I love her- Got
her trained good!
I saw the large camper window on the side and wondered if he might have
cobbled a what-not/spice rack inside of it. &quot;Hmmm&quot;, I wondered. 
People see us drive down the road and think that were having a fight because
we never look at each other. We get along fine, we're just looking out of
our respective side windows toward the underside of every bush, behind every
industrial yard fence and down every alley for that little old lady '51 Deluxe.



&gt;Did anyone catch that Dr. Death used to drive a VW bus? He had a
&gt;pre-1972 bay window, white, with curtains and louvered side middle
&gt;windows.
&gt;
&gt;I say &quot;used to&quot; because it was impounded when they found his last
&gt;customer inside it. There was a picture of it being towed away about 2
&gt;weeks ago, in some Bay Area newspaper.
&gt;
&gt;That's the way to go...inside a VW! I hope he gets it back soon.
