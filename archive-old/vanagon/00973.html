Subject:      It's time...

We are loading the van to leave for Buses By The Arch. For those of you who
are going, we'll see ya there shortly. Those who aren't should consider it!

Just a note on the temp controls. I still have trouble with the damn things.
The ability to have that much control is nice but they should all line up the
same way (as far as on/off).

Also, I still haven't seen any phone numbers for the company that someone
(sorry-I forgot who) said had better nose protectors than the dealer. Anyone
have a lead? Later.....
