Subject: Mystery Webber on my 1700cc '73

 Hey all .. I bought a 2bbl Webber for my 73/1700cc a while back from JC

Whitney ... the problem is, I don't really know what model Webber it is,
and I've lost the install/tuning sheet.
 Can anyone suggest what I might have? The Whitney # was 14-6425-X+ and it
cost about $268. I tried calling them. That was a mistake.
 Also, ,when I initially installed it (before my rebuilt, when I only had 
2 cylinders of compression), the linkage was on the driver's side (this 
seemed logical, as the cable was closer to that side), but closer review
of the paperwork I do have tells me to install it with the linkage on the
passenger's side. How do you guys have your's installed?
 Last question - does nayone have a phone # for Webber? 800-info doesn't have any
thing, and I don't know where they are ...
 Thanks a lot.
Dan

73 Camper
