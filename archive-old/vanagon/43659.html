Subject: '71 Ignition Problems

Finally got around to getting the '71 camper ready for the camping season.
Tried to start it and found there to be no ignition. I decided the battery
was dead. It HAD been there for a long time. Put a new battery in it and
still no ignition. I've checked all the fuses, all good. Any ideas where to
go from here?
