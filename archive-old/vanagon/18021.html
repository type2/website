     &gt;1987-1/2 Vanagon Syncro Westfalia, A/C, 5-spd, every option, locking
     &gt;differential, 87K miles. New: alarm, complete brakes, tires,
     &gt;windshield, custom speakers, Ralley lights, curtains, top seals. XLNT
     &gt;condition. $17,500...

     What? $17,500 for an 87?

     Grumble...I guess if I don't talk to these people, I'll
     never get out of the Wannabus catagory, so I will.  If Joel would make
     a separate &quot;Wanna Syncro Westie&quot; count, at least I'd know if
     market forces will support prices like this...

     So what is the difference between an 87 and an 87-1/2?
