Then I must ask why Germans are such a large part of the Atari groups
(mail lists and newsgroups).  There they either carry on in German or
demonstrate that they have a far better command of our language than most
of us will ever have of theirs.  There are just as many esoteric words
used to describe Atari hardware and software as are used here.  And I
don't understand why they would be considered a &quot;developing country&quot; here
but not in the Atari world.  SOMEthing else is different.  The only thing
I can think of is that this group has a much more social orientation, and
anyone only interested in the technical aspects of bus ownership has to
wade through all of that to find what he wants.  It's there in the Atari
groups as well, but less so.  Any other theories?

(I guess if I'm gonna see the response to this I'd better get resub-
scribed, since I fell off sometime over the past few days when my mail
system offended Gerry's somehow.)
