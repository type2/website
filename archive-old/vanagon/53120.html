RE:	Copy of: FS in NC: 91 Syncro Westy - w/ sunroof!

&gt;1991 Vanagon Syncro Westfalia
&gt;72k miles
&gt;a/c, cruise, sunroof $16,500
&gt;919-393-7890
&gt;
&gt;I spoke to one of the owners briefly and yes, it does have both a/c and
&gt;a sunroof...

Hi, what you're referring to as a &quot;sunroof&quot; Is actually a skylite, or roof vent
and most all '84, or '85 up poptop westy's have this. 

Also in my in my notorious &quot;sunroof posting&quot; which *I'M SURE* all of you saw...
(what...like 5 or 6 times!?!?) that was a lenti list server prob.  Not my
fault!!  :&lt;)
I stated that '85 was the last year for the sunroof in the US.  this wasn't
correct.  I meant to say that '85 was the last year they were offered with any
regularity. The few and far between '86 and '87 sunroof models were rare,  due
to the unavailability of the a/c any more on the sunrf. model. 
I apologise if this caused any confusion.
