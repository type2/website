The cotton/gauze model must be oiled to operate properly. You should be =
able to get the proper oil from the dealer where you obtain the filter. =
I used this type of filter for many years when I had a weber on my '74 =
bus. It's a good idea to buy two filters if you decide to go this route. =
Keep a clean one that can be oiled and installed while the dirty one is =
cleaned and dried.
