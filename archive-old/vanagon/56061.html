Subject: Parting out a 1973 412

My 412 will be disposed of soon. Its a shame since it is in decent shape but I 
can't find front struts or ball joints for it and it has a bad shimmy at 35+ 
mph. It has a gas heater that does work that I have no use for, living in 
Florida (it was 86 last week). I would like either to sell it or to swap for a 
A/C unit for my bus. Please E-mail me directly.
