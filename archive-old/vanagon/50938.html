&gt;&gt; Gonna go rip those hoses off now!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; ;) ;) ;) ;)

&gt; ME TOO!

Also, if you remove that nasty oil cooler VW provided a HIDDEN
EXTRA SOURCE OF HEAT!  So run out to the garage and take that oil
cooler off...winter's coming!  VW also provided HIDDEN EXTRA
HORSE POWER in the exhaust!  So while you're removing the oil
cooler, take off the muffler!

Sorry, couldn't resist.

I have the tag which came with my '84 Vanagon keys and the tag
which came with my '67 Deluxe.  It can be a nice authentic
accessory, but I suspect that if it fell out on the ground a PO
or PD (previous dealer) stuck it there for *convenience*.  Either
that or several hundred list members will be out pulling apart
hoses to *liberate* that sano Westy they saw!

If you have the original VW key with the lock number stamped in
it, I suggest you have a copy made.  Then, use the copy and store
the original.  Ever notice how much keys wear with age.  Better
to wear out the copy than the original.
