Marcus,

One possible problem may be that your thottle valve switch needs adjustment.  If
the switch does not close during idle, the control unit is sent incorrect
information concerning the amount of fuel to be injected. ie:  A switch that
does not close will cause more fuel to be injected, causing a higher idle.  This
switch opens when the throttle is depressed.  Before anything else check the
switch.  An easy check is to move the throttle within the engine compartment.
If the switch is working correctly, you should hear the switch click open when
the throttle is opened slightly.  The switch should ultimately be adjested with
a feeler gauge.
