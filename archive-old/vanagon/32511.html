Subject: Micro Fish

The former VW dealer (now Mazda, Volvo) is shutting down completely and 
the parts manager (who I had talked to a while back) called to offer the 
set of fiche for VW/Audi for $100.  Is this reasonable or is this just 
part of the reason that this dealer has always been know as Shifty 
Imports instead of Thrifty Imports?
