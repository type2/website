Someone asked:

1- what is a 050?  It is a mechanical advanvce distributor designed for the
type IV (post '72) engine.  It does not retard the spark for #3 cylinder.  This
is done on the 009, for type I engines, because of the position of the oil
cooler.  That is prob ably why 009s don't idle smoothely.

2- air flaps?  what do you mean - the cooling air flaps attached to the fan
housing?  If so, I have those permanently open.
