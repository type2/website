Subject: Re: Sears Trailhandler A-T tires 

&gt;&gt; transformed the Bus, steering light and responsive (as much as it could
&gt;&gt; be) no sway, no buffeting by semis, rock solid.  
&gt;
&gt;I did not get a reduction in my swaying, buffeting, blowing or wandering
&gt;after putting Trailhandlers on my '89 Westy. I'll recheck the pressure
&gt;though, since it could be off a tad.

I was happy after putting a set of these on the rear, they worked well, and 
I have hauled almost 2000 lb inside when using them.  Try the pressure at 
38-42psi, was good for daily driving.  Maybe a ball joint is getting wobbly? 
 Found this out on my '87 after ditching the 4 plys and putting on 8 plys.  
Handling feel 'sharpened up' to where I could detect upper ball joint slop 
over much reduced tire squirm.
