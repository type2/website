Subject: I have two busses!
Date: Mon, 17 Jul 1995 15:10:41 -0700 (PDT)

		Well, I guess I have joined the ranks of the truely insane, as I 
now am officially in posession of two Volkswagen busses.  My beloved and
faithful 73 Boat, and a Maroon 72 'falia formerly owned by Jeff
Schneiter.  After trying to find a way to tow the bus home for under
$300 and failing, I removed the engine from the 73 and set it in the
back of the Mustang, along with a floor jack, some furniture blankets,
muffler, heater boxes, carbs, etc..  I somehow managed to coerce a
friend of mine from work into driving up to Jeff's house with me, and
we set off in the Mustang, riding really really low.  I mean like on the
bump stops.  Going up the back side of the Grapevine minding our own
business two wannabe gangster kids in a Mustang GT decide that I'm not
allowed to pass them.  Thanks to the 3.55 rearend ratio and a prodigious
amount of throttle we manage to get 3 car lengths in front of them
before they give up and back off at about 110.  Sure wish I had this
engine in my bus.  I-5 is really empty and everyone is hauling butt.
Going 80 I'm getting passed by half the people on the road, including
one 18-wheeler.  I got passed by a Q45 and a Camry that were holding
a steady 95.  I started pacing them about a quarter mile back, figuring 
that they would attract any police that were around.  We made great
time, covering the 400 miles in about 6 hours.  With only 40 more
miles to Jeff's house, we figure we will be there in an hour tops, but
it turns out to all be narrow, winding roads.  Can't drive them quickly
with an engine rolling around in the back.  When all was said and done,
we got to Jeff's around 11:15 - 8 hours after we left home.
		We were joined by Martha and Bradley (who came over to laugh at
my attempt to install an engine) and the next morning I installed the
engine, with help from Jeff, Bradley, and my friend Mike.  Taking the
engine out at home, I found that it wouldn't clear the tranny input
shaft, and I ended up removing the pressure plate and leaving it
in the transmission in order to get the clearance I needed.  Putting
the engine in, I had hoped that things would be different, but it
was not to be.  The damned engine was about 1 inch too long.  So, I
had to take off the fan housing, after which it fit fairly easily.
Still had to angle it in to clear the oil filler tube, but it wasn't
hard.  Put everything back together and the camper started right up.
There was an exhaust leak, and it wouldn't idle (I had forgotten to
reattach the brake booster hose) but other than that, no problems.
Loaded the remains of the original 1700 engine into the bus, and set
off.  At least I tried to, but the right rear drum was frozen.  Rocking
the bus back and forth finally freed it up. 
		We loaded the remains of the original 1700 engine into the bus
and set off about 4 pm Sunday, with Mike following me in the Mustang.
As it started getting dark, I began to wonder if the lights worked.
So, we stopped and checked.  No lights at the left rear.  I couldn't
figure out what was wrong so I just attached a wire from the right rear
light to the left rear (the parking light).  The blinkers also didn't
work, so I used hand signals.  Some other things about the bus.  The
speedometer was very optimistic - I figure it is at least ten percent
off.  I was cruising at an indicated 70mph, but the Mustang was showing
about 62, and I know the Mustang is accurate.  The tires are 185/70/14
all around, a little on the small side.  That must be why.  The engine
hatch hinges were also broken, so we had wired it on, which made it
difficult to check the engine, but when I looked at the taillights I
felt the dipstick and it was not running hot.  Driving without gauges
I wonder how any bus could live long that way.  
		This bus is definately lighter than the 73.  Heading up the
Grapevine, I was able to hold 4th gear until just after it got really
steep, wheras the same engine in the 73 I had had to shift into third
about a mile before the bottom of the hill.  Made it up in 3rd with
power to spare.  On the other hand, visibility out the passenger side
rear is bad because of the full height closet, which covers the windows.
Mike got an incredible 28mpg in the Mustang following me - I got about
20.  I got back home at 1 am, the bus making a lout hissing noise and
idling around 2500 rpm.  I think the idle screw backed out - it does
that a lot.  But, I was much too tired to mess with it.
		The camper is actually in pretty good shape - I'm suprised
none of the Bay area listmembers bought it.  Turns out it was originally
sold in Iceland (really!).  From the records, it looks like it was in
the States by 1979, and lived in both LA and the Bay area at times.
The last smog certificate I found was an exemption, due to off-the-scale
tailpipe emissions and low compression.  Looking at the pistons, I
noticed the skirts were covered with brown streaks, showing that the
rings were leaking badly.  The old engine had 170,000 miles on it so I
guess it did okay.  It has the usual battery tray rust, assorted dents,
missing seals, and the aforementioned electrical problems, but I hope to
bring it back to roadworthiness.  Unlike the 73, which is a hightop,
this bus will fit in my garage!  Thanks again to Jeff for use of his
facilities, and to Martha and Bradley for, umm... for something.  =)
Company!  Yeah, that's it!
