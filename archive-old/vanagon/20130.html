Subject: (fwd) atl. area; 68 bus fs or trade

Found this on rec.autos.vw:

&gt; i have a 68 bus with orig. wwstfalia camper interior
&gt; (wood oaneling and headliner). it is a sweet van that has taken me
&gt; on numerous long road trips. it has been my rv for
&gt; the last 4 years and my everyday driver for 2 before
&gt; that. i put a factory rebuilt long block with all
&gt; new parts except case in it 20,000 (at the most) 
&gt; miles ago. body and motor are strong(no floor pan rustthrough!)
&gt; 
&gt; i will sell for $1200 or trade for an excellent 
&gt; restore on the top of my new bettle convertable.
&gt; 
&gt; i am in atlanta
