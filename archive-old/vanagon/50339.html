Subject: Sorry for the Mistake

Hi all,
	I am really sorry for the problem with the posting of the driveability
fixes. I got the message I sent. I see probably everybody got the same
jiberish. I have resent the documents to those that have requested it. I
sent the documents as an attachment but it didn't come to me that way. It
came in as part of the message. But one person replied that he got the
check sheet but not the written pages? I'm sorry if I caused some people to
incur extra charges on their e-mail accounts for nothing. If anyone has any
ideas as to why I am having what appears to me as a software problem, or a
how to use software problem please help me out. I am using Eudora pro on a
Win95 system. I attached the documents to a message, I use MIME encoding.
Any help would be appreciated.
	This may be the wrong time to be asking for Vanagon help but I need help
finding a part. I need the oil filler/dipstick tube for an 82 Vanagon
diesel. It's the long plastic one that has the pull out filler neck in it.
The oil fill cap screws onto this. TIA
