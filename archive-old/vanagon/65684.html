I noticed it also. I thought about writing them about it, but never got
around to it.

&gt; off subject somewhat.... &lt;
Did bring to mind an engine that International Harvester built back in
the 40/50's (?) that was a combination diesel/gas engine.  Had a diesel
fuel injection system on one side of the engine, and a carburetor and
dist on the other side.  You would start it on gas, and once it was
warmed up, switch over to diesel.  ( I am into old tractors also,
something to keep me busy when the Vanagon is not broken :).

&gt; of an early, carbureted wasserbox motor with &quot;2400cc 6-cylinder diesel&quot;
&gt; captioned underneath.  Did anyone else catch this boo-boo, or is there
&gt; something I am missing?
