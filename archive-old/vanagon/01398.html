&gt;Biggest Vanagon conversion I know of has a 3.6 liter Buick V8.  This was a
&gt;nightmare for a VERY well-equipped shop.  For example, they had to fabricate
&gt;a new distributor, since the stock distributor ends up right where the rear
&gt;door latch is.  But now that the nightmare is over and the thing runs, the
&gt;owner/driver says &quot;Bill,&quot; he pauses, &quot;there are no hills.&quot;

That reminds me of a bus I saw several years ago at a VW event at Commerce, GA.
This bus had a 350 V8 installed in the middle of the bus with an automatic
right where the orginal transmission went.  The radiator was installed in the
'old' engine compartment with a heater core placed in the front.  It had a
box that covered the engine which took up all the rear space.  The only thing
that gave it away on the outsides was the extra metal supports welded along
the bottom sides similar to the rabbit convertable.  A mid-engine bus. :)
