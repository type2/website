Subject:      starting and idle problems no more

My transporter  84 had some heavy duty start and idle problems.
Also the radio only worked when I had the short headlights on.
The drive light did not work.
Know what?
It all went away when i replaced a broken fuse. Cost dkk 2.50 = one
quarter.
Sometimes life is real nice...

PS
Thanks to all who replied on the initial post. Luckily you were all
wrong...(Just kidding)
