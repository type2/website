Subject: let's see if you get it?

for some time i have been going  to ask about a gear shift problem i 
have but dont know how to describe it but as i still dont know but still 
have the problem HEre goes.....Firstly my clutch pedal doesnt have much 
travel before the gear dis engages is this ok or not
seconly the most important problem is thatfinding the correct path for 
the gear shift is dificult but not impossible some thing like moving the 
gear shift through molassis also when i change down from third to second 
i seam to find another gear that is not quit second and not quit 
third just as if the gear have moved into fourth gear but is not in the 
same place as the fourth gear????????? if this is not clear I told you i 
m not clear my self BUT something is wrong
