Subject: Holiday Trek, meet bus owners?

&gt;Subject: Holiday Trek, meet bus owners?

&gt;One stop I want to make is Westphalia, Missouri for a Kodak moment
&gt;similar to Rick Babor's in the 1996 NEATO calender (shameless plug...
&gt;what, you still haven't joined???).

Had the pleasure of meeting Rick and his wife this summer as
they drove north from Missouri to visit relatives in
Wisconsin.  Rick had met a few folks at Buses by the Arch
who know me and they suggested he stop by my place on his
way north.  They called me Mogul of Busdom or some such.
His visit was right after the new NEATO calendar arrived
(never would have recognized him from the picture).

&gt;Anyone that would like to get together (or anyone that needs a ride)
&gt;anywhere between Kansas City &amp; Atlanta please let me know.  Also
&gt;looking for pointers for junkyards and cheesy roadside attractions
&gt;along the way.

&gt;Best wishes for a Happy &amp; Adventure Filled Holiday!

I doubt that I am &quot;between Kansas City &amp; Atlanta&quot;, but
you're welcome to stop here.  If you have your NEATO TTT
Directory (another shameless plug), you'll find me listed in
DeKalb, Illinois.

My wife and I talked about turning our old farmhouse (with
big new addition) into a bed and breakfast, but after the
number of bus people who have stopped, &quot;Bus and Breakfast&quot;
may be more appropriate.
