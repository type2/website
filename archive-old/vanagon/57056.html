&gt; We bought an Acura Legend new, instead.  Zero problems in 165k miles, but
&gt; we hardly drive it anymore. My wife likes the 1986 Vanagon much better
&gt; as a kid-hauler.  Too bad there's nothing to replace them currently.  Even
&gt; the new VW's are not an option, as she refuses to consider automatics.

	There should be plenty of 93 EVs with the 5-speed stick out there
on the used market.  I know
there's at least one.  ;-)

And I agree, automatic is not an option. It's a sentence.

95 EV-C (Beulah), with a stick.
&amp; fondly remembering 93 EV (Stella) with a stick.
