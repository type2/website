Subject: A/C Parts Supplier



Greetings all:
        There have been a number of requests for A/C parts as of late.
Wonder why, is it because it is hotter than hell earlier than normal?  Could
be.  Anyway, I have heard nothing but good things about the company, and
tehy seem to be fairly priced.  They do make rebuild kits for A/C
Compressors on demand.  I think they have lines available too.

Hope this helps,

David Ian Utley

I have no affiliation with the above mentioined company whatsoever.  I
furnish this number as a service to those on the list without hope of
recompence.
