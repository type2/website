&gt; just like all of the other busses of my era.  I think installing one

&gt; done.  I noticed that I was the only bubble top bus at BBTA, which seems
&gt; wierd since there are so many here in California.

There's one in the junk yard right now with an auto-tranny.  Looks just 
like Dave's did before he re-did it.
