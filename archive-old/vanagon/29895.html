Subject: Re: 1988 Syncros?

I do believe it is my 1988 Consumer Guide of new cars.

&gt;In a message dated 95-11-29 22:42:02 EST, you write:
&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;This is true because I read it in one of my 1988 buyer's guides.  They only
&gt;&gt;sold left over '87 Syncros in 1988.
&gt;
&gt;I do believe that there were no USA 1988 Syncros.  I'm curious, what buyer's
&gt;guide had this information?
