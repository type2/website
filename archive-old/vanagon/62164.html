&gt; Sounds like it could be the idle portion of the switch that you are talking

That sounds right,altho it ends up near 3000 rpm.  Adjust?  What's to
adjust?  It seems to work normally, makes a little click, but evidently
the circut stays open (or is it closed?)  Anyway, just yanked one of the
wires on back and it runs fine.  I don't have a Bently, hence all the
questions,ie,  WHAT IS IT?  And do I need it?  What for?
