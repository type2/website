&gt;Hi all! Several days ago I sent a message asking for some parts for my 1978
&gt;Westy. 

In December '94 I bought a motor out of a totalled '78 Westy.  Last month the
guy at the auto shop told me that he pulled all the Westfalia conversion stuff
out of the '78 brown/white body.  Propane, cabinets, water tank, pop-top...everything.
The front end of the bus was caved in to about 6&quot; from the front seats, but most
everything else was intact.  He's storing it for someone that wants the stuff to
install into their panel or Kombi breadloaf.
