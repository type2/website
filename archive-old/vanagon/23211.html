Subject: Vanagon Gauges Solution

I'd like to thank all of you that responded to my Vanagon Gauge questions.  I
think what I'll try is to modify an additional instrument cover and attach it
on top of the regular cover as follows: 
Get a Vanagon instrument cover at a wrecking yard and cut a section out of
the middle of it, both side to side and front to back.  Attaching (maybe with
some fiberglass on the inside?) the remaining four corners back together
should yield a unit thats both narrower and shorter.  I can then cut off part
of the bottom to make it match the top of the existing instrument cover.
 Then with some black plastic I can make a face in which I'll cut the three
or four 2-1/16&quot; holes for the instruments.  Wiring for the new gauges would
go through a hole cut in the regular instrument cover.
This leaves 2 (maybe more?) problems? 
1. Will the pieces of the cut instrument cover come together at some ugly
angles that are too sharp to grind away?
2. The seams in this pieced together cover will make the surface look pretty
bad.  What can I use to cover up this mess?  Some &quot;crinkle&quot; paint?  Maybe
some vinyl?
Any suggestions appreciated.  Is the above description at all clear? Am I
crazy for going to all this work for some gauges?
