Subject:  more help please :(

Hey all

First, the continuing saga of my '78 bus's electrical goofiness.  To
update, my right rear taillight assembly had been acting goofy.  I was told
to clean up the ground connections and all that.  Well, that worked for a
while.  Now, however, the right rear taillight and side marker light do not
work.  Neither does the license plate light, but that's because its power
comes from the right rear taillight (traced the wires).  All bulbs are good. 
The turn signal on that side works fine and so does the back-up light. 
Actually, today I found one more ground connection that I cleaned up real
nice and now the back-up light on that side is no longer dimmer than the
one on the left.  Anyway, I cleaned up all the connections on the taillight
part (they were really corroded) but that didn't fix anything.  I tested the
socket with my test lamp and it seems that I'm not getting any juice to the
contact that supplies the taillight.  Does anyone know what might be
wrong with this and how to fix it?  This is really frustrating 'cause every
time I think I have it fixed, it acts up again.

OK, more electrical goofiness:  Now it seems the parking lights up front
(as well as the front side marker lights) have decided not to work.  I
attribute this to my bumping around under the dash as I was removing my
speedometer cable.  I thought that perhaps I had pulled a wire off of the
headlight switch, but I checked and they're all there.  When you turn on
the turn signals or the hazard flashers, they come on just fine.  When
you try to turn on the parking lights with the headlight switch, they stay
off.  The headlights do come on when you pull the switch all the way
out.  Has anyone had any experience like this???  I've looked and looked
but I can't seem to find anything loose or missing.  

Now for the speedometer story:  I went to VW today to buy a new lower
half for my speedometer cable, as mine is broken.  So, they bring it up on
the CD-ROM and the part that I want is no longer available.  What VW
makes instead is a long one-piece cable that goes directly from the
wheel to the back of the speedometer.  It bypasses the little black box
that tells you when to check your EGR and catalytic converter and what
not.  They want $45 for it.  I put in an order for it but hopefully someone
on the list has a spare one sitting around that they don't need that I could
buy from them.  Please!  I don't want to pay $45 for this part.  

So if anyone can help with any and all of the above, please respond
ASAP.

Thanks,
Sean
