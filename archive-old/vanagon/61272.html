Subject: Re: Westy roof rack question

I have thules mounted on the glass pop top of my 87.  I carry 2-3 masts
and 2-3 boards for most of the summer (the Gorge is right up the road)
and can still pop the top.  To do this I mounted the racks as far back
as possible to facilitate popping the top without unloading.  This means
the boards stick off the back a little bit though.
