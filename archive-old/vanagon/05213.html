I was wondering -- why is there a VINTAGVW
list, a vanagon list, and rec.autos.vw and
no cross-connection.  The volume on the
mailing lists is such that a high volume
system like news seems so much more appropriate.
Frankly, I can't handle the volume (been here
only a fortnight) without a better way to 
discard cruft that I am uninterested in,
and that is a problem that is already solved
with news.  I'm not a newbie to net issues
(by a long shot), so don't assume that.
If this is a long dead issue, could I get
a succinct reason why.  If it is historical
and/or inertial, does anyone want a cross-
over engine to appear?
