Subject: BUSES, VALUE &amp; RESALE

I suggest tracking down a copy of &quot;Old Cars Price Guide&quot; as
another post recommended.  It lists VW buses back to the
early 50s (but I forget how &quot;new&quot; it covers).  For all
models (standard, deluxe, truck, camper, etc.) it lists
condition categories (1-5) and gives an estimated value for
each category.  1 is primo, fully restored and 5 is parts
only, so there is some room for interpretation.

I haven't bought a copy for a couple of years, but I used to
follow &quot;value&quot; on my '67 deluxe.  The first few years a
category 1 was $2800, then it went to $3200, then to $3600,
I think. Also (do I advertise this?) an article in Auto Week
last year, on car price speculation, listed pre-68 buses
worth $2000-3000 now as jumping in price to the
$20,000-$25,000 range in the next five years as all those
old hippies who sold out bring in bucks and want to
re-capture their youth.

You are right about the sexual/age discrimination situation
in the insurance scam (I wouldn't call it business).
Legislation in California aimed at making men's and women's
hair cuts cost the same (whether it it takes more time for
women or not) is another good example.  I guess it is OK to
discriminate on age/sex/marital status as long as it is
against single males in the prime of their life.
