Subject: Re: German license plates



&gt;Jan Peters (that lucky SOB) has an original German bumper on his '91
&gt;syncro, which has a licence plate indentation that matches the euro-style
&gt;plate.

&gt;Coyote


This matches only German, Netherlands, UK, France and Austrian plates. The 
other
countries have different sizes.
