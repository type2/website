I am selling all of my collectables from my air-cooled days.

This includes several framed VW ads from &quot;TIME&quot; magazine, tons of
&quot;dinky cars&quot;, lots of collectables (die-cast, rubber, models, etc),
and some books/brochures.

SERIOUS INQUIRIES ONLY PLEASE!

Looking for around $500.00 for everything.

Please call me at 780-8821 (pager) to make an appointment to see it
all.

Thanks,

Rob.
