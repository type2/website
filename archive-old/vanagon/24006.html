&gt;Joel, unless I read the stats wrong, this one will be the oldest on the list.

except that Thom Fitzpatrick with his 56 Kombi is back on the list ... so
they'll have to fight it out for Date of Manufacture. :)  but yes, the 56's
are the oldest on the list. there is a fellow &quot;out there&quot; on the internet
who has a 53 bus, but he didn't want to stay on the list (something about
&quot;work&quot; or something like that).
