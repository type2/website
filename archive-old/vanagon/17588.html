Subject: Re: 71 bus, brakes, front end

&gt;New subscriber needs help! I've just bought a 71 bus (1600 dual port) and 
&gt;need to do some pretty major brake work and maybe some front suspension 
&gt;work. 
&gt;
&gt;1) The power brake system is beyond my expertise...is there a way to 
&gt;retro-fit a simpler non-power system to this bus?  The vacuum hoses are 
&gt;off, the bus will stop if you stand up on the brake pedal.  I don't need 
&gt;great stopping power...the bus is going to spend its final days on a 
&gt;small Gulf coast island with only sand roads and will never get over 40 
&gt;mph.  
&gt;

Try to get the power booster working, it could simply be that the hoses
aren't hooked up.  This is not really expertise, just hoses.  It's worth it,
regardless of whether you're stopping for 40 foot diesels or 3 foot goats.
Retro-fitting would be far more labor and money.  Most people are
retro-fitting to what you have already.

&gt;2) All of the rubber boots protecting the ball joints have rotted away.  
&gt;Would it be easier to change them individually or replace the whole 
&gt;suspension system as a unit.  I've never worked with suspensions, but am 
&gt;willing to if it's doable.
&gt;

Bad situation sir.  Ball joints are not easy, but review your manuals and
see if it's do-able.  If it's really going that far outback, maybe give up
and remember to spray the front down with water every other trip.  I doubt
if it's easier to replace the entire front end, but, hey, I haven't done it
so I don't _really_ know.  With the right tools, anything is possible.

Eug,
'71

&gt;Thanks in advance for any advice from anybody!  I have the Idiot's bible, 
&gt;Haynes manual, and a Chilton's manual.   Mitch
