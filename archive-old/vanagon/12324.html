Subject: Re: Replacement speakers for '87 Vanagon

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Can anyone recommend a good replacement speaker for the front and back
&gt;&gt;factory installed Blaupunkt stereo speakers? I recently installed a new
&gt;&gt;Clarion tape deck, but the sound is very tinny, I think because of the
&gt;&gt;speakers. Also, the front speakers need to be flush mounted because of
&gt;&gt;the window crank being so close, so that limits your options.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Thanks,

The Blaupunkt speakers on vanagons are actually very good speakers. The only
problem is that they are small and sound poorly on frequencies below 250 hz
(no bass).

What I did was I bought a pair of 6 1/2 inch subwoofers. I flush mounted
them below the original Blaupunkt speakers and changed a little bit of the
wiring. The stereo output will drive the subwoofers directly and a capacitor
in the range of 150 uf is connected in serial with the Blaupunkt then
in parallel with the subwoofer. The capacitor is actually two 300 uf ones
in serial with polarity opposite to each other.

The result is great. The Blaupunkt is really great when it is driven without
bass. The subwoofer produces plenty of bass. The combination is great.
In fact I can play music very loud. There is no distortion at very loud level.

This is how it looks:
                                 300uf  300uf
                                 +        +
