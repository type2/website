Subject: 02 sensor, three-wire, dealer vs. Bosch

I just spent about 40 mins reading through archives and I can see no
reference to the best place to buy a three-wire (heated) 02 sensor. (for my
90 syncro)

I am tempted to call up a Bosch dealer and a VW dealer (camelback) and see
who has the best factory part and just order it.

But I feel strongly someone on the list must have already been through this
and know the answer as to what to do. I seem to remember someone saying to
just buy a generic 3 wire sensor of some sort at FLAPS and make up your own
VW connector at the end of the wires. I wonder if I should check at Parts
Place and Bus Boys too. 

This sensor is simply a spare, by the way, for storage in a nook &amp; cranny of
the van for use in emergency while on long trips to Canada/Labrador, etc.
