Subject: Splitty Convoy new record!

Biggest and best SSVC meet ever - and the convoy to the brilliant Stanford
Hall Show was about 140 split vans plus &quot;others&quot;. Stretched for 2.5 miles!
Including guests from Germany and Holland - what a weekend. Off to work now
absolutely shattered...shuffle round in zombie mode I think!
Will post details etc later!
