Subject: A Leetle more info on V6 Vanagon


The Chevy 2800 V6 in that '80 vanagon, also has a 2-barrel Holley 350cfm
carb on it. Don't know if it oiginally had a carb, or FI, or whatever;
but this is what's in there now. Pressing the pedal to the floor, only
gets you about 1/3 the full throttle travel, according to the PO, but
it still books. Gas mileage? Well... uh... but it has a great personality. 
:)
