Subject: RE: flowbee at bodega!

hmm... sounds like some people don't NEED power outlets/hookups in the
Vanagons... (a flowbee? do you have some of that hair replacement spray paint,
too???)

I'm SO excited:  The flowbee hair cutting (sucking) machine I ordered
from Damark just arrived!!!  I'll be bringing it to Bodega and will
be willing to give haircuts to anyone interested.   - martha
