Subject: Contacts for VDO Gauges

&gt;Date: Tue, 14 Nov 1995 09:51:04 -0600
&gt;From: peter_jensen_at_MERCK.COM(Peter Jensen)

&gt;I am looking for the following gauges senders, and hardware
&gt;to monitor the, Oil Pressure, Coolant Temperature, and
&gt;Alternator Output (preferably in Amps), and maybe Fuel
&gt;Pressure on a 1989 Waterboxer Westy.  Any contacts or advise
&gt;on how to proceed? VDO is $$$, but I would prefer quality
&gt;and something that matches the stock gauges.

&gt;Thanks,

&gt;Pete

&gt;(Afraid of idiot lights and gauges with out numbers)

Pete,

I am afraid to post this to the list ... I tracked down the
VDO catalog I bought when I started restoring my 67.  I am
ashamed to say it is the 1983 edition.  Yes, the restoration
took that long.  At any rate, this is what is (or *was* in
1983) on their literature:

980 Brooke Road
P.O. Box 2897
Winchester, VA 22601
(203)665-0100

945 &quot;A&quot; So. Greenwood Ave.
Montebello, CA 90640
(213) 724-2600

The catalog and price list gives &quot;The VDO Story&quot;, a guide to
selection, examples of the (then) four lines, a listing of
senders, mounting accessories, ordering guide, and function
guide.

At that time the lines were:
1) Series 1 (like old stock VW, chrome bezel)
2) Cockpit (same as #1 only *black* bezel)
3) JetCockpit (same as #2 with exposed screw mounts)
4) TopCockpit (Same as #2 to mount &quot;on top&quot; of dash)

Since then I have seen the Vintage series (same as #1 only
with &quot;old&quot; style lettering.  Included are tachometer,
voltmeter, ammeter, oil temperature, water temperature, oil
pressure, vacuum, turbocharger, cylinder head temperature.

The sender list is fairly specific, including
temperature/pressure range, thread, and part number for each
application.  The mounting accessories include
in-dash/under-dash brackets, reducing rings, dimmer rings,
mini-consoles, custom consoles (look like they would be
perfect for mounting on top of Vanagon instrument pod, BTW),
wiring kits, warning lights, two-way adapter senders, and a
matching tire pressure gauge.

Everthing EXCEPT what VDO stands for!

The catalog was $2.00US then and I have no idea where I got
the address or phone number to contact them originally.
DB&amp;HVWs does not list them in the advertising index in the
back of each issue (even in 1983, I checked).  I guess
DB&amp;HVWs had an article and included contact phone or
address.

So, anyone up to trying a couple of twelve-year-old
phone numbers?
