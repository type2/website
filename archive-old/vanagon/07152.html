Subject: RE: Berg short-shift for Vgon

Cetin Seren wonders whether he could keep his airconditioning when he goes to
six cylinders aircooled.  Answer is yes, I think, with some homebrewing of
brackets and lengthening of hoses.  Porsche engine mounts the compressor on
the right rather than left, so stock hoses probably wouldn't reach.

I've talked to ICE and they make aftermarket airco for Vanagon and Porsche.
They would be happy to sell a combo platter:  Porsche flavor compressor mounts,
with the rest of the Vanagon kit.  Price between $1200 and $1300 last time I
talked to them.  You install it, or have it installed.
