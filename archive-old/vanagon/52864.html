Subject: Re: O2 sensor

When my o2 went belly-up last-year at smog time, my mechanic tried to sell
me a new o2 for $85. I went to Grand Auto, and picked up one for $45. Went
back to smog control land (failed but it was becuase my cat. had burned out
and was now a hollow tube) and passed with the $45 02 sensor. Never had a
problem since.

&gt;getting the right part (no splicing, heat shield fits) for around $90 
&gt;from Vee Parts in National City, CA.
