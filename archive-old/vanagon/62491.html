Subject: RE: bra's

Ron,

Wolf had a different bra for later Vanagons with plastic bumpers. The one for 
metal bumpers also clipped on in front of the doors where the plastic bumpers 
would interfere. Thus I can't use my '87 bra on my '91.

Does the OEM bra work with both bumper types?

&gt;&gt;  Do the dealers still stock masks for Vanagons?

&gt;I doubt many dealers do, but I have them for $99.95, which is less than the
&gt;dealers charged anyway.  
&gt;These are the genuine O.E.M. Volkswagen bras,
