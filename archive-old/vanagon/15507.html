Subject: Gas Tank Update (Part III)

Yo,

	OK, the tank is in, bolted down, hooked up, and has about 2 gallons
of gas in it.  So far so good!

	I managed to use the original filler neck, albeit after defrocking
it (removing the collar :))

	Everything is a tight fit, and I will be watching closely for the next 
couple weeks to make sure nothing comes loose or anything...

	I also put in a bulkhead fitting, got it from the local speed shop,
cost me about $6 or so, pretty anodized blue aluminum, which I promptly
painted...  I also replaced ALL of my fuel lines while I was in there,
and cleaned up my reserve valve, etc.

	So, I guess I've proven that it _can_ be done (although I vaguely
recall someone J Christensen maybe? having said they did this before...)
	
	I also put in some insulation on the roof of the engine compartment
all the way to the front (FIF) of the tank, which I hope will cut down
ont he noise.

	Now the bummer:  I get the engine in and everything put together, and
I have no electrical anywhere in the bus.  Nuttin, zippo.  Well, I guess
tomorrow I get to take all this stuff apart and track down the
electrical goblins... :(
