Subject: Re: A newcomer seeks advice...

&gt;
&gt;I've been lurking for a little while, and now I'm ready to ask a question...
&gt;My better and I are looking for transportation, mostly for road trips. RIght
&gt;now in the running are:
&gt;
&gt;a) a 1971 camper, some rust, rebuilt engine and clutch,
&gt;
&gt;and
&gt;
&gt;b) a 1986 Wasserboxer, scratches on body, 130K, new clutch...
&gt;
&gt;I'm leery of the Wasserboxer because of parts cost, but it drives great. The
&gt;guy selling it says the person who sold it to him said &lt;whew!&gt; that VW
&gt;recalled it in '89 and put a new engine in. He doesn't believe him, I'm not
&gt;sure I do. Any thoughts?
&gt;
&gt;The '71 would be just fine, but &lt;gulp&gt; we're driving to Minnesota for
&gt;Christmas! (Brrr.....) I am trying to wish an acceptable heat system into
&gt;existence.

        I'd go with the '71-much less expensive to operate, and easier for
you to fix. Heat problems can be helped greatly by many of the suggestions
found in the Vanagon archives, or in Bob Hoover's sermons. Both of these
are linked from my web page, URL is below in .sig. Good luck, whatever you
do!

Peace,
