Subject: Vanagon with Porsche power.


This months VW motoring has an article on a '84 Vanagon with a 911
Carrera 3.2 litre producing 231 bhp and 210 lb/ft of torque. There
are lots of pictures of the installed engine but details are rather
few. No performance figures are given on the grounds they may be
`self-incriminating', but it is stated that the van will do 100mph
in third gear, still with *two* gears to go. 

I pressume that this means the Porsche tranny has been put in as
well, but it isn't mentioned anywhere in the text. Brakes,
suspension and tyres seem to have been left standard although
the owner plans to use porsche discs all round at a later date.

Apart from that it looks like a inofensive standard white/blue/red 
camper, the only external difference being a porsche badge under the 
VW one.
