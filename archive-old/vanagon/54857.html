Subject: RE: Blizzaks on the EV 


I hope you guys don't mind my joining this discussion.  I agree with 
mdstockr, that it is desirable to use the most tire 
available.  In some of the previous postings, the axle load vs tire 
rating was an issue, various numbers were generated.  What I didn't see 
being taken into consideration is that when your heavy van hits a bump or 
when taking a corner at speed, the load on the tires (and their 
sidewalls) can be greatly increased.  My other observation would be that 
Vanagons are rather tall, stilty vehicles.  I must admit, I havn't had a blow-out yet, 
but I always imagined that it would be sketchy, especially at freeway 
speeds (to further concurr that more is better for prevention purposes).  
Currently, I am running Uniroyal Laredos (C-rated, reinforced 
sidewalls) all-season tires.  I have had 1 pair for 30k and they still 
have half of their tread left.  They have excellent traction in dry and 
rainy conditions.  I went to Tahoe once with them and had good control in 
light snow conditions (I don't think they have an aggresive enough tread 
for serious winter conditions).  The best part is that they were only 
$43. ea. at Costco.  If anyone has any feedback on this tire I would be 
interested.  Without having used any other tire on my van, I would give 
them the thumbs-up.  Frankly though, I have been told by many folks that 
Michelins are the way to go.  Maybe next time, if I can fork-out close to 
$400.  for new donuts.  My understanding is that we are limited in our 
choices if we want the reinforced tires in Vanagon sizes.  Ok, I'm done.

&gt; I am a big fan of putting the most tire possible on a vehicle.
&gt; 
&gt; Plus, Volkswagon/Audi typically undertires their vehicles.
&gt; 
&gt; Therefore, I recommend using reinforced tires on Vanagons.
&gt; 
&gt; As for EV's, I have no idea what they take.  But, if VW specifies reinforced tires, I would 
&gt; comply.
&gt; 
&gt; As for Conti tires, I can not recommend them.  I am not satisfied at all with their quality.
&gt; 
&gt; My wife purchased an Audi Quattro several years ago.  This car had Conti's and whenever 
&gt; there was snow on the road, the car would wander all over the road!  Very unstable.  Even 
&gt; though the tires only had 10k miles on them, I put a new set of Michelins on it.  The car's 
&gt; been wonderful in snow ever since.
&gt; 
&gt; I always recommend Michelin, Dunlop and Yokohama tires.  But, I don't know if Dunlop and 
&gt; Yokohama make reinforced tires for this market.

&gt; &gt; To MD Stocker:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;               Given your experience in the tire testing business, what
&gt; &gt;would you personally put non-reinforced tires on a Vanagon or EV? I ask
&gt; &gt;this because of Ric's new posting and because last year I looked into
&gt; &gt;buying a set of Nokian All -weather tires for the EV and decided against
&gt; &gt;it because they were NOT reinforced. The dealer's handbook actually listed
&gt; &gt;the EV 206/65/15 size but gave a non-reinforced tire for it that could
&gt; &gt;take about 1500 lbs for maximum load. But after discussions here and with
&gt; &gt;my local mechanic, I decided not to buy them and went back to the replacement
&gt; &gt;reinforced Conti's (an average all around tire with a great warranty). So
&gt; &gt;any advice you could offer would be interesting.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Thanks,
&gt; &gt;
