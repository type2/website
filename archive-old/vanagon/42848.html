Comment on the Air Cooled variety - Have had no bad reports on Wasserboxer
varieties we've sold

A little over 2 years ago, there were a bad batch of Spanish heads that came
through.  What was found bad was the crappy Valve Springs that would break
apart in less than 4000 miles.  So when I replaced my heads on the 80
Wanagon, I just reused my springs off of my old heads onto the Spanish
variety.  Oh and yes, I spent the moola and installed Sodium Filled Exhaust
Valves (about $60-$70 EACH-YIPES!).  But in the long run they're worth it. :)
 Yep, all that I've been able to find at both VW and the Aftermarket is
Spanish heads.  'Course they's way too much at the dealer at last report -
coulda changed tho'.

PS:  Have had ABOLUTELY no problems with the heads in 25K miles.  And no PR
Tube leaks either since I used my VITON seals on 'em.
