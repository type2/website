Subject: '81 Westy rust problem
Date: Thu, 2 Feb 1995 20:36:36 -0600 (CST)

I have an '81 westy, which I am proud to say has been one of my most 
trouble-free cars I have owned, besides the rabbit. I bought it in Denver 
back in 1990.  The body is mint with no rust because most of Colorado is 
&quot;salt free&quot;.  Well since 1992, I have been in Wisconsin and have noticed 
that rust is forming at the body panel seam right above the propane tank 
and below the hook-ups. I have tried to control it, but it seems to be 
coming from inside the panel. I cannot access this area from underneath. 
The only other way I can see is removing the sink/stove/frige deal to get 
it from above, Any suggestions on how to handle this?
