Subject: AUDI 5 Cyl. Swap Site


Time is come to introduce you the URL for the
'VW Bus Engine Swap Page' at

http://www.relitech_dot_com/helmut

Many thanks to all the people who helped me
to get into this stage. Of cause, the pages
are not complete. But they show you what will
come in future.

To avoid work for corrections I please you to
send me all your comments and wishes what to
find at this site.

Thanks a lot, have a nice weekend,
Helmut
