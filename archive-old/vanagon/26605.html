Subject: RE: Brake line replacement.


&gt;This bus hasn't been registered since 1983 so
&gt;I'm none too surprised.  Here's the question, should I try to flush out
&gt;and use the existing lines or should I just replace the whole system?
&gt;What would YOU do?


If it were me, I'd replace all the cyls (Master and six wheel cyls), bolt
them up to the existing lines, and try it. Maybe I'd also replace the
fabric hoses that join the wheels to the main steel lines too.

Drive it around, find a lonely area not too far from home (like, walking
distance  &lt;g&gt;), and slam on the brakes real hard several times. Then
get out and inspect ALL lines and wheels. any further signs of dripping,
and maybe it is indeed Hoover time.

If not, don't worry, be happy.
