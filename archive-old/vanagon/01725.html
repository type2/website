&gt;I love VW vans but I'm spoiled by the performance of my GTI.  A late 
&gt;Vanagon with maybe 150hp and a decent tranny would be oh-so-nice.  Does 
&gt;anyone know a source of conversions, kits, or information?
&gt;
There was a nice and informative discussion on this topic a couple of
weeks ago. I saved it all. I'll forward it to you if you send me your
e-mail address before tomorrow 7/12, 10am ('cuz I'll be gone for 2 weeks).
Kennedy Engineering offers conversion kits for all sorts of engines. Ask
for their catalog at 1-805-272-1147.
