I had a thought about the old stuffy combustion
chamber, maybe someone with a windtunnel/
supercomputer could do the experiment!
If you made a hole or otherwise modify the plastic
cap that covers the fridge vent so that a bernoulli
effect was generated when wind passed over it,
would this be enough to keep the combustion
chamber fresh and sweet? (of course one
would open the condensation valve at the base
of the fridge, air from inside of van would be
drawn out through fridge to exterior).
 
Just a goofy thought in the shower
