Subject:       Re: $25,000 in Syncro Camper repairs

Hi Derek.  WOW!  What a pathetic repair history.  I almost feel 
sheepish is saying that I have been luck (at least so far).  I, too, 
would be in dismay, and disarray about what's next!

&gt; So flush with cash I optimistically purchased another syncro camper, brand
&gt; new, 1990, for exactly $23,000.

We purchased our Syncro Westy, new (factory order which took 9 
months!) in which we took delivery in April/90.  We paid nearly 
$38000 CDN for it.  It is white, a/c, Heidelberg radio (option back 
then), 6 year unlimited mileage warranty, coco mats, and block 
heater.  Us Canadians sure pay dearly, eh?
  
&gt; Would my streak of horrible luck with repair expenses end now that I was on
&gt; my third van? Would the constant repairs stop? 

Initially, after a couple months, and 3500 km the engine water pump 
went... leaking coolant from the breather vent.  We had numerous fit 
and finish type problems, and the van spent a lot of time in the shop 
for the first 2 years.  We had decorator nut caps missing on the 
skylight bolts, the skylight leaked from the bolts through the roof, 
windshield leaked, passenger door seal had to be replaced, leaked 
water through the winshield washer filler neck, and steering column.  
The stove had to be rebuilt as it was leaking gas while in operation, 
and all the cabinets creaked, and groaned (just had to be tightened). 
The inner oil filler tube (the extension part) was missing, and the 
rear brake adjusters were frozen right from the factory (back the 
first week to get this fixed).  The high beam indicator (blue led) 
went very dim, and had to be replaced at my cost, both sliding 
windows were leaking water from between the metal frame and the 
rubber (luckily not from under the paint).  The rf speaker had to be 
changed as it was always buzzing, and both poly liners in the front 
doors had to be replaced as they were leaking water into the van.
Last September I lost my second engine waterpump... on extended warranty.
We also had the wiring harness put in for the air flow box to stop 
the engine cut-out problems.. that actualy worked!

&gt; We do not pay to garage my van here in NYC because we don't have to park it
&gt; on the street much--it is always in the dealership being fixed. 

I sure felt like that, too.  Our problems were little niggly things, 
except for the 2 waterpumps, and everything was covered under 
warranty except the blue led.


&gt; &quot;Honey, what do you think is causing that?&quot; asks my wife, about the
&gt; clunking, about the stuttering, about the fact that the van just won't run,
&gt; and we have to abandon it and rent a car, in a strange town.  
&gt; 
&gt; But the point is that I've learned so much through all these experiences.
&gt; 
&gt; Wait a minute!  WHY WOULD I WANT TO LEARN THIS?!!!!  I NEVER planned to be a
&gt; motor head! What happened to me?! 

It's a lemon.  VW should have bought it back from you.  This is nuts, 
and I sympathize.  I was getting quite frustrated with our van, but I 
hung in there.  We decided to keep it until the original factory 
warranty terminated (which ws 3 years/60000 km).  If it didn't 
smarten up we were going to dump it.  Fortunately, the van has been 
great the last 3 years (touch wood, BIG TIME!!).  I can forgive the 
waterpump... sometimes things happen.

&gt; My warranty expires in 1997. When that happens, what should I do?  

If it doesn't behave itself up until the warranty expires, dump it.  
It would be a nice selling point to have some warranty left on the 
van for resale... is it transferrable?

&gt; I am contemplating suicide.  

Don't do that!  Buy another van, and start over :)  

In contrast, our Golf only went in for regular scheduled maintenance. 
I had a valve cover gasket go on us.  VW did a good job and that 
vehicle.

Hang in there,
Harry.
