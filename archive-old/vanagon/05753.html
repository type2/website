Did anyone get their rotors turned when they replaced their pads?

There're also these anti-squeal compounds that you're supposed to be able
to stick on the back of the pads to help keep them quiet, although I've 
never had to use them.

Although I don't have metallic pads (like the Metal Masters) on my van,
I have them on a car, and I think they work pretty well.  I don't see a
specific reason why metallics wouldn't work on a VW bus/van/camper, unless
the tolerances are really crappy (on the pad, not the vehicle).
