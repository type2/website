Subject:       12v dropping resistors

Markus just mentioned the 12v to 6v 'kit' he'd recieved that looked like 
a resistor with a heat sink... hmmmm.

To drop 12v to 6v with merely a resistor will require a specific
resistor based upon the amperage draw of the device (or entire
circuit) you intend to supply 6v for. One resistor can't apply to
all loads/circuits/devices!   the mathematics to calculate this
resistor value are simple but i can't remember them!!

Here's a 'practical' non-math approach i've used in other
applications. it has the advantage of not needing to know the
amperage draw of the circuit. 

1. take a heavy duty rheostat (i don't know where i find this stuff
but it just turns up in my junk boxes) of say 0-100 ohms and hook
this in SERIES with your device (6v wiper motor). 

2. hook a voltmeter across the terminals of the device. 

3. turn rheostat to full resistance and hook to 12v source.  watch
voltmeter and turn rheostat down until the desired voltage at the
device is achieved. the voltage will start low and go to high as you
decrease the resistance on the rheostat.

4.  disconnect the circuits and measure the resistance of the 
rheostat.  go to your electronics store and buy as heavy duty (high 
wattage rating) resistor as you can find in the ohmage that matches 
the rheostat value.  

5. try the circuit out with your new resistor to see if the resistor 
heats up excessively, if it does, the wattage rating isn't high 
enough and you need to get a higher rating one or hook 2 resistors of 
twice the desired resistance in parallel.
