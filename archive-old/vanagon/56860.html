Subject: Syncro Hard Shifting in Snow

I was wondering if any other Syncro owners experience hard shifting while
driving in the snow.   After driving on snow covered roads for any length of
time, a large accumulation of road &quot;slush&quot; builds up between the rear
section of the shift linkage and the main chassis member. It seems as though
there should be some sort of shield or plate to prevent the build up. I had
a 1987 Westy manual trans. and I don't seem to remember any shifting
problems, though it's possible that it happens on the syncro and non syncro
versions. Any insight would be helpful.  

 Thank You,
  Kris Weber
  86 Westy Syncro.
