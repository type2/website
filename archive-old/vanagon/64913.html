Hi all

My Transporter 84  1.9 gas is dripping.

Looks like a new motor is needed.

Would there by any chance be any listees from Denmark or Germany, who
would know about such a thing for sale and with some kind of guarentee?

I was thinking that maybe I could repair the heads and put in new
gaskets, but I suppose I have to remove the motor, and I do not have
access to a lift.
Do you need a lift for that?

Love from
Knud
