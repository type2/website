Subject: Re: tent FS from newsgroup

&gt; on.  The tent is the orange with a blue top and has a zippered opening
&gt; for connecting to the camper.  Is there any kind of market for people
&gt; interested in it, and what are people willing to pay for this kind of
&gt; thing?

Alright, go make pigs of yourselves again and bid this up to... what?, say
$600 this time around. See what I care.  Anyone care to volunteer as the
designated buyer, and keep the bidding sane/solo?  Tim Smith


PS: I have no interest bla blah blah, already have same tent (not FS!)
