Subject: Re: forced induction/Rusty's back

On his return to the list, Rusty suggests:
How about running a long hose, the length of the van,  from the mouth of the
carb up to a bracket positioned to the area right near the driver's head.
When the tachometer nears 3500RPM the driver could simply blow real hard
into the tube (ala breathometer) and increase the psi to the desired volume
for the desired length of time. The performance would increase and you could
get a real head rush at the same time. A flex mount bracket could allow the
passanger(s) to become more than just ballast on long trips. The options are
scary. I bet you wouldn't see Minivan drivers do that trick and you'd
probably get more people waving at you!
Sorry, I couldnt resist

Hey Volks,

&gt;main problem is that my intake is restrictive...
