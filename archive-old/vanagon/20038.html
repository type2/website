Subject: RE: THE DIRTY WORK

&gt;I'd like to point out that gasoline is a really good solvent and

Not to mention fire starter, explosive charge, skin irritant and brain cell 
killer to boot. DON'T DO IT!! 

If you must, try Kerosene, sold as lamp / space heater fuel sometimes. Don't 
buy the white gas Coleman fuel, that's not kersoene. Better yet, try one of 
the less toxic citrus based cleaners first. One lister did a test that 
indicated it worked as well or better than commercial products such as GUNK 
(tm). Oven cleaner and scrubbing for that final fresh shiney aluminium case 
look was rec'd on Porsche list, I've never tried tho'. I use GUNK to keep 
the outside cleanish, $5 spray tin does a lot, get a stiff bristle parts 
brush, it should be fine. Washes off with water, leaving another a nasty 
environmental problem which I haven't a solution for.     tim s.
