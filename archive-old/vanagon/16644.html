Subject: 73 Kombi rotted jack points

Greetings All,

Can anyone help?

Last night I went to jack up the front of the vehicle using the jack point
on the left. But before the wheels could get off the ground a nasty creaky/
crunchy noise could be heard :(
I did a bit of investigation (poking with a screwdriver) around the jackpoint
and they have indeed been eaten by the rust monster.

I plan to get hold of replacement jack points and weld them on....
Should there be other things taken into consideration ie more welding to be
done around this point as it looks as though it is badly rusted?

Thanks for any help.

Carl
