I refueled at Tehachapi and worked out the fuel consumption

figures.  This too is part of proper engine management.  If you

see your mileage beginning to dwindle it's pretty good evidence

your engine needs attention.  But I didn't believe the numbers. 

They said I'd gotten near forty miles to the gallon out of the

last batch of fuel. --

i absolutely agree with this.  When i had Gus, a 59 panel converted to
riviera camper converted to 70's naugahyde custom, i had no gas gauge and
kept detailed records of fueling up so i wouldnt run out.  My average MPG was
~31, which i think largely reflected the gearing and type of driving i did.
  I once got 40 mpg,  while driving UP the Sierras.  i never could figure
that one out.    Then one day i suddenly got a measely 16mpg,  striking a
chord of terror through my heart.  When i got home i did a compression check
and found 65 in #3 (surprise! well, it had always been weak), the rest
110-120.   

Funny thing was that performance had not changed, and neither had the sound
of the motor.  All he needed was rebuilt heads, new rings, and i threw in rod
bearings for good luck.  :)

ps, it has already rained 17inches this year here in Oly, WA.  but not all at
once!     Sounds like a looney trip!
