Subject: Mexican buses

Hello all
        Saw a message concerning mexican buses and could not resist.  I
have driven these vans for several summer's now starting in 1990.  They are
great, tough, and reliable.  The engine is essentially a rabbit with a
radiator up front.  Price, last time I checked is about 11,000 new, though
you could get a used one pretty easy.  I have some lit. for these somewhere
in this office.  You can also rent them from Kombi rent in Mexico city.
They will come and fix it if you break down, no matter where.  Great
adventure vacation -- just be forewarned, you have to drive it in and out
of Mexico city.
