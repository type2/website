Subject: My `72 standard lives!!!!

Finally got some time to do some work on one of my projects today:
`72 standard bus, (1700 type4 motor?)
Weber progressive 2bbl.
Hasn't been started in at least a year.
Well, I drained the tank, put a new filter on, cranked her over a buncha
times (without the coil wire hooked up), hooked the coil wire up, put gas 
down the carb, really expecting not much to happen, then VROOM! a couple
of cranks later. Sounded bad, but not too much so, adjusted the timing, it
sounds a bit better. Started running smoother. Kewl! :) I think that I got
to this one in time! At least, no expensive noises from the motor yet! It
probably needs a new alternator/regulator, since it doesn't charge, but I
still have to go over the hacked up wiring before I start actually spending
money. Total investment thus far: 200.00(bus)+1.25 (filter)+2.00 (gas). Now
I'm going to drive her about 4 miles to my apartment to check out the brakes,
then it's 75 miles to where I can really do some work. There's quite a bit
of surface rust, but no serious rot. Again, I think I lucked out this time.

Adventurewagen 
3 of which are running good. I'll probably need some help with the `74
fuel injection system/wiring. Yet another hack job.
