&gt; I think I'm gonna install a smoke detector, too!
&gt;     
&gt;     Please, please pass on any comments you may have about my ideas.

Does anyone else have a smoke detector in their vehicle?  My Westy came
with a factory installed smoke detector over top of the rear bed.  Makes
reference to it in the manual as well.  Since Blaine and I have the same
model year I assume it is because mine is a Canadian market vehicle.
