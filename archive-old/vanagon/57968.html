John:  I did a cross-country trip last summer with my kids 
(8600miles in 30 days).  I had to use gasahol only once and got lousy 
mileage (14.5 mpg).  Didn't notice any loss in power, as I was 
cruseing the interstates.  I usually try to burn high octane to get 
the most out of the waterboxer.  Out in the midwest and Rockies, 91 
octane was the highest encountered.  Also, as a sideline, keep it 
under 70mph.  I blew my trans cooler in Yellowstone and was siphoning 
goo from the coolant and refilling trans fluid at every fill-up.

&gt; I'm curious.  My upstate NY 1991 Vanagon is going to be spending lots of
&gt; time on the road this summer, especially in California and other parts
&gt; west.  Do any of you who drive Vanagons in areas where only reformulated
&gt; gasoline is sold have any problems?  Or is this something I shouldn't worry
&gt; about.
