&lt;&lt;                       POOH GOES APESHIT
                                 By A.A. Milne
 
 
 Everything was rather quiet in the hundred acre wood. The trees whispered to
 each other as the wind rustled their leaves. Under a large oak tree, there
 lived Pooh bear.   From inside Pooh's house, there came a steady
bang...bang...
 bang!, that was making his honey jars rattle on the sideboard. The light
came
 through the window, and in the evening sun Pooh raised the axe once more and
 brought it down on the tattered remains of Christopher Robin.
&quot;Why...won't... &gt;&gt;


Ahhh....  Innocent childhood memories shot to hell....  :&lt;)
