Subject: Re: optimal warmup time?

Martha said:
&gt;I think we started this thread once, but I can't remember the
&gt;concensus, due to my alzheimers-senility, or whatever that disease
&gt;was I had.  Anyway, how long should I warm up my car?

I always warm it up until the coolant temp needle touches the white part of
the gauge (if that makes sense). This takes about 5 minutes or so right now
in PA.
But then, I go only 3 blocks to 55mph travel on the interstate.

BTW, &quot;always&quot; is a relative term. What I really do is jump in the van and try
to wait at least a minute before I tear off down the road (&quot;tear off&quot; being
another relative term with VWs).   :)

I do try to do the &quot;always&quot; thing if I'm not late.
