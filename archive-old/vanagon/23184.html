Subject: CV Boots/Bolts Question

hiya friends,

i just got an excellent deal on a 1974 Vw Bus with a rebuilt engine...for $300
from my roomate...excellent shape. i'm psyched, it's my first vw. there are a
few things that need to be done....right now i'm working on the cv boots.

at least one is cracked...and i was going to replace the others since i'd be
doing one anyways. yesterday i got the inner and outter cv joint from the right
rear side off. now i've got a couple of questions.

1) I can get the boots themselves for $9.00 from an auto parts store. or i can
get a 'kit' with the clamps, bolts (tho i don't know why they would give me
bolts), one boot and the grease needed. this doesn't seem like a deal for
$18.95. should i replace the bolts to the cv joint itself if they look okay?
should i go for getting just the boots, using grease i already have, and trying
to use the clamps from the old joint?

2) The right rear joint came off easy. not so on the other side. i've got two
#$%_at_!&amp;! bolts that seem to be frozen. i was straining on one and kind of
stripped the head of one bolt...the head is still there but the ratchet doesn't
fit anymore. then i tried with some vise grips. no give. then i tried
saturating it with WD40. no give. any suggestions? i'm guessing if i can't get
it off, i'm going to have to put all the other bolts back on take the van to
a shop or something.

is there any other way to clean up the ball barings and the cv joint itself
without using gasoline? i don't have a great way of disposing gasoline...

thanks for putting up with my rambling here....

jonathan
