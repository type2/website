You can find a lot of support and information about Vanagons from the
Vanagon newsletter. Subscribe by sending email to
listserv_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu with this in the body:

     subscribe vanagon nelson hogg

Be prepared for a flood of help. If you don't know about newsletters, you
are copied on EVERY message generated by everyone on the list. This group
is large and sends at least 40 messages PER DAY. I once ignored my email
for a week while on vacation and came back to 250 messaged! Some folks
unsubscribe and subscribe whenever they need help.

But most of the folk are very helpful. Like every group, there are a few
snots (he's a lawyer and owns a Eurovan), but the group just ignores them.

^^^^^^^^^^  Errr,  Ric, you know anything about this? sound familiar?  Arm the 
torpedoes, I think Thom Fitzpatrick could prolly help you fill his inbox for 
the next 3 years or so.  Sic' em.     Tim Smith

PS: we really don't  ignore you Bill, I mean Ric
