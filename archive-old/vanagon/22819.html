Subject: Belated Introduction

Hello All! Sorry, I didn't realize it was porper to introduce yourself
to the list, so here goes: I'm Lisa Quinn, from Novelty, Ohio. (East
of Cleveland OH). I'm a graphic artist. My husband is Bob Muehl, who
is an engineer. He tests big motors that are used on Navy ships. He's
a pretty good mechanic, who has taught me alot. I always wanted to be
able to take care of my car, and so I do. We are the sometimes proud
owner of a 1981 Vanagon L Westphalia Deluxe Camper. It has the stove
and refrigerator in it. It ran well until it's death at 144,441 miles.
And you all know well the saga of our engine replacement, and it's
untimely death at 1,500 miles. I am the previous proud owner of a
'66 Beetle, and a '68 Autostick Beetle. Both were daily drivers, and 
done in by the Cleveland salt in the winter. Oh yes, forgot to say
that the Camper is brown. Thanks again for all your help.
Lisa
