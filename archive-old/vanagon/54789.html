&gt; For those of you with Eurovans in the US, what kind of fuel

Usually less than 20 MPG mostly pseudo-city driving (DC commutes suck)
Haven't been keeping it exactly just a general feel to see if it changes 
much.  Disappointing but it is a darned big box.

Automatic - got what was available not what I wanted...

Cruise range under 400.  Usually fill up at around 300 miles...

Power?  Well as a hot foot I can run up to 80 MPH with little effort and 
not an overly long time.  Just spent a week driving a rental Chevy 
Suburban and it had more pound on the gas accelleration but not enough to 
be worth the cost and even thirstier V8.  As I've said before it isn;t 
quite as quick accelerating as my Chevy S-10 with a V6 but the S-10 gives 
out at the high end sooner.  I'm very happy with the power.
