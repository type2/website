Subject: Re: What would you do?

Thanks, Rusty, I needed a gut-wrenching laugh about now...and the winner
is: Option # 3. I don't think my friend's Mercedes (old and well-seasoned)
motor is strong enough to push the bus. 8) ...and the bus motor seems
pretty strong right now, so why screw with it anymore...I'm already
married anyway...and any chicks attracted to my bus in Arkansas are liable
to be missing their front teeth and married to their first cousin, which,
I think probably puts them at the Ford rally anyway. 8) Thanks! Joe

BTW, I did the dipstick temperature test a couple days ago...ran her a 
ways before-hand: 225 F; then, after I got the idle sortof working, I ran 
her about 10 miles and did it again: 210 F. I don't recall the thread on 
temps, but these don't sound too ominous to me. Do they to you?

&gt; Hey Joe!,
&gt; 
&gt; As Rusty sees it, you have three choices:
&gt; 
&gt; 1. Drive the hour to the show and buy a new motor to get home.
&gt; 
&gt; 2. Use your friend and throw him away like a used Kleenex. B.S. him into
&gt; pulling the motor outta his vehicle and stuff it into your vehicle and go to
&gt; the show. Have a good time and use his money. Make vieled threats that he'll
&gt; never get his motor back and act real sly and smooth all day long. Make
&gt; every thing look like his fault. Act like a (real subtle) pain in the butt
&gt; all day long. Say nothing on the way home and blame everything on him. Act
&gt; really tired by the time you get home. Promise to get together with him REAL
&gt; SOON to switch the engines and stuff. ;) Then when he calls to do the
&gt; switching, act all pissy and say that it's his fault that you're no longer
&gt; friends. He embarrased you in public and you wouldn't dream of giving the
&gt; motor back. Tell him that neither of you have any money and no lawyer would
&gt; ever do anything for him anyhow. What did he expect? Duh!
&gt; 
&gt; 3. Take your friends' vehicle and chill out realizing that you'd have a good
&gt; time anyhow. You could be at home taking crap from (depending on your age)
&gt; either your Dad (age 13-18) or your soon to be ex-spouse (age 35-55). Same
&gt; perception really... Just tell everyone at the show that the bitchen 23 in
&gt; the corner (over there by the trophies) is actually yours. Forget about it.
&gt; It's ONLY a 71 campmobile anyhow. Like, you'll miss all the chick action if
&gt; you take your buddies ride!? Buy your pal a beer while you're there. Come
&gt; home, and check real carefully for a cracked case near the oil cooler seal
&gt; galleys. Save your bucks immediately for at least a top end rebuild. Treat
&gt; your pal right. Suck up good as he is the guy that's gonna drive your sorry
&gt; butt all the way to Amahiem/Orange to buy all the parts. Be cool or he might
&gt; dump you in Compton about sundown. ;(
&gt; 
&gt; Option one gets you to the show, maybe and might burn up your illin' motor.
&gt; Option two accomplishes several things. A) gets you a motor B)provides
&gt; transportation for the show C)provides a bizarre response for the list to
&gt; spark endless discussion D) probably gets you butt kicked. E)Offs a friend
&gt; that probably woulda helped rebuild the motor. Option three is reality. 
&gt; 
&gt; Your mechanical pal,

&gt; 
&gt; ...............................................................................
&gt; &gt;Symptoms:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Compression check reveals #1=111, #2=109, #3=112, #4=75 dry/73 wet. 8(
&gt; &gt;Oil use/spew is running somewhere around 1 quart per hour of 
&gt; &gt;operation...looks like it might be the oil cooler leaking per Bentley's 
&gt; &gt;suggestion to look at the amount on the left side of the engine.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Question:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Would you drive the hour to the Eureka VW show? I guess I could ask my 
&gt; &gt;friend to drive his car, but we've really got pumped up for this trip in 
&gt; &gt;the bus 8| 
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Anyway, I know what I SHOULD do; I just don't know what I WILL do.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Thanks!
&gt; &gt;
