In defense of my state:

Joel's list only lists 6 people in PA.  Yet, I think we definitely
have more bricks around here.  I guess they just do not have access to e-mail.
I would suggest that we could ask the dealers and VW mechanics to put signs
up related to the tour once we know the details......


....what, me, adolescent? (or was it what, me worry??) Noooo.....
