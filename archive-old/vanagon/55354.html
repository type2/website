Subject: Aux. Battery Relay PIN #

 Can anybody come up with the PIN # for the relay that is used with the aux.
battery hookup. I've been having a problem with my main battery going dead
after long periods of the van just sitting. I think the relay is supposed to
open when the motor is shut down. The relay is located under the drivers
seat in the spare batttery box.
