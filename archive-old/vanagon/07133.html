Subject: 69 Questions

I just added a 69 Bus to my stable.  It has a few areas that need attention,
so naturally I turn to the vanagon list for advice.

The metal sunroof sags at the back, when shut.  Is this adjustable?

I got a good deal on this bus, mainly because it would not run.  The owner
did not know why it wouldn't run, but that when he parked it a month or so
ago it was running.  I discovered that it had water in the gas tank.  The
carb was crudded up and I replaced it and was able to get it running.  I
don't know how much rust the gas tank has due to the water.  Would it be
best to remove it and clean it and seal it?

I am moving the front hung spare back to it's original location.  What size
VW emblem does the 69 take, since this one is missing.

I removed some built-in cabinets and want to add at least one bench seat.
Does anyone have one for sale?

Thanks In Advance,
Richard Kurtz
