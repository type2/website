Subject: Re: 79 Bus -- running at last!!!

&gt;To me, all this pricing and stuff is *insignificant*.
&gt;How the hell does the bus run?  Well, I hope.
&gt;For my 79 bus, total monies invested so far(including orig buying price)
&gt;total $3000.  This is for a bus with over 200,000 miles on the original
&gt;engine/tranny.  
&gt;To me, you got one hell of a deal!!!
&gt;I sure hope it runs well, and lasts a long time.
&gt;I seriously want to know how it runs, and did the mechanic return
&gt;all of the FI stuff?  I hope so.
&gt;Congrats, you got a sweet bus on your hands.
&gt;Good luck, 
&gt;Paul

Well, I feel better now.  It's runs pretty decent, actually (I've only had
it a few hours, and just went home with it and spent an hour crawling all
around inside with Windex and towels spiffing everything up -- hasn't been
washed in a year I bet.)  The garage wants me to come back after 500 miles
or so to flush (?) the fuel tank, some gunk in it I guess.  The gasoline
that was in it at first wouln't even BURN, it was sitting for so long.  The
tires aren't that great -- a couple of slow leaks I need to have checked.

I may have messed up the emergency brake -- drove it for a while and forgot
to release it.  Then again, if it was working properly it should have killed
the engine in 1st gear, yes?  It still seems to work though.
