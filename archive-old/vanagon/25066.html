Subject: Sorry if old mail/Corvairs &amp; VWs

**Sorry if this is a repost but I have been having server probs on my side
of the line today. This msg popped up as &quot;undeliverable for five days&quot; etc.
when sent to a particular list member. It was sent last week...


Rusty promised to find the Foreign Car Digest magazine that detailed the
installation of a corvair motor into a VW Bus. Well... I failed to find that
article but did find an article detailing the &quot;upgrade&quot; of a 1200cc VW
engine to 1662cc via the use of Corvair cylinders and pistons. A total void
of technical data exists in this &quot;fine&quot; magazine. It was mentioned that
upgrading to a VW 1500 cost $25.000 vs $15.000 for the Corvair parts. Why
they included a third zero to the right of the decimal but omited the piston
and cyl size specs is beyond me! 

1662 CC VW by Rob Kranz Foreign Car Guide July 1965
I only have time for a snippet (sorry) -rvb

&quot;The list price of a VW cylinder, piston, rings and wrist pin assembly for
the 1500 is approximately $25.000 compared to $15.000 for the comparable
Corvair parts. The installation of either requires that both the crankcase
and cylinder head spigot diameter be enlarged. Finally, 1500 pistons require
1500 rods while the 1200 rods could be used with Corvair pistons. Hence a
40% displacement increase was available at considerably less cost than the
25% increase with standard VW components.&quot;

I am not touting this article or the procedure but thought it was
interesting to see the lack of precision machining techniques and total
&quot;Backyard Barney Bumble&quot; level of sophistication. 

BTW:
Arizona Republic newspaper 9/8/95
1963 Corvair $300.00 obo
1963 Corvair Spyder $2,200.00 runs
