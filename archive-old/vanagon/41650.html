Subject: re: Bay Area drive-in night!

&lt;fontfamily&gt;&lt;param&gt;Monaco&lt;/param&gt;&gt;&gt; went to the last remaining drive-in
theater in town to see the double 

&gt;&gt; feature James and the Giant Peach and Mr. Holland's Opus.


&gt;  This reminds me... When are we going to have a Bay Area drive-in

&gt;  movie night?  I have this great idea for a poster, as well as a

&gt;  large-format camera....


&lt;/fontfamily&gt;Ron,


Sounds great, no babysitter needed for the kids just bring 'em along.
Where would you suggest? That one off of 880 in Hayward? I think it's
got 6 screens, so it shouldn't be too hard finding a movie that
everyone likes. 


My guess is that with all the construction that's going on around it,
it won't be long before it's torn down. Count me in!

&lt;fontfamily&gt;&lt;param&gt;Monaco&lt;/param&gt;I accidentally installed the deer
whistles on my VW backwards. Now everywhere I go, I'm chased by a herd
of deer.&lt;/fontfamily&gt;
