Ok, back in the MIG saddle again!

I welded in the piece that forms part of the rear wheel opening behind the 
cargo doors, and fabricated a piece to fit to replace the rusty channel in
then front part, between the front wheel arch and the cargo door piece.
Just one more small piece to fabricate and weld in on the driver's side,
and the rocker project  will be done!

Drove the bus again, and man is it nice to be driving a &quot;new&quot; bus!  Its
a lot quieter now with the new tranny!  Once I get the brakes bled and
the back ones adjusted, I'll drive it to work!
