Subject: exhaust brackets from the past

Yesterday I replaced my front exhaust pipe (the manifold, if you will).  I
also took advantage of the moment and changed the tranny fluid after
removing the holy pipe -- put in synthetic -- Wow does it shift nice!
Anyway, after changing the fluid, I put gasket compound on all the
surfaces and let them sit for a while and got into position (this is lying
on the back carport work here) to install the pipe.  I set the left flange
on the studs and positioned the bottom flange at its position and looked
up at the toughest one (the right flange is bolted -- not studs and I'd
already started to strip it out during my trip to Utah -- was leaking like
a sieve -- I cleaned out the threads with a tap and was going to go with
it) and it was 15 millimeters out from the surface!  It didn't mate.  I
tried forcing it, but I didn't have enough leverage and I knew that I was
going to have trouble getting those bolts in anyway -- there was no way I
was going to do it under pressure.  So I removed the nuts and bolts
holding the bottom pipe to the rear header and the one brace so things
were a lot looser and guess what happened?  The braces fell onto the
floor.  The other end was not attached.  One of them had the little tab
from the block attached to it.  Now I know what that rattling was back
there. I proceeded to tighten up all the bolts and nuts that attached to
the head.  Of course, now the bottom pipe didn't line up at all.  This I
forced with a C-clamp and got it tightened up. 

My guess on all of this is that the braces, having broken, caused all of 
the exhaust pieces to sag and bend, so things weren't to factory spec.  
The problem is that now I have no braces on this thing and I don't know 
what I should do.  There's no tab left to attach one to.  Should I leave 
them off and wing it, or should I try to find something else to attach 
them too and risk breaking that too?  Also, now my exhaust system is 
&quot;sprung&quot;. Is this going to cause it to start leaking right away? (It 
doesn't now) Or am I going to have an experience like Tim's when I head 
for the windy city at the end of April? :-)

&gt;Subject: Re: 87 vanagon exaust ??

A sadly familiar scene, except than large chunks of my exhaust removed 
thhemselves on a 900 mile trip at Xmas time!  The culprit in this appeared
to be one of those seven (7!) support struts that tie the heavy muffler bits 
to the engine. The strut had craccked through near the pipes, not very 
visible on a casual inspection. The ensuing vibration fatigue-cracked the 
pipes near the flanges on the heads and where the pipes siamese together. It 
looks like our high salt content winters in Canada speed this up over 
southern climes.
