&gt;If you see any car driving without their lights on (at night) DO NOT blink
&gt;your lights at them. Even though you might be thinking that you are doing a
&gt;good deed in desire for saftey, you are, in fact, placing yourself in danger.
&gt;
&gt;There is at least a 50% chance possibility that you may find yourself the
&gt;target of a gang initiation. It seems that some gangs initiate new
&gt;&quot;shooters&quot; by trolling in traffic with their headlights intentionally left
&gt;off. Their goal is to wait until some well intentioned citizen blinks their
&gt;lights at them intending to add to the saftey factor. The good samaritian
&gt;ends up in the crosshairs of the newbie shooter. 
&gt;
&gt;I tend to think that I have a fairly decent &quot;sidewalk diploma&quot; in street
&gt;smarts but this was a new one on me. If I can help keep you and your family
&gt;NOS then all the better.

Ellis,

I hate to shoot you down, but this is a fairly old urban legend.  It has
the U.L. signature of playing on fairly valid fears people have (drive-by
shootings.)
