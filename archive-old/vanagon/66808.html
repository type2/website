&gt;Subject: Newbie ISO Eurovan opinion
&gt;
&gt;Hello all,
&gt;Currrently, my wife and I are almost ready to purchase a Eurovan from a
&gt;local dealership in Ann Arbor Michigan.  Here is the description:
&gt;
&gt;1993 (of course) Eurovan MV 5 speed
&gt;17,800 miles
&gt;Loaded, $12,500
&gt;One owner, van is painted to match the Mobile home it was dollied behind
&gt;
&gt;I would like to get anyone's personal opinion or experience with the
&gt;Eurovan.

It sounds to me as though this is a good deal!  If I could have found
something like that here in Boulder in March when I was looking, I would
gladly have bought that instead of a new 1997 EV, which I bought for
$32,000 plus local tax.
