Subject: Fridge - Rapid Fire It &amp; Brass PLug

Louise:

The &quot;electric&quot; pilot light is key to me -it is
above the unit and has a little toggle
switch turning it and an indicators for
water levels and maybe battlery power?

A first start sucks but after it is gooing
you can shut her down for gas fill ups and
re-start in no time.

I keep my unit on high and it runs A-1 on
the highway.


To start the propane you need patience
(period) plus this advice and that little
green pilot light. Forget that hole inside
the fridge -I think it is a joke played on
both of us.

First turn on metalic toggle switch with
indicater lights for stove/water (above
unit and below sink) and remove fridge
door.

1-park the van where you can not be seen
- this process attracts attention.

2 -get a milk carton or little stood and sit
on it in front of unit- or put a towel on
floor and knee (use towel for crying into if
need be)

3. turn 3 way switch to propane

4. turn fridge to max

5 pump that little shit anout 50 times but
do not depress pump full distance this
fires spark.

6 press that thumb button for 10 secs

7 pull pump1/4 out and full in to fire
spark as fast as you can - may be 20
times or until hands gets sore.

8 watch that electric indicater light above
unit


9 when light goes on start pumping full
strokes - (but not in to fire) and keep
thumb on that button untill green
electric pilot light get very bright

10 if you get no &quot;electic&quot; light going on
stop and go to  step &quot;5.&quot;

11 if after 5 mimutes or hands get sore
-turn your attention to other matter for 5
minutes and start again



BRASS PLUG
There is a brass plug in my &quot;Domestic&quot;
fridge that has a little chain on it. I
understood from the manual that it is
used to drain water from the unit in case
some gets in the vent.
