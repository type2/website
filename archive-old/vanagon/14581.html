So Dave Kautz says:
&gt; 
&gt;   I'll be happy to forget that wagon ever existed, as soon as the '74 is back
&gt;   on the road. BTW, I spent over a hundred bucks &lt;!&gt; on gasoline to get that
&gt;   thirsty POS wagon to Red Rock and back.

Wow! And I thought I was hurting from the gas bill.  Whew!

Next time, take plane Dave.  ;)
