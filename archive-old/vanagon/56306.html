As an avid cyclist, there is a big debate over low cost mail order vs 
mom and pop bike shops.  I see a similar problem with Ron's business.  
Sure, I use mail order sometimes, but an issue that needs to be 
explored is the argument that you are not supporting business in your 
community and the fact that when you order via the phone, you don't 
have the luxury of going back to the store when the part is wrong or 
doesn't work. Nice way to ruin a weekend when you expected to do your 
repair and realize you can't due to a wrong or broken part.  I have 
found a FLAPS that gives me reasonable prices.  That's all I expect.  I 
don't have alot of money, so I don't want to be gouged, but I will 
support a shop that sets fair prices.  This is not a chain store, it is 
a locally family owned business.  There are reasons most wholesalers 
don't sell to businesses that don't have retail space-LOW OVERHEAD, 
thus the ability to undercut legitamate business. I guess this is just 
the general direction the world is going in, saving a few bucks no 
matter what the global (or community) cost. Ask yourself this-When you 
buy your parts from Ron, and do your repair, where are you going to go 
when you realize you need another part, or if you break something else 
while doing the repair?  Get on the phone and wait another day or two 
for parts he may or may not have?  Just my opinion.
