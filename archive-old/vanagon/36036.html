&gt;ked and slithered in the background for long enough, at long last,
&gt;I write.  My girlfriend Whitney and I have just purchased our first VW, an
&gt;‘88 Westy with 98,000 miles (great condition) with the intention of driving
&gt;it from San Francisco through Mexico at least as far as Guatemala.  We’re
&gt;heading south in about a week and plan on traveling for about six months or
&gt;so.  What we’d really like to do is drive it to Panama, then put it on a
boat
&gt;to Alaska and drive it back from there, or to Florida and drive home
&gt;cross-country.
&gt;
&gt;I’ve traveled a bit, but not with a vehicle, and I’ve never owned or worked
&gt;on a VW.  As a result, I’m quite confident when I say that I have no idea
&gt;what we’re getting into.  We’ve had the van thoroughly
&gt;inspected/tuned/prepped at Gandalf’s Garage in South San Francisco (and
&gt;they’ve been really great) and it seems to be pretty road worthy, but I’ve
&gt;got some questions about a long road trip like this in Mexico.
&gt;
&gt;1.  What kind of tools should I bring?  I’m mechanically inclined, but
pretty
&gt;much clueless about working on the van.  I’m thinking about getting a good
&gt;harness and length of rope so I can strap myself like a sled dog to the
front
&gt;bumper and tow it to a garage when I need to.  Don’t tell me to bring a
&gt;super-twisto-double-spanner-wizzlethorp because I wouldn’t know what to do
&gt;with it.
&gt;
&gt;2.  What kind of spare parts should I bring?  Someone said the tires are
hard
&gt;to get in that size if they need replacing.  Should I have both a good spare
&gt;and an extra (6th) tire, or is that overkill?
&gt;
&gt;3.  I’ve been told that the catalytic converter can plug up and cause
&gt;problems with Mexican gas.  I’ve gotten a converter that is just a tube with
&gt;no insides that I could put on after we’re over the border, then switch it
&gt;back before we come back to California.  Is that either necessary or a bad
&gt;idea for any reason?
&gt;
&gt;4.  I’ve read various comments about over-heating brakes.  This weekend on
&gt;the way back from Yosemite, going down Old Priest Grade (Old Mill Grade??)
on
&gt;Highway 120 (it’s a VERY steep section) the brakes faded and the front
brakes
&gt;got so hot there was smoke pouring from them before I realized what was
&gt;happening.  Is that normal for this car or do I have a problem?
&gt;
&gt;5.  What have I forgotten to ask??  I know about sulfate-free coolant; I can
&gt;only assume that’s available in Mexico.  Anything special about oil?
&gt; Anything else?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks in advance for anyone’s helpful comments.  I’m on digest, so if you
&gt;could also mail comments to me directly I’d really appreciate it. 
&gt;
&gt;An additional note:  when the list gets split as it inevitably will (quit
&gt;fighting it, you whiners, it's just a matter of time), please sign me up for
&gt;the white-’88-Westy/Northern-California/not-really-a-mechanic version.
&gt; That’s not too much to ask, is it?  (Did anyone get apoplectic before they
&gt;got it?  Passions do tend to run high in this group.)
&gt;
&gt;And another note:  we’re taking an old ‘386 portable computer with us and
&gt;using AOL’s Mexico service to send and receive e-mail on the road.  We’re
&gt;planning to have a web site that our friend will be posting our e-mailed
&gt;newsletters to.  I’ll let you know the address of it when I know it.

Inresponse to all of the above, I offer the following tidbits:

You don't say whether your van is an auto, manual, or syncro.  The trans'
should be serviced.  The most common cause of auto trans failure is the final
drive running low on gear oil and then self destructing.  I do recomend
synthetic oils for the engine and transmisions.  I would also have the CV
joints insected and packed with fresh grease. Get the gfrease from the dealer
or use AMSOIL synthetic Moly Heavy duty grease.  The wheel bearings should
also be greased. The rears can be greased by removing the wheel hub and using
a needle inserted between the rollers, fill the cavity with fresh grease. 

For the engine, I recomend 20-50 for the service you will be putting it
through.  See owners manual.  I use Mobil-1 15-50 all year and have had very
good results.  My wifes Rabbit has almost 240K on the original engine.  I
would consider adding an oil temparature gauge.  This will tell you when to
back off the throttle when going up hills or traveling at high speed.  The
water cooling is ideal in this vehicle,  Oil temps however can push 280 or
better.  This will destroy seals.  I use an oil cooler on my Vanagons.  Also,
oil level is extremely important.  Never, never, never, overfill.  Keep oil
between the lines for best lubrication.  Check with engine warm, van level,
and let oil return to pan before checking,(about 5 minutes).  1extra cup
raises oil temp by 20 or 30 degrees, even with large auxillary cooler.  Do
not be tempted that more is better.  Drain excess if you make a mistake.
I wouls also change the power steering fluid.  Have the system flushed to
remove al the old junk.

Change the brake fluid also.  Speaking of brakes, the pads and shoes from the
dealer work best for stopping ability and fade resistance.  The factory rears
are mettalic. I have not found an after market source that does it right.  My
camper has 126K with the original shoes.  I will replace with same.  My
fronts were repalced at 87 with aftermarket &quot;silver supremes&quot;. Van does not
stop well and rotors are now warped.  Didn't save much money either.

How old is water pump?  Expect 60K or so to be replacement territiry.  Keep
spare.  Primary coolant bottle is another failure ite, (the one with the
pressure cap).  If yellow, replace.  How about alternator?  Remove regulator
and check brushes.  Replae if brushes are worn.  Also check bearings.  They
have a nasty habit of failing.  If they go, you are stuck as this belt also
drives the water pump.  If alternator is original, replace bearings and
regulator/ brush assembly before trip. 

As for tires, if replacing before trip, consider a size that is readily
available.  Actually consider brand.  If national brand, they can shipp
anywhere you need them.  Goodyear or sears maybe good choices.  Consider
215-70/14 with standard load ratings.  The extra size will hold the wieght
with no problem,(1554lbs each), and provide better ride and handling. During
travel to Alaska, you will travel many unpaved roads.  I did it in 93. You
need a tire with strong sidwalls to resist the rocks.  I used Bridgestone
HP-41 potenza's.  They worked great, no flats in 12,000 miles.  Unforunately,
they are no longer available. Turanza is new replacement in that size.  Great
tire except not as good in snow.  Goodyear GSA or Pirelli APT-400 should be
excelent tires for this trip.

As far as oyur CAT question, I do not know what gas is available.  If you
eliminate the CAT, you still need the O2 sensor.  It will also be destroyed
by leaded fuel.  Bring a spare.  Unleaded fuel should be available in Mexico.

For spare parts, consider water pump, fuel pump. ignition wires,(or at least
the spark plug connectors, they tend to short out, especially if they are
aftermarket),  Oil and oil filters. Air filter due to the dust, and belts.
 Some pieces of hose and clamps for the cooling system may be a god idea
also.

I hope this answered some of your questions.
Good Luck, and keep on Busin'
