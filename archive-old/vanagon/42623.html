Subject: Re: Odometer rerpair, 1980 (was 1985)

Steve M. asks about a trip odo that doesn't work while the main odo does.
The Vgon speedometer is not all that hard to mess with, since it's not
built into a tin can like some.  The trip odo has a lever arrangement that
takes it out of mesh with the main one while the trip odo gets reset.  I
would say take a look, you might get lucky and find something fixable.  You
could perhaps get the trip odo digits to match the main, even if you 
couldn't get the reset mechanism going again.
