Subject: Need '81 stove/fridge parts
Date: Mon, 6 Mar 1995 19:14:28 -0600 (CST)

&gt; 
&gt; What I need is a new gas valve for one of the burners. It is permanently 
&gt; locked, even when pushed in.
&gt; Also, any ideas on overriding that ceramic fuse setup for the 12 volt 
&gt; fridge? Mine burnt out.Not the fuse,the whole fuse outlet just scorched. 
&gt; Right now I have the whole sink/stove/fridge out to access the body panel 
&gt; for some minor rust work in the body seam.
&gt; Any Ideas? I never had any of this stuff ripped out before although I do 
&gt; have the factory manual.
