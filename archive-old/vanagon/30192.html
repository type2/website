wuecona.wustl_dot_edu has been down since Sunday and I haven't been able to
access my e-mail since then. Should anyone have tried to reach me, please
remail your message to my other account: samid_at_wuecon.wustl_dot_edu. Thanks!

On the '75 bus front: took the old exhaust system to a welder, who plugged
a few holes and reattached the air-preheater. The welder wasn't very
smart, though, and it took way too much energy to tell him how to do
obvious things right, so I took the heater boxes somewhere else (you may
recall my sloppy patch-up job with aluminum foil tape: well, it didn't
last...).

Also got a pint of POR-20 heat resistant paint (1400F) to treat the entire
exhaust system. The name of the paint may be misleading, however: unlike
the POR-15, this paint is NOT to be painted over rust :(
