Subject: info

I'd be most grateful if you could provide me with some information about
your services.  A friend turned me on to your address and lord knows I've
got 1,000 questions.  I'm having an '86 jetta engine put into my '84 westy
can you give me any idea of what to expect.  Did I get screwed and make a
bad choice?  Any others out there with that combo?

thanks
jabali
