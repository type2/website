Yup on both counts.  I went to Sears and got a giant socket that fit
that big nut stamped into th end of the EV oil filter.  That, plus an
appropriate extension, makes all the difference in the world as far
as getting the little (big) guy out goes.

Me, I buy the genuine articles from VW, and pay about $11 for 'em.
I replace the filter at every oil change.  Gives me a chance to feel
like a big shot.

And I shoot for changing the oil every 3000 miles, though I confess
that here in the Vermont winter that stretches out just a bit, but
not much.

But my EV hit 77777 this morning, just as the dawn was rising
rosey in the east.  And I'm a happy guy.

Before too long, as sure as Newtonian mechanics, Spring will come,
and I'll get the '74 Super Sun Bug out of hibernation, and drive it on
my 880 mile per month commute.  And the EV will go to work less,
but to the ocean more.  

Let's hear it for the passing of the seasons!
