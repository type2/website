&gt;	1: How can I tell if I need to replace the front (fif) 
&gt;transmission mount?

You can look for obvious cracks in the rubber.  If you are gonna
have the CV's off anyway, its not that much more work to pull the
tranny out (Note:  This does not apply to swingaxles w/reduction
boxes!)

&gt;
&gt;	2: Should I go ahead and do both axles, all 4 CVs, at the same
&gt;time?

YES!  Get it out of the way.  No sense in doing a .5 ass job.

&gt;
&gt;	3: Should I just go ahead and replace the clutch and accelerator
&gt;cables?

If you have the bread, let it flow.

&gt;	4: As long as the engine bay's empty, does anyone have
&gt;recomendations on treating the light surface rust in the void behind
&gt;the gas tank? Or do I think too much? :-)

While I was under my bus doing the tranny, I wire brushed it all up and
sprayed gray Krylon Rust Tough all up above the tranny area.  Looks Spiffy!

&gt;	Between holidays, rain and a cold, I've done nothing for my
&gt;new jewel except clean the windows and take its picture.
&gt;
&gt;	Is there anything else *you'd* do if you had the engine out?

Detail as much of the surrounding area as you can.  This is you big chance.
You might also consider  putting in new motor mounts, the rubber pieces that
go on the bottom of the tranny on the fram horn.
