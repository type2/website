 I am trying to install oil pressure and oil temp gauges on my 1984 1.9L
 Vanagon engine.  I have a couple of questions that I hope someone can
 help me out with:
  &gt;&gt;


I repalce the pressure sender switch between the pushrods with a fitting and
steel brake tubing.  I run the tube in front of the engine and to the top by
the intale manifold.  I then use two hose clamps to mount the VDO sender to
the manifold so vibration does not break the tube.

For the temp sender, I repalce the Oil relief plug with a sending plug
available from VDO.  Ohter option is to drill and tap this plug and mount the
sender in the existing. Use the 18-27 pipe thread fitting for this option.
