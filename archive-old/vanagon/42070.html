&gt;  Hello volks, and the usual to the point. My question is about Vanagon front
&gt; spoilers. Will a spoiler from later Vanagon fit an 82 model? Would major
&gt; modifications need to be made to install the part? Thanks!

Perhaps I'm thinkin' of somthing vastly different than what you're 
calling a spoiler... 
But does your vanagon really have good enough aerodynamics and go fast 
enough to cause lift?
