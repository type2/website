&lt;&lt; Does anyone have experience with putting a 5-cyl. Quantum engine in a 
 Vanagon? ( I knew there was a reason I didn't trade in my Quantum for the

yes. the 5cyl Quantum engine IS the 5cyl Audi engine, and that's what they're
currently using in the brand new Vanagons that are still being made in South
Africa. Listmember Helmut Ziedler (where are you helmut??) put a 5cyl in his
Vanagon....
he has pics and everything on a website, but i forgot the webaddress...
Helmut....oh, Helmut....
care to speak up on this??
