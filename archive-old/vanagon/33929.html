If somebody tried to rip off my VDub symbol off my 59' 
Panel would it destroy my bodywork?  I bought a repro
from Vintage Parts and the fasteners are these little
wing nuts.  I park on campus at the university and am 
getting a little paranoid.  Should I go naked in the 
front?  Questions, questions... 
           -------

put it on!   if they try to steal it they probly bend it, yuck, but dont live
in fear.  those wingnuts'll keep it on.   it might scratch yr bus' nose a
little though
