I saw an ad for a movie this past weekend called &quot;Tie-Died&quot; an ode to
Deadheads. The ad showed a split window bus covered in all kinds of
designs and colors. The movie is playing in only one theater here in Seattle,
so I don't think it has gone national yet.

A side note...I think I've figured out why many bus(transporter) drivers
don't wave back. They need to keep one hand on the steering wheel and one
hand on the stick shift to keep it from poping out! Any attempt to wave
could prove to be fatal!
