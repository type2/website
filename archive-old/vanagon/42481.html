Hi all;
	I just recieved a nice looking set of carbs from Thom.  they are 
stock solex but I can't determine the year.  Problem is that they have 
some electrical stuff on em that my stock '72 does not have.  on my '72 
there are two solenoids and a plate that says solex on it, all of which 
have electrical connections.  that part is the same on these so I won't 
have any problem with that bit of wiring.  However, the left hand carb 
has this silver, rectangular,  thingy for lack of a better term mounted 
to the upper left side of the left hand carb (when viewed from the back 
of the bus) it has an electrical connection on it and I don't know what 
to hook it to.

Not an expert myself, but had a similar carb that worked well. . .   &lt;g&gt;

top left? little shiny rectangle about 2 inches by 0.75 by 0.5 (roughly)? Has
seperate lid pressed from very thin sheet? Lying on it's long side, with 1
electrical connector towards the back of the van?

Could well be the idle start-up enrichment unit (or some similar name). My VW
dealer hadn't heard of it! Should be connected to the + half of the coil or
anything that's live whenever the ignition's on. You can leave it unconnected
&amp; retune the engine - should be ok but might not idle so smooth when cold.
Didn't make much difference when I killed mine.

[Don't be tempted to take it off/apart to see how it works; it's a sealed unit
and is easily destroyed by opening, and they're almost impossible to replace
(in the UK).] &lt;sigh&gt;
