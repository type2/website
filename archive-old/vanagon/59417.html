&gt; The compressor that came with my 84 GL when I bought it three years ago
seized 
&gt; in the first week (always a good sign).  The shop I went to at the time
was 
&gt; unable to get a replacement from another VW, so after I tired of them
running 
&gt; me around I went to a large local salvage yard...
&gt; I think they charged $125 and gave me thirty days to return it if it
died.
&gt; 

Actually, Rebuilt Vanagon A/C compressors don't cost much more than that
anyway ($169, listed as '86-up) and carry a longer warranty than used. 
Only caviat is you have to swap your existing clutch onto it (or buy a new
one).
