My Dream Bus???


Hmmmmmmmmmm.......

I would have to say that I would like to have a TriStar or, rather, a Double cab Syncro
really decked-out similar to a TriStar (because I couldn't bear to recolor a real TriStar).  A
2.1 liter engine with the South African Turbobus turbo system, or an upright V6 motor (it
would fit nicely under the higher deck of the pickup).  It would be Toronado Red with
platinum-colored body cladding, no chrome, dark tinted windows, Sony cassette w/CD
changer, a P.A. system for letting all of the dangerous non-drivers on the road know that
they are, indeed, very stupid, and a keypad operated gunsafe for keeping my Glock 9mm
within easy legal reach,....   I'm getting off track here.

It would have trailer brakes, and a battery extension outlet to power the winch on the car
trailer that I would tow with it to retrieve new project VWs and back them up the hill into
my shop with my wonderful, unstoppable, 4WD rolling shrine to Teutonic Engineering.

I would wash it, and wax it, and squeeze it, and call it Jorge.

Rick Sherrod  (Very depressed now)  kdf_cars_at_mylink_dot_net  Pat Eagan!  You wanna swap?
