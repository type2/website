well ... i USED to have one (1980) AND i like to run my mouth, so i'll
jump in here (as usual). :)  &lt;replying to the list because of previous
totally erroneous replies!&gt;

&gt;- why did VW replace these engines after only three years of production?

ok. first, that engine (the type 4 engine) was not in production for just
three years. it was first introduced in 1969 in the porsche 914. the 1983
air-cooled bus was the last evolved model of that engine. so the production
run was more like 14 years, during which time the displacement grew from
1.7 liter to 2.0 liter, and the valve lifters became hydraulic (no more
setting the valves every 3000 miles) in about 1978. the engine in the 1980-
1983 vanagons is the same engine as in the 1978-1979 buses. fuel injection
is the same as well. actually, the only 'difference' between the 1979 bus
and the 1980 vanagon is the entire body and suspension. :) the engine and
transmission are the same.

now, as to why vw replaced the good old reliable simple and easy to fix
air-cooled engine at all, here's from the Road &amp; Track intro test of the
1983.5 water-cooled vanagon:

&quot;...
Meanwhile, back in Wolfsburg, VW had been having similar problems with its
air-cooled Vanagon powerplant. Displacing almost 2.0 liters, the 4-cylinder
was at the ragged edge of efficiency.  At 67 bhp, the Type 4 (located at the
rear of a large box and subject to less than ideal airflow) was doing all
an aicr-cooled engine could do to propel a 3300-lb vehicle and stay alive.
Something had to be done and that something was water cooling, not just the
cylinder heads, but the cylinders as well.  There were other reasons for
this change, namely, better fuel economy and less noise. This last point
is very important especially in a country such as Switzerland, which has
very strict noise regulations.&quot;

apparently, they buy a LOT of vw buses in Switzerland! :)

&gt;Year and type of Vanagon -
  1980 L model (black bumpers, no air-conditioning, rubber floor mats)
&gt;How many years owned -
  6 (dec 1979 to jun 1986)
&gt;Age of van -
  well ... i bought it new from the dealer for $8500. it's still running
  around town today. so it's 14?
&gt;Age of engine -
  still on it's original engine.
&gt;First engine?
  yep.
&gt;Clutch replaced?
  yep. 80,000 miles.
&gt;Transmission replaced?
  nope. changed the oil several times.
&gt;Daily use?-
  when i had it, yes.
&gt;Mileage -
  when i sold it, 110,000 miles.
&gt;MPG - city/highway -
  average for 110,000: 18.4 mpg;  best ever: 23 mpg; worst:  15 mpg;
  normal city: about 16-17 mpg;  normal highway: about 19-20;
&gt;Replaced Parts - electrical
   headlight switch; ignition coil (twice);
&gt;Replaced Parts - emission
   cat converter was incorrectly tightened at factory, vibrated a hole in
   the pipe part of it. i replaced the cat with a straight piece of pipe.
   plugged the EGR valve on manifold and welded shut the exhaust hole for
   the EGR.
&gt;Replaced Parts - fuel system
   fuel filters every 6000 miles. fuel hoses after 5 years.
&gt;Max speed -
   got it up to 85 mph once. kinda scarey.
&gt;Oil pressure at speed (if known) -
   can't remember. the gauges were metric (from a scirocco)
&gt;Oil pressure at idle -
   can't remember.
&gt;Major body work -
   had the front repainted due to numerous sand and rock chips.
&gt;Major suspension work -
   replaced shocks a couple of times.
&gt;Major items  (body/engine) requiring improvement in your
&gt;estimation
   get halogen headlights. and some fog lights.
   put extra grab handles in strategic places. :)
   carry spare coil.
   add external oil cooler kit (adapted to oil filter via 'sandwich' plate).
   the fold-down rear seat/bed from the 1985-1991 vanagons would be a real
   plus!
   if you don't like that really heavy engine hatch, you could get one from
   a junk yard from a 1984-1991 (they are made of plastic and are much much
   lighter). HOWEVER! i should point out: the water-cooled engine is quieter
   and cooler, and the plastic hatch MIGHT let more noise and heat into the
   car. Might. maybe. Martha did it, but she's not sure (either). i didn't
   do it cause the junk-yard guy wanted $75 for the hatch!
&gt;Any other points you would like to add -
   wish i'd never gotten rid of it. if i had the money, i'd go buy it back. :(
