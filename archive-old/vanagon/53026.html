Subject: Rear Brake Drum Puller

Item Subject: Text_1
     Hi All,
     
       Well, my '85 Westy is making some strange metallic squealing noises 
     out of the rear brakes when they are cold.  I want to check them so I 
     consulted the Bentley Manual for the disassembly procedure.  Bentley 
     shows a special tool that looks like a gear puller to remove the rear 
     drums.  Is there an easy &amp; safe way to remove the rear drums without 
     this tool?  Could you use a standard gear puller (not that I have one 
     of these either but I am more willing to buy this tool)?  Any tips or 
     tricks to pull the rear drums would be apperciated.
     
     TIA
     
     Vince.
