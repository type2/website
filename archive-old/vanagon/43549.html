Subject: Urgent to Derek!!!

Hi Derek:
For a long, long period of time I was posting messages to the list looking
for a center bench seat and the small table in the driver's cabin. Those are
the items that would complete the restoration of my 78 Westy. I will very
happy if can make an arrangement with you to have the bench seat you are
giving away, I'm willing to cover the cost of shipment. Please, reply if
you want to do it.
