Subject: Re: Tire recommendations wanted

Mark asked:
&gt;My &quot;new&quot; '87 Westy syncro came with chewed up tires which I need to replace 
&gt;immediately. Any recommendations? Bad experiences? I'll be doing mostly 
&gt;freeway driving, with some logging roads and a trip up the AlCan in the next 
&gt;few years.

Tires?
I purchased a set of Goodyear Aquatreads this summer (195's) and I can't say
enough about them.  They are a bit pricey, but well worth the investment.
Their stiffer sidewalls allow them to be run at high pressures (42 psi) for
better cornering (something every Westy pilot is looking for) and the
pioneering tread design allow them to grip incredibly well on wet surfaces.
For test purposes, I've driven my 87 Westy at 100 cliks in rain storms
(i.e., I could barely see the road it was coming down so bad) with no loss
of control due to hydo planning. No question the the best tires I've owned.
They also seem to be handling the Westy trademark inside wear fenomina quite
well.

Just a side, the '95 911 Porche Turbo comes with Dunlops that have
conveniently copied the Aquatread....
