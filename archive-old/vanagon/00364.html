Subject: tech sheets on a web server
Date: Sun, 17 Apr 1994 17:29:27 -0700 (PDT)

Hello,
	All these tech sheets are really great.  I was wondering if there
was any archive somewhere for these.  If I remember correctly, we could
make them avail from the listserver or better yet, put them on a web
server.  I think we would probably have the first vanagon home page.  :&gt;
Or, for that matter the first VW home page.  I'm setting up a web server
but it is still in it's infancy so it probably wouldn't be the best place
to put it but I imagine someone on this list knows someone sysadmining a
web server.
