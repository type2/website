&gt;&gt;In the modern era, those C-rats are referred to officially as MRE's, for
&gt;&gt;&quot;Meal, Ready to Eat&quot;.
&gt;&gt;Among the people who actually have to eat them (I had the pleasure more
&gt;&gt;than once in Thule, Greenland), this is called &quot;Three lies for the price
&gt;&gt;of one&quot;.
&gt;
&gt;yeah. and you don't even get the John Wayne Toilet Paper or the John Wayne
&gt;Candy Bar anymore. :)  or the cigarettes you could trade for Fruit Cocktail!

I thought MRE was : Meals Rejected (By) Ethiopians
