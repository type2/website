Subject: Re: My wheel nuts are frozen!!!


&gt;My 86 Westy (85000km) finnaly succumbed to it's very first flat tire (on
&gt;the rear where it gets all the heat). I thought this was going to be a 
&gt;piece of cake to change...however after trying liquid wrench etc. I've 
&gt;only been able to get one out of FIVE lugs undone. I've tried a cross bar 
&gt;wrench etc. and no go. Does anyone have a suggestion...?

	Kroil? :)
