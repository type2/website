Subject: Re: My correspondence with VW C




Harvey Chao (Harvey_Chao_at_smtp.svl.trw_dot_com) sez:

:Following is what I sent VW and their very responsive (customer 
:sensitive) reply.
:The nature of response was not unanticipated - &quot;thank you for your 
:input, but we are doing what we want regardless. . . .&quot;
:----------------
:To: Michelina Lauriola Maenza
:Volkswagen Customer Relations
:
[snip]
:
:We understand your thoughts, but once again like to request you to
:remain in contact with Volkswagen United States, whose address we
:have given you previously.
:
:One reason for this request is that they are responsible for the
:sale of Volkswagen vehicles in the United States - as we already
:mentioned - , the other reason is that we cannot answer your
:inquiries during the following weeks because of our annual factory
:close down for the summer holidays.

I don't supposed Frau[lein] Maenza would be kind enough to supply
a name of an equally responsive (customer sensitive) Customer
Relations person at VWoA???

It would be nice if someone at VWoA -- nevermind...ain't gonna happen.
