I bought an old Coleman catyltic heater.  It is free standing and puts out 
about 3000 BTUs.  I found it at a Flea market for $20.  Apparently they make 
a newer one that runs off of propane bottles.  Mine runs off of Coleman fuel 
(white gas).  They sell these things new at Sears and most sporting good stores.
