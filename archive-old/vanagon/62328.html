Subject: 83 Vanagon For sale

I also have a 83 Vanagon for sale, but mine is two steps away from being
parted out. The engine still runs but has 90K on it since the last
rebuild. The heads dont leak coolant but the number one cyl does leak
oil thru the valve guide when cold and sitting. Large blue cloud when
started after sitting for a few hours. The rest of the van is in good
condition, all glass is good, 7 passanger seating, 4 speed that works.
New fuel pump, water pump, alternator, master &amp; slave clutch cyl, all
within the last year. I'm in the Denver CO area and would prefer to sell
this unit as a whole as I dont have the room or facilites to part it
out. Any reasonable or semi-reasonable offer considered.
