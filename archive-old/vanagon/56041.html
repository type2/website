Listees and Listettes,

Last November, I replaced my rear CV joint using list info and advice.  I
bought my joints from Transform, a CA company.  They were new Lobro joints
and looked fine.  A smooth project, thanks to your help.

Yesterday, the right rear one disintegrated while driving my usual 90 miles
to Whitefish, MT to see my girlfriend and go skiing.  Complete failure of
the joint left me stranded on a very snowy highway with darkness and a
weekend approaching (no auto service on weekends in these parts).  Managed
to get towed to a VW dealership.

important part.....

Dealer said my main problem was that I used hose clamps to attach the boot
to  the shaft.  He seemed to think that the weight of the clamp puts an
imbalance on the shaft increasing wear at high rpm's.    He suggested using
those lockstraps in the future.  BTW, the hose clamps were provided by
Transform when I bought the joints.  

Any comments on this?  Who's right, the dealer or the CV joint company?  

I won't even tell you how much the tow and the &quot;dealer part&quot; cost me. 

Mark
