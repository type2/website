Subject: Re: Vanagon Shocks (KYB's)

This company specializes in parts for muscle cars so
&gt; these shocks are a special order item.  If you decide to order these from
&gt; PST you might have to let the phone help know that yes they can special
&gt; order them,  one of the people I talked to asked if the Vanagon was a
&gt; Chevy.  If you have any problems ask to speak with the manager, Dave ext.


  I can't understand why it would take 3 weeks to get the shocks into 
their shop and then an extra shipping time from them to you or me?

  If I don't have these in stock I can have them the next AM.

  I would also be scared that I'd not get the right part ordering from a 
shop or supplier that didn't deal solely in VW parts.

  Just my feelings on this subject.
