The PO of my brown '80 Westi didn't know that the wet stuff on the 
floor at the drivers feet was brake fluid.  Thought it was water.
They'd only owned it for about 9 years!  Obviously didn't ever check 
brake fluid level either.  Everything in this bus is original, has 
200K on it and not been maintained.  Hmm, is this why they sold it?

&gt;  We had a thread a while ago about several people not knowing about the oil
&gt;  filler extension tube on the Vanagon.  While camping at Yosemite a few
&gt;  weeks ago I met a Westy owner who did not know that the front seats
&gt;  revolve!  Any others out there?
