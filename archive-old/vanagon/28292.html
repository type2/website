&gt;  I am new
&gt;to my area so I asked at the local import Parts store where to get a good
&gt;alignment at a reasonable price. 

I'm over in St. Louis (not TOO far from Carbondale), and I've had great
service from a Firestone dealer.  I'm always charged the same rate as
everyone else, they have great equipment, and they always do a great job.
 They actually like to see me come in, because they can align both the front
and rear, which makes it easier for them (so they say, anyway).

Good luck!
