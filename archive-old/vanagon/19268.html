I have to second the complimentary opinion of AS&amp;S.  If you have a 
question on one of the items the order clerk says &quot;just a minute&quot; and 
you end up talking to the editor/owner? of the wonderful catalog.  If 
a part is cheap junk, he calls it so.  Nice stuff is similarly 
described.  All in all, a cool place.
