Subject: MY BUS LIVES AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!

All-
After sitting 5 weeks in my driveway with a hole in the gas tank, my 79
bus is back on the road.  It all was completed at 2:15 am Sat. morning.

Awhile back, the gas tank developed a small hole in the bottom due to rust.
I wrote to the list, and basically the responses were &quot;You'll have to drop
the engine before you get that tank out.&quot;
Well, NO, you CAN remove the gas tank from a breadloaf without removing
the engine.  Just have to clear off the top of the engine(basically all
the FI stuff).  Then its a straight shot.

So, after being 'busless' for what seemed forever, I'm back on the road
and no more gasoline odor to worry about!

Take Care
Paul
