I am writing you this to inform you of a very important matter currently
under review by the FCC.

Your local telephone company has filed a proposal with the FCC to impose 
per minute charges for your internet service. They contend that your usage 
has or will hinder the operation of the telephone network.

It is my belief that internet usage will diminish if users were
required to pay additional per minute charges.

The FCC has created an email box for your comments, responses must be 
received by February 13, 1997.

Send your comments to isp_at_fcc_dot_gov and tell them what you think.
Every phone company is in on this one, and they are trying to sneak it in
just under the wire for litigation. Let everyone you know here this one.
Get the e-mail address to everyone you can think of. isp_at_fcc_dot_gov

Please forward this email to all your friends on the internet so all our 
voices may be heard!
