&gt;The other bus is a '54 camper. This currently has 1600 'worked' motor
&gt;in it but is not part of the deal. The '54 camper without engine is
&gt;going to be about $300.
&gt;All I have to do now is buy a car carrier so that I can get them
&gt;since they are about 50kms from town.

aha! Thom still reigns! :)  &quot;technically&quot;, Dave hasn't really taken
possession of 'his' buses yet ... a small but legally techical point. ;)
but i'll go ahead and add both of them to the list ... only problem is,
the 54 is gonna have to show up as a 56 (due, of course, to programming
problems). ;)

joel
who's not gonna modify the program until you guys (and gals) get 3 more
older buses. :P
