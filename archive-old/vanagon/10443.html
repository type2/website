Galvin, you conceited git!!!

&gt;The Bushrat can also testify to the handling of my car 
&gt;on ice. We've had a spell of very cold weather here 
&gt;recently - snow, sleet and ice. P.J. was beside me when 
&gt;I drove in to my house yesterday. There's a T-junction 
&gt;just outside my driveway and as I came up to it, I hit 
&gt;the handbrake hard. As realisation dawned, the bushrat 
&gt;shouted &quot;Mind that Audi!!!&quot; (typical of a bushrat even 
&gt;when his life is flashing before him to think only of 
&gt;VAG.

Dam' right.

&gt;The car pirhouetted gracefully on the ice through 180 
&gt;degrees a la Pentii &quot;I like to go sidevays&quot; Airikkala 
&gt;and ended up with it's backside pointed at my drive. I 
&gt;just had to flick it into reverse and I was in the 
&gt;drive.

Show off.

&gt;The bushrat was livid as the last time he tried this 
&gt;trick he ended up in a wall.

Ooooh, I'm gonna *get* you.

&gt;And the moral is - If you want to Ice Skate you need 
&gt;GM.

... and a lobotomy.

Anyway, what does this have to do with Transporters, hmmm?

&gt;&quot;Sure you'd have to&quot;

... if you're crazy enough.  :)
