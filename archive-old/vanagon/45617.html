Subject: FS: '73 Squareback, Long Island.

Bus content: I've got too many, so I must make room in front of my house.
I need to get rid of the Squareback.  I must admit it hasn't been running
well, but I'm sure it's something stupid that I just can't find, like a
loose electrical connection or it might be the fuel pump.  Does anyone
have a used FI fuel pump they don't need?  I can't afford a new one so
it's not the easiest thing to test.  I'm willing to sell the car for a few
hundred dollars as long as it's going to good use.  It has a luggage rack,
air conditioning (!), new clutch, recently rebuilt heads, a couple of new
tires.  If anyone is at all interested please E-mail me.  Like I said I'm
on Long Island (NY) and I may be open to trades too (parts or services,
please no more cars).  If anyone's also on the vintagvw list could you
please forward this?  Thanks.
-Erik.
