To digifant owners:
Whilst under my truck last week changing a coolant sensor I noticed an
ominous &quot;rust bubble&quot; on the elbow of the coolant pipe coming from the
water pump to the Thermostat/coolant distribution housing. My first
instinct was to scrape the offending blemish off and treat the exposed
area. My &quot;higher&quot; reasoning functions stopped me to ponder the source of
this malady and weigh any possible consequences of disturbing it. 
What could be its source? The choices were obvious. Internal or external
(any spiritual undertones are purely coincidental).  I decided that it
was caused by  its location, leading surface in direction of travel. 
Repeated exposure to road debris had worn away any protection and
facilitated the formation of iron oxide. Solution; flick off those
flakes with screw driver in yonder hand! (Insert nasty wrong answer
buzzer sound from Jeopardy). The green liquid flowed like beer on
St.Patty's Day. I have &quot;patched&quot; it with a screw, a rubber washer and
some silicone for now. VW wants $91 for new pipe. The only silver lining
is that maybe I prevented a break down in B.F.Egypt during my annual
camping trip( for me and maybe you too!).
Check It Out!
