Hi all.  I have my motor out for the 900 mile checkup.  Took a total 
of about a half hour, without looking in the book!  I am thinking this
would be an excellent time to change the jetting on my Weber 
Progressive.  It seems to be running a little rich.  The plugs are 
very black on the outside (metal) part.  The ceramic is heading that 
way, kind of brown.  There is black soot inside of the tail pipe.  It 
runs solidly in all gears, no hesitation from a stop, good power at 
high and low rpms, though probably more at the former.  I have heard 
from someone that there are up to six jets in this Weber 32/36 DFEV.  
So, where do I start?  Can I just change the 'main' jet to one size 
smaller?  I don't have a book for this thing so some help in locating 
it on the carburetor would be appreciated.  Thanks, Jim
