No, I don't think you want to open this can of worms! ;-&gt;

My gut reaction?  If, after the breakin period, you want to go to 
synthetic oil, go for it, as long as you still change it every
3000 mi or so. I don't know how the synthetic would affect the
seating of the rings in the pistons, (probably less than putting
Slick 50 in after a rebuild) but I'd just as soon pass.

Mind you, this is from someone who is still stuck in the
SAE 30 vs. 10w-40 trip! ;-&gt;
