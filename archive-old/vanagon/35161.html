Dworkin,

The other thing I forgot to mention is that the Australian Government has 
found that the 4WDs and other chassis based vehicles are more dangerous 
to passengers because they don't have to progressive crumple zones built 
into them. Passengers come to a stop in a collision that much 
(millisecond) quicker, putting more strain on, and sustaining more damage 
from, the restraining devices, ie seatbelts (which the majority of Aussies 
wear). 'Roo bars only exacerbate the problem.

But of course, VWs don't have much of a crumple zone anyway.
