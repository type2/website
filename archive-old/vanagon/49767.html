Subject: saw a '97 EV camper (Winnebago, that is)

Spent the weekend on Block Island (off the coast of Rhode Island).   As
our ferry was leaving, another one was pulling in and I caught a quick
glimpse of a '97 EV Winnebago on board.  Maybe it was a '96 but it had what
the restyled '97 front end.  I didn't think they were around yet.

Lots of Bricks and Vanagons on Block Island.  One is an '82 used as a taxi.  
The best was a perfect white Syncro from Conn. I kept coming across.  I want
it!
