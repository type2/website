Subject: RE: halogen backup lights

..and Fred said:

Does anyone run halogen bulbs in the reverse lights?  Will the sockets neet to 
be 
changed out as well?  Where can the bulbs (and sockets if necessary) be had?

I have had a set of the halogen bulbs in my '71 for a couple of years. Lots of 
light in the right spot a night. I picked them up a a local Pep Boys. They 
just [plug in to the standard socket.
