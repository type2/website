Subject: blow-by to the limit ...

H&gt;Hello vanagonites and Rick,
H&gt;Has anyone here actually gone ahead and ignored the wicked blow-by and
H&gt;kept adding oil to their diesels?  What is the eventual outcome of
H&gt;blow-by?  At what point will the vanagon engine absolutely have to be
H&gt;rebuilt?  You might wonder why I'd ask such questions.  Well I would
H&gt;almost swear that my blow-by pressure actually turns my oil filler cap.
H&gt;Almost, but then again I could always make the same mistake not once, but
H&gt;twice...
H&gt;Thanks,
H&gt;Stuart


I had (past tense here) had a 1600 diesel in one of my Vanagons that was
so sloppy, that you HAD to run a road tube.  The blowby was tantamount
to what one would have seen in a city bus in Mexico City!

The mains pounded like hell.  It still ran!  I finally got tired of
the oil stains on the driveway.

I use a 1500 bypass, run a tube up and over the head to the allow the
blow by to be sucked back into the air intake....

works,


btw, 150 more emails from Kansas today!!!!
