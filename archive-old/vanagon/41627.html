Subject: Q:009/Electronic Ignition, '77 FI Engine

Hey Folks

I'm looking for some advice about the ignition system in my '77 FI
Westy...

In my '60 bug, I have a Bosch 009 distributor, and a Compu-Fire
electronic ignition replacement module instead of points.  I'd
like to do something similar in the Westy, since I do so hate to
play with my points.

Should I get a Bosch 009 or go with the Compu-Fire for the stock
dizzy?  I hear on the list all the time that a Bosch 009 doesn't work
real well with the FI Type IV engine.

	Thanks all

		Jay
