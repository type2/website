Subject: Re: Flooding in Cal[F]

Ya know, when I moved from SoCal to San Jose, that was the first year of 
the drought.  The next 7 years, I had to endure water rationing, dead
lawns, and no local fishing due to dry lakes!  Four months after my
departure from CA, the rains have begun!

I think you all have me to thank (or curse)!!

OTOH, I've probably saved a bundle on wiper blades!
