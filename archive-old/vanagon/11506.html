Subject: Fiberoptic scope for rust inspection...


	Derek Drew writes of geting a fiberoptic scope to inspect
all those interesting cavities where rust might form. 
	On a similar note, I'm tempted to get a squirt bottle and some
&quot;rust converter&quot; stuff (that turns dark blue on contact) and shoot
some at the surface rust I can see in the void around the fuel tank.
before I put the new engine in, but after I do all the 'serious'
prep-work. I figure real conservation can wait for next summer, or
the one after, but if I can see it, I can squirt it, so why not
give it a go?

	I haven't run my degreasing experiments yet but I'll be
testing 
	Simple Green
	Westley's Clear Magic
	Paint Thinner
	Orange Hand Cleaner

side-by-side on the tin and the engine bearer. Rather than generate
a huge pile of icky paper towels OR flush awful, non-biodegradable crap
down the drains, I plan to rinse/scrub over a handy 5 gallon bucket so
I can at least concentrate the guck into a small space.

	My poor brother Ian- he has to put up with all this home science
stuff! Its just the way I am, I guess.

	Cheers!
