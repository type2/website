Subject: ADVICE NEEDED.

Sadly I don't own a single VW.  I am looking at buying one that is in town.
Please advise on:
71 camper top bus, has no propane tank under door like I've seen before.
Has 1 very well siezed motor, 1600 dp rebuilt once, and will need new heads, 
one has a spark plug hole
which has been helicioled and blew out.
Body good, little rust, one ding in door, but small.
Can anyone ID. the vehicle for me- that is whats the type of camper?

With the siezed motor the lady wants $650 for it.
What do Y'all think?
Chris Bridge.
