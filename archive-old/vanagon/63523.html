Subject: RE: 85 westy query

&gt;
negotiations began, she started out asking 12,000, dropped to 10 right
away.
When I suggested 8 she started saying &quot;maybe you don't realy want this va=
n&quot;
so I doubt that she will budge on 10.
My dad doesn't know how much longer he will be able to drive and wonders
about the wisdom of this purchase.  What can I tell him?  Larry Carter

I bought my 85 Westy three years ago with 107,000 miles.  I had to remove=

the sticker from the sink! Everything worked.  I paid $7300 and consider =
it
a good deal at the time.  Maybe she doesn't really want to sell it.   =
