Subject:      disclaimers and alternators

well ... you got me. some of you have multiple busitis, but in order to make
it simple (for me) to keep track of who is or is not on the vanagon list, i
have a 'flag' in the database that says you are on the list. but if i put
the 2nd and 3rd buses of some of you 'on the list', it screws up my count
when i compare to gerry's count.  so the 2nd and 3rd buses don't show up
as 'members' of the list.  as with any program, it can be changed. :)  i'll
work on this.

alternators: alistair asked about why some alternators cut in at lower rpms.
well, that started buzzing around in my head, and so i went and looked it up.
wasn't what i thought at all. t'aint the regulator. tain't the rpms. tain't
the diodes (my choice). it's the pre-excitation current!

from the bosch automotive handbook:

&quot;The pre-excitation current determines the &quot;on-line&quot; speed at which initial
excitation occurs when the engine is started. This speed is well above the
&quot;zero-ampere speed&quot;, with the precise figure being largely determined by the
power of the pre-excitation circuit.  A resistor (about 68 ohms) can be
installed between lamp and ground (but as close to the lamp as possible) to
indicate an interruption in the excitation circuit during operation.
&lt;&lt;note: this is the 'generator' light on the instrument panel they are talking
about&gt;&gt;

The charge indicator lamp should come on when the ignition is switched on
prior to starting (monitoring function) and go out as the engine starts to
run.&quot;

ok, so what the heck is a 'pre-excitation' doololly? well, it turns out that
the alternator (according to the book) needs a magnet to start working, but
until it starts working, it can't produce any current to create an electro-
magnet ... catch-22. so this pre-excitation business is the the use of
battery current to kinda juice things up a bit at the beginning ... just
til the alternator is turning enough to create its own current and sort of
'self-excite' itself. :)  &lt;let's have NO comments from the Peanut Gallery!!&gt;

and, i suppose, different models of alternators use different circuits and
currents, etc. to do this.

this little blurb seemed also interesting, although i'm not quite sure what
it means:

The following speeds are of particular interest:
1. The speed at which current output is 2/3 of maximum current. This is
100 x the speed stamped on the alternator name plate.  By totalling up the
current requirements of the electrical accessories that are normally operated
over extended periods of time (permanent consumers), such as ignition system,
headlamps, tail lamps and instrument panel lamps, the correct current value
for 2/3*Max-current can be determined for a vehicle.  (If present, auxiliary
lamps, wiper motors, car heaters, window defrosters, and radios are also to
be regarded as permanent consumers and their current demand added to this
total. Briefly operated accessories such as horn, turn signals, brake lights,
and cigarette lighter may be disregarded).  However, if the vehicle requires
a good deal of extra power, as in trucks with diesel engines, the battery
Amp-hour capacity often determines the 2/3*Max-current value.

&lt;and some other junk&gt;

anyway, i thought that might be sort of interesting.
