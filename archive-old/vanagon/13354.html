&gt;  For all you electronic types, I am finally replacing my automatic
&gt;transmission on my other bus, a '78, and the heavy red wires running to
&gt;the starter are fried. I want to replace them, but can't tell if they
&gt;are 8 or 10 guage. These are the thick red with white stripes wires
&gt;running from the alternator / battery area to the starter/solenoid area.
&gt;I have some good gas/oil resistant 10 guage wire, can I get away with
&gt;that? Any thoughts/ warnings/ advice are greatly appreciated. If

i would suggest that it's always better to have the BIGGEST wire you can ...
but i think the &quot;proper&quot; gauge is a 10. if you could run an 8, i think it
would be &quot;better&quot;.

while you are at it, might i also suggest :) running a similar sized wire
from the battery NEGATIVE terminal/body-ground strap to the starter mounting
bolt. this will provide a much more direct electrical path for the starter
ground ... and make the starter operate quicker and &quot;better&quot;. i did it on
my 80 bus, and it seemed to help quite a bit. but it is definitely a bitch
to run (on the vanagons), and i've never quite gotten back around to doing it
on my current bus (no puns intended).

also white you are at it: a large wire (maybe 12 guage) from the battery
ground strap to the front of the bus, and there to each headlight ground wire
will give you less voltage drop ... and brighter headlights.
