&gt; 
&gt; Sorry to hear 'bout your &quot;fun&quot; with the DMV, its refreshing to know
&gt; that DMV personnel traits are universal. As I've always said,
&gt; &quot;There are two types of assholes in the world. The intellegent
&gt; assholes become lawyers, and the stupid assholes work for the DMV.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; Speaking as an intellegent asshole ;-)

Ah, I see you've never had to deal with the US Immigration and Naturalization
&quot;Service&quot;.  This is where the people who are too dumb for the DMV end up 
working.
