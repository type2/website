Subject: Re: vanagon antenna plug adapter?

&gt;Also, does VW or anyone else sell plugs that I can hook up to the 
&gt;speaker and power wires of my other radio which will mate with the ones 
&gt;left once I pull out the VW radio?  I can always improvise, but it would 
&gt;be nice to be neat for a change.

&gt;Thanks for the help.

David,
you might check with Crutchfried  for the wiring adaptors.
