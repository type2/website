Subject: Fwd: two questions This about VW Van shipment to Europe

-- [ From:  * EMC.Ver #2.3 ] --

Alex Araujo,

I posed the same question to David Simpson at david_at_Seaview.co_dot_uk. The firm
is a publisher of information about shipping. Seaview has website.  I'm
away from my address book, so I can't provide the address.  Search the WEB.
 

I asked, &quot;Perhaps you can give me an insight on how to ship a VW camper
from the states to Europe for an extended tour.....?We carry US and EC
passports and the vehicle is registered in Texas.&quot;

He replied,&quot; I believe the cheapest method is on QE2, and I suppose an
alternative is on a freight Jumbo. I'll put out a few feelers and contact
you again if I get a response Thanks for visiting Seaview. David Simpson,
Seaveiw communications, Peacocks Wood, Little Gaddesden, Herts, , England.&quot;

I received the foregoing message on Tuesday June 17.  I have yet to contact
Cunard which has a Web site, nor have I responded to Mr. David Simpson to
thank him for his help.  Agree to keep us all posted.  We may be able to
negotiate a group rate.

Re: documents:  needed is either a carnet de passage or la libretta.  Each
is a customs document, obtained by posting a bond, which permits passage of
vehicles through nations with a minimum of hassle. As I understand it,
carnet de passage works in Europe and la libretta works in Central and
South America.  Set hotbot_dot_com to search both terms.  CAA issues carnet de
passage at a horrendous fee/cost.

Keep us posted, please, either to the List, if there is interest, or to me
by e-mail,  I. do the same.

Subject: two questions

I apologize if these issue has already been addressed on this list (I'm a
newcomer).  

1. I saw a picture of a tent attached to a '72 Westy at www.vanagon_dot_com,
and I wondered if this was an original item, and if so, what model years it
came with.  Are they still available, and would they fit a '75?

2. Has anyone shipped their bus to Europe (or other overseas destination)
in order to travel in it, and then bring it back.  I wonder if this would
be cost-effective for a long-term trip (i.e. 6 months or more).  Also, are
there regulations/permits that must be adhered to????

&gt;Subject: 	RE: Canvas awnings?
&gt;
&gt;I had a fire in my '75 Westy two summers ago, and the pop-top canvas had
&gt;to be replaced.  After pricing new (and used) ones, I decided to have
&gt;one made.  A shop here in Toronto that makes boat covers made one for me
&gt;for $500 Cdn (about $350 U.S.) with double stitching, extra side
&gt;windows, removable velcro bug screens, etc, etc..  They made it out of
&gt;the same heavy-duty canvas that they make boat covers out of, and not
&gt;only is it waterproof, but they tell me it's mould-proof as well.  I
&gt;thought about having the cover made out of tent fabric (more
&gt;lightweight), but thought the canvas would stand up better over the long
&gt;haul.   Just wanted to highlight this as an attractive option (and a
&gt;low-cost one at that!)

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;A buddy of mine is in the market for a new (not vintage) canvas awning to
&gt;&gt;fit his '77 Westy.  Any feedback on brands, distributors, etc. is
welcome.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Help me help this man ...
