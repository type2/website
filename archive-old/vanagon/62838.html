 a                   re&gt; fit stereo in dash
Hi, sure, use a big hammer.  

Seriously:  I have a Blaupunkt (I think it's a) Heidlberg in a slip in case
style.  I move it back and forth from the GTI to the Syncro Vanagon, depending
on which I am currently using.  

Yes, it sticks out a little bit on the Syncro.  But since there is a bit of a
lip over it (the dash) you really don't notice.  It is a bit harder to see the
radio face, too, but not objectional.

Some hints:  Take out the ashtray for access to the back area.  You probably
knew that.  Take out the bracket in the back that the radio is supposed to
hang on, this gives you a bit of extra room, and if you can secure the radio
at the face to the metal dash, it can rest on air duct housing stuff in the
back.  Mine does.

*********ORIGINAL MESSAGE****************
Hello-
Next snag. I just spoke with Crutchfield, the car stereo people, and found out
there is limited space in the Vanagon dash for audio equipment. They list the
depth ot the hole in the dash at 6 1/4&quot; while most stereos are 6 1/2&quot; to 6
3/4&quot; deep.

Has anyone fit a deeper unit than the 6 1/4&quot; in the dash. ...... Is there a
trick to getting a deeper unit in? Or does anyone know of a detachable face CD
unit that fits?
