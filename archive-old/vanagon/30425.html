Subject: new to list

First of all I'm very thankful to have found this list. In my area there 
is very little information available about any buses. One reason is that 
the VW dealership up here isn't all that friendly. I'm looking for a side 
tent or and awning for my '72 Westy. If anyone has one for sale please 
e-mail me with the info.
