Subject: 71 Bus Front Engine Tin Question

I recently bought a 70 Bus with a locked engine.  I had another 70 with a
good running engine that I had bought for parts, so I decided to transfer
the engine.  The original 70 engine had complete tin, but it was pre-doghouse
cooler tin, and wouldn't fit the dual-port engine with doghouse cooler I
had, which was missing the front tin.  A close examination of the tin shows
it to be normal bug tin with a extra piece spot welded on to give it higher
shoulders.  I could cut this 70 front tin to accomodate the dog-house cooler
exhaust, or fabricate the extra piece and add it to normal bug tin, but would
rather get the original.

Does anyone have this front engine tin spare and would you consider selling
or swapping it?  I posted a request to aircldvw but except for one person
asking me if I knew what I was talking about, nothin yet.  I called one used
parts source here in the midwest and they said they had one.  I bought it and
it turned out to not be the right part, in fact I cannot determine what it
came off of.  I currently have a regular bug front engine tin on, so I have
a large gap, making my engine seal ineffective.

Any help or suggestions appreciated.
