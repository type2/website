Subject: Question: '79 bus oil temp/pressure guage installation and wiring

Hey all,

I have VDO oil pressure and oil temp guages mounted in the rubber 
three-guage holder made by VDO.  I've installed the senders, but have 
yet to install the guages or wiring to the cab.  BTW, the oil temp 
sensor is mounted in the sump plate, the pressure sender in the normal 
oil pressure guage location in front of the distributor.

Where's a good place to mount the VDO rubber guage holder?  What's the 
easiest/best way to run the two wires from the senders to the guages?

TIA,

Roy D. Robertson
