Subject: Re: Rubber elbow connecting filler neck and gas tank on 77

GO NOW to your local GATES rubber belt/hose dealer.

He can get 57mm (2.25&quot;) fuel/oil hose in two types
One is wire reinforced, one is not, likely about
$10 and $5 the foot, you may have to buy 3 ft.  Now
I unfortunately got the wire reinforced type for the
'78 because he had it on hand.  It is a bit too stiff
to make the bend easily as it is not bent hose like
origional, still it does an OK job, in fact I got 2.5&quot;
left if anyone wants but really you would do better to
seek out the stuff without wire.  I fear the wire reinforced
is putting too great a strain on my other filler elbow on
the body.
I also note, a lot of rubbers do not resist alcohol and
gasoline, make SURE you get hose that does, specifically
made for gas/oil.  FI Gates and most others also sell hose
that looks exactly the same for big diesel truck cooling
systems, rubber formulation is different, gas goes right
through it after a few months.  I will not swear to this
but I feel good ole Buna-Nitrile Rubber is the most common
gas resistant rubber.
Happy Hunting

John
