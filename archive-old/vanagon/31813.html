&gt;&gt;but there remains one California mystery unsolved...
&gt;&gt;How do keep all those plastic reflectors imbedded in the roads from
&gt;&gt;being scraped off by the snowplows?
&gt;
&gt;Plastic snow plows?


        This would fit in nicely with many of the plastic *people* I knew
in L.A...

        And I lived there for 5 years-I'm not saying they're *all* plastic
- some of my best friends live in L.A.     ;-p

&gt;Actually, it's the road in braille so the blind can drive here too.  ;)

        No, no no. It's for the *drunks*!

Peace,
