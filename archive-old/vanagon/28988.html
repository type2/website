Subject: Re: A winter VW question /f

&gt;state of your checkbook after purchase of said vehicle...   :-0  (got my
&gt;breadloaf from the impound yard for $150... true. 'course the PO was a
&gt;dipsh*t, but that's another story)

Hey that's my trick, once got a K-G from a garage mechanics lien for $40, 
the towing bill!  The PO had curb surfed and bent the beam tubes, man did 
that thing ever corner fast turning right!  Front beam from a beetle 
scrounged at the local landfill fixed it for nada. Kick me, I sold it for 
$200. Tim Smith
