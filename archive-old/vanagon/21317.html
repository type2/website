&gt; At temperatures above 90 degrees the fridge just keep things cool (forget 
&gt; about ice cubes.) If you keep the sliding door open in windy weather, the 
&gt; flame tends to get blown out. (Yes, there's a safety cut-off jet.)

I bet a fridge fan would help - works for me!
 
&gt; Beats me. I bought mine from a propane supplier in NW
&gt; Quebec. (Alot of propane fridges up that way) for 450 Canadian (ouch) five
&gt; years ago. The brand name is Dometic: they supply most of the big fridges
&gt; for big momma RVs. So go to your local RV store and ask to see their
&gt; fridge catalog; you might be able to special order one. An RV guy called 
&gt; Dometic for me and said that they no longer make my particular model 
&gt; though... 

I think I know the fridge you are talking about.  They sell it at
Camping World.  If it's the one I think it is, 450 Canadian was a very
good price!  You got a bargain...
