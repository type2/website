Subject: Road trip

Hello all,

I just purchased my first Westy, a 84 with 130k miles.  I am planing on
taking an extended road trip within the next month from RI out to the west
coast and back(about 9K miles in total) and was wondering what should I have
checked out on the westy before departing.  The van runs strong and the PO
had no problems with it.  The only two possible problems that I can find are
that it has a oil leak, and the fore to aft radiator hoses have been replace
with PVC piping.  The PVC was installed by the PO VW mechanic and has held
up for the past two years.  Has anyone heard of this before??  Does anyone
know the maximum temperature rating for standard white PVC piping??   
Also if anyone has done a trip from New England out to Colorado, Utah,
Arizona, California, Oregon, Washington, Idaho, and back, I'd love to get
some info on places to stay/sights to see.  Taking 70 out to Colorado and 90
back from Idaho, the rest is up in the air. 
Any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks
Mike D.
