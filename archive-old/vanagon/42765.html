anyone fix these things, or is there an aftermarket version &gt; available? 
Last time I checked the dealer wanted several hundred ($300?) or so &gt; for
a new one.  Maybe someone has a used one they are willing to part with?  &gt;
Rather get this one fixed if I can. 

Check with Mike Cooley at: 8070 Cinders Road, Memephis, TN 38133. He 
repairs throttle bodies for Porsche 914's, maybe he'll do yours also. H'e 
svery reasonably priced (around 50$). You can email him from the 914 home 
page: http://www.estinc_dot_com/porsche.
