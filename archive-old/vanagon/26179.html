My 87 Syncro has this sound and mine comes from a loose heat sheild on the
exhaust pipe near the muffler.  One of the brackets holding the shield in
place is broken.  Non-Syncros do NOT have this shield.


&gt; If I get the go-ahead from the
&gt;Volks guys maybe I'll see some of you down in Panamint Springs in
&gt;November...4-wheelin' - whoopee!
&gt;
Wow! people are planning on off roading up there?  I hadn't read about that
part before.  What is the current plan / status / agenda / roster on this
trip?
