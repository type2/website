&gt; that second would be better but would like some conformation.

At 60 km/h, I'd drive in 3rd--2nd gear would be winding the little engine 
out, I think.  (For our US metric-impaired cousins, 60 km/h is about, 
what?  37 mph?)

My up shift points ('76 bus, 2.0 L motor) on level ground are roughly:
2 --&gt; 3 : 23 - 27 mph
3 --&gt; 4 : 35 - 42 mph (although I will hold 3rd higher climbing a grade).

I shift at these points because it just &quot;feels&quot; right.  But this is 
coming from a guy who cruises no faster than 57 mph.  :-)

Just my CDN$0.02.
