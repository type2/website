Subject: A sticky situation (brake fluid leak)

Well, we've begun the process of bringing our recently-purchased '84 
Westy to road-worthiness.

We noticed leaking brake fluid down at the pedals (now I know why the PO 
left so many bottles in the Westy when he sold it!).  We replaced the 
brake master cylinder last week - after removing the entire dashboard 
(and going through list withdrawal - thanks for bringing it back!!).
  
Bled the brakes last Sat., no leaks, getting prepped for our first camp 
this coming weekend, drove it to dinner last night  - it's leaking again! 
 My husband checked all the checkable things - which looked fine.  

Anyone else had similar fun?  We're thinking the next stop is 
slave/clutch-related.

Thanks much, all.
