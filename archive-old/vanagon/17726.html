&gt; I know that we've been round and round about wheels and tires in this group
&gt; (no pun intended).  I've got an '89 Westy with an automatic.  I'd like to
&gt; decrease engine rpm/road speed and I'm willing to sacrifice a bit of the
&gt; van's blistering (not) accelleration.  So, I'd like to put some taller tires
&gt; on the van.  I've currently go standard 5.5&quot; x 14&quot; steel wheels.  I thought
&gt; of putting some 205s on them, but I think that they would be too tall and
&gt; I'd wind up with too much distance between the wheel and the tread making
&gt; the van's abysmal handling even worse.  So, I thought, why not put 6&quot; x 15&quot;
&gt; wheels on and then I would not have to worry so much about huge sidewalls.
&gt; Now the question is, where could I get 6 x 15s with the correct offset?
&gt; Don't Chevy (perish the thought) wheels have the same bolt pattern?  Any
&gt; suggestions???

I would be very interested in 15&quot; wheels too, if I hadn't just bought
new tires.  :)  But I love my 205-70*HR*14s.  They handle great!
