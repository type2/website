Subject: Re: Zooning Police


&gt;Any loser with a clip board and a tow truck who attempts to remove it from
&gt;my property will be guilty of theft, plain and simple.
                               ^^^^^
Ok, I'm assuming everyone means zoning, which shouldn't have anything to 
do with what can or can't be parked in front of your house.  That would 
be covered by some other law.  Also, I think the cars that get towed are 
those that sit in the road for a long time, not the ones in your yard.  
State Constitutions don't give anyone the right to park an old, immobile 
and broken down car in the street.


As far as shooting someone that enters your yard to tow your car, if you 
can prove that they posed a threat to your life( which I doubt you could), 
then you'd be justified, otherwise you'd be in jail.
