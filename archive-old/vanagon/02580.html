Subject: manifold destiny


Have any of you ever actually cooked on your engine, manifold,
exhaust, muffler, whatever?  I'd like to hear more about this!
Also, does anyone actually have this book, &quot;Manifold Destiny,&quot;
and, if so, would you kindly e-mail me the author and publisher?

Thanks...
