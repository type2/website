Subject: seeking T3 Westy (will travel)

I have a friend that is looking for a T3 Westy H2O preferably with power
steering,  automatic a plus, A/C a plus, no rust a definite plus.  He has no
computer so call him at (803) 689-5884 South Carolina after 4 pm. He will
travel for the right camper and he has cash in hand.  If you have no phone
(and I don't believe you) his address is 21 Herring Gull,  Hilton Head Is.,
SC 29926.  His name is Nick Luciano.
