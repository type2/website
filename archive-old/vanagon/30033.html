Hey there!

well, amelia and i own a 71 camper and a 81 diesel pickup (both vw of
course:) and i love 'em both.  the diesel is great.  40 MPG on the
average, runs great, and i believe will probably run forever.  as far
as underpowered goes, well yeah, you won't be beating anyone at the
starting line or anything, but it definately hauls us and whatever we
put in the back where ever we want to go and we never say, &quot;shoot, i 
wish we could go a little faster!&quot;  heck, its a bus, and they aren't
really known for power.  but i like the diesel and if i was to buy
another bus i would probably consider a diesel if i saw one.

take care,
	brandy
