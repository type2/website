Subject: '71 camshaft problems
Date: Fri, 18 Aug 1995 00:13:28 -0400 (EDT)

Note: steamy message by Veeduber Bob attached...

Hi y'all,

I had high hopes (of finding what some of you have found in your buses) 
of getting my '71 1600dp engine together this week-end but have run into 
what seems to be a _serious_ snag.  My crankshaft spins smoothly in half 
of the crankcase but upon adding the camshaft, spinning the two together 
yields a real tight spot.  It's exactly the same 'fit' (-2) as the old 
one, and as a matter of fact, the old one does it also now. Does this 
mean a shitty align-bore?  Anybody had this problem? What did you do?  
As far as  I know, these are my options:  1-Find, somehow, a camshaft 
that fits with a  different number (0, -1, etc.);  2 - get a new case   3 
- Offer the pieces to members of the list and give up mechanikin'.  I've 
been leaning  very hard on Veeduber Bob for help.  Here's his last 
message to me...it's too cool to hog to myself so I'm posting it for the 
list.  I even had to  read it to my wife and 13 month old 
humanoidterrormeister.  They dug it.

Thanks in advance for your experiences.

WARNING !! For mature adults! I must admit a bit of arousal after 
paragraph #3 :-)...\&lt;

Crush is the wedging effect that occurs with gears when the engagement is too
deep.

The face of a gear tooth is not straight, it prescribes a subtle ogive curve,
a very sexy thing that starts nearly flat but curves at an increasing rate,
the rate having to do with the pitch (or basic shape) of that gear.  When
properly mated with a matching gear, and with the engagement properly set,
the gear teeth do not clash, they kiss.  A light film of oil prevents
metal-to-metal contact.  Since both gears are rotating, the kiss is sort of
smeared across the face of the gear tooth until the angle reaches a certain
critical value -- just where binding would occur... except the end of the
gear tooth isn't there, it has been cut away.  But before the gear teeth
loose contact, another kiss has taken place just one tooth away and the
ballet continues.

The amount of enegry transferred by these delicate kisses is determined by
the area of the contact, the pitch of the teeth, the number in contact at any
one time and other factors.  The engineer began by calculating the amount of
energy he would need to actuate the valve train then worked backwards to
calculate how many teeth, their width and so on.  The ratio between the crank
and the cam was already known 2:1 since this is a 4-cylce engine, but as you
can see the number of teeth could have been anything divisible by two.
 Ultimately, the engineer calculates how rapidly the teeth will wear and
adjusts the other factors accordingly.  He is liable to go through a dozen or
more iterations, altering a single factor each time until he arrives at a
design that not only does the job but is durable, inexpensive to manufacture,
easy to assemble and so forth.

But that is all on paper.  If you were building but a single engine you would
keep cutting gears and checking them until you got a set that provided
optimum engagement.

In serial, or 'mass' production you must allow for tooling wear and other
factors.  Instead of stating a single acceptable dimension you must give the
factory a range of acceptable dimensions.  The range isn't very much, and
German machinists are very good, but you still end up with some parts that
aren't 'right' when combined with some other parts, even though they all fall
within the acceptable range.  This is called 'tolerance stack-up' and is not
tolerable, in the worst case.

The fit between the cam and the crank is one of those cases.  To make for
easy assembly the cam gear is manufactured in not one size but several, with
the cam that most nearly matches the allowable tolerance be used in that
particular engine.

In the case of your engine you are faced with two questions that must be
resolved.  The first is, does your cam fit or not?  The gross test is to lay
the crank and cam into the engine, test to see if the fit is too loose (if
you can feel appreciable movement in the cam when the crank is held
stationary, it is too loose).  If too loose, seek a cam with a number larger
in the positive direction, that is, if you have a -1 cam, try a 0 or unmarked
cam.  If still too loose, try a +1 and so on.

If you're sure it isn't too loose you must then determine if it is too
tight(!).  The gross test here is to assemble the crankcase and rotate the
crank. It should spin freely without any tight spots.  If it does not, and
you're sure the tightness is due to the cam (you should have tried the crank
by itself in an earlier pre-assembly), then you must try a cam that with a
number smaller in the negative direction, that is, if you have a +2 then try
a +1.

This is 'Determination of Cam Gear Engagement By Assembly', the least
accurate and most time consuming of the three common methods of determining
cam gear fit, but it is the only method that does not require either
precision measuring instruments or machinist skills.  Of course, it assumes
you have all seven sizes of cam available for trial assembly... and that one
of them will fit.  If your align-bore job was REALLY screwed up (and I've
seen a few), none of the cams will fit -- you just ate the crankcase.

I start with a new cam gear on a new cam.  Not 'new' in the usual sense;
unused; I've had it about twenty years so it isn't really new.  It is a +1.
 After assembling the cam-driver gear onto the crank, I set up the dial
indicator and test the combination for lash.  Based on the readings I get, I
know about which cam-driven gear will fit.  I put in that size and check, if
it looks okay -- lash usually less than a thou -- I mark the teeth with blue,
assemble the case, spin it, dismantle and check the contact pattern.  If it
looks okay I stamp the engine number on the cam gear (it is already stamped
on the nose of the crank; the last four digits are enough).  Thereafter, they
are said to be 'married' to that particular engine.  I also note the cam
deviation in the assembly log, along with the lift, which will be measured
later.  If some problem is encountered later in the preassembly I'm often
able to work out a solution because I know exactly what is happening inside
the engine at any particular degree of rotation.  For example, height of a
particular cam lob is seldom the same as the other three even through their
lifts may be identical.  When I assemble the valve train I take that into
account -- the lifters and push-rods each have some dimensional variation.
 When I'm done with preassembly the engine's mechanical actuations will be as
uniform as HUMANLY possible even though the components may have a wide range
of dimensions.  This is achieved simply by matching, say, a low cam lobe
height to a slightly long cam-follower, or a rocker with a slight difference
in cup-depth.

No, it isn't very practical -- I doubt if it makes much difference... except
to me.  The really crazy part is that I think the engines LIKE to be
assembled that way, just as a pretty woman likes to look her best.

If I need an align-bore I take the case to Larry Pauter in Chula Vista, or
Jack Riddle in Santa Ana.  I've seen their tooling.  If they do an align-bore
it comes out straight.  (Don't tell Jack, but I think Larry's tooling --
which he made himself using an old LeBlond 12&quot; lathe as the bed -- is just a
tad better than the rig Jack uses.)  Larry's shop is closer but he charges
more, takes longer.  Jack's shop (RIMCO) is near other suppliers, usually can
do the job while I'm running around, handy if I have to get other things.

Gears are fundamental things with few rules to learn.  Once you learn to
recognize proper engagement you can set-up a cam or a ring &amp; pinion with
equal confidence.  It's a handy thing to know.
