Subject: Re: window rubber: removing those unsightly plastic thingies

It is virtually impossible to get them back in.  Book specifies that they
only go in when the glass and the gasket are being reinstalled.  I would
agree, although strong fingers and slatherings of lubricant MIGHT do it.
I haven't had any trouble with windshield or window gaskets after removing
the trim.  If you're still worried, leave them in and paint them flat black.
