Subject:       Q: one vs. two Carbs

I have the opportunity to put a weber progressive carb on my 73 bus.  
This carb would replace the two original solexes.  I have owned the 
bus for approximately 1 year and the carbs have proven to be the weak 
link.  Last June, Bob (Veeduber_at_aol_dot_com) of this list wrote an 
excellent posting on this issue.  Unfortunately, he is out to 
win races down in the Baha, I'm only out to beat the bus next to 
me to the next redlight.  A local VW guru thinks I should stick 
to the dual carbs.  He says if they are running good, they will out-
perform the weber due to the shorter intake distances.  I like the 
idea of one carb instead of two headaches.  Is the difference in 
performance significant?

Other news:  I went to a junk yard a while back.  They 
had a Ben &amp; Jerry's bus (cow logo).  After seeing it, I can remember 
this bus selling ice cream out of coolers when there was only 
two employees.  I snagged the hazard switch :).
