Subject: Re: Alternate A/C refrigerants?

&gt;From: &quot;Jerry Hudgins&quot; &lt;jerry_at_sequoia.e-farm_dot_com&gt;
&gt;
&gt;I've got a '91 Carat that needs A/C work, and I'm thinking that it's
&gt;time to bite the bullet and switch the refrigerant from R12 to...
&gt;something.  Has anyone tried R134a yet?  Are Eric Zeno's old notes on
&gt;this from the archives accurate?  Anyone try Pennzoil's FR12/Frigc?
&gt;Other suggestions or comments?

I'll be taking our '90 GL to R134a in the next two weeks.
The local dealer quoted around $1500 for the swap (with a new compressor,
because, they claim, I need it).
Houston's Swiss Auto Haus or Auto Werks or something like that said,
conditionally (doesn't need all new hoses) that it would be around $!000.

The warning that they all give me is that the coolant isn't as efficient
(about 15% less so) and that if I don't get the whole system replaced with
something with more capacity I may not like it.  I say that 85% more
cooling is better than it is now...

The reason I'm forced to convert is that the A/C has had a slow,
unfindable, coolant leak since we bought the vehicle (as a &quot;new&quot;/used
program car) with 12k miles on it.  The dealer has checked it out several
times and never found the leak.  They even replaced the compressor (thank
goodness we bought the &quot;extended warranty&quot;).  There is some staining around
the seals on the compressor, so the dealer automatically assumes that it
must be replaced.  I thought that the change required new seals anyway, and
if that's whats leaking, I ought to be able to keep the not-that-old
dealer-replaced compressor.  Does that make sense, or is there some kind of
leakage voodoo on A/C compressors that I don't comprehend?

I'll be sure to let the list know how it all turns out, after the
conversion is complete...
