Subject: Re: Sighting: VW powered Jeep CJ-5

Jeep CJ style bodies were offered as a kit car conversion in the late 
'70s, early '80s (I think).  I've seen one around here also.  They were 
offered through an ad in HVWs (dig out your old copies and have a look-see).

&gt; Strange sighting on Saturday. I stopped by the local VW flaps and noticed a
&gt; normal conservative looking Jeep CJ5 &lt;or older-Im not up on Jeeps&gt; parked
&gt; behind the store. The parking lot is situated so that it is nearly mandatory
&gt; to go to the rear of the store and pull a U-turn and come back out the same
&gt; way you came in.
&gt; As I passed the Jeep I noticed the owner standing at the rear of it looking
&gt; down. I literally did a double take as I noticed a clean looking 1600 T1
&gt; style motor positioned in the usual spot &lt;for a vw&gt;. The man just smiled as
&gt; I drove by. I had no time to stop and inspect. Weird but cool! =)
&gt; 
&gt; With the rear &quot;lid&quot; down, I never would have thought any thing about the
&gt; vehicle as it looked perfectly normal for a Jeep.
