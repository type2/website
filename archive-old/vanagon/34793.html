Subject: CIS problems AGAIN!

Hi Volks,
   Back with another episode of CIS on the mend.  Last time I wrote on this
subject I said I installed a new warm-up regulator and that it seemed to be
running great.  Well, that lasted all of a week.  Last week on my way to
Shrewsbury,MA for the LiMBO meeting the van started skipping again. It's
been running crappy since. I've double checked everything, including
installing a new coil and wires. Set the timing to specs. Check fuel
injectors and seals. One of the injectors is bad,installing a new one, and
I've installed new seals. I've narrowed it down to the O2 sensor.  Since it
has never been installed on the Vanagon. I've been told that it will affect
my emissions and fuel mileage, especially when cold. So I've in the
proccess of having the exhaust manifold drilled for an O2 sensor. I've also
been told I may have broken a valve spring. It's possible, I've not been to
kind the engine these last few months.  I've red-lined the engine a couple
of times when I've gotten really fustrated with it. So tomorrow, 2/8, I'll
install the O2 sensor and check for broken valve springs.  I really don't
know why I writting this post accept to say if anyone has any more
suggestions to my problems, please write me.  Bye all, I'll let you know
how I made out.  Thanks for your time.
