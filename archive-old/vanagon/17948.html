I installed a 10&quot; free-air sub in the rear seat kickpanel of my '86 Westy. A
12&quot; square piece of hardboard serves as a barrier from the tools I keep under
the seat, and protects the speaker diaphragm. The subwoofer amp is in the aux.
battery compartment under the driver's seat. This works pretty good, though the
back seat passengers can become excited or soothed by the bass coming through
the seat.
I also have 5.25&quot; woofer drivers in the lower door panels and separate 1&quot;
tweeters epoxied to the OEM speaker grills in the upper doors. In the back I
installed 4&quot; two-ways in the A/C panel to fill out the sound for rear seat
passengers.
Its still not optimal (road/wind noise is still a problem, any ideas?) but I'm
pretty satisfied with the sound for the money I spent.  I tried the enclosed
sub tubes, but they were much muddier than the free-air.
