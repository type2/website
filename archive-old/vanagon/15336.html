Subject: Tues. junkyard field trip


Barf-face Prunehead and I are going to make a field trip tomorrow
to a VW-only junkyard in the east bay.  If anyone would care to
join us or meet us there, you're very welcome.  It's out beyond
Concord, sort of on the outskirts of Martinez.  E-mail me or
use phone (510.376.4321) if you'd like further info.  It's called 
&quot;Bud's Bugs,&quot; but they have plenty of all years of bus stuff
there, too.  Lee (UK) - I'm finally going there!  - I'll keep 
an eye out for your stuff, and thanks for your patience....
