Subject: Arbitrating VW - Vanagon Head Gaskets

Hello again !

I just had to replace the left head gasket/seal
on my '87 Syncro.  It only has 47,000 miles on it
so I called VW Customer Relations first to complain
and ask them to pay 100%.  They said they would
only go 50% and that I could take it to arbitrations
to try and get more.

Is there anyone out there that has done this on this
old of a vehicle and won ?

Thanks in advance !

Kevin Disse
'87 Syncro GL
