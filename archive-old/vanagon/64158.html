Subject: Re: Where is Coolant Temperature Sender?

Thanks to all who came to my aid.

Joel said

&gt; snip&lt;&lt;ok, now. one of the senders sticks off to the left side ...
&gt; that's the BLUE
&gt; one for the brain/ECU/computer. the other one sticks out toward the
&gt; front
&gt; of the bus and is SILVER in color (actually, only the base of the
&gt; gizmo is
&gt; silver, but ...) and is the one that drives the gauge.&gt;&gt;snip

Found it.

&gt; snip&lt;&lt;but you WILL get coolant in your
&gt; face, hair, eyes if you loosen it from under there.&gt;&gt;snip

Didn't have to loosen anything.

&gt; snip&lt;&lt;what do you need?&gt;&gt;snip

Didn't need to get anything.

&gt; snip&lt;&lt;clean off the electrical connector and clip it back on.&gt;&gt;snip

As Joel said, I just cleaned the connector and all was fine again.

Thanks again to everyone.
Larry
