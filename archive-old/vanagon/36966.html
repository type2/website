&gt; Let me get this straight: my 27-year-old VW will &quot;soon&quot; be scrap???
&gt; Guess I'd better junk it now, even tho it runs fine.
&gt; 
&gt; BTW, did he happen to predict where the F100 will be when it is 27 years 
&gt; old?  :^)

   It's a 74 F100 and a 90 Vanagon... I'd say it (the F100) will be just 
fine considering it's 22 years old now.
