Subject: Great Canadian Bug Show

If you are looking for a wonderful place to show your Vanagon, come to
Toronto on the 18th for the Great Canadian Bug Show.

For information, look at http://www.ftn_dot_net/~scirocco/bugshow/gcbshome.htm

Look forward to seeing you all there.  Don't forget to visit the swap meet
and get all those parts you've been looking for!


See you there
