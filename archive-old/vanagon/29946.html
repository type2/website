&gt; If anything, wouldn't it make things worse by screwing up

I would think so. Bob Hoover recommended pulling the engine and 
retorquing all head bolts at 300 miles. Apparently that's what VW did and
according to Bob, failure to return for that 300 mile checkup/retorquing 
could void the warranty. 

&gt;  
&gt; 	Why torque the heads down really tight at all?

Retorquing doesn't imply tightening beyond specs. It means retightening 
TO specs. I think the logic goes that vibration and heat allow the 
torqued bolts to settle some...thus losing the to-spec torque that you 
provided originally. Retorquing puts everything back to where it ought to 
be...sort of like that disclaimer on the cereal box: some settling of 
contents may occur.

&gt; Does it hold ignition compression? Or is it a guard against
&gt; a fatigue failure of something or the other?
&gt;  

Apparently lots (possibly most) folks don't retorque the heads. 
Apparently these folks suffer from more little nagging oil leaks and 
probably loose at least a few thousand miles of longevity on their engines.

&gt; I *might* do them when I drop the engine to do the pressure plate,
&gt; which is coming far, far too soon.

I can't imagine not doing it at that point. You're 45 minutes or less 
from having the job done right with that engine sitting there waiting for 
the pressure plate. (And I'm a SLOW &quot;mechanic&quot;) 

Good luck! Joe
