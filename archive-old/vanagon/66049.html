From:         &quot;R. A. \&quot;Pete\&quot; SELLERS&quot; &lt;sellersp_at_MIDMONET.NET&gt;
Subject:      THING For Sale

Hope you'll forgive being included in &quot;group-mail&quot; but this is the best
I can do to communicate with all who have asked. I've been away; upon my
return there were several query-messages waiting.

Several are on this list because others sent me your address, with
notice you may be interested to purchase a THING.

I HAVE A THING I'D LIKE TO SELL!!

Since I placed notice that my THING was for sale, I had NO response!!
Feel like I missed the &quot;season&quot; to sale it.

Below is the notice I previously posted but got no response, until now.

As an UPDATE, I'm actively in the process of moving. I will be
        transporting the THING to Saint Louis and will leave it there
        with associates who are willing to park it until I can get back
        and go through the steps needed to place it in storage.
        My preference IS and was to sell it to avoid the deterioration
        that will occur in storage.

        Since I've never neded to place a vehicle in storage, I'm not
        certain about performing all the measures AND performing all
        the measures, to an adequate degree.

        Now, I don't have the time to do much more than I'm doing to try
        and preserve the THING.

=================== FOR SALE =================
I'm relocating soon and must do something with &quot;Pete's PLAY THING&quot;.
Don't have the heart to think about storage after the restoration effort
put into it.

I got it near the end of summer '96 and went through a hectic time, list
of events &amp; effort to get it roadworthy and respectable-looking.
Now it's looking for a new home. :(

Need to settle this as soon as possible.

=================== END OF FOR SALE NOTICE =================

don't get to log onto this email site often.

If you'd loe to respond or would like more informaiton your best chance
