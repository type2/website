Subject: Driveshaft keeps coming off
Date: Wed, 30 Apr 1997 20:33:38 +0100

1984 GL Auto with 185k miles:
The nearside driveshaft has come off on two occasions. All the bolts must
have come loose together. After the first time I asked my garage to have a
look and he said he tightened it up a lot, and used nutlock. Yet it
happened again.

It was the end nearer the middle, on the left. Bearing in mind its a right
hand drive car.

Any ideas? Is there something missing that locks the bolts on?
