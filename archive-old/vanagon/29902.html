Subject: Re: Australian campers (to rent)

Hello, Andy--
There are a few NEATO members in Australia, and one in particular told me 
she wanted to set up a VW Camper rental thing in Sydney. Try contacting 
Samantha Bermel, (02) 560-6783. If she isn't doing it yet, maybe she 
knows someone who is. I have her mother's phone number if this one does 
not get you through to her.

&gt; I'm off to Australia on Sunday to visit my SO's family for Xmas and want to
&gt; ask a favour of anyone who lives in or near Sydney. Do you know of a place
&gt; that rents air-cooled VW campers? (or even Beetles) I'm sure I saw an ad for
&gt; such a place when I was there a few years ago but haven't been able to find
&gt; out from here. We want to drive down the coast to Melbourne and back and I
&gt; can't hack two weeks driving one of those gruesome T*y*ta contraptions.
&gt; Sorry for asking about this at the very last moment but we only decided to
&gt; go on Wednesday so I'm rushing around buying Xmas prezzies and mince pies
&gt; and the like. BTW, don't ever expect to be able to buy flip-flops and
&gt; sunblock in the Midlands in November :)
