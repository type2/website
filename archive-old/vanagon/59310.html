Subject: Gas in oil? UPDATED UPDATE

OK. I messed with the doohickey in the AFM and at least got the fuel
pump shut off when the engine is not running. Hopefully, that will take
care of the gas in oil problem.  Later today, I am going to re-check the
temp sensor to see if it is bad.  I think that is the other problem. 
Thanks for all the help.
