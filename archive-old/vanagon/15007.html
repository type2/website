Subject: sagging rear torsion bars


I've had a few replies regarding the mag. article describing adjusting the
rear torsion bars. The article was one of a series done about their
&quot;Project Westfalia&quot; a '71 restoration, which I thought was quite good and
inspiring. I'll dig up what I can Meanwhile, hasn't the old Bentley got a
procedure for doing the same? (my copy is out in the garage, in my old '72).
You do have to buy some sort of bubble level-cum-protractor thingy and do
some spatial thinking, that and sheer laziness caused me to buy KYB
Gas-Adjust shocks when I got the worries about my '72's rear end. The
shocks did make a big difference, and lifted the van about 1/2&quot; into the
bargain.
