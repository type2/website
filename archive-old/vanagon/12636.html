 I, too, am from this wind-blown, frozen cube of a country. I hail
from Ottawa; just a couple of hours from where you are. You're not the
white Westy on Earl St. by any chance? If so, I have a few friends in
the immediate vicinity... If you need parts info. etc., I'm in the
process of compiling a list of dealers (not VW dealers) and contacts
in the Ottawa valley/western Quebec region. It'll be yours once I
complete it.
