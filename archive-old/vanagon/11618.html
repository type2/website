&gt;ps I'll check on the ingredients tonight
&gt; 
&gt;pps what's the cost??  The waxoyl was $30ish a can from Moss Motors.
&gt;(and a can is a half gallon)
 
I just got a price from one distributor here in Pittsburgh of
$43.07/gallon, and $8.88/11oz. spray can.
I got a price last night from another supplier of $4.70/11oz.spray can.
He didn't have any gallons.
Go figure?
Jon
