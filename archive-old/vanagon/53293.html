&gt;there are some 'cheapo' makes of it out there that do not seem to fuse well

The only problem with the self-fusing silicone tape is that it tears *very*
easily when it gets nicked - but makes a wonderful grip tape on baseball
bats (lasts maybe one game)!!

The stuff we all want is available from Griot's Garage mail order catalog
(1800/345-5789) as part #23315, 'rubberized fix-it tape', 3/4&quot; X 27 ft. long.
