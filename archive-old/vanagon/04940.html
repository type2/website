Has anyone ever removed the top from a Westfalia? I mean the whole unit,
tent and all;
right off the body. If for example you wanted to repaint the whole van or
clean the darn thing; removing the roof would be the way to go. Just
wondering - DC

PS my father was rummaging through something called (psi?) on internet and
he came across something called &quot;David Carment's Silver Secret&quot;. Nothing
else was remotely related to vanagons. Since
that was the title of a discussion a while back, I was wondering if we
are &quot;cross linked&quot; with something else on the internet? Any ideas?
