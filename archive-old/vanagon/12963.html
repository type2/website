Subject: little brackets

        On my '73, I have some little brackets that look like some narrow 
belting material would go through on the side of the icebox bar beside the 
walkthrough.  I think they are about 1 foot from the floor and I was 
wondering if they were used to somehow hold down the little seat that goes 
there (you know, the one that looks like a footstool).  I guess it could 
also be for some little bracket that would help hold up the counter that 
swings over the walkthrough.....

Thanks for the help.

Dean
