&gt;&gt; As this place is in national forest, and kind of wilderness-like, I have to
&gt;&gt; ask the people who were there to help me reconstruct directions on how to
&gt;&gt; get there, but here's something to get you generally oriented:
&gt;
&gt;As I recall it was called campsite #5.  8 miles North from the main road
&gt;(10?).

&gt;From SoCal:
     Take Rt. 178 east from Bakersfield to Lake Isabella.  Go north along Lake
     Isabella (either Hwy 155 or 190) to Kernville.  Continue North (Rt. 190)
     to Johnsondale.  This road is very scenic, following a river.  Don't miss
     Johnsondale... it's tiny.

     Take the first right north of Johnsondale.  Follow this paved road back
     about 8 miles.

&gt;From NoCal:
     Take rt. 99 south to Porterville.  Then take rt. 190 east/south towards
     Camp Nelson.  Follow this very scenic (paved) mountain road past Camp
     Nelson and Quaking Aspen, and past the turn-off to California Hot Springs.
     The road to the campsite is a dead-end paved road to the left.  There
     is a sign across from the head of the road pointing towards Johnsondale
     and the towns you just came through.  If you get to Johnsondale, turn
     around and go back, looking for the first left.

Have fun.  Wish I could make it!
