&gt; The only time oil and gas can meet is through either the valves or
&gt; the rings (assuming the intake tract is working properly).  Assuming
&gt; the valve seals are in good shape, that only leaves the rings.  The
&gt; cylinder walls are lubricated by oil splashing and spraying on them
&gt; and at the same time (almost) they are exposed to combustion chamber
&gt; gasses.  I would guess that the amount of gasoline and additives that
&gt; ends up in the oil is directly proportional to the sealing capability
&gt; of the rings.  I would expect that an engine with worn rings would
&gt; dirty its oil almost immediately.  Has anyone experienced this?

No, but looking at it the other way, take a look at your spark plugs on an 
engine with worn rings. Yechh!

I also think worn valve guides could be a source of oil/gas mix problems.
