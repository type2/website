Subject: Need advice:  Trouble after rebuild

Dear air-cooled Wizards:

Well, I just got through rebuilding the 1600 in my bus.  Everything
seemed fine for the first 50 miles, and then I started to 
lose power.  Now there is a loud growl from the crankcase and she
doesn't idle so good.  Can anyone offer advice as to what might
be wrong, and how I could have caused this?  Second, I'm currently
35 miles from home -- should I call a tow truck, or have I already
done the damage I'm going to do and just (try to) drive it home?

Here's what I have done to the engine:

1)  New (used) case, line-bored, new crank and cam bearings to fit.
2)  Old crank and cam measured OK, reused.
3)  New pistons and cylinders.
4)  Old heads ground, new valves and guides.
5)  Oil pump in spec, reused.
6)  I followed Muir meticulously during this procedure.

Any advice from old hands gratefully accepted.
