Subject: Vanagon rentals

I am interested in renting a late model vanagon or EV for a 2-week trip in late 
June.  My SO does not have the same faith in our '66 as I have and also thinks 
we'll melt w/o a/c (we're going south).  I am wondering if anyone knows of a 
place where they rent them in or around the New England area.

Thanks in advance for any suggestions!
