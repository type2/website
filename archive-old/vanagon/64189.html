Subject: Mold

We've just acquired an '84 Westfalia with two problems (well, a lot more
than 2 problems but only two for this posting).  Dennis, the Westy, has
mold on his ceiling.  I am afraid to scrub it because I think I might
take off the sprayed-on fuzzy stuff.  Does anyone have a solution?  Will
bleach discolor the fuzzy stuff?

My other question is about the curtains.  I really would like to give
them a good cleaning but am concerned about unscrewing the fabric from
the wall.  Will it ruin the fabric? Does anyone have any other
suggestions?
