Subject: RE: Needed - EV Oil Filters

&gt; The difference is the big nut on the end of the oil filter....eventhough =
&gt; I have not personally changed the oil, I did get to watch once (does =
&gt; that make me a lubrication voyeur?)....
&gt; 
&gt; The oil filter is in a real tight place, and it does not appear that the =
&gt; usual slip wrench would fit into the area.
&gt; 
Can anyone confirm if that's the only difference?

Are they the same as the Corrado/Passat G60 filters? When I had my 
Corrado, every 3rd party filter company listed it as being the same 
as the standard VW filters. If there's no difference other than the 
big nut on the end (which may require buying a socket for), then why 
not buy the standard VW filter &amp; a slip on cap type wrench? (about $5 
around here, comes on 4-5 sizes at Walmart, with 1/2&quot; drive socket 
hole in end).
