&gt;The car had broken down
&gt;about a mile down the road, I had taken the car phone.  She walked to a pay
&gt;phone to call me but I had already left and forgotton to turn on the car
&gt;phone.  She ended up calling a tow truck that towed her to a service 
station
&gt;($65) and left it there for the weekend because the mechanic would not be 
in
&gt;until Monday.  All her plans for the weekend were shot.  She was starting 
to
&gt;forgive me until Monday night when she found out the mechanic simply 
removed
&gt;my vice grips.  She told me in no uncertain terms that since I like to 
tinker
&gt;with my van so much (instead of having a 'professional mechanic' do 
repairs)
&gt;that I should spend more time with it ... starting that night!


If I'm any judge, this one gets major points for inconveniencing the wife...
and eventually, you!   &gt;:-0
