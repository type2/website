Subject: Expedient leak-stop (water side)

 A guy brought his pick-up by to see about getting it raised. Some 
fool had lowered it. He'd had a radiator leak the month before and
was in desperate straits at the time. He used a quart of goats milk
in the radiator and hasn't had any more problems. It does smell a little
hairy in the engine compartment tho. I don't think I want to 
reccomend this but it's an interesting observation. It was rice- 
burner so you purists need not get your shorts in a bind. I didn't 
think to inquire what kind of goat it was.
