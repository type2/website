Subject: SSWMDAA


     SSWMDAA is Silver Syncro Westie Mad Dash Across America, natch.

     The participants:

     The Silver Syncro Westie
     Tom, your correspondent and chief instigator.
     Michele, my wife, still open to the idea after finishing a grueling
        technical translation from the German on turbo-diesel syncro's with
        16&quot; wheels, posted here some months ago.
     Colin, our 5 year old son, who is very much looking forward to
        this trip in a &quot;transformer van&quot;. He has NO idea how long he will
        be sitting in the next three weeks.

     We are leaving for Oregon to pickup the new (to us) Silver Syncro
     Westie a week from tomorrow. I'm packing my tools, my printouts of
     various downloads (including the junkyard list), my Bentley, my
     camping gear, my maps, my family, my money, but decided not to take my
     laptop, so I'll be unsubscribed and out of touch...

     But maybe not! You, the denizens of vanagon_at_lenti land, may actually
     inhabit physical spaces! Maybe we'll be passing by! Maybe we'll be
     broken down two blocks away, and instead of calling Joel's surly
     answering machine, we could call you!

     Seriously, I would appreciate local knowlege on trustworthy mechanics,
     contacts, places to go, places to stay away from etc.  Post it to the
     list, for all to enjoy. E-mail me your phone number, if you like. Here
     is our itinerary, such as we know it:

     August 16: Arrive Pendleton, Oregon, complete the purchase of the SSW,
     presuming its anything close to being as represented. Move in, outfit
     at local Walmart or equivalent (Dollar Store?)

     August 17-20 : Shakedown drive to Union, Oregon, and show and tell for
     fellow listmember jarnott_at_ednet1.osl.or_dot_gov. Then  Brownian motion
     from Union to Sequoia Nat'l Park, where we have long standing
     backcountry reservations. Route will be something like 97 south to 5,
     possibly diverting to 89/49 if we get tired of driving fast...or
     stopping for fish tacos? (We will vaguely be in the area at the right
     time - the devil is in the details...)

     August 21-28 Backpacking in the Sierras, west of Mt. Whitney.

     August 28 - Sept 4. Beating a hasty retreat. For a little Syncro
     action, cross the Sierras on California Route J41 (closed in winter)
     From there, exact route unclear, but we presume we will track east on
     a combination of Route 50 and Interstate 70. Nevada, Utah, Colorado,
     Kansas, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, West Virginia, Virginia, to
     home in Maryland.

     September 5. School Starts. Work Starts. SSWMDAA ends.

     TIA
