Subject: Re: Vanagon paintjob

&gt;&gt;A good paint job requires FULL stripping, FULL sanding down, followed by 
&gt;&gt;FULL primer application, another full sanding, plus a final skimming of 
&gt;
&gt;Uh, I disagree.  Only stripif you really have to, and are prepared to
&gt;handle repainting from bare metal.  The sanding and primering are good,
&gt;and throw in a good coat of sealant.

Me too, I meant full stripping of misc pieces, lights bumpers, latches etc, 
not full stripping of paint!!! If you are chasing rust spiders (tracks) 
under the paint, you may end up sanding lots and lots of paint away.  Sorry,
