Subject: carrying canoe on camper top


(Happy Holidays &amp; best Wishes everyone....:-)

As to the matter of the canoe, we have a 17-ft. aluminum canoe that we
carry on a pair of roof racks -- I did not want the westy top in
direct contact w/the canoe. 

The most important thing to do is to tie the front and rear ends of
the canoe down, and tie them so that the tip of the canoe will not
sway sideways (an inverted-V connection).  Once the westy gets moving
the canoe becomes a sail and a wing all rolled in one -- the straps
holding the racks down have to be tight( and the canoe has to be tight
on the racks, too :-)
