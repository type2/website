Subject: type2 list switching servers...


Hi v_at_l people,

As of tonight the aircooled list will be moving to another server. Starting
Monday, if you want to post or cross-post a message to the type2 list,
please use this address:

   type2_at_home.ease.lsoft_dot_com

As of midnight CDT the Primenet address will be obsolete.

Also I'll be moderating messages to the aircooled list posted by
non-subscribers and if you cross-post a message you'll get a receipt back
from the server. This is primarily a spam-control measure. It will
sometimes slow down message propogation, but Primenet was so slow and the
new one is so much faster that I doubt you'll see much difference.

Thanks!

--Ken
