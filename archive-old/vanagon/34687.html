Subject: Soruce for brake lines?

Hi all, 
	I'd like to replace all of the brake lines on my '66 Westy and I 
was curious if anyone knew of a place which sells complete sets of the 
metal brake lines, that would include all of the proper length 
pieces-flared and with fittings, and any T-sections I guess.  I also need 
the rubber lines but those are easier to find.  I've seen these kits for 
beetles but not for busses.
Thanks
-Erik.
