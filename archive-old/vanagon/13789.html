Subject: And the winner is.....
Date: Tue, 21 Mar 95 14:30:54 PST

  And now for the finale of your favorite day time game show &quot;Name those Pesky
  Metal Chips in your Oil&quot;  &lt;drum roll&gt;

  The winner is........BRADLEYM &lt;aka Bardley Prunehead&gt; who successfully 
  speculated that those chips were a bearing insert in the process of breaking
  up.

  After having several of Hewlett Packard's best mechanical engineers examine
  and scratch their heads looking at those chips under a microscope, we 
  decided to touch one with a hot soldering iron. It melted instantly and is
  therefore NOT aluminum but an alloy of lead or tin or indium - bearing 
  insert material. 

  Sounds like you should erase from your memory advice I have ever given 
  concerning motor oil, engine lubrication, etc., etc....


  The question is now &quot;what to do&quot;? I was looking through the Rocky Mountain
  Motorworks catalog and it looks to me like it is cheaper to buy a GEX
  rebuilt than it is to buy all the parts to do it yourself &lt;?!&gt; Why is this?
  If the bus body is leaking under the windshield &lt;rust&gt;, is it worth putting
  a kilobuck or more into the engine?


  Thanks for listening and we now return you to &quot;Days of our Medical Center&quot;

  Dave
