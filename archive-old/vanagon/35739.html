Subject: Car Top Tent, slim VW content

Vanatics,

I saw a new camping product recently that looks intriguing.  It's called the
Car Top Tent, and I read an article about it in &quot;Four Wheel Drive &amp; Sport
Utility&quot; magazine.  It is basically a folding tent that fastens to roof racks
on the top of a car (or Vanagon!).  It consists of a pair of platforms that
are hinged together and a tent in between.  Then traveling (or in storage)
the platforms are folded together and the tent is collapsed between them.  It
measures 48&quot; x 60&quot; x estimated 10&quot; thick in this state.  When you want to set
up for the nite and use the tent, you remove the travel cover and swing the
top platform up and over with its attached ladder.  The ladder extends down
to meet the ground and hold up the platform that you've just folded out.  The
unfolding process automatically sets up the tent and you're ready to climb
in.

It appears (from the pictures &amp; descriptions) to be very high quality and
design, however I haven't seen one in preson yet.  It includes a 2&quot; foam
mattress that is larger than queen size - I forget the dimensions.  The
weight is 69 lbs.  It can hold up to 400 lbs - depending on your vehicle &amp;
roof racks.  The roof rack is NOT included.

I called the company about it and they quoted me prices over the phone and
sent me a brochure.  The &quot;regular&quot; price seems pretty steep, but they're
having a winter sale through February that makes the price almost reasonable.
 Here's what they quoted me:

Regular price:  $699.
Sale price: $399.
Optional ladder A-frame extension for tall vehicles:  $64.
Shipping from Phoenixville, PA: $81.

I'm not certain of the A-frame &amp; shipping prices, but they're close.
I think all VW Type II will need the A-frame option.

I really like the idea of having the tent-on-top.  Just the ticket for us
non-Westys!  Right now I'm searching for ways to afford/justify the purchase.

If you're interested you can call them at (800) CAR TOP1.

Has anyone else seen or used one of these, I'd be anxious to here more about
it from someone who has.

Usual disclaimers, no financial interest...
