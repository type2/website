Subject: Re: solar showers

How about LINING the luggage rack with an insulating type dark
rubber like material, then putting a black 10 gallon rubbermaid
tub on it, then filling it very full, and then floating on the
top of it, one of those clear plastic bubble-type things people
use to solar heat (and keep the heat in) their swimming pools?

Then to let the water come down either via gravity (siphon if
needed), pump (DC or non-car battery)?  I'm tall, so it
wouldn't have to flow down very far.....
