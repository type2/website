Hi all,

I believe my Idle Control Stabilizer was intermittently sticking, causing low
RPM/no idle, particularly when cold.  I can usually hop in the side sliding
door, turn the key and it starts and idles right around 800-900rpm.  No need to
step on the gas or anything (though I do recommend making sure the the van is in
neutral first :-&gt;).  When it's stuck it might start to fire up but then stop
running almost immediately.  To get it to run at all I have to keep a toe on the
gas.  One time the idle stuck around 1200-1500 but that wasn't the normal
symptom.

Thanks to the replies from those on the list, I sprayed some carb cleaner
through the valve after removing the air hose that goes to the air flow meter. 
Did it while the motor was running and noticed that I had to put my thumb over
the hose from the air box so the motor wouldn't stall.  Haven't put any
lubrication in there (yet) as I drive on a dirt road regularly and didn't really
want to add any dirt adhesive to the inside of my valve...(g)  So far so good!
