hey now,

okay next big project is to totally remodel the interior of my 74 van. i've got
a potential source for the parts i want but it's sorta promised to someone who
is trying to come up with the cash.

this is what a want:

rear cabinets for both sides
mosquito netting for sliding and rear doors.
standard fold out bed
seat for behind drivers seat
ice box/sink
all the other cabinets that come standard
flooring would be cool too
front seats would be added plus

anywhere in nc, sc, va would be great...i'll travel!if my source comes through
in raleigh he wants $250 for all...and i've seen it...it's all in excellent
shape....*dr00l*
