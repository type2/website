&gt; HI Everyone.  Yesterday, when I was at my local dealer, I found out
&gt; about the R-12 to R-134A freon upgrade kit that VW will be making
&gt; available ... even for the Vanagon.
&gt; 
&gt; The kit consists of the followiing (all prices in CDN $$$)
&gt; 
&gt; freon (R-134A)  $75
&gt; labour (3 hours _at_ $79/hr)  $237
&gt; adapter kit  approx. $175
&gt; 
&gt; The adapter kit will consist of a new receiver/dryer and various new
&gt; seals that have to be changed at every hose joint, etc.  VW  hasn't
&gt; set the price yet, but my dealer has just trained 3 mechanics to do
&gt; this conversion work, and hopes to make this available by
&gt; the end of May/97.
&gt; 
&gt; Now, he did warn me by saying that R-134A is no where near as
&gt; efficient as R-12 systems in cooling.  Can anyone vouch for that?

I was also thinking of also converting to R-134A,but after talking to an
owner of an auto A/C repair shop I decided not to do it.  He said that
the conversions were going very well, but that R-134A was not as
efficient and that new R-134A systems from the factory use bigger
compressors and larger condensors in front of the radiator to provide
the same amount of 'cool' as compared to R-12 systems.  He was not sure
if the large interior of the Vanagon would be cooled enough with R-134A.
We do live in the desert of So. Cal. where 110 degrees in the summer is
normal. The price for R-134A was also the same as R12 last summer.  So
the only benefit is to the ozone layer.  IMHO not much of an 'upgrade'.
