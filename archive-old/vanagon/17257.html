Subject: Directional Signals

Has anyone had a problem with the front turn signal(amber) housings 
filling with water after a heavy rain?  Ours has filled on several 
occasions causing corrosion of the wires and damage to the bulb socket.  
Does anyone know if a good after market gasket is made to fill in the 
small space between the body and the lamp housing?  Thanks!
