&gt;&gt; We have a 1991 Vanagon Westfalia and I've noticed that I have
&gt;&gt; to replenish the engine coolant (yes I am using the proper kind)
&gt;&gt; more often than on any other vehicle we have owned (maybe every 3
&gt;&gt; fill-ups).
&gt;&gt; Is this a warning flag of any kind or is it just a characteristic
&gt;&gt; of the van?
&gt;&gt; Any help or advice would be most welcome.
&gt;
&gt;Hate to suggest it, but if the coolant is not leaking out anywhere, it
&gt;could be a symptom of a slow head-gasket leak.  I'm sure others on
&gt;the list will have more to say about that.  Does the engine run a little
&gt;rough when you first start it up?
&gt;

OK, you've got me now.  I have been experiencing the same disappearing
coolant but have not found evidence externally that it's leaking.  Is there
any definite way of knowing for sure about the slow head-gasket leak?  Our
Westy doesn't seem to idle porrly at startup.

I was hoping that this was due to us storing it last (93) Christmas season.
We supposedly had the coolant system flushed but found out later that they
simply recycled the old coolant before we put it to rest...so to speak.
last spring it was common to see the coolant light blinking steadily and a
couple of times it was due to low level.  Our heat would disappear at
redlights quickly even though the engine was hot and coolant was full. With
the help of a good machanic here we force fed it about 3 more litres of
blue fluid recently and our heat came back and light has been out
since...but our expansion tank is low again.  Could there have been a big
air-bubble in the system since it is so large from the goofs that did the
original flush?  I have looked high and low for leaks and I guess am hoping
its not the heads...at least not yet!  TIA for any advise, Bruce
