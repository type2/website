&gt; I did find that the information at the store was
&gt; contradictory. The listing for the later Vanagons didn't show
&gt; and plugs. However, when I cross referenced with the Porsche
&gt; I found that there was a platinum plug.

I too, found that K-mart had the wrong listing for spark plugs on my
73 bus.  I bought a set on the way back from Pfeiffer (in Santa Barbara)
because I thought the bus was running a little rough.  Went to put them
in and they didn't fit my wires.  They didn't have the threaded posts
at the top, but rather were solid.
