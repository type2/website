 &gt; RUN don't walk out of that place and go to MAACO instead.  One day took
 &gt; ELEVEN days to paint my car, and did a lousy job.  This was the one in
 &gt; Kearny Mesa, San Diego area.  IMO Maaco is much better for about the
 &gt; same price.  Had the same car painted at MAACO and it was done fast,
 &gt; well, and has lasted a couple of years now and still looks good. 

Add me as a happy MAACO customer.  I took a car there to get an inexpensive 
&quot;stop rusting&quot; paint job, and was pretty happy with the result.   I stripped 
ecternal hardware: wipers, door handles, bumpers, lights, etc. so that yhey 
would not be masked; for $600 MAACO won't pull parts, though they do mask 
tight.

Do inspect the finished job and don't accept the car if it's not satisfactory. 
 My hood had had some dust settle on it while still wet and they sanded it out 
and resprayed the whole panel for no extra charge.
