Subject: SPLIT WINDOW T-SHIRTS also available

 Howdy there. as an additional fund-raiser, I am also doing a completely
separate printing of shirts with a split window design. It will be a blue
t-shirt, with a red and white split window front view on the shirt. (This is
the same split window picture that is on the list shirts, only larger). There
will be no words, or mention of the list, as I am hoping to sell these at VW
shows this summer to the general public.
  These shirts are available in the same manner as the list shirts.

Pricing information:
 shirts are $16.00, which includes postage and handling
 XXL shirts cost $2.00 extra
 Non-USA orders please add $5.00 for foreign postage

To order, send a check to:
 Richard Palmer
121-C Park Ave
Raleigh, NC
27605-1832
(Non-USA orders, please send US cash)

IMPORTANT:
 send an index card with your name, address, e-mail address, size of shirt, and
very importantly, write &quot;Split Window Shirt&quot; on the card, otherwise you will
get the list shirt.
ORDERS MUST BE IN BY FRIDAY, APRIL 26!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Anyway, If anyone wants one of these, they should be very festive as well.
Enjoy!!!!
