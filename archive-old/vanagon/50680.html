Subject: O2 Sensor Question?

I have an 84 Westy and it is idling rough after warming up.  I suspect the
O2 sensor because I warmed the vehicle about 20 minutes and then
disconnected the 02 sensor and there was no change in engine idle.  My
question is &quot;Is this a valid indicator of 02 failure?&quot;  If not are there
any tests?  Also where is a good source for replacements?  Thanks.
