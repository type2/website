Subject:      RE: extra gas (donut tank)

i thought it was Imparts that had this thing, but it turns out to be
Girot's Garage. here's the poop:

Girot's Garage, Inc.
3500-A  20th Street E.
Tacoma, WA 98242-1728
(800) 345-5789
(206) 922-7500 FAX
...................... From their catalog:
&quot;SPARE TIRE GAS TANK
Offered as a standard accessory to Mercedes Benz in Europe for years,
this 6-liter (1.5 gallon) reserve gas can fits in the spare wheel hollow
on 14&quot; or larger rims. Saves space while being safely stowed where it has
maximum protection from impact. I have one in my wife's car so she
doesn't have to deal with freeway lunatics should she ever run out of
gas. Positive-locking cap eliminates leaky, stubborn and potentially
rusted screw type caps. Fits most applications.  12-3/8&quot; in diameter.
Made in Germany.

Item No. 92118 Spare Tire Gas Tank ....... $79.95&quot;

the donut tank comes with a flexible metal pouring spout that, when not
in use, attaches to the end/edge of the tank.

also of possible interest:
&quot;Quality German &quot;Jerricans&quot; (Gas Cans)
While traveling across the desert sands, in dire search of far off lands,
jerricans strapped to the Jeep were few, my desination, Timbuktu. You
don't have to trek across the Sahara Desert to understand the benefits
of these gas cans. Just think of the last time you were trying to get the
screw top off a &quot;typical&quot; steel gas can with a hammer! Try doing it after
corrosion has set in! This jerrican has an easy flip up lid that opens
quickly without fuss. The vented fuel spout attaches the same way without
any fuel leakage or spillage. Special anti-corrosion coating inside
provides lifetime protection against chemicals and gasoline.
Comes in 20-liter and 10-liter steel cans. The very best in fuel storage
for going to Timbuktu or just filling up the 'ol lawn mower.

Item No. 92310  10-liter (2.64 gallons) Jerrican ....... $79.95
         92312  20-liter (5.28 gallons) Jerrican ....... $84.95&quot;

both of these are pictured with the flexible metal pouring spout (that
stores on the handle of the tanks).

i've got the little donut can and kinda like it. :)
