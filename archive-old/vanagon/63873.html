Subject: Re: vacuum gauge installation.

Hi,

errr, wasn't me who posted on gauges, 'twas Colin Moran.  

Anyhow, the T near the booster sounds good, BUT the one-way valve is in
the engine bay, so I suspect the vac 'signal' would not fluctuate much!!
:)

  Go to your favorite scrap yard, open the trunk of any Audi and pull
out the green vac line they use for the door locks.  Each car gets you
2x 4' lengths and rubber hose to connect with. 2 cars should do it! Pull
like hell, it'll come. Just tie-wrap to undersides, bring it up inside
fan 'well' above spare and next to heater hoses. Big rubber grommet
right there waiting.  Must do this, then I can watch my valves dying in
real time!  bye, Tim
