Subject: How to Replace Tach Light??

Simple problem, looks like a difficult answer. The light on my Tach went 
out and my '86 Owner's manual tells me how to replace almost every other 
light on the vehicle EXCEPT the instrument lights. 
It would SEEM tobe simple, but... is it? 
and if so, how?
Thanks, Jack

PS Happy Birthday Gerry - Gee I wish I was only 34 again! :-)
