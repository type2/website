Subject: need Wesphalia info

I'm new to this listserv. I'm going to be in a position to purchase a Class 
B motorhome (is that word allowed?) in a few months. I've always been 
interested in VW. I've had 4 myself. 

I'm curious to learn about whether the 2nd generation air cooled Westphalia 
of the 80s is a better investment used than a newer 5cyl 3rd generation 
Wesphalia.

What about syncro?. I live in one of the coldest (during winter) regions of 
the great white north. Diesel or gas?

All construcitve comments and opinions are appreciated.
