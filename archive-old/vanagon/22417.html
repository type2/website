Subject: Wrong coolant type in 84 Vanagon


Hi everyone,

I am a new list member and recently got an 84 Vanagon.  I have a 
coolant problem and hope you can help.

A month ago before taking the van for a 2 weeks vacation, I had a VW
dealer did a cooling system flush and add coolant.  Everything works
normal until last Sunday: The engine is overheated.  Today they checked
and said the water pump needs to be replaced.  The cost is $90 for the
pump, $183 for labor and $15 for coolant.  I left the van at the 
dealer and would let them know tomorrow.

I found out that the coolant they put in last month (ZVW237104, comes 
in 4L jug by VW) is not the correct type which is ZVW237102 (comes in 
1.5L bottle) and also they now know that too.

The question I have is:

    Can the wrong coolant type do any damages to the water pump and 
    other parts of the cooling system?  I do not know much about these
    2 types but would think the ZVW237102 is for aluminum block.  The
    cooling system seemed fine even before I had it changed.

Thanks in advance for your advices.

Regards,

Hong
