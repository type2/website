Subject: Pillow Talk

a question was posed on keeping the bunk pillows in place...

i had a similar problem.  in addition, being rather large of stature (and
expanding girth :( ) i needed more length.  so i cut a piece of plywood
that would just cover 1/2 the width of the birth opening.  on the front
edge it rests on the metal surround and on the back edge i unsnap 2 or 3
snaps for the cushion and it rests in on the bunk a few inches, the foam
cushion resting on top of it.  this isn't weight bearing but i can place my
entire pillow on the plywood and get a few inches extra room.  i also
covered the plywood with a piece of closed cell foam (double face carpet
tape secured it) to make it comfy.

this was all done in my pre-children era.  now i stick the 5 and 7 year
olds up there and me and Mama sleep down below.  new problem.  kids falling
out of bed.  i constructed a net made from a pickup tailgate net.  i
mounted it permanently on one side and used snap buckles for the other so
it is easy to put up and down.  works well, and gee-- the kids can't come
down once it is up.. &quot;Whup! The net is up guys, gotta stay up there until
morning!&quot;  actually, they like the security of the net and the feeling of
'separation' from the grownups.

sleeping down below, i need to face the rear gate and hang my feet over the
edge of the bed.  very comfortable and feels like just like at home :)
