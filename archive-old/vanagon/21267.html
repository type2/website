  I concurr with the Schwarzemeister that there is little, if any, economic
  incentive to do the rebuild oneself as opposed to buying a long block. One
  point that should be added is that many of the rebuilt long blocks come
  with a warranty. If you're a good rebuilder, this wouldn't matter. Those
  of us with lesser abilities......

  For comparison purposes, my rebuild also cost about $1100. $890 went for
  the long block and the rest was clutch parts, fuel pump, seals and 
  ignition parts.
