Subject: Tail Light ID

I picked up 3 sets of new tail lights (lenses) that are for a '73 and newer 
Beetle or a Thing.  I understand that the '73-'74 Beetle lenses are 
different from the '75-'79 and the Thing lenses are different yet.  
Anyone know the numbers?  The ones I have are as follows:

Hella              | Hell(of)a Big Tail Light
THK 38             | ?
SAE STIAP 1R 71    | ?
DOT                | Dept. o' Transportation
L (or R)           | Left (or right)
Hencho en Mexico   | Made in Mexico (for a Thing, maybe?)

I don't have a late model Beetle or a Thing handy, so could somebody take 
a look at theirs for a comparison.  I don't need these and someone else 
might, but since I don't know what I have to offer ...  TIA. :-)
