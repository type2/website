Subject: Corvair &quot;Story&quot; 

When I was a school bus driver in Palo Alto in the late 70's I lived up
off Skyline Blvd in Skylonda.  My bus &quot;was broken&quot; and while I got a ride
down the hill to work in the morning, I had to hitchike home.  One day I
got a ride from a Corvair.  Coming up to Alameda de Las Pulgas on the road
out of the STanford Shopping Center the driver noticed the light was green
and no traffic was in front of us.  He punched it and we hit the
intersection going about 35.  Just as we came up a fairly new Plymouth
Fury leapt in front of us totally oblivious and the driver of the Corvair
slammed on the brakes.  I had time to brace myself against the dash and he
slammed into the Fury. No one was hurt.  What was amazing was the
Corvair's front end was bashed in abut 18&quot; but the side of the Fury had
only a minor dent.  The paint was hardly scratched.  Nuff said...
