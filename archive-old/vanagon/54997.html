Subject: Fast German Auto

Just noticed these guys now have an excellent web page at

www.fastgermanauto_dot_com

Somebody should really check these people out, they beat the pants 
off AVP or Stephens, can you say $1099 for the A/C vanagon 2.0 with 
NEW heads, P/C, lifters, bearings, etc.  Or can you say $750 with 
rebuilt heads with strengthened seats!!!  Or $1600 for a wasserboxer 
again with NEW heads.  Seems incredible to me, probably too good to 
be true, would be nice for one of our CA people near Santa Ana to go 
on by and give it a look-see.  Anyway just noticed it, maybe I'll buy 
some internals from them for the '78.
