&gt;buy or build a 6V to 12V converter. I don't know where you can buy one but 
&gt;building one yourself is not impossible.
&gt;
&gt;Do you know how much current (or the wattage) the fridge eats under 12V? The 
&gt;switching power transistors need to switch at twice of that amont since they
&gt;are switching at 6V. 

It takes 5.4A at 12V
