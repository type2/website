Subject: '66 bus w/ flickering oil light


First, the vital info.  I recently performed a rebuild (my first) on my '66 
Westphalia (stock 1600 single-port, Pict-30, 009, oil cooler mounted 
on outside of fan shroud, towards the front [front is front], and an 
external oil filter).  It has less than 100 miles on it.  
A bad thing happened to me today, and while I have been keeping up with 
the thread on hot oil I would like some specific suggestions for my 
predicament, if possible.

I was driving from Austin to San Antonio this morning, for the first 
extended trip on the new rebuild.  It was cloudy and 75F.  Humming along 
at 55mph, about 10 miles into the trip, and the oil light begins to 
flicker.  I pull over, and let it cool.  Plenty of oil.  No bad noises.  
I decide to limp it back to Austin on the access road.  The oil light 
stays out--unless the engine is at high rpms in third or fourth.  I 
quickly figure to drive slowly, and the light stays out.  Hmmm.  Now 
she sits in my driveway, awaiting my attention.  

This is the first time this problem has occured.  During short trips to 
get the bus inspected, and to a friends to pick up my rear bumper, I have 
had no worries.  She runs well, and I was just starting to feel proud of 
myself.  I don't get it.  No oil light unless a sustained load is placed 
on the engine, then &quot;flicker.&quot;

Question one-- I am concerned that I do not have an air-flow thermostat.  
When I rebuilt the engine there was *no* control assembly for the air 
flaps to remove. I did not consider putting one on. I have read the 
posts on where it should be, and what it looks like, and its important 
role in keeping the engine cool.  This could be a likely culprit, huh?

Question two-- *If* this is indeed the problem, what is your opinion 
concerning removing the shroud and simply *scrapping* the whole air 
control flap assembly?  Remember, I am currently in Texas--there is not 
much of a cold-start problem here.

Question three-- Apparently, the carb and timing settings are crucial in 
helping keep the engine cool. I would just about bet my ass that I have 
the carb and timing set properly.  Just to make sure, though, let me tell 
you that I have the timing set at 7.5 BTDC, and it seems to run fine--no 
pinging, smooth acceleration.  Your insight?

Thanks for the help.  I am cross-posting this on the vanagon list, and 
rec.autos.vw.
