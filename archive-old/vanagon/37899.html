Subject: bodywork idea????

A friend of mine I was talking to had a neat idea for popping out &quot;dents&quot;
on the nose of a bus.

He said that he uses an old basketball on the inside of the bus (where the
dent is) and then _slowly_ inflates it. This pressure of the basket ball
inflating supposedly pops the dent out very effectively. this works well
(he claims) because there is the force is dispersed over as broad an area
as is possible and allows the bump or dent to &quot;pop out&quot; with minor damage
to the metal.

 Has anyone heard of this procedure or have any comments on it? The
procedure is supposed to work really well on tight areas that are difficult
to get at w/ conventional bodywork tools.

Thoughts or input welcomed.

Michael
