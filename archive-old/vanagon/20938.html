Could it be that your back end is too low?  My '70 Kombi (camper 
interior) used to ride a little low in the back.  I had planned to have 
the rear torsion bars adjusted to remove the slight sag.  However, this 
weekend I replaced the shocks (front/back) with new heavy-duty KYB's, 
and now the sag is mostly gone.  Rides a lot better and I can see a good 
distance behind me.  

However, the question of needing to have the rear torsions adjusted, 
say when the shocks settle in, still nags me.  Any input from VW-land on 
this most vexing issue?
