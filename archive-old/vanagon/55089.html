Subject: '54 Progress, and Tech Writer Position
Date: Mon, 27 Jan 1997 15:41:43 -0800 (PST)
From: &quot;Turbo&quot; &lt;thom_at_calweb_dot_com&gt;

I worked some more on the '54, starting to rip up the cargo floor
and put the new cross-members underneath.   I have decided to re-do
the pieces I fabb'd in the front end, having access to an original
section, so I'll be re-doing that.  A lot of work, but it will
end up looking much better.

On the other hand, looks like we'll be having a Tech Writer position
open, as ours just gave notice...  Contact me offline if interested.
Its in Elk Grove, California, 10 minutes south of Sacramento.
