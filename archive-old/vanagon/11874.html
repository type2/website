Ok, I have spent a small fortune getting my toolbox in order and am 
down to a few more essentials.  One of these would be a torque wrench.
Sears has a couple of nice models, or so I think.  One model is about 
$60, is called &quot;microtork&quot; and has the release type setting.  It is 
accurate to within 4%.  The other one is also at Sears.  They call it 
&quot;digitork&quot;.  It is about $90, has a ball release system that claims to
be more durable or accurate.  It is accurate to within 3%, needs 
adjustment less often, etc.  Both are 1/2&quot; drive.  The more expensive 
one has a nicer finish and a slimmer head design.  I am not afraid to 
spend the money (there is little hope of looking back now) on the 
nicer one, unless it would be a huge waste.  So, what do you all use 
and what do you recommend?  Is there some other I should be 
considering?  Thanks, Jim

PS  Sorry to hear about your bug Ric.  Bummer of a way to go.
