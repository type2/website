Subject: Re: bus boys non 800 number

To Joe and the rest of the list -

Our local number is 916-244-1616.  But beware - it's just as jammed up as the
800 line.  Mondays and Thurdays are the worst days to call in.  The moment
Bill or I hang up one line it rings within seconds.

Recommendation -  FAX (916-244-0933) your inquiries, orders, etc..  When Bill
and I are on the phone we are usually at the same time workin' on someone's
FAX request.  Now if either one of us starts to chew bubble gum at the same
time.....well the whole situation crashes :-).

I answer the E-Mail at home from 6AM to about 10AM Pacific.  Then I go in to
give Bill a hand (he's been there since about 7:30AM).  We each take about 15
minutes to grab a bite at the local choke and puke.  Bill's outa there at
about 6:30PM, but I'm usually there until as late as 10:30PM (tonight I got
out of there at about 8:30PM).  I usually spend the rest of the evening
answering E-Mail that came in during the day as well as doing the rest of the
paperwork (Payroll's tonite).  Figure I'll be in the sack by 1:30AM. BTW, it
was 105 today in Redding and we have no AC, just fans.

Isn't life fun?   :-)
