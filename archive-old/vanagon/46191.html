Subject: '91 pricing advice needed

Dear Vanagon folks,
My name is Susan and I signed on to this list in order to ask for some
advice.  After reading your postings for a couple of days, I'm convinced
that this is the right place to come--you guys really know your stuff.  I'm
impressed with the amount of knowledge represented here, especially
considering that I personally am seriously, well...automotively challenged.
Anyway, I'm throwing myself on your collective mercy and I hope you don't
mind giving me the benefit of your wisdom.

A casualty of divorce, my 1991 Vanagon Carat has got to go, I've just about
decided.  My son is 16 and just learning to drive, and finds a manual
transmission/van combination completely daunting to contemplate learning
on; also, not being car-literate I'm afraid that I need to get something
newer and under warranty (I'm thinking about a Jetta, BTW).  In addition,
money is now tighter, post-divorce, and something with a little more fuel
economy is also desirable.   I love my van, but I don't really need that
much room anymore, and this seems to be my best option.

So, my question is this: if I trade it in or sell it outright, how much can
I expect to get for it?  I don't even know ballpark here, I'm that
clueless.  I know there are all sorts of variables, but I don't even know
what they are.  It has 101,000 miles on it, has never been in an accident,
runs great.  It has power windows/locks/mirrors, and cruise control.  The
AC doesn't work right now, and it would have cost me $130 that I don't have
to find out why, so I don't use it.  There is some kind of slow coolant
leak that the VW Service Dept. says I can leave alone for a while, but will
eventually have to be fixed.  Other than that, the driver's window motor is
broken (window is closed), but that's about it for the negatives.

See, I told you I was clueless.  I would greatly appreciate any advice you
all may have, and if there is info I haven't included, ask, but be gentle,
and remember not to get too technical ;-).

Thanks so much.

Susan in San Antonio
