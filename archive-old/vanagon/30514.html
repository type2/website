&gt; Hi all, 
&gt; 	I just have a kooky question which came to me the other day while 
&gt; going to sleep in my bus.  Which way does everyone sleep?  Personally, I 
&gt; sleep with my head to the rear but I have to be careful not to hit my 
&gt; head on the shelf.  That's when I wondered if anyone else slept the other 
&gt; way and why.  This is assuming you'd be sleeping in the lower level 
&gt; (downstairs) of course.  Actually, now I'm curious about the upper level 
&gt; as well.  Well???

I sleep head toward the front, downstairs.  I am too tall to sleep any
other way.  By sleeping head forward I can take advantage of the extra
space on the driver's side that I get from my three seat bench/bed.  (I
have no galley to take up valuable sleeping room)
