Subject: RE: Hi all

Chris Schalick asks about bigger engines that would &quot;plug right in&quot; to his
69 Type II.  Probably no two of us would agree what &quot;plug right in&quot; means in
this context.  Neoclassical approach is probably 1835 cc with dual carbs.
American V8 will fit also.  Just depends on where you want to be on the spec-
trum from usable transportation appliance to entertaining, educational project.
Lots of people on the list can probably make useful suggestions to you, Chris,
once we know how many big red tool cabinets you have in your garage.
