&gt;Saw your note----
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Of course I've got a million questions to ask the group but I'll
&gt;&gt;try and dribble them out slowly over time so you all don't get sick
&gt;&gt;of my whining.  The guys here at the Volks Cafe will get paid to
&gt;&gt;answer the obvious questions, so maybe I can reserve the stumpers
&gt;&gt;for the group. (One I gotta ask now: is there a consensus that this
&gt;&gt;ALUMASEAL stuff is bad, and if so, is there any way to flush the
&gt;&gt;extra gunk back out of a micro-clogged radiator?)
&gt;
&gt;  My 86 Vanagon GL developed a tiny head leak 2 years ago.  I talked with
my local mechanic, he called a dealer mechanic, then decided he didn't want
to get into messing with the heads.  He also recommended trying a very small
amount of a stop leak product before doing anything else.  I put a tiny
pinch of Alumaseal (literally the amount I could get between my thumb and
forefinger) in and the leak has not recurred for two years, nor have I
noticed other problems...overheating or the like.  So I guess my experience
is it seems OK--at least in very small quantities for very small leaks.  Of
course maybe it has created something I don't know about yet.
&gt; 
&gt;Would be very interested in anything you get on the Alumaseal question.
