Halloooo one and all,

I've been enjoying reading this list for a short while now and now have my
very own problem with my Kombi ('73).
When I bought it, all seemed fine, but to check I had my local garage check it
out and once again all was well(ish). There was a leak in an elbow shaped hose which
seemingly is part of a pipe which joins one manifold to the other at the back
of her engine compartment. This produced a little rough running. It was at this
time Kombi went back for a tappets adjustment and once again came back seeming
OK. Soon after, however, whilst driving up hill the engine was losing power, and
smoke (bluish) had started coming out of the exhaust pipe :( The garage have
now said they had put wrong plugs in (too short I think) and almost said they
messed up the tappet settings. They are not very forthcoming with information about
what is wrong. Like where the smoke originates. Like why the power loss. Like
why there is no smoke when the engine is first switched on, but appears after about
30-60 seconds of revving.
I am at a bit of a loss and shall extract my Kombi from said garage as soon as they
fix said damage (at their own cost)
Anyone out there know, guess, make up what has happened. 
'CAUSE I WANT MY KOMBI BACK :(

Cheers
Carl
('73 Kombi)
