Subject: Head Cap Nuts - part II

More clarification was asked of this 'torque to hold' thang and associated
observations....

speaking specifically for the wasserboxer, when you are tightening down the
cap nuts you will notice that they continue to turn even when the final
torque is reached on the wrench gauge.  as previously mentioned, things are
squishing down, stretching, compressing, and otherwise threatening to ruin
your day.  this is normal and, IMHO, essential to obtaining satisfactory
sealing in a wasserboxer head gasket.  once everything gets scrunched
together, the nut stops turning.

NOW.  when you release the torque on the wrench, the nut *WILL* spring back
maybe an 1/8 to 3/16 of a turn.  this is due to the torsion of the stud
unwinding against a low friction surface  created by the slippery sealant
under the smooth flange of the cap nut.  it is unavoidable and will not hurt
the final torque.  but it is essential that the nut have time to compress
everything while full torque is being applied.

liken it to the young bull running down the hill to carouse with a heifer
vs. the old bull walking down and carousing with them all.... take your time
and be thorough.
