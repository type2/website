&gt; Also, I saw a solar panel attached to the top of a vanagon the 
&gt; other day.  Would this be used for battery charging or maybe just
&gt; aux power for toys?  Any thoughts on uses, $$$ for solar panels?

Jade Mountain  http://www.jademountain_dot_com/pvpkg.html  in Boulder has
solar supplies for boats and RVs in different configurations. They can
also whip up a custom arrangement, and are very nice to deal with.
