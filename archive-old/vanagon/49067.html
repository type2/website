Subject: LOCK-RIGHT locking diffs

Anybody have experiece with these?  Seems like we may have discussed
them before but the darn search part of the archives seems to be down.
The '81 came with an interesting brochure from Weddle Engineering,
Long Beach, CA.  And the LOCK-RIGHT brochure was in it, frankly the
literature makes this thing seem like the best thing since sliced
bread.  Exotic claims like

installation in 1-2 hours without resetting backlash
smooth operation without harsh noisy action
100% locking as necessary with full differentiation on turns

etc. etc.
Now the picture shows some stuff I can't fully comprehend, I assume
this to be some sort of friction clutch mechanism, but not like the
factory multi-disc clutch unit, nor like modern Torsen or Quaife geared
units.  Anyway the real glory is a price tag of only $264 (as of last
years catalog) so since the '81 is going to get dissasembled once more
to change engine mounts and the bell-housing (failing from
stress/chemical corrosion combination of the magnesium alloy), I'm
really thinking that this might be damn neat for winter.  I note I hope
to get the bell-housing from them, they list used for $30.  The regular
brochure is chock full of all kinds of neat T2 transaxle components,
including full rebuilt 5 spds with your choice of ratios for a mere
$1995 ooooof. But the prices on used stuff are genuinely incredible, and
new late deep rib housings for under $100, diesel bell housings $35,
etc. etc.  I strongly rec picking up a brochure I'm calling tomorrow for
more up to date info.  They are also available for most any import or
domestic 4wd by the looks of it, all priced in $200-$400 range.
