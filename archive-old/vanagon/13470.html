Subject: Re: Cut off Jets

&gt;Just had my van back from the shop after a tune up (82 air 
cooled,2litr,twim carb)
&gt;It seems that one of my elecromagnetic cut-off jets is not working. Muir says
&gt;they are a waste of time and can be replaced by a screw in jet.

These stop the engine running on when you switch off the ignition by cutting 
the fuel to the idle jets. Does it idle OK? Do they click when you switch 
the ignition on? If so, then just leave them as they are. If they are like 
the ones on earlier carbs, there is a screw on the end of the solenoid that 
you can adjust. If the cut-out packs up you can just wind it all the way in 
(or out?) until fuel flows and the engine idles properly. You may get 
running on, but it works as a temporary fix.
