&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; This may be illegal!!  But the easiest way to do it is to get a British
&gt; listy to send you a bottle of the yellow headlight lacquer that is used
&gt; when on holiday in France.  Yellow main beams are mandatory there.  I've
&gt; used it often.  Stuff paints on easily, cleans off with methyl-alcohol.
&gt; Easiest/cheapest way to go. Maybe you can find similar at good artists
&gt; supply store?  Yellow beams are way way better in fog/snow.
&gt; 
&gt; bye, Tim

This sounds good, Tim, if actual yellow glass lenses can't be had.
Besides, I could always tell the state police I was on my way to France!
