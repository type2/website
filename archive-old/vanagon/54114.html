&gt; Subject: Fuel Tank Overflow Hoses
&gt; 
&gt; The recent discussion on &quot;gas mileage&quot; prompted me to pose the folowing:
&gt; 
&gt; Shortly after purchasing my '80 Westy in '88, I filled the gas tank and
then
&gt; parked in a sloped parking lot in Northern Vt. When I came out there was
gas
&gt; all over the pavement. Quite conserned as I was in the middle of nowhere
on a
&gt; camping trip - I proceeded with caution and took the Westy directly to my
&gt; service shop upon returning homr (I am not set up to do my own repairs!).
&gt; 
&gt; I was advised that the fuel tank overflow hoses and system had cracked
and
&gt; needed to be replaced - I had two options:
&gt;      - never fill the tank completely
&gt;      - drop the tank and replace the hoses and fittings
&gt; As this was to be a long term relationship - I did the latter at approx
$150

&gt; By late August, the same gas leaking from the overflow hoses appeared!
Dismayed
&gt; I took her in to the quality dealership I had begun to use (my old shop
had 
&gt; developed an attitude against Westy owners saying &quot;most of them don't
want to
&gt; pay what it costs to hae us do the job right - ie they're all cheap! I
don't
&gt; like to deal with bad attitude - it lowers my level of trust!) My new
service
&gt; manager delivered the same news as with my '80. I really couldn't believe
it!
&gt; Was this a problem with Westies in general? He said that they had only
seen a
&gt; few cases - and of course the fact that the Van had been driven so little
&gt; probably did have an effect. I waited till spring - just didn't fill the
tank
&gt; completely - and had the same work done. Surprisingly the dealership
charged
&gt; less in '96 than I had been charged from the smaller local shop back in
'89!
&gt; 
&gt; So - is this a problem that any of you have experienced or heard much
about? If
&gt; so - how can it be avoided? As I am trying to buy yet another '91 Westy I
would
&gt; prefer to avoid having to do this particular service again.
&gt; 
&gt; Thankx
&gt;         Kenyon

Kenyon, 

The leaking system may be caused by a plastic pipe with a two-ported end on
each end of the plastic pipe. The pipe arrangement connects to the gas tank
and to the expansion tanks on either side of the underside of the vehicle.
The &quot;Y&quot; ends are plastic, also, and they dry out and crack with age, I am
told.  The &quot;Y&quot; ends are pressure applied or laminated in some way to the
plastic pipe. They may or may not come out of the ends of the pipe,
according to how deterioriated the &quot;Y&quot; elements are.  So you may have to
buy the whole unit from VW for about $32.00, including grommets for the two
ends each on the &quot;Y&quot; fittings.  If you pull the pipe unit out and you are
able to extricate one of the ends from the pipe, assuming that only one is
broken, I have the pipe and one good &quot;Y&quot; which you may have if you let me
know in a week or so.  I am in Texas on my way to California where my Westy,
, et a, is stored.

For the two &quot;Y&quot; fittings,  and the other hoses under the vehicle, you'll
need at least six or eight stainless steel hose clamps about the size which
would fit around a half inch dowel or a thicker than usual ball point pen.
They're standard stuff at the FLAPS near you. Another desirable element is
the use of a pair of those curved-lip cutters to remove the OEM clips which
are pressed on to the hoses and the &quot;Y&quot; fittings. 

You do not have to remove the gas tank.  However, you do have to remove the
tray which holds up the spare tire and then finesse your way up into the
extremely dirty undersides of the vehicle and on to he top of the gas tank
while you are on your back, if you don't have access to a hoist or a lift.
BRUSH, WIPE OR BLOW DIRT AND DEBRIS  from the grommeted areas to avoid
fouling the gas tank while you are forcing the grommeted &quot;Y&quot; fittings into
the top of the gas tank.  One sterling Listee, whose name I don't remember,
suggested spit as a lubricant.  I suggest that you employ a pair of strong
hands, spit or a graphite lubricant.  Mount the grommets to the &quot;Y&quot; fitting
before you attempt to insert the &quot;Y&quot; fitting into the tank holes.  You
could drop the grommets into the tank, as I recall the procedure. Then coax
the grommeted fittings into the appropriate orifices.  Wear old clothes.
Thin arms and strong hands help, too.

You can approach the &quot;Y&quot; fittings pipe unit through the wheel well on one
side of the vehicle by feeling above the tire and inwards. Experiment by
turning the steering all the way, one side or the other, to determine which
of the expansion tanks you can reach by hand. Reach up there on to the top
of the expansion tank on one or the other side of the vehicle.  I can't
remember which side.  Follow the hoses to the &quot;Y&quot; fittings and muscle the
fittings and the grommets out of and in to the holes on the  top of the gas
tank.

The Archives contain two or three versions of the &quot;Y&quot; saga. Bentley has an
illustration of the gas tank arrangement.  All will be revealed. 

Best regards,

Tom Hanlon
