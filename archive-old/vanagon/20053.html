NO, NOT, NEVER, UH UH, NO HOW, NO WAY  . . . . .!!!!!!!  the volatility of
gasoline is an intrinsic characteristic of the gasoline molecule, and mixing
it with something else (e.g. diesel ) just results in a mixture that has two
separate volatility components.  Sorry to shout but this could be the
difference between having a &quot;bad day&quot; and not.  Those of us with diesels  have
a little statement in the owner's manual about winterizing diesel with the
addition of a small among of gasoline (like 10% or so) and the caution that
the resultant mixture has the flammability/explosive characteristics of
gasoline.  

As to using gasoline as described in the original post - 
1) spraying it as envisioned to clean off engine parts and compartments is an
invitation to a spectacular, early, VERY painful and ugly demise
2)  Talk about air pollution!!  that's why we have sealed fuel systems and
those miserable hoses on gas pumps, to keep gasoline fumes/vapors from
evaporating into the atmosphere.

Please let's stick to safer methods, even if it costs a little more, you might
survive to enjoy the fruits of your efforts.  (GUNK engine cleaner, Simple
Green, or other heavy duty industrial cleaners, just think ahead about where
that stuff drains so that it doesn't  pollute.    (Really, I'm not a raving
eco freak, but some things are just too blatant an abuse.)

I'd like to point out that gasoline is a really good solvent and
sells for a mere $1.259 a gallon (at least it does here in San
Diego). Of course it is a little dangerous. Diesel fuel is a little
less flammable and is priced in the same ballpark.  I wonder if there
is something that could be mixed with gasoline to make it safe while
retaining its solvent properties.
