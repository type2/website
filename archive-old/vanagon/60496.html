------The manual says to center the stop fingers (the u shaped things at
the end of the shifter) between the 3rd and 4th position in the shifter
box, this should give the correct lenght of the rod. Been there done
that. I just do not see how the shifter plate on the inside of the cab
can also be adjusted.

&gt; Tighten the clamp.
&gt; 
&gt; What I see on your failure report, you should
&gt; only turn the rods against each other.
	-you mean shorten the rod?
