Was the window down?  Both my Eurovan and the Vanagon I had, have and had 
respectively, one squeaky hubcap.

&gt; Hello Folks,
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Just got off the road from a drive in my  Vanagon, any excuse to take a ride in 
&gt; it. I noticed a small squeek from somewhere in the dash board.  My other Vanagon 
&gt; made this same noise but to a lesser extent, any ideas out there?
