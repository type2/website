Subject: '77 Bus (with 78 Engine) Clutch pedal doesn't return
Date: Mon, 2 Dec 1996 10:50:26 -0800

I have a 77 Bus with a 78 engine I just had put in 400 miles ago.

I backed out of the driveway, shifted in to first, shifted into second 
and then when I went for third the clutch pedal didn't return all the 
way. 

I checked the clutch cable and besides me putting a kink in it while 
checking it there was nothing wrong with it (except now I have to 
replace it because I kinked it). I adjusted the wing nut and took all 
the slack out of the cable and the pedal still had several inches of 
slop in it. 

I called my mechanic about an alleged spring on the pedal return, and 
there isn't one on a 77. I do have the spring on the arm the clutch 
cable pulls (on the clutch itself).

Does anyone have any ideas on this one?

Thanks,
Patrick
