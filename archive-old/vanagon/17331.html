Subject: Help! Synchro Vibration

I'm about at the end of my driveshaft..and UNDER it too much lately. A year
ago I had a u-joint wear out and after much legwork, found a guy who was able
to replace the joints so I wouldn't have to pay 500+ for the whole new shaft
assembly from VW.

The Synchro's had a slight vibration ever since, but it wasn't too bad until
this spring, at which time I decided to pull it off &amp; have it checked out
more closely. I found another shop that found joints to fit, so I had new
ones put in. The shaft vibrated worse, so I found another shop that could bala
nce the shaft. Now it's a little worse--significant vibration from 30 - 50
mph.  No vibration with driveshaft out, however, but maybe I shouldn't do
that.

I loosen the front drive per the manual when removing/installing the shaft &amp;
I checked the driveline alignment as close as possible using a string running
the length of the vehicle. (Is there a better way?) Everything seems good in
that respect. My dealer told me that the front drive is &quot;bad&quot; because it's
noisy.  I still haven't heard weird noises or felt anything unusual, so I
wanted to take care of some of these other problems before pursuing the front
drive in more detail. Hate spend $ on the front drive if something else is
the problem.

Suggestions? Should I give up and buy a new shaft? Or could the front drive
or something else cause such vehicular vibration even though there's none
with the shaft removed? CV's and bearings seem good (and tight).

Thanks.......Dan
