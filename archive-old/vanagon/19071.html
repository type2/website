This whole story brings back too many not so fond memories of changing the
filters and pump in my '73 Loaf.  I have a Holley &quot;Bugspray&quot; 2-BBL carb that
lets me use rubber fuel line, so no brass fuel line problems.  I also
switched over to an electric fuel pump - a bit noisier than the mechanical,
but it cost me 35 beans and my Bus has never started better!

By the way, I have a fuel filter in the line between the tank and the pump
and another one between the pump and the carb.  Any reasons why I can't do
this?  No driveability problems as of yet!

My neighbors still haven't recovered from the fright of seeing 7-10 gallons
of Sunoco's best pouring down my driveway.  A word to the wise - change your
pump and filters when you're down to fumes in the tank!

One more thing - today was a beautiful day in sunny Western New York (we're
only allotted about 3 or 4 a year between blizzards!) and there were Loafs
EVERYWHERE!  I saw at least 5 or 6 in real nice shape and we all honked and
waved at each other like mad!  Didn't see any Splits, though.  How I love
thee, simple Bus.......

Just my feeble thoughts......
