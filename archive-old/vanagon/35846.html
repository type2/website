In a message dated 96-02-20 12:21:13 EST, you write:

&gt;I shut down and jumped out with my flashlight, thinking the fan belt had
&gt;broken, and checked the rear.  Belt is fine.  Alternator isn't moving
around.
&gt;Battery connections tight and clean.  Everything looks normal, no unusual
&gt;smells.  So I continued home (20+ miles) because I had to...  headlights
&gt;never dimmed; I had to use the wipers a few times 'cause it was *storming*
&gt;out there, but we shut off radio and interior lights.
&gt;
&gt;Next morning (still pouring rain), I checked everything again.  A friend
&gt;checked the battery with a volt etc. meter which showed 12 volts in there.
&gt;Removed the voltage regulator, and he checked that too.  (Pardon me but I am
&gt;completely stupid about things electrical)

When you want to check to see if your charging system is working, check for
voltage at the battery.  It should be holding between 11.9  and 12.5 volts.
 Then start the engine and rev the motor very briefly to about 2000 RPM to
set the alternator to charging, allow the engine to idle and check the
voltage at the battery.  The voltage when running should definitely be higher
than when sitting.   The charging voltage would ideally be 13.8 volts.  The
lowest tolerable charging voltage is 12.8 volts while all electricals are
being used.  Then, Shut the engine off, and check battery voltage at the
exact moment that the starter is in operation.  The voltage should not drop
below 9 volts.  If your voltage is lower than that, completely charge the
battery with a charger.  Do not attempt to diagnose a charging/starting
problem with a low or &quot;iffy&quot; batttery.  It is like beating your head against
a masonry wall.
