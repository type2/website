Subject: '84 westfalia for sale

&quot;Constance&quot;, our 1984 Wasserboxer Vanagon Retro-Westfalia Wolfsburg-type, 
needs a new home--our little camping family has outgrown her.  
She has 150k miles, engine rebuilt at 123k, and a new transmission &amp; clutch 
at 138k.  She's a Utah car with no rust, though the sliding door is dented, 
and she could use a paint job.  There's no sink/stove/fridge unit--we use 
the sink/icebox from a type 2 westie.  The original middle seat slides back 
in &amp; with a fold-down seat in the front she seats eight comfortably.  She 
gets 16-19 mpg.   We've loved her, asking $3995.  Call if you're interested.
