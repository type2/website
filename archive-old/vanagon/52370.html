Subject: Re: Westfalia features!

I've got a Vanagon (90) Westfalia.  I liked the Paulchen rack, but
didn't like the price, so I too the Thule roof off my Honda Civic
hatchback, made a few modifications and mounted it on the back hatch of
the van (so that the bikes are secured by their front forks and &quot;hang&quot;
vertically down the back hatch) and I usually bungee the wheels to this
as well.  My problem is where to put my tandem, since its wheelbase is
so long (about 90 inches, I think).  I have plans to modify this rack
further, but I'm not sure how well it will work.

Anybody out there have a tandem they carry on their Westy or have any
suggestions?  I'll go ahead and say it now, I'm not drilling into my top
to mount bars, and I'm not using tall gutter-mount feet that go over the
top.  Been down that road and don't want to go there again...

&gt; heck,  I have to admit that i didn't know the back seat would prop up
&gt; for easy loading and unloading.  I discovered it while trying to figure
&gt; out where I could put my new Cannondale tandem (I take off the front
&gt; wheel, prop up the back seat, back it in thru the sliding door, put the
&gt; back wheel between the front seats and bungee the handlebars to the
&gt; bottom of the back seat.  it works well, but I gotta figure out a way to
&gt; carry it on the outside...).

&gt; Do you have a Vanagon or a EV? For Vanagon and EV with back DOORS
&gt; there are carriage system on the market on which you can mount
&gt; the spare wheel. Is it that you are looking for?
