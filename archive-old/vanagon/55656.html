Subject: FS: '74 Bus &amp; 90 Jetta / WTB: Diesel Vanagon


Well, after much thought I've come to some decisions regarding a great many 
things.  One of those things is my choice of a vehicle.  I've decided that as 
much as I like my Bus, I don't have the skills necessary to keep it running as a 
daily driver, nor can I continue to justify owning two cars.  I want the 
reliability of my old diesel Rabbit with the road-trip-worthiness of my bus.  
So, here are the specifics:

'90 Jetta GL 4-door
	Auto
	about 125k miles
	made in Germany
	new starter about 1000 miles ago
	have most repair records
	includes service manual
	no radio
	body solid; one rust spot on rear of trunk
	missing a few trim pieces (fender thingies, etc.)
	good tires
	rear brakes &amp; cyls replaced in Nov.
	sunroof
	non-working A/C (probably just needs a charge)
	non-working cruise control (hasn't worked since speedometer replacement)
	no radio (it got stolen twice, and I gave up)

	Registered, titled, and NYS inspected.

	asking $2500/offer
		
	This was my mom's car before I got it.  She used it to commute from 
Andover to Concord (NH) every day.  110,000 of those 125,000 miles are hers, and 
I've had the car for two years.  It's been a family car; it's fairly 
well-maintained, but it's not spotless.  Both of my younger brothers learned to 
drive in it.  Overall, though, it's in nice shape and I'm kinda hesitant to part 
with it, but it's not especially comfortable to sleep in on long trips. :)
	The exhaust is getting noisy, but I'll get that replaced under Midas 
warranty before selling it.  The other issue is that the car has *metric* 
instrumentation.  My speedometer died right around the time my friend's metric 
scirocco got nailed by a u-haul truck; we swapped the instrument clusters and 
rolled the metric one ahead to make it accurate.  It currently reads about 
202,000km.  (If I were going to lie about the mileage, I doubt I'd be saying it 
had 125k. :) )
		
'74 plain-old-Bus

	pancake engine (I don't think it's the original one)
	includes spare engine which runs but has low compression on one cyl.
	dual carbs; includes set of fancy Dellorto carbs (not installed)
	good tires
	body fairly solid; some rust, but nothing terrible
	needs some stuff:
		heater boxes and exhaust
		brake work (has new front pads, but may have a leak somewhere)
		serious tune-up
	includes several spare wheels and tires
	includes large box of various random parts
	115k miles on odo; doesn't seem unrealistic
	
	Title is clear and in my name.  Not currently registered or inspected.
		(Would fail NYS inspection if you took it in today.)
	
	asking $900/offer
	
	Overall I think it's in solid shape.  I drove it all over the northeast 
this summer; Philly, DC, Virginia, etc.  It's nice on the highway, doesn't run 
too hot (our philly trip was in 90+ weather), and gives you that nifty bus 
feeling when you're driving it.  (And no, it wasn't the exhaust fumes!)  I have 
not driven it since late October when I moved my plates/insurance to the Jetta.
	
Note that I would be willing to trade either or both +/- cash for a diesel 
Vanagon or *possibly* a diesel Dasher wagon.  (Although I'm unlikely to give you 
both the Jetta and the bus for a Dasher unless it's in *awfully* good 
condition.)

If anyone is interested in either of my vehicles or in selling a Vanagon or 
Dasher (diesel ONLY), please let me know...

- Tom
