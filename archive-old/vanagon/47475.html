In a message dated 96-07-24 14:04:58 EDT, you write:

&lt;&lt; &gt;In Germany we have to weld some parts like the new support for the
 &gt;front transmission mount and square holes for the engine support, which 
 &gt;altogether allows a 3 cm lowered engine. In this case you have to 
 &gt;raise the decklid by only 4 cm. 
 
 Sounds like a complex problem for Syncros. I don't really want to 
 lower my engine toward those rocks in the road, there are implications
 for the bash rails, etc..  &gt;&gt;
  Hey Tom,
This may not be a problem for Syncros as the engine in a Syncro already sits
about 1.5 to 2  inches lower than in a normal Vanagon.

Dennis.
