Subject: vanagon rear wheel brg. ????
Date: Fri, 26 Aug 1994 06:04:51 -0400 (EDT)

I just got done changing the 4 c-v joints on my Vanagon after hearing some
suble grinding on the way home from my sojourn to Pennsylvania.  So, while
I have the axels off I check the rear wheel bearings by trying to move the
rear wheel and find a bit of looseness in the bearing, is this normal ? 
There is no adjustment on these bearings, right ??  AND, where does one
get a wrench big enough and bodys strong enough to take off that 45mm
axel nut ??? UG!!  Anyway, after changing the c-v joints I don't hear any
more wierd noises.  Should I be concerned with the hub bearings???  Or just
keep on driving until ??  My bus has 139517 km on the clock and sifting
back through the paperwork I got with it I found that this is the 3rd time
the c-v joints are being changed.  Once at 65,000 km under warrenty and then
once again at 84,384 km by a Kingston, Ont. VW dealer for the PO.  Is it
normal for these Vanagons to eat up c-v joints at this rate or what ??? 
Sure is expensive driving, no ??  I got my joints out of RMR in Montreal
for $95.00 Canadian delivered to my door.  Better that the $600-$700 that
VW charged to PO.  Oh well now I have new ones.  So life begins again.

Cheers ??
