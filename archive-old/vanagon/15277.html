Subject: Allstate Car Cooler, by Sears


Martha-
I have a cooler of the description you provided.  It's made by Sears, or 
WAS made by Sears; 1940's or 1950's looks to be about right.
Anyway, the thing was my grandparents, and when we started renting their 
old house, we kind of inherited it (along with a LOT of puzzling crap!).
	This thing even has the instruction booklet/parts order booklet 
intact.  It runs off of your cig. lighter, 2 temp settings (hi/lo), water 
guage (empty/full), and has a built in bottle opener on the side.  
	I've never thought about selling it, but if your interested, feel 
free to email me privately or on the list.  I'll think about it between now
and then.  I just wanted to say &quot;I know what you're talkin' about!&quot;

					Bye-
