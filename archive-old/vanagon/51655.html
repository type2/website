Subject: GL Fuel Starvation and splash back

I had a lot of trouble with my '91 Transporter - fuel starvation on inclines
-to cut a long story short - the fuel pickup up is from the middle of the 
tank ( if you climb under and have a look its that round thing right in
the middle of the tank). The round thing is quite a large fuel filter and 
cut-off to stop any air from being introduced into the fuel system. 


WARNING as stated in one of the Bosch fuel injection hand books that 
they  can saftely run fuel through their pumps as there is never an 
explosive mixture present NO AIR!!!!!!!!!!!!!


THe fuel filter is maintance free as its is continuoesly cleaned by the 
return fuel supply from the motor. From the filter/cut-off there is 
moulded plastic line that goes to the outlet on the tank - this is what 
caused my problem the line had come off so with less than half a tank of 
gas and going down hill fuel starvation was occuring.

I also fixed my splash back problem - on the end of the filler pipe there 
is small platic holder that contains a hard platic ball about the size of 
a ping pong ball this had some how come out of its holder replaced the 
ball and no more slash back. It was so good not to get slashed with fuel 
ever time you had to fill up.
