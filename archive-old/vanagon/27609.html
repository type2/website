Subject: 16 Thing Bodies&amp;More Found!!!

WOW!, This morning on the way to work I stopped by a Phoenix business
location to complete a minor step in the quest for the wrap-up of the '67
&quot;Westy Resto From Hell.&quot; As I surveyed the scene, I noticed a neighboring
yard full of misc. VWs. Bugs, Bay windows, late late 70's westy, at least
two Ghias, maybe a splittie bus or two, etc. I found out that the whole yard
is up for sale as a ~lot purchase only~ for about $4,000-$5,000. The person
with whom I spoke was not sure on the exact figure, but was reassured that
all titles were clean and available.
**HERE's the kicker!**
I also noticed a 181. Then I noticed another, and another and... YIPES~! I
counted 16 Thing bodies (some piled on top of the other), piles of doors,
rear intake scoops, windsheid frames, etc, etc. etc. In my mind I was
formulating how on earth I was going to tell my very patient and
understanding and lovely wife that we now need to go into the &quot;junk&quot; yard
business. I calmly ran like heck (in my mind) to the office of the business
and asked if the 181's came with the deal. &quot;Oh, excuse me, do I HAVE to take
the 181 items along with the rest of the volkswagens in the yard?&quot; PANT,
PANT, Drool...
**BUZZ KILL**
&quot;Oh no!, That is a separate deal. Those belong to Larry Dustman. He runs a
business which specializes in those 'Things'. It's called the Trim Shop.
Have you ever heard of it?&quot; 
Honk!, wrong answer... I mumbled, &quot;Duh yup. Sorta think I heard of 'im. Have
a nice day.&quot; (Grrrrr).

With courtesy to (and legally covering my butt from) the Trim Shop et al, I
have worded this as to protect the location of said yard. Don't ask. Dang, I
thought I ran across the Lost Dutchman's Superstition Treasure. Oh well...
