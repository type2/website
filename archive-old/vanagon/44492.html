Subject: air cond compressor and water temp sender

Replaced condenser on air and couldn't get to idle, while up to 
speed would work but drag. It started to work at idle the high side 
had 450 lbs pressure. Now I'm told the compressor is shot. What 
happened?  2. VW says the water temp sender is the small one on the 
back (facing to front) of the themostat.  Is that the right one?
