Subject: Re: Syncro Fuel Capacity


   
  I was driving down I-5 in California when my engine started to lose 
power, the van was new to me so many thoughts rushed through my head.  I 
walk or ride a bicycle more than drive so I upon embarking on my trip I 
just assumed I had enough gas to get there.  I looked down and the needle was
at the bottom of the red.  I am certain that when the needle hits the 
bottom of the red my van stops.  I have in the years since that incident 
let the needle fall deep into the red and have filled the tank with close 
to 18 gallons.  So I caution those tempt disaster by trying to eke out 
another few miles.  Running out of gas is an avoidable inconvenience.

   I have heard from many sources that running your gas tank dry or near
empty is bad.  This due mostly to sucking whatever(crud,water) has settled 
to the bottom of the tank is not good for the injectors/engine.  I use to
travel alot in Mexico.
