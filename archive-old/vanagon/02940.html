Well, I checked the sight glass as Joel suggested and it looked okay.
I'm really short on time since my trip to Idaho/Oregon is in a week and
I have other preparations to make and work to do on the rental.  I took
it into VW and what started as a $31.00 estimate is now a $120.00 estimate.
They think it's the resistor pack which is tucked way up in the compartment
above the bed/seat.  I think I'll put in an access hole with some kind of
creative design so it looks legit.  I don't want to pay VW just to swap
out a resistor pack.  They said it was a common problem.  When I go pick it
up I'll try to get the low-down on why it's a common problem.
