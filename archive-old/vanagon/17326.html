Subject: Cargo Door mount dilemma, please help.

In the restoration process on my '62 Kombi, I have run into a little snag with the plates that the screws that hold the cargo bay doors on. Due to rust, I had to drill out the screws, only the force of pressing against the drill seems to have broken a holding strap on the &quot;plate&quot; causing the plates (yes, all four of them) to fall down inside of the metal tube area.
I know I cannot be the first person to encounter this problem. Any ideas? I would appreciate a response via e-mail, as I am temporarily not subscribing to the list. (Until we get a local Internet log on, the volume of mail was costing me a fortune.... I should be back within a month though.) This problem has me stumped....
