Subject:       Re: Advice needed: Accessory pricing questions? 


&gt;   What are your suggestions for building the ultimate camper/road 
&gt; machine.  Here are some accessories I am planning on buying with my 
&gt; camper upgrade on my new '88 Wolfsburg.  Does anyone know of anywhere I 
&gt; can get any of this stuff cheaper?  Also, what are your inputs as far 
&gt; worthwhile accessories?
&gt; 
&gt;       Swivel Seat:  $420  (Is this worth it?  do y'all who have 
&gt;           it like it?  Or should I just blow it off?)
I *think* you can pick up the swivel assembly from a Westy &amp; use your 
existing seats for much less $. We very rarely use ours, but there's 
only two of us (changing soon...:). 
&gt;       Porta-Potty:  $125   (Is this necessary?  It seems like a 
&gt;                   big space waster to me)
For that price, it should be a good one, but they can be had 
anywhere for around $100. Maybe they include a cabinet? We use a 
Sears model, placed behind front passenger seat, and wouldn't leave 
without it, since we rarely camp at regular campsites. The wife loves 
it for day trips also - saves hunting for a clean public washroom.

&gt;       Pop top:  $3250
&gt;       Sink/stove/fridge/cabinets:  $4750 (actually, this  
&gt;           includes a lot more, so if the price looks high, 
&gt;           that's why--cutains, fire ext, carpeting,   
&gt;           lights, water holder etc. etc.)
Both these seem high, but I guess that's installed price?
Should include aux battery system for house lights, sink pump, etc.

&gt;       Bra for front:  $125   (Do you like it?)
&gt;       Sun Roof:   $295
&gt;       Luggage Rack:   $125
&gt;       Awning:     $490    (Seems like nice to have)
&gt;       Tent for rear:  $325    (envelopes rear to extend   
&gt;           back--also seems like a very nice thing to have)
Don't have any of the above aside from the luggage rack,
which we haven't had to use yet.

In all items, I'd ask to inspect the quality before you have it
installed - you have to live with it, and won't be happy with
inferior quality.

Sounds like you're off to a good start - have fun!
