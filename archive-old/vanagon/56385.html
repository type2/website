Subject: Re[2]: Roof-racks for Westfalia

     Don't forget that if you mount to the raingutters, you will not be 
     able to pop the top without removing the rack.
     
     I have the Yakima system with the side mounts drilled into the 
     fiberglass.  
     
     Just take the boat off the rack and you can pop the top.  I have even 
     popped the top with two bikes and two snowboards attached, but it is 
     hard to push up.
     
     The real question is what kind of boat do you have, and how much does 
     it weigh?
     
     I am highly comforatble recommending the Yakima.  I have seen this 
     system with a full rocketbox holding hundreds of pounds with no 
     problem.  If you are concernend, you can go with a three bar system to 
     distribute the weight even more evenly among the drilled.
     
     Go to a shop and pick up the specs on Yakima and Thule.

John,
     
I use the Thule 901(?) system.  It mounts on the gutters and clears the pop 
top with on problem.  I carry 2 canoe's on top along with my bikes!!
     
When I get back home I will email the exact part numbers and the email 
address of the list member I puchased it from. He was great to work with.
     
Thanks,

&gt; I own a 1984 Westfalia. It has the fiberglass pop-up top. I would like 
&gt; to carry a canoe on the roof. Problem: I can't find any clamp-on roof 
&gt; racks for this model. Anybody know where this item is available? Any
&gt; other ideas about how to carry a canoe on the roof? 
&gt;
&gt;                                  All comments will be appreciated, 
&gt;
&gt;                                              John Falconer
