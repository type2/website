Subject: EV-Quick Heat Trick


Want your EV to heat up quick on those cold mornings? Here's a simple
tip. When you put the heat on, also turn on the air-recirculation
switch. This is the switch with the circular arrow located in
the switch cluster. Normally this recirculation switch is used,
for example, if you are behind a diesel and don't want the
fumes comming into the van...

In this case what the recirculation system will do is to keep
heating the air inside the cabin rather than drawing in cold
air from the outside and heating it. Once the temp of the EV
is comfortable, switch the recirculation system off and run the
heater as usual.

Warmly,  8)
