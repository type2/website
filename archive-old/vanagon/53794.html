&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;NO, the resistors are located behind the driver's side headlights.
&gt; &gt;Remove the headlight assembly and look below toward the outside and
&gt; &gt;locate two large ceramic wrapped resistors.
&gt; 
&gt; I believe these are the resistors for the rad fan, the heater blower
&gt; resistor is inside the airbox, was in my 2 85's and an '87.  Tim
