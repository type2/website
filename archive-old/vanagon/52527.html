&gt; Help!
&gt; My odometor stop working, so I followed the advice given by list
&gt; member for removal.  The gears were not broken, but just out of
&gt; place.  I pushed the assembly to the right and gears were engaging
&gt; just fine.  Put everything back together and it worked great for
&gt; about two days, but now we are back to the same old thing.  What
&gt; more do I need to do?
&gt; 
&gt; Best,

That happened to me a couple of years ago. After a couple of attempts 
to push it back together, I reassembled it with a dab of Loktite and 
it's been fine ever since.
