          The dipstick was not too hot (I could touch it bear handed)...
     
     First the feeble attempt at humor:
     
          &quot;If you could touch it bear handed, you've obviously been in the 
          (San Bernadino) forest too long.&quot;
          
          Bare handed is another story.
     
     Now some possible help:
     
          Since you're due, I'd try the oil change with a Mahle or Mann 
          filter.  If it continues, start troubleshooting the oil pressure 
          &quot;notification&quot; system.
          
          Are you using 20w50?
          
          Since 2000 give-or-take is the &quot;magic number&quot; on the &quot;L&quot; board 
          behind the tach, it could be that your low pressure oil sender is 
          dying.  Or it could be the board.
          
          I wrote about my adventures with the high pressure switch and the 
          missing &quot;L&quot; board sometime back in June.  You may want to check 
          the archives (if you can).
