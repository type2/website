Subject:       Re: Mystery Splittie Single Cab revisited

 
&gt; I just spotted the no-longer-mysterious Mystery Single Cab Splittie again 
&gt; where I work here, and picked up a few more details people asked me about.
&gt; 
&gt; The only things electrical on the back end of the bus, are the two little 
&gt; round flat taillights with chrome rims. No backup lights, no reflectors, no 
&gt; openings where other things should go. The rear hatch has a hole in the 
&gt; bottom center, which I at first took to be where the 
&gt; lock/pushbutton/whatever went to latch the hatch. But one listmember said 
&gt; that this '61 bus didn't come with a rear engine hatch lock or pushbutton 
&gt; (what *did* it come with there?); and another asked me if it had a crank 
&gt; handle aperture, to which I answered No. Now, however, I couldn't help but 
&gt; notice that this little hole in the hatch, was directly in line with the 
&gt; engine crankshaft. You don't suppose...???

Sounds like about a '57-61 (if those are &quot;sanddollar&quot; tailligts you 
describe) with the wrong bumpers.  The little hole is 
where the &quot;churchkey&quot; that opens the decklid goes.  I don't know 
if you're familiar with it, but usually there is a little chrome 
&quot;dustcover&quot; if you will that you flip out of the way and insert the 
key to turn the mechanism that opens the lid.  Sounds like either the 
cap, or whole mechanism is missing (if the mechanism was missing the 
whole lid would just flap open).

I don't know who said it wouldn't have any sort of hole back there.  
They all did (as far as I know) whether it be the churchkey mechanism 
or a pushbutton (67 only, I think).
