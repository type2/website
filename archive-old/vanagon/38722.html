Subject: GEX update

     Hi again,  I believe my last post (re: 1600 SP purchased from GEX and 
     gone bad) was when I was still waiting to hear from GEX re: the bad 
     head I sent back.  I received a phone call from Larry, the owner of 
     GEX, telling me he was concerned about my problem with this motor and 
     to send back the whole long block.  The head I sent them made them 
     think the problem was elsewhere in the motor.  
     
     Being tired of dealing with this, I sort of dumped on the guy.  
     Basically I stated that if I was just sending the motor back to them 
     so they could call me and say my warranty was void due to overheating, 
     tell me now so I can save the energy of crating, etc and deal with it 
     myself.  I was reassured that they would fix this motor or send me 
     another one.  
     
     So, off it goes this afternoon.  Keep your fingers crossed for me.  My 
     follow up letter to Larry is to the point about what will satisfy me.  
     I also let him know I was active on the net and that I planned to be 
     at the Busses in the Blue Ridge Rally in June, either singing his 
     praises or cursing him loudly.  They must know that word of mouth is 
     their most important advertising.  I just hope they still care.  Right 
     now I feel confident.  But then I'm tired of being negative.  This is 
     easier and less stressful.  He honestly seemed to be interested in 
     making this right.  More to come.
     Ray
     So far, my regret is not buying locally.
