Westie is spelled like the generic name for a West Highland Terrier.
Westy looks like a person's name.
I like Westi, just because.

&gt; Wow what an argument!  Impressive indeed.  However, I must present a purely
&gt; emotional appeal for the more common (in my experience) spelling of
&gt; &quot;Westy&quot;.
&gt; 
&gt; It is just this:  Westy looks better to me than Westie.  I'm not sure why.
&gt; Is the y a more aesthetically pleasing shape?  Perhaps.  Perhaps it is some
&gt; streak of peer pressure (I saw a bunch of y's before I ever saw an ie).
&gt; Perhaps I'm just mad.
&gt; 
&gt; Too much time on my hands,

&gt; 
&gt; Hmm, that capital Y makes even more difference, don't you think?
