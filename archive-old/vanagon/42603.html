Subject: RE: towing boat


&gt;&gt; Do FWD cars backing a trailer into the water, have this problem? If not,
&gt;&gt; why would a vanagon &quot;fronting&quot; a trailer into the water, have the 
problem?
&gt;
&gt;Because I've been in rear engine vehicles that have lost traction when
&gt;trying to go up a ramp forwards.  And accelerating make the weight shift to
&gt;the rear, taking weight off of the tires in front.  If the tires in the
&gt;front are the drive tires I'd think they would be more likely to lose
&gt;traction.

Well, whaddaya know-- I learn something new every day. This is the
first time I've heard of a rear-engine VW losing traction on *anything*
other than heavy snow or slick ice (been there, done both, wasn't happy).

Anyone else ever been in a FWD vehicle that lost traction going forward
up a hill or ramp, towing or otherwise? I'm curious how common this is.
Perhaps the water on the ramp added to the problem, Bradley? I guess
anything's possible.
