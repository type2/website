 Hey all,
 I really really hope this is a joke :)
 
 Taco Bell has taken out a full page ad in today's Washington Post with
 the following text:
 
 At the top of the ad there is a big picture of the Liberty Bell.
 
 Below that it says:
 
 &quot;TACO BELL BUYS THE LIBERTY BELL
 
 In an effort to help the national debt, Taco Bell is pleased to announce
 that we have agreed to purchase the Liberty Bell, one of our country's
 most historic treasures.
 
 It will now be called the `Taco Liberty Bell' and will still be
 accessible to the American public for viewing.
 
 While some may find this controversial, we hope our move will prompt
 other corporations to take similar action to do their part to reduce the
 country's debt.&quot;
 
 Taco Bell logo here.
 
 
 
 
 
 	Now that's a practical joke.
 
 	Sean
 
 	P.S.  I swear to God I'm not making any of this up.  Look in the
 	A section of the Washington Post, 4/1/96.
