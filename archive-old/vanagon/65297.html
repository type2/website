Subject:      1986 Kombi Syncro

Well, a close friend just crashed his diesel Westy, and now I have the
opportunity to get a full Westy set-up to schlop onto my 1986 Syncro
Kombi.

Should I?  I mean, I'd like to have a Syncro Westy, but the prices are
stupidly high, and I have this fairly-low-miles Kombi that I paid
dirt for.  But the Kombi is fairly straight and totally stock -- no
offensive additions or options 'cept the 4WD.  Vanagon-era Kombis are
extremely rare in the US, and I kinda hate to chop a hole in the roof,
and in the side, and put in openable windows (no, the side windows on
the Kombi are fixed glass).

I *think* the Kombi has stiffer springs, lower drive ratios, etc. than
the Syncro Westies, and it might make a better Syncro westy than the
factory ones.  It would be about the only one that says &quot;Transporter&quot; on
it.

So there is my dilemma.  Should I destroy a possibly unique (in the US)
vehicle to build a hacked-up imitation of a common model?  If I do, how
much should I offer my friend for his dead westy?  Don't drool over any
diesel parts folks -- the engine's already been snagged (although the oil
pan and tranny might be available).  There is extensive front-end damage.

If it is offensive to hack one of these, does anybody want to trade?  No,
I didn't think so...

After my friend tried to do serious off-road work in his Diesel Westy,
he went out and bought a very nice 1972 Westfalia.  With the tables, cot,
and the BN4 heater.  All complete and running, for $1000.  I'm not a
lover of the old layout, but seeing the immaculate BN4 sitting in the
engine well it was pretty hard not to like his new bus.  Of course, this is
California, and there is not a speck of rust on the thing.  Hopefully,
he'll start making it to the CCC and CCA campouts -- he's and old friend
of Kathy's.  There still are some steals available out there, folks, for
all you old bus lovers.  And if SB42 passes, maybe this thing will be
even better (it is real hard to get these through smog checks, mostly
the visual part, anymore).

...and if I built my Kombi into a camper, then I could get rid of the old
1980 Westy and be down to only 3 VWs!
