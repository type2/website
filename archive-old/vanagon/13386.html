Subject:       ANOTHER reason for bright lights

here's one more reason for that ground wire for brighter lights (at 
least when they are halogen):

the design of the halogen bulb is such that a critical temperature
must be reached inside the quartz bulb.  this high temperature is
reached by supplying 'sufficient' voltage, meaning as much as it can
get.  why is the high temp necessary? because the tungsten element
is continually vaporizing itself when it glows white-hot; if there
is not a high enough temp inside the quartz envelope (bulb) then
this tungsten deposits on the inside of the envelope instead of back
onto the filament, leading to a darker bulb (lower light output) and
shorter bulb life.  BTW as is now somewhat obvious, they use QUARTZ
glass to withstand this necessary high heat for filament
re-deposition, not because of any magical optical property of the
bulb.  bulb fanatics even go as far as saying to not turn your
lights on until 30 seconds or so after the car has started so that
the intial voltage drop from starting the motor doesn't give too low
a voltage to the bulb.  in my experience, they seem to last long
enough without worrying about that low start-up vopltage.  suppling
sufficient voltage, however, IS critical for the usual operating
period.

Joel is right about the beam pattern causing glare, not a bright 
bulb.  US lighting specifications have lagged far behind Europe in 
terms of lens design and 'stray' light.  the US keeps the bulb 
wattage limit low because we have such lousy optics.  if you go with 
an illegal, european spec headlamp, you can also go to a higher watt 
bulb and get better light with less glare... talk to Westinghouse and 
Phillips about influencing US legislation on this point!
