&gt;   HI Everyone,
&gt;                Could someone send me the address for subscribing to the 
&gt; Vanagon list, I`m having trouble staying on the list and someone at Netwit 
&gt; wants to try subscribing. I lost mail a few days ago and lost the Vanagon 
&gt; stuff. 
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks  Sonya 
&gt; 
&gt; 
You lucky *&amp;%$^. I've been trying to unsubscribe for weeks.

To subscribe I sent a message with subscribe in the header to 
Vanagon_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu.

Good luck.
