Subject: 009 &amp; #3 problem

It has long been established that an overheat problem exist(ed/s) with
the #3 cylinder, and that this is blamed on the placement of the oil
cooler.  An attempt to help this was the timeing on the #3 cylinder is
retarded slightly and then finally the oil cooler was placed in the
dog-house.
Along comes a remote oil cooler that should cure the overheat problem.
 So, now that the overheat problem has been corrected, should there be
a new distributor that would retime #3?  If so, has anyone any
experience with this or is it time to tool up and make some to try.  I
guess, but am not certain that the timeing on #3 was changed by not
haveing symmetrical lobes on the distributor cam for point operation. 
I see in the OEM part listings a 050 distributor listing.  What is it?
 Does anyone know if the later horizontally opposed, air-cooled
engines, (78-etc) still have the #3 timeing retarded? Or, does the 009
remove the retard?? 
Any and all responses welcomed and given their appropriate grain of
salt, until I pull my 009 and mike the point cam.
