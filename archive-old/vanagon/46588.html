&gt; &gt;I have to agree with you entirely here.  We *do* need better public transit
&gt; &gt;systems, and we *should* start destroying old cars (or forcing them to
&gt; &gt;upgrade to new engines.)
&gt;
&gt; Good thing that will never happen.  As the old saying goes, I'll stop
&gt; driving my bus when they pry my cold, dead hands from the steering wheel.
&gt; Part of the American ethic is the government not being able to force me to
&gt; give up my car  when I bought it and cared for it legally.

It's not just an ethic, it's enshrined in the Constitution.  No ex post
facto laws.  Ever.  The government cannot make a car meet standards
enacted after it was manufactured.  You are only required to obey laws
*after* they are passed and signed.

&quot;What part of &quot;shall make no law&quot; didn't you understand?
