Subject: Carat Folding Table

While I have your attention, I'm embarrassed to admit that, in spite of being
able to solve some pretty tricky problems relating to my dearly-beloved
bluebus, I'm at a loss trying to figure out how to get my folding table
unstuck from its closed position.  All of a sudden, now, when I push it in to
release it, it's not releasing.  I've tried pushing hard and gently.  It's
springy but totally stubborn.

What do I do?  I don't want to pry it off and break it, and I'd rather not
get involved in removing the top bolts and risking some other problem.

Is there a trick to this?
