Subject:       Vote southern Ontario!


&gt; Let's have one of the up and coming camping trips in the North or North 
&gt; east states, so it's more easily accessable to all.
&gt; 
&gt; Better yet... Southern Ontario has some beautiful Campgrounds...
&gt; Hint Hint Hint...

Just say YES to southern Ontario.  Scenery(sp?) privacy lots-a rocks  
 Fantastic fishing. Border crossing will be a snap-- just leave the 
baggy at home!

Any takers?
