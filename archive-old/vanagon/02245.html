Subject: call for lyrics


I'm compiling a collection of songs for out trip.  Please e-mail
your contributions to me, and I'll be happy to keep track of them.
They can be camping songs, travelling songs, car songs, etc.  What
I am missing, however, and what I would MOST like to have are
the priceless works of the members of this list from your Friday
afternoon &quot;creative&quot; times, and unfortunatley, I did not save them!

Thanks,


/Martha Rubin
