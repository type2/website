Brian (sorry for the delay in replying, but I just got back from a week 
in the frozen NE), 

The key to a good cup of percolator coffee is in the timing.

Here's what we do: 
Line the bottom of the basket (the place you put the coffee) with a paper 
towel.  Just lay it on top on push straight down, punching a hole in the 
center of the towel.  Line the paper towel with 3 scoops (if you have a 
10 cup perker, try less if smaller), then fold each corner of the paper 
towel over the &quot;spike&quot; in the center, punching a hole in each corner so 
the whole package lays flat in the basket.

Fill with water to ~1/2&quot; below the bottom of the basket.  Turn the flame 
on high until the pot starts bubbling in the little globe on top.  Once 
it's really bubbling away, turn the flame low, say about 1/2&quot; high.  Once 
the color of the coffee is nice and dark and the smell permeates the 
van, shut off the flame, then wait until it stops perking.  Pour and enjoy.

If that's not to your liking, there's always the Texas recipe which is to 
get 5 gallons of water boiling, then throw a pound of coffee in.  Bring 
it back to a boil then:
Let it boil...
Let it boil...
Let it boil...
Then throw a horseshoe in. 
Let it boil...

When the horseshoe rises to the top, you know it's done.

One caveat.  You'll need a lab beaker to pour into since it will eat 
through anything else.

&gt; I have on of those blue enameled coffee makers, an old school one 
&gt; that has the metal pole and cup inside - I do believe they were 
&gt; called percolaters.  I use it for making coffee when camping in the 
&gt; bus (ingenious, I know.)  Anyways I find I can't get it to make a decent 
&gt; cup of coffee and I would really like to know why.  If anyone has had 
&gt; good experience with these things could you please e-mail me directly 
&gt; and share the wisdom regarding flame level, time, amount of grounds, 
&gt; etc.?

&gt; Thanks,

&gt; P.S. - I'll be less sarcastic when I get my first cup of proper 
&gt; strength coffee from the thing. ;-)
