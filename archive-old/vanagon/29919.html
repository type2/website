Subject: 87 Vanagon sliding door problem

Thanks to all who had a suggestion on the fix for my sliding door which
sometimes popped open even if it was locked while driving.  I tried the least
time and trouble fix first and it has been staying put through the past
two weeks. WD-40 liberally sprayed into the rear latch mechanism seems to
have cured the problem, for now anyway. Thanks again!!!
