Subject: Re: 2 litre align bore

&gt;Greetings all
&gt;
&gt;I have a second hand 2 litre short block which I intend 
&gt;rebuilding and fitting into an 1800 Kombi camper.  
&gt;
&gt;Upon dismantling the case I discovered writing (VW logo and
&gt;some numbers) on one of the main bearing journals (no. 2) which
&gt;suggests to me that the case has not previously been align bored.  
&gt;Does this logic hold true for those in the know?  
&gt;
&gt;Thanks in advance.

&gt;Aaron,
The marks you are seeing are from the bearing shells themselves.
You must measure the bores to determine if your case has been bored.
Type IV cases don't require as much work as Type I.
