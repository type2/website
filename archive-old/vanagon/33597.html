In a message dated 96-01-24 06:57:21 EST, you write:

&gt;My van  intermitantly sends oil warnings (ie. warning light and nasty
&gt;buzzer at 2000+ RPM).

Not really enough info to make an accurate diagnosis.  First, I would
recommend installing an analog oil pressure guage.  Electric are OK but I
would prefer a tube type that will read the actual pressure.  (Less chance of
guage failure).

Possibilities are:

-Too much oil pressure.  Could be caused by clogged oil passages in the
engine case and/or crank and cam shafts.  Also, you could be getting pressure
from a leaking combustion chamber into the lower end of your engine.

-Too little oil pressure.  Worn crank bearings, cam bearings, or oil pump
face plate.  Oil level low, broken down oil, etc...

-Faulty guage.

You really need to know exactly what the oil pressure is doing.  Many of the
items I mention above are very serious.  Pressure problems can often be a
sign of a near future engine rebuild or replacement.  

How many miles on your engine?  What is the compression of you cylinders?  Is
there any noticeable sign of power loss?  What other symptons occur when the
light and buzzer go on?  Do you get power loss, lifter tapping, etc...?
