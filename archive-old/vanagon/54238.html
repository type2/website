Subject: MSDS (brush-guards, Porsche conversion)

You said:

&gt; I want a bush guard like that (well, one would be nice, one that was
&gt; more like the one on the Tristar photo that someone had on their web
&gt; page would be nice). Anyone know where Martin Schneider got his from
&gt; that page?

I guess I wasn't clear:  That's *his* product and he sells them. I
think he calls them &quot;Panzer Guards&quot;. Phone number for MSDS is (818) 
453-8823. Usual disclaimers appply.

My previous post was under a somewhat non-descriptive subject header
(&quot;CA trip report&quot;) and may therefore have gone unnoticed to some: to
summarize, I was in L.A., went to MSDS out of curiosity, and took 4
pictures of the MSDS &quot;Range Panzer&quot;, a 3.2 liter Porsche powered
Vanagon Syncro with brush guards. You'll find them at
http://econwpa.wustl_dot_edu/~samid/bus-stuff/MSch/ along with some
personal comments. 

Someone asked me about the price of the 911 conversion kit. 
Unfortunately, I misplaced the brochure, but do remember that the
price is somewhere between $1,500 and $2,000. That doesn't include the
Porsche engine (~$4,000).
