&gt; The unit that I have decided to install is a 1&quot; receiver type (square box

&gt; 170.00 (no sales tax in NH).  

&gt; Hope this helps?

Price is better than at the VW dealers I've checked - my prices were not 
installed.  Learned a bunch about trailer hitches this weekend - had to 
put a hitch on something to tow a Thing home - opted the easy way out for 
now and put a ball on the bumper of my S-10 pickup.  Will put a Class II 
on the EV as I have time.  Even contemplating towing two things to the 
Manassas bugouts behind the EV (only about five miles of backroads so not 
many cops to freak out).  I have a Class I hitch on on of the Things that 
theoretically could pull the second Thing.  Am I nuts or what!

&gt; Is your MV a weekender (Westy) ?

Non-Westy, Non-Winne, Non-Weekender.  

Has table and rear facing seats.  Has extra heater and A/C.  Has bed/back 
seat.

Doesn't have cooler seat, pop-top or CD player.

You got a fancy one?
