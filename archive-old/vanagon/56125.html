Subject: Front trailer hitch (for bike rack)

I'd like to have a &quot;hitch&quot; made for a bike rack designed for a 
trailer hitch, but have it on the FRONT of my Westy.

Has anyone done this? I haven't pulled the bumper yet, but hoped 
someone might have some ideas on how to have a bracket made.

tia.
