Pete,

Your timing sucks!! I just paid AMEX $350 for the Michelins for my
EV last week....sure go ahead rub salt into the wounds of my
checkbook!!!

Seriously, the VW Gods have indeed shone down on your head...which
is much better than seagulls $hitting down on your head!

Congrats (said in a sour grapes tone)


;-)
