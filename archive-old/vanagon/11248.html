Sounds almost too easy.  You can get a 6VDC to 120VAC converter if you look
really hard in the JCW catalog or bug the dickens out of your local ancient
rv folks.  Then it's a simple matter of hooking your 120vac battery charger
and running to the battery set.  

To charge the &quot;12VDC&quot; battery you'll need 13.8VDC+ a little which of course
you can't easily get from 6VDC.  Kinda like making a waterfall run backwards.

Sacrilegious to convert the bus.  Maybe a solar charger for the long days at
the beach.  

Basics of conversion to 120VAC from DC.  Use a &quot;chopper&quot; to break the DC into
pulses at 60 hz (cycles/sec).  Use a transformer to go from 6vdc chopped to
130VAC.  Filter the trash off the 130VAC 60~ to get 115VAC nominal.
