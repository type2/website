Subject: a proposal and a plea

hey all, its me again.  i wanted to formally introduce myself and ask
for a favor.  i bought a 73 camper bus and love it.  i just got done
driving across the country a few months ago from south carolina to my
new home here in portland, oregon.  ohh the places we went and the
things we saw!  and just last week a very nice friend and i drove to
the top of a mountain in washington on a dirt road that looked as though
only large four wheel drive trucks ever venture upon.  what a sight
that was, climbing/crawling straight up gripping the wheel while she
pushed against the dash to help the bus climb.  ohhhh, but the view
and the evening was worth it.  in short i am in complete love with my
big blue bus and hence my plea for help.....

i am really new at trying to be a mechanic, i have muir's book and am
doing my best to get a clue, but was wondering if i could talk some
kind soul near the portland (or seattle as i am there ofter) area to
possibly spend an hour (at the most, i promise) pointing a thing or
two out for me and answer some very simple questions (such as what the
heck is that thing there on the engine, and now where the heck is that
located, ...).  i wouldn't ask you to fix anything for me, i just want
a slight push to get me going.  in return i would be more than willing
to purchase you a bunch of your favorite beer and feed you something
delicious.  if someone were willing i would be amazingly appreciative
and would sing your praises.  anyway, it would be great if someone
wouldn't mind.

or, are there any vw clubs in the area that anyone knows of that i
could join?

take care everyone,
		brandy
