         All you have here is a bigger battery, It might take a little
longer to drain, but it will drain.  The idea to use something like a zener
and a relay to controll the min. voltage is OK, but droping to 10V when you
must have apx 9.6V (I think that I recall that number from the Muir book,
and it seemed to be close for my 181 (as a H.S. student I never had the
money to maintain that thing properly (and now(ya know, its been sitting
half in and half out of that garage for over a decade now)I just seem to
lack the inclineation ))) to start.  10V is just cutting it to close for me.

	What I use is a simple battery isolater.  Yes, I know that there is some
debate about these devices but it works OK for me.  The only trouble that I
have is that after I re-wired my van after the fire I wound up with the glow
plug relay being powered by the aux battery.  Not a big proublem, but I do
need to fix it.
