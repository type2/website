Subject: Kroil!

Last night, I found myself in the difficult predicament of having to remove 
a Vanagon AC compressor, held on with an allen-head bolt, without the 
proper allen key.  All I had was a pair of vice grips, and the bolt head is 
completely round, so they just kept slipping.

Then I tried a product that Kyle Wade turned me on to, called Kroil.  He 
swore it was like liquid wrench times ten. I put a couple of drops on the 
bolt, and it practically slid off by itself.  Tried it on some other tight 
bolts, same results.  

I believe they sell direct (615-833-4101). Anyone else ever try this stuff?
