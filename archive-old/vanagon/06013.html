&gt; Hi group-
&gt; I would be very curious (and appreciative) if people would post their 
&gt; fuel mileage they are getting with their various rigs out their.  It 
&gt; would give us all an idea of what to expect from different 
&gt; engines/configurations as we continue our search for that ultimate 
&gt; van.  It also is a good overall indicator of engine health. Those of you not bogged
&gt;  down in the U.S. nomenclature of *miles per gallon* are welcome to post km per
&gt;  liter or whatever you use.  We can figure it out -- it'll be our punishment for not 
&gt; going metric when we had the chance.

1967 Kombi, with '68 beetle engine
Bosch 009 ignition, including plugs, wires, and coil
New Solex 30/31 pict carb

on the highway this summer, I got around 26 mpg. Yes, I am certain of
that. I run 92 or 93 octane fuel. In the city, it's more around 14-15 mpg
Hope that helps.
Richard
