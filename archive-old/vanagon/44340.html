Subject: Type 1 hydraulic lifter needed

Help!!  A customer of mine is in the process of collecting the parts to
re-do his 1600 DP.  He has seven, yes, counted them twice, seven CB
Performance hydraulic lifters.  Seven will not quite do it.  CB Performance
discontinued them about a year and a half ago.  Does anyone have one (or a
set) that they might be persuaded to part with?

Thanks...

Jim Arnott
