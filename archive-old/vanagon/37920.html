Subject: SSVC back ..live 'n' kicking

Hello again all from Dave on behalf of Splitty lovers in Britain (oops, nearly
said England..BAD mistake).
Mega - pro show here last weekend, Volksworld (the mag) hosted their posh car
show plus usual VW roadshow and swapmeet etc. too much to say here (Lee had
his bus in the posh bit..get him to tell you all about some of the
breathtakingly stunning beauties on display. Even I stopped to
gawp)....outside in the real world ...sunshine after days of misery and
rain/cold , clubs mounted displays..the Karmann Ghia lot had some amazing
cars...but unbiased and totally neutral as I am I reckon SSVC gave a good
sense of what we all drive! We had four barndoors (incl the oldest Bus in
Britain) and about 20 vans...including a dropped souped up Panel van proudly
driven by ...well he was around before Ben Pon thought Transporter...
Type 2's were the vehicle of the show...in and out...from amazing original
pristine to stunning custom to heap of twisted metal! good times...keep them
busses alive!
