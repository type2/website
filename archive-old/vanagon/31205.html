Subject: Help: 80 Westfalia propane tank location

A friend of mine is going to pick up a 1980 Westfalia on Wednesday.   
YAY!
I told him I would look over it for him as best I could so he would 
have an idea that all the pieces were there.
yikes!

I looked at it quickly in the dark, and I was wearing my suit so I
didn't crawl around under the bus, however I didn't see the propane
tank on the drivers side that I have on my 84.  Is it located
somewhere else?  Or perhaps missing?
