Subject: VW customer opinion-poll [part 2]

Dear listees,

Ron Lussier has made the generous offer to install a special &quot;answer the VW 
off-roder opinion poll&quot; page at Vanagon_dot_com.

So if you want to wait for that to give your replys quite easily in a few 
days,(installing may take a week or so) frequently check the news at :

Many thanks to Ron for his friendly support  !
