Subject:      Re: Cupholders (back to EV MV original question...)

Got some not quite original perfectly acceptable replacements at Walmart
(or was it K-Mart)  Something like Open Road...  price less than $4 a piece
and they were bonus in that they had &quot;spreading&quot; arms to allow larger cups.

They've survived as well or better since they haven't broken yet than the
the Gen-yew-ine VW/Audi parts...  The originals seemed tougher but were
really more brittle.  The &quot;fakes&quot; seemed cheaper but have enough flex to
last the teenagers abuse.  Your abuse may vary though...

Perfect screw in replacement holes.  Information has been on the list before
but wasn't specifically EV MV if I remember...  Well they were black not
the original gray as well.  I can handle that.  Still doesn't help up front.
That thing in the glove box is completely useless.
