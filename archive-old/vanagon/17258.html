Subject: Re: CB Antennas and stuff

I don't remember where i saw it but, there is an adapter that allows the
AM/Fm antenna to be used for both CB and AM/FM reception.  JC Whitney maybe
I'll keep my eyes open.

The loop around the headliner will not work.  SWR and other technobabble make
it unworkable.
