Howdy,

	I am taking the rest of the wee off to do the last bit of rustoration
on my bus.  My specific plans are to replace the metal section to the right 
of the engine, next to the wheel well, and Extend and paint the engine
compartment, and maybe put in a new tank and a cover for it.

	I managed to get my SO to help a bit last night - she took a die
grinder and a wire brush and cleaned up most of the floor.  Still gotta get 
under the bed (which is bolted down) and seal some seals, though.

	Today I'm going to fab the replacement piece for the engine compartment,
and continue to scrub the engine compartment down.

	Enjoy your day at work!

Thom
