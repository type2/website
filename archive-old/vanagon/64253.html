Subject:      Heading to Boston-repair shops?

We're headed out right after work today from Allentown to the Boston
area.  We're either gonna crash at a truck stop or I might yet find a
campground in the AAA manual on the way.  Recommendations are
welcome.  We figured we'd be arriving too late to bug LiMBO members
for driveway space.

Can anyone recommend repair shops in the Boston area?  What about
up towards Maine?  We'll be in Saco (near Kennebunk) for a wedding
Saturday.

So if you see a white GL (pictures on our web site) in the area with
2 fog lights and 2 driving lights on the front and lots of stickers
on the back (including a (D), list sticker, LiMBO, and
Fahrvergnu&quot;gen) say hello or wave.   :-)

Regards,

-Karl
