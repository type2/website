&gt;I have a '81 transporter with a 1973 cc aircooled engine.

&gt;For repair I would like to remove the engine ( just the
&gt;engine,
&gt;not the transmission !) from under the vehicle and bring
&gt;it
&gt;to my garage. This shouldn't be too difficult according to
&gt;the
&gt;manual. I wonder if it is possible carrying the whole
&gt;thing
&gt;with two people into a car and mounting and remounting it
&gt;using
&gt;a simple hydraulic jack. What is the weight of such an
&gt;engine  ??&gt;

It is about 120 kg. The 1600-aircooled is leightweighted
against it, but handeling with 2 persons is possible.
