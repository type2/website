So Thom Fitzpatrick says:
&gt; 
&gt; I got rear-ended on the way to work this morning :(
&gt; 
&gt; I stopped at an intersection (Howe X Marconi) when I heard a siren,
&gt; so I slowed down, saw the ambulance, and then stopped.  The guy behind
&gt; me _barely_ stopped.  Well, the girl behind him didn't, and started a
&gt; chain reaction.
&gt; 
&gt; What made it funny was the ambulance was right in front of me when it
&gt; happened, and he heard the crunches, and I got the see the look on his face
&gt; and I'm sure he got to see the look on mine!

I got some work done at California Collision in Folsom.

I know there kinda out of the way but they did a good job.
