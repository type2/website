Subject: Semaphore School

Tonight I played with my new semaphores.

The work!  Having never even seen them in operation before, I was delighted
so see them pop up and glow when I hooked them up to power.

I mounted them in the bus, and they fit.  However, I want to compare one to
a _bus_ semaphore and see the differences.  I know the lenses are very
different, different colors even.  Perhaps we could get some Clara-fication
on the subject...

I know there are a few other people on the list with &quot;semaphore busses,&quot;
who may be able to help out here.  For example, do the bus ones have a
slight curve to them to follow the body, or are they perfectly straight?  

There is one list lurker whom I know personally, who has a nice set on his
recently aquired '54 panel, which he is too shy to come out and announce...
