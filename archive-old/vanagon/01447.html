Has anyone out there had any experience in adding an extra oil cooler to an 
air 
cooled Vanagon?  Out in CA these add-ons were popular with buses but not 
Vanagons. I would like to get a sense of the advantages of using 
one (increase in oil pressure, lower oil temp, etc) with the Vanagon 
given the increase in weight. I realise using 20 
W50 is crucial but prior to using an extra oil cooler I found that after 
about an hour psi would not exceed 20 even at highway speed (bearings and 
oil pump are ok). This meant that climbs through the rockies were 
unbearable. Using the extra cooler has meant 
an increase in 10 to 20 psi meaning better engine life. My understanding is 
that wasserboxers also 
use the one cooler so this question may have relevence to them as well. 
What (apart from what the manual says is appropriate) has beeen your 
experience?

I have yet to fathom exactly how the oil cooler is cooled when the flaps 
are completely open because it appears to be completely closed off from 
air flow when the engine is being cooled. Please enlighten me you 10 1982 
vanagon owners 
comprising the second largest numbers of  readers to this list.  DC
