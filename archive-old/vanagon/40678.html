Subject: Help! I'm missing my E-mail from today!

AOL cut off my account this morning due to a billing error.  This resulted in
my being deleted from the Vanagon list.  I missed all postings to the list
concerning &quot;serious about buying VW specialist shop? read on!&quot;.   I have one
direct posting from JDOV* and that's all.  Did anyone respond on the list
that I missed?  If so, can someone foreward them to me?  I would be very
happy if you did.

Being cut off from you fine folks was scary!  Each time I conducted a flash
session I received &quot;NO NEW MAIL&quot; as a message.  I didn't know what was going
on.  I felt really alone.  I thought for a while that I might even have to go
into the other room and talk with the wife and kid.  I'm so glad that I got
you all back.  You are my tribe.  I had no idea how much I've come to depend
on this list for companionship.  No one else in the world would know what the
hell I was talking about if I were to start a conversation about crew-cab
transporters, or even how vital their role is in keeping the world spinning
in the proper direction now, would they?

Whether you knew it or not, every one of you 600 plus members were dearly
missed for a frantic 20 minutes.
