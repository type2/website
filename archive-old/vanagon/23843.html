Subject: Vanagon Front Swivel Seat

I just removed the front passenger seat &quot;swiveler&quot; (for want of a better term)
from the '84 vanagon located in a junkyard in Rockville, Md. (Tim Smith -
tranny is still in the van, along with what's left of the engine) I will try to
get the swiveler under the passenger seat in my '87 van, which came without the
swivel seats, and report the results to the list. It looks like an easy
conversion but I've been wrong about such things before.
