&gt;
&gt; I was wondering if anyone has found a source for the white rubber 
trim 
&gt;that goes on all the westy cabinets. All of my stuff has dried up 
and 
&gt;shrunk a couple inches or is missing from the PO. Any leads or 
ideas 
&gt;would help. Thanks

I have been told, but have not confirmed, that similar stuff is 
available in a roll at RV supply stores.
