Subject:      re: Extra Gas

for anyone who is interested, here's the address of the folks who make
a little 1.5 gallon STEEL gas can that fits into the wheel of the spare
tire (i.e., the &quot;hole&quot; that's already in your spare tire). it ain't cheap,
but it is really solid and tough. comes with a latching lid (like those
big military cans) and a detachable steel/flexible pouring spout/neck.

Stainless Steel Brakes Corp.  Doughnut Gas Tank, item # A2900 - $70,
11470 Main Road               little metal spare gas tank that fits into
Clarence, NY 14031            the spare tire (1.5 gallons) under the
(716) 759-8666                front of the vanagon.

(the can SAYS it's certified by the german TUV agency).
