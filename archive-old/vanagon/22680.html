Subject: Brake pad scraping sound

Hi folks,

I'm about to replace the worn rotors/pads on my '71, but before I delve into
it, I have a question regarding a sound I've been hearing recently.  I'm
getting an intermittent scraping sound coming from the front drivers side
wheel.  When I press on the brake pedal the sound disappears and stays away
for awhile only reoccur intermittently.  I'm not getting any scraping sound
when I apply the brakes and the van does not pull to one side before or
after braking.

Now, this is the first disc brake vehicle I've had.  I'm wondering if the
piston in the caliper could be sticking slightly (either do to a partially
blocked brake line or a problem with the caliper) and causing the pads to
rub a little. 
I won't know the condition of the caliper until I remove it, I'd just like a
sneak preview/advice regarding the probable cause.  Could this be some
phenomenon of worn pads?  If so, I'd expect to hear the scraping when I
applied the brakes and not when they're retracted.

Thanks,
(that's the brakes, I guess)
