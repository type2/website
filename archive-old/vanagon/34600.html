Good idea except for those states that limit what can be placed on the
windshield.

In The Biggest Little State in the Union (RI), the only *permitted*
stickers are the state inspection sticker. Of course I've got 2 town issued 
beach passes and a local resident transfer station pass. So in my case,
I'm already 3 over the limit for the font window.

Now, according to the weakly stats, there is only one other Rowdhilander
on the list so we won't be crossing paths very often.
