Subject: Re: Turn Signal Flasher Replaced-Wipers NG

I haven't seen a VW with a turn signal relay with more than three terminals
since working on, oh say about 68 or 69 bugs. I think you replaced the
intermittent wiper relay with the turn signal relay. The wiper relay will
have the VW part number of xxx 955 xxx. I think the turn signal will have
the part number xxx 919 xxx.

&gt;weekend I replaced the turn signal flasher unit in my 84 GL with a new,
&gt;electronic unit that I purchased at the FLAPS.  Upon removal of the old
&gt;unit, I was surprised to note that the new one only had three terminals
&gt;while the old one had five or so.  (Yes, I kept it, just in case.)  I
&gt;installed the new one anyway (it plugged right into the socket), and
&gt;tested all the turn signals and the four-way hazard lights too.  All
&gt;worked fine, so I thought, oh well.  It didn't occur to me to try the
&gt;windshield wipers.  This morning there was lots of dew on the
&gt;windshield, so I tried to use the intermittant position on the wipers to
&gt;clear it.  It didn't work at all!  The wipers will work in the low or
&gt;high speed position, but they don't &quot;park&quot; when the switch is turned
&gt;off.  Now I think I know what those extra contacts on the old flasher
&gt;unit were for!  Has anyone else been down this road before?  Has anyone
&gt;dealt with this by making their own programmable delay circuit for the
&gt;wipers to allow the delay interval to be varied?  Willing to share the
&gt;schematic?
