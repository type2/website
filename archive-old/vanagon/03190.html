&gt;  As still a &quot;rookie&quot; owner, I have been learning more and more
&gt;about NuBus' ('82) affect on other drivers. IT DRIVES THEM INSAAAANNEE.
&gt; 
&gt; 1)Its a bunker-burner, and people can't stand the diesel exhaust
&gt; 

Be glad you have the diesel exhaust.  I've used it as weapon many times.
I once owned a diesel Jetta, with 300K miles and the original rings, 
and it smoked heavily at high rpm.  At highway speeds, I was able to
use my own brand of justice on people who did me wrong, like:

	tailgaters
	people (nimrods?) driving with their high beams on
	people (dolts?) leaving their turn signal on

If one of these transgressors were behind me, and I was in a suitably
foul (or happy) mood, I would simply push in the clutch and rev that
poor diesel engine, creating enough of a cloud behind me so that I
couldn't see that tailgating car, and those high beams would no longer
blind me, and that annoying turn signal no longer bothered me.

I had the most fun when a cop pulled up behind me at a light, and
since he was a cop, felt that he had to pull within two inches of
my bumper.  Well, I figgered he liked the smell of my sweet diesel
exhaust so much, I'd give him a real dose!  I just revved that oil
burner until I couldn't tell that the policeman was stopped so close.
Fortunately, I was in a state (Alabama) that doesn't have any emissions
laws, and policeman didn't feel it was necessary to chat with me.
