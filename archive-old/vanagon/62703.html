Subject: Pop-top mechinism and Volkswagen-Toyota cross breading or Implanting a pop-top on a 4Runner

Forgive me if this strays too far from water cooled Vanagons. By the way
I am still looking for a Westfalia in the Seattle area (86 and newer).

Ok, what I want to do is build a replacement top for my `84 4Runner (and
maybe a short run for profit) with a Westfalia style pop-top on it. Yes,
I am cazy. That said, can anyone reccomend a certain year top that is
most likely going to adapt well...or a top that is easily aquired and
adaptable and isn't imposible to find replacement parts for...

The 4Runner top is 45&quot; wide but I can make it wider by about 5-6 inches.
Length is not much of an issue since I envision the pop-top portion
extending over the cab.

Any info or suggestions appreciated. Apologies for being 99% off topic.


Cheers
Eric Schumacher
