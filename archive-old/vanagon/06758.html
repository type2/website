Hi Charles.  I went this ordeal a few years ago as well.  I ended up with
an excellent set of tires to replace the originals.  They are Yokohama
Y370 in LT195 75/R14 size. I run them 43 psi front and 53 psi rear.  No sway,
excellent all weather traction, and man, can the van ever corner well! These
tires make the van stick to the road big time.  I am now on my second set
of these tires, and am very impressed.. does it show? :)

The Yokohamas are a D load rating tires, and will hold over 1750 pounds each
at 65 psi!!!... although you will need steel valve stems for over 55 psi.

These tires wear extremely well, and are beautifully made.  They all have less
than half an ounce of weight, and one tire has NONE!  They are smooth and quiet
as well.  I was so impressed with Yokohamas on my van, I put a set of 382's
on my Golf!  Same results there as well...


I have a Syncro Westy, and my choice of tires is even more limited due to the
additional weight.  Hope this helps.

Thx.
Harry

 My wife took the Vanagon in to get a pair of tires.  I went through the
 regular warnings like &quot;you know they never have the high pressure radials in
 stock so make them show you the pressure rating&quot;.  Both my wife and the tire
 store went through this drill 2 years ago, but...

 As usual when she got home the tires only had a 40 psia pressure rating.
 These are Michelin XZX 185R14.  The 55 psia tires they replaced were
 Michelin XZX 185R14 *C*.  I have been very happy with the &quot;C&quot; tires but my
 experience with any lower pressure tire on the rear of the vehicle inflated
 below 45 psia is that it sways and is more unstable than usual at highway
 speed.  The ply ratings are identical on the tires.  The load rating on the
 &quot;C's&quot; is 1710 lb. on the &quot;non-C's&quot; its around 1500 lb.

 The store will replace them when they get the others in (Evans Tire at
 Alderwood for Seattlites) and gave us no hassle.  Any recommendations?
