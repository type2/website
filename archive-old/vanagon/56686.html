Subject: Re: Stiff Shifter

Mine gets stiff periodically also.   I just crawl under neath and spray the
front and rear bushings with spray-on lithium grease.   Much easier than
disassembly.   Wish there were boots for the shaft around the bushings,
though.

&gt;I had the same problem on my '80 (since replaced with an '86). It was
&gt;somewhat of a hassle, but I removed the front half of the shaft that
&gt;connects the gear shift with the transmission. About 1/3 of the way back
&gt;it goes through a nylon bushing, and then connects to the rear half with
&gt;a clamp. I greased the shaft and bushing, put it back together, and
&gt;after some adjustment of the clamp, it worked beautifully.
