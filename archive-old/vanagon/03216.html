Subject: Re: Overheating

&gt;&gt;I have an '89 Westfalia camper that seems to be running hot. The temp gauge
&gt;&gt;&gt;tends to run above the red light on the gauge,
&lt;snip&gt;
&gt;My 83 Westfalia has a similar problem. I &quot;believe&quot; that this is not normal.
&lt;snip&gt;

&gt;No matter how hard I pushed on the gas pedal the temp simply stayed put.
&gt;How about everyone else? What are the readings of temp of your vanagon?

 Yes, mine too. No deviation from normal mid-gauge operating temperature 
conditions no matter how abusively I drive. I've only heard the electric fan 
kick-in a few times in summer-stationary-rush-hour, and that goes away fast 
if I up the throttle to a fast idle and circulate some water past the rad/fan.
        BUT.... when the beast is low on water and the pump sucks air it 
only takes about 15 seconds to put the needle past HOT-YOU-IDIOT and make 
the little red eye wink at me furiously. Partly plugged lines 
(corrosion-crud and metal-chips?) will push your temp up to a higher 
steady-state reading without terminal meltdown, soak/flushing helps then. 

        QUESTION: Has anyone seen a replacement rad for these beasts with a 
filler cap in it.? The front light grill is held in with 5 Dzus (sp?) screws 
and is a damn sight easier and quicker to remove than 200 lbs of luggage, 
bed mattress, and engine hatch. A filler cap high up front would probably 
save a lot of frustration with coolant problems all around. Any sightings? 
Anyone done a non-VW refit that worked?
