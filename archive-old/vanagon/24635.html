Sad, Sad, Sad, Sad, Sad, Sad, Sad, Sad, Sad, Sad.

I Weep, Weep, Weep, Weep, Weep, Weep, Weep.

&gt;From what I'm told, I'm in the market for a rebuilt AT
transmission for a 1984 Westfalia GL.

Problem:

For the first 5 minutes, shifting is difficult.  Yertle coasts
_at_ about 3000-4000 rpm until, finally, she shifts into the next
gear, etc.  After these first few minutes shifting is nearly
seamless.  I've been told that when the engine and
transmission components heat up,  transmission fluid
is more easily transfered among AT parts and thus
good shifting.  I'm not sure what parts need to be replaced
(seals?) but the bottom line seems to be roughly $1000-$1300
(regardless of the fact that the AT works properly later on)

Yikes!

The transmission shop is willing to put in a rebuilt tranny for about
$250-$300.  Of course, no guarantees if what they're putting in is
somebody elses.  They'll offer a 8 month/8000 mile warranty on
their transmission.


ANY - I repeat ANY suggestions/tips/condolences  will be
more than welcome....


Thanks,

 -Victor
