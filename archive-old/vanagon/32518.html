&gt;&gt;There's only one thing to say:
&gt;&gt;Backup lights?  I don't need to steenkin' backup lights!  :-P &lt;grin&gt;
&gt; &gt;- Mike White 
&gt;
&gt;Amen to that!  I'll add backup lights to my little list of &quot;optional
&gt;accessories for Bugs/Buses&quot; (remember last time I wrote about unnecessary
&gt;fuel gauges. . .figuring,  that's what you got an odometer for.)  Anyway,
&gt;the distinct screaming and &quot;crunch!&quot; of pedestrians underneath my Bus always
&gt;lets me know when I've backed up sufficiently.

For those of you who don't wish to leave a trail of mangled corpses in your 
wake Sears sell a Halogen backup light with loud beeper, in a unit that 
replaces your regular backup lightbulb. Now that's a gimmick you just gotta 
have. Buy two for stereo effect. :)  Tim
