Subject: grit stats


Hey, Joel!  -  How about a grit stat file on us all?  You can
enter who's tried it, who hasn't, what they thought of it, what
they put on top of it, things they might have used it for other
than eating (like glueing doorpanels or headliners).  Ideally,
we should be able to all access your flat-file data base, so that,
for example, on a given day, we could ask ourselves questions like:

Who on this list drives a blue van, has tried grits, but doesn't
like topping on them?  If you are going to be a bona fide statistician,
it's important for you not to lose control of snippets of valuable
information!
