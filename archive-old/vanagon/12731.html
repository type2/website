Subject: Re: 83 wasserboxer swap?


Here are my thoughts...

For an '83 wasserboxer, and a person who does not want an ongoing &quot;hobby&quot;,
stick with a wasserboxer replacement.

I think the easiest watercooled conversion is the diesel to golf/jetta gas
engine route (thats what I did). The engine mounts and bellhousing need no
modifications, but depending upon what gas engine you drop in, some engine
compartment mods are needed. The '92 jetta engine that I used required a
small area of the front left part of the engine compartment wall to be
beaten out to allow the front of the intake manifold to fit, (actually
only needed to get the engine in, once in there is enough clearence). A
twin cam engine, due to the crossflow head design and subsequent air
intake ducting probably would need more bodywork, maybe even relocating
the engine hatch higher. The earlier digifant engines had a slightly
different intake manifold, with the air intake coming into the manifold
at the front of the engine and required a 5&quot; diameter hole cut in the left
wheel well for the throttle flap and linkage.
G-60 engines could &quot;probably&quot; be made to fit, but I would guess that again
the hatch would have to be relocated higher.
VR-6? Don't know, but I am willing to try if any has a spare :)

Buick V-8s and Ford V-6s (I think it was the 2800 or 3000cc Ford v-6 that
was a popular swap in S. Africa) requires more clearance above than the
stock hatch arrangement provides and a rim has to be built,
somewhat screwing-up sleeping arrangements.


With any non-stock transplant there will problems. How big those problems
are will be determined by the expertise and EXPERIENCE of the mechanic.
