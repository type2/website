Hi Mike!

That's me who just sent you about ten forwarded messages re: tires. I've
been keeping a file. You can also check out the ftp stuff.

Many people have said the Conti's don't have traction on snow or even wet
 pavement. And they get stuck on wet grass.

Highest accolades go for the Michelins. Be careful you get the rating for
55 PSI. Many people say that many dealers will tell you there is no such
thing. Keep looking. I suspect that the mail-order places may be your best
bet (unless Ackworth has some giant tire dealer).

I haven't bought any yet, and haven't had any experiences in wet weather.
I'm using Conti's which I notice are maxed out at 40 PSI, not 55.

Everybody agrees to get 6 ply and to make sure the load rating is high
enough and to get 55 PSI rating, too. Avoid Conti's; get Michelin, though
a couple of the Japanese tires get good ratings.

Good luck!
