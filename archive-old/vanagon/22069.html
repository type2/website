Subject: Free VW?

I know this isn't a Type II question but someone a while back posted
something about a free Karmann Ghia with no engine or trans in Iowa.  I've
looked through the postings that I've saved and can't find it.  Does anyone
remember it or know if its still available?  I am awaiting your responses.
