&gt;I have some confusion regarding the timing notches on the flywheel:
&gt;-------------^---------F
&gt;-----u-----------------R
&gt;When setting the timing (Temp Sender II disconnected, revs at 2000 rpm)
&gt;which notch gives the required 5 degree ahead of TDC? In other words
&gt;which notch is which if either?

Bentley says the notch on the FRONT (front is front of car) pulley, that is,
the pulley notch closest to the engine itself, is the proper timing notch.
