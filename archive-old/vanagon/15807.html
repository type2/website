&gt; I was wondering if there are any other road trippers without money out

&gt; are national parks?  Are there any other options?  Can I write anything but
&gt; questions?

The best book we've found is one called &quot;California Camping&quot; by Tom Stienstra. 
It's updated yearly and has all the details you'd need (assuming you're 
interested in camping in California :) The book, alas, is not free.
