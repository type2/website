Lawrence,

Thanks! Is this the recall number? VWoA told me that is was a technical
bulletin/upgrade reference, not a recall number.

Any opinions?

&gt; &gt; Hi All,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I have yet to turn up definitive proof that VW actually recalled the
&gt; &gt; digifant ECU's.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I've confirmed that VW did revise the digifant several times throughout
&gt; &gt; each production year and that all Vanagon Digifant ECU's are
&gt; &gt; interchangeable. The difference being that each later model is
presumably
&gt; &gt; better.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; So, if anybody actually has a VW recall number, PLEASE POST IT!
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I've searched the archives and found lots of info, lots of numbers, but
no
&gt; &gt; official VW recall number.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Thanks for the time and help!
&gt; &gt;

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; btw - I ended up buying a used ECU from a '90 for $200, haven't gotten
it
&gt; &gt; in the mail yet.
