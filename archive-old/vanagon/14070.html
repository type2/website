Gosh, sorry I missed the ceremonial burning of something previously
important.  You guys do the best stuff when I can't be there.  Sorry,
Larry et al, but I had to leave to be back here today (Sunday) to
catch up on several things.  I was hoping you wouldn't do anything
exciting after I left.  I thought I told everyone there I was going
to be leaving Saturday afternoon, but I guess not everyone heard me.

Anyway - showers!  Ugh.  Forget it.  I'm back to the drawing board,
as my idea was a total flop.  This was partly due to high winds
and cold temperatures, but my next angle of attack will be to
work on holding the shower INSIDE the popped up van, so that
there will be no drafts to blow down tarps and leave me in
the dark in the freezing cold like at Red Rock.  I intend to
use an ice chest with a drain spigot at the bottom, to channel
the water out the door, perhaps thru plastic tubing.  This should
function as a shower pan, keeping the feet in warm water.

Anyway, thanks to all of you who brought the delicious gourmet
things to Redrock.  Whether you cooked ahead of time at home,
or did it there in the wild, I think we all thought everything
was delicious.  Considering that we didn't have easy access
to groceries, propane, gas, water, etc., I think we managed very
well.  But next time, Schwarze, there had better be some showers,
hot water, trees, AC, and a hot tub to seat 30!

Along those lines, I'm raring to start planning the next
gathering.  I know we are getting close to &quot;da trip&quot; (brick
tour), but am still up for planning another of these weekend
extravaganzas.  It doesn't have to be elaborate, nor far,
but in order to establish a rough location, could I have
a rough show of hands (replies) as to how many people would
be up for doing something in, say, late April, or early May,
and how far you'd be willing to drive?

Thanks to all for a WONDERFUL trip - Dave S :  this location
was really special - quite a rarity for those of us who've
not spent any time in desert terrain!  :)
