Subject: RE: 6v wipers on 12v bus


&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;It is very easy to produce a solid state 12-6v converters, and cheaply too.  
&gt;&gt;parts are
&gt;&gt;1 power transistor
&gt;&gt;1 zener diode
&gt;&gt;1 resistor
&gt;&gt;1 heat sink 
&gt;&gt;that is it!  we are talking about less than 5 bucks here, kids!  The power 
&gt;&gt;transistor is rated to carry 15 amperes, but I don't think the thing will 
&gt;&gt;supply that much.  5~10 amperes is closer.  
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I built a similar one for 12-9v for a portable cd player and the thing is 
&gt;&gt;simple, but works great.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;

This is probably not a good idea. Such converter is not a converter. It 
eats same amount of power as the 6V wiper does. If the wiper takes 50 watts
to operate the described &quot;converter&quot; will also consumes 50 watts. 

A wiper moter could take 10 amps to operate. This will put a 10 amps current
through the power transistor. You would need to have a fan to blow on the
heatsink of the transistor.
