Subject: '83 vs. '77

Okay, here's the dilemma.  I have the opportunity to buy a '77 Westy.  27k
showing and the interior shows that that may be all the mileage that's on
it.  Full campmobile I believe. (Got sink, reefer, stove.) I've owned
splittys and vanagons.  Never owned a late loaf.  Never done much besides
tune-ups on type 4 motors.  What should I look out for?

Should I sell off my '83 GL and pick up the Westy?  Or will I just be
looking for a Chevy motor to get the power back?

All opinions are welcomed.
