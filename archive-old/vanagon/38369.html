Subject: Re: VAN,B.C.: Body shop recommendations?

The lower track where the sliding door rides is now so rusted that the 
door rollers drop into the holes allowing the door to fall off(!).  I'd 
like to get a new plate welded in there so my door stays on when I open 
it.  And while I'm at it, I'd like to get the door hinge mechanism fixed 
so I don't have to hip-check the door everytime to close it.

cant help you with the door rust, but on the mechanism life is good.  Take yr
door panel off and take both mechanisms out, one at at time might be less
complicated, and gease them up so the parts work and move smoothly.  I did
this to my old 73 just before i sold it, and suddenly the door slid shut on a
feather touch, and open too.  :)
