Subject: uneven idle/rich running
Date: Sat, 1 Jul 95 11:39:48 EDT

1. In the case of the vanagon that could not pass the smog test. The fellow
who smogged our vehicle increased the idle of our vanagon. He said that
few can pass the test at the normal idle of 1000 rpm. He moved it to 1500
and it passed. You may want to try this.

2. For the uneven idle person. Have you tried dosconnecting the idle
stabilizer from the system? You can bypass this device by connecting the
two leads together. If there is no difference, the stabilizer could be the
problem. A second possibility is the O2 sensor. If it is faulty you will
get surges and changes in idle speed. At least check the connections for
both and make sure they are clean and solid. A new stab. will cost around
90.00; a new o2 sensor about 50.00.

Good luck - David C.
