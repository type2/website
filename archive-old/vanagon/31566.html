I have a &quot;weird part&quot; question.  While repairing my Fuel Injection on my 87
Westy my &quot;Bosch Certified&quot; Mechanic diagnosed a failed control unit.  It was
burned and needed to be replaced.  However he also found my Idle Stabilizer
Unit to have what he thinks the wrong part number on it.  According to his
part book, it belongs on an 87 Jetta, Golf or Audi 5000.  The part number on
the Stavilizer is 035 133 455 F.  He says it should be 025 906 457 A.  It
works find with the &quot;wrong&quot; part but the milliwhatever don't attain spec.
 Here's what's weird:  Another vanagon he had in the shop at the same time
had the same (wrong) part number on it as mine.  This seems too coincidental
to be soemthing each of the previous owners would have put in.  To further
confuse issues the mechanics 87 vanagon has the correct part number.

Does anyone have the part number I have on their vanagon?  That number again
is 035 133 455 F.

Thanks to Tim S., Joel and Harvey for helping get to the bottom of this fuel
injection business.
