&gt;Well, whaddaya know-- I learn something new every day. This is the
&gt;first time I've heard of a rear-engine VW losing traction on *anything*
&gt;other than heavy snow or slick ice (been there, done both, wasn't happy).
&gt;
&gt;Anyone else ever been in a FWD vehicle that lost traction going forward
&gt;up a hill or ramp, towing or otherwise? I'm curious how common this is.
&gt;Perhaps the water on the ramp added to the problem, Bradley? I guess
&gt;anything's possible.

Huh?  I don't know about FWD vehicles, but I've certainly had Sean's
experience of losing traction backwards on a hill!  In my dad's 79
bus, I came up Third St. in Morgantown, WV (You out there,
Mr. Anderson?), stopped at the stop sign at the top (a la Cosby's SF
skit), tried to get going again, stalled, and found myself sliding
backwards with all four wheels locked!  On dry pavement, mind you.

Also, I don't know the name of the road, but I once drove the access
road that comes down Cheat Mountain beside I-68 from Chestnut Ridge
Park/Cooper's Rock towards Cheat Lake.  It follows beside the
interstate a while, then turns right and heads off up the hillside.  I
was trying to impress a girlfriend, decided to show her the scenic way
back from Cooper's Rock.  Started up that hill away from the
interstate, and apparently chose the wrong set of ruts.  Found myself
sliding down that one backwards too!  (I'll never forget the look on
her face!)  A different angle of attack and a different set of ruts
solved the problem and put me over the top of the hill real
simple-like.

If you've never seen a rear-engine veedub lose traction on anything
but snow or ice, you should drive in WV for awhile! :-)
