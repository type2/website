&gt;Hah!  Same here.  I had a nice looking Pioneer digital auto-reverse deck in
&gt;the dash.  Biggest piece of junk I have ever owned.  Stopped working one
&gt;day and I was just too lazy to take it out.  The person who stole my van
&gt;was nice enough not to break any windows, but did destroy my steering
&gt;column and rip holes in my paneling to get the 6&quot; Craig speakers out. 
&gt;Go figure.  I go the stealth route now.  Stereo is in the glove box,
&gt;box speakers behind the seats.  Haven't had a problem since!

I replaced the thieves-attracting face plate with an ugly, generic one and
replaced the ergonomically shaped designer knobs &lt;grin&gt; with old, clunky
ones. Worked well so far.

Oh, how do you like my new .sig file? Aaaaarrgh, I know, I'm the nerdiest of
all nerds!... An excuse? Well, I have lots of work and I'm
procrastinating. --
