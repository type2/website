Check out the windtunnel gif on the gopher listserv. Basically it compares
the blunt flat nose of the later Vanagons with that of the rounded
shape of  the early bus (circa '50). The difference in cd is substantial -- 
which raises the question of why VW went to a blunt flat nose shape if it is
less efficient. Joel says its was esthetique to keep up with the style of
the day...but that does not sound like a rational, VW and Germanic answer
to me.....(Form above Function from the company that gave us the beetle
and the rabbit?) DC
