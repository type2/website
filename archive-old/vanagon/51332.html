Subject: Tire chains / Phone #

A few weeks ago some of you asked where you could get tire chains.  I finally 
got a new catalog from The Sportsman's Guide.  Their number is 1-800-888-3006 
or 1-800-888-5222.  They have standard ones, the ones I got, for 34.99 a pair 
or the V-Bar type for 64.99.  Remember to tell them what size tire you have 
and to order extra rubber bungee cords to hold them on.  
I use these chains AND snow tires as I live in the mountains of SE PA where I 
have to compete with many many 4x4's on the way to work in the snow.
