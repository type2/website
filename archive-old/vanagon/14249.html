Subject: dealer dufusses

          we all know by now that there are god and bad dealers.  i
          have a '66 bus with 1600 motor, converted to 12v.  i do as
          much work as possible myslef but need a lift for much of it
          and so go to two different sources in my town, one of which
          is the dealer.  both places meet my criteria.  i ask two
          questions: 1) do you have a mechanic that is very familiar
          with the older buses?   2) will that mechanic work on my bus
          and we he be allowed to stay on it until it's finished?  if
          i get positive answers i'll give them a try.  i make a point
          of checking up on it at least once to make sure they didn't
          lie to me.  i don't expect any shop to let me hang out in
          the bay but i also will not leave my vehicle someplace where
          they will not allow me to sneak a peak once in a while or
          talk briefly to the mechanic.  if  they don't want me
          invloved in that tiny way, i'll go soemwhere else cause to
          me that means they're hiding something.  i have a lot of
          friends who are pro mechanics, car and motorcycle.  they all
          tell me that the mistakes happen when the butthead service
          manager pulls them off a job in order to begin another and
          then they go back to the original at some point.
