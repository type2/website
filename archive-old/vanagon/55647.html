Subject: Questions About Buying Diesel Westi

negatives:
	loud, underpowered. no A/C.  No hydraulic valve lifters --
	needs valve adjustments pretty often.

a quick note:
	gas mileage is not as great as it is said -- maybe a savings
        of 5 mpg.

what to look for:
	have someone drive it (hard), and follow behind.  Too much
	diesel smoke may mean at the very least neglected valve
	adjustments.
	Look for signs of excessive blow-by: too much engine oil
	dripping.

 &gt; I'm in the market for a used Westi and I am trying to decide if a diesel is worth 
 &gt; considering.
 &gt; 
 &gt; If anyone has any opinions or comments about owning a diesel Vanagon, I would appreciate it.
 &gt; 
 &gt; Also, I have never owned a diesel powered vehicle.  I am wondering:
 &gt;     - Are these diesels mechanically reliable?
 &gt;     - How long will they typically last (miles)?
 &gt;     - Are they rebuildable?
 &gt;     - Any potential design problems?
 &gt;     - What should I look for when considering a used diesel Vanagon?
 &gt; 
 &gt; I am aware of the lack of power, and the higher gas mileage is motivating me.
 &gt; 
 &gt; Thanks in advance.
