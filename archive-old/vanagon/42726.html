Subject: Re: awnings, what I've learned

As I posted over a year back to somewhat rave reviews from a few
listmembers, a great way for a cheapo easy to buuild and store
awning on Buses and Vanagons is as follows.  Buy a real nice
quality poly tarp (silver sun resistant best) buy 3 cheapy expanding
awning poles at local RV place U know the ones with the little push in
button to set height.  Take heavy wall (schedule 40?) 1-1.5 inch plastic
tube, water, drain, etc, slice down one side on a table saw with a
pretty thick kerf blade so you remove about 1/8&quot; forming a C shaped
piece.  Do this to a 10 foot or so long piece then cut into 3 even
parts.  For the great simple awning, put the tarp over the driprail
then push the pipe piece over clamping the tarp.  Use the poles on the
other side, rope and tent pegs voila, CHEAP, instant easy awning, no
permanent attachments to the van either, looks and works great.  On
vanagons with the plastic drip rail edging this works a bit better than
on
Buses. On the Bus use a thinner kerf blade when cutting the clamping
tube.

AAAAAAAAAA        DDDDDDDDDD

Bad cross section of how the clamping thingy works, t is plastic tube,
A is awning tarp, D is cars drip rail

Anyway just a proven idea, it all rolls up into a neat little bundle
for under
the back seat BTW.
