Since it's Friday, I'm including a story that happened while working on a 
non-VW car.

I owned an 82 Z28 right out of high school, and thought it was the 
greatest.  I bought it in 1989, and got a warranty with it from the 
dealer(it was, after all, an American car from the early 80s).  Well, 
turns out the bearings were spun in the motor so I got a new engine for 
free(minus the warranty cost).

I wanted a little more power out of it, so I put in a new cam and intake 
manifold, since the rest of the engine was new.  These cars had a fairly 
sophisticated engine computer, which needed to be unplugged BEFORE 
setting the timing.  I didn't know this, and so as I would try to set the 
timing, the computer would compensate by advancing or retarding it to 
keep it where it was.  After trying for about an hour, I just wanted to 
drive it.  I ended up driving all over town with the timing set at about
 15 degrees after TDC , thinking how upset I was because the car felt so 
much slower than before.  Finally my friend looked in the manual and figured 
out that the computer needed to be unplugged(this is the same friend that 
jacked his car up by the radiator, but that's another story).
