Subject: Clear Coat..Good/Bad?

Thanks again for all your thoughts...I'd like to make this paint job last
more that 6yrs (my last $300 two tone enamel job).

What about clear coats...the guys at ONE DAY say that is eventually 
causes a haze...I think it makes the paint look wet/glossy.  Any thoughts?
