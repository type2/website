&gt;&gt;I have an '89 Westfalia camper that seems to be running hot. The temp gauge
&gt;&gt;tends to run above the red light on the gauge, even when it is cool outside.
&gt;&gt;Whin I am climbing a hill of any size, it nears the first of the two little
&gt;&gt;dots at the top of the gauge. I don't notice any power loss, but it just
&gt;&gt;seems really hot. Anyone have any experience with this? I just had my coolant
&gt;&gt;changed and the mechanic told me he thought it was OK.

My 83 Westfalia has a similar problem. I &quot;believe&quot; that this is not normal.
The temp gauge will go higher once it goes into a freeway. The fan will not
be kicked in yet, but I think it is close to be kicked in. I have parked
the Westfalia until I can solve the problem someday.

I also have an 84 GL. The temp gauge on this bus very seldom climbed higher
on any hill driving. It only went higher when the bus was running on 3rd or
above gear for a long time on climbing hills. As long as the bus is able to
run at the 4th gear the temp gauge does not move up, no matter how long and
how steep the hill is. No matter how hard I pushed on the gas pedal the temp
simply stayed put.

How about everyone else? What are the readings of temp of your vanagon?
