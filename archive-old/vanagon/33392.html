Subject: Suburban RV furnaces.

I have some info from the manufacturer on these things.  First off, 
the Eurovan has a Suburban mdl NT-12S installed as OE (thanks to Dan 
Herbert for looking this up).  It is a forced air, 12,000 BTU unit.

Camping World is currently selling this model for $314.10 if you are 
a 'member'

The installation instructions Suburban faxed me show two 2.5 inch 
diameter holes need to be cut in the exterior sheet metal of the 
vehicle.  A face plate bolts on and this provides the air intake and 
exhaust.  The unit cannot be discharged in any direction except 
horizontally.  Amp draw is 2.8.  2 models are available-- NT-12E direct 
vents to the interior thru a grill and the NT-12S uses ductwork for 
routing. Dimensions are:
ht-- 9 1/2&quot;
wd-- 9 3/8&quot;
depth-- 22 1/2 &quot;

Suburban can be contacted at 615/775-2131 and answers questions but 
does not sell direct.

Has anyone with a Vanagon Westy installed one of these?  If so could 
you post where you put it and how you like it??

thanks-
-dan
