Subject: Anyone going to Norwalk, CT This weekend?

HI Volks,
  I was just wondering if anyone from the lists are going to the CVA/VVWCA
Northeast Classic VW show in Norwalk, CT this Sunday?  I'll be in town
Saturday and Will be DJing the show Sunday if anyone wants to hook up with
me let me know.  We can hang out or take in the sites.  I'm going Solo this
weekend. No wife or kids.    Anyway, if your going, at least stop by my
beige Vanagon Sunday and say hi.  Like to put a few faces with some of the
letters I read on the lists.  Take care.
