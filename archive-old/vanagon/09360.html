&gt; Hello,
&gt; 
&gt; ------------ reference to stall experience deleted ----------------

&gt; So, is the cure low risk and worth the effort?
&gt; 

Well, since it doesn't happen very often and all you have to do is
stop and shut down and then start again and the cost for the harness
is $95.00 + tax, I haven't tried the fix out.
