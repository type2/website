Subject: Re: red rock canyon

&gt;Anyway, the suthin' Californians/Arizonians/Nevada-ins?  Are planning a
&gt;gathering at Red Rock (State Park??).  I'm not sure of the date.  David?
&gt;Martha?  It's just a bunch of us VW Type II nerds getting together for
&gt;a campout and what-have-you.  I don't know that there are any scheduled
&gt;events except for Davids ugliest Type II contest (pre-rigged of course ;) )
&gt;Anyway, this will be the second of what I hope are many gatherings like
&gt;this.  Any demonstrations of technical/mechanical know-how will be ad-hoc
&gt;for now.  If yer interested, I think David Schwarze and Martha Rubin are
&gt;the ones kinda coordinating this particular event.
&gt;

Well I am originally from San Jose, CA and I wish I could come hang out with 
you guys.  I think my 58 Dlx would win the ugliest bus contest though.
