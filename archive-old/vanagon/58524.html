Subject: Re: Middle Seat for 87 Vanagon GL Westphalia Camper

A perfect description of my floor!  So, off with the silver rail to see
what's below (still hard to imagine that there's actually a below below
where I already am).

&quot;I'd be surprised if the threaded inserts are missing from the floor on
the camper -- they are there on my kombi, and I just bolted in the rails
from another van (actually, I got the seat and rails from an '82 Westy
-- kinda odd...).

The bolts (and the plastic plugs) are accessible from above, but the
real flooring is corrugated metal.  If you're not down to the
body-colored metal floor, you're not down far enough.  I think by '87,
the campers typically had that raised-square-patterned vinyl flooring --
you'll need to go past this.

On most Vangons, there is another layer of formed foam-padding below the
carpet -- it has a pattern molded into it to fit the corrugations in the
floorboards.  

I don't know if the standard middle two-person seat from a 7-seat van
will fit in a camper with the refrigerator in place -- the one I pulled
this seat from had the refrigerator removed at the time.  It looks
promising, though. My seat is 46&quot; wide, and the space between the
refrigerator and the closed door (on an '80 Westy) is about 48&quot; -- so it
might *just* clear.&quot;
