Subject: the warranty must be over...

Actually, the warranty has been gone awhile, but we did just finish paying
for it...

'90 Vanagon GL.

The passenger-side power-window thingy died with the window about two
inches from the top.  I was blocks from the dealer so I pulled in and took
the liner off of the door.  They had a window regulator in stock ($161US)
and I looked at it to see if I could tell what had happened.  The little
plastic wire-guide that goes at the bottom of the sliding-guide-thing had
fallen off.  I have all of the pieces and none are broken.

My question:  how do I determine if I can get it back the way it was?  The
cable appears to not be long enough for the little guide to go back where
it belongs.  What happens inside the regulator
(motor-driven-gear-box-actuator-thing)?  I imagine that the cable wraps
around it like a line on a windlass. Is there some way to get the cable
back to the &quot;opened&quot; or &quot;closed&quot; position without disassembling the
regulator?

The motor still makes a click-click noise when I push the switch, no
grinding sounds.  I can test the motor itself by unbolting the regulator
from it.

Anyone out there done this before?
