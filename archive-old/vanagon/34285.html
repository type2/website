Subject: Great Bus accessory spotted.

	Driving around in San Jose today I spotted the best accessory on 
a beat up older bus.  The owner had moved the license plate up to the 
rear door and in its place on the engine compartment door was a SMOKE 
DETECTOR.  I laughed for about 5 minutes and then realized what a good 
idea it was. :)

	enjoy, Brian =8)   '79 bus (Soon to have zebra striped curtains)
