&gt;my opinion would be that if you can get 19 mpg on the highway around atlanta,
&gt;that you are driving in the range of 65-70 mph, or maybe a bit higher. if so,
&gt;then you likely get about 14-15 in city driving. for leadfoots, that's likely
&gt;to be normal. :)  problem is, in atlanta, if you are a light-foot, you'll be
&gt;run over by the other folks behind you ... some of which can be quite large
&gt;and of severely mean spirits.

Talk about mean spirited...  You know the intersection of Peachtree Ind Blvd
and I-285?
Well I finally nabbed one! Some disgusting yuppie in a Jeep Cherokee decides
to pull into the left turn lane to turn left at the last minute (rather than
wait in line with all us other shmucks).  Well lets put it this way, I
didn't hit him on purpose but I didn't try very hard to avoid him either.

Don't screw around with someone who just bought a $2,400 car, I always say!
