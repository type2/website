Howdy,

	Today I took another stab at making the bus a little quieter.
	
	I bought a roll of roofing felt, aka DynaMat, and covered the 
rear (RIR) corners of the engine compartment, along the sides, and over
the wheel wells.  

	This seemed to knock the booming down a bit, but for the bang up 
job, I'm going to have to get the upper inside, which is nigh impossible
to reach.

	Also, does anyone have anything to say about using a battery box in 
a bus?  My battery had already chafed part of the paint from its new tray
off, and rust was starting.   I sanded it, re-painted it, and then
put down 2 layers of fiberglass cloth and resin in the tray, and up about 3&quot;
along the walls in there, too.

Thom
