Subject: More on tires.


Hi,
Thanks to all that responded to my request for advice on tires for
the syncro weekender. Here is a summary of the colective list wisdom:

1)The original Michelin's MXL reinforced are no longer available (I learned
this the hard way after many promises from various dealers and weeks of waiting)

2) There seem to be no suitable substitutes in the 205/70/14 size.

3)Most of the people on the list are either running 195/75 (about the same
diameter but with a different aspect ratio) or LT 27x8.5x14 (a larger
diameter, light truck) tire. The larger diameter makes your speedo
run slower, which compensates for the original tendency to overestimate
speed and mileage.  Most of the people swear by their BF Goodrich Radial AT
LT 28x8.5x5.14. Nokias in the 195/75 flavor also seem to give vey good results.

Personally, I was concerned about using an LT tire because of additional noise
(although people running the BFG's say that the increase in road noise was
minimal). I ended up getting Goodyear Wrangler Aquatreds 215/70/14. There
seem to be a decent M+S tire and the increase in size is smaller than with the
LT's. So far I'm happy.  Both the LT 27x8 and the 215/70 fit the spare
tire compartment, but you have to *grunt*

Hope this helps
