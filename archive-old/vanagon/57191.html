     Hi Ed / List,
     
     I understand how this virus could destroy a hard disk so please BE 
     WARNED about it.  However.........
     
     There is no way that this virus could destroy your processor.
     
     If anyone could devise a virus that will destroy a processor by 
     putting it in a infinte loop, they deserve a nobel prize.  Have them 
     contact me, I'll quit my job, and we'll start doing Oprah and Good 
     Morning America for a living.
     
     I would hope that your network administrator would know this.
     
     Respectfully,
     
     'Greg

realize what is
