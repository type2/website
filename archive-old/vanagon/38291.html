Subject: RE: Siezed pancake on table


&gt;My friend has a '73 motor on which he's doing a quick rebuild. (new rings
&gt;only). After putting the heads back on, he has determined that the engine
&gt;will turn counter-clockwise, but not clockwise. What could be wrong?

Uh... he should have installed it in the BACK of the car.   :^)
