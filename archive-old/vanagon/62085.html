Subject: RPM on my 87 GL

I'm asking me about the rpm of my van. 

Would you give me your rpm of your van if

--- he got a automatic transmission
--- when you drive at 100 km/h (or 60 miles/h)
--- it's a westfalia whit all the kit....

My van turn about 3700 rpm at 100 km/h (or 60 miles/h), I think that's a
little too much. Is that right?

Thanks,

87 &quot;GLODE&quot; westy GL
