Me again...

Still a few questions:why do you have to remove the balljoints to take down
the leaves?Are the arms under load so you have to separate them or something
like that?And why should you remove balljoints from BOTH upper and lower arms?
I just want to take off the leaves-the balljoints should be ok,they've already
been replaced some time ago before I got the Bus so I don't have to check them.
So isn't it possible to remove just the arms from the tubes and take down the
leaves?

Thanks again
