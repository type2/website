Subject: gas heaters

Hey,
 I have two gas heaters that I would like to sell.  
1.) Stewart Warner Southwind
    6 volt
    Model # 8335
    Seriel # 15447

2.) J. Eberspacher
    Esslingen/ Neckar
    12 volt
    Made in West Germany
    writing on the ID tag is in German

Both are in good shape and seem to be complete. Make me an offer on one or both.

John
