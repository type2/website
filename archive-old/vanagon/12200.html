Subject: CO Adjustment

My '85 Vanagon barely passed its emissions test this time.

The CO% = 7 (and some change) measured at tailpipe, by the way, not
upstream, my Passat does not even register on this test.

The HC was around 180, max allowable is 220 and the Passat registers 39 on
this test.

So I have been experimenting with turning the CO adjustment screw
counter-clockwise.  My first attempt was to make a full turn of the screw.
This seems to have resulted in no deleterious effects to the running of the
engine.  Should I keep turning?
