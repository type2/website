&gt;   Joel, you're bored? How 'bout helping me solve an insignificant mystery? The
&gt;   Haynes manual I have indicates that all European and UK Type IV engined 
&gt;   buses have Sodium cooled valves. Bentley, which covers only U.S. spec buses
&gt;   shows only the '73 and '74 1.7 and 1.8 liter engines as having them. 
&gt;   Incidentally, they are also the only models to have exhaust afterburning
&gt;   courtesy of air injection. Is there a connection? Were Sodium cooled valves
&gt;   just a fad? Do all the European buses use them, even though they have never
&gt;   had to deal with all that air injection plumbing? I thought one of your 
&gt;   many books might help clear this up. If you don't feel like it, don't 
&gt;  bother - I'm probably the only person on the planet who's curious about this.

Ummm... nope!  I'm also curious about it.  Despite what the manuals say, I
have never seen a 1.7 or 1.8 bus engine with sodium filled valves in it.
The only one I know about is mine, and I had to order them valves speshul.
On the other hand, I can't swear that I've ever seen one of those engines
as it came from the factory, so they could have all had their sodium filled
exhaust valves replaced with the cheap solid ones when they were rebuilt.

Come to think of it, even with one rebuild the engines should still have
the sodium filled valves, because the manuals say they can be reground
once. 

I wish the busses had the &quot;porsche&quot; cylinder heads used on the 914.  At
least some of those heads have exhaust valves with &quot;jumbo&quot; stems (quite
a bit wider than the bus ones).  Those have got to be a lot stronger.

Hey, someone take some pictures at the pizza event tomorrow so'z us 
people who aren't fortunate enough to attend can laugh^H^H^H^H^Hadmire
the festivities.  I'll scan them in and put them up on the WWW.  :)
