Subject: gas heater idea

Hi all-

I keep thinking that propane is a almost ideal fuel for a gas heater.  
Doesn't explode, easily contained, etc.  I had this idea when visiting a 
store which had those &quot;cannon&quot; heaters.  This one was about 7&quot; in diameter, 
and about 14&quot; long.  I was thinking that if you could point that thing down 
the stock ductwork, ... monster heat.  This unit had 40000 BTU/hr output, 
but also had a variable output.  The bummer is that the fan would have to be 
replaced by a 12 V unit, and maybe the ignighter too.  Anyone tried this 
before?  Know anyone who has?  I figure that when yardsale time comes and I 
can find one cheap, I might give it a try.
