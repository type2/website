  ....
&gt; be driving along the freeway at night, flat out and all of a sudden the 
&gt; engine starts to lose power and seems to sputter/miss with little 
&gt; backfires. Ihave to gear down...in 3rd I can keep it going not bad but it 
&gt; runs real rough. What I end up doing is pulling off to the side, leave 
&gt; the engine run and give it a few good revs, then let it sit running for 
&gt; 5-10 minutes before driving again. This usally works for the rest of the 

If I were up flying, I'd say that you had carb ice-ing, and you should
turn the carb heat on. This sounds like the *classic* carb iceing problem.
It happens at night because it is colder. When you pull to the side of the
road, the carb is sucking in less air, so less cooling occurs, and the 
engine heat melts the ice. Of course, I could be wrong...
