Subject: Corvaired 61 Dbl Cab ?

Hi Listernauts,

I recently bought a 61 Double Cab that I hope to pickup this weekend.  It 
will be a driver once I fix the starter.  Anyways, this beasty has an 85hp 
Corvair greenbriar dual carb motor in it that runs fine but has a 
suspect bearing in the cooling fan going out.  Quite frankly, I do not 
care for Corvairs and am planning on replacing it with a tIV 2.0 liter VW 
Bus motor with its stock cooling setup.  The rear engine lid has a 'pivot 
out' setup to allow for the extra length of the Corvair w/o screwing up 
the split window Bus' original components.

The conversion took place in the late 70's and is a Crown Engineering 
unit.  Some friends of mine have suggested to keep the 6 cylinder motor 
in it until it goes, but I dunno.  Tranny-wise it has the big axle 
reduction gear setup with a Transform 3.88 freeway flyer with the ring 
gear in the 'Bug' configuration to accommodate the reverse rotation of 
the Corvair motor.  My question to you all is:  

    Should I keep the Corvair in it till it blows or just go with my 
     intentions of putting the tIV motor in it?  

BTW, to put it all back to stock would be too much work, IMHO.  I have a 
line on some other Dbl Cabs that would be easier to restore to stock.  8-)
