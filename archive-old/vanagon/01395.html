Subject: engine swaps

Bill Layton asks whether fuel injection and wiring gets swapped with the engine,
and the answer is certainly yes to the fuel injection.  FI is personalized in-
tensely to a given engine design, so even increasing the engine displacement
from 2.0 to 2.3 liters, as can be done with aftermarket pistons and cylinders,
might make your FI ineffective.  So the FI, runners, electronics box, etc.
come out with the old engine.

In my case what went in with the &quot;new&quot; Porsche engine was Zenith carburetors,
which required no wiring at all.  Hooking up Porsche alternator/regulator to
Vanagon 12v and starter was not tricky.  And I just realized that I didn't put
fuel pump on my earlier list of problems I had to solve.  Anyway, the Porsche
oil pressure idiot light sender works the VW light ok, Porsche oil pressure
gauge and oil temp gauge are aftermarket items the Vanagon didn't have, and
I'm using the VW coil with the Porsche distributor and a JCWhitney $59 CD ig-
tion unit.

Problems that persist in my project are: finding room for a big enough muffler
(stock Porsche muffler doesn't fit), and low-rpm drivability of the Zenith
carbs (they are great while cruising but they pop a lot when you lift off).
I'm trying to pull together a 2.7 liter engine with the Porsche CIS FI, for
more power and better drivability and mileage.
