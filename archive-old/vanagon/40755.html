Subject: 23 Window Lead

                                           8:11 AM             4/29/96

Checked out the Bug Bash at Vallejo yeterday - saw Thoms 56 but no Thom....

Lots of nice splits around but it was a suprise (to an Aussie) to see the
number of buses that had been cut and lowered........

Anyway,  a guy there (Rick) claims to have a good 23 window.  The bus is
stripped to bare metal, and the trim is out but the running gear still in.  He
says it is rust free and straight (pretty easy to check out if its bare metal)
and all the bits are there (in boxes), except  the middle seat.  The wheel
wells have also been cut and would need new metal...

He's asking $2000 - I'm not in a position seriously consider this bus, but if
I were at home with time, tools and garage I'd certainly be having a look.....

The bus is located in Santa Carlos (sp? near San Francisco).  I have his
number if anyone's interested.

Rob K.
