Subject: turbo or supercharger addition?

Straight off the bat, I don't know much about turbo units, the stresses they
cause or their requirements. I know they compress air going thru the intake
manifold thereby increasing the amount of fuel and air that will burn in the
same sized cylinder by using a turbine driven by the exhaust gases to drive
a fan in the air intake lines... A supercharger on the other hand robs the
engine of a little power to drive its own fan...

I was wondering if anyone knew the additional requirements in terms of
oil and/or cooling both the unit and the compressed air, and the additional
stress either would place on the flat 4 engine...

Thinking about the exhaust routing, it doesn't seem feasible to use a turbo
unit as far as I can see just because the exhaust piping doesn't really allow
it. A supercharger might, but since I don't really know what I am talking,
it's only idea.... Anyone know a good book on supercharger and turbos that
will go into detail about the additional stress on the engine due to larger
than expected air-fuel amounts being burned?

If there is a way I can keep the wasserboxer and get a little more power or
better mileage (ok, the turbo or supercharger aren't going to change the
mileage I suppose), I would like to investigate them a little...
