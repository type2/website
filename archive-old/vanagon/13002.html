Subject:       Vanagon camper top seals

I am replacing the perimeter seal on the pop-top of my '87 and i have 
2 questions:

1.  the guy i bought the bus from gave me the seals.  i just looked 
at them now and i see they are different from the original.  the 
original is just as the Bentley manual shows; a wire-clip edge with a 
flat piece of rubber 'feather' that forms the seal.  this replacement 
has the wire clip edge but a different seal; it is composed of a 
round 'tube' of rubber with a short(er) feather edge for the seal.  
it also seems to extend more perpendicularly from the clip edge...
anybody know about these??

2.  the original seal didn't appear to be glued on in any fashion.  
the clip edge has completely rusted away and so it fell off.  this 
replacement seal seems to fit looser so i was thinking of using 3M 
weather strip seal to fasten it.  any thoughts?  i know the clip edge 
can be pinched tighter but it seems like it would be hard to close it 
narrower uniformly for the entire lenght.
