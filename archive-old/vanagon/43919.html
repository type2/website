Subject: Re: oil pressure vs. oil temp gauge?



I vote for BOTH! If the oil pressure drops, it is not necessarily a sign 
that the oil is hot...you could be on the verge of engine failure. By having 
both gauges, you can, over a period of time, be able to find the 
relationship between oil temp and pressure for your engine and know if your 
engine is running ok...or if you have a problem.
