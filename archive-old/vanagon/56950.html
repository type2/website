&gt; Girot's Garage, Inc.
&gt; 3500-A  20th Street E.
&gt; Tacoma, WA 98242-1728

&gt; ..................... From their catalog:
&gt; &quot;SPARE TIRE GAS TANK
&gt; Offered as a standard accessory to Mercedes Benz in Europe for years,
&gt; this 6-liter (1.5 gallon) reserve gas can fits in the spare wheel hollow
&gt; on 14&quot; or larger rims. Saves space while being safely stowed where it has
&gt; maximum protection from impact. I have one in my wife's car so she
&gt; doesn't have to deal with freeway lunatics should she ever run out of
&gt; gas. Positive-locking cap eliminates leaky, stubborn and potentially
&gt; rusted screw type caps. Fits most applications.  12-3/8&quot; in diameter.
&gt; Made in Germany.
&gt; 
&gt; Item No. 92118 Spare Tire Gas Tank ....... $79.95&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; the donut tank comes with a flexible metal pouring spout that, when not
&gt; in use, attaches to the end/edge of the tank.
&gt; 
&gt; also of possible interest:
&gt; &quot;Quality German &quot;Jerricans&quot; (Gas Cans)
&gt; While traveling across the desert sands, in dire search of far off lands,
&gt; jerricans strapped to the Jeep were few, my desination, Timbuktu. You
&gt; don't have to trek across the Sahara Desert to understand the benefits
&gt; of these gas cans. Just think of the last time you were trying to get the
&gt; screw top off a &quot;typical&quot; steel gas can with a hammer! Try doing it after
&gt; corrosion has set in! This jerrican has an easy flip up lid that opens
&gt; quickly without fuss. The vented fuel spout attaches the same way without
&gt; any fuel leakage or spillage. Special anti-corrosion coating inside
&gt; provides lifetime protection against chemicals and gasoline.
&gt; Comes in 20-liter and 10-liter steel cans. The very best in fuel storage
&gt; for going to Timbuktu or just filling up the 'ol lawn mower.
&gt; 
&gt; Item No. 92310  10-liter (2.64 gallons) Jerrican ....... $79.95
&gt;          92312  20-liter (5.28 gallons) Jerrican ....... $84.95&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; both of these are pictured with the flexible metal pouring spout (that
&gt; stores on the handle of the tanks).
&gt; 
&gt; i've got the little donut can and kinda like it. :)

To all Listees in the TORONTO area:

Would one of you check if these doughnut gas cans can be had through
OWASCO in Whitby?
