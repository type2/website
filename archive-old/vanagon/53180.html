Subject: What are the aluminium bars across the rear hatch for?
Date: Mon, 16 Dec 1996 22:52:17 -0000

I have seen some Caravelles (Vanagon in USA) including my 1984 GL with a
sort of grille across the rear windscreen. Two horizontal aluminium bars
about 2&quot; apart covering the bottom part of the windscreen.

What are they for? Dogs? Luggage? Decoration? The PO said they were for
nothing.
