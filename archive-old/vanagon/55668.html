Subject: OEM Flourescent Light Source

Vanatics,

I've come across a source for replacement (or additional) 12VDC flourescent
light fixtures that are the ones that VW used in 87-89 Wolfsburg and
1989-1991 Carat model Vanagons (perhaps others as well).

The light fixture is:
Thin Lite Model 171
Made in USA, 8W
17-5/8&quot; long x 2-3/8&quot; wide x 1-1/8&quot; thick
The bulb is 11-1/4&quot; long, 8W and is included.

Price: $29.95

These are very nice units compared to those at JCWhitney (I have one of those
in my 87 Syncro) and I can find no visible differences to the ones VW used.
 I believe that these are the exact model that VW choose as OEM.

They can be purchased at:
RV Accessory Center
14324 E. Valley Blvd.
City of Industry, CA  91746

Phones: (818)330-0091, (818)330-0168
Fax: (818)968-4866

They'll be moving to a larger facility a few miles away April 31, 1997.
 After then they can be reached at:

RV Accessory Center
14153 E. Garvey Ave.
Baldwin Park, CA  91706

Phones: (818)338-2076

Their hours (Pacific time of course) are:
M-F:     9-6 
SAT:   9-5
SUN: Closed

I spoke with Victoria Simpson there (she was very nice) and she said that
they can take credit card phone orders or check/credit card orders through
the mail.

They do not have a WWW page yet, but can be reached via email at:
RAMVAN1_at_aol_dot_com

I don't have any vested interest in the supplier, although I am considering
replacing the cheap JCWhitney light with one of these nice ones.

Regards,
Jim Davis
