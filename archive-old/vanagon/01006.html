Subject: Re: 73 1700 van timing questions

&gt;        I recently acquired a '73 1700 van.  I need to know to where, when
&gt;static timing per Mr. Muir's guide for idiots' instructions, I should be


Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but static timing the Vdub stopped pre1970.
I've had one distracted mechanic static time a '78 of mine, burned out two 
valves in less than 100 miles. Get a timing light,, and get one with the 
inductance clip that just grips #1 spark wire, as fighting with Bosch wire
sets and buried nippleless plugs is no fun. The reason your timing plate is 
gone is probably because the degree scale decal disappeared years ago and 
the two nicks on the plate, one at 0deg, the other at your engines setting 
don't look too important. The scale is useful for checking spark advance, 
ie. if your distributer is really working. Sooo... get a compass, protractor 
and some stiff card/flat tin and make one up. It doesn't have to reside in 
the engine
compartment, only long enough to set the timing.  regards fer now.
