&gt; Ok, I swear I'm right now.... Wolfsburg Westy weekenders were made '84-'87

&gt;  Looks like Mr Terminology better get his sh*t  together.......  :&lt;)

Is that me?  Blush.   :)

Chris goes on to say:

&gt; Uh, Oh..... you have just elicited a response from that damned  &quot;Mr correct
&gt; terminology&quot; again...
&gt;
&gt;What you have is a '86 Vanagon Wolfsburg Edition (non-GL) &quot;Weekender Westy&quot;.
&gt;or affectionately dubbed the &quot;WWW&quot; for short.

Not necessarily a Wolfsburg.  The standard Vanagon Camper model also had this
arrangement.

I didn't see a smiley face  [  :)  ] above regarding 'damned  &quot;Mr correct
terminology&quot; '. You're not starting to get serious about this stuff are wou?
