Subject: Re: Ignition switch barrel and tumbler replacement?

No quote.  Sorry.  But the ignition on my machine gave up two
years ago.  I could turn it and the happy lights would shine
into my eyes but it wouldn't turn the motor over.  As my beast 
(we call it 'The Beast') is a '74 I didn't want to replace the 
whole mechanism.  Dineros, you know.  Anyway, five dollars
for a marine switch (rubberised brass push button) connected
to the hot wires and installed out of sight under the dash
solved the problem.  N to start the beast I turn the key
to get the lights and nonchalantly reach under the dash for
a quick jab at the marine switch.  Fire!  
If all is good the lights extinguish and we're on our way.
I rationalize it by telling myself I have aquired a anti-theft
device for five dineros...  :)
The only drawback is that one must release the button at the
point of ignition--wouldn't want to fry the starter now,
would we?
