&gt;Also a problem is the plumbing to convert the coolent water into the copper
&gt;tube.
Not to mention finding the coolant water in my air cooled.  Did anyone else
ever take auto-mech in high school?  We always had a special: Antifreeze
test, change if necessary. $20 for Volkswagens. (This was in 1977, before
the Rabbit)
