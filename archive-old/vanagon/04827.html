Subject: Planning Trip--Tips?


Hi Gang,

Yep, so I'm quittin' my job* and taking three months in the new year to do 
some serious travelling in our new (well, to us, anyway) camper.  It's a 
76, and aside from some rust in the wheel wells, etc, a coupla split 
boots (cross yer fingers for the CVs!), and a sink pump that doesn't 
work, it's in pretty good shape.  We--that's my partner Christa and 
me--have got few months to fix any problems we can find and give the old 
camper a good shake-down before setting off.

* Shhhh.  Don't tell my boss, ok?

Comments and suggestions from Steve, Sami, and others on Lee Ann and 
Sean's planned trip TO Vancouver were helpful.  Our day-to-day car has 
got most of the stuff from Steve's 'essentail tool list' in the trunk:  I'm 
also going to be bringing spare clutch and throttle cables.  

I'll give you folks the planned route for the trip.  Any suggestions on 
things to bring/see/do/avoid/etc. would be great.  We want to stay off 
interstates as much as possible.  We're both into pop culture stuff, so 
any 80 foot brontosauruses (already been to Wall, SD) or 
World's-Largest-Perogy-On-A-Fork tips would be appreciated.  

Ok, here goes

Leave Jan 1st 1995:
Vancouver, BC to Longview WA, cross the Columbia R, head for the coast.
Hit coast around Tillamook, OR and bop on down 101 to somewhere near SF
Cruise the wine country
Head to Reno, then down Hwy 95 to Las Vegas, detouring for Death Valley.
Las Vegas to Grand Canyon, along Northern roads into NM to Santa Fe, to 
Alamogordo, back to San Diego along southern routes through NM, AZ, CA.

Down the Baja, ferry to Mazatlan, down the coast to the southern border.
Maybe to Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Costa Rica... who knows?

Out to the Yucatan, and back up to Brownsville TX along the Gulf Coast.

Bop along the Gult Coast into FL, then up into GA, SC (see friends near 
Charlotte), NC, and so on up into Maine.  Uh oh!  It's getting cold!  
(Hopefully I can get the auxillary gas heater I bought working!).  To 
Nova Scotia, (over to Newfoundland?), on to PEI (Christa loves Anne of 
Green Gables), NB, QUE, see friends in Toronto/Hamilton Ontario, through 
MI, IL, IA (see my Grandma!), up through Minnesota, into Manitoba, and 
west back to Vancouver.  

We got three months, 'cause Christa in taking a 3 month leave of absence 
for this trip.  

Any 'must sees'?  Any thoughts/comments/sugestions/etc. would be helpful.

Something I was thinking about related to this trip: is there a list of 
good (non-dealer) VW specialist shops around?  The dealers are way too 
$$$ for me.  Maybe it would be a good idea to get a state by state (prov 
by prov) list of such places together for this list, as a faq or 
something.  It'd sure be nice to know of a good place to go if you 
encounter problems on a trip.  Thoughts?

BTW, bought oil pressure and temp (w/ dual sender) senders and gauges 
yesterday, as consensus seems to be these are a good insurance policy 
against cooking one's engine.  Maybe the spare tire/anti-seize lug bolt 
theorem holds here as well?
