&lt;&lt; Well, a close friend just crashed his diesel Westy, and now I have the
 opportunity to get a full Westy set-up to schlop onto my 1986 Syncro
 Kombi.

 Should I?  I mean, I'd like to have a Syncro Westy, but the prices are
 stupidly high, and I have this fairly-low-miles Kombi that I paid
 dirt for.  But the Kombi is fairly straight and totally stock -- no
 offensive additions or options 'cept the 4WD.  Vanagon-era Kombis are
 extremely rare in the US, and I kinda hate to chop a hole in the roof, &gt;&gt;


IMO dont do it!!  just as you've said - the thing that makes your van unique
is that it is a late watercooled Kombi (a rarity in it's own right) and a
syncro to boot!!
do you know of any others????
then why destroy a rare original?????
believe it or not - Vanagons will become collectable in the near future -
especially odd models like yours and mine..

'83.5 GL 9 passenger sunroof .....a rarity also....
(when was the last time (or only time) you saw a FULL LENGTH middle seat in a
vanagon??...
