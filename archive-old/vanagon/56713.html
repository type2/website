I DO have an oil leak, so that has to be it.  Although I have no idea how 
to fix it.  I'm sure I can locate the leak once I get in there.  Many 
people mentioned a &quot;valve cover gaskets&quot; leaking.  What would I have to 
do to fix this?  Order new gaskets?  I am familar with the valves, I just 
don't know the best way to go about fixing the problem.  

Any suggestions would help me out a lot!

thanks,

kyle
