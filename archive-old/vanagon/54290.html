Subject: Re: Busses for sale in San Franscisco

With regards the add:

&quot;VW '90 W.FALIA 25K $20,950. VW
'87 Clearance. 707-584-1199 Dlr&quot;

The '90 Westfalia is a Weekender - not a full camper. The '89s he has
for sale have 72,000 to 80,000 miles, some on rebuilt engines. They are
all priced at $18,900.

All of the vans here are quality redone in the dealers' shop. 

If the '90 had been a full camper, I would have bought it in November.
I was sad to here that it was not!
