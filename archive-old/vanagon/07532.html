&gt;&gt;&gt; Anybody know if they're still available new?

&gt;&gt;Nope.  Sorry Evan.  VW EOL'ed the Vanagon Syncro's in 1991.

I once noticed that the comsumer report had a very poor report about Synchro 
vanagons. It said that Syncro's MPG at less than 15mpg something like that.
It also said many bad things about the 4WD mechanism of Synchro. This might
have contributed to EOL of it.

It seems the consumer report never said anything good about VWs. The only
good cars are always Japanese cars. The funny thing is I never need to replace
timing belts from any of my VWs and Volvos. But isn't it a sound recommendation
that all Accords replace timing belts at 65kmile or be prepared for new 
engines?

No matter what they said about VWs, I am happy with my two bugs (long gone)
and two vanagons (no timing belts of course).
