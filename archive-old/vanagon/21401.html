Subject: Ottawa area VW show *UPTE*
Date: Sun, 23 Jul 1995 10:01:05 -0400 (EDT)

This VW show in Embrum is on August 6th not August 19th &amp; 20th as I had
previously posted.  It is a one day show with camping available Sat. nite.
I will be posting more information from a fax I am to recieve shortly.  I
will not be able to attend this show as I have made previous committments
for this weekend thinking that this show was on the 19th &amp; 20th.
Sorry for the mix-up.

Cheers

Frank
