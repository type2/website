Subject: Re: where to stay when you're away?

     
     
     Where I stop depends upon where I am.  (profound, eh?)  When I am on 
     Interstate highways I look for the brown signs that denote parks.  
     There are often blue signs that have a tent on them.  These are 
     usually KOA's or similar family run campgrounds the serve for me.  I 
     like hot showers.
     
     I've done alot of 'roadside' camping while on kayaing trips.  In the 
     mountains I've be comfortable  at wayside picnick grounds (unless 
     posted), country stores/gas stations, churchs (always be respectful) 
     and such.  I also use dirt roads when I can find them.
     
     Asking nicely at local establishments can lead to interesting 
     alternatives also.
     
     The paranoia factor varies but I have never had a problem (outside of 
     my own imagination), though in dense population areas (or where things 
     look shady) I'll opt for a hotel/motel.
     
     happy holidays !
     
     john

okay,  here's my dumb question for 1995!   When you're cruising along en 
route to your destination, and decide it's better to make it a 2 day drive 
rather  than go straight through, and 1, you didn't bring your list of state 
parks with you, and 2, you are not sure of the type area you're in (crime 
ridden?, etc), and 3, you just don't want to spend a lot of time looking 
around, and would detest staying in a KOA....and refuse to camp out in some 
hotel.... whoaaaaaa,  
     
Where would you stay?  Truck stop? Mall parking lot? All night burger joint?
 I need help for this one in case I run out of pills...  Thanks for any
replies...
