&gt; What i thought initially to be a carburator problem in my '73 bus is
&gt; manifesting now as a spark/distributor problem. My bus seems to be
&gt; running in 3 cylinders, maybe 2. After checking the spark from the
&gt; distributor with an inductive light i noticed that cylinders 2 and 4
&gt; were getting a spark unevenly and once in a while... when taking the
&gt; wire plugs from cylinders 1 or 3 the engine dies, whereas if i take
&gt; the wire plugs from 2 or 4 (or both), the engine doesn't change revs
&gt; at all and keeps running as before. Now, if i hold #4 wire right next
&gt; to its distributor hole, the cylinder starts catching sparks and the
&gt; engine seems to make an effort in increasing revs...

Funn, I *just* experienced this a couple of weeks ago.  Turned out to be
the plugs.  I had Motocraft plugs in it and when I pulled them and
replaced with Bosch, the problem went away.  Symptoms were the same
right down to the &quot;holding the wire next to the distributor hole&quot; thing.
&gt; 
&gt; The points seem to be set correctly (dwell ~50 and remains +-1 when
&gt; increasing revs). I thought it might have been a problem with the old
&gt; and filthy spark plug wires that the bus had when i bought it, but
&gt; this morning i replaced them with new ones and the problem is still
&gt; there. I also changed the distributor cap, but didn't help. I'm not
&gt; sure where to go from here... could it be a bad condenser? The
&gt; distributor is a 009 mechanical advance. Any ideas?

I have harped about this before, but the 009 mechanical advance is not a
good choice for your '73 if it has the stock carbs.  Put the stocker
back in and prepare to be amazed at how much better it runs.
