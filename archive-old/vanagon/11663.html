 Richard,
	Sorry it took me so long to get back to you.  I find out how my 
schedule goes week by week.  I am interested in attending the Group 
Gathering and would like to know if you need any help for the community 
meal on Friday night?  I plan on getting there about 3 pm and will be 
bringing my wife and my dog.  We can only hang out one night.  Send 
me a note if I can be of any assistance or give me a call. (you'll probably 
have to talk to the answering maching if you call.)  See ya there.

 Myles (662-0671)
