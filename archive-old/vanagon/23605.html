&gt;I notice that in the amendments to the 156 page &quot;V.A.G. Workshop Manual
&gt;Volkswagen Transporter; Four-wheel drive 5-speed manual gearbox 094 and
&gt;final drive&quot; it says that when changing the clutch on Syncro vehicles the
&gt;regular manual is wrong--that you should change the clutch by taking the
&gt;engine out not the transmission. They seem to think it is less work to
&gt;remove the motor than to remove the transmission. 
&gt;
&gt;&quot;When working on the clutch, the engine should be removed *not the gearbox*
&gt;as indicated in the Workshop Manual. This reduces the work to be performed
&gt;on syncro vehicles.&quot;

I concur.  I had the clutch replaced in my Syncro a couple years ago (Yes, I
considered doing it myself, but I wimped out) and the mechanic at the VW
dealer said that the engine does NOT need to be removed, but that it does
need to be removed from it's mounts and lifted a few inches to be able to
remove the transmission.  It took a little calling around to find a mechanic
that had prior clutch experience with the Syncro.
