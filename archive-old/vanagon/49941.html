Subject: The Inuvik Run -- Boya Lake

The Inuvik Run -- Boya Lake

Wednesday 7 August 1996

0920 -- Depart Wolf Creek Campground for Boya Lake.
1610 -- Arrived Boya Lake.  313 miles in 6 hours 50 minutes.  None
of the others are here.

I've no idea where the others have gone.  Passed Tobin &amp; Gary at a
rest stop.  Bought fuel at the junction of the Cassiar &amp; Alcan. 
While standing in line to pay for my gas a woman tugged on my
sleeve, asked if I owned 'that old Volkswagen'.  When I admitted my
guilt she said 'Would you mind moving it?  We want to buy gas.'  At
the time she asked the question the girl behind the counter had my
credit card and was doing the paper work.  I told the woman --
obviously an American -- I'd be right with her.  

'No, I mean would you move it RIGHT NOW.'

The place was crowded.  There were several people in line behind
me, all waiting patiently to pay for their fuel.  Their vehicles
were parked at the pumps they had used.  People waiting to refuel
were sitting in their vehicles.

I said I'd be just a moment.  But that wasn't good enough for the
American Lady.  She started tugging at my sleeve again.  I wheeled
around and gave her the verbal equivalent of a twenty-one gun
salute that blasted her to shocked attention and right out the
door, where she scurried to rejoin her jowly middle-aged husband in
the cab of their GMC pickup towing a forty-foot fifth wheel.

After my outburst the place was dead silent, everyone intently
examining post cards, bags of Cheetos and the like.  The girl
behind the counter handed me my credit card and gave me the bill to
sign.  She smiled at me.  &quot;I guess she expected me to run along
side while you signed this.&quot;

I found it necessary to check my oil again.  And re-do the windows. 
Then check the air pressure.  I'm old.  I move slow.  It was half
an hour before I was done.  The jowly driver of the fifth wheeler
sat jazzing his engine the whole time, his brow-beaten wife sitting
as far from him as the cab allowed.  I felt ashamed for abusing her
but it was obvious she was used to it.  I've a hunch she hadn't
sought me out on her own volution.

-----------------

Boya Lake is the cleanest campground I've encountered on the trip. 
The scenery is magnificent, the weather threatening rain but the
sky is clear to the east.  I set up camp and begin splitting
firewood.  Over the next few hours the remaining Inuvikerrs
straggled in.

Tobin is having electrical problems.  Jack has loaned him his spare
alternator but the problem -- failure to charge -- persists.  If
the problem is in the wiring there's the possibility he's fried the
replacement alternator as well.  I offer my multi-meter.  He shakes
his head.  

Jorge &amp; Yvette, Jack, and Eddie gravitate to my fire.  We discuss
the next days run.  The itinerary calls for them to travel to
Telegraph Creek, a ghost town on the end of an unpaved road.  I've
had enough gravel roads and opt to continue south alone.  We talk
about a mythical 'next' run.  Baja is mentioned, probably by me.

Krista comes by.  She wants Jack to lend her his voltage regulator. 
He gives me a startled look, which I mirror.  He does not have a
spare.  She persists.  We are a bit shocked by her insistance. 
Jack has already given up his spare alternator.  Until the Mango's
electrical problem is properly diagnosed, bolting on Jack's one and
only regulator could leave both vehicles disabled.  

There are enough auxiliary batteries among the group to keep
Tobin's bus running forever, recharging them in the other vehicles
-- assuming we run in convoy.  

Tobin comes by to find out why Jack won't give up his regulator. 
First Jack and then I explain the potential for damaging the unit. 
I get the feeling Tobin doesn't appreciate the risks.  He asks
several questions about the function of an alternator and the
purpose of the voltage regulator but shows no interest in the
battery idea.  Later, I drop by for a private word with him but he
seems preoccupied.  I have a voltage regulator among my spares that
might work with his alternator by winding a ballast resister out of
bailing wire but he doesn't seem to want my help.  It is getting
dark.  I have two trouble lights that would make the work easier
but he says he doesn't need them.  I leave him to it.

My bedtime rolls around and I pointedly bid the others good night,
offering to help transfer the campfire to another fire pit.  They
think I'm joking and continue to sit around my campfire burning my
firewood and keeping me awake.  I go down to the lake, fill my five
gallon bucket with water and douse the fire with a volcanic
eruption of smoke, soot and cinders.  They get the idea.
