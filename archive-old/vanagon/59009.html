Subject: Bad Temp Sensor?

My 82 Westy has developed a strange problem that I hope some of ya'll
can help me with.  When the engine is cold, it starts and drives OK. 
But as it warms up (either the weather or the engine) it begins to run
faster and richer until it just begins to dump gas into the cylinders. 
It begins to smoke and runs really rough.  I believe that it is some
sort of temperature sensor that is going (or has gone) bad. 
Unfortunately, I dont have a Bentley book yet and I dont know where the
sensor is and how I can check it.  I have checked all the connectors off
of the pig-tail and with the exception of taping up a few breaks in the
insulation, there seems to be no broken or disconnected wires.  Can
anyone give me some insight or instructions?
Thanks, Chaz
