I know this a real long stretch, but...

When cleaning up my '88 Westy throttle body, just after I had put it 
back together I turned the key breifly (didn't start it), before I 
remembered to check the throttle switch setting. The key was on for 
maybe 5 seconds during which I heard the fuel pump (?). I went back 
to check the switch &amp; there was a strong gas smell. I checked all the 
lines I could find &amp; couldn't see anything I'd knocked loose. Is 
there a normal reason for this to happen?
