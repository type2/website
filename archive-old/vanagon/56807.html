Subject: Web page move...

Hi Everyone.  Due to the fact that our main web server at work is 
dying, and a new policy on work pages is coming down, I have moved 
all my web pages to:

http://syncro.cr.bcit.bc_dot_ca/hyates

This is my desktop pc running NT 4.0 Server with IIS at work.  Be 
easy on the old thing.. it's only a P75!!

For people that have links to my page, please update prior to March 
14/97.

Thanks,
Harry
