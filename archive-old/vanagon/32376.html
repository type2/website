Subject: Re: Van Update 

i had the same trouble with a transmission once.  I had taken it out of a bus
that had run into a tree pretty hard,  so i suppose the hockey stick bent in
the crash.

You might try painting the inside of the headlight buckets with silver paint,
and switching to halogen bulbs.   The halogens make such a difference.  I
reccomend them for everyone.
