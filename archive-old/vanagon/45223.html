Subject: electric pumps

        O.K., time for some back of the envelope calcs.

  * anyone know (or know how to find out) the flow requirements
    of the water pump? (the pressure is not a problem here:
    both ends of the pump are under same pressure.  we only 
    need to find out how much work the pump has do against
    friction)

  * oil pump: depending on where the cooler is placed, it
    _may_ have to fight gravity, + friction in the cooler.
    anyone willing to throw some numbers out?

  In all, I would imagine the oil pump to be of lesser power,
  since it will only be working as an auxiliary.  


  a word of caution:
  DO NOT UNDERESTIMATE the drain on the alternator.  Even a 
  1/8 HP 12V pump would draw about 8 to 9 AMPS. In the 120V
  world this would be .8 - .9 Amps, but unfortunately they
  do not make those alternators yet :-)
