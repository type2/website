Subject: need 87 syncro owners manual..

     
     Posting this for a fellow westy owner at work.  He just bought an 87 
     syncro westy and unfortunately there wasn't an owners manual in it.  
     So important questions like setting the clock go unanswered.
     
     Does anyone have an extra one, or be willing to copy and send (he'll 
     pay coping and postage costs) to the Denver Co area ?
     
     Feel free to respond to me or him at  jlzoschenko_at_usgs_dot_gov (he works 
     down the hall from me).
     
     
     cheers
     
     john
