So Jeff P. Schneiter says:
&gt; 
&gt; Looks like the credit cards are maxed out and something has to go :(
&gt; 
&gt; Your basic 1972 Westfalia, engine in many many pieces, but it used
&gt; to run :) Body is in good shape, very minimal rust, good brakes and
&gt; transmission. And an aux. heater!!
&gt; 

So will this put you back in the wanna-buy category Jeff?
