Subject: Sticky clutch (fwd)

This is a message I got from a friend of mine regarding the clutch on his 
'77 Westphalia bus. Since I don't know enought about ti yet, I thought 
maybe somebody from the list has a clue/hint. Thanks a lot.

I wonder if anyone has had this problem:

In the morning, when I start my '77 camper in gear with the clutch 
depressed, the vehicle surges forward. After that, it used to be fine 
while driving....Now, though, I'm having problems getting it through the 
gears all the time.


Could there be gunk from a broken seal fouling up my clutch plate ??? Is 
there anything I can test without removing the engine ??? (BTW, I'm 
pretty sure my clutch cable is properly adjusted.)

Help before I drop the engine !!!!!! (or tell me what to look for when 
it's out....)

Thanks,

Morris
