Cetin querries:

&gt;Ric, any insight to what Thom F. might to do his &quot;boss from hell&quot;?

(stuffing tissue paper in my cheeks....)

We could make him an offah he couldn't refuse...

He has shown much disrespect to the family....

and this is business, and not personal, perhaps
Thom's boss should sleep with the fishes...

Daa daaa daaa daaa...daa daaa daaa daaa Dum... (The theme from
the &quot;godfather&quot; for the verbal-musically impared...


The only thing I could figure out is if one of us got the digest
versions from Vintag and Vanagon and then sent it to him via
our own e-mail address...

the other option is for thom to find a cheap internet connection...

I don't think e-mailing or mailbombing Thom's boss would be the
answer...it would probably piss the dweeb off.

Thom...hurry back...we're all going to miss the progress reports
on the '56...eventhough you have put in a non-stock engine
and tranny!  ;-)    only kidding...

Ric
