Subject: Re: westy rollover angle/tipping 



&gt;
&gt;When four wheeling in my 90 syncro westy I get real nervous when the vehicle
&gt;is listing 15 degrees one way or the other. When the vehicle is listing 20
&gt;degrees one way or the other I freak out, get out of the car, and put stones
&gt;under the car so it will not go any further than 20 degrees.
&gt;
&gt;Does anybody think I am too paranoid. I don't know how I can figure out the
&gt;real rollover angle of my car short of buying a big pile of mattresses and
&gt;pushing it over.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;

	Some time ago, I saw a film from VW that had a 70's something
	van going around in a tight circle, increasing
	speed until it rolled onto its side.
	I can't remember any pertinent details (like speed,
	circle diameter, lateral g force), but the van had a
	framework around it with little caster wheels that
	supported it when it rolled. It looked like a lot of
	fun, (with an empty van).
	I also saw a film that featured a BMW bike with
	outriggers and &quot;little caster wheels&quot; for demonstrating
	an ABS braking system. The driver would apply the brakes
	as the bike roared through a wet skid pad, and come to
	a controlled stop with no fuss at all.
