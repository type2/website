Well folks, Among the many things I've been working on is replacing a heater 
cable.  I bought a new one at my local VW parts place, at the very resonable 
price of $15.  I was removing the old one yesterday, but couldn't get it to 
budge.  I was getting real mad and then I thought:  &quot;I'll tie the cable to a 
tree and back up.&quot;  All the trees around here are huge, so I used the next 
best thing, a telephone pole.  I ended up destroying the cable, but 
extracted every last bit of it from the bus.  Anyhow, there is this really 
rich family that moved in next door and I can't imagine what they think 
about me.

   I wouldn't worry too much about what non-VW drivers thought, but
   I'd be worried about trying to force anything into or out of your
   ride. $15 for a heater cable? I hope it's not the kind of heater
   cable I'm thinking of! ($2-$3)

   Maybe try liberal applications of WD40 and/or DMSO next time...
