Subject: RE: 3 feet and as many hands

Peter DePaoli's mad puppeteer story reminds me of friends whose MGA broke
its throttle-linkage far from home.  They hooked up two strings for the
passenger to use: pull one to open throttle, pull the other to close.  After
a few hours they had their timing teamwork down to where they could 
doubleclutch on downshifts.
