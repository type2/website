I was at a junk yard this AM getting a used alternator for my 87 vanagon when
I noticed an 84 camper with its interior camping stove/fridge (hardly used
as the van was a mobile vet truck) in mint condition along with pop-top,
canvas, etc. If anyone is interested the name of the place is Southlawn Auto
Recyclers, 15101 Southlawn Lane, Rockville, Md (310) 294-3322. The usual
disclaimers....blah, blah, blah...
