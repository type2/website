My 70' Westy has remnants of an AC.  The condenser coil?(like the back of a 
fridge) is still mounted underneath the chassis.  The compressor? must have 
been mounted in the engine compt - still has hoses w/fittings.  Evidence of 
a unit mounted under the dash.  I'm going to be removing it - anyone interested.
