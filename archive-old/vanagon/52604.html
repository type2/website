So Lawrence Johnson says:
&gt; I'd like your feedback. Do you Tom, or anyone on the list, know if this
&gt; approach would  violate any laws/regulation in their state/province? 
&gt; Does anyone see any problems or have any changes/ideas to improve upon
&gt; my lazy man's armchair plan?

I don't see anything wrong with the under the vehicle approach to connecting
up the copper tubing.  But.... make sure that all of the tubing is protected
from flying road debris and that the tubing is also protected from any sharp
surfaces it has to pass over/under/through.

Good Luck,
