                      RE&gt;&gt;T-SHIRTS ARE OUT                         12/4/95

My T-shirt also arrived Friday!  Great shirt, came with no problems (re snail
mail) and the design and execution are great!  Nice Job Richard!!!

I really like it, but upon reflection  of my wife's initial reaction &quot;that
color(of the shirt material) is really bad for someone of your skin coloring
(me being Chinese), and yeah, she's right (as usual, sigh )  :-((

Now a shirt color of white, black, gray, blue, red,  . . . . 

So, for now, the shirt hangs in the closet, unworn.  Anybody got one of the
1st issue in new condition (not &quot;good&quot; AKA Grendel (with apologies to  Bob H),
 but new as in unworn)  that is interested in a swap (XL), or is Richard game
for another &quot;iteration&quot;???

Harvey
