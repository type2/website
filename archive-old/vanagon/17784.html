 time. How does this get synchronized?

 You're right, they are not timed to fire sequentially. There is one pulse 
 every other crankshaft revolution &lt;every revolution of the distributor&gt; and
 all 4 injectors open simultaneously. Remember, the injectors are upstream
 of the intake valve, which ultimately controls when the mixture is admitted
 to the cylinder.
