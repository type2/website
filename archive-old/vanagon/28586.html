Subject: re: oil temp sensor opinions ?


&gt;     I'm owndering what the common widom is on tempature senders.
&gt;     Specifically dip stick senders vs. installing one in the oil plate
&gt;     underneath the engine (having the sender on a T connector with both
&gt;     pressure and temp was not recommended at a FLAP).  I presume that
&gt;     all's needed to install the sender in the oil plate is to drill a hole
&gt;     in the plate and bolt it on.

I couldn't find a dipstick sender for the 2.0L engine. But the one for the
oil plate actually fits into the drain plug on these, so you don't have to
drill
any holes at all.

Now, I've been told that this location of the engine is actually the
hottest pool of oil - since it flows here before it goes on into the
cooler.
I'm not 100% certain that this is true, but the cooler is right there so it
seems possible. (Then again, so is the oil pump so maybe it flows the other
way and this is the coolest the oil will be!)

To connect the oil pressure sender you may need some brass tubing to raise
it about the tin - the VDO model is pretty wide. Also, make sure you get a
45 degree angle connector as well, so you can clear the distributor.
