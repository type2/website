Subject: 90 Westy WON&quot;T MOVE!!!!
Date: Sun, 20 Oct 1996 17:57:41 -0400 (EDT)

I need some ideas badly.  I hope y'all can help me out.  Friday I 
drove my 90 Westy from on about a 125 mile trip on the in the 
interstate, parked it, jumped out and have since been spending the 
weekend with my girlfriend's folks.  When I went out the the van to 
fire it up a while ago, the thing WOULDN'T MOVE!!  It ran OK, but 
when I went to put it in gear, it *tried* to go forward and 
backwards--I mean, you could feel the clutch engaging and the rear 
end dropping as a result of the tourque on the engine/tranny, but it 
wouldn't move.  I crawled underneath to take a look a the e-brake 
cable, and it was fine.  I jacked up the rear driver's side and the 
wheel spun freely.  then I jacked up the pass. side and the wheel 
moved maybe a 1/4 of an inch in both directions--clunk!--and it 
wouldn't move.  So I theorized maybe the brake was stuck.  Maybe the 
thing got heated up while on the interstate, got real hot, and when I 
stopped everything contracted back down and stuck the brake to the 
drum.  So to simulate this (essentially an engaged e-brake), I jacked 
back up the drivers side, set the parking brake and NO MOVEMENT at 
all in the wheel--no 1/4 inch turn, no clunk!, no nothing.  So it 
sounds as if something is really wrong here.  Anyone got any ideas??  
Am I wrong about what might happen when an e-brake gets stuck from 
overheating/malfunctioning?  Is there something is the axle or tranny 
or differentail that would let one side move and not the other?  And 
why manifest itself after a 2-hour highway trip?  I looked in my 
Bentley and got NO clues from it...   And to make the problem worse, 
when I pulled in the other night, I parked about 10 inches from a 
fence, so I can *barely* squeeze in there to jack it up!!!

Help!!!
