&gt; Hello,
&gt; 
&gt; After my recent rebuild, now my red Oxy sensor lite is on.
&gt; 
&gt; How do I turn it off?

I had the same problem and it turns out that the light indicates nothing 
but the elapsed miles since it was reset last - a pesky reminder to take 
it to your local mechanic for service (and a check of the oxy 
thing-a-ma-jig). It can be reset. Good luck
