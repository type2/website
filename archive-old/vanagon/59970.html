Subject: What should Airflow sensor read?

     Well, in the quest to find what is causing my 84 to flood and run 
rich, I've run into a question that the Bentley is a bit vague about.  
     I've pulled the airflow sensor to test it.  The temp sensor reads 
right.  Unfortunately terminals 3 and 4 give 100 ohms resistance (Bentley 
says 500-1000) so I am assuming that something is bad.
     The problem is that the Bentley only says that resistance between 
terminals 2 and 3 should &quot;vary&quot; as you move the airflow flap.  Well it 
varies, not smoothly, but in a seemingly random way from 0ohms (flap 
closed) up to 4000ohms if I push it in really smoothly, and back down to 
about 100ohms.
     What should it do?

     Thanks,
