&gt; This is not VW experience, but rather old US auto experience.
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, the complaint about bonded linings was that they might squeak.  Some 
&gt; cars wrap the brake drum with a spring similar to that used to close a 
&gt; screen door.  This stops the drum from ringing which is the real cause of 
&gt; the squeak.  Perhaps you might try that.

What is the risk of having this spring slip off? Can I notch the drum so
it won't move?
