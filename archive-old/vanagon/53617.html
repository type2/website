Subject: My Dream Gauge...


With all the talk of gaugues, gauge accuracy, and what not lately, 
combined with me being bored today, have finially conviced me to make 
public my idea for the ultimate gauge..i'm crossposting it to the vangon, 
type2, and vintagvw list cause its relativly relevent to all three.


Now, its based around one of the singlechip computers that i've delt 
with. not sure which one yet, since i havent dealt with that stuff in a 
while. 

Its also based (in my head) around a upright type 1 or 2 motor. and 
easily modified to fit others, i'm sure..

The screen isnt quite concrete yet either. depends alot on where it would 
have to mount.

The user controls would be very simple though. an up and Down arrow. That 
keeps it very simple, and univeral, no matter what the propgramming is.

Depending o how far in depth the particular prommaing is, depends on how 
many differnt screens there whould be. er..make that pages..:)

First, where we are measuring, and what.

Oil temp. Measured at the sump, each rockerchamber, and a full flow location.
Oil pressure, at the stock place (any other places we should measure?)
Head temp, each of them.
Exhaust temp, four of them. one at each exhaust outlet. maybe the simpler 
  version measured at the collector. (gotta have a header tho!)
Air/fuel mixture. throat of the manifold i guess, never seen one of these 
  gauges so i'm guessing.
All your hydrocarbon stuff for emmisions! moitored wherever it should be.
MPG, computed from miles, and amount of fuel..guess that would require 
  more sensors, like at the tank, some how..hmm..how do the ones in the JCW 
  catalog do it?(or kmPL, fer you metrics..)
Speed. 
RPM
(for you water's, water temp..:)
exhaust dB, at end of tailpipe, just fer kicks..:)
tranny temp! where to monitor it though?
Engine compartment temp
what else...ideas? ( had it totally designed in my head one night..:)
Oh! chargin output, ampmeter, battery voltage

What you see, and when..
the main one would be a uncluttered view of constantly adjusting oil 
pressure, oil temp-full flow, speed, mpg, rpm, water temp. where 
applicable, air/fuel

then a page for all temps.
for emmissions
and whatever else is left.

all ideas here welcome..:)

Hmm..warning screen flashes when pressures or temps or RPM get outta hand.

The bigest cost wouldnt be the computer or screen, but all the sensors!
and the TIME to sit and calibrate all, and program it all in.
Although, one the base program was done, adding another sensor would be a 
breaze.

for the screen and computer, shouldnt cost mor than 200$s. maybe 250, if 
i had to use a larger memory computer.



Anyhow...this is my idea, based on others, but not.

could even include maintenace warnings..:) which means more buttons to 
tell it when you did the maintinance.

anyhow...later...david(soliciting all opinions!)
