Subject: Unsubscribing... but one last question!


I'm about to unsubscribe from this mailing list as it doesn't
really have a great deal of relevance for me over here in the UK,
having a 1989 1.9L carburettor Tranporter with minimalist camper
conversion.

But a last couple of questions:

1)  Is there a club in the UK which caters for my type of 'van?

2)  Any recommendations for VW garages and bodyshops in South-West
    England?

Many thanks and keep up the excellent work Vanagoners!
