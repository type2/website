My 87 Syncro has an oil cooler.  It is a oil-to-water exchanger that is part of 
the oil filter mount.  I believe some some water cooled engines use oil to cool 
areas that cannot be cooled directly by water, namely, the pistons. Little jets 
in the crankcase area spray the oil onto the pistons from below.  I dont know 
if any water cooled vw's implement this particular strategy.  My departed 80 
scirocco had an oil temp gauge.  It was a great &quot;canary&quot; early warning for 
seeing when the engine was under stress. Also, you could tell the oil needed 
changing because the normal operation oil temp would rise noticably.

&gt;&gt; Do wassreboxers have oil coolers? I thought they did....DC
&gt;&gt;

&gt;I haven't noticed one in mine.

I don't know if wasserboxers have oil coolers or not.  They may not need
them because they use water for cooling just as most american cars do.  Most
water
cooled cars do not use oil coolers.  I read a book by Anderson on 911
performance
modifications.  He describes the 911 as an air cooled engine that, as HP and

emission controls increased, became more of an air/oil cooled engine.  From
about '74 the Porsches had two oil coolers; one close to the engine and one
mounted in either the fender well or in the front of the car.  Flow to the
coolers is
thermostatically controlled.  Allows flow thru the coolers at about 180 F.
 Porsche
also added oil squirters aimed at the under side of the pistons to improve
piston
cooling.

Anyway, I  reread Gene Bergs comment on Synthetic oil and his claim is that
the
oil flow helps remove heat from the cyl. heads.  When he used synthetic oil
his
measurements showed that the oil temp was lower and the head temp higher
than
when he used regular dino oil.
