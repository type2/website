&gt;&gt;From my personal experience I'd have to disagree.  My wife's 88 Vanagon has
&gt;over 105,000 miles without touching the automatic transmission - except to
&gt;replace the fluid once at around 100,000 miles (I know I should have
replaced
&gt;it sooner).

I agree also.  Most important trick is to maintain fluid in the final drive.
 The automatic section is actually cheap to rebuild.  Get these parts at a
transmission shop.  The kit is a universla one that covers all 4 cylinder VW
and audi transmissions.
