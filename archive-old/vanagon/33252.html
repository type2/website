Subject: Naming the bus cont......


&gt;What's even more interesting is how the name reflects the character of the 
&gt;vehicle (or is it my imagination), like Thom's Tetnaus.  Opie's kind of a 
&gt;good old boy, Beatrice seems to be a formal, old and friendly feminine 
&gt;type, and Rusty is just a happy guy, not too hung up on appearances.

&gt;Boy, does all this sound silly.

Well, ya know Dean, it IS Friday!

We named our 1969 pop-top  &quot;Miss Free Love 69&quot; based on a Hoodoo Gurus' 
song. It typified the freedom that we felt from touring national parks and 
the US for 2 months, while our friends had &quot;real&quot; jobs! Oh well, somebody 
needed to pay for the roads we were driving on!
