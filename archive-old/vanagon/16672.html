Subject: wipers work again

A loooong time ago I asked if anyone had experience with wipers that don't
move at first and then slowly make one pass across the windshield, then get
up to speed.

(There were no responses.)

I finally took the time to check this out. (Driving when &quot;the weather looks
good&quot; in Houston, in summer, translates roughly to &quot;park &amp; ignore&quot;.)
This was a kluge involving a '72 SuperBeetle wiper motor mounted on the
Bozobus' actuator plate.  Mr. Bozo has the old Heim-joint style actuator
arms, which makes installation and removal a breeze.

Opened the motor can and discovered a vast sea of rust.  The windshield
leak must have fed some water down there.  Managed to clean everything up,
and it works again.  Lots faster than it used to.  The two speeds are not
particularly dissimilar, but they're both a bunch fast than before.

An oddity: there are three commutator brushes on this motor.
Two guesses as to &quot;why?&quot;:
1) kick in the extra one for the second speed
2) the second one is the &quot;repositioner&quot;, that brings the wipers back to
their &quot;rest&quot; position (after the switch is turned off)

Am I even warm?
