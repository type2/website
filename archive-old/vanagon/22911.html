&gt; 
&gt; I just bought the 9 plastic self-adhesive letters that spell
&gt; W-E-S-T-F-A-L-I-A at West Marine for 25 cents each.  Put on
&gt; a fresh coat of kool seal for a strong &quot;tooth&quot; on which to
&gt; apply them, and it looks pretty good.  As it's a lot cheaper
&gt; to do this than the reaffixing the stock ones, thought others
&gt; might be interested.   I got black, but I think they had several
&gt; other colors.  The font/typeface doesn't match exactly, but I
&gt; think it's good enough...

I convinced my local VW Dealer/Body Shop they owe me a free replacement 
set of decals since the one they installed fell off in less than a year.  
Some grumbling about how decals are such a problem and he's not going to 
do them anymore, etc., but will pony up a fresh set for me to try to 
install.  I'm still thinking the secret - to any self-adhesive lettering - 
is in the surface prep.  And I think that those self-waxing automotive 
cleaners, such as Turtle ZipWax, leave a silicone film that's hard to 
remove (also think the stuff gets under the edges of the decal and works 
it loose after they're applied).  One observation the body shop 
manager made that I agree with is that the stock VW decals are too stiff 
to conform to the fiberglass top - just sort of bridges the pebbly surface 
- allowing water, etc to get underneath.  

Anyhow, I've made arrangement with a local sign company to scan the decal 
set before I apply them.  This will allow them to cut exact replicas of 
the decal, matching color and font exactly, but use a more compliant vinyl 
which should adhere better.  They've done a lot of this for boats and 
other demanding outdoor fiberglass applications, with excellent results.  
Once they have the scan on disk, cost of cutting new letter sets should be 
pretty reasonable.  I intend to get a copy of the disk for archiving as 
well.  I'll keep you posted.  

In the meantime, if anyone has any suggestion on how to remove residual 
silicone from the fiberglass top, I'd love to hear...
