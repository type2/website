Subject: locking engine hatch

I recently opened the engine hatch of my 79 bus, only to discover some poor
soul with another bus had taken my fresh air hoses.  Though they are not
overly expensive, I thought it was a big hassle to drive the 30 miles to the
nearest place that had the right kind of hoses to replace them.

My question is:

Is there a locking engine hatch mechanism for a 79 bus.  I have noticed some
70's type westys with locks on the engine hatch.  Would those work if I found
one at a junkyard (or bought one new).  Thanks for any input.

Tad
