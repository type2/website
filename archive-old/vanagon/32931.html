 &gt; Don't know nuthin' about this stuff but they have an informative 
 &gt; homepage on a proprietary R-12 substitute at:
 &gt; 
 &gt; http://worldserver_dot_com/R-406A/


ALso check out http://ghg.ecn.purdue_dot_edu/

THis has information from the inventor of a Freon substitute, as well as a 
truly awesome MPEG of how to light a barbecue grill.

Hmmm, maybe I shouldn't do this -- it might give SOME folks ideas...
