So Ron Lussier says:
     &gt; I pumped and pumped, and then pressed the 'starter' button.


Mine has two buttons needed for starting, the pump/igniter, and the thermocouple
bypass valve that allows gas to flow even though the puppy is not lit...is this
what you are calling the &quot;starter&quot; button?

Anyway, to get mine started, I pump a bit, and then hold the bypass button
down, and pump and pump lots more, kind of at the short end of the stroke
to rapid fire the igniter dozens of times, until the green light slowly
starts to glow.... Works every time; following the manual's start
instructions never worked.
