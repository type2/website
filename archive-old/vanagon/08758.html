&gt; Jim, it sounds to me that you have hot spots in your system caused by air
&gt; bubbles, sometimes you need to bleed the system for quite a long time
&gt; before all the air is out, especially one with a loop so long. If air is
&gt; trapped by the thermostat that could explain why it is operating
&gt; intermittently.....DC -- 
&gt; 
Jim:

I like this suggestion--when you bled the system before,did you raise the 
front wheel off the ground 15&quot; (40cm)?  That has to happen, or you will 
never get all the air out of the cooling system.

And all the puppets in this digital jail / They're runnin' around in a frenzy
In search of the Holy Grail. /
They're havin' virtual sex. / They're eatin' virtual food.
No wonder these puppets are always in a lousy mood.
