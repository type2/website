Subject:      Re: EV Tires and Unique Splittie toy


 Trace asks about EV tires. Tire Rack has Conti C-22 REINFORCED replacement
tires for about $80/tire delivered. That's cheap. Don't let anyone sell you
tires that are not reinforced, especially if you are hauling anything.
Reinforced tires have at least 6 plies total and should have individual
load ratings of about 1700 lbs.

Splittie lovers: I have come into possession of a very odd toy model of
a Splittie; it's also a record player. It has a stylus built into the under-
carriage, a mini-speaker inside, and works on a battery. You place it on
top of the record, turn the long thin lever on the driver's side to &quot;ON&quot;,
and it plays the record. Sound's not great, but what the hey, it's very
unique. Made in Japan about 20 years ago. Anyone else come across anything
like that? It's blue w/ whitetrim and is about the size of 2 cigarette
packs.


PS: Rereading this message, I realized I left out a description of how it
moves: you place it on top of the record and place the needle at the beginning
of the grooves. It plays the record as it moves along the grooves in increasing
-ly smaller circles until it reaches the center. It's one of the strangest
things I've ever seen.
