Subject: Embarrassing Question - Where does coil go?

The motor looks like a motor now, I'm just putting all of the ancilliary
little bits on.

The good news is that I finally found the carburator spring I dropped a
week ago.

Todays embarrassing question is...

Where does the coil go?  I seem to remember that it mounts on the fan
housing somehow, but I'm not really quite sure where or how.  Is there a
mounting bracket for the coil?

Unfortunately none of the photos in the Bently manual show where the coil
sits on a type IV motor.

So, if someone with a 73 could describe where and how  the coil fits, I
would be most grateful.

Is it just me or does the above message make me appear completely
scatter-brained?
