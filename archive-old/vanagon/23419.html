Subject:       '85-'86 Jetta Bentley manual for sale or trade

I've got the Bentley on the 85-86 Jetta if anyone wants it for 1/2 of
normal price.  i don't know the goingl price but i will check. I'll
pay the postage in the US.  What I'd  REALLY like a set of mid-80's
seat belts for the rear bench... even up trade.

email me private.
