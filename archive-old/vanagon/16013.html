&gt;Subject: Safety Recall RV
&gt;              Replace Fuel Injectors and Component

the big question I have about this harry and the rest of you guys is whether
there are now a new kind of injector seals and that we have to avoid buying
some of the old stock items from before then began manufacturing upgraded parts.

Anyone have a clue on this one?
