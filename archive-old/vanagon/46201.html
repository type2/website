Subject: The Car Lounge

Dear Sir / Madam,

This brief email is to inform you that the Car Lounge, in which your web
site has been referenced, is now in Beta testing and can be found at
http://carlounge_dot_com

The Car Lounge is a library of links to car and automotive related sites on
the web. During our initial research into what's out on the web, we came
across your site and liked it, so we added it in.

The Car Lounge is by no means complete, but we aim to cover more of the
European and Far Eastern car makes and products with time. We would be
delighted if next time you're on the web, you could just drop in on the site
and tell us what you think.  Please bear in mind that we already know what
car makes we're missing and we  don't yet include any classic European cars
in the site.  However, rest assured that we will be adding them in as
quickly as we can find and vet them.

If you know of any sites that we're missing, any areas that we've completely
neglected, or if you would like us not to list your link, please tell us via
email (carlounge_at_mi2g_dot_com), and give us your comments anyway.

We aim to be the best and most comprehensive non-US focused car library on
the web, and we value your feedback. Please also feel free to add a link to
Car Lounge from your site.

We (mi2g) are a High Performance Computing (HPC) house which specialises in
the design and modification of web sites that integrate audio, video,
graphics, data and virtual reality.  We are also pioneering
industry-specific web sites in law, medicine, aircraft, e-cash, real estate
etc.  Car Lounge should be officially launched in late-August.

Thank you for your feedback in advance.  Please come and visit our main web
site as well:  mi2g_dot_com.

Best wishes
