Greeting All,

I am looking to buy some misc. westy parts for my '74

1. The little part that holds up that little table that is attached to =
the side
    of the refrigerator.  That's the one that extends out of the sliding =
door.
    I've seen one on another camper, it appears to be a plastic =
telescoping
    mechanism.

2. The mechanism that fits under the big table, that folds out and =
supports
    the table into that little hole in the middle of the floor.  The =
table is there
    but the assembly that bolts to the bottom of it is missing.

These are the only two parts presently missing from my resto.  I've =
looked
everywhere for these and cannot find them anywhere.  If anyone knows =
someone who has a friend that knows someone that may be parting out the =
interior of a '74 or equivilent, please let me know. =20
