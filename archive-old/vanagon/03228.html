If you are referring to the engine, you van should have had that
mongrel 36 hp engine...which looks like a 36 hp, but has some
characteristics of a 40 hp block...for example on the mongrel
the fuel pump is not on the side of the block (a la 36) but
on top of the block.

That engine was a total disaster!!! In fact if you do have one,
in running condition, keep it!!! It is a rare piece of VW
history.
