Subject: Re: Color sanding? good/bad?

Color sanding with 600grit?  The very least you should use on any acrylic
product is 1200, 1500 is better.  You will NEVER buff out the scratches
created with 600 or even 1000 grit.  Also you MUST use water when using
1200 or 1500 grit.  As a matter of fact I have had trouble removing 1200
gt scratches from clear coats. 
Just a thought.

&gt; &gt;I've heard guys say they color sand their cars prior to
&gt; &gt;buffing/waxing.
&gt; 
&gt; DB&amp;HVW had an article a few years ago that detailed (pardon
&gt; the pun) this procedure.  Those people swore by it.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Is this a good idea?  What grit paper #600 or #1000?
&gt; 
&gt; A *good* idea?  Maybe.  It is particularly effective if you
&gt; got a bad paint job (read runs and sags) and want to smooth
&gt; it out.  If you get a *great* paint job, you may not need
&gt; it.  As for grit, #600 at least, #1000 is better and finer
&gt; would be best if you can find it.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;How long must I wait after painting my van till I can do
&gt; &gt;this?
&gt; 
&gt; It depends on the type of paint, but most current paint
&gt; should cure fast enough that you could do the work a few
&gt; days after painting.  Decide *before* you have the painting
&gt; done.  Let the painter know you are going to do it so he can
&gt; lay it on thick instead of thin.  The last thing you want is
&gt; *burn through*, that is sanding through the color coat you
&gt; just paid for.

&gt; &gt;Martin  '71 bus going into paint shop on Monday.
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, I tried it.  I painted my 1967 Deluxe myself with
&gt; DuPont Centari (acrylic enamel) with a *wet look* hardener.
&gt; I color sanded the Pearl White above the belt line and on
&gt; the roof, only had one burn through, and it looks alright.
&gt; I then tried (just the rear hatch) sanding the Velvet Green
&gt; below the belt line and stopped.  Now maybe it just needs
&gt; more sanding.  Maybe it needs more buffing.  Maybe it needs
&gt; more polishing.  But the rear hatch just does not look as
&gt; good as the rest of the green paint I did not sand.
&gt; 
&gt; My recommendation?  If you trust your body shop to do a
&gt; fantastic paint job, you do not need to color sand.  If
&gt; there are runs or sags when you get your bus back, try color
&gt; sanding in a low-profile area and see what you think.
&gt; 
&gt; If you need your bus for transportation next week, forget
&gt; it...you are in for a lot of sanding, buffing, polishing and
&gt; waxing.
&gt; 
&gt; My 2 cents.
&gt; 
&gt; If you really want more information, I might be able to
&gt; track down the DB&amp;HVW article.  Let me know.
