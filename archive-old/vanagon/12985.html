Subject: Re: Replacement seats

Speaking of replacement seats, the used car price guides list leather seats
as an option for the more recent (88-92) Vanagons.  I've never seen that
on either Vanagons or Westphalias, not even on &quot;Wolfsburg Editions&quot;.

Is that an option that VWoA-North Central ducked, but that some of the
other regions got?
