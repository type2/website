Subject: EV AC &amp; cooling fans fixed!!!


Got the new resistors early this afternoon! They list for $38 each...
my parts guy gave them to me for $30 each...still OUCH!

Put them in...got everything back in place in under 10 minutes...
put the A/C on...and WHRRRRRRRRRRR....the fan came on!! Drove it
around all afternoon with the front and rear A/C on &quot;high&quot; and
the needle held just slightly above 1/2!


My EV is happy...and so am I!!


Now all I have to do is do battle with VW customer service.... 8(
