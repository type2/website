Subject: Re: More questions on my '85

	Donald Baxter wonders:

&gt; When the engine is cold on this '85, the idle is about 900-1000 RPM.  
&gt; When warmed up to normal operating temperature the idle increases to 
&gt; 1400-1600 RPM.  The van also seems to be getting not so good gas 
&gt; mileage--not sure of the figures (and in fact, I don't know how much the 
&gt; tank really holds) but in 90 miles of driving, I have used 1/2 tank 
&gt; according to the fuel gauge.

	Don, 1400-1600 rpm is *WAY* too fast for idle! I'd suspect your
idle enrichment is on all the time, or the mixture is mis-adjusted.
There is a third, more illusive problem, which I saw on a Rabbit. The
O2 Sensor is fail-deadly- on the waterpumper inline-four, a bad O2 sensor
will drive the K-Jetronic system to full-rich, which will eventually
cause the poor catalytic converter to melt, giving one a truely wierd
set of symptoms to troubleshoot.

	BTW, any excessive enrichment will have some effect on the cat,
if you have one- it tries to burn the extra gas.

	Bill
