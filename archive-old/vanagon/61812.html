&gt; As far as the vent at the rear of the door with the blue lever, that is not
&gt; connected to the vents for the rear.  Those doohickeys are supposedly for
&gt; &quot;fresh air circulation.&quot;  Our vans are supposed to be airtight.  VW was
&gt; known for that.  So theoretically, if you want any fresh air coming into
&gt; the van, you need to provide an outlet so you get a flow-through kinda
&gt; thing going.  That's what those flaps do.  You open them and you supposedly
&gt; get better ventilation as the air coming in doesn't have to &quot;work as hard&quot;
&gt; to get in.
&gt; 
&gt; That's the theory behind them anyway.  Note that the air-cooled Buses also
&gt; had those vents in the doors.

Removed &quot;the vent at the rear of the door with the blue lever&quot;.
Used a flashlight with a small mech's mirror to brouse around.
Can find no air passages to these vents.
Yet air flows!
Is it leaking through the window seals and door handles?
