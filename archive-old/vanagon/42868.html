Subject: Thanks for the help

        Well I'm officially off on my first adventure in my new van this
weekend. I have no idea where Im really headed to but I do know Im going to
go south west. Its just me and one of my buddies. We heard somehting about
a biker festival here in Alberta so we may go and check that out.
        I got everything working great in the van. I cleaned out the water
tank so now I'll feel safe when drinking the water, and THE FRIDGE ACTUALLY
WORKS! And amn 'o man does it get nice and cold in there.

        I fixed the e-brake as well, turns out that the handle was just
bent a bit to the left so that the teeth that hold it up didnt match up. I
thought for sure it was going to require alot more than me just bending the
metal back. Not that Im complaiing.

        It needs an oil change however, and the PO used 15w40 Castrol, but
I have a coupon for a $20 oil change as long as I use 10w30. Is it going to
make any huge difference or should I try to stick with the 15w40 ??

 toodles....
