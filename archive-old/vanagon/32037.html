Subject: Locking engine hatch on '66



I'd _really_ like to lock up my engine on my '66 bus.

Does anyone know where I can get a locking latch for the engine hatch?
Will Bug locking latches work?

On a distantly related note, I'd like to put a kill switch in my bus and 
I'm wondering which wire is the best one to put the kill switch on.

Between those two items, I think my bus would be fairly safe (at least in
my area:-)

Thanks,
...Markus
