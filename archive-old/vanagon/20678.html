Subject: FI Cleaners (survey)
Date: Wed, 12 Jul 95 14:15:27 EDT

Someone on the list recently posted a message on the good results obtained
from Slick 50 FI/fuel cleaner.

I'd like to get a sense from people as to a) how useful are these
products; b) which ones work and when; and c) results obtained (increase
in mileage; hesitation fixed etc.)

Personally, I am skeptical but have tried them a few times just to be on
the safe-side, especially after running ethanol gas. 

A related item would be the garages that offer an FI &quot;clean-up&quot;. Is this 
really necessary?



Thanks in advance

DC
