Subject: Re: Importing used VWs from Canada

Neil,
	Send away for a leaflet,Importing A Car, from Customs, P.O. Box 
7407, Washington, DC 20044.  Also write to: US EPA, Manufacturers 
Operations Division 6405-J, Investigation/imports Section, 401 M Street,  
Washington, DC 20460 (EPA imports Hotline 202 233-9660).  Do not forget 
to write our friends at the  US Department of Transportation, National 
Highway Traffic Safety Compliance (NEF-32), 400 Seventh Street,S.W., 
Washington, DC 20590.  Importing the van you described should be 
possible.  Get prior approval from the EPA to bring the thing in.  You 
will have to put up a bond for 1/2 the van's value and have a EPA 
certified shop confirm the info VW sent you.  You will also need to 
convince the DOT that the van complys with their safety rules.  You need 
to get a DOT HS-7 form.  Sounds complicated?  If you do the leg work your 
self, this can be a cheap adventure.  If you hire a Registered Importer, 
expect to pay some big bucks.  I've imported a pre-'68 van.  That was 
easy.  No inspections no big hassles.
