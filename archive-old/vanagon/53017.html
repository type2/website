Subject: Re: 97 EV's


&gt; The sporadic sightings and information about 97 EV's suggests that they
&gt;have already been imported, at least in a few places. As I recall, they
&gt;have been examined in North Carolina, Missouri (Bap?), and Seattle (Rick
&gt;Gordon). My local dealer says there are no plans to bring them in here
&gt;until at least next spring and that they haven't even gone into production
&gt;yet in Germany.

 Maybe the US version, but I don't think that there are much differences.
The VR6 engine was already imported with the Passat long time ago. How long
does it take to get the DOT approval?
