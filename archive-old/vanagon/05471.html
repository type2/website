Subject: Nokia snow tires

Here's more info on the Nokia snow tires I have on my 91 Vanagon Camper
for anyone who is interested:

  Nokia Hakkapeliitta 10  195/70R14 M+S
  Tread: 5 plies (2 rayon, 2 nylon, 1 steel)
  Sidewall: 2 plies (rayon)
  Max load 615kg/1356lbs (is this load range B?)
  Max pressure 300 KPa/44 psi

The tires have a rotation arrow on them, unlike the 09 they replaced,
so they must be mounted the correct way on the wheel rim.

As for handling, all I can say is that I haven't been disappointed.
I don't drive my Camper in an aggressive way (although I always seem
to squeal the stock Michelin MXLs on the exit ramp on the way to work),
so I'm probably not a good person to comment on just what kind of
beating the sidewalls will take before rolling under too much!

These tires work very, very well in snow, although I must confess that
I drove my old beatup Toyota 4wd truck last winter. This winter, I don't
have that crutch to fall back on, but I really don't think I'll have any
problems at all.
