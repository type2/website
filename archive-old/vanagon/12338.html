Hi all.

I've camped a lot in the highway 395 area, and I personally don't like 
Red Rock that much. Very barren and dry looking.

Nearby, and at a higher elevation, is another Forest Service Campground 
called Lone Pine Campground; it's on the road to Whitnet Portal. This 
place is gorgeous! Fabulous views from almost every camp site.

If we're going this far, why not go to a prettier (and cooler) place?
