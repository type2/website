Earlier I wrote:
&gt;&gt;This may be old news but I've found a (German) source for extra 
&gt;fuel tanks to fit T3 Syncros.  Made from stainless steel, left and
&gt;right hand tanks are available in  67 or 75 litre sizes (each tank). 


Before You sell the kids (BTW: are they nice, well behaving and how much would 
they be, if ?) try something else:

Fax or call: 
Woick Travel Center
D- 70 774 Filderstadt (Stuttgart)
Phone: +49 - 711 - 70 96 700 (Herr Roeber)
Fax: +49 - 711 - 70 96 770

and remember Tax (VAT) refound for foreign customers

You could also have a try at:

Innovation Campers
Warendorf
Phone: + 49 - 25 81 - 63 24 94
Fax: + 49 - 25 81 - 62 86 6

Maybe one of them is a little cheaper than Daerr and you can keep at least 
some of the kids.
