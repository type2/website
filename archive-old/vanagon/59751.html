&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; I'm wondering because the Vanagon camper model doesn't come with a
   'Westfalia' decal, and I'm hoping to figure out how to do it myself.
    &gt;&gt;
  Which Camper model doesn't have the decal?
  Also you can get the decals pretty inexpensively, like from between 5-10
  dollars. Someone was reproducing them.  &gt;&gt;
 
 LOL!!!  That's good.  By &quot;model&quot; Ron really meant model.  As in: &quot;a small
plastic replica of a real vehicle that one paints, glues together, and
applies decals to.&quot;
 
 Gotta love our language!!

Whoops!!  missed that one by a mile.  :&lt;)  
sorry about that....
