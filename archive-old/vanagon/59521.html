Subject: Erouvan owner needs help from other eurovan owners

--   Listees,

  I know that a couple of you Eurovan owners have had some electrical problems with 
your vans, Fuel gauge, temp gauge and tach inop.

  A person contacted me on these problems and I don't have any answers for her, I knew 
that this had been tossed around on the list a while back and I thought that someone 
that had these problems and had found a remedy could pass that info on to her.

  Thanks Kyle

   Thanks alot for going to all the trouble on my 93 service manual. i
appreciate it. already the gas gauge, temp gauge, and the tackometer are
broken.
