Subject: a proud  new 83 owner

Greetings all- just got my new 83 home. I thank all of you for your advice and comments. I had originally been looking for a bread loaf van, but due to your enthusiasm here I began to look for a vanagon and I am really happy I did.

I have a few questions for you all:

1) the EGR light is on. how can I reset this?

2) my vanagon was equipped with the auxiliary gas heater. Are these safe? It works VERY well.

3) how does one remove the bulbs that light the dash? (specifically the speedo). I get the white thingy out but the bulb is not standard and I do not want to force it.

4) The van seems to cruise well at up to 65-70 mph. What is the recommended cruise speed? what is the maximum speed?

5) Are the brake components the same as later breadloaves? (calipers, drums, rotors, pads?)

Thanks
Rio
