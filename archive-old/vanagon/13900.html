Subject:       Low compression / hydraulic valves

Import Service, March 1995 Vol 8, No 3
Reader 'tech tip' submission

&quot;If you have low cranking compression but little cylinder leakdown on 
an air-cooled VW engine equipped with hydraulic valves, try 
readjusting the valves.  If this does not correct the problem, I have 
seen several cases where the hydraulic lifters were bad enough to 
hold the valves open slightly at all times.

The defective hydraulic lifters can be replaced without removing the 
engine or cylinder heads, which will save your customer quite a bit 
of money.
