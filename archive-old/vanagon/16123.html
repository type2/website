Subject: Synchro Tranny leak, MSDS response

I just got off the phone with Martin and we discussed the leak situation
on the front dive shaft.

He uses the standard factory seal but they make sure the shaft is smooth. 
They sand the shaft with a 400 grit sandpaper to make it smooth before
reinstalling the shaft. 

Then, he makes sure that a front end alignment is performed after the seal 
is replaced. Following this procedure, he has no problems with leaks.

He says he went through a couple of seals until they smoothed the drive
shaft.
