&gt;probably answer this better, but i overheard some vw folks talking about just
&gt;this.  Seems that the gauge is somewhere on the &quot;top&quot; of the engine.  you've
&gt;got to open the back hatch, and take off the &quot;cushion&quot; (if you've the camper
&gt;variety) and take off the metal plate, so that you are looking down onto the
&gt;top of the engine.  After this i got lost, since i was not &quot;looking&quot; at the
&gt;time.  Tho you should be able to find out where the gauge is from one of the
&gt;various vw bibles (engine books--libraries are great for this).  Also heard
&gt;that this problem (taking off the metal plate) was only for certain years.

this is a fix that allows you to replace the sender without removing the
engine ... but it initially requires CUTTING that hole in the 'luggage area'
back of the rear seat. my non-bentley vw repair book gives specific
dimensions for making this cut. my brother actually did it on his 73 bus,
but imho, it looked kinda crappy with that little piece of tin screwed over
the hole afterward. still ... it was a lot quicker. and you only have to cut
the hole once (yeah, but how many times do you expect the fuel tank sender
to croak?)

anyway, if anybody wants a copy, lemme know. or i could type it up for here.
