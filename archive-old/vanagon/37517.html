I'm certainly going to investigate further, but I couldn't see or feel any 
coolant around the hose fitting. I used a dentist mirror to get the best 
look I could and it appeared coolant was weeping right out of the head, in 
a line, just under the flange for the stud. It's hard for me to believe 
there could be an invisible crack that goes all the way through the head to 
the coolant chamber.

I really hate to do anything involving removing the head right now and am 
tempted to use some kind of &quot;JB Weld&quot; product to seal the crack. But then, 
the crack is liable to grow and then fail catastrophically.
