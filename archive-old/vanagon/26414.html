another data point - 87 Syncro: $0.25 capacitor in place. Problem after 4-5 
hours at very steady 65 mph. Started to miss/die, then really tried to quit. 
I cycled the gas pedal up and down for a few times, kept this up for 10 
minutes and the problem went away. Previously the van would've quit dead, no 
comeback with the gas pedal. It is better, not perfect.  Tim Smith
