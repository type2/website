Subject: Which Vanagon to buy?

Hi.
I am looking to buy a Vanagon.  I have seen the model_faq and am wondering if
it is worth holding out for a later model Van with more HP?  I know the '86
has 95 Hp but the earlier ones have less (82?).  Should I even consider the
pre '84 Vanagon with the air cooled motor (67 Hp??)?  Post '87 Vanagons seem
a lot more expensive here (So. California).
What I really want is a Van that needs engine work so I will be able to save
money this way (and still get a late model).  
Also, what is the best shop manual for the Vanagon and where to buy it?
Any advice appreciated,
Regards,    MIKE
