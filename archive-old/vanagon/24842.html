Well nanny-nanny-boo-boo.

I actually get more responses from other Eurovan owners arounbd here than 
I get from older bus or vanagon drivers.  Its where you are and who you 
are.  Ain't that much difference.  I'd hardly call anyof the EV drivers 
I've met 'yuppies'.  Bet my hair for example is as long as about any of 
the splittie drivers.  Wear jeans and t-shirts to work.  Take my kids to 
rock shows - and not that old mellow stuff only.  Way too much insulting 
of people going on over this issue from both 'sides' of the same coin.

&gt; &gt; Well, here's the scene in BC as experienced by a loaf driver:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; - Eurovans: are you kidding?  I don't think folks around here even know 
&gt; &gt; what it is to drive a VW bus/van/whatever you'd call the thing.  I've 
&gt; &gt; NEVER gotten a wave, or even an eye-to-eye look, from ANY Eurovan around 
&gt; &gt; here on a paved road.  Yuppie mobile.  I tried waving all spring and 
&gt; &gt; summer, but now I wave rarely at E-vans--I guess I don't take rejection 
&gt; &gt; well.  ;)
