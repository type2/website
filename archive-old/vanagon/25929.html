Subject: Cruise Blues Resolved

I finally having working, after-market cruise in my 87 Westy.  It took
several trips to the installer before he finally yanked the &quot;electronic&quot;
cruise and replaced it with a vacuum style.  The manufacturer is SCS
Frigette.  There is definitely a conflict with electronic cruise and Vanagons
from this supplier so if you're in the (after) market for cruise...stick to
vacuum.
