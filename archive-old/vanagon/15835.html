Subject: Re: Ramona Rests

&gt;to get her baby hummin' again, so help me out here - I've never dropped an
&gt;engine before so I need some good, seasoned advice!!!!
&gt;Thanks, all*      Rachel &amp; Ramona too!
&gt;
I thought you could pull the generator without dropping the engine, you need 
a large wrench/socket to get onto the nut that's nearest the fire wall/gas 
tank and another to fit the pulley end. Brace the hidden wrench against the 
engine case, use so blocks of wood 2&quot; x 4&quot; etc. and keep some pressure on 
with the other wrench until things are braced and you can really reef on it. 
It eludes me how to keep the generator shaft still for this operation if 
needed however.  Anyone? tim s.

If you can plug in an overnite battery charger maybe you can put this off 
indefinately?
