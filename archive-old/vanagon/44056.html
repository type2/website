Subject: RE: Replace Clutch?

&gt;Even if you feel a difference in the amount of pressure it takes to
&gt;flex the springs, it's hard to say how much difference it takes to
&gt;make a decision. Personally, I say that if you feel ANY difference,
&gt;or see any noticable wear in the disc, then go ahead and replace the
&gt;entire clutch: Pressure plate, disc, throwout bearing, and pilot bearing.
&gt;And take off the flywheel and bring it to a machine shop for resurfacing--
&gt;your new clutch will be smooth as silk if you do this. If you don't, it
&gt;may chatter whenever you let up the clutch pedal, announcing to all the
&gt;world that you're a lazy cheapskate (resurfacing costs around $25 here).

Steve,

In my newly acquired '76 DC, I get the chattering clutch but only when in
reverse gear. All 4 forward speeds work with no chattering whatsoever. I
know that I need to go through and completely replace at some point, but
why is only reverse affected?

Cheers,

Bren
