Subject: Re: Engine transplant ideas??

&gt;I think that the fitment problems of any in-line engine are significant.  The
&gt;wasserboxer is about 2.5 cylinders long.  The Rabbit/Jetta engines are 4
&gt;cylinders long and the Audi engines are about twice as long as the
&gt;wasserboxer at 5 cylinders.  I see the only more difficult engine to fit than
&gt;the 5 would be an in-line 6.  I think it might be wise to keep in mind flat
&gt;or V engine configuration engines.  


The Audi engines come out to 23.5in. long, within range of several engines 
that Kennedy list to fit Vanagons.  There is clearance once the VW stock 
exhaust is out of the way, and the South African Audi engined Vanagons are 
filled right to the edge of the deck lid.  The engines are almost 
horizontal, tipped way left to drop under the deck lid.  They DO fit!!  My 
main concern is that they (SA) don't convert Syncros, only 2WDs. This may be 
to do with moving the trans forward, almost impossible with a Syncro.
         And yes, Subaru 2.2 Legacy engines, 130HP to 160HP turbo would 
likely be a clean installation, even with the turbo, but only the 1.8 Loyale 
engines, 87HP, fit under the deck lid height, 11.5&quot;. Tipping a flat four is 
a NO-NO as oil will puddle in the cyl. barrels, leading to hard starting 
likely impossible in winter, and potentially destroying the engine if the 
oil locks up piston travel.  My memory is that the Subaru 2.2s are 
'zero-clearance' engines, and if you break/skip either of the toothed belts 
you may bust a valve or worse.
        I have a bias towards German equipment, despite having almost as 
many French cars as German in my life. And the Audi 5 is a well established 
motor, 20 years worth of development.  This is where I want to put my 
efforts, unless someone gives me a Subaru 2.2 turbo and I have to make do :)
