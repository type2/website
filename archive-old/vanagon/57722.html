I was driving late at night when I noticed smoke billowing out of the
back of my 86 vanagon.  I trekked furthur on till my oil light came on,
but I was In the middle of nowhere, with somewhere being 5miles away.
Needless to say the pig died in the middle of nowhere. I know I've been
having a coolant problem(leaks out from bottom till all gone), but the
oil was something new. I don't think I siezed the engine, but I was
wondering if anyone knows what needs to be fixed(I think its the
headgasket).  Also, where can I get a Bently manual?.  Shanandoah would
be cool to go on a camping trip.
