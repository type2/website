Subject:      ok, CRITICS!     Poem 2.01


I think that I shall never see
An auto that appeals to me,
In shape or form, for beast or man,
As much as a Volkswagen Van.

It goes Where None Have Gone Before
And does it with just speeds of four;
It goes, and with you takes it all
For creature comforts, big and small;

It carries on, and ne'er complains
In Winter's snow or Springtime's rains,
Or Summer's heat, or Autumn's breeze,
Although at times, your butt will freeze;

It lasts the ages, passing down
&gt;From Old to Young, who've newly found
The sheer delight and sect's appeal
Of driving in a box on wheels.



HA!
