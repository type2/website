Subject: Re: How to fix rust below windshield (was: Back and ready...)


&gt;One of the places needing repair
&gt;(again) is the metal around the windshield.  It's been looking rusty for
&gt;spell (OK, a long spell) but yesterday, while washing the windshield at the
&gt;gas station, I leaned on the rubber seal &amp; the metal (more accurately, the
&gt;former metal) buckled.  There's now a big hole.  I find this a bad sign.
&gt;Has anybody fiberglassed bad damage like this?  I'm probably going to have a
&gt;shop do the work (time is a factor, time and not having a garage or barn
&gt;anymore) but I'd be curious as to whether or not anybody's been in this boat
&gt;before and how they took care of such serious damage.  I had the seal/rust
&gt;fixed a few years ago (fiberglass) and haven't been pleased with the way it
&gt;lasted.  I've not seen any sheet-metal replacement inserts for the bottom of
&gt;the 'shield.  Advice?


My '71 Transporter has this problem too. I've seen *many* older busses with
it-- seems to be a common malady, just BEGGING for a cure. Anyone who has
fixed this, for better or worse, please clue the rest of us in!

It would be great if some aftermarket company, or courageous entrepreneur,
would start manufacturing a metal panel that replaces the 6&quot; of metal below
the windshield, including mounts for the wiper pivots. I've never heard of
this being reproduced, but I'll bet there is a big market for it-- almost
as big as for Bug rear floor pans! Anyone ever seen such?

One thing bus owners can do, will halt the rust on the outside, but won't 
fix whatever damage that's been done. Get some basic motor oil, and an 
eyedropper or small brush, and cover the rusted areas with oil. I know,
it's messy. But, bingo, the rust STOPS spreading. You have to re-do it
every 4-6 months or so, 'cuz the oil wears off. It will hold you till
someone makes the above repro metal panel! And, it will give you something
to do with that extra 1/2 quart you couldn't put in at your last oil change.
The air cleaner doesn't need it EVERY time, you know.
