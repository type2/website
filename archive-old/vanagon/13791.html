   &gt;
   &gt;3) Would purchasing a new master cylinder help?
   &gt;
   or rebuilding... you may have pushed the seals in the master cyl. into
   areas 
   they never went before when the rear cyl blew. Dirt/gunge may be
   interfering 
   with the seating. Try bleeding to purge some gunge, nextstep: rebuild,
   real 
   cheep compared to buying a new/rebuilt cyl, unless you bust off stuff,
   which 
   you will due if you replace it anyhow.    tim s.   oh... are the shoes 
   'green' and just braking in? :)  2&quot; travel is lots tho', bye
   &gt;
   
Tim!  Thanks for the info.  I saw the cylinder for like $30 from Bus boys,
new.  That didn't seem too expensive.  There certainly could be dirt/grunge
in the cylinder.  My bus sat unused for two years.  

Would the rubber seals break down in the brake fluid over that period of
time?

The fluid in the reservoir is clear, and when I last bled the brakes 3 weeks
ago, the fluid was clear.  Although, I am certain that I didn't bleed enough
fluid from the system to have entirely flushed the fluid all of the way from
the master cylinder to the rear.


The rear shoes are new.  They were farther out of alignment in comparison to
the front shoes.  It sounds like that could have been part of the problem.

It just seems to me that the margin of precision on how the brake shoes must
be adjusted is WAY too close.  I'd imagine that this would be increased if
the master cylinder wasn't working to peak efficiency.
