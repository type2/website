Subject:      vanagon plastic bumper repair

a quick call to my favorite body shop supply place yields the following info:

SMC Fibreglas Resin, $15.75 for 2 each. 1-pint cans.
mixed 1-1 and slopped into the cracks/breaks/holes.
can be sanded and painted with whatever paint you choose.

this is supposedly the 'recommended' stuff for the volkswagen type plastic
bumpers. a check with your own local supply might be in order to double
check this info.
