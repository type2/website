So Ted Wendeln AFSAC/ECMM says:
&gt; 
&gt; Jim,
&gt; 
&gt; with these heads.  If you aren't losing coolant thru the heads you
&gt; could have a small leak anywhere along the 20' of hoses.  Small leaks
&gt; will continue to drain off just enough fluid to start the temp light
&gt; flashing.  You just need to keep adding fluid until you find the
&gt; leak and fix it.  I've noticed that as soon as cold weather hits my
&gt; 85 seems to spring new leaks.  Finding them has become an annual
&gt; event.  If you have a bad head, you might want to contact VW and see
&gt; if they'll spring for some of the cost.
&gt; 

In my owners manual, it says for long drives on hot days or long uphill
drives, that you should leave the engine running for a couple of minutes
before you shut it down after you stop.  I think this help eliminate
hot spots in the system by distributing the built up heat into the
passing coolant.  I'm not sure if this is correct, but I've had no
problems yet (knock on wood) at 59,000 miles.  I do 2 minute idle thing
alot and it's not a big deal.
