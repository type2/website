Subject: Jerry Garcia Ad

Just wanted to let you all know, I took Dave's advice from last Friday (yeah, I
am a little slow reading my digests) and called VoA about this ad and Sherri at
VoA was very pleasant and said there was no problem getting a copy of this sent
to me.  Sherri also asked how I got the number and she seemed to have never
heard of the Vanagon List.

There are two Bay Window Bussers in the band I do sound for and they were
shattered by  Jerry's passing, so I am sure they will be happy when I bring the
ad in to practice.

peace,
terry &amp; Sunshine ('64 Westy)
