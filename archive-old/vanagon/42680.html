&gt;&gt; There is a material known as &quot;Ice Guard,&quot; which is used by roofing

&gt;
&gt;How thick is this stuff?  I'm definitely in need of soundproofing for my
&gt;Westy ( a diesel ).
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Unfortunately, it is sold only in large quantities (225 ft^2 rolls), and
&gt;&gt; runs about $70 for this much. Perhaps a few people could get together for a
&gt;&gt; roll, or it might be possible to get scraps from a roofing contractor.
&gt;
&gt;What are the dimensions of the roll?  The size of tar-paper, I'd guess.
&gt;Is that 3 feet or 30 inches?

Hi Gerry,

Sorry, but I don't know what the exact thickness of it is. I just pulled
all the information from the FAQ and quickly threw it up to the list. The
FAQ did say it was similar, how similar though I don't know.

Perhaps we have some architects/contractors/builders on the list who might
remember the dimensions of this stuff?

Whatever the dimensions are, I'm sure we'd end up with some extras to make
beer bottle/can insulators. Hey, we could slap some V_at_L stickers on 'em and
start selling 'em! ;-)
