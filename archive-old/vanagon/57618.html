&gt; Hi Volks,
&gt;  A friend off the list asked me to post the following:
&gt;  Were 16&quot; wheels ever offered on vanagons? If so, what models, years etc?

Some rare models of the all-wheel-drive Vanagon Syncro's were produced with
16&quot; wheels.  Years were between 1986 &amp; 1991, but I'm not certain if they were
offered all of these years.  None of these 16&quot; Vanagon Syncros were sold by
VW in the USA or Canada.
