Subject: Round silver thing under clock?


This may seem dumb, but ever since I've had my Vanagon I've wondered what 
that round silver thing under the clock, that looks like a cigarette 
lighter is.  I've looked through the books and nothing is mentioned.  
Could someone shed some light on the thing.   Thanks,

kyle
