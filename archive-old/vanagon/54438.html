Subject: Paint woes

Hey guys,

I'm happy to announce that yesterday I got my beloved 86 GL is out of
the bodyshop with OK, not great, body work and a paint job.  Last night
though, some asshole sideswiped me in a parking lot, now I got this
white racing stripe down the whole side of brown van.  

I already called the shop for some matching paint. I'm happy now that I
painted a Bug when I was younger so fixing this won't be a real big
deal.

Have you ever had the feeling that you just threw your $$ away.

Sorry, just needed to vent.
