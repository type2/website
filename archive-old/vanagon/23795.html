Subject: Re: Battery plate plus leak question

Hi Jonathan, the Bus Stop a division of Rocky Mountains Motorworks has a
battery tray for early and late busses for $28.00. Check their 1995 catalog
page 19 or give them a call at 1-800-544-5357. This company is very reliable.
About your leak question, I don't think that is a good idea to drill holes on
the tray, instead buy a good replacement.
Good luck!
