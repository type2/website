&gt;  You're not joking about the valve guides. I've got two 2000cc type IVs
&gt;  and both came to me in need of a rebuild because at least half a valve
&gt;  guide had been bounced around the head. The piston crown in each case 
&gt;  looked like a relief map of the Himalaya's and in one engine the bits had 
&gt;  managed to make their way into the ajoining cylinder too. I don't know 
&gt;  why this engine seems partial to doing this, but checking them during a 
&gt;  rebuild may stop an expensive crunch later.

Do you mean valve _guides_ or valve _seats_?  Type IV heads, as they come
from the factory, are (in)famous for having their valve seats come loose.
See June 1995 _DB&amp;HWs_ magazine for an article on Type IV head rebuilding,
featuring Mark Stephens High Performance.  It shows the painstaking process
Stephens performs on Type IV heads to keep the valve seats from ever coming
loose.
