&gt;
&gt;Is anyone planning to attend the VW meet coming up in Vallejo?
&gt;Should we make it into another vanagon gourmet tailgate party?
&gt;
&gt;
Dear Martha,

I, Eugene Palmer, will be there and will be stuck to my swap space trying to
off years of mechaniking.  We will have some fine Peets coffee going, and
will look further into the gourmet possibilities of a VW meet.  See you there.
