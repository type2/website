Don't discount these, tho i have not seen the JCW version.

I used a pair of Marchall's with a 'lead crystal lens'... and a pair 
of Cibie' Z-Beams that did not appear to have as nice a lens.  The 
Marchall's front of the lens was totally flat, as compared to the 
standard 'bulge' of others.  The light beam from the Marchall's was 
the best i've ever seen, much better than the Z-beam. 

Without seeing what JCW is actually selling, i would definately go 
with the one with the lead crystal lens on the chance it is a good 
one.

Oh, and most importantly... the Marchall's looked beautiful-- a 
precursor to the Lexus 'clear lens' look.
