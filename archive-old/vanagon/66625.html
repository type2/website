To Dan,
It sounds like your headlights are probably stone-chipped.
Check the surface for cracks or tiny holes. You might be able to use some
silicone and seal them off and dry them out. Longterm you will probably
have to replace them. Megabucks from the dealer.
Once you find a new set of headlights, make sure to get a pair of
plexiglass
covers or the plastic stick on kind to protect them from stone chips.
Those European type headlights used on the later vanagons are a major
investment. No kidding.

&gt; Does anyone have any suggestions on cleaning the later model square
&gt; headlights.  The insides get foggy and cut down on visibilty.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
