I think there were over 50 &quot;Herbies&quot; used to make the movies.  Some were 
specialized to do the special-effect tricks.  I see one for sale every 
once-in-a-while and the price seems to vary from $25 to $100 K!  Yowza.

&gt; Speaking of Herbie, I recently saw an auction notice for &quot;Herbie, the Love
&gt; Bug&quot; in one of those big Auction catalogs (I can't remember the name, but
&gt; it's THE BIG, fancy classic car auction company). I wonder if it's REALLY
&gt; &quot;THE HERBIE.&quot; Then again, one has to wonder how much abuse ONE VW actually
&gt; could take in those movies. 8-)
