Subject: Border Crossing (good and bad)


My family and I just recently zipped across the border in our '87 
Westy with nary a pause.  Entry into the US was cake too, tho this is 
definately where we have had problems in the past.  Traveling with 
children seem to make all the difference.  And using a small town 
crossing point.

BUT friends of ours had a horrible experience at the time we went
across.  I hope this is the result of an individual Canadian crossing guard
and not a Manitoban/Canadian policy.  It defies every experience I
have ever had in Canada and Manitoba.  This individual was asked for
his license, had his # run and a DWI (Driving While Intoxicated)
came up.  The guard would not let him enter Canada tho his wife and
children could.  The man is black and his wife is white.  The guard
told him the &quot;We don't want your type here.  Leave and never try to
enter again.&quot; 

I was dumbfounded when I heard this.  Can anyone shed light on this?
Is Canada restrictive of people with DWI or is this as bad as it
appears?
