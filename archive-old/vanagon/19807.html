These guys were in my back yard and I missed the EV's with stickers!

With everybody in my family sporting long pony tails I guess I ought to 
put some hippie stickers on my Eurovan.  I was too busy to get down to 
the Dead this Year - even though Dylan was opening.  I even gave away 
free tickets for Saturday night.....
