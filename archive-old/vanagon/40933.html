Subject: Re: Rocking of the Van...serious advice needed!

&gt; then next think you know the van is a rockin' and ya get whistles and yells
&gt; from all over the place...*blush* hmm, is there a way to level out the van to
&gt; keep it from rocking so much? maybe some of those RV stands? camp where no one

I don't speak from experience but hows about putting it on jack stands?  
Or blocking up the suspension with wood blocks?
