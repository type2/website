&gt;&gt;      For the $30, I found this to be the best deal around.  I highly
&gt;&gt;      recommend these to anyone who likes to take car of their car.  Besides
&gt;&gt;      you can now talk knowledgeably with the dealer and the mechanics, and
&gt;&gt;      get the right things corrected - some under warranty.

I did. Write to Jonah, churren; this would be an excellent tool. Please do
mention the word &quot;hybrid&quot; in your email; some of us drive Macs as well as
VWs.
