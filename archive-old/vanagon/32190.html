Subject: Re: EV Winnebago Defrosting - LACK OF

Hi Dan.  Sorry the Winnie folks don;'t seem to have done a good job.  The 
EV is an outstanding vehicle.  Easily worth the Transporter name living 
up to its predecessors.  Winnie might not live up to the Westie though.

&gt; There seems to be no provision for rear heating
&gt; whatsoever - no dual controls, no vent as described
&gt; by you.  In my 1988 Westy, not only was there a
&gt; core in the box under the rear seat, but there
&gt; was a duct running in the housing where the sliding
&gt; door ran, with head level outlets.  There is no
&gt; equivalent in the EV-Winne.

EV itself doesn;t have more than the one duct.  Has nevr been inadequate 
(well the first few minutes are darned cold - but thats true of all 
vehicles isn;t it)

&gt; There is A/C.  Can't wait for the hot, humid weather
&gt; to find that it only reaches the front seats!

Hope they didn't mess that up too badly.

&gt; P.S.  The frugality shows in a few other things - the
&gt; cabin lights lack the &quot;courtesy delay&quot; and other rather
&gt; trivial stuff.

EV only has delay in the front nothing in the rear on delay.  Does the 
Winnie lack that?!

Maybe Westfalia can get the contract back sometime.
