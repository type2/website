Chris,

If you don't have the ignition timing scale (can't find my Haynes off hand
but in the Bentley manual I'm borrowing it is number 22 in figure 7-4 on page
21 of chapter 5) on the fan housing a replacement was still available about
two years ago from VW.  I got mine from Capitol Imports in Columbus, Ohio
before I came up here in Jan 94.  It's black plastic instead of the original
painted metal but it makes getting TDC and getting timed a LOT easier.

Hope this helps.

The canvas is the child cot that goes over the front seat.  Just not a very
big child.
