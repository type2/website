Subject: Westy Fridge Modification

I have been having trouble lighting the Dometic frig in the 84 Westy.  This
weekend I removed it to clean the burner etc.  No problem removing it and
cleaning.  I notice in Bently that they have published a &quot;modification&quot; to
the pump and one way valve on the top of the Type 182 Dometic frige.

The modification appears to involve a new one way valve and drilling out
the pump and valve.  It also suggests a new &quot;O&quot; ring (available from
hardware store).  Has anyone any knowledge about this mod.  Should I do it
while it is out?  Is it to correct difficult lighting?  What is it to
correct?

Any info will help while I still have the frig out.  TIA Don.
