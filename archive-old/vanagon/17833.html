&gt; I think you probably know and just used the wrong word accidently,
&gt; But Don't hook 'em up in series.  Parallel, Pos-Pos and Neg-Neg, is what
&gt; you want to do.

Perhaps he meant to say &quot;a couple of 6-volt deep cycle&quot; batteries.  The
six volt deep cycles, aka Golf cart batteries, seem to last longer and
be rated higher than their 12V counterparts.
