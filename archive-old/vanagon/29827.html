&gt;After seeing a friend's 220D Benz with a fuel cell in the trunk
&gt;I wanted one too.  I thought that a good location would be under the rear
&gt;seat/folding bed.  The only thing separating it from the stock fuel
&gt;tank is sheet metal, so plumbing them together would be fairly simple.
&gt;
&gt;That would put the fuel cell inside the cabin area and I have an uneasy
&gt;feeling about doing that.  I store the westy tent poles and the camp
&gt;stove in that spot instead.

seeing as how splitty gas tanks are notoriously small i seem to recall
someone putting in a &quot;newer&quot; stlye (i.e. 1971) fuel tank in their split. i
can't recall how difficult the fit was, it may have had something to do w/
the fuel filler neck. personally i think the easiest way to drag along more
gas is a leakproof/smellproof jerry can that fits in yer spare tire (donut
shaped gas cans are fitted as oem on bimmers and some volvo's in europe. i
seem to recall that they are not &quot;legal&quot; in canada, dunno about usa. fwiw
the tants were going for $50.00 for a 1 gallon can!, ymmv)

to be a complete bore, does anyone know of the &quot;legality&quot; of installing
extra fuel tanks. i know up here for example, propane conversions can only
be carried out by licensed practisioner's??

a special p.s. to matt, did that gas tank that came w/ yor sundial camper
(was that a thing put in at the factory, or a mod of the dreaded &lt;tm&gt;
p.o.????
