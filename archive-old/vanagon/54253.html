Subject: Mexican Vehicles, Samon Flambeu, The way to San Jose busses


	Philip in Mobile.
	Ask to see a title. If the two Mexican beetles have plates,
then they should have titles. Dealer plates don't count. I'd get
it in writing that the vehicles are sold as titleable in Alabama AND
the other 49, and get local DMV to back that up, beore I paid for one.

	Steamy Tom.
	Kennedy conspiracy theories have more dignity, dude.

	Ryan wannabus in San Jose,
	My experience is that the Mercury News classifieds are the richest,
SF Chronicle being a poor second. Best bet when purchasing an old car
is to hang with people who are into that kind of old car... well 
obviously you've got that part wired. Check the for-sale boards at
1) Bugformance Sunnyvale, 
2) New Dimensions, 
3) San Jose, Automotion, Santa Clara.
Expect to find a fair number of busses for sale all around the Bay Area,
though- Santa Cruz, Berkeley, and the Penninsula might contain the car
of your dreams. If you can wait about three months, the Kelly Park VW show 
is a SUPERP place to shop for a bus. Just don't be pressured into comitting 
to a sale  there and then- Be prepared to put down a check or cash,
for a recept, to hold the bus until Monday. Find the bus you want, get a 
competent mechanic to  look it over, buy if if you like it after you know 
what's wrong.
