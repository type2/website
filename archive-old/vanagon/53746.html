Subject: Need Advice on repairing rust areas

What is the best way to do small areas of body rust-a few at a time?  
What should I use to sand with-what to prime with?  Our camper is white 
and has the typical small rust areas near the seams and on the front.
Does anyone know if they used &quot;clear coat&quot; over the paint on '85s?
Any advice would be appreciated.
