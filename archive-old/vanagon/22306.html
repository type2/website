To All:

Certified aircraft wiring is usually tin or silver (!) coated, not bare
copper, except for certain battery and/or GPU circuits.

Aircraft wiring is usually provided with an abrasion shield over the
insulator.

The crimping tool for aircraft crimp-on electrical fittings is about 18&quot; long
and generates several thousand pounds of pressure at the jaws, insuring a
gas-tight joint.  The typical pliers-type crimping tool used for automotive
work generates a few hundreds pounds of force and does not insure a gas-tight
joint.  If the joint is not gas-tight, it will eventually corrode, especially
if you spend much time flying very near the ground.

If you have access to aircraft quality wiring, fittings and tools you will no
doubt have used them when making electrical repairs to your automobiles.  But
if you do not have these things your automotive electrical repairs will last
longer and provide better service if you solder  as well as hand-crimp all
connections.  This assumes you will use non-corrosive resin-cored solder
suitable for electrical work and not corrosive solder as used in plumbing.

To provide vibration resistance at the connector, where the solder will
indeed result in hardening of the copper conductor and promote early fatigue
failure, use at least three layers of heat-shrink tubing, each layer being
slightly longer than the other, so as to distribute any flexing stresses.

Aircraft and automotive wiring should be assembled in looms or bundles of
wire, fastened in sleeves so the wires may contribute support to each other.
 All wiring should be fastened to the chassis/structure so as to prevent
vibration.

If you perform aerobatics with your Volkswagen you should consider
installation of a gel-cell battery, and make some provision for operating the
engine in an inverted postion.
