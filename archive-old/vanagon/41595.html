Subject: Re: Heater to cool question

Jared Roy asks if running aircooled Vgon heat in the summer would help cool
the engine.  Not measurably, I think.  The heater flapper boxes just deter-
mine whether the heated air is ducted out next to the transmission or in-
side the car.  They don't affect the volume.  The difference MIGHT make a
difference if you were idling in traffic, where heated air from the engine
could rise next to the car and get pulled into the intakes; and the dif-
ference might make a difference if the seals around your engine are bad.
But if you are moving at all, your misery wouldn't help your engine.
