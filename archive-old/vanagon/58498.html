Subject: Re: Tire Recommendations for VW Buses

Several weeks ago a number of us hashed out info on tires. There should be
lots if info from the discussion in the Archives.

Based on that discussion and my personal research, I did opt to buy the
Michelin reinforced 205/70R14 MXT _at_ $91.00 ea. for my '91 Westy. I did buy
them from the TireRack. My experience with them was very good. I ordered
them and had them shipped directly to the Dealer in Brainerd, MN who installed
them at no additional charge. The correct tires arrived 'on time' as promised
by the TireRack and I was billed properly. My experience with this 'long dis-
tance' purchase and install was very good.

&gt; There seems to be some frustration on the lists about what tires are available for use on VW 
&gt; buses.
&gt; 
&gt; I contacted the Tire Rack and Max Jones forwarded the following recommended tires for use on 
&gt; VW buses:

&gt; 
&gt; Disclaimer -- My intent is not to specifically recommend the Tire Rack as a source of tires.  
&gt; I have never done business with them previously, other than to buy some snow tires for a 
&gt; non-VW vehicle, which went fine.  My intent is only to provide you with this information for 
&gt; reference when you need to buy tires for your bus.
&gt; 
&gt; Comment about Conti tires -- I personally can not recommend the purchase of Conti 
&gt; (Continental) tires.  My experiences with their tires in the past where not a good ones.
