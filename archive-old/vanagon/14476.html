&gt; 
&gt; &gt;What causes are there for backfiring (mine's starting to do it on the 
&gt; &gt;down shift).  I know incorrect timing can cause this - why exactly?  Is there
&gt; &gt;residual compressed gas in the cylinder during exhaust stroke followed with
&gt; &gt;late ignition?  What other causes can lead to backfiring other than the 
&gt; &gt;timing disorder? 
&gt; 
&gt; Christian,
&gt; 
A commom cause of backfire in the exhaust, particularly on the f.i.
Bus when downshifting will be an air leak into the exhaust, even
a small one, according to my my 30+ year experience VW mechanic,
I didn't particularly believe him and swore that it was running too
rich off throttle causing the problem on my '76, as I had checked the
entire system and the head gasket seal visually and audibly at his
suggestion.  In the end he was correct, a small fracture had develoed on
the now blocked off tube for the EGR system, crimped it off and welde it
and the backfire dissapeared.
