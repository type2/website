&gt; &gt; one problem w/propane is that in extreme cold (below -10 F) the liquid

&gt; &gt; realize that this doesn't apply to many of you, but it is something to
&gt; &gt; consider.

&gt; Actually it does not take even that low of temperatures, as one
&gt; of the orderes I just started worrying about this as I know from
&gt; winter camping that a standard 20lb bottle will have problems
&gt; generating enough pressure to fire a stove through your average
&gt; 5-10 oz (?) regulator on a 10-20F day.
&gt; Oh well we shall see.

Umm... Consider this.  Chris Gibbs, the original person to post about
