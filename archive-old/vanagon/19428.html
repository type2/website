Subject: bus/camper questions

Hi all, I'm reletively new to this list so I'll tell you my story.  I recently
acquired a '73 bus with an automatic tranny and have been working on getting it
ready for the road.  I really wanted to have a camper but this bus just came
along one day as I was driving to work in my '73 squareback.  It was too cheap
($400) and too rustfree to refuse.  I started designing some sort of foldout
bed and such for the interior but then my local VW guru guy (I'm sure every
torn has one) told me about a '71 Westfalia rotting behind someone's house
(just one mile away from my own house!).  Less than an hour later, I purchased
this westy for a mere $50.  To make a long story short (is it too late for
that?) it had a mint interior which is now almost completely transplanted into
the bus.  Right now I'm cleaning out the sink/icebox and being really scared
about cutting a hole in my floor for the drain.  Okay, now for the questions:

1. Exactly how does the icebox work, i.e where do I put ice?  I have a
tray-shelf with a drain hose attached.  Does ice just sit on that?  I think I
may need an owner's manual.  Is there an electric refrigerator I could use
instead? (12V)

2. I want to install the jalousey windows instead of the vent/solid combo.  I
know I will need to screw them in but how do I get the old ones out?  Do I just
pop them out the other side?

3. I've almost totally decided NOT to install the poptop.  Even though it's
really cool, there's something very comforting about having a solid roof over
my head (plus I'd have to replace the canvas).  But I really want to put a roof
rack up there.  Is there a rack to fit my bus besides the one with the poptop?
and where can I get it?

4. What do I do with a very sad looking (almost) completely empty camper with a
type I engine (probably runs, but I'm not gonna try it) and a standard tranny,
neither of which I have much use for.  Is there anyone on Long Island who needs
some parts?

Thnak you for your time.

Erik
