Subject: Vanagon Westy insulated?
Date: Mon, 11 Sep 95 20:08:53 EDT

Is the Vanagon Westy insulated? When I fixed some rust around my
fridge flue vent and hookups I found about 2&quot; of fiberglass in that area.
Could somebody who has looked behind the other body panels tell me
if there is insulation there also?

I plan to winterize my Westy by insulating it, and adding some kind of 
heater. I figure insulating pays off real well. Suppose there is
no insulation in there now. My guess is that the body has an R value
of around 2, and the glass is R 1. Actually all single panel parts
of the body is more like R 1. A gross guess on total R value for the
van would be 1.5.

Current state is that even when driving, the car stays pretty cold.
When stopped it cools down rapidly to the outside temperature.

Suppose the R value was doubled. That would mean:

	I only need a half as powerful heater, half the fuel etc.

	Van keeps the temperature better (Stays warmer longer in winter,
	cooler in summer)

Doubling the R value ought to be easy. One might even be able to quadruple
it. I'll come back with more precise calulations once I learn more
of what insulation might already be present. 

Some ways of insulating I though about are:

	Put a piece of rigid insulation (Dow styrofoam .75&quot;, R3) in the 
	pop top, so that it is held in place when the pop top is closed. 
	(I won't try to	improve insulation in the poptop open case). 
	Difficulty: How to seal well around the edges of the insulation, 
	and how to avoid condensation on the inside of the poptop roof.

	Put basement style, fairly rigid fiberglass between the body and
	the interior panels in all accessible places. (R 3 per inch)

Alternatives for the floor :

	Place a piece of (say 3/4&quot;) rigid insulation on
	top of it (Make cut outs for the fridge ventilation)
	Put a carpet on top of it.

	Stuff the cavities between the structural crossmembers with
	basement fiberglass.

	Mount a sheet of rigid insulation to the beams under the body. 
	This need to be bent a little to attach both to the beams and
	the sides of the body. The area around the propane tank, and
	gas (diesel) tank) would remain uninsulated.

Any insulation put under the car is likely to disintegrate after
a few years, but that is less of a concernt to me, since it's easy
to replace.	


Places I'm more doubtful about: Should I try to insulate the front part
at all, or would it be easier to try to just shut it off, and how could
it be shut off effectively. (I don't think simply hanging a blanket
is very efficient in terms of insulating r-value) 

The window R value can be increased (To R 2) by one of those house window
kits using a sheet of plastic. I've bought a set to experiment with
consisting of 4 mil vinyl, and some plastic strips to make a pop in
frame for the vinyl. 

Comments or alternatives to these ideas are welcome.
