Ok, I don't know about you, but I can't read the Statz for beans.  It's the 
part about &quot;where you all tell me you are&quot;.  I think it's standard 
abreviations for states and countries, but the alphabetic order seems hosed,
or do we just have a lot of canadian listees???? (Where the heck is 
CAN.ON.OTT, CAN.BC.VAN etc. etc..., anyway??)

Dont know for shure either, would guess it is CANADA.ONTARIO.OTTAWA or CANADA 
BR.COLUMBIA.VANCOUVER etc. 

ACTUALLY - I'm hoping there are lots of Canadian vanogoners, in fact, I hope
most of them have Syncro's.  And do we have anyone in South Africa?? and how
about the members in Europe/England/the Nordic countries etc???

About Europe: Ever had a look at the syncro Westie Hompage of Tom Forhan 
within the last weeks ? 

In France there are about 80 syncros organized in syncro Club France - 

p_oudot_at_wordnet.fr can tell you more about that.

In Germany, Austria, Belgium, Sweden we have almost 90 members in the Ig 
syncro 16'' not all of them have a 16'' or even a syncro - others have two or 
three.

To estimate from that, there should be several thousand syncros in private 
ownership over here. Probably only few owners have Internet and email access 
in the old world.

I'd like to ask you to call your local or not so local favorite 
dealer/aftermarketer/shop/whatever and track down what the correct front 
Bilstein shock is for a SYNCRO Vanagon, vintage '84 or so on to '91.  I'm
getting some info here in the states, but so far no confirmation that such and 
such a Bilstein is the correct one for the SYNCRO front.  
The front shock for the SYNCRO is different because it has a spring perch on 
it.  The standard Vanagon front shock does not.

Tim Smith from Canada smitht_at_unb_dot_ca has a service manual as far as I know - 
maybe he could be helpful for your project.

Bye, best regards
