Subject:       Desk Trophies! /f?

I have on MY desk a vial of teeth from the front axle ring gear on a 
4WD Scout.  I tore them out one night when I was stuck in snow and 
didn't want to walk the short distance to home to get help.  A 
painful (and expensive) reminder to take it easy, don't force it, get 
help, and admit your errors!      yeouch.
