Michael, Sorry for the delay,I'm still having problems with my mail to you. I 
think the deal you mentioned would be fine. I will be able to pick up the 
interior either late on 4/19 or early on 4/20. I think I will be able to fit 
all of it in my bus.if not I will bring the biggest pieces. Let me know where 
I'm going and who I'm contacting. Once again sorry to take so long getting 
back, I just got back from a two day camping trip with the family.Talk to you 
soon! Tom Czerniak
