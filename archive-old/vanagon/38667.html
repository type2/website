Subject: 85 vanagon-takes gas, klacks like a diesel

Well, me noise has come to stay and do its best 
impression of a diesel motor it can... same power, 
acceloraton, and noise.

	 Nearest Thing 
I can track it down to now is I can *feel the rapid 
mayhem right at the intake air distributor box. It's 
like something is being moved around in ways it was not 
designed to do inside. Of course, it could be something 
else..

Theories abound!

1) The distributor box is clanging around because:

A) Somethings broken in the box itself.
B) Valves or other timing failures are creating 
backpressure that oscillates a flap inside.
C) The manifold pipes are transferring the noises from 
the real problem into a nice echo chamber, i.e. the box.
D) somebody dropped a penny in the rear vent and it's 
found its way into the workings.
E) None of the above. 


Bonus Essay: Given same conditions, explore oxidation 
theory, as postulated by rust puddle in old fuel filter.
You have five minutes to complete your essay. Begin now.

I want to thanke evereyone once again for helping me get 
through this breaking period. It may never stop, but..

BTW, is $600 reasonable for a motor? That's if all else 
fails... :(   ..and just about what the IRS owes me. :)
