Subject: Master Cylinder-67 Type II?

Hello Volks,

I know this is Friday (and no I don't want a '72
swamp/police bus) but can I interrupt the frivolity long
enough to ask a SERIOUS question?

Does anybody know where I can get a brake master cylinder
for a '67 Type II.  Yes, I know it's a (most of a)
one-year-only item.  I have three '67 Type II's, and it's
only a problem for one right now, but I don't see the future
for this situation getting any better.  At this point I'd be
happy to find even a rebuild kit for the thing.

Since VW changed mid-year (my early (#008082) still has the
single circuit cylinder), would it make any sense to convert
to that or a '68 and later cylinder?

Any leads would be appreciated.
