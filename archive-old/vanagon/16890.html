&gt;Can someone send me the VAGON digest FAQ.  I couldn't access it

ok. on its way. if you want any of the other stuff out there, i can get it
via gopher and ship it to you (like fuel injection data from bosch ... just
mostly part numbers and which cars used which parts).

&gt;via the WWW.  I'm mainly interested in a list of parts vendors
&gt;with catalogs that interest me, a 84 Vanagon owner.  I have something
&gt;like four catalogs for parts for my Datsun '72 240Z and find them
&gt;invaluable.  Does such a thing exist for the Vanagon land?

well .. no. there's not a helluva lot for vanagons. yet. maybe. some day.
there IS a thing from germany called a Bildkatalog ... which is like a
home-shopping service from vw for vanagons. but all it is are the pictures
from the dealer microfiche and you circle the part you want and mail it in.
they ship it to you. but you don't know the price in advance. :( &lt;i guess
you call the dealer?&gt; it is helpful in figuring out what goes where and
so forth.

hope it helps.
