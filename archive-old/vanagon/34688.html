&gt; 
&gt; Battery tray? What battery tray?? Mine has a plywood floor with no tray, no
&gt; straps, no nothin' ... explains why the rear running light(s) are nonexistent
&gt; - got bonked off by a shifting 60 lb box...

In one of our '71 busses we use a piece of plywood (resists corrosion)
and some styrofoam to keep the battery in place. The foam works just
great at keeping the battery from breaking the tail light or the side
light.
