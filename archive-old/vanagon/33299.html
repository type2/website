Ahh, you're learning what the German Army (and Luftwaffe, and ...)
learned fifty-odd years ago.  According to my father, who was there,
the general solution was to never shut down anything you got started.
Use the lightest oil you can get (for them, the choices were rather
few).  These days, there are anti-gelling additives for diesel.  They
had to heat their fuel tanks (and people complain about Eberspachers
being bombs!).  Just be glad you aren't trying to fly a small plane in
those conditions.

FWIW, the Gerbil (a '66) gets really stiff in the shifter and steering
at around 15 F above.  I suspect it would be completely immobilized at
-48, assuming you could convince me I had to go somewhere in it in
temperatures like that....
