Subject: &quot;Skipping&quot; on Deccelleration

Don't know if you've been following my saga of late, but I probably will
get one of those flying idiot awards for the forgotten pre-heater hose. 
The van's running much better now. I logged about 30 miles today. 8)

My wife thinks you all are probably growing tired of my daily 
questions...or that you must think I'm totally incompetent. I hope you'll 
bear with me. I've learned VERY much since joining the list and of late 
I've even been able to make intelligent comments on the problems of 
others. As I've said before, I'm involved in a resurrection; not a 
restoration. My van was severely neglected and I'm having to learn as I 
go. The learning is deep and sometimes hard. I owe special thanks to Bob 
Hoover, who's always been willing to listen and make suggestions. Bob has 
been like a guide to me and many others and deserves public thanks, 
though I suspect he would be modest in his view of his own contributions.
The fact is, without the help of Bob and MANY more of you, I would have 
sold this bus by now, defeated, tired, and depressed. Instead, I am 
striving for excellence.

The Problem at Hand
-------------------

One thing I noticed today that concerns me, is that on deccelleration, I'm
getting that &quot;power burp&quot; I described earlier. That is, a slight, sporatic
loss of power, like one of cylinders is failing to fire and then starts
back up. Seems to only happen once the bus has warmed up well. Say, after
a couple of miles of driving. 

Since I &quot;rebuilt&quot; this engine without splitting the case, I'm constantly
wondering about things I couldn't check...like the distributor shaft. I'm
going to check valves again (hopefully tomorrow) and adjust timing and
carb one more time. I haven't done any of this since I got the preheater
hose on, and I imagine that with it in place there may be a noticeable
difference in the way the carb adjusts out. 

I seem to recall reading that if the distributor shaft is worn,
timing adjustments won't remain stable. Is that true? What else can I look
for? 

I'm kinda hoping that I was somehow compensating for the missing pre-heat
hose and that now the system is out of whack. But as always, I'd rather be
correct than foolishly satisfied. 

Also, the distributor I have on the bus now is old. It squeaks a little
when I start the bus (the shaft against the plastic side of the points). 
Come to think of it, I might need to add a little non-conductive lubricant
to keep this from wearing the back of the points...effectively throwing
them out of adjustment. 

Comments? Suggestions?

Thanks MUCHO! Joe
