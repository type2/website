Subject:       The Warranty Company.

I got a letter in the mail yesterday congratulating me on the 
purchace of a new(used) vehicle.  The letter went on to offer me an 
unlimited milage warranty on everything in the engine and trans 
including the clutch for $101.  They also offer an extended warranty 
which covers the electrical system and some of the suspension for 
$156.  Both of these prices are for a year of coverage and are 
renewable. They also claim that their warranty is accepted at every 
garage in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico.  along with reimbursments for 
parts and labor to do it yourselfers.  I have never heard of The 
Warranty Company, or anyone offering non factory or delar warranties 
on used cars.  I find it a little strange because they don't want to 
inspect the car or anything.  also, there weren't any indications on 
what might void the warranty.  Most places won't replace your engine 
if you run it out of oil or somthing.  and, there is a one time only 
deductable of $50.
    I am really leary of things that come unsolicited in the mail 
like this and would like some feedback from anyone that has heard 
of or had experience with this company. It's kinda one of those too 
good to be true things like the letter stuffing gig.
  Hmmmmm, Now how do I get this deal on my bus.  OOOOO DOGGIE!
Thanks.
Ed.
