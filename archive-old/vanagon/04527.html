Subject: 5-seater Westy?
Date: Sat, 24 Sep 1994 01:09:07 -0500 (EDT)


Hello, Vanagoners -

I'm seething with jealousy every time I read another post from you
smug-happy Westy owners (you know who you are... :{) ).

I'd obviously love to have one myself, having grown up with 3 VW 
campers, but I have a family of *5*.  And no, leaving someone at home
is not an option - get off the list *now* if you feel that way...

Does anybody know how to maintain the Vanagon's capability as a
5-person people mover and yet enjoy the go-anywhere-anytime freedom
of those wonderful Westy's?  I'm thinking specifically of fitting a 
jumpseat behind the forward passenger's seat, as is done (on both
sides) in some of the late Wolfsburg Edition Vanagons.  

-- 
Peace.
