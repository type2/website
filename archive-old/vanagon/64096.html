Do the new tires have reinforced sidewalls. Swaying is the reason  these
vehicles call for them.

&gt;Hello out there...
&gt;
&gt;At highway speeds my '85 Westy vanagon seems to be swaying &lt;&lt;snip&gt;&gt;
&gt;1.  Is this normal or seem about right?
&gt;2.  Can I beef up my shocks to improve the situation?
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;Ivan
&gt;p.s., I have brand new tires if that's a piece of the puzzle.
