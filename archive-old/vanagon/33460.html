I've done this too.  Also tried the Locktite option that Jim described.
Works, but I don't think it's differential thermal expansion, so much as
vibration and repeated R&amp;R of the fuel line (anybody figure out how many
times THIS is done over the normal lifespan of a carburetor??).  I also
have had to do a similar act on the little pin that keeps the throttle cam
from spinning all the way around.  I find a nail the same size as the roll
pin, cut the pointy end off and tap it in with a hammer.  These still work
out eventually, so I pinch them with dikes and tap them in again.  Guess
you could run a bottoming tap in of the appropriate size and put in a
machine screw...
