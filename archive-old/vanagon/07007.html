A few months ago, I replaced the stock exhaust system on my
(fuel-injected) 75 Bus with a Monza. Today we've had the first kinda
chilly day in Missouri and all of a sudden I realize that the Monza
doesn't have a preheater pipe. 

In the sheet metal at the rear (rear is rear) of the engine, there are 2
holes, about 2 in. (5cm) in diameter, one on the right and one on the left. 
There is a hose from the right hole to the air intake thingy. I'm not
sure what the left one does -- doesn't seem to have a purpose. (I'm sure all
these parts have names but automotive vocabulary is not my strength :-) )

Anyway, my plan is to plug those 2 holes, unless someone advises against
it. 

Thanks in advance,

Sami
