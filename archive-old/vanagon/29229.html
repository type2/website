Subject: RE:  Weekender Seat Conversion

My friend here in the far North just purchased an '86 Syncro for $3,200, 
so he's no longer interested in the Diesel Camper.  Unfortunately the 
Syncro was not a weekender.  I seem to recall that one of the outfits in 
California used to offer a conversion kit for converting the rear seat 
into a bed, somewhat like the VW weekender.  Does anyone have any 
information on this conversion - name of the company, drawings, etc. 

If not, does anyone have a line on a rear seat from a weekender.  He is 
also interested in stove, fridge, etc.

Thanks in advance.

Fred, 
84 Vanagons
