Subject:      If your plug wires are aging, here an easy tester that's FREE

I've had my '88 Vanagon about 4 months and have had some intermittent
ignition problems at low RPMs within 1/2 hour of starting - i.e. it will
die at a traffic light, start right back up though.  More aggravating than
anything else.

Here's what I found.  I tried looking at the engine in the DARK.  Wow, a
real light show!  There were flashes all over those plug wires, especially
where they ran next to a metal object.  I even found a real bright
consistent spark between the metal shield on the left rear plug boot and
the copper ground wire that runs next to it.  Didn't take any special tools
to see any of this either.

I suspect that these are the original wires and about 10 years old.  They
are going to be retired next week.  I'll keep you posted as to whether or
not this fixes my errant stalling problem.
