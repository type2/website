Subject: Wanabuymy bus? or: heading east?--need a ride?

I've been off the list for a while, kind of got into a VW slump for a bit.
My van's ('76 non-westy camper) on the west coast (Washington) and I live
on the East coast (NYC) which means it sits around deteriorating most of
the time.  It runs and drives great, freshly rebuilt 2 liter engine w/hydr.
valve conversion, new Monza muffler, everything mechanical is up to specs.
including heat (no gas heater though), there's very minor rust, but the
camper portion is a bit shabby. The only thing I know is wrong with it is
an annoying moan from the main bearing in the tranny.  I've heard they can
go a long time like this so I've been living with it for now.  Also,
somewhere down the line a previous owner removed the pollution control
stuff, it might need to be replaced if one was planning on registering it
in one of the more populated parts of the country.

If anyone happens to be in the mood to drive it east for me I would pay
their airfare back to wherever...let me know.

or...if anyone's interested in buying it please get in touch.  I've got
about $3,500 into it, but I know it's not worth that much.  Make me an
offer.
