Subject: Re: Refrigerator

I get my refrigerator to work better with a little tiny air circulation 
Radio Shack 12 volt fan inside the refrige and a 2nd bigger Radio Shack fan
in the back to blow heat away from the rear heat exchanger fins. 

I have an extra fridge but I am planning to keep it for when my current
fridge goes bad.
