Subject: Second batteries
Date: Wed, 13 Apr 94 15:34:51 PDT

&gt; I saw a note about someone asking if anyone had put a second battery into
&gt; their bus.. I've got a 73 and would be interested in the info too... I was
&gt; thinking about possibly running a deep-cycle as a a second, mostly for
&gt; camping (leaving the lights and radio on, etc)..

I have done this.  In fact, I have *two* deep cycle group 27 batteries to
the left of my motor.  They are turned sideways compared to the third
(original) batteries.  The best batteries I could find are the Die-Hard
deep cycles, which are over 200 mins reserve capacity at 25 amps.  I
have one of those, and a Motocraft Deep cycle with about 150 mins reserve
capacity.  They run the fridge and lights for two days without
recharging - I really love this setup!!

p.s. How do I get out of the &quot;digest mode&quot; on the mailing list?? I liked
it better when I got individual messages...
