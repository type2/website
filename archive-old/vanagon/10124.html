Oooops, forgot another little detail, heh heh.

The tube that feeds the Coke bottle is simply a 3' length of cheap gasline 
clear vinyl (?). It's about 1/4&quot; outside, and I tapered the end slightly so 
that the bleed hole screw threads would grab on. Twist the little devil in 
really well, since you don't want it sucking air in there, rather, coolant 
from your Coke bottle overflow tank on the windshield. A good garage should 
be able to cut some threads onto a piece of copper tube to screw in, then 
slip the tubing onto that. That's too elegant for myself, being quick and 
dirty whenever possible. No chance a brake bleeder valve (VW or other) would 
screw in ? It couldn't stay there fulltime, but would let you slip a hose on 
more readily.    tim s.


PS: my SO has softened somewhat towards my imminent Synchro purchase,&quot;Fine, 
you can buy it if it doesn't cost us any money&quot;. I just have to sell my 
panel, and trade in my Civic.  Doesn't appreciate the notion of VW 
collecting, unfortunately.

PPS: I'm asking $4,800Cdn/$US3,400. Is this too much, too little? Any takers?

'85 Panel, white w/ black  trim, tinted/shaded winshield/ deep tinted sides/back
161,000 Kilometers, drips (very slightly) from one head gasket. 1971 Westy 
interior, no pop-top but louvered window in sliding door. Front hammock etc. 
Rock solid, Rust-Checked / tar undersprayed annually, surface rust in seams, 
long scrape on drivers side at marker height. A veritable tank of a vehicle 
(3/4 ton rating), and fun to drive too.
