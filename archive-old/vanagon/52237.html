&gt; Hey,
&gt; All right, one of you gurus explain to me what the gross vehicle weight
&gt; rating (GVWR) found on the sticker in the doorjamb really means.  Is it
&gt; the actual weight of the vehicle?  My '81 Westy has a GVWR of 5093 lbs.
&gt; 
&gt; If this is not the actual weight, what is? 

This seems a bit high for actual weight. If your Westy has A/C, built
in sink, etc., etc. (the works), this may be actual weight.

My 82' Vanagon (7-pass w/all seats, NO A/C) weights 3680 lbs. (actual).
