I had good luck with Akers (capital hill) when I had my '82 camper.  They 
only worked on air-cooled, so I ended up going to Carter (ballard) when I 
bought the '91 Westy - not bad for a dealer shop (but of course by the 
book and pricey).  Incidentally, if you try Akers, make sure you get a 
look at Denny Akers rodded up Vanagon.  Looks stock, aside from the 
unconcealable performance exhaust system, but he's got a 300 BHP Porsche 
engine stuffed in there.  I guess he'll even give rides - but I'm chicken!
