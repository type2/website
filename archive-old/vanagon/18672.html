Subject: RE: FWD: 82 VW Westfalia Diesel 4sale $4500

Matt W. asks if I mind reposted for sale notices.  The only times I mind are
when noone buys what I sell (e.g. cheap Porsche engine STILL waiting for
a buyer) or when for sale notices don't have a geographical indication, so
I know whether I'm shopping or just doing price comparisons when I read.
In that regard, the cheap Porsche engine is $1500 and in North Jersey.
