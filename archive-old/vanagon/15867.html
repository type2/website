Subject:      Franklin Mint Microbus

well, i got another sucker-letter in the mail today from Franklin Mint,
wanting me to buy their Classic Microbus, for ONLY 5 equal payments of
$27* each (*Plus my state sales tax and a one-time shipping charge of $4.95),
with the first payment due prior to shipment.  &quot;all orders subject to
acceptance&quot;. HA!

even got a letter on vw letterhead, from Stiftung AutoMuseum Volkswagen,
Dieselstrasse 35 - 3180 Wolfsburg 1. Dr. Bernd Wiersch.

is this the &quot;sales increase&quot; vw was talking about? :)

anyhoo, was anybody stupi ... er, Dedicated (yeah, that's it!) enough to
buy this thing? :)  i'm kinda curious as to the quality/etc.

not that i would buy it, mind you. not at that price, anyway. just curious.

joel
