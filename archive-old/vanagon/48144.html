Subject: type of cat &amp; windshield seal


Hi,
	I want to order a catalytic converter from Kyle ( :-)  )
and he asked me what type of flanges it has. Now part of the problem
is that the van is not here right now and I have to order this today
to get it as quickly as possible. The other problem is that I'd have
to see the types of &quot;flanges&quot; to be able to describe how mine is 
different from the others..
	My mechanic (ok, so I don't do *everything* myself) said that
the type of cat should be determinable with the chassis number. Is there
someone who has access to this information on the list? Alternately, 
could someone tell me how the types of cat are different so that I 
could pop home and identify the cat that I have/need?
	Another similar question (sounds really stupid). How do you 
know whether you need a windshield seal *with* or *without* molding??

Thanks.
