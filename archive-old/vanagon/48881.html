Subject: Re: Help: Oil Pressure Light ('89 Vangagon)

I always use20/50 and genuine VW filters.  My engine has been running very
well.  I just got bach from New England and was stuck in traffic from D.C
to Richmond a week ago with the air on and no problems.  i was pretty
impressed.  My power locks have been malfunctioning on the passenger door.
They wont stop going up and down when the door is ajar and will not open
when the door is closed.

&gt; &gt; Mine has done the same thing when I pull of the highway.  I can hit the
&gt; &gt; dash and it goes off.  joel said there was a loose connection between
&gt; &gt; some circuit.  I will put up with it.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi,
&gt; &gt; &gt; The oil pressure light on my '89 Vanagon is worrying me a little.  After I
&gt; &gt; &gt; have been driving on the freeway ~65-70 mph for a few miles and then slow
&gt; &gt; &gt; down to an idle (~800 RPM) the oil pressure light comes on intermittently.
&gt; &gt; &gt; If I increase the RPMs to ~1,000 the light goes off.  I've checked the oil
&gt; &gt; &gt; ..  What's the problem?
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks in Advance,

&gt; What brand of oil filter are you using. ? Change the brand and put in new
&gt; oil, 20/50. Let us know if the problem goes away. Tim and Joel, let's see
&gt; which filter Bo was using :)
