Subject: BBTA/anyone from Central Ohio?

A fellow BusDriver who is not electronically connected has asked me to post
on his behalf.  He's driving out to the Arch, and would like to caravan.
He's driving an early 70s bus--I haven't seen it yet so can't give further
details.  He's planning to leave late Thursday or early Friday from Marion,
Ohio.  Anyone in the area heading out there?
