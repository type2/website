Subject: Re: EV Parts Hauler...  And animal hauler

&gt; To date the EV has hauled passengers, kids, furniture, a dining room set, 
&gt; etc., but today was its first mission as parts hauler. I finally got around 
&gt; to getting down to my local VW dealer where the parts manager volunteered to 
&gt; pull the frozen brake drums off of my spare tranny for the '56 beetle.
&gt; 
&gt; So out went the two jump seats (5 minutes - remove and bring into the 
&gt; house), in went a tarp on the floor, and off my son and I went.

I guess know by know I breed ferrets.  At one ferret show when everyone 
else was having problems with snow  we loaded my whole family.  A friend 
of ours and some two dozen ferrets in nearly as many cages in the EV MV.  
We took out the jump seats and put them in the hotel room - how often 
have you seen someone put car seats in a hotel room?  We had ten of the 
animal carriers behind the bench seat and a whole mess of cages in the 
&quot;middle&quot;.  Five passenger - counting me driving.

&gt; Nothing like having a passenger hauler/furniture mover/pickup/camper all in 
&gt; one vehicle!

Lets see.  Wading pool that I some someone struggle to get in a full size 
American van.  Hundreds of pounds of ferret and dog food and wood stove 
pellets (ferret litter).  A full set of furniture for our baby.  Crib, 
changing table/cabinnet, dresser and all the assorted stuff that we got 
at the same time.  All kinds of antigue furniture and odd runs that would 
NOT have fit as easily in the old camper.  Jump seats pop out REAL fast.  
The Carat/Multivan vanagon would do about as well if their seats come out 
as easily.  Lose some room because of the engine compartment but I think 
the EV cargo area is a bit shorter because of the upfront engine room. 
Ric, do you know?

Only thing it is not as good for as my little truck is the weekly dump 
runs.  I'm not putting plastic bags full of what used to be in the ferret 
litter boxes in my EV.  I can spray out the truck bed and cap with a hose....

I won't trade MINE for some silly little AWD station wagon just because 
Paul Hogan advertises it.... &lt;g&gt;
