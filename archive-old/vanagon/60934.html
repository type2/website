&gt; I could not dive the vehicle any more since the serpentine belt, TYHE
&gt; ONLY belt, wss broken. 

FWIW, as some may recall, I lost a belt on my 93 GL (Stella) a few years ago
due to a rat attack.  I drove Stella home that night and to the dealer the
next day.  Put probably 50 miles on her sans-a-belt.  Steering was a
little harder (without power), but she drove just fine.
