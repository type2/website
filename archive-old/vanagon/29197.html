Subject: re: SHARAN article in HVWs

&gt;
&gt;May, 1995 issue of Hot VWs has an article on the Sharan-- in their
&gt;pictures, it looks like a CHrysler minivan. About that size, seating
&gt;capacity, and shape. In other words... it's too d*mned small!
&gt;
&gt;The article includes the rumor of a supercharged VR6 engine as an
&gt;option, and comments on a &quot;high-performance&quot; minivan being right for
&gt;today's market.
&gt;
&gt;But I didn't read the whole thing... no babes in the pictures.   :^)
&gt;

You can find detailed info &amp; pictures at www.vw.iplus_dot_com/VAG, just follow
the links to Der Sharan. The page is all in German but a few words standout,
there is a VR6 option and a diesel as well if I recall. Not sure about the
diesel, but the VR6 for sure. Van looks like a Ford Windstar. I'm told they
won't be coming into the US.
