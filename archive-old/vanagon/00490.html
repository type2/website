&gt;&gt; Isn't it true that it is not good for the car to let the gas get
&gt;&gt; so low?  You are then &quot;feeding&quot; sludge from the bottom of the tank,
&gt;&gt; and not good for fuel injectors, etc.?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;	I don't think this would hurt a vanagon; aren't they bottom 
&gt;feeders to begin with??
&gt;
&gt;	JUST KIDDING!!!! :) :) :) :) 8)
&gt;
Doesn't the fuel line feeding from the tank pull from the BOTTOM????  
Wouldn't the BOTTOM be where the dirt is????
Wouldn't the BOTTOM be where the water is????

Besides the fuel line feeding from the BOTTOM of the tank, the fuel
injection system pumps WAY more fuel than the engine needs, and it is
returned to the tank.  This effectively filters the contents of the tank
over and over again!!!  Unless you are running without a filter, or have
something really dirty (I think you'ed have to dump sand in the tank) I
don't think the Vanagon's are really prone to problems by running the tank
dry.

Not meant to flame, if someone has a viable reason for this old superstition
I would like to hear.  I just think if you got some bad gas/sludge that it
would manifest itself fairly soon (like as you pulled out of the station!!)
