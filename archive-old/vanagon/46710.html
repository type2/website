My only mode of transportation, I need something more dependable.

1600cc engine just put in, about 10k on the engine, 102k I think on bus
recently inspected (may 96)
recent brakes (may 96)
Some rust on lower panels, but solid floor
rear inside in good shape, front seats need work
no poptop canvas
overall good shape
In sounthern maryland

Hoping to get $1200, but give me some offers.
Any questions let me know. Thanks.
