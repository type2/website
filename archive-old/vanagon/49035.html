Subject: BBTA Rpt:  Zorm is a '58 and made the trip!

Hi all,

A belated trip rpt from Buses by the Arch.  I ended up taking Zorm the
Euro Single Cab after all!  It did okay, pretty low geared for the I-70
rush hour express from Kansas City to St. Louis, a couple of aggravating 
traffic jams without 1st gear.  8-(  But, it was fun driving a splittie
rather than my old faithful H2o Vanagon for a change.

Thanks to Dave Easterwood for discovering my truck is really a '58 and not
a '59 (like his) and I actually won a trophy for the first time
ever--'Oldest Transporter' 11th semi-annual BBTA!! 8-)

The encampment was a lot of fun, decent weather too.  An interesting
engine case burn took place that lit up the moonlit sky resembling the
alien ship landing in the movie, &quot;E. T.&quot;!   

Lotsa internet list members were present and we had a nice get together.
93 Buses total. 8-)
