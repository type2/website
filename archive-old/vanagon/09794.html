&gt; I have a few small corrections to the material below:

&gt; 1968-74
 
&gt; the interior's on these Westy's didn't change too much (similar in
&gt; appearance to 64-67' Westy's), about the only real big change was the type
&gt; of woodgrain used, and the fact that in 74' the coldbox became a real live
&gt; fridge. The pullout bed was situated more to the driver's side o' the van,
&gt; with the long linen closet running the length of the passenger side o' the
&gt; van.
&gt; 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Interiors remained nearly identical through the 1973 model year. When the
  pop-top changed in 1974, it was not longer possible to vent the sink 
  throught the roof and it was moved to the left &lt;drivers&gt; side and vents
  throught the wall below the passenger window. The water system got an
  electric pump at the same time. The rear seat is full width and the 
  hanging locker is on the left side over the spare tire well. The stock 
  spare tire was a collapsible that stored in the sink cabinet and was 
  inflated by an electric compressor  that plugged in to the infamous silver
  socket under the glove box. The electric &lt;12V/110V, no propane&gt; fridge was
  part of the &quot;deluxe&quot; camper as was the propane stove. Standard campers have
  an icebox and no stove.

  1975 model year campers are very much like 1974s with the exception of the 
  table. In the '74 the table was hinged to the wall as in the earlier campers.
  It has a little sliding extension that makes it more accessible to the third
  person on the full width seat. The '75 has the pedestal mounted table like
  the later campers and there is an additional place to sit against the wall
  on the drivers side &lt;with storage underneath&gt;
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt; 1975-79
&gt; 
&gt; In 75' the flipped things around. The bed moved closer to the pass. side of
&gt; the van (i.e. the side w/ the sliding door), and the linen closet was
&gt; discontinued, and replaced with a smaller storage closet situated, just
&gt; above the place where the spare tire storage place is (back corner of
&gt; van)In 76' they did a few more mods (all stuff moved to driver's side of
&gt; van, 'cept bed)
&gt;
