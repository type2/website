&gt;
&gt;Just wanted to publicly thank Ron's Bus Depot for coming through when I
badly needed a &quot;VW-Dealer-only&quot; part in a hurry.  He not only beat the
dealer price, but was able to deliver quicker, as none of the 5 dealers in
St. Louis had the plastic cooling-system Tee in stock.
&gt;Nice to have a reliable alternative when living 100 miles from the city!
