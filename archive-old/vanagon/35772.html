Subject: Re: Goodyear Wrangler AT Recomendations?

If considering Goodyear, I would look at the GSA or GSA aquatread in a
215-70/14.  Capacity of 1554 lbs is more than adequate for Vanagon. This
should be an excelent tire for a syncro.  Standard aquatreads provide great
wet traction for normal vans.
