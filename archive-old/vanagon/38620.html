Subject: What does GL mean?
Date: Sat, 30 Mar 1996 15:41:20 GMT

Hi all,
I have done the manditory lurking and read (most) of the info in the
archives and am finally ready to take the step to intorduce myself.
My name is Doug Skinner and I live in Bowling Green, Kentucky. I am
the proud (2nd) owner of a 1985 Vanagon GL. I have owned my bus since
1988 and dearly love it (it is the first VW I have owned).

Now a question...  My Vanagon is a &quot;GL&quot; and I know this must signify
something as my insurance company charges me higher rates for the
privlidge of having those two letters on the back of my bus, but I
don't have any idea what they signify.  Could someone enlighten me?

TIA,
Doug Skinner from Bowling Green, Kentucky
85 Vanagon GL
