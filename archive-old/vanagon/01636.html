&gt;But where do you get the hardware to regear the speedometer?

GOTCHA! no, seriously, if you really really wanted to do that, there is
supposedly a place in the Long Beach, CA, area ... Universal Speedometer
or some name like that ... that does this sort of thing to VDO speedos.
they advertise in the EXCELLANCE magazine, i think. i tracked them down
once trying to find a kilometer-speedo for my bus (well, i thought it would
be neat to have a gauge that went up to 160kph! :)

but otherwise, you are likely just stuck. even the vw-supplied alloy wheels
that came on the Carat and GL models of the vanagons (more likely because
of the 205/70 tires) would upset your speedo/odometers and read a bit low.
the 91 GL i had (sob!) would show 65mph, but if you clocked it with a stop-
watch (and observing other traffic), you were doing about 69 mph.

that was different from my 88 bus with 185/70 tires and 14&quot; rims ... it
reads a bit high: indicated 65 mph is a stop-watch (and driving computer)
speed of about 62mph. and bentley says this 'normal': that the feds require
all speedos to read low (i.e., if they are gonna err, err on the conservative
side ... so you don't get speeding tickets?).

so? if you put bigger wheels and/or tires, i guess you either track somebody
down for the speedo fix, or just learn to live with it. or put in a driving
computer and trust it instead. :)
