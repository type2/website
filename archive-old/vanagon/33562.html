Subject: Re: m.fische reader FS

I'm finding this quite true.  The VW fiche is roughly 7&quot; x 9 1/2&quot; and 
won't fit any readers available at our local libraries (including the 
universities).  I'm about to go blind using my son's Radio Shack 
hand-held illuminated scope (30X).  The fiche reader that used to go with 
these fiche went to the new Mazda dealer (who sent it to an affiliated 
boat dealer).  I'm trying to talk them out of it.  The official VW fiche 
readers sell new for between $130 and $650.  I did pick up an official 
Volvo fiche reader out of the trash from the recent 
VW/Audi/Porsche/Volvo/Mitsubishi dealer's going-out-of-business auction.  
Looks like it only needs a light source, but it can't handle the big 
fiche. :(

&gt; Caution!  Check the size of the fische that this reader will handle. I have
&gt; heard that the size used by VW fische is different from whatever is &quot;standard&quot;
&gt; Here.
&gt; 
&gt; Suggestion:  Many libraries  have fische reader/printers for patrons to use
&gt; with library fische, there is no reason you can't bring your own fische - I
&gt; have done this with a repair manual for an oscilloscope and used the public
&gt; library's reader/printer to make a hard copy at  $0.10 per page or so.

&gt; I happend into a store today which has a used Bell and Howell micro-fische
&gt; reader for sale, and thought I'd mention it on the list, in case anyone
&gt; is interested.
