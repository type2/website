&gt;Hi, John--
&gt;I can be reached at: rmart_at_unm_dot_edu

Thanks.  I tried to finger unm_dot_edu last night but was unsuccessful.  Dunno.

&gt;I'll be away from all modems from March 7-13--on the road! An assistant driver
&gt;and I are delivering a '65 hardtop Deluxe to Ohio, and driving back two 
&gt;Syncros from Kentucky. Old Bus Review will be in the mail March 20.

Comin' any where near MN?  If so let me know and you have a place to stay.
We are in the very southern part of the state.

Hey I am looking for a double-door panel for a delivery van for my store.
Know of any in decent shape?
