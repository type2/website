&gt;Hi y'all...
&gt;
&gt;You might remember me as the &quot;newcomer with a lot of questions, but no 
&gt;bus...&quot; Well, we did it. It's a '71 Westy, with some surface rust, but a good 
&gt;drivetrain. 1600 engine, single Weber carb, nice original interior... we'll 
&gt;see how well she serves us. Paid $800, which seemed reasonable...
&gt;
&gt;So whaddya think - should I try to get the cables to the heater boxes 
&gt;unstuck, or should I just replace them? Yup - they're rusted stuck, and it's 
&gt;mighty cold here in New York right now (and it's even colder in Minnesota, 
&gt;where we're going for Christmas - whether or not we drive the bus depends on 
&gt;whether or not I get some heat going). What's the number one heat strategy? 
&gt;Gas or propane heater? Electric? Original with a blower?
&gt;

Hmmm, the high temp in MPLS today is supposed to be 3...  I would probably
invest in some new heater box cables, they're pretty cheap.  As far as
keeping warm goes: invest in some thermal underwear, buy a 12V coffee maker,
and browse the Vanagon gopher site
(gopher://halfdan.med.umn_dot_edu:70/11/Miscellaneous/Vanagon) for heat-related
topics.  You're probably gonna be better off if you insulate the bus to keep
the cold out rather than worry about how much heat it'll produce.  There has
been a lot of heat-related messages lately so you should be able to find
lots of info.
