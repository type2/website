Subject: Re: Alternator &amp; EGR lights flashing?

Kyle:
If you own a volt meter hook it up . Try to catch the voltage when the
lights start flashing. That way you &quot;might be able to&quot;  eliminate the
charging system , or not. You might not catch a momentary drop out
though.  A &quot;shaky&quot;  brush in the alternator could cause this.  I had a
similar problem. I found a new regulator with brushes for $12 at a
alternator repair shop. I never saw the symptom again. 
 Also, check the ground clusters behind the fuse box for corrosion.
Good Luck

&gt;Here's question that's beyond me.  Ever since I got my 1980 VW camper 
&gt;(last August), the alternator &amp; EGR lights would flash together and at 
&gt;
&gt;the same rate.
