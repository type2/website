&gt;&gt; I'm also contemplating an extendable pole for use on the _side_ of the
&gt;&gt; bus to reduce the effect of those pesky crosswinds.

&gt;Yeah... Instead of gettin' blown in and out of all three lanes,
&gt;Take them up to begin with.    :)

Maybe this is the merit in lowering a bus...  Makes sense, because the
biggest problem is getting air under the vehicle...

I saw one last weekend that was _so_ low (How low was it?) he only had 3/4&quot; 
inch between the muffler and the ground.

He told me he had taken his suspension components and &quot;flipped&quot;
them left to right.  For instance, his reduction boxes were upside down.
The only tires he could run on it were those useless &quot;temp&quot; tires you
find in the trunks of modern cars.  He sez, and I quote, &quot;Its not so bad.
You only hit the mufflers and the steering box.&quot;  The STEERING BOX?  C'mon!

What was eespecially sar, was this is  21-window.  Sniff.  This bus
was so low, I could look DOWN into the sunroof.  I'm only 6'2&quot; tall!
