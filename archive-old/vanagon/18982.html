&gt; I was passing thru a small town in Vermont last night in my '66 bus
&gt; and the people went NUTS!  Waving, flagging me down asking me to join them
&gt; at their campsites, honking, etc.  I appear to have stumbled upon
&gt; a G.Dead concert location.  

The Dead play the Franklin Co. Airport (really!) in Highgate VT this 
coming  Thursday 6/15/95.

&gt; I understand their is a mail list for Deadheads 'cause I do want to catch
&gt; a (or a series of) concert at some point (hopefully soon) and I'd like to
&gt; find out when and where they are at any given time.
&gt; If anyone has any info about the mail list please drop me a line.

Check out the newsgroup rec.music.gdead
There is also a mailing list - I don't know the address, but if you read 
the newsgroup for a while you will see it.
