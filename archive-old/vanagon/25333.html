Subject: Way Beleated Introduction and new address

Hi there,
	I'm not sure if anyone remembers me but I've been away for a 
little while because my internet access was rudely interupted by a school 
which decided that I could no longer log on because I wasn't a registered 
student any more (why not?).  Anyway, I have access through work now and 
I'm a happy guy.
	So, last time I was on, everyone was introducing themselves in 
depth and now I've decided to give it a shot.  Okay, I'm 26 years old and 
I live on Long Island near SUNY Stony Brook (where I am a pseudo-graduate 
student on a long break).  Unfortunately, Long Island is on the way to no 
where except Europe.  Otherwise, I would welcome anyone to stop by and 
visit me anytime (good excuse, huh?).  I work at a local public library 
(Emma S. Clark Memorial Library) where I am in charge of the video and 
cd-rom department (actually, I am the whole dept.).  I play guitar and 
sing in a band called Mad Planets which has a small but devoted 
following.  We have done mini-tours in New England and Upstate NY as well 
as many shows in NYC.  Once I get one of my busses going we plan to go 
out to Portland, OR and get some shows along the way.
	That brings me to my busses.  Actually, right now I'm driving a 
yellow '73 Squareback because it's the only thing that works.  I also 
have a '73 bus with an automatic transmission and an engine which died 
several months ago.  Someone sold me a '71 camper with a mint interior 
right after I got the bus so I have a camper-bus type thingy actually.  
Okay, so after taking apart my engine I find that the cost of replacement 
parts is prohibitive.  I decide (with the help of my VW guru) to use the 
engine from the '71.  But now I need some conversion stuff, like a drive 
plate for a Type III automatic or an Autostick beetle (anyone got one?).  
I'm also not sure what kind of motor mount I need.  Anyone got any advice 
on this switch?  Please help me.
	Just yesterday, the '71 camper was taken away and presumably 
crushed :(, but don't be sad because I recently bought another bus (I 
guess you can say I've caught the disease).  Following the advice of the 
people on this list I purchased a '66 Westy from a local junkyard/repair 
shop for $400.  Most people said that I'd be crazy NOT to buy it.  Then 
after I bought it, I though for a while and realized that I took advice 
from a bunch of VW nuts!  Of course they'd tell me to buy it!  What was I 
thinking?  Anyway, it's mine now but it's not at my house yet because I 
have to find someone to help me tow it home.  I must say, it feels really 
good to finally have a split-window bus.  I will definitely be asking for 
lots of help and parts.
	Well, thanks for your time, and note my new address if you've 
written to me before.

-Erik.
