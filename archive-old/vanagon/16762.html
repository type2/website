Subject: Price for a 78 Camper? 

I may be selling a 78 camper bus and need some help setting the price.  The car
is in very good shape and has 143,000 miles (motor rebuilt at 82,000).  There
is some slight rust forming around the back end and in the battery wells. All
the camping gear works fine.  Any input into the value of this vehicle would be
most appreciated.
