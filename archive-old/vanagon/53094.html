Subject: Cheap price on KYB shocks &amp; 2.1L water pumps

The wholesale distributor I get my Bentleys from is running a closeout on a 
couple of items that may interest the list.  They've only got a few of 
each, so if you're interested let me know soon. In fact, I'm planning on 
claiming one set of the shocks for myself. These prices represent about a 
$3.00-$5.00 markup above my cost to cover my time and materials ordering 
and then reboxing and shipping them.  (Shipping is extra.) 

KYB shocks for Vanagon:  Rear (Gas-Adjust) and Front (GR2) $27.50 each
Water pump for 86-91 Vanagon &amp; Syncro (German)  $38.50

They also have KYB shocks for other models on sale, plus some bus &amp; bug 
stuff (heater boxes, bug cylinder heads, etc.) and watercooled car stuff, 
if anyone's interested.
