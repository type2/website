Subject: 1983.5 Westy for sale in NJ


Hi Everyone,

I must regretfully announce that my 1983.5 Westy is for sale. My new job
requires me to commute 70 miles a day and I really have to get a small
commuter car. Here is the scoop:

88K miles
head gaskets were replaced 5k ago (one head was replaced with a
reconditioned one)
items replaced-
water pump
brake master cylinder
rear wheel cylinders and brake shoes
clutch master and slave cylinders
passed NJ inspection
gets 20 mpg
ALL of the camping equipment works perfectly


all it really needs is some cosmetic work
if anyone is interested please contact me directly.

Dave
