Subject: VDO Oil pressure and temp gauges-

&gt;The oil pressure sender I
&gt;bought is the one with warning light provision.  I assumed that this unit
&gt;would replace the stock oil pressure sender, but I am having trouble
&gt;installing this sender.  I don't see how it is going to fit through the tin
&gt;on my '81. Has anyone else installed one of these units?  What did you do? Do
&gt;I need a short 1/8th in NPT nipple? What size worked for you? 

I just finished installing both sending units on my 2.0. I was lucky 
 enough to do this while the engine is on a stand which made it much 
 easier, I opened the hole in the cooling tin up with a dremel tool and 
 a little grinding wheel, although I think that you good use a round 
 file or something similar. It now has about 1 mm of clearance around 
 the sensor that I think I will seal with silicon.  The temp sensor 
 went into the sump plate also, it is a pretty tight fit and if you 
 stray too far from the instructions you will have to drill a new one.

Where are you placing the gauges? I used a mount under the dash on my 
 old bus but it was out of the line of sight and I would like to have 
 something a little higher.
