Subject: Re: Aircooleds and Airplanes

&gt;and in the southwest, years ago, weren't there some sort of Evaporative
&gt;Coolers for houses?? that used something like that to cool the house (instead
&gt;of a compressor system a/c)??

        I've got an old Evap. Cooler from the '50s. It's an automotive
unit, from Sears/Roebuck, mounts on the doorframe, on/above the door, with
a vent that goes in the window. I'm not sure just how well it works, I only
used it for a few hours 'cause it seemed like I got better cooling with all
the windows down, and it killed my gas milage. I may try it again this
summer, though. When I tried it was late at night going across Cal. on I's
15 &amp; 40, only around 75 outside. Might be different at 90+ degrees. It's
kind of a neat thing to keep around, gives it a real classic look-if I ever
get my splitie it'll look pretty cool.

Peace,
