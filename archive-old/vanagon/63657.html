&gt;... for the
&gt;record we put 35k miles on our '91 GL in ten days, the return rout was via
&gt;US70 over Loveland pass, never lugging below 50mph, ...

Ron,

This is indeed impressive for an automatic Vanagon.    (Even impressive for
a manual.)   I calculate an average (24 hr/day) speed of 145 mi/hr, so I
can understand why you weren't able to lug below 50 mph...
