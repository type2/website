Subject: VWoA rep remarks about Eurovan at US-Milw Auto Show

I was at the Milwaukee auto show on Friday and asked the VWoA
representative if we will be seeing a 97 Eurovan any time soon.  His reply
was that VWoA is still undecided about bringing this van into the US
anytime soon.  He said there is talk about bringing in a very limited
number of 97's into the US in fall of 96.  He said the color choices would
be very limited and the only model available will probably be an MV, with
VR6, and automatic.  Personally the feeling I got from this guy was that he
really didn't want to talk about the Eurovan and he really left me with the
feeling that it was VERY UNLIKELY that we will see this van again anytime
soon.

Regrettably Submitted (since I like Eurovans)
