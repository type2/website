Subject:       83 &amp; 86 Vanagons for Sale

Dear folks,

I have two GL Waterboxers for sale:  1983 and 1986.  Will consider 
all reasonable offers.


                                 ***** 1983 ************

The van has 114K miles.  Has 4 sp manual trans.  No AC. Has Stereo 
Prep Package.  Standard 7 pass seating.  The engine is very sound and 
has NO water leaks.  Has a very small oil leak at one of the lifter 
tubes.  With leak and normal operation, looses only 1 qt. every 3,000 
mi.

The van has a new paint job in original colors - brown and tan.  We 
completely stripped, sanded, resealed seams, primed and repainted the 
van.  Every part possible was removed to give as clolse to factory 
type painting as possible.  We also added brown pinstriping along 
tan/brown paint lines.  Also we added the Syncro wheel lip guards to 
the van to protect the paint job.

The interior is original and is immaculate. Have original VW 
floormats in front and center. 

The van has new disc brakes, muffler, and new VW waterpump.  The 
clutch, pressure plate, throwout bearing and seals (all new VW parts) 
were replaced about 20K ago.  I have every maintenance and repair 
work order ticket available to verify maintenance record and repairs.

          ********************  1986  ******************************

The 1986 has a 4 speed trans, PS/PB, air conditioning,
AM/FM Cassette stereo, weekender package, remote heated mirrors,
map/vanity lights, rear window wiper. This van has 91K on it.

The van is immaculate  - the interior is original without any tears or 
stains.  The van has a full set of VW floor mats.  The exterior of the van
is in excellent condition.  The van has 4 new goodyear intrepids with 
road hazard guarantee.

The van has new front rotors, all new brake pads, new rear heater core, 
and 75% overhaul of the engine.  The heads were cracked and leaking 
so both head and value assemblies were replaced.  The mechanic has 
30 years of VW experience and checked out the rest of the engine - says
the engine, transmission, and clutch are in excellent shape.  Before 
the overhaul the engine used 1 qt of oil every 3,000 mi.  I changed 
the oil every 3,000 miles.  The van has new VW coolant in it.

VW retrofitted the ac ducts as well as replaced the rear AC housing.  
The van has a new muffler, catalyic converter, tail pipe and new 
gaskets and bolts on the exhaust system.


You have my e-mail address.  Both vans are in Starkville, Miss.  My 
work number is 601-325-1908; home is 601-324-1739.

Butch
