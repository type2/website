Subject: VW Shops in Santa Carla, CA and Exton, PA ???

A friend is visiting the US on a business trip from Australia. He is looking
to pickup some VW parts while here in the States.

Any recommendations for VW shops in the 2 cities mentioned above. That may
be Santa Clara (I'm guessing, don't remember a Santa Carla).
