&gt; My suspicion is that the water pump has either stopped pumping, or
&gt; the thermostat is stuck.

I doubt that the water pump could stop pumping unless the impeller
is breaking apart, and you'd probably hear that. I could buy the
over-heating due to a stuck t-stat though. Another possibility is
that your heads are leaking combustion pressure into the cooling
system. I hope that it's something simpler than that though.
