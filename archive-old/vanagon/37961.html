&gt;I just want you to know that if I had a Vanagon and a Citation and IF
&gt;IT WERE POSSIBLE I would fuse them together into one fabulous
&gt;creation of iron and plastic, and I'd call it &quot;Vanatation&quot;  And it

Somebody told me once that there is an adapter available for the Mazda
rotary. Ever heard of that?

(I know it's heresy, but don't anybody start with me. It's my wife who has
questions about it. Questions such as:

--Why is this thing so loud?

--Why is this shifting thing so mushy?

--Why aren't you out there working on my Honda?

--Could you put air conditioning in this?

--What's wrong with it THIS time?)
