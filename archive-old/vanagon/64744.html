&lt;&lt; What really bugs me about these silly door vents... is why VW went to
 the expense of putting them in?  What purpose do they serve?  In summer
 with the AC I keep them closed.  In the winter the heat blow just fine
 into the cavernous Vanagon.  It's not like it is air tight with nowhere
 to go...
 Just another example of engineers on drugs?

well, they've been on drugs since '68 then...  :&lt;) (that's when \X/ intro'd
them on the buses..  :&lt;)

drugs in '68...hmmm HIGH-ly likely...  :&lt;)
