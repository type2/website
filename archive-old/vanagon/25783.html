Subject: Fridge temps

I've gotten to the point of trying to make my Westy fridge more usable. 
But, I'm not sure whether mine is actually working properly. (I know they 
are notoriously lousy, but how lousy?)

It would help me if everyone with a stock Westy could post their fridge 
temps.

Specifically, what temp would the fridge interior be on a 90 degree day?

How cold can you get the fridge interior (at maximum cold)? At what 
outide temp?

Thanks a bunch!

Dave Garth
