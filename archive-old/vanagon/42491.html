&gt;After putting it off for a couple of months I decided to eliminate the
&gt;annoying squeak I was getting every time I pushed down the clutch pedal.
&gt;So, as normal, I first checked with the Bentley manual to become familar
&gt;with the mechanism and found that the repair would be a piece of cake.  Uuh,
&gt;maybe not.  What Bentley doesn't explain is how to get at the mechanism.  It
&gt;would appear that the instrument panel would have to be remove, which I have
&gt;done, however that then presents the problem of having to remove the brake
&gt;fluid reservoir.  Is this in fact the next step, and if so can I assume that
&gt;the brake lines will have to be bled when the reservoir is bolted back in.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks to any anyone who can help.

What year bus?  I'm pretty sure I don't need to remove the instrument panel
on my '71 to get to MY clutch pedal.  :-)
