Subject: EV Westy spotted?

Volks,
	I saw a strange EV on the freeway last night.  It had a pop top, but
something was different about it.  After a couple minutes of staring I
noticed that it was a panel van, not the regular windowed EV half-assed
Westy.  This EV had a two-paned louvered (?) window on the drivers side and
no other windows behind the cab.  Could this be a full blown Eurovan
Westfalia?  I thought they weren't selling those over here in the US...
