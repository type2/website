Subject: Re: 88 Vanagon - Blown tranny

The big questions:
&gt;1. Does anybody know if a windshield from an '82 or '83 will interchange 
with an
&gt;'88? I know of two different donor Vanagons being parted out close to home.
&gt;
No major change in windshields I know of, go for the one with the best tinting.

&gt;2. Is there any recurring problem with the Vanagon trannies? Mine will not go

Linkage gets sloppy, lots of plastic bits. Drop the rear linkage mount, and 
pull the socket joint apart. You should have a ball on a stick to move 
about, try shifting with that to see what it feels like before you teardown. 
May just be the linkage.  Is the '83 a wasserboxer?, get the tranny from it.
