&gt;When my reflectors and lenses got &quot;shot&quot; - coated with crud (inside)  - a
&gt;few years back, I actually cleaned the reflector and inside of the lens
&gt;with a piece of cloth wrapped around a piece of stiff wire.   It's a bit
&gt;tricky to get the wire and cloth in through the bulb hole and around the
&gt;metal shield, and you have to bend it funny ways to get the reflector,  but
&gt;it is possible (and also slow going).   It was dramatically cheaper than
&gt;the alternative.    Taking the lens/mirror off the car is MUCH easier,
&gt;since youwill spend a lot of time with it in your lap, trying to get the
&gt;wire bent into funny positions.    I didn't notice any scratching of the
&gt;reflector, but even if it is scratched, it's much better than being dirty.
&gt; I forget whether I did it dry, or with a little alcohol.   Try it dry first.

Just put 'em in the dishwasher, full hot cycle, bulb hole side down.  Works
great with &quot;Cascade liqui-gel&quot;.  As soon as the cycle completely stops, open
the dishwasher door asap so the hot headlights dry quickly.  You'll find
your light output seems almost doubled on a 10 year old vehicle!!!  ( &amp; *I*
sure won't use wire or brushes of any sort inside mine-the reflective
coating is rather fragile, believe me I know, but the VW wasn't the victim
of my learning curve, TG).
