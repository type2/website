Subject: leaking heads

We have a '91 Synchro Vanagon with 124,000 miles on it. This summer we
noticed that our coolant was lowering, and found out that we had a leak
in the head. We understand that this is a common problem, and $2000 
later, had our van back good as new. :-( I heard that this might be an
   problem that has come up as a recall. Checked with my local VW  
dealer in Eugene, Oregon, and they were not aware of any recalls. Is 
there any other place I could check to make sure that this is not the 
case?
 Thanks,
Janet McLain
