Subject:       '71 T2 VIN

There is something curious about the VIN on my newly acquired bus.  The vin on 
the bus matched the one on the title, but don't cross reference with a couple 
of sources, namely Muirs book, and the Bus Stop (RMMW).  My vin starts out 
2212XXXXXX.  There is a date of manufacture sticker on the door jamb which says 
6/71.  Well, the vin is well past the last numbers on the reference list.  
What's also interesting is the vin location example in the Bus Stop catalog.  
The VIN there starts out the same 2212 blah blah.   I'm not really gonna die 
over this one, I just wonder if it may be a reason for the engine tin of a t1 
not fitting perfectly, which will be in a later post.
Thanks,
Mike
