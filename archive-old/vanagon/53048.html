  I just dealt with this on my 84 GL, I had the Sliding door from a 87 and I
Thought I was going to Rob the Nylon sliding guide from the 87 door, I went
to the door to take off the piece which was bad on my 84 door, and to my
Surprise the Nylon piece was a Bearing Roller!  A much better design.

  I was checking through all of the other Sliding doors I have, All the way
back to the 68 bus door I have is the same Nylon piece!  There are 3
different Nylon sliders too.  The Vanagon has it's OWN Nylon piece too, not
the same as the bus doors either.

  Just thought I'd share my experience from this last weekend.
