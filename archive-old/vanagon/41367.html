Hey everybody, I've been off for the semester because mailing lists are 
too distracting.  Thought I'd pop in for a while until I head out for the 
summer.

Question 1:
I think I found the answer to the problem that no VW mechanic has been 
able to fix.  My 85 GL frequently stalls, epecially when I'm coasting to 
a stop or through a corner, and, the idle is erradic.  When the idle 
speed drops is when it usually stalls.  Since it is rhythmically erratic, 
I am guessing it is simply the timing that is off.  Sound reasonable?

Question 2:
Where is the best place to mount an auxilary battery and its trickle 
charger (respectively).  This regards a Westy installation in the above 
85GL.  I'm worried about hydrogen build-up which could become dangerous 
near the charger, the fridge, and the stove.
Since the main battery is already under the one seat, the other could 
easily go under the driver's, and the charger in the compartment under 
the rear bench...?

Question 3:
My locks took a beating this winter.  All but the one in the rear hatch 
froze up (which made it a bit awkward getting in).  I took off the 
handles, poured machine oil over them, and was able to free two of the 
cylinders.  They worked smoothly for about three days, but are starting 
to seize again.  Any suggestions here?
