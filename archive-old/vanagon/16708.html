&gt; Pete: I was there! And so was another listmember, Peter Krogh! He had the Westy

&gt; When I got there at 6:15pm, I was worried when I small the meager group in the
&gt; bar. I asked the bartender if he knew if there were any VW nuts there, and he
&gt; looked at me like I was crazy! Luckily, Peter heard me, introduced himself,and
&gt; we hung out for a hour and half or so.We were hoping for others, but nobody else
&gt; came in. Did you sneak in the back way?  We had a good time ,wish we connected
&gt; with you. (Next time, lets all wear a VW hat or something!)

Sorry we weren't involved.  I'm often so backlogged that I dsometimes 
read mail about events that I just missed - such as this.  Ooops...


&gt; Now, for the second part. I am going to Bug-Out in Manassas, Virginia on May
&gt; 29th. For those that have never been, it costs $10.00 to get in. The parking lot
&gt; is about a 1/2 mile walk to the entrance. I plan on entering my Notchback in the
&gt; show. Not that the Notch is show-quality (after all, Al called it &quot;decrepit&quot;),
&gt; but it's cheap parking! It only costs $15.00 to enter the show, which includes
&gt; one admission. Now, I consider $5.00 to park in the middle of the action well
&gt; worth it. I usually bring a Hibachi, a beach umbrella and a cooler of food &amp;
&gt; drink. I think I might of convinced Peter to enter his Westy in the show, too.
&gt; Does anybody want to hook up down there? Hey, food is expensive there--lets cook
&gt; out together! Since Pete got kinda burned on the last one, I will be willing to
&gt; take care of logistics on this one.
&gt; 
&gt; We have 3 weeks to get it together guys. If we dont, I bet the West Cost people
&gt; are going to FLAME us real bad...    :)

Well I'm going to go with my family.  We live a good 4 or 5 miles east of 
the Speedway on the western edge of Dale City.  We'll be packed into the 
EuroVan to get there - our Thing is not quite ready for events beyond the 
driveway.  

Safeest thing to be sure to get email to me several days in advance - I 
believe Pete has our phone number as well - as does the Prince Willy 
phone book :)
