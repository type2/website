Subject: Re: Brake Pad/Shoe Thickness '84 Westy

On my 85, rear drums, I remove the oval rubber plugs on the back mounting
plate and can measure the wear.  On the fronts I remove the wheel only &amp; look
down.

BTW why are the front brake pads the easiest brakes in the world to replace
and the rear ones the hardest?
