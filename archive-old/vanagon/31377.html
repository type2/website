Subject: Re: Re[2]: Heater Box

&gt;     
&gt;     
&gt;     I am slowly transplanting my engine for a newer one, and I was 
&gt;     wondering if it would be good to paint the heater boxes so they don't 
&gt;     rust out.  Mine are in pretty good shape now and I'd like to keep them 
&gt;     that way.
&gt;     
&gt;     Would painting with POR-15 be a good idea ?
&gt;

You can have them sandblasted or beadblasted (not as harsh on the
sheetmetal) then paint them with high temp paint.  I had this done on mine
and the only noticeable paint burnoff/rust after 10 months/14,000 miles on
salty roads is right at the exhaust flange where the heat exchanger pipe
bolts to the head--don't think this can be prevented.  I used gray high temp
engine paint and put on a few coats with plenty of drying time.  I think I
used the type with toluene or some such nasty chemical, so I was very
careful to mask off the inside of the hot air tube/control valve area before
painting.  

Also, if you're having them blasted you may as well bring them to a welder
and have the loose sheetmetal and holes if any welded so you don't have any
leaks.

Now's also the time to replace those original, hideous, flaking asbestos
gaskets (if you have them) that are between the heat exchanger and the black
plastic accordian tube that connects to the y pipe.  The newer &quot;rubber
gasket&quot; can still be had from VW for $7 each or so (WOW!), but you might
find a better deal through an aftermarket source.

Good luck.  Happy heating.
