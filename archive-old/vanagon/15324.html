&gt; Hey Matt,
&gt; 
&gt; I had the same problem last weekend while driving head on into a wind storm.
&gt; The mirrors basically folded against the body of the Vanagon. Other cars
&gt; zipped by us with their mirrors doing just fine. Let me know what you find
&gt; out if anything as I have no solution. Sorry.
&gt; 

In my '85 I can just undo the two screws holding it to the door, and
*slightly* tighten the nut on the bottom, I've never broken anything
doing this, maybe you should try to get your hands on some later mirrors
(if they'll fit).


Cheers
