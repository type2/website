Subject:       Re: 23 Window AUS price


&gt; The first 23 window deluxe sunroof that I have seen for sale in the last 18
&gt; months in AUS (Melbourne anyway) was auctioned at Hamiltons (exotic/vintage
&gt; auction house) last week.  It was in *very* ordinary/poor condition......
&gt; 
&gt; And the price it sold for?
&gt; 
&gt; $12000 AUS or around $8800 US.....
&gt; 
&gt; Makes you weep doesn't it?

That is amazing.  Someone else just posted an ad for a 21 for $6.6k!  
I guess I should be happy that I only paid $3.5k for my '57.  Wow!
