&gt;         different from your 86.  Is this the same condition for others on 
&gt;         the list?  Inquiring minds want to know.

I'll check mine over the weekend to see how it acts.

&gt;         Concerning your gauge, 3/4 bothers me as ours has never been 
&gt;         higher than 1/2 or a little bit above it even when traveling 
&gt;         through the Smokey Mtns.  There is always the possibility that 
&gt;         our gauge is defective and yours is accurate. More input from 
&gt;         others on the list may be needed.  Temps have been high 90's to 
&gt;         low 100's this week (I checked coolant level and strength) but 
&gt;         the needle on the temp gauge has climbed very little.  Generally, 
&gt;         our gauge reads right at or a little above the 1/2 way mark.

Similar range to normal four mine.

&gt;         We have had only one problem with the A/C.  The rear unit quit 
&gt;         cooling just as warm weather season started.  My local dealer 
&gt;         replaced some sort of valve under warranty; he said it was a 
&gt;         common problem and that VWofA had some sort of fix for it.  We 
&gt;         did not buy the vehicle from this dealer but he has always 
&gt;         cheerfully (and competently) fixed whatever warranty problems 
&gt;         have cropped up.  We have also enjoyed your spirited defense of 
&gt;         E-Vans.  My 72 Westy has an attraction all its own but dollar for 
&gt;         dollar, pound for pound, our E-Van has been one of the best 
&gt;         vehicles we have ever owned.

Any more oinformation on this rear A/C problem?  We've not had A/C 
problems except when trying to run the A/C at idle at first startup to cool 
the big box before inserting baby into his car seat.  I have to lightly 
press the accelerator to keep it running.  It is time for scheduled 
maintenance though.

&gt;         72 Westy (My Daily Driver)

The family van when I was a kid....

&gt;         72 Super Beetle (#1 Son's Daily Driver)

Never had a Super Beetle in the family.  Though my dad had a 195? - which 
was the first year of the oval?

&gt;         73 Thing (#2 Son's Daily Driver)

We got two of these.  Soon to be (hopefully) my daily driver.

&gt;         93 E-Van (Wife's Daily Driver)

Got a '93 EV MV.

Must say you have great taste in automobiles....
