Subject: 1.9 to 2.1 Engine Swap

I've been told conflicting stories about installing a post '86 vanagon engine
in a '85 vanagon.  One person said &quot;No problem, just use your '85 electronics
and fuel injection on the '86 to '92 long block.  Another person said that
the 2.1 engine won't mate to the '85 tranny.  Any info you could give me
would be appreciated.  Please e-mail it to me directly.

Also, I just missed out on getting a '90 motor. so I'm looking for a 2.1 in
good shape.  Something with low milage. Maybe from a wreck.  A plug-N-play
motor if you will.
