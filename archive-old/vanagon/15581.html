Subject: RE: wOW, and head torques

Eugene Palmer asks about cylinder head torque figures with 8mm studs.

Tom Wilson's &quot;How to Rebuild Your Volkswagen Air-Cooled Engine&quot; is
emphatic about final-torquing to 18 ft-lb.  &quot;Over torquing these engines
will only result in stretched studs.&quot;
 
Wilson has a detailed set of instructions and diagrams for the pattern
and sequence of torquing steps, although the numbers are for 10mm stud or
case-saver engines, and it's not quite clear where you are supposed to stop with the
8mm stud engines.

Let me know if you don't have access to that book, and I'll try to give
more detail on the steps.
