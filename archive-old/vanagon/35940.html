Subject: Re: Trouble with Type II rod bearings...

Ken,

I'm sorry if my flippant 'butter knife' analogy is causing confusion.  If
your rods feel loose it could be due to the temperature of your shop or some
other minor factor.  I doubt if the crank has been reground in error, and it
sounds as if your have the proper bearings. 

&gt;Stock crank (per Haynes) was 2.164

eh... close, but not very precise.  Your con rod journals should have been
55mm.  The spec is 54.98 to 55.00.  2.164&quot; is a few tenths (ten-thousandths)
under 54.98mm.

A 'twenty thou' regrind should actually be a half a millimeter regrind, since
1mm is not .040&quot; but more like .03942&quot;.  If the machinest knew his stuff, he
shot for a finished dimension of 2.1466&quot; to 2.1458&quot; and it sounds like he did
pretty well in your case.

To make things fit you now need bearing shells that are half a millimeter
thicker, meaning they should be marked &quot;+0.50mm&quot;

Fit the shells into a rod.  Assemble it to the crank, making sure the offset
mark is in the proper postion for that particular crank throw, and the
matching numbers on the rod line up.  The shell should be lubricated with a
wipe of CV joint grease or assembly lube.

With the crank horizontal, hold the rod parallel to the floor and let it
drop.  It should swing down slowly.  

Okay, we got that far and the sucker swung down like a rocket.  Now we need
to know why.

First, there may not be a problem.  If you are in a warm shop, if the journal
is perfectly round and well polished, and if the rod and bearing shell are a
good fit, you have a circle within a circle with a thin layer of grease
between them and the thing swings down quick like a bunny.  No problem, just
perfectly fitting parts and warm lubricant.

Are they all like that?  

Can you detect ANY appreciable in/out motion when you push/pull on the little
end of the con rod?

If you can't detect any play -- any gross evidence of excessive clearance --
then the rod, crank and bearing apparently do fit.  But they are loose.  The
question is, are they too loose. 

Since you do not have precision measuring instruments, use the Plastigage.
 You need to know if the clearance exceeds spec, which should be about
.0015&quot;.  If the radial play is more than .0025&quot;, then you need to replace the
connecting rod.

What you've encountered here is a common occurance and need not be cause for
alarm.  If your rods are worn -- pounded out, in this case -- they can be
rebuilt.

The drop test is a valid procedure for determining if a rod is properly
fitted to the crank.  The spec for rod journals is a fairly tight fit, from
less than a thou to about two and half thou.  A rod that drops slowly has
about a thou of clearance, which is a good figure for a street engine.
