OK Joel, you caught me!  I guess I was imbellishing (sp?) a little.  The 79 bus
went to a friend when I bought the 88 Westy a little over a year and a half ago.
 I did a bunch of troubleshooting on that one's FI system too (air flow meter,
hall sender,etc).   I live by the ocean and only have enough garage space for
one van :-(.  I woulda kept the 79 but I couldn't stand to watch it sit outside
and rust.  Selling it was like putting it out of it's (rusty) misery.

The 90 Westy is my parents new baby.  I helped them buy it in August.  I loaned
them mine while I was away for 3 months and they lasted about 2 weeks after they
returned it.  I'll most likely be the one who troubleshoots theirs when
necessary.

You don't just have ONE bus/van in your family do you???
