&gt;A friend will give me his, but I dont know if they will work in the rear.
&gt;They are nice quality, but I dont want them if I can only
&gt;use them on two wheels. (Limited storage)

it depends on the ramps. i have a set that i used to use on a 71 and 73 bus.
and yes, with careful positioning and a bit of fortitude, you CAN get the
bus up on the ramps. you can't get into the rear hatch (cargo), but other
than that ... :)  if the ramps are NOT braced (front-to-back), i might
suggest passing on them ... some of these K-mart types creak and groan too
much for me to feel comfortable working around them.

p.s. you have to have enough clearance on the ramps (i.e., they have to be
sloped LOW enough) to clear the tailpipe.
