Subject: Re: for robert brown: borla exhausts (stainless steel)

Are stainless steel mufflers worth the premium over a standard
muffler with a lifetime guarantee?

I bought a Walker muffler for about $90US five years ago at my
local muffler and brake shop.  About two years ago I backed into
a curb and broke off the tailpipe.  They replaced the muffler
with a new one for about $20US labor.  For me, I suspect the
stainless steel exhaust is more expensive over the long run.

The other three pieces of the exhaust (excluding the catalytic
converter) might be a different story.  For these pieces, the
labor involved (including risk of broken studs) is greater than
the labor for the muffler.  There is no lifetime guarantee that I
could find.  So the extra cost of stainless steel might be
worthwhile.

Shelby
