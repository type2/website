Subject: RE: 911 motor in a VW transporter

Chris Gilbert inquires about price of conversion, which could be less than
$1000 not including the engine.  The engine itself is going to be in the
$2000 to $5000 range, higher if you &quot;need&quot; a Turbo or a late-80s engine.

Scary, but note that the engine will hold its value better than the van
does.  Unless you really blow it up, the engine is always going to have
a parts value of nearly $1000.

&gt;From my reading, this is the easiest conversion for an amateur with an
aircooled van.  Waterpumper owners might do better with a waterpumper
conversion.

Go for it.
B.
