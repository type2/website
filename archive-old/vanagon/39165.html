Subject: Re: Shore cooling


&gt;&gt;   I'm thinkin' about this long trip to Inuvik in the middle of the
&gt;&gt;hot summer, and I'm thinkin' about how nice it would be to have AC. Of
&gt;&gt;course, I don't want to run it off my poor little old DP1600, so I'm
&gt;&gt;thinking shore power. Maybe a window mount unit, or one of those RV units
&gt;&gt;that sit on top. The other idea is a small generator to power the dumb
&gt;&gt;thing. Maybe in that left hand corner of the engine compartment which is
&gt;&gt;empty at the moment.
&gt;
&gt;You will not need much AC that far north.  I did Alaska in July of 93.  75
&gt;was average temp up there. No humidity problems either.


I did Thule, Greenland for 2-1/2 years, about halfway between the Arctic
Circle and the North Pole. Average July temp was about 38F, mostly because
the sun never went down. Temps much above 40 were considered warm. Above
50 were dangerous, because the local icecap started melting and flooded
the base-- happened twice. Above 60 was a disaster-- permafrost was in
danger of melting. Highest temp ever recorded there was 68F -- not on
my watch, thankfully.

Thule was at 76 degrees north latitude, I think. What is Inuvik's?
