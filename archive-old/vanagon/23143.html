Subject: Towing '85 

Having the steering wheel locked does not really help unless the
steering is really tight.  The van still (Ph)ishtails....  I had my
'82 diesel towed once (less than 50 miles) and a '73 bug another time
(375 miles or so) with front wheels on the dolly and rear wheels
riding, with the gear in neutral.  I guess I was lucky -- no
discernible effects and I only used one lane of the highway too :-)

 &gt; I propose to tow an '85 camper 700 miles on a tow dolly (a two wheel cart 
 &gt; - looks like a chariot) behind my '85 Ford truck.
 &gt; 
 &gt; The camper is a 4-speed manual.
 &gt; 
 &gt; I plant to tow it with the rear wheels on the dolly.  That means the 
 &gt; odometer cable will be turning - or will it?  Does it turn backwards?
 &gt; 
 &gt; Also, need the wheels be locked or should they be free?  Thanks for any 
 &gt; experiences and suggestions.
