Subject: Re:  Speaking of jacks . . .

&gt;&gt;     Where should the jack be stashed on a '91 Westfalia?  (FWIW I won't be
&gt;&gt;    surprised to find that I don't have one.)

	There are two perfect places for the jack&amp;tool bag (you have a lonigish
	bag...about 1.5ft long and 3in in diameter...right?): under the rear 
	seat, or on the shelf behind the rear overhead cabinet or A/C 
	encolsure.
