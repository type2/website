&gt; Was doing the valves on the old '72 and now I have a distinct

&gt; Rolled into a gas station and a young fellow (another bus owner) said
&gt;  &quot;sounds like you need to do your valves, man&quot;
&gt; I had set the valves to .006 (as per St. Muir). This always worked
&gt;  on the Bugs....Is there something about the Bus that I do not know?
&gt; Are the valves too loose? Too tight? Should they be set at .004?

Nope.  Intake at .006 and exhaust at .008 is how I do it.  If they are
too loose you will hear more of a clattering noise than a putting.
Putting sounds like a valve that is too *tight*, and if so you want to
correct that immediately - like before you start it again.
