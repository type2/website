We purchased a thru the glass CB antenna (like cellular phone) available at
most CB shops. I have even seen them at Wal-Mart. The only problem is making
sure the lead in cable does not pass too close to the engine compartment as
it can pick up rf interference (we wrapped one section in foil to reduce the
ignition interference). Works great now.
  Also, are there any members of Westfalia Wanderers on the list? We have
been trying to contact this group without success. Thank You. Becky &amp; Jim
Brookover.
