Subject: Squeeeaky clutch pedal


Well, I don't think I can live with it much longer, and would dearly 
appreciate some advice. The clutch pedal on my '90 has been squeakin 
and creakin for months and miles now. I've done the contortionist 
act, laying on the floor on my back, peering up under the dash with 
flashlight and mirror, trying to see where to lube the dang thing, 
but the pivot-bushing-spring (or whatever is up there) is out of 
sight and out of reach. I pulled the plastic cover from the 
instrument cluster on top of the dash, and no luck from that angle, 
either. Bently is typically opaque on this one.

I called the local dealer's service shop, and the 'advisor' there 
told me he didn't think I would want to pay them what it would cost 
to deal with the problem. (I think I have them trained now, to 
expect me to question everything at least twice, and to be very 
reluctant to give them any more of my money than is absolutely 
necessary). His informed advice was that it will be necessary to 
remove the entire dash to lube the clutch pedal! This seems pretty 
bizzare to me. Anyone else had this problem? If so, how did you 
solve it?

Keeping the music turned up loud,

Steve Reilly
