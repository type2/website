 &gt; When I saw the above notation, I envisioned *four* gauges,
 &gt; one for each cylinder.  Is this overkill?  Is this
 &gt; obsession?  Is this insurance?  Is there a 4-cylinder gauge?


Not only is this NOT overkill, it is regularly done on horizontally oppposed 
aircooled aircraft engines.  I'm saving for one for my plane...

So, yes, you can just go out and buy one.  Go to your local BIG newsstand and 
get a copy of &quot;Trade-a-Plane&quot;, and browse the ads for guages and sensors...

A casual perusal of an old issue in my office reveals: single CHT (Cylinder 
head temp) guages, single EGT (exhaust gas temperature) guages, combined 
single EGT and CHT, 4 channel EGT, 4 channel CHT, 6 channel sets fro you fols 
with porsche conversions, and even guages with computer controlled scanners 
that scan all the channels, remember high temperatures and sound an alarm if 
it goes out of a 
user-settable range.

Mind you, none of this stuff is cheap.  Single CHT or EGT guages for aircraft
typically cost on the order of $200.  Yow.   It's the paperwork, see, it has 
to exceed the weight of the part or it's not safe for an airplane.
