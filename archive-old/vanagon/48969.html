Subject: Into the valley of death...

      
        ...rode the brave 1600 (cc's that is)

        Well, I'm off for the Sacramento valley, Chico CA to be a little
more exact.

        Lets see...  changed oil and filter (havoline 20-50 and purilator),
replaced air filter, preformed cooling system maintenance (seemed OK, but
hey, this is the valley of death were talking about).

        Well, if you see a '82 diesel on the road between Ashland OR and
Chico CA remember to wave.
