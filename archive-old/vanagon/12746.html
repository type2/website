&gt; 	David S had suggested runnign it on 6V.  Does that seem wise to
&gt; y'all?  DO ya think it would even work?  I'm curious, and would like
&gt; some feedback before I start running amuck with wires and stuff.

The reason I suggested that was because the fridge basically just runs
on a heating element, and while it probably wouldn't get as hot on only
6 volts, I figured it might work well enough to cool the fridge.  Some
one gonna back me up on this?  =)
