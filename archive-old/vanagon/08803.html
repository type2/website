We shouldn't let the idea of ownership of ideas stand in the way of a
useful project. One area where it may be pertinent though is when an
individual makes a contribution which is &quot;patentable&quot;. But assuming that
individuals have already made the contribution freely on this list (ie how to 
install a heater system using only a coat hanger, a small candle and a donut)
then it makes no sense to now begin considering any idea on this list as
intellectual property or even to begin to apply this notion retroactively
to ideas already on the list.
 There may even be instances where an individual does not want to take
responsibility for making a specific contribution (ie in those instances
where the advice led to an accident, or something blew up real good).  DC
