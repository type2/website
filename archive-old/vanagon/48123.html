Subject: Eureka Springs, AR Camping &quot;Event&quot;

Starting with informal talk at June 15th's Busses on '66' and progressing 
to..uh..informal talk today, it looks like there might be a 
semi-organized VW Bus camping get-together in conjunction with NWAVWA's 
Eureka Springs, Arkansas VW Show.  This show is growing by leaps and 
bounds every year and will have both HVWs and VW T&amp;A representation.  If 
anyone is interested, let me know and I will forward info as it becomes 
available.  Should be fun ...  :-)
