Subject: Re: Splitty Webpages

     Sarah
     
     &gt;I'm writing a webpage about my split. I'd like to put some links in 
     &gt;to other split-owners' webpages.
     &gt;Anyone who particularly doesn't want a link on my page let me know or 
     &gt;I might put you on anyway if I find you!
     &gt;Anyone who doesn't mind, mail me your URL. Thanks
     
     Do it Sarah...
