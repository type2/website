Subject: Tank Kill Info


OK.  Is there anyone on the list in San Diego?  Is there someone who 
would be willing to leaf through an old newspaper and find the bus owners 
name?  If someone is willing to do that, I'll find out about his 
INSURANCE!!! 
I haven't gotten any messages saying &quot;Stop it jerk!&quot; so I assume no one 
is against this, even if they aren't for it.
All I can say is that if my Vanagon got run over by a madman in a tank, I 
would be seriously screwed.  I've gone through two vehicles in a month, 
and couldn't afford another.  Maybe the victim (i.e. Vanagon owner) is 
wealthy enough not to worry about it.  Or, maybe he/she is some 
struggling student like a lot of us used to be, or still are today.  
That's my $0.02 and the last I'll say unless there is general support.  Blah.

Chuck
