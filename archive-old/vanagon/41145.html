Subject: solex 32-34 pdsit-2 carb? '72

Hi all;
	I am trying to repair my left hand carb on my '72 bus.  The carb 
that is on it is a solex 32-34 pdsit-2 and so is the used replacement 
that I bought for parts.  However, they look a little different.  the old 
carb has this square thing twards the upper right side nearest the front 
of the bus.  it dosn't look like it is doing anything and appears to be 
missing a cover and some parts.  the new carb does not have this.  
therefore, I am wondering if anything else between the two is different 
like the jets?  they look very similar from the outside but since I don't 
have the old one out, I can't tell about the inside.  I will have to 
replace the upper section and the main body of my carb since the idle and 
fuel cut off solenoids are stripped out and the thing leaks somthing 
terrible.  Any insight would be a BIG  help.  are these two carbs 
interchangable?
thanks.
Ed.

BTW.  as soon as the parts guy finds a rebuild kit he is gonna call me 
back. if any one can email me before he calls it would be really nice.
