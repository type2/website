So Jack says:
&gt; I found a great place for the magnetic mount antenna with a CB.
&gt; The antenna cable was run up the piller behind the cab door, along
&gt; the roof inside the pop-top tent and out onto the luggage rack area.
&gt; It's a large 'flat' area of sheet metal and I don't care if it gets 
&gt; scratched a little.
&gt; When I am about to enter a low vert. clearance area (parking garage)
&gt; I just step up on the bumper, tip the antenna on it's side and drive.
&gt; Performance is acceptable, but a hard mounted antenna is best.  YMMV.

Hey Jack,

I'm having trouble understanding this flat piece of sheet metal part.
I have the fabricated luggage rack.  Is yours different?
