&gt;         Well, I just spent way too much time pouring over the VW type 2
&gt; service manual, the only refrence I can find to oil temp is when the
&gt; thermostat should open (149-158 deg. F). Idiot book says &quot;Oil temp should
&gt; stay below 225 deg. F (180-220 deg. F is ideal)&quot;. That's all I can find on
&gt; the subject, hope it helps.

I'm new to this list and just bought an '81 Vanagon L, the fuel-injected 
motor.  I live in the hot/humid northeast, and after seening this flurry 
of oil temp msgs, I have to wonder: 1) is oil temp a problem in bw buses? 
and 2) what can be done to keep 'em running cool?
