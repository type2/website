Subject: Re: fun road trip for free parts

&gt;I wish I could report that bins of barndoor bus parts were found, but no,
mostly
&gt;engine stuff that should have been thrown away a long time ago.  I did get some
&gt;stuff I could use, like underneath engine tin in better shape than what
&gt;is on my bus now, and Greg liked the Type III fuel-injection fuel pumps.  The
&gt;convertible that we had stopped off to see needed heat-riser seals and a
&gt;shifter, which it will now have, and Dan's bug gets an intake manifold.

Sounds like all the stuff I got in my big parts score a while back ended up
there.
