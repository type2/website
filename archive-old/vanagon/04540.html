&gt; I'd been watching the entire thing, and he was fully aware of this, and 
&gt; then tried to scare me into buying a new tire, saying the plug that had 
&gt; been installed could have damaged the steel belts, causing the tire to 
&gt; de-laminate while driving!  Do I want this idiot psychopath doing my 
&gt; BRAKE WORK???  Sorry...  I think I'll save the time and money, and just go 
&gt; drive off a bridge.  (P.S. - their prices aren't that great either.  Here 
&gt; in Seattle, I'd recommend Discount Tire)
&gt; 

It's amazing that for some reason, tire places are just typically the
shittiest places to go for business.  I've never once, found a place
that could do a simple job without screwing it up in some way.  

It's like second nature to them to find something else wrong when all
you wanted was a new tire or just a rotation and balance.

I REALLY HATE tire stores!
