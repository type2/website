Subject: Camping heater for an '86 Westy?

All this talk about reaching out and turning on some heat when not 
plugged in to shore power really has me interested, but I kow nothing 
about one. A looooong time ago, I used to know about gasoline heaters for 
other applications, but at the time, they seemed to be pretty scarry and 
looked a lot like they might *REALLY* warm you up with a dragon's breath.
 
Since we love to camp during the winter, something that would keep the 
van warm on those long, cold, wet nights (like last weekend) would sure 
be nice. Let us know where we might find something that fits, doesn't 
cost a fortune, is safe, and is easy to install (yeah.... sure).
Thanks - Jack
