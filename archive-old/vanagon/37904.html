Subject: Lubricating other parts at oil change time?

A few months ago there was a post or two about lubricating other parts , 
like door hinges.  Someone, Bob Hoover, maybe said that good mechanics 
lube lots of other parts at oil change time.  Does anyone have a list of 
these lube points for an 84 Vanagon Westy?  How about for other models 
that I could use to develop a list for the 84 Westy?  

Thanks,

John Brown
