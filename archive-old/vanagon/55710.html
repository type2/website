Subject: Signs of Waterpump Death

Looking at the driveway this afternoon, I see my '86 GL creating a small pool
of antifreeze.  Upon inspection, I noted coolant dripping off the end of the
oil filter, but I can't pin it down any closer than that.  I poured a little
water in the overflow tank to bring it up between the marks and am now
pondering the future.

 The waterpump is right over the oil filter there, is this a sign of failure?
