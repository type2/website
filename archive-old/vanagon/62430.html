Standards for California on my 84 Model is as follows:

2500 RPM TEST (2692rpm):
HC  180 Max (Mine was 38) ppm
CO  1.20 Max (Mine was 0.01) %

IDLE TEST (958rpm):
HC  150 Max (Mine was 41) ppm
CO  1.20 Max (Mine was 0.01) %

O2 was 0.20 % although there is no Man/Min Standard (yet)
CO2 was 14.8% although there's no Max/Min Standard (yet)

This was my 2.1 tested at 1.9 (1984) standards.  Had a new O2 Sensor and
New Catalytic Converter, which I'm sure helped.

Not sure what the standards are in other parts of California (if they are
different) using the dreaded Smog II system (required with a
dynamometer).  Where I live, it is not yet required (Northern Calif.), so
we're tested under the old Smog I system.

&gt;Hi Volks,
&gt;Texas recently reinstated emissions testing and I was wondering how
&gt;the criteria here differ from other states, eg the permitted HC is
&gt;220ppm and CO is 1.2% (at least for my year).
&gt;
&gt;And yes, thank you for asking, I passed.  Well, ok, the Vanagon did.
&gt;I just stood there, sweated in the heat, watched, and then paid the
&gt;piper.
