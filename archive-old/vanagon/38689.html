Subject: '54 Deluxe (bus) progress


Well, I got some more work done on the '54.  I cut off the outer and inner
rockers on the driver's (RHD) side, trimmed up the longitudinal frame member
on the driver's side, and removed the starter (not as easy as it would
sound) and the heater muffler on the driver's side (also not as easy as it
would sound)

Then today I did more blasting.  I wasn't as motivated, probably also
because the quality of my sand had degraded somewhat, making it considerably
less effective and very, very dusty.  At times I couldn't see the work
because of the dust I was pumping out!

Anyway, the sandbalster is working great.  I think in the future I'll limit
my sand re-use to 2 go-rounds.  I had absolutely no clogging today, but I
don't know what the relative humidity was.  (Ok, I know what it is:  the
sweat the breaks out on your forehead when you get caught with your
girlfriends sister)
