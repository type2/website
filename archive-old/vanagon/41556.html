you can get these poundy things- its a piece of d*mn sturdy flat metal =
about
1/2 thick that had a place for the big nut, and a place to hit it, you =
take a
big hammer and pound the nut  off.  works a treat.  they  come in 36mm =
and
46mm sizes.   I've seem them for sale at vw shops for ~$5, and well =
worth it.
  just make sure the wheels are on the ground and the parking brakes on.
  actually, this could also be used to free stuck rear wheels too.

my two cents



It also helps to use a soft (brass, etc) hammer, as otherwiseyou will =
mar up the wheel (personal experience).  But, these things really work!
