No, not mine.  :)
	The guy selling the *other* '73 Blue Safare Custom Camper in San Diego
has apparently lowered his price from $1800 to $1500.  It is a rust-free
hi-top in (supposedly) good running condition but most of the camping
stuff has been torn out.  If anyone buys it, I will give them $50 to
trade the blue table for my yellow one.  :)  The phone number is:

619-490-1187

I have looked at this bus and can provide details to interested parties.
