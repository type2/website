Subject: International VW Beetle Day

Howdy

I was reading the morning paper, when an article in the 'Drive' section of
the newspaper caught my. In a Canadian Press (CP) story that originated in
Calgary: 

&quot;What a long, strange trip it's been. 

&gt;From doubtful beginnings on a drawing board in Germany in 1934 to its
unlikely status as an automotive icon, no car has been revered around the
world than the venerable Volkswagen Beetle. 

Today, Volkswagen fans worldwide will gather at auto shops, spit-and-shine
meets and even on the Internet to swap parts and stories as part of
International VW Beetle Day.&quot;

WHAT, International VW Beetle Day? And I forgot to get my bug roses! Is it
too late to rush out a get a bottle of synthetic oil? Are list-members in
danger when the general public finds out that we swap parts and stories on
the Internet on a daily basis?

I realize that I live in a VW backwater, but I haven't seen ANY posts about
this 'most revered day' on the three VW lists I'm subscribed to. Is this for
real? Has anyone ever heard of the International Beetle Day? Or is it just
hype generated by a Calgary VW shop? 

I am doubtful that this day really exists. The entire article is somewhat a
laugh, as it includes &quot;'...The [beetle] was a design of genius, a century
before its time' says Peter Tucker, who runs a cross-Canada parts
distribution network out of his Beetle Shop garage in Calgary.&quot; 

A CENTURY before its time - years I can agree with, hell I'd go with
decades, but a CENTURY? 

So, my question is &quot;has anyone else heard of International Beetle Day?&quot; 

A millennium before my time,
Joe Helwig
