&gt;Hello all,
&gt;	I found in the archives that there are generic 3-wire O2 sensors 
&gt;available as well as some Bosch units that do not have the correct 
&gt;connector and need to be spliced.  There are 2 white wires and one black 
&gt;one. How do you make sure that the white wires are correctly matched? Or 
&gt;does it matter? Thanks in advance.
&gt;
&gt;

The white wires are for the heater.  Polarity does not matter.  If the sensor
has three different colored wires as used on some Chrysler products, it will
not work in the Vanagon.
