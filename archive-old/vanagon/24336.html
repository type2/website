&gt;&gt;According to my dealer, the '96 Eurovans will arrive with the '96 model
&gt;&gt;year, WITHOUT a six cylinder model.  The five cylinder will remain the only
&gt;&gt;engine choice for about six months, when the VR6 is expected to be
&gt;&gt;available.  The van is essentially identical to the previous years' Eurovans.

&gt;I am almost sure your dealer is talking about the Winnebago Eurovan Camper
&gt;for the 96 model (which has a 5 cylinder engine). In fact this is the only
&gt;model available in US this year.
&gt;

I was at the dealer today -- I'm in the process of buying a '93 Eurovan GL
from him.  I asked him about the Windstar-like vans being jointly produced
by VW &amp; FOrd in Europe -- he said they son't know if it'll get stateside.  I
then brought up your original post about '96 models, and he said yes,
they'll be in soon, and that he already had the '96 parts microfiche for
them.  I asked if I should wait for a new one to come in so I could get a
VR6, &amp; that's when he told me about the VR6 not being available right away.
He even had the rough price ranges for the different Eurovan models. So,
unless he's BSin' me...

&gt;It is not clear what camper models VW is planning to bring out with the VR6
&gt;engines. I sure hope they bring at least a &quot;Weekender Westfalia&quot;. I test
&gt;drove the 95 Winnebago Eurovan Camper and did not like it.

I wish the VR6 were available, too.  But, I must say the Eurovan is one FUN
vehicle to drive.  I need a van, can't wait, and the overall ergonomics of
the Eurovan outweigh the 105hp.  The thing feels peppy. I know 0-60 is an
eternity, but on the interstate, it's right in the power band and it'll
accelerate pretty quickly. Of course, its pretty flat in Louisiana -- that
helps!
