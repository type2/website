Subject: Re: WHy VW's + T&amp;A

Hey looks like we have a potential Drug Store VW mag writer here.  Lack 
of content is good.  Juvenile style is apparent.  Reuse of old material 
preteending its meaningful.

Mature him a little and he'll be quite good.  Maybe he can give me a 
little of this high wit as well.
