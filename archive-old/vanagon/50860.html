Yokohamas are what I will continue to use on any vanagon I own.  They
are quiet,
comfortable, handle well on pavement or gravel, wet or dry.  I ran
them with 58 psi rear and 48 front on pavement, 10 psi less on gravel
without a single flat.

I am assuming that your Yohohamas are Y370 LT 195 75/R14.  
On summer pavement I used 43 psi front and 53 psi rear. Harry Yates of
Langley, BC, Canada loves these tires and I bought mine based on his
reports. He informed me that he uses 45 psi front and 53 psi rear. Both
of you are using a 10 psi difference. I think I'll try the same.
