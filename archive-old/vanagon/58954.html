	Anyone know the correct procedure for installing the transmission mounts
(the little ball type mounts). I guess I'm asking what torque or how tight
should they be mounted. Also, considering the design, what keeps the
transmission from sliding off the suckers and sending the engine and itself
right through the rear hatch.
