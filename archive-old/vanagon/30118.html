Subject: Stereo and speakers

All,

For those of you who have replaced their VW radios, what kind did you get, and
more importantly, where did you put speakers, other than the stock mount.
I would like to add a digital tuner, and a tapedeck or cd player, as the
radio stations are too close together for a non digital tuner, and one does
not have to drive far to lose the station.

Cheers

David
