&gt; 
&gt; Well, after 9 weeks at my local vw mechanic my '79 Cal bus is going to be
&gt; fixed. The mechanic says they're giving up on the brain-fix and are going to
&gt; remove all the computer-ignition stuff and install a center-mount Weber
&gt; carb. It is claimed this will get me more power and be easier to repair in
&gt; the future.  The cost of a new &quot;black box&quot; and injectors (which I guess were
&gt; also bad) would have been in the $900 range, the carb will be around $500 or so.
&gt; 
&gt; This was one of the options I suggested to them way back, but was poo-pooed
&gt; as impractical -- &quot;you don't want to remove that fuel injection system!&quot; --
&gt; etc.   Since I'm not in Cal, the tyrannical emissions regulations are not a
&gt; problem.  Question: has anyone else gone this route with a bus? What are the
&gt; advantages/disadvantages?

I went this route on my '73 after the PO put in an old Chrysler carb with black 
iron pipe manifolds and no air cleaner or working choke.  Very high 
entertainment value.  My 1700 is roughly the same installation as yours as far 
as the weber goes except that you need an electric fuel pump (Mine still had a 
mechanical pump). My advice is to do the work yourself and not give it to a 
proven incompent bozzo to screw up.  Firstly $500 is way too much for the basic 
carb.  Mine was Can$200 used and is worth about Can$300 new (about US$200)  
installation is easy as well as running in nice weather.  Problems occur when 
you need carb heat to prevent icing (yes carb icing the ccourge of the the pre 
WWII car is alive and well in the centre mounted Weber.  You need heat to make 
it work.  If I were you I'd fix the FI system myself (its good practice)  invest 
in some books on Bosch fuel injection systems, VOM, tools and go through it.  
Oh hah, the ,79 has no provision for carb heat, it was meant to be compensated 
for directly by the FI.  Found this out on a parts bus that I stripped.  If 
this sound like it is hard, well it is.  That is why we drive VW buses. If you 
want to hand your chariot over to some mechanic (aka Bozo) to fondle then your 
better off with a Ford.

If you really want the Weber contact me directly and I'll relate some of the 
things that need to be done.  Also if you get the mechanic to do it make sure 
that you get ALL the FI parts back.  There are others who can use them.
