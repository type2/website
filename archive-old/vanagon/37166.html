thern California.  The thermometer on the wall of the
shop read 78.  The one in the patio, 80.  Those two thermometers never agree
on anything.

I had to run all over doing errands and chasing down a part needed for an
engine I'm building.  Drove the thirty-seven miles into San Diego and another
dozen trying to find a place to park only to learn the kewl VW-only place
didn't carry what I wanted.  What they carried was ''just as good', of
course.  Except for the fact it's a piece of crap.  Drove another dozen miles
to another place, they didn't have it either.  Wound up back home or at least
close to it, at Paradize VW in San Mucus.  I don't like to shop there because
they have funny ideas about how to price things.  They also have a habit of
trying to sell you old or damaged parts -- &quot;Gee...  I never noticed that!&quot;
 'That' being the fact the box had been opened and the bearings polished with
#36 sandpaper.

While I was waiting to be waited on a couple of kids get in this high-IQ
shouting match.  You know the kind:  

&quot;Oh yeah?&quot;  &quot;Yeah!&quot;  
&quot;Oh yeah?&quot;  &quot;Yeah!!&quot;  
&quot;Oh Yeah??!&quot;  &quot;Yeah!!!&quot;

I was about to drop-kick their skinny butts out the door when they took it
outside, followed by half the patrons in the store.  I snagged the salesboy
on his way out, got what I needed and left.

The Whiz Kids were having a dispute about their vehicles, both of which were
puke-type bugs with big tires, little steering wheels and Kadron carbs
sticking out in all directions. I don't know what the dispute was about but
it was obviously important since they decided to settle the matter mano e
mano, by driving like idiots, making a lot of noise and generally acting like
fools, which they proceeded to do.

I caught up to them at the on-ramp to the freeway, onto which they fled in a
cloud of smoke.  Two clouds, come to think of it.

I caught up to them again as they were racing up the hill toward Mar Vista
Drive, neck and neck in the two outside lanes, snarling up traffic as their
wild rides ground up the hill.  They were doing at least fifty, noses up
close to the windscreens.  They both wore baseball caps.  Had them on
backwards so they could get their noses closer to the glass, or something.
 Makes a bug go faster when you do that, I guess.  

 Warm day, old bus.  You don't want to push it too hard going up a grade.  I
blew by them doing about sixty-five.  Everybody else was doing seventy, mebbe
eighty, the way they do.  Drive too slow, you'll get a ticket for obstructing
traffic.  Seriously.  

The kids in their respective pieces of crap where still back there, laying a
regular smoke screen, struggling up the hill side by side, speed down to
about forty-five when I reached my off-ramp.  

I drove all over today, chasing parts.  One hundred and fourteen miles.  Five
gallons of gas.  Couple of hours of time.  I wonder what those kids were
chasing, what with their funny tires and all that chrome and no deck lids.
 It certainly wasn't performance.   A stock bug could of eaten them alive.

Funnier Story

Remember me getting all het-up over those crappy bolt-on full-flow
filter/pump adaptors that didn't fit?

They're still selling them.  No, I'm serious!  VW Performance Parts out in La
Mesa and that other place, the one in San Mucus.  And yes, they know they
don't fit.

No, I don't know why they're still trying to sell them either.   The thing
don't fit and everyone with a lick of sense knows it. 

Come to think of it, I know a couple of kids who'll buy the things...
