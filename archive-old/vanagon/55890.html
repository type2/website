Subject: &quot;Koolatron&quot; cooler

I just saw an ad in a magazine for a electric cooler (two sizes - 14qt, and
30qt) made by a company called &quot;Koolatron&quot;. It says the cooler is powered by
regular 12v car battery current, and can be plugged into your cigarette
lighter. Unplugged, it stores enough charged current to keep food cold for 24
hours. Plugged into your car with engine off, it only draws 3 amps of current
an hour. It says that it works by the use of a &quot;thermoelectric module&quot;. The
cooler also doubles as a food warmer with the flip of a switch, and can heat
food up to 125 degrees. The price is around $70 for the 30qt one, and $40 for
the 14qt one. It sounds like an interesting product.
Has anybody purchased one of these yet, and if so, what do you think?

I'm guessing any improvements over the Dometic would be good...
