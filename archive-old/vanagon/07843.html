Subject: Re: 1.9 engine rebuild

I have been considering to rebuild my 83 westy's 1.9 liter engine. It is 
suffering from the common head gasket/cooling system syndrome. It is also 
obviously powerless comparing to my 84 Vanagon (at 105k miles).

My question is if it is possible to upgrade it to 2.1 liter. I am wondering if
it is interchangeable between 1.9 and 2.1 cylinder liner sets. I probably have
to replace my 1.9 heads and the liner set so why not go for the 2.1 parts.

Another possibility is to find a 2.1 liter engine in good shape and trade 
the 60k mile 1.9 engine from my westy. Will the 2.1 engine fit the 1.9 tranny
or do I have to get the tranny all together?  Anyone with experience on this?
