Yes, same license plate.  What book did you get this from?  Sounds like
something I need for my collection.  The brochure I have is 11 pages,
complete with what appears to be a dealer stamp (Rolf Geiger, 7640 Kehl, 7604
Appenweier) 

The interior of the Oettinger appears to be the same (excepting minor detail
differences), but the body kit on the Oettinger is a bit more agressive.  The
one in the brochure I mentioned earlier appears to be bone-stock VW.
 According to the article I have about the Oettinger, the engine was an
experimental project commissioned by VW, but VW decided not to produce it.
 It was created by adding an extra pair of cylinders to a revised crankshaft
and crankcase.  The internal dimensions are the same as the 2.1 liter (94mm
bore and 76mm stroke), I assume in an effort to keep manufacturing costs
down.  The pictures I have are great, with tire smoke pouring out of the rear
wheel wells
