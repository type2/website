Subject: Re: Syncro shaft seal

Hi, sorry for the general post, I forgot who asked this....

Quoting from Bentley only, no firsthand experience.

To change the rear driveshaft seal on a syncro trans you have to remove the 
shaft. Loosen (do NOT remove!) the 4 front diff mounts, 2 on the big rubber 
isolation mounts, 2 on the sides. Then remove the whole shaft. I would mark 
the orientation of everything before removal, just in case. Remove the shaft 
nut on the trans and pull off the flange (puller may be needed). You will 
have to brace the flange against rotation BTW, maybe being in gear would do? 
Don't walk the van off its supports. Pull out the seal ?? VW tool #.... have 
fun. Don't use anything metal to pry with. Install new seal using VW tool 
#... or do it by using a big socket to push evenly, but to what depth? 
Replace flange, tighten main nut to 118ft-lbs, replace shaft, tighten nuts 
to 26ft-lb, align front diff/shaft lengthwise and tighten diff mounts.
        Personally, I can't see needing to disconnect anything other than 
the rearmost end of the drive-shaft, tie it up/drop it out of the way. Maybe 
there isn't clearance or the angles are too steep?? MSDS guy recommends 
polishing the shaft where it rides on the seal, sounds like a good idea. 
Dunno how though, unless you are willing to run the motor, lift a rear wheel 
and hold some carborundum paper against the shaft while in gear, scarey 
stuff. Hope it goes well. tim s.
