&gt;&gt;Hmmm???  My wife's 88 rides nice and smoothly as I believe your's should.  
&gt;&gt;What tires do you have?  
&gt;&gt;Have you tested the shocks?  Test them by pushing down good &amp; hard with you
&gt;&gt;body weight on one corner of the van (don't break your bumper!) and watching
&gt;&gt;the response.  The corner should rise back up, then down &amp; stop.  If it
&gt;&gt;bounces any more than that, the shock it bad.

Well, here's the scoop: I'm riding Goodyear Regatta touring tires, size
P195/70R14 _at_ 36 psi all around. Based on the simple shock test mentioned
above, my shocks seem to be fine. How could I tell if the tires are
reinforced, or would that even make a difference?

P.S. My apologies to the subject police! Honest officer, I swear I didn't
see that subject line :-)
