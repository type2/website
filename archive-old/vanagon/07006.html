&gt; The red switch would trigger the creation of a hostile environment for
&gt; Mr. Thief:  Electrical shocks, loud sirens, red pepper and dye sprayed
One problem with the pepper (although I must say that I sure do like the
idea) is that you would not be able to drive into Canada.  The border check
specifically asks for pepper spray.
