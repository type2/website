Subject: Fix or Dump?

To those of you who suffered through my engine heat problems, the bad 
news continues.  After replacing one head, the engine ran OK for a while, 
but heated up badly and I've been advised I'm looking at significant 
repair costs.  The diagnosis prior to tear-down is one and probably two 
cracked heads and a scored or damaged piston.

I can get $1000 cash for my 85 camper as it sits with a slide-in double 
seat.  The body is in good condition.  Shows some rust spots but nothing 
that can't be controlled.

In addition to an engine rebuild, I have a clicking sound that emanates 
from the vicinity of the rear wheels.  I suspect CV joints, but haven't 
fully diagnosed that as yet.

Further, I know I need new brake cylinders in back and new linings.  I 
don't know if I have to turn the drums or not, but I think not.

Beyond this, I've been advised that with my mileage of 115,000, I can 
expect transmission (4-speed manual) and power steering rack problems in 
the next few years.

For planning purposes, I can afford to repair the vehicle, but would not 
want to take on another car payment right now as I recently bought a 
pickup.  So, if I buy another, I'm going to have to look at $5000 tops.

The question is:  fix or dump it?
