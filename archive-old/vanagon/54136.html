Subject: Re: Rear heater core - solved

&gt;I was offered a Polo heater by a breakers yard for 20 UK pounds, too small
&gt;a saving to forego the new part. BTW is the Polo as popular in the USA as
&gt;it is here?

Well, I was at Hilton Head S.C. the summer before last, and played a few rounds
of Polo, was nearly thrown from the damn horse......


OH!!! you mean a VW Polo??  As in the car??  Don't know.  They don't sell them
here in the US.
