        &quot;She knew the most intimate details. It was
        amazing!&quot;  --Charlene, Philadelphia


Ready to have your bus problems solved? Do you need your mechanical luck to
change? Then call 1-99-VW-ANGEL. We have real Bus Psychics waiting to tell
you everything you need to know.


        &quot;I was skeptical at first, but the psychic told me
        that the wiring under my dash was all hacked up.
        How could she know that?&quot;   Bill, Houston


Call soon, because your first ten minutes are free! No tricks, no
gimmicks--we want you to know that 1-900-VW-ANGEL is real!


        &quot;I asked the psychic when my next catastrophic
        breakdown would be. She said, 'within a hundred
        miles, and it'll be raining good and hard, too.'
        She was right!!!&quot;    Nate, Boulder, CO


Remember, the psychics at 1-900-VW-ANGELS are REAL PSYCHICS. Not losers who
would otherwise have to work at Taco Bell, like some other so-called Bus
Psychics. Call, and you'll know right away. Your first ten minutes are free!


        &quot;The psychic knew about the rust under my
        windshield.&quot;   --Nancy, Los Angeles


        &quot;By calling 1-900-VW-ANGELS, I averted an
        engine fire! I'm calling again tomorrow!&quot;
        --Wolfgang, Seattle


        &quot;She knew I was not the first owner. I'm
        a believer now!&quot;   --Charlene, Houston


        &quot;The psychic warned me to carry lots and lots
        of tools with me at all times. And my bus
        broke the very next day!!!&quot;
        --Jerry, Minneapolis


Remember, your first ten minutes are absolutely free! Call NOW!
