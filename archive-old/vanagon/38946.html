&gt;In doing the heads and (sorta) top-end overhaul on my 85 vanagon, I pulled
&gt;the
&gt;pistons and cylinders to find nicks on the pistons and on the end of the
&gt;cylinders with the cut-out section.  I don't know what caused this.  I'm
told
&gt;I
&gt;can't possibly re-use these pistons.  Has anyone had a similar experience? 
&gt;Could I possibly reuse the same cylinders, or will they just damage new
&gt;pistons?
&gt;
&gt;

The dents and holes in the pistond are caused by coolant getting into the
combustion area.  The antifreeze explodes when the mixture ignites leving all
those dents and dings behind.  Coolant is also very corrosive when heated and
exposed to air outside of the cooling system.  This is why it is critical
that coolant never gets into the crankcase.  Coolant in the oil will destroy
the main and rod bearings very quickly.  Piston/cylinder asets are now
available aftermarket.  I can get you either brazilizn or german sets.  If
your heads are damaged, you can get welded up rebuilds from GEX.
