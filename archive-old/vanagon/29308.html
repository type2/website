Subject:  towing a syncro

sorry to post this to the list, but i have temporarily lost access to the
archives.  i once read, but forgot, what the consensus was on towing a
syncro with all four wheels on the ground, and wanted to check before
my friend tows one an unlimited distance at unlimited speed. :^)  could
some patient sould remind me/confirm that this is ok?  thanks.
