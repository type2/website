&gt; 		 RPM    TIMING      DWELL
&gt; 		 850     2 ATDC      51
&gt; 		1500     24 BTDC     50
&gt; 		2000     32 BTDC     48
&gt; 		2500     36 BTDC     47
&gt; 		3000     44 BTDC     46
According to the bently manual the dwell should only move +-1 degree with 
increasing rpms, any more than this indicates a worn dist drive shaft.  
If the numbers above are from your engine maybe that is the problem.
