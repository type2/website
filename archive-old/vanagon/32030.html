Subject: some Hemmings Motor News for sale stuff

Hi folks,

I saw this ad in Hemmings and since I'm gas heated already (and lovin' it!)
I'm passing this on to you!  It doesn't specify if the heater is a Southwind
or Eberspacher.  If it's an Eberspacher that's working it would be worth it
for you &quot;Heatless in Seattle&quot; crowd. 

&quot;VW Transporter gas fired heater, complete, excellent condition $100. PH:
219-686-3191 IN&quot;

This also might be of interest to some:

&quot;VW radios: AM/FM, 6/12-volt, bought, sold, traded and restored; VISA, MC,
COD. Classic Car Radio, 2718 Koper, Sterling Heights, MI 48310, PH:
810-977-7979 orders; 810-268-2918 info; FAX: 810-977-0895;
http://www_dot_car-trek_dot_com/ccr&quot;

And this too:

&quot;Volkswagen accessory Hella/Bosch foglights, used in 50s-60s NOS, $350 pr;
used, $175 pr 310-371-3919, CA&quot;

And here's another ad that struck (bludgeoned) my fancy:

&quot;VOLKSWAGEN: 1966 Westfalia camper bus, in storage for 20 years, needs
complete restoration, camper interior is all there and in good shape, engine
is not running, original paint, body is straight, has lower rust, frame is
solid, $1,000. PH 603-253-6494 NH.


Unfortunately, my fingers aren't as nimble as Joel's (and also I'm just
plain lazy) so that's it for now.  To get your free copy of Hemmings Motor
News, you can check out http://sover_dot_net/~hemmings/sub.html/  .
