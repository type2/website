Subject: Pits in the case

I discovered that my '84 has a few pits in the case, under the head 
gasket.  These are very similar to the (numerous) pits in the head, and 
line up with areas where the head gasket was damaged.  (yes, the coolant 
dripping from the heads problem can suddenly turn into a shower of hot 
water!)

Has anyone else run into this?  I intend to patch them with JB weld, 
since they are very few in number.  It seems like this sort of patch 
should hold up better on the case than on pits in the head, because of 
the head gasket wrapping around the case, but I would like to hear from 
anyone who has any ideas.

Bill
