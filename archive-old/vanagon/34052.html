Hey, Vanagoners -

Did you know that all that your main line of communication with the
&quot;beast that bears you&quot; is a simple piece of ever-fatiguing plastic?  
Well, it's true: The hinge at the base of your accelerator pedal is
nothing more than a weak spot in a single piece (which, by the way, is
*riveted* to the floor) that allows the whole assembly to flex in response 
to the pressure of your foot.  I found this out the hard way, of course,
when my accelerator cable froze up and I tried to free it by pulling back
on the pedal.  Of course by this time I had adopted an uncharacteristically
exasperated and frustrated attitude and at the end of this futile exercise,
the pedal remained in my hand whereas its prior attachments stubbornly 
retained their prior positions. I was eventually able to free the cable,
but the damage had been done, there was no longer a pivot at the base of the 
pedal.

This makes for challenging driving.  In fact, due to the necessity of &quot;driving on 
eggshells&quot; (to keep the base of the pedal from slipping out from its pocket in 
the carpet)  I have come to appreciate the skill and patience that necessarily 
derives from driving those diesel beasts; you have to *read* the oncoming traffic
when merging and turning and *plan* your position well before you reach it.  I 
hadn't  experienced the need for this type of driving skill (rare in MA) since 
I sold my '66 bus. 

So I fixed the root cause tonight.  It's not a perfect solution but it works 
for me.  I replaced the plastic hinge on the accelerator pedal with a rubber one
by using a section of an old bicycle tire tube.  I simply drilled two holes in
the base of the pedal and screwed that to the tube section, then used two gnarly 
sheet metal screws down through the other end of the tube section and into the 
heads of the rivets that hold down the broken pedal hinge. The pedal now has more 
sideways movement than I'd like, but that could probably be corrected by 
stretching the rubber more in the sideways direction.

That's my cheapo solution to an uncommon problem.  Maybe someone will benefit,
maybe not.  But thanks for letting me vent.
