I'll agree this is seems to be an &quot;easy&quot; conversion, and used Rabbit/Golf
engines are only $600 here.  It's one I thought I might try someday.  In
addition to the list above, I was thinking you might need these too: 

diesel Vanagon belhousing or an adaptor
diesel vanagon trans. input shaft (it's longer)
diesel vanagon flywheel (assuming the water boxer flywheel doesn't bolt 
to a Rabbit crankshaft)
