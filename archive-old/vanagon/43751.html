Subject: URGENT: combustion chamber depth spec.?????

My favorite garage is working on my 91 GL and needs to know the combustion
chamber depth spec. ASAP.  At least we think that's what the info. would be
called.
The heads needed to be milled (I don't know anything about this stuff) and
he says he needs this spec. to put it all back together. Help please and
THANKS.
