Subject: Ball joint bushings on a 1971 Westy

Hey Volks!

I am getting ready to tackle the ball joints on my Westy next weekend. In 
Bob's sermon about ball joints he recommends replacing the torsion arm 
bearings with new urethane bushings. Does any one out there in VW land know of 
a source for these bushings? 

BTW, Bob mentioned getting new torsion arms with ball joints already installed 
but didn't know a source. I am getting a set of four ($150) from Wolfgang 
International in Redding (916 246-4264). I'll keep the list updated regarding 
quality, etc.

Thanks,


-Scott
