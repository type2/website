Subject: Re: Re powering `82 Diesel with 1.9 Tur

   From: zeidler_at_NTCNTG02DU.ntc.nokia_dot_com (Zeidler Helmut NTC/Dusseld.)

&gt;    I heard about the interference, but couldn't figure out why. Both
&gt;    manuals, Golf and Vanagon, are showing the same picture about the
&gt;    charger setup. Do anyone have a drawing about this?

I have scanned drawings of the two different turbo and manifold
setups used on VW diesels sold in the US. See:

	http://www.cs.rochester_dot_edu/u/jag/vw/engine/turbo/turbo.html

The installation in the Golf/Jetta has the turbo symmetrically in
the middle between cyl 2 and 3. The Quantum (and I believe Audi
80 and 4000) has the turbo offset to the side. I've got some real
pics of Golf/Jetta installation too. Just sent out to have them developed.
Will scan when I get them back.

I don't have any drawings from the Vanagon TD (never sold here
in  the US) I would appreciate if somebody in Europe could scan these 
from the manual, or send me photocopise and I will scan.
