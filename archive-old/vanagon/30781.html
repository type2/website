Rob (barwise_at_tuxedo.ENET_dot_dec_dot_com) commented:

&gt;My previously-
&gt;reported power window getting stuck in the down position was not
&gt;resolved by the dealer (re-lubed).  Someone here reported a recall on the
the 
&gt;windows, but the dealer denied that, saying there are recalls on Passats 
&gt;only.  I'd appreciate any further info on that.


Around the spring of '94 I took my EV in for a power window regulator recall.
I have the scratches on my window tint to prove that someone monkeyed around
with the power windows...
At the same time, another recall to correct an incorrectly torqued nut on the
shifter
was done.  I had a loose shift knob to show for that one...

So there you have it, Rob, your dealer is lying to you;  call VWOA and sic
'em on
your dealer.

While I'm here, I'm coming up on the end of the 2 year bumper-to-bumper
warranty;
Has anyone compiled a list of final checks for the dealer to go over before
we as owners
grab our ankles?
This (so far) has been the most reliable VW I've owned yet, but occaisionally
I hear
interesting sounds from the engine that make me wonder...
