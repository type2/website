&gt;&gt; I inflated to the door sticker pressure, despite the 40psi on my tires.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Just my opinion.

&gt;Dave,
&gt;NO NO NO!!  This is wrong and may get you killed one day.  The number
&gt;printed on the tire -- the Max. Cold Inflation Pressure -- is just that.
&gt;the MAXIMUM.  If you inflate the tire more than this, you risk
&gt;catastrophic tire failure.  This is because as the tire heats up when
&gt;driving, the air inside expands, increasing pressure.  Eventually you
&gt;will get to the point where the tire fails.  Then, you read on teh Type
&gt;2 list about a fellow who rolled his Westy when the right rear tire
&gt;blew.  
&gt;
&gt;The sticker on the door is good but only if you buy tires that can
&gt;handle the inflation pressure listed on teh sticker.  The max on the
&gt;tire is first as far as authority, the sticker is second.  NEVER inflate
&gt;beyond the max on the tire, no matter what the sticker says.  Then go
&gt;out and buy proper tires for your vehicle. 
Hmmmm. I stand (or drive) corrected. I'll have to recheck my tires. I do 
use Michelins with reinforced sidewalls, so I know I have the correct 
tires. Maybe my inflation pressure on the tire is higher, and I just 
don't remember it.

[Next morning, 7am. My tires are Michelin XZX, with 40 lbs. Max cold 
pressure. I'm a bit shocked at having given dangerous advice to the list, 
and very glad people caught it. The sad part is that a staff member at a 
tire place set me on the &quot;sticker path&quot; years ago. The sadder part is 
that I never questioned it.]

Thanks for the warning.

PS--Remember Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas when Hunter S. Thompson 
filled the tires up to 110lbs. so they'd make the right squeal going 
around corners? Now _there's_ a serious judgement problem. (this book was 
fictionalized, BTW) 

PPS--I'm switching over to 205 tires from 185 tires. Can I do it 
gradually, putting the two 205s on the rear wheels and leaving the 185s 
on the front tires for a few thousand miles? or will I mess up the ride 
and the tires? I hate to just replace the front tires, they're still in 
such good condition. anybody want to buy a Michelin XZX 185 or two for a 
good price?
