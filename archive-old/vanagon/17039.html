&gt; 57 Microbus   1  66 Microbus  11  75 Bus   5  87 Vanagon  24
&gt; 58 Microbus   0  67 Microbus   8  76 Bus   7  88 Vanagon   5

Excluding Thom, does this make the the honorary owner of the oldest 
bus on the list? 

&quot;Don't forget to walk your Chia Pet.&quot;

Oh speaking of that, couple questions for the guru's.

Does anyone have a connection for 50's bumpers?  Looking for a set 
for my bus.

What year did they change the dashboard around the radio on the 
microbus?  I put a normal DIN sized radio in my '67 (No it was 
already cut up), and there is solid metal around the whole thing.  In 
my friends '64 he has a fullsize radio in his, but there is not metal 
around the whole thing, the little slots cut into the dashboard don't 
quit before the radio.  Likewise my '57 is this way, if I were to put 
a new radio in there (Not even considering it!) it wouldn't fit with 
solid metal around it.

I am guessing it was changed like '66 or somewhere in there?  Ideas.

Lastly:

Is there a company that either refinishes steering wheels.  The 
enamel (?) is worn off the '57's and I'd like it fixed.  I hear 
though that the wheel doesn't come off exactly easy.  Is there a 
place that sells repro's?

Thanks for any help!
