Subject: It didn't start today. (The van, I mean.) 

When I mounted the brave charger this afternoon to go to the 
shops in the snow, it wouldn't work.  The blue thing just sat 
on the road and grunted at me.  Every time I turned the key, 
the engine turned normally.  Except it wouldn't fire.

I trundled down the hill unpowered and tried again.  The 
wonderful 1.9L diesel engine that does 38.5mpg kept farting and 
spluttering for nearly ten minutes.  I cranked it about ten 
times during that period.

Just as I was about to walk the 100 yards to the shop, the 
engine chugged into life with an apologetic plume of grey smoke 
and it has run perfectly since.  FYI, my first task was to go 
to the VW garage to fill the tank and I mentioned it to one of 
the mechanics.  He said &quot;Isn't that strange?&quot; and walked away.  
I guess I owe them too much money.

Today had the first fall of snow of the winter here, a full 
quarter inch that lasted all of one hour on the ground.  Maybe 
the blue thing is frightened?  It might not have seen snow 
before.

I wonder what will happen tomorrow ...
