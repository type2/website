&gt;I was driving my drafty old '69 in Pennsylvania one winter day and stopped
&gt;to get Wendy's french fries (the fat, ---steaming---, fluffy kind - BTW, I
&gt;have no personal affiliation with Wendy's). This was my get-warm ritual.
&gt;Well, this particular day was about 20 degrees and 100% relative humidity.
&gt;As I sat in my beast eating the french fries, the steam rose to the
&gt;ceiling, cooled on its way down, and, I sh*t you not, fell as snow into the
&gt;speedo cup to a depth of about a millimeter!
&gt;
&gt;There! can anyone else claim actual meteorlogic activity inside their bus?
&gt;I think (also hope) not.


Well, not inside a bus.

But in Meeneesoota, driving my '70 bug, I often engaged in the time-honored
practice (at least up there) of steering with the left hand while scraping
the ice off the windshield with the right. This created realistic-looking
&quot;snowflakes&quot; that fell all over me, passenger, map, book, and never melted
due to the absent rusted-out heater channels.

Well, OK, this was not actual weather as yours was-- I was just moving
the ice from one place to another.

Remember in the movie &quot;Oh God&quot;, when John Denver got rained on inside an
AMC Pacer while the sun shone brightly outside?

Up in Thule, Greenland (halfway between the Arctic Circle and the North 
Pole),
a standard trick to show a newbie in Jan or Feb, was to get a cup of hot
coffee at the mess hall, walk outside, and pitch the coffee out of the cup,
up in the air while it was about 40 below. A huge burst of steam, a 
crackling
sound, and freeze-dried coffee fell all around you. Also, sometimes, the
empty mug would shatter in your hand. This tended to pi** off the cooks.
