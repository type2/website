Ang=E5ende:	SV: Sudden Engine power loss



Help.=20

While dirving at highway speed my 89 Westy will suddenly loses power for =

2-3 seconds. After the lurch the engine runs fine the rest of the trip.=20
 This symptom happens occasionally- say three times in a month. Its=20
taking away the fun on driving. =20

Does any one have any ideas?


I had a similar problem on my '88 Caravelle. On a long run, after about =
200km, the engine would momentarily cut out. This would happen more and =
more frequently until it was impossible to drive further. If I stopped =
the van for a quarter of an hour or so, the problem would disappear. I =
searched for the answer to this problem for over a year before an expert =
friend who works for VW gave me the answer.
There is a &quot;bug&quot; in the electronics which affects about ten per cent of =
production models and VW have come up with a modification which cures =
this &quot;bug&quot;.
This modification consists of a new cable, containing extra electronics. =
You remove the large cable connection that goes to the air volume meter =
on the air filter, then mount the modification cable between the =
original cable and the air filter.
Sorry, but I do not know what the part number is for this modification, =
but I do know that VW are very cagey about giving out information, as =
this is a &quot;built in&quot; fault. However I can guarantee that this =
modification really works. I have just completed an extensive tour of =
Europe with the modification fitted and had no problems with the engine =
cutting out.
I hope that this info is of some help. Please don't hesitate to contact =
me personally if you want some further information.
