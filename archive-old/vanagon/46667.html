hey now!

congrats....i kinda know how you feel...i'm getting married in may...and 
i met my fiancee at a campout party with some vws of vws..and we sat in my 
van and talked all night the first night we met. then on down the road 
about 6 months we were at a bluegrass festival and i proposed to her over 
a dinner in the van, with candles on the table and a bottle of red wine. 
i hope when we start a family it will begin in a vw van and i'll have the 
oppurtunity to take my kids all over in it. 

i wish the best for you and your lady.

much love,

jonathan '74 retrowestie
