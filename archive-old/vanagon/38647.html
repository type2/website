Subject: Re: 81 hot start problem

&gt;I've got an '81 Vanagon with hot start problems.  Cold, it starts fine.
&gt;Warm it cranks slowly.  Summer, highway hot the starter won't crank at all.
&gt;Wait 15 minutes and she jumps right on.  
&gt;
&gt;The battery is good, I've replace the starter with a Bosch factory-rebuild,
&gt;replaced the starter switch.  Cables and grounds seem good.
&gt;
&gt;The VW dealer in Yakima (WA) says they know there's a &quot;hot start&quot; problem.
&gt;They'll add a Ford solenoid to the Bosch which is supposed to increase the
&gt;power somehow.  They'll do this for $150, I might add.  A VW mechanic here
&gt;(Ellensburg, WA) says he's heard of such, but thinks that there's an
&gt;inherent problem in that Bosch starter such that as the wiring gets old and
&gt;resistance increases, the Bosch won't hack it anymore.  He's the one, by the
&gt;way, who replaced the starter and advised me to replace the switch, all to
&gt;no avail.  
&gt;
&gt;I dunno.  It all sounds like so much double talk to me.  Never have heard of
&gt;such a thing.
&gt;
&gt;In any event, has anyone out there ever run into this problem?  Is it
&gt;discussed in the archives anywhere?  Would appreciate any kind words.

Thanks to all you out there who have put in an oar for me.  

The consensus seems to be that my mechanic does know what he's talking about
but wants too much money to put in the Ford solenoid.  John Muir's book on
keeping your volkswagen alive was suggested as a good source that deals
specifically with the problem.  So, I'll give it a try.  

Any ideas on a source for the Muir book?

Thanks again.

Charlie
