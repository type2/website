&gt;I and my trusty 87 vanagon have recently acquired a cold-oil warning
&gt;system that works as follows:   In weather colder than 45 deg, after van
&gt;sits more than 8-10 hours, get in, start, drive away.   After revs go
&gt;over 2500-3000 for a short period, combination low oil pressure and dive
&gt;warning horn comes on.   After the van is warm, warning light/horn never
&gt;comes on.  (the current solution is to idle the van until warm before
&gt;driving away). ...
&gt;...         So before I dig into things (and, yes, put a real pressure
&gt;gauge on it), does this fit any known problems?   Could a sticking
&gt;pressure relief valve behave this way?

don't forget that the 87's have TWO oil pressure sensors and one of them
is back by the oil filter/oil cooler ... and that oil cooler has the engine
coolant flowing through it. check the bentley book, but i think i recall that
particular sensor is the one that says the pressure is too high (or at least,
a very different range of pressures than the other one &lt;which is down between
the left side pushrod tubes&gt;).

what i think might be happening is that maybe you have a bad/sensitive sensor
and the cool coolant is keeping the oil cool, so the oil pressure gets kinda
high (when you rev up) and the sensor goes off.

you could check it out by (1) check the electrical connections to that sensor
and (2) disconnect that sensor and see if the led/horn comes on.

and speaking of this 'horn', what does it sound like? it's not the same gizmo
that makes the seat belt 'La Cucaracha' music, is it? cause i kinda like
dis-emboweled mine. :)  well, i'm SORRY, but i just couldn't take it any more
one day, and i disconnected that little speaker in the relay!
