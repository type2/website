Subject: Has heat, but it smells

Good subject title, heh?

I gots me a 84 vanagoner, and the auxiliary heat exhanger for the passenger 
compartment
(under the third seat) is cracked.  So when I blow anything (hot or cool 
air) through this, the
van fills up with antifreeze odors.  Unfortunately, when I use the heater 
for the front of the van
(for the DRIVER), it too smells up the van.

Baaaaaaaaad timing, dudes and dudettes, becuase temps in Minnesnowta are 
dropping
down to freezing this week, and I'm driving to northern Minnesnowta tonight 
for a three day
business trip.

I assume that Bentley will show me how to replace the aux. heater under the 
back seat, but
what's up with the heat for the front two seats (the heat coming out of the 
dash)?

Also, today I noticed the top ventilation control lever (for the windshield) 
does nothing, and
feels like it is attached to nothing.  Can anyone shed a little light on 
these for a still-Bentley-less,
slightly chilled list mate?

Finally, one for the archives: this afternoon I put out $360 for four new 
Michelin XZX (185R14) tires.  They
make a tremendous difference over the old 195R14's that were on (but in very 
poor condition).  I'll enjoy them on the road tonight.
