&gt; Folks,
&gt; 
&gt; Since someone else brought up the subject (even though it was 
&gt; originally on the newsgroup), I thought I'd add my question/
&gt; comment on the subject of door handles.  I found it annoying
&gt; when I got my bus that the side door cannot (apparently) be
&gt; unlocked without the key.
 
&lt;deleted&gt;

&gt; My problem now is that _I_ can't open the door from the
&gt; inside, with or without a key.  Anyone have an idea how
&gt; easy it might be to get a replacement door handle?
&gt; ..and while I'm at it, how easy is it to replace the
&gt; window crank (on the front door)?
&gt; 
&gt; I appreciate any help/advice/comments....

Well, if it makes you feel any better, mine will not unlock from
the inside either.  Even though it seems to have a little lever there
for it.  Taking that inner handle/latch assembly apart has been on my
long-term list of things to do for a while now.  

If you need a handle, I saw *two* at the junkyard last weekend, and this
after looking for them for months, and finally ending up buying one on the
net :/

If I remember, the front door window cranks are easy to replace.  just pru
up the plastic cover near the center and there is a phillips head bolt
underneath.  Couldn't be simpler!
