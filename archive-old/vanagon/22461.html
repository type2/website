Subject: SUMMARY: Wrong coolant type in 84 Vanagon (a bit long)


Hi everyone again,

I would like to thank Joel Walker, Wes Neuenschwander and Tim Smith
for their helpful information and advices regarding my coolant
question.  Since the replies were sent direct to me so I will include
them to share the info with the list.

The concensus is that the incorrect coolant type can cause damages but
the pump probably comes to its age naturally and by coincidence.  It 
does make sense to me as I really don't think the wrong coolant type 
can do such a damage in one month (approx. 3500km).

I talked to the service manager at VW dealer this afternoon.  He admits
the coolant ZVW237104 which he used last month is not for aluminum blocks
and the correct type for my 84 Vanagon should be ZVW237102 phosphate-free.
So he offers to refill the cooling system with the correct coolant, to 
replace the pump free-labor and I pay for pump, gaskets.  Well, it sounds 
too good and I happily accepted.

I appreciate very much the info and comments from Joel, Wes and Tim.

Have a good day everyone.

Regards,

Hong

P.S. Tim, the temp needle normally sits at 1/3 of the scale and never
     gets close to the LED light.  Now it reaches to the LED within 10 
     mins of running and moving slowly up to 3/4 of the scale.  In fact 
     I did not let it run for more than 15 mins afraid that something
     else might break down.

A month ago before taking the van for a 2 weeks vacation, I had a VW
dealer did a cooling system flush and add coolant.  Everything works
normal until last Sunday: The engine is overheated.  Today they checked
and said the water pump needs to be replaced.  The cost is $90 for the
pump, $183 for labor and $15 for coolant.  I left the van at the 
dealer and would let them know tomorrow.

I found out that the coolant they put in last month (ZVW237104, comes 
in 4L jug by VW) is not the correct type which is ZVW237102 (comes in 
1.5L bottle) and also they now know that too.

The question I have is:

    Can the wrong coolant type do any damages to the water pump and 
    other parts of the cooling system?  I do not know much about these
    2 types but would think the ZVW237102 is for aluminum block.  The
    cooling system seemed fine even before I had it changed.

the wrong coolant type CAN cause damage to water pumps (which need to have
certain lubricants in the coolant ... at least, that's what i was told), but
i don't think this was your problem. i use the large 4L bottled coolant in
my 88 bus and it's never had any problems like that. in fact, i've never even
seen the smaller bottles of coolant. is that something for the frozen north??
the stuff we have is Autobahn Anti-freeze/Summer Coolant Phosphate-Free in a
large white plastic 4L bottle with a blue label. costs about $13US per bottle.

anyway, it IS possible that the water pump was just on its last leg and died
a natural death. if both types of coolant are phosphate-free (and i think
that's all that vw has ... cause don't all the rabbits and golfs and such
also have aluminum heads???), then i don't think the water pump death was
caused by the coolant being different. but i could be wrong ... like i said,
i've never even seen or heard of the small bottle stuff.

The wrong coolant can definitely cause some serious havoc, but I'm not to 
sure it's your water pump that'll be effected.  It's well know that use of 
antifreeze solutions containing phosphates (which is the majority of them) 
will cause corrosion in aluminum, eg. aluminum engine blocks.  The most 
common result is the dreaded &quot;blown head gasket syndrome&quot; (progressive 
corrosion and seepage between the head gasket and head, culminating in a 
blown head gasket and warped/pitted heads).  But water pump, I don't know 
if that's got aluminum in it.  

In any case I just happen to have a jug of ZVW 237 104 sitting here in 
front of me (don't ask me why), and it says:  &quot;Phosphate Free Formula for 
Use in Volkswagon &amp; Audi Water Cooled Vehicles&quot; (it's also labelled as a a 
gallon container).  Got it from my VW dealer last year.  So my guess is, 
your dealer added the correct stuff, even though it had a different P/N.  
Still, the obvious thing to do is verify that the stuff they used is rated 
for your vehicle, and in particular is phosphate free.  Off-hand, I can't 
imagine a VW dealer even STOCKING a phosphate bearing antifreeze.. geez, 
talk about asking for trouble ;)

As for the water pump, well one possibility is coincidence.  How many 
miles might the thing have had on it.  They all crap out sooner or later.  
Another distinct possibility is that the flushing process may have 
dislodged corrosion products or other particles (I guess it's supposed 
to), which may have gotten forced into the water pump shaft seal or 
bearings.  I don't know about automotive water pumps, but this can 
definitely be a problem with industrial equipment.  The pump design 
generally tends to expel particles from the seal/bearing area when 
running, but if fluids are forced through, under pressure, with the pump 
idle, material can lodge in the seal (causing wear, and finally leakage 
into the bearing) or into the bearing directly, causing bearing failure.  

Anyhow, you've got a new water pump now.  One less thing to worry about 
for, oh, say 40K miles!

Yes it can, but two weeks is pretty fast unless the new (incorrect) coolant 
is really really corrosive. Doubtful. The new coolant may have cleared some 
crud that was keeping the leak under control however. More likely. I suspect 
your pump was on its last legs, did your van run with the temp needle much 
above the LED warning light? They seem to sit pretty steady right smack in 
the middle. You could replace the pump yourself, takes 3-4 hours, get new 
gaskets if they are not included, or use silicone sealant and wait 24 hrs 
for cure! $183 = 3hrs VW labour. About right.
        I would certainly demand that they put in the correct antifreeze, no 
excuses tolerated. In my case, I would do the pump, fill with regular water, 
drive to the dealer and let them drain and refill/bleed the system. Your 
cost $90 + time. The water pump on the 1.9 litre engines is awkward to get 
out, have a careful look before you go ahead. Check for alternate pump 
suppliers also, may drop price by half!   tim s.
