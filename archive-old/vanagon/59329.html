Subject: E-Mail Address Change - Please Note (Finally Tired of AOL BS)
From: busboys1_at_juno_dot_com (Bus Boys)
Date: Sat, 03 May 1997 22:37:59 EDT

To The Listees -

Sifting through both T2 and V_at_L list postings for information, enjoyment,
but most importantly customer inquiries has become rather cumbersome in
the past month, especially since the Website went on-line.  The AOL
Account we have has been experiencing sometimes intolerable delays in
sending and receiving (especially receiving - sometimes it has taken up
to 3 days to respond to  customer's direct inquiry) and is scheduled to
be shut down within this month.

To this end and as you can see by the new E-Mail address shown in the
signature, we ask that all listees making inquiries direct their mail to
the new address.  People with links to the AOL address should make note
of this as well and initiate the appropriate changes as well.  This
address will not be used for monitoring the lists however as I will be
using my personal E-Mail address (also with JUNO) to do that function. 
So we haven't left either of the lists, just trying to streamline the
operations here.

Consideration was made to go to Digest Mode on both lists, but due to the
varied subjects offered by the great people here, I have made a habit of
filing individual posts to an assortment of subject folders to refer back
for answers and information when I need it for the past 2 or more years. 
In fact I am keeping the AOL program on my PC because of the intricate
filing I've done in that program's filing cabinet and there's alot of
info there as well I would like to refer back to when I need it.

An important E-Mail note:  I check and answer all of the E-Mail directed
to Bus Boys here at home.  With the phone and general business load at
the office, I purposely do not have a PC down there to do the job,
because of time constraints.  So mail is checked in the very early AM and
very late PM to answer inquiries.

I've thought about routing all of our mail through the domain we have
now, but it would increase costs and besides, JUNO is free (can you blame
me?).  Your support has been great and I hope this change increases the
efficiency of our replies to all list members and customers.

Last note:  BusBoys_at_aol_dot_com address on our Website will be changing in
the next few days as I sort and sift thru all of the HTML texts and
upload it.  The AOL address will be functioning until at least through
the end of May.  Wish I could have gotten the BusBoys without the number
&quot;1&quot; next to it,  but looks like someone already got it - Oh well
 
Thanks
