Subject: Stolen Badge

1st. Apologies to all for the blank message I just accidently sent to the
list.

Sara (and the rest of the folk)  Be aware that a favorite tactic of the
theiving scum is to steal a radio or a car battery, or in your case, badge,
and then wait and watch to see when you have replaced it so that they can come
back and this time steal a NEW radio or battery or whatever!!
(Don't ask me how I learned this   :-(     ).

Harvey
