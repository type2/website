Subject: Re: terrorist van explained

I have an artsy friend that made a short film about me and my &quot;terrorist&quot; van.

I have these full body, all black Patagonia activist fleece tights with and
integrated balaclava (ninja-type hood) and openings for your fingers and
thumbs. When you put these things on, all you can see are your nose, eyes and
fingers.

Two of us were dressed up like this while driving around town.  We'd roll
around town screaming broken Israeli waving fake pistols at the camera.  Staked
out people's houses and kidnapped them.  The kids at the Krispy Kreme loved it.

It turned out better than you might think.  Last I heard, Redford was
considering if for Sundance.  Cannes is a bit reachy, though.
