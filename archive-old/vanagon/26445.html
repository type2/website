Subject: '73 Westy needs faucet repair

  The faucet on my '73 Westfalia started leaking at the
base of the spout.  It has been weakened over the years
by slamming the sink cover down on it.  The spout has
recently fallen out of the pump housing.
  Does anyone have any advice on repairing/replacing this
busted faucet?
 
TIA,
