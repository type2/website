Subject: Re: Do dealers know how to work on EVs


Can't vouch for ALL VW dealers...but mine does...

The 5cyl engine in the EV is a de-tuned version (higher torque/lower 
horsepower) of the bullet-proof Audi 5 cylinder engine found in the Audi 
4000 5+5 and the Audi 5000 from the mid to late 80s. I know of a bunch of 
them which have over 200k miles on them.
