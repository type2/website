Subject: Vanbondo wind and % of filler... (f)

Roy Nicholl made mention of &quot;not wanting to steal any wind from VanBondo...&quot;

Don't worry Roy, VanBondo has more wind than a family dinner table scene in
a Eddie Murphy movie.

Mr. Fitzpatrick then says to Roy,
&quot;Yours may be 25-30% filler, but mine is 50-70% RUST!&quot;
To which VanBondo replies, &quot;and mine is 90% complete!&quot; =))))
Just think, Mr. Hoover thinks I am ready for a Toyota! Naw, I'm ready for a
rest!

BTW: The impedius for the &quot;Rusty VanBondo&quot; name came from a rocker and
dog-leg rusted '57 single cab which has so much putty in it's rear fenders
that it sounds as solid as a NYC sidewalk in January. The single cab and I
are still full of it. (I think I missed a couple of letters...)  =)
