Subject: VW's and advertizing

Hey now,
        I was just thinking this morning about the recent Nissan Pathfinder
safari commercials. It seems to me that 15+ busses aging from 1 to 31 years
old making a &quot;safari&quot; might make quite a commercial for VWofA. Especially
since we're paying for this ourselves. Maybe VWofA should take note.
Probably not smart enough to figure that one out, but you never know.

Peace,
