  I think Europe got wasserboxers with carburetors, at least in the first 
  years. That might explain a feature on the case for a fuel pump.

&gt; Mine has it too.  ('84 westy).  It seems to me that that plate is the 
&gt; size and shape of the fuel pump hole on air-cooled VWs.  Does anyone know 
&gt; this for sure.
