Subject: Re: 009's from brazil

We install 009 dist in cars all the time, I've not found a bad one in 
quite sometime.  I sell and install a large amount of parts, some 
Brazilian and some German.  Yes there is a difference in the quality on 
some of these parts, but for the most part the Brazilan stuff seems to 
be holding up well.
