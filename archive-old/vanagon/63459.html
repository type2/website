Subject: Next CCC trip (8/15-8/17)

The next CCC camping trip will be to Historic Columbia on August 15th thru
the 17th.

Historic Columbia, California is located in the Sierra foothills off
highway 49 near the city of Sonora. This gold-rush town is preserved as it
was during the 1800's as a 'living' museum and state park. This is an
especially cool trip for kids. The commercial cave 'Moaning Caverns' is
also nearby. 

We'll be staying in the Marble Quarry RV Park, which is shady and is
located a short walk from town. This campground features electric and water
hookups, toilets, and showers for $22.50 / night. Their phone number is
209.532.9539. If you call, ask for a spot near 'Ron Lussier'. I was told
that if folks called soon, we could be all located in one circle.

On Saturday, Coyote will lead a trip to a nearby wild cave. If you wish to
attend Coyote's wild caving trip, you'll need a light source for every
person, and preferrably two. This means a flashlight and perhaps a 'glow
stick' or mini flash light. You'll also want to wear jeans, boots, and a
long-sleeved shirt. A fanny pack with water, snacks, and maybe a camera is
also useful. 

Special thanks to Mike Baumann for researching this trip!
