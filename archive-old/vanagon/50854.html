Subject: Side Window Needed

I shut my driver's door on my 83 Westy today and the side window shattered 
into a million pieces!  I have no idea as to why this happened.  All I know is 
I need a new side window.  It's the one behind the drivers seat.  If this was 
a regular Vanagon I could go to my junkyard and get one but it's one of those 
ones that slide and has the screen.  If someone has one to sell me, please let 
me know as I need it ASAP!

Thanks,
Bryan

Hey, how hard is this to replace?  Anyone have instructions?
