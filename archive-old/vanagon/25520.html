Subject: FREE VW Homepage Access Disk


I just received this little goodie in the mail...a IBM format Spry
Mosaic Internet Browser with a direct connect tothe VW Homepage and
7 hours of free access to the Homepage.

It came as part of my subscription to Volkswagen World, the VWUS
magazine one gets when one purchases a new VW. 

I think it may be possible to call VW directly and have one of the
disks sent to you. from either 1-800 DRIVE VW or 1 800 822 VWUS.
