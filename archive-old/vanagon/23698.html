&gt; A related question: why, in the owner's manual does it tell you that running
&gt; the vehicle with the alt. belt slipping or off will &quot;seriously damage the
&gt; vehicle&quot;? In Die Frau I know that belt's for cooling, but in the '79 and the
&gt; air-cooled Vanagon what function does it have besides powering the alternator?

Maybe that's just left over from the old days.  My fan belt broke a
couple of months ago when I was across town in my bus.  I just drove it
home.  I even had an extra belt under the seat, but no allen wrench to
loosen the adjusting bolt.  DOH!  That was one of those times when
owning a bus with a pancake motor was actually an advantage.
