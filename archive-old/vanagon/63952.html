Regarding Ron's comments about the so-called impled threat being actionable 
at law....sorry but its not any sort of threat, actionable or otherwise for 
one simple reason...the word &quot;IF&quot;... &quot;if it weren't so far away&quot; shows 
either impossibility or lack of ability on the author's part....it's 
effectively the same as my saying &quot;if I didn't own a Volkswagen, I'd grab a 
gun and kill my neighbors...&quot; obviously an impossibility on my part.
