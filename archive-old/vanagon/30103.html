&gt;Skis are problematic. The above-mentioned bicycle racks have attachments

I have just purchased a bike/ski rack from an outfit called Rack-N-Lock (800
725-6562) and their 2&quot; hitch assembly will carry three bikes but the optional
ski attachment mounts skis or snowboards at a 45 degree angle.  I haven't got it
all put together yet so I couldn't promise results but I'm hoping all that
careful measuring is going to pay off and work just fine.  I know for sure that
the rack will tilt far enough out of the way to let you open the hatch.

I can't imagine using this for kayaks though.
