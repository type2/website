  Thom and the list,

  You wrote
&quot;Why would I want a link to GEX from my page?  I thought their stuff
sucked?
At least I know people who told me their stuf sucked... &quot;

Their stuff better not suck! I just realized that they built the engine
in my Syncro I just bought!!! I wonder if they have any transferable
warranty!!!

I am going to e-mail them to  see what's up with this engine. We will
see what they have to say. The people who put the engine in said they
do good work. Has anyone else had any work done by them?
