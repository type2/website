&lt;&lt;I suggest checking the cleanliness/secureness of a few connections in 
the engine compartment.Two things can cause the light to flash:&gt;&gt;

Thank you, thank you.  I love this list.

We 'inherited' this van a few years back, and it is the only car that 
fits our family of seven, plus great dane.  We love it.

If it didn't flash at us we'd be even happier.

We'll pursue what you suggest.

Nancy
