Date: Tue, 21 Jan 1997 00:01:28 -0000

&gt; The bench front seat out of a 9 pass. relies on
&gt; the bulkhead as a support for the back. When you put the 9 pass. front
bench in
&gt; a 7 pass. van, the seatback has no support, and flops all the way back. 
Was
&gt; there a bench front seat made by VW with a seat back stop??
&gt; Has anyone tried this?
&gt; Would it be possible to weld on a seatback stop, like the ones that were
used on
&gt; the Golfs, Rabbits, and other 2 door - 4 seater cars?

I was in a car park and saw a 9 seater without the partition (is bulkhead
official?) but instead they had bolted a length of chromed pipe all the way
across the van. This pipe supported the front seat.
