Subject:       Subject: Re: coolant leak

&gt; 
&gt; after a drive there develops a puddle of coolant below the oil 
&gt; filter/oil cooler/water pump.  my pump was replaced by the dealer at 
&gt; 50,000 miles and appears not to leak.  Coolant leak can be traced back 
&gt; to the oil cooler housing.  Thats as far as i have investigated. there 
&gt; is however two coolant hoses that feed the cooler?  or the cooler could 
&gt; leak or the water pump.  Let me know what you find......
&gt; 
If you do find it's the oil cooler, they appear to be the same ones 
used on all turbo diesels, GTIs, GTX, etc, so they are quite easy to 
find used. (pressure test them before using of course, to avoid 
contaminating your engine/coolant) 
I have had contrasting stories on how long they last: one source says 
they never fail, another says they are a common weak link prone to 
failure... 
Go figure.
