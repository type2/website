Subject: Re: Cost of Eurovans?

I paid 18,100.00 + PA state tax (everything included) for mine.
It is considerably less loaded than Ric's.  It has the Dual
A/C, stereo, and the dual heaters, no power stuff, 5 spd tranny.

The dealer hated me for what I did to get that price.  We went and negotiated
on a 'virtual' car, i.e., I told them exactly what I wanted, they said they'd
look for it.  When they said they came up with one (it was sitting on
the docks in Maryland), I told them to write it up, the price breakdown,
the added nice little things like dealer prep, etc.., AND the VIN.  Then
I paid them the $100.00 deposit they asked for, once they gave me a complete
set of photocopies.  Then came my surprise: I told them that I could probably
get a better deal from the other VW dealer on the exact same car, and if I did,
they were welcome to keep the $100.00 deposit.  Sooo, they made sure I bought
the EV from them, by knocking an extra $1,000.00 or so from the price they gave
me...

I think the dealer sales person was really upset, and even my wife was very
upset with me, but I still do not think what I did was immmoral.  The trouble
is, most dealers are probably aware of this method...
