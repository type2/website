On the same thread.. I saw a Ford Ranger pickup that had painted on 
the tailgate...

F L O O R E D

in the same lettering style the original FORD big letters.  I thought 
that would be a great vanity plate for a Westy.

&gt; &gt; This reminds me of a older bus I saw (forgot if splittie or not) but it had
&gt; &gt; a sticker on this that said &quot;Too Slow?/Too bad&quot;  :)
&gt; &gt; I liked it.
&gt; 
&gt; At the Manassas VW show several weeks ago I bought 2 stickers:
&gt; 
&gt; For the rear bumper of my '76 Camper:
&gt; 
&gt;      PASS ME, MAKE YOUR DAY
&gt; 
&gt; And for above the passenger side window crank:

&gt;      DO NOT LOWER WINDOWS AT SPEEDS IN EXCESS OF 120 MPH

&gt; I've always wanted to get my own printed up:
