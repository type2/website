Subject: blinker bulbholder cover

Hi All --

The replacement signal light bulbholder has arrived and is ready for
installation. I am curious -- the bulbous black rubber &quot;bell&quot; which covers
the bulb and it's holder fits onto another piece of rubber. Do ya'll put
anything (goo of some type) in between the two rubber pieces so they keep
better contact and do a better job keeping water out? (I'm replacing this
bulbholder as the other one rusted away.)

Love, Lotus
