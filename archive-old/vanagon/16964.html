Subject: Repost: Head talk

&gt;After reading about all of these head problems I'd like to understand what 
actually 
&gt;happens (especially before it happens to my '87 Westy)! Can anyone tell me:
&gt;
&gt;What happens inside the engine? It sounds like liquid from the cooling 
system gets
&gt;into the combustion area of the engine. Is the failure always that the head 
warps
&gt;and disturbs the seal with the head gasket or are there other similar failures
&gt;with the same effect?
&gt;
&gt;Are the heads defective when they leave the factory and it just takes a 
certain amount
&gt;of mileage for the problem to appear?
&gt;
&gt;If they are defective from the beginning, is there anything you can do in 
terms of
&gt;maintenance or driving style to prevent the problem from showing itself or 
is it
&gt;pre-determined and just a matter of time (mileage)?
&gt;
&gt;Is there a way to detect in advance if the problem will happen? Maybe an 
oil analysis?
&gt;
&gt;If the problem occurs, what is the correct way to fix it? Do you have to 
get new
&gt;heads? Re-machine the old ones?
&gt;
&gt;After fixing it, what's to say that it won't happen again?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks for putting up with my mechanical ignorance! We're about to make a 
trip from
&gt;North Carolina to the Southwest for four weeks and I'm trying to get 
everything in order
&gt;but I feel pretty helpless about the head thing. Our '87 has 69k miles on it.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks in advance!
&gt;

are again.
