Subject: axle nut

In response to Tim Maddox's question on the size of the rear axle nut:

I think it is 46mm not 36mm. I bought a special tool called an axle nut 
wacker to remove this nut.  You can buy one for about $10 at your local 
aftermarket VW store.  The tool is made of cast iron and it slips around the 
axle nut( actually it was such a tight fit I had to use a hammer to get 
it on).  Then you attach your 1/2&quot; breaker bar to the tool and have your 
friend stand on the end of the breaker bar.  Meanwhile just hit the tool 
with a hammer a few times and viola off comes the nut!  I guess the combination 
of constant force applied to the tool with the breaker bar and the transient 
force of the hammer blows get the nut off.  If you just use a socket 
and a 1/2&quot; breaker bar there is a good chance you will break the breaker bar 
before you get the nut off (I did).  I've heard 3/4&quot; breaker bars work well
but they are expensive.

Good Luck
