So No Quarter says:
&gt; This all gets me to wondering though...on the VintageVW list, this same 
&gt; topic came up last year about water to help cool you down.  The typical 
&gt; threads about swamp coolers, rust factors, etc. soon ensued.  But I was 
&gt; wondering, couldn't a person get one of the humidifier devices that puts 
&gt; out a super-fine mist of cool water and run that?  Has anyone tried this 
&gt; in the &quot;drier&quot; areas of the U.S.?  Does it work?

Well... funny you should bring this up.  My wife (Linda) and I were just
in Walmart buying everything but what we came for.  We happened by a 
display which something similar to what you were describing except
that it wasn't actually for car use, but for like when you go walking
or whatever.  It was a bottle stuck in a bag that had a sprayer attached
and operated on batteries.  I though out loud that this was kinda stupid
as you only need to spray yourself a few times and be comfortable until
the water dried out.  I'd just as soon carry a spray bottle rather than
something that needs batteries replaced.   It just seemed like such a
waste..... IMO  :)
