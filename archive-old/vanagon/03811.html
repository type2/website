&gt;I decided to check to see if I was going into Limp Mode, so I disconnected
&gt;my coolant temp sensor.  There was no change, still had hesitation at
&gt;low rpms.

that would seem to tell me that the coolant temp sensor IS bad ... i.e.,
the computer can't tell the difference between the sensor hooked up (and
not working) and the sensor disconnected.

&gt;Then I reconnected the coolant sensor, and disconnected the O2 sensor.
&gt;Bingo!  Without the O2 sensor attached, I have lots of power at all rpms,
&gt;and no degradation when the car is warmed up.  On the downside, it seems
&gt;to my very subjective eye which is looking at the gas guage, that my
&gt;mpg has gone to hell.  Like, maybe I'm getting 15, but probably less.
&gt;Lots o power, though.

this is what the clowns at the local dealership kept telling me to do:
run without the o2 sensor hooked up. i didn't think it was a good idea.
so i just started swapping things on my own. i figured i could 'swap parts'
as well as they could, and save myself the labor charges.

hope it helps.
