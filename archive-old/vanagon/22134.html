Got a phone call a minute ago. My buddy Jim Kirk is towing a Vanagon back
from SC. The Vanagon has no motor and is on a trailer. Turns out this
trailer works fine for hauling Bugs. But not so fine for hauling Vanagons.
It fish tails bad. Cant go over 30 mph which is means it will take them
until next Christmas to make it back home.

When a trailer &quot;fish-tails&quot;, there is too much weight behind the axle on the
trailer. Your options are to pull the Van further forward, or somehow add
ballast to the front of the trailer and get some tongue weight. 60% of your
weight should be forward of the axle.
