&gt; Douglas said last Wednesday that, &quot;The 1500 T2 split from VIN #216000001 (August
&gt; '65), used a 30 PICT-1. It had an automatic choke though!&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; Well my first VW, a 1966 Panel in Germany in 1973, had a factory stock 12V
&gt; electrical system, along with a factory manual choke.  This bus had a paint job
&gt; like a mail truck (Bundespost) with no interior finish in the back, but it did
&gt; have the divider with window between the front and back, so you could try to
&gt; keep the heat in a smaller area in an attempt to get warm.  Even though the bus
&gt; was only 7 or so years old, it already was cancerous in the rocker panels and
&gt; even the back floor.  Since I was an ignorant high schooler, I had no idea that
&gt; what I was driving was unique in any way, so when the tranny finally gave up as
&gt; a result of my speed shifting, I bought a '66 bug for $100 and the bus went to
&gt; the junk yard.
&gt; 
&gt; This just shows that VW was very flexible back in the 60's as to what kind of
&gt; equipment could be installed for a particular application, making generalities
&gt; just that.

This type of thing occured to me the other day. I write from the US. My library has 
European and US versions of VW service and history.

There ARE many differences in US vs Eur models depending on year. As you note, your 
Germany domestic model had manual choke. If memory is correct, the automatic choke 
was introduced first to the US market.

My 61 T2 has control cables for both manual choke and fuel tank reserve tap. These 
features were not offered *stock* in the US for that madel year, according to the 
books I have.

The Info listed was from Bentley's US info. Sorry if this caused any confusion. I 
will reference the US or Eur stats in the furture. ;&gt;)
