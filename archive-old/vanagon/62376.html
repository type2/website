I second this, having similar problems with my 86GL, unplug the O2 lead and
see if it improves.

&gt; With the black plugs and smoking.... your checks don't seem to list the
O2 
&gt; sensor - had same symptoms when my first O2 sensor went bad - when I
unplugged 
&gt; the sensor (single wire) it ran much better until I could replace it.
Also 
&gt; check the throttle switch that tells the ECU to idle or not.

&gt; Hi Volks,
&gt; 
&gt; Yep, the dreaded rich running '86 is still pissed :-(  Still starting
hard,
&gt; won't take gas for about 15-20 secs after it starts, smokes a bit, gets
bad
&gt; mileage, poor power, plugs black.
&gt; 
&gt; I've followed everybody's suggestions, scoured the archives and tracked
Dan
&gt; Houg's footsteps, all to no avail. Here's everything I've done:
&gt; 
&gt; 1) checked and cleaned all the grounds
&gt; 2) checked the temp sensor (swapped with new to make sure)
&gt; 3) checked and cleaned the AFM (swapped with new to make sure)
&gt; 4) checked the ECU (swapped with new to make sure)
&gt; 5) checked all FI wiring
&gt; 6) checked for vacuum leaks
&gt; 7) checked fuel pressure
&gt; 
&gt; I'll be checking engine compression next to make sure. I may have forgot
to
&gt; list something ot another.
&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone have any other suggestions at all??
&gt; 
&gt; I am just about to give up on this van. And to think I sold my trusty
83.5
&gt; to &quot;upgrade&quot; to this!!!!
&gt; 
&gt; I hate to say this on the H2O list, but it makes me appreciate my '71
&gt; rustfalia. Even with a leaky and dirty carb and many years of neglect
&gt; continues to run...
&gt; 
&gt; Sorry for whining :-(
&gt; 
&gt; If VW still offered a new van, I'd be at the bank right now!
