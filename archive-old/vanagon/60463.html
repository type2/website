&gt;I bolted through a snow-melt swollen stream 2.5+ ft. deep (I waded it
&gt;twice and de-rocked my line) to find a Ford F-250 around the bend
&gt;stalled due to water in his motor. I asked the young bucks, cause I'm
&gt;37 now, if they needed any help but they just tried to look bored and
&gt;said &quot;Naw&quot;. 

&gt;Now I want a portable winch and air compressor to see how deep I can
&gt;REALLY go! 

For the curious, here's a d-camera photo taken at that crossing
Tuesday morning (the Westy in the photo is mine, not Jay's):

Jay and I don't know each other, it's just a coincidence that we were
both there on different days.  For me, it was a close one, as the
alternator light came on for a few seconds after charging through with
the tailpipe submerged.  Good thing that a local rancher warned me
about a deep hole on the upstream side of the crossing.  A decision
not to try to get across there would mean a 50+ mile detour around the
Manti-LaSal Mountains.
