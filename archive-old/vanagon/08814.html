Its an interesting problem of personal freedom vs. the common good.
I think I am a pretty tolerant person, but when I see somebody driving
around with the seatbelt dangling uselessly I make a snap judgement as to
the mental capacity of said driver. Why don't more people wear seatbelts,
dip their high beams, align their lights, move into the right lane, signal
before turning (not just during the turn) etc.?

Whew, I feel better now.
