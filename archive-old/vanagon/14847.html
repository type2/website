Subject: 71 Camper For Sale (Cleveland)

Hi all!

My buddy Michael Hoffman is selling his beloved 1971 camper.  He wants it
to go to a good and loving home.  Please don't email me about this, contact
him directly about at 216-729-1700.

The bus, a white, non-poptop camper, is located in Cleveland, Ohio.  It
does have some rust around the bottom, but it hasn't been driven in
Cleveland winters, so don't worry about it being a rust bucket.  Specifics:

-12k on it's rebuilt 1600 dual port.  The case was declared fit by a
machinist.  Rebuilt with all new innards, NEW crank, NEW *FORGED* pistons,
new rods, new heads, etc.  Non-stock items include extractor exhaust, 009
distributor, swivel feet valve adjusters, Bosch platinum plugs.  Very clean
engine.

-other new bits include new front tires (correct size and reinforced), new
shocks all around (KYB GR-2's in front, Gas-a-just in back), new ball
joints and aligned front end.

-All camper equimpent is complete!  Everything is there, including all
window screens and porta potty.

-Body is fairly straight, one minor ding on the driver's side at the
electrical plug in, and one on the front panel.

Price, $2200 or best offer.
