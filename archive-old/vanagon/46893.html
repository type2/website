I am not sure what the big deal is with these engines.  I rebuilt one with
nothing but Muir.  It was my first rebuild.  I did find it heavy and
cumbersome for one person to handle.  I did the rebuild over a couple of
weeks.  I stopped when I came to a problem, and asked around about the
problem.  I remember that setting end play gave me much concern.  I also had
a machine shop rebuild the heads, and turn the cam.  It may be difficult to
rebuild these engines, but no one told me, so I didn't know.  Dumb beginners
luck, I guess.

&gt;Hi,
&gt;	I am a newbie on this list, but have been a lurker on the other 
&gt;VW list for some time. I have just bought a '78 Westy, that beautiful 
&gt;green color, high mileage, but really good shape.
&gt;
&gt;	When I was having it checked out by the local VW shop, I was told 
&gt;that VW mechanics hate the '78's pancake engine. They told me that they 
&gt;would install a completely new engine when this one fails, but that they 
&gt;would NOT rebuild it. Is this the general opinion among VW folks? If so, 
&gt;why?
