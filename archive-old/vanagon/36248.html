&gt; Hi to all!
&gt;
&gt;(Got this message in another list)
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt;I have 2 BN2 Eberspacher gas heaters for sale. They came out of a '69 bug
&gt;&gt;and a '70 bug. I have cleaned up the cases, reset the gap on the fuel pumps,
&gt;&gt;and cleaned the glow plugs - they are in working order.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I am asking $75 US + shipping for each heater, or best offer.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Gas Heaters for sale
&gt;
&gt; The questions are:
&gt;
&gt; Could any of these heaters be used in a 1956 Kombi? Are they VW standard
&gt;for vehicles with factory gas heaters? Is this a good price? The local VW
&gt;dealer couldn't help me and neither did VWoA. Your help is appreciated. Thanks!

The price is excellent--I usually charge $125 for a BN 2, but it is not the
correct unit for your bus. The correct German heater is the early BN 4 with
the floatbowl fuel regulator (I have about 85% of one if anybody is
interested).  It is a larger unit with almost twice the heat output.

If you are not woried about authenticity, have converted to 12V, and do not
anticipate severe cold, the BN 2 will work just fine.
