Subject: My new '87 Syncro Westy...

Hello All,
		I just got back from a weekend spent working on my new aquisition.  I 
haven't yet gotten any info on the camping equipment or the Bentley manual so I have 
some questions if any of you have the answers. 
	My first problem deals with a small oil leak located around a plug like object 
on the pan of the engine directly below the oil filter. It is a (app.) one-inch circular 
recessed plug with a long narrow groove.  Is this an access plug to the oil chamber, an 
additional oil plug, or THE oil plug with the center bolt being another strainer?  Also, 
how do I stop the leak, how do I tighten it and should I be careful of the torque.
	This engine is greatly different than the air-cooled and other water-cooled 
engines I've worked on.  Without the manual I feel like I'm performing some kind of 
&quot;Alien Autopsy&quot;.....&quot;What the Hell is that flap of skin for?&quot;....
	My other problem is the leaking faucet.  The faucet is completely cracked 
between the mounting plate and the first threads of the bottom.  I may patch the crack, 
replace the faucet, or place a different sprayer and switch in it's place.  What do you 
suggest and what is the availability of the faucets?  (Any ideas of price?)
	Other than that my weekend was great: rewiring lights and the frig...I CAN&quot;T 
BELIEVE I GOT IT WORKING!!!, and cleaning and learning.  I can't wait until this weekend 
when I try out the propane.  This is a frightening prospect since I don't know what I'm 
doing yet....Any suggestions?????

	Thanks for all the input!  I'll keep the list posted on the progress of the 
beasts rebirth as a fully functioning member of Vanagon society.
