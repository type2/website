Subject: Re: Key Serial #'s

&gt;Looking at a breadloaf-era lock cylinder I have , I just noticed there is a
&gt;number stamped in the side.  This number is 35R052.  Is this the correct
&gt;format for a key serial number?  I know VW can make keys based on the
&gt;number, if you have it, but always wondered how you got it.  Also, can the
&gt;lock be re-keyed to another serial number? (boy, would a yes to this
&gt;question make my life easier)

        Yes. I don't know about the key serial #, but I do know that your
locks can be rekeyed. Any full service locksmith can do the job. I paid
about $15 per cylinder on my bus, and I didn't take time to shop around,
you might find costs as low as $10 or less. I had 4 keys for my bus at
first, as each cylinder wears out I have the replacement rekeyed. At this
point I need only rekey my ignition to have a 1 key bus again-hooray!!
After I get the bus all on one key I'll probably have the bug locks
modified, so that I can have one key for both cars-wouldn't that be nice?
;-)

Peace,
