Subject: Re: &quot;EV&quot; Panel Van Sighting???

&quot;EV&quot; panel van with &quot;Autohaus&quot; graphics drove by.
&gt;Just another remnant of late '60s ingestions or are the &quot;truck&quot; versions
&gt;sold in Canada?

snip!

i see euro panels quite frequently in toronto, are they rare or sumthin'???

downtown fine cars (audi porsche vw dealer) even have a parts chaser (ev
panel) that i see driving around quite a bit.

never thought of ev panels as being that odd a commodity, now a ev single
cab is a bit of a different puppy!
