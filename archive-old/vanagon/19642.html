Subject:      Can I use a three prong flasher relay?



My 69 has a four prong flasher relay that I just burned out trying to hook up
some new gauges. The 68-70 used the four prong box then in 71 the more common
three prong flasher relay was used. This is easier to find and cheaper. I am
thinking I once saw a three prong used in a 68 in place of the four prong.
Although there are four wires leading to the flasher I only actually use three
of the prongs. So what say? And how would I figure which wires went to which
prongs?

Thanks,

Tim---69Campmobile
