Subject: RE: Rusting seams and other hard to fix rust problems.


&gt; I am assessing the future of the bus, and want to know what to think of
&gt; emerging rust along seam, driver side.  This is the seam that joins the
&gt; panels holding the middle and rear windows.  Rust discoloration is 
starting
&gt; to show up about two thirds of the way up, and a bubbling rust spot the 
size
&gt; of a dime has emerged about a foot up the bus.

Here's an old Indian trick that'll stop rust cold. It won't actually
get rid of the rust that's already there, but it will keep your bus from
getting any rustier:

Next time you change your oil, save a little of the new stuff and get
a very small artist's brush. Daub oil directly onto the rust wherever
you see it, especially in seams as you describe. let it flow into the
seam. This is messy-- you'll wind up with oil streaks all over your bus.
Wipe up the excess, and let it sit for a few days, then wash. Your bus
will no longer be oil-streaked, but the rust will be stopped cold for
4-6 months. The oil gradually wears off, so you'll have to re-do this
after that time. But it won't get any rustier!

The oil locks out both water and air. It works, it's cheap, less filling,
tastes great.
