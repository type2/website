Subject: Re: Front door speakers - Westy vs. Pass van?

&gt; &gt; I test drove a '91 Westy last week, and it had the speakers you describe.
&gt; &gt; Oh yeah, the '91 Westy is a GL model and it is at Kelly Motors for the low
&gt; &gt; low price of $16995 and they did not seem too interested in budging, least
&gt; &gt; not for me.
&gt; Oh yeah, I live in Columbus, Ohio.  the dealer is Kelly Motors
&gt; (614)471-2277.  If you want to obscene phone call the evil dealer.
&gt; This dealer is a Mazda dealer.  On top of asking (demanding?) about
&gt; $3500-6000 over book, they offered me about $2500 under book for my
&gt; Protege.  In consoling me they said that the Mazda's don't hold value like
&gt; the Vanagons.  Odd thing for a mazda dealer to day, I thought.

Yeh, right. Have your wife try to trade in a Vanagon for a new Mazda, 
and see how quickly that line changes...
ALL car dealers are scum. Period.

ps: Thanks for the door panel info. It seems most of the wires need 
replacing. Anyone noticed how VW wiring seems to corrode even inside 
the insulation? I cut the wires back 6&quot; and the copper was still 
blackened and wouldn't solder worth a damn. Is there a better way to 
do this other than soldering - I hate to use cheap crimp on splices.
