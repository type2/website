Subject:       Re: Crazy Winnebago/Eurovan Motorhome.

&gt;  Someone who drives a '73 bus thinks something ELSE is underpowered?  has 
&gt; little interior space?  I checked one out.  I'm probably gonna buy one in 
&gt; a year or so.  Okay so I might wait until the V6 engine is in it.  BUT 
&gt; according to a guy who works at a VW dealer in Penn.  the Rialta IS NOT 
&gt; stock VW.  THe VW dealers can't work on them because Winnebago fiddles 
&gt; with them a bunch.  They even supposedly have a turbo version.  As happy 
&gt; as I am with the Eurovan and it PLENTY powerful engine I'm not too 
&gt; worried about the power.  The EV power is pretty good at the low end but 
&gt; for a vehicle its size it is almost AMAZING at the high end - its the 
&gt; transmission not the engine that could lead one to think there is a lack 
&gt; of power.

I wouldn't even consider a motorhome with the EuroVan engine unless 
they squoze a VR6 in there.  110 hp (or whatever the EV has) is not 
near enough to drive a motorhome in the mountains!  (Speaking from a 
Rocky Mountain dwellers point of view. &lt;grin&gt;)

Maybe the Turbo version has big four foot &quot;T-U-R-B-O&quot; Graphics down 
the side!?  :)  Turbo motorhome...  sounds almost as silly as Turbo 
bus!
