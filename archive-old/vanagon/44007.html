Subject: Re: Mystery wire on '73 ignition switch

&gt;Does anyone out there know where the brown/blue wire from the ignition
&gt;switch plugs up?  Can someone go out and have a look?  It does not show up

Steve,

Here's a great post on this from Pat Walsh that I saved.  It appears the
brown/blue wire is the door buzzer.  Thank Pat for the great details!

Below is the ignition switch wiring chart from MY '71 Westy.  The switch is
a replacement from RMMW, but the wires all matched colors with the
exceptions noted below.  I can't swear that the PO didn't change any wiring,
but it all LOOKS original, with the possible exception of maybe the black
wire going to the light switch.  BUT, it DOES all work, including the coil
getting 12V in the start position.  :-)

   WIRE                  FROM/TO                         DESCRIPTION
--------             ----------------               -------------------

Red/Black            from switch to starter         12V when in &quot;START&quot; position
Black                from switch to fuse box and
                     ignition coil                  12V when in &quot;ON&quot; and
                                                    &quot;START&quot; position
Black/Yellow(1)      from switch to light switch    12V only in &quot;ON&quot; (not
                                                    &quot;ON&quot; &amp; &quot;START&quot;)?
Red                  from battery to switch         12V at all times (straight
                                                    from battery)
Brown/Blue(2)        door buzzer                    connected to GND when key
                                                    is in ignition
Blue/gray            not used

1.  Connecting wire is Black, not Red/Black as shown in book.
2.  This wire is shown as Brown in book.  Also, the connecting wire is
    White/Black, not Brown as shown in book.
