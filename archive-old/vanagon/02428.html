Paul's statements might be true regarding the US market and Westies...
and his sales person probably doesn't know his ass from a hole in the
ground about European models (hell....he was probably selling washing
machines last year..), buy I have in front of me the latest EV
catalogues from the Fatherland...and lo and behold...Westphalia versions..

It is entirely possible that in the long run it is cheaper for VW to
have Winny subcontract the camperversions here than to have Westy
build them there....

Also there are many versions of the westy...not only the usuall
pop up top varieties...but some with high roofs and permanent
things like bunks and cabinets up on the &quot;second floor&quot;..
