&gt; It looks like my '76 Westfalia is going to need to have the engine rebuilt.
&gt;  Does anyone know if it's worth having hydrolic(sp?) valve lifters
&gt; installed.  It costs more, but does it make the engine last longer, require
&gt; less maintanence or anything like that?  Or should I just go with the
&gt; original specs.   Are there any other modifications I can do at this tme to
&gt; make a better engine?   

I remember hearing that the hydraulic valve lifters require a different
camshaft.  A mechanic told me that the cam profile is less aggressive than
the one used in the solid lifter engines, and that you might lose a few
horsepower.  No big deal, IMO, as the advantages more than make up for this.
