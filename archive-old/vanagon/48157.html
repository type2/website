Subject: Ignition/Starter Switch R&amp;R

In answer to my own question - to replace the ignition switch you 
must first remove the steering lock housing  (miss noted in the
Bentely as the steering column lock), then the ignition switch 
can be removed by unscrewing the phillips head screw that secures
it to the steering lock housing.  About a 30  minute job.
