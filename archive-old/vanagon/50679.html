 Bryan,
 
 Get yourself some case-savers for a T1 upright motor. see what threads they 
 are, they come in both metric and American threads, drill and tap the holes
 in the head for the case savers, install them with a stud with two nuts or
 a bolt, use the strongest loctite you van find. You'll end up with a proper,

 long lasting repair, you can screw the stock VW 8mm studs into the case 
 savers.

The outside diameter of the case savers is larger than that of a Heli-Coil.
 There is not that much extra room.  I recomend and have used the Heli-coil.
 Also, the Heli-coil is stainless steel and will not be affected by the heat
in that area.
