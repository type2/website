Boy, here I am replying to my own message concerning vacuum grease.

I just realized a potential source for vacuum grease.  Since many of 
you out there are school related, check out your chemical labs.  This 
stuff is also used in chem labs for when they seal things in vacuum 
chambers.  If the school has a vacuum furnace as part of an 
engineering or manufacturing area, check with them too.  Furnaces are 
also found in a materials lab.

Some of the references I found on the 'net were for school supplies 
for some lab course, check with wherever one gets lab supplies.

You don't need a lot, a finger full is enough for an entire engine's 
worth of hoses and fittings.  You might be able to talk someone into 
letting you stick your finger the jar and get enough.  It's about the 
consistency of thick vaseline.

They also make a spray version of this stuff, which would be nice to 
spray into the suspect areas.  But, if you use it, be judicious in it's 
application.  The overspray stuff is a mess to clean up.
