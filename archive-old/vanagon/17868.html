Subject: Re: Thoughts on sliding door noise

&gt;
&gt;While I was opening the sliding door on my vanagon last night its suddenly
&gt;occurred to me that the majority of the noise was eminating from the track
&gt;cover that runs along the outside of the van. It seems to act as a
&gt;sounding board. I wonder if some of that sound deadening material (so
&gt;shamelessly promoted on this list by Joel), applied to the inside of this
&gt;cover would quieten the door a bit?
&gt;


Great idea! That area also rusts a bit. Try ruberized underbody coating for 
sound deadening, just mask off what you don't want coated ie. your face, 
hair and misc. paintwork and bolt holes. must try this. I did really clean 
out the lower track last weekend, Gunk + rags + fresh film of Rustcheck. 
Rolls much more quietly, maybe it will stay clean for a week! tim s.
