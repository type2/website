Subject:      traction? we donn need no stinkin traction ...

andy wanted to know if anyone else had experienced lack-o-traction in the
later model buses. me.  my 88 spins the tires much more easily that the
old 80 model bus ever did. with the same tires.

i figure it's something to do with the steep torque curve of the 'new' engine
and maybe the fuel injection ... anyway, it's like the power comes on too
quickly. i could go all over the woods in my 80 model (not as many places
as the old 71 bus ... cause the 80 doesn't have the ground clearance) and
never ever got stuck.

the 86 and the 88, however, would spin tires even on just wet grass. and in
the once-ever-five-years snowfall we get here,  it's just not a good idea
to ever stop moving. that seems to be the key: stopping deal still. as long
as you can keep moving, it seems to be ok. but if you ever stop, it'll spin.

anybody else?
joel
