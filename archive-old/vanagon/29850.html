Subject: RE: 1986+ Vanagon Dynamic Oil System???

Jim,

Here's my interpretation of the Vanagon dynamic oil pressure warning
system based on the Bently Manual for the '85 to '92 Golf/Jetta
and the pressure set points of the Vanagon oil pressure switches.

&gt;What conditions make the oil light be off?
&gt;From idle to 2000 rpm - oil pressure above 0.3 bar
Above 2000 rpm - oil pressure above 0.9 bar.

&gt;What conditions make the oil light come on steady?
This condition never occurs.  The indicator only flashes.

&gt;What conditions make the oil light come on blinking?
Oil pressure below 0.3 bar between idle and 2000 rpm
and oil pressure below 0.9 bar above 2000 rpm.
 
&gt;What conditions make the buzzer light come on?
When oil pressure is below 0.9 bar and engine above 2000 rpm
