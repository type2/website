&gt;My friend is talking with a dealer in the SF Bay area about a '89 Westy. 
&gt;The van has about 70K miles and is imaculate - Power steering, brakes, 
&gt;Air &lt;needs service - no cooling&gt;, automatic, but otherwise seems a very 
&gt;nice van. They are sticking with a price of $17.1K and are quoting a 
&gt;&quot;Blue Book&quot; of nearly $21.
&gt;What say you all - They have refused $16K saying they paid more &lt;doubt 
&gt;it, but maybe&gt;.

That seems to be *very* expensive. There are many &quot;blue books.&quot; The
dealers quote different ones depending on whether they are buying or
selling. Go to your local library and check out a pro-consumer &quot;blue
books,&quot; Edmunds or other. My November '94 &quot;NADA official used car guide
(retail consumer edition)&quot; (that's from the dealer association!) quotes
$11,675 for low retail and $15,775 for high retail for the '89 Westy as
described above. Off the cuff, I'd say you should be able to find a
similar van for $10,000 -12,000 from private. Don't buy from a dealer,
especially if you know your way around cars.
