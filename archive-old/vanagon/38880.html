So James Cook says:
&gt; Question is, is it worth it? I'm wondering how much more expense I might 
&gt; expect to see go out if the engine and water pump are replaced? Surely 
&gt; $5,000 is less than a new or newish second hand one. But then I hate to 
&gt; throw good money after bad. And I wonder how bad it might be according to 
&gt; others with vans of this vintage and condition?

First of all James, sorry about your mishap with the engine and all.  

I think your decision really depends on how much you want to keep and use
the van.  If you think you'll use it for another 5 - 10 years, then I'd
say it's worth it to get the engine re-done as well as anything else
that is suspect.  150K + miles is a pretty respectable amount of miles
for a vanagon.  At least if you have all this stuff replaced, you know
what condition your van is in.  

If you don't plan to keep it that long, then I'd just sell it as is.
No use throwing money at it if you're going to sell.

If you go for the rebuild etc. then be sure to get a good warranty on
the work.  Make sure they do a good job on the coolant hoses and connections.

Good Luck,
