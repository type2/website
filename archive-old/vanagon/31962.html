Subject: Re: Syncro Clutch Remove Trans Not Motor

I can remove a synchro trans in about 3 hours doing it right. I've done
standard 4 speeds in 45 minutes with a little help. This eliminates the mess
involved in draining the cooling system also.  The skid polates have to be
removed anyway.  I've done enough engines and trans to know removing the
trans is easier.  Helpfull hint!!  Fabricate a support bar to go across the
engine compartment opening. Use a threaded hook to hang the engine from the
bar.  Hok should be long enough to let front of engine drop 4 inches.  Remove
everthing from trans, let from slope down, and trans will come out.  The bar
will support the engine so that vehicle can be moved until trans is put back
in.
