Subject: Early Bus Door Window Frame Resto

Hody,

	I started the resto on the front door window frames tonight.  Made
out OK, only 3 wounds - 1/8&quot; drill bit 1/4&quot; into my finger, which doesn't
hurt, which kind worries me, same drill bit, across another finger for a
1/2&quot; gash,  and then a screwdriver into that same finger.  This the same
hand I cut part of 3 fingers off, and then a few years later broke the 
thumb trying to lower the 911.   Life has not been good to my left hand...

	Please note that this is a major project, not to be attempted in
the parking lot of your FLAPS.  Plan on going without windows for at least
a day, minumum, if you have to paint at all.  Prolly longer, like in my
case, but I have an extra set to use in the meantime :)

	The rubber is available from West Coast Metric or Wolfsburg West,
and runs $150 to do both doors, including the piece around the door frame.
The one piece thats is not in the kit (why I don't know) is the piece for
the wing/vent window.  Duh...

	Anyway, here's the rundown so far:

	Removed the windows months ago, but thats is accomplished by removing
the plastic covers (4) over the screw holes in the front and rear of the
door, in the jamb area.  Remove the 4 big phillips screws.  Remove the
door panel,  and remove the 2 bolts above the door handle that hold the
frame from the side, and last, but not least, remove the 2 10mm nuts from
_inside_ the door that hold the frame down.  Feel for them, they're there.
Honest!

	Once you have your frame out, sit down somewhere comfy, and
where you won't hurt the window if you drop it.  You'll need a medium 
philly scredriver, a smallish flathead, wd-40/liquid wrench, power drill
with 1/8&quot; bit (watch those fingers!), exacto knife (watch those fingers!)
and patience.

	To disassemble the window frame, first locate the 4 small screws
on the middle support and rear support.  These are a pain to get out, but to
get the glass out, you must perservere.  Don't drill a hole in your finger
like I did,tho.   Taking these screws out will let you take the
sliding and stationary glass out.

	Also take out the scres that runn along the sliding glass.  This
is prolly best done once you have the sliding and stationary glass out.

	To get the wing window out, undo the locking tab and remove the
nut from the spindle, and make sure to keep the spring and washers  in
a safe place.  Take the drill and drill out the rivet in the top part of
the frame.  Now lift the rubber out enuf so you can move the frame, and with
a screwdriver, align the washers that are &quot;trapped&quot; in the frame so you can 
slide the wing window out.  

	To remove the wing window from the frame, use the exact knife to
cut back under the glass and slide some of the rubber away.  Once thats
done, use a scredriver on the end of the frame, and GENTLY pry upward, in
the same plane as the glass.  Alternate top and bottom.  When it gets
free a little, cut some more of the rubber.  Another note - the little
swoopy piece that goes on the bottom front of the wing window is a separate
piece that get imprisoned under the rubber.  I have no idea what its 
function is, but I'm thinking about painting it a contrasting color just
for the halibut...

	Use the same trick to remove the rails from the sliding glass and
the stationary glass.

	I ya wanna be anal, you can drill out the rivets for the wing window
latch and keeper, and send down to be chromed.  It doesn't make any sense
to paint them, cause it'll get ground up the first time you latch the
window.... I'm just gonna mask mine off, after cleaning it up a bit.

	Thats where I stopped.  I still have to disassemble the other window,
and then de-rust and paint them.  Then re-assemble.  I wanted to post
this while I had it all fresh in my mind...

Bleedingly yours,

Thom
