Subject: Re: Generic graphic-was Re: bumper sticker - tenative list

Did anyone realize that there are 5 generations (that is, if you consider the 
Eurovans, [a.k.a. T4] and barndoors [pre '55 Splitties])?  We have photos of 
all five generations together that we took at the last Bad Camberg meet in '91.

&gt;I think a good graphic to represent all 4 generations of buses would be,
&gt;literally, a loaf of bread on wheels.  The bread loaf shape is the common
&gt;thread...the graphic could be a bagged or unbagged loaf with little wheels
&gt;sprouting from the corners...
&gt;
&gt;whaddaya think

Go for it!  ...but whole wheat or white=BF=BF=BF
