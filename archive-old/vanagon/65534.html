Subject:      Pre-Assistance

I think it would be a good idea if list members submitted their names to a &quot;traveler's assistance&quot; list.
For example I would be willing to point the way (for a fellow list member who was traveling in the DC
area and had problem)  to a mechanic for repairs.  Now I know it's pretty easy to look in the phone
book but I've had some experience here.  I am not good mechanically so I would not be able to help
inthe repairs.  But if it was Sunday night I would be willing to provide a port in the storm, a shoulder
to complain to, a place to have a beer.  I would keep a hard copy of this list in my van.
