&gt; &gt; Why not buy a decent Thule or Yakima and mount it vertically on the 
&gt; &gt;  back?? I have seen alot of people do this.  Then you can take advantage 
&gt; &gt;  of all of the other attachments for those racks....
&gt; 
&gt; You say that like you can just look up &quot;Vanagon rear hatch&quot; in the Thule or
&gt; Yakima book and buy one.  Not the case.  Any solution like this is going to
&gt; require a bit of thought and work on the owner's part.  I've got a bunch of
&gt; Thule racks and parts &amp; I've toyed around with this idea for some time and
&gt; haven't come up with a solution I like yet.  Mounting the main rails side to
&gt; side is a problem because the rack would tend to slide down and the sides of
&gt; the top of the hatch are not parallel.  Mounting top-to-bottom baiscally

I have mounted a Yakima side to side using the towers that have about 5
squre inches of foam rubber that is clamped to the surface of the hatch.
The Yakima will also compensate for the non-parrallel upper portion
because it's mounting towers swivel 360 deg.  I am not familiar with
Thule, I personally never liked them because their bars are square, so
with an arching roof all the angles get messed up, as opposed to Yakimas
round bars which let you adjust the components to fit the bend of the
roof.  Thules fairing is also a very poor design.

&gt; hangs all the weight on the top of the hatch through 1 pair of mounts - a
&gt; condition these mounts were not designed for.  More elaborate means can be
&gt; used for mounting, but this requires cutting and bending of the bars, etc...
&gt; 
&gt; Do you have any specific solutions to suggest on how to accomplist this
&gt; &quot;Thule-or-Yakima-on-the-rear-hatch&quot;  thing?
