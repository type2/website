&gt;I wanted to thank everyone for your help on my leaking heads problem.
&gt;
&gt;One of you guys made me think about the future of my relationship with my 
&gt;Vanagon.  It has 140K mi and the heads are beginning to leak.  The VW dealer

&gt;is telling me $850 to replace both of the heads but I'm wondering if 
&gt;getting a rebuilt engine is a better way to go.  Also, two other things:
&gt;1-How much will I be looking at for a rebuilt wasserboxer?
&gt;2-Any reputable VW mechanics in the Capital District area (Albany,NY)?
&gt;
&gt;Thanx again,

Nate,
I suppose the $850 might cover the parts, but a two head replacement at a VW
dealer runs $2,000-$2,300 including parts &amp; labor.
A rebuilt wasserboxer from VW runs $2,380, for the part with exchange.  I'd
figure about $4,000-$4,200 total including labor.  The VW rebuilt has a 1
year warranty good at any VW dealer.

I recently replace the engine in my 87 with a low mileage used engine for
$2,600. including lots of new hoses &amp; motor mounts.  I did the job myself.
