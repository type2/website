Subject:      well ... shooot!

i just managed to wipe out the messages that i had saved from the list to
respond to ... so i'm gonna have to wing it from faded memories:

71 bus with bad idle:
  check the idle cutoff valve (which you said was getting juice). these
things will loosen in their hole and allow air to get in that way. it
should NOT wiggle ... if it does, that might be part or all of your problem
... tighten it up (maybe some lock-tight ... my old 71 used to loosen up
rather regular).

songs:
old lamplighter? wow!!! another kindred spirit of similar antiquity!!! :)
and no thanks to you, i was reminded of Arthur Godfrey (whom i detested). :(
bleah. i had forgotten ALL about him and Julius Larossa (?) and some of those
other 'regulars'.  now i'll have to go back into therapy again.

Hot Rod Lincoln: early chuck berry stuff.

big booper, buddy holley, etc. &amp; plane crash: yeah, i know that! but do you
know WHO was the fourth member of the tour that lost the coin toss and did
NOT ride the plane to his death? and doesn't talk about it at all?? hmmmm? :)
and besides, W.A.Mozart has been dead for a long long time, and i still like
to listen to his stuff. :)

canvas replacement for camper: i have a copy of the article from HOT VWs about
that subject ... it's not about vanagons, but it might be useful. whovever
wanted that (barry?), let me know and i'll zip it to you next week.

well ... that's all i can remember. :(  seems like there were a couple of
other choice things i was gonna say, but i guess most of you will be grateful
that i can't think of them right now. :)
