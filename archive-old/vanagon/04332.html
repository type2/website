Subject: Re: All those needing stove flue caps...

&gt;I called Pete at Euro-American RV Products (you may know them as Delta-Six
&gt;Industries- but this is the retail wing). The stove flue cap was $6.50. The
&gt;lowest he can charge (UPS set) shipping is $5.50 but this is still cheaper
&gt;than VW. He has anything that is part of the normal camper package. BTW, the
&gt;part number for the flue cap is 253 070 688A. For those of you not living in
&gt;the US, I'm not sure what shipping is. The phone number is (818) 760-4214 and
&gt;FAX is (818) 760-4216. I also ordered a new gasket for my skylight, and a new
&gt;set of doors for the water and electricity hookups. BTW, has anyone figured
&gt;out how to wire up another light such as that in front of the closet door?
&gt;Pete has them for 29.25 and it would be nice to have one for the cargo area.

Barry, do you have a mailing address for E-A RV Products?  Also, what did
they charge for the hookup doors?  These are the ones on the outside of the
van which open upwards, right?
