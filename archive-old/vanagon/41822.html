'84 Vanagon GL  Digijet -- ongoing rich running problem.

I have suspicions about the O2 circuit.  Not the O2 sensor, however.  I
would like a measurement from someone with a Digijet system. This
measurement is not in Bentley.  
Procedure:
 With everything else connected and the ignition off disconnect the O2 
    sensor wire.  
 Connect the Digital Voltmeter up to the ECU O2 wire (not the O2 sensor
    wire) in resistance mode.  
Check:  I would like to know what resistance you get on this. 

Also, the Bentley describes a procedure to check the Hall control unit.
  On the bottom left of 28.37 it says that if you connect the mulitmeter
to the outer terminals of the Hall generator connector and turn the
ignition ON, it should read 5 volts (min.)

  Mine reads 11 volts. Is this a problem? I don't appear to be
seeing any other signs of ignition problems.
 
I've swapped the Hall Control unit.

Thanks!
