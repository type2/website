Subject: 89 Westfalia for sale

Local fishwrap has had this van in it for the past week. Since this is the
2nd or 3rd printing, I presume it hasn't sold yet. The details are:

1989 VW Westfalia great shape, 61K mi. Grey w/grey interior. $14,700.
206-842-7967.

That's all I know about it. But 842 is the Bainbridge Island exchange, so I
could probably be persuaded to take an initial look at it. I have seen a
couple of nice grey ones on the island, but there are so many of the damn
things around here its hard to say which it might be.
