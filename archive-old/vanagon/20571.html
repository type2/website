I don't know how similar the Vanagon's odometer is to the Rabbit but the same
thing happened to my Rabbit at about 150,000 miles.  A plastic gear in the
speedometer housing cracked in half and started to slip on its axle.  I
wrapped some wire around both sides of the gear and tightened it until it
didn't slip.  I haven't had trouble with it since.  BTW the Rabbit now has
270,000.
