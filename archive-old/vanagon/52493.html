Help!
My odometor stop working, so I followed the advice given by list member for
removal.  The gears were not broken, but just out of place.  I pushed the
assembly to the right and gears were engaging just fine.  Put everything
back together and it worked great for about two days, but now we are back to
the same old thing.  What more do I need to do?

Best,

Bill Lund
