Justin;
My 86 got stuck in third also. I replaced the synchronizer 3rd/4th gear
assembly  (page.35.50) myself. Not easy but can be done. Needs some
special tools which I borrowd from the dealer. Parts about $200.
Good Luck

&gt;&gt; I'm going to look at an 82 diesel this weekend. It has a new engine
and
&gt;&gt; the trans is stuck in 4th gear. Is anyone willing to take a guess what
&gt;&gt; the problem is? The guy wants $800 for it. It sounds worth it. Should
I
&gt;&gt; go for it?

&gt;The PO of my 86GL had the trans stuck in 3rd.  Sent it to the shop 
&gt;where
&gt;they rebuilt the trans, replacing 3rd &amp; 4th.  Cost just under $1K.   
&gt;
&gt;Think about it.
