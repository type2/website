Hi Martin,
        Well I see various T4s around with Devon Conversion badges
stuck on the back. In fact the uni here has got one. Its not a camper
conversion though; its been converted as a minbus with sliding seat
rails, wheelchair facilities and possibly twin sliding doors. (It
was a bit hard to check due to where it was parked).

I've also seen a number of T4 panel vans around with the Devon
badge on the back!

cheers
