&gt; 
&gt; After paying little attention to the hi-idle threads, now I'm plagued...
&gt; 85 Digijet idles fine until engine is completely warmed up, then it surges
&gt; and drops in a wavelike fashion.  I noticed that it continues to do so while
&gt; coasting, and recall someone suggesting that the injectors are supposed to
&gt; shut down completely when coasting?
&gt; Could someone please suggest the sequence of fuel system checks that might
&gt; lead to a solution?
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Jim

Jim,

I,m currently working on a similar problem...I have an '85 Westfalia 
w/ auto trans and I've noticed that while driving over 35 mph the 
engine speed doesn't drop more than a few hundred rpm when I take my 
foot off of the gas. I presume that it should drop down to near idle 
rpm.

I've gone through part of the Bentley troubleshooting scheme by:

1)	setting the idle contact gap to between .002-.004&quot; with an ohmeter 
on the contacts of the connector

2) checked for 5V at the same connector(with the ignition on)

3) this step (which I haven't done yet) is to short the connector with 
the engine idling and slowly increase the engine speed to see if the 
engine surges.

If all these are ok then the fault lies in the ECU.

By the way, I've checked the injectors and they don't leak.
