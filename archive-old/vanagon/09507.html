lee:

whoa, that somes like some project!!!!!!!! esp. &quot;kicking off&quot; the chassis
from a unibody vehicle!!! This fellow Martin must be quite the handyman to
accomplish all this, and the icing on the cake, a 911 engine. Is this the
type of bus that will spit flames out the back? What type of tires,
steering mods etc. is he planning?

Is this fellow Martin, the same one that had a blue South African panel Van
featured a while back in Vokksworld? Let us know how the project is going.&gt;
hey bus freaks,
