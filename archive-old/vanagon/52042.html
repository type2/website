This VWoA Web page is still a disappointment to an 
Internet veteran and Vanagon owner.  The alleged
1997 Vanagon pictures shown are in reality identical
to my 1995 EuroVan.  I took a quick peek at a 97 
here in Seattle l ast week:  it has somewhat sexier
white bumpers and rear view mirrors, better mid-seat
floor attachments, and of course the 6 cyl engine
and higher price.

Wish they had a more reliable refrigerator.
