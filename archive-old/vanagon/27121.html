Listies - Due to a number of gripes, complaints, and whines I've received
from some of you who know the Lake Kaweah area, I'm going to move that
we change the location of this month's camping trip back to Lake
Isabella, which some of you apparently know and love.  I guess many of
you have &quot;experienced&quot; the Lake Kaweah area, and found it to be quite
substandard.  I appreciate your advice, and hope Isabella will suit our
needs and likes better.  Thanks for calling this to my attention!

In the next few days, I'll study the map and suggest a specific site
at Lake Isabella.  In the meantime, cross off the previous location.

Here's who's going:

Michael/Diane Wagner       mwagner_at_deltanet_dot_com                  
Scott Harvey               sharvey_at_CNS.UCLA.EDU
