&gt;So, after all this....do I NEED reinforced sidewalls on my EV??
&gt;Whatchathink? If this were the GTI, hell I'd have no problems
&gt;finding tires and would know instinctively which performance
&gt;tires to put on...but the van is a whole different animal.

me, personally, i'd recommend YES on the reinforced sidewalls. i've had a
set of NON-reinforced sidewall tires on my vanagon, and i did NOT like the
squishy/squirrelly way it felt when going around corners.

check into the XCH series of light truck tires in load range C ... that'll
give you the same stiff sidewalls as the reinforced (although i think the
tire does not SAY &quot;reinforced&quot; on it).
