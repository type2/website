&gt;Hey, that's no lady....that's my wife (Henny Youngman)....
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;With all of this discussion about bras for vans....would the proper size for 
&gt;a Typ2 be a &quot;V&quot; Cup?....and considering that EuroVans are more &quot;well 
&gt;endowed&quot; than their flat chested sisters (T1,T2 &amp; T3)...would they wear 
&gt;&quot;Super V&quot; Cups?
&gt;
&gt;To me the ideal bra is one that can be quickly released with one hand using 
&gt;a quick, deft motion of the tumb and forefinger!  ;-)

Maybe someone should tell Dolly Parton. She's been shopping at the
Nissan delaer for years, becasue they are the only ones with a 300Z;-)
