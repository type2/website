Subject: Re: Flakey fan switch in '85 Vanagon

Steve,

We have had the same problem with our 85 also.  The last time we had
problems with the switch I replaced it with a switch from a 75 rabbit
from a salvage yard.  Now that switch has gone bad which was replace
with a new switch from the dealer.  The problem may be that the switches
are low quality and do not last too long.  Again, these are the same
switches used in early rabbits and I have heard of rabbit owners having
the same problem.  

(But it does not matter now, the fan motor has died so we will need
to replace that :-(
