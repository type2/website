Subject: Re: 6v wipers on 12v bus

&gt;Well, I purchased at great expense ($17!!) for a device that converts 12v
&gt;to 6v and looks suspicously like a resistor with a heat sink.

I missed the start of this - bus is 12v, of course.

Using a resistor to drop the voltage to 6V?  You would have to know the
resistance of the motor and match it to the dropping resistor.  
Would be a nice auxiliary heat source!  How about two 6v motors in series?
I'd but the device is really a voltage regulator, but $17 seems cheep for a
high-current voltage regulator.

When I changed from 6v to 12v I found a 12 motor in a junk yard and took it
all apart and cleaned it.  Helped a lot.  I've actually had good success
with cleaning those old motors - making sure all the contacts and
commutators were clean made a big difference.

BTW - I still need rain-x.
