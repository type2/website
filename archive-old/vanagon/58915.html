Subject: Oregon/Eugene Listees...

Howdy, all you Oregoners... My roommates are trying to convince me and my bus
and crewcab (VW content) to move to the Eugene area. I have a few questions
about things, and if anyone would be kind enough to reply (personally, as the
list probably doesn't care) I would really appreciate some information.

1. How is the VW scene? Lotsa busses? cheap parts? friendly crowd?
 1A. How expensive is insurance? Licensing? What kind of emissions and
   inspections are there? how many letters can you get on a personalized tag?
 1B How are gas prices?
2. How is the weather? Does it rain all the time? Is is always cloudy? How are
    temperatures?
3. How is the Internet service out there? Isn't there a freenet somewhere?
    can you get good, reliable, quick service, with web page provisions?
4. How is the cost of living? what are housing rental rates on average?
5. Is it very bicycle friendly? public transportation?

Anyway, I know Oregon seems to be a hippie magnet, but before I get magnetized
out there, I'd like to find out a bit more about what I'm getting into...
I'll be in the area for Rainbow, so I'll try to check things out then...
Many thanks...
