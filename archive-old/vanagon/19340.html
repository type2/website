Subject: baja trip - dates?


I searched thru all my saved files on our proposed baja trip.  It
looks like there's a strong preference for October.  I'm happy to
keep track of date preferences/food/whatever as before, assuming
that probably no one else relishes this nasty job (anyway, now I'me
developing a &quot;system.&quot;  

I assume we're talking about a weekend, probably to include Friday
daytime, and possibly even Thursday and even Wednesday ahead of
it.  Let me know which weekends in October you all prefer,
and I'll post the results soon, so that we can all start planning
datewise accordingly...
