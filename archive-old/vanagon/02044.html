Subject: Brake Drum Removing


So, I spent my Saturday morning trying to find out, why my hand brake doesn't
pull. Brake lining seems still o.k. (by peeking through hole), hand brake cable
has lots of tension on it. Thought I pull off the drum to inspect the inside.
Check out Bentley's pg. 46.7 and it tells me to:
	- release parking brake and loosen its equalizer
	- back off adjuster
Well, here we are. Through the hole in the back I can't look inside. So,
if I try to turn the adjuster wheel (which way, up or down?), I don't even
know what I'm touching.

Are there any tricks?

Thanks, Richard ('84 Vanagon)
