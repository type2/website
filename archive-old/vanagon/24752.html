Subject: Info for new engine?

I have a 71' Westfalia that I need to bring back to the land of the living.
Currently I have it garaged and I pulled the engine out. I bought it knowing
that I would need to do engine work. I ordered an engine from ECI out of
corona,CA. however they forgot to tell me that they were going out of business.
Well now I'm back to where I was....Needing a engine! I want a 1600 so as I
don't have to worry about smog restrictions. Any good experiences with some of
the other companies advertising in the current VW mags? What should I look for
if ordering an engine? Any info greatly apprieciated!

Terry
