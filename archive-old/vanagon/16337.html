Subject: Camper tops '68-'71



	So I am trying to buy a '71 bus. It is missing the camper top and 
there is a 3 X 3 foot &quot;hole&quot; in the roof. My question is, can I take the 
camper top off a '73 or '79 and fit to the '71? It looks like it wouldn't 
a problem but I have seen the small pop-up tops and am wondering if this 
is what I need to get. Thanks. I need to act fast because this kind of 
hardware dissapears as fast as the busses do!
