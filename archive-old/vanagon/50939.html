&gt;&gt;Hi Volks,
&gt;&gt;        I called the &quot;VW dealer&quot; here in Traverse City, MI to check on the
&gt;&gt;cost of a rear heater core for my '86.
&gt;&gt;        When the parts guy got back to me he first apologized, I knew that
&gt;&gt;this was going to be bad news. Over $800!! We discussed the part, and we
&gt;&gt;agreed that that was what I wanted. It was NOT the whole box, just the
&gt;&gt;heater core.
&gt;&gt;        Wow.
&gt;&gt;        
&gt;&gt;        Rob
&gt;
&gt;No, No, No,
&gt;
&gt;I just got one--from the dealer in Atlanta it was $157, mail order from
Camelback VW in Phoenix it was $116.  I also bought a new valve, since mine
was shot--that was another $60 or so.  Your dealer is nuts--call Camelback
in Phoenix--don't have the number on me but they have a toll free line--call
800 information at 1-800-555-1212.  UPS can have it to you in five days.
