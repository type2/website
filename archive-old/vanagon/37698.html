Subject: VW picture

All,

For those who might be interested.  This weeks Austin Chronicle focuses
on the SXSW music and film conference, and the Austin Music awards, on
the cover is a picture of someone playing guitar, and a slightly
stylized picture of a Baywindow bus.  If anyone is interested I could
mail you the cover page, or for a small fee(postage) I could send the
entire issue.  Let me know fast, as the Chronicle goes fast around here.
I of course would prefer an SASE to make it easier for me, but that is
not necessary, as that would take extra time. Let me know if ya'll want
a copy.

cheers,

David
