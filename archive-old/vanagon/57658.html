&gt;&gt; I'll take the credit or blame, whichever, for having
&gt; started Eurobago = Eurovan + Winnebago in a private mail 
&gt; to Dan Herbert, at the time when he needed help and sympathy
&gt; on his cracked roof problem.  By now the term has been
&gt; used in 11 posts (keyword search in the 1997 archives); 
&gt; there are also 17 appearance of the equivalent term EV Winnie, 
&gt; as opposed to EV Westy = EV + Westfalia.
&gt; 
&gt; I count some 12 owners of the 95 Eurovan Winebago Camper on the
&gt; list, but many more recent lookers. Anybody care to make some
&gt; baptismal comments?
&gt;
	Volkswagen calls it the &quot;Eurovan Camper&quot;.  That's good enough for
 me.
