Subject: Plastic Wheel Covers-again

I have noticed several responses about cleaning plastic wheel covers 
lately.  I have 3 with some white paint left on them (except the very 
middle) and one that in totally silver color, maybe a replacement by PO 
that was never painted to match.  My question is:
How do I get ALL the white paint off the plastic so they all appear 
silver colored?
