Jose,

Tell your friend to buy the TDI.  This is a state of the art diesel engine
that drives like a gas engine (except for fuel consumption).  See
http://users.uniserve_dot_com/~fred_v/tdi.htm
for some interesting TDI facts and figures.  There is probably other TDI
info on the www.

Mine is just a layman's opinion but I have driven both and choose the TDI
as a clear winner.
