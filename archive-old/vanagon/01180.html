&gt;Is this related to the &quot;high idle&quot; problem that some Vanagon owners
&gt;experience as well? My dealer, of course, is unable to recreate or
&gt;diagnose the problem...

if you mean the problem when you crank the car, and the idle goes up to
about 1500 or 2000 and stays there for a 'while', then drops back down ...

no, i don't think the wiring harness fix will do anything for that. i think
we all 'decided' that the high idle is a oxygen sensor or coolant temp sensor
problem (i.e., the engine is cold and the computer is confused by signals
coming in from one or more sensors).  comments?

if it is happening at other than cold start/warm-up time, it might be a
vacuum leak ... there's a fix for a loose rubber boot on the air flow meter
(new clamp).
