     Bus Boys have them &quot;on sale&quot; right this minute for $149, but
     there are numerous junkyard Westies, check the archives...

Hello all,

Can someone help me with the Roof Vent on my 87 Westy.  I fiberglassed the
roof vent and it doesn't leak anymore but the the lift mechanisim is shot.
 Can I get a roof vent lift replacement anywhere?  I tried calling Delta Six
Industries in California.  That's the company that made the roof vent I
think, but couldn't track them down.

Should I check with the dealer, junkyards or is there an after market source.
 Any help would be appreciated.

Thanks
Ajax
87 Westy
P.S.  This is my first posting for a request so please bear with me if I
addressed this wrong.
