&gt; Is there a locking engine hatch mechanism for a 79 bus.  I have noticed some
&gt; 70's type westys with locks on the engine hatch.  Would those work if I found
&gt; one at a junkyard (or bought one new).  Thanks for any input.

Yes, you can get a locking latch for a late 70s bus.  I got mine from Vee 
Parts in San Diego when I was down there.  Expensive, though: I think I 
paid $62.00 (US!) for mine.  But when you consider the cost of a battery, 
it's actually pretty good insurance.  Also I can diable the bus pretty 
effectively by taking the high-tension lead from the coil with me when I 
leave the bus in a high-crime area.  I just take the wire, lock the lid up,
and have a non-running bus!  

I've seen locking latches in junk yards (found a frozen one in San 
Diego), so you may have luck if you have time and keep your eyes open.  

Note: The latch design changed sometime in the early-mid 70s from a hook 
catch to a lever catch type design (anyone know what year?).  The hook 
type from earlier busses will not work on the later busses, so be sure 
you get the right kind.

Now that I have my locking latch, I can't imagine being without it!
