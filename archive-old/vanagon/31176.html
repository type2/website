Subject: Another pair of Kadrons FS


Several months ago, I bought a used pair of Kadrons to put on my
'71 Transporter. Then got the V6anagon, so it looks like the Kadrons
will remain in their box. Might make someone a nice Christmas present?

These have the linkage and the hose that goes between the carbs. They
also have three (count them, three) pairs of manifolds! Two pairs of
dual-port manifolds, and one pair of single-port manifolds.

$150 plus shipping for the whole schmeer.

These are used, and look OK. Which means, I don't know what shape
they're in. So, if you get them and find they leak or don't work right
or whatever, send them back to me and I'll give you your money back, OK?
I'm a jerk, but not THAT big a jerk.
