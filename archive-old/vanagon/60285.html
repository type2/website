I didn't save your Email address with your last note.  The information on
the Vanagon kitchen unit is in the mail.  It is the one I used when I ripped
the insides out of Smoky to check for rust so has several useful notes on
it.  Mail from here probably takes about two weeks as the mail canoe only
goes to the mainland once a week 8)
