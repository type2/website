Subject: axles r off...

Whew! Just got the axles off my old trans.  Went at it slow, no brute 
force. Got the bearings in the reduction boxes out.  And tapped out the
axles from there tubes.  From there it was a piece of cake.  Pass. side
went alittle easier becuz (1) did the other side first and (2) outer bearing
was shot. Ball bearings rolling on the floor as I split the reduction box
case.  Many thanks for the encouragement.....Now off to find some bearings.
