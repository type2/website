I'd second the Joel's suggestion to replace the fuel filter. (is it near
due for changing anyway?).

Who knows, maybe a wet (with water) filter has different flow
characteristics than a non-wet one (hydrophobic filter material, I know
this sounds contradictory, but some of the hydrophobic filters I use at
work won't pass shit when wet...)
