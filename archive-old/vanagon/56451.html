Subject: The BEST year for a Westy?
Date: Tue, 25 Feb 1997 10:48:33 -0800

Hi all:
I have been lurking on the list for about three weeks and have =
corresponded with several of you on an individual basis during the =
course of my current research..

Here's a topic for a thread that I have not been able to find =
(surprisingly) in the archives for the list: =20

I want to buy a Westy (either weekender or full-blown camper, syncro &lt;g&gt; =
or not), and I am curious if there is a generally-accepted opinion as to =
which model years/options packages are the most desireable, and which to =
avoid.  The car will be also used as a daily driver for about 10 miles =
round-trip.

There seems to be an obvious consensus that they have problems with the =
heads.  Is there a &quot;sure&quot; fix to keep it from recurring? (For example, I =
had a Chevy Vega (ugh) years ago that had silicon-impregnated cylinder =
walls that failed after about 25,000 miles.  The sure fix was to have =
the cylinders bored out and fitted with steel sleeves).  I see many FS =
Vanagons that say &quot;new heads,&quot; but if they fail just as regularly as the =
originals, it seems that it is only postponing the inevitable. (?)

Thoughts/opinions anyone?
