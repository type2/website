Subject: Re: Ground Shut-off Switch Needed

Try your local marina. Battery shut off switches are very popular on boats.

&gt;Hi All:
&gt;
&gt;I am looking for a simple but effective ground shut-off or disconnect
&gt;switch for my '83 Vanagon. There is not enough room in the battery
&gt;compartment for an available terminal post screw switch, plus I don't
&gt;want to be opening and closing the cover all the time. 
&gt;
&gt;Does anybody know of a pull-plug key or other external disconnect? (I
&gt;seem to remember reading about a VW hot-rod modification for a
&gt;plastic/metal remote ground connection with a big key, but that was a
&gt;few years ago)
&gt;
&gt;Please reply to the list
&gt;
&gt;TIA
