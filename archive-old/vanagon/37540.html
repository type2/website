Subject: Re: Caravelle?


A Caravelle is the model name for the T3 and T4 passenger vans sold by VW in 
Europe. There are at least two Caravelle models, the CL and GL. The EuroVan 
CL and GL are the equivilant of the Caravelle CL and GL. The Vanagon 
nameplate is a US/Canada only name. WHat you saw was either a Euro version 
or a T3 which someone put on European badging.

The European badging is available from a number of sources. As I recall Joel 
says he has a &quot;Transporter&quot; badge on his Vanagon. The &quot;Transporter&quot; badge is 
for the delivery van versions of the T3/T4. My EuroVan MV carries the 
&quot;MultiVan&quot; badging.
