Bob,

Two years ago when I joined the list this was my very first project on my '90
Westy.  I was really scared to tackle it 'cause I really don't have any
training, tools or even more than a driveway to work in.  I was sure I would
disassemble the dashboard and then need something I didn't have with no way to
get it.

It was Joel Walker, Dan Beatty, and Berry Kercheval that gave me the confidence
to do it.  I tried to find a copy of the original messages for you but couldn't
locate them.  From my notes, the things they all said were to: Go slow, plan on
taking a whole day to do it and get a Bentley manual.  It paid off for me.  I
was able to replace the fan without more than the expected cursing at stubborn
moments.

The problem I understand comes from the fact that the fan is lubricated by a
fixed supply being fed by centrifugal force.  Once the lubricant starts running
out it takes a stronger force to get it moving and keep it moving.  I was
tempted to put a used one in, but the amount of work required convinced me to
buy new and try and do the job only once.

Good luck and I hope you take as much satisfaction out of being able to tell the
dealer/mechanic you don't need him 'today'.

PS:  Does anyone know where I can locate used; a small flexible hose that
connects from the power steering pump to the metal tube running to the front of
a '90 Westy?  It's my current project. The dealer wants $250 for the part alone
and already charged me $35 to 'fix' the problem by putting 2 hose clamps around
the outer protective rubber sheath to 'stop' the leaking.  I hate giving him
business more than ever.

&gt;Good morning to all,
&gt;Since I'm doing everything else I've been putting off for years, I've
&gt;decided to tackle the blower for the fresh air vents... I now have just the
&gt;high speed for the blower, medium and low don't work. I know there's one or
&gt;two resistors that regulate the speed and I assume they're kaput. I also
&gt;realize that VW built the entire van around that blower motor... My
&gt;question is; any of you folks out there tackled this project sucessfully
&gt;and lived to tell about it. Or...should I just be happy with the balls to
&gt;the wall, full on, high speed that's left?
