Subject: Re: FWD: 1981 Vanagon, (Bla. bla.bla.) $250!

&gt; 1981 VW Vanagon, gasoline heater, AC, sunroof, auto, 180,0000 miles,
&gt; good body, $250 or trade for some computer stuff that I can use.

Too bad it's not a 4spd, It would be the ULTIMATE vanagon...

still sounds pretty neat though. I've only ever seen one other Vanagon that had
A/C and a sunroof.
