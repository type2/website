friends don't let friends live in southern california.

GOOD friends put them out of their misery after they try it, as they will 
NEVER recover.

depending on what life style they TRIED to live there they will not be
able to stop themselves from muttering things like, &quot;you call THIS a
mall?&quot;, or &quot;did i hear somebody say that the surf was up?&quot;, or after a
cloud passes in front of the sun for a few moments &quot;i HATE these overcast
days.&quot;

and the topper for me is dureing the first few minutes of a drizzle after
many months of drought they ask &quot;dosen't this constant raining bring on
alot of suicides because of depression?&quot;
