Subject: Honda/VW Invasion... (f)

Just a passing observation while running VW errands.

Most long time &quot;VW&quot; service and parts &quot;specialists&quot; in the Phoenix, AZ metro
area are now (within the past few months) promoting and encouraging Honda,
Nissan, Suzuki, and Toyota business.
The list of shops even include the ones known for creating magazine cover
vintage vehicles and megabuck auction buses.
Just think. I convinced my wife to sell her Honda Civic to afford the '67
&quot;Westy Resto from Hell!&quot; We could have saved all of the time, trouble, and
money and just spent all of the &quot;resto&quot; dollars on a mega buck pumper stereo
and hearing aids.
Next thing you know, the Japanese will be paying big bucks and buying swap
spaces just to get into the &quot;Honda&quot; shows early before the general public.
Naw, they are laughing all the way to the bank in the exported/inported  VWs.
Things that make you go hmmmm...
