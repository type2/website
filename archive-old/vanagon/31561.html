Subject: 58  pickup FS/junkyard tour

visiting my dad in sunny California  (wow- seen whole days without rain
here!)  so we took a little junkyard tour.  EPA was very disappointing.  Used
to be always a split screen or three, and a row of bubblw windows.Alas, those
days are GONE!   Two of the yards are closed.  Saw one vanagon, and half a
dozen 70s beetles.

Today visited a place in San Jose. VW used parts Center (408) 294-5210.
 Finagled my way into the yard with the splits.  This place is a vw only
breakers- they take the cars apart for you - and the prices are higher.   And
lo and behold - I saw a bus I recognised.  I had been half assedly trying to
get mt hands on a stash of buses over the past year or so, from this old
geezer.  The 63 crust bus with a &quot;I'd rather be Flying&quot; sticker, used to have
a lot more good parts on it.  Also a couple very nice bubble window campers,
I had wanted to put back on the road - very clean- one with metal euro style
dash.  Made me sick.  Should have been more pushy, especially when I heard
the geezer died in the summer.    Oh Well.  SOL

oh- the pick up- yeah, they had a 58 pickup, said it ran, no back bumper, had
a front, nose dented fairly completely, not to mention sides- PO had not been
very spatially aware, shall we say.   Had a 1600 DP. Some rust, redone front
seats, later taillights and decklid, no floormat or vw symbol.  Anyway, guy
said no parts off that one, he wanted $1200 for it, probably okay  for a
runabout.
