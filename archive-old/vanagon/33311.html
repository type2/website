Subject: Getting hubs off '62

hi all,

Thanks for all the wide and varied advice on socket sizes! 
(Got my ruler out today - it's 36mm for anyone wanting to do this to a '62 bus.)
Armed with new socket, adaptor and scaffold pole (!), I will embark on my first
brake job tommorrow.... :-s
Let's hope I won't have an idiot story to tell on Monday...
