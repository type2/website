Subject: Re: Vanagon with Porsche power.

&gt; This months VW motoring has an article on a '84 Vanagon with a 911

&gt; `self-incriminating', but it is stated that the van will do 100mph
&gt; in third gear, still with *two* gears to go. 
&gt; 
I take it that the thing has wings or a tailfin to deal with the 
aerodynamics of a box at warp speed...?
