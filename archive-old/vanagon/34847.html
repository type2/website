&gt;HELP!
&gt;
&gt;        I just got this 72 camper and the engine won't stay lit because when
&gt;the ignition switch is released from starting, the connection to the coil,
&gt;etc. is dropped.  I can see this with the dash lights, fuel gauge, etc.  I
&gt;am trying to remove the ignition switch, and having some difficulty.    
&gt;        I have dropped the steering column, found and unscrewed the little
&gt;hidden 2 screws underneath the attaching screws, but cannot seem to dislodge
&gt;the sumagun.  If I could remove the chrome ring around the key, it might
&gt;work, but it doesn't seem to want to budge either.  
&gt;
You need to remove the &quot;housing&quot; that the ignition switch is in, in order
to really work on this thing.  I'm not sure if &quot;housing&quot; is the 100% correct
term, but I'm referring to the black, somewhat triangular shaped piece that
the ignition switch mounts in and that the steering column passes through.
You removed the hidden screws, and I think that's all there is.  What you
are trying to do is separate the plastic piece with the wires coming out of
it from the rest of the ignition switch.  If there is another screw holding
it in place, though, it should be fairly obvious when looking at it.  Once
you've got the screws out that hold the plastic part of the switch in, you
just pull that part out.  There isn't much room, and the wires are kind of
in the way, but you can do it.  You don't need to get the rest of the switch
out or worry about the chrome ring.  Your problem is most likely in the
electrical portion you just removed.  (Was in my case, anyway, with similar
symptoms.)  I think someone posted instructions on how to remove the rest
of it, though, and that there is a COMPLETELY hidden button on the blind
side of the cylinder you have to press with a hook-shaped wire.

&gt;        I tried to remove the wheel, and even unscrewed the 3 screws from
&gt;underneath the horn ring, but cannot get the horn button to let go....HELP.

I don't understand this part at all.  On mine, you have to pry off the horn
button to GET to the 3 screws!  How did you unscrew them if you couldn't
get the button off?  I just used a knife to pry on the black plastic button
(not the metal part around it, which doesn't pry off).
