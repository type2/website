&gt;I was watching a video of the Apollo moon shot series the other day.

&gt;During a quick take to the crowds about JFK space center in florida,
&gt;they pan across a beach, and waht do you see??
&gt;
&gt;About 30 pre-66 westies, tops popped, all facing the same direction!
&gt;
&gt;Everyone was camping out, waiting for the rocket launch.
&gt;
&gt;A sight to behold!

        I've seen the same footage, and was struck by the fact that all the
people you see in the shot are normal respectable-type folk. 30 busses
camping in one place these days-well, you get the picture...  ;-) ;-) Makes
me long for the old days, ya know? Nahh!!

Peace,
