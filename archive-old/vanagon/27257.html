I gave up on this kind of thing and got a re-conditioned
head on a trade-in.  My bolts did not break, just the 
threads rotted off...

Cannot remember the name of the source, but somewhere's 
in California there is a guy who burns out the broken
off bolts with a laser and retaps the hole at original
plus 1mm.  

I can get the name if it is useful...
