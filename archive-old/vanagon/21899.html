Subject: My Junkyard score--BUMMER

OK--New seatbelts---        COOL

    Cross Bars &amp; Hardware for front Hammock----UH OH--

I'm not sure what year bus I pulled this all of of maybe a 73 or so, 
but the Cross Bars for the Hammock over the Front seats are about 1&quot; to 
short.  The holes are drilled for the front hardware, but not for the 
back hardware.  I don't believe a 76' West came with the front hammock 
because it had the 2 big beds, but I really wanted to add it.

Any one with any idea?? I already thought of the Welding shop to either 
extend the bar or to have the ends of the bar welded on a new bar.

Open to any ideas---BTW all of the above was $26.50--I think they 
thought the cross bars were part of the suspension--OH WEll

Thanks for any help.

Joe
