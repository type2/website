Aaron,	
	Your case probably hasn't been touched by a cutting tool since it 
was originally made.  Is it OK to mention Gene Berg on this list?  Gene 
told me once, that if the big nuts on the side of your case are loose 
when you begin to take it apart this case has problems.  Gene has also 
given me advice that has caused me some challenging break downs in the 
boonies ( more things he left out than things he mentioned, I'll write 
more later).  If the case has not be abused and pounded out it could be 
very usable.  If those nuts were tight when you took it apart and the 
crank spun with some elan, feel happy and reuse it.  Good luck Aaron.  
Gary Gibson
