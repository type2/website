Subject: Re: '91 Vanagon engine fire

Unfortunately I did not receive the recall notice. I purchased my Westy on Mar
30, 1995 and immediately sent in the 'change of ownership' card to VWoA. After
the fire loss I called to check on recalls and found:

They do not bother to change the ownership records until a new owner calls in
with a problem. In my case it was TOO LATE!

They denied that there had EVER been a recall of ANY KIND on my Westy. But data
I now have show that this in not the case - there appear to have been 2 recalls

	If you have either the recall notice and/or the paperwork on the
repair and would be willing to send me a xerox/FAX of these I would greatly 
appreciate it.

Thankx -
	Kenyon

&gt; Hello Kenyon.  I have a '90 Syncro Westy and I had my vehicle in for 
&gt; a recall in spring of 1995 to get the fuel injectors and components 
&gt; replaced.  This recall (campaign RV) was to do with an engine miss 
&gt; and cold start problems, not fire.  
&gt; 
&gt; VW changed the following:  fuel injectors, connecting fuel 
&gt; distribution rails, fuel lines, hoses and clamps. 
&gt; 
&gt; Did your vehicle have this recall done prior to the fire?  
&gt; 
&gt; Sorry to hear about your loss.
&gt; 
&gt; Harry. 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; PLEASE - if you have experienced any problem with the clamp/O ring assembly or
&gt; &gt; fuel injectors on your '91 Vanagon - contact me with your information.
