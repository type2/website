Subject: RE: heaters and propane

&gt;&gt;---
&gt;    How is it vented? Where did you buy the heater? What was
&gt;    involved in the installation? How is the heat controlled?
&gt;    Is the tank in a cage to keep it from being crushed in an
&gt;    accident?

Hi Michael,
   I put a propane heater in my 70 van.  It was a suburban propane type out
of a R.V.  You can get one at just about Any RV dealer it should come with
its own vent that attaches to the side of the bus. (hole cutting
necessary). I mounted the heater behind the drivers seat, but you could put
it under the rear seat.
    Dormobile used to put their propane tanks in the engine compartment.
Drive and hope you don't get slamed in the rear. (BOOM)  I, and this is
very wrong don't do this at home, put a twenty pound, barbeque type,
propane tank in the van. The legal thing,I think, is the mount it in a
special mount in the back up high above the engine compartment, attached to
the back hatch. (that makes it almost impossible to openthe hatch). Of
course another option is to get a VW type tank that mounts under that van.
Their expensive and don't hold very much.If you use that one you'll be back
to the propane dealer every week filling up like filling up the gas tank.
Anyway hope this answers your questions and good luck.
