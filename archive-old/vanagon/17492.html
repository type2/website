So Larry Montgomery says:
&gt; 
&gt; Is there a source for for parts to the Dual carbs on the 72 -    Bus?
&gt; Just about exausted my resources trying to find either a replacement(s) 
&gt; or a source for the Solex air correction jet (155).
&gt; 

When I had my '74 hardtop camper I bought a pair of carbs through Von
Housen Auto Parts.  They came from Tomco in Southern California.  It 
only took them three times to get the right ones ;) (although I wasn't
smiling back then).
