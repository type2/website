&gt;screws to be so hammered that the ends were no longer convex.  I can't 
&gt;figure out why this is,


Sounds like the valve screws aren't real ones, they should be hardened 
enough to last for years and years. Replace them, try one side?. If they go 
again, get the springs checked, they may be too heavy. The ball joint type 
are good, and are needed on engines with heavier stiffness/dual valve 
springs. I believe that the OEM VW screws are set to touch the valve stem 
slightly off centre. This makes the valve rotate very slightly as the motor 
runs, evening out seat wear and avoiding pitting. They have to remain convex 
to do this. You can see the circular wear track on the end of the valve stem 
where they push.   tim s.
