&gt; &gt; I installed some fog lights today; I made these brackets out of 1/4&quot;
&gt; &gt; steel and out them below the bumper, set back a couple of inches.
&gt; 
&gt; Are these FRONT fogs you've mounted below the bumper?  If so, I'd think 
&gt; you'd get them smeared off whenever the bumper dips low to the 
&gt; road--crossing run-off dips, entering/leaving steep or abrupt driveway 
&gt; entrances, etc.  And if you ever take it off of paved roads, I'd just 
&gt; remove them completely before proceeding...

My bus sits pretty high, and the lights are above the level of
bottom of the steering box...
