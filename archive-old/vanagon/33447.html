Subject: Re: 85 Vanagon Stalling

&gt;This started happening on Saturday evening.  Driving along, engine stalls,
&gt;lights come on--usually starts right back up, if not immediately, then after
&gt;a few minutes.  When the engine is running, it runs perfectly (well, as
&gt;perfectly as it ever does) leading me to believe this must be something
&gt;electrical.  I tried bypassing the Idle Stabilization Unit and this seemed
&gt;to &quot;fix&quot; the problem temporarily, but alas, it's cutting out again.
&gt;
&gt;Where to start?

How about corrosion on the alternator terminals or the battery terminals?
An intermittant electrical connection would have like symptoms.
