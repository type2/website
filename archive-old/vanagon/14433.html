Subject: Re: Newly purchased 71 bus

&gt;Hi, all--
&gt;
&gt;I am the proud owner of a 1971 Transporter, just purchased. 

Congrats, a good year for VWs as I remember.

&gt;2.) The big sliding door on the side, runs on two (three?) bearings.

If the door does'n roll at all, then the lower wheels are likely seized.
Like another poster said, get the lower track absolutely clean of sand etc. 
Remove the lower aluminium bracket from the door, and if you close/LOCK the 
door it won't guillotine your feet. 
        The two lower 'wheels' are simply ballbearings, with a plastic caps 
snapped over them. Pry the caps off, then scrape aside the rust and pop off 
the tiny snap rings that hold the bearings on the shaft. Enough WD-40, 
gentle heat and hammering and you'll get them off. Get new ones from a real 
bearing supplier, not a garage or VWoA.  'Gimme one like this' works 
usually. This was always a problem in Canadian hi-salt winters. If the 
bracket is corroded and badly pitted, try to get a junkyard spare, as they 
do break spontaneously!
         Another weak area in those doors is the rear 'hinge' that pops open 
the door. Clean/lube it. Get that track clear, especially towards the front. 
Dirt built up there will cause the hinge to close early, bashing the nice 
bodywork of the track cover. Just remove the track cover to clean that area, 
removing the door from the van isn't really needed.

Can't help on the rest, bye tim s.
