Subject: water pump replacement


&gt;&gt;ALL water-cooled buses have had to have the water pump replaced...

How do we determine when to replace the water pump regardless the coolant color?
Can someone also post the proper steps of replacing it? This is for an '83 H2O boxer.
Thanks in advance.

Regards,
James
