Howdy Volks,

	the Daly's drive-in meet last Saturday was a big success!  Ten
examples of air-cooled wonders, Types I II &amp; III, from about '62 to '78.
Look for pictures to show up on the web page before too long.

	Don't forget the Michigan Vintage VW Club's Fall Color Tour
goes down this Sunday, 10/15 in &amp; around Kensington Metropark.  See
the newsletter for more info, or email me if you need help etc.  Some
of us Ann Arborish-area folks might be doing a mini-caravan to the
caravan, so to speak.

	Sean Demonner has put megs &amp; megs (!) of pix &amp; movies of the
Milan Bug-Out on his Web page:

Get 'em while they're hot!  It's taking up so much space that it won't
be there for long.  Great stuff!

	Some folks have mentioned to me that they're excited to do another
drive-in meet on a Friday reeeaaaal soon, especially w/ this freak weather
we've been having.  Somebody name a time &amp; place, and it'll happen; I've
been stretched a bit thin lately, so somebody grab this one by the reins
&amp; run with it!  (This Friday?  Hmmmm....!)  Just reply to all the recipients
of this message, and you'll have &quot;spammed&quot; your audience pretty well.

	As always, don't forget about the not.a.vw.club page:

	http://www.umich_dot_edu/~gregm/not.a.vw.club

I'm trying to keep it up-to-date w/ the latest.  If I can get a few minutes
with a computer &amp; the mvvc newsletter in front of me, I'll add more details
re: the mvvc fall color tour this Sunday.
