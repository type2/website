&gt; My '83 GL is having overheating/cooling problems. To give you a brief 
&gt; background, I bought the van 3 months ago. This is my first water 
&gt; cooled VW so this whole thing is a mystery to me! At the time of 
&gt; purchase, the fuel and water temp guages were not working. I replaced 
&gt; the voltage stabilizer and all seemed well. The temp guage read from 
&gt; 2/3 to 3/4, rising only with very extended idling. Now, the guage rises 
&gt; steadily to full mast and the light may or may not blink. I keep 
&gt; checking the coolant but it seems fine, the temp from the resevoir 
&gt; reads about 190 F when the guage is at full mast. The only work I've 
&gt; done since the voltage stabilizer is to replace the alternator.
&gt; 
&gt; Can anybody give a basic account of the proper procedures to test and 
&gt; 'set up' the cooling system?
&gt; 
Sounds like the same symptom I got in an '83, which turned out to be 
a stuck thermostat not opening enough (or at all). Could also be air 
caught in the system somewhere. 
Check the temperature of the hoses at the front - if they're only 
warm, then its the thermostat. I'd replace the thermostat &amp; bleed 
the system first. Then check that the fan switch will come on after 
prolonged idle. If not, replace the fan switch.
