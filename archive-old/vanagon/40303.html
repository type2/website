I just wrote this, I couldn't stop myself!

you MAY be a devoted VW bus owner if:

1) You know the VIN and M numbers, but not the license plate, of your bus.
2) You consider a microbrew and &quot;Driving Under Adverse Conditions&quot; quality
	entertainment.
3) Your lifetime goal is to own a VW junkyard.
4) Someone asks to see your id and you show them the Westfalia Werke plate.
5) You *and* your Junior/Senior Prom date blew-off the dance to help a 
	friend rebuild their reduction boxes.
6) Your mother has had her bus completely disassmebled at the US/Mexican 
	border, because of her attitude.
7) You've used non-detergent oil in bed, or anywhere else!
8) The finish on your bus is 'factory' but the color it once was can no 
	longer be determined - grey... blue...silver? Maybe red?
9) The directions to your house include a list of years, colors and options
	for the busses usually parked at cross-streets on the way.
10) Your dog, like your bus, is named Frodo.
11) Your kids will go hungry tonight because you had to have Safari windows.
12) You owe West Coast Metric more than your annual income.
13) You have lost one or more fingernails on rear-axle cotter pins.
14) Ben Pons makes the list of your 'most admired people'.
15) Your wife's hairdo has been ruined by CV joint grease.
16) You won't stop at the rest area if you're alone, since there's this
	rust-through under the mat, just in front of the left wheel well...
17) You can quote your current gas milage to two decimal places, from memory.
18) Your dog will point and dig for pre-'56 parts at the pick-and-pull.
19) You have removed a window, restored and painted the frame, and
	reinstalled the window with the *old* seal because you're going 
	'Cal Look' this summer.
20) You barbeque Spam next to, not over, burning engine case pieces.
21) You won't let your sister date anyone who doesn't know the correct
	procedure for setting valve lash.
22) You only stay in contact with relatives who drive VWs.
23) Busboys sends you a Christmas card.
24) You bought a VCR so you could watch the copy of the Busses at Redrocks
	off-road tape you talked Martha out of...
25) Your dad and you walk to school together, because neither of your busses
	work!
26) You think your S.O. looks most attractive in greasy blue coveralls.
27) You view the next VW swap meet as a good chance to meet members of the 
	apprpriate sex.
28) You prominently display your Wasserboxer leaking head repair bills
	and class-action suit settlement letter.
29) Your house doesn't have curtains, but your bus does.
30) Your jackstands collapse and kill more than two members of your family.
31) You have started a petition to change the National Anthem to &quot;Truckin'&quot;.
32) You call your boss Herr Doktor Professor, and wish he was!
33) You think a Volvo is 'overpowered, and not space efficient'.
34) You consider your license plate personal because it, and tbe bus, have
	been in the family longer than you have.
35) You have been fired from a construction job because of the apperance
	of your bus.
36) You need one more hole punched in your card and Pick and Pull will give
	you a free 15 minute all-you-can-carry shopping spree.
37) Your father encouraged you to quit school to finish that first restoration.
38) You keep Citrus Based Hand Cleaner in your shower, for your hair.
39) After making love, you're always amazed how much light comes in the
	pop-top walls.
40) You're surprised surf bands don't count their songs &quot;1-4-3-2!&quot;


	Bill
