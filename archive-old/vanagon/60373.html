Subject: Re: Optima as 2nd battery.

Has anyone actually installed the Optima &quot;bullet poof&quot; battery.....  the one
that uses coiled cells??

Upon preliminary measurements, looks like it is too tall to mount upright,
but could possibly be mounted on it's side using the side terminals.  Also
looks like there is a need to cut the top terminals off to prevent shorts to
the body while the battery is on it's side.

This configuration looks like it will work as long as you do not use regular
battery cables with the thick terminal ends as they will again protrude too
high.....   Is this confusing or what??

Anyway,  I'd like to use this type of &quot;dry&quot; battery to power all the
accessories in my '87 Syncro Westy.  Also, it would lessen the chance of
someone drilling through the battery to drain the acid to kill my alarm
system.

The batteries are expensive, but so is my stereo and Syncro!

Thanks,  Curt Long
