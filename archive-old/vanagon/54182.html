Subject: Temp.-dependent Problem?

I'd much appreciate advice from the list on a problem I'm having with my 84
Westy water-cooled.  The temperature has really dropped here in PA this week,
and I have noticed that she runs fine when cold, but as the temperature needle
reaches about mid-point on the gauge, she begins to exhibit an alternating surge
of power/loss of power.  At times I can press the pedal and it feels like the
van is not going to go, then it catches and surges forward.  On a particularly
cold day I ran both heater blowers on full to keep the needle well below
mid-point and the problem didn't seem to happen. I have a short commute, so that
the problem doesn't really start until I'm almost at my destination.
Any pointers appreciated, either here or off-line.  Thanks.
