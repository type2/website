Where would i fit in? I do worry about having the correct parts
on a car, that even extends to original nuts and bolts. But, my
Bus is also lowered and has approx. 100Hp...???

To my belief, every VW has it's own karma, it becomes more noticable
as the car ages. It's not always a good karma, a VW can develop
some nasty habits. These habits are caused by abuse, mental and
physical abuse, as we all know, that takes its toll on everybody,
including VW's. Collisions and actually beating the car can be seen
as forms of physical abuse. Physical abuse is easily detected and can
be taken care of easily, even though it might take some time. Mental
damage on a VW can occur when it has to put up with parts from older
and/or younger brothers and sisters, or if it has to live with cheap parts
of inferior quality. The VW will let you know when it's unhappy, it will
simulate startingproblems, heaterproblems and idlingproblems, if the
current owner of that VW is really deaf to those signals it will start
breaking clutch cables regularly. Beware, one of the last signs will be
leaking brakelines, or a stroke (ie: a rod through the case)
Finally the VW will commit suicide by setting itself on fire.
Most VW's don't wanna be more or less than what they really are, they
want to be loved by their owners, maintained with quality parts, parts
that go back to *their* days.

They want to be taken seriously.
