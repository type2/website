&gt; &gt; &gt; That's because oil is not used to cool, it is used to lubricate.

&gt; &gt; Oh but it does cool!  At least in the air-cooled engines.  It's
&gt; &gt; a very important function, at least if you believe what the books
&gt; &gt; say...
&gt; 
&gt; I did not say that it doesn't cool, I said that it wasn't used specifically
&gt; for cooling.  Lubrication is it's main function.  How could it not help but
&gt; remove heat from the engine!  Hell, you could run blood through your
&gt; engine and it would remove heat from the engine too.  You should not
&gt; however rely on it to keep your engine cool.  It could be masking
&gt; a major problem!

What I meant was that these books I have read (&quot;How to rebuild your air-
cooled VW&quot;, and others) implied that the engines were *engineered* to have
the oil do a major part of the cooling.  Given that, I think changing 
to an oil with a lesser cooling capacity merits discussion.
