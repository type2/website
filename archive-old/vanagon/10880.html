Subject: advice needed-rebuilding engine-`74 camper-part I

(I am posting this in two parts because my e-mail program is all wacked out
and won't send anything longer)

Part I

Hello all.  I am new to this group as well as to Volkswagons.  I have made
up my mind to take on the mission of getting a '74 camper back into running
condition.  It has been sitting in a garage for the past 10 years after my
dad was told it would need a new engine, and decided it would be best just
to retire the old vehicle.

Originally, I had just planned to swap the old one for a rebuilt one, and
find someone to install it for me.  After posting to rec.autos.vw, in
search of a mechanic willing to take on this task. (many so called VW
&quot;specialists&quot; in the Philadelphia area that I searched out on my own,
cringed and ran in fear at the first mention of the beast.)  After
receiving some responses from my original posting, the popular advice
seemed to be--&quot;Go get Muir's bible and do it your damned self!&quot;
