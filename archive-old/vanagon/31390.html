Subject: 84 waterspitter runs again!

Thanks to all the people who helped me diagnose the starting problem on my '84 
waterboxer, it's running again.  Turned out to be a bad EFI control box, and 
the really F FLAPS found me a rebuilt unit for only $310 (ow!!)

Now I need to change the oil to get rid of the gasoline and set the timing 
back to the right place from having diddled with it trying to get it to run at 
all.

Thanks again to everyone for their generous help.  Now, what could cause 
varying idle speed?  It seems to pump up and down about 100-200 RPM with a 
period of about 3/4 to 1-1/2 seconds, but as soon as you feed any throttle it 
goes away.
