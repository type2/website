For Sale
1973 Volkswagen Westphalia.  
This camper van is originally from California and, though it needs a repaint, it
is in excellent shape with no rust.  The motor has approximately 15,000 miles on
it since a rebuild.  Everything is there including hammocks.

This is a perfect and easy restoration vehicle.
The price is $1700 cash.   As is, uncertified and absolutely firm,  firm,  firm.
