Subject: Idea for engine cooling gaskett

I was talking to a friend of mine about my missing engine gasket and the 
hastle of replacing it when he suggested an interesting alternative.  He 
recommended that I get some of that foam pipe insulation and stuff it in 
there,  If that isn't sturdy enough I could get some thin walled copper 
pipe or aluminum tubing to put in the center.  That would allow it to be 
shaped around small curves and expand it out a little for a tighter fit.
I think I'll give it a try.  any thoughts?
Ed.
