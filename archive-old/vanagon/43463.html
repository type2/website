Subject: propane fridge

We just purchased out first Westfalia (a 1990 unit) and are looking forward
to years of adventure!  Being brand new to this type of travel, I have lots
of questions.  First and foremost on my mind right now is how long can I
expect the fridge to run on propane (assuming no use of the stove)?  I don't
know if the propane tanks underneath the unit come in different sizes, but
this one doesan't look very big...

Are there any publications (books, magazines, articles) that can provide us
with tips on what to expect in the way of problems, routine maintenance,
suggestions re the camping equipment, and so forth?

TIA
