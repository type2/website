Subject: Re: Vanagon Floor Mats

Hey Tony!  Here's what I did.  I bought about12' of that ribbed 
rubber, and cut to fit for the front mats, and then have a strip by 
the sliding door.  This rubber (industrial type black and ribbed 
often seen in entrance ways, in CAT's, etc) is  not cheap (about $9 
/ft if memory serves me right), but it works great.  I have coco mats 
in the front over this rubber as well so water doesn't go throught to 
the carpet.  Maybe this heavy rubber is all  you need??

Harry.


&gt; Hi There,
&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone have a good source for rubber Vanagon Floor Mats?  I checked the 
&gt; Parts Place Catalog and there are some for $39.99 US  === ~$65.00 after 
&gt; conversion/duty/GST and shipping.  Ouch....  There are some up here that are 
&gt; $100.00 CAN!!!!  ($20.00 floor mats with and $80.00 VW logo!)
&gt; 
&gt; I can always try and &quot;Macgyver&quot; some FLAPS ones, but I would rather not.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks
&gt; Tony
