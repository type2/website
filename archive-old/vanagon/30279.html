&gt;The PO added a 12v fan to the Westy. The problem is that when the fan is run

My guess ids that if the switch is too hot, then it is the switch that is too
small.  Switches are rated according to their current carrying capacity and
the switch may well be under sized for the fan's current draw requirements.
 As for the wire, is the wire warm or the insulation getting discolored or
brittle?  These are signs of undersized wire.

Good luck,
