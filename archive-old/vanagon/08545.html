Subject: Re: R&amp;T Article (longish)


	This about perfectly sums up why Road and Track has no interest
for me any more. Minivans (at least the Chrysler and GM products I've
been in) are soul-less appliances that do several things barely acceptably.
More to the point, this article addresses them because they are a 
demographic trend- a lot of them are sold. The Road and Track of the
1960s didn't cover Galaxy 500s and Olds Cutlasses just because they
sold in large numbers. The R&amp;Ts I bought at newstands with my lunch money
and still have some of were written with passion about cars that excited
passion, because of technical interest or excellence. Oddly enough,
Peter Egan reaches these same conclusions, after a long while.
	Maybe there should be term limits for autmotive journalists?
