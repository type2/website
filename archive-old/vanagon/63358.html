Subject:      IMPORTANT: Trailing quoted text

Hi Folks,

Please delete any trailing quoted text from your replies, unless it's
absolutely necessary to the context of your message.  This trailing text
contributes significantly to list bloat, and makes the list a far less
pleasant place for your fellow vanagon &amp; eurovan owners.

Thanks!
Coyote
