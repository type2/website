Subject: clutch replacement question

Well, here's an update on my clutch replacement and a question.
I disconnected everything according to Bentley and it all went well, but I 
can't imagine how I'm going to get the bolt at the top of the Starter 
threaded back into its nut.  I may not have to worry about it, if I don't 
solve the hard problem below.  Anyway, we used a couple of cement blocks and 
some wood to hold up the engine. We didn't remove the last of the bolts 
holding the engine and the transmission together until  we were sure that 
everything was going to be supported at the right angle.  We supported 
the transmission on a 4 foot length of 2X12 which we used as a ramp.  
After everything was loose, we simply slid the transmission down the 
ramp.  It went very easily and nicely, and we never had to do any heavy 
lifting.  Taking things apart, we found signs of grease and oil on the 
clutch disk -- the release bearing and the disk springs were both SHOT 
because of all the hammering and chattering, but the flywheel was showing 
no signs of wear.  The sign of grease or oil, however made it clear that 
replacing the front engine seal was a must.  So, after purchasing a seal 
at NAPA and a seal insertion tool (large PVC pipe fitting) from the 
hardware store, we set out to remove the 5 bolts that hold the flywheel 
in.  This is where all the progress stopped.  We struggled -- bought and 
destroyed tools. and finally decided that an air impact wrench was the 
only thing that would take it out, but we couldn't find a driver -- they're 
10mm hex head bolts, and to take them out will take a 1/2&quot; drive, and we 
could find no such animal. So... we bought a decent 10mm hex key and 
we're in the process of sawing a section of it off so we can afix it to 
the 10mm 1/2&quot; drive socket and then either get it loose with the breaker 
bar, or rent an impact driver and a compressor.

So, for the question -- has anyone else had experience removing a 
flywheel attached with the 5 hex head bolts and if you did, how did you
get it off, and after you got the 5 bolts off, did the flywheel come 
right off, or did you have to force it off with the large bolt or what?

Thanks!
