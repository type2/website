&lt;&lt; Jim, my syncro owners manual warns not to tow with 2 or 4 wheels on the
ground.i would fear some damage to the viscous unit due to the fact that the
rear wheels will not be supplying the torque to the coupling but rather they
would be driven by the front?Just a thought.The 2wd vanagon has no
problems...Ive towed mine on all 4s for 400mi or more.&gt;&gt;

Perhaps your 87 Syncro owners manual is different than mine.  :)
Here's what mine says:
Chapter: Gas Station Information
Section: Emergency Towing with Commercial Tow Truck
Page: 136

&quot;Vanagon Syncro
Front and Rear Hook-up
The Vanagon Syncro cannot be towed
with conventional sling-type towing equip-
ment nor with wheel lift equipment or
wheel dollies to avoid damage to the all-
wheel drive system.  Use flat-bed tow truck
only.&quot;

I have not seen any specific reference in the Owners Manual on towing a
Syncro with all 4 wheels on the ground.  Perhaps there's more information in
a section I haven't noticed.  I note that this quote is in the &quot;Emergency
Towing with Commercial Tow Truck Section&quot; and these trucks are not equipped
to tow vehicles flat on the ground, therefore I presume that this quote does
not pertain to &quot;flat-towing&quot;.

The Bentley Vanagon Official Factory Repair Manual (1989) states:
Chapter: General
Section: Emergency Towing
Page: 7

&quot;Vanagon Syncro
(repeats Owners Manual advice then continues:)

Flat Towing
(gives automatic transmission advise here)

Manual transmission (including Syncro)
There are no restrictions on speed or distance
when towing manual transmission cars behind 
other vehicles&quot;

About 10 months ago I towed my Syncro with all four wheels on the ground for
about 60 miles with no apparent effect.  Well, I did damage the bumper a bit
with the tow-bar. :(

I hope this clears things up.
