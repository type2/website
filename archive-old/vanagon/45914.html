Subject: (Fwd) Re: Van at Viper Militia Place (vwnut= whacko?)

&gt; 
&gt; Is this a trend?  
&gt; 
&gt; Or does VW ownership assure you of being considered a whacko in general?
That thought passed through my head today as I tried to explain when 
a co-worker asked &quot;just what does 'Fukengruvn' mean anyway??&quot; 
He had seen another bus (a nice '67 for &lt;gasp&gt; $3800!) for sale which 
had a fukengruvn sticker just like mine and thought I might be 
interested.

I basically told him he had to own a VW to understand, mainly because 
I couldn't laugh too hard in an e-mail reply...

I had to be nice though, 'cause he got me a *really* cool T-shirt 
from the Wa state Mt Bike race which has some great bus designs on 
it.
:)

ps: Anyone on the list know about the designer of this shirt? (Garth 
Mix) apparently the baywindow is his.
