Subject: 12vdc power supplies



To All:

For those wishing to operate their 12vdc equipment from shore
power, the required twelve volt power supply need not be bulky. 
Modern switching power supplies do not use a heavy transformer,
unlike their bulkier ancestors.  

I use a 20 amp power supply that weighs about five pounds and
measures 6&quot; x 5&quot; x 4&quot;, a compact cube of a thing that contains
its own cooling fan.  Because of its small size and light weight
it may be mounted just about anywhere, so long as it receives
adequate air flow.  By comparison, the transformer power supply
it replaced weighed about twenty pounds, was about 12&quot; x 6&quot; x 8&quot;
and was rated at only ten amps.

The model number of the power supply is RSP-2012.  The nominal
12vdc output is adjustable from about 11.8 to 14 volts and is set
to deliver 13.6vdc.  Regulation is very good.  It was
manufactured in Taiwan but the sticker showing the American
distributor is defaced.  I bought the unit used at a ham radio
swap meet about six years ago.  The price was $20.

The system, which is installed in a small home-made camper, is
designed to use 12vdc at all times.  Shore power is wired to
several outlets but the evaporative air cooler, pumps, lights,
security system, stereo and communications equipment operate from
12vdc at all times.  When shore power is available the switching
power supply comes on automatically and is connected to the main
12vdc buss.  Two 105 A/hr batteries are used when shore power is
not available.  The batteries are charged by the engine and/or a
37 watt solar panel.  The vehicle electrical system is seperate.

A major energy savings was obtained by using an ice box rather
than a refrigerator.  Starting with a conventional icebox having
a molded ABS liner, I dismantled it and rebuilt it using foamed-
in-place urethane foam so as to provide at least 3&quot; of insulation
on all sides.  This makes the door something of an art-work since
the foam had to be cut away to provide access to the handle.      
To reduce the introduction of air via the drain, it was fitted as
a siphon.  Thanks to the heavy insulation, ten kilos of ice lasts
three to four days, depending on the temperature.  The camper has
been used mostly in Baja California and ice is usually available
near most Pemex stations.  

Thanks to the low humidity and good insulation, the evaporative
air cooler is able to maintain a seventy degree cabin temperature
on 100 degree days, although the water consumption of the cooler
is rather high.  One of the 12vdc pumps supplies the evaporative
cooler with water.
