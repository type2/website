&gt;         I have two questions:
&gt; 
&gt;                 1. Is the receiver/dryer composed of some sort of desicant
&gt; material, to absorb any moisture from the freon?
                             YYY EEE SSS

&gt; 
&gt;                 2. If the answer to #1 is yes, then can I gently toast the 
&gt; receiver/dryer the the oven for a few hours, at say 100 degrees C,
&gt; to drive off any accumulated moisture, and then reinstall the unit in
&gt; my AC freon circuit?
         I Hear that this can be done, but that is not it's only
         purpose. It also cleans dirt out of the system. If it is
         many years old it must be replaced. Last.. If your system
         was opened for a long time, you should run a cleaner thru
         it before vacuming it down. 

&gt;         And no, don't ask why I am recommissioning the AC, with 
&gt; 30 cm of the white stuff on the ground!
                             Very wise to think of this now!
