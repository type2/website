Don't just delete this...I'm serious.

My clutch has excessive play.  By this I mean that when I step on the
clutch there is absolutely no resistence for the first 1/4 of the pedal
stroke.  In Bentley there is a diagram that shows an adjustment to the
&quot;plunger&quot; length.  Only one problem...the &quot;plunger&quot; is BURIED behind the
dash.  I can't even see it let alone adjust it!  Anyone played with type
of thing out there?

Thanks in Adavnce!
