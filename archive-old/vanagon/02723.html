Subject: Norcold Frig. in Eurovan Camper



Traveling through Santa Cruz, California last week, I had my first 
opportunity to look inside a 1995 Eurvan &quot;camper&quot; model with all the 
gear, poptop, etc.

One big difference seems to be a different model of refrigerator, made by 
Norcold as I recall. Given all the trouble with the former frig., should 
this one be more reliable?  Cooler?

Dealer also mentioned another nice little touch, their are hydraulic arms 
for the pop top, making it much easier to lift, especially for petit women.

How well do owners of these new models like the appliances in them 
(refrig, etc.).
