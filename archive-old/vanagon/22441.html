Subject: More on my tranny

Well, I got my tranny last night for my '66.  I haven't put it in yet,
won't have time until tomorrow.  But the mechanic gave me some good info.
He said that my bus had bug gearing in it, so it was actually geared
lower than a standard bus tranny (which is already low).  I told him I
wanted to lower the RPMS a couple hundred in fourth, so he mad it so. 
Here's what he said I should have had, had, and have now. 

                     R&amp;P    4th             Final
A standard bus has:  4.37 x .82 x 1.26      4.51
I had:               4.12 x .89 x 1.26      4.62
Now I have:          4.12 x .82 x 1.26      4.25

He told me the old tranny had some other problems besides no reverse.  :)
He said it looked like someone, not to profesional, had tried to work on
it sometime in it's life Like about .5 cm of play in the 4th gear because
the bearing was gone.  That must be what those needle bearings in the
tranny fluid were from.  And there were ball bearings in the reduction 
boxes where there should have been roller bearings.  And he gave me my 
ripped up reverse gear as a bonus.  :)

It'll be nice to have a bus with reverse and good brakes.  Now I guess 
I'll have to fix all the play in the steering next.  :)

Thanks to all the people that mailed me with things to check or do while 
I have the bus apart.

Bradley
