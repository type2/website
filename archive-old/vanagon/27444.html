&gt;A similar problem exists with the hood shocks on the 911.  A popular 
solution
&gt;is to install 2 sets of shocks, ala off road race cars (yeah, I can see
&gt;coil-overs on your hatch with 28&quot; of travel!)


Guys, they're just worn out. Like, losing their compressed-gas charge,
you know? Replace them, and you'll live happily ever after. Or, at
least, until the new ones wear out in five years or whatever.

Been there, done that on my old Saab 900 Turbo, which had a BIG rear
hatch. New ones from Saab were $54 each, but I found some aftermarkets
types for $18. They were still working fine when I sold the car about
1-1/2 year later.
