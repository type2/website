Subject: Re: List Stickers, shall I make them?

I completely agree with you David,  While i have met a very high number of
frightfully kind people on the list,  My modem is only so powerful and until
I can scrape up enough money for a faster one, the volume of messages, even
at present gets a little time consuming, not to mention sorting out what is
applicable to me and what i want to read.  At present I usually only read
posts from names that i recognize and/or newbies that are as helpless (at
times) as a baby chihuahua in the welping box.  Just my opinion as well, and
hope we don't start a silly flame thing here. adding another cent to David's
handful of change.

&gt;Sure, I would like everyone with a type II VW to be on this list, but it
&gt;just isn't practical.  I think we get plenty of new subscribers without
&gt;advertising on the web.  See, I'm greedy.  I want this resource.  I
&gt;have made a lot of friends on this list, and if it went away for
&gt;whatever reason, I would be devastated.  I'd rather not take a chance on
&gt;it going out of control like one of Bradley's campfires.  My two cents.
