&lt;&lt; I am looking for front seat upholstery for a 1983 Brown Vanagon GL.  The
 seats are Beige velour (cloth) with a houndstooth insert panel.  The
 interior code is KZ.  If I cannot find the cloth I am willing to buy an
 entire seat.  If anyone has any idea where I can find one please let me
 know. &gt;&gt;


your seats were offered from late '82 to '84 on the GL's. You'd have better
luck finding a seat, than trying to locate the material and trying to
re-upholster.

they're quite common.
