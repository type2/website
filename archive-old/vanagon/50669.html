Subject: Hot engine-dead starter cure
Date: 	Sun, 20 Oct 1996 11:05:18 -0700

Hi,
   The classic cure for a dead starter when the engine is hot is
   to wire a selenoid in the engine compartment.  I know it works
   as I had it done on my '71 bus and never had a problem in years.

   My question is...what is it actually wired.  I have a friend with
   a '70 bus and I would like to help him put one in.  If anyone 
   knows please FAX me the wiring diagram _at_ 818 843-7243 or E-mail
   it to me.

   Thanks.
