Volks,
	Here's a chance for you to all flame me.  I've been thinking about
ways to squeeze a little extra power from my engine.  I know that the
main problem is that my intake is restrictive.  The stock manifolds and
carbs are not very big, and while they make acceptable torque at low
RPMs they run out of steam above 3500 RPM.  Not helping things is the
air cleaner assembly, which forces the air to go through a long twisting
passageway to reach the mouth of the carb.

	So I'm thinking to myself, I've got this huge blower fan on the
ceiling of my engine compartment that is controlled by a switch on the
dash.  Its purpose is to blow air down into the heat exchangers to boost
the heater output.  I'm thinking I could unhook the hose at the heat
exchanger and clamp it around the intake on the air cleaner.  One flip
of the switch and I would have positive manifold pressure, through the
air cleaner.  Probably not a lot, but perhaps 1 psi?  Half of a psi?
Maybe it would be enough to make up for the additional work that the
motor has to do to draw the air through the air cleaner.  I'm going to
try it real soon now.  I plan on hooking a vacuum gauge to the manifold
to verify results.  Anyone care to predict what will happen?

	BTW, I realize running the motor will draw 6 amps or more that will have
to be made up by the alternator.
