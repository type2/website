Hello,

How do you adjust the tailgate so that it shuts smoothly without having to
slam it too hard? According to Haynes you adjust the strike plate, but this
has a limited range of adjustment. Might I need to move the tailgate out at
the hinge end? The gasket where the hinge bolts into the body has perished
thereby losing a couple of mms.

The locking mechanism seems to go through two clicks as it rotates into the
locked position. It is valid to just use the first click position or is it
meant to click twice and go all the way round?
