Hi Tom,

I didn't mean to infringe on anyone's copyright or to co-opt anyone's work,
nor to eclipse the NEATO newsletter proper in any way. During a discussion
on the VW-bus email list, I offered to compile and put on my web page Mcode
information, and Dave Easterwood, one of the original compilers, sent the
NEATO list to me, which I put together with some other (online available)
material. The bulk of it, however, is from the NEATO article, and, in
retrospect, I should have contacted all the authors before putting the list
on my web page. It is now gone.
