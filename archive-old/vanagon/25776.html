So much for following in Gerry's footsteps, eh?
It really worried me when I read this, but the more I think about it, the 
more I think I'll probably use the same stuff again.  I have heard that 
mixing the two types is a no-no, and I suspect it's more of a no-no than 
using a phosphate antifreeze.  My plans are to just flush it on a regular 
basis.  It's been a year now since I did it, so I guess I'll make an 
appointment to do it this weekend (with my wife, that is.  No NO! She's 
not going to help me.  I just have to get her permission to take time off 
from real life.  This is real life?  Hmmmmm.). The car had green stuff in 
it when I bought it, and it doesn't have the classic symtoms, so I'm just 
going to hang in there.  If our guesses on the end -play are right, I'm 
going to be doing something about my lower end sooner than I have to 
worry about head gaskets anyway.
