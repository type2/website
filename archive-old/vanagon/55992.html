Subject: 1995 EV Winnebago - Cracked Top

Oooohhh... what a sinking feeling.  Just got a call
at work from my wife - while brushing the snow from the
poptop of the EV this morning, she detected a large
and growing crack, driver's side.

Sounds like a complete replacement is required.

Any other EV owners had this problem?
