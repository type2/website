&gt; 
&gt; My friends six year old boy was just diagnosed with terminal liver
&gt; cancer.  Little Jim would love whatever cards you could send in the few
&gt; months he has left:
&gt; 
&gt; Jim Boshart
&gt; 388 Greenwich St.
&gt; New York, NY 10013
&gt; 
&gt; His parents thank you and I thank you.  May your cheer give him a bit more time.
