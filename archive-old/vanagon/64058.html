Anthony,

Does your A/C work (marginally) when the EV is in motion?

Do the radiator fans come on when you turn on the AC?

If your answer to the first question is yes, and the second, no....then the 
problem is not with the AC controls but with the fan resistors that are part 
of the radiator fan system. They are located in the panel below the left 
front headlight.

You can access this panel by popping out the front grille/radiator assembly, 
and then removing the two sheet metal bolts that hold the panel in place. 
THe resistors should be green in color with all of the coils covered in 
plastic. If they are not...they are burn out and the source of your problem.
