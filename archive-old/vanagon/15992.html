Subject: Wanted to say adieu!

	Well Bus/Vanagon list folks...it has been an interesting and
enlightening few months since I found this small corner of the net. 
Thanks for all the advice, tips, info, help, suggestions and materials
that you've provided to this VW newbie...(but gaining VW wisdom and
knowledge rapidly!)
	My 1979 Westy and I have now survived our shakedown cruise to home
(400+ km on the busiest section of highway in Canada....the 401 Kingston
to Toronto then the QEW to Niagara).  Hopefully the other Ontario folks
can appreciate that driving hell.  S/he (the bus) performed admirably
despite being passed by nearly everything on the road. (I was loaded up
with much of my stuff from my apartment that needed to be returned home.)
	Thankfully, only a few more short jaunts on these monster 
highways, then the beast and I will spend the summer and fall in peaceful 
and rural central Ontario where I work at a summer camp.  I'm looking 
forward to cruising the forested roads of the near north at a reasonable 
and Bus friendly speed of 90 kms while taking days off at cottages and 
nearby lakes and beaches.  Aaaaaaahhhhhh!  Just the thought of it all 
makes me long to be finished these spring exams.
	Speaking of finishing, as this spring marks the completion of my 
degree, I will no longer have access to the net, nor to the list.  I have 
a few more days of account time, but little free time between packing and 
studying...so...Adios!  VW amigos, it has been a wonderful slice of life 
to read and learn and kibitz with you all!  Peace...love...and my your 
bodies never rust and your motors live forever!

	Thanks and Shalom...
