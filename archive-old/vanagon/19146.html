Subject: listmember looking for westy

Hate to send this out to the whole list, but I lost the e-mail from the
listmember who was looking for a Westy in NJ.

I am still wavering between parting with my '82 Diesel Westy and keeping it.

(I'm sorry I do not remember the name of the poster, but...) If you'd be
interested in an '82 diesel Westy, you can get in touch with me.  

We can even let the list be the forum on how much it's worth.
(I will, of course, make the necessary arrangements with other list members
 so the results will be in my favor :-)
