Subject: Will Self's last post?
Date: Fri, 12 May 95 9:42:30 PDT

  Why no more &lt;f&gt; posts from Will Self? No more adventures of Willy and
  von Wokker? No more &quot;altered&quot; poetry and songs? 

  Are we not worthy? Are Internet censors at work? Are Fridays being abolished?

  Please, Will, please - My friends will all drop me like a moldy sandwich if
  I don't forward your creativity and sense of humor to them every Friday.

  Pleadingly yours,

  Dave Kautz
