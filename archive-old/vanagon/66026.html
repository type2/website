&gt;Greetings all,
&gt;
&gt;I  will soon need to transport a Vanagon about 270 miles.  I hope to use
&gt;a full size trailer for this, but if all else fails, has anyone tried
&gt;towing a Vanagon (2wd) with a car dolly?  Anything I should look out for,
&gt;other than removing the drive shafts, checking tires and suspension,
&gt;etc.,  before starting?

I towed my 85 Westy over 500 miles with a car dolly 2 years ago when I had
the engine rebuilt by Fast German Auto in Santa Ana, California.  I did not
remove the drive shafts, just left it in neutral with the front wheels
secured on the dolly and the rear wheels on the ground.

Last month I got more adventurous:  I towed my 80 Westy with a tow bar to
FGA the same 500 plus miles with my 85 Westy!  I would not necessarily
recommend it unless you are extremely careful!  The obvious problem is the
lack of power, but worse than that is the limited braking power of the one
vehicle pulling and stopping 4 tons (yes, that's right 8,000 pounds)!  Boy
do you have to plan ahead!

After all of that my son told me he wanted to get an Audi instead!  So if
anyone's interested in an 80 Westy--email me for details.  I would probably
let it go to anyone on the list for about what I have in it--$3,850.

I wish you well with your towing adventure...

Take care...Bob Marshburn
