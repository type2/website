Subject: Diesel opines

My father is considering buying his first vanagon--an '81 diesel &quot;partial
camper&quot;. I told him that he might want to make sure he was very comfortable
with the slow lane before making the decision. In the interest of fairness,
though, I told him I'd ask the list for some more opinions (I guaranteed him
we'd have a lot to share), both pro and con, about the wisdom of this
purchase. So, here's your chance to influence a VW virgin--what does anyone
have to say about '81s or diesels or both, or about the vanagon experience
in general? (I have done what I can to sell him on VW, but I'm a breadloafer
myself, and can't attest to the virtues of the brick firsthand...) 

TIA,

Ryan McGee
