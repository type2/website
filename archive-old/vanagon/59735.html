Subject: Re: 85 VANAGON FUEL PUMP

I bought a new aftermarket fuel pump for my '85 as a-stab-in-the-dark 
attempt to get it to run.  Subsequent to that, the VW dealer (who knew 
less about  VW's than I did (not much)) told me I needed to replace 
it, I didn't.  Turns out, there was a clog in the gas tank.  The pump 
was screaming for fuel.

If you do buy a new one, my aftermarket pump came with a lifetime 
warranty at half the price of the &quot;official&quot; pump.

Good luck,
