&lt;&lt; Wow, I thought that chrome valve covers for these were available
everywhere.
 You must live on the moon.  The waterboxer Vanagons use old Beetle valve
 covers, available in chrome or aluminum...

 The other best ways to dress the compartment are to replace the fuel lines
 with stainless braided AN hoses, and paint the intake runners and plenum.

 Colorful spark-plug wires are easy, too. &gt;&gt;


OH NO!!!!  the cheezy JC whipme custom look has spread from stoopid beetles
to the Vanagons!!!!
watch out for those flourescent pink distributor caps!!!!  ;&lt;)
