I find this to be simmilar to the situation of the Army tankers and their
M-1 tanks.  While in Germany, I rode with a tank company that had to deal
with the locals in there BMW, VW and Opals (look just like those damn
Pontiacs) who insisted on darting in and out of the tank convoy.  Once the
little M3 or Opal Kadette began to tailgate, the tank commander would give
the order and the driver would accellerate.  The tank's exhaust would melt
the paint right of the hood of the car.  score one for big and slow.
