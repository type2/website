Subject: Still Lucky 

Well, my luck is still holding out.  Went to the auction today of the 
defunct VW dealer (they haven't carried VW for about three years) in 
hopes of dumpster diving and rescuing anything VW related.  They had some 
old air cooled stuff on the shelves yet (the parts manager said that it 
was valued at $1500 on the books).  It took all day for them to get 
around to it, but I did buy the stuff (and some Porsche odds &amp; ends) for 
a whopping $20. =-)   I did do some dumpster diving and came up with some 
later model catalogs, etc.  *The* dumpster find was a '67-75 Campmobile 
Parts Catalog with some very nice blowout drawings of all the equipment, 
including the tents! =-))   And, someone I met there is a former VW 
mechanic in a nearby town (he now works mainly on Audi) and he had bought 
a ton of Porsche air and oil filters for next to nothing, but included in 
his pile was the storage cabinets for the microfiche I bought the other 
day.  He *gave* them to me.  I later sold him some Audi video tapes from 
my purchase from a lot of tapes, so I ended up with several VW tapes for $2.
 =-)))  Things were going very cheap at this auction.  The paint booth sold 
for $1200 (a *very* nice one, huge, ventilated, heated, the works ...) 
I'll quit rambling now and go buy another lottery ticket (69 mil -- woo hoo!).
