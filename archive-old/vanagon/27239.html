Subject: Vgon heater too hot!

Here's a novelty: my aircooled Vgon's heater got hot enough to melt my
JC Whitney in-line heater blower.  When I got the blower, I said &quot;You can't
fool me -- this blower is PLASTIC.  I wonder if ... naaah!&quot;  I can't remember
if I've used it two winters or three.  It is noisy but effective.  

As I've recommended to others, I ducted my heat direct from heat exchangers
to heater ducts, no flapper boxes.  Control the temp with windows and sunroof,
disconnect in April or so.  The two new heat-related changes this fall are
that I removed the gas heater (and sold it to a list-member) and replaced it
with a well-insulated pipe, and upped the engine to three liters.  The 
heater boxes are old but good shape stainless.  The combination was too much.
When the in-line blower stopped working I took it out and found that it had
softened and reformed into a Daliesque parody of itself.

Moral of the story is to use JC Whitney and other plastic bilge-vent blowers
in blow-through, not in-line configuration if your heat is good, most 
especially if you have a gas heater. 

After the loss of the in-line blower I finished the wiring for the blow-
through blower on the Porsche engine.  It is perceptible, and will help 
especially at idle, but it is nothing like the in-line blower.  The in-line
blower gave all its effort to the defroster; the blow-through blower's
effects are dissipated by the floor vent.  If I see a metal-bodied in-line
blower at a swap-meet I'll consider it.  Or maybe double up the blow-through
blowers, one for each heater-box.
