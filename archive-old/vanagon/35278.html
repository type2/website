Subject: buses in parking garages...


 provided you have a radio antenna, you can use it as a feeler gauge
 to see just how close you are to the ceiling of the garage..
 example... if your antenna ends about 6 inches above the highest
 point of your roof and it doesn't make contact with anything than
 you know you have atleast that much clearance. it's usually easy to
 hear it whaping against stuff. 
 i have yet to find a garage in which i couldn't safely use, but
 i can relate the concern. i'd sure hate to smash a roof, it's usually
 the part of a bus that's in the best condition.
 i'd think that those of you that need to use parking garages could
 do a little survey of you own areas ahead of time, then you would
 know for sure...
 normal vw vans usually have little problems...
 westy's little extra concern...
 syncros, little higher , so maybe less parking garage options
 westy syncros, lots higher...

 normal westy's i mean need extra concern ...
