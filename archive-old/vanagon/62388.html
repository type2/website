Subject: Head restoration.

I just pulled the heads off of my '87, much to my surprise the upper rubber and
metal sealing rings that my Bentley manual shows were not there!  Is this
possible?  Do I have the wrong picture of how these go together?  At bottom of
cylinder, there is supposed to be another o-ring.  At the top of the cylinder a
very thin o-ring and a metal sealing gasket.  

I still have the case in the van, I am wondering if I should take it out and see
what else is 'right'.  Any input appreciated.

Regards,
Joe Fahy
