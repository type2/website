Subject: Re: stripped cap-screws on the CVs...


This is a good excuse to go out and buy that dremel tool you always wanted.
The tool, plus a metal cut off wheel makes short work of cutting thru old
bolts.  Or, you could try grinding a flat on each side of the capscrew and
use the old vice-grips.

 &gt;&gt;&gt;I had to saw the head off one particulary stubborn bolt. Once the CV joint 
 &gt;&gt;&gt;was off, the rest of the bolt was easy to unscrew by hand.

 &gt;&gt;I say ... drill them.  The socket head assures you're in the center of the 
 &gt;&gt;bolt head, and if you drill untill the cap falls off, your'e done.

 &gt;I tried to drill it out but there wasn't much room to get the drill in 
 &gt;position. But be warned, it's arm breaking work wielding that hacksaw over 
 &gt;your head.
