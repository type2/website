Subject: 2.1 broke head stud...



 here's a new one for all of you...
 my 2.1 had a sudden cooling system failure at 70+ mph
 a few weeks ago, I'm just finding time now to post, sorry....
ok, crusing and then i notice smoke, well steamy smoke...
 i figure oh my number is up, lets pull over..
 pull over and check it out, i lost alot of coolant
 and 3/4 cylinder head steaming and sizzleing, but it was not
initially clear where the oily coolant was excaping, but
 i figured head gasket, no big deal...i'll pull it out and fix it
 tomorrow, so i have it towed home, btw a nice crankcase full of
 chocolate milk shake...

 any way i'm trying to keep this short, i pull the motor, take it up
 to the shop and start taking it apart.. well i quickly found
  what had happened, a lower head stud had completely let go...
 not from the case, but broke in half...thus breaking the seal
 and forcing coolant into the valve cover and pumping it into
 the crankcase via the oushrod tubes on that side...

 so, there's a new one i think, it's the first one i've seen
 and i am lucky enough to do atleast one or two wasserboxer
 head jobs a month, so i'm keeping in practice...

 seems as though from the break, the stud may have been cracked
 for sometime...the break was only partially clean, it had
 a nice half rust stained cross section, maybe i'll take a photo
 and postit up on my empty web site,

later
