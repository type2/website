I have seen the bushing removed by taking a few rags and stuffing the hole
as full as you can get it. Then take a hack saw blade without the handle
and cut through the bushing being careful not to cut into the steel portion
of the torque converter. The bushing installer I used to use is the old
bushing, but you won't be able to do this if you cut it. A pipe the same
size diameter will work, check the depth before removing. HTH

&gt;well, it looks like the bushing and torque convertor seal need to be
&gt;replaced, between the engine and the tranny. (80 vgon..) 
&gt;
&gt;i posted to the type II list but havent received any replies so i thought
&gt;i'd try y'all...
&gt;
&gt;1) the manual says 2 special tools are needed, a bushing puller and a
&gt;bushing inserter. are these needed or does anyone know of a &quot;backyard
&gt;mechanic&quot; solution.
&gt;
&gt;2) where can these tools/parts be reasonably obtained (a friend mailed me
&gt;a parts supplier list but it got lost in the emails :)
&gt;
&gt;i was going to pay someone but $250.00 to put in a 10-20 part is something
&gt;i cant stomach...
&gt;
&gt;thanks a lot,
