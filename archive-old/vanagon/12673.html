     Hi all,
     
     A few months ago I told of a Split bus that me and my mate (Danny 
     11-window Devon camper) had found rusting away in an old farmyard 
     nearby. We spoke to the owner and she said we could have it for 100 
     quid.
     
     So we finally got our butts in gear and this is where we're at:
     
     Last week I sorted out a lock-up garage a few miles from my house 
     where we could put the bus - this will come in handy when I need to 
     work on my bus and it's raining, ie always. We will use the garage to 
     store the bus in whilst we break it - it's not worth saving.
     
     Then I sorted out a trailer to tow it home on. My mate (Martin 
     23-window 911 bus) knew a guy with a trailer, and he'd lend it for 15 
     quid - bargain.
     
     We've just got to sort out the deal with the owner and it'll be ours. 
     Hopefull it'll get sorted this weekend, and I can attack it with my 
     sockets and spanners - any UK'ers want any parts ?? (USA'ers welcome 
     too)
     
     How about this: I'm gonna cut the front panel off and hang it on the 
     garage wall - cool.
     
     cya,
     
     Lee.
