&gt; Would I need, say, a garage full of large red tool chests and heavy
&gt; equipment to pull this off or is this something that is more or less part 
&gt; replacement?  

The tool chests would help.  Another Chris mentioned that the 1835 &quot;kit&quot; uses
the stock stroke, which means you wouldn't have to split the case, but you
still have to drop the engine and remove the heads.

&gt; I've never dropped the engine in a bus (or actually anything larger than my
&gt; lawn mower), so I am speaking from my wealth of inexperience here, but I 
&gt; thought there was some machining involved in the big bore beefups.

You would probably have to have the heads flycut to fit the larger bore
cylinders but that's not a big deal.  If you don't have them already, you
should probably go to dual port heads with bigger valves to take advantage
of the extra displacement.  A machine shop could take care of all of this
for you for a few hundred dollars.  Money well spent, IMO.

This would not be a simple or fast project, but there is nothing that hard
about it either - just  a lot of work.  If you have the time, I would
recommend it - it's great experience, and I think you would be happy with
the results.

&gt; Any good novels/resources/FAQs about this kind of job out there?

My favorite book is &quot;How to Rebuild your Air Cooled VW&quot; - the large red HP
book.
