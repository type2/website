Sorry if some of you have seen this already.  I didn't get any replies and 
never saw the post get reflected either.

Hello,

It seems to me that someone posted advice on how to get a list of m(h)otels 
that accepted pets.  I have a friend who is traveling from Phoenix to 
Edmonton with her pets and she sure could use such a list.

Thanks,
Mike
