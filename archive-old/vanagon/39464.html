Subject: Rear Hatch Strut Story (Suspander)

&gt;Even if you don't purchase from us, beware of the Suspander Brand.  
&gt;They are grossly substandard and Teutonix refuses to sell them &gt;anymore.

Well,...
After reading the above last week, and after having just ordered a pair
of hatch struts from a place called VW PARTS, I was curious what
they'd send me.....of course, they were Suspanders. Rather than assume
that one company (who sell a replacement part for $13 more each) was totally
correct, I tried them on the other day.

First strut taken off ok, and Suspander put on..... and then,
&lt;HISSSSSSSSSSSSSSS--Squirt.  Drop.&gt;
Some liquid oozed out of the joint btwn. strut housing and rod. And
the hatch definitely did not get any better.

OK, I figured one bum strut. Let's try the other....

Second strut taken off OK (door's *real* heavy now), I put on
second Suspander on other side..... and then,
&lt;HISSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS--Squirt.  Drop.&gt;
SAME DARN THING HAPPENED AGAIN!!

Needless to say, it was no fun putting on old struts again with
the door breathing down my neck (literally!), but the fact that the
old ones neither hissed nor sprayed, leads me to believe
that my novice hatch replacement skills aren't to blame.

Conclusion:
Suspander Rear hatch struts are far less housebroken than my two
cats, and I'm returning for a refund. Guy at VW PARTS says he's
never had any problems with em before (but he didn't seem to eager
to send me replacements... even he said he'd refund em right away).

Out of curiosity, has anyone tried the ones for $20 from JC Whitney?
Should I go with the $25 ones from Big A FLAPS? Or do I really need to buy
the Boge from Teutonix for $43 ea.? Any lurking hatch stut stories?

thanks,
