&gt;   P.S. David Schwarze &lt;and others&gt;, you can probably tell what I am thinking,
&gt;        Is this a dumb idea?

I have thought alot about doing this too, especially the time I was sitting
in Del Mar with a broken valve waiting for the tow truck.  I often wonder
how it would be having a nice, 1776cc type I with big valve heads, and if
it would make more power than what I have now.  In the end, I always
decide that it would be less trouble to do what Jack Stafford did and get
a 2-liter type IV motor with hydraulic valves that is smog legal.
