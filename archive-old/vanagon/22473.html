Here in Minnesota, I'd shutter (literally) at the thought of going a winter 
without a VERY warm vehicle.  I see folks in busses, bugs, on bicycles too. 
 Something about the Wasserboxer warm (or the potential for it) that enticed 
me to these models.

Actually, I was leaning towards a used  IDOO DOO SCOOPER (or Isuzu Trooper), 
but, it just wasn't a VW, and we've had such good luck with them that I 
didn't want to drive something else.

RE: simplicity of pre-emission control design, yea, design is what made the 
VW special in the first place.  I agree with you completely.  Simplicity, 
functionality ...hallmarks of good design, and of great vehicles.

ps: We sold our 88 2-dr Jetta yesterday.  Bought it when we got married, 
love it still.  It's the reason we love VWs, and it's hard to part with an 
old, trustworthy friend.  Drive On old Jetta....
