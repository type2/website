So your POSSLQ objects to you're having an engine on the coffee table, eh?

Long years ago, the reception area for a well known Silicon Gulch Porsche
platz had an excellent coffee table.  Bob Garretson had crashed and totalled
an RSR in a race practice.  They had the entire chassis  cubed (less engine) and
put a nice smoked glass top on the cube.  You could still see lots of the
paintwork and tiddly bits.  The capital cost for the table (less the glass)
was estimated at 25-35K$ but a suitable end for a racing chassis I suppose.

Now BPHd could have probably figgerd out what to do with some of the exotic
metallurgy but he didn't get the chance.

I suspect that Bruce Anderson probably knows what became of the table.
