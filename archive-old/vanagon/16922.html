&gt; I don't like the brake dust residue on my lilly white 71 Westy rims

&gt; rotor/caliper in the JC Whitney catalog but I never looked into them 
&gt; because I was concerned that this might affect brake cooling.

I would be very suprised if they didn't.  I'd much rather have a little
brake dust than decreased stopping power on long hills.  I've even
considered adding some ducting to route cool air to the rotors, cause 
I've noticed some serious fade in the past.
