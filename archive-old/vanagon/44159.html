&gt;I just got my West Coast Metric Catalogue, which I was dutifully perusing,
&gt;when I noticed it lists a seal for Westys which goes on the drivers-side
&gt;rear panel, where that body piece is that they put in to look like the
&gt;place where the middle sliding door track goes on the passangers side (I'm
&gt;having trouble describing just what, I hope you get the idea).  The piece
&gt;is part &quot;N&quot; on page 121 of catalogue 15, part #211-800 &quot;beading, side door
&gt;raling cover&quot;.  What is this, anyone know?

It's exactly as you described it.  It fits between the metal piece and the
body.  There is another one on the other side in the same position.  I
think it's purpose is to keep the metal/metal junction from trapping water
and rusting prematurely.
