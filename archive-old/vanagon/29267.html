&gt;Does anyone know a common failure/problem that would cause a speedo to click

&gt;constantly while driving? (needle bounces also) Current mileage 92,000. 
&gt; Should I replace(new/used), or tear into the speedo head?  Are these 
&gt;speedos unique to vanagons, or are they the same as in some other VW's?

My wife's '88 has done this since 1989.  I had the dealer &quot;fix&quot; it under
warranty.  The replaced the speedometer.  This quieted the clicking but the
needle still bounces.  So I WOULDN'T TRY A NEW SPEEDO.  I think the problem
lies in the cable and cable routing.  I've been meaning to (yes, for years!)
try lubricating (graphite maybe?) and adjust the routing of the cable so that
it is as straight as possible.  A friend of mine got rid of the clicking this
way.
