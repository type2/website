&gt; Has anyone replaced brushes in situ and how did they do it.

Patience, I guess.....I did both sides in my '71 and don't 
recall any problems with getting to the screws...I did however
pull the springs off of their nubs and had to fish them out
of the generator case.  I find that crochet hooks work well
for pulling the springs back...I found this out AFTER I pulled
the springs out with the small screwdriver.
