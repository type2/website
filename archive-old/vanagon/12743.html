Subject: Re: Question about gas heaters

As some of you may recall, I've had LOTS of phun with the gas heater in the
79.  However, it was (note the tense) 15 years old, infested by mice, and
probably a victim of wrench abuse.

Anyway, it died, and being unwilling to freeze my fanny off forever, I got
a rebuilt motor from a guy in Hapatcong, NJ by the name of Ark Mirvis.  (He
was in the TRANSPORTER from LiMBO a while back)  Ark was great to deal
with, and a lot of fun.  He sells various rebuilt motors &amp; parts and seems
very much on the level.  I've got his full address &amp; phone at home if
anyone wants them.

I'm a big fan of these heaters, BTW.  They *really* work well, and I think
they're safe as long as you pay a minimum of attention to them.  (I can say
this after finding the fuel line to the old one had split &amp; was spraying
gas all over the place during a long trip...)  I wouldn't use one for any
length of time without running the Bus engine, tho', as it will drain your
battery.  For camping I've used a catalytic heater (with the windows open
an inch) and stayed quite warm.
