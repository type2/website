Subject: Ottawa area get-together/VW show
Date: Thu, 20 Jul 1995 06:40:50 -0400 (EDT)

For those of you in the Ottawa area and for those of you who would like to
travel there is a VW show coming up in the area.  August 19th &amp; 20th in
Embrum, a small place to the East of Ottawa.  Information can be had from
Robert Lyons at 613-443-1853.    There will be space for camping.  How
about all you Ottawa area listers make a get-together outa this?  Or for
that matter anyone else that wishes to come.  I will be going and camping
for sure so I am willing to co-oridinate this effort.  Waddayasay ?

Cheers

Frank
