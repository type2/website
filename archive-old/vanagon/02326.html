Subject: Almost free bus

Before you get all excited about the &quot;almost free&quot; bus (like I
did, planning trips to Urbana, scheming about how to tow it
back here, rooting around for mailorder oilcoolers etc.) here is
a followup post by the same author:
 
Begin included msg. (rec.autos.vw):
 
WEll, as you may imagine (or may not) I received a fair amount of replies
to this posting.  Unfortunately for the others, the first one came 1min 13secs
after I posted, and since it was a friend of mine, he got the car.  Now
I was wondering if any of you kind  urbana-champaign-ites would like to
help me and mon amie get the engine out?  Specifically, we are rather
tool-deficient: all I have is the jack that comes with the car, which is
great for tires but rotten for engine removal.  anybody know where I can
get a pair of screw jacks or something suitable?  As we are both pretending
to be rather busy, we will not be working on the car for another two weeks.
Thanks.
