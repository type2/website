Subject: 84 GL Exhaust System

 
WE&gt;I need to replace everything.  Front, back, connector, catalytic, muffler 
WE&gt;and pipe.  I've priced the dealer and would rather buy a nice used car.  
WE&gt;I've checked the Parts Place in MI and still find them high (plus have heard
WE&gt;one bad story about their exhaust components).  Now I'm thinking of having a
WE&gt;muffler/exhaust shop be creative and just put to-gether some pipes hook it 
WE&gt;all together and see if it works.

Parts Place sells DANSK, no worse than anyone selling Dansk, though
a better price may be available.  I am not overly impressed with the
Dansk
pipes but they are probably good as OEM.  This whole thing raises an
interesting question for me, Wasserboxer exhaust port same shape as
Bug exhaust port (tad bigger though), anybody know if width the same?
I mean flange to flange spacing, Even if not considering the bug slip
fit,
J-tubes and a merged header system with a bung welded right after the
merge threaded for O2 sensor, and a standard bug single side quiet
muffler
might be a great solution?  Could get the bigger tube performance bug
stuff to match ports better.  Anyone want to touch this, I am
admittedly WAY
out here.  But with the extracto pipe and muffler and J tubes totaling
about
$100 for reasonable quality stuff, and hell you can get the O2 sensor
bung
ready to weld on from anyone selling the Haltech O2 sensor add on kits
for
maybe $10, pay somebody $10 to weld it on, and you got the whole system
for about 1 tube cost (whoops, minus the converter, but one might work
it
in as well).
