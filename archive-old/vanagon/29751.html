Subject: Crazy Ideas for hot shower

     Bob,
     
     I like your &quot;crazy&quot; idea of using waste exhaust heat to generate hot 
     water for showers and other uses, but there are a few problems:
     
     1)  If you maintain the water under pressure of 30 psig (~45 psia), 
     you could end up with HOT! water with a temperature of 274 degrees F 
     at sea level (at altitude it would be slightly less).  This is much 
     too hot for safe use in a domestic situation (most home hot water 
     heaters will only heat to 180-185 degrees).
     
     2)  If you should have the unfortunate luck to rupture the tank or 
     associated piping (a definite possibility on rough dirt roads with 
     rocks sticking up) a good deal of the water will immediately flash to 
     steam.  If the ruptured tank empties into the body of the bus, the 
     occupants could be seriously burned by the hot steam.
     
     3)  In my mind's eye, I see you fabricating a piece of tubing into a 
     spiral and the affixing it to the exhaust.  Thermosyphoning won't work 
     well through such a device.  What you will get is vapor locks in the 
     high parts of the spiral whenever the water gets over the boiling 
     point.  These vapor locks will effectively eliminate natural 
     circulation.  Most of the thermosyphoning systems I've seen (like some 
     solar water heaters) have an easy straight shot thru the system piping 
     and are engineered or arranged in such a way that: 1) any steam 
     bubbles generated can flow easily and directly to &quot;headspace&quot; at the 
     top of the system or 2) the possibility that steam bubbles can be 
     formed in the first place is minimized.  
     
     If I was going to try something like this, I believe that I would use 
     a pumped circulation system, where the water is held in a storage tank 
     vented to the atmosphere, then pumped under pressure thru the heat 
     exchanger to achieve the desired (less than boiling) temperature.  I 
     would use type 304 stainless steel tubing for the heat exchanger - it 
     is much more resistant to overheating damage than copper or mild steel 
     tubing.  The pump could be mechanical, electrical, or vacuum-actuated. 
     
     I would control the action of the system as follows:
     
     a) start vehicle [15-20 minute timer starts].
     
     b) vehicle warms up completely and battery recovers from starting 
     [timer times out, allows circulating pump to start].
     
     c) pump circulates until water has reached desired temperature 
     [temperature switch in storage tank opens], then shuts off.
     
     d) pump comes on periodically to maintain tank temperature.
     
     Once the desired temperature is reached, the stainless steel heat 
     exchanger unit could be allowed to boil dry without excessive chance 
     of damage, as long as it was acid cleaned once in a while.  Also, the 
     motion of the vehicle should reduce opportunities for thermal 
     stratification of the water in the tank. 
     
     I would locate the storage tank in an insulated compartment in the bus 
     that would keep the heat out of the bus body when it's warm out - but 
     that could be opened in the winter to vent the heat into the bus body 
     in lieu of running a heater.    
     
     keep smiling,
