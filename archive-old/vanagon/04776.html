&gt;Anyone want to theorize all the bad things that could happen if
&gt;you add TOO MUCH oil to your vanagon/bus?

your vanagon/bus get these huge 'love-handles' over the rear fenders, and
wants to just sit in the garage and play with the remote control for the
tv. :)

i think it's pretty well be discussed already about too high an oil level
causing splashing and stuff inside, and the seals blowing out, etc. but i
thought i might point out here that it SEEMS that the type 4 engines are
a bit better able to handle SMALL over-fills than are the beetle engines.
at least in my own experience. ymmv.

and, of course, the water-cooled vanagon engines ... well, THEY can handle
just about as much oil as you can cram down into them! they are rough, tough,
and they know their stuff! (just as long as you tighten the head bolts and
use phosphate-free antifreeze and keep them the hell away from dealers! :)

eurovans never need any extra oil, cause you can't find anything in that
cramped engine compartment with that great big FIVE-cylinder engine turned
cross-ways in a tiny little space designed for a poor 4-cylinder diesel,
and besides, you have to move the radiator to change the spark plugs, and it
looks funny. ;)


hot diggity damn, folks: it's Friday!!!!
