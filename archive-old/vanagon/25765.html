Depends on where you live.  In B.C., 25 years gets you &quot;vintage&quot;.  I 
_think_ 35 years get you &quot;antique.&quot;  But the criteria for qualifying are 
pretty rigorous: must be totally rust-free, totally stock, etc.

A good thing about vintage or antique designation is that it exempts the 
vehicle from emissions testing.
