Subject: Thanks for the supercharger info. Ric


Thanks for the supercharger info. Ric, I sapose I should just shelve
the supercharger and wait until I build that Oval window bug I've 
been dreaming about during thermodynamics :)  I just got subscribed and
it's nice to have someplace to go for info. on stuff nobody around here
knows about (closest I got was a small VW shop who said, &quot;ya' I've heard
of them.....&quot;).
