&gt; &gt;Could someone explain to me how a rotor can go bad in 3000 miles?  Some
&gt; &gt;people replace them regularly whether they need to or not, others, like
&gt; &gt;me, haven't replaced one since electronic ignition!

&gt; well ... it all depends on whether it was an OEM Bosch rotor or some
&gt; copy from a local parts place. it also kinda depends on the car itself.


I used to be not-so-particular about what brand of tune up components I put
in my Bus. I'd buy whatever was on sale at the local FLAPS.  My mechanic at
the time taught me a lesson.  He pulled out a book and looked up the
resistance spec for a rotor for my Bus.  Then he measured the cheapo one I
was just about to put on my Bus, and a Bosch out of his inventory.  The
Bosch one was just about dead center within the range of what Volkswagen
said was acceptable spec.  The &quot;off-brand&quot; one was just slightly outside of
the range, even though brand new.  I threw it away and bought a Bosch.
