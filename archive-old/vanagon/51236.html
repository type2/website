I don't know EXACTLY why this happened, but it has to do with the 
required  recipricol bilateral destabilization of the thingamajig.:-)

Anyway, when on a business trip, I left the &quot;master&quot; switch on in
my Cessna Skyhawk. My battery was completely dead when I returned.. The 
Fixed Base Operator offered me a jumpstart, and the plane started, but 
the alternator would not charge (I had no radios, lights, etc, but the 
engine ran 'cuz a plane uses magnetos).

I remembered an article from an aviation safety magazine that an 
alternator needs a charge to make a charge. Something about exciting 
the magnetic fields. So, jump starting a dead battery might get the 
engine running, but the battery does not have enough juice to 
kick-start the alternator (It takes money to make money).  We 
quick-charged the battery and all was well.

Of course, this whole hypothesis is based on you having a Diesel....
