Subject:      parts for swap/sell ... square headlights??

well, i've decided that i'd like to have round headlights on my 87 camper,
so i'm gonna try to find some. but i thought i'd ask if there are any
round-eyed buses on the list who'd like to be a square-eyed bus??? if so,
wanna swap??  it involves a little bit of drilling (to mount a tab for the
4th screw to hold the headlight bracket ... both round and square brackets
have four screws, but the tab is in a different place: on one, it's on the
top; on the other, it's on the bottom. go figure.

also: i have another set of square headlights, that i took off my old 88
bus when i converted it to round lights. and the grill. but somewhere,
the chrome emblem in the middle of the grill has disappeared. and it is NOT
the same as the earlier grill emblems. :(

both of these would need to be swapped/sold to someone pretty close by ...
shipping that grill is NOT a good idea. it's about five feet long, and
would likely get busted up pretty bad by the cretin gorillas at UPS. so it's
gonna be someone in B'ham or Atlanta, most likely, where i can &quot;deliver&quot; it.

also: anybody need silver-framed sliding windows?? i've got two. in good
with good gaskets, but the gaskets are for the chrome trim ring (which they
do NOT have). the rubber is good, but the trim ring got messed up when i
was taken them out, so i threw it away.

last, but not least: power windows for the front doors. i've got all the
pieces (motors, regulators, switches, etc). except TWO dippy little parts
that the dealers never could find: a relay mounting bracket (that fits
somehow on top of the fuse box) and a relay that plugs into it. wonder what
would happen if that relay died?? how would they replace it? (if they can't
find one!!!???). anyway, it looks like i'm never gonna get around to putting
these windows into my non-powered window bus. :( so, since i need some money
to buy a power steering rack ... anybody want them?? it's about $800 worth
of parts. oh, if you have power mirrors, you won't need the wiring harnesses
(which i don't have ... cause i have power mirrors) ... the wires for the
power windows are already in the doors. also the wires for the power door
locks.

anybody want this stuff?? anybody CLOSE by?? :)
