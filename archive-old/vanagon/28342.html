Subject: Re:  Why VW's +T&amp;A??


All this back and forth on T&amp;A is amazing!  VW Trends has toned down 
the T&amp;A ten-fold since I got my first subscription in '86...and I'll
gladly send you the old issues on loan to prove my point.  You should
really view that magazine like a car wreck...wow thats something!  And
just move on to more important things...like voting,  saving the environment
and giving to those who don't have as much as you do.  I really worry
about those who linger at car wrecks.._dot_use their police scanners to find
wrecks...talk to friends about car wrecks...go to demo derbys and get
off on them...obsession on anything {  accidents,  porno,  and the
fervent elimination of either } is a large cross to carry.  I look
at VW T gather the info I need and go on with my life.  I really think
it would be the end of civilization when we all wear the same unisex
garb,  earn the same amount of money,  live in the same color house,
think of the fun!  Everyone driving Hondas and donning Rush Limbaugh
Ties...Lighten up...revel in Variety and enjoy what makes you happiest!
