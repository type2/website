Subject: Airflow problem?

I am new to this list.  I wish I had known it existed a year ago. I have a
86 Westy with what seems to be an airflow problem.  I bought the $100 add-in
harness for the air flow meter but it did no good.  I get loss of power and
black smoke from the exhaust.  If I turn off the key and reset the computer
while driving, everything goes back to normal for a while.  The problem
always returns in 30 seconds to 1 week.

Spraying the connectors with silicon seems to help for a short while.  What
is my problem?  What measurements can I make?  I don't think that I have a
problem that others have not encountered.  I saw a reference in another post
to an air flow problem.

I am going on a trip in 10 days, and need your HELP!!!!!!

Bill
