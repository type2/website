Subject: Re: Quest for Sound!

Cris,

I'm In the process now.  My auto sound guy got a pair of 6 1/2&quot; round
biaxial speakers to drop in the hole. the Brand is Boss, they do a good
job.  The biaxial is a seperate tweeter mounted atop the main speaker, but
still below the edge of the frame. They don't stick out. Worth the dough!.
I guess to the smaller stock speaker is also an option, I mean Boss makes
one that size too 4&quot; or 3&quot; round, but its so tiny.  Cost is $70 and less
for the big uns.  Any auto shop should be able to satisfy your desire to
maintain the &quot;it belongs there look and feel&quot;  My rear speakers are the 4&quot;
jobs in the A/C unit, I've seen the pods your refering to. My guess is the
auto sound guys can retro fit a replacement speaker in the box you give em.

  I'm going with the biaxials back there too, but keeping the 4&quot; size cause
the alignment is really good. Thats a good level one sytem for me.

 Level two is the subwoofer route, they supposed to do that tommorrow.  One
8&quot; under my seat, and one 8&quot; under the rear bench, the amp is  2 chanel
planet audio, at 200 watts. But I'd bet its more of the &quot;just enough to
make the subs do their thing in the loaf mode&quot;, rather than have to really
push a little amp and speakers. Also an active crossover to tune up the way
the freqs get passed to the speakers and thats my setup.

 Head unit is a clarion w/ 6 CD changer. Half of it sounds nice, I'll let
you know what the other half does.

&gt;Hi!
&gt;
&gt;First, I luv my bus.  85 Vanagon, brown, well loved.
&gt;
&gt;Anyway, we just got back from doing the Yellowstone-Teton loop, and I
&gt;realized something.  My speakers and radio need updating!
&gt;
&gt;Problem:  I don't want to have to replace the grills up front, or the pods
&gt;out back if I don't have to....so my question is:
&gt;
&gt;Does anyone know of a decent speaker set for installation in the old
&gt;hanging pods in back, and the grill door speaks up front?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks, if y'all can help!
&gt;
