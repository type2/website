Subject: shakedown 86 ASI

I cannot determine what would keep the rear seat in my 86 ASI conversion
from collapsing on impact on the passenger.  It has 2 lap belts, and no
apparent locking or fasteners for the seat.  It makes a great firm bed, but
is it safe for my 6y old?  Also after marveling at the swivel seats, the
only way I could get to the driver side battery was to slide the seat out
completely.  Is there an easier way?  When checking the battery compartment
I noticed about a 3 quarter inch diameter whole in the right front corner
which goes right into the wheel well.  Is there supposed to be some type of
plug in it?

I am still working on checking electrical shorts, and other suggestions from
the list, following the strange stalling experience I had during a downpour.
It is going  to take some trial and error.  The exhaust pipe entering the
catalytic converter was replaced which previously shot out exhaust gasses in
the vicinity of the oxygen sensor.  I haven't had the problem since.  Could
this have been a factor?  Sorry for the numerous questions.  Please feel
free to respond directly if it is most appropriate.

Many Thanks
