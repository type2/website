&gt; I was just curious if anyone has ever turned an air cooled vanagon into a

&gt; thinking about this.  It is one of those things I would probably never do,
&gt; but that doesn't stop me wondering about this.  The talk about installing
&gt;  suburu engines in the vanagon is what really sparked my curiosity.  I am new
&gt; to the list and vanagons, so forgive me if this is a dumb question.

Hmm...the V6anagon of Steve Mahre's was, if i remember, a aircooled 
origionaly...

and i've heard others saying that the 80-82.5's make excellent conversion 
bases, since they already have a place for a radiator, and such...(and 
you dont have to worry about messing with the existing plumbing...:)

all i know....david
