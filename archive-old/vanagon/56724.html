Subject: blinkin' light

Hello - I had to bite the bullet and get the head gasket replaced on my '84
Westfalia.  It's been a couple of weeks and no visible leaks of any sort
(I'm starting to resemble some sort of strange bird that keeps bending over
at the waist to peer under my van - aaak!).  The mechanic said the heads
were quite badly pitted (of course).  Anyway, several times since, the red
blinking water temp light keeps blinking for up to five minutes.  There's
plenty of fluid in the expansion tank and the tank by the engine.  The temp
gauge is normal to cool (below the level of the light).  Any ideas as to
what this indicates??  Something cheap and easy I hope??  Once the light
goes out, if I shut it down (ie, short trip to the store) and restart, it
usually goes out quickly.  She's going back to the shop sometime this week
but I wanted feedback from the group first.  Thanks a bunch!
