Subject: VW 1301 tool/gauge checking

OK, for you technoids out there... anyone got VW1301 tool, seems to be a
variable resistor that you connect instead of the gauge you are checking.
What I want to know is what are the resistance values (ohms) that this thing
puts out at settings of:

        50 - gas tank full / temp gauge at lower edge of red
        320 - gas tank empty
        510 - temp gauge at lower edge of white 

and any other settings that might be useful???

Now... why?  because after sticking in a new temp (gauge) sender I get the
same reading as the old when running AND yes the voltage stabilizer is spot
on for output, at 10.5v, checked that first, then blew the $21+4tax on a
sensor, grrrr...  ?? Bad ground straps??

Final questions, 

1) voltage at battery is 14.5 when running, 12.5 when off.  A-OK.  Voltage
at stabilizer is 13.5v running but floats +/- 0.5 volts when idling (fine at
1500RPM).  So why the floating? bad brushes? (belt fine/tight), out of round
pulley?  Gremlins?
2) the 1.0 volt drop is a pain, anyone run a new 'power' line to the fuse
panel or somehow got rid of this drop.  I don't want to just upgrade the
headlamp wiring with a new feed, what about new feed to entire dash/front
area??  Ideas?

Thanks folks, bye, tim
