Subject: Vanagon ASI Campers (and ASI poptop needed)

Any other listmembers out there have ASI Campers?
they were converted in Washington state.
a friend of mine on the T2 list has asked me to post this on the V_at_L.
He is also looking for a whole poptop section from a Vanagon ASI camper, as
his met an untimely end when the PO misjudged a parking garage overhead
clearance sign.... 
He would also enjoy hearing from other ASI Camper owners.

e-mail him at:
cheilan_at_aol_dot_com

thanks,
chris
