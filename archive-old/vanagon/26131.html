&gt; &gt;We often get those &quot;courtesy&quot; calls from other insurance or credit card

&gt; &gt;up when we mention USAA.
&gt; 
&gt; I have to add:
&gt; 
&gt; The other day I got a call from MCI saying they had a special deal for
&gt; me.  I told them I had a special rate thru Sprint with my insurance
&gt; company.  The woman thought for a moment and turned some pages, and then
&gt; said &quot;Through USAA right?&quot;, I said yes and she hung up the phone.
&gt; 
&gt; For once I like my insurance company.

I love to say the same thing when I am called.  Sprint/USAA even asked me
to call and give them a chance to respond to offers from other companys. 
I have yet to have the chance to.  the other company hangs up, too.
