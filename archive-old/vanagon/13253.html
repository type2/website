Subject: Canadian Westys

&gt;Harry writes about modifications to his vanagon westy including the ac
&gt;extension cord. Does anybody know why Canadian Vanagon westies have a
&gt;built-in cord? Is this why the access flap is down near the bottom of the
&gt;vehicle?

In most parts of Canada, not including Windsor or SW BC, parking lots
frequently have electrical outlets. These are courtesy of the government,
and are an encouragement to male Canadians to keep neatly shaven. Thus one
can park ones car and jump out and plug in the old electric razor!

VW, with typical Teutonic foresight and an extremely good sense of customer
relations, realized that in the cold climes of Canada, shaving would be far
more pleasant done inside the vehicle. Hence the cord.
