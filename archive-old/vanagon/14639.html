&gt; 
&gt; &gt;  Now that you've acquired all this experience and expertise, not to mention
&gt; &gt;  all this cool equipment, would you consider doing some rust eradication,
&gt; &gt;  dent removal and a beltline down paint job on someone else's needy bus in
&gt; &gt;  exchange for some frog$kins?
&gt; 
&gt; I guess I could be per$suaded...

  Thom,

  Thanks for your encouraging response. The rust I mentioned is under the
  rubber that holds the windshield in. It has not moved beyond the rubber yet.
  The dent is on the sliding door, lower rear corner, about 8&quot;x10&quot;x1/2&quot; deep.
  There are some little dings here and there. The previous owner took a spray
  can of touch-up paint to every little mark which gives it a spotted effect.
  The paint above the beltline is original VW and is in good shape. I have 
  about $1000.00 to spend on this work. A June/July timeframe would work 
  best for me - I need a little while still to get some new bearings into 
  my engine.

  So, Whaddya think?


  Dave
