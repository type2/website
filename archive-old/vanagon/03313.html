&gt;The difference is that the others are not meant as passenger vans.  They are
&gt;(with possibly an exception here and there) sold as delivery vans.  At least
&gt;that's how it was the last time I was there (1990).
&gt;
The Eurovan is also primarily a delivery van. It's available in short and 
long wheelbase versions, as a pick-up, a box van, a chassis-cab, etc.... ITS 
A VAN. You can buy all the vans I mentioned as passenger versions. Renualt, 
Citroen, Fiat and Peugot (as well as all the Japenese manufacturers) also 
sell 'minivans' that are designed solely as passenger vehicles and are less 
truck-like. VW is soon to introduce its own minivan. It's not a T4 with 
windows, its a completely different vehicle. You may not have heard about 
this in the US yet. Anyway, its a design shared with Ford :-( and apart from 
the badges and a few bits of trim they will be the same, even built in the 
same factory. 
When Ah were a lad it twer other manufacturers that copied t'VW transporter. 
Young folk t'day, they don't know they're born.
