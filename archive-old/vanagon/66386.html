Subject:      Don't be afraid to look at a dead ECU

About a year ago my 87 camper went DEAD.  No spark, no nothing-turned out=

to be a dead ECU.  A scenario followed that will be familiar to many
listmembers-nationwide parts search, finally got a used one and after wee=
ks
got it running.  I considered it an unserviceable black box and just put
the old one on a shelf in my garage.  This weekend I was piddling around
and, despite my  minimal knowledge of electronics, decided to take it apa=
rt
and see if there was anything decipherable that could be seen.  Sure
enough, between two contacts sat a tiny washer, the same kind of washer
that was used to hold the green board in place.  I removed said washer, p=
ut
this formerly dead unit back in the van and it started right up. Continue=
d
to restart on multiple tries.  Didn't quite have the courage to leave it =
in
and drive anywhere I couldn't walk back from, but I may have a spare ECU.=

Moral is- don't be bashful-look inside.
