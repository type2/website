Subject: Brakes inconsistent

My '78 (Murray) is braking rather irregularly these days. After long
highway sections (infrequent braking) the brake pedal sinks rather
close to the floor without producing much stopping power. The problem
is resolved after a pump or two when brake pressure is returned. I
thought at first that I had some air in the brake lines, so I bled them
without any favourable results (no significant air bubbles produced).
Next Bentley says that these conditions could be caused by the rear
shoes being out of adjustment. After adjustment everything worked great
for a few weeks. Now the problem is gradually returning. The lack of
pressure on first stomp of the brake pedal is very noticeable when
driving on rough roads i.e., gravel logging roads. On the rough surface
(very dusty too) the pedal will often bottom out without significant
braking effect. A couple pumps on the pedal produces the desired effect
(slowing down!).

Any ideas? Do I need to adjust the rear shoes again?

Thanks for any advice!

Mark
