Subject: Syncro &amp; Snow = Fun!

Hi All,

Driving my 86 Syncro to work today for the first time in another fresh
layer of snow was a blast!  Not having any slipping wheels was easy to get 
used to.  On the way home there was about 6&quot; of the fluffy stuff that was 
a real pleasure to drive through.  It was if the Vanagon said. &quot;Don't 
worry about this snow, it ain't a problem!&quot;.  8-)
