&gt;I am experiencing power steering pump noise in cold weather (ie below
&gt;0 F).  I see from some tech bulletins that other VWs have gone to

check the v-belt. mine makes a noise if i sit with the steering wheel turned
just a bit off-center, and messing with the belt (i.e., getting the tension
right) helps with it. it still makes the noise, but not as loud. i'm told
the noise is caused by a switch (triggered by the steering wheel being off
center) which tells the pump/somebody to do something harder.

&gt;Does anybody have info on this?  Found a product that works?  Why
&gt;NOT Vanagons??  I've got a 2.5 gallon jug of hydraulic fluid sitting
&gt;in my garage I'd love to use for this...

sorry. the power steering on the vanagons uses Automatic Transmission fluid
... Dextron II (or just Dextron).  check the owner's manual in the back.

one thing that might help the noise would be to have the fluid/oil replaced
and that little donut filter replaced. i've had mine done (at the dealer in
atlanta ... cause i keep wussing out at getting fluid all over the place)
every couple of years. it's just an oil, and those little seals might be
getting clogged with dirt/crud, just like the brake or clutch system.
