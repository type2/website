Subject: NetWisdom Needed: Rear Engine Carrier
Date: Thu, 30 Mar 95 14:40:16 MST

Well, I found out why my fan belt mysteriously smoked
and broke yesterday.....seems that the two top carrier
bolts on the '71 bus have sheared off at the case (the
bottom one pulled out of the carrier long ago.  I know
the proper repair would be to easy-out the broken part of
the bolt and replace the bolts. However, the bus is at work,
where I don't have easy access to power and the comfort of
all the tools in the garage.

Query -- can I put on one of those bug engine -to- bus
adapters (the ones that bolt to the oil pump cover), even 
though my case does have the casting bulges for the carrier
bolts? It would seem to be the best way to get the thing
home, where I could do the job right at a more convienent
time, but I'm worried about the adapter and hardware fitting.
If the collective wisdom is to pull the bus the 30miles home,
I might do that on Saturday.

Lemme know what you think, eh?  Thanks
