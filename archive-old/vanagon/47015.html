Subject: transmission leaking. WHAT TO DO??

First, many thanks to all who offered advice for the recent problems with
my '91 GL 5 spd.  The heads have been replaced and I'm working on the
intermittent starting problem.  Now, at 103,000 miles there is a 6 inch
diameter stain in my driveway every morning under the transmission.
Realizing that I am not mechanically minded and hire people to fix my
Vanagon, is this a big problem??  Is it possible to add a sealant??  Should
I plan on not taking the van on a long vacation this summer??  Thanks for
the help and if you need more info. please feel free to email me directly
with questions or answers.  I will be away however from July 24-30.
