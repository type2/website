&gt; 
&gt; yep today is ben Pon's birthday (1904)
&gt; 
&gt; I feel a tip of the hat is warranted to Mr. Pon. He is the man whose
&gt; &quot;drunken sketch&quot; resulted in the splits, bubble windows, bricks and
&gt; eurovans that we enjoy today.
&gt; 
&gt; here's to you ben!

Yes, we all should celebrate the geniuses like Ben Pon, but do include
everything else but the present day Eurovan.  Its about the ugliest
thing on the road today. Again this is IMHO, others may think otherwise.
