&gt; Now I am very frustrated. Any hints or help would be 
&gt;worshiped.

Nothing like a good machine shop.  :)

BTW,  Always lap the valves whenever they are removed.  If you install ANY
new components, the valves and seats may be off just a touch.  It only takes
a few moments.  Remember, there may not be time to do it now, but there is
always time to do it again when it fails.  Do it right the first time.  :)
