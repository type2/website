This is hog wash!  There's no analogy here.  Who is to say what &quot;Genuine&quot; oil
is?  Who is to say that it's any better if you could define it.  Performance
is what matters with motor oil, not sentiment as in diamonds.

If they discovered a 1000 cubic mile hunk of diamond tomarrow, and it's price
dropped to that of coal, would it still carry the sentiment value it has
today? 

But with motor oil there's no sentiment value and thus no analogy.

I've been using synthetic motor oil exclusively fo 10 years now and haven't
had a single leak in 5 vehicles and oil usage of 1/4 qt/5,000 miles in only
one.
