So Martha says:
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, I nominate that we go with the area Steve Johnson suggested
&gt; to the list.  Steve?  - can you help refresh my memory as I neglected
&gt; to save this, but my recollection is the area is east of Sacramento,
&gt; heading up toward Tahoe?

Judging the hot weather pattern for the past two weeks, the higher
the better I say...  The camping spots I mentioned to Martha and
not directly to the list is up near Wrights Lake.  The turn-off
is a few miles past Kyburz just before Strawberry on Hwy 50. 

Before I continue, Mr. Knoll pointed out that there is a current
restriction on camp fires, so I don't know if you-all would still
be interested.  Camping without a campfire?  Doh!!!  What's the
point?  Well....  I leave that up to you.  

Anyway if you drive up the road towards Wrights Lake (~ 8 miles of
25 mph road) You'll see some turn-offs that indicate primitive
camping.  Or.... If you make reservations, you can camp at the
Wrights Lake NP camp ground itself.  Pretty good elevation.  About
6000 ft.  I think.....
