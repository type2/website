Subject: any question for wheel

Hello to all

It is called Jos=E9 and I live in The Canarias Islands (Spain)

I have a [vw caravelle gl] 2.1L. and I/he/she/it/you want that somebody
responds me to a question.

I want to change the original steering wheel for another smaller, but
without having to make modifications, and if one could put one of
another model (Golf, Jetta, etc.).

Thank you
