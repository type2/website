&gt;On thing wrong with the ad is that we all know that Squarebacks do not get
stuck in the snow, I 
&gt;know I drive one between PA and Vermont twice a month.

&gt;Who cares.... Right Ric!

yes wildcelt,  I've seen it too,  as well as seeing many TV shows that are
featuring VW's more and more.  Have you seen the SEARS auto center Ads?
They feature a 21 Window deluxe as well as an early 60's beetle through
their flashing of many different genres of vehicle.
and BTW,  I have NEVER gotten stuck in any of my VW's either!!
