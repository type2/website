Subject:      Re: 30 fan fuse or circuit breaker

Fuses always do their job no matter what.  Circuit breakers can fail to open a
shorted circuit.  I would never use a self resetting breaker as it will only
delay the inevitable fire if you can not remove it quickly.  If the fuse
melts, something is wrong and it saved you from having to call your insurance
agent.  Breakers are convenience items for lazy people.  This includes the
wiring on your house.  In industrial applications, expensive motors and
electronic equipment always use fuses for short circuit protection.
