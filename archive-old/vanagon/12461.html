Subject: Re: Leaking oil seal

Marcus, I've seen this problem a couple of times and it has never &quot;cured 
itself&quot;. First, be certain it's engine oil. If you just rebuilt the motor, 
that's probably a good guess. I think your hunch that the main seal is shot is 
probably correct, but I bet its because (1) the seal was not install correctly, 
or (2) the gland nut was not put on tight enough. Number 2 is more common, IMHO.
You've got to torque that baby to 200+ (252, I seem to remember is the official 
number) ft-lbs. Otherwise, the flywheel loosens up and ovalizes the dowel pins, 
wobbles and breaks the seal. I've been through this, and its not a pretty site.

&gt; Dear list,
&gt; 
&gt; My housemate rebuilt his 1600 dual port, which he has put
&gt; about 500 careful miles on. It was rebuilt with alot of care
&gt; and purrrrssss as it goes, but (the big but) yesterday
&gt; a load of oil appeared to be working its way out of the bell
&gt; housing. 
&gt; 
&gt; This could be from the oil seal behind the flywheel,
&gt; but the engine oil is still a pristine green (on the dipstick) and 
&gt; the stuff being dropped is black. Could this be clean engine oil 
&gt; picking up clutch dust on the way out (would surely lead to clutch
&gt; slip?) or is it more likely to be from the gearbox?
&gt; 
&gt; Assuming it is the engine oil seal, we've checked the oil 
&gt; breather is ok to make sure that the crankcase pressure isn't 
&gt; forcing the oil out past the seal, and apart from that we are pretty
&gt; lost as to what may have caused the seal to fail at such a low
&gt; mileage. The local vw garage guy said he had had a similar problem
&gt; on an engine he had rebuilt and the oil leak had cured itself!
&gt; 
&gt; This isn't really something I can count on, so any ideas anyone????
&gt; 
&gt; cheers
