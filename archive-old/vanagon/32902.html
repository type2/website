Subject: 6V Starter --&gt; 12V battery?

I have a '65 Deluxe that has been converted to 12V.  Well, almost....
THe system is set up such:  2 6V batteries in series, of which the starter
and wiper are tapped off of the first 6V battery.  This allows me to have
a couple of 6V circuits to run the starter and the wiper.  Lately (given 
the cold weather - 6 F this morn.) I've been having trouble keeping charge
in the batteries.  Even a new Interstate (fairly moderate CCA) is not doing
the job.  I think for this system to werk well, the batteries should be
as identical as possible. (I seem to remember a thread on this a while back
but do not know the details as to why.)

I am contemplating to switch this set up such that I have one 12V battery and
replacing the 6V wiper motor with one out of a '67 (12V).  Can I keep the 
starter (6V) in this setup?  I am under the impression that the starter will
suffice as it is only briefly used (i.e., for starting) and the brief exposure
to 12V will allow me to get by for some time before I do this properly and 
replace the flywheel and starter to a 12V setup (in a few years?).  Is this
so?
