Subject: Kadron SP manifolds wanted


I have a pair of Kadron dual carbs for a 1600 upright-fan engine, and some
dual-port manifolds for mounting them. But, my bus has a single-port
engine! It runs very well, and I don't want to go to dual-port heads for
simplicity and strength. I know Kadron also makes single-port manifolds
for these carbs.

Does anyone out there have some single-port manifolds for these carbs
that they'd like to sell, or trade for dual-port manifolds? Any condition is 
OK as
long as they are whole. Any part of the country-- I'll pay shipping from 
your
place to here (San Diego).

Please reply with your Email address in your message-- our wonderful mailer
strips away all headers, to/from lines, etc., and feeds me only what it 
thinks I
should hear.
