So /m sez 

Anyone have a solar-heated portable, inflatable spa for about 20
people?

/m

As mentioned ad nauseam in previous posts a visit to a true desert oasis in 
Saline Valley is a possibility.  Solar nope, thermal yep, inflatable nope,
portable nope, very nice, holds many, has a 45mile dirt road access but 
it's always been worth it.

Real trees, real lawn, nice folks, absolutely free, mucho shade, formerly 
BLM=YOUR public lands, now part of Fineswine's ridiculous Desert Protection
Act and under the auspices of NPS.  

Available for the adventurous as a side trip.
