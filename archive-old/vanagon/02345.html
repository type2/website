Subject: NEATO dude in Albequerque

I recieved a call from the guy who did NEATO (Tom Brouette spelling?)
yesterday who I have never spoken to who called to say that he was in
Albequerque New Mexico now with a new business to rent VW Vanagon campers to
tourists!

This is especially amazine as NEATO stands for Northeast Association Of
Transporter Owners, originally a New England split window bus club. Tom said
NEATO now had 850 members and felt he was surpassing SOTO as the nation's big
split window bus club. 

Anyway, he said he needed some recall data on Vanagons since he now had a
little fleet of them and no technical information on how to fix them. I sent
him a disk with tech messages from this list and also a printout of Joel's
recall data.

He calls his new business Roman'Holiday.

I urged him to get on this list if he really had a fleet of vanagons to take
care of (can you imagine anything more horrifying) but he said he had no
modem and so he wasn't that interested. (???!!!).

Here is somebody who is making Vanagons their professional life as well as
personal space play area. Can you *imagine* trying to take care of a fleet of
abused Vanagons!
