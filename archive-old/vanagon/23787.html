Subject: Wierd looking things under my Thing

All,

Saturday, while working on the wheel bearings/brakes, I noticed some weird
looking things under the right side, in front(FIF) of the engine. One of them
I would assume is the starter, but it is bolted to some type of fluid holder
looking thing, and to the front of that is something that looks resembles the
reserve gas can in the trunk. I didn't stay to study them, as I was starting
to get dehydrated,no garage to work in :-(, so I cannot give any more details,
but if anyone has an idea as to what these are, please let me know.
BTW, the reserve gas can that I have is not the round ones that go inside the
rim of the spare, a la Kuebelwagen.

Thanks in advance,


David
