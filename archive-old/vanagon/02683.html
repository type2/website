&gt; 
&gt; Could someone send me a copy of the letter.  Not thinking, I accidently
&gt; erased it!!  I mean the one about AC.  Although I don't have it (this is
&gt; why I wasn't thinking and deleted it) I'd like to support the cause since
&gt; I'll probably buy a Westy w/ AC sometime.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Ken

Dear Sirs,

I understand you are now considering whether to off a kit to retrofit the
Vanagon air conditioning system so that it will take the new kind of freon. I
am writing to urge you to do so. I would definitely be interested. I have a
(year) Vanagon (camper, syncro, diesel, whatever).

                                           Sincerely,
