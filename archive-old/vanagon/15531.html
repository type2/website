Subject: Nice Bus, the book, Update #2

The on-line form is now fixed. I had some permission set incorrectly and 
the people in the computer center set me straight. Sorry to everyone who 
spent the time filling it out only to get bombed. Try again (please!) and 
it should work. I tested it with an account at another school and it 
worked. Thanks again for your interest. once again here is the address 
for the web site:

http://www.princeton_dot_edu:80/~sean/index.html

This address

http://www.princeton_dot_edu:80/~sean/surveyform.html

will take your right to the survey.

Cruisin'

Sean
