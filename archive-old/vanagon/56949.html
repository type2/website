Through a mishap which I don't even want to talk about, I succeeded in
burning out the ignition switch on our Vanagon. This switch is a part
common to several VWs. If you know what your doing, its less than 30
minute job so I got mine replaced in one and a half hours. 
First remove the plastic cowling from the steering wheel shaft
then the horn pad from the steering wheel.
Next remove the steering wheel.
Next remove the connectors to the various items clustered around the top
of the steering shaft (label them and note where they all belong)
Using an allen (I forget the size) loosen the clamp holding the ignition
switch to the steering shaft.
Slide the ignition switch up and off the shaft.
Replace the white plastic ignition switch attached below the key part.
And to quote all good manuals: reassemble in reverse order.

By the way with the key in and turned and just the plastic cowling
removed, it is possible to jumper the ignition and start the engine.
This is how we drove to and from the VW dealers to buy the replacement
switch. Check your Bentley for which contacts to jumper.
