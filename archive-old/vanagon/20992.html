Subject: re: Squirting water on an oil cooler

&gt;  The only problem with sqirting water on any type of radiator is that it
&gt;short circuits the cooling process and actualy makes an engine retain
&gt;heat.  If you keep the radiator nice and cool the engine gets really hot!
&gt;it's a short excersize in physics but if you think about it it makes a
&gt;lot of sense.

I can buy this if the thermostat is located in the radiator, thus it would
read a lower temp, and not cool as effectively, but (correct me if I am
wrong) doesn't the oil flow through the cooler regardless of the temp?


&gt;The reason your engine stays cooler when it's rainy is that the
&gt;humidity is very high and water vapor carries heat away from the fins
&gt;faster than air.  If you can find a way to prevent evaporation from
&gt;occuring on the fins when squirting the water it may actualy help but
&gt;I doubt it can be done easily.

The humidity when it rains point I have a problem with.  I have lived in
places where humidity and rain do not go hand in hand.  For example,
when I lived in Korea, there would be 90%+ humidity, yet it did not rain
everyday, and conversly when I lived in El Paso, TX, there was rarely a
rainy day where the humidity was high, or even mildly high.
