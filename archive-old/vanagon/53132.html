    What would you like to know? Why I can't stand Xmas? Or 
    what I did in the woods? 

    It Rained for 3 days. The leaves made it real slimy.  The 4x4 was 
    great. All the hard work I have into it payed off! I had 2 small
    problems. For some reason the fuel gauge is now stuck at full.
    I hit some real bumps that thru me out of place, that could have
    done it.
    The other problem was on the way into the woods, after a 75 MPH, 15 
    minute drive the oil light and buzzer went off as I was slowing down. 
    THis has had some discusssion before and I will have to check
    the archives.

    But all in all I has a great time! Didn't touch a computer or
    a wrench for 3 hole days!!!!! The smell of baked mud on the 
    exhaust was starting to get to me. My freinds ford truck on the 
    trails was  really hard to manuver, he admitted that he liked
    the Syncro better off road.
