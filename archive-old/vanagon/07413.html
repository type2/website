Subject: A/C and why?

Someone actually uses the A/C in their Vanagons?  Those Krauts
must have redesigned the A/C for the water-cooled vanagons.
In my '81 'falia (when I first bought it in '86) I would get
about 2 mpg w/ A/C on (well maybe a little more than 2 but not
much) and 15 mpg w/ A/C off.  Soon after buying it someone
mentioned that I would get even better milage by removing the
A/C belt.  I did and have had it off since and I get ~ 18mpg.
So just having the belt on makes those sewing machines they call
engines work overtime!
