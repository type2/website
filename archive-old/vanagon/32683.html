Subject: Re: Splittie in the Woods!

Dan, If you'll e-mail me privately with exact instructions on how to get 
to the splitty in the woods, I'll plug the info into my 
splitty-in-the-woods registry program and let you know whether or not it 
has the &quot;skylight&quot; windows. Remember, you must e-mail me &gt;&gt;privately, 
with workable directionss&lt;&lt; to get this info.

8) Yes, it's Friday! Joe

&gt; Whilst driving on my rounds today i spied a splitty sitting far back
&gt; in the woods, covered with snow.  It obviously has been parked for a
&gt; long time.  Now here's the great part...  there is so much snow on
&gt; the roof of this thang that it COULD be one of those with skylight
&gt; windows.  the anticipation of finding out is better than... well,
&gt; almost as good as certain activities. It has the swing open doors--
&gt; maybe all the splits have those, i'm really ignorant of the older
&gt; stuff.  the body looks stock and straight but it is a long way off
&gt; to see well.  
&gt; 
&gt; anyway, i would never have considered snooping around something like
&gt; this before my addiction to this list.  the last thing i need is a 30 
&gt; year old vehicle without a heater.  but by golly, i'm really begining 
&gt; to think splitties are cool!    :)
&gt; 
&gt; -dan (with babies to feed and drippy heads to fix am i being 
&gt; paternally responsible?)
&gt; 
&gt; ps.  it is painted a very light green on the top half and a darker 
&gt; green below-- about like a light olive drab, all very faded.  could 
&gt; that be an original color?
