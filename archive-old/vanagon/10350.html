&gt; I suppose this subject comes up all the time in this group, but here it is
&gt; again! I want a Westy tent!!!!! Needs to fit a 78 Westy. If anyone is
&gt; the owner of one of these and wants to sell it, PLEASE e-mail me.

Me too!!!  After getting rained on constantly in Pfeiffer, it suddenly
became more important to me.
