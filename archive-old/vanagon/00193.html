&gt;  Hi,
&gt; 	Further to my post last week about high performance versions of the
&gt; transporter (to which I've had no replies/followups: Humff, I thought it was
&gt; quite good! :-) 

Huh?  I don't remember any post like that, and I doubt I would have missed
it, since the subject interests me!

&gt;		I thought some of you might be interested to hear of a new
&gt; vehicle VW is releasing later this year. There was an article in this weeks
&gt; Sunday Times motoring section about a new &quot;People Carrier&quot;, seven seater one
&gt; box design that VW are producing in collabaration with Ford (VW design, Ford
&gt; production). Are these the cars that are called &quot;Minivans&quot; in the US, BTW?
&gt; Both will sell the car with slightly different trim (eg oval grille on Ford).
&gt; 
&gt;  There are several engine options described: 90bhp direct injection diesel,
&gt; 115bhp 2.0 litre (don't know if this is Ford's or VW's engine) and, of course,
&gt; the VR6! I assume this is the 174bhp VR6 from the Golf rather than the 190bhp
&gt; Corrado engine. Looks like VW are competing with the Espace after all.

The 115bhp 2.0 sounds like the VW engine that is in the current Eurovan...
&gt; 
&gt;  I presume this car is being prepped for European release, at the moment.
&gt; Anyone keen to see it in the US should probably start enquiring now! Note that
&gt; Ford-Europe and Ford-US are still pretty well differentiated at the moment
&gt; which may complicate matters.

And what a shame it is, too.  I wish I could get my hands on some of the
euro-Fords (lust lust).  I would give my right arm to get my hands (er, HAND)
on an early-eighties Capri 2.8i.

See ya,
	-David
