Subject: Re: Cost of fuel pump

I strongly agree with Tom.  Your problem may be a clog upstream from
your fuel pump.
I had a similar problem where the pump was wailing and the engine
dying.  Replacing the pump lightened my wallet, replacing the fuel tank
quieted down my now new fuel pump. (Rusted and clogged)  That was after
the dealer wanted me to buy ANOTHER new pump!
If you do need one, I bought mine at Advance Auto parts, it came with a
lifetime warranty at half the dealer price.

P.s. Tom, I found an article in a Harley mag about a company that can
take care of rusty tanks. Email me if you want me to hunt up the info.
