&gt; Does the Vanagon diesel have an inline-4 engine ala the VW Rabbit? I guess 
&gt; these were really slow compared to the gasoline versions. Would anyone 
&gt; recommend against owning one of these. I'm interested in any technical info 
&gt; and personal experience anybody has concerning Vanagon diesels.

The pros and cons of the vanagon diesel comes up for discussion every
so often here and on r.a.vw. There is a compiled list of some net.wisdom on:

	http://www.rpi_dot_edu/~bossoj/diesel.html

Jack Ewald has some more technical vw diesel info:

	http://www.fdt_dot_net/~crest/repair.html

The book &quot;Small Diesel Engine Service Manual&quot; Intertec 1991 has a 10 page
or so summary of the vw diesel engines sold in the US. Another book:
&quot;Diesel Fundamentals, service and repair&quot;, Bill Tobolt, 1983 has details
on the Bosch fuel injection.

&gt; PS: What years were these produced for U.S. consumption. Are parts for these 
&gt; readily available and are they extremely expensive compared to the gasoline 
&gt; versions??
  
Vanagons: '82 and 83 I belive. But engine parts are easy to obtain since 
they are the same as for the Rabbit/Jetta/Passat... etc diesels, which 
were sold in much greater numbers over a longer period of time.
