Subject: My bus is What???


The carefully rounded, fully-enclosed box shape    _______________
  with countoured outer surfaces                  /__||_||_||_||_||
  offers little resistance to wind.              |   |            |
The shape is pleasant and distortion-proof       `--( )------( )--'
                        --1960's VW Bus manual 

This is compared to what?  a LARGE brick wall
