Subject: Re: Dealers Dirty Deed!!!

Hi-

I just got a &quot;new&quot; '88 and went to change the oil yesterday and discovered 
that the drain plug was not only stripped, but they used teflon plumbing tape 
on the threads.  I have found at my FLAPS that they sell oversize drain plugs 
for many different sizes of drains.  This are slightly larger diameter with 
sef-tapping threads at the end.  I have not found the correct one for my bus 
yet, but will continue to look.  If you find one, buy two and I'll pay you 
back and vice versa.  In the meantime, I reassembled using teflon tape and 
_NO_ washer.  This allows the plug to get purchase on one or two threads that 
have yet to be mangled.  

Goog Luck!

David




&gt; OK folks, here's a nice one for you.  Last spring I had the dealer 
&gt; change the oil, sheer lazines/stupidity/etc.  It was wet and muddy in 
&gt; the drive OK? Today I go to change it again, I leave this coming Sat 
&gt; AM for 700 miles straight run. Funny, last 3 times I did the oil the 
&gt; bolt spun out with my fingertips, once lossened.  This time it took 
&gt; the socket wrench the whole way. 
&gt;  
&gt;   Drop the plug into the oil drainpan and think no more about it. 
&gt; After the oil has stopped dripping I wipe off the plug area, and into 
&gt; the threads a bit with a cloth.  HEY what are those bits of curved 
&gt; metal on the cloth!?? Yup pieces of the threads from the drain hole!!!!  
&gt; I dump the oil carefully into a container and check the drain 
&gt; pan carefully.  Lots of curved thread pieces, some the length of 
&gt; my fingernail. 
&gt;  
&gt;   The bastards tightened my drain plug enough to strip it out of the 
&gt; case, almost.  They may have used an air wrench on it. But it was 
&gt; done 'just right', tighten up until real tight, then twist it more 
&gt; until you feel the bolt go 'soft'. Not crossthreaded, a more 
&gt; professional job. Maybe I'm paranoid, maybe someone was having a bad 
&gt; day, maybe they were in a hurry, or maybe I've just been f*cked!!!  
&gt; This was discovered after closing time today, so tomorrow AM I'm going 
&gt; in to talk with them. 
&gt;  
&gt;         In the meantime can someone tell me the best way to fix this 
&gt; and properly.  Helicoil? larger tap size and fresh bolt? weld it up 
&gt; and retap/reseat? I don't dare have this shake out 15 miles into the 
&gt; woods, so its got to be solid.  Can't have it blow out on the highway 
&gt; at 4K rpm either!.  Suggestions folks?  Thanks.  Will post the 
&gt; dealer discussion and results tomorrow, meanwhile keep those 
&gt; letters coming.
