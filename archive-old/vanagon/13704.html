&gt; Please tell me its got grey headrests in the back seat....
&gt; 
&gt; Somehow the previous owner of my '87 weekender lost a headrest.
&gt; My back bench/bed has room for three, but only has two....Big deal you
&gt; say???.... Me too!!!  I don't know why it bugs me cause i never sit in the
&gt; back, but almost every time i look in the rear view mirror, i mentally count
&gt; to two!!!

I've got the cheapskate answer for you Joe.  Put the headrests on far left and 
right seats (leaving the middle seat headrestless) and call it a &quot;feature&quot; to 
improve rear-view visibility.
