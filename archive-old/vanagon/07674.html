Any recommendations on body shops in the Sacramento area?

I got rear-ended on the way to work this morning :(

I stopped at an intersection (Howe X Marconi) when I heard a siren,
so I slowed down, saw the ambulance, and then stopped.  The guy behind
me _barely_ stopped.  Well, the girl behind him didn't, and started a
chain reaction.

What made it funny was the ambulance was right in front of me when it 
happened, and he heard the crunches, and I got the see the look on his face
and I'm sure he got to see the look on mine!
