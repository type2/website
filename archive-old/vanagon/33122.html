Subject: re: new toy-- Fluke Mdl 78 Automotive DMM

Dan Houg writes of his new toy:

&gt;Just had to share this with a few that care!

&gt;I picked up a bran' spankin' new DMM specifically tailored for 
&gt;automotive use.  it measures frequency, duty cycle, dwell, temp, in 
&gt;addition to the usual fare.  Fluke's top line automotive DMM is the 
&gt;88 but at a list price of $479, i'd have to do dishes a LONG time in 
&gt;our house.  this model 78 has fewer features but i paid $239.

&gt;i'm so excited, i can hardly wait for something to go wrong!

Don't worry, Dan.  As we say in ham radio, &quot;if it works, it's a fluke!&quot; :-)
