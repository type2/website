well, that's why it's a 'nagging thought'. :) because of stuff like that.
kinda what i had more in mind was like a whole bunch of one-pagers, sorted
into chapters, and folks could print off what they wanted. sort of. kinda.
i keep threatening to do that to the bentley book: remove all the non-my-bus
stuff, so i don't have to look through all the air-cooled, syncro, and diesel
stuff when i'm trying to find something. it would also make for a much smaller
book. maybe even 3-ring binder size.

&gt;the movie rights (possible title - The Life and Times of Joel
&gt;B.Walker- roadside mechanic on the
&gt;superinformation highway and his trusty sidekick Gerry &quot;oilcan&quot; Skerbitz-with
&gt;Newman and Redford in the starring roles of course).

i think you have those roles reversed ... i'm more the kicker-of-sides type.
and, unfortunately, Wallace Berry is no longer available to play me. ;)

&gt;book needn't be fancy - ie. it could be a q/a type format in which case we
&gt;already have ALL the questions and ALL the answers in the archive. Its
&gt;just a matter of  selecting the good questions and editing them along
&gt;with the answers.....DC

and getting enough to cover most angles and problems. the biggest thing that
i see is diagrams/pictures. but if someone (or everyone, by the time this
begins to 'gel') has the computer power and scanner, etc. ... well, i guess
it wouldn't be such a bad deal.   i kinda just hate to think about it being
ONLY for those computer-literate bus-drivers ... but i guess that's really
what we have on the list, more or less.

&gt;Subcategories could be created (ie cooling system, brakes etc, extras, etc).
&gt;and the answers divided accordingly ( ie most commonly asked questions
&gt;blah blah blah). Since there are not that many vanagons in NA, the real
&gt;appeal and market  would be based on the inclusion of buses and water-cooled
&gt;buses/eurovans....IMHO - I'll have my agent call your agent and we'll do
&gt;lunch - Hasta La Vista Baby - DC

The Czech is in the Mail. trust me. :)
whaadayamean: not many vanagons in NA?? but that's why you need to be able
to 'pull' what you want down. maybe if it was 'freeware' or some such, we
wouldn't have to worry about royalties and movie rights. if we didn't charge
for it, can we steal stuff from vw to put in it?? :)
