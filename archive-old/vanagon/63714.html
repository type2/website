Subject: Re: Type IV engine - somewhat off topic.

&gt;      Ever drive a 914?  I liked it better than the 912.  Better handling; 
&gt;      peppy.  And it was less expensive to maintain.  What a sports car used 
&gt;      to be!

A 914-6 was for sale last week in San Jose, California (maybe it still is)
for about $13k.  914's did not all have VW typeIV engines -- these had a 911
engine, brakes, etc. in the tiny little 914 body.  Too much car for me -- 
I'm far safer in a VW bus.  Definately not less expensive to maintain, either.
