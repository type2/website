Joel, 

I noticed there's one less Aussie on the list. 

Do you know where he/she has gone? Will they come back?

I thought that there might be more of us Aussies on the list since one of 
the local VW mags gave the details of the list a couple of months ago. 

Maybe I should try and get the more prominent Aussie VW mag to run a story.

Compliments of the season to you and all the other vanagon list members.
