Subject: 70 mph bus trip gauge wanted or trade

I have a 70 mph VDO/porsch 356 spider trip gauge in my bus that i would 
like to replace with a stock trip gauge.  i have been told that my 
speedo is rare but do not know much more.  it looks loke a mormal trip 
gauge except that the reset knob is on the back side.  i would like to 
get a normal VDO 70 mph trip gauge to put in my freshly restored 60 crew 
cab.  prefurable i would like to trade, but an open to all interested 
parties who would like to trade are have one for sale.
thanks and God Bless
matt
