Subject: Vehicle value/price


&gt; Hi! I'm desperate and hope that you can help me! I need a source of
&gt;car/trucks prices; old vehicles, that is. I remember a magazine type that
&gt;had these but not the name. It contained prices for vehicles from the very
&gt;early 1900's to the present.
&gt;
&gt; Are there more sources of prices for antiques and collectibles? Would you
&gt;direct me to these sources? Thanks in advance.

_Hemming's Motor News_. Any decent newsstand.
