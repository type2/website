Subject: Re: Info on Vanagon/Audi 5 cyl Bellhous

&gt;That's interesting -- the diesel bellhousing will work for an Audi 5 cyl
&gt;conversion.  So I guess the block to bellhousing bolt pattern is the same
&gt;on diesel 4's as on the Audi 5?  I wonder if the SA 5 cyl. uses a special
&gt;sump that bolts to the engine and bellhousing like the 4 cyl. diesel does.

Please see my previous mail on this subject. VW SA uses different
bellhousings on their 1.8L Golf style engine (they wrote: weldone German
engineering, which means they use the old Diesel bellhousing) and the
2.6L AUDI style engines (they wrote: perfect enhancements done by South
African engineers).

&gt;What about the starter?  On the diesel 4 bellhousing, the starter is on the
&gt;transmission side of the flywheel.  On the 5 cyl. I think the starter is
&gt;always on the engine side of the flywheel.  There must be some
&gt;starter/flywheel combination that enables the 5 cyl. to work with the 4
&gt;cyl. belhousing.

The starter on the 5 cyl. you will find at the same place as on the original
AUDI setup: left down beside the oil pan, on engine side of the flywheel.
The starter of the Vanagon Diesel is on top of the flywheel, on transmission
side. You will find both pictured at the sites I wrote in the previous mail.
Because of the starter arrangements, I don't think that the Vanagon Diesel
bellhousing will fit to the AUDI 5 cyl.

&gt;Any information to clear this up would be appreciated.

Hope this helps,
