&gt;Hi Joel,

&gt;I called this Stnls Stl Brakes Corp and the fellow insisted they have
&gt;nothing to do w/ gas tanks or carriers of ANY type, spare, imported, etc,
&gt;etc, PERIOD.  Is there a certain person i should ask for?  I really do want
&gt;one of these tanks.  I did check w/ Griot's Garage, and they do have them,
&gt;but at $79.95+12.95 shpg.  Guess I'll do that if necessary.  TIA.

They used to carry this, but no longer do so.  I've removed the listing
from my vendors list, and I'll add the Griot's Garage listing as soon as I
get the catalog.
