Subject: Re: Netiquette Help Please--Mail List Filters

You need to get the commercial version of Eudora which supports filters or
get the shareware Pegasus that does the same. All your list email will be
filtered into its own &quot;Email In Box For Vanagon List&quot; and your regular In
box will contain only mail addressed to you personally. That way, you can
quickly delete the 90% of Vanagon mail that does not interest you (based on
its subject) but be able to read all the mail addressed to you personally,
even if the subject line does not at first look interesting.

&gt;Is there any way I can sort out who e mails me direct, and which e mails come
&gt;via the Vanagon list?
&gt;I think I have replied to people via Vanagon when they may have e mailed
&gt;direct! (90% of our email is VW related, my lady wonders if she is the only VW
&gt;widow, I think not!!) Cheers! Dave.
