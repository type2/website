In a message dated 97-04-03 11:30:05 EST, you write:

&lt;&lt; Front wheel drives tend to run a large offset in order to make the
half-shafts as long as 
 possible to minimize angular deflections. &gt;&gt;

the only question I had was about the 7J. 
Audi 5000 TURBO wheels AND Vanagon Carat Alloy wheels are both 6J.
The new Audi &quot;A series&quot; wheel is a 7J.

Remember - the Audi 5000 TURBO wheel WILL fit a Vanagon (done the conversion
already, per previous thread(s)

But is the difference between 6J and 7J really significant?

and what does the &quot;J&quot; refer to anyway?
(or did you explain that before..)
