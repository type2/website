Subject: VW awning?

Ever heard of an &quot;A&amp;E&quot; awning? Saw one for sale in the local ad circular, 
$125, apparently it clips onto the rain gutter. It's an awning only, no 
walls/sides. Worth it? Not worth it? The couple who ran the ad said 
they'd used it with their Vanagon. No, I don't have the money, but if I'm 
going to be living in my Westy I wouldn't mind having some shade... hey! 
what will I do for Internet access? Holy sh*t!!!
