So Thom Fitzpatrick says:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Manteca (where I grew up)  Is the fog capital of the
&gt; &gt;world!   Trust me....
&gt; 
&gt; Well, that might make sense, since manteca is Spanish for &quot;lard&quot; which
&gt; is what the fog in the valley gets to be like sometimes...

Gee, that's only the 2,985,456th time I've heard that!

Yuk, Yuk,
