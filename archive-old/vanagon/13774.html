&gt; 
&gt;   Are we still welcome?

Hell yeah.  We'll even give you a lift if you want.  If there's any 
large stuff you want delivered... get it to me by Wedensday night.

If anyone else wants a ride... ask!
 
&gt;   Will we be teased incessantly for the entire weekend if we show up in a
&gt;   &lt;gag, retch&gt; Oldsmobile station wagon?

No more than someone that might get stuck with a can of prunes.  :)
 
&gt;   Is anyone thinking of bringing mountain bikes?

I thought about it, and then decided my bike is in bad shape.  I have 
street slicks on it right now, and my off road tubes seem to keep going 
flat.  So... unless a few more people tell me they are bringing one, I'm 
not. 

&gt;   How stupid would I be if I was to pretend I never saw those bits of metal,
&gt;   put fresh oil and filter on my bus and take it Red Rock anyway &lt;round trip
&gt;   750 miles&gt;?

Do you feel lucky?  Well, do ya punk?  :) (Sorry, Clint cliche) I would
have driven it around town for a couple hundred miles, changed the oil
again to see if I see more metal, but it's to late for that.  So... I
think the shavings might be bearing (I've had that before).  And if it is
you might hear a knocking.  It will still likely go the 750 miles.  I like
to think of worst case senerio... it breaks along the way, then you get a
new engine, or abandon the whole vehicle.  If you caravan then you have a
ride to the phone and Red Rock.  :) Best case senerio is that it's
nothing, and you'll be fine for another 250,000 miles.
