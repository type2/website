&gt; Well, I really have no place to store it, but I'm going to be picking
&gt; up next week sometime, a  No motor, little rust, no sink/
&gt; icebox, poor interior, poor exterior, no canvas (what's there is rotted
&gt; away), straight (this is good, at least!), no lenses (I have some),
&gt; sitting-in-someone's-backyard-since-1990, 1971 Westfalia. For 50.00.
&gt; (And the VIN's even match each other, and the title!) I just hope
&gt; my wife doesn't find out about it.

While on GNATT I saw a parts westy that was in good shape except for 
rust and lack of motor - it's just South of the Calif/Oregon border
and appears to have a non-westy fridge/stove similar to what I have in
the Safare.  I think it is destined for the junkyard, so the guy would
probably sell the whole thing for like $100.  I have his number -  if
anyone wants it, just email me privately.  It's too far from San Diego
for me to get it.  :(
