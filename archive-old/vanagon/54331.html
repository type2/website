Subject: Hello, I'm a new boy here...

My name is Johan Nyberg, I'm male, 34 years old, married with 5 kids.
The last item is my reason for owning and maintaining a '86 Caravelle C,
112 hp 2.1 litre, mostly &quot;Pastellweiss&quot;, no catalyst, Digijet, Volkswagen
van.

We live in the south east of Sweden, off the Baltic, in a rural area. We
use the van for transport, not recreation, though I have thought about
taking out the seats, build some kind of bed and run away with my wife,
sometime:-)

I try to do all the maintainance and repair work I can manage, partly
because I like to, partly to be able to afford this car, which is very
expensive to buy and repair here in Sweden.

I really look forward to take part in this forum.
