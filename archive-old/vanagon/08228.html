Yes! (but I haven't yet, only thought)(read on)

&gt; If so where would you put them (it)? One big guy
&gt; right on the roof? 

Yes, and aim it 500' up-road and slightly left. 
First, you give the idiot with his high-beam halogens a polite flick of 
the brights to remind him that he isn't alone.  Then, if he fails to dim 
his lights, you go to full time brights.  If this doesn't wake him up, 
bring out the BIG guns - 500 watts! 

&gt; or two smaller ones on the bumpers. 

in the back, with a rheostat, same scenario, brighten them slowly 'till 
he gets the message.

&gt; Would they be
&gt; sufficient to stop deer in their tracks...just kidding....DC

Also yes, the only possible drawback.

Sorry, volks, I am in a foul mood. My pet peeves in order include people 
with their brights on in traffic and sloggers in the left lane (way  more 
common here on the east coast than anywhere west of the Appalachians.  
(It's a Boswash thang, you wouldn't understand){and thank your lucky 
stars you don't}.  

This whole discussion of H-4's and 100 watt halogens is comprehensible to
me if you are doing the Sacramento-Needles run overnight, but I burn with
barely suppressed rage at those with Halogen brights, driving lights, and
fogs, all burning, driving thru downtown DC.  (not you DC, the DC I live
in).  Sorry, you can come out from behind the doors now, honest, it's
safe......
