&gt; I just had a 74 Bug I'm thinking of buying checked out.
&gt; 
&gt; The mechanic says it needs:
&gt; 
&gt; 	back up light repair	$32
&gt; 	brake pedal sticking	$72
&gt; 	muffler		$160
&gt; 	engine seal		$40
&gt; 	alternator belt	$22
&gt; 	shift coupler/bushing	$100
&gt; 
&gt; He says the compression checks out at 135, 150, 130, 110.
&gt; 
&gt; The owner is asking $1650.
&gt; 
&gt; The body is in decent shape (it was a Floridian before moving to Michigan last
&gt; year).
&gt; 
&gt; Should I go for it?  What's a fair offer?

Sounds like too much to me.  I think I would look for an older bug anyway...
The compression doesn't fit the old &quot;15%&quot; guidline either, and that's not
a good sign...
