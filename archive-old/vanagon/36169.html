So DHaynes57_at_aol_dot_com says:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Ummm.... In my dictionary 'permanent' means to last 'indefinately' without
&gt; &gt;change.  Does VW use a different dictionary or is this 'newspeak'?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Steven 
&gt; 
&gt; The automobile industry refers to permanent antifreeze as the all season type
&gt; that rplaces alcohol.  I have an antique car,(1923 HAYNES) whose owners
&gt; manual recomends filling the cooling system with Karosene for winter
&gt; operation.  They also warn you not to boil the system!!!  Fire hazard or
&gt; something to that effect.
&gt; Dennis.
&gt; 

Okay, I guess I've been verbally spanked enough on my response to this one.

Thanks for the clarification,

Steven
