&gt; Hi all,
&gt; 
&gt; Anyone out there know the cooling flow characteristics of the 36 hp fan
&gt; shroud vs. the newer squatter styles?  I am wondering if the shrouds
&gt; basically flow the same amount of air, or did VW improve the flow when they
&gt; changed the design?  Also, some of the aftermarket shrouds I have seen look
&gt; very cheaply made.  Any recommendations on aftermarket suppliers who make a
&gt; quality shroud? Do some of these suppliers have doghouse styles with the
&gt; 36hp shape?
&gt; 
The interior design changed with the doghouse oil cooler.  When the 
cooler was moved it affected  the air flow around the cylinders. VW added 
flaps on the inside to redirect air to the cylinders.  the CBN  news 
letter just did an article on this issue, i'll check it out and see if it 
has anything else.
