Subject: Re: EuroVan Pison Slap diagnosis

&gt; Another question: is there anyone at VWoA, other than the people that answer 
&gt; phones, that you can get to when you need to lean on the dealer?  How do you
&gt; get to the regional service rep?
&gt; 

You DO NOT, it is against their company policy, once had an 
interesting discussion with an ex VW dealer service manager who had 
worked at two seperate dealerships one in WV, one in FL.  His 
opinion, the DSM's were ASSHOLES across the board.  He gave 
some interesting documentation of this fact.  Still some dealers go 
to bat for you, some try to BS you with miracle carbon breakup out of 
a can stories.  Utter rot and the reason VW will still die in this 
country, despite their minor resergence last year to 300,000? units.  
The dealers and service still suck, all the 10/100000 mile warranties 
will not change this, once something marginally powertrain fails and 
you are stuck holding a $500, $1000, $1500? bag.

did I mention I might still be a bit bitter about the Corrado and 
&quot;secret&quot; recalls.
