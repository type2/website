Subject: chrome strip


Hi people,

  I just called my dealer and they want 20 bucks for the locking strip 
that goes around the windshield on my 83.

  Do any windshield experts know if this strip can be replaced without 
removing the windshield?  I thought I could lube it up with some KY jelly 
and pop the new piece in!
