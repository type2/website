&gt; Date: 5 Jul 1995 18:22:22 -0400
&gt; 
&gt; Any Eurovan owners out there with vans which stall after 45-120 seconds at
&gt; idle?  The van starts immediatly, but the stalling can be annoying when
&gt; pulling into traffic....
&gt; 
&gt; If feels like lack of fue, may be temperature related. Please reply via
&gt; email if you've had this problem.
&gt; 
&gt; many thanks,

I have had problems with running the air-cond. and having it pull down
the engine during an idle stop.  You can see the rpms drop down and
then back up.  I ran the van for two years before it started doing
this.  I just so happens that it started this right after the
30,000 mile tune-up at my VW dealer.  Two trips back to the dealer
and they still don't have it running like it did.  They claim they
even called the VW technical line to get info. on what to do.
