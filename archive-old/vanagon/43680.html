Subject: RE: In search of '86 Vanagon Air Cond. compressor.


&gt;I need to replace the AC compressor on my '86.  It is made by Sanden and is
&gt;a SD510.  Problem is the local VW dealer quoted me $603 (!!) and another
&gt;$150 (!) for the new reciever dryer!  This seems excessive


I once saw that JC Whitney had AC compressors for various cars, and
I believe that Sanden was one of the brands mentioned. Sorry I don't
have a catalogue, but if you can find one, it might be worth looking
up. Prices were a lot lower than $600, as I recall. Hope this helps...
