Not exactly a van song, but we did buy a '71 Bus to replace the
Squareback...


To the tune of &quot;My Bonnie Lies Over The Ocean&quot;


Our Squareback was born o'er the ocean
A German beauty was she
One Halloween night in Washington
Our poor little girl ceased to be

   Bring back, bring back,
   Oh bring back my Squareback to me, to me
   Bring back, bring back,
   Oh bring back my Squareback to me

All dressed up for a night of haunting
All four of us kids in the 'Back
Mother never saw what was lurking
Up ahead by the side of the track

   Bring back, bring back,
   Oh bring back my Squareback to me, to me
   Bring back, bring back,
   Oh bring back my Squareback to me

An escaped Angus bull feeling flirty
Looking for heifers in heat
We hit him broadside doing thirty
'Twas end of that night's trick-or-treat

   Bring back, bring back,
   Oh bring back my Squareback to me, to me
   Bring back, bring back,
   Oh bring back my Squareback to me

The very next day the truth hit
The front end smashed beyond repair
Our sweet squareback couldn't survive it
Gundy's Boneyard took her under his care

   Bring back, bring back,
   Oh bring back my Squareback to me, to me
   Bring back, bring back,
   Oh bring back my Squareback to me

My memories are fond of that Squareback
Not everyone that night does (I hear)
That Angus must hate our old Squareback
See that bull is now just a steer

   Bring back, bring back,
   Oh bring back my balls to me, to me
   Bring back, bring back,
   Oh bring back my balls to me
