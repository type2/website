Subject: Curtain sizes on late 70's Westy

Hi all, Lief is in for body repairs suffered during his first road trip to 
Whistler.  My problem is this.  We bought material to make curtains and Caron 
wants to start on them today but we haven't been able to measure the existing 
curtains yet.

If anyone has a late 70's Westy (Lief is a 77) sitting outside in their 
parking lot or driveway could I ask you to do a couple quick measurements for 
me.  Just the back window curtain would be good enough to get us started.

Just measurements AF and AD and EF and BC.

Thanx.  Otherwise we'll have to try to get out to the body shop in Surrey and 
measure the ones in Lief.
