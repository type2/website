Subject: EV - THING Demographics

Since Ric's note ....

I guess I can't stay in the closet longer ;)

I have a EV-THING fetish.

I just LOVE the double-takes and stares of dis-belief we get while
moving down the highways and boonies in our Eurovan with the &quot;Play&quot;
THING in tow.

It's really NEAT to pass a big truck or two on the interstate (going
uphill, of course) then listen, silently on the CB at the comments being
made.

We like to move along at a decent pace to get to the next campground
then 'drop' the Eurovan, unhook the &quot;Play&quot; THING and move out at
Tourista speed; let the wind aero-dynamically slide off this old balding
head while we enjoy the sights ...

and being 'sighted' by the on-lookers who are reminiscing about the Good
Ole' Days, whey they rode in a THING.

LIFE IS GOOD!!

Regards,
