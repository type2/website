Subject: Sources for heat exchangers/exhaust parts?

Since we need to replace the engine in the '81 Westy, the exhaust system 
from the heat exchangers up needs to be replaced too. Some heat would be
nice. Anyway, anyone know some good sources for heat exchangers? I'm
not sure what quality J.C. Whitney's are. Also, has anyone had any
experience with the one piece muffler systems I have seen? The ones
with the wlbow, muffler, tailpipe all-in-one. They look cost effective,
but are they any good? Can they be used with heat exchangers? Any
help with this would be appreciated. Thanks!
Lisa
