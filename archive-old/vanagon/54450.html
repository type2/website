&gt;Hello. My wife would like to keep her behind warm in the winter, but the

&gt;seem to find an open circuit, if so, I suppose something has broken and

Have repaired a number of seat heaters when I was at the dealer, I should
say replaced. At least on Audis. Odds are the problems as well as the
vendors are probably the same. Ninety nine percent of the problems are in
the heating element itself. If you have power to the element it's bad. All
the element is is a resistive wire sewn in between a cloth covering. When
you take the seat cover off usually you can see a spot where the wire has
burnt, it burns the cloth. I often though of just taking the cloth cover
off a bit and repairing the open circuit. But the repairs were under
warranty and since Audi was buying I never tried it. Not sure if it would
work but I don't see any reason why not.
