Subject: Kennedy Engineering phone number?
Date: Tue, 15 Apr 1997 12:38:11 -0400

Hi Volks,

Does anyone have the phone number for Kennedy Enginnering?

I haven't found them in any of the various search engines yet, so I assume
they don't have a web page?

Has anyone dealt with them? Opinions?

I need to buy some parts for the '79 Electric Bus I bought through Dave
Easterwood. Anyone dealt with any EV suppliers yet?
