Subject: RE: restoring interior chrome

BRENDAN,

Use Brasso....  be careful not to get it on anything else... it stains.  It 
works very well without all of the fine scratches from scouring!

I am sure you folks with the later VW buses don't have this problem, but
recently I've taken on the chore of restoring the interior chrome in my bus.
I've tried several methods and have had varying success, can anyone offer
the best solution? 

On the alumunin luggage bars I've tried two meathods; (1) used a toothbrush
size wire brush and scrubed off the oxidation and then used Wenol; a polish.
This works well but you can see the fine scratches from the wire brush.  (2)
used 1000 grit sand paper and then use polish.  This works well (you don't
see scratches) but it also leaves a foggy shine, I think it has something to
do with the sand paper.

On the window latches and steel parts the wire brush works well, but I'm not
satisfied with the look on the alumunin. Is steel wool a good meathod?  

Also, I'm trying tho clean the headliner the best I can.  I've used foam
upholstry cleaners, and simple green.  My headliner was installed new in '87
and has upheld very good, but I am trying to find something that will bring
a brighter white back.  Any ideas on cleaners that are good in lifting dirt
would be helpful.

Any other tricks on interior cleaning/restoring would be great!

Thanks,
