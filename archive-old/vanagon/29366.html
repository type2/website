Well, it looks like we'll have a sizeable turnout for the Pfeiffer/Big Sur
reunion/anniversary trip.  The date seems to work out for the majority by
far, so I vote we consider it firm:  January 5-7, 1996.  Here's who
plans to attend:

John/Carol Hugenard    hugie_at_lindy.stanford_dot_edu/carol_at_tonto.stanford_dot_edu
Martha Rubin           busgirl_at_netcom_dot_com

Last year, some of us bothered to make reservations thru MISTIX ahead of
time.  I suspect that this may not be necessary, given how deserted Pfeiffer
was last year, but that may have had something to do with the weather.  How
do you all feel?  Should we go thru reserving again this year, or just take
our chances?
