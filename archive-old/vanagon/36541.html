&gt;Here is a modest proposal:

&gt;To remedy this problem, I propose we classify ourselves, the listers, into 
&gt;four catagories: Ancient Listers (AL), Early Listers (EL) Medium Listers 
&gt;(ML) and Late Listers (LL). You can  use  the following descriptors to 
&gt;determine personal list catagories (LC), then simply attach  your LC  to 
&gt;your signature line. Whenever you see a post  that an &quot;early bus&quot; or 
&gt;whatever,  has been sighted, you can check the author=92s LC to decipher the 
&gt;message into terms that are meaningful to your own personal perspective.

I think this was kicked around a while ago but how about just putting a [T#]
somewhere in the subject line of your message where # is the type of bus you
have.  Some people already do this and it's extremely easy to eliminate
messages that don't pertain to your particular ride/interest.

T1=Splitties
T2=Loaves
T3=Vanagon
T4=the ones with the $7000 trannies

This would drastically reduce the number of message filters I currently
have, I don't know about the rest of you.  I like it!  It even sort of seems
like my idea!

Sample heading:
[T2] - '79 Bust, still rusty after all these years        or
'79 Bust, still rusty after all these years [T2]
