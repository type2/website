Subject: Re: LDT (Long Drive Theory) and other musings

I would imagine my/our experience is unusual, but we had an '84 Toyota
Tercel that I absolutely hated.  (It was Da Spouse's car when we got hitched)
The Turdcell had constant overheating and steering problems, was as much of 
a dawdler as my 68 Bus (OK in a Bus, but I won't tolerate it in a much 
smaller, lighter car) and got poor gas mileage (21 mpg with a 5-speed).
To top it off, it was a shockingly ugly car, IMHO and the dealer was
rude and specialized in hiring incompetent mechanix.  It died a derserved
death at 123,000 and Da Spouse bought a Mazda 323--troublefree for 71,000
thus far.  

Of course, it's still boring and now we're looking for yet another Bus (or
maybe a Vanagon) to replace it.
