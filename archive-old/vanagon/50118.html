Subject: help 82 diesel head gasket


 I am working on it now, I am takeing the head off and I have notoiced that
there two holes in the head (near the hole off to the side, next to where
the notches are)that are not in the head gasket (the bently book does not
show holes there ether).

        Should I punch holes in the gasket to match the holes in the head?
