Subject: Denver to KC

Volks Folks,

Looks like I'll be headed to Denver to pick up a new VW over the Thanksgiving
Holiday weekend.  Right now I am trying to decide wether to fly out and drive
it home or drive out and tow it home.  If I decide to fly &amp; drive, it sure
would help my &quot;comfort factor&quot; if I had a few folks along the way who could
offer emergency assistance if &quot;just-in-case&quot; I should happen to need it.  It
is a nice one so I shouldn't need any help, but you never know.  So, if there
are any kind Volks Folks out there living between Denver and KC who would be
willing, I would really appreciate having your name and phone number.

BTW, anyone else making this trip?  Wanna caravan?

-Dan
