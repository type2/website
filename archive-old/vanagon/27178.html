Subject: Color sanding? good/bad?

&gt;Subject: Re: Color sanding? good/bad?

&gt;Jim, I have had a hellava time with the color coat on a 57
&gt;vw.  Even with 1500 grit if you arent careful you will go
&gt;through.

With just about any abrasive, *careful* is not a strong
enough term.  It takes very little to get through paint.
Sherwin-Williams Kem Transport enamel is recommended at 2
mils thick.  Ditzler recommends maximum thickness of the
same.  Even with two coats, we are talking 4 mils (.004
inches), so sanding can get through it *real* fast!

&gt;Also another thing that has been a nuisance is
&gt;solvant bleed thru.  It creates a bunch of little pits.

Is this solvant from primer, sealer or just from rub-down?
For cleaning between coats I used a *quick dry* reducer, not
the same reducer I used to thin the paint. By the time I
went over the surface with that and a tack cloth it must
have all evaporated.  I did not have this problem at all.

&gt;Cant get the damn things out.

Want to know what the book says?  Yes, I have a book,
I am not afraid to admit it.

     %Figure 29-21.  Blistering.  Bubbly or swollen
     appearance is caused by:  trapped solvents;
     painting over grease or oil; rust under surface;
     moisture in spray lines; prolonged exposure of
     film to high humidity.  To repair, remove all
     blisters by sanding.  If necessary, sand to bare
     metal.  Refinish.  To prevent blistering:  clean
     and treat metal thoroughly; allow ample drying
     time between coatings; drain water from air lines;
     if temperature and humidity are high, use
     overly fast thinners.%

&gt;I have been using SIKKENs
&gt;brand paint (supposed to be about the best).

I havent heard anything bad about SIKKENs, but I am not
familiar with it personally.  If you like it, use it *and*
use it only.  Problems can arise if you mix one brand with
another.

Are you in NEATO?  One of the newsletters includes the
chapter I wrote on restoration of my 1967 Deluxe and the
multi-step process I used for painting.  Dont get me wrong,
I am no pro, just anal retentive.
