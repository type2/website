&gt; After searching the archives about Syncro driveshaft vibrations I've come to

&gt; can locate a replacement.Do Ineed to go to a dealer or is there an after
&gt; market source?
&gt;  Any help or even any other tips are as usual greatly appreciated.

    Check with Dennis Haynes. He can get you new joint for 
    your shaft.
