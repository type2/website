&gt;My 86 $yncro has 110k on and I have not had any problems with the heads.  I 
&gt;hear all these horror stories about getting the heads done.  I want to know 
&gt;what causes the problem.  A long time ago someone told me it was due to 
&gt;electroysis, something to do with the water.  So I have never put any water
&gt;in 
&gt;and have not had any problems yet.

You say you never use water.  What do you use?  Water is a better conductor
of heat than antifreeze.  Straight antifreeze will freeze,(actually become
slush) and boil at lwer temps.  Water and antifreeze when mixed actually
chemically combine to produce mixture that freezes and boils at extended temp
ranges.  Concentration greater than 70/30 reduces protection factors.
