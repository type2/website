 All three of my manuals say that I should fit oversize shoes if I
 turn the drums.  I don't remember this injunction with any other cars
 I've worked on, and when I ask at my local FLAPS about oversize
 shoes, they just give me puzzled looks.

 Do &quot;oversize&quot; shoes really exist?  Are they really necessary?
