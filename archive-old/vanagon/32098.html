Subject: Replacing distributor with Jacobs--What would you do? 

Hi everybody...

Recently during a tune up session I found out I have a 009 distributor &amp;
blue coil.  Apparently this combo doesn't really work well with the 34pict3
carb.

The way I see it, I have two options:

1. Change my dist back to the vacuum advance. Cost ~$100
2. Change to dist-less system: cost for one I want 219.95

The Jacobs Bug-Pak comes with a 30-90 day money back guarentee, plus a
six-month warranty period.  It was just reviewed in HotVWs, and seems to
work pretty well.

Jacobs guarantees to instantly cure:

All misfires            Low End miss
Poor MPG                Surging
Lost Performance        Weak low end torque
Sluggishness            Plug fouling
Bogs                    Pinging
High End Miss           Bucking off idle
Hard starts cold        Off idle stumbles
Hard starts hot
Erratic idle

My bus certainly suffers from all of this stuff.  It would be nice to try
it out, anyway, with a return fee of 10%($21)...

I have a feeling I'll be buying this thing...if anyone here knows just
reason why these two shouldn't be married...speak now or forever hold your
peace...

Regards,

Johnny
