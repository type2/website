Subject: time vs rpm vs wear

Vehicle - '73 Camper

Engine - 2000cc, hyd lifters, 36,000 miles since rebuild

The speed limits in Texas have recently been raised to 70mph.  The above has 
always been driven and happy at about 57-60mph cruising.  It will easily go 
70mph.  For recreation, slow speeds are fine.  For the commute, shorter time 
would be better.  I'm not out to debate the joys of a slow trip, just 
wondering about the effect of high speeds on engine life.

Question - What is the trade off in engine life for higher rpm vs time, i.e. 
if I drive 70 miles _at_ 70mph it takes me 1 hour (theoretical).  If I drive 
the same 70 miles at 55mph, it takes me 1 hr 15 min (theoretical).  Assuming 
proper maintenance, what is the cost of speed in terms of engine life?  Will 
an engine run at slower speeds have a 10% longer life?  Or is it like 
someone on this list once said - that your engine is given a certain number 
of rpms in its life.  You use them fast or slow (within reason).

How many of you drive 70mph?

Dean
