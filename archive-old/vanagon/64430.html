Subject:      Pacific NW Vanagon List

As a recently 'returned to the fold' Vanagon Listserv member, I've been
impressed with the proliferation of Seattle/Pacific NW members over the
last year or so.  I received several thoughtful and helpful responses to
my inquiry about &quot;Seattle Area Mechanics&quot; and have followed the burgeoning
interest in the upcoming NW camping trip.  All of which leads me to
wonder:  Would it be worthwhile to set up a separate mailing list
specifically for NW Vanagon owners (and, of course, our brethern busses
and EV's)?  I would envision this as dedicated to the discussion of
practical, NW area issues, such as where to get qualilty and value in
VW service and parts, coordination of NW vanagon outings and events and
other similar items of local/regional interest.

I've set up a list - via my local ISP - for NW Flyfishing and have
found it to be easy enough to do that I'd be willing to set up a similar
one for us NW Vanagon owners.

If you're interested in such a list - or if you have ideas for what the
list should be like - drop me an email (let's not clutter up *this* list
with discussion) and I'll see what I can do.
