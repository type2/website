&gt;Subject: Mr. Murphy must be lurking around the V_at_L !!!

Mr. Murphy is NOT a lurker. On the contrary... he is the list's most
active participant. Owns a share of each of our buses, possibly excepting
those of you with '96 examples with &lt;3K miles on them. And your time is
coming...


&gt; 'maximum allowable share of misery' .. or something like that,
&gt;
&gt;which stated that, according to the laws of karma, or whatever you might
&gt;want to call it, has a maximum allowable share of the overall available
&gt;misery.  This means that, things can only get so bad before your allowable
&gt;amount of misery is exhausted, and then they turn better.

In my experience, this is not a metaphysical limit, but a very real limit
set by each owner. When you reach your limit, you sell the d*mned thing,
and then things do indeed begin to improve.
