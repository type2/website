hi all,
	A good friend of mine is going out to the states on holiday to visit =

his sister who is an aupare. He is also an aircooled nut (but has no van!=
).
He'll be staying for six weeks in the San Jose/San Francisco/Cupertino =
area
from July 28th to September 5th. Now then, good people, what he wants =
to know
about is any events that he can go to / participate in within reasonable =

travelling distance of where he is staying. He's really hyped up about =
this 
trip as its about the only time he'll ever get out there and also because=
 of 
the hype we get over here about the Californian VW scene in general. 
	Any info/help you could give would greatly enhance his stay and make =

the whole experience easier for him. 

	He is also thinking of bring back a 69mm T1 counter weight crank 
because he thinks its a cheaper way to get one, so could someone post =
prices 
for me so I can work out weather this is a viable proposition or not.
His idea is to carry it as his hand luggage!(Yeek)

TIA




Stuart,
