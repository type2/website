Subject: 1.6 litre diesel heads - regular vs turbo-diesel

        Since I cannot find a source of the damaged pre-combustion chamber
cap, I now must replace the head on my turbo-diesel vanagon.

        When examining a head, are there differentiating stampings or marks
that will tell me which one is a regular diesel head and which one is the 
turbo-diesel head?  I am tempted to use the regular diesel head for my
turbo-diesel, but after reading Bentley, maybe the regular head is not as
strong, and will not last long.

        Does anyone have any experience of using a regular head on a turbo-
diesel engine, and with what results, longevity, etc.?

        I'm also putting out an APB for a 1.6 litre turbo-diesel head. The only
condition is that it must be rebuildable.  Anyone have a head for sale? ? ?
