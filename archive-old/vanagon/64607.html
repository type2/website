Subject:      Erouvan Lloyd Mats FS Vanagon Too!

Eurovan &amp; Vanagon Owners,

  I got my hands on a few Front Carpets and some Passenger area ones too.

  I'm listing them by what the boxes tell me they are but I'll have to double check
too.

  Eurovan mats

  Grey Cargo Area (Behind the Rear Seat) $75.00
  Grey 1 piece Front AND Passenger area  $125.00
--1 Piece front in Grey, Black &amp; Blue.  $60.00 Each

  Vanagon Mats
  Drk Brown Camper area and front I think $125.00
  Black Passenger area Mat  $75.00

  These are New and in Boxes, I got them from someone that did a Bulk buy and didn't
need these.  The prices I'm quoting are considerably less than retail.

  Anyone interested in any of these e-mail me and we can work out the details.

  Kyle
