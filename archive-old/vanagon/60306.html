Subject: Hot start problem, '91

My '91 has started having a hot start problem recently.  Cranks but doesn't
fire, or fires maybe on one cylinder?  The gear shift shakes a lot.
Intermittent problem, though.  Reading through the news group, I relocted
the wiring harness to the distributor to on top of everythning else, and it
started.  Too soon to tell if it's a real fix, but I'll ley you know what I
find.
