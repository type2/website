*Cherry's Virtual '67 Westy (still under construction)

She calls it = Celeste (as in Celestial e.g.
Spacious/spacey/Astrology/Celestial Seasons Tea/Poking fun at the perceived
hippie-&quot;New Age&quot; aspect of VW ownership)

He calls it = '67 Westy Resto from Hell (as in pain in the butt, wish I
never did it, anything that could go wrong, money pit, ulcer source,
nicotine pump, reason for drinking my guts out, killer of the VW jones,
shoulda bought a fully loaded brand new $25,000. 4WD truck and saved money.)

*'57 Single Cab Euro
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
They call it = The Single, The '57, The Truck, The Sweat-mobile, Rusty,
Dependable, Thumper, Leaky, The one that's running today.
