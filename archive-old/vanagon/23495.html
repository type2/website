&gt;dry and sttraight. No flaming retort intended but, I propose that you start
&gt;a &quot;virtual&quot; resto and add up the pieces. Don't halfaz the job and do a
&gt;complete, thorough, professional job and see how available every little
&gt;piece is or isn't. Just see how reliable and affordable every subcontractor

I did this earlier in the year for my '72 Westy using last years Bus Stop
catalog (still haven't got this years Bus Boys catalog, Jim, hint, hint) and
for the pieces that I needed/wanted was over $5,500 and they didn't have all
I needed/wanted.  I only paid $1,400 for the Westy!  Then I would still have
to get it painted ($$$).  This is the biggest reason for the &quot;(SLOWLY getting
together)&quot; between the 1972 and Westfalia below.
