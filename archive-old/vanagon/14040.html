Subject: Buying a vanagon

For a couple of months now i have been on the intense search for a vw van of 
some sort, i have settled on a vanagon, preferrably 85 and up, i'm having 
great trouble finding any!!!  does anyone have any suggestions as to where i 
can purchase one.  I called all the vw dealers in my area and two were 
expecting trade-ins on vanagons, but one felll thru (damn, it had the 
weekender package) and another is expecting an 87 camper.  by the way... can 
the stove and sink and refrig be taken out of the westys so you can increase 
space?
