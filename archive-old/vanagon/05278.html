Subject: Originator Names

I have begun receiving messages which indicate the original sender as sender
rather than the vanagon list as sender. I don't know if this is something
Gerry is doing or if my AOL software has begun doing this. 

Either way, it isn't such a good idea. When I hit my reply button the message
might go back to that individual rather than to the whole list. 

Also, I ignore about 1/2 of the vanagon list messages without reading them
but I always read mail addressed personally to me. Having all mail look like
it is personally addressed to me forces me to read it all and I cannot do
that.

About 1/2 of the messages on this list have no business being here as it is
merely mindless chatter from lonely people. I feel that Joel can post any
message he likes because he regularly contributes very valuable technical
information. Some of the other people are just blowing hot air into this
thing and it has the potential to drive people with real jobs and real lives
off the list. 

The saving grace is when people properly identify their subject matter. Those
of us who don't want to read poems about our campers have learned what Friday
Haiku means. 

Messages still go through here like &quot;Glad to hear that,&quot;  &quot;I agree,&quot; or
&quot;Thanks for all your help.&quot; I feel that if you have this little to say that
you should send a private message. 

Please don't generate traffic just to generate traffic. There are plenty of
places for that sort of thing in cyberspace.
