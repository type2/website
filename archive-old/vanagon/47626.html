  I offer this speculative response to observations that FRAM oil filters 
used in Vanagons result in lower oil pressures:  Lower particulate 
threshold passing media combined with lower total media surface area.
  In particulate passage tests, FRAM has shown up as a top performer for 
years.  This indicates to me that they have elected to use a finer pass 
media than most competitors.  As to whether the cost per unit area of 
this is higher than coarser media, I don't know that either.  But I did 
find it interesting to see a FLAPS point of sale product demonstration 
supplied by WIX, who's product box seems to claim WIX is an Original 
Product Manufacturer for quite a few others marketed labels.  The demo 
consisted of a FRAM and WIX oil filter apparently from identical 
application specifications.  Each was cut around its circumference to 
allow easy inspection of its media.  Just guessing based on what I saw, 
I'd think the accordion folded media had about twice the unfolded surface 
area in the WIX compared to the FRAM.
  There are so many assumptions integrated into this speculation that I 
offer it only as a first conjectural comment.  I could be completely 
wrong.  If someone knows of a person who wouldn't bias their comments to 
favor a company's economic interests, and who could address this anomaly 
well, please do a little arm twisting to get their explanation posted as 
to why the ordinarily considered excellent Fram product apparently 
performs so poorly in Vanagons.
