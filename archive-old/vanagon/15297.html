Subject:       Vanagon + Platinum = VROOM!

Hi Everyone.  I have been running my '90 Vanagon with Bosch 
Platinums (WR7CP) for the last couple weeks, and I would like to 
report my findings to the list.

Some of you may recall that I was asking about ignition wires a few 
weeks ago, and I had extremely low readings (3500 ohms).  David Kao, 
and others suggested my multimeter might be toast... and it was.  I 
used a digital meter, and all wires are within VW specs.  Knowing the 
wires were OK, I then put in the platinums.

My van just eats through the Bosch Supers (W7CC0), and after 15000 km 
the gap would be 10 thou over.  Basically I couldn't keep plugs in 
this thing, and that's why I started looking at the platinums.

Bosch claims a 2 to 3 times longer life than regular plugs, and surer 
starts, etc.  Well, I can confirm that my van just loves these 
things.  It was apparent right away from a cold startup.  Hot starts 
are better as well.  I just did a long/hilly trip of 550 km, and 
this van really performed well.  Needless to say, I'm keeping the 
platinums installed.

A point of interest... the platinums are resistor type plugs.  The 
wires in the van are also resistor type (resistor ends).  I was never 
able to determine what difference that would make, but everything 
seems to be running VERY smooth.

I purchased this set from Canadian Tire for approx.  $15 with taxes.. a 
reasonable $$ value IMHO.  I'm so pleased with the results, I'm going 
to put in a set in my mother-in-law's Golf.

Cheers,
Harry.
