Subject: campers camping

Just got back from 2 weeks in Colorado - much cooler than TX.  While we 
weren't in the Campmobile (fit better in the Coleman now), there were two 
'76 Campmobiles and one Eurovan Winnebago in the next campground down the 
mountain - camping together.  I visited, and found that as a group they do 
this often.  I asked if they were on the internet - they laughed and said 
&quot;Goodness no - I don't think that any of us even has a computer&quot;.  One '76 
was like new.  The older couple in it said that they bought it with 43,000 
miles on it (now had 123,000) and they wanted it to last as long as they 
did.  He said that then don't drive it in the winter (they are from 
Nebraska) and if they see any rust on it, they take it to the body shop to 
be fixed.  They had the engine rebuilt at 109,000 - still running.  The 
other van had the engine rebuilt at 118,000 - catastrophic failure on a trip.

The Eurovan Winnie was a white pop-up.  I think the owners were two ladies 
who had previously put 250,000 miles on a '71 they had.  One of them said 
that they understand that they purchased the first Winnie conversion down 
the line.  They found that the Winnie conversion wasn't as efficient as they 
had gotten used to in their previous Westfalia, but they were getting used 
to it also.  Their dealer, Continental Motors in Littleton, CO seemed to 
really take care of them.  They had a really neat screen accessory that 
fitted in place in the open sliding door area - said that it was a demo 
version from their dealer.  They had complained that they were used to the 
louvered windows of their '71, and felt that this would meet the need.

Saw lots more Eurovans than I see in TX, and lots of breadloafs also.  
Thought about waving, but why would they wave at a Mercury station wagon?
