&gt;        My favorite name scribbled on the side of one of those split-window
&gt;        units cruising the PNW (Pacific Northwest):
&gt;        Der Bummler

for those of you without a german dictionary, Bummler is an idler, loafer,
lounger, gadabout, dawdler, slowcoach. :) i like it.

being somewhat partial to some of the names i gave my own buses, :) and
other cars,
  der Bus - a 1980 vanagon. had the name in old English letters on the side.
            (best bus i ever had, even if it wasn't air conditioned)
  Blitzfahrt - a 1974 Porsche 914 with a hole in its muffler
  Humpback, the Quasi-Motor of Noted Fame - a 1968 double-cab pickup truck.
            (sniff. i miss old Humpback, even with his lousy drum-drum brakes)

those were my favorite names. the other buses names fit the bus, but they
didn't have that 'zing'.
