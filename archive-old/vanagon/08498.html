&gt;Smog is a non-issue for that old of a bus Bill.  Even if it was, a newer
&gt;engine would be acceptable.

Sorry, that is wrong!

Cars made in '65 and before are smog exempt.  Our friend here will stil;
have to comply.  They are going to look for things like the vaccum advance,
oil breather tube, and would prolly bitch about the carbs (?) not being
original.  Another thing that might cause trouble would be the lack
of the deceleration valve.  Junkyards won't have them, and they are over
$100 new.

Sorry if I seem cranky.  I'm running a 102.5 fever right now.
