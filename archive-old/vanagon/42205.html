Subject: Re: Selling EIGHT Corvairs, cheap!


&gt;        I know that this isn't a bus question, but, will a Corvair engine
&gt;fit inside a 'Thing' (type 181).  My 181 hasn't moved in about 10 years and
&gt;the motor is one of it's many troubles (it didn't make it into the garage so
&gt;it's been sitting half-in half-out all these years).  I looked in my Kennedy
&gt;engine adapter catalog to see if it would be a good fit, and the catalog had
&gt;nothing to say about 181's.  This was my first car and it has some
&gt;nostalagic value to me, as such I wouldn't want to butcher it.  Just wondering.

No. If you put one of these in a 181 it would take flight and snap your
neck and then you might sue me. I am disqualifying you. You'll thank me
later. ;)

Actual Bus people:

I am going out tomorrow morning to cruise these yard cars and see what can
be gleaned. I have hypothetical definites (!) from two people as of now.
Probably I'll take enough to satisfy the definites plus one for me in case
I ever decide I need air conditioning. The Cruise Director asserts that I
cannot buy anything unless I know I can sell it so if you want one then get
on the stick.
