Subject:      '87 Westfalia For Sale

Boston Globe, Tuesday 9/16: VW, Westfalia, '87 140k mi., maroon, exc. cond.,
no rust, alarm, tint, am fm cass. $8000. 617-242-4307.  I talked with the
owner, because the ad actually said: --'97 140k--, which I could not
believe.  He said it is an '87, bought in Florida, but &quot;I can't take it back
to Australia.&quot;  It also has a tow package and air conditioning.  He bought
it recently, and I think he said that the camping equipment showed little or
no sign of having been used.  His email is: pspiteri_at_hotmail_dot_com
