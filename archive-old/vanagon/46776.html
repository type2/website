Subject: Re: Generator to Alternator Conversion....

Scott Johnson asked about upgrading his old generator to an alternator. 
  Just to keep it unbelievably simple Scott, ask your local alternator 
repair service about what would be a suitable candidate from the class of 
alternators often described as &quot;single wire hookup.&quot;  The only wire you 
run is from the output to the battery's positive terminal.  Residual 
magnetism is enough to start the charging when you spin your motor, so 
it's &quot;self exciting&quot; and the built-in regulator prevents over-charging.  
I just replaced a Leece Neville alternator on one of my vehicles with a 
100 amp double pulley Delco single wire hook up alternator.  The rebuild 
shop can supply a plastic rain plug to block-off the unused (and 
unneeded) terminals, or if some high temp &quot;silicon goo&quot; makes you happy, 
either are common.  Never, even for an instant, run your alternator with 
the charging terminal unloaded.  It can easily destroy diodes in your 
diode trio.  It may continue to &quot;work&quot; but at a compromised output, 
masking from those who do this &quot;just for a moment while I change 
batteries,&quot; information about damage they just caused.  This is taking 
unneeded chances.  I was told that running lights and fans while 
making these exhanges lessens to chance of damage, but I don't know. 
  Why'd I do it?  This cost me about $150 and I was quoted $650 for the 
original.  Leece Neville's are common on continuous duty class equipment 
that are often expected to run as well in their second million miles as 
in their first, like over-the-road buses.
