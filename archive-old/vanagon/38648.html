&gt;I just replaced my thermostat when i did head gaskets on the '87.
&gt;previously, 
&gt;the water temp gauge was always smack dab in the middle of the red 
&gt;warning LED.  now it is running completely off but adjacent to the LED on
the
&gt;hot 
&gt;side of the scale.  heater output is wonderful but i'm wondering if i 
&gt;still have some entrapped air causing the system to run hot.

Mine almost always rides the lower edge of the LED.  The only time it didn't
was when we went over 100 degrees last summer, but we haven't had to worry
about High air temps around here lately have we, Dan.
