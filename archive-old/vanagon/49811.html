I was combing the junkers this past weekend and got an interior 
sliding door handle from an '84 Vanagon.  I did this because I had 
been led to believe that these things break often and are costly from 
the dealer.  This one came off of an '84, I don't know what years it 
fits.  It is brown and has about as many scratches you could expect.  
It has a crack starting on one of the corners inside where it bolts 
on.  It looks to me like it is still good for some use.  I paid $5 for
the thing and will take that and the shipping from the first caller.  
Pls reply directly as I'm not on this list any longer.

about the water cooled ones) '71 Campmobile
