Subject: Re: Aladin's Treasure Cave in Renton?

Wouldn't you rather have one of those complete bathrooms with the stainless
toilet and blue flush water? Now that would be something to have in a bus!
&gt;        Hi all,
&gt;        First, let me tall you that there is a very cool thing
&gt;up near Seattle, the Boeing Company Surplus Sale Building. Its
&gt;at South 208th and 84th Ave South, in Renton, I believe, and
&gt;open Tuesday-Friday 10-5, Saturday 9-4. Their info line is 206 393 4062
&gt;and that's got directions and hours, you can talk to a person there
&gt;at 206 393 4065.
&gt;
&gt;        What they sell is whatever scraps they have left from making
&gt;airplanes, etc, and I'm told its pretty much price by the pound. They have
&gt;aluminum, steel, wires, cables, insulations, upholstry, carpet, plastic, etc,
&gt;as well as bins full of back issues of Aviation Week and Space Technology
&gt;and all kinds of other wacky things. Makes me want to visit.
&gt;
&gt;        However, I'm not close to being able to go visit yet. So
&gt;what I was wondering was, would someone from the Seattle area go
&gt;there for me and get me about $10 worth of big, interesting,  carpet scraps?
&gt;Then box it and UPS it down? I think I remember the price being $1/lb
&gt;last time Ian was there, so this would be $10 worth of stuff, in
&gt;a cardboard box maybe 12-14lb UPS'ed to me. I can write you a check
&gt;up-front and buy your lunch if you want.
&gt;
&gt;        I need liners for my new tool box drawers, and I figure
&gt;lightwieght, long-wearing airliner carpet would make beauts! It comes,
&gt;I presume, in all those wonderful vivid colors that are sometimes
&gt;used in airliners, and I could also give the extra as gifts at Christmas.
&gt;
&gt;        If $10 worth sounded like a big hassle, but a smaller amount
&gt;would be do-able, I need enough for 6 drawers, each 22 inches long and
&gt;about 8 inches wide.
&gt;
&gt;        And yes, as a matter of fact, doesn't this sound like
&gt;a great place to get stuff to customize one's bus/transporter/camper?
&gt;Aluminum for solar-cell racks, etc?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;        No time for the heat exchangers last night :( Tonight
&gt;or tomorrow morning, I fervently hope. Full report when I know
&gt;something!
