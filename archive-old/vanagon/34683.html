Subject: Wannabus?  Found a '71 for ya.

All right you lurkers, this may be your lucky day!
There's a guy in town that has a '71 for sale that
I looked over at lunch today and it's tempting.

California car, panel van, walk-thru, with 2 sliding
doors.  All original except for the burgundy paint
from the &quot;waist&quot; down and what looks like '74 front
bucket seats with the headrests.  $2,500 obo.
Motor looks sanitary, has 180K miles on the clock.

I've been keeping an eye out for a nice '71 for a
fellow list member.  They bought one a week ago and
I come across this one in the newspaper ads just
yesterday.
