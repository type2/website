You can get higher-wattage bulbs for the rectangular lights but you won't
get much benefit from them unless you wire them directly to the
alternator/battery via relays controlled by your existing headlight circuit.
Otherwise, the voltage drop across the existing circuit will nullify any
increase in brightness. Even with the higher wattage lamps and rewiring, I
don't think you'll do as well as with the round 7&quot; Hella lens and H4
combination.
