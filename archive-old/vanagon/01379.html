Subject: Reasonable mpg?

I took my '84 Vanagon on its first trip (i.e., its first one with ME
riding along), 500 miles.  Going, I drove about 65 mph and got 22 mpg.
Coming back, I drove between 65 and 80, mostly 80, and got 21 mpg.

Are these numbers reasonable--what I can expect?  The 21 mpg at higher
speed seems okay, but I would have expected somewhat higher mpg at legal
speeds.  I don't think there was any significant wind either way.

On a different subject,
I'm replacing all the vinyl-covered side panels with 1/8&quot; oak plywood.
It's very snazzy.  If you ever do this, write me for suggestions.

Will
