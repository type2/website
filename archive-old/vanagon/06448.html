&gt; One quick thought regarding the long awaited summer van trip...
&gt; from my understanding this is going to be a circle tour of the
&gt; US where people will be joining the tour at various points, and
&gt; leaving the tour at various points...right?
&gt; It seems to me that there will be no point in time where we will
&gt; all be together in one place, correct? 

That was the original plan...

&gt; IMHO, wouldn't it be better if we could all be at one place
&gt; at one time rather than be a bunch of intermediate transients?
&gt; Could the plans for the trip be modified a bit where everybody
&gt; could converge at one central point in the US for a couple of
&gt; days, and then the east-coasters could continue west....the 
&gt; westcoasters continue east...etc...etc?

Well I put forth the suggestion of having two separate loops instead of
one since I don't know of anyone that is planning on making the whole
circle.  I got a few replies in favor of the idea, and none against it
(I don't think) so the current plan is to have two loops, one Western
and one Eastern, with a meeting point in perhaps St. Louis or Kansas
City where we could all converge for a couple of days.  Originally there
was some mention of perhaps going to a Royals game, but who knows what
will happen now...

Anyone that would like a copy of the current trip route please let me
know and I will forward it to you.  Also, I am still looking for help
planning the Eastern loop, since I don't know much about the East coast.
