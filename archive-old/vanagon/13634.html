Subject: Red Rock Particulars


Hi everyone!  Just a note to say since this is the quarter break, that I may 
suddenly again find myself without direct internet access.  If you send mail to 
me and don't get a response or it bounces, please send/resend to:  
andrea2_at_aol_dot_com.  Or, you're welcome to try me any time via phone:  
510.376.4321. 

Below are some reminders of things to bring to Red Rock.  Let me say I've not 
been to this park, and maybe someone on our list who has can clarify this, but 
it looks like it would be wise to fill the gas tank before making the trek in 
there.  Does anyone know the last reasonably priced location to get gas?

Note:  there is no electricty at this site.  Bring whatever alternatively 
powered things you need.  Also, the toilets are the &quot;pits.&quot;  (Brace yourself).  
Lastly, and perhaps most important:  I'm told there is not water on site, but 
rather about a mile away, which one can of course drive to.  In the interest of 
fuel economy, you may not want to leave home with your vans full of heavy 
liquid, but I highly suggest bringing vessels of whatever type, and filling up 
just before finally arriving at the camp site.  

I'll post another message soon regarding food/potluck, etc., although it may 
be from the other address.
