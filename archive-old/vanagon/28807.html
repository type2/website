Subject: Re: Coolant Temp Indications

&gt;     hi Jim and Drew !
&gt;  i don't doubt what you said Drew, but i've had the same gauge problem in my
&gt; rabbit and i'm sure mine is completely electrical (i.e., NO overheating)
&gt; because at the same time the temp gauge shows hot the fuel gauge goes up as
&gt; well. never thought it serious enough to fix it, figured it's mebbe a loose
&gt; ground connection in the instrument panel ???

I think you're right about a ground problem, but it's more likely 
between the engine and the frame - on Rabbits it usually a braided 
copper cable on the back of the head, which gets oil soaked with 
age. Cleaning in solvent &amp; replacing may cure the problem. I've heard 
that a secondary ground strap can also help here.
