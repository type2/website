Subject: Wilderness Camping

I am a Amateur Radio operater and 3 times a year I take part in VHF 
contests which means spending 3 days on top of a mountain somewhere and 
making as many long distance contacts as possible (i have done very well 
so far) up till now i have used my Jeep for this purpose but since I now 
have a westie I will be using that for first time i mid January I have 
some questions that I hope you guys can help me with the answers
The mountain I will be using is 3500 ft and in a remote part of Virginia
my question are:
	1.	I dont have time to buy and install a propex heater so 
what other forms of heat can you suggest (it will be really cold up 
there)
	2.what advice do you have about water? my options are to use the 
westie tank or take a seperate 6 gall container  i am concerned about 
water freezing or if there is enough heet from the first question will i 
be alll right?

	3. my dometic fridge doesnt have any of the inside shelves etc I 
would like to know a source for these and also if some one could 
describe them to me so that maybe i can make some for instace is there a 
way of making ice in the fridge? and are there some sort of retainers in 
the door?

	4. what are the best snow chains to use and where can i get them 
looking for some thing that is easy to install in the field and are a 
snug fit.

	well thats all i can think of for now so if any of you mountain 
toppers can give me any more help I would be Gratefull
