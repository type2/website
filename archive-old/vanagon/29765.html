Hi all.
(This follows replacing the passenger side head gasket on my '86)
One more question please - what is the procedure for adjusting the valves?  
I must be making some mistake because I set them this morning - and
immediately had no compression on the two cylinders that I adjusted??  
I turned the crank to TDC, then screwed in the adjusters on #1 until they
just contacted the valve stem - then turned in 2 more turns.  (this is
according to the manual)
This of course, lifts the valve from the seat when it is supposed to be
closed (firing in # 1) and results in no compression.
I'm very confused!
TIA,  cheers,    MIKE
