Subject: Engine Oil Pre-Luber

I chose the inexpensive &quot;bottle&quot; method. 

This consists of a bottle attached to a valve attached to the oil system.
When the motor is running and oil pressure is up, oil rushes in through the
valve and into the bottle at high pressure. When the key is turned off the
pressurized oil is stored in the bottle. 

When you go to start the car again you turn the key to the mid position for
a bit, at which point the valve opens, allowing the oil in the bottle to
seep out and in to your motor's oil passages. Then you turn the key all the
way and the motor fires with fresh oil pushed in to there by the bottle.

The manufacturer is in Rhode Island somewhere. Can't remember the name right
now.


&gt;&gt;in a pre-luber for the motor and other cool stuff.
&gt;&gt;     ^^^^^^^^^^
&gt;Derek,
&gt;Please some more info on this.  I know it's good, but even in Whitney 
&gt;they're over $300.
&gt;
&gt;TIA,
&gt;Dean
&gt;
