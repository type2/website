Hi y'all,

Please forgive for not responding directly to your requests to see Bill 
Abbot's now famous video tape, there were quite a few. Shortly after I 
posted the message about the tape, I got several requests, and sent the 
tape to the first request.  With the tape went a list of about 10 others 
who wanted the tape.  The person I sent it to has already sent it to the 
next person on the list.  So the tape is on its journey, somewhere in 
Canada by now.  

I'm still getting requests to be added to the list, but it's obviously 
difficult for me to know where the tape is.  I don't know the best way to 
get your name on the list... maybe when somebody receives it, they can 
post a message, and whoever wants it can contact them (quickly!) to be 
put on the list.  Any ideas?  Maybe a couple more copies would help...

Mitch
