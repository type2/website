Subject:      Re: Replacing water pump - pointers?

&gt;| Would someone please tell me about the joys of removing and replacing my
&gt;| water pump?

        I did it a month or two ago. It took about 4 hours and the most
difficult part of the replacement was tightening the large coolant pipe which
comes off to the left of pump. I had a lot of trouble getting the socket
around the nut as it keep hitting the pipe. I am not sure if I had the right
bolts in there now, as mine were hex heads but I could of think they might
have supposed to have been allen heads... I had this pipe loosen up once,
so I put a set of fancy lock washers in at that time as well...

        There was one nut securing the pump which I was told would be a
real problem (the one that looks like you might need to pull the crankshaft
pulley to get at), but a universal joint on the end of the socket enabled me
to get that one out pretty easy. Pull the coolant pipe that runs under-
neath the crankshaft pulley before you have the pump all loosened up; I
couldn't get it moved far enough to allow the pump to come off the studs.

&gt;|         Locating a replacement pump?

        Bus depot has em for $50 or so...

&gt;|         How hard is it get in there?

        Hmmm, there is not a lot of extra space. Best to have a nice
magnet-on-a-stick to retrieve things...
