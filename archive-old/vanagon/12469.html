Subject: Re: Broken Speedo


&gt; Hi everybody. I'm curious to know if anybody's speedometer has broken on
&gt; their Vanagons. I have an '85 and the speedo and Odometer both broke last
&gt; month. I have no Idea how far or fast I'm going.
&gt; 

Mine stoped the odometer, but I can still read speed off it...
I'm waiting to bust all together, until then I'll listen in for tips on 
how to fix it!

Fernando
