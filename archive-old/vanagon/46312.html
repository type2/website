Subject: '83 won't start

Hello all!

Just when I think I've got everything licked, time for another lesson! 
My Bentley's at home and I'm not (yeah, I know) so here goes,

My '83 GL waterpumper won't start. When I turn the key, the instrument 
panel does its little dance, I can turn the lights on, the radio sings, 
but nothing at all happens in the rear! (all puns accepted) I think I 
hear a little whine but I only have two hands and my neck's not quite 
long enough. I've tried to jump it with the same results. I know this 
is a very basic question, what do you expect from a chemist?

Thanks! and I expect to see this posting extracted and extremely 
misconstrued:)
