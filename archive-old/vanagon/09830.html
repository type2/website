&gt; Can someone, Richard perhaps, give me an approximate driving time from 
&gt; Chattanooga or Atlanta to Jordan Lake?  I will mention this to our local group, 
&gt; Scenic City Transporters, to gauge their interest.  We have about 40 busses and 
&gt; do closer trips frequently.  Put me down for a &quot;yes&quot; for the meeting at this 
&gt; point.
well, not having my map right now, I can tell you it is about 250-300
miles on I-40 from the Tennessee line. Sorry, I forget how far inside TN
Chattanooga is. It would be great if you could get your club to come,
you could all drive in a caravan, like a big choo-choo train...
sorry, just had to put that in :)
Richard
