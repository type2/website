&gt; I was told by one mechanic at the local VW dealer that using distilled
&gt;  water with the coolant helped prolong the life of the heads by slowing
&gt;  down down the corrosion process.  I figured it could not hurt so I use
&gt;  distilled water now.

I've also been told that distilled water lacks minerals that are &quot;attacked&quot;
in the corrosion process.  Lacking these minerals the corrosion turns its
attention to the heads.  I don't know what story to believe.  If distilled
water was clearlt better, you'd think manufacturers would reccommend it.
