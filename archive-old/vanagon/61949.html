Subject: Propane leak


Hi all,
	I ran into a problem during my recent trip to New Mexico.  When I
try to use the propane to power the fridge propane leaks out of the grey
metal piece down by the propane tank.  This is the piece after the main
valve that is concealed by the black plastic cover.  The propane leaks out
of a round hole, mabye 1/16 of an inch in diameter.  Bentley does not
discuss the propane tank other than removal/installation.  So my questions
are, what is this grey metal piece where the leak is coming from for?
Have any of you had this problem?  And what can I do to fix it?  I am not
currently able to get at the archives so forgive me if this has been
covered in detail.  TIA.
