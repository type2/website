Subject: Replacing glass in Sliding door

Hi All,

I need to replace the non-sliding piece of window glass in my sliding
door.  I've gotten the whole thing out (aluminum frame and all), and I
got the sliding glass out.  How do I get the other piece of glass out? 
It looks like I can pry the two pieces of aluminum out that hold it
in--but I'm not sure and I do not want to break anything.  Also, there
are several globs of silicone sealant in the corners--is this factory or
is this a 'fix' for leaky windows by PO? 

Any help would be appreciated.  Thanks,

Garth
