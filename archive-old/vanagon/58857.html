&gt; Does anyone have any more info on the Neuspeed city lights?  They sound =
&gt; pretty neat.
&gt; 
&gt; Also, I am the original owner of my 87 GL Wolfsburg w/ Alloy wheels. I =
&gt; have a steel wheel for the spare tire.  It seems as though a lot of you =
&gt; have an alloy wheel for you spares.  Does any one know if mine should =
&gt; have come with an alloy spare?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks

Sure.  Try Rapid Parts in New York or Neuspeed in Cali.  Also if your are
near PA there is a nice store called Strictly Foreign that has them.  They
come in two variteies.  Drop in H4 Hella Config and Drill in for others. 
25.00 for either one and the bulbs are interchangeable.  For all you wnnabe
Deutchlanders out there this is the third &quot;must have purchase&quot; after the
German Plate and the &quot;D&quot; shield.  They draw very little current and can be
easily tapped into the parking lights.  Or a Relay and switch could be
used, just a lot of extra wiring.  They give off a dull white light that
looks really neat.  I only use mine as DRL's.  Any questions I will try and
find you some phone numbers.
