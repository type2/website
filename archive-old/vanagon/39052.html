Subject: Re: Fwd:Info on '78 to '73 Engine Swap

it.  I have now purchased a '73 Westy and intend to transplant my '78 FI
engine into it.  Has anyone out there ever retrofitted an FI engine into a
non-FI body?  As I see it the problem areas are:

Fuel System:
        swap gas tanks (after cleaning out the rust)
        mount electric fuel pump
Electric:
        Strip rear wiring harness from '79 and '73
        Install '79 rear wiring harness in '73

Body:
        chisel off and install air filter support bracket
        switch fuel tank cover plates (for decel valve anchor arm)

Questions:
        What have I forgotten?
        Where are the hidden pitfalls?
        Anyone done a complete rear harness replacement?
        Am I too old to do something this dumb?

YES, it can be done.  My first bus was a 73 westy.  Unfortunately, it motor
died   :(.  Eventually, I got hold of a 77 bus with bif front collision
damage.   My friend Larry, as  1) i was a VW idiot a 2) i was on crutches
with a broken arm and leg,  transferred the motor.  Actually the trans too,
as the later trans is better.   

It needed:
 a hole cut for the brain (sounds gorey, eh)
 Fuel tank swap  (straighforward)
fuel pump mounted.
new fuel line to and from pump.   I didn't realise this at the time- it
started leaking later
remember- only unleaded.  oh they dont sell leaded anymore- nevermind
use the starter that came with the later motor.

no - dont swap wiring harness  at least this didn't have it done.   

i hope this helps.  it was a while ago.  but it was cheaper than a new motor
