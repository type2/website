Subject: bug undercarriage found in forest


In the Santa Cruz mountains (CA) over the weekend I found the
undercarriage for an old bug, with transmission, 4 drum brakes, and
whatever else comes with those items. It is only about 200 yards from
where you can park your car. What should be done with these items? I
am sure that *someone* would want them.
