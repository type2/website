Subject: next CCC's date is set!


I know things have been kind of wishy-washy about the CCC's camping dates.  We've
cancelled a few in the last 6 weeks or so, and there was talk about scheduling
one for Labor Day weekend.  But it turns out not many can attend this date,
and those few remaining free to do so seem unhappy about it being on a
holiday weekend like this, so I'm going to suggest something else.  With
luck, you'll all like this idea better anyhow.

Former Californian Dave Schwarze (now being held captive by a Texas employer
while we all patiently wait for him to return to his homeland) sent me an
e-mail recently saying how much he missed camping with all of us, and that
he'd accrued a bit of vacation time, which he'd like to use to come out
and see all of us for a camping weekend.  After some back and forths, we
decided that the weekend of September 20-22 would work nicely.  Then, in
an impulsive moment, I mentioned to Joel Walker (our stat-freak guru
living in Alabama) that he should drive to TX and catch a ride with David
and FINALLY come to CA and go camping with us.  Amazingly, this idea took
off with all concerned, and it now looks as if dates and attendees will all
work out.  Listen, CCC's - this may be your big chance to meet two list
heroes in ONE place at ONE time AND camp with them for the weekend.  If
you can at all make it, I urge you to set aside these dates and make
the campout - it should be a biggie.  

Location is still unknown.  Suggestions welcome.

Some of you may receive this messages more than once, due to the overlapping
of the various lists.

Start planning and stay tuned....
