Subject: Re: Lifter clatter

&gt;
&gt;The aftermarket parts guy tells me my noisy lifter ('84 Wasserbox) can be 
&gt;replaced by pulling the rocker arm, and yanking the part right out of the 
&gt;case via the tubes - no head removal required. Sounds like tricky surgery, 
&gt;pulling that slick piece through the tube and all. And how do I know which 
&gt;lifter it is in the first place.
&gt;
&gt;I've been living on CD-2 lifter-quieter-oil-additive for a couple years... a 
&gt;can with every-other oil change. It works good, but seems like a short term 
&gt;fix; and I'm not about to sell. The clatter always goes away after warming 
&gt;up, but it makes my skin crawl to hear that noise when I start.
&gt;
&gt;Anyone been through this one before?
&gt;
&gt;

           I have the same problem on my '71 bus when cold and my '62 T-Bird
           when it's HOT.  I don't know what to do since they are otherwise
           running well.
