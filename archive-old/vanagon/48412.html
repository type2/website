Shawn:

Can you please let me know if you find out anything on this. My '87 Westy
Syncro JUST started doing the same thing. Here in NJ, the weather kinda
turned last week. It got real moist (two people at work had their cars not
start in the morning due to moisture on the lines etc. and in the
distributor cap).

My '87 all of a sudden stalls when cold and on start up. Needs a bit of gas
and some pedal massaging to keep the revs up until the engine heats up a bit
. Once the engine is warm, runs fine.

I also noticed a bit of valve tapping when its cold (which I think is normal
), which also goes away once th engine warms up.

I'd sure like to figure things out... I miss my quick starting Westy!

Subject: '88 stalls when cold

Hello all,

Lately my '88 w/b has been stalling for the first few minutes when  cold
when coming to a stop. When restarting, it needs a bit of  throttle (not
much) to get going. Cranking it with no gas usually  does not work, which is
not normal for FI 

I've checked the microswitch on the throttle body - it's fine. It runs 
great otherwise, so I was hoping someone has had this problem &amp; can  point
out some quick checks. I don't have time to do a thorough check  of
everything now, since we're too busy camping... :)

ps: The idle is quite steady so I think the idle stabilizer is ok, it  only
seems to stall if pushing the clutch in at 2000 rpm +. One clue  is that it
now idles at ~900 when cold where it used to be at around  1100 until warmed
up.
