Subject: Oh No!  Throttle cable jammed, can't replace
Date: Sun, 25 Dec 94 12:07:12 PST

So Tobin Copley says:
&gt; Help needed, please.  Here's the scoop:
&gt; 
&gt; Throttle started sticking last night, and got so that tapping the pedal 
&gt; with my foot wouldn't free it--had to pull it up by hand.  That got 
&gt; tiresome pretty fast.
&gt; 
&gt; But I have a spare throttle cable, so tried replacing the old one this 
&gt; morning.  Couldn't get the &amp;*$#_at_! old one out!  Got about 2 1/2 - 3 feet 
&gt; out, then it jammed.  Really jammed.  Solid.  Tried pushing it back in, 
&gt; bit by bit.  Got about 3 inches from where the cable should re-enter the 
&gt; engine compartment, jammed again.  Can't pull it out, can't push it back 
&gt; in.  Grrrr....
&gt; 

One thing.  Be sure that when you are trying to unjam it to force it in
the opposite direction you were originally trying to pull it with.  I'd
go to the hardware store and get one of those thin metal rods and push
it through the original pulling side and as deftly as possible, force the
blockage clear.  Be sure to put plenty of grease on the rod, but not too
much.  You want as much lubrication as possible, but you want manuvering
room too.  Boy this is getting to sound sexy. ;)  Anyway work at it with
that strategy and get a second person to help you at the other end to
snatch the wire as it comes out.

Hope this helps and see ya at Pfeiffer,

Steven
