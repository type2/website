&gt; 
&gt; a van-list anecdote ....
&gt; 
&gt; was in palo alto last week on the company and stopped at the
&gt; palo alto duckpond for a look at the waterfowl
&gt; 
&gt; Saw a eurovan, two vangons, a loaf and an 'owl-face' (my version
&gt; of split) all packed into a little space. One of the bird watchig 
&gt; groups came up and drove off as i watched and didnt 'see' anything unusual
&gt; 
&gt; Here in upstate NY if you see an owl-face you honk and jump up and down
&gt; in surprise .....
&gt; 
	Reason=sodium chloride

	One of the delightful sights in Colorado after living in USNY (Upstat..
	.......) was all the old cars cruising down the road with no body rot.

	On of the businesses in Seattle I never remember seeing in USNY were
	engine rebilding shops.

	In the NE, bodys disintegrate before the need for a rebuild.

	In the west, some machines go the crusher with their 3rd-4th engine.

	Going to school in Alfred, NY in 1974, I bought a 1972 car for $200.
	It ran just fine with 71K on it, but, the fenders were duct taped on.

	I sold my beater 1972 Maverick (from NY) in Seattle in 1984 not because
	the drivetrain was beat, but because I drove thru a large puddle
	during the dry season and got soaked and blinded by the muddy water
	shooting up through the rotted floor; wouldn't even be good for hauling
	wood :-))

	I had a friend in USNY that went to Oklahoma whenever he bought a used
	car.
