If you get lucky the heads wont get warped too much..

&gt;   Any advice much appreciated.  My head gaskets are leaking after an
&gt; overheat.  It's an '87 with 68K miles on it.  Should I kick down and do the
&gt; heads at the same time? The mechanic thinks it's almost always necessary.
&gt;  I've heard the contrary.
