Caution!!!
Bob actually had it wrong.  Terry had it right. Be careful, get this wrong
and you could, at the very least ruin your batteries, if not the alternator.It can also cause fires.

+ parallel :  positive to positive, negative to negative, with a diode
              or an isolator in between.  Overall voltage is equal to
              that of a single battery's.  The CCA (cold-cranking-amps)
              is potentially doubled, assuming identical batteries.

+ serial : take battery A and battery B, attach B's negative to ground (body),
           B's positive to A's negative, A's positive to vehicle's positive
           terminal.  Doubles the voltage (6V+6V--&gt; 12V, 12V+12V--&gt;24V),
           halves the CCA, assuming A and B identical.

 &gt; &gt;&gt;Forget the idea of using two 6-volt batteries in series.  Dodge
                              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
this would give you a 12V power supply.

 &gt; &gt;&gt;tried it years ago and abandoned the idea as impractical.  The
 &gt; &gt;&gt;problem is, no two batteries are identical, there will always be

 &gt; &gt;
 &gt; &gt;I think you've got it back-asswards, Bob.  Series means they are connected only
......snip.......
 &gt; 
 &gt; I dis-agree, Bob has it right about batteries in series.  He also has it
 &gt; right about the voltage drop across an iso unit as I can attest.  I just
 &gt; installed one when I put the second battery in and my voltage has dropped
 &gt; from 14.5 to 13.4-8.  I am not particularly concerned about this but it is
what configuration? (I assume parallel).
at idle, at stopped, or at above 1600 rpm?  if at stopped, then one battery
is draining and the other is charging.  if at high idle, then could be that
the alternator is having to 'work harder' so to speak, to charge both.

 &gt; interesting.
