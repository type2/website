Subject: Review of Bus Boys Center Console


hey now,

i just got my center console from bus boys....let me say that it's nice, 
looks good and fits pretty well. 4 cup holders, and two compartments, one 
with coin holder. got it in about a week. thanks to bus boys and their 
great service.

a few observations:

- i'm not convinced that it won't slide forward in the even of a drastic 
braking action. any suggestions on anchoring it without drilling and 
making permanent?

- i'm suprised it doesn't have anywhere to hold maps....

- in the main compartment, the bottom has a tab that looks like it should 
be able to be pulled out for more storage in the body of the console itself.
i tried pulling it out but it only comes out about a third of the 
way...seems a waste of storage space.

- do these come in different models for splitties, vanagons, 
breadloaves...etc?

all in all i'm pleased.._dot_can't wait to hit the road once the engine is 
completed.
