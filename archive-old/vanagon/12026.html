Subject: Re: Carry Warning Triangles



Gotta agree with PJ on this one....when we rallied our GTI we
carried BOTH a pair of warining triangles and at leat 1/2
dozen road flares. The triangles were used especially
in those areas ie: state parks where road flares would
present a fire hazzard.

Luckily we only needed to use the triangles once when
at 2am (during a 12 hour night enduro rally in the
NH mountains) I let the assend of the GTI slide a
bit too much on a narrow bridge (which comprised
the apex of a turn) and bunged a wheel and a brand
new Hakkapalitta tire!!

But thats another story for another time....
