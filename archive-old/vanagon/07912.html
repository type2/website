Subject: RE: Locking engine compartment latch?

When I bought a new '72 Sunroof Bus, the dealer installed an engine compartment
lock (chrome) for about $20.  I can't remember if it had a VW or an Autobahn
brand on it.  The keys were different than anything else on the bus.

If I had been on the Internet in 1972, then Unca Joel could have told me
about getting the lock rekeyed.    :(

So, the locks WERE available from VW dealers, in olden times.....

Now, if there was a lock for the Vanagon oil filler door.....
