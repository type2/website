Subject: Re: more on battery/ a 'how-to'

&gt;I noticed many of you speak of a second battery under the drivers seat., 
&gt; In my 88 westy, there is no second battery... just a space for one and 
&gt;some kind of electrical circuit/junction box.   There is no mention made 
&gt;of a second battery in the owners manual.  Should there be one?  Shoud I 
&gt;install a second??

Nice to have, and not all Westys got one.  Easy way to do this is to put in
the battery and use a regular big ground wire onto the body. Then get a
terminal clamp, some fat 10gauge wire, end connectors and a 30 amp relay and
a 30 amp inline fuse holder.  All this is cheap at Crappy tire!! 

Put on the new terminal to aux + post, and make 3 4&quot;-6&quot; sections of wire
with spade lug connectors on one end all together into a big eye connector
at the other.  Soldering is best!! So is heatshrink tubing!! Use the lug
connectors with overlapping insulation hoods on them (pale blue_at_CTC) Two
lugs are needed to plug the kitchen leads into, just trace the wires from
the mini fuse panel to under the drivers seat and disconnect. The third lead
gets connected to one of the poles of the relay.

(note:  the existing VW relay under the seat can be used/rewired as
described below, I _think_, check when it is 'active' with a voltmeter, if
incorrect, rewire)

 Then run a lead from the other relay terminal under the aisle carpets and
over to another lug end near the passenger/main battery. Fit the inline fuse
holder with a lug on one end and a loop on the other.  The loop goes to main
batt. + terminal. You now have a 10 gauge connector between + terminals
which will handle 30A.  Put a 15 or 20 amp fuse in the holder!!  The 20 amps
will charge the battery fine and won't blow unless your aux battery is
really dead. If the relay acts up and locks on, the starters big amperage
drain from the aux battery will also blow the 20 amp fuse and not your
wiring!!  The fridge WILL drain both batts. if this happens!!  

One last piece of wiring....  You can run a thin lead from the fuse
panel/main headlight circuit and connect it to the control terminal on the
relay. This circuit is not active when cranking the starter, so the power is
off until you release the key.  This will switch on the relay AFTER the van
is running (or whenever the key is on!!), and disconnect automatically when
shut off. Just what you want.
          A simpler tidier alternative is to put a small illuminated-on 1-2
amp switch between the aux + and the relay control terminal. Mount it in the
aisle, visible/reachable from the drivers seat. You MUST remember to switch
it off prior to starting and on when running in order to keep aux battery
charged and not blow the fuse. That's why the lighted switch! Buy some spare
fuses, the inline holder takes the flat ones like the main panel.

Finally, carry a booster cable in your van, only one needed.  When the aux
is very low and blows the 20 amp fuse then bridge the + terminals with the
booster cable to bring up the charge.  And when cold starting use the
booster to link both batteries properly.  Cost &lt;$20Cdn and a couple of
hours, plus a spare battery.  bye, tim


  PS NEVER buy a Crappy Tire battery, never.  Had 4 in one winter, then I
lost the warranty card when we moved and they would not give me #5.  This
despite a date of mfg on the case that showed the battery was built 2 months
older than the 24 month free replacement part of a 72 month warranty.
Claimed it probably didn't sit on the shelf 2 months before they sold it.
Bollocks, I'd picked it up 7 months prior!!
