Subject: '87 Wolfsburg, Fuse Block problem

I'll try to keep it brief. '87 Wolfsburg. Door locks would
lock ok, but unlocking caused the locks to unlock, then
immediately lock again, leaving only the key in the slide
door to get in and out, until I lift up simultaneously on
driver and passenger door locks, which successfully
unlocked. 
In trying to correct the problem, I was looking for either a
broken wire, or a defective motor. Things were'nt going too
well, so I decided to disable the 'central locking system'
by removing 'box' relay/fuse #23. Couldn't find #23, it was
shown (in Bentley 1980 thru 1991) in a position which does
not exist, way up. So, I removed every box on the fuse
block, one at a time. Everything seemed fine, except the
door locks weren't disabled, then POOOM, nothing. No
interior lights, no ability to start, no nothing. 
Much fiddling and the back of the fuse block, 'P'
connection, 'terminal 30', has a large red wire to ignition.
This wire, when fed direct from battery, allowed starting
the car. If voltage is fed to the place where the big red
wire to ignition goes into fuse panel, the interior lights,
etc. come on.
There's another big red wire to the back of the fuse block.
This one goes in the 'N' place. It is, I think, the main
feed to the whole fuse panel. It is hot with the battery
connected. So, I think there is nothing getting from this
main feed wire to the entire fuse block.
I'll try find where the 'main feed' wire is supposed to go
electricallly, and if there is a fuse, fusable link, or one
of those big 'box' fuse/relays, that control it.
 
Thanks for listening. Any suggestions welcome in e-mail, and
if you give me a good one, I'll post something about it to
everybody after I get this fixed.
