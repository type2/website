&gt; Guys get fixated on this NOS, OEM, All Original bullshit.  The shrinks even
&gt; have a definition of it called The Collector Syndrome.

Hear Hear!

Last night, one of my bus friends came over to look at the progress on
the '54 and have a couple beers.  We got into a discussion when I told him
I didn't want to paint it the original Coral Red/Poop Brown.  His reaction
was along the same lines as if I'd told him I was going to cut the
roof off, lower it, and then turn it into a &quot;shortie.&quot;  I want to paint
it the early 2-tone green, its a light green on the bottom and a dark green
on top (I have a picture I'll put on my web page) and he thinks I stark
raving bonkers, a couple fries short of a happy meal!

I explained to him the bus can never be considered perfect anyway, since
I'm replace prolly 25% of the metal on it, and doing some welding in
spots that will make it difficult not to be obvious.  His reply is that
I have a car that will be worth (his words, not mine) $30-40k when I'm
done, so why would I want to F**K it all up?  I explained to him I
was restoring it to drive it and enjoy it, not to &quot;turn around&quot; and
sell.  What would be the point?   Spend a year or so getting grimy
just to turn around and send my labor out the door for a measly $30k?
Heck, I can call up my buddy Mike Milkem and get a faster return than
that, and not even get my fingernails dirty!

The other thing with the NOS/Orginallity people:  While I admit I
like to see busses somewhat restored and original, I think its OK to
take small liberties along the way.  While it may be ugly to cut the
wheel wells, weld a spare tire to the front, etc, I still think certain
&quot;improvements&quot; are acceptable.  Like paint and interior.  I  like my
paint, and if I'd gone the &quot;original&quot; route like so many others,
how would I tell my bus from the others in a parking lot?

One thing that bugs me is that when I _do_ get this bus all prety
and stuff, and I take it to show it off at say a SOTO (ptui!) or
Neato event, if there is another barndoor deluxe there, guess what?
Its going to look exactly the freakin' same!  That doesn't really
do it for me.
