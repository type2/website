Hi kids!

How does the Eastern High Sierra sound? With Tioga Pass open - you Bay 
Area Types can buzz through Yosemite and fire down 395 to the greater  
:-)  Mammoth area. And for you LAShuns - you know where we are!

I assure you this place is WAY cooler than the &quot;Grazing Allotment&quot; on 
the Sequoia!

The INYO has LOTS of  primitive camp areas. One area that comes to mind 
if you don't want to pay for a group site is an area called &quot;The 
Stumps&quot; - Beautiful Jeffry Pine Forest - NO other people - and - with a 
USDA Forest Service Fire Permit... it's all yours at no daily fee! (NO 
restrooms or hook ups or water, though!)

There are also places within developed sites that have HUGE group areas 
with tables - potties - and water. They cost $ though and you'd be 
under constant scrutiny from the FEDS ... no magnesium here!

If there is anything I can do to help plan this one - just shoot some 
ether into your ideas and I'll do my best! Budget cuts might take the 
uniform off the Lady Ranger - but you can't take the Ranger out of the 
Lady!

Keep in touch!

P.S. There are also many AWESOME sites up here in the Lakes Basin - all 
cost money - and there are no &quot;group&quot; sites but you could get several 6 
person 2 vehicle sites together... they would be by far the &quot;coolest&quot; 
weather and scenery wise... at 8,600 - 9,300 feet you can't beat them 
for both. Plus you'd be close to my cabin for shower use if you wanted 
it - there are also showers for &quot;rent&quot; at a couple high sierra resorts 
up here.
