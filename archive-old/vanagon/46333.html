Subject: Flywheel replacement/wear, Bay Area EV market

	The 67 Corvair Monza (another european race GM never entered...)
I bought for $0.02 had a bad engine, which stopped at the same point
every time... the one cylinder with more than 100 psi compression...
suffice to say, the ring gear around the torque converter (yep, AT too...)
got trashed where it and the Bendix gear met. It took six weeks for GM
to fill my order for a new torque converter- I should have tried
rotating it the 90 or 120 degrees the bolt pattern would allow, then
I would have known the engine was no good. I sold it for $200, with
a new torque converter and the engine no better than when I started-
I'd run out of time and money. But percentage wise, this was the best
automotive investment I ever made. I think the $200 was actually MORE
than I had spent on the car, parts and dinner for my friends at Dennys!

	Once we get the house sold, new one bought, etc, I think I'm
going to be in the market for a used EV- plain, not camper. Jean's
pregnant - Jan 30 due date. :)  We don't have to have something bigger than
the Corrado, single-cab or Toyota 'roller to bring the baby home in, but
I think there's a family size vehicle in our future in the next year!

	For budgeting purposes, I'm interested in what used EVs, plain, not
campers, are going for in the Bay Area.

	Happy motoring!
	Bill
