&gt; &gt;I will look at the engine again.
&gt; &gt;It did say it had an oil leak from the head gaskets.
&gt; 
&gt; Uh, Bug engines (incl upright bus engines like yours) don't have head
&gt; gaskets; and if they did, there wouldn't be any oil on either side of them
&gt; anyway. Watercooled engines occasionally have problems with cracked
&gt; (&quot;blown&quot;) head gaskets, which let water drain into their oil, but that's
&gt; a different subject.
&gt; 
&gt; Upright engines often do leak oil from their pushrod tubes and/or valve
&gt; covers. Other points are the crankcase seam and the place where the oil
&gt; cooler mounts inside the fan shroud; and the classic place where the
&gt; crankshaft comes out of the engine to the flywheel.

I think the person may have meant that oil was leaking from the base of
the cylinders, where they go into the case.  There is usually a spacer
there and the joint will supposedly leak if you don't smear sealant all
over it when you install the liners.  I always use sealant on that
joint, and I don't think I have ever had an oil leak there, but I've
seen engines that did.

As for whether to buy the bus or not, just ask yourself if this is
really the type of bus you want (year, style, options) or are you just
looking at it cause it's cheap.  In my experience, buying a vehicle that
is not just what you want is futile, cause no matter how much you fix it
up, you will always be wishing, &quot;I wish I had bought a splittie
instead&quot;, or whatever.  You can repair rust, fix mechanicals, and
repaint, but you can't change the basic bus, so start with the one you
really want, even if it costs more or needs a lot of work.
