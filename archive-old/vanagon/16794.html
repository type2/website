Subject: Re: New Jersey emissions law (was: Why are so many....)

&gt;seems that in New Jersey they have implemented a much stricter emissions 
&gt;test;  the kicker is that if you fail the inspection a second time
&gt;your car is essentially condemed!

Then fix the problems when you find them.  Like it or not, older cars are
horrible for the environment.  Do what is necessary to fix your car.

(California has a weird emissions law that becomes more lax with the age of
the auto.  The annoying side effect is that there are lots of old cars on
the road which legally put out as much smog as 10 newer cars.)
