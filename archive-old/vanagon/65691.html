Yer in San Marcos!??!? Hah! I used to live in Valley Center! I bought
by '71 bus there in SM from a guy known as &quot;Russ Da Bus&quot;, he also has
a 58 panel delivery van converted with a bed &amp; drawers built under it.

Hey, do you know if International VW junkyard is still there!? I used
to get all kinds of stuff for my 71 there.
anyways...
Right now I'm next door in Orange County; City of Orange :-}
