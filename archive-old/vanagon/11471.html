Subject: Re: [f] Friday poem, Help me!!!


&gt;
&gt;   I think that I shall never scan
&gt;   A poem lovely as a van--
&gt;   A Volksy van that gets me there,
&gt;   And home again without a care.
&gt;
    I think that I have always ran
    Faster than my little van.
    That little bus,
    rose a fuss,
    And now I'm sitting on my can.

    It used to be my shiny coupe,
    Now it is a chicken coop.
    Then I bought myself a wrench,
    worked and worked and raised a stench.
    Now I'll eat this bowl of soup.

    I pushed and pulled and banged and pried,
    you'll never know how hard I tried.
    I sweat and swore and heaved and ho-ed,
    I'll never get this damn thing towed.
    I worked so hard I nearly cried.

    Then one day my work was done,
    Now my bus again can run.
    Forty and and forty nights,
    Someone please turn out the lights.
    Wasn't that a lot of fun?

Wolf
