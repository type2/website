Subject: BBTA: listmembers only dinner?
Date: Wed, 28 Aug 1996 23:23:51 -0500 (CDT)

I only got a couple replies to my previous post, so here it is again, an
invitation to the listmembers attending Busses by the Arch to eat out on
Sunday: 

It might be nice if members from both lists could all meet in St.Louis's
main activity place, the &quot;Loop&quot;  area, for beer and burgers at Blueberry
Hill. I imagine that, by then, some of you will have grown a tad weary of
the (probably soaked and muddy :)  campground. 

The Loop is St.Louis's &quot;in&quot; place, very hip, very pleasant; it has plenty
of bars, cafes, restaurants, art galleries, and also Tivoli's, the
restored Art Nouveau movie theatre. The Loop is at the 6500 block of
Delmar Blvd. Send me an e-mail if you're interested in such a get-together
and/or if you need directions. 

We can discuss details on Saturday, but if you are even remotely
interested, please let me know soon.

Thanks,

Sami ('75 Westf.)
