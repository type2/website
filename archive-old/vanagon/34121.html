Subject: semaphores

Hello Brian-
	You want to know everything about semaphores???? That is a tall 
order. Probably the world expert on semaphores is Jeff Slater of 
Lynnwood, WA. I do not know if he is opn-line. I can get his mailing 
address if you are interested. 
	I have done some research on semaphores and have some 
information. If you could be a little more specific, I will respond.
	A couple bits of information that may help:
	1) Semaphores made before 1955 had the old VW numbering system on 
them. Those made late 1955 and later used the nine number and 1 letter 
numbering system.
	2) Ribbed semaphores were used on vehicles through 1953. 1954's 
used the flat ones.
	3) There were two main manufacturers of VW semaphores, SWF and 
SHO. There are major differences between the two (in construction and 
operation). There seems to have been no rationale for installing them on 
vehicles, however (I have seen two cars, original, with VIN's less than 
100 numbers apart with different company semaphores.
	4) Some countries made semaphores illegal, so there are a large 
number of different types of lights that bolted into the semaphore slot 
on the door piller. Holland was one of those countries that made them 
illegal.
	I have a chart that lists all the known types opf semaphores, the 
manufacturer, and the time frame in which they were used. It would be 
tedious typing it into the net, but I would be willing to send you a copy 
snail mail if you will forward an address.
	Hope this was helpful. Let me know if you need more information.
