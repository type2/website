Subject: Re: Vanagon back hatch

&gt; 
&gt; Vanagon owners!
&gt; 	I'm relatively new in the vanagon scene but I've noticed
&gt; with many of the vanagons that the ...I'm not sure what they are
&gt; called...maybe support struts that hold up the back hatch have
&gt; been under designed.  They must go bad after about 7 years.
&gt; It was interesting to see the creative ways of proping   ping up that
&gt; deADLY hatch.  I'm currently using a tomato stake.  Anyway
&gt; is there or has there been anything designed to replace
&gt; these wimpy struts?  
&gt; 
&gt; Roberrt  t
&gt; 
I tried 2 things:

WalMart sells some plastic artifact that fits in the hydrolic....I am not sure either. 

Use a Vice-Grip to lock the latch in place.

These work well and better than replacing the.... I am not sure either at about $55/piece.
