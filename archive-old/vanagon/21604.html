&gt;Has anyone replaced the sunroof seal on a 68-79 metal sunroof bus?  I have

I replaced the seal on my 79 sunroof.  I've never seen a write up, although a
recent VW Trends issue had a write up on rebuilding a Bug sunroof.  I just
kinda winged it.  

You use contact cement, applying an ample amount around the rim of the
sunroof.  Also apply cement to the backside of the felt seal.  Because the
seal is felt, it absorbs the cement somewhat, so you will probably want to
put two coats on (I did).  Once the cement on both the rim and the felt get
tacky (and glossy) you just press it into place, starting from the center of
the rear side of the rim.  The top of the seal should be even with the top of
the rim (the roof).  The cement bonds instantly, so do this carefully.  It
may also help to have someone holding the felt and feeding it to you as you
need it.

Overall, it's actually really simple.  It fits perfectly into the gap between
the sunroof and the roof.  And it doesn't leak (at least nothing that your
drains can't handle).

Good luck!
