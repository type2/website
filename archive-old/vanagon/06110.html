Subject:  LONG BLOCK vs SHORT BLOCK??

I have a 91 VW vanagon and would like to know the difference when some
body (vw) says they are either going to replace the long Block or the short 
block....I was told a long block is just a complete engine with alternators...sheet metal and other parts strapped on, while the short block is 
the core, pistons, and heads and valves...thanks in advance
john.
