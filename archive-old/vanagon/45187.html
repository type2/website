Subject: Re: vanagon fuel pump relay

The fuel pump is designed to be powered during startup, and
&gt; then to be powered while the engine runs.  If the engine stops, the fuel
&gt; pump is supposed to stop with it

  This is exactly what I thought about when I first read the post about 
the fuel pump problem.
