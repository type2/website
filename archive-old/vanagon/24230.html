This is a little old, but it wouldn't post last week:

&gt; &gt;Kevin, I've seen pix of a boat that was designed to fit on a standard vw
&gt; &gt;van top, but never heard of this one.  Love to see it.
&gt; 
&gt; Remember &quot;where&quot; you saw a photo? I too remember seeing or reading about
&gt; the &quot;boat-top&quot; but for the life of me can't find it in my reference stuff.
&gt; 
Found a couple of pix on page 41 of the June 86 HVWs.  The original 
was created by a Mr. Liptak; in the photos it's on top of a 
23-window.  The article sez a Rick Shine, who would reportedly be 
replicating the thing, was at a &quot;Winter Meet&quot; at 
the Puyallup Fairgrounds in Seattle (3/86).  It also mentions an 
article on the boat in the 11/85 &quot;Transporter Talk&quot; column (don't 
have that one).

I think I remember seeing a fuller spread somewhere.  Maybe some of 
you listers are more anal than me?  Dig thru them back ish's, gang!
