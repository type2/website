Subject: Re: Antenna Mounting

I had my phone installed and the antenna is mounted on the drivers side in
the far back window. I also had the main tel. box installed under the drivers
seat so I can take the unit and use it in my other car. Antenna works fine.
Same ones you see mounted on the rear window of most cars..
