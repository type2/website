Subject: KOMBI ON FIRE or A GOOD WAY TO CLEAN THE ENGINE?
Date: Thu,  5 Oct 1995 12:41:21 GMT



Last night, on the way home from work, the classic symptoms happened
to me. Now, realize that I am very careful with the fuel lines--new
rubber hoses every two years, clamps at both ends of every hose, good
rubber grommet around the metal pipe through the metal firewall, etc.

I was headed up a hill after getting off the freeway. I had been
driving for 17 miles at 65 mph (105 kph), so the engine was nice and
hot. As I went up the hill, I noticed sudden power loss and strong
smell of gasoline at about the same time.

I pulled over to the side of the road, turned off the ignition, got
out of the bus, and opened the engine lid. No flames! Whew! Clean
engine, all grease and oil swept away by the gasoline that had been
spurting out the fuel pump.

The small outlet brass pipe or fitting going to a rubber fuel line to
the carburetor had popped out of the fuel pump. It is apparently just
a pressure fit.

I pounded it back in place and waited for the rest of the gasoline to
evaporate.  Then I drove slowly home.

This was a close call. Could have been a bad fire. But at least the
engine is clean.
