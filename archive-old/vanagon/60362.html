Subject: Re: Bug Out 38 Get-together

Ooops.  I am planning on going to the bug out, but forgot to make
reservations for a campground.  Can anyone recommend a nice campground
(playground is a plus) that might still have space?  

Also,  can someone give me directions to the bug out?  I would be coming from
DC on Rt 66.

Thanks,
