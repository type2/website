Subject: '74 bus -- free (NE MASS.) (fwd)

&gt;From: miketnyc_at_aol_dot_com (MikeT nyc)

I have am orange '74 VW bus that anyone can have who wants it.  Last run 6
years or so ago, but ran well then and has gas stabilizer in it.  Two flat
tires (though unmounted replacements inside), and two new, never-installed
heater boxes. Body rust but no structural rust under the floor pan that I
can see.  When I last used it, its only real problem was that the parking
brakes didn't work, and a previous owner had let the clutch cable get so
slack that the clutch wasn't freeing and it ruined the synchromesh in the
transmission.  New clutch cable now, but you have to doubleclutch shift by
feel, like a motorcycle -- it is not a problem, ince you're used to it. 
Only other problem is that it badly needs a tuneup, a new battery, and has
a slight leak from one pushrod tube.

This bus is sitting in my mother's backyard in northeastern Massachusetts,
and I'm now a busy professional in NYC.  Couldn't keep this bus on the
streets of NY, but I'm still fond of it, and it easily made the round trip
twice to move here.  I'd very much prefer to give it to someone who will
restore it and love it -- not part it out.

I'll be up there for awhile after Christmas.  e-mail if you're interested.
