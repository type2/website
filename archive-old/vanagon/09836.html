I never got many greetings while driving around SJ either.  I think it's
because of the Big City crowd mentality;  if no one looks at each other,
then they don't have to be involved in any way.  That way, if you piss
the guy off by driving too slowly or some other awful transgression,
he can cut you off, slam on the brakes, flip you off, honk at you, or
punish you in some other justifiable manner, and not feel at all guilty
about it, which he would if he had waved at you the day before!

Bah!  I don't miss it a bit!!
