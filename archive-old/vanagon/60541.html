Subject: Retrofitting AC to Westy

Hi All,

There have been a few posts in the last few months about people removing
their AC.  As the weather has started warming up here and I really suffered
with last summer's record heat, I was toyin with the idea of retrofitting AC
from another vanagon to mine.
Any thoughts on wether this is feasible or worth doing.  

Thanks
