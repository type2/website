Subject: Bus almost running, must sell VW Rabbit Convertible

Now that my bus is almost up and running I have to get rid of my 1982 VW
Rabbit Convertible.  The Rabbit has just over 60,000 miles on a remanufactured
engine (work performed by VW dealer).  Many new parts in the last couple of
years such as struts all around, exhaust, alternator, and CV joints.
Over all a very reliable car.  There is no rust or accident damage. It is
white with a tan top.  Runs great!!!  Ready to enjoy the sun!!!
It is located in Saratoga Springs, New York.  Asking $3000.
E-mail me here or call (607) 324-5708 or (518) 587-5276.
