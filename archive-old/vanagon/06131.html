&gt;I may have missed a thread here, but what is the advantage of registering
&gt;as an historical vehicle?  And what exactly *is* the criteria for such
&gt;registration?

I don't think there _was_ a thread, but there is now...!

In California (and other states) there are alternate registration &quot;classes&quot;
that a car can be put into.  Historical Vehicle is one.

To be registered as a HV the car has to be 25 years old or more.  It has 
to have some hsitorical interest, which boils down to you saying so.

Now for the fun part.  Officially, you are only s'posed to drive them
in events, such as parades, shows,etc.  But with my '67, I had normal
registration but with a HV plate.  OR at least I _think_ I did...  
I was pulled over twice in it, and the fuzz never made any squeak about 
the HV status.  I still wonder if it really _really_ a HV in the DMV 
computer.

The license plates actually say &quot;Historical Vehicle&quot; on them, in
red letters on a white background, one word above the other.  There
is then a 4 digit number to the right of that.  My last one was
511D.  On the registration, the plate was given as HV511D.

The other bonus of registering as a HV is the tax dodge.  They will waive
any outstanding fees on the vehicle.  I would have had to pay almost
$350 dollars in back fees and penalties if I had registered it normally.

Not only that, but people from all over will ask what the plate means!

I have seen similar plates from other states, but I don't know what 
goes on there.

There also &quot;Antique Vehicle&quot; plates, for (I think) '25 and prior, &quot;Purple
Heart Veteran&quot; Plates, &quot;Pearl Harbor Survivor&quot; Plates, &quot;Press Photographer&quot;
Plates, and a host of others.
