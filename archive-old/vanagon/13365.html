Steve: I don't have a diesel and don't have an auxiliary gas heater
either, but on both counts they would be on my $30,000 wish list. I figure
to buy a gas heater for our 82 right now would cost about the same as the
amount we paid for the van...

There are plenty o'Canadians with the gas heater system in their vans;
they should be able to shed some light on this....
