Subject: Intermittent Fuel Injection Problems (Pt II)

Sorry, I will try again.  I've got to be careful about hitting the wrong key
in Eudora! 

&gt;Hi all,
&gt;
&gt;I just read the February 1995 Electronics Now. Don Lancaster in the
&quot;Hardware &gt;Hacker&quot; section (p75) spends about 3 pages talking about the
problems he had with his &gt;Synchro.

It seems he was having the dreaded &quot;intermittent loss of power&quot; in his 87.
The dealer was not able to do anything about it and apparently didn't even
try the new wiring harness fix!

He eventually opened the computer box and tracked the problem to the solder
joints on a big power resistor.  The leads on the resistor are **steel** and
don't solder very well.  Resoldering solved the problem, and he suspects
that this might be the same problem that VW solved (circumvented?) with the
new wiring harness that Joel has talked about.

Anyway, Lancaster gives a pretty good description of the entire Bosch fuel
injection system.  I recommend it.  He also presents a strategy for finding
intermittent electrical problems, like the one I had with a shorted oxygen
sensor wire.

I can type in his 15 point outline and post it if anybody has an interest.
Just let me know.

By the way, I don't think I'll ever make it into the top 10 posters at this
rate. 

John
