subframe shouldn't be weaked

should be pulled down lower using jacks and a chain to hold the subframe to
a gutter.

Pull subframe down, then reinforce the subframe up the the vehicle frame so
you can off road bash it later on without worrying so much.

&gt;Dan,

&gt;  I've seen Or_felt_ the vibration symptom before!
&gt;
&gt;  We tried MANY things to cure this one ;
&gt;
&gt;  Replace the driveline with a New One.  Still there.  Took the
&gt;driveline off noise and feeling went away?  Old driveline back on, noise
&gt;back!  Humm.
&gt;
&gt;  After closer inspection we found that the exhaust pipe from 1-3 was
&gt;touching the Subframe at a certain speed and load causing this noise and
&gt;vibration.
&gt;
&gt;  I guess a combination of the Rear Motor Mounts, along with the Trans
&gt;mount becoming weak, the engine and trans sagged enough to let the pipe
&gt;touch!
&gt;
&gt;  Our customer was a budget minded one, he wanted us to clearance the
&gt;subframe.  We cut a &quot;slot&quot; in it so the pipe had room to move.  We
&gt;didn't take away anything from the structure of the subframe doing
&gt;this.  The slot is about 1&quot; by 5&quot;'s.
&gt;
&gt;  I've heard other people having this problem too?  I've told a few
&gt;people about this scenerio and others have found it too.  Ironically we
&gt;had a second Syncro at the same time as this first one do this at the
&gt;same time?  Maybe the mounts have sagged and ovetime this is bound to
&gt;happen?
&gt;
&gt;  Hope this info is useful to someone.
