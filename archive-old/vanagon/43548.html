Subject: help on 65

And still more problems on my Girlfriends 65.  I don't know much about
these older busses; hers is a 23(21?) window, with a sunroof, real nice.
It has, I think, a 73 superbeetle engine.  Maybe a 74.  Nevertheless.

1.  Generator's toast.  Tried to get it out but have this problem.  The
idiot's guide and bentley manual say raise the fan shroud.  Ok, but one of
the screws I'm supposed to unscrew is behind the manifold (left side) :-|.
So alright, whatever, I don't think it'll matter anyway because I got the
RHS off and I raise the shroud as high as it will go and I'm not getting
that fan out!  I tried to take off the oil filler/generator support, but I
can't even get the generator high enough for the support to clear its
bolts!  (And to get it it's front (FIF) nut off I had to take of the fuel
pump, whose front nut necessitated removal of the distributor (the knee
bone's connected to the ....).

Help please!!

2.  Was changing the front tire.  The place where you stick the jack is
rusty as hell.  I didn't know how rusty until Anne stepped into the bus,
and a god-awful crunch emanated from that area, all kinds of rust chips
flew everywhere, and the bus bent in that area.  Any way to fix this rust
in a hurry?

Thanks so much in advance,
Eric and Gerty (the bus, not my girlfriend, tho Anne thanks you too)
