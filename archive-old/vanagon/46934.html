Subject: 2.1L vs. 1.9 L? and other questions

Has anyone replaced a 1.9 L with a 2.1 L in their Vanagon?  Is 
there a marked improvement in performance - enough to be worth the 
hassle?  Also, what IS the hassle?  What has to be modified to make 
the 2.1 work in my '85?  (I understand that there are other 
changes, like the cooling lines, etc.?) 

For that matter, are there any other mechanical changes/design 
improvements on this '87 parts van I just bought that I should 
consider retrofitting into my '85?  I thought I would start with 
the headlights, but I don't know what else got better as the years 
went on.
