Subject: power window repair

Hi y'all.  I've got an 89 Westy GL .   I just noticed that my passenger side
power window wouldn't raise or lower entirely.  I pulled out the Bentley, but
not much is said about repair.  However,  I did pull out the window motor,
cable winder, and window guide (all one unit), and noticed that the winder
had wound too much cable, kinked it up, and as a result, had pulled one of
the plastic (bottom) guides off the main metal guide unit.

Here's the rub... I've unwound the kinked up winder unit,  put all the pieces
back together on the floor of the van,, but I can't see what keeps the little
top and bottom plastic guides I refer to in place on the main metal post(
window guide).  I did find one small metal clip of some sort in the bottom
recess of the door, but can't figure how that relates to holding either of
these plastic guides in place... Any experienced repair help out there?  


thanks.
