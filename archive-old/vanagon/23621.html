Subject: BEST YEAR for WATERBOXER?

Greetings
          In reading through my spec sheets I see that the '86 and '87 model
 waterboxers had the most horsepower (95hp).  Are they the best years overall
 or is there another favorite year?  Or are they all the same?  If you have
 experiences/stories about yours or someones waterboxer please send.  I now
own a '71 bus (one of the best early years) and I want to add a waterboxer
to my collection as a daily driver.   

Thanks, Martin
