Subject: group photo..

Is anyone of the lenti(l) persuasion (that means you) interested being
a part of a group photo(s).  I was thinking if people wanted to send 
photos of themselves or more appropriately their busses/vans, I convert
them into a collage or collages and scan and then send them to someones
home page (Thom?).  I know this list is growing... maybe it would require
a few collages, say regional or sumpin......
I know it's not friday yet.. I'm feelin' a bit Vaklempt....the above
is the topic....tawk amonst yourselves.....
