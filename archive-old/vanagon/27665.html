Subject: Possible Personalized Plates 

After all I've spent on this new car I figured I might spring 
for personalized license plates, just for the hell of it.  It 
would be interesting to hear from any of you with 
personalized plates possessing a high amusement 
factor/Vanagon connection - especially outside CA, so I can 
steal your idea for my California plates!  I had one idea of 
my own already:

          I V W V W 

(It's a Syncro, of course!) Is this too obscure?  Will 
anybody &quot;get it&quot;?
