Subject: 1980 westy faucet assembly

Hey! I'm looking for a faucet assembly for my friends 80Westy. And..I'm
just happy happy happy that this list exists.My 87 synchro has a
bad(froze up) Ujoint on the propellor/drive shaft.  My local dealer
wants $1,100 for a new driveshaft. Yikes!!  I'm currently
debating(mostly with myself) as to whether I should replace the U joints
or go for the $450 driveshaft D Haynes has mentioned. Any comments are
welcome. Sitting 2wd
in a foot of snow in Montana.
Thanks one and all.            Rob
