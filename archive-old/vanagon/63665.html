&lt;&lt; I would, however, be willing to cut out my wheel wells and install the
 fender lips to get some 16&quot; on. Derek, is this all you're doing or are
 you going full mods? My main goal is more clearance and lower RPM's at
 highway speeds. &gt;&gt;


Deja Vu....   :&lt;)   The '70's are back!!!  
(ever seen all those splitties w/ the hacked out wheelwells, and wondered why
someone would do such a thing???...  :&lt;)
Hmmm...whats next?
shaggy carpet glued to the headliner, and &quot;taillight enhancements&quot; or how
'bout some Vanagon fiberglass stick-on side air scoops....  :&lt;)

just kidding, gracie...  :&lt;)
