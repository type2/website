&gt; &gt; I am looking at a 1959 bus.  The owner says that it has a bad transmission.
&gt; &gt; I talked to a local VW mechanic and he says to make sure that it is the
&gt; &gt; transmission and not the gear boxes out near the wheels.  He says that
&gt; &gt; neither the transmission nor the gear boxes can be rebuilt.  He says that a
&gt; &gt; transmisson can be found if it is not a split case, but the gear boxes can
&gt; &gt; not be found.  He told me that the gear boxes are not made by anyone.  He
&gt; &gt; has a couple of bus transmissions on hand with bad gear boxes and says they
&gt; &gt; are junk.  Is all this true?  I just find it hard to believe that no one
&gt; &gt; rebuilds these things.
&gt; 
&gt; Those transmissions can be rebuilt, just takes know-how.  I'm told
&gt; by reputable sources that it takes rebuilding several before you
&gt; actually get one right.
&gt; 
&gt; Up to sometime in mid-'59, busses used a split case trans.
&gt; 
&gt; Not much can really happen to reduction box gears, since they are
&gt; pretty much locked together.  Bearings go bad, which are not all
&gt; that expensive.  The only thing you can do wrong is run out of
&gt; fluid.
&gt; 
&gt; If you have a &quot;split-case bus&quot; like my '56, you can get an adapter
&gt; put in a later transmission, otherwise known as a &quot;tunnel case.&quot;

You can also swap nose cones to mount a newer trans.

Both Wolfburg West and BusBoys have helped me with my parts needs. I'm sure 
there are others.

Unless this bus is a flower pot or something, I'd pick it up.

Have fun.
