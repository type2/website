Subject: EuroVan bra for sale....


I just had a friend give me a new bra for my EV. Currently the EV has a 
bra....a 4yr old one that I bought shortly after buying my EV. The old bra 
still has lots of life left in it and is in good shape. If anyone is 
interested, it can be had for $35 plus shipping.
