Subject: Nice Camper (not for sale) San Diego

Noticed this Westy about a week ago, it's a blue/aqua color below and some other 
shade on top, but it's nicely painted. What I noticed was the frame mounted in 
front of the front bumper, room for a spare tire held off the front sheet metal 
with a bicycle rack built around and above it. 

Stopped to write them a note when I noticed it parked on the way home, noticed 
the large light on the rear roofline, the big antenna mounted in a bracket on the 
side of the bus, the nicely curved diamond steel plate protecting the back of the 
engine bottom... Really nice useful camper details, done well.
