Subject: Re: Brake Fluid ??


&gt; The Bently Mannual states that only Dot 4 brake fluid be applied to 
&gt; Vanagons.  Does anyone know the difference between Dot 3 &amp; Dot 4.  I have a 
&gt; ton of Dot 3, can I use it or is that stupid.
&gt; 

You can use, but should not have a ton as it goes bad if open, best 
bet is new DOT4 Castrol GT/LMA from WALMART at $1.79 the 12 oz 
container, superior to VW.  Brake fluid absorbs water and then boils 
in an open container it absorbs it faster.  DOT 4 boils at higer 
temps and absorbs less water but is compatible with DOT 3, use no DOT 
5 under any circumstances.

&gt; Also, I seem to be losing brake fluid, filled it 1.5 months back and now it 
&gt; need more.  Anyone have any suggestions?  Could it be the lines or is it 
&gt; more likely the brake assembly somewhere?

I'd imagine most likely a rear wheel cylinder leaking.  You should 
change the fluid every 2 years to prevent system corrosion, also 
could easily be a leaking clutch cylinder (clutch and brake use same 
resevoir, but clutch feed is high on side so it can't run your brakes 
dry.  Rear wheel cylinders available at any major chain parts store 
for $15 or so OEM VW Brazil, Varga brand name.  Takes maybe an hour 
to change one and flush the system, flush/bleed the clutch too BTW 
its slave cylinder is $50, its master $65.
