Subject: 77 Engine Wiring Questions

Well the engine is back in, everything's pretty much hooked up except for a
couple of wires...I know, I know, I really should have been more diligent
in labeling all the connections...I should know better...

1. Black wire coming out from the front/right of the engine compartment,
2nd hole, on the right, coming out with a large group of bundled wires,
about 6 inches long..where's it go?

2.Of the group of wires going to the coil, there's a blue/black connector
with a rectangular plastic connector. Does this attach to the coil, or the
oil pressure sender? If not the oil sender, which wire connects to the
sender?

3.The 3 prong ground under the fuel manifold, that's connected to the case
and has two white wires connected to it, does anything else connect to it?

4. One more...cylinder head temperature sender, connects to which wire?

Sorry for all the questions, I think everything else is hooked back up
right. Should the coil have 5 or 6 wires connected to it? The engine is
fuel injected. I've tried using the wiring diagram in the Haynes manual and
it's about useless to me...Thanks again, once I get these answers it's time
to try and start it!  Tom
