&gt; Subject: removing front hubs

&gt; &gt;I'm having problems with the front
&gt; &gt;ones - how do you get the cover/seal thing in the centre of the hub off? (not
&gt; Sarah
&gt;         I had mine off a couple of weeks ago. The trick for me was to get
&gt; the front end up on axles stands and with a small hammer ( I used one with
&gt; a hard plastic head) started whacking away, while rotating the wheel. This
&gt; distributed the whacks evenly, and the hub just slowly eased out. I worked
&gt; about 10 minutes with the hammer, not so hard as to have my arm aching or
&gt; anything. This dented up the cap, but only slightly.

Whoa!  Did I miss something?  Unless there was MAJOR change
in design that I missed between '62 and '67, I thought an
acceptable substitute for special VW tool 23420934820 was a
simple claw hammer or prybar to just pry the cap off as you
would open a can of house paint.  No muss, no fuss, and
certainly no dented caps.

&gt;         Remember to remove the speedometer cable clipped into the centre of
&gt; the hub, on the left side. Good luck.

Good point.
