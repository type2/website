Subject: Re: RMMW part problem -- beware! :)


76&gt;By now you know that it's not that simple.  I went out to the bus to put it 
76&gt;and the holes in the panel don't match up to the holes in the door!!  They'r
76&gt;not even close at all!  So I say, hmm this is a very expensive poorly design
76&gt;panel.  

This is not entirely RMMW's fault, indeed parts bus I had was a '74 and
had a beutiful rear hatch panel, went to put it on the '76 before I
sold it
and to my suprise, holes did not line up, not at all.  Both used the
through
panel chromed clip, but holes in entirely different places on the hatch.
They simply drilled on the hatch differently for no apparent reason I
could
see.  I imagine re-drilling the hatch holes or looking for a nice
junker a
better solution.  When I saw this panel listed in the new RMMW catalog I
wondered myself about the '68-'79 call.  It is clearly incorrect and
somebody
should tell them so.
