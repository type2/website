Subject: memory loss from unplugging battery?

I know I'll lose the clock and radio station settings when removing 
the ground strap from the battery.  Anything else I should be 
concerned about?  Performance stuff from the digital elephant, uh 
Digifant?  Presumably there's stuff in ROM somewhere for just such an 
occasion.
