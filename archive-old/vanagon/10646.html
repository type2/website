Subject: Cool Resto Trick!

I made the coolest save yesterday!

I had pulled the wiper switch out of my '56 bus, but it was all froze up.
Figuring I had nothing to lose, I dunked it overnight in this stuff my SO
used to get water stains out of things.  This stuff looks, smells and
wroks exactly like the OxySolve stuff that Eastwood sells, but for mucho 
less bucks!

The stuff is called CLR (Calcium, Lime, Rust) and she got it at the hardware
store.  It was about $5 for 28 ounces.  Eastwood gets $20 for 16 ounces!

After soating it overnight, I gently presuaged it with a screwdriver, (its
a push-pull switch) and I could see the liquid rust on the shaft as it came
out!  I just worked it from there, and after playing with it some more, its
as good as new!

So, for the hat trick, (Ok, so its only the 2nd score!) I took the engine
latch assembly, which was a case of tetanus waiting to happen, and dunked
it in a bowl of this stuff overnight.  The next morning, it was mostly clean
metal except for a couple of spots that looked kinda muddy where the rust
was real deep.  I scrubbed it a little with a toothbrush, and dunked it
again in another batch of the stuff.  It ate all of the rust off, everywhere!
You can see little holes where the rust used to be!

I wish I could dunk my bigger pieces in this stuff, but that would be kinda
expensive!  It only seems to work good if you can leave your stuff immersed in
it.

The other kinda kool thing is that it fizzes like hydrogen peroxide on the
rustier parts!

Now, the disclaimer.  I don't have any interest, financial or sexual, in
this company or the sales of its product.  Blah blah blah. Snottjhklg lj
