Fron their ad in VWTrends:
&quot;ENERGY PAK is a patented on-board microship computer that continuously
senses electrical resistance across the sparkplug gap, thereby making each
plug an &quot;in-cylinder&quot; sensor to optimize each spark on each and every
stroke of the engine.&quot;

So I called them and they happen to have a sale ending today. Their
&quot;BUG-PAK&quot; now goes for $340 instead of $480. Well, that's still too
expensive for me, but I thought some of you might want to know.

Btw, they guarantee a 14% hp increase, 10% more torque, and 2-3 mpg
increased mileage for my '75 1800 FI type 4 engine. I have a hard time
understanding Texan drawl, but he may have said something about increasing
coil (??) efficiency from 71% to 98%.

I talked to a guy named Ed (ext. 3046), who ultimately offered me a 60-day
no questions asked money-back warranty. Tell him I sent you. Their # is
1-800-627-8800.
