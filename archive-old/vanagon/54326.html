Subject: RE: 88 Vanagon with &quot;thing&quot; on steering column??

&gt;You dog!  Heated seats?  Is there anyway on earth the rest of us mere
&gt;mortals could aquire such a luxury

on the usual VW budget I'd suggest beans and a Bic lighter. Why mess about
with plain old electricity when modern natural gas can meet all your needs!
bye, tim


sreiously, you can buy them to plug into a lighter socket.
