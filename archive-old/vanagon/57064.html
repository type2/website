Subject: Changing Lightbulbs

Here I thought it would be so easy ... I took off the cover for the front
turn indicator light, no problem. Next I melted the big ice cube out of it.
On to remove the light bulb -- after getting off as much corrosion as
possible from the bulb holder ... OK, the glass part of the bulb came out in
one piece. But the metal bottom of the bulb is tightly stuck in there. I
thought I'd disconnect the bulb holder from the wires holding it -- but no,
those are corroded on as well. So, is there a way to get these wires loose
from the bulbholder  without breaking any delicate little metal parts?
