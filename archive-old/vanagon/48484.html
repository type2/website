that's okay.  us &quot;oldies&quot; have such lousy memories that it is likely 
we've either forgotten about it or forgotten the solution.

What I've got: 1988, 2109cc, 82kW with Digijet injection
&gt; Engine was completely renovated 18 months ago.

when did the problem arise?  after the rebuild or recently.

 My problem is:
&gt; Pre-ignition under load (pinking). I have checked all the settings
&gt; and they are as specified in the manual that I have, i.e. CO Vol
&gt; 2.0, Ignition Timing 10 deg BTDC. 

a couple more questions:  what fuel octane are you using?  also, the 
ignition timing must be checked and set with a specific set of 
conditions as noted in the BGBB (Big Green Bentley Book).  if the 
timing was set without adhering to the procedure, it could be off.

also, although your CO level is normal, you *may* have a lean 
condition caused by a variety of things, including a bad fuel 
pressure regulator.  if it is convienient, have the NOx checked and 
if this is sky high, start looking for items to cause a lean 
condition.  this will cause pinking and generally poorer performance.


&gt;Is there anyone out there who can
&gt; come up with a solution?

probably not, but that won't stop us from giving you advice.
