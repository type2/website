&gt; Does anyone have any suggestions on how to replace/repair the pop-top
&gt; screen for an '81 Westfalia?  Ours has numerous holes in it, but the canvas
&gt; of the top is intact, so I don't want to replace the entire thing.

Can't help with the screen, but I thought I'd mention that JC Whitney
sent me a &quot;sale&quot; catalog of VW parts last week, and lots of stuff has
been marked down, including heat exchangers and pop-top tents.  The
71-74 heat exchangers are down from $200 to $165 and the tents range
from 200-300.
