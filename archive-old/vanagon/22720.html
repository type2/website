Subject: Off to the Vinyard...


Yep...hopefully if the hurricane doesn't head north and hit the
island...

We're loading the EV onto the boat tomorrow nite and heading to
the island...home of the Teddy Kennedy Swim-with-your-back-brace-in-
a-drunken-fog Marathon.....

Martha's Vinyard...and its smaller appendage..Chappaquidik


I wonder howmany EVs are on the island...or have ever made
it to the island...

I wonder, in the great Kennedy tradition, if EVs float...

A full report will follow...

PS.  Remember...EAST COAST VANAGON GATHERING - Woodstock NY 9/9-9/10!!
