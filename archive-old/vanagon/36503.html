Subject:  help! turn signal development

Hey all,

Yet another chapter in Sean's turn signal mystery.  

I have electrically tested my hazard flasher switches (the one currently
installed and the old one) as per Bentley and here is what I have found:
The one currently installed (which I got off of a junked '73) is perfectly
OK.  All resistance is 0 ohms (really about .3 of an ohm).  When I
checked my old one then I discovered that the resistance between
terminal 30 and terminal + was way off the scale.  This is not the
development as the one currently installed has been there since before
this trouble started.  Anyway,

Still trying to diagnose, I noticed this:  When I removed the flasher relay
so that the space on the relay panel was blank, THERE WAS NO
CHANGE IN MY SYMPTOMS.  That is, when either switch is pulled on,
the indicator lights up and stays steadily lit while the outside lights do not
light up.  This happens WHETHER OR NOT THE RELAY IS THERE.  This
struck me as very interesting.  All I know right now is that I'm definitely
getting power to the indicator light.  Does this mean that I have a short
somewhere?  If so, how do I go about testing for a short?  I'm not
blowing any fuses.  However, when I first replaced the flasher relay last
week, when I pulled the switch on, it blew the fuse.  It mysteriously
stopped doing this one day.  Could this be related?  Could I maybe have a
short in my flasher switch?  Does anyone know what the resistance is
supposed to be between terminal 30 and terminal 31 (ground) on the
flasher switch?  When I measured it with my ohmmeter, it was off the
scale.  Granted, I was only using a 200 ohm scale, but does this sound
right to anyone?  BTW, I measured it with the switch in the on position.  

I know that power is making it to the relay because with the relay in
place, I can hear it click on when I turn the switch on.  What puzzles me
is the fact that the symptoms are exactly the same without the relay in
place.  

Does anyone know what might be going on?

All help greatly appreciated,
Sean
