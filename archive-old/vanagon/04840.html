So Jack Stafford says:

&gt; Obviously, your Vanagon has a slightly different config. that may
&gt; completely cover the sheet metal of the roof.   Sorry, Steven I'm not
&gt; that familiar with Vanagons, but I'm learning!  :)

That's okay, I'll just stick with the cheapo fm/cb antenna feed adaptor
for that cheezy but low profile setup.

Cheers!

Steven
