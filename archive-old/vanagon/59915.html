I have been staying quiet on this subject, but feel the need to pipe up 
now.  I like getting this information as email.  I know alot of people 
get their email through their web browser, but I am not one of them.  
This means that I don't even open my browser unless I need to go surfing 
for info.  I don't think I would be as diligent about getting and reading 
the mail if I had to change my routine, not that it would be that hard, I 
just am used to this, and it works well.
Joel, have you been keeping stats on list member opinions?
