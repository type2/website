Subject: Rebuild update


Hello, fellow Vanagon drivers.  With the help of you all, Bentley, Haynes,
and the Idiot's guide, I have now completely dismantled my engine of my
dear friend, the 82 Vanagon.  I'm really glad I decided to do it myself.
Its *really* neat to see how everything works in there!!!  I'm actually having
a great time.

I have decided to purchase a full set of rebuilt heads, cylinders and pistons.
One of my heads is badly cracked and two of the pistons/cylinders have
seize marks on them.  I will probably be ordering the replacement parts from
Restoration Parts, Inc. in California because they had reasonable prices, and
the guy I talked to was very helpfull and knowledable.  The heads will have
a one year waranty.  This place also sell new heads for about the same amount
of $$, but I was not certain about the quality.  I feel rebuilt VW heads 
are a safer bet.

The crankshaft, rods, camshaft, and case look like they are in very good 
shape, so I will not be opening the crank case.  Ancilliary stuff on the 
engine that I plan to replace, include the oil pump, fuel lines, vacuum hoses,
and the *&amp;_at_#&amp; thermostat.  I will also replace the fan end oil seal
which was destroyed by my shredded A/C belt (I think I will be tossing the
A/C.  It never did work. Anyone interested?).  The seal on the other end 
was replaced with my new clutch no too long ago.

A couple of more questions:

Does anyone have any hints on bleeding the hydraulic tappets?
Two of the copper cylinder-head seals were displaced inwards.  What might 
   cause such a thing to happen?
Should I clean out the inside of the crankcase with some kind of solvent?

More questions later, I'm sure,

Albrecht
