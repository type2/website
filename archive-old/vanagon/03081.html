]&gt; &gt;...I drove about 65 mph and got 22 mpg.  Coming back, I drove between 65
]&gt; &gt;and 80, mostly 80, and got 21 mpg.
]&gt; &gt;Are these numbers reasonable--what I can expect? ...

]They look the numbers I get on my '84.  Just came back from a trip to
]the coast with 4 adults, 2 kids and a shit-load of stuff and my mpg was
]in the 21-22 range.

My '84 runs in a similar range.  My long trips are primarily between
Austin and Galveston (about 225 miles, one way), often loaded with all my
son's worldly possessions as he moves to and from school.  Fuel usage
seems remarkably unaffected by the considerable load, running 24 mpg
every time I've checked it but one (23 that time), and I usually run an
indicated 75 - 85 mph most of the way (including downtown Houston on
Interstates 10 and 45).  My aircooled T2s never did that well (speed OR
fuel economy).

I wonder what sort of fuel economy I'd get if I slowed to the speed limit
... naaah, I'll never find out.
