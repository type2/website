&gt;Gerry,

&gt;I appreciate the effort someone else is going to put into an aircooled
van 
&gt;list...however, I think that there has ALWAYS been something special on
this 
&gt;list which transcends air v water v T1 vT2 v T3 v T4 vans, and I would
hate 
&gt;to see this disapear when the split window/loaf/early brick crowd has
spun 
&gt;off onto another list....
&gt;
&gt;You said that this is in partial response to those who had problems with
the 
&gt;amount of traffic....to those I say (to play on H. Truman)...&quot;If you
can't 
&gt;stand the traffic, get off the list&quot;. 
&gt;
&gt;There are much more of us out there, I'm sure, who like the list and how
it 
&gt;is run, and who would rather have the list stay the way it has always
been 
&gt;handled.
&gt;
&gt;Could you please make the split optional? Besides, think of poor Richard

&gt;Palmer, he'll have to scrap his stock of V_at_L shirts and have to revert
to 
&gt;ones with late Vanagons and EVs only.
&gt;
&gt;PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE DON'T SPLIT THE LIST!!!
&gt;
&gt;I'll buy you extra beer!!!!!!
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;We are loosing our sense of &quot;community&quot; here....
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Ric

I hate to waste bandwidth and quote whole messages like this but this one
needs repeating.  There have been many efforts in the past to plit this
list and so far all have thankfully failed.  I would truely hate to see
this list split.

Please, Gerry, don't do it.  I'll even pay for your next years Twin
Cities Volkswagen Club membership. :-)
