&gt;engine? runs real strong but
&gt;coolant tank bone dry, upper tank full of green antifreeze

A friend of mine just had (I think) this problem in his '83 (?).
It required a head-gasket replacement, 'cause pressure was blowing
past the head into the cooling system, pressurizing it, and driving
the cooolant up to the overflow tank.  Apparently quite common,
he said.

But hey, for $600?  That's a hell of a deal...
