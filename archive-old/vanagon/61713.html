Subject: Campers for sale (LA area)

Saw two Vanagon pop top campers for sale this weekend.  They are parked for
display alongside the road on highway 133 south of LA just east of Laguna
Beach.  As you head towards the ocean, they are on your left, a coupla
miles apart.  One is white and has the pop top up, and the other is a
&quot;goldish&quot; color.

I was unable to stop and check any details just what I could see as we went
past.  The bodies appear in good shape with no obvious (from the road)
dents or crunches.  Price for either was not posted that I could see.

Harvey
