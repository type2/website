&gt; &gt; Hey Guys,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Just replaced the front speakers.  I found out a couple of things that
&gt; &gt; didn't seem to get mentioned before.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; First, if you got the molded plastic type stock blauplunk, the speaker
&gt; &gt; screws out.  On the inside of the panel there is a collar that acts like
&gt; &gt; a big nut to hold the speaker against the panel.  Second, The speaker is
&gt; &gt; glued to the molded plastic grill. It ain't worth even trying to reuse
&gt; &gt; the original grill.

&gt;      Hey Hotch,
&gt;         What speakers did you use? Did the grill fit with out interfering
&gt;         with the window crank?
&gt;

Eric,

I used Sony 4&quot; speakers, $60.  Yes, I had to bend the window cranks.
