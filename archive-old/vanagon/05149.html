&gt; &gt;In Skinned Knuckles magazine I saw an ad for a little filter they sell for
&gt; &gt;your coolant system. You put the filter in the coolant hose somewhere and it
&gt; &gt;catches little pieces of metal.
&gt; &gt;Good idea?

I would be concerned about the filter clogging and impeding the flow
of coolant, causing undue stress on the water pump.
