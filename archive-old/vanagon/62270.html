Subject: For the dreamers

After the discussion on engine swaps I went ahead and wrote for info. I
thought I'd post the infor here for those among us who have lots of cash to
spend. &lt;g&gt;

MSDS (Martin Schneider Designe Systems) offers 911 conversions for the
Vanagon. They note that their systems are designed only for the Carrera 3.2L
911 engine. Aparently this is the only one that will fit under the engine
cover. My favorite line in the brochure is:

&quot;Big Rig drivers have nicknamed the Vanagon as the &quot;moving guard rail&quot;. Can
you imagine their expressions when you pas the 18-wheelers on an upgrade?&quot;

Well, that satisfaction does not come cheap. Here are the kit prices. Does
not include the 911 engine or installation. MSDS will do the install for you
(call for prices)

4WD   1986-up                  $1,775.00
2WD    1980-up                    1,695.00

Kit includes all mounting parts, wiring and HD pressure plate and machined
flywheel ring. They make note that you can use a Porsche G50 transmission
instead of the VW unit. The kit is for manual transmissions only.

Options:
Electric 12v heater                 $122
4-tip muffler                           $209
Power steering relocation kit   $345
Tach recalibration                   $155
Front oil cooler                       $785

Looks pretty cool in the photos.

So, anyone from the list want to give it a go? I figure if we aproach them as
a group they will have to give us a list discount &lt;g&gt; !

BTW, MSDS does also ofter the Panzer brush guard which has the distinction of
the motor freight shipping cost being equal to the cost of the guard itself.
($179) 

Okay, here is the plan, we tell our families we are treating them to a trip
to Disneyland, and caravan to MSDS for the 911 conversion - explaining that
we are saving on parking and taking a special shuttle. Then our families
would be sufficiently distracted not to notice the 911 in the Vanagon....
 well, I can dream..

Note: I have no affiiation with MSDS and have no first-hand knowledge of
their products. I'm just providing the info for those interested.
