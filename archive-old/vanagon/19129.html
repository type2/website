Subject: oil pans on diesel vanagons
Date: Thu, 15 Jun 1995 07:40:16 -0600 (MDT)

Dear vanagon members,
The seats on the oil drain hole on my vanagon's oil pan have broken and I
need to know if anyone has an oilpan that they could part with?  I don't
really see an easy solution to getting this problem solved.  It seems that
the oil pan has seats inside the drain hole which the drain plug fit up
against.  The oilpan needs to fit a 1.6L diesel engine.
Thanks.
Oh, if you've run against this problem before, and fixed it without changing
the oil pan, I would sure like to know.
Stuart Hutton
