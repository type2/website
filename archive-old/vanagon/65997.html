Subject:      Just Bought the 78 Bus...Type2 List Address Needed

Its now official.....my 17 year old son and I are now co-owners of a 78
Deluxe Van...it has a sun roof (non-operable, but hopefully
repairable),sliding glass windows, 7 passenger seating and a gas heater.
Unfortunately it has a blown motor..but that shouldn't be a problem.

Now he can have something to haul himself and his gear to college next
September (somehow his GTI wouldn't be up to the task...and dad doesn't have
to worry about his &quot;low level&quot; flying in the GTI).

Anywho...._dot_can someone send me the instructions for signing up on te Type2
list? I misplaced mine, and I want to have my son sign on so he can begin to
be absorbed into the Type2 community.

Thanks in advance....
