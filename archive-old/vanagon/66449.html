&gt; Howdy,
&gt; When I start up my van in the morning, I sense only 3 pistions are
&gt; firing.  When I rev it a  little, it's even more obvious not all 4
&gt; pistons are firing.
&gt;
&gt; After a while everything seems ok and runs really well when it's a warmed
&gt; up.  This shouldn't be the case if everything is working right.  That
&gt; much I know.

When it is acting up, pull plug wires to find out which cylinder it is.
Then check spark.  If spark, probably wire is bad.  However, I suspect
it is the injector flooding the plug or something.

Check it out and get back.
