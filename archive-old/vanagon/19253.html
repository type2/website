Subject: FLASH:  party at Martha's tonite!


David Schwarze and Shelley are here!  We made it back from Yosemite and
want to have a vanagon bash here at my house this evening, let's say
starting at 6 pm.  You are all invited  :)  The only thing is that
since we've just returned from camping, there's not much to eat or
drink here (and we're in the middle of a difficult second battery
installation).  So I know this is not very polite, but I'd be 
very grateful for any appetizers/drinks you can bring along.  Bad
hostess behaviour, isn't it?  Anyway, if you can make it, please
let me know via e-mail (nrubin_at_s1.csuhayward) or by phone
(510)376-4321.  To make life easy, I'm posting directions below
from various possible ways to approach the area.  If you get lost
or need forther help, don't hesitate to call!  I urge you all to
come, because Schwarze lives in the San Diego area, doesn't get up
here all that often, and he has one AMAZING bus!  You can see the
microwave set up for yourselves first hand tonite, and that's only
the start of the set up he's got in there.  Also, this is the last
two days of the GNATT tour, so a party is in order, and it will be
a good chance to find out abo9ut the tour, and see the WONDERFUL
pictures Joel sent of Busses By The Arch.  Come one, come all. 
Bring beer/substances/etc.  :)  Prunehead will probably come too,
but I'm NOT going to allow him to burn any engine cases in my yard.

        -       Proceed Northbound on Interstate 680 to Walnut Creek
        -       Turn Left (Westbound) on Calif 24 toward Lafayette/Oakland 
(NOTE:         the turn is more of a split or &quot;Y&quot;  in the road than an offramp) 
                           -     Take third turnoff entitled &quot;Central 
Lafayette/Moraga&quot;
        -       Turn Right (Southbound) on First Street
                --      Proceed past overpass to first stoplight
        -       Turn Right (West) on Mt. Diablo Blvd.
                --      Get into left lane ASAP

For those coming thru the Caldecott tunnel from the OAKLAND side:

Take the third exit after the tunnel, called &quot;Orinda.&quot;  A
At the bottom of the exit, turn right onto Camino Pablo, which eventually 
changes names and becomes Moraga Road.  Proceed on this for approximately 4.5 
miles from the freeway.  It dead-ends in &quot;beautiful downtown Moraga,&quot; which 
doesn't contain a lot:  Safeway, Lucky, etc. 

At this light, turn left onto Moraga Road, and stay in the left lane.

Go approximately a mile or two, then turn left onto my street, Devin.
House is the third house on the right (counting the corner)
