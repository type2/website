Subject: Re: cruel trick to play on you're SO

Hey Thom... I can really relate to that err.. more or less anyway.  If
you've ever seen the Aschwanden  drawing &quot;Frontispiece,&quot;  in the opening
pages of Muir's Book you'll know what I'm talking about.  Well first of all
after a torrid roll in the hay with my SO,  she'll often look over at me, as
I have like a blank look of thought on my mug.  Then she'll usually ask
&quot;what are you thinking about.&quot;  At first I would fib and tell her 'you,'
but after further investigating and prodding she'll usually find out, I
don't know why, or how, but anyway she'll ask which VW are you thinking
about.  I'll oblige her and tell her which one and what I'm planning to do
to it.  This inspired me to write a letter to Eve Muir down in Sante Fe,
and tell her of our ongoing saga, and also asked her if she would sell us or
otherwise a print of the &quot;Frontispiece,&quot; Peter Aschwanden, drawing.  Eve
then wrote us back a handwritten letter and offered anecdotes about our
saga, she thought it was just a scream.  The significant part of the story
was that she sent along with her letter a signed print (12&quot; by 18&quot;) of the
Frontispiece. She is by and large the most sweetest person I think I've ever
corresponded with.  Since then we have had several correspondences (sp)
about the finer things in life and other brick-a-brack, and so on.    Just
thought I'd share. :)

&gt;I went in a couple hours later to see how she was doing, and she was
&gt;still quite groggy.  I snuggled up next to her, and started whispering
&gt;things like &quot;I want you so bad I can taste it&quot;  &quot;I can't wait till I
&gt;can ride you&quot;  &quot;Your the most beautiful thing I've ever laid eyee on&quot;
&gt;and so on.  Well, this got her attention all right, but what she didn't 
&gt;realize what I was looking thru the pictures I got yesterday of the '54...
