    Sorry,
     I don't see the relationship. You are seeing less power because
     of temperature difference in the engine. Never run the engine
     unless you are going to get it hot. Change the oil regually.

&gt; Hi All,
&gt; 
&gt; I would like to pick the V_at_L brain again. I have another lifter question that I
&gt; was wondering what others might think. I have an 83 wasserwesty that sat for a
&gt; while before I got it. It had some work done on it before I got it and they
&gt; said they changed the oil. I was going to change the oil again to be sure but
&gt; noticed that the drain plug looked like a beaver worked it over. I tried once
&gt; to get it out and said the hell with it I'll do it when I change the oil after
&gt; 3,000 miles. Needlesss to say it took an easy out &lt;&lt;&lt;cringe&gt;&gt;&gt; and a new drain
&gt; plug but I changed the oil. Oh yeah, back to the lifters. I started to get a
&gt; loud clack, clack in the morning. I know this is normal. But, the valve train
&gt; is especially noisy. I had a compression test done a while ago and one cylinder
&gt; was alittle lower than the rest. I know that worn lifters can cause lower
&gt; compression.  When I drive the valve system gets alittle quieter but still
&gt; seems to make noise (more from the head with low compression) Also when I drive
&gt; to work it feels alittle sluggish. If I shut it off and then drive it again it
&gt; feels like it has more power. When I leave work it feels like it is sluggish. I
&gt; think that the lifters are worn and that they are not compressing/expanding as
&gt; they should. When they are cold they are collapsed and the valves are
&gt; clattering and compression is lower. When they are charged there is less noise
&gt; and it seems to have more power. Should I replace them? Does this seem
&gt; reasonable or am I totally off base? Any help would be greatly appreciated.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks again.
