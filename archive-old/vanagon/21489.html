Subject: the VW Thing list


I'm considering reviving the VW Thing list, except that I don't
know anything about how to run a list-serv, nor do I, at the
moment, have the time to learn about it.  I'm WILLING to 
chair/host/run/whatever-you-call-it a list for the VW Thing,
but I would have to do so manually, and messages would not
be reflected out the instant that they arrive, but rather
in group bulk, once I &quot;tend&quot; to them.  Is this sort of
thing ever done on the 'net?
