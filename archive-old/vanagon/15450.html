Subject: Re: Alternatives to the 009 distributor

I have a 71 1600DP and I had a dual diaphragm but someone noticed by new
registration sticker (i'm in Cali) and stole it..but, get this, lovers of the
loaf, they put a 009 in the compartment! They didn't set the timing,
however...
Morals:1) Get a better lock (any ideas?)
2) Use OEM dist on 71 (better advance curve)
