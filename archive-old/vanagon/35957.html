&gt;Is someone have an idea where to find some screws for the curtains rails

Depending on wear of the metal, a number 6 or 8 sheet metal screw works
great.  When opening/closing the curtains, using two hands to move top and
bottom at same time will prevent the stresses that cause the screws to wear
the sheet metal and come loose.
