So Roberto says:
&gt; 
&gt; For those wishing to operate their 12vdc equipment from shore
&gt; power, the required twelve volt power supply need not be bulky. 
&gt; Modern switching power supplies do not use a heavy transformer,
&gt; unlike their bulkier ancestors.  
&gt; 
&gt; it replaced weighed about twenty pounds, was about 12&quot; x 6&quot; x 8&quot;
&gt; and was rated at only ten amps.
&gt; 

So, where did you mount your power supply and why?
