Subject:      rekeying locks

Pavneet,

I just had to do the same thing with the front door locks (actually one was
just clogged and one was broken like yours) and I got the handle from Kyle
at Volks motor sports--a VERY helpful guy-- and my local locksmith has no
problem doing it...

I will have all matching keys by the end of next week and when I bought my
van last September NONE of the locks matched...the guy I bought it from had
filed one key down to fit and another lock had been the result of some body
work or something, but anyway, the locksmith I went to had no hesitation
rekeying...

Good luck,

Greg
