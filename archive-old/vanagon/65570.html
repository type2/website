&lt;&lt; The value of a stainless exhaust probably depends on where you live. Here

 Texas I finally replaced the muffler on my '87 after 10 years, and the rest
of
 the exhaust is still original (160k). My '91 (100k+) is also still original.
 With life of plain steel that long stainless doesn't mean much.

Up here in the Great Red (as in rust red) North of Minnesota this will mean
alot!  The front pipe and connecting pipe that I replaced last year are
already rusting.
