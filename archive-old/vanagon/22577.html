Joachim,
It's real simple to turn your bench seat around, but you lose your walk
through access to the front.  Here's what you do:
1. Remove the metal trim piece at the bottom of the sliding door (4 philips
head screws).
2. Peel back the carpet toward the driver's side so it's not in the way.
3. Remove the hard foam-like carpet pad / insulation material in the area
between the     seat and the door.
4. Remove the 4 bolts that hold the middle bench to the bench mounting rails.
 These    are 13mm heads I think.
5. Slide the bench out the side door, turn it around, and slide it back in.
6. Un-do what you did in steps 4, 3, 2, &amp; 1.

The only problem with this is that the driver's side of the seat is now on
the passenger's side and doesn't (at least on my '87) have a plastic cover to
cover up the ugly side of the base.
Also, can't make any promises about the safety of such an arrangement, but it
looked seemed O.K. to me.

Good Luck
