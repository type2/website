Subject: Wanted VDO/VW gauages/Where to put gauges in vanagon?

I would like to put gauges in my 1985 westy.(ie., volt, oil psi, oil temp.).
Where is the best place to mount them? In the plastic heater cover below
the radio?(Not a good view of gauges?And would have to cut holes) Or use a
3 gauge console? Problem is the dash is not level so where do you mount the
console? Suggestions?
Does anyone have some VDO/VW gauges with sender they would part with?
Are there any gauges on the market that are as good of quality as VDO that
are not as costly?
Charles
