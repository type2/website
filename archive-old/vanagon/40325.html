Subject: '73 Westy Questions

Well, I am getting closer to the road.  The engine is, as I stated
previously, in and running.  The shift linkage was still giving me trouble
and I discovered a bad wheel bearing (driver's rear), so I handed the whole
thing over to my auto mechanic.  I spent Sunday the removing the remains of
4-6 radio wiring harnesses (kind of like doing a Windows 3.x uninstall by
hand), and bringing the wiring harness into recognizable congruence with the
Bentleys manual. Ended up with a running car and a full set of lights, so I
guess I did OK.  

As I explore the Westy accesories, I am in a continual process of discovery.
Found the switch for the light over the drop table (on the dashboard??????),
but am still mystified about a couple of things.  For all you '73 Westy
owners out there:

How do you fold the front seats?  I have this canvas thingummy with apparent
clips on the windshield pillars and the pillars behind the front seats (&quot;B&quot;
pillars?), but the only way to get it in would involve folding or removing
the front seats.  While I have removed the driver's seat, I was unable to
find a latch to fold it and am dead flat unable even to remove the passenger
seat.  Any hints? 

What was the floor covered with originally?  Given today's posts, I am
pretty sure it wasn't parquet, but I am also pretty sure it wasn't B/C
exterior plywood either.

Was there originally a holding tank under the sink drain? Or was it designed
to make a mud puddle outside the side door?  (how very early-'70's on the
environmental front) Inquiring minds want to know!

Given that the exterior is a brilliant international orange, any guesses on
the original upholstery and/or curtain colour?

Speaking of upholstery, the rear bed in this beast consists of the seat
bottom and back, a rectangular foam pad in the back of most of the engine
shelf, and a long thin clipped rectange that covers the spare tire well.
Does this even vaguely resemble the original configuration?

Was a stove or refrigerator an option in this year?

                               Thanks,
                               Steve Dolan
