Subject: Oil Drain Plug Seal

After a long lapse of judgement, I did an oil change last night.  
(have been having Quicky oil places do it) Got a new oil drain plug 
seal from a local FLAPS.  Didn't remember what the old one looked 
like.  Here's the question.  The old one was the old style copper 
surrounding a fibre material type.  The FLAPS sold me one that was 
white plastic.  What's the scoop.  It didn't leak on my 100 mile run 
to work.  I don't trust me, I checked several times.  What's the 
difference, or the proper, or desired seal material.  BTW the bolt 
was easy to remove, but I was prepared due to previous posts, and did 
remember to get a seal.  Also a scary revelation as the oil filter 
was finger LOOSE, no wonder oil was dripping.
