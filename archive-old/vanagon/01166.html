Hi John,

I'm very enthused to hear mear mortals (aka owners) can intelligently approach 
fuel injection problems and successfully FIX 'em.  My VW dealer doesn't even
want to hear about such problems, much less make a genuine attempt to fix them.
They are good with lip service though!

I'm not personally familiar with the Bosch book you mention, can you give me 
more information about it, including possible sources?

Thanks,

DickE
