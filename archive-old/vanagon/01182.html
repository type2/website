&gt; if you mean the problem when you crank the car, and the idle goes up to
&gt; about 1500 or 2000 and stays there for a 'while', then drops back down ...

That's the one. The situation is aggravated by the A/C being on. I have 
the Vanagon down at the dealer's right now and I had the A/C recharged 
and checked for leaks ($67).

&gt; no, i don't think the wiring harness fix will do anything for that. i think
&gt; we all 'decided' that the high idle is a oxygen sensor or coolant temp sensor
&gt; problem (i.e., the engine is cold and the computer is confused by signals
&gt; coming in from one or more sensors).  comments?

I mentioned this to them and they thought that it was probably unrelated.
I'll call them again right now. &lt;pause&gt; Well, they said they checked the
usual idle problem places, and, since my Vanagon is a '90, they put it on
the computer and it checked out. They are going to recheck the idle valve
and try another cold start tomorrow morning.
