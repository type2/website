Subject: '72+ bus heater blower


Howdy Volks,

	I recently got a heater air blower fan from a '72 bus (or
possibly slightly newer-- part V4 in the Bentley wiring diagram).
I've got the nutty notion of using it for a recirculating heater fan
in my '71 squareback, and I'd like to hook it up basically in place
of the rear window defroster (the window leads are all hacked up &amp;
it doesn't really work).  The bus heater blower says &quot;7A&quot; on the relay,
so I presume that it draws up to 7Amps.  The fuse in the squareback's
defroster circuit is rated at 8Amps.

	Does anyone know the rating of the fuse in the bus heater blower
circuit?  Sir Bentley isn't telling.  I'm hoping to use the squareback's
defroster relay &amp; the groovy dash switch that's already in place, and just
connect the motor directly in place (electrically speaking) of the rear
window's defroster leads.  (In other words, I'm not planning on using the
relay which is right there on the fan.)

	Any other suggestions welcome!

-Greg
