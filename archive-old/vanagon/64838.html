Subject:      Re: Second Battery for Westy

You have to use a heavy duty cable if you decharge
the batteries to different levels. The original
VW set-up uses a 30 Amp relay, but this one is a
usual vehicle relay. It is placed behind the glove
box. It is driven by the D+ terminal of the
alternator and switches to ON when the battery
light will be OFF.
