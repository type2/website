Subject:      A/C Question

I was looking over the latest Vanagon digest and read the post from
Dennis Haynes in response to the A/C  drain tubes being clogged.
Several years ago I had the identical problem. While traveling from
Boston to Washington State, the A/C started dumping water on the rear
cushion behind the bench seat. I removed the rubber check valves and
replaced them with a very fine netting.  This prevented further
clogging, however about a year later my A/C system started to cause
problems.  Every year it had to be recharged (sometimes twice a year).
I've had leaks fixed etc.  After each repair/recharge the A/C would work
for a few months then quit. :&lt;(

My latest trip to an A/C shop (forget finding any competent VW dealer)
reveals that I need to replace one of the 10' hoses, the receiver/dryer
and assorted &quot;O&quot; rings at a cost of $665. (FYI double that figure if you
purchase the hose from VW instead of having one made!).

My question is could removing the little check valves be responsible in
any for the A/C acting up or is it just to be expected with a unit that
has about 100 miles of hoses?

BTW I checked into having the system upgraded to R134.  The cost is
about $1,500.  Most of that is in hose replacement.  According to the
A/C shop the compressor would not have to be replaced.

Thanks for your help
