Subject: oil light/buzzer ('87 Vanagon)

My bus had similar symptoms of the oil light, or oil light + buzzer, 
coming on intermittently-with no apparent common denominator for why 
(warm, cold, low or high rpms, etc) although shutting her down &amp; waiting 
'for a while' made it go away.  I have a self-imposed rule of always 
suspecting connectors when trouble shooting b4 I check anything else; in 
particular where multi-pin (Molex type) connectors are concerned, I 
always first check to make sure the metal male or female pins are secure 
in the plastic receptacles they are pushed into: too often I'll find they 
aren't all the way in, and while trying to assemble the two plastic 
pieces together an improperly seated pin will push back and make poor or 
intermittant contact.  Tracing the oil pressure wire back from the sender 
on the block I found the above to be true at the last connector in the 
engine compartment (where it enters the loom going forward).  

I also +always+ use Stabillant 22 on all contacts, pins, points etc. 
carrying low voltage dc - especially ecu connectors (okokok - not on 
distibuter points, but who uses them ennyhow...;)

More to come - I've really been enjoying reading y'all - &amp; have lots more 
completely unsubstantiated/unsupportable opinions per the above.

(one more 'snivelling'(?) lurker is flushed out from beneath its Vanagon 
- hey, I don't snivel, I whine;  incidently, at least out her in CA, 
Humongous Black Widows set up home in wheel wellsquite nicely thank you - 
must be all the asbestos dust).
