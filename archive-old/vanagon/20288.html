Subject: Help on Westy water level lights

Drat! The water tank level indicator lights stopped working today. None 
of the lights light, no matter what the water level.

The fridge &quot;pilot light lit&quot; light and battery voltage lights still work. 

The top sensor at the tank is getting about .6 volts, the two lower ones 
about .4 volts when the switch is on. 0 when switch is off.

Does anyone know how this circuit works or have a wiring diagram for it?


Thanks, listophiles.
