Subject: Re: '71 Camper Air Conditioner 

  There was an air conditioning option on the '71 Camper.  There's	
a guy in town who has one completely intact, but completely ignored	
for the last 10 years.  But he's PROUD of that Air Conditioner!!
He's dreaming if he thinks he can get 5 thou for that thing!!??	:(
