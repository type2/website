Subject: RE: Better than stickers


&gt;real buses have a divided windscreen,

Mine is divided! The front part is the &quot;windshield&quot;, the side parts are
called &quot;windows&quot;, and the rear glass is referred to as the &quot;hatch&quot;.
Anyone who thinks that all of these aren't all windscreens, has never
driven a Bus on a mountain freeway on a gusty day.


&gt; and b: there are are Sticker Cops in almost
&gt;every state, eager to dance on your head if you hippify your van with
&gt;anything other than officially-approved ways of obscuring your vision.

Have you ever been written up for unauthorized windshield stickers? Do
you know anyone who has been? Do you know anyone who knows anyone who...

In my experience, the only time you'll get zinged for this, is if a cop
pulls you over for something else, and you give him so much guff that
you provoke him into throwing the book at you. Then he'll get you for that
cracked taillight lens, scuff on the sidewall that might indicate cord
damage, the bug splat on your front plate... and, your vanagon_at_lenti
sticker.

But, unless you speed a lot (quite a trick in a Bus) and you're also
chronically obtuse WRT figures of authority... Don't worry, be happy.
And display your sticker with pride, any damned place you like. (Within
reason-- see the chronic condition mentioned above).


&gt;My idea is to use flags.  Not itty-bitty stickers but big five-foot high,
&gt;seven-foot long flags!  On an ten-foot flagstaff mounted on the rear bumper
&gt;with a steady-clip to the rain gutter.  Streaming out behind your bus, such 
a
&gt;banner would be unmistakable, especially if it were of distinctive pattern.

Makes a great sail, too-- something that all our 
beloved-but-dV/dt-challenged
loaves would benefit from. Don't leave home without it.

Do VWs with sails have right-of-way over powered vehicles? Works for boats!


&gt;Put John Phillip Souza on your
&gt;Walkman and turn the knob up to 9.
     &lt;snip&gt;
&gt;I suppose I could put a Vanagon sticker on my cast and wave my cane in time
&gt;to the 'Washington Post March', round up a few new Vanagon List recruits 
that
&gt;way.

Uh... shouldn't that be Ben Pon's tech classes, and &quot;Deutschland uber 
Alles&quot;?


Is it Friday yet?
