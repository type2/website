      The guy I'm buying it from did find the VIN number:  20-029 105  
Can anyone tell me anything about my bus by this number?  Could it be a late
'51?     

The production figures I have from the book of progressivw changes lists

20- 027 676     as end of May 1952 
20- 029 572      end of JUne 1952.

Looks like late June 1952.

good luck  finding parts

Clara
