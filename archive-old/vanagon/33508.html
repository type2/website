I threaded the posts on my emblem, I think its 10-24, but I could be
wrong.  FInd a buf with a set of dies and figger out which one to use.
I then screw it on with a rubber backed washer, and all
is well!

I also use allen bolts on just about everything accessible from the 
outside, and on the support for the steering column, which bolts to
the dash.  I also put a piece of metal across that piece to cover the
holes in it, that someone tried to use one time to hot-wire my
bus (almost succeeded!)
