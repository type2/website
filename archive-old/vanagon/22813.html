Subject: Got another tent, need bumper brackets


This weekend I went to an IVWA in Bristol, TN (what a horrible show,
less than a dozen show cars).  My motive for going to the show was
to meet a friend of mine from Asheville.  He had just picked up a
63 Westy parts car and I wanted to buy the interior for my 60 Westy.

Well it turned out the interior was different from mine so I passed
on it.  It was an interesting setup I had never seen before.  It was
a walk-thru but had the metal seat backs cut out and a bench seat
with a mechanism that folded the seat back down level with the seat 
bottom to form the bed with the rear seat cushion.  The rear cabinets
were wood like mine, but with plastic/vinyl trim instead of brass
trim.  There was a fold down &quot;jump-seat&quot; between the two rear
cabinets, and the cabinet on the driver side had an icebox in it.
He even had the table that used the spare tire as a base, but would
not sell it seperate from the rest of the interior.

Anyhow, when he went to pick the bus up the owner said, &quot;ya know,
that thing had a tent with it when I bought it.  I never could
figger out how to put the durn thing together though.  If you want
it too I think it may still be in the barn.&quot;

So now I am the proud owner of a gray/yellow privy tent.  I don't
have bumper brackets for it though so if any of you know of any...
Also, setting this thing up is a bit like a chinese firedrill.  I
guess I could use some instructions on how to set it up.  The two
gable ends were no problem.  Problems were with the ridge poles
and the changing/potty room at the rear corner.  If anyone can
help...

&quot;No one hipped me to that, dude&quot; (Pee Wee's Big Adventure)
