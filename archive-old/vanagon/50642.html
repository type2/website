Subject: Heated rear window on Vanagon
Date: Sat, 19 Oct 1996 19:25:13 +0100

1982 Bus (Transporter/Caravelle in UK, Vanagon is USA):
The PO has left a heated rear window with one wire attached to the heating
elements. This wire disappears into the rear hatch. Would it be
straightforward to find it at the dashboard end and connect it to a switch
and a spare terminal on the fusebox? Or does it need two wires - there is
another connection to the heating elements at the other side, but there is
no hole in the rear hatch for a wire on that side.
