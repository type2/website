Subject: 64 21-Window made it to body shop


Well at lunch today I got the estimate on bodywork/paint for
the 64 21-window.  Total came to $2200.  WOW!  That's with me
supplying rust repair panels and paint.  (Would have been
$3000 if I needed it in 2 weeks, I told him to take his time).

At first it seemed high to me, but after the shock wore off I
got to thinking...  all rust cut out &amp; replaced with new metal,
painting interior, painting exterior (wetsanding between coats).
I guess it's not so bad.

Also ordered all window &amp; door rubber, headliner, sunroof top,
and front mat to the tune of $900+.

I hope I haven't begun a 'restoration from hell'...
