Subject: Re: Tow balls for '71 style bus.

I have a class one tow ball for my '71 bus. It is so small
and easy to add/remove that I just keep it inside the spare tire.

I would not reccomend pulling even the class-I weight with it.
I used it for years to pull a 16 foot aluminum boat (20 lbs
tounge weight and 1000 lbs total)

It scares me because it bolts to the bumper (in the middle)
and to the engine carrier in the rear. The engine carryer
bolts directly to the block. I was once towing a Beetle
with this setup (just about 4 blocks, level) when the beetles
wheel fell off. I thought that the torque would pull my engine
in half. I still worry about it, and only use it occasionally.
