Subject: Bentley mauel and found a 1961 bus in Sweden
Date: 09 Aug 1995 18:09:06 GMT

&gt;A lot of you people mention the Bentley &quot;bible&quot;, but I have never seen
it over here. 

&gt;I got a US book catalog in the mail the other day from Classic Motorbooks.
&gt;They list the bentley &quot;VW Vanagon 1980-1991&quot; for $84.95, quite a price but
(Are there cheaper places?)

   Christer Lindh, Stockholm, Sweden 

	Christer, the Bently bible for a Vanagon 1980-1991 may be a bit closer to
home then you think. VW Custom and Speed in Hyllinge has it listed in their
catalogue for 335.00 SEK.
	Try giving them a ring. I was in their shop earlier this summer and the
fellow running the place was a great help. The telephone numbers listed in
their catalogue are as follow: 042 22 59 41, 22 59 41, 22 59 42; telefax: 042
22 59 44.
	Hope this can be of some help.

	By the way, others might be interested in hearing about my wife and I
finding a pearl of a 1961 standard bus in Sweden last month. 
	We were getting a little desperate in our search for a little move elbow
room, as our daily driver is a 1956 VW deluxe sedan. A great car which once
again brought us through Denmark, Sweden and southern and central Norway
during three weeks of holidays. The challenge to the 34 ponys pushing us over
those hills, made us realize that we and the three kiddies needed just a bit
more room.
	Sweden is one on the last great hunting grounds for veteran bugs and busses,
and with the help of a local club in Oland we were tipped off about a '961
mango green, sea gull grey bus. A basic 221 bus model with a 6 volt
Eberspacher gas heater. The heat works but the bus has been changed over to a
12 volt system so the Eberspacher is not presently wired up. 
	To cut a long story down to size, this bus has some rust just starting along
the rain gutter, but is otherwise spotless, never an accident, no welding, no
respray, 98,000 kilometers with detailed records covering all services
including each oil change for the first 70,000 klms. To top it off, it'9s
never been used in the winter. Honestly, aside from the faded out paint this
bus is so clean! and, the deal included two crates of spare parts, half NOS
the remaining used.
	The only things missing are the passenger seats. It came from the dealer as
a special order as the original owner'9s wife needed wheel-chair access. Under
the rubber mats all the mountings seem to be in place.
	So I'9ll be scouting out the junk yards trying to find some suitable benches.

	Could any one tell me what year range of benches will be acceptable to slip
into our '661?
	The bus had not been used during the last 8 years so I gave it a change of
oil, new gas, and a detailed check over and it started up first time. With
that, I drove very, very carefully 600 kilometers back to Copenhagen,
stopping at first after each 50 clicks, and finally every 100, checking for
leaks over heating and what not. 
	Only problem I could find is a grabbing front right wheel when breaking
hard. Other problems are bound to surface but until now nothing. 
	I would appreciate any advice on changing the oil. I can'9t seem to find the
type recommended by the service manual, which calls for H.D. 30 SAE. What are
other busses out there using?
	Two final notes and I'9ll stop gloating. The bus cost about $2,000 USA, but a
very serious catch lies with the Danish government concerning importing
foreign registered autos. As the bus in currently only 34 1/2 years old, it
would cost be about $4500 USA in tariffs to register it in Denmark. But, if I
wait five month, beyond its 25 year, I pay a tariff of only 40% of its
original price 1961 price. What a break eh. So we'9re not ready to retire the
'956 just yet, as the bus will have to sit in the drive way maturing just a
little longer yet. This ought to give me time to check out the grabbing
breaks and work on a repaint on the upper tone.
