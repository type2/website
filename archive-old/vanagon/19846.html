&gt; Scott said, I think, that VW buses are hard to find where he is?  Not too 
&gt; hard in Minnesota.  There are half a dozen ads every day for oldies (but 
&gt; hopefully goodies), from about 69's on up.  Prices range from $400 (need 
&gt; work) to $28,000 (Eurovan with 9,000 miles on it; camper--isn't that 
&gt; overpriced?  A new one can be had here for $27,500).  
&gt;    Are VW's cheaper here in Minnesota than elsewhere?  Maybe because it's 
&gt; cold in a VW in winter, at least in my old ones?  I've seen ads on the 
&gt; West coast that tempted me to buy VWs here, drive them there and sell them!
&gt; 



What about the cold wheather and VW vans (maybe all VW's) ? Both of my Vans (83 and 91) are Fuel INjected and every-time I go to the cold weather, they die! Although related problems can get quite complicated, the basic problem is that the vans don't start in cold wheather (below 20)!
