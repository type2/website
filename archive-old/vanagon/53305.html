&gt;  huh?  ya think?  maybe this is an industry secret, the great Parts
&gt;  Conspiracy.  sell customers a $3000 fluid coupling when all it needs it a
&gt;  change of $20 worth of silicone brake fluid.  whose willing to try on
their
&gt;  trashed unit?

While admittedly possible, I'd evaluate the chances of this as very, very
slim.  I've never heard of silicon brake fluid having a characteristic of
gelling (or otherwise increasing its viscosity) when subjected to shear
stresses.  I would NOT encourage anyone to experiment with this in their
Syncro.
