I think this might be counter-productive. I have spoken to the people at
Kennedy and the person I spoke to seemed to be aware of the List. If we were
to bombard them with mail  they might just get pissed off.

Though, if one or two people were to let them know how many of us on the List
are interested in the Subaru conversion maybe they could be talked into
giving us a List discount. Its worth a try.
