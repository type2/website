Subject: Re: LONG BLOCK vs SHORT BLOCK??

&gt;I have a 91 VW vanagon and would like to know the difference when some
&gt;body (vw) says they are either going to replace the long Block or the short 
&gt;block....I was told a long block is just a complete engine with alternators...sheet metal and other parts strapped on, while the short block is 
&gt;the core, pistons, and heads and valves...thanks in advance
&gt;john.

A short block is built up thru the case, but no pistons, cylinders, heads 
and all. 

A longblock is the same but with pistons, cylinders and head.

Neither will have an alterator, carb/injection or any of that stuff.
