Subject: vw+women=heaven?

Well, I must be very lucky then. It was my girlfriend who said: Hey- let's
buy a vw-bus! I happily agreed, this always kind of being what I wanted.
Though we didn't get a splittie, too small for our needs (my girlfriend is a
painter, she paints BIG). So our choice fell on the 80 Vanagon. It was
aircooled and within our price range. Of course, now that we had to dump the
old motor for a newer one, this taking all our savings, and thus forcing us
to live cheaply for a while (while in Italy) she is not all that happy.
Especially not if the motor we now got is gonna break down too soon. Then
she is gonna get really pissed off (threatened to leave it there by the
roadside). Can't say I blame her, at the moment I feel quite the same way.
(Now, how do I break it to her it would be nice to have one of those really
old ones too? &lt;grin&gt;)

Take car(e) and merry Christmas from Italy
