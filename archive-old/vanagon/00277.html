Subject: swamp cooler wanted..


I am trying to locate a so called car swamp cooler.  I believe that these
were manufacture by Firestone in perhaps the 40s, maybe 50s as well.  Other
companies may have made them, too.  They are basically a metal cylinder
which rests in or on a frame bolted to the outside of the car, near
a window.  One pours water (and/or ice) into the reservoire, leaving
the window open enought for a hose or pipe exiting the cooler to enter
the car.  There is no drag on the engine, and the fan in these units
is, I believe wind driven.

If you have one for sale, or can refer me, I'd be appreciative.

Thanks,
