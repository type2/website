Subject: value 1973 Westie

I know this is the Vanagon group, but I'm not subscribed to the type II
list...

My son has a 1973 Westie that is in overall good condition as regards
interior and body.  Straight body, no rust (Arizona car), cabinets and
seats excellent, auto trans good, etc.  However, it needs a rebuilt engine.
 Compression zero in cylinders 3 and 4, and 30 and 50 in 1 and 2.

He needs to sell it, and I'm thinking of buying it.  What would a fair
price be?

Thanks,
