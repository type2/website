Subject: Re: Importing brand-new VWs to US


There was/is a company in Toronto area that was buying Beetle body pans from 
USA then rebuilding completely with Mex/Brasil parts to meet Cdn standards. 
Could probably import those, but not really worth it. They were something 
like $14,000 CDN and up 5 years ago. Another company was doing similiar with 
the Citroen 'Deux Cheveaux' tin cans.    tim s.
