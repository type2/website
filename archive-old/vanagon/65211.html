Subject:      Sweet '86 Westy for sale, CT

Okay, I feel a lot indebted to Scott &amp; Heather Doane of Bridgeport, CT.

They held onto the following Westy for me in the hopes I could get my
finances together for a purchase. With the BIG cost of Suzy's and my BIG
six-week journey coming up, I can't make the buy today. I'm sure somone
amoung us might be able to, or can forward to interested party. I have not
SEEN this van, all descriptions are from Scott, who says, despite all I write
below, that it needs a little loving. All disclaimers apply, yadda, yadda
yadda. Heres what I know:

1986 Westy: sink, stove, propane tank, water tank, and fridge NEVER USED!!! Yo
u read that right, none of the camp stuff has been used. Second owner. Very
good shape. Metalic brown with biege top. 89k total miles, 10k on all new top
end, including heads, pistons and rings. A/C works, auto, clean throughout.
Brand new fuel pump (I sent it up there!). Needs a set of tires, and a P/S
rack. Drives great. Good luck finding one like this with the plastic still on
the camp stuff! $6,500. That's right. $6,500. Give him a call. 203-367-0711

I guess I am still in the Westy wanna be club, for now. : (

Anyone have a WHITE '90 or '91 they wanna sell in December or January?
Oh, well. Good luck,
