Okay,

I'd been thinking about a set of wheels for a long time 
and one day...  Well, the upshot is that the beast cost
me $750 (dual carb '74 Kombi)  The interior had been lined
--get this--with *cedar* of all things.  Sort of like 
driving around in a big steamer trunk.  :)  We spent about
1500$ for a new windshield, rust work, muffler, blah, blah...
The poor thing hasn't seen the highway for almost 2yrs now.
Sniff.  And it looks like it will be resting for yet another
year.  Sigh.  I *miss* that oxidised big red bastard.  --Ralf
