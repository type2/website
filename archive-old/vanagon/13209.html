Subject: Re: WWW

Thanks, Thomas, for the hot tip. This WWW site seems like it's geared only for 
the German market, but is pretty interesting neverless. Too bad there's no 
van-stuff. Interesting, though, was the picture and discussion of the Golf 
station wagon (or as they call it, the &quot;Golf Variant Young Family&quot;). There also 
appears to be a lot more colors and options over there.

-Erik.
