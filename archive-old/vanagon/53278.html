Subject: Type I alternator

No Type 2 content!

Daughter backed the bug ('68 1500) into a flatbed.  Didn't even scratch the
paint on the truck's buumper.  Killed the deck lid and managed to trash the
Motorola conversion alternator on the bug.  Does anyone have a spare laying
around?  Blew up the wasserboxer on Saturday, nailed deer with the loaf on
Tuesday, fixing the bug is the easiest (cheapest) thing to do at this
point.  Can't afford to drive 3/4 ton full-time 4X4 GMC far. (and at -10 to
20 deg F temps, riding the Interceptor is out of the question!)

I REALLY NEED an alternator (and pulley.)

Jim
