Subject: Re: Sportsvans (sic)

&gt; There are several engine options described: 90bhp direct injection diesel,
&gt;115bhp 2.0 litre (don't know if this is Ford's orW's engine) and, of course,
&gt;the VR6! I assume this is the 174bhp VR6 from the Golf raher thanhe 190bhp
&gt;Corrado engine. Looks like VW are competing with the Espace after all.

This is yet another van from VW, separate from the &quot;Eurovan&quot; (U.S. name)?

Local VW salesman says that the Eurovan is *not* selling. (I went in to say
&quot;hi&quot; to him - he sold us our Vanagon, and he twisted my arm into test
driving a Eurovan (sporty model, rear-facing-removable-mid-seats, special
paint).  It was interesting... strange to hear the motor up front (and it's
not particularly quiet).  The salesman said that he'd skip the VR6 and go
with the work-horse (Audi) 5-cylinder, if it were up to him.

Can we have the Vanagon back? (VW start manufacture again...) Are Vanagon's
still being made?  Will the dies be shipped to Mexico and Brazil to bring
them into the '80s?
