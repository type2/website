Subject: Vanagon parts price check in Ottawa

After having the altenator/water pump belt break and overheat the motor
ans blow the right side head gasket and finding out that my left front
upper ball joint is loose ( all in one week ! )  I have bit the bullit and
decided to pull the engine and do a good overhaul on the van.  So I start
checking for parts and heres what I found yesterday.

Ball joint:   Local VW dealer: $140.00
              Cajun Tire:      $ 50.99
              R.M.R.:          $ 35.00

Well it makes you wonder !

Head Gaskets: Local VW dealer: didn't even bother to ask as his price
                        would surely be more than I could understand !
              Cajun Tire:       no gots
	      Auto Import:     $132.00/side
	      R.M.R.:          $ 89.00/side or $189. for complete engine set.

R.M.R. also supplied complete ring set (Brazilian) for $49.00 and a tail
pipe for $29.00.

All I can say is do your shopping at R.M.R. in Ville ST. Laurent, Qc. 
I've used there stuff before and have yet to have a problem.  Very
courteous, knowlegeable and quick on the shipping.  Their phone # is:
514-339-5722

Happy motoring &amp; off to the garage
