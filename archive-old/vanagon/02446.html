Subject:      ok. here it is: another sing-song.

this is to the tune of Knick-Knack-Patty-Wack-Give-a-Dog-a-Bone (This Old
Man, to some of you).


This old van
  don't go Slow
    if you're driving and you know
How to shift the gears like your peers
  keep the engine revvin'
    and you'll be in vee-dub heaven.

This old van,
  it goes Ten
    while in first gear once again
With a clink-clank in the crank
  rattles like a stone
    this old bus goes rolling on.

This old van,
  it goes Twenty,
    and it carries cargo plenty
With a bump-thump in the rump
  when it hits a stone
    this old bus goes rolling home.

This old van,
  it goes Thirty
    even though it's mighty dirty.
With a splish-splash, make a dash,
  scrub it til it's clean
    this old bus is really mean.

This old van,
  it goes Forty,
    into Fourth and oh-my-Lordy!
With a crash-bang-shift-them-gears
  don't forget to clutch!
    this old bus is way too much.

This old van,
  it goes Fifty,
    and it does it pretty nifty.
With a huff-puff, strut your stuff,
  show 'em what's your breed,
    this old bus is gaining speed.

This old van,
  it goes Sixty,
    like some hound-dog down in Dixie.     :)
With a bow-wow, watch me now,
  Alabama bound,
    this old bus covers lots of ground.

This old van,
  it goes Seventy,
    and it handles really heavenly
With a sharp-left, sharp-right,
  fly around the curve,
    driving buses takes some nerve.

This old van,
  it goes Eighty,
    even though it's kinda weighty.
With a boom-zoom Gimme Room!
  flying down the road
    this old bus is not a toad!

This old van,
  don't go Ninety
    with that engine in its hinnie
Cause it's just a Brick, with a stick,
  pushing through the air,
    but it always gets you there.

This old van
  don't go Fast
    if you want to make it last
So just slow down near the ground
  keep it 'tween the ditches
    don't drive like those sons-a-bitches. :)
