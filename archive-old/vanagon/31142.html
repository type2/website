&gt; Yes, I think you should.  Do you have dual carbs?  Are your valves

&gt; 

No, I don't have dual carbs. My valves are adjusted properly, but I've 
seen them go out of adjustment by .002 to .003 in just a few miles, 
though neither side seems more prone to this than the other. Rocker arms?

I had the heads re-worked about 50 miles ago (that was a couple months 
back). I didn't do the work myself, 'cause I didn't figure I had the 
skill. I have noticed some slight backfire on acceleration and 
decceleration; I'm told this could be related to heads.

Thanks! Joe
