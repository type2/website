Subject: looking for newer Westfalia

Hi folks,

I'm a new subscriber, and relatively new to the Web.  Still trying to 
figure it all out.  I'm amazed at the volume and level of expertise on 
this list.  Living as I do in New England, I see a Vanagon about once a 
week, and a Westfalia even less often.

Here's my need: I have a 1987 Westfalia, which I bought off a lot in '89 
and have use A LOT (but not abused), to the point where it now has 104K.  
Troubles have been occurring the last couple of years.  I'm looking for 
one that's newer and/or with fewer miles, i.e. more reliable on long 
trips.  Any leads appreciated.  Will travel within reason - and beyond 
reason during vacation - to see a likely candidate.  If you don't want to 
clutter the public list, you may send me mail at 
schultz_at_oitunix.oit.umass_dot_edu.

I could keep running this '87 and fixing it as the need arises.  That's 
OK for local or regional trips, but we tend to like to go to places like 
Montana, Utah, Newfoundland, Florida ... and far from big cities or even 
towns.  I'm not a mechanic, and I have a job, so I need a vehicle, not a 
hobby.

This is our second Westfalia.  We got a 1983 (bacterial green, as 
described on another list) in 1987, and only sold it because we happened 
to see the '87 on a lot near our house.  We love the concept and the 
execution of the Westfalia and hate the thought of switching to something 
bigger and less maneuverable.  We've met many lovely and interesting 
folks with Westfalias in campgrounds, parking lots, etc., some of whom 
we've stayed in touch with over the years and even visit ... and now - 
Web sites and lists.
