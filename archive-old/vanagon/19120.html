Subject: Re: fix the plug!!!

&gt;
&gt;Hmmm....  I've got a real tight (and, methinks, seized) plug on #2 in my 
&gt;'76.  This is a plug I did the Big Trip on, so it's got about 16,000 
&gt;miles on it now.  I'm only going to be driving the bus until Sept (when 
&gt;it goes into storage), and I use it only for camping/fun trips, so I'll 
&gt;only put another 1,500 or so on it before winter.  
&gt;
&gt;I wasn't really too concerned about it (I'll get to it this winter), then 
&gt;Michael &quot;No-one-waves-to-me&quot; Wagner seems pretty concerned about this 
&gt;problem--in other people's buses, anyway.  :)  
&gt;
&gt;Should I take care of it sooner?  Seems like a lot of work for something 
&gt;I'd take care of in another 1,500 anyway...  Opinions?

If it ain't broke, don't fix it!  That cylinder could easily be worse off
after you 'fix' it.  Inserts often leak and the metal shards you'll
inevitably get in the engine will not be helpful.  Although at least # 2 is
easier to get to, on my engine.
