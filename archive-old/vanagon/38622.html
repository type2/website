&gt;&gt; The color scheme you describe (beige outside with green/brown plaid

&gt;&gt; either chrome yellow (school bus colored) or tiaga green (green-M&amp;M
&gt;&gt; colored).  The color of the paint inside the engine compartment or
&gt;&gt; in the interior will probably clue you in.
&gt;I must disagree with this. I have seen at least 2 '78 Westfalias that had light
&gt;beige paint, and an interior plaid of fine green and brown '70's glory.
&gt;Just another useless fact, I know...

And my swirly paint job is definitely a factory job.
