&lt;&lt; Hidden under the light coating of pine needles was an entire circular 
 driveway covered in used carpet!  They managed to get loads of light 
 beige carpet and just layed it out and drove on it, parked on it, 
 etc.  The stuff will last for years, cost is right, you can toss it when 
 you hit the lottery and build a garage!
 
 What a great idea!  Carpet installers throw out the old stuff, would 
 usually LOVE to have someone take it off their hands.  Call around to 
 installers and ask them to call when they have a removal of a color 
 to your liking! or just do the old dumpster dive and get what's 
 available.  (it is preferable to ask permission first however)
  &gt;&gt;

Another item to look for in dumpsters, are old sofas and chairs, these will
be perfect along with the house carpet laid out on your lawn. 
That way when you want to take a break from working on your van, you can just
sprawl out w/ a brewskie on that old pea green naugahyde lazy-boy recliner
you found behind the local WalMart in a dumpster( make sure it's naugahyde,
it'll keep the mold an mice away longer, wipe it down w/ a coat of 20-50motor
oil, and the rain will roll right off it!! 
Neighbours giving you dirty looks?
He'll the're just jealous they don't have their living room/ garage in their
front yard! :&lt;)

sorry jeff, i just had to..  :&lt;)
