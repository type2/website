Subject: 6V to 12V gauge again!

     Hi all,
     
     back to an old theme I'm afraid.
     
     When I asked about the 6v Fuel gauge a few weeks ago - everyone
     told me that you didn't need to convert the gauge. Now I've got
     my '64 bus the gauge reads very low - I put six gallons of gas
     in the tank and it came upto the first 1/4 mark - I did about 30
     miles in it and it read half way between R and the first 1/4 mark.
     
     Does 6 gallons fill the reserve area and up to the first mark ?
     (In the UK that equates to about 15 quid's worth of petrol - I 
      think it should read about 3/4 of a tank)
     
     I built a 12 to 6v dc-dc converter capable of sourcing 1.7amps, so
     I am gonna power the fuel circuit off it and see if I get a better
     reading - of course it could be that the gauge or sender is knackered,
     the bus's last MOT was 1985 so I figure the sender it hasn't seen
     much full-scale movement for a while.
     
     Can anyone draw me an ASCII for the fuel gauge circuit - please.
     
     Lee.
