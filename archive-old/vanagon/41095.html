Subject: Re: news group


I'm fairly new to computers, and maybe I'm wrong, but I can load my 
e-mail and then get off line when I read it, while on a newsgroup I 
believe I have to be online the whole time I read the messages.  
Therefore, from the standpoint of cost of online time, I prefer the 
list in its present format. 
Besides, who said we had any choice in this matter?
