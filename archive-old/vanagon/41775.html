Subject: '62 Bus Update

Hi,

  Just thought i would give you an update on my '62 bus. Well i think all is
now well on the starting side of things (i put a new starter in). And for the
last couple of weeks i have been working on the interior. I had all the 
original door panels, which i got recovered in the original way with a pattern
in the middle. Put these in, and what a difference they make! Also made
a couple of overhead storage compartments for above both windscreens. I had to 
relocate the sun visers, but these are very smart, even if i say so myself:)
If anyone wants any plans for these, i made them out of 6mm ply, i will
gladly supply them.
 Got the foam cut for the rear seats (not cheap), i think i am going to 
cover one side in cotton material and the other side in vinly (sp?) to match
the front seat. Only varnishing left to do now!

Cheers,

Ben Ryan
