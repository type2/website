Subject: 84 Vanagon GL Price List

     
Well, just got the estimate back from a Vanagon shop.

Total for replacing the head gaskets is is about $886.00. 
This includes 14 hrs of labor(14 hours because they will have 
to use heat to get the exhaust system, etc off).

$690 for labor
$168 for the gasket kit.
$ 13.75 for the Compound Sealer
$ 14.00 New Spark Plugs
-----
$885.75

This shop also mentioned that they can have new valve stems 
put in for about $45 more. (they would have to send that out to a machine
shop though...)

As I'm sure everyone here knows, finding a good shop that will even touch a
Vanagon is pretty hard to find. In Chicago, (besides the dealer) I don't know
of too many. From the responses I've recieved here (Thanks to all by the way!)
this seems a little above a good price (not that there ever IS a good price)
but within reason. Any final comments before surgery???


P.S. I fixed the coolant temp guage yesterday. Just had to do something myself!
(Thanks to Chicago Public Library for the use of their tech-manuals)
