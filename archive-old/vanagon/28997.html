Subject: Re: Interstate Batteries Researched &amp; Purchased

&gt;Finally, if I just put the batter
&gt;in and the terminals touch the metal top of the compartment will I have a
&gt;problem?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks for the advice

you are going to have a big problem.  look at the battery you have in there
now, under the passengers seat, it (hopefully) has a cover over the positive
terminal, if that was not there then soon after you closed the metal cover,
you would have lots of smoke and probably a carpet fire, mabye an explosion?
Woah, the current passing through that metal cover would be immense.
