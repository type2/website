Subject: Re: Getting Drums back on '71?

Joseph,
There really isn't any rocket science involved here.  Make sure that the 
adjuster is really shortened and not lengthened and slap the brake shoes 
to make sure that they make contact with the adjuster rod.  The drum 
should slip right on.

Write me direct if this doesn't work.  I've never had a problem like this 
so I'm curious what the problem could be.

Jack
