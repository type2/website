Subject: bodega update...

distracted lately and haven't written a post to confirm.  Anyway, thanks to 
those of you who have already made your reservations thru MISTIX, and to those

total:  14 vehicles - wow!

For the potluck, I had originally proposed a seafood thing for Fri. nite, and 
Mex stuff for Sat.  However, a few list members with even sicker of a sense of 
humor than mine proposed that we make the first nite BBQ poultry (Hitchcock's 
The Birds, etc.), meaning BYOB, meaning bring-your-own-bird.  No quesitons 
asked if yours looks like a seagull  :)  Anyway, more to come on this, but 
another good idea was to do something Russian for Sat. nite, since the Russian 
settlement of Fort Ross is not that far away.  I can just envision the vodka 
slugs now.  As if this group doesn't already drink enuff!  Anway, I'll proceed 
with that notion (Friday poultry, Sat. Russian), and you're welcome to sign up 
accordingly.  

Stay tuned...
