I've been spending some time creating my first &quot;homepage&quot;.  Part of 
that page is a BMW Resource Page.  My objectives, etc are described 
on the page itself.  I'd appreciate anyone's comments or criticism 
directed towards making it an even better resource.  I plan to begin 
work on a VW Vanagon oriented page but I want to decide what is 
needed out there on the net that I can provide including the Budget 
Stereo FAQ.  There is a section of auto related links that this forum 
might find of interest or might have something to contribute to.

Also, see my message there regarding &quot;Great Drives.&quot;

Thanks,
