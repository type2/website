Subject: Hoover's Comments re: Smoke Bombs, etc.

     I really like Bob's idea of dumping some oil into the carb to produce 
     a large cloud of smoke.  It sounds especially good to me, given a 
     recent experience.
     
     For reasons unknown, the primary jet of the Weber Progressive on my 
     new 1776 engine backed out of its threaded hole in the bottom of the 
     primary chamber, allowing much raw gas to pour into the carb and 
     thence into the engine.  This happened while I was returning to work 
     from lunch.  The vast quantities of fuel produced a good deal of 
     smoke, attracting the attention of a Lakewood, CO policeman who pulled 
     me over for violation of the &quot;visual emissions&quot; section of the CO 
     polllution laws.  I left work about 3:00 hoping to get the darn thing 
     home to work on it before rush hour.  Got pulled over by a Colorado 
     State Patrolman - same reason.  Got it home, checked everything I 
     could think of and isolated the problem to the carb.  Didn't have a 
     Weber manual, so called local guru/mechanic who uses progressives on 
     his bugs and buses.  He said, &quot;bring it it at 8:00 tomorrow morning.&quot;  
     On the way to his place next morning, I got stopped AGAIM! - this time 
     by a Jefferson County Deputy Sheriff.
     
     I've never had so much attention from the cops.  The checked my 
     license, my insurance certificated, my registration, and my emissions 
     tag thru the state computer each time. 
     
     It would not be too difficult to install a tee at the oil pressure 
     switch and run maybe a 1/8&quot; tube up to the carb thru a small solenoid 
     valve.  A little clever work could make this look like part of the 
     normal installation to all but VW initiates.  A hidden button switch 
     and a 12V relay wired to &quot;lock-in&quot;/close the solenoid valve on 
     momentary closure of the switch and to drop out/open the solenoid 
     whenever the ignition is turned off would complete the installation.  
     
     You could also accomplish the same thing by installing a tee in the 
     fuel line downstream from the pump and running an extra fuel line up 
     to the carb thru a solenoid valve.  You could dump the fuel in either 
     at the top of the primary barrel or possibly thru an unused vacuum 
     connection.   
     
     This works on several levels:
     
     1)  When the crooks hot wire the car and start it without pressing the 
     button switch, smoke starts pouring from the exhaust.  Hopefully this 
     will discourage them from taking the car in the first place - limiting 
     damage to maybe a broken window.
     
     2)  If they drive the car off anyway, perhaps they'll have the same 
     kind of luck I did and the cops will pull them over for a pollution 
     violation.  With enough oil or extra gas pouring into the carb, 
     there's no way they'll have enough power to run for it.  
     
     3)  If the malefactors keep driving it long enough, they'll run out of 
     oil in the crankcase and the engine will seize up or they'll run out 
     of fuel.  Although a drastic step, it stops them dead in their tracks 
     -  albeit possibly at the cost of replacing/rebuilding the engine or 
     repairing other damage caused by excess fuel.
