Subject: VW Euro  meeting
Date: Mon, 18 Sep 1995 14:55:24 +0200 (MET DST)

Last weekend the VW Euro meeting took place in Baarlo in the
Netherlands. Though the event was from friday through sunday,
I could only be there on sunday. But did I have a good time !
The event was held on an oval speedway, with cars covering
nearly two third of the area. The rest was used by the swap-meet
area and the sprint-track.
Apart from lots of Bugs (the oldest one being from 1951, and the newest
one having just 281 miles on the odometer), there were about 10 Bonito
kit-cars, 2 Nova's, 2 SP-2, a 356 replica, about 30 or so busses.
There were 2 double cab splitties, a long chassis singlecab, a wide bed
single cab, and a unique bodied panelvan (a split-window) made specially
for themepark `De Efteling'. The special thing about this van was that the
cargo door was on the left, and it looked more like a vault-door than a normal
door. On the right of the body, there was something with a filler cap
recessed into the body (no, not the fueltank cap). On the back, on both
sides of the hatch, two hooks were attached, probably for (flag)poles.
Also present was a Fridolin van. Not between the show cars, but used by
a company. (I have made a picture of it. If anyone is interested I'll
scan it)

On the sprint track, all sorts of events were held: sprint, slalom, etc.
On of the events was pulling and putting back the engine. Fastest times:
1 minute 16 seconds getting it out (though I will never let my engine
drop that hard on the floor !), and 3 minutes 12 seconds putting it back
in and driving away.

A lottery was also held, with a convertible bug as the 1st price.
Needless to say, I didn't win it.

On the swapmeet there were enough bug parts to build a couple of
complete cars with them.
I took home a brand new underlined Volkswagen logo for the back of my
bus for almost half the price used ones were going for.


The day before, there should have been a record attempt for the longest
air-cooled traffic-jam. I forgot to ask if they have made it, but
estimates before the show said there would be something like 3000 VWs.
I'll post the result to the list, once I know if the have made it.
