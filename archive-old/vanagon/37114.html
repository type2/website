I write variuos articles for Gass and Limbo.  The attached is a piece of
Emissions Part two that will be published in upcoming issues.  It is obvious
from the postings on the list that very few people have any understanding of
what this system does.  I hope that this file helps to clear the &quot;Air&quot; so to
speak.  What is key here is that EGR system fills some of the cylinder space
with an &quot;INERT&quot; gas.  In other words, the spent exhaust does not burn,(fuel)
or support combustion,(no oxygen).  This lowers the &quot;PEAK FLAME TEMPARATURE&quot;.
 This is critical in an air cooled engine running lean mixtures.  Raising the
peak flame temparature is what helps burn pistons and melt heads in late
model air cooled VW's

Hope this helps.

PS.  I did not post the complete article because  I write these articles to
attract VW fanatics to join these clubs.
Thanks and Keep on Bussin'
