&gt;Hello All:
&gt;
&gt;As a desperate measure to preserve my sanity (and to keep some portion of
&gt;the day for doing my actual job), I dropped off the list about 6 months
&gt;ago. But news of the water/air split was enough to get me to resubscribe
&gt;and see if I can bear the traffic, so here I am.
&gt;
&gt;
When workin on a van that had a similar problem(bled it, put in new
thermostat) but still 
ran hot. The problem in this cas was that there was a crack inside the
radiator that basically
let the water out of the radiator as fast as it came in. The water never got
to the side of the
radiator with the temp sensor. One way to check this is to remove the grill
and feel the 
radiator on both the passenger and driver side. If it doesn't feel as hot on
the drivers side 
as it is on the passenger side either it may be cracked or clogged.

Good Luck.
