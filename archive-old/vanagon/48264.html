Hey!

Count me in for a trip at least through the Granite Planet: my parents
still live in ole Norris Point, Nfld. (smack dab in the middle of Gros
Mourne National Park). I know the Northern Peninsula pretty well, so I
wouldn't mind helping to plan that part of the trip. I was planning on
driving home from this Upper Canadian hellhole next summer anyways!!
:)

There are some really amazing hiking opportunities in Gros Mourne,
including a 5/6 day hike that goes way out into the middle of no man's
land. Lots of caribou, tuckamore, and fijords...

And youse is all welcome fer a cup a tah at me mudders 'ouse...
