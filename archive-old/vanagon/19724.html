&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Hello,
&gt;
&gt;My name is Joerg and I have owned a 1982 VW
&gt;Camper Diesel (99k) for 6 years. Even though this is probably one of the
&gt;slowest vehicles on the road, I love it (I used to drive them for the
&gt;German postal service as a student).
&gt;
&gt;I have three questions
&gt;
&gt;1. I recently moved to Dallas and the Van doesn't have air-conditioning.
&gt;As far as I know, it is not possible to hook this engine up to an
&gt;air-conditioner. Does anybody have any information about this? Is there
&gt;any other way to do anything about this problem? What do our air-cooled
&gt;friends do in this country?
&gt;
&gt;2. In Germany, there is a turbo-diesel version. Does anybody know of any
&gt;place in the U.S. that works on these things? Is it possible to get an
&gt;engine and/or the additional parts and where?
&gt;
&gt;3. I'd like to here from other Vanagon-diesel owners, if possible. I
&gt;realize there are not that many out there.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks so much,
&gt;
&gt;Joerg


Good to hear from you!  I have a '82 diesel Vanagon, not a camper version,
but I have a sun-roof.  I have owned it  about 2 years and wouldn't trade it
for anything (except a diesel camper).

I have a label on my timing belt cover which states I can't add an air
conditioner to the engine.

I wish I had the turbo-diesel version; what is the engines displacement?
