Subject: Re[2]: JT's Magic Bus Update Part Deux!


&gt;I prefer &quot;exacting&quot;. I'm that way about my bus sometimes.
&gt;
&gt;I don't know any details about bus seating options, except for the obvious
&gt;points such as, 8-seat non-walk-thrus have a short 2-person middle seat
&gt;(like mine), while 9-seaters have a full-length middle seat.
&gt;
&gt;I do wonder (speculation here) if the floor mounts are identical for
&gt;either configuration. Maybe the nine-seaters just have more sticking
&gt;out toward the sliding door, and maybe an extra seat-frame support
&gt;that extends down to the floor but isn't bolted down like the rest of
&gt;the supports are? Anybody out there have one of these full-length middle
&gt;seats, and can check and let us know?

    After my 2 position middle seat was stolen, I replaced it with a 3
    position seat.  It uses all the same mounting positions as the 2
    position seat and has another support that is bolted down the same way
    as the others.  My bus had the holes for the mounting thingies under the
    rubber mat.

    BTW, this is a '75 and I guess it's a 8 passenger walk-through...
