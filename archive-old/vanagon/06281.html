&gt;I've always wanted to know--
&gt;Is it Pee-cans or puh-Kahns, (ALL-mond or aah-mond, toe-MA-toe or
&gt;to-MAH-toe, Volks-wagen, or Volts-wagen?)

kinda depends on which mumble-mouthed redneck you listen to. :)  i had a
english/speech teacher in high school that pronounced 'judge' as 'jerge'.
and she was teaching us to to speak correct english. go figure.

but seriously, folks ... i've always heard that the correct pronounciations
are pe-KAHN (not PEE-can, or even pe-CAN). and ALL-mund. and toe-MAY-toe.
and FOLKS-Vag-gen. (the 'W' is pronounced as a 'V', and the 'V' is said as
an 'F' sound. funny thing about German and English ... they have a lot in
common ... all them Vikings beating up on both of them, i guess. :)
