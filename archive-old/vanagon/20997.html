Subject:  cracked exhaust manifold

time for my daily plea for help:
i have a cracked left exhaust manifold (california emissions setup), pretty
close to where the pipe is bolted (cylinder end).  i took it to a shop where
they tried to weld it, but they said it is a stainless alloy and can't be
welded (they tried).  they want $250 for a new one, which doesn't seem
reasonable, but i do not really know.  i  put a call in to the parts place inc. 
(i'm in michigan), and they're going to get back with me.  in the meantime,
any experience with/knowledge of this?  if i get the part myself
(hopefully cheaper), any advice on putting it on? (i ordered the haynes
manual yesterday, but it won't be here until next week).
