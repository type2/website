Subject: Intro

With the rash of introductions, let me add one more.  I'm Fred Dyen from 
the frozen North, Fairbanks, Alaska.  I teach aircraft mechanics at the 
University of Alaska Fairbanks and own a 1984 Wolfsbug Vanagon with a 
Country Homes Camper top.  The vehicle seats seven and sleeps six (with 
the hammock) and is set up to carry 6 bikes (one is a tandem) - the only 
way to accomodate five kids and a dog.  Additionally, I've added a gas 
heater to help out with the -60 degree F. winters and a 300 watt oil pan 
heater to get the van going in the dead of winter.

I've succumbed to the lure of the list and arranged to purchase the 
Viking Edition, that Jon Christensen noted a few days ago.  It needs an 
engine and I have a long block that I removed several years ago from my 
van.  It should be ok after I rebuild the heads and install a set of 
rings. One option that I have is to send down the long block and have Jon 
install it.  I'd rather get the vehicle up to Fairbanks, though.  If any 
one has any helpful suggestions, I'm wide open.  With five kids I need to 
hold down the costs, but I'm interested in bartering.  I have a 2.0 liter 
air cooled long block that was removed for a rebuilt long block.  Also, 
I'm a flight instructor and have access to a float plane if there are any 
avid fishermen or hunters.  Let me know.

Regarding the great trip North.  The Dalton Highway to Prudhoe Bay was 
opened this summer.  Required reading for the trip should be &quot;Hot Springs 
and Hot Pools of the Northwest&quot;.  This book lists over 200 hot springs in 
Montana, Idaho, Washington, British Columbia, Alberta, Northwest 
Territories, and Alaska.  Just outside of Fairbanks there are 5 hot 
springs, and 3 of them are accessible by road.  I've made the trip more 
times than I care to count and would be glad to give advice and lend any 
assistance.

Some questions I have always wanted answered. 
	1.   Can a three place middle seat be modified to accomodate the 
weekender rear seat conversion to a bed?  I could sure use an extra seat 
in the van, but don't want to give up the utility of the bed. 
	2.  Has anyone found a permenant cure for the head gasket blues?
	3.  Has anyone turbocharged the Waterboxer?  Talked to one fellow 
down in Washington State that races sand rails with the waterboxer who 
turbocharges them - pulls about 150 Hp.  But has anyone done it to a van?
would anyone else be interested in more power?  By the way, when I 
rebuilt my 1.9 liter, I had the crank stroked and used 2.1 liter pistons 
and liners and an RV cam.  Figure I'm getting close to 100 Hp. but still 
anemic.  Maybe I should lose the bikes.

Enough for now.  Fred
