Subject: Re: '84 Vanagon, Help!


&gt;&gt;      My '84 Vanagon camper has this problem where every 30,000
&gt;&gt;miles or so the head gaskets begin to leak, causing gas buildup in
&gt;&gt;the water  cooling system.  This first appears as a rising coolant
&gt;&gt;level in the overflow tank next to the oil dipstick. Next the
&gt;&gt;dashboard heater quits because it fills with gas.  Finally (about
&gt;&gt;2K miles later) the leaking gas literally blows coolant out of most
&gt;&gt;of the cooling system and the temperature sensor begins to signal
&gt;&gt;imminent meltdown!
&gt;
&gt;In my '85, I had an experience last week of coolant overflowing the 
&gt;overflow tank. Level rose. meltdown was signalled by temp. sensor. They 
&gt;drained and replaced the coolant and could find no other &quot;cause&quot;. It now 
&gt;runs fine and temp is back to normal.
&gt;
&gt;Strange.

When mine started having the same problem after its headgasket replacement
at a cost of $900 in 1987, both my VW shop and local VW dealer believed the
headgasket would have had another meltdown and cracked gasket AGAIN. I refused to
believe it and pay another $900 every 30~40K miles. Since 1990, I have been flushing
the whole cooling system every fall. From then on, my water-boxer with &quot;supposedly
cracked headgasket&quot; has added another 70k miles. Well, when it crowls up the Russian
Hill in San Francisco, its temperature does go up a notch or even overshot the
temperature warning light. But, by moving the temperature leveler right-and-
left, the temperature comes down easily. 

It is a fact that these early VW's ('83-'87) water cooling system, due to its high
elevation radiator and very long hoses, is VERY easy to have air accumulated in it. After
a while, air will start cooking your cooling system and cause major damage. So, the 
periodical flush becomes a very important preventive maintenance.

James
