I picked up my 85 Westy with (110,000 miles on it) a month ago for
$5,200. Granted I got a good deal, but I don't think you should have to
pay twice that for this vehicle. 

I love my Westy but I am constantly amazed at the prices people ask for
them. I was recently at a dealership where they wanted $18K for a '90
Westy with 100,000 miles on it. This thing cost $21K new! Talk about
resale value. I guess it is all supply and demand. As long as the US car
companies think people who want campers want 30 foot long buses with
sofas and satellite TV then VW will own the small camper market. And the
limited supply will mean people can still ask what they want for them.

I would keep looking. The right van is out there, you just need patience
to find it. It took me 2 months to find mine.
