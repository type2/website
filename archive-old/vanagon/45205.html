Subject: RE: Oil Temps, Coolers, and pumps, separated circuits?

Trevor E. envisions an electric aux oil pump.  I would picture this would
have to be a fairly serious pump.  Engine oil pump looks like it uses
a horsepower, maybe more.  Even tho' Trevor's pump would never be asked to
move cold oil, to have an effect it would need to move good volume.

Maybe you could make something effective out of the oil pump from an auto-
matic transmission car, that has the second pump built right on.  Note that
Porsche six oil pump is two stages: one to scavenge the sump and put the
oil in the (nine-quart) oil tank, the other to pressurize oil from the oil
tank and give it to the engine.  Thus my sending oil all the way to the
front grill to an aux cooler has no effect on engine oil pressure, altho it
probably costs me some amount of power.

Does anyone know if there is a correct orientation for an oil cooler.  I
have mine with fittings pointing down, so that I don't have to worry about
any sediment building up, but do I have to worry about air getting trapped
in there?  Thanks!
