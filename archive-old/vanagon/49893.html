Subject: Re: 91 Westy in Hackensack, NJ



&gt;The 91 Westy located in Hackensack, NJ with 3000 original miles is
&gt;indeed a 3000 mile vehicle. 
(snip) 
&gt;The vehicle was stolen.  The thieves did a major number on this vehicle.  
&gt;They ripped the transmittion out, the engine was removed and the dash 
&gt;board was torn out.  

Apart from the the theft damage, a 3000-mile-old vehicle should look pretty 
much like new. Stained seats, etc. after only 3000 miles?  You say the dash 
(and therefore the odometer) was ripped out and later replaced. If I were 
interested in this vehicle (which I am not), I would be very skeptical of 
trusting the mileage reading on the probably-replaced odometer without some 
sort of additional irrefutable proof of the actual mileage.
