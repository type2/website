Thom,
It sounds like you might be running rich.  If I remember right, If your car 
runs better
cold than it does after it warms up, it could be a sign of a rich mixture. 
 A 28 PICT
is pretty old. Unless the jets have been replaced they are probably 
&quot;wallowed&quot;
out some.  Did you say you had black smoke?  On acceleration or 
deceleration?
Any backfire on deceleration?  If so either you have a rich mixture or an 
exhaust
leak.  If you want to re-jet your carb, Gene Berg still lists a pretty good 
selection
of main jets in his latest price list.

'70 Bus

P.S.  When I bought my Bus, it had a hole in #3 piston(overheated and lost 
power
but the guy &quot;couldn't see anything wrong&quot; and drove another 50 miles on the
freeway).  It would start and I could drive for a couple of miles before 
power would drop off.  When I replaced the pistons and cylinders I did the 
quick rod bearing
test ala Muir.  No problem.  Unfortunately after increasing the compression
with the new p/c's, it was too much for the marginal main bearings(hurt from 
mileage
and overheating) to handle.  Kept getting intermittent engine seize. 
 Warmup=lockup.
Cool down and would run again. Only make it about a block.  Bottom line- 
depending
on the age and general shape of the engine if you are going to put new p/c's 
in
you may consider doing the bearings too.
