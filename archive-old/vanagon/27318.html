On Mon, 23 Oct 1995 18:30:39 -0500 you said:
&gt;Could somebody please clarify the differences between a &quot;GL&quot; and a plain
&gt;camper?  What would I be missing in a 1987 Westy if I went with the &quot;Plain
&gt;Jane&quot; model?

the two levels of camper differed in the sink and stove, basically. the
GL had them, the lower level did not (but did have the icebox).

&gt;What would an 87 camper (Sink, Stove, Refrig)  in good condition go for?

the prices vary so much around the country, it's hard to say ... but you
can figure that on the west coast, the price will be very high ... maybe
as much as $14,000. in the southeast, it would be nearer to $8-10,000, if
that high.
