Subject: Re: California Emissions...

&gt;Leave it to Rusty to obsrve the obvious but will someone please remind me
&gt;why EVERY Californian is moving to Arizona and Colorado? 

A lot of the people moving from California are leaving to avoid the high
cost of living and high congestion.

&gt;I absolutely do not intend to insult any past or present Californians
&gt;(Except Nixon) but to sympathize with the eternal crud that they are
&gt;subjected to. Add Smog Certificates to the other disasters. BTW have you
&gt;ever checked on the tasty surcharge involved in bringing a vehicle into and
&gt;registering it in CA? 

I moved to California from Massachusetts, and I can assure you that anyone
complaining about smog certificates is simply whining.  In Massachusetts a
car is not only inspected for exhaust quality, but is also rejected if the
headlights aren't aligned, or if you have a hairline crack in your
windscreen, or if your tires don't show enough thread.  You can even be
rejected for having body rust-through.

This happens not every other year, but yearly.

&gt;Let's please not start a thread on slamming Californians... 

Especially since we're all such nice folk.

Ron
