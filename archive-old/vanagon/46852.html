&gt; In retrospect, I was probably being overly conservative in stopping when 
&gt; the oil temp hit 230. In fact, I travelled the same road (Lake Louise to 
&gt; Moraine Lake) several days later and did not stop at all.
&gt; 
I know it's an *entirely* different beast, but I used to see oil 
temps of 260+ regularly in my Corrado. Normal running seemed be 
around 210-220 for the G60 engine. Now that I've slowed down 
considerably, I tend to watch the temps a bit more (since I have the 
time....;)
