&gt;I was wondering -- why is there a VINTAGVW
&gt;list, a vanagon list, and rec.autos.vw and
&gt;no cross-connection.  The volume on the

well, the way i see it is like this:
Vintagvw is mostly inhabited by beetles, ghias, and the odd few squarebacks.
         very few buses, and even the things have tried to start their own
         little list.
rec.autos.vw seems (to me) to be inhabited by mostly rabbits, golfs, and the
         water-cooled 'cars'. not too much beetles or buses.
vanagon list started up in one place, grew a bit, then kinda died. then
         gerry resurected it and it grew a bunch more.

the lack of cross-connection seems to be due to the narrowness of the minds
and interests of the posters. :)  beetle folks don't seem to care much about
buses (unless they have one of each) and certainly don't care about rabbits.
and the reverse is true.

it would be much more convenient to read rec.autos.vw.bus or somesuch, but
it is much easier to set up a mailing list (well ... that's what i heard)
and not everyone has access to netnews. hence the mailing lists.

&gt;Frankly, I can't handle the volume ...

this is a common problem, and one that causes lots of folks to quit this
list and others. what i've had to do was to cut back on the number of lists
that i subscribe to and make many of them send in 'digest' format.

&gt;If this is a long dead issue, could I get a succinct reason why.  If it is
&gt;historical and/or inertial, does anyone want a cross-&gt;over engine to appear?

i'm not sure i understand what you mean by a 'cross-over engine'. but it is
certainly NOT a dead issue. it's one of those things that comes back up
every so often, but nobody ever does anything about it. but then, are there
really THAT many issue that affect beetles AND rabbits AND buses?  i mean,
we have a hard enough time on THIS list getting participation from just the
four generations of buses ... things that affect Microbuses don't necessarily
vanagon owners and vice versa. i'm sure that almost all of the Microbus and
Bus folks get kinda tired of hearing about vanagon water pumps and coolant
problems. lord knows, we all get tired of that silent smugness those Eurovan
owners have. :)  but their turn will come. someday, their cars will have
grey hair!

so what's to do? i don't know. i'm not expert enough in networking or the
internal workings of all this to know what COULD be done, much less what
SHOULD be done. i find that i have to make a choice based on MY time and
work and diskspace and likes and dislikes. and that's the best i can do for
me.
