&gt;I must interject to the list snobs here.  I have been wanting to lower my
&gt;'85 Westy Wolfsburg.  Before the snobs delete...The reason for this
&gt;desire is that my Vanagon rides 2-3 inches higher in the front than in the
&gt;back.  I know I am not the only one with this situation.  For the
&gt;snobs/purists, I believe that my Westy would ride better, and maybe even
&gt;look like an 80-83 or a 86-90 Vanagon. Why would that be so horible?
&gt;I am ready....Flame away  8-)

OK Flame out for a moment :-)
Replacement stock height springs are (at least right now) only available from
VW at an outrageous price and we don't get many requests for them.  What we
do get requests for are the &quot;lowered running configuration&quot; springs that were
available on 88-91 GL Vanagons.  Most of of the requests are from Westy
owners that wanna get their pride and joy into their garage because it sits
so high.  So since early 95, we have been importing matched 4 piece sets of
these springs right from the manufacturer in Germany.  These springs lower
the ride height approximately 45mm (1 3/4 inches for you non-metric types)
and it does improve the handling as well without sacrificing the ride
comfort.  Couple these with KYB shocks and possibly Addco Sway Bars front and
rear and then it gets really sweet.  I've tried the used spring and &quot;heat 'em
up and cut used springs&quot; route.  Not a very good idea as I had problems
getting all four sides to match with the ride height.  Price on a set of
lowered springs are $495 (VW gets over a thousand clams at last report) for a
set of 4.

OK everyone, flamethrowers back on ;-)
