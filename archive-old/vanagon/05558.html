Subject: Re: Street camping

One example of a &quot;good neighborhood&quot; that doesn't have individually perturb-
able property owners is a college or university campus.  You may need guidance
from an Internet contact or a passerby as to where students park their cars
overnight, but once you find that area you'll typically get better security
patroling than surrounding areas do, without being in an all-night-traffic
situation.
