Subject: Re:Does air cond.=hp loss?

Turning on the air conditioner in my 87 certainly was noticeable, both in
hp and gas mileage. The freon disappeared after the first year or so and
I've never bothered to have it repaired and having cold air blown at the
back of my neck was not pleasant. But your post raises another question.
Do I gain anything by removing the belt that drives the compressor?
