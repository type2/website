&gt; rec.auto.vw.aircooled
&gt;            .aircooled.bus.50
&gt;                          .51
&gt;                          .52
&gt;                          .53
&gt;                          .(etc.year of bus)
&gt;            .aircooled.van
&gt;            .aircooled.bug
&gt;            .aircooled.type3
&gt;            .watercooled.van
&gt;            .watercooled.all.others.that.I_dot_can't.think.of.right.now
&gt;            .events
&gt;            .misc
&gt;            .forsale
&gt;            .wtb
&gt;           
&gt; That sounds great to me!  We could effectively turn one news-group 
&gt; into 100's of little ones!  Then no one could complain...
&gt; 
Hey, lets also subcatogorize each group/year by percent of rust
versus percent of steel versus percent of Bondo in the body just
for kicks.

'71 Westy Virginia, would be in
    rec.auto.vw.aircooled.bus.westy.poptop.71.95%steel.2%rust.3%Bondo 
and
'90 Corrado G60 in
    rec.auto.vw.watercooled.corrado.G60.90.OZwheels.runs.like.shit.
etc.

I know, I know, we should just stop talking about it already.
