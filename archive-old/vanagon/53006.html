&gt; &gt;How common is it to find the factory sunroof on a 1980 - 1991 bus?

&gt; Quite rare.  I'd guess something like 1 out of 50 to 1 of 250 Vanagons
came
&gt; with that option.  I don't believe it was offered after about 1986 or
1987.

I wonder if it would be a good idea to renew the seal or stock up on a new
seal which is still available at about GB#60 here in the UK.
I presume if there was no replacement seal its goodbye to the sunroof. Do
you think these parts get deleted without warning?
I have one on an '84 GL and its going green at the edges.
