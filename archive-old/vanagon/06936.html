&gt;...                      I have tried plugging the EGR but have had the same
&gt;concern, higher head temps (this may be more important for a Vanagon engine
&gt;that is operating at 350F). Joel says its ok, but since he doesn't have a
&gt;PhD in physics I am not sure I can trust him....;). DC

nyuk nyuk nyuk. don't forget that i had an external oil cooler on that bus
... so that might have brought my temperatures back down (if they did go
up when i welded the egr stuff closed).
