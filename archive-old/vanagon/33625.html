So Veeduber_at_aol_dot_com says:
&gt; 
&gt; If you have an easily removeable part that is liable to attract thieves you
&gt; may wish to consider an alarm switch activated by the removal of a critical
&gt; fastener.  
&gt; 
Seems like a motion sensor would cover this problem, although the
sensitivity might have to be set pretty high.
