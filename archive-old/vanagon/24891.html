Subject: Alaskan Trip

Regarding Prudhoe Bay:  If anyone is interested in receiving a packet of 
information, I'll have Alaska Lands send out a packet of information to 
anyone who emails me their address.  As far as access to the oilfield and 
Arctic Ocean, it's true that it is restricted, but arrangements can be 
made.  If there is interest, let me know and I'll check it out.  

I spent some time at Prudhoe for the university and its fasinating place.
By the way, I still have an 84 vanagon in Kansas City that needs to find 
its way north to Alaska.  I'm tenatively planning on flying down and 
driving it back - but am wide open to suggestions.

84 Vanagons
