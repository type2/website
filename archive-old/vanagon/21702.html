&gt; &gt; I think the list would appreciate a comprehensive report about the VW
&gt; &gt; junkyard in Longview, Washington.  (I know I would!)  I've seen their ads,
&gt; &gt; often wondered if they were worth a 1200 mile detour on my way to the store
&gt; &gt; some day :-)
&gt; 
&gt; Maybe Joel can start a list of good VW junkyards around the country.  We can
&gt; tell him about theses places and give them ratings for prices, service, list
&gt; member discounts, etc.  How about it?

      Some advice on how to convince spouses/children that road
      trips to VW boneyards qualify as a good family vacation
      would be appreciated...
