&gt;I checked out the web site dedicated to VW tents.  Very cool!  Does anyone
&gt;have experience with the Reimo tents for Westy's?  The Gemini, Vento and

&gt;Can someone help me with the German exchange:  How much is $1800 DM for
&gt;example?

Check your daily paper.  It changes day-to-day, but today's Merc lists the
exchange rate as .6467 dollars / mark, so 1800DM would be $1,164.  Quite an
expensive tent!

You might want to look at the tent Westfalia makes.
