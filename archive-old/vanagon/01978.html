&gt;And now for something completely different...
&gt;Maximum speed on flat ground? 95mph on I-10 East in Calif.
&gt;It's International Orange; the same color they paint utility vehicles
&gt;and garbage dumpsters.

well ... i always heard that Ugly was faster than Pretty. :)  &lt;it gets to
ya quicker, don't you see!&gt;

seriously, FLAT ground? as in, no hills, bumps, hollows, etc.? i think
you had a CHP car pushing you, bub. trying to get you OUT of california
as quick as possible.

on a more congenial note, that is actually NOT a bad color to have a car
painted. one, you can ALWAYS find it in the mall parking lot. two, very
few people will park next to you. three, other cars can see you very well
on the highway, in all sorts of weather.

my sister had a volvo station wagon in that color (factory paint, no less!)
and, while not being the most attractive shade, it was very practical and
useful. i would recommend one small change/addition: paint the roof white.
this seems to make it even more noticeable (while reducing the heat intake
of the bus).
