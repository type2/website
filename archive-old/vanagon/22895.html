Subject: TFORHAN's got a syncro!



Tom Forhan and his family stopped by this evening in their new (to them)
syncro.  Looks good, runs great.  They're camping about 10 miles out of 
town.  Then on south.  Sure wish it was mine...

On another subject.
Is there a full length roof rack available for a Vanagon that is 
similiar to that which I had on my '62 splitty?

thanks for any input...

oh yeah, I'll send my bio as soon as I get a little while to put
it together.
