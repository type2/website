Subject: Rainy Day Starting Blues

Anytime it rains overnight my '85 Vanagon (Big Blue) will not start in the
morning.  No evidence of water geting in the engine compartment.  Crank it a
few times, throw around a few superlatives, go in the house and wait an hour,
come back out, it starts???  Any ideas?

Bertha rolled through last night and dropped about 8 inches of rain on us, so
of course Big Blue wouldn't start.  My wife had to be somewhere so I gave her
my Ghia keys.  Well it wouldn't start either and I'm in trouble.  My wife is
kind of fed up with the Vdubs.  So I need help finding out what the deal is
with my Vanagon.  Thanks!
