 Gee.....that's funny.....My 80 Wanagon has one - works on all 3 speeds. 
 Microfilm shows that it could have been installed at the factory....maybe
 an optional install at the dealer by the original owner? &gt;&gt;


Some say yes, some say no. So what's the deal?   Did '80's have them or not?
 Jim, is your &quot;Wanagon&quot; a late '80?
