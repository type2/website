Subject: Broken Head Blues...

Well, just found out the source of my Bus running a bit strange lately.
Diagnosed with a dropped valve seat, cylinder no 1. No compression on no 1,
125 on all others. I've been quoted anywhere from 2500$ for a rebuilt motor
installed, to about 1000$ for two new heads installed. I plan on driving
this bus across country this summer, so any advice as to my best options
would be greatly appreciated. Should both heads be replaced or rebuilt, or
can I get by with just the one?    Thanks alot....Tom

&quot;I'm fine too, but you no get in without the password&quot;
