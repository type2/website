Subject: oil capacities

Yesterday I changed the oil in my '88 Vanagon.  I usually put in 4 qts and
then add more to hit the full line (after running the engine).  Yesterday I
put 5 in accidentally.  The oil level is a tad over the full line.  Checked
the manual, it said oil capacity w/filter is 4.8 qts.  Is the .2 qt
overfill something to worry about?
