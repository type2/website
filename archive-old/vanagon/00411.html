&gt; what the idle valve (seems like there is another name for it) does is to
&gt; keep a pipe closed when cold, and open up a little round 'valve' when it
&gt; warms up. like an old electric choke.  the bentley test (as i remember) is
&gt; 'if it hummms/vibrates, it's working'. ?

That's an interesting test.  I can just see the test flow now.  If it just
hummms/vibrates its okay.  If it is singing &quot;Melancholy Baby&quot; replace it. ;)
