Subject: EV Manuals UPDATE....


I went to my dealer today and threw myself at the mercy of the service
manager...and got a couple new sections to the manual set. He also
let me borrow the looseleaf binder with the wiring diagrams. Here's
what I have to date:


Body - Exterior, Body - Interior

Fuel Injection &amp; Ignition

Manual Transmission

General, Engine

Suspension, Wheels, Brakes, Steering

Electrical Equipment (not wiring diagrams)

Body Repair Manual (seems to be directed at body shops for collision
repair)

Electrical Wiring Diagrams, Troubleshooting &amp; Component Locations




I'm going to head into the office this afternoon and shoot a couple of
copies of the last one....
