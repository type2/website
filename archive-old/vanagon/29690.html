&gt;The lower 8 inches of the doors are badly rusted.  I want to remove the
&gt;doors but the screws that hold the hinges on are very hard to get loose. 
&gt;Anyone have any ideas for freeing extra large phillips head screws?

Mike,

Try this, coat the screw drivers tip with water based valve grinding
compound. After coating stick it in the screw(s) a couple of times to coat
the screw's interior with the compound. 

This will provide MUCH extra friction/antislip/grip. It is important to use
a bit in good condition and to coat it before making a removal attempt. If
you get impatient, well don't. Apply heavy downward pressure on the driver
while turning. If it doesn't come out you may want to come back to it later
and try again. A little heat (the old blue tip crescent) sometimes helps but
only as a last resort.

I assume you will soak these screws ahead of time with your favorite rust
penetrating oil.

Good luck.
