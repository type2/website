Hi,
	I did something very unusual today.  (before breakfast, even)
I bought a new muffler for my bus, but I bought a factory muffler.
The guy at the VWFLAPS looked at me like I'd asked for a grilled weasel
on a bun with fries when I asked for it!  Seems they don't sell very many
amymore!

	It ran me about $125 with all the clamps and stuff, and copper
exhaust nuts.

PS - The obsession with lawyers is due to a mjor influx of new sig lines
pertaining to lawyers, and my sig script works sequentially.  Gotta fix
that, I guess.  What was that random perl script line again?

Thom
