Subject: Drain Plug Update

Welp,
The new 14mm drain plug stripped out again yesterday. I was afraid it
would--tapping a hole only 1mm wider than the original didn't give me a lot
of confidence in the new hole's integrity.

I just got a rubber plug and put it in. I had to shave (read: hacksaw--not
kidding) the head of the plug to get it to fit into the recessed mating
surface of the drain plug hole. that seemed to work OK.

What I really need to do is get a 15mm x 1.5 or 16mm x 1.5 tap for the
threaded insert I have. Then I can loctite that insert in place and have
what VW should have put there in the first place--a non-aluminum drain plug
hole.

This was on Kalypso, my '87 van.

Why am I changing the oil so frequently (2x in a month)? This has to do
with the gas in the oil and the oil light/warning buzzer.
But that's another story.
