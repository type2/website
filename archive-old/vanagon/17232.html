Anyway, I know of the basic
historical changes in design ('49, '67, etc...) and believe that the third
(late '70s) will start to be out of my price range. I'm willing to spend
between $2000-$2500, maybe more if a peach materializes.

   IMHO you can't go wrong with a post-73 camper. Just don't
   buy any flavor of Vanagon or (God forbid!) a Eurovan.
