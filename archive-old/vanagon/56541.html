Subject: Sightings per mile - Honolulu.

It seems to me that Honolulu has a large number of Vanagons. I went as far
as to count the number of vans I saw driving around town for
a couple of days. Here are the results of my survey:

In town (urban Honolulu):

		32 vans in 32.8 miles  --  almost ONE SIGHTING PER MILE!

Overall (includes freeway trip to van-poor rural area):

		39 vans in 106.8 miles  --  .34 vans per mile.

The high point of my survey came yesterday on a trip accross town:

		7 vans in 4.5 miles  --  1.56 vans per mile.

This was from very casual observing, obviously I excluded known repeats
(like the neighbors van) but there may be some double counts because I'm
on an island.

This is a lot, right? If anybody else wants to contribute please count and
post, I'll compile results if there is enough interest.
