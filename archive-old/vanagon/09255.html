&gt;From: smitht_at_jupiter.sun.csd.unb_dot_ca (Tim Smith)

&gt; The bulb pulls out of this holder, and costs $0.99 anywhere fine automobile 
&gt; components are sold.  Try this on an older Rabbit sometime, same bulb but it 
&gt; takes about 2 hours, to remove the instrument cluster, surrounding panel, 
&gt; fresh air duct, disconnect the speedo and wire harness. I kid you not. Just 
&gt; maybe VW learned something from this?   tim s.

Are you sure you are doing that right?  Not to brag, but I can do it under
5 minutes.  I often get rabbit intrument clusters for parts (gears, lights,
etc) at salvage yards.  Thats with out breaking or tearing anything in
the process since broken parts are no good to me.  I get these parts when I can
since they will also fit the other vws in the fleet.

BTW, thoses bulbs that go in the instrument cluster are the same ones used in
Volvos.
