&gt; Seperate subject.  The drivers door lock (85 Vanagon) can only be locked from
&gt; the outside with the key.  Is there a way to disable this 'anti-lock-out'
&gt; feature?  It sure is annoying.

The only reliable place to find Really COOL VW stickers was at 
Grateful Dead Concerts, in the parking lot sold by travelling Dead 
Heads.  I have also seen them at T-shirt shops but the bearlymovin is 
very rare (at least around here). I got mine at the GD concert in 
Giant Stadium last June.
Maybe someone knows where to get them mail order?

Good Luck
