Subject: Re: Attention Closet '59 Panel Owners

&gt;I have found a '59 Panel with an owner that is very willing to sell, and
&gt;thought
&gt;I'd post it here. It's somewhat of a project, but is *close* to running so
&gt;I've
&gt;been told. The owner is asking $275, but she really just wants it gone. It's
&gt;in
&gt;the bay area, Mt. View to be exact. I don't have any vested interest...just
&gt;trying to provide a little temptation.... My driveway/parking lot is too full
&gt;for me (and SO) to consider...
&gt;
&gt;If anyone is interested, I can post more details and phone numbers. Otherwise,
&gt;well, perhaps its off to the crusher. SNIP!!

EEEK! that is to painful to read , off to the crusher :( :p, why do these
vans always turn up in calif.? if it waws any closer, i'd come and get it!
