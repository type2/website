 I can't imagine plastic shrinking to the extent that it's visably
 noticeable. But swelling/expanding pressed wood, which most, if not all
 the cabinetry in our Westies is made of, is notorious for swelling when
 wet ... or under very humid conditions ... especially really cheap pressed
 wood.

 &gt; &gt;Is anyone else experiencing shinking plastic trim pieces on their
Westfalia
 &gt; &gt;interiors.  It seems that around all the openings and the edges of the
 &gt; &gt;tables and stove/sink covers the edging is slowly getting smaller
exposing
 &gt; &gt;the plywood.  I was wondering if it is from heat or is time the enemy?
 Is
 &gt; &gt;there anything that can be done to slow the process, or can this material
be
 &gt; &gt;replaced?  Just trying to keep it looking new for as long as possible. &gt;&gt;


Actually - it IS the rubber trim edging, not the formica clad particle board
shrinking...
due to heat and UV rays...this happens on all Westys...
my '74,'77and '79 westys are all like that.
but the good thing is that you can just go to your local hardware store and
buy that edging off a roll usually in the kitchen/bath section...
