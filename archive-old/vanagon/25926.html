Hello all.  My friend with the recently purchased '71 squareback is 
looking to sell his '85 Vanagon GL.  We are wondering if the price is 
about right.

'85 Vanagon GL
4 speed, rear seat that folds out into a bed kind of thing.  Middle 
rear seat that removes.  One half of the engine has been redone 
because of the dreaded antifreeze leak.  This was a couple of years 
ago, no problems since.  It needs an exhaust header pipe and some 
front end work.  $600 from a local mechanic.  His estimates have 
always been very close when he has worked on it in the past.  I think 
the body is straight, surface rust on a couple of the seams.  Said 
friend has offered to deliver it anywhere in the US after the exhaust 
has been fixed.  He was thinking $3,000 was a good asking price, 
knowing about the $600 any new owner would need to spend pretty soon 
after purchase.  Appox 105,000 miles.

This sound about right?  E-mail me if interested and I will put you in
touch with him.  Thanks, Jim
