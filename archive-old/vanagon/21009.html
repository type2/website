Upon further reading of Muir they have update in the Changes and New 
Ideas section, it suggests that you don't need to support the tranny 
when you pull the motor.  The guy who wrote it says he never has done 
so on his '78 bus with no problems.  He mentions something about a 
couple of bolts holding the tranny to the frame or something.  I 
wasn't actually out there so I couldn't look.  So, what is the 
netwisdon on this one?  Did I just waste $13 on that nifty strap?
