Subject: Larados or Yokos?


I have had Uniroyal Larados on my Westy for 35k, so far no problems, not 
even a flat.  The PO had 2 new ones on the front when I bought it and I 
matched the rears, purchasing them at Costco (price was attractive, only 
$43. ea at the time).

That being said, I have been following this long tire thread and I have 
become convinced that the Yoko 370G's are the way to go.  Mainly 
because of the higher load rating, also, the high marks for performance 
make them more tempting.  I agree with those who put safety before price 
or other features.  While its true that I have had no probs with the 
Larados I believe in prevention.  Tires are critical.  IMHO this is not 
about performance, looks, price, etc, this is about the safety of your 
passengers, other people on the road and yourself.  Personally, I think 
that a high speed blowout 
in a loaded Vanagon is a much more serious situation compared to the 
average car on the road.  The vehicle is tall and heavy with small 
wheels, I think it could roll fairly easily.

I have nothing bad to say about the Larados, they have served me well.  
However, if they do fail due to incorrect load rating, I may not be 
around to complain about it (or worse, someone else won't).  Not being 
made of money I will disregard my 
own advice for another 10k or so to use the Laredos up, but when it is 
time for new tires I will buy a set with a load rating that *exceeds* the 
actual load that is put on them.  I have enjoyed the bliss that 
ignorance provides, but now I know about the load ratings and have 
done the math.  It looks like I will be paying an extra couple of hundred 
dollars or so for peace of mind, but thats exactly what it is, peace of mind.

My .02 cents worth (ok, .03 cents worth)
