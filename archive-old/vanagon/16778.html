Subject: dreaming of a westy synchro

After 25+ years of split windows, with a beautiful 67 deluxe still hiding in 
the garage, I've come to realize that there will always be a vw as my 
driver and major camping trip vehicle.  A couple of years in soul-less 
toyotas and I'm back.... The 67 has become a weekend toy and I'm in the 
market for a 90 or 91 westy synchro.  Any thoughts about the advisability of 
such a move would be appreciated.  Also, ideas about availability (especially
in the Pacific Northwest) will be kindly received (yes, I know that not many
 of the beasts are out there)
