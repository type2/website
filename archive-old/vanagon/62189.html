Subject: Rack am Ruined

Hello;   After replacing the rack and pinion in my 87 G, two weeks ago, I
have been losing  ATF from the p/s reservoir at a rate of about a cup a day.
I parked the van over a sheet of cardboard overnight and found that the leak
was from both ends of the rack where the rubber bellows slip over the
housing.  Did I get a bum rack and pinion? or could some debris in the
system, which I didn't flush, take out the new seals.  Has anyone else had
this problem?  This is the rack that cost me $1000. hadn't even lasted one
month.  No other symptoms to report,  Dexron oil ATF Castrol no rude noises,
no excessive heat or any thing else  Puzzled  Larry Carter
