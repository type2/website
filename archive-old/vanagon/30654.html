Subject: getting started, TDC, hyd. lifters

I'm finally ready to fire up this air cooled 2 liter that I've been 
putting together for the last few months! Just before it got cold a few 
days ago I cranked it over and it did turn, and made some small, though 
quiet, firing sounds - but didn't catch. I know there's fuel running 
through the main fuel ring as I can hear it when the ignition switch is 
turned on, and I know there's spark coming from the coil. I suspect it is 
possible that my distributor drive shaft is 180 degrees off and I'm 
trying to check with #1 cylinder at TDC, firing position. Here's the 
problem - with the new hydraulic lifters (when I installed them I had 
soaked them in very warm oil and given them finger pressure to make sure 
there was some resistance - there was, and to help bleed any air from 
them) I'm having difficulty seeing any real movement in the valve train.
The engine is installed in the vanagon and I'm working solo so I can't 
turn the motor and observe the valve train at the same time - How can I 
find TDC firing position for #1? Must hydraulic lifters be &quot;primed&quot;? To 
what to I attach a remote starter switch? Any starting tips would be 
greatly appreciated. Thanks!
