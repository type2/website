Subject: dual battery relays

I have a 76 westy, and am thinking about finally getting my other battery
working again (i.e. getting a new deep cycle in there).  What I need to
know is if anyone knows how to wire that box that goes between the regular
battery and it.  I'm assuming that box is a relay of some sort, but the way
it was hooked up didn't seem to provide any charge anywhere, and random
changes produce the occaisonal &quot;click&quot; but still no useful charges as far
as I can tell.

Thanks,
Eric
