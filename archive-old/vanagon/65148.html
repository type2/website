&lt;&lt; I hate to &quot;migrate&quot; some of the comments from the VintagVW list about Hot
 VWs, and VW Trends over to this list, but what the hell....

 These magazines are a total waste... &gt;&gt;

that's your opinion.

Remember...not EVERYBODY has internet access....
and as far a Tech articles, photo shoots, show info, etc. - you can't beat
the VW mags.

(BTW...check out VW Trends Nov '97 page 49 picture 10.....
I'm the guy sitting on the ground in front of the blue bus.....  :&lt;)

(if it weren't for VW Trends, I wouldn't now be famous!!  :&lt;)
