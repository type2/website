Subject: RE: Another Tire Q


SM&gt;A fellow at Discount Tire here in San Diego, recommended a Yokohama
SM&gt;reinforced tire in the 185 width, claiming that they see a lot fewer
SM&gt;warranty returns of this tire. If true, that's a good point, but keep
SM&gt;in mind that the suggestion came from a salesman working on commission.
SM&gt;I've never tried those, or any other reinforced tire-- they may be
SM&gt;excellent for all I know. Caveat emptor, y'know?

The good gentleman is right on all points but I do caution as he says
salesman on comission.  This Yoko is likely the Y356 available in 6 and
8 ply rated, a very suitable tire EXCEPT it is a &quot;highway ribbed&quot; design
more like a genuine delivery truck tire.  It has very few channels IE
NONE
to channel water to the outside, looks like most bias plies did in the
70's.
They wear well, handle well, and are just dandy till you get them in the
rain when they get &quot;squirrely&quot;.   A friend has them on his '87 and
loves them
except when it gets wet, however they ride exceptionally quiet and he
has
45k on them and they still look great treadwise.

My $0.02 of free info, Tire rack was selling these $55 or so 6pr, $60
or so 8pr
when last I checked months ago but may no longer sell the 6pr their
budget
leader in this size now the Conti.
