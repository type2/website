Has anyone ever experienced leakage from the O-ring that sits in the groove
on the outer part of the adjustment ring (both the early and later type

exactly as it was).  I'd imagine that most leaks come from the inboard seal
that Jim describes in his replacement procedure, but since I have the seal
kit that includes the O-rings, I'm wondering if it's worth the extra effort
to replace the O-rings, too, as preventative maintainence.

Thanks,


Ron
