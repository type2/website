&gt;What's the &quot;normal&quot; temperature for an '83? The right edge of the
&gt;temperature needle is always next to the right edge of the LED.
&gt;It fluctuates. At stop-and-go, it can move up to the 3/4 or higher
&gt;position. At highway speed, it goes back to the LED's edge.

my 88 puts the needle just a tad up over center on the led's edge. and it
pretty much just stays there, once it moves up to that position. i've never
seen it go over, but during a rainstorm, it has moved down enough to cover
the led.

i think it's pretty much a very individual thing for each car. all the
differences between the electrical connections, senders, engines, and
radiators ... i think what you need to notice the DIFFERENCES, rather than
looking for a 'correct' position. my old 86 vanagon would put the needle
at exactly one needle-width ABOVE the led (with the needle-width of empty
space between the led and the bottom of the needle). and the high-speed
fan was LOUD!!! loud enough to scare the hell out of people in front of me
at red lights! :)  the 88 bus is nice and quiet, even on high speed (or
else, high speed has never cut in ... which i doubt).
