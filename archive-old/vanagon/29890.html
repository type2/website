&gt; I have 4 used cv joints I parted out from my old bus that check out fine (no

Ron, IMHO as long as they're in separate bags, you're probably okay. I 
think Bob Hoover's wise to suggest replacing the balls to the original 
slots, etc....but most other sources don't recommend that degree of 
precision.

The thing you might run into is getting the CV jammed by assembling it 
&quot;backwards.&quot; If you do, there is a way to get it unjammed. I succeeded in 
unjamming one by strategically &quot;punching&quot; the center part out of the cage.
BUT&lt;--- you have to determine exactly where to punch, or your efforts are 
pointless and if you got really carried away, using Thor's hammer or 
something, you could probably damage the CV.

If you're scared to try this, sell ME your spare CVs. ;) Joe
