&gt; Well, if you want something KOOL, then I would rather put up with a lack
&gt; of cooling power, than the hassle of lighting the fridge. It just doesn't
&gt; seem to light until my thumb is good and bloody! EVERY TIME!
&gt;
&gt; Anyone have any maintenance tips besides vacuming the spider webs?

I thought my 'falia was the only one that takes two hours and
1,672 clicks of the ignitor button to start the fridge on propane!
Guess not.  The stove burners ignite right away.
