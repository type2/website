Subject: Re: Soggy seats and short trip 

Hello to those with wet rumps, I once had soggy seats also.  It was a '86
GL, it was gold to, maybe thats the problem.

Actually, here is what I found and fiddled with until the flooding stopped.

That big A/C thing that hangs down in the back of van blocking the rear 
view mirror produces copious amounts of water.  If I remember correctly, 
it is a great source of hot and cold water.  Anyway to avoid babbling, it 
has drains on boths sides with tubes running into that vent area on the 
outside of the van, from here the tubes, which are terminated by a funny 
one-way tip, drain down and out the bottom of the van near the engine.  
This is where all the water comes from that you see dripping out of the 
engine compartment when your running the A/C.

Those drain tubes tend to get clogged with dust, at least on my van, I 
think I just kept blowing compressed air through them until they became 
unclogged.  I'm not sure, but the water started to flow outside the van 
where it's suppose to.

Oh yea, you need to get this fixed ASAP, behind the molding on the left 
side of the van, under the A/C unit there are some very expensive relays 
that, at least in my case, got wet, corroded and became $80.00 chunks of 
useless metal.

If you need more info or details, let me know, I'll go look at my old van.
