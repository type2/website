&gt;  Now if others have introduced a simple clean pleasing valve on/next to 
&gt;the sink, please describe just where you installed it and what valve you 
&gt;used.  I feel that it's important that whatever valve is introduced, that 
&gt;it should offer virtually turbulant free unrestricted flow at its fully 
&gt;open position.  This clearly precludes the use of many common valve 
&gt;designs.  But most good gate valves I've seen are too ugly.  This must 
&gt;work well in flow control and to the eye. 

I have built a &quot;snap-in&quot; sink unit for my non-westy Vanagon that mounts in
place of one of the rear facing seats behind the front passenger seat.  I may
write more on this if I'm inspired someday.  What I used for the faucet was a
very nice unit from Shur-flo (sp?).  It is made of high quality white plastic
and has a switch/valve built in.  When you first move the switch/valve knob
the switch &quot;makes&quot; and brings on the pump.  The remainder of the knob's
rotation controls the valve and the water flow very smoothly.  The part of
the  faucet that hangs out over the sink (seems like this should have a name,
hmmm?) is pretty trick too.  It pivots up &amp; down, side to side, and also
rotates so that you can even turn it upside down and have a nice drinking
fountain.

I got the faucet from Camping World for around $26.  I'm very pleased with
it.

Good Luck,
