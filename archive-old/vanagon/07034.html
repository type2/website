Subject: EuroVan Fog Light Switch


For you EVers who are contemplating putting fog lights on your EV,
I have the part number for the fog light switch...the one which
will fit next to your rear defrost switch, etc. Its:

			535 941 535 01C

Its actually a pre 93 Passat fog light switch...and lists for $16.55.
