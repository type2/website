&gt; &gt;Does anybody know if one of these shop air compressors you're talking about
&gt; &gt;will drive a pressure washer??
&gt; 
&gt; ?? i thought the &quot;pressure washers&quot; had little compressors of their own ...
&gt; which was why they cost so much.  not so?  anybody seen an accessory for
&gt; a shop air compressor that would turn it into a &quot;pressure washer&quot;??? i sure
&gt; could use something like that. :)

they are sold under the trade name of &quot;Thunder Gun&quot; or some such 
thing.  essentially it is a siphon gun but hooked to a garden hose so 
maybe its a hose-gun.  anyway, it blasts out water mixed with air 
creating a impressive looking spray but is essentially frothed up 
water... maybe they work better than i'm describing (the ads say they 
do) but a pressure washer is a different animal altogether.  i guess 
an additional siphon hose is provided so one could mix a solvent in 
with the water stream, or contaminate the entire water distribution 
system by this handy plumbing cross-connection.  fleet stores and 
'Northern Hydraulics' sell 'em for about $30-$40. 

i've come close to buying one but think a scrub-brush, can of Gunk, 
and a hot water hose will do much better and be less messy.  could 
probably make snow with it tho, in winter time.
