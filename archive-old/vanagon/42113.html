Subject: Re: 12-point tool


&gt;&gt; 4.  Where is a good place to get the 12 point tool for removing CV joints
&gt;&gt; with the dreaded connections?  Thanks
&gt;
&gt;I've used a 6-point metric allen wrench with no problems (I think it was
&gt;6mm but it could have been 7mm). You can buy the whole set of metric
&gt;allens for under $10 or pay $12 for the one 12-point tool (and I'm only
&gt;quoting a price I heard..I don't know of a source).

The 6-point will strip the 12-point out immediately in my experience. You
can take them out with the 6-point if you use vise-grips at the same time,
but it will destroy them. I had a couple joints that had 6-points and
12-points all mixed up together, and when they're covered with muck you
can't tell the difference until you feel it strip...

That's OK, though, because the new boot kit will have new 6-point bolts
(unless you get the six dollar boots manufactured in India, in which case
you deserve whatever happens to you). The 6-point and the vise-grips are
really all that's necessary.
