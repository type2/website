Subject: Need TIPS restoring on Westfalia '66

Hi,

	I just brought Westfalia(SO-42) bed, seats, and closet at
Manassas, VA today. The condition of Westfalia wood materials are kinda
stale, no varnish on it, not much smooth surface, and dirts.  Should I use
the sandpaper and varnish on it? What kind of varnish would be apporiate? 


Thank you,
Jason K.
