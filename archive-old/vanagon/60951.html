Hi fellow listee's.    (Ok, not a Vanagon question, but still VW.)

The SO wants a new mode of transportation.  Something to replace the '86
Scirroco Automatic she has now.  Her motive is the Scirroco is hard on her
back getting Tersa (14 months old) in and out of the car seat in the back.

So we looked at a Passat, 4 door, very convienient, very &quot;family&quot;.  Then I
took her to look at a Corrado.  '91 G60 motor with auto and ABS.  It's priced
very right.  And of course the SO likes it 'cause it's:   VERY RED, Cute,
Smaller than the Passat.

Does anyone have an opinion, on the '91 Corrado.  By the way, if I buy, it
needs a &quot;valve body&quot; for the auto, and the rear deck lid parcel tray and
speakers.

Ch
'89 Syncro Beast
'86 Scirroco
'87 GTI 16V
won't buy anything but - a VW.
