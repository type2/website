Subject: Diesel owners manual

Hi I'm relatively new to the list and was hoping someone had a spare 
owners manual to an '82 Diesel Westy.  Unfortunatel, the PO threw out the 
&quot;non-essential&quot; items such as owners manual, spare tire, jack, etc..
Fortunately, it was a steal at $400!! ;) I bought the Westfalia manual 
from the dealer, but the van manual is out of print. Thanks
