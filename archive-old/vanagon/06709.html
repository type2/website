So Jim Macklow says:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; On this week's &quot;John Laroquette Show&quot; there was talk about &quot;making love on
&gt; &gt; the back seat of a VW bus in Big Sur&quot;.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Is this an omen, or WHAT?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I'd call it wishful thinking.  :-)
&gt; 

That depends on who your sleeping partners is....

And since it will be cold, I think the odds are in my favor.  ;D
