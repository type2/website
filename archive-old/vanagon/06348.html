&gt; &gt; So, which is more severe, 10 miles in stop and go traffic, or 50 miles at
&gt; &gt; 65mph, through mountainous, sometimes freezing conditions?

&gt; 	IMHO, 10 miles stop and go. The engine doesn't make much heat in
&gt; stop and go, so the oil probably doesn't warm up until the end of the trip,
&gt; if at all. Plus wear on the clutch and brakes. Cold outside, even freezing,
&gt; isn't bad for a running car. If you can make a steady 65, it ain't that
&gt; mountainous!

Ok, Ok!  I actually meant on the downhill part! :-)
