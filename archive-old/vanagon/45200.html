Subject: Whereabouts of Bob H.

No I am not holding him against his will (too much.)

He has limited access to his email, so please please don't flood  him with
personal mail.

Bob has been busy helping me with my Beck Spyder and related sundries. I
will let him relate the bloody and burning details in his own inimitable
style. (Although some scans may show up at my web page by the end of the week.)

Also he has been helping me to understand some of the better methods for
setting up a working shop. Hint: Don't mount an 80 pound vise on a 45 inch
high wooden bench assembled from two by fours.

Bob
