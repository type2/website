&gt; THESE THINGS FOR LIFETIMES AND STILL NOT HAVE A CLUE ABOUT HOW THE HEATER
&gt; CONTROLS WORK?

First off, STOP YELLING, we can hear just fine.  Second, what heater 
control are you talking about, the little green knob with the cross?  
That's the thermostat/timer combo.  It controls how much heat the gas 
heater puts out.  If that's not what you're talking about you're going to 
have to give us more info.
