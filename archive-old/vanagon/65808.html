Subject:      syncro power steering lines?

Hi I'm looking at buying a syncro and driving it home.  The power steering
lines are supposed to be rotted from sitting (I haven't seen the van yet).
The trip would be about 5 hours.

I was wondering if there would be any problem with driving it this way?  I
haven't had a Vanagon with power steering yet so I don't know what the
setup is like?  Could I damage anything driving it that way?  What about
pulling the belt off the ps pump?

If it works out I would rather drive it than pull it or trailer it. . . I
know the rules  ALL 4 tires on the ground or ALL 4 tires on a trailer.

If I do tow it (all 4 on the ground, likely with a tow bar) are there any
speed or distance limitations?

THANKS for the help
