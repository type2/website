&gt; Isn't it true that it is not good for the car to let the gas get
&gt; so low?  You are then &quot;feeding&quot; sludge from the bottom of the tank,
&gt; and not good for fuel injectors, etc.?
&gt; 
&gt; 
	I don't think this would hurt a vanagon; aren't they bottom 
feeders to begin with??

	JUST KIDDING!!!! :) :) :) :) 8)
