     They drive on the left side of the street in S.A., right?  Gotta go to
     Europe.

Wasn't Chris Turner (JordanVW_at_aol_dot_com) talking about organizing a group buy
of these from South Africa?

Maybe we could shame him into getting back into the game ;-&gt;

&gt;
&gt;      Does anyone out there have a line on getting Euro-spec headlights
for
&gt;      the late Vanagon?
&gt;
&gt;      I don't want to go retro to round lights (always wanted a Vanagon
with
&gt;      rectangulars).
&gt;
&gt;      Do our Canadian friends suffer with the same S.A.E.-approved junk
that
&gt;      we have?
&gt;
&gt;      Anyone in Europe with access to a few good wrecking yards want to go
&gt;      into business?
