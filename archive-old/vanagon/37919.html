&gt;Hey all,
&gt;I think I figured something out today.  On my '78 bus, I have
&gt;discovered that the EGR system appears to be disconnected.  The part
&gt;of it inside the engine compartment is still intact but the part
&gt;where it connects to the exhaust pipe on the driver's side just in
&gt;front (FIF) of the muffler is non-existent.  The hole on that part of
&gt;the exhaust pipe has been crimped shut.  Apparently someone has
&gt;removed this. .... being an environmentally conscious fellow, I'd
&gt;like to have my bus running as clean as possible.  But if it costs
&gt;too much to fix, then I would be willing to run a little dirtier (ah,
&gt;the wonder of economics in action).  Any ideas?

&gt;From the exhaust pipe to the engine tin, there is supposed to be a
little filter pack of some kind.  From the picture I've seen, it looks
like the filter, pipes, and flanges are all one unit.  Probably a VW
only item.  My bus is equally disassembled, and I've been meaning to
call a dealer and find out if the part is still available and how big
a hole it's gonna burn in my pocket.

As to whether or how much it improves engine operation, I don't know.
Anyone?

My question is, if/when I get this filter thingy, what kind of
adjustments are necessary in terms of a tune-up to make the engine run
correctly?  Also, how do you test the EGR valve to determine that it's
working?
