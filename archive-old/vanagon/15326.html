Subject: stove to go


I forgot to add that when I first ordered mine, I spoke at length on
the phone with the secretary of Max Burton Cookware about the product.
She recommended either wrapping things in foil, or putting
them in a disposable or other foil/metal bread loaf pan to
fit the inside of the unit, or perhaps even better - to use the
oven bags.  These are the types you can put a whole turkey in (they
come in various sizes, made my reynolds), and can withstand oven
heat.  YOu just off the twistie they provide, open up the stuff, pour
it out, eat, and NOTHING to clean up - viola!

She added that truckers really like this unit; they put in a beef
roast with some sliced onions, herbs, veggies, potatoes, etc., and
then have a super quality meal at their destination, with all the vitamins
(at least those not destroyed by heat) all sealed in the plastic oven
bag.  

On the way to Kelley park, I threw in some crispy shrimp, and they
were good and hot by the time I got there (90 minutes or so).  Just
don't forget to unplug the thing from your DC source when you get
to your destination!  :)
