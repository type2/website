Subject:      Ric's EV INFO: Programmable W/W?

Welcome home Ric. You didn't miss much weather  (NOT!)

Programmable W/W on the MV?? Am I missing something? How do you program
them??

So what EV news do you have for us news-hungry EV owners? What did you
see?? Any new models?? What did you drive there?

Best,

Hal
