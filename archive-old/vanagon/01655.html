Subject: Re: on oil level

I can see that I am under attack on this oil level thing.

As you can see from the following, typically the oil temperature will be
around 205 to 230 F in the summer in hard use. I had heard about the
disadvantages of filling the oil level to the top, so I always filled it only
to the middle of the two marks on the dipstick, never higher. The highest
reading I ever got was 235.

One day my mechanic put in fresh Mobil 1 right up to the top of the dipstick
and after about 15 mins on the highway I looked down and the oil temperature
was up to well over 255 and I freaked out wondering why. After I drained some
oil out so the level was more near the lower mark, the temperature went back
down to 215 or so.

Why is too much oil a problem? I cannot remember, but there is something
about internal resistance or beating the oil into a froth. I cannot remember
why the froth is a problem, but perhaps it is because it mixes air into the
oil which then gets pumped around in the oil passeges.

My oil temperature sender is not in the dipstick. It is in the place that VDO
specifies for the 2.1 litre vanagon motor. I don't have my diagrams with me
now, but there is a pressure gage and a oil temperatrue sender. These go
underneath the left side of the motor and the other sender is near the valve
cover gasket. I think it goes in near an excess pressure oil bypass valve.

You have plenty of oil at the minimum mark as the minimum mark is quite
sufficient for all oil passeges to remain full and there is plenty of oil in
the bottom of the crankcase.
