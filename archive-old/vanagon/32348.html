&gt; Subject: re:VW and good advertising

&gt; Isn't is strange/ironic/sad that all the stories about good
&gt; service from VW comes from Europe? [sigh for VWoA]

I don't have a copy of my letter to LiMBO (a few years ago)
handy, but in it I described going to a VW dealer &quot;garage
sale&quot;.  Take some of your worst visions of going to a garage
sale and apply that to watching the friendly local VW dealer
selling out.  Lots of tables with unidentified VW parts
going for a buck.  I assume it was the stuff they couldn't
send back for re-stocking, and a lot of used stuff, but I've
seen better selection at swap meets.  Sad.

Years ago, when the dealer was owned by &quot;Hans&quot; the VW dealer
was unquestionably the place to go to keep a VW alive, well
and beautiful.  What happened can be told easily enough by
the evolution of the name of the dealer:

University Volkswagen
University Volkswagen-Fiat
University Volkswagen-Lincoln-Mercury
Bemis Volkswagen-Lincoln-Mercury
Bemis Lincoln-Mercury-Mazda-Volkswagen
Bemis Auto World

Or something along those lines.  VW got lost in the ABC's of
alphabet soup, and so did the parts and service.  For
several years, instead of 3 miles, I had to go 30 miles to
the closest actual VW dealer.

Since then, the former service manager of University
Volkswagen started his own shop: &quot;Chucks&quot; and has recently
been &quot;authorized&quot; by VW to do something with VWs.  But it's
just not the same.
