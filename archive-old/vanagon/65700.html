Subject:      Vanagon Engines

I'm new to the Vanagon scene having just purchased a 85 westy that has a
great body/interior but it does need an engine. The question I have is,
has anyone used the rebuilt engines from Fast German Auto in Santa Ana
CA? Or has anyone heard anything bad about them. They are one of the
only one advertised i Hot VW mag. I would also like to know the
difference between the 85's and 90's other than cosmetics.
