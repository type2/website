&gt; &gt; I'd like to get a set of alloy wheels for my '87 Syncro. Called the nearest
&gt; &gt; dealership and was quoted a price of nearly $400 a wheel.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Needless to say, I ain't buying them.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 2. Does anybody know of third party sources for these wheels?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 

There is a used Westy/Vanagon broker in San Rafael, CA - Hoch Motors -
he is a bit pricey, but has pretty extensive connetions in the West for
rounding up Westy/Vanagons for resale. He usually offers a 12 month/12k
mile warranty on vehicles - his premium over general used market seems
to be 20% or so.

Anyway, he has offered a set of 4 alloys with tires (Michelin?) for
$1000.00 - not terribly bad - $300 worth of tires and $700 of alloys?
Well, this is still pricey, but far better than the dealer.

Of course, I still have the lovely, grey plastic wheelcovers on
Cassie.....
