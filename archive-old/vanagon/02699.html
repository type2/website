Subject: Camper Equipment Advise Needed


Its finally going to happen...after reading about the Type Two Trip, and
then getting the info about &quot;Busses by the Bouy&quot; in Maine, this September..
my wife has decided she wants to try camping in the Eurovan. Now mind
you this is no simple decision....seems that her family loved to camp...
in those sort of places with no showers, no toilets, etc...so upon
reaching her 18th birthday she said &quot;NO MORE CAMPING!!!!&quot;

Eversince I bought the EuroVan and discovered that it is really a
quasi-camper, I've been trying to convincer to try it again and
she agreed. Years ago, 12 to be precise...I drove home in a
two year old 911sc...to which wife #1 (known as all ex-spouses
are as &quot;shithead&quot;) announced that I had too many &quot;toys&quot;  (cars)..
as most of you on this list know...you can NEVER have too many
cars (toys)...

So the 1967 camper was sacrificed....two years later my '74 Thing...
as she stated it was either the cars or her.....in retrospect, I
made the wrong choice.  8-(

Ahh...I digress....anyway, the 67 camper was a nice &quot;turn-key&quot;
operation...get in and drive..then stop and camp...the EV 
does not have any of that stuff...other than the table, folding
bed, and my electric cooler. As I have been out of the camping
game for so long, I need to get some stuff...

So what stuff do I need folks? What would you suggest? I have
access to a beat-up 71 Westy...and am thinking of stealing the
&quot;sink&quot; cabinet...is that worth doing...removing the jump
seat in the EV, and putting that in when we go camping.

Those of you with Loaf Westies...is this doable...or am I just
wasting time?

The rest of you...give me a list of what you think I would need
for camping gear. Thanks.
