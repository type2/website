Item Subject: '73 Bus suspension
Hi all

I hope I won't bother everybody but this is for Brian (Volks)

I'm not sure that you got my former messages (or maybe I didn't get your
answer?) as I now receive my mail on a new machine...if it doesn't work
properly I'll get back to the other machine.
I wanted your advice about Bus front suspension (lowering etc...)

TIA

Fred
