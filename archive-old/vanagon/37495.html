&gt;
&gt;Hi Volks,
&gt;I am looking to replace the battery in my 82 westy (Helga). Can
&gt;anyone recommend the best ones to buy, and what the dimensions
&gt;need to be to fit under the passenger seat? I use her as my daily
&gt;driver, and take her on road trips at least twice a month. When
&gt;camping, I use the battery for running the stereo, and some
&gt;lights, usually taking the battery to it's limit. So it does get
&gt;drained regularly. Eventually, I would like to go to a two battery
&gt;setup, but just need to find the time.
&gt;Any help would be greatly appreciated. 
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;Steve Termecz

for a vanagon,  you should get a rabbit diesel sized battery.  This is
because the battery is in the other end of the car that the engine is.  The
size and shape for a rabbit diesel battery is the size 41. Champion,
Interstate, Die hard, etc., all offer size 41 batteries.  Choose the one that
has the most cold cranking amps if you can find it on the battery.  I buy
mine at sam's wholesale club.  Champion 41, 670 CCA's costs $42.00  

This battery will fit properly in the hole under your seat.  The size 42 will
also fit, but it doesn't offer near the reserve that the 41 does.
