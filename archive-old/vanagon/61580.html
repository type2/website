Subject: 4th of July trips?

What's ever'body doin' over July 4th weekend?  Any trips in the 
making?  

I was thinking of heading to the Delaware Water Gap between PA and
NJ and taking a day canoe trip and camping out somewhere in the
area.  Not set in stone and I haven't really checked availability; 
could be booked.
