Subject: RE:[2] Idle problems

&gt;Mine did that, among other things. I found a hole in the little one-
&gt;way valve in the vacuum line that runs fron the intake naifold, all 
&gt;the way forward to the poer brake servo. Replaced the valve 

    Thanks for the reply. However I am not aware of such a vacuum 
line on my bus. Would I have found it when I removed the engine? Is is 
possible that my '71 does not have one? and should it? Also, what is 
the purpose of this vacuum line? Sorry for all the questions, but I 
am now worried I may be missing something important.

                        Cheers
                                Jon
