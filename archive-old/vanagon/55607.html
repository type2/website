All,

attached below is a message from a fellow Tandem employee. Please
respond directly to him, as I haven't been on the Vanagon list since it
split, and the original sender is not either.

Hi,

Im in the market to buy a mid 80's Westfalia.  Ive come across one that
is in immaculate condition inside and out.  Its a 1985 westy, 4 speed,
96k on the original engine.  The owner is asking for $10,500 firm.  Is
this a fair price?  The van has been taken well care of, the owner is a
mechanic, but Kelly Blue Book says HIGH retail on an '85 is $9,500.

Any advice would be appreciated!

Thanks,

Jeff
