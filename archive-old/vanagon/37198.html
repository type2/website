Subject: RE: 1.9 TDI article

Jamie Bishop had asked;
&gt;What issue of European Car was that diesel engine swap from?

This article looked like the same one I faxed to Jack Ewald
back in December '95.  If it was from European Car it would
have been the September 1994 issue.

If anyone out there knows what engine code the 1.9 liter diesel
engine sold by Eurospec has, or is the same as, please let me know.
