&gt; Along this conspiracy theme...
&gt; 
&gt; I read a flyer that the Porsche shop was handing out awhile back, something
&gt; about legislation to do away with all cars made before some arbitrary year, 
&gt; like 1980, and give you a $2000 credit toward a new car.  
&gt; 
&gt; Yup thats what I wanna do:  trade the old 911 for a spankin' new Hundai!
&gt; (sounds of serious retching, coughing up blood and bile)

That's what you get for living in California. By the way, how do
thoes California cars seen in HVW, etc, ever get tags?  I've seen
post-67 VWs with blowers, 2200 cc engines, &amp;c &amp;c &amp;c with current
CA plates. I know that there are some smog shops which will overlook
centrifugal distributors, &amp;c....but there has to be a line somewhere!
