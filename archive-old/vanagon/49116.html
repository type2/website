Breaker one nine,

Has anyone  had any experience with oil drain petcocks (valves)? With the
rash of oil drain plug/hole thread stripping ect. this MIGHT reduce the
wear and tear in this area.The obvious danger would be unintentional oil
loss while driving but has this ever happened?

Just thinking;
