Subject: insurance, any good deals?
Date: Fri, 14 Jun 1996 14:57:53 GMT

We've been insured with 20th for 15 years or so. Every time I've checked (except for today),
they have always had the best rates. But the towing coverage was not good. We use AAA for
towing, paying about $100 per year for the 100 mile coverage.

Today I checked with GEICO. Their policy is identical in coverage and cost to 20th Century.
AND they claim that they have a towing policy rivaling the AAA.

1. Have any of you had experience with GEICO? 

2. Do they pay their claims well if your bus or bug is stolen or crunched?

3. Is their towing service woth a hoot? Are they as good as AAA? Can we drop AAA
   if we use GEICO?

Your help will be appreciated.
