Subject: new way to heat food while camping


This weekend, I happened into a store on the Sacramento River delta which
carried a product (and I bought one just so I could report to all of you) I'd
never seen before.  It's made by a company called &quot;HeaterMeals, Inc.,&quot; in
Cincinnati, OH (1.800.503.4483) and is essentially a pre-made meal in
a box, but with a self contained, disposable heating unit accompanying it.

The meals seem to come in a variety of flavors; I chose chili for no particular
reason.  Mind you, I wasn't into eating the thing, but VERY curious as to
how the self-contained heater/stove would work.  Anyway, I still haven't
eaten it, and may never, for the same reason.  Here's how it works:

Inside the box, there's a food heater made of salt, iron, and magnesium.
When water is added, it becomes salt water.  This causes the iron and
magnesium to produce heat....and heat the meal.  Basically, you open the
included water pouch, pour the water on the food heater (which looks
like a bag of iron filings).  You repackage the food and it's surroundings,
put it back into the carton, and close the tab for 14 minutes, and
viola - a hot meal!

Now it struck me that the would be not only a good way to be able to heat
food while camping if one runs out of fire/propane/etc., but might also
be a viable recycling goal for old iron and magnesium.                

How hard would this be to make?  Anyone out there a chemist-guru and know
the proportions?  Pros?  Cons?

 
Btw, the price of this was about $5, but I assume it could be had for cheaper
if not bought in the type of store I happened on.

Yes, I still am lusting after a DC/12v coffee-grinder and daily hot showers!
