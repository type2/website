rusty, if you don't mind, allow me to butt in.........

tim the table you are referring to is not the spicerack. the spicerack that
a 65' camper is vastly different from the pull out table that is used on
the side of a coldbox for a 1971 Campmobile. the spicerack for the 65' was
desigend to fit on the rear cargo door of the split, it remains stationary
on the rear cargo door. The rack that tim is referring to (the one i think
he is referring to) is designed to fit on the side of the coldbox and
pullout (not remain stationary). the two &quot;racks&quot; is two vastly different
beasts!!

michael

out &gt;&gt;&gt;Just for the fun of it ask if he has a spicerack/L shaped whatnot cabinet
&gt;&gt;for a 65-71 westy camper. It has gotten to be my standing joke but I still
&gt;Ok, will do. Is this spice rack the little side cabinet with the flip-up
&gt;table top that used to be bolted to the rear facing seat by the sliding
&gt;door.? Good for making sandwiches while standing outside. I have one with
&gt;table, one without if so. I'm fond of them, very convenient units to mount
&gt;anywhwere.  tim s.
