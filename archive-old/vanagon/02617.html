&gt; 
&gt; if it's a PRIDE of lions,
&gt; and a HERD of cows,
&gt; and a GAGGLE of geese,
&gt; and so forth,
&gt; 
&gt; what are a bunch of buses when they all get together?
&gt; a brick-yard? a bakery of buses? a parking lot?

That be a PACK I believe..

&gt; 
&gt; just stiring the pot a little. :)
