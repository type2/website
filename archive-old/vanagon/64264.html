Subject:      Dometic Fridge Woes

For the past couple of months, I have seen many posts refering to
the Dometic Fridge, but I have ignored them as I thought they did
not apply to me.  Apparently they do.

When I first bought my new (to me) Westy, the Fridge worked fine
on gas.  The only differences, one month and 6500 feet.

See if anyone can diagnose this (please).

I follow the various instructions to light the beast.  When I attempt
to ignite it (using plunger A), an (small) explosion erupts from the
flue vent.  At night you can see a blue flash in the vent, but then
nothing.

Any suggestions?  Is it posible it's getting to much gas? too little?
too much O2? to little?  Should I fill the Propane tank? (BTW, the
stove works fine).  Is a small explosion normal when starting?

Could this be related to the altitude?  I remember seeing some earlier
posts about a high-altitude kit for the fridge . . .

Thanks,
Stephen Jones
