Subject: Gas heater installation?

Howdy, youse all.
 
I don't know whether to be happy or scared. Just as autumn is starting to get a
little nasty, and winter is just around the corner, I've been getting
flashbacks from high school. Five days a week I'd drive my rusty trusty Bug to
school (NE WI): windows open at all temps to prevent a thick layer of frost
inside the windshield. For some reason I didn't think of that when I bought my
Bus this spring. I was planning on getting a snowmobile suit, but my dad tells
me that he got a gas heater from someone at work.
 
Now, although I'm happy thinking about a heated vehicle, I've heard stories
about how dangerous those heaters can be. Just last week, the guy who drove me
to the hospital in my Bus was telling me he was a VW guy from way back - he was
driving Busses when they were still being made! Anyway, he said that, sure, VWs
were &quot;blowing up all the time&quot; back then. BLOWING UP !? sez I. &quot;yep&quot; he sez.
 
I've saved the messages about installing an auxiliary oil cooler as a heater
core a while back, but wasn't on the list long enough to recall gas heaters
being discussed. Oops, I just remembered the FAQ. Shoot. Well, bravely
forward...
 
The identification on the heater reads:
 
		INSTANT HEATER
		mfg for VWoA, Inc.
		VW model ZVW256-03
		mfg by Stewart Warner
		South Wind Div., Indianapolis
		model no. 8345C
		serial no. 20050
 
Apparently this is 6V. There is a large fan for blowing heating air and a
smaller fan which my dad thinks is for combustion air. There is also a coil,
spark plug and a fuel control of some kind.
 
My specific questions are:
1) it seems easy to get some 12V-6V converter from Radio Shack and wire this
directly. Is that wise, or should I trade this for someone's 12V, if possible?
 
2) Where is a good place to mount this? Inside the passenger chamber or the
engine compartment? How should I position it for air flow?
 
3) Can I get a manual for this thing? I think PartsPlace in MI might sell them
for 10 bucks. Is that the best route, or do one of youse have one?
 
4) Am I nuts for installing this myself? or, Am I just as nuts as the rest of
youse? (Judging by the content of this list, If youse all say I'm not nuts, I
may be kee-razy by non-VW standards.)
 
OK, I'm a-gonna check the gopher site thingy now (if I can find it). Thanks in
advance, just for being here (&amp; there, &amp; not-all-there).
