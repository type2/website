&gt;Got a bit of a shock last night: after a spirited jaunt down the hwy,
&gt;I arrived at my destination, just as I stopped, I noticed the oil light was 
&gt;flickering every so slightly.

Nothing to worry about.  I've encountered this before.  My opinion is that it
is caused by a combination of 2 factors.  First possibility is
radio-electronic interferance from either the stereo and/or the engine.  The
second, since you mention the high temp, is the oil has just begun to loose
viscosity.  Remember, its heat that kills the oil.  

I would recommend changing your oil/filter.  Also, clean your grounding
terminals from the battary to the chasis and the grounding strap from the
engine to the chasis.  This should help eliminate the problem.
