Subject: to fix or buy $$$

here is whats up. i dont know, may be i am just looking for support for
spending $800.00.  I have owned my 71 transporter for 7 months now and am
considering replacing my 1600dp with a gex rebuild or replacing just my heads
and cylinders ? my question is, is there a way to tell the condition of my
engine with out tearing it apart or am i just wishing.  This is the condition
of my engin as i know it: I have called the last two owners to find out some
history but they were no help2. the kid i bought it from said he never
changed the oil in the 6 months he owned it!?  3. three of the cylinders have
a compression of 90lbs one is blowing 60 because of a shot valve 4.  burns
little oil  5. leaks no oil 6. it runs a good temp on the road  7. lacks the
general power i need  8. starts every morning like it was new  and drives ok.
 we are doing a major off road camper resto and leaving for belize  in 8
months i am not sure about the engine but need to order now to save $100.00
before rocky mtn. raises their price to the current gex price.  to max the
credit card or not to max that is the question?  Thanks for any help
P.S.
The statement from phoenix about the lists being students just giving
unknowing opinions. i think is SHIT.  i have not used the list very long but
it has been very helpful and entertaining. i do not take every statement as
the word of god but as helpful direction from people who love the bus.
