                         Those Damn Brakes

The Vanagon List addicts waited with abaited breath as Thom approached the
top of Dead Man's Hill, dipped slowly over the crest.  The bus accelerated
rapidly toward the Southern Pacific crossing at the bottom where the wig-wag
began to sway and the red lights flashed from side to side as the barred gate
came slowly down.  

With a scarlet wink the bus' brake lights came on.  But the boxy bus
continued to accelerate.  A mournful wail was heard.  Then another.  One came
from the General Electric diesel locomotive, the other may have come from
Thom.  The rear hatch of the bus sprang open and a red and yellow drouge
chute popped out, caught the air,  tugging free the Danforth anchor that
clattered, sparks flying from the pavement as it grappled for a grip.  The
air bags mounted in the headlights deployed with an explosive POP!  The
hastily installed Vanagon roof dive brake shot up, slowed the headlong plunge
for only a moment before being ripped off in the slipstream.  The locomotive
thrummed into view around the curve accompanied by a sharp two note blast on
its air horn.

The anchor finally found a grip on the base of a road sign, bent it over with
a comic ..spronnng!...  and sprang free just as the Martin-Baker ejection
seat fired, the rocket shooting Thom three hundred feet up to descend shaken
but safe beneath a nylon canopy.  The old Volkswagen shattered the guard rail
and was struck broad-side by the thundering locomotive, which immediately
toppled onto its side and went skidding along the roadbed, surfing a wave of
ballast as eighteen cars followed right along.

The Volkswagen was spun around by the impact, hit again by a bloated hopper
car, this time on the rear bumper.  The impact caused it to roll back up the
hill as neatly as a billard ball where it came to a stop tettering on the
crest, its drouge chute trailing behind like a tatty bridal gown.  The anchor
was fouled in its chain and had worn off one of its flukes.

Thom came huffing up, a cloud of nylon clasped in his arms, bent with a frown
to inspect the tiny scratch on the door where the diesel locomotive had
struck, muttering darkly about law suits and rubbing compound.  

&quot;Damn brakes,&quot; he finally said.  Two round-eyed boys helped him strap the
Vanagon roof back on and watched in wonder as he drove off, dragging one
foot.  The sole of his VANS sneaker smoked  as he signaled for a turn at the
corner.
