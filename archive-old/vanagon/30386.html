Subject: 1985 Vanagon Cooling Problem after drive from Atlanta to Durham

Just drove my '85 GL from Atlanta to Durham this afternoon--no problems
until I got off the freeway.  The cooling led light came on, but the
temperature gauge never registered hot--and the cooling fan has not come on.
The fill tank for the coolant is completely full now, far above the &quot;min&quot;
mark--it was a little below &quot;min&quot; when I left this morning.

I will be at this address until noon on Saturday if anyone has any
suggestions--particularly Triangle area Vanagon people!
