Subject: Tom's party

Hey all,
I had a great time at Tom's party this past Sunday.  If anybody already
posted a report (which I'm sure some did) I missed it.  There was a great
turnout -- we had 5 Vanagon Westies, including Tom's, and two of those were
Syncros, with one of those Syncros being from Ontario.  There were three
breadloaf Westies, one Vanagon Carat, one regular Vanagon and one EuroVan
camper.  So of course all of us had a great time poking through each
other's buses.  Christy and I camped out in my '81 Vanagon Westy in Tom's
driveway Sunday night and then we left for home Monday morning, me to here
(Johnson City, TN) and Christy to Chester, VA (south of Richmond).  I want
to thank Tom and Michelle for their hospitality and especially for the use
of a nice electric heater Sunday night :) .  It was a good time and I hope
it happens again next year.

Sean
