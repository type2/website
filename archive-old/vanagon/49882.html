&gt; Eric, obviously you do not live in SUNNY SOUTHERN CALIF, where the sun eats
&gt; your vehicle sometimes worse than that Pa. salt! Ive had my 84 covered for 12
&gt; years by a cover made at No.Coast Tarpaulin Works in San Diego, and my orig.
&gt; paint still looks great.

     bad.     Alot less is CA I would think.
