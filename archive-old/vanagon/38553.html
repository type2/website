Having realized that the fuel gauge on my recently purchased '64 doesn't
work, 
I headed to the tank to investigate. Lo and behold, was I surprised (not 
really) to find there was no wire heading from the sender to the gauge! There

is just one wire coming out of the sender, which is grounded to the roof of 
the engine compartment. There is also a mystery wire coming from the cab
which 
is not connected to anything. Gee, what a coincidence.

My question is: There only appears to be one connection to the sender. Should

I disconnect the ground and attach the gauge wire? Or is a ground neccesary
as 
well? If so, where do I connect it? Both wires to the same connection? 
------- 
 The hot wire goes to the push on connector on the sender.  the ground goes
from under one of the little screws holding the sender in over to the body.
  It wont work without the ground.

hope this helps  -   sometimes they are all gummed up anyway, and have to be
taken out and cleaned, when you change the oil seals.

really, who needs a gas guage anyway.    sheesh
