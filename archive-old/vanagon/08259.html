&gt; the front bumper give nothing to hang onto, have someone weld a good bracket,
&gt; I hadno problem towing mine behind a 84 Nissan 4x4,,,

   No, no, no -- put it on a dolly, it will pull much better, you don't 
have to weld anything, etc. You can even put the rear end on the the 
dolly and it won't do anything to the tranny, although it probably won't 
anyway.

    All is impermanent, but this too shall pass away, and the way of the
Samurai is death --- so speak your mind now, or forever hold your peace!
