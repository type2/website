Subject: Need EV help - &quot;Radiator Resistor&quot; - long

We'll after two dealers and one muffler shop and myself, I finally got rid 
of my rattle (mostly).  After exceuse #1 &quot;you got rocks in your heat 
shield&quot; and #2 &quot;the heat shield was loose&quot; to #3 &quot;the heat shields are 
loose, the mechanic adjusted and tightened them&quot;.  We'll I'm getting quite 
po'ed.  They still make a racket if I turn the right way.

I wouldn't be whining, but it irks me that the catalytic converter is
under warranty until 50,000 (I'm at 43,000) but that dosen't cover heat
shields.  Shouldn't they be covered?  Let's see if I remove them, my van
catches on fire.  So, the way I figure it, they are an integral part of 
the emission control system.  Please agree!

To the point, of course the mechanic noticed that only one of the two
radiator fans was running.  He said, &quot;the radiator resistor is burnt out
on one and the other is about to go.&quot;  Let's see, I have never even come
close to overheating, humph??? I'm confused.  After they told me they were
$60.00 each and they labor would be covered by my $30 checkout fee, I
found out the truth was that the parts were $35.00 each and $30.00 a piece
to plug them in.  So naturally, I tell them to get the part and I'll put
them in. 

I figure I have every Eurovan manual in existence (I hope) and I can find 
out where they go.  Well I have yet to find any trace of a &quot;radiator 
resistor&quot; in the manuals.  The wiring diagrams for the radiator fans have 
NO resistors in them, only some fuses.  

Well, I did check out what the mechanic said and it appears only one fan 
is running.  Throughout the process I did find some disturbing things. 
The battery was 50% full or empty depending on how you look at it and we 
are having the coldest nights in 10 years tonight and last night (19 F).
Secondly, the alternator has a vw-remanufactured stamp on it (dead 
alternator in less than 38,000 miles????).  Finally, I did find a part 
below the battery that looked identical to my replacement radiator 
resistor, except for the color.  So I replaced it hoping that it was that 
bad one.  It made no difference, so I left it unplugged completely, still 
no difference in the fan operation (either one).  I really don't think 
this part has anything to do with the radiator fans.

If anyone knows anything about this part please help.  I REALLY despise 
going back to the dealer for help.  They are virtually useless.
