&gt;      Does anyone know what the strongest tranny fitted to any IRS, 
&gt;      Aircooled 'dub ??

  VW went to the 091 during 1976, also the first year of the 2 liter engine (at
  least in the U.S). 
  The very beginning of the '76 model year still had the 002 tranny.

  I don't know if there is a certain connection between those 2 events. The 
  case on the 091 does appear to have beefier ribbing, though.
