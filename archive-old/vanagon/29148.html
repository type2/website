Subject: trying to get parts in Germany

James, SStones, Paul &amp; Steve:

While you were trying to decypher the post on parts in
Germany, I contacted the original poster offlist.  His name
is actually MICHAEL ANTHONY (for those of you old enough to
remember) and he was looking for someone who might need a
boat load of unregistered 1953 Type 2s.  It seems this ship
had just left Hamburg harbor in 53 during a very violent
storm.  The waves pushed the ship ashore and the skipper
left it there, assuming all was lost.

Skip forward about 42 years and Mr. Anthony is buying land
along the coast of Germany for his filthy rich boss.  Much
to his surprise the deal includes this shi*load of old VWs
on the beach of the little cove overlooked by the challet.

Now, to find a suitable recipient of this treasure, Mr.
Anthony is instructed to subscribe to an appropriate VW
Internet discussion list, post some apparent garbage and
wait for some nice VW-loving soul to offer assistance.

Too late, guys, I already offered my assistance.  The ship
was repaired, refloated and at this very minute is setting
course for the St. Laurence Seaway to Chicago (nearest port
of call to me here in DeKalb, Illinois).

I will keep you posted on the progress!

-Jim (this *is* Friday, right?) Bryant
