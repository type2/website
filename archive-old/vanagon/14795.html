&gt; Now this is interesting.  My bleeder valve is just a bolt.  Is this
&gt; tire valve type a year specific item or did someone do a custom
&gt; job on your radiator?

Well I won't swear to anything as I did this over 4 years ago but
this is what I recall, not a bolt like valve, Vanagon was origional
and never modified by anyone but VW, if they did it who knows, I
doubt it.  Incidently filled my Corrado with the new ZEREX super 5
year phosphate free stuff (this is not the environmental friendly
&quot;green&quot; stuff just their new phosphate free, comes in a silver jug and
costs only about $6.00 / gallon or less on sale, I have been quite happy and
am willing to bet its as good as or superior to VW, incidently our van
came back in '86 with green stuff though I suppose phosphate free, when
did VW stuff change color?  I have used regular in aluminum headed VW's
with no problems with corrosion, changing every two years, our 78 Rabbit
went this way till '87 or so with no problems but I would follow the
book, but hey consider the ZEREX.
