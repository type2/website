Ok after being so proud of my Blue Whale for hitting 154,000 miles with   
original cranium, now I think it is time for a cranial transplant.  Woke   
up this weekend to two continuous stills of brain goo, under the tail of   
my Blue Whale. :(

Now the options:
I can sell it and get myself a Jetta.
I am told that replacing the gaskets can just about fix it temporarily   
but eventually I will have to replace the cranium.
Do a whole cranial transplant.

Also, I am having that stupid starter problem again where the starter   
motor turns but it doesn't engage.  A have to let it sit overnight before   
it engages after a long trip.

All I see is $$$$$$$$$ :(

HELP!!!!!
