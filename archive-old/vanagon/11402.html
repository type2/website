So Brian Zigler-Geis says:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;and there on the other side of the carraigway was a
&gt; &gt;nice red bug with an engine fire.
&gt; 
&gt; This may have been covered, but what exactly causes the infamous Beetle
&gt; engine fires that consume so many?
&gt; 

I'm not sure why it's a stigma with VWs.  All cars catch fire.  Maybe the
Beetle/Buses are labeled because those vehicles sold the most over the
years and so it goes that they should have the most horror stories.  I
really don't think it's anything to do with the design.  The fact that
it sold to people with minimal incomes and typically would hold off
or completely ignore replacing things like the fuel lines would tend
to be a factor too.
