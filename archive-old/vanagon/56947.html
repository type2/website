&gt; Hi All:
&gt; 
&gt; I am looking for a simple but effective ground shut-off or disconnect
&gt; switch for my '83 Vanagon. There is not enough room in the battery
&gt; compartment for an available terminal post screw switch, plus I don't
&gt; want to be opening and closing the cover all the time.
&gt; 
&gt; Does anybody know of a pull-plug key or other external disconnect? (I
&gt; seem to remember reading about a VW hot-rod modification for a
&gt; plastic/metal remote ground connection with a big key, but that was a
&gt; few years ago)
&gt; 
&gt; Please reply to the list
&gt; 
&gt; TIA

Sounds like a great idea. One complexity would be the radio. Each time
you reconnected the battery ground key, you would need to reenter the
radio code number. Perhaps reconnecting the radio to your auxiliary
battery would be a good idea.

I've noticed these cut out switches with removable connectors (keys) in
marine shops (I think it was West Coast Marine).
