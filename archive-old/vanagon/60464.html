Subject: Re: Timing belt change frequency?

&gt; I know on my Eagle Talon, it was suggested that they're done every 
&gt; 40k miles.  How 'bout the Vanagon?  Any other repair that can easily 
&gt; be done at the same time?

I like to change mine about every 90k, just to make sure that I don't
trash the twin-overhead cams into those 4-valve-per-cylinder heads.

Oh, on my *VANAGON*, eh?  I thought you meant on a real car.  Vanagons
don't have fancy things like timing belts -- they have a gear-driven
single camshaft with pushrods -- like all boxer VW's since 1938.  Well,
they all do in the USA, because we've never been blessed with all the other
engines that might need timing belt.  Anybody from South Africa want to
answer this one for the 5-cylinder engine?  

Where do you live Karl, that has an engine with a timing belt?
