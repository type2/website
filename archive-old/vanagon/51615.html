A pair of gas pressurized shocks (Bilsteins,etc) will jack the rear (or
front) end up ~1&quot;+; you could also try those rubber coil spring expanders
that are available _at_ JCW or local Kragens/PepBoys.  They're shaped like a
fat 'H', &amp; probably won't last too long, but they'd give you some indication
after a short while if weak springs or sag is your problem.

ps - thanks to all ref removing ventilation levers from dash - I hate
forcing things but in this case it worked !
