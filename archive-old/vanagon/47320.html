I just replace both door handles on my '71 with units from RMMW -- nice 
quality. Don't remember the price and unfortunately the catalog is at home. 
They came with new locks and keys. As it happened I had to replace my ignition 
switch and tumbler so I had all three keyed the same. The keys were cut the 
same on both sides so they go in first try -- my old keys went in only one 
way. Two keys isn't too bad -- side door and rear door are alike.

I'll need to check but I think I might have the pull handle (condition 
unknown) at home -- I'll check tonight. If you'd like it let me know.
