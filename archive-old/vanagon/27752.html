Subject: Re: ya never know

similar thing happened to me on sunday.  A female friend of had a nissan
that wouldn't start, and they said they were getting ALOT of sparking, i was
worried because i hoped they knew that the last ground needed to go to the
block, or someplace away from the battery.  So i hook it up to the oil pump
or something and after a few minutes both clamps start smoking and both are
red hot, red as in the metal is orange.   Looks like a short, but after
disconnecting, the car started right up.  weird.  I went back and checked
the connections and everything was connected to the right polarity.. 

Unrelated to VW's but speaking of RA's: i called my RA and told him that
there was a large hole in our ceiling and we (my roomate and I) patched it
up, but not after looking at the naked girls, no reply from him.  there is a
big toilet paper &quot;spit-ball&quot; on our ceiling, still.
