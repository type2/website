Subject: Fresh Air Fan in '84 Westy - ARGHHH!

My &quot;new to me&quot; 84 wasserboxer westy is in the shop having fiddly things
done to it. The mechanic called me this a.m. and told me that the fresh
air fan is kaput - replacement is $179 CAN and labour would be 5hrs_at_$55.
The math is simple - 450 bucks!

My repsonse was to go out and buy a Bently manual. Has anyone had to
replace their fans? Before dismantling the dash and breaking the welds on the
airbox I would like to eliminate other possible causes. Fuses have been
checked.

HELP!
