Subject: 84 Electrical-Fusible Link?

I did get a suggestion on where the fusible link is located:
above the fuse box.  So I removed the fuse box assembly, even
pulled the instruments off the top.  (need to fix the odometer
anyway).  So far all brass looks good and shiney, with no sign of
corrosion.

I have reviewed the Bentley wiring diagram again and still no
sign of where to look for a fusible link.  The engine compartment
wiring boxes are well sealed and showed no signs of problems when
I opened them for inspection.

if not (in engine compartment)
    if not (behind fuse box)
        do while (not working)
            ask the list again
            keep checking on my own
        enddo
    else
        fix it
    endif
else
    fixit
endif

I'm looping and the Vanagon is not moving.

Any suggestions?
