So Captain says:
&gt; I have a hypothetical question...
&gt; Suppose I had a 1980 Vanagon that was mechanically very sound. This bus
&gt; would have the gas heater. It would have the weekender interior from a 1985
&gt; Vanagon installed. It is not a camper. It would be painted with a western
&gt; theme including in Roy Rogers rope style letters... &quot;Roger Bellow and the
&gt; Drifting Troubadours&quot;.  It would still need some surface rust repair, but
&gt; has never seen road salt so had no rust beneath. All of the brakes would
&gt; have been replaced including the master cylinder. 
&gt; 
&gt; Mind you, this is a hypothetical question... what would this vehicle be
&gt; worth if I were to sell it?

I'd figure anywhere between $2000 and $4000 minus $10 for every braid in
the Roy Rodgers rope.  ;)
