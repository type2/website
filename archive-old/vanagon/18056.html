Subject: Vanagon Water pump: prudence or paranoia?

Now that I've put aomewhat over 20,000 miles on the 'new' water pump
on my '87 weekender, a thought comes to mind: should I buy an extra
water pump and keep it in the van from now on?  (From what I gather, the 
average life span of these water pumps is around 30,000 miles).  The
VW mechanic's guide lists the labor to be 4.5 hours to replace it, which means
I could do it in about 8 hours if I were to get stuck.

Any ideas, insights? am I being too paranoid? 

Thanks,
Cetin
