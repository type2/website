&gt; &gt;You don't get it, Stuart. You are supposed to respond with an
&gt; &gt;equally rude and denigrating comment about either lawyers or Jews. (Guessing
&gt; &gt;here on &quot;Golen&quot;).
&gt; 
&gt; Actually the lawyer part is true...but would you believe I'm 100%
&gt; Polish...probably explains a lot!  ;-)

Geee.. I wish I had an excuse like that. When I was a kid we were called 
&quot;Bohunks.&quot;  It was some kind of takeoff on Bohemians that they applied to 
all the Slovenian kids, but telling Bohunk jokes anywhere else just 
doesn't have the same effect.

Sorry my brain is not functioning well enough right now to tie this back
to VWs.  I know I'm not the post leader, but I own the list, so I 
guess it's ok once in a while, eh?
