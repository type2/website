&gt;Does anyone have immediate access to a new copy of the 'Idiot'? I am having
&gt;trouble locating one up here, and am pressed for time in the near future so I
&gt;can't go hunting myself at the moment. I'm in the market for a (Ahaha... be
&gt;prepared to see a &quot;WTB:&quot; post in a bit, asking East coast/New England owners if
&gt;they would part with...) a '71 or '77.5-'79 Westy, and would like to initiate
&gt;my quest w/ some solid research. :-)

check the ads in HOT VWs magazines ... lots of those guys sell it.
for local hands-on purchase, check Book-A-Million or Waldenbooks (or some
other big mall-type bookstore. they usually have it in the Auto or
Transportation section.

as to the bus itself, do you know about LiMBO? it's a late-model bus club
down in Plymouth, Mass. and their bi-monthly newsletter usually has several
buses for sale. costs $20/year for the club/newsletter.
