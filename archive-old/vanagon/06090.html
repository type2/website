&gt; Bill Kennedy asks:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I'm especially
&gt; &gt; interested in items like cutting off the rain gutters at the edge of the wind-
&gt; &gt; shield, adding the $79 spoiler that JCWitless sells, adding 2-in. wide &quot;ears&quot;
&gt; &gt; at the air intakes for better engine cooling, converting to or from FI, in-
&gt; &gt; creasing or decreasing tire pressures, fiberglasing in the grill (*top* grill
&gt; &gt; for you waterpumpers), lowering the ride height.
&gt; 
&gt; A long time ago, there was a thread about how you could convert a snub-nosed
&gt; air-pusher like our vans into a sleek TGV/Bullet Train aerodynamic wonder.
&gt; 
&gt; Someone posted that you could take a cone of suitable size, put it on
&gt; a pole of suitable length, and stick it to the front of the van (like
&gt; the knights of old).  This gives the same drag coefficient as a solid
&gt; mass of the same length, but with a nice bullet nose.  I'm pretty
&gt; sure there's even some scanned photos of drawings of someone's research
&gt; that &quot;proved&quot; that putting a more rounded nose on a bus drops its coefficient
&gt; of drag dramatically on the vanagon web homepage. 
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, lately I've been thinking about putting that pole with a plate
&gt; or cone on the end on my van's nose, and see how fast I can go.  Right now,
&gt; wind drag increases as I approach 90mph.  I don't think I've been above
&gt; 90 (maybe on a downhill?)
&gt;

&gt; 

On this same though ... all you really need is a pole with a small cone
on it's tip. The purpose is to _bend_ the airflow above and around
the rather _un_ areo shape of the bus nose..old jet fighters use
to have these &quot;probes&quot; on their nose to punch through the air...

size and configuration of the pole and small cone left to student 8)
