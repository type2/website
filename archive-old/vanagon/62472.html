Subject: Parts needed for &quot;Auto Stop&quot; Propane Fill Valve

Does anyone know where to get parts and info on the Auto Stop 80% fill
valve on Westy campers?  I think all I need is a diaphragm because when
it the tank was filled and the valve shut off I had a gas leak out of
the weep hole (vent hole) on the brass casing of the auto stop valve
that would not stop.  My van by the way is a 1989 if that makes a
difference.

Are these things pretty reliable, or are they a constant headache?  If
Auto Stop parts are no longer available, I would appreciate any
alternatives to get the system up and operational again.

Thanks as always to the members of the list that make this such a great
resource.

Peter Jensen
