Subject:      Re: Best Vanaogon Brake Pads?

I can't quote using this mailer but someone said ALL brakes squeak.  I
beg to differ.  Mine NEVER did until they went bad about 2 months ago.
I had the Volksdoktor do my brakes.  I'm not sure what they did but they
make noise, and even have some &quot;play&quot; now.  I've been back 4 times and they
still can't fix the damn thing (noises of 2 types) and keep saying they were di
rty (each time) and they cleaned them.  I'm guessing they used cheap brake
parts and don't want to give me new ones.
