If that is a date, then it is most likely March 6th rather than June 
3rd.  Europeans write their dates in the order of day, month, year.

&gt;  Heizg Typ   2/255 APrute ~ S45 - What is this?

Has something to do with the heating type (Heizung = heater).

&gt;  Fargest-Nr. 226163526 - Someone said this was the VIN others say it is
&gt;  the chassis number.  If it is chassis number it starts with the 1?

Fahrgestell-Nummer is the chassis number.
