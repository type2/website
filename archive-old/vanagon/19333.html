Subject: starter soleniod

I have a 6V starter and have determined that the solenoid is starting to 
go (i.e., its not the starter).  A quick check this morning in my VW source
catalogs show no soleniods listed.  Are they (readily) available from the 
FLAPS? or am I going to have to get the whole starter/solenoid setup?  Maybe
it's time to fully convert over to 12V.....
