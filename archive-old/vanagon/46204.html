Subject: Good machine shops that do mail orders

Hi all,

I just had a local (CT) machine shop resurface my 1600cc flywheel--cost $30
(that seems like a lot!). The shop foreman said that's the going rate in our
area (Hartford, CT).  I seem to recall from the Mofoco catalog that their
resurfacing is $15.  There's only one shop I know of in CT that has a
reputation for doing aircooled VW machine work (Poroco in Canton, CT) and
when I spoke to the machinist there about having some work done to my case
he mentioned he hasn't had to do an align bore on a bug case in a couple
years.  This makes me very wary of bringing my parts there--at least for my
case I'd like to bring/send it to a reputable and experienced shop. 

I worked as an apprentice in an auto engine machine shop right after I left
high school.  It turned out to be a very hack shop--for example, we didn't
use dial indicators to measure side to side play in the valve guides--just
did it by feel (jiggle jiggle) and usually just knurled the guides without
replacing them.  I stayed for a couple months and when I realized I was
learning more valuable info from chilton's books (now that's scary) I left.
This experience left me very suspicious of machine shops.

Despite these suspicions, I'd like to have case savers installed in my spare
engine case, and have it checked to see if it needs align boring or thrust
cut, and have it cleaned.  Is there a reputable shop I could mail it to for
this work--I seem to recall a company named Rimco in California, but do they
do mail order? I'm perfectly content to take my chances with an align bore
from a good shop and I'm not interested in paying $330-$400 for a new case.

On another unrelated, but VW note:  I received my rear window seal that I
ordered from RMMW when it was on sale for $9.95.  That was a great price,
but did I mention that I ordered it in February?  That just broke my
personal record for longest backorder!  Oh well, at least it finally arrived.

Any pointers to good mail order machine shops would be appreciated.

Thanks,

Ron
