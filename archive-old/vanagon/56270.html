Subject: syncro encounter

I met a fellow syncronaut today while filling up with gas. He stopped by to
admire my rig and chat about syncros. He was driving a 87 or 88 with some
real nice driving lights. Said he bought it new and had 213K miles on the
original engine with no major problems whatsoever. He also owns a 4WD pickup
truck and an Audi syncro, but the Vanagon is the best driver of them all he
said.
