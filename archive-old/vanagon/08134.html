I have already said my little piece about editing messages,
but as someone else said,
 
Who wants to talk about what is broken on there car all the time?
Any group that talks about the same things over and over again
becomes stale and boring.

Why not ramble or post silliness?  There are a great number of people
here that consider the others to be good friends, and this list is just
a way for them to communicate to each other.  Any listserv turns
into a 'bar' of sorts, and its really not a bad thing.

and as another friend says &quot;you may have bought the VW, but it owns _you_&quot;.

Matt
