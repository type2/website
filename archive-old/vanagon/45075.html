Subject: Re: on Dormobiles


&gt; dormobiles were buildt on sunroof combi bodies, the pop top is that big.
&gt;   there are also two cots upstairs, in addition to which ever kit is
&gt; downstairs.    I've seen a couple nice dormobiles with SO42 and SO44 westy
&gt; interiors, but not one with the complete dormobile interior.

according to people i have talked to and reviews i have read the dormobile interior is not that great a 
utilization of space
&gt; 
&gt; there is a nifty skylight or two in the roof, so it is nice and light inside.
&gt;   i have heard that the plasticy canvas doesn't breathe very well and it can
&gt; get kinda steamy in one of those  :)

yes I have herad that too, I guess that is the major shortcoming of the roof is it's (realtive) lack of 
ventilation as compared to the conventionional westy roof of that period
