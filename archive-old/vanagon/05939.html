After my bad experience with an inverter (mentioned in a set of messages 
this past summer), we opted to purchase a generator.

We have the Honda &quot;EX&quot; unit.  Although it is advertised as &quot;extra quiet&quot; it 
is not absent of noise! Considering the purpose for which we have it, noise 
is the most serious impediment.

With folks spanning three age-generations in the campsite, creative use of 
the unit no longer amazes me.

So far, it has been the equal of all tasks and power demands
(the worst instance was a 1.5 Cu ft refrigerator, a 600 watt microwave, a 
small hot plate/warmer, a light set, a CD player, and extension cords ... 
all at the same time).

I didn't notice a strain and really considered it no problem until I 
started to think about all that was demanding power from the unit at one 
time.

We have tried alternative means to get the &quot;younger&quot; members to join us. 
Having sufficient electrical power for the &quot;toys&quot; seems to be the condition 
for us to keep the peace and get maximum participation. So now we just call 
it ...

&quot;Roughin' it ..... Smoothly&quot;! :)

As for the noise,

Rule #1 is respect for the environment and the neighbors.

We have tried several methods of 'noise abatement' ...

Since we normally have luggage and tag-a-long junk (stuf) anyway, we move 
the generator off a distance then build a barricade around using the things 
we take out of the van (of course we leave a safe distance from the 
generator)

I've experimented with light-weigth material which can be transported then 
arranged around the unit as a baffle.

Bottom line, we're convinced that having the generator is a benefit and 
will continue to use it.

I'd really like to hear ideas and suggestions from others about how to 
decrease the noise.
