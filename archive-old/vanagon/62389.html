Subject: Awnings, Which one?

What quality are the A&amp;E Catalina awnings from Camping World as compared to the
Fiamma model 45?  the pricing is $300 and $625 respectively.  That is a big
difference, but, if the Fiamma is a much higher quality unit, maybe it is worth
the money.  Are there other awnings available?  Thanks for any input.

Regards,
Joe Fahy
