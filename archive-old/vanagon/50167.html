My question is pretty naive, but, even if the increased stroke still
fit the existing cylinder depth, and did not play havoc with the
cylinder head due to increased compression ratio, would it not make
the engine work harder at high rpms?

So here is a specific question: I'm thinking what I need first is
torque, not hp, and that could be just a stroker crank. Is this correct?
