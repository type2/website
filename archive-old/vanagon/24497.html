Subject: Re: Bob's trip (D+3?) Addendum

Lemme guess:
48-58 years of &quot;experience.&quot; Looks kinda like Jerry Garcia, but living, hair
not as long (not even close), Not as heavy as Jerry was but not slim and
trim. Bob is pretty darned tanned and needed a shave and a shower. Wore a
dark Tshit with a pocket and sweat stains. Jeans and work boots that are
sold at Sears- the kind that are tannish and scuffy. Jeans are kinda baggy
in the ass with potential for &quot;plumber's crack&quot; at any moment. Could be
someone's Grampa. Would look at home in a Country bar listening to old Patsy
Cline and Merle Haggard tunes with a few Buck and Dwight Yokham hits snuck
in between. He'd be the &quot;lemme buy you a drink&quot;, frendly mofo but he doesn't
drink except real occasionally and with friends when he does. Marlboro reds
and a rough laugh. I guess he could come acroos as a SOB if you didn't know
him, understand his humor or (God forbid) pissed him off. If you know him,
understand his humor and gave him *hit right back you'd either become a good
friend or a dead enemy. I guess a baseball cap that has something to do with
firearms. Colt or NRA or Sexy Senior citizen.
How close did I come! ;)

Ask our man Hoover if I oughta start a &quot;What does Bob look like thread.&quot; I'm
sure he'd be REALLY happy about that one. (Secretly he'd get a kick out of
it but just act pissed).  Just teasing- I won't but it real tempting!!!! =)

&gt;Bob made it my apartment at about noon today.
&gt;Dropped off his motor, enough tools to manufacture a bus from scratch,
&gt;and some candy for my understanding wife. :)
&gt;Loaded everything up in my (untested, not-really-charging-a-battery-yet)
&gt;`72 standard bus. We'll go down to his `67 on Tuesday, and start work.
&gt;You kow how you get a preconceived picture of how people are going to look
&gt;before you even see them? Well, Bob pretty much matched what I _thought_
&gt;he was going to look like. Eerie.
