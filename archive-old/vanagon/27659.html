Subject: VW van help files....

Yeah, so my computer died the other night and took with it
all of my old documents about VW vans.  One in particular 
I'm missing is the one that is the basic overview of all
vans from like 1950-1994.  It was was only about 3 or 4 pages
long but it had things to look for when making a purchase. 
A friend of mine is looking for a bus and I told them &quot;Sure
I've got that on my computer!&quot; which of course I don't now.

Anyone that can help I would much appreciate it.  

Remember: always back up the things near and dear to your heart.

So it goes,

Scott :-)
