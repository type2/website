Subject: Re: Syncro-Tech. front axle Question


&gt;     When installing the outer front CV joint into the wheel
&gt;     hub Bentley wants the splines to be lock compounded to the 
&gt;     hub! Bentley manual state &quot;apply locking compound D6 around
&gt;     splines of outer CV joint in a bead approx. 6 mm (1/4 in) 
&gt;     wide&quot;.

The last time I had mine apart I called and asked the dealer, they &quot;said&quot;
they used the stuff, and yes it was just a loc-tite kind of thing. No they
couldn't sell me any. (Very odd.)
Mine were glued in, not too much work to get them loose. 
Good luck.
