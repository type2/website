I had heard that doing this results in shorter life than new CVs 
unless they are surface hardened after grinding. Any truth to this? 

ps: Not a van example, but the original outer CV on my Jetta was 
still usable after 365k km, probably could go another 100-200k if 
reversed. (I replaced it with Lobro, but kept as a spare).
