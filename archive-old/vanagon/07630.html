	Yes, do think about the Norton. Buy a helmet,
and a second for your S.O, if you don't already have
them. Its not like a Norton Commando was a practical
way of getting around- you wanted it for some
really personal reasons, and those reasons may still
apply.

	My friend Kevin just recently sold his Gold Wing,
and that made sense to me- he hardly ever rode anymore.

	Robert, sorry to hear you sold your guitar!
The good news is, a good Les Paul is a LOT easier to find
than a Norton!
