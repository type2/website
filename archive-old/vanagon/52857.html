well....i figure i might as well toss in my deer/vw experiances...


my beloved 74 super ate a nice sized buck for its midnight snack, back 
november maybe december of 95...its raining, a bit fogggy, and about 
2.30, maybe 3 am...i had got off work, (ew!! McD's!!) and was doing my 
normal 85-90, maybe faster...its a 15 ta 20 minute drive doing the 
speedlimit, and damn it, i'm greasy! ew!! i could regularly do it in 
about 6 minutes.. at least, in the middle of the night!:)

so, i'm maybe 1/4 miles from my driveway, down a bit of a dip, about to 
go over a SMALL bridge that crosses a brook...and my lights illuminate a 
deeer...just STANDING there, looking the other way. so, hand hits horn, 
foot hits brake...so of course, the car does the normal thing when one 
slams the brake on a wet road...all four lock up tight...

i know i wont be able to stop in time, and the edge of the road is NO 
choice...a 8 ft drop into the woods on one side, a not so gentle 10-15 
foot slopeing drop that goes back up to about 5 ft...(looking back, i 
probably could have made that, and had plenty of time to stop in the 
field...provided i cleared the fence!) so, i switch lanes...and 
immediately ddecide to go back to the othe lane, its lots safer!

FIVE deer were staring at tme from the other lane!! ack!!

No room btween them to steer this carrening orange thing...so, i take it 
as far off center as i can...with out going off the road..foot long of 
the gas by now...long, as in maybe  1 second...:) and kerthud! hit 
it...now, describing how it hit will be kinda hard to do, but i'll try..

deer standing so its head faces the way of the passendger..so..

hit it, it totals my left fender, crushes my hood up against the tool 
box, and its head left a small dent farther up the hood, just inside of 
the outter edge..then, the damn thing sorta lifts up into the airstream, 
and then OVER!! damn thing went right over me!!

foot lays on the gas after impact, and i hll ass the last 1/4 miles 
home...o, to the driveway...pull in, and drive the 1/2 miles up to the 
house..then get out...and take a quick look at the damnage..headlight is 
fine..very crooked, but not broke. the ring is gone..on the ghood you can 
see the latches of the toolbox...wow....

THENi decide to go see whats left...:) and to find my bloody headlight 
ring! (yeah, i was hpoing it was alright!)

anyway...get back, and find the ring spread for about 5 feet...in a 
quadrillion pieces..damn. tehn look for the deer. Nothing!! NOTHING!!

I start yelling at the no longer around deer...'cause damn it, if it 
could cause that much damage, why the hell couldnt it have stayed around 
for dinner?!?!!!!!!!

oh well...next day, drive to a friends, where we pry the hood open (which 
involved a 300lb man sitting on hte middle, while we pulled ont he latch...:)
got it open, and straightened it...nothing we could do about the fender..
they didnt belive it went over, at first..until they noticed the trail of 
hair from acccross the top of the windshield, most ofthe way back of the 
top..:(


oh well...did i ever tell ya the one about when my 68 ate the orange barrel?
no? well.....myaaybe later..:)
