Funny, identical problem on our 82. Previous owner had placed an
interstate in there. This what was done to permit easy access and egress.
The rear facing lip of the battery compartment was pried back, the battery
slid rearward and removed upward. Since this was done previously, it is
the method the method of choice now and it means that almost any size battery
can be put in there. While it
may sound drastic it does make the whole process a lot easier. DC
