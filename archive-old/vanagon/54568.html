Subject: Syncro air cleaners

Kyle - I just got my Syncro air cleaner today, it is awesome. It puts the
wimpy 2wd ones to shame. Needless to say the new air cleaner the PO installed
wasn't a Syncro one. If you have any filters left I would appreciate it if
you would put another one aside for me and send it to me the next time I
order stuff from you. I would hate to pay retail for one of these.

Thanks again
Derek
