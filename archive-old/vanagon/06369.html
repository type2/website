Subject: Re: anybody know of problems with '93 EV brakes?


My brakes on the EV are fine. Cetin, do you have ABS like I do on
your EV? If thats the case, then there is no way they will lock.
ABS is so much fun on the van....nothing like having some weenie
following you and then braking late to enter onto an exit ramp!  ;-)
