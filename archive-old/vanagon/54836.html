Subject: Re: EV mud flaps


Last summer while at the LiMBO Transporters By The Tunnel, I met a fellow 
EVer from Chicago. He took a set of the old bug/bus mud flaps (the black 
ones with the big VW logo on them) and made a set of brackets for them and 
mounted them in the wheel well a la T1 bus.

I have a set that will eventually go on to my bug, and it appears that with 
a little bit of drilling, the mounting bracket for them could be adapted to 
the EV. I bought the mud flaps from RMR for $22 last fall.
