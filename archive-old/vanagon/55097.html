Subject: Problems UNSUBSCRIBING

--MimeMultipartBoundary
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=&quot;us-ascii&quot;

After following the instructions provided when I subscribed, &quot;To
unsubscribe from the list send E-Mail to listserv_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu with no
subject and one line saying UNSUBSCRIBE VANAGON.&quot;
listserv_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu quickly replied with:

At 07:36 PM 1/27/97 -0600, you wrote:
&gt;&gt;--MimeMultipartBoundary
&gt;
&gt;Unrecognized request --MIMEMULTIPARTBOUNDARY
&gt;
&gt;Report any problems to 'server'.
&gt;For a list of the available requests send a message to
listserv_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu
&gt;with a body consisting of nothing but the word HELP
&gt;
&gt;PS: Any subsequent requests that you might have submitted have been ignored.
&gt;

Tried sending HELP, and tried using Bin Hex and UU and got the same
response each time...
PPS: Any ideas?
--MimeMultipartBoundary--
