Subject: 1980 VW Bus Gas Tank/VW Parts

Dear &quot;Vanagon&quot;:
     I recently was in contact with Skip Montanaro of Automatrix who said 
that you have a list of VW parts resources. I am looking for a gas tank 
for an '80 bus. Could you please E-Mail me your list of VW part sources. 
Thanks for your help.

Sincerely,
