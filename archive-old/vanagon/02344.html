Subject: Re: More trip talk

Martha Rubin suggests:

&gt;And I think it would be good to notify the two VW magazines of
&gt;our trip as well.  Perhaps they might even contribute to our
&gt;sponsorship....


I can see it now.....Martha in one of those thong bikini thingies...
posing in front of her camper....no wait....the camper bed opened
out...Martha in a nightie...HEY!....she could do both....Martha
in a thong bikini thingie on the cover of VW T&amp;A and then she could
be on the camper bed for the callendar issue of VW T&amp;A!! 


Quick, someone get on the phone to VW T&amp;A!!

ps. Now if we could only get the National Enquirer involved...wait...
got an idea...if you are leaving CA maybe in early June, we could
always re-enact the OJ &quot;rally&quot; thru LA! That otta get some press too!


Ok, so I haven't had my coffee yet....
