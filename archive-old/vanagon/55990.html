&gt; Hey Tony:
&gt; 
&gt; I am interested in acquiring a bus on the east coast sometime in a month
&gt; or so.  I wonder what the best E way to shop might be... For instance,
&gt; can you point me towards a website with 1980's vans for sale?
&gt; 
&gt; E me at newlyweds_at_aleph_dot_com (yes, this will be a honeymoon vehicle....)
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks, Will.
