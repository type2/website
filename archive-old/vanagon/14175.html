Subject: Re: Vanagon power vs. hills and loads

FYI

I have a '90 Westie Syncro with all of the fixin's (i.e. A/C, power 
windows/locks, awning, P/S, trailer hitch, etc., etc,).  I had the opportunity 
to weigh it about four months ago and much to my surprise, it topped out (less 
driver, but w/ fuel/oil/H2O) at 4,750 lbs!!!

le 
&gt; to climb a hill in a loaded vanagon, i have heard bad stories about 
&gt; insufficient power, im not interested in flying up a hill but i do want to 
&gt; climb it in a reasonable amount of time.

Hi there.  I have a '90 Westy Syncro which I drive in BC over 
continuously variable terrain, and many mountain passes.  I regulary 
climb hills of 7-8% of 12 km long with little problem.  I have to run 
in third gear at around 3700 rpm doing approx 80 km/hr.  I am pleased 
with this performance given the weight (the Syncro adds around 350 
lbs alone).  The engine is a 2.1 L.  I have never experienced any 
overheat condition doing this even on the hottest days going through 
the Okanagan.  The biggest variation on the temp gauge is less than 
one needle width past centre.  I run 20W-50 oil, and have my coolant 
set to -40 to maximize the boiling point.

Hope this helps.

Harry.
