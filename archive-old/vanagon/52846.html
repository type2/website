and Mike says:

Of course, Ben would be the best one to ask...  He told me something like,
when he rebuilds a TD engine for a Vanagon application, the reconditioned
rod length along with the thickness taken off the block in resurfacing the
head gasket sealing face and the head gasket thickness he uses results in
a lower compression ratio.  He only did a valve job for me, so he told me
to use the next thicker head gasket upon reassembly.  He does this for
some reason related to motor life or reliability.  I don't know whether
the effect of the reduced compression ratio is increased motor life, or
just a reduced probability of head gasket leakage.  Also, I don't know the
effect of reduced compression ratio on cold-weather starting.
