Subject: Re: Anyone got a bike rack or towing hitch?

&gt; heres the scoop: use yakima racks only (round bars).  mount &quot;widebody&quot;
&gt;mounting tabs onto westfalia top, the way most people mount them only
&gt;right near the back of the van before the fiberglass roof hinges (requires
&gt;four holes in fiberglass).  next mount two &quot;toploader&quot; style clips on the
&gt;rear hatch, just under the rear window.  works fine with bikes, plenty
&gt;secure.  cant open the hatch when bikes on though, but they come off
&gt;plenty easy.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Why not buy a decent Thule or Yakima and mount it vertically on the
&gt;&gt; &gt;  back?? I have seen alot of people do this.  Then you can take advantage
&gt;&gt; &gt;  of all of the other attachments for those racks....
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; You say that like you can just look up &quot;Vanagon rear hatch&quot; in the Thule or
&gt;&gt; Yakima book and buy one.  Not the case.  Any solution like this is going to
&gt;&gt; require a bit of thought and work on the owner's part.  I've got a bunch of
&gt;&gt; Thule racks and parts &amp; I've toyed around with this idea for some time and
&gt;&gt; haven't come up with a solution I like yet.  Mounting the main rails side to
&gt;&gt; side is a problem because the rack would tend to slide down and the sides of
&gt;&gt; the top of the hatch are not parallel.  Mounting top-to-bottom baiscally
&gt;
&gt;I have mounted a Yakima side to side using the towers that have about 5
&gt;squre inches of foam rubber that is clamped to the surface of the hatch.
&gt;The Yakima will also compensate for the non-parrallel upper portion
&gt;because it's mounting towers swivel 360 deg.  I am not familiar with
&gt;Thule, I personally never liked them because their bars are square, so
&gt;with an arching roof all the angles get messed up, as opposed to Yakimas
&gt;round bars which let you adjust the components to fit the bend of the
&gt;roof.  Thules fairing is also a very poor design.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; hangs all the weight on the top of the hatch through 1 pair of mounts - a
&gt;&gt; condition these mounts were not designed for.  More elaborate means can be
&gt;&gt; used for mounting, but this requires cutting and bending of the bars, etc...
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Do you have any specific solutions to suggest on how to accomplist this
&gt;&gt; &quot;Thule-or-Yakima-on-the-rear-hatch&quot;  thing?
