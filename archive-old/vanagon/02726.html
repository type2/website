&gt; In response to my little parody of &quot;Make up Your Mind&quot; Steve
&gt; &quot;Older than Dirt&quot; Johnson lamented that certain people (
&gt; I believe he was speaking for himself 8-)  ) were showing
&gt; their age....well in Joel's little inventory I think the
&gt; following catagory could be added:
&gt; 
&gt; I can remember when there were only the following Typ2s on the
&gt; road:
&gt; 
&gt; a: None at all
&gt; b. Split Windshields
&gt; c. Split Windshields and Bread Loaves
&gt; d. Split Windshields, Bread Loaves, and Bricks
&gt; e. Split Windshields, Bread Loaves, Bricks, and those WAY COOL
&gt;    EuroVans
&gt; f. Don't remember anything.....too many experiments back in the
&gt;    60s with mind altering drugs 



  g. When there were still swatzticas on the sides. ;-D

Actually f. fits me the best.  &quot;Roll A-nother One...Just
				Like..The Other one.&quot; :)
