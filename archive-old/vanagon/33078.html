&gt; Hey, Bill,
&gt;      Do you have any other info about these heaters? Or where they are
&gt; available from?          TIA.

Hi John,

	I got my Olympian Propane catalytic Heater from Camping World in 
Tacoma, WA...they're a mail order camping supply dealer.  it was about 
$160.  The 6200 btu model is around 235 dollars.  I've also seen these 
heaters at sport/camping retailers, RV dealers, and I think that 
Wal-Mart carries them too.  I thought about connecting this heater into 
the Vanagon propane supply, but the tank isn't that big to start with.  
Plus, with the portable 20# tank, I heat myself a bit out in the garage 
in the winter.  

Bill
