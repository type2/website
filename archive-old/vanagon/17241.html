&gt;I had a ball joint replaced on my syncro. It made a klunking sound.
&gt;
&gt;It cost about $2,000 to replace plus another $2,000 of diagnostic
&gt;time.
&gt;Plus, of course, about $50 in parts plus other parts they replaced
&gt;but
&gt;didn't have to.

Derek,
Are you sure you're not kidding? Just ONE ball joint? Upper or Lower? 

Can you post more details about the job in case there's something else in the
front-end that I'm missing?   Thanks!

Dan
