&gt; yeah, that's been the response i have observed as well. but i think it is
&gt; because of the mentality of the folks who bought the buses as just 'vans',
&gt; and not as VW's. there's a very subtle difference there, and perhaps these
&gt; are the people who actively seek out the caravan: the non-wavers.

I went on a little 600 mile jaunt this last weekend, and was pleasantly suprised
at the number of VW van owners that waved.  All but one, I think...  never
happens in the city though... seems the farther out in the boonies I am, the
more people wave.
