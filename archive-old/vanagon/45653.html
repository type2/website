Subject: Water Pump Replacement for Vanagon!

As Bo suggested following the old manual is a great way to go.  

The one thing that I did in accordance to the manual was to remove the 
manifold, just as well.  On removal of the manifold I discovered a small 
crack (near the mount) around one inch long.....I DID NOT replace the 
manifold as the dealer suggested BIG$$$$$, I found a good shop and got 
it welded.  The shop in CA told me that they had do many Vanagon 
manifolds with the SAME DEFECT in THE SAME PLACE!

So, you may want to check out the manifold thoroughly on removal, BTW 
the manifold FOR ME was the hardest thing to get off!.

Hope this helps,

Sincerely,

Chris Gibbs 88 westfalia
