Subject: Re: thermostats

&gt; at least it wasn't the Vanagon).  Also, thermostats have a bad habit of
&gt; getting 'lazy', i.e. they  open too soon (or actually never completely close
&gt; when cold) and the engine consequently starts taking a l.o.n.g time to warm
&gt; up.  Keep track of what your gauge is telling you, believe it, &amp; replace the
&gt; thermostat as soon as it starts getting lazy (cheap,~ $10, &amp; can be done on
&gt; a Vanagon in ~ 1/2 hour).
&gt; 
This is an interesting point - I'm now wondering if my Jetta TD has a 
&quot;lazy&quot; thermostat. I changed it a few months back from an 87deg C 
german stock one to an 80deg C, aftermarket model, since the turbo 
seemed to heat up the engine far too fast on hills. It now seems to 
take *much* longer to warm up, and occasionally sticks at ~ 3/4 gauge 
for no apparent reason, then drops to 1/2. Hmmm. 
Any reason not to re-use a stock thermostat after, say 100k? 
(replacement german ones are ~ $25 around here)
