There is one use I've found for using &quot;premium&quot; petrol (gas) and that is to
stop pinking (pinging).  Sometimes a 1/4 tank of premium with the rest
standard will do the trick.  This is cheaper than damaging the engine which
may be coked up, too far advanced or running too hot.

My two cents
