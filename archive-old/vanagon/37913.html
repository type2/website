ask for Jim or Glenn Plumlee (brothers)

Tell them that you found this on the internet.  They'll get a real kick out
of that.

Spoke with the Plumlee brothers.  Seem very straight folks.  I don't work for
them, they don't work for me, I just see the Van everyday on my way to work.
 Seems a crime to let it sit on the lot like that, but I'm already rescuing
my '82 7 pass.and an '83 Camper from the &quot;blind consumer&quot; fate.

Ever drive the automatic Vans?  It's much nicer in the city around corners
than leaning AND stretching to shift.  I normally don't like automatics.
