From: &quot;Thom Fitzpatrick&quot; &lt;thom_at_tim_dot_com&gt;

&gt;My '72 Westy, Stimpy, is having problems starting.  When I get in and crank
&gt;the starter, it sounds like it or somepart of it is spinning, without
&gt;engaging the flywheel.  If I put Stimpy in gear, and rock it forward and

Sounds like the little solenoid on there isn't popping out.  According
to the Gospel According to St Muir, 4:13, (?) &quot;Lo the shall craw under the
bus with a hammer and screwdrive, and the shall bonk the starter several
time to see if you cant get it to work.  And if thee geteth the starter to
work, then thee shall be happy, but thee shalll contemplate a new starter.
If this doth not work, and if the bus not starteth, then thee shall offer
up a sacrifice to FLAPS, and get a new starter.&quot; 

Thom's corollary.  Replace the starter bushing if you end up replacing
the starter.
