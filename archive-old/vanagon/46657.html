Subject: Gas Fumes in '78 Bus

Hello all!

My Bus stinks, literally.  There is a strong gas smell coming from the tank
in my Bus.  By making visual and feeling tests I think I have narrowed it
down to the filler neck.  What really gets me though is that the filler neck
(rubber connecting tube) is new.  I replaced it along with most of the gas
lines and the fuel gage sending unit seal this past winter when I had a
leaky gas tank fixed. (Yes I checked the spot that was fixed and it doesn't
appear or feel like it is leaking)  Back to the filler neck,  last time I
was in the compartment (month ago) I tightened the hose clamps as tight as I
could get them so I find it hard to beleave it is leaking there.  Anyone got
any ideas?


Another mistery,  there is a loud thud whenever I hit a bump in the road.  I
replaced the shocks but didn't seem to help.  I don't think it is the
battery because it made this noise when i had it straped down (strap bolt
rusted away, big surprise huh?)  It wouldn't be a broken transmision mount
would it?  That would be bad.

If you have any thoughts please Email me directly as I am not on the list now.

Thanks,
