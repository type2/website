Subject: Fantastic New Discount Parts Source

This message was sent before under the heading Syncro Front Shocks which was
judged would cause it to be missed by most who don't have syncros and
wouldn't have read that message so the message header was changed and this
resent.
=====================================================

The Overland Parts Press, Gilroy California, 6205 Engle Way

$19.95 each Vanagon Syncro front shocks part number 251-413-031 C, factory
new (German), catalog page 5, March 1996 (mislabeled as a rear shock, but
the front shock and part number are shown)

Same part is $39.50 on page 6 of the December 1995 catalog.

Other parts in same catalog: 

Syncro factory new drive shaft: $350
Syncro Front half shaft, including CVs, boots, $195.
Syncro Rear drive shaft $159.
Syncro Rear shocks $19.50 each
Plus another 50 cool parts for all kinds of VWs, including transmissions,
engines, and stuff for 2WD Vanagons

This is the only source of factory Volkswagen parts at 80% to 50% off we
have ever encountered.

&quot;Purchase of products listed in this flyer is restricted to legitimate
wholesale accounts of Overland Parts, Inc. [Like the Bus Boys? --Derek]. The
mere posession of this publication does not insure the right to purchase. A
minimum order of $1,000 is required to establish a wholesale account until
credit approval is made.&quot;

==============================

This company is obviously the premier (lowest price) source for factory
Vanagon parts in this country as it is a direct importer from Germany. Even
if they won't sell to us (cause we are not wholesale accounts and don't buy
enough individually) they ought to be willing to sell to the higher volume
folks, like Bus Boys, Dennis Haynes, (or even a mythical single entity
called the &quot;Vanagon Lenti Company&quot; which has a lot of locations around the
country?). 

As soon as my warranty runs out, I ought to be able to qualify for a
wholesale account fast!
