Subject: Gas in Oil/Bus won't start (saga)

Well, volks, I've just had a long and trying week with my '62 bus,
but all is well now (I think).  (The bus has a 1600dp with 009 and
34PICT-3.)

It started about 10 days ago when I noticed the oil level was
a little high, then a few days after that it was WAY high, and smelled
like gas.  My fuel pump is old and I had bought a replacement this
fall, but hadn't installed it yet.

Homily #1:  replace suspected parts when it's 70 degrees out
if you have the chance, otherwise it will be -5 out when you HAVE
to.

So I put in the new fuel pump, started the bus and checked that
gas was being pumped, and went to bed.  The next day, the bus wouldn't start
and wouldn't start, and wouldn't start.  I thought I'd flooded it, waited
overnight, still wouldn't start.  Now I'm thinking that the carb, which
always ran rich, had been somehow overwhelmed by the new pump and was
now so rich it wouldn't run (the plugs were wet, so this seemed possible).
So, after checking that the coil was getting
juice, the timing was OK, and spark was being put out, I took the carb
off (needle valve OK, float not sunk) and rebuilt it.  Not too hard, I thought,
especially as I had a spare 34PICT-3 and practiced taking that apart first.

Anyway, after very carefully putting the carb back together and reinstalling
it, bus won't start, argh, this is getting old.  Now I go into ignition
testing overdrive, checking everything per Muir and Haynes, and when it
still wouldn't start, I started replacing parts with good spares I had
lying around, points, condensor, cap, rotor, coil, wires, still won't
start.  I'm quite stumped, since this fall I had replaced all the
ignition stuff with new Bosch.  Even with an old gummy carb, you'd
think the bus would at least run poorly.

Anyway, after a whole week of racking my brain to think of what it could
be, I get ready to replace the carb with my spare, but first I think that
maybe the points or distributor or coil or something, which fire normally when
I turn the engine with a wrench, are losing it when firing quickly
So I hook up a remote starter and pull the plugs one by one and watch
them as the engine turns over.  Bingo!  Plug #4 fires once then stops,
and finally I've found SOMETHING wrong to investigate.  To make an
already too-long story only slightly longer, two of the plugs were
toast and one was marginal.  These were new as of about 1000 miles, so
I didn't suspect them (also at least one of the bad ones would always
fire once).  Replaced them with spares, sprayed some starting
fluid down the intake manifold (no carb, remember?) and it started
right up.  Woo-HOO!  I shouted, and put the carb back on, started it
right up, fiddled with the idle mixture for awhile and was a much
happier guy.

So maybe my fuel pump was OK the whole time and the gas in the oil
was from plugs misfiring.  I didn't notice any gradual loss of power,
or tons of misfiring so did they both fail all at once?  Hmmm.

Now I'm bummed because with all that raw gas in my engine I probably
put 30,000 miles worth of wear on it in only 100 miles of driving.
At least I have a nice rebuilt carb and a very thorough knowledge
of my ignition system.

OK, that's enough rambling, thanks for listening!
