]well ... somebody happened to mention that they wondered just where everybody
]is. so my fertile little brain modified one of those dippy little programs
]to produce this:

]this means that there are 41 of you that i can't figure out what your location
]is from your email address. anybody that wants to tell me, i'll be glad to
]add your 'loc' field in my file.

Well, I know you can't figure out my location from my e-mail address, but I
think you probably have me recorded as one of those Texas buses since you
have sent me snail-mail several times.  If not, add me to 'em.
