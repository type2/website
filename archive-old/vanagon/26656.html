How about (in '76 Westy):

 4 10' folding banquet tables
12 folding chairs
12 cases wine (that's 12 bottles to a case, folks!)
At least 20 cases of beer (again 12 bottles/case)
4 large bags of garbage 
  (not quite on Arlo Guthrie's scale, but garbage nonetheless..)
A few other smallish things I can't remember.

Oh, and this was all in one load.  And yes, it was good party!
