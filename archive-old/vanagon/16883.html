&gt; Hi all
&gt; 
&gt;     I know this is a van list but I thought there may be a few type 1 
&gt; enthusiasts amongst you. After having so much fun driving the bus I 
&gt; have decided to sell the Vauxhall and buy a Beetle as well. Has 
&gt; anyone had any experience buying one and could they give me some 
&gt; advice on what to look out for, particularly the bodywork. Any help 
&gt; would be greatly appreciated.
&gt; 

Best advice:mind the side sills (take off the footboards) especially 
near the doors' rear stile
And bring a magnet to check it's not mastic-filled...

This is really basic I'm sure you'll get answers from better specialists.

Good luck

NB this is not a van list,this is a Bus list!  :-)
