Subject: Re: WTB 85 or newer Westy.



&gt;&gt;Hi,
&gt;&gt;We'd like to buy an 85 or newer Westfalia to replace our '80 Westy.
&gt;&gt;Ideally we'd like an 86-90 Syncro in the Eastern US,
&gt;&gt;but any leads will be very welcome.

&gt;&gt;(we are located in Central Pennsylvania)

&gt;&gt;Thanks

When you find the replacement, let us listmembers know how much you want for
your '80. I, for one, would be interested.
