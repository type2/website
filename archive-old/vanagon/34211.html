There is no vw content below.  I warned you in the header.

Last I saw on PBS a show called something like 'B-29: Frozen in time'.
I missed the start of the show but it was about a dozen or so people 
who try to rescue a WWII era B-29 that has been frozen somewhere.  
What I found of particular interest were the 18 cylinder 2,000 hp 
engines.  Four of them.  There are quite a few good shots of them 
hoisting new engines into place, checking the oil, etc.  One of the 
highlights for me was a shot of two guys hanging about six feet out 
from the end of a 'torque' wrench for the prop bolt.  How about a few 
thousand pounds of torque?  Anyway, an interesting show for many I 
assume.  Certainly worth seeing if you get excited about really large 
aircooled engines.  I wonder how many valves and carburetors one of 
those engines had?  If you plan on trying to see it, stop reading, I 
am about to ruin the ending.  After many setbacks and time delays due 
to the weather and many other unexpected things, they finally got it 
to taxi out towards the makeshift runway.  It seems that they didn't 
properly secure some generator or something in the back of the plane 
and it came loose and caused a fire.  The thing literally burnt to the
ground.  One of the last shots is of four or five guys sitting in lawn
chairs watching it burn and talking about what could have been.  Then,
a couple of them start lamenting on how their tools had just been 
loaded on there.  Doh!
