&gt;When I turn the key to the accessory position(on position), the fuel pump
&gt;runs.  Is this correct?  The other listmemver says the fuel pump should 
&gt;only begin to run after the key is turned to the start position.

If I remember correctly, I could always hear the pump buzzing on my '78 
Westfalia when the key was in the accessory position. I think this is 
right, unless mine was wrong too.

Not sure about my current Vanagon. I don't recall ever hearing the pump 
buzz.
