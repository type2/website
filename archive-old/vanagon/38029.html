&gt;&gt;&gt;what you would add / subtract from your
&gt;&gt;&gt; current setup.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Know what I want? Package shelf. It's really the only thing I envy in
&gt;&gt;Splits except the swinging doors. The package shelf is useful, the space is
&gt;&gt;otherwise wasted, and no way could you do it in a front-engine. I will
&gt;&gt;never understand why they dropped it.

Forgive my split ignorance, is the parcel shelf the one under dash? I 
 saw something in the WCM catalog , part # 211-110 $125 for 68-79 that 
 was described as such. If they are that handy I may whip something up.
