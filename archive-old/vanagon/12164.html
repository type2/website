Subject: RE: Ebersparker (SP?) heater for 1970 Westie

I'm assuming you have an Eberspacher model BN4 heater.  The heater is 
mounted on the floor of the engine compartment to the right of the spare tire
well. Installation will require cutting holes for exhaust and intake air and 
cutting through the left side of the panel covering the gas tank to route 
the ducting to where it emerges below the rear .  Did y buy just thust the 
heater or all the du, cable, switch etc. that comprise the wholewhole 
system?

I saw a 72 westy once in which a Stewart-Warner heater was installed by 
cutting out the spare ti well.  The heater was mouounted below the well.  
A stove pipe was ducted through the metal cover that was riveted over the
cutout well .  I believe even the heater itself was somehow suspended from 
this metal cover.  It looked ugly and somewhat inaccessible this way.If

If you don't already have all the piecethat make uompletcomplete system, it 
might be worth oking around for a parts bus that has all the ducting/etc. 
to save the aggravation of fabricating something.

I just bought a comete BN4 system which I'll soon be installing on my 7171 
Westy.  I don't usually like to cut holes in my bus, but heat is a good 
cause.
