Subject: It's alive!! (Brain dead '87)

Volks Folks,

Thanks for all the suggestions regarding switchs, sensors, ground wires, etc.
but it looks like it actually was the brain this time.  I did the brain
transplant last night and so far it has not shown any of the old problems.
 Back to running like a champ.  Looks like it is cured!!  Yeah!!

Thanks for all the help,
Dan
