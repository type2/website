Subject: Fram Oil Filters...


OK, we all know that oil and oil filters are a RELIGIOUS issue. Here's 
my two cents worth:

	I LIKE Fram filters. Based on MY experience.

	I change the oil in my cars every 3000mi or three months, 
whichever comes first; my preferred oil is Castrol GTX 20W-50, 
although in the winter (such as it is in the SF bay area) I've been 
known to use Castrol GTX 10W-40.

	In the case of my '87 GTI, I've used Fram filters almost 
exclusively since it was new, and it now has about 103,000 miles on 
it. The compression is near new-engine specs, and it burns NO 
appreciable oil between changes.

	In the past, I used Fram filters almost exclusively on my '87 
Fox wagon, two '78 Rabbits (gas FI), and my '82 diesel Rabbit. Great 
longevity in all cases, no oil burning, etc. 

	And I use Frams on my '88 Vanagon. Which seems to be holding 
up quite well...

	Oh- my friend Craig has an '80 Vanagon, air cooled, with about 
150,000 miles on it, and it's used Frams almost exclusively. It burned 
a valve and got a new top end at 125,000, but the bottom end is 
original and it's going strong.

(Appeal to authority ahead- I couldn't help it.)

	And one other thing- european car (formerly VW&amp;Porsche) says 
they use Frams (with Synthoil, mostly) on their long-term, 
hi-performance project cars. 

	I'm NOT trying to tell anyone else that they should use Fram 
oil filters if they don't already- that's a personal/religious thing. 
But they work well for me, in a variety of vehicles, over many years.

	Later,

	Ian Abbott
