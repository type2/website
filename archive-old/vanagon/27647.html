&gt; Yeah... really little.  David took about 15 minutes just to heat up one 
&gt; little thing of Curried Prune Pilaf at Mt Lassen.

It wasn't little.  And the main reason it didn't do so well was because
the inverter needs a good healthy voltage supplied to it to power the
microwave, and even with twin 8 gauge wires running to the batteries, I
was losing half a volt under a 50 amp load, and as soon as the batteries 
lost their &quot;surface charge&quot; the inverter would start &quot;complaining&quot; due
to low voltage.  I'm going to mount it real close to the batteries to
fix this problem.  =)
