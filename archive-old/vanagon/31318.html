 Jim Ellis &lt;trouble maker so&amp;so&gt;replied:
Ya gotta understand that I am used to the generations of VW campers with
rear wheel drive and look like big old shoe box/bread loaf mofos. It is real
hard for me to get used to the shape, cooling method, amount of plastic
components, lack of noise, comfort level &lt;er, wait a minute&gt; and price of
the front wheel drive campers. &lt;that's better&gt; OK, in the spirit of the
Holidays, I will back off a bit and admit that they don't look like the
newer D*dge minivans but rather like a refined, overly expensive, version of
the '80s style Chry*ler Minivans. If I could afford one I would probably
like a bad azzed 4x4 synchro, otherwise I will stick to my '67 sweatbox
poptop and the '83 Slowmobile Westies. I can have both of these for the
price of one of these Iacoca looking  yuppie campers. Sheist, I would be
afraid to take the jewel into the woods for fear of scratching the thing.
Maybe Moriah Carey and her Hummer &quot;crew&quot; would clear the way. You could set
up camp and listen to Kenny G and eat quiche! &quot;More whine my dear?&quot;

&gt;bill and diane killian took the flame bait  =) and said:
&gt;Hard not to see it as flamebait to have an EV compared to that wide short 
&gt;station wagon.  They haven't really modified the body shape on the '96 EV 
&gt;have they?

&gt;&gt; Standing outside the other day for one of those &quot;smoke breaks&quot; (yeah, I
&gt;&gt; know, I know) I saw what I thought was a D*dge Minivan with a poptop roof.
&gt;&gt; I thought, &quot;Hey man, I didn't know that Chry*tler Corp made a camper! Wow.&quot;
&gt;&gt; The minivan made the turn and then I saw the familiar logo. Er, oops,
&gt;&gt; nevermind. I guess the shape of the '96s have changed a bit. Sorry for the
&gt;&gt; flamebait.
