Subject:      Need Vanagon for Friend

Friends just lost an '86 Vanagon -- stopped for coffee and when they came
out, smoke was pouring out of the back, and then flames, and then...well, now
they need another one.  They're in Pennsylvania and would truly love to have
a 6 cylinder workhorse to pull their bike trailer.

Thanks,

Nancy
