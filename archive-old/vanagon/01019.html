&gt;Anyone out there found an effective, and reasonably fast, way to replace

  'Reasonably fast'? Sorry, but by now you're probably feeling a bit
anemic from all the mosquito bites. ;-) :-) :-)     Seriously, Bart.....

  Some sporting goods stores in the South East (US) sell bug net screen
by the yard. If the holes are small, try cheese cloth or light canvas 
patches. Use waxed dental floss for thread as it lasts longer than regular 
thread when exposed to the elements.

  I bought a section of this stuff in the Orlando, Florida area a few
years ago.  It's large enough to cover the sliding doorway and attaches
to the roof drip rail of my '73 Westy with clothes pins.
