&gt; Why the nastiness about this issue I have no idea.

I started this flame war. I knew it would cause a little controversy. It 
was only supposed to be a joke. I thought this group needed a little 
energy pumped into it.

Now we have people calling each other names and I'm getting threatening 
e-mail. I repeat. It was only supposed to be a joke.

I'd like to say publicly that I'm very sorry I started this. It's grown 
much larger than I thought it would/should.

This is the last I'll say on this subject.
