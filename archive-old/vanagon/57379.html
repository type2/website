&lt;&lt;  All 2WD Waterboxers imported into Australia were all 5 speed
 (with a real 5th gear not an overdrive)and as far as I am aware that
 was the case from 1984 on.Syncros are all 4 speed plus a crawler gear as in
 the US.I was interested as it seems you guys were treated much more
 poorly than in Oz.We got Panel Vans,Window Vans,Caravelles,Carats,
 Single Cabs,Double Cabs,Hightops and Syncros (in any of the above body
 shapes)and ALL were 5 speed except for(obviously)autos &amp; syncros.
 Also all Double Cabs were 4 door from '88 on (correct me someone if I'm
 wrong) &gt;&gt;

Ok, so we yanks got screwed.  :&lt;)
