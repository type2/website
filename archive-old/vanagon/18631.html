Subject: Forsales from LiMBO

I called the person (Donna) selling the '84 Westy in the latest 
Transporter, and things have changed slightly.  After she place the ad, 
the engine seized.  She's lowered her price to $2,500.  I'm only slightly 
interested, but thought I'd post this to the list.  She has researched 
and it'd be $2,400 for a VW engine and 12 hours  of labor coming to $460 
to do an install or about $2,900 to put in a new engine.  Quotes from Bus 
Heaven.

Hope that helps someone.
