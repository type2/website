Subject: Re: 87 Synchro-buy it?

&gt;&gt;Dub-sters,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I have found a one owner 87 Synchro Vanagon w/ 87k. Asking about $3k. New
&gt;&gt;exhaust, don't know many other details... formerly used by handicapped so,
&gt;&gt;the van is bare behind the front seats. Any thoughts on conversions? Is
&gt;&gt;this a dog? Or should I jump?
&gt;&gt;
I recently (one month ago) bought a 1988 Synchro for $CAN4.5, 168,000 kms
(~100K mi). I have been happy so far, although there have been some
mechanical problems (plugged catalytic converter, new muffler, lost the
rear universal, leaking coolant line, leaking head gasket). I,m not
complaining, it is a lot of miles. Parts are outrageously expensive up
here.

$3K would be a very good price up here (Nova Scotia), if the drivetrain is
solid and the body is reasonable. I love the 4WD, and can't wait for the
winter!

By the way, mine was also owned by a wheelchair user, and was fitted with a
lift. The seats were replaced however.

Cheers
