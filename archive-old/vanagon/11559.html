Subject: Early Single Cab In CA Wreckyard!


Hey-

	While on a scrounging expedition this weekend, I spotted an 
early single-cab transporter at a local wreck yard. It had the &quot;small&quot; 
rear window in the cab, so my guess was late '50s or *early* '60s.

	Anyway, the rear gate is pretty thrashed, but the left and right 
side gates look like they just need some smoothing and painting. The 
original speedo was also still in it, although the rest of the cab was 
pretty thrashed. The engine is a late dual-port 1600, but I don't know 
if there are other rare bits in the suspension, underbody, etc.

	 The truck is at Pick-'n-Pull, on Monterey Road just south of 
Alma street in San Jose, CA. It's way in the back, with the other VW 
buses and American-made vans.I didn't have time, but somebody should 
save these rare Type 2 bits from the crusher!
