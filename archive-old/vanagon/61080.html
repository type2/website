Subject: Should I buy this Vanagon?

Hi Folks,
Am brand new to list and need some advice...

My wife and I are contemplating the purchase of a 1990 Westfalia with a
whole bunch of miles on it (133,000).  The car is super clean, one
owner,recipts for all service (which seems to have been done
religiously).  Slight oil leak from the drain plug, otherwise the engine
is really clean and it runs strong.  The asking price is $8950 which
seems like a bargain.

Not being at all familiar with water-cooled VWs I'm wondering if we
should be concerned about the mileage and especially with the head leak
problem.  Any transaxle concerns (it's a four speed).

Many thanks!

John
