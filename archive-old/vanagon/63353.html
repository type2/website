Subject:      Tach Speeds

Hi All,

A friend is helping me tune my '85 Westy and he made a recommendation last
night of which I'm curious if others share his opinion -- which is, that
the best highway speed for me to travel at is ~3,000 - 3,200 rpm.  Since
this is ~54 mph to 58mph on my vanagon I wasn't to happy to hear this... I
normally travel between 65 - 75 mph.  He says this is asking to shorten my
engine life.  Since I commute 50 freeway miles round trip a day this has
some importance.

Also, I'm curious if my tach is correct.  What are those of you out there
with a 1.9L waterboxer seeing as tack readings for these speeds?  Mine is:

mph     tach reading
---     ------------
50      2,800
54      3,000
70      3,650

Thanks mucho!
Ivan

p.s.,

- Those of you that have recommended replacing the Oxygen Sensor with the
$30 Bosch generic are absolutely right - it's very easy to do (coming from
me that's saying alot).

- I put all Bosch parts in - rotor and cap were mildly pitted - realized
recognizable performance boost.
