Subject: List split

I think the the split is a great idea, though I think it is interesting to
read about the splitties and loaves, I am in it for the bricks. But I think
that the split should start at 1980 so as to keep the Vanagons separate, I
know everybody has an idea of what they think is best so this is just my $.02
worth.
