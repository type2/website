I am looking for a vanagon for my younger brother.  He and i
have been sharing my 86', but now he is moving to connecticut
next week and wants one for himself.  I would appreciate any
info on vans in the charlottesville/northern
virginia/d.c/groton connecticut areas. I have checked the
classifieds, but nothing really good has turned up yet.  Thanks
sean for posting the dd.c. classifieds.  
Any help is appreciated.  
thanks in advance
seamus
