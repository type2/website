Subject: Re: Finally changing coolant on '88 - any tips?

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Well, after finally finading some Prestone Long Life coolant, I am
&gt; &gt; preparing to change it today.
&gt; 
&gt; Consider leaving some room for Redline Water Wetter. This will greatly
&gt; reduce corrosion and allow the coolant to transfer heat better. This
&gt; product breaks down the surface tension of water, allowing it to hug the
&gt; cylinder head walls much better, causing less eddys and turbulence and
&gt; therefore pitting and corrosion. I just bought some and will install
&gt; soon. Type Water Wetter in at Alta Vista and there are web pages on
&gt; this. As well there have been discussions on the list about this.

Thanks - I looked at this last year &amp; will pick some up next week. If 
I recall, it's a small bottle like ~1/2 quart, right? 
So far so good - I have loosened all but 2 of the bolts needed.
Presumably after draining the heads/engine loop, I will need to drain 
the radiator side of the system which is blocked by the thermostat, 
right? I am thinking of dropping one of the large hoses leading to 
the rad, just to the right of the trans - does this sound sensible?

Back to work... :)
