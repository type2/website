Subject: Has heat, but it smells

&gt;From: &quot;Casey, Tim&quot; &lt;tcasey_at_HDRINC.COM&gt;

&gt;Good subject title, heh?

Some people are so picky about their heat! :)

&gt;I assume that Bentley will show me how to replace the aux.
&gt;heater under the back seat, but what's up with the heat for
&gt;the front two seats (the heat coming out of the dash)?

A while back I looked at my Bentley to see about similar
work under the dash.  When the first step was to drill out
the breakaway bolts for the steering column, I figured it
would take something crucial for me to take that little
project on.  Good luck.

&gt;Also, today I noticed the top ventilation control lever (for
&gt;the windshield) does nothing, and feels like it is attached
&gt;to nothing.  Can anyone shed a little light on these for a
&gt;still-Bentley-less, slightly chilled list mate?

This at least should be easy.  All the cables can be traced
without too much trouble after you remove the plastic heater
core cover, fuse box bracket and glove compartment.  It may
be as simple as a clip missing at the end of the cable.
Northern Illinois isn't all that warm either!
