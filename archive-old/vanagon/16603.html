&gt; Markus Benne suggested we Ottawians get together for a Pizza and meet one
&gt; another.  Sounds good to me.  I&quot;m good for next Thursday and the SO and kid
&gt; will come.  Bells Corners ?  Just a suggestion as to where.  I'm in
&gt; Kinburn and that's not too bad of a ride for me.  The place should have
&gt; &quot;good&quot; draft beer, maybe &quot;East Side Marios&quot; ?  Whddaya say  you other
&gt; Ottawaian Vanagon Listers ?

 Frank and Markus: Grand idea. Good suggestion. Where is East Side's
in Bells Corners? (I come from the east end o' town). Also what time
shall we meet? After work?
