Well Shit...

I got that leak in my auxilary heater where the elbow from the
top hose goes into the core.  I'm not absolutely sure but there's
a white plug thingy a little smaller than a dime that came off when
I tried to turn it. :(  Now when I run the engine (actually my wife
ran it while I looked) this thing pees straight up like a baby boy
laying on it's back! ;P  Anyway.  What's the likelyhood of just
getting this plug thing with the seal all buy itself as opposed to
having to by a whole {aux. heater unit to fix this piece-o-shit 
weak link?   I know one of you posted something not too far back
that went over removing the core and stuff and I'm not at work
right now to check over my saved posts on disk.  Well?!? Awwww!
I'll just come in to work tomorrow and look my stuff over till 
I find it or look on Mosaic.  I'm just pissed right now cause I
don't have time for this shit! :[  Grrrrr!  Thanks for reading
my rant! ;)  

PS I hope this didn't hurt the heads with the excess air in the
system.  My thinking is probably not since it is the cold season.
Someone agree with me please!  ;(
