&gt;Well, um, first of all, I thought your list was great, however, because
&gt;I'm not a spokesman for Intel, it's probably best don't say anything else
&gt;about it other than if you have any questions about the Pentium Processor, 
&gt;you should direct them to Intel customer service.
&gt;
&gt;Sorry for the bland response,

Sorry, but I had to get that jab in there.

Jason was also annoyed that I sent it!  BTW _ did you ever find him?  He
has the same domain name as you do.  He is one of those kids they hire
for six months and then dump out in the cold!
