&gt;WHY THE HELL CAN'T PEOPLE BE HALF-WAY HONEST ABOUT RUST!!!!!!!!!!!!

people lie and distort the obvious-to-the-casual-observer facts because of
Money. period. it's the old paradox of which-side-of-the-fence-you're-on:
if you are selling, it's not so bad. if you're buying, it's terminal cancer.

but basically, i think it's the evil personality-distorting power of Filty
