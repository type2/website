Subject: FS:  '91 with wheelchair lift, SE Mich

Hi vanagoneers,

I've been unsubscribed for awhile (my '62 bus means I hang out
with the freezing, windblown, underpowered, rustbucket crowd rather
than the intermittent FI hiccup/headgasket leak crowd) but came
across this interesting ad in the Ann Arbor News:

VW Van '91, Wheel chair lift w/remote.  Excellent.  Low miles.  A/C.
$13,500. 313 482-9498.

Anyway, you now know all I do, call them not me, YMMV, etc.

happy busing!
