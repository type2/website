Subject: RE: $50 Engine


&gt;BTW, should I expect a '71 Beetle motor to bolt up nicely to my '71 bus
&gt;tranny?


Tranny, yes. But don't forget the rear engine mount, that bugs
and pre-68 busses don't have, but 68-71 busses do!

If the engine has three large bolt holes around the oil pump, at the
3 o'clock, 6 o'clock, and 9 o'clock positions, then you're all set.
Even if you have a blank metal boss there, you're still OK--  just
have to drill and tap it.

But if there's nothing there, then you may have to get one of the
little adapter plates that bolt to the oil pump cover, and provide
these mount points. Most VW shops have them.

Course, you could always sell that engine, and turn right around and
buy a busmount engine or universal-case engine...

Luck!
