Hi there, Wes.  Regarding tires, I have a '90 Syncro Westy and I have a set
of Yokohama LT195 75/14 Y370 tires.  I run them 43 psi front, 53 psi rear.
I experience no sway what so ever.  In fact, the van handles exceptionally
well.  I corner 30-40 km/h over the posted speeds around corners with no
squeal or sway.  The van handles impressively given its weight, and size.

Driving in winds is a challenge, especially on the prairies.  It definitely
is like driving a sail! Like you say, you drive with care.  Tailwinds
are OK though!

Thx.
Harry

 No answers here, only commiseration!  I've had very similar problems,
 even in less forceful winds, in my '91 Westy.  VERY nasty at times;
 indeed I think truly hazardous.  Have had to reduce speed to 40 MPH to
 accomodate the problem.

 Actually, this was the problem that prompted meto post the inquiry
 regarding tires a few weeks ago, but apparently (at least for me) the
 answer lies elsewhere (I'm running the, generally, highly regarded,
 reinforced Michelin MXL's _at_ 35/40 PSI).  The effect I experience is
 actually more like a ducking and bobbing, combined with lateral
 &quot;feinting&quot;  - sort of like a boxer - rather than pure lateral
 motion.  It's even a problem in nearly still wind conditions (though not
 so severe as to be hazardous - just annoying and tiring), when there's a
 lot of semi-trailer traffic ahead of me.  Sort of like the &quot;clear air
 turbulence problem caused by large jet's at airports.  The dealer claims
 this is normal!  Curiously, my '82 camper (w/o pop-top) handled much
 better - really not a problem at all.  Different tires too (Continentals
 _at_ about 40/50 PSI).  One tire shop suggested that it could be a tread
 pattern factor, rather than sidewall stiffness.  Claimed that the
 Michelin MXL's were naturally &quot;squirelly&quot;.  I'm also considering some
 suspension mod's, such as a sway bar, but don't expect that would do much
 for the ducking and bobbing effect.  Shocks, BTW, seem excellent (and of
 course this has been a problem since the vehicle was new).  I don't know
 what else to say, other than DRIVE CAREFULLY!
