&gt;&gt;&gt;however, i think the alternator or regulator is shot.  if you remove the
&gt;&gt;&gt;positive wire from the battery, engine dies right away. 
&gt;&gt;  =====================
&gt;&gt;Brandy:
&gt;&gt;Lifting the alternator lead to the battery when the engine is running is a
&gt;&gt;significant NO-NO !!!!!!!!  It can generate significant voltage spikes that

&gt;hmm, well i detatched the only cable from the positive battery post, i
&gt;assume this is the same thing (there is no wire directly from the
&gt;battery to the alternator). 

Yea Verily, it is the same, and potentially (sorry, no pun intended) very bad
behavior for things electrical and sensitive to overvoltatge (electronics).

 &gt;when i am in the middle of nowhere what
&gt;is a good way to see if my alternator is no longer working?  in the
&gt;bently manual it shows how to test an alternator, but i don't have an
&gt;ammeter, or a switch to isolate the battery or a variable resistance
&gt;doo-hickey.  is there anyway i can tell if my alternator is shot with
j&gt;ust a VOM.  

&gt;troubleshooting on the field so to speak is a slow process for me, man
&gt;of little (but growing:) knowledge, so any advice would be great.  
============================================
There is no real substitue for having the right tools of the proper capacity
to do the job.   If nothing else, to make the job significantly easier and
faster.  Having said that,&quot;if wishes were horses . . .&quot;   I now return to the
real world.

If you have a reasonably good VOM, you should be able to detect , in a gross
sense, whether or not the alternaor/regulator system is doing it's job.  

1)  Measure the voltage of the battery, preferably after it has sat 12-24 hrs
to let the &quot;surface charge&quot; bleed off.  It should be pretty much exactly at
12.6 volts if fully charged. (also how accurate/calibrated is your meter?)

2)  While monitoring the battery voltage, Start the engine and let it idle a
few minutes to stabilize with all possible electrical loads off.   The voltage
should dip as the starter turns the engine over, but no lower than about 10
volts or so and then bounce back to 12.6 volts.(assumes battery is in good
shape/capacity and fully charged)

3)  Measure the steady state voltage at the battery as accurately as possible
after the engine has been running,  immediatly after it starts, it should
bounce back to at least 12.6 volts on a fully charged battery if the engine
started with little cranking.  The voltage may rise above that to between 13.5
and 14.5 volts if&quot;
the charging system is doing it's job.  If it doesn't, you may have to &quot;blip&quot;
the throttle to make the alternator &quot;kick in&quot;.  If you do this and the voltage
still doesn't rise, that's the first sign that your charging system may have a
problem.

4)   Have some one turn on high beams, heater fans, etc to put as max load on
the electrical system as possible while you watch the voltage at the battery. 
A fully charged 12 volt car battery should be 12.6 volts after the &quot;surface
charge&quot; is bled off.  If the charging system is doing anything at all, you
should read between 13.5 and 14.5 volts &quot;no load&quot; as it &quot;carry's&quot; the added
loads.  It may drop a bit from the &quot;no load&quot;(excepting ignition system)
voltage as each item is turned on, but it should remain above 13 volts or so. 
If it stays at 12.6 or so, or never rises, or starts to drop below 12.6 that
as you turn on stuff, you have a pretty sure indication that the
alternator/regulator system isn't doing it's job.
