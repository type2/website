Subject: For all you Porsche engine wannabees...


Saw this in today's Denver Post.  Any questions you may have take up with 
the owner.  I may be able to meet him halfway for any serious buyers that 
want someone associated with the OBRS to help out by taking a look at it.
Keep in mind that oftentimes when someone says they have a Porsche engine 
it's from a 914, which was really just a VW engine.

72 Westfalia (SADIE), new clutch, strong porsche engine, good condition.
$1975.  (303)798-8829.
