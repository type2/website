Subject: Agony and Ecstacy

I misinterpeted the swift replacement of the 81 motor as ecstacy; it was just
a setup. No kidding, it went back in fairly easily with the assist of my son
acting mainly as an extra set of eyes. Hooked everything up , A to A, B to B,
etc, with no left over pieces and prepared to do the cranking bit to get the
oil up before actually firing it off. 

No start! the fuel pump pumped and there may have been a click at the
solenoid but I'm not sure, but no starter action in any event. The battery is
good and the starter is only a few months old with no slips prior to removing
the motor. Fooling around with the connections at the starter  with a wrench
told me real quick that there is power to the solenoid since I'd forgotten to
disconnect the battery. Then it was too dark to mess with it anymore tonight.

Any guidance would be appreciated here. Should I treat the problem strictly
as a starter problem or is there something downstream in the FI system that
would have an effect on the starter? I'm not clear what path Mr. Electricity
has to travel to get to the starter, my impression was that it was
independant of the brain etc. Working from memory, there are three sizable
wires with &quot;eyes&quot; connected to the post and two smaller wires duplexed to a
single spade fitting all on the solenoid. Am I missing anything? This is an
automatic; could mating up the trans and motor in some way &quot;seize&quot; the
starter? 

For the time being the neighborhood victory tour to return borrowed tools etc
is postponed again. Thanks in advance for any ideas.
