Subject: Re: Crashworthiness of Bug Vans 

&gt;   Here's an ominous note.  I recently bought my 1986 Vanagon from an
&gt;emergency room nurse.  Now that sounds positive - she wouldn't own one
&gt;if they're deathtraps or mobile leg removers.  Except here's the reason
&gt;she sold it:  She didn't want her kids (sons) driving it now that they're
&gt;of driving age.  She bought them a Volvo.

This stirs up some bitter memories for me.  My grandmother kept her 57 Coupe
de Ville in her barn since '68 because she had a scarey brake loss
experience with it.  It only had 30k miles on it and was just waiting for a
fix-n-drive.  She sold it in '82 for a pittance once I got my driver's
license. She knew I loved it and didn't want me to get hurt driving it.
Haven't spoken to grandma since... ;-)

&gt;   I've driven busses (now a vanagon) for maybe 150k miles over the 
&gt;last twenty years.  I drive much more defensively than most drivers,
&gt;especially where the front end is concerned:
&gt;   1)  Leave extra car-lengths between you and the car in front.
&gt;   2)  *NEVER* anticpate the car in front of you zooming through a
&gt;        yellow signal.  I did that once, and luckily had an empty lane.

And I can add: when rushing to a third shift job an hour away in snowy
weather, always anticipate deer crossing a desolate backroad when you turn
the next corner.  I didn't and a deer punched my '70 westy in the nose to
teach it a lesson.

&gt;   4) Stay awake.  The upright position of bus seats actually promotes
&gt;       good spinal position for blood-flow.  The bouncing helps to keep
&gt;       things moving.  

I drive sorta hunched forward toward the steering wheel.  I think I have a
secret desire to press my nose up against the windshield like a dog.  

&gt;       If you get sleepy, open a window or go take a nap
&gt;       in the back.  This way you won't hit a pole with your face.

I've tried that, but the bungee cords on the steering wheel keep slipping
and I have to rush back to the cab to stay on the road. :-)
