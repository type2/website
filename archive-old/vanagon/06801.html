This useful tool, commonly found in the range of 8 inches long. The
functioning of which is enjoyed by members of both sexes, is usually found
hung, dangling loosely, ready for instant action.  It boasts of a clump of
little hairy things at one end and a small hole at the other. In use, it is
quickly inserted, almost always willingly, sometimes slowly, sometimes
quickly, into a warm, fleshy, moist opening where it is thrust in and drawn
out again and again many times in succession, often quickly and accompanied
by squirming bodily movements.  Anyone found listening in will most surely
recognize the rhythmic, pulsing sound, resulting from the well lubricated
movements.  When finally withdrawn, it leaves behind a juicy, frothy,
sticky white substance, some of which will need cleaning from the outer
surfaces of the opening and some from its long glistening shaft.  After
everything is done and the flowing and cleansing liquids have ceased
emanating, it is returned to its freely hanging state of rest, ready for
yet another bit of action, hopefully reaching its bristling climax twice or
three times a day, but often much less.

As you may have already guessed, the answer to the riddle is none other
than your very
