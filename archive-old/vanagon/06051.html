&gt; Hi group-
&gt; I would be very curious (and appreciative) if people would post their 
&gt; fuel mileage they are getting with their various rigs out their.  It 
&gt; would give us all an idea of what to expect from different 
&gt; engines/configurations as we continue our search for that ultimate 
&gt; van.  It also is a good overall indicator of engine health. Those of you not bogged
&gt;  down in the U.S. nomenclature of *miles per gallon* are welcome to post km per
&gt;  liter or whatever you use.  We can figure it out -- it'll be our punishment for not 
&gt; going metric when we had the chance.
&gt; 

  My '74 carburated 1.8 liter (std. solexs, 130 main jets, 170 air correction)
  gets 24 mpg on road trips cruising around 60 mph. 17 - 18 mpg is typical 
  around town. 

  When I had my '72, (carbureted, 137.5 main jets, 155 air correction) it did
  21-22 mpg on road trips and also got around 17 in town.

  Both are westfalia campers with pop-tops and had manual transmissions. Final
  drive was a different ratio, I think. The '72 always sounded more busy at 
  freeway speeds.
