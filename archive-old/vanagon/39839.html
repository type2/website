Subject: Gas heater (not revisited)

 Hi y'all! Now, the automatic &quot;to the point&quot; matter:

 Has anyone had any business transactions with the firm stated below? Good,
bad, other? I would appreciate input in this matter.

 I am wanting to acquire a gas heater for a 1956 Microbus and would like to
know what type it had when the first owner got it and if it was a B2 (BN2?)
or a Stewart Warner. I am being asked $350 for a B2 unit basically new
(being put together as I type). The bus has a bracket under the dash in
front of the passenger side, and triangular holes where something holds the
unit.

 Any ideas, suggestions about price and type of unit are HIGHLY appreciated.
TIA.

 BTW, it seems like a home operation and by what I could gather, the
individual seems very knowledgeable about the heaters utilized. He asked for
a photo of the braket in order to tell me exactly the type of unit that the
vehicle had and should get.
