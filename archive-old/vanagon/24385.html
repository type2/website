OK, so I got ahold of the guy and it turns out:

* It's a '70, not a '71.
* It's got a Corvair engine in it. 
* &quot;Ran fine 2 years ago when I last ran it&quot;
* Body is said to be good. 

&quot;Now how much would you pay?&quot;

At this point, I'm thinking. This is actually the second week it's
been in the paper; he didn't think it would be selling soon. I'll
prolly take a look and then pass on it (and pass his # on), I dunno.
Apparently it's got the bus tranny, but with the ring gear flipped to
make it go backwards for the corvair engine.  Any feedback on how hard
that would be to undo?
