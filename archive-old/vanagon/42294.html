Subject: gas smell gone!

Hey all,
Well, I filled the tank today and drove around a bit and no more gas smell!
Knock on wood.  I hope it stays that way.  I'm gonna have to chalk that smell up
to leaky vent tube connections.  It seems like it was a vapor leak too, as I
didn't see any gasoline trails in the dust on the tank.

Sean
