Subject: Re: That &quot;OLD&quot; Hesitation AGAIN

VeeDubbers,
My Westy 86 started up again, yes indeed, its hesitating and missing once
again after a 3 week reprieve.
Things I have done to &quot;try&quot; to eliminate the problem
1.  The new harness on the air box...replaced
2.  Installed both difigant fuel sensors in the little black box
3.  Bought TWO, new ground straps and grounded both heads.
4.  Replaced the throttle switch.
5.  Took out the idle sensor and checked for corrosion,ect, ect .. None.
6.   Installed new fuel filter.

Should I anything else, any Ideas.
One thing of note, I did notice that  the ecu black box lid was broke and
there is not a good seal to it, it is a bit loose, so dirt and such can enter
into it. Could this be the problem.......... Maybe?

                            Help, this problem has never caused me to become
stranded, but I plan to drive down to Baja and I am not fully confident in my
Rig.

                           Any advice would be appreciated.

                            Thanks in advance
