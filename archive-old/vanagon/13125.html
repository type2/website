&gt;&gt; &gt; 2 TV VW sightings:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Did anyone else notice the nice split-window bus in &quot;Ruthless People&quot;?
&gt;&gt; I almost cried when they drove it through a wooden fence...
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;I saw a stupid Chuck Norris 'rescue the hostages' flick and the only
&gt;reason I was paying attention was there was a vanagon in an airport
&gt;scene where they're planning to raid the plane to free the hostages
&gt;and it falls apart.  Another hilarious scene is where Chuck and another
&gt;guy end up in this Christian Priest's (they're in Lebanon) bread-loaf
&gt;VW bus with a big cross on it.  It ends up being a chase/shoot-em-up
&gt;scene which was totally unreal.  Bullets flying everywhere.  Chuck
&gt;would've been dead in the first strafe(sp?).  He's in back shootin
&gt;out the back window being chased by jeeps and stuff.  I think the
&gt;bus would've rolled over at the first turn.  Oh, well, it was a
&gt;movie.
&gt;
hey, I was flippin' through the box the other night and saw this as well.
Don't VW buses have the engine in the back....oh, I gues this one had
bullet-proof plating behind the door because the back of this thing looked
like cross-drilled rotors after all the bullets.  Another thing, did you
see the way this van was banging over things?  I remeber the hard metal
deck over the engine of our '70 bus and if you anywhere on top of it over a
speed bump you banged yourself up good.  But good ol' Chuck can survive
this while going down steps, over curbs, around corners.  Guess I'm just to
wimpy...now I have a cushy bed in the back with the Westy!  Bruce
