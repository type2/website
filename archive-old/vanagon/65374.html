Subject:      Re: idle stabilizer

&gt; My idle stabilizer seems to have a hyperactive streak lately. The idle is
&gt; around 2000 rpm, somewhat intermittently.  When I disconnect the thing, it
&gt; idles just fine at 900 rpm.  Any suggestions?
Probably have to replace it. Same thing happened to my 87GL. Had to
replace it, now it purrs at 850 rpm. Don't ask about cold-idle w/AC
however!-Interesting oscillations!! Another story.
Replace it, there should be specs in the Bentley to confirm death of
idle stabilizer (Throttle Position Switch).
