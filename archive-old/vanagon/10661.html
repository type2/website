&gt;  I think the wider bus that Sami was referring to is the Vanagon / Brick 
&gt;  which was introduced in 1979 &lt;at least in the U.S.&gt; as a 1980 model. I 
&gt;  am also confused by year of production vs. model year. The 

I was referring to the late bus, not the brick. It IS very weird, and
doesn't seem to make much sense from the manifacturing technology point of
view. But I read it in the gopher archives, the file on year-to-year
technical changes. Didn't Joel write that up? (Joel, do you hear me?)
