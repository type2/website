&gt; Anyhow, I've made arrangement with a local sign company to scan the decal

&gt; which should adhere better.  They've done a lot of this for boats and 
&gt; other demanding outdoor fiberglass applications, with excellent results.  
&gt; Once they have the scan on disk, cost of cutting new letter sets should be 
&gt; pretty reasonable.  I intend to get a copy of the disk for archiving as 
&gt; well.  I'll keep you posted.

You crazy rich folks.  :)

Just get a roll of electrical tape and write:

\       /   ------   .----.   -------   .    ,
 \ /\ /     |___     (____       |       \  /
  &quot;  &quot;      |_____   ,____)      |         |
