Subject: driving my bus to and in B.C.

I'm heading out west next fall and will be working in the Rockies over 
the winter, probably at a ski resort.  Any suggestions on winter 
driving?  eg. should I invest in chains? if so...any good suggestions?

This may sound silly but...they *don't* use salt on the roads outside of 
Ontario and Quebec do they?  Salt = Rust...BAD!!!

Rust free...and looking to stay that way...
