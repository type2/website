  I will probably end up doing this myself too. Since there are other cars I
  can use and I usually ride my bicycle to work during the spring and summer
  I can spread the task out over a few months. I haven't rebuilt a VW engine
  in a long time and I've never done a type IV so the going will be slow. I've
  got that great book that David Schwarzw recommended - &quot;How to Rebuild your
  Air Cooled VW Engine&quot; and Bentley and Haynes and Clymer so I'm documented
  well enough, I think. I'm also curious to see what it is that failed, so
  I'd have to take it apart at least, and that's almost half the job, right?

  Thanks to everyone for all the help and advice.

&gt; I recently went through this myself.  
&gt; 
&gt; How much time have you got?  If you don't do this sort of thing everyday, 
&gt; it does take a bit of time to build up a motor.  I spent about $500.  It 
&gt; took a month of weekends to gather together all the bits, have the machine 
&gt; work done, and assemble the motor.  I learned a lot, but next time I'm 
&gt; not sure I'll want to spend all that time when I could just buy a motor, 
&gt; mount the tin, bolt it in, and go.  You can get perfectly acceptable long 
&gt; blocks around here for $500 -- I drove one for 10 years before this latest 
&gt; rebuild.
