Subject: Westy top whitener

This may be of some value to Westy owners, whose once white top is now a
dingy grey.  Over the holidays I tried a bottle of white Turtle Wax Color
Magic on the top, after thoroughly cleaning it with various household soaps
and a scrub brush.  The Color Magic has white pigment in it intended to
restore older paint.  I layed it on heavily with a damp terry cloth rag, to
the thoroughly dry top.  At first, it looked like it was having little
effect.  After three applications (used about one half the bottle on just
the sides, front &amp; back) and drying in the sun, the difference was
dramatic.  The pigment coats all the &quot;tiny little hairs&quot; of fiberglass.
&gt;From a distance it looks almost like new.  Can't tell yet how this will
weather, but since it is wax I think it should be OK.
