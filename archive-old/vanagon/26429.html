Re: Senator Jim Ellis,
I can guarantee that neither Rusty VanBondo nor Jim Ellis would survive the
public scrutiny of a political campaign. We both had too much fun and
excitement in our younger days. It is Rusty/Jim's goal to avoid being
mentioned in the Media. The only pleasing exception would be being
photographed by the Enquirer in an unexpected uncompromising &quot;situation&quot;
with Heather Locklear, or Jeanne Tripplehorn (or both!!). Probably &quot;driving&quot;
in Mike Hornbecker's early de-luxe bus. Oooh Rusty!! (Is that a 10mm socket
or what?) =)

&gt;Sure are a lot of Jim Ellis'es around. Here in San Diego, on Hwy 163,
&gt;I keep passing a sign saying &quot;Senator Jim Ellis Memorial Bridge&quot;. No,
&gt;there is neither Rust nor Bondo on the bridge, though an occasional Van.
&gt;
&gt;The dude gets around, doesn't he?
