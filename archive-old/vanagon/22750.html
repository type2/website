Subject: Lisa's vacation 


Hello All!
Back from our vacation. It was alot of fun, and had its up and downs. 
First, we headed off to Philadelphia, PA to visit my folks. Boy- can 
you say power! The new engine in the Westy had power to spare. We just
flew doe the Turnpike. Gosh, we could do the speed limit for a change!
And go up almost all of the grades at the speed limit. Boy that was 
fun! Had fun with my folks, then off to Moselem Springs, PA to visit 
friends. The Westy was doing just fine. In fact we slept in it while 
we were there, instead of camping out in their living room. Next stop,
Swiftwater, PA, to visit more friends. Had lots fun their too. It was 
prime blueberry season in the Poconos, and we ate blueberries till we 
couldn't eat any more. We picked some to take along, so we had 
blueberries on cereal for breakfast. Next on the agenda-Herkimer NY, 
to dig for Herkimer Diamonds. They are actually quartz crystals, and 
quite pretty. We did find some, and really enjoyed being &quot;rock hounds&quot;
for a day. Camped at a nice campground near the &quot;diamond mine&quot;. Next 
day we drove through the Adirondack mountains before we headed home.
The ride home was just fine until we got to PA. She started to make 
some intermittent valve noise. And we were so close to home! And then 
the intermittent noise became constant, loud, and we had to limp off 
at the last exit in PA. The Westy died in a truck stop. We had to 
spend our last night in the truck stop. Ohhhh rats!!! Next morning, a 
60 mile tow home. Major bummer!!!!! 1,500 miles on a rebuilt engine! 
So now she sits in the field, waiting to be looked at, so we can see 
if it's going to be &quot;our fault&quot; (overheated engine), or theirs. Bob 
is positive that one of the hydraulic lifters went bad. Oh well, it 
was a joy while it lasted. Now we have to diagnose the problem, and 
talk to the rebuilders in California. Sigh :-(.
