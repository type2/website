Subject: More HP Stories?

Hi y'all! I just got thru talking with my independent machanic that Derek
pointed me to. He asked me to find out what you other Synchro owners have
done to squeeze more HP out of your engines.
 
I've got an appointment with him next Thu nite to check out my exhaust sys
among other stuff on my 88 (non-Synchro) GL. Hopefully y'all will contribute
enuf stories to make him happy enuf to give me a one-time-good-deal. I'm
tired of getting my wallet raped every time I go to my dealer even tho they
do a good job...
 
joel...if you got some good stuff stashed somewhere, i'd appreciate if you
could email it to me since I don't have any ftp access yet.  btw, my 19 yr
old son is down by your way enjoying the South at Paris Is courtesy of the
USMC. He was born in Gulfport, MS anyway during one of my Biloxi blues
stints at Keesler AFB.
 
Which reminds me...I got to see Forrest Gump last Fri. It made me miss the
South where the pace is a least livable. I've toured one end of Dixie to the
other in my former 76 yellow brick road Camper...Joe
