Enough to bore you!!

&gt; How about SOLAR? Have you heard of REAL GOODS in Ukiah Ca. They have 
&gt; mild to wild solar kits. One of the mild ones is a stright forward 
&gt; battery charger system for an RV. The kit has everything but the 
&gt; battery. Best part of the whole deal is the fuel is free :-)
&gt; 
&gt; There number is 1-800-762-7325    
&gt; .
Photovoltaic's give juice w/o the engine running (well the solar engine 
has to be running:) ). I don't know about the rest of ya's, but I use 
alot of power while stationary! My trips usually are 3-14days in
length and tend to be direct en rout to incammunicado (nowhere) and the
ability to generate power w/o the motor is of great interest to me! Keep up
the discussion!!!
