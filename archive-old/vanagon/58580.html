&gt; Anybody know what happened to Sorin Bejenaru?  Several E-mails went
&gt;  unanswered, and now my last one was returned with a message that his
&gt;  mailbox was full.  I infer he hasn't picked up his mail in a while.

I know that he travels out of town alot.  I think usually to pick-up or
deliver Vanagons.  He probably just hasn't had a chance to get his mail
recently.
