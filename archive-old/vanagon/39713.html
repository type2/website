Subject: Vanagon Dimensions

Tried a direct reply to  Steve.Tokar_at_ucop_dot_edu  but it was returned with
&quot;illegal address&quot; so I am replying via the net and also sharing the info with
everyone else.

Length 179.9&quot;
Wheelbase 96.6&quot;
Width 76.2&quot;
Height, unloaded 77.2&quot;
Track, front and rear 61.8&quot;
ground Clearance loaded, 7.5&quot;
Storage Capacity (cu. ft.) 49.7/201.0

Regards
Harvey
