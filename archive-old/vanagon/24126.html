&gt; Hi all! Somebody called me today and offered me a Diesel 82 Westy, I pro
&gt; promised to him to go and see it on Monday. Is anybody out there who
&gt; could tell me anything about diesel Vanagons? The guy is asking $4,800.
&gt; Is that price worthy? Currently I own a 1978 Westy that is 95% original
&gt; and no complains. See ya later!

According to the NADA (Isn't that Spainish for nothing?)  A 1985 VW
Vanagon Camper is worth 4075-6800 &lt;that is low retail to high retail&gt; and
it says to &quot;deduct 50% of value for diesel engine&quot;

This seems like a rather steep asking price, I saw one go for $1200
