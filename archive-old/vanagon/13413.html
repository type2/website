&gt; i wrote yesterday and got lots of response.  i have since investigated the

&gt; the oil drippage seems to be coming from underneath it and slightly toward
&gt; the crankcase--pushrod sleeve seals perhaps?  i also do not think that it
&gt; is the oil cooler, as the leak seems to be ON the engine itself.

Sounds likely that it is the pushrod tube seals.
&gt; 
&gt; ps-if it is the pushrod sleeve seals, how easy are they to fix? (is engine

Nope, don't even have to remove the heads.  It is easily done in a couple
of hours.  Buy new seals (16 of them), remove the valve covers, remove
the rocker arm assemblies, and pop the tubes out through the holes in
the heads.  DON'T use any tools on the tubes - first try using rags.  Rags
should give you enough grip to pull them out, but if not, go ahead and
use the vise-grips on them, but buy and install new tubes also in that
case.  If you squeeze the tubes, they will probably leak from then on.
Clean everything real well, put the new seals on the tubes, and pop them
in.  Re-install the rocker arm assemblies and adjust the valves.  Top it
off with a new set of valve cover gaskets (cause they are just pennies each)
and you're done!  Oh, don't forget to install those little wire retainers -
make sure they are butting up hard against the lip of each pushrod tube.
And the concensus seems to be NOT to use any of that permatex silicon sealer
on the seals - they need to move around because of the thermal expansion
of the engine.
