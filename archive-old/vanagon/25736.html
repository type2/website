Wierdest ticket I ever got was in my first bug, back in '74.  I had 
mounted an extractor with a four-bolt muffler flange and some doofus 
stole it off the car right in the driveway (just the muffler).

Well, drove it to school sans muffler that morning (sounding 
righteous) and got a ticket.  Spent the afternoon finding out that no 
one sold a replacement four-bolt muffler, so bought a whole new SCAT 
setup.

Went to court a few days later, told my story to the judge, and he 
let me go for $2 court costs.
