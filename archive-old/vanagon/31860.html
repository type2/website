Subject: Re: Front disks '71 bus

&gt;with front rotors 0.4mm below spec wondering if anybody else has ever 
&gt;done this.  They are not below the 'usable' thickness.  I don't have 
&gt;the book in front of me but it said something like don't machine them 
&gt;below 12.0 and then don't run them after they get below 11.5.  If I am
&gt;to expect the worst, and I think I am, where is a good source for new 
&gt;rotors.  So far the only source I have has them for $75 each.

I bought new rotors from Mofoco (Milwaukee, Wisconsin) this summer.  The
ones I received were made in Germany and are distributed or made by
&quot;Zimmerman&quot; according to the label on the box.  They only cost $36 each
(about half the price of RMMW) and fit 71-72 buses.
