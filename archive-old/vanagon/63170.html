Subject:      Topic Numbers

Is there anyway to get back the Topic Numbers on
each of topics in the digest format of Vanagon List?
I have grown very dependent on them due to very high e-mail
volume here. I scanned Topics List made note of desired reading
Topic Numebers then was able to quickly move to that topic from
digest

Thanks Anthony
