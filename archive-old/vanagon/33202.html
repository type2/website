Subject: My idiot factor

I guess as long as we are all confessing:  When I was in the final 
stretch for my engine this August I was hurrying to put on the final 
bits.  I had already dropped one generator.  I guess that is 
idiot enough.  Luckily, I had two others.  This one didn't spin too 
well after talking to the concrete.  The pulley on the previous one 
had cracked when I was removing the fan belt.  I don't think I started
this crack, I finished it.  I had a junkyard replacement and a 
non-stock shearpin.  I had to 'machine' the pin to get it to fit the 
slot.  I was already shot and in a hurry.  I couldn't believe my luck 
at getting this thing to work.  I put it all together and pulled it 
down tight with the nut.  It was a tight fit because of my nonstock 
item.  Wow, it might just start tonight.  Wait, something looks funny.
Doh!  I put it on backwards.  It didn't really 'cost' me anything 
except time and a puller, which I needed someday anyway.

I think this would be an appropriate place to mention all of the idiot
moments that were avoided as a result of this list.  Tricks that 
allowed me to remove the engine and replace the fuel lines with little
more than a drip of gas on the ground have untold value to a novice 
mechanic.  The tips on the various potions that are designed make 
bolts move or not move are also valuable and hard to find in the 
manuals.  But we all know this.  We should all pass along these hard 
learned tips and procedures so that others might lower their idiot 
factor a tiny amount.  The most basic one, repeated from the idiot 
book itself, is take your time.  Only do the work when you feel like 
it.  A tired or bored mechanic is a bad one.  Though I can't remember 
the moments exactly I know that more than once I have returned to the 
garage in the morning only to spend the first hour redoing something 
that I did in a fit of delirium the night before.  Relax, don't worry,
have a homebrew...
