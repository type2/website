&gt; &gt; Still lusting after a DC/12v coffee-grinder &amp; blender, a scooter car,
&gt; &gt;  an isetta &amp; moped, and hot showers in a westphalia....
&gt; 
&gt; have you ever really SEEN an isetta up close???

Yeah, the junkyard where I bought my '66 Westy had a red Isetta sitting 
on top of a '70s Bus as well as a bunch of other odd euro stuff.
