Scott says :
&gt; I can tell you how to build one out of parts available at any pet store!
&gt; It works on the same principle as the hokah pipe.  and it uses a 20% 
&gt; alcohol mixture.  I plan to install one in my bus as soon as I get the 
&gt; chance.  I used one in my pinto and it did give me a little gas mileage 
&gt; but not much more.  It might help to cool an air cooled engine but I 
&gt; don't know.  I'll do up a drawing and post it somewhere appropriate.


I made one of these 'air stone aspirators' that bubbled air thru a 
water reservoir and sucked the humidified air into the engine.  had 
it on a Fiat 124 and a Volvo 1800.  hafta say it really didn't make 
any difference.  i don't think the quantity of moisture 
entering the combustion process was significant.  it was a fun 
project but not very worthwhile...

the units from Edelbrock and Spearco utilize a water pump and misting 
nozzle mounted in the air cleaner and pointed straight into the carb 
throat.  take note of David's warning with these and VW engines.
