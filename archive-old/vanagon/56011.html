Subject: Re: 2.0  Inline Engine in a 87 Vanagon!

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;  I saw a 87 Vanagon with a 2.0 inline engine installed in it.  I work on
&gt;VW's daily.
&gt; The shop I work for (Volks Cafe) has done a # of 1.8 gas engine
&gt;conversions in
&gt;Vanagons.  We try very hard to make the installs look as clean as
&gt;possible.  The
&gt;install of this 2.0 engine was a work of art!  A Air-box instead of early
&gt;injection as
&gt;we usually use.

Can we assume that these 1.8 and 2.0 engines are VW Golf/Jetta engines? If
not, what kind are they?  And are they using the G/J injection?


&gt; The tech told me that it was hard to get it slowed down!  He said it totally
&gt;overpowered the braking system .


That's a curious statement, was he trying to brake and accelerate at the
same time?  I've had no problems slowing any of my Vans down from 85+ mph.
Are they  going up to 100?


&gt;  The main reason that this van was being built was to offer a &quot;Kit&quot; to do
&gt;this
&gt;conversion.  The kit would be ALL the parts to convert a Gas or those who
&gt;have a
&gt;Diesel, and allready have the Oil pan Engine mount etc would onmly need
&gt;part of the
&gt;kit.
&gt;&gt;  I will be informed as soon as the &quot;KITS&quot; are ready to be sold.  I WILL
&gt;&gt;inform
&gt;everyone on the list as soon as I get the word.


What kind of time frame are we talking about?  Over or under 6 months?

&gt;
&gt;  I know how the 1.8 conversion feels to drive, I can't wait to feel this 2.0
&gt;conversion.

At some point do you think you could offer advice for those who wish to do
a conversion without the &quot;kit&quot; since you're already experienced?
