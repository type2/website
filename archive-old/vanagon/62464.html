Subject: 85 westi blowing fuse for frig/water pump

Hi All,

My '85 Westy is blowing the (top)fuse behind the drivers seat alot.  I
talked w/a guy at a local rv shop who said that running down the short
takes an average of 10 - 12 hours, which at their shop rate, was going to
get too expensive.  Is anyone out there aware of a common point where
shorts occur on this model, or have a suggested methodology for a more
efficient way to track this down?


Your advice much appreciated!

Thanks,
Ivan
