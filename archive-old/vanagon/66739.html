&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=3D#000000 size=3D2&gt;I've been a 'list lurker' for about =
6 months or=20
so and have seen many testimonials on the value of using the 'official =
VW' or=20
German oil filters. BUT I'd been successfully using ANYTHING that was =
listed as=20
a reasonable replacement for my Vanagons UNTIL today.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=3D#000000 size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=3D#000000 size=3D2&gt;I decided to have my local VW dealer =
change my=20
oil and filter since they had a price that was lower than the drive =
&lt;FONT=20
color=3D#000000&gt;through &lt;/FONT&gt;outlets.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=3D#000000 size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=3D#000000 size=3D2&gt;On the way home, which included a =
stretch of 60=20
mph beltway, I noticed that my temp gauge was well below where it would =
have=20
been yesterday!!&amp;nbsp; The only thing that had changed was the oil and=20
filter.&amp;nbsp; The oil was about the same as before (20W50 Valvoline) but =
the=20
filter was one of the 'approved ones'.&amp;nbsp; My temp &lt;FONT =
color=3D#000000&gt;gauge=20
&lt;/FONT&gt;set to the right of the LED - not something that I would have =
expected=20
before.&amp;nbsp; And I don't think that I've ever had temp =
problems.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=3D#000000 size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=3D#000000 size=3D2&gt;So I assume that the difference is =
the filter -=20
what gives?&amp;nbsp; What's in that thing?&amp;nbsp; I'm beginning to =
BELIEVE.&amp;nbsp; I=20
asked the service rep about it just out of &lt;FONT =
color=3D#000000&gt;curiosity=20
&lt;/FONT&gt;while the work was being done and he talked about multiple bypass =
systems=20
etc..&amp;nbsp; So do tell - What's so great about the official filter or =
was I=20
imagining things?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=3D#000000 size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;
