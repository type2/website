Subject: electrical nightmare

Hello everyone,
	Coming back from an early morning surfing session in Rhode Island, I 
the green (actually, it's yellow-orange now) light come on.  At the same time
I thought I heard a click.  Anyways, I pulled over, disconnected the wire
from the voltage regulator via John Muir, and continued on with about an hour
of driving.  Batteries were very weak after the trip, and I used it for a 
couple of short drives (It's my daily, my wife's is the Neon.)  I've replaced
the voltage regulator, but apparently got to it too late as one cell in one
of my batteries was fried and the armature in the generator was gone.  The
electrical system in my '65 ucrobus consists of a 6V flywheel (which i'm 
guessing means only a 6V starter will fit(?)) and a 12V '74 super beetle 
engine.  The six volt circuit comes directly off the first positive terminal
of the batteries hooked in series.  The 12V comes of the second positive 
terminal.  Since I am revamping the circuitry, is this an appropriate way
to run 6V and 12V circuits?  What's the BEST way?
