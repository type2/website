Subject: Sealing wax


Sealing wax is not the anachronism some might think.  In certain states and
commonwealths you still run into a legal reqirement for a 'sealed' document,
meaning literally sealed rather than one embossed.  They wrap the thing with
flat red binding tape and seal the package before witnesses, some of whom
then apply 'seals' or signature rings to the warm wax so any tampering will
be immediately evident.  And while the USPS doesn't like it, they will still
deliver sealed mail -- it's a Federal requirement.

Sealing wax also has a number of uses around the shop, providing a firm grip
for irregularly shaped objects yet allowing them to be freed with a sharp rap
or a bit of heat.

Most good stationers carry sticks of sealing wax and usually offer it in a
variety of colors besides the official 'Sealing Wax Red' familiar to
Volkswagen owners.
