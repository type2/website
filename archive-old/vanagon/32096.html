Ho boy!

I just finished negotiating the purchase of a new bus.

I am soon to be the proud owner of a Right Hand Drive 1954 23-Window Deluxe
bus!

Yippee!

I don't know what else to say....

Minuses:

Ok, so its rusty.  Good amount of rust on the bottom of the nose, lots
underneath and in the rockers.  Its going to need front floors, outriggers,
center sections, rockers and prolly various other pieces as well.  I get
some NOS sheet metal pieces as part of the deal.

Its missing the semaphores; it has these dealer-option jobbers instead.  I'll
put semaphores back in.

Its missing taillights and reflectors; not really too hard to find.

Has both bumpers; front is nice, rear is mangled.  Missing 1 piece of trim
for back bumper.

Missinf starter button

Only has 1 16&quot; wheel (spare)

Plusses:

Original motor, not running. (duh...)

Original headlights (they're different than normal)

No impact damage.

Complete jailbars, glass, handles, all the chrome stuff.  Original keys.

Has middle seat, although its technically not a barndoor seat, but it
does &quot;flop&quot; on the correct side.

Has gas tank w/cap, tire tray, battery cover w/strap.

has all the body trim except for the vent trim.

How much did I pay?  A lot.  Maybe too much.  But this is purported to be
the only RHD 23-window in the US...

I have pix, but I gotta get 'em scanned....
