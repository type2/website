.....does anyone have any experience with the fan that fits
in the tube from the back to the front which is supposed to
help get heat in to the poor little bus (pre-80)? I know you
people in the temperate zones (read cold) don't care, since 
the darn thing needs heat to begin with, but you people in
the sub-tropics (AZ, SoCal, AL, NSW???) -- have you had 
any contact or thoughts on this?
