Want to extend your range?  Go to your local Fixed Base Operator at
your local airport and get a &quot;range extender&quot;.....basically
its a plastic container....with a long rubber hose...and the
appropriate &quot;docking&quot; device - depending of course if you
are male or female!

Bathrooms???? We need no steenking bathrooms!!
