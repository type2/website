&gt;Hello Dennis.  One thing to remember regarding tires for the Syncro 
&gt;is not only load rating, but also tire pressure.  Most tires can't 
&gt;take the 43 psi front, 53 psi rear pressures.  This is imperitive for 
&gt;proper handling and weights.  IMHO, I wouldn't touch a tire for a 
&gt;Syncro that wasn't a load range D, and couldn't handle the 
&gt;recommended tire pressures by VW.

Understood.  That is why I recomend the increased size.  It does compensate.
 Also, many tire are now rated to be inflated to 44psi.  BTW, the factory
205-70/14 reinforced has a maximum inflation of 40 psi.
Dennis.
