Subject: Re: Kombi Problems!!!

&gt;I have a 72 Kombi.
&gt;
&gt;I put an 88 kit through it (barrels and pistons and new heads) what else
&gt;should be changed???
&gt;
&gt;I have a problem with rattles too.  I'm not sure if the tappets (//) need
&gt;adjusting or judt the timing.  Could it just be timing?  It was lacking
&gt;power, but I changed the position of the distributor to where I rememberd by
&gt;sight and it improved heaps.  I suppose I need a timing light to get it
&gt;exact, but was wondering if that could cause the rattling.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks in advance.

Dear Tracey,

There are many things that could be wrong here, but I think you should start
with a thorough valve train check.  Make sure all the pushrods are properly
seated in their followers within the engine and out at the rocker arms.
Then go over the valves again very carefully, check for seized, or loose
rockers, and anything else goofy.

Yes indeed, get a timing light, or at least a continuity tester so you can
set and know where it is, very important over the life of your engine.  Was
this a 1600 engine?  I thought '72 had a type IV.  If it was a 1600 you've
raised the compression on your engine (with the 88's) and should be using
premium and may need to retard your timing a pinch or something.  Us desktop
detectives need more information here.

Rattles don't sound like they have anything to do with, like a wobbly fan or
something?

Didn't forget something deep in the engine like piston pin keepers or
something, eh?

Shooting in the dark now,

Good luck,
Eugene
