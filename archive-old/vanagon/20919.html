Subject:  mpg  low, other advice?

here's a plea for some advice on where to start/what to start checking
out on my new vehicle:  i seem to be getting 17-18 mpg on the highway
(81 adventurewagen).  my roof is a little higher (hence wind resistance),
and i don't know if this is unreasonably low or ok.  i also see a little white
smoke while idling after cold start.  any advice on some basic stuff to
start checking out regarding this or anything else for a new transporter
owner?  i just need a little direction :~), where to start, etc.

mobius thanks you too,
matthew                                          goikem_at_state.mi_dot_us
