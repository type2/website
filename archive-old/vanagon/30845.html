Subject: looking for:


 ok, here's a good one:
 I would like to see if anyone out there has and
 would think of parting with a old beetle. i'd bee looking
 for something which rolls and has a floor, but doesn't
 have an engine.
 i have a killer engine and it's been sitting in my basement
 for quite a while, i've got the itch to put it into a body
 and mess around with it. I've haven't had an air cooled for
 a few months and i'm starting to suffer withdraw.

 i guess i'd be interested in almost anything air cooled
 that i could get cheap. bug,bus,what ever...
