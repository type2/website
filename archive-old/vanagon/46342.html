Y'all
I concur that one list is preferrable.  Only been here a week, but I 
have learned plenty.  A lot of waterbox stuff applies to my airbox, 
and it alerts me to what to look for in a waterbox (drool).
Besides airheads wouldn't get to read anything about Synchro
adventures since they would post to the waterhead list.
