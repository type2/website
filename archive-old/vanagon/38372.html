Subject: Re: Pre67 Sunroof Question

&gt; 
&gt; A sunroof was an option on any model except the single/double cabs and 
&gt; probably the ambulance.  Yes, you could get a panel with a sunroof.

A fellow I once new had a '67 sunroof westie.  This wasn't your average 
sunroof mind you--it had the normal fiberglass pop-top and a small almost 
bug-sized sliding canvas sunroof behind that.  He claimed to have 
the documentation that proved it was factory--one of 200.  It certainly 
looked that way.  If it was grafted in, it was extremely well done with 
none of the rough edges you'd expect from a professionally installed 
afterthought. 

Has anybody else ever heard of one of these? 

Tom
