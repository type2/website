Subject:      How to get your under 12 child a free VW

I found out today that Gerber lost a lawsuit because they advertised that
their food was all natural and when taken to court it came out that they
had used preservatives.

In the settlement Gerber Food is now responsible for giving every child
born between 1985 and 1997 (under the age of 12) a $500 Savings Bond.

All you have to do to receive it is to send a copy of your child's birth
certificate and social security card to:

GERBER FOOD
Settlement Administration
Infant Litigation
P.O. Box 1602
Minneapolis, MN 55480

Naturally, all of you will allow your child, when they reach the age of 16,
to use this Bond to purchase a VW and not waste it on something unimportant
like college.  :-)

Bye,
