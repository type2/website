Subject: My Apologies to the Vanagon List Members

To Chris,

I would like to formally extend my apology to you and all members of the
Vanagon List.

My base language and crude insults in my private (now public) email to
Chris, were impulsive, childish, and unnecessary. That form of
communication will not originate from me, again!

However, I cannot promise (due to my lack of background in restructuring
and repairing Vanagons, any automobile for that matter) that I will not,
on occasion, post dumb or redundant questions to the list.

Please accept my apology.

Sincerely,

Bryan Ellis
