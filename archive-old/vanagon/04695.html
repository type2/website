My Van (named the Vananagoon) let a lug bolt wiggle loose out of the rear 
drum, but the hub cap held on to it.  Luckily enough I reckognized the 
Bangity Bang Bang as the same note as when you drop a lug bolt into the 
hubcap when changing a rim, and realized the problem immeadiately.
I pulled over to fix the problem and to check the tightness of the other 
bolts (all 19...  I was beginning to doubt the ability of the local tire 
store.) and found them to be split about 50/50.  Half of them barely more 
than finger tight, the other half so tight that I had to slip a pipe 
(that I always carry in the back, just for this purpose... you might want 
to adopt this strategy) over the arm of my + wrench to get them to move.  
I am young and fairly strong... They should not have been that tight.

Anyway, My point is that I agree with you folks.  Always check the lug 
bolt/nut tightness after letting some shop touch your wheels.

I like to givr them 120-130 foot pounds,  this has always seemed to keep 
the bolts in in my experience (although some people suggest 160 'lbs for 
steel rims) what torque do others suggest?
