Subject: Modifying driver seat back angle

Hi,

Has anyone tried to modify the drivers seat in a Vanagon so
that it will recline back further than it normally does? I'll
probably try it soon - let me know if you want to know the 
outcome (like where I bought the replacement seat because I
couldn't get mine back together :) .

ps - The seat back isn't hitting the sink (yet)
