Subject: Re(2): Cruise control progress

Larry,

I recently had the rear diff lock repaired on my 86 Syncro, and the mechanic
found the vacuum from the engine barely sufficient to activate the pin in the
diff.  I guess the 2.1 L motor doesn't generate much vacuum.  Are there any
specs on what the vacuum should be?  I wouldn't want to use this to also pull a
cruise control mechanism.

Charles
