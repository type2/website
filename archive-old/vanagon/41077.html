Subject: Vanagon Parts Stores

 Volks,

 After being in the list for sometime, I have found plenty of parts stores
for the pre-80 vans, busses, etc. But, what I haven't seen are sources of
parts for the Vanagons except for, of course, VW dealerships and their
outrageous prices.

 Besides West Coast Metrics, which sells some parts, where do you
Vanagonites buy parts (Vanagons and Vanagon Westfalias)? Send e-mail direct
to me if you will. I highly appreciate the information.

 Thanks!
