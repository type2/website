Subject: Request to Change Language Petition
Date: Mon, 11 Sep 1995 13:15:29 GMT

&gt; Subject: Request to Change Language Petition
 
&gt; As a result of the plethora of responses from Rusty Van Bondo regarding
&gt; the use of languages other than the Vanagon Sanctioned Officially
&gt; Recognized Communication Standard of English, the following protocall
&gt; shall be effective immediately:
&gt; 
&gt; 1. Messages in english will be allowed as before
&gt; 
&gt; 2. If a language other than english is being used then a prefix code
&gt; must be placed at the beginning of each subject header, for example:
&gt;         [S] - Spanish
&gt;         [Fr] - French ...[F] cannot be used as it is already used
&gt;         as a designator for &quot;fun&quot;, and as we all know from high
&gt;         school/college, French is not fun.
&gt;         [GER] - German
&gt;         [RN] - Red Neck, especially that dialect prevalent in the
&gt;         Tusks are looser part of Allybammah...
&gt; 
&gt; 3. Should a list member request a translation of any message written
&gt; in non-english (ie: above), the original poster will be required to
&gt; provide a translation of the text in question for ALL of the above
&gt; heretofore previously recognized languages. The same will hold true
&gt; for posters of responses to non-english querries should someone request
&gt; a translation.
&gt; 
&gt; 4. Languages other than the heretofore previously recognized languages
&gt; may be added to the list as time goes on by a 2/3rds majority of
&gt; the then present list members voting. This vote can only be held on
&gt; the second Tuesday of each week assuming the individual(s) requesting
&gt; such a vote provide a &quot;Request to Change Language Petition&quot; in ALL
&gt; recognized languages (including English) to ALL list members exactly
&gt; 30 days prior to the vote.
&gt; 

Here in California, where everyone speaks Spanish and English, we
take exception to your new rules. They just aren't needed. Especially
since everyone knows that if you speak English, you can at least read
German, Dutch, and Swedish.  And if you speak Spanish, then Italian,
French, Portuguese, Romansch, and even Bulgarian are a knockoff, since
they are all bastardized forms of Latin. The only language that would
really cause anyone a problem is Red Neck, though I hear that it
might be related to English in some distant way.

Perhaps, since this is truly a world-wide VW Van forum, we should
adopt a totally non-partisan languge such as Esperanto. However, a
better choice would be to adopt a language that absolutely no one
speaks so that we would all be on equal footing. We hereby submit to
a vote of the members that all messages henceforth and hereafter be
written in Ancient Egyptian.  Furthermore, if any persons on the list
are alreay fluent in Ancient Egyptian, they shall be prohibited from
posting to the list until such a time that all members have reached
the same level of fluency in Ancient Egyptian.

We will post this message in the other required languages at some
future time, as time permits.
