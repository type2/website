I am seriously considering taking them to court. I had a wonderful vehicle up
to 30,000 miles ( I got an 83 with 140,000 running like an angel) until a bunch
of crooks and imbecils got a hold of it....Now I have a piece of shit VANAGON.

Have you driven a FORD lately?

   Do it! Get a lawyer, it'll be worth the money. Don't even consider
   being &quot;nice&quot; about it, go for the throat and do not stop until you've
   drained all the blood from the body. No quarter.
