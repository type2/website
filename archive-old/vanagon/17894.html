(to the tune of Manana (spanish for &quot;tomorrow&quot;))

&lt;chorus&gt;
Volkwagen, Volkswagen,
  Volkswagen is good enough for me!


I'm driving down the highway, and my window's open wide,
I'm letting all the bugs come in, so they can hitch a ride,
I'd like to roll my windows up, but there's one little thing:
I can't afford to get a bus with air conditioning!

&lt;chorus&gt;

My windshield, it is split in two, it makes a happy face,
And speed is something I don't need, I'll never win a race,
So everybody passes me, because I am so slow ...
But still I get there just the same, wherever that I go!

&lt;chorus&gt;

My friend, she bought a Vanagon, an older camper van,
So now she sleeps inside the bus, whenever that she can,
She made some silly curtains, from flannel that she'd found,
And wants to add a shower, too! I think she maybe drown!

&lt;chorus&gt;

Way down in california, down in San Diego land,
A fellow that I know has got a big old camper van.
It's full of stuff he's added on, and now he calls it &quot;Boat&quot;,
It's blue, that's true, and very tall, but I don't think it floats!

&lt;chrous&gt;
Way up in New York City, on Manhattan, by the way,
A fellow has a Syncro Bus, he loves to go and play
Way back out in the countryside, where just for fun and pranks,
He crashes over rocks and trees, just like those Army tanks!

&lt;chorus&gt;

Way out there in Montana, where the cattle mope along,
There are some silly fellows who still drive these Vanagons,
And one of them is Diesel-run, which leaks oil with such ease,
That now his neighbors call his bus &quot;The New Exxon Valdez!&quot;

&lt;chorus&gt;

Away down South, in Dixieland, where Haute Possum is fare,
A fellow with a Vanagon is really rather rare,
You cruise along the highways, but all you ever see,
Are Chevys, Fords, and Chryslers, and those silly Japanese!

&lt;chorus&gt;

There are so many others, I don't know where to start,
But they have all endeared themselves so closely to my heart,
And one day soon, I hope that I can travel all around,
So I can get free food and booze from all those silly clowns!

&lt;chorus&gt;
