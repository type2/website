Subject:       Wild Problem on '57!

Well fellow VWers!

I have the craziest problem on my '57!  I am experiencing what I have 
termed &quot;Unintended Four Wheel Steering.&quot; (with apologies to our 
friends at Audi.)

It seems that when I am in heavy traffic, cruising along in third 
gear, the phenomona is greatly manifest.

As I let off the gas pedal (clutch out still), and then give it gas 
again, it goes whacky.  As I let off the gas pedal, the rear 
passenger corner dives, and the rear moves to the right.  It is 
enough of a shift that I must correct by steering right.  When I 
again hit the gas, the rear corner jumps up, and it really shifts to 
the left. Enough to scare me the first couple times it happened.  I 
again have to correct by steering that direction.  We are talking a 
couple inch move to the left or right!

After paying attention to it, I notice the shift either direction in 
2nd gear, but oh so slightly.  In fourth when going ~55 and letting 
off and then re- engaging the gas, it does not to it.

If I am in 3rd gear, and let off of the gas, and engage the clutch at 
the same time, it doesn't do the swing to the left.

What in the world could cause this?  The only clue.  The local VW 
shop replaced an oil seal in the rear passanger gearbox.

What do you guys think?  (I was just positive my whole wheel was 
gonna fall off in the middle of the freeway the other day!  :-O )

Thanks for any suggestions.
