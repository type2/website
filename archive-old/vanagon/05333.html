Martha, 

I suggest you take it over to a boat yard and see how much they would 
want to sand and Gel-coat the thing.  Most boat yards do a thriving 
business in re-coating fiberglass boats that have blistered and have a 
great amount of experience in same. (and people gave up wooden boats 
because fiberglass requires no maintainance...)
