&gt;(is)the 10-12 mpg I am getting on a recently (1000 mi.) overhauled
&gt;engine is as pathetic as I think.


Yes, Yes, unless the overhaul was on the Oldsmobiile 454 cu-in V8 you fitted
in at sometime. Do you spend much time in 1st gear?  Sorry, this looks 
seriously high consumption, is the exhaust belching thick black smoke, from 
running rich?
Cols start circuit may be &quot;always on&quot;. Does the engine run normally 
otherwise, hill power, starting, top end etc? An over tight rebuild, 
tiightly fitted rings etc. would cause some drag, and extra heating too. 
More details please. You should DOUBLE that mileage figure!
