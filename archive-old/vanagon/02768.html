Subject: How to Remove '69 bus window

In response to Tim Maddox's stubborn bus window:

	I had the same exact thing happen to me this year (the weld 
between the window roller and window rusted out and window dropped 
down.).  I struggled with the window and roller mechanism for quite 
awhile.  There may be a way to get the window and roller mechanism 
out without removing the wing window; but it is fairly easy with 
the wing window out.  You can remove the wing window as described by Andy 
Erskine (I guess they call these quarterlights in the UK?).  After I 
removed the small screw in the upper window channel felt and one bolt down
below in the door the wing window still wouldn't come out.  So I removed 
the window scraper rubber (there is a long metal wire with protrusions in 
it that hold in the rubber) and sort of rotated the top of the wing 
window down and towards the rear.  After the wing window is out you can 
slide the window up past where the window scraper used to be.

Good luck
