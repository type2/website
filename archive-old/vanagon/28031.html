Subject: What kind of bus do I have?
Date: 03 Nov 1995 21:56:43 GMT

Topic No. 23


Explanations of bus serial numbers baffle me. Could someone offer their
wisdom on these numbers stamped on the bulkhead behind the front seat of my
bus.

 I thought I had a 221, but then yesterday I read that

&gt;the second number is the model -
     &gt;model  21 is the delivery van  (no windows on sides, no seats in &gt;back,
&gt;one tone paint)

This is the problem. I've got three windows behind the doors, seats, an
original two tone 
 paint, and headliner.

     &gt;model  22  is the Microbus  (headliner,  3 windows on sides,  &gt;interior
&gt;panels, rear and middle seats, two tone paint)
   
I'ld appriciate any comments or ideas about this.
