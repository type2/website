Subject: [Q]Syncro clutch

Hi folks, a question for those who have driven BOTH a Syncro and 'normal' 
vanagon.
 --&gt;  Is the clutch on the Syncro supposed to take thigh muscles like a 
Russian weightlifter to push in? (ah, Olga, is this politically correct?) My 
old '85 had a very easy clutch to push in, car like effort. The '87 Syncro 
clutch is like a truck, my ass comes off the seat (almost, it seems). Is 
this normal, ie beefier clutch plate springs in Syncro, or is something 
seriously wrong. I have thoroughly bled the system, it was really stiff this 
winter, likely water in the clutch fluid. That helped, but it's still twice 
as stiff as the 2WD vanagons was. Ideas?   tia,  tim s.
