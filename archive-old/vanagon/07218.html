Subject: Re: 911 conversion flywheel question ?

&gt;     Hi all,
&gt;     
&gt;     I know it's probably an old theme but does anyone know what flywheel I 
&gt;     should fit to a 911T to mate with a '74 bus tranny. I've heard of a 
&gt;     company called KEP in the states. Does anyone know KEPs' address ?

WASP have done a few 911 engine swaps, so they might be able to help (gonna 
be cheaper than shipping one over). They advertise in Volksworld sometimes 
so have a scour through your old issues. UVA used to sell a kit, but they 
are no longer in business and I don't know who, if anyone, bought them out.

Andy E.
