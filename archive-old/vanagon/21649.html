Subject: used dealer done good

In the continuing saga of our newly acquired '89, the dealer has had it
since Monday to look at the A/C that died on the way to consummate the
transaction.

The manager of the used car dept says that the service dept checked out the
A/C and found that the entire electrical setup (all of the A/C wiring) was
defective.  They are going to replace the *entire* factory air setup.
Wires, compressor, condensors, switches - all of it!  The manager must have
found a way to force VWoA to pay for the whole thing...

We are pleased.
