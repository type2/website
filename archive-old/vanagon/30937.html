Subject: Re: Cops buses and profiles

I was pulled over on the Interstate several weeks ago. I have three 
windows with stickers that may be interpreted as Dead Head. When the 
Trooper told me he pulled me over for going 78 in a 55 I told him 
there must be a mistake, this aircooled 2 liter can't go that fast!  
He asked very politely if I had anything illegal in the van and being 
satisfied with my answer just gave me a written warning and advised 
me to wait till I saw the 65 sign up the road before I put the hammer 
down again. This was in SC where the cops are not known for their 
progressive attitudes.
