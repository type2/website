Subject: Corvairs (urgh!)

	I owned a '67 Monza coupe and it was the worst handling car
I have every owned. It felt like a japanese pickup truck with a pallet
of bricks *behind* the rear axle- Of course, in the hands of a compentent
driver, this oversteer could be used to wonderful advantage in 
putting power down in curves... unless it killed you first. 

	And that belt-driven fan where the belt made 2 90 degree turns
OUT of the plane of rotation! I had belts last as little as 2 miles,
or as much as 9 months.

	But I'll admit the second series Corvairs were pretty from some
angles- BMW used substantially the same lines in the 3.0CSI and they're
BEAUTIFUL.

	Full credit to GM for that draw-bridge ramp on the Corvair
pickups- you still see them around silicon valley from time to time-
driven by gardeners. I wonder if they put VW engines in them so they
can find parts? :)

	Bill
