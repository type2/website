Subject: 2 quick questions...


question 1..I noticed that on the drive threw car washes at the gas 
stations have drive threw at your own risk for certain cars, one being a 
van type thing...will my bus be ok going threw, or are those designed for 
the average car, short and with a hood...just checking before I try it...

question 2..I want to paint my bus by myself(and with my friends) before my 
dad and I strip it down this summer and have it painted nicely...you 
know, just for fun..what kind of paint should I use, or will doing that screw up my chances of having a 
nice paint job later on..      Thanks   Dallas
