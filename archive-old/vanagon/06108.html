OK.  Here's for the '68, completely stock 1600 working its way to a
rebuild: 16 mpg knocking around, 18-19 on trips; for the '79, which is
a stock 2000 it's a steady 19 no matter what the driving.  Please ignore
the gibberish above.  We're having e-mail trouble again and I'm hooked
directly to the VAX--not even a little user friendly.
