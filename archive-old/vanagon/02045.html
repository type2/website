Subject: Re:  Conti tire pressure?

&gt;rear = 48 psi ??
&gt;
&gt;that sounds really high.
&gt;
&gt;Under no circumstances exceed max on sidewall.
&gt;
What you've just found is a classic VW cheap move. The tires that are MOUNTED
when you buy the vehicle will handle up to 55 psi. The &quot;identical&quot;
SPARE tire will only go to 40 psi. I did exactly what you were talking
about, mounted my spare, checked the pressure, then put it to 44psi
for a highway run.   100 miles later, thump thump thump KA-BLOOEY.
One new tire destroyed. The Conti's that are mounted have a slightly
different model number from the spare, something like R77 vs R771, not the 
sort of thing you notice at a glance. Heed the sidewall pressure!!!!!!!, put 
the spare up front also. I run at about 36-38psi all around, handles 
comfortably, reasonable ride harshness. The 44 psi was for a fully loaded 
'85 transporter on the highway.    tim s.
