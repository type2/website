&gt; As the sole (posting) member of the New Mexico bus-dudes/dudettes, I 
&gt; ask:  where (&amp;what) are the Chiricahuas?  
&gt; 
&gt; John K. Hopp
&gt; University of New Mexico (for whom I do not speak)
They are about halfway between Lordsburg NM and Douglas AZ
Famous for the rock formations and rugged terrain, this is
where Geronimo hid out from the US Calvalry. The peaks get
up to close to 10 000 feet. There is a small pay campground
in the National Monument, some more campgrounds in the National
Forest surrounding the NM, and ample good free &quot;throwdown&quot; 
(i.e. no facilities) areas in the NF.
