&gt; &gt; Well, I was flipping through the channels last eveing, and as the 
&gt; &gt; station hit TNN (ACK) I saw the coolest ad for a motorhome.  
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; It looks like Winnebago has created a really slick motorhome with the 
&gt; &gt; Eurovan's front end on it.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Has anyone seen or heard about this unit.  If it runs the stock EV 
&gt; &gt; engine it has got to be &gt;&gt;WAY&lt;&lt; underpowered!
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Pretty cool though!
&gt; 
&gt; Yup.  It's called the Rialta, and it's a pig.  Stock engine, horrible
&gt; ground clearance, unacceptably little interior space.  But, it's
&gt; relatively cheap (not much more than the Westy) and has a really trick
&gt; slide-out bathroom thingie.  Stop by your local RV dealer for a peek, I
&gt; did.  :)

 Someone who drives a '73 bus thinks something ELSE is underpowered?  has 
little interior space?  I checked one out.  I'm probably gonna buy one in 
a year or so.  Okay so I might wait until the V6 engine is in it.  BUT 
according to a guy who works at a VW dealer in Penn.  the Rialta IS NOT 
stock VW.  THe VW dealers can't work on them because Winnebago fiddles 
with them a bunch.  They even supposedly have a turbo version.  As happy 
as I am with the Eurovan and it PLENTY powerful engine I'm not too 
worried about the power.  The EV power is pretty good at the low end but 
for a vehicle its size it is almost AMAZING at the high end - its the 
transmission not the engine that could lead one to think there is a lack 
of power.

Drove many years in a '72 bus - pretty close in 'power' to a '73 I'd imagine.
Did they put a 1800 in the '73? not much more than a 1700...
