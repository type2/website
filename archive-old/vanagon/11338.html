So Sglw_at_aol_dot_com says:
&gt; I would like to go on march 24-26 but feel that I may be out of place with my
&gt; 70 westphalia that is terrible on the outside &amp; ok on the inside.
&gt;  Are all the people there in immaculate restored Kombis? or are there a few
&gt; buses that need external work like mine?

Oh cmon' Sam.  Waddya think we are?  A bunch of snobs?  We even let Bradley
show up in his '66 at Pfeiffer.  Turned out he was one of the smartest and
most helpful with all of the wood he brought.  (likes his prunes too! ;) )

So, of course, your welcome.  Maybe we can help ya with some advice and
such.  So get your butt down there and have a good time!

Cheers!

Steven
