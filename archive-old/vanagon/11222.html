Subject: Re:  extracting an impacted battery

Well the reason they call it 5-minute epoxy is so us kludge hounds can work
our magic in less time than it takes to get caught!  Seriously, try to 
epoxy a handle on if you are goin to scrap the battery or maybe drill and 
tap a hole into the post. Just some ideas off the cuff.
