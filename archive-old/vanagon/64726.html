Subject:      Fuel Pump

I read a posting on the list earlier that said noise from a fuel pump
usually does not mean it is bad.  Before I go further, I have an '82 Westy
diesel that has been converted to a '90 Fox gas engine.

I feel in this case noise may mean it is time to replace the pump.  The
last couple of days I've noticed a buzzing, grinding noise, and sure enough
vibration can be felt on the 3 components that seem to make up the fuel
pump.

To the untrained eye there seems to be a pump that takes gas from the tank,
then feeds into a condenser of some sort, that then feeds into a tin-can
looking thing, that finally feeds the fuel to the engine.  Is this a
Vanagon pump or a Fox pump?  Is the pump failing?  One of the other two
pieces?  Should all three be replaced as a unit?
