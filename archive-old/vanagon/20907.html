While I have the engine out of my bus I was thinking of rewiring some 
things in there.  The first set that comes to mind are the ones 
running from the generator up to the voltage regulator, which is in 
the front right of the engine compartmenet.  I was led to believe it 
should be directly on the generator.  Is this something to be 
concerned about?  Also, while I am rewiring I was wondering what gauge
I should use.  Some of those wires look very small.  I was thinking of
moving up to 12 or even 10 guage for most of them.  Somewhere in the 
dark recesses of my mind I took a physics class and seem to remember 
that bigger is better when it comes to wires.  Isn't the resistance 
related to the cross section of the wire?  I do have a soldering iron 
and heat shrink tubing so I hope to do this right and once.  Also, 
will the gods of wolfsburg haunt me if I don't replace each wire with 
the exact color?  Thanks, Jim

ps  Bob, nice story re Thom's brakes.  What was in that pipe you 
smoked on the road trip from hell?
