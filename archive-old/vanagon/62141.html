Hi all -
Been catching up on various threads on both T2 &amp; Vanagon lists.  Been 
outta town for a few days. One of the Vanagon threads involved tying 
down objects on the roof of a Westi.

Thought I'd pass on what I've done to ease this task to both lists.

In the industrial world they've essentially banned eye-bolts as 
lifting devices as improperly used they can break.  The proper 
replacement is a block of metal that swivels on it's attachment axis 
and has a U-bolt attached to it in a manner that lets the U-bolt flop 
around. (I don't know the proper term for this device).  

This gizmo allows the pull to be straight against the U-bolt, so no 
bending of the eye-bolt.

I have a '80 Westi.

I managed to find two of these neat devices somewhere in my 
yardsaleing surplussupplying junksearching travels.  I removed the 
front two screws holding the luggage rack onto the roof and with 
longer bolts attached the swivel gizmos there.  I now have a VERY 
convenient attach point for my front old style bumper mount bike 
rack strap, or for holding large objects onto the roof  like lumber, table 
tennis table, etc.

I've pulled on these gizmos a LOT and haven't seen any distortion in 
the fibreglass, so have confidence in them.

Keep your eyes peeled for these things.  Probably easily available in 
McMaster-Carr or similar industrial supply catalog, haven't had the 
need to look.

On the other hand, or rather end, (the following statement is 
intended to render '81 up Vanagon owners jealous) I just use the air 
intake to attach things to.  The metal crossbars are strong, a 
caribiner clips in nicely, and are at the right location.  The later 
Vanagons filled up this space with plastic.
