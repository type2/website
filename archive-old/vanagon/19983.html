Subject: Singe Battery ?
Date: Thu, 29 Jun 95 12:06:15 PDT

Good point.  Why do you suppose they didn't standardize a higher-voltage
battery (say, 24?  36?) for use in cars and things?  I suppose it was
because of the number of cells that would be needed for a singe battery.
Anyone know for sure?

Say, David, just what is it you wanted to singe?  For the average vole a small
panel would do just fine.  For singeing an entire ostrich you may have to employ
several tens of square meters of selenium or whatever to get the required joules
per second.
