I have a '71 Riviera conversion camper. A few years ago when my windshield
got cracked, I got a spare from a friend. He had cut out some letters and
glued them to some silver reflecting material and made a sun visor to go
across the top of his windshield. It said &quot;Westphalia&quot;. Lots of other VW
people teased him about it. He said he owned the West Philadelphia bus. Now
I have that windshield, complete with the sticker. The West Philadelphia bus
lives again. I think it gives my bus (Blushie) character, not that she
doesn't have enough on her own.
