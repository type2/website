Subject:      Cold start stalling

I would appreciate any thoughts on the following problem.  When starting
first thing in the day the idle keeps dropping off unless you rev the
engine.  After about 5 to 6 starts you can move forward but it boggs out to
almost a stall for about the first 1/8th mile.  I have tried giving it more
gas, less gas, putting it in neutral and &quot;clearing it out&quot;-nothing seems to
make any difference.  Once you get past the critical 1/th mile or so, it's
fine but not as much power pulling hills as before.  Even if you shut down
after driving awhile it will be a little rough starting up again.  The
longer you wait to start again, the more it happens.

If you have had the same problem and found a fix I would really appreciate
your help.

TIA
