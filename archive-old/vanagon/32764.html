Subject: Digifant fast idle???

Help.
I would like to create a 'fast idle' on my '87 for several reasons, 
increased heat output while stationary being one of them.  I can't 
figure out how to do this easily and safely.  Please do not suggest 
any sort of throttle lock as i have lived with those on Fiats.

The only thing i've figured so far is to short the leads going to the 
power steering switch.  This tells the idle stabilizer that there is 
a load on the engine and it increases the resting idle so it doesnt 
die.  BUT this netted me only about 200 rpm increase.  I would like to 
achieve about 1500-1800 rpm fast idle.  I know how to do it on the 
Digijet with its various throttle bypasses (ac, ps, warm-up 
regulator) but the digifant seems too locked up.

I guess i'm left with tying into a vacuum line, go thru an air 
solenoid, meter it with a needle valve, and re-enter the intake 
system prior to the air flow meter.  anything simpler??
