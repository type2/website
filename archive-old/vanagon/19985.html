&gt;Suppose further that you accidentally take the handle of a Craftsman wrench

&gt;The remaining blob of metal was cheerfully replaced at Sears, although they
&gt;had to trust our description of the original wrench.  My friend was lucky to
&gt;escape any injury!!

said story happened to short-circuit some brain cells of mine and remind me
of an incident in our army motorpool during my stint across the Big Placid
Pond ... a less-than-careful mechanic was messing with the dual batteries
on a 2.5 ton truck (deuce-and-a-half) that you always see carrying army
stuff around, and he somehow shorted the wrench he was using on the battery
... and he was left-handed, so his wedding ring was touching the wrench.
he lost the finger that the ring was on. :(

so be careful out there! and remove all rings,watches,etc. BEFORE working
around electricity!
