In a message dated 96-07-24 17:43:10 EDT, you write:

&gt;Dave, 
&gt;I have to correct you about the Weekender package.
&gt;It did come with a refrig and also a table.
&gt;And it didn't have a middle seat but instead 2(maybe 1) jumpseat(s)
&gt;Paul

Paul,
I'll have to correct your correction.  Many people use &quot;weekender&quot; for
different things, but VW used the term to describe the fold-down seat &amp;
cushion over the engine.  Dave's original description is correct.

Jim Davis
87 GL Syncro (in which the &quot;weekender package&quot; was an option)
88 GL Wolfsburg (in which the &quot;weekender package was standard equipment)
