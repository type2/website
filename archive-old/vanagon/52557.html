Over the long weekend proceeded to tear down and clean my 
distributor.  To recap, it is on a CA '80 Westi, with the Hall effect 
stuff in it.  Noticed a flat spot in acceleration.

Never was able to locate a distributor rebuild kit.  Tom &amp; Beth did 
pass on  the FLAPS name in the SF area, but mentioned that it was NOT 
for the Hall type, oh well.

Orientated rotor, pulled dist, made drawings of it and various parts, 
followed Haynes, took things apart down to removing the plate that 
holds the Hall stuff.  Haynes cautions not to go further.  I used 
carb cleaner on remainder and looked at results.  

Not pleased with remaining crud, proceeded to take apart weights, 
springs, and upper shaft components.  Again, made sketches of parts, 
expect forgot sketch of orientation of upper shaft to lower shaft.  
Could be assembled 180 degrees around.  Did partial assy and 
went back to bus and checked if rotor orientated correctly. Not.  
Took apart and re-arranged.  

The Hall thingy is held to shaft with a VERY small pin squeezed 
between shaft and plate.  Original? assy resulted in deformation of 
slot in shaft necessitating, re-removal, cleaning, and dressing of 
slot to allow pin to properly fit.

Re-assy entire unit and install.  BTW, per west, I used light sewing 
machine oil for all moving surfaces in upper shaft area, thanks.

Lower shaft felt tight, with no play, so didn't mess with it, just 
oiled with clean engine oil.

Installed, re-timed it, and off for a test drive.

Flat spot in acceleration GONE, successful weekend!
