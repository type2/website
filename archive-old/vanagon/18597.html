Subject: RE:Possible new group


A couple months ago, Derek posted an interesting article about the
lifetime of a mailing list. 

Sure enough, one of the predictions was that someone would 
try to split off a more specific group.  I guess this has happened
on other mailing lists.

I have a wasserboxer but I enjoy postings of any type regarding
VW transporters. 

Now nothing can stop this gentleman from creating another mailing list
but I don't see the need for it. Gerry's reconfiguring of the list
response *has* reduced the volume.

BTW, we haven't heard from Derek in a while, are you still out there?
