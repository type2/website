Subject: wtf: single cab panel

Hi there.

Just began my long search to modify yet another family member in my long
lineage of VW's.

I've currently got a '81 Kombi Transporter. Some freak, late for an
appointment, connected with the side of it and did a fair amount of
customizing to the sliding door.

This, of course, is just a fabulous accelerator for me to get to work
with torch and welder to simply turn the thing into the coveted
Pritschen-wagen that I've always wanted.

Is it possible to find the rear cab panel from a factory single-cab
pickup here in the U.S., or possible in western Canada (Victoria;
Surrey, etc.)?

If you know of, or can direct me to, I would appreciate it.

Thanks

Charlie Wood
