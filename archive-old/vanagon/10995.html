Subject: Re: advice needed-rebuilding engine

&gt;Over many years I have worked on bug, BMW and volvo engines. Each one I
&gt;repeated at least one more time and yet the job wasn't as successful as
&gt;I liked. The only satisfactory rebuild was the very first time of a bug
&gt;engine DONE BY MY MECHANICS!!! Sad sad sad!!!
&gt;
&gt;After so many unsuccessful effort, I learned a simple lesson. Replace
&gt;parts that need to be replaced and pay $$$$. Or the effort (of saving $$$$)
&gt;could be wasted.
&gt;
&gt;The biggest $$$$ item is the cylinder heads. People tend to try to salvage
&gt;them by rebuilding them. More likely they either fail to perform as you wished
&gt;or do not last long. The cylinder liner set (cylinders and pistons/rings) is
&gt;an item must be replaced. It is not cheap (except bug engines) but worth the
&gt;cost. If you can afford it, replacing cam/rocker/lifter completely to get up
&gt;to another 10 years of engine life is possible. Get a new oil pump or make
&gt;sure yours is reconditioned to get maximum pressure. 
&gt;
&gt;My mechanics has a fairly good reputation of rebuilding engines. His secret is
&gt;get everything replaced. You pay more and get a satisfactory rebuild.
&gt;
&gt;Flames (not to me) please as this is an interesting subject.

Well I must agree.  Over the christmas break, I talked with my dad about 
rebuilding VW engines.  He had told me that his motors lasted only 50-60k 
miles.  I was wondering why this is the case, and basically he only replaced 
the really bad parts.   He would reuse everything else, and I'm sure that 
many of these parts were borderline at best.  
        I had posted about the trip about cams earlier, but I had to replace 
mine, it was worn real bad.  The real problem with the engine that I'm 
rebuilding is that there is pieces of bearing material everywhere.  This has 
worn out the oil pump as well.
        The heads I have are cracked between the two exaust seats, and thus 
are junk.  I think it is good advice to replace your heads with new stuff.  
It just seems that a dropped seat or a swallowed valve is too much risk with 
all the other stuff which is heavily invested.  
There's my 2 cents.
