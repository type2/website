Subject: VIN No. on Single Cab
Date: Tue, 27 Feb 1996 20:17:50 -0800 (PST)

Well, I went to the DMV today to get the '64 Single Cab registered
and sure enough, they needed to see the vehicle.  Of course, the
phone droid I called earlier said I didn't have to have it there.
Glad the DMV hasn't changed much since my last visit. :[  So they
willingly took my money and printed up an official looking piece 
of paper and told me I had to have the truck weighed so they'd have
an accurate weight measurement and then they would have to check
to make sure the VIN no. I gave them from the paper work matched
the vehicle.  

So I'm looking all over the pickup for the VIN and can't find it
anywhere.  Does anyone know where I should be looking?

Thanks,

Steven
