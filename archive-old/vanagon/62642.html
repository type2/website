Subject: Re: Oil Consumption

Thats about how much oil I used on a couple of ~6k trips.  Very 
impressive for a such a small engine that has to do so much!  
BTW, how many miles on your engine?  Mine has 153k (original engine).

&gt; I haven't had to add oil yet unless I drained it out.

&gt; &gt; I have just returned from a 7,000 mile trip in my '84 westy.  It used
&gt; &gt; under a half quart of oil on the entire trip!  Does anyone else get this
&gt; &gt; kind of low oil consumption?  I have never heard of a car even comming
&gt; &gt; close before.
