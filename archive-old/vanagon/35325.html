&gt;I'm pretty sure the Vanagon was first introduced in '79 (but only in
&gt;Europe??) and I'm also pretty sure the figures you refer to are talking
&gt;about the Vanagon, not the last year of the breadloaf.

The (German) Baywindow production stopped in may '79, so the vanagon must
have started around then.
