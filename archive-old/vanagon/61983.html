Subject: RE: 80 - 83? GAS TANK REPAIRS [longish

Greetings Friends,
Regarding Ken Wyatt's comments on gas tanks :

Repairing Tanks :
&gt; I first went to a radiator shop to see about repair.  
&gt; They could do it butsaid no guarantee, it could last 
&gt; 30 days or a year.  =

VW : I just put in a new one, 
But on my boat (1972 Islander 30) I had to replace a tank,
buying a stock size, and getting a stainless steel
fabricator (did industrial and marine stuff) to weld in mods.
($60 I think)
Gas is serious stuff, I can see the &quot;no guarentee&quot;.  Either have
a welder do it, then pressure test it yourself, or go to a marine
welder. Marine fabricators do custom gas tanks all the time.

Price of Fuel Line Hose :
&gt; When they said is was $10.14 per foot ( not 1.014 but 10.14)  
&gt; all I could do was burst out laughing.  SO I BENT OVER AND 
&gt; BOUGHT 2 feet.  20 bucks for 2 feet of fuel line, sheesh!!!!! 

Not a VW only thing.  Again, boat experience.  I replaced all my lines
in the old boat.  The larger diameter fill and exhaust lines ran $12
and $16 a foot at &quot;West Marine&quot; (the super Pep Boys of boat hardware).
These gas lines do have a lot heavier construction, are chemically
resistant, and most importantly are tested and certified to USCG
standards. (Plus we are all probably paying Liability lawyers a ton
of $ per foot because they are guarenteed for use with gasoline.)
Price is for once reasonable compared to the open market.
Damn those lawyers!

Peace,
Mike
