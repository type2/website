DM&gt;Bell 47's w/ Lycomings are the &quot;MASH&quot; helo's with the steel tube tail struct
DM&gt;Hiller 12's look similar but have an aluminum monocoque tail and have
DM&gt;Franklin Engines.
DM&gt;both engines are 6 cyl vertical opposed.  flat/opposed engines are the norm
DM&gt;in general aviation aircraft.

Actually later Bells had covered frame tail struts as well giving a
monocoque appearance, this was the first chopper to really make
it due largely to the war as anything, and was in production for a
good long time, as aircraft go.
