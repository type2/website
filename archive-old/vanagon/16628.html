So Christopher Bridge says:
&gt; close.  I guess that the next things to do fix the shifter, and flush the 
&gt; engine.  Does anyone know about a product which _really_ cleans the engine 
&gt; from the inside?  Like some sort of motor flush?  

I wouldn't bother with those motor flush/snake-oil products.  It'll probably
do more harm than good.  I'd just get a 12-pack of the cheapest oil at
K-Mart/Walmart/Target and put in the oil and run it for 50 to 100 miles
then drain it and put in more of the cheap stuff and run it 300 to 500
miles and then after that, quite honestly, I'd keep using the cheap
stuff every 2,500 miles.  Especially since it's a used engine.  The
frequency of the oil change should keep the engine parts plenty clean.

Oh, and watch out for those synthetic oil advocates.  They'll steer you
wrong.  ;)
