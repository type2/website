Subject:       Wiring Closet Tip..

Hi Everyone.  For those of you with 1980-1991 Westfalias, my wife and 
I have found a more convenient way to more effeciently use the wiring 
closet.  I thought I could pass this on to the list.

The heavy cable that enables the van to be plugged in electrically is 
coiled up on the bottom of the closet.  It's a real pain to use as 
it's a real rats nest.  We have air conditioning, and thus no storage 
over the rear bench, so we thought real hard on this one!

If you open the first compartment from the top (next to the stove), 
and remove the shelf (it just pulls up), a hidden cavity will be 
exposed.  This is about 8&quot; or so wide,  and full depth of 
the cabinet.  The 110 volt wiring, and watertank connections will be 
in there as well.  The heavy cable actually originates from this 
cavity, and all we did was pull it back (trying to coil it up nice 
and neat).  We pulled the cable so that there is no slack in the cable 
at the black hookup box on the outside of the van.  The result is a 
nice fully usuable a closet.

The downside is for those that would like to plug in their vans.  I 
carry a 10 metre HD extension cord nicely coiled up and tucked under 
the linen closet in the back of the van for the times I need to plug in
to recharge my shaver!  With the van's wiring nice and tight under
the external door, when I hook up the extension cord, the door
becomes a rain shield for the electrical joint as well.

There's always room for more in a Westfalia.....

Harry.
