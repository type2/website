Subject: fridge problems

Thankyou to all who responded to my query on fridge pilot light going out
while driving.  I would say that about half of responders drive with propane on
and half with 12V.  My fridge is so hard to start on propane that I don't
want to restart it every time I stop!  I think I would like to take the fridge
out and let someone check it out.  Not too long ago someone posted his method
of taking the fridge out.  Would that person be so kind as to post it again or
send it to me directly?  Does the stove top have to come out?  How do you 
disconnect the vent pipes?

Thanks again.
