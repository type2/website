Subject: engine brake in



I am getting a GEX rebuild put in my Vanagon as we speak.. Is there a 
break in period that I should follow to ensure many happy miles?  HOw 
often should I change the oil when it is new??  I know Muir says he 
changed his every 50, 100, 250,etc... This seems excessive but if it will 
make my VW last forever I will do it.  Your help is much appreciated..  
Also does anyone have a passenger side mirror they would like to sell me? 
Mine has a crack in it and it will not stay in one place??

Thanks 

Jared
