Some possibilities, other than what your friend mentioned:

1.) Water in the gas. Can happen just from sitting ovenight a few times
in a damp climate. Get a bottle of gas line antifreeze (&quot;Heet&quot;, or &quot;STP
Gas Treatment&quot; or other brand, also called Gas Line Dryer) and pour it
in the tank. Cheap and easy-- try it.

2.) Water plus other sh*t in the gas-- maybe you got a tankful of
bad gas last time you filled up. I've heard good things on this list
about &quot;Techron&quot; from Chevron. If the Gas Line Antifreeze above doesn't
help, try some of that.

3.) Bad (or disassembled) carb float. I had this happen once on a '68
bug engine. Ever disassembled a carb? Now may be the time to start.

4.) Needs tune-up. This one's less likely, since a car needing an ignition
tune-up will usually run better hot than cold. Got a dwell meter? If your
points aren't brand new, a dwell meter is a better way to check them,
than Muir's static timing method. Also, anything leaking out of your coil?
It's oil-filled-- if it's leaking, then it's dead, or nearly so.

Free advice, and worth every penny...   :^)
