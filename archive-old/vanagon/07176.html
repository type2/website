&gt; well ... I'd be worse than merely poor for a while .... the blow-by is 
&gt; something I'll have to live with ... but Matthew, did you put a new 1.6 L
&gt; diesel in NuBus? 

For all you diesel fanatics...

 NuBus got an engine that had 44K SMOH (since major overhaul). It came
out of a diesel dasher...The total price for the swapout was
$1100 including tax...

 Now older and wiser, (and slightly wealthier), I may opt for buying
a rebuilt longblock from Recycled Inc., and pay the mechanic for the extra
time and materials to install..(I am on airplanes most of the time
and don't have time for the major project...).

  This engine is so small sizewise that I think I could manhandle it 
myself..(maybe wishful thinking)
