Subject: Portable CB

I was at FRY's yesterday and when wandering around I remembered the statement
in the Inuvik group that a CB radio was a good thing to have when travelling
as a 'convoy' tho I have yet to see a westie with 18 wheels!!  

So on an impulse I bought a hand held cigar lighter plug inable CB radio, I
says that it has 40 channels and I do not know what to doo with it. Do any
CCC's going on the 6/14 trip have one?? the trip there would be useful maybe
if anyone else had one.

do any of you CCC's have a CB who are going from the Bay area ??
