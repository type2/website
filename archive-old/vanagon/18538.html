Ric,
Gerr S. changed the default on the list server to save some bandwith.
This wayu, you intentionally have to post to the list by typing
the list  server's address.  He's hoping to cut down on 'unintentional'
messages sent to the whoile list but actually meant to another list member.

&gt;   Howcome the past day or so all of the vanagon posts are comming thru
&gt;   to me without the usual &quot;vanagon&quot; address, but the addresses of the
&gt;   original poster? Just curious...while sifting thru my list.
