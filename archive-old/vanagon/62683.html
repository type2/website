Subject: Atco (HOTco) NJ show this Sunday

Just a reminder that &quot;Punchbuggy '97&quot; (or whatever they call it) is this
Sunday at Atco Raceway in Atco, NJ  (Also known as HOTco, because of the
venue and the never-fail roasting weather there each year..)
Car show, swap meet, drags, queen contest (hopefully not a drag queen
contest, tho...)  bla, bla, bla..  the usual stuff, but only hotter.

So, bring your sunscreen and a bottle of your favorite thirst quencher (keep
that hard likker in a paper bag, tho..) 
And prepare to roast.
(and get sand in yer shoes..it's inevitable..)

Directions to Atco??  
look at a map, it's on there..  (barely)

watchout, tho...Vanagons have been known to melt in the parking lot...

other than that, it should be a good show...
