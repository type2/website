I followed all the advise, dumped the transmission oil and had the 
mechanic lube the linkage.  The shifting is now good, no hanging up 
in 3rd gear.  The Barrsleak sealed the seepage in the head gasket, 
all I need is to get the rattles out of the sink unit and the 
clicking in the speedometer cable and it will be like 
new.(temporarily)

Happy Holidays,
Sherwin
