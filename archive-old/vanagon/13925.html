Subject: RE: Do I have the wrong pressure plate?

Make sure you have the right throw-out bearing and the right pressure 
plate.  If you have a 70 transmission or earlier, you have no metal sleeve 
bolted over the shaft coming out of the transmission.  For 71 there is this 
sleeve.  The throwout bearings are different (can't recall what the 
difference is) on the sleeved vs the non sleeved shaft.

Also, you mentioned the two pressure plates--the diaphram type (many metal 
fingers) and the three finger type.  Well, either will do, but the main 
difference is--does your pressure plate have a metal ring at the end of 
the fingers or not?  If you have the sleeved shaft you will need the 
non-ring type pressure plate.  If you have the non-sleeved shaft then you 
will need the pressure plate with the ring.

If you buy the ring type diaphram type pressure plate and you get home and 
find you needed the one without the ring, all you have to do is carefully 
remove the ring (without damaging the fingers) and it will work

Hope this helps.
