Joseph,

About the only way you're going to get any satisfaction is to hire an 
attorney.  Usually a letter from them will get the insurance company 
to change their tune.  Don't expect them to deal straight up with you, 
it's their policy to try and take unfair advantage whenever possible.  
Make sure you ask for your rental car and attorney's fees as well.  If 
you write it up first it'll save money on liar's fees.

&gt; Okay, I'm not an attorney or anything, but isn't the mom responsible for

&gt; always jive with what courts see as responsibility. You'll get the minimum
&gt; from the insurance company until you present a really strong argument and
&gt; then they'll negotiate.
&gt; 
&gt; My opinions are my own. No legal expertise is implied.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks! Joe
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I had to pay my 500 dollar deductible (and the rental car--BTW, '95
&gt; &gt;Sunfires are not very impressive), as the other insurance company refused
&gt; &gt;to pay.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Why? Well, it seems that the owner's 14 year old daughter took Mom's keys
&gt; &gt;from an upstairs bedroom and went on a joyride with her 16 year old
&gt; &gt;unlicensed friend. Since said friend was the one who hit me (running away
&gt; &gt;frm the police in a car chase), he's responsible.The owner is not
&gt; &gt;responsible in any case--this was &quot;operating the car without the owner's
&gt; &gt;consent&quot; according to the insurance company.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Total bill was 2900 bucks, so my insurance did pay quite a bit (Allstate).
&gt; &gt;It just seems a lot for me to deal with for being asleep in my house. I
&gt; &gt;mean, I was not only not at fault, I wasn't even in the car!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Small claims court is the next step for me to recover my money.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;In the end, all I know is that I'm glad to have Kalypso back. Between the
&gt; &gt;accident and transmission. I hadn't driven the Westy for a month.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;It feels good.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Take Care,
&gt; &gt;Dave
