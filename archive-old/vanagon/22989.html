I think you just beat VWAG rec's for fording depths, 

up to 30cm: OK, just drive through slowly

30 to 40cm: stop and let the motor cool, check oil, spray ignition with 
electrical contact spray, drive through slowly. Stop on the other side and 
re-check the oil level for water uptake. Drain as required.

over 40cm: don't do it

since 40cm = 15-3/4&quot; I'd say you were over your limit! Way over, good work!
