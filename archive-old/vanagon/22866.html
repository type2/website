&gt;So Lisa Quinn says:
&gt;&gt; Hello All! Sorry, I didn't realize it was porper to introduce yourself
&gt;&gt; to the list, so here goes: I'm Lisa Quinn, from Novelty, Ohio. (East
&gt;&gt; of Cleveland OH). I'm a graphic artist. My husband is Bob Muehl, who
&gt;&gt; is an engineer. He tests big motors that are used on Navy ships. He's
&gt;&gt; a pretty good mechanic, who has taught me alot. I always wanted to be
&gt;&gt; able to take care of my car, and so I do. We are the sometimes proud
&gt;&gt; owner of a 1981 Vanagon L Westphalia Deluxe Camper. It has the stove
&gt;&gt; and refrigerator in it. It ran well until it's death at 144,441 miles.
&gt;&gt; And you all know well the saga of our engine replacement, and it's
&gt;&gt; untimely death at 1,500 miles. I am the previous proud owner of a
&gt;&gt; '66 Beetle, and a '68 Autostick Beetle. Both were daily drivers, and
&gt;&gt; done in by the Cleveland salt in the winter. Oh yes, forgot to say
&gt;&gt; that the Camper is brown. Thanks again for all your help.
&gt;&gt; Lisa

&gt;Proper to give an introduction!!???  My God!!! I'm REALLY late with
&gt;this one!!  ;))))


&gt;Hi there!!!

&gt;I'm (pronounced Am) Steven Johnson or &quot;Ratboy&quot; as Martha seems to
&gt;like to indicate.  I blame the name on Ric though.  It's from an
&gt;ooooolllllddd post about rats eatin' someones antifreeze coated
&gt;hoses.  That's okay, you'll see Ric and I make seeminly rude exchanges
&gt;occasionally, and that's the way we like it, so get over it. ;p

&gt;Anyway, I live in Sacramento and have a '91 Camper and my wife has
&gt;a '86 Sentra (don't blame the Sentra on me cause it's her choice!)
&gt;I joined this list when Unca Gerry got it goin' and was in the
&gt;previous list which took one hell of an effort to get on, but thanks
&gt;to Unca Joel, I was on that list for a few months until it lost its
&gt;gonads and went south.

&gt;You won't see me post as often as I used to because my latest job
&gt;requires oodles of attention and I can just bare skim the articles
&gt;and only do small posts like this one.

&gt;Speaking of etiquette, if you recieve help from someone, be sure to
&gt;thank them.  You don't have to do it publically, you can just email
&gt;them directly.  If you want to thank several people, then it's easier
&gt;to post it to the list.  I have no complaints in the being thanked
&gt;department, but just want you-all to be aware, just in case you don't
&gt;know.

&gt;I appreciate ALL the help from everyone that has helped me with my
&gt;VW problems and especially Gerry S. for making this bulletin board
&gt;possible.

&gt;Cheers!

&gt;Steven

Yikes...Should have done this long ago...

Great Idea Lisa! (applause is heard throughout) ;-)

My name is Victor Virreira, amongst other things, I work _at_ the
Centers For Disease Control and Prevention here in Atlanta - I help in
the National Immunization Program doing software development
stuff.  I'm also one of the music directors for the &quot;Greatest Radio Station
on Earth&quot; (a bit pompous huh? ;-) ) Georgia Tech's 91.1 FM WREK Atlanta
(BTW, we were the first radio station to broadcast our signal over the
 Internet - let me know If you'd like the client software that makes it
possible).  I am the proud owner of a 1984 Vanagon GL Westfalia
(Wolfsburg edition).  It currently has about 158,000 miles and it seems
to be running pretty well (operative word:seems).  I religiously (sometimes
literally) change the oil every 3,000 miles with synthetic Castrol Syntec 
5W-50.

This list is absolutely, positively, undeniably....without a doubt, 
unquestionably...
superbly, decidedly...killer! - Sort of like chatting or at least listening 
in to a
conversation held by people you respect and admire: intelligent, witty, 
funny. :-)
I'm happy to be a part of it!

My phone number _at_ home is 404.524.2209; work: 404.639.8580; fax: 
404.639.8615.
I live in Atlanta and would be happy to help if you're stuck in this here 
parts, etc...

Enjoy!
