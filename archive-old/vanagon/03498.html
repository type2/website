Hi, everyone

Someone last week asked about floormats, so here's my contribution to the 
search:

Lloyd Design Group
8435 Telfair Ave.
Sun Valley, CA  91352
(818)768-6001

For the Vanagons they make a 1,2, or 3 piece floormat set (I hear the 1 piece
is the one to get) for the front.  Depending on whether you have
the forward facing bench or the rear facing captains, there is a rear passenger
floormat set that will fit.  Lastly, they also make a mat to cover the rear
cargo area.

Now for the bad news:  They (Lloyd) only sell to VW dealers, repair shops,
and independent parts/service dealers, so you may have to search around for
these mats (or samples to look at).
