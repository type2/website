&gt; more on where umstead state park is?    christian
William B. Umstead State Park is off highway 70 (Glenwood Ave) in
raleigh N.C. There are 2 park entrances, one from 70, and one from I-40,
Do NOT take the I-40 entrance. Anyway, the family camping section is
just inside the park, th the right. It costs like $9.00 to stay there,
and is a really nice place. I do hope some people will drop in...
