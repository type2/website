Subject: Slipping clutch, rookie owner

Greetings:

I am a new VW van owner (1973) with a slipping clutch.  I have a couple 
of VW repair books and have been contemplating fixing the clutch myself.  
I have a couple of questions that some of you may be able to answer and 
make the job easier.

1.  Just because it is slipping does it need to be replaced?

2.  I am new to VW's and mechanics in general.  Is this too much to 
attempt on a first try or is it pretty simple if you follow the manual?  
I.E. is there potential to do more damage by installing a new one improperly?

3.  How much extra wear am I putting on the engine by drving it as is?  
Lots? None?

any input would be appreciated.  Thanks.

you can email me directly, or post to the net.
