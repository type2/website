Subject: Re: Winshield seal

&gt;&gt;always leak, especially windshield seals.  Having made window seals for=

&gt;Bugs and Buses since 1976, I learned this the hard way when the old/used=

&gt;seal looked in good shape to re-use.
&gt;

I've had the seal reused on several different windshield replacements, an=
d
they have NEVER leaked.  I guess some are luckier than others.

I reused a seal on a leaking window.  The leak was caused by rust
corrosion.  The window was removed and the seal area was cleaned, patched=

with replacement steel, etch primed, &amp; then primed.  It seems that the ke=

might be a smooth, intact surface where the rubber seal meets the body.
