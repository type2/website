&gt; Seems to me that NEATO published proprietary VW information.  Otherwise, for
&gt; anyone to publish any M-code should be public.  They aren't the same as Tech
&gt; articles, or any stories.  It wasn't a photocopy either. 
&gt; Of course I'm no lawyer, thank god (sorry Ric). 
&gt; 
&gt; What I'm getting at is that the M-codes are like engine codes.  It is 
&gt; information that has already been disseminated.  I hope Bosch doesn't 
&gt; take down the site with FI info just because it has part numbers and 
&gt; interchange references.

Oooh!  Good point!  Since VW published the M-Codes before NEATO, and NEATO
gleaned them from VW, then it seems NEATO really doesn't have a high 
horse to sit upon.  And NEATO is prolly in copyright infringement, since
they prolly didn't get VW's express permission, and did they attribute the
source when they published them?

Kudos Bradley!

I say bring the page back on line!  I thought it would be kinda kool to 
html-ize them, too, broken down by model, etc...
