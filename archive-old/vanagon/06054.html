Subject: RE: fuel mileage

bare naked 73 bus with 1600 upright *rebuilt*, manual trans.
Cleveland driving 	15.5-18 mpg
highway			20-23	mpg

last trip i topped previous record with a tank that averaged 24.3 mpg.

	noticed a very nice looking bus in cleveland last weekend (after
sspending 3 hhours on the highway and not seeing a single vintage vw..
needless to say i was kinda nutty when i saw it).  Nice paint job two tone
white and dark blue.  I'm guessing around 60's or so due to shortened size,
roof over windshield and two back hatches?  Beautifully restored including
some nice touches like white wall tires...mmmmmmmmmmmmm.
