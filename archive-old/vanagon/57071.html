Subject: Tan paste on inside of oil cap

I own a 81 Westy and was wondering if anyone knows the reason for the tan
paste that forms on the inside of my oil cap.  It seems to me I read
something bad about this years ago in Consumer Reports, in an article on how
to buy a used car, however, I don't remember what it said.  Is this a big
problem?  One more question.  Is the oil light supposed to come on when you
start the van in order to show it is working? I assume this is why the other
lights come on at start up.  Any responses would be appreciated.  Thanks
