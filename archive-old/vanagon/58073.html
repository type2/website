Subject: New VW Sharan Ad

Browsing a Brit magazine and saw a VW ad reminiscent of the older style
photo and one-liner.

It was a lime green jello model of a Sharan mini-van being set onto a
counter from the mould.  The mould was a nice looking pewter tin in the
shape of a splitty! It had a sliding door on the LHS and both upper and
lower engine air-ducts? No clever one liner though, Just the word Sharan and
VW logo.  Tim
