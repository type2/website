                    Kansas Interlude

The reason for personally delivering the Polys engine is a layer
cake of complexities some of which won't make a lot of sense.  So
I won't bore you with them.  But the two main reasons had to do
with proper engine cooling, and fabrication of a suitable exhaust
system.  Both tasks required locking me, the engine and the
Spyder chassis in a room for a number of days and we decided it
would be easier for me to come to Kansas City than to ship the
Spyder to California.  I spent twelve enjoyable days as the guest
of the Polys family while Bob Polys and I worked on the
modifications needed to add practicality to functionality.  Bob
and his wife Deborah are both engineers and they know their
stuff.  

The Porsche Spyder 550 was never a cool running machine, nor was
its push-rod 1500cc engine very powerful.  Our intention was to
insure the Polys Sypder would not only produce half again as much
horsepower as the original but would do so in a cool, controlled
manner.  

During my stay we worked out the design details needed to provide
better engine cooling without compromising the basic design.  Had
Professor Porsche lived a few years longer I've a hunch the
cooling problems with the original Spyder would of been solved,
possibly along the lines Bob Polys and I worked out although
surely in a more elegant fashion.  Our solution was based on
fabricating a completely sealed engine compartment, and playing
some aerodynamic tricks to insure proper flow of the exhausted
cooling air.  At the same time we tackled a host of small details
not addressed by the fellow who sells the engine-less replicar,
which in all other details sticks very close to the original.  

One of the tasks was to build an engine stand that reflected the
Spyder's mid-engine configuration, allowing us to work on the
exhaust system out of the vehicle as we altered the manifolding
so as to permit its convenient removal and installation, a detail
overlooked by the kit-car's designer.  The job called for a lot
of welding but the results justified the effort.  When we were
done we had a light tube-steel engine stand that could hold the
engine upright for test runs or inverted for use as a welding jig
on the convoluted exhaust pipe plumbing.  Bob Polys will probably
hang a few pictures of his creation on his web page should anyone
be interested.  We also designed and fabricated a load leveler
that allows the engine to be positioned properly for installation
in the extremely cramped space.

Once the engine was installed in the chassis we were able to
determine the optimum compartment arrangement, taking into
account the spare tire location and certain environmental and
practical-use factors not addressed by the kit-car's designer. 
To preserve the vehicle's power to weight ratio we used thin-wall
chrome-moly tubing to fabricate the necessary struts and braces. 
Over the coming months Bob Polys will complete the project by
doing the necessary composite work to marry the modifications to
the fiberglas body.

The Polys Spyder will be slighter heavier than the original
Spyder's 550 kilograms but will have a better power to weight
ratio thanks to a more powerful engine.  The Polys Spyder should
also run much cooler than the original, cool enough to serve as a
practical daily driver.
