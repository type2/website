Subject: Mounting Spare off of USA bumper on split

I want (need) to mount my spare on the front of the 1959
bus. I would rather not drill holes through its face, but
that may be how I end up doing this.  Has anyone done any
sort of mount using the bumper (I have the USA bumpers)?
I figure I can rig something up to mount on the bumper 
that will stick up and hold the spare on the nose.  

Ideas???

Thanks all...
