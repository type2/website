Subject: Re: Urgent to Derek (Part II)

Hi again Derek:
I live in Puerto Rico, and ready to pay for the cost of shipping. I think
that if the seat is packed in a box and taked to the next post office is
the cheapest way to send it. I know , probably you think that I'm nuts
to expect that a person in San Francisco wiill send this stuff down to
San Juan, PR but is almost impossible to find it here, so please don't 
send me to hell.
Let me know the cost of shipment and I'll send a money order to cover it,
please include your physical address in the next message.
