Subject: Exhaust Question


Hello all,
	I just purchased a used exhaust system form a junkyard to go onto
the rebuilt engine that I bought(yea!) for $2077(ouch!) from VW.  However,
the exhaust system that I bought is off of an '86 Syncro.  I know that the
frot header pipe is different on a Syncro and that a normal front header
pipe will not fit it.  But will a Syncro's front header pipe fit onto a
normal Vanagon?  Are there any other differences?  TIA

Cory
'86 Westfalia (non-Syncro)
