Subject: Prizes in the Stupid Question Contest

Well, first prize goes to Michael Heron for figuring out that I hadn't found the 
air hose to pressurize the reservoir (I was too busy trying to figure out how I 
was going to get air throught the cap -- it really does look like it has a 
valve-type-of-deal on it).  Second prize goes to Joel Walker.

You see my first bus didn't even HAVE a reservoir and when I bought Lief a few 
months ago his was full and pressurized (and Mother Nature was doing such a good 
job that I didn't even need it) so this was my first oppurtunity to figure out how 
to pressurize it.

So the next time anyone sees a question from me that has &quot;stupid&quot; in the header, 
make sure you don't say to yourself &quot;there's no way he doesn't know that .... so 
I'll skip to the next step in the diagnostic process...&quot;

Thanx to all who replied.
