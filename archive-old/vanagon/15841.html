&gt;I've noticed a few Vanagon GL's around town that have nice looking
&gt;factory alloys, metallic paint and lotsa ground clearance (not Syncros).
&gt;At what year did VW lower the suspension on these wedges and when did
&gt;they start offering the five hole alloy wheels?  Thanks in advance.

the lowered suspension became standard on the GL models in 1988. prior to
that, it was &quot;available&quot; on the Wolfsburg Limited Edition models, along
with the fibreglas Zero-MPH Bumpers. :)  the alloy wheels showed up in
about 1985, i think, on the Wolfsburg WLE models. after 1988, certain
&quot;packages&quot; were available on the GL's and one of those was the alloy wheels
and fatter tires. most of the buses with the alloys were automatics, but i
don't know why. they also were loaded down with the power window/locks/mirrors
stuff as well.
