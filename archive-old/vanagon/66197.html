Subject:      Qualitative Thoughts on H2o Vanagons

Hi All,

This is not technical in nature, but I thought I'd share some thoughts on
H2o Vanagons I have had lately.  Several years I categorized H2o Vanagons
as an expensive sideline to my interest in VWs.  After joining the Vanagon
list and learning more about them, I eventually ended up buying one and
then a few more and so-on and so-forth.  Now I have four, 2 86 Syncros, an
84 automatic and an 82 Diesel.  In June I bought an 89 Fox and stripped
it out to obtain a 1.8 motor for a diesel-Vanagon type of swap.  In August
I bought a neglected 86 GTI for yet another Diesel Vanagon-type swap.
It turned out that the GTI made a good driver after some minor repairs so,
except for a trip to Buses by the Arch, I have been zipping around in the
GTI rather than driving Vanagon on a daily basis.  Last night I went out
and sat in my blue 86 Syncro GL which has only been storing extra GTI
parts since I returned from BBTA a month ago.  I started it up, turned the
lights on and sat in it for a while.  What a Sensation!  After driving the
gokart-like GTI for that last 6 weeks or so it really felt good to sit up
high and hear the purring wasser motor faithfully start and humm quietly
in back.  I guess I'll clean it out and start driving ole blue again.  8-)
