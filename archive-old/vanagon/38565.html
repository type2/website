Subject: FS dual 40mm Webers

We have a set of dual 40mm Weber DCNF carbs and would like to trade for dual 40mm Weber 
IDF's.  If someone has the linkage and manifold for a type 4 engine that goes with the 
DCNF's we'll buy them from you.  We'll also sell the DCNF's if we can't use them on our 
engine. Make an offer if you want them.
