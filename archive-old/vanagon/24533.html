Subject: change of seasons,  tighten those clamps

Amazing!!!

I got the same puddle, but I did not check for the clamps.  I thought
that maybe something had overflowed mysteriously (???).  The coolant
level was still wuite OK, and the flashing LED did not happen.

(it did puzzle me to see that the car 'bled' overnight instead of
after a drive)

 &gt; ooofta!  the temperature here in the northeast dropped into the upper 
 &gt; thirties last night....I went out to check the coolant level before starting
 &gt; as usual and lo-and-behold it had dropped ten millimeters overnight.  No 
 &gt; real big deal...then when I looked 'neath the westy there was a little 
 &gt; puddle below those rear heater xtions I replaced in July.  Wouldn't you
 &gt; know all those hose clamps were considerably looser than in July.  Now
 &gt; I beleave we have added yet another step to the seasonal protocol for
 &gt; all wasserboxer owners in the lands of seasonal temp changes.
