Subject: We are finally on the road!

Hi folks!

After three months we finally got our 85 Vanagon running.  The reason was to
replace the water pump.  Now running on its third pump!

This is what we did during that time period:

1.  New water pump and thermostat installed with the smaller hoses replaced.
    Yes, we did the complex bleeding procedures.  Hey, this is also done
    on Ferraris so it can't be that bad!
2.  New a/c compressor with hoses.  We still need to get it charged up.
    My father is hoping he can get it done by a firm that works on 
    refrigeration equipment instead of the local service stations.
3.  Had the alternator rebuilt while we were at it.
4.  New Ansa muffler and tail pipe.  Can't believe how quiet it is.
5.  Did a complete tune up.  Runs much smoother than before working on it.

We are pleased how everything turned out.  Also, we replaced the clutch
last November.  It took us just six hours to do that (we could have done it
in less time but we had other things going.)   With the brakes and the shocks
done last year also, we have a &quot;new&quot; car for a while.
