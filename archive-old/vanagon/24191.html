    The most dangerous part of any car is the nut behind the
    wheel... so what if a Thing wouldn't have flipped if the
    CG was an inch lower? That doesn't sound like glaring
    design stupidity on VW's part... life ain't Disneyland,
    things hurt, accidents happen, it hurts, there's blood,
    it's miserable... try and be safe, that's about the best
    you can do and reasonably expect...
