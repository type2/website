Subject: gulf 87 gas

Just came off the parkway with the 87 gulf and the oil light and 
buzzer sounded. I had the same problem with the vanagon it was the 
oil pressure switch. I just had the oil changed and he talked me 
into 10/30 for the summer, could this cause the problem. The oil 
was to level.
