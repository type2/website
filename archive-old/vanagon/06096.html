I was curious about about adding a front air dam/skirt to an air cooled
vanagon (JC Whitney has them only for wasserboxers). Would this front air
dam in any way effect the cooling properties of the engine? I know that
the bulk of the air is taken in from above and ejected from below, but
maybe there are some hidden effects on the air pressure below....
