Subject: Re: Bike Rack for a Bus

&gt;A pretty neat set up I've seen amounts to what would (essentially) be a
&gt;Yakima rack mounted vertically on the rear hatch (I think this application
&gt;is more appropriate for a Vanagon), such that the bikes would mount
&gt;vertically from the rack (forks clamped near the roof, rear wheels resting
&gt;near the bumper, with the saddle extending 30-40&quot; away from the plane of the
&gt;hatch.  I believe this set up requires use of the mounting clamps normally 
&gt;used
&gt;with vehicles with aircraft-style doors because of the footpads that you &gt;want
&gt;to have resting against the hatch and sheetmetal.
&gt;I hope this helps.  Like joel said, &quot;Good luck&quot;...
&gt;Norman
&gt;ps-I like this set up because you don't have to be an NBA center to stick the
&gt;damn bikes on the rack....heck, I have enough trouble washing/waxing the
&gt;roof!....
&gt;
&gt;


I have a Yakima on my little Japanese Chevrolet (Nova).  Great rack, I agree 
with the NBA center comment for the Vanagon.  For the rear hatch I would be 
very careful since the Yakima aircraft style mounts are load limited to 
about 100 pounds and are designed for the car top aero-loads.  I venture 
that the shock loads of a good bump reacting through a center of mass 15 to 
20 inches from the hatch might well exceed the continuous aero loads and the 
structural capability of the attachments.  The hatch or its frame might also 
yield.  Better think this one out.

P.S. If it works it would also make a heck of a good ski and general purpose 
rack but...
