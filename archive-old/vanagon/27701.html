The rear table on my 84 Westy keeps swinging out and smashing back into
the trim panel which is now cracked and getting worse.  It does this however
tightly I screw the clamp.  I have tried putting a rubber bumber strip
on the table and also taping the table mount to increase friction but 
neither
has helped.  I can't be the only one with this problem and someone must have
come up with a clever solution?


     Hi! - how about a bungee cord tied around the leather loop
     above the table.  Pull the end not tied to the leather loop and
     put it around the corner of the table...It works!
