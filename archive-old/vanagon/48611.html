Subject: VW Sharan Screen Saver 

Hey all!

I received a zipped win95 screen saver that has some animated shots of a VW 
Sharan? Any one know what this is all about? A buddy of mine found it on a 
German game site -- FWIW the whole thing, setup, text, etc., is in German. If 
any one would like to take a look at it I've posted it on my web site. It's 
421K.
