Subject: Gas Shocks - HAZMAT?????

FROM THE US DEPT OF RED TAPE, ETC.

Well folks, they're stickin' it to us again.  We have a notice from KYB that
all Gas Shocks being shipped have to have &quot;Hazardous Materials&quot; Stickers on
the box, they have to shipped in boxes separate from other stuff we ship and
they can no longer be shipped by air (UPS Red, Blue, 3 Day, Waybill, etc.).
 In addition, there's a $10 charge over and above the regular shipping
charges to do this and we gotta fill out special forms to ship these.
 AAAAAARRRRRGGGGGHHHHH - what a hassle :(

This is due to a US DOT decision to re-classify all Gas Charged Shock
Absorbers as &quot;Hazardous Materials&quot; effective August 1, 1995.

It hits the FLAPS everytime they order - but it hits guys like us in the
MailOrder biz with a doublewhammy of paying the charge when we order and
again when we ship to customers like you folks.

Awright - git offa yer butts and crank up the E-Mail to our so-called
people's government and let 'em know what ya think about this fine kettle o'
fish we're stuck with.  It ain't UPS' fault, so don't go complainin' to them.
