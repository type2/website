Subject: Re: [F]Re: JBrill Return Message

&gt;Can someone please confirm if these bounced messages also made it to
&gt;the list in the normal form?  I would hate to read them all but, if I
&gt;thought there was something I was missing, I would.  Since the subject
&gt;line has the [f] mark I will tell a short story.  They drained or
&gt;flushed the hot water pipes on campus here this week.  From the
&gt;newspaper it sounds a little like bleeding a Vanagon coolant system.
&gt;Anyways, they forgot to close a few valves before they cranked things
&gt;back up.  $100,000 damage to one building alone.  The other one they
&gt;haven't gotten into yet until they are sure about asbestos, etc.  It
&gt;is the one that most of the net stuff and mainframes on campus.  That
&gt;is why I was off line part of yesterday.  :(

OK.  Now it's out.  Your guys knocked off most Internet access for
Nebraska, Iowa, No. &amp; So. Dakota, Kansas, and I believe Wyoming for a good
share of the day yesterday.  Yowza!
