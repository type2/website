&gt;As I continue to look for the best deal on the best engine to put into 
&gt;my
&gt;'81, I have come across a company called AVP worldwide.  They seem 
&gt;like
&gt;nice folks, and Leonard spent a long time explaining why a rebuilt 
&gt;head
&gt;with seats put in so they don't fall out would be a better bet than 
&gt;new AMC
&gt;heads from Spain, which drop seats fairly commonly.
&gt;
&gt;If anyone has experience with these folks, please give me an opinion 
&gt;on the
&gt;company or their engines.
&gt;
&gt;I'm not unreasonable... I just want a bulletproof engine that puts out
&gt;maybe 400HP, gets 50 MPG, and installs itself.  It would be nice if it 
&gt;was
&gt;a LOT smaller than a stock engine, so I could install a trunk. :-)
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
