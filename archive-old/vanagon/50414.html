Due to lack of funds and affection for this body style, i'm thinking of 
including westies, not just ev, in my search for a vw camper

This ad is from the Sunday Chronicle in san francisco bay area:

VW '90 Westfal Cmpr. Fully equip Purch. in '91. 4spd, AC, alloy whls, 
stereo, extra seats. Dark blue. 57K. 1-owner. All
service rcrds. Immac. $18,500. 753-1624 

also, if &quot;kevin from colorado&quot; is out there, i've tried twice to respond 
to your emai address and messages keep getting bounced back to me. 

thanx,
