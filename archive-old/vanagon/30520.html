Subject: DIY Head Gaskets, How?

I have leaking head gaskets on my '85, no money to throw around (i have to
buy books for next semester), and an able body but not much mechanical
experience.  I would really love to replace these myself, and if there is
anyone out there who has done it easily, please,please tell me how.  I'm not
going to have email after this week (going home for winter break, but i'll
be back) so please mail me before Friday, thank you very much in advance.
