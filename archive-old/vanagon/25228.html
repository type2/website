  De-ja-vous, or somethin' like that.
  I was in the same boat with school bills and all that, I was 
searching for the perfect typeII for at least 3 years.  I finally 
bought it a few weeks ago.  Found a '72 with westy interrior in 
the local paper near detroit for $500.  The interrior looks like it 
has never been used and there is verry little rust on the body.  Only 
problem was that it needed a front axle beem, the bottom tube was 
completely free of the brackets.  I offered the guy $300, bought the 
complete beem for $250 and fixed it with a friend in about 4.5 hours. 
 For a total of $550 I now have one nice bus on a student budget. I 
guess what I have to say is Hang in there.  I looked at a lot of 
buses and nearly paid a lot of money when I didn't have to.  There 
will always be the right one out there if you have the patients to 
search dilliigently and wait a while.
        good luck.

       &gt; &gt; Hi,
&gt;         Throughout my life I have always had a fascination with TYPE II
&gt; volkswagons, and I recently was given the oppurtunity to have my own.  
&gt; Being on a tight college budget limits my selection quite a bit and I was 
&gt; wondering if any on this list might be able to steer me the right direction.
&gt; I have found a 1970 camper bus that is perfect inside but has a rusty back
&gt; end and sills.  Their is no motor but the owner ( a VW restorer of 30 years)
&gt; assures me the front end and transmission are O.K.  He also has many of the
&gt; smaller parts in his garage and said he would be glad to help guide me through
&gt; the project of restoration. I don't know too terribly much about engine work so
&gt; his help would be essential to my sucsess.  He wants $ 400 for it and believes 
&gt; it can be on the road for under $2,000.  I really don't have anything to 
&gt; compare this price to since I've never seen a bus for sale in my area 
&gt; for under 2,500-3,500$$$.  I was hoping maybe someone could advise me 
&gt; on this investment and E-mail me on the availabilty of '70 parts and
&gt; 
&gt; Press RETURN for more...
&gt; 
&gt; MAIL&gt;

&gt; anything else you think I should know.  This has always been my dream, so 
&gt; it is realy difficult for me to look at the vehicle objectively...
&gt;                         I would greatly appreciate any resposes...
&gt;                                         Damian.
