Subject: Help! Please! 77 westy newbie questions

Hi All,
I am the proud but nervous parent of a '77 westy, I bought it last weekend
from a sweet couple in their 70's, a one owner vehicle, in immaculate
condition.  I have had a few of problems, which I think in part may be due
to the folks I bought it from probably have not driven it except for the
occasional run to the store. It broke down on me on my way back to Atlanta
from St. Petersburg FLA, where I bought it from them.  I learned the first
important lesson, know your bus well before you drive it over a long
distance, and carry common spare parts ( I had to wait 9 hours before we
could get points and a condensor, and then they were napa and had to be
replaced as soon as I got home. After a rather frustrating week of shelling
out cash to figure out what the hell was wrong, it turned out to be the
control unit. New used brain in and it runs fine, but...

The main cable running into the housing of the control unit has come loose a
couple times and I have stalled out, not fun in 100 degree Atlanta heat to
have to get out and jiggle the wiring and run back and start it again.
Anyone else have this problem and if so how did you correct it? 

It is an automatic and has A/C which works great but... evertime I have had
a problem I also have tryed running the A/C, I am so paranoid now that
something else is going to happen that I drive it constantly listening to
the engine. I think the A/C and problems are just coincidense.
I am wondering if anyone else has a type II with A/C and is running the A/C
on hot summer days like today when it is 95+ out, a danger to the engine
overheating? 
How does one know if their bus is running to hot? I have no temp gauge.
 I bought John Muirs book How to keep your VW alive.... is this a good guide
to diagnosing and repairing it myself?  
I have always owned new cars, japanese, which basically all I ever did was
take them up and have the oil changed. Last Saturday before I bought the bus
I couldn't tell you how to check the oil or what made a car move. Now I
think I have a real understanding of the air cooled engine, and how it
works. Yesterday I changed the oil myself (SAE 40 weight, casrtol, right
choice?)and my VW mechanic is going to tech me how to adjust the valves.
Sorry this is so long, but any advise, suggestions help would be greatly
appreaciated and I hope in the not to distance future to be able to give as
much back to newbies as I will need to take right now.
Thanks,
Scott Bogen
