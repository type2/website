Subject: bad cat. due to bad coil update.

quick story is.....ignition coil went one cold night.  i did a lot of
cranking(and push starting) before giving up and abandoning my baby in the
not so good streets of boston.  after a tow home, and some time to diagnose,
i replaced the coil and started it right up.  the problem began a mile into
test drive....loss of power, to the point of barely moving.  I think i must
have read in the list some where about resetting computer by flicking
ignition on and off.  what a great thing to know!!!  was able to drive this
way to work and back (20  x 2=40 miles).  my theory to the problem was: the
excess raw fuel in the exhaust (from all that ignitionless cranking) which
traveled into the exhaust, threw off the 02 sensor, causing the computer to
lean out the engine, resulting in the poor afor mentioned  performance of the
engine.  my best hope was that it would all burn off and all would be right
again.  my worst fear was a new cat. and a new 02 sensor.    as it turned
out... by the second day,the excess gas..(or carbon) burned off and all was
right again.  ;)  i guess ud have to say..after all the tales of woe ive read
on this list...this was a very happy ending to a not so good situation.   im
only reporting all this so someone out there can concider waiting out the
problem...rather than paying any $ for somthing they dont need(yet). ;)  and
yes...that was the quick story.
                                 peace,     derato
