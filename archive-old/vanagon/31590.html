&gt; There is no mystery to fixing this. Buy the $100+ air box auxiliary wiring
&gt; harness at the dealer and you are all set. I don't know why people keep
&gt; writing about this as though it is some big mystery. The wriring harness works.
&gt; 
Is this a fix that was incorporated at the factory for later models? 
If so, from which year on? I'm asking because I've seen this in an 
'83 that I drove, and want to know if I should look for it on the '87 
I'm looking at now.
