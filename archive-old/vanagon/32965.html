Subject: Re: free '58 bus

It's gone. A list member got it. I'll let the guilty party speak up. ;) 
I'm just sore that I didn't beat him to the draw...but happy it'll 
hopefully get a good home. 8) Joe

&gt; To GIVE to good home:
&gt; 1958 BUS, pretty rough but would make a good project van for someone low 
&gt; on bucks. I don't
&gt; want to send this old soldier to the crusher! No engine but has clear 
&gt; title. Will someone have pity
&gt; and bring a trailer to Stillwater, Oklahoma. I'll even help you load it 
&gt; up! Please call 405-372-7179
&gt; evenings or e-mail duck_at_pp.okstate_dot_edu
