Hey all,
I have a quick question about European Vanagon engines.  I'm looking in
my Haynes manual for the air-cooled Vanagon and of course the only
engine available for US models was the 2.0-L fuel-injected engine.
However, the Haynes manual also has information about the apparently
Europe-spec only 1.6L engine (1584cc) which happens to be the same size
displacement-wise as the Type 1 engine.  So what I'm wondering is what
this engine looks like.  I'm assuming it's a Type 1 case with a pancake
fan housing.  I'm imagining it looks something like the Type 3 engine or
maybe just like a smaller version of the 2.0L engine.  In fact, it's
probably a Type 1 case with the Type 4 fan housing installed.  Any of
you Euro listees who can give me some information on this setup, I'd
appreciate it.  Just want to satisfy my curiousity.  For those Americans
who are curious, the 1.6L engine has a single carburetor, a Solex 34
PICT-4 while the 2.0L Euro engine has dual carbs, the Solex 34 PDSIT
(isn't that the same as the '72-'74 US Bus?) while, of course, the US
2.0L has Bosch L-Jetronic fuel injection.

Thanks,
Sean
