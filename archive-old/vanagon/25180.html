Subject: RE: VW Bus Reviews???


&gt;Today we have numerious magazines giving long write-ups on every new car 
and
&gt;model available.  During the '70s was there such a magazine for original
&gt;model year reviews?  Something like &quot;Introducing the new 1978 VW Bus!&quot;  I'd 

&gt;love to hear the explanations of the &quot;new&quot; features.  Any suggestions?


I've got one for the NEW 1968 Bus, with the totally redesigned, modern
front end!!!

Want a copy? I can send it individually, or post it to the list if there's
enough interest.
