In a message dated 97-04-03 22:42:31 EST, you write:

&lt;&lt; 6J = Rim is 6 inches wide, with a J profile.  The J profile is the shape
of the rim where it 
 interfaces with the tire (not relavent to you).
 
 7J = Rim is 7 inches wide, with a J profile. &gt;&gt;


Ok. thanks. 
Well, It looks as if it may work. 
Now, to find a new A series in a junkyard - well, that's another
problem.......
