Subject: Re: Need advice for head gasket leak
From: kdlewis_at_juno_dot_com (kenneth d lewis)

Dam it Jim; I'm a doctor not a linguistic professor!!!
I stand corrected. The book indeed calls the large rubber seal a &quot;head
gasket&quot; and the cylinder seal an &quot;O-ring gasket&quot;. Unfortunately, if you
change one ,you'll change both. BTW last winter during the big ice storm
I test drove a vanagon for a couple days. During the coldest days I
noticed both heads leaking in the &quot;HEAD GASKET&quot; area. I tried to check 
the coolant , alas it looked like a lime slushy (No ,I did not buy it). 
Sooooo... winter is around the corner. How low can your anti-freeze go?
Stay warm, chill out
