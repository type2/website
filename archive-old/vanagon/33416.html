Subject: Re: Back issue articles on the WWW/i.n.

&gt;-- Chris Chubb (cchubb_at_ida_dot_org) mentiponed cutting up magazines for the
info and added:
&quot;PS: What I would really like to do is get the publishers 
&gt;permission to scan these articles and make the availible
&gt;on the net. But, they 'recycle' the articles so shamelessly,
&gt;they prob wont allow it.&quot;

I talked to the reps from Dune Buggies and Hot VWs last June at the
California Classic, Irvine, CA. I suggested that there was the possibility
for a secondary market by archiving the past articles on the Web or a in a
listserve situation. Thinking that the publishers could sell subscriptions
via password etc and capitalize on existing articles that have already been
published and paid for. Secondarily, I suggested that they could sell
listings within the site(whatever) to their current and previous advertisors.
The response was real underwhelming and vauge. Knowledge of the web or the
internet (in it's original ascii state) was nonexistant. I even offered to
&quot;Word them up&quot; as to how these things could be accomplished. More vagueness.
**Attention Publishers!** there is a market out here that hasn't been tapped!
Hello, anybody home?

&gt;Weeeel,
&gt;
&gt;I find this kinda hard to admit, but I was diggin around in my 
&gt;closet this weekend, and came across my stash of old issues of
&gt;DB&amp;HVWs and VWT&amp;A. Did not need these old issues, so I sat
&gt;down with a razor blade and cut out all the tech articles, and
&gt;tossed the ads and bimbos.
&gt;
&gt;I have some series in the pile, and I need some of the missing
&gt;issues. 
&gt;
&gt;If someone out there has some good stashes of '90-'94 DB&amp;HVWs
&gt;series, I would appreciate hearing from you.
&gt;
&gt;I am still making a list of the exact issues I still need.
