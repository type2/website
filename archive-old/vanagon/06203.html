TOYOTAS!!! GAAAAAAGGG!!!

My 86 GTI has 210k miles on it....its been autocrossed, its
been rallied, in fact my wife and I took NER/SCCA Class B
Rally Championship two years running, as well as the local
championship 5 years running and the SCCA Divisional Championship
back in 1992. In one memorable weekend, it went to Long Island
competed in a 12 hr night rally where we took 1st overall,
took the 6am ferry back to the mainland, drove to NH and
rallied the next afternoon and took 2nd overall and 1st in
class. It took first in class twice in the infamous Midnight
Mountain 12hr rally (250miles plus of dirt roads at nigth)...

It still runs...original engine, etc...doesn't burn a 
drop, its a bit tired but its been thru hell..

so before you start off on your toyodors on how good they
last, thrash one about for a couple of years...hell anyu
car can last 200k miles of highway driving...

Ahhhh...I fees so much better....almost as good as having a
large espresso...    ;-)
