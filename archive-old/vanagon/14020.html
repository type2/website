Subject: Re: 12v dropping resistors

&gt; 5. try the circuit out with your new resistor to see if the resistor 
&gt; heats up excessively, if it does, the wattage rating isn't high 
&gt; enough and you need to get a higher rating one or hook 2 resistors of 
&gt; twice the desired resistance in parallel.


This last idea won't work. Putting two resistors of equal resistance in 
parallel halves the resistance. So the voltage would be too high.
