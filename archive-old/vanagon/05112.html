&gt; What changed after '63?  Is that when they went to the larger-diameter

&gt; change that much. (When did the big door go on the back?). 
&gt; 

In '63 the rear axle got bigger (nut uses 46mm socket instead of 36mm like
on Beetles.  Also, the inside diameter of the drums went from 230mm
diameter to something a little larger (240 or 250 or something).  Guess
that the bigger brakes had something to do with the 1-ton rating someone
mentioned.  But they all had stock 14&quot; wheels since the mid-fifties, I
think.
