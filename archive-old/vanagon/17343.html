Al Knoll notes twice in his description of the MSDS Porsche conversion: 
&gt; But no heat.

This has always been my concern with attempting a 911 coversion. After 
speaking with Martin Shneider (sp?) of MSDS, he indicated there were a
couple options for heat.

One option which impressed me was to use oil out of the oil cooler and run
it through the heater core in the cabin. The plumbing and controls are
already there. This sounded like a viable option. 

So one non-monetary reason for not doing the conversion has been shot
down. Now, all I need is 10 grand and I can have a 911 engine. Ya right,
got that sitting right here in my wallet :-).
