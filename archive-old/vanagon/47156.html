Subject: was: Warm air from under dash, now: rear heater

&gt;I'm having a similar problem with the rear heater now, and I assume
&gt;it's the same thing.  Haven't dug into it yet.

There should be a shut-off valve on the passenger side of the rear heater
box.  It's manually operated -- the controls on the dash just control fan
speed (at least up to '86) -- you just change the position of the lever with
the seasons.

On a related note: The PO for my '86 lost the operating lever for the rear
heater valve (the little piece of stamped sheet metal that fits on the nylon
stem).  Anyone have one they could part with?
