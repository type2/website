Subject:      Re-stubbing fuel injectors

Vananuteers:
I decided to proceed after the two &quot;horror stories&quot; and one encouraging
response to my query of replacing the short hose attached to the
injector. At first glance the feasibility seemed questionable due to the
crimped manner of attachment. It turned out to be quite easy and the
results very satisfying. All that was needed was an Exacto knife with a
long, sharply taper blade. First I slit the hose down the entire length .
This involved a little bit of digging under the crimp(15seconds worth).
Then the hose could be easily peeled from the barbed nipple on the
injector. Once the hose is removed the crimp just falls off.

Drive Safely &amp; Good Luck
