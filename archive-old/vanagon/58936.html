Subject: Clutch slave cyl.

Hi listees: Have been lurking n the sidelines learning all I can about my 
86 Westy. Just crawled out from under it and found that the clutch slave 
cylinder is leaking. Is this a 'do it yourself' repair for a fair handy 
person? Any info on how to do will be appreciated and the cost of the 
unit. Or is there a rebuild kit avaiable? 

The people on this list are great and I hope you can help.......
