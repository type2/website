Subject: CIS help long


&gt;Hi Volks,
    Its me again,  more damn CIS problems with my Vanagon.
&gt;  I need some help with my 83 GTI Motor that is installed in my '82
&gt;Westfalia.  For a while I have had some runnning problems that I thought I
&gt;had solved with the installation of an O2 sensor. I'll recap what I have
&gt;done.
&gt;   Last winter my van started to run poorly, no power, skipping and high
&gt;fuel comsumption.  I started checking and replaceing things I found wrong,
&gt;fuel filter, pump, warm-up/ control regulator, thermo- time switch and aux
&gt;air regulator. I also did a complete tune up, wires, plugs, cap, and
&gt;rotor.  I set the timming at about 10 degrees advance.  When I finally had
&gt;enough, someonetold me that the O2 sensor is very important and I should
&gt;have hooked it up from the begining.  Well, I finally did and everything
&gt;has been fine, till now.
&gt;    Here's the problem, over the last few days the van has been running
&gt;weird on and off.  It has been starting hard warm and cold and when cold
&gt;acts just like it did last winter. No power and skipps. When I give the
&gt;engine full throttle it bucks and loses power, if I let off the throttle
&gt;just a little, it takes right off.
&gt;      So I did some tests on the control box and fuel presure regulator. I
&gt;was hoping someone could tell me if these readings are normal, and is my
&gt;control box working right. The Bentley manual give me a rough idea but I
&gt;want to be sure.  Here goes.
&gt;
&gt;Test 1:  Engine off.  Pump running. Warm up regulator power disconected,
&gt;Outside temp 55 dgr engine not run in 4 hours.
&gt;     I used a dwell meter to get the dwell reading.
&gt;
&gt;    Begining Dwell reading 48 degrees   pump control pressure 12lb.  full
&gt;pressure (turned valve on gauge) 68lb
&gt;     Activate full throttle switch, Dwell reading 60 dgr.  Activate
&gt;thermoswitch: dwell reading 72 dgr.   Ground out green O2 wire dwell
&gt;reading 86. Hook up flashlight battery to green wire:  dwell reading 16
&gt;dgr.   How does this sound so far.
&gt;
&gt;Test 2:  Engine running.
&gt;
&gt;        Fuel control pressure at 12lb slowly rises to 50lb in about 10 minu=
tes.
&gt;        Dwell reading 48 dgr quickly drops to 14 dgr and then bounces and
&gt;slowly rises to 86 dgr.  THe whole time the dwell meter flucuates about 10
&gt;dgr  back and forth while rising.  Reaches 86=BA reading and stays there.
&gt;Rev engine and dwell drops to about 60 dgr and flucuates.  Engine idles
&gt;and I active the full thottle switch dwell drops to 60 dgr engine runs
&gt;poor.  Activate thermoswitch dwell drops to 72 dgr and same engine poor.
&gt;THe whole time I run this test I can hear the fequency valve buzzing.  It
&gt;changes pitch when the dwell changes. I drove the van around and the
&gt;dwell, most of the time was around 86 dgr.  It would drop to around 60 dgr
&gt;at higher RPMs but the whole time I could feel the engine skipp and was
&gt;powerless.
&gt;       My biggest question is:  Is the dwell suppsed to be 86 dgr At idle?
&gt;Am I running the engine to lean and the FI is trying to compensate?  Or
&gt;vis versa? Last week I had the state inspection done.  The emission
&gt;reading were:  HC 25ppm, CO .25, and the C02 was 13%.  Well within Mass
&gt;limits.  I've checked every vacume hose and the intake hose.  Everything
&gt;seems in order.
&gt;    I have been getting 20MPG at 70 MPH. I also checked the fuel injectors
&gt;and the have anice spray pattern and don't leak. Same is true of the cold
&gt;start valve.  Tested the hot pulse start relay, it seem to be working like
&gt;the book says. The Thermo- time switch also seems to be operating with
&gt;normal parameters.  Does anyone have any ideas as what my problem might
&gt;be?  I double checked all the connections and wiring.
&gt;   The only other thing that comes to mind is the exhaust.  It only has on
&gt;1 1/2 opening at the manifold.  Do you think that it might be restrictive?
&gt;Could cause the engine to load up at start up or when cold because of too
&gt;much back pressure?   Well thats my story I hope someone can help.  I'm
&gt;just about ready to put a brick on the throttle pedal and ride the bus. I
&gt;don't think my wife would like that though.  Did I mention I have about
&gt;150lb compression per cylinder.
&gt;Please help!   Thanks in advance.  Take care.
