Subject: Considering 90 westy 29k miles.

Could I have some thoughts please.  Just gawked at a 90 Westy gl with 29,000
miles on it at a used dealer lot.  Asking price:  $11,995.  It looks great
from the outside.
I have an 87 Westy gl with 95,000 miles.  This one is tempting me.  The only
serious drawback (without driving it) is that it's an automatic.  I would
prefer a stick but geez, 29,000 miles!  Also it has an aftermarket furnace
put it vented through the side.  Seems ok...has a thermostat...I've read the
debate.

So what do you think?  Should I gamble on selling my 87 west gl.  Should be
worth 8500.00  new brakes, complete exhaust, runs fine.  and pick this one
up?

If I don't perhaps someone on this list would be interested.  The lot was
closed today (Sunday.)  Hope to drive it Monday.  Looks like a deal to me.
 Westy's without rust are hard to find here (Wisconsin.)

All/any thoughts appreciated.
