Subject:       noodles

&gt; Joel: I have never put a wet noodle up a wildcat's rear end, much less
&gt; anything else ;)

this must be that Southern sport referred to as   *noodl'in*
(actually, noodl'in is far worse-- copius amount of alcohol followed 
by a trip to a river whereby one reaches his/her hand and arm up into 
holes in the bank with the hopes of grabbing a 30 pound catfish.  nevermind 
the cottonmouths, gators, etc.--  but I'm a northerner and really 
couldn't substantiate this.  they drive to the river in a VW van)
