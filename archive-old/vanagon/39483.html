Subject: Thoms  distributors

Thom asked about early distributers.

&gt; I got four early, cast iron distributors with this parts stash.
&gt;        VJU4 BR8 (2 of these, one with thin wire clips, the likes of which
&gt;I've never seen before)

I've got one on my 1956, sedan and I see that they were used until up until
1960, when it gave way to the Bosch ZV PAU 4R1-5.

&gt;        VJR4 BR18 (no vaccum advance hookup)

This was used on the Porsch 356B (1600), which I quess again puts it back
into the 1960s.

&gt;        0 231 153 009 (yes, a 009, but really really old!)
No idea on the last find.

&gt;        Any idea what motors these woulda come from?
