&gt; My temperature control levers are not lit up, so it's hard to see what the 
&gt; temperature controls are set at, when driving at night.  One of the two fan 
&gt; control dials is lit up.  What else is supposed to be lit up on an 84 
&gt; vanagon?  Are the temp control levers lit up?

Yes. There's a light back there, and you can get at it from below, but 
it's going to be hard on your knuckles.  If you get some lights, get a 
couple for me and drop by.  I have the exact same problem on mine.  I 
know where the light is, but when I removed the dash I didn't have a 
spare light, so I couldn't replace it. :-(.  Oh. Both fan dials also have 
lights on them.
