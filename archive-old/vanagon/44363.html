Heh heh, yep, that's what the ad said.  Splits are sorta sparse up here and
I guess the seller thinks it's the only one in the U.S.!  Oh well, maybe
some day I'll sell my '71 for $10,000 and buy a vanagon.

There's an advertisement I see in the local Farmington, CT paper
occasionally about a place called Beetlemania.  It appears this person gets
cars from outside the rusty northeast and &quot;restores&quot; them and turns them
around for a profit.  Haven't called or visited yet, but I'd guess there is
some money to be made like that in this state.

I still have high hopes that bussing will always be accessible to the
struggling masses (or at least until after I stop struggling).
