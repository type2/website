A noisy fuel pump often means a clogged fuel filter or tank outlet - possibly
what made your old pump fail to begin (or end) with. If the filter wasn't
changed, change it. If it's still noisy - check the list archive about
cleaning tanks.

The nice folks at the local shop installed a new fuel pump the next day
($239 parts and labor) and we were back on the road by noon. We noticed
soon after we started up again, however, that the fuel pump was really
humming. We'd never heard it before, but it's hard to miss now. Also, the
fuel gauge now drops to half after 50 miles of driving, which was quite a
shock the first time we noticed it. Mileage after the new pump was
installed slipped to about 22.5.
