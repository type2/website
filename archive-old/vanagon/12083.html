&gt; &gt;&gt;well ... it's almost a certainty that you'll need a new dryer. if the system
&gt; &gt;&gt;has been opened to the air at all, the dryer is probably wasted. they ain't
&gt; &gt;&gt;cheap. but you probably can find one at other-than-the-dealer.

&gt; Is there a way to dry it instead of replacing it? What's the material
&gt; inside the dryer? How about bake it (low heat of course) in an oven?

David,
It doesn't work like that.
It's not a dessicant type thing.  It separates water from the air through
compression and cooling.
I haven't been paying much attention to this thread so I don't know
what's wrong with the A/C but you can't bake a receiver/dryer back
into use if it's rusted or somthing.
