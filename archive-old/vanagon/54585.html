Subject: Engine erratic power.

Hello people,
        I have been following the thread about the engine stalling problem.
As I understand the problem, moving the gas peddle has no effect on the
Engine.  The problem either goes away or a restart is in order.  
        The problem I have had apprears only at part throttle, at 10&quot; of
vacumm, in wet weather, after an hour or more of operation.  The engine
bucks or jumps as if it is being turned on and off rapidly.  If the throttle
is depressed, decreasing vacumm ( loading the engine more) the problem
stops, or lifting the throttle, increasing the vacumm ( unloading the
engine) again the problem stops.  If the vacumm is returned to 10&quot; the
bucking returns.  This will happen for about 5 to 20 minutes, and then
vanish.  I have never had this problem on my 25 mile trip to work. 
        With it being dependent of wet weather I would think it was a bad
connection or a broken wire.  I have checked the wires and have found no
real problems.  A few slightly corroded connections, but after cleaning, the
problem reoccured.  
        I don't know if this is the same problem as the previous posts have
spoken of, with diffrent symptoms or a totaly diffrent problem.  I think as
soon as it warms up, I will recheck all wires and connectors.  I will also
replace the tempurature sensor, just as part of a test. 
        As for profiting of the list, I don't feel used if a person makes a
small profit off services or parts I have recieved.  I think small
statements about parts or services offered is'nt out of line with the spirit
of the list.  I would find it offensive if people made long winded and
repetitive advertisements on th list.  False representation should not be
allowed anywhere.  
        That last paragraph was my $.02 worth.  I find far more to like
about the list and its people than to dislike.  As in life you have to take
the good with the bad while trying to maximize the good.
