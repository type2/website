Subject: ATTN!!!  CCC's and Martha (Busgirl) Rubin

The Vanbondos (aka Jim/Paula Ellis) and the resto from hell are headed to
Kelley Park on Sunday.  They will be in the parking lot of the Golden Oak
Restaurant (or the adjacent hotel) in Morgan Hill on Satuday and invite any
listers who want to mingle to come search them out.  I am just posting for
them--don't reply, causew you'll see them before I will!
