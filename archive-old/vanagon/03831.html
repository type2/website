&gt; 
&gt; It is possible to get VW to pay 100% of the cost of replacing the heads 
&gt; and gaskets when they leak.  This covered by the FTC consent decree that 
&gt; resulted from the rabbit oil sucking problem. I just got my 87 Syncro's 
&gt; heads replaced gratis. If you have bills from such a repacement you might 
&gt; get paid through this approach.  There is a Better Business Bureau 
&gt; arbitration procedure you need to invoke.  The BBB program is called 
&gt; &quot;autoline&quot;.
&gt; 

My '87 Syncro still has its original unleaking heads.  Anyone have any ideas
on how to _make_ the heads leak in order to take advantage of this 
generous offer?  I'm probably due for new heads with 115K on the clock...
