&gt;WEll my turn to put up anothr notice for the EV crowd.

What year was it and how many miles were on it?
How long did was it before you noticed the bearing noise before the belt
snapped?
(And if the compressor belt is off, why can't you drive it that way w/o the
A/C working? Is it required for balance on the front pulley? )
