[Thom writes about the busses stuck by Hwy 50]

Cool.  I saw you guys on Hwy 50 last night when I was driving
back from a weekend rafting trip.  Nice looking bus.  I was with
my girlfriend, we were driving a modern, soulless (i.e., it
never breaks) Japanese car so I wasn't carrying tools, and you
looked like you had it under control, so I didn't stop.

I would have been driving the westy (and thus had tools), but it
is awaiting an engine rebuild, thanks to the tow truck driver
who towed it in gear when I needed minor repairs on the previous
rafting trip.

Dennis
