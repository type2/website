Subject: twice the power and 3 times the mpg (new carbs)

Thom sent me some nice carbs last week and my bus is FINALLY highway
worthy. they made a world of difference.  The carbs are stock solex's,
probably '74 or so.  they use the same rebuild kit as the ones off my '72
but have different jets and some extra electrical stuff.  Anyway, I am
really happy and thought I'd share the good news. 
Ed.
