Subject: Re: Re: Vans in europe?

neil&gt; The prices of used vehicles in Germany which I saw this past July
neil&gt; were enough to make your head turn. New or used, they were out of
neil&gt; sight. To someone living in Germany prices may have seen to have
neil&gt; stabilized, but people on this side of the ocean have to
neil&gt; translate those prices into dollars (US) or dollarettes (Cdn). At
neil&gt; the time I was in Germany one Canuck buck got you one mark, take
neil&gt; it or leave it. And at that exchange rate, German used buses were
neil&gt; double the going price over here.
neil&gt;
neil&gt; The Brit prices seemed pretty fair; but as TS pointed out,
neil&gt; selling is another matter.
neil&gt;
neil&gt; Maybe it would behoove some list member who is resident in Europe
neil&gt; to put together a little bus exchange -- nah, probably do one or
neil&gt; two cars a year. Wouldn't be worth it.

        How about a bus exchange type of gig? You both take vacation at the
same time, and drive each others busses... kinda like people do with
houses... and hope you both know what you're doing when you crawl under to
tighten that exaust manifold nut...

Peace,
