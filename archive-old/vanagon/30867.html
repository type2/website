     How do you guys/gals do it? A friend of mine really wants to sell me
     a '73 beetle, it runs, no rust, a real beauty....plus two of its
     organ donors which can be left in the field where they currently
     reside. The price? $750.00 for all three...my wife is quite sceptical.
     Is ity jealously? Could be the staggering price tag....Should I be
     sneaky?  I tried the Xmas thing already....I would love some input...



     I think your wife is right. Don't let a low price get you hooked
     into something you will regret. Even a real beauty, late bugs are
     overheating, under powered attempts by VW, which had to violate a
     classic design to meet US law. Does it have a curved windshield?
     Ugh-those are even worse! Every time you drive by an older bug, you'll
     feel regret.

     Find something '67 or earlier, with the grace of the original design,
     she'll fall in love with it. Thats how I do the convincing: find
     something truly great, something beautiful, and she sees the logic
     too.
