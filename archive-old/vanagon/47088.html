Nancy:
I can sympathize with you.I have been in the electronic repair business
for the last 15 years. At times these machines do seem afflicted with
some sort of schizophrenic malady but in the end logic prevails.The
cause ,through the powers of deductive reasoning,can be traced to a
specific component.These intermittent problems are by far the worst.
I suggest checking the cleanliness/secureness of a few connections in the
engine compartment.Two things can cause the light to flash:
1&gt;Loss of continuity to the Level Sensor i.e. losing connection.This is the same as the level of coolant falling below the contacts in the
reservoir.(on your bus the book says  a switch does this function).


2&gt;Shorting to ground of the wire from theTemp. sending unit.this is
equivalent to the engine overheating.I have heard this wire getting to
close to the exhaust pipe and melting the insulation.

&gt;a 
&gt;'58 bus...&gt;

All my Daughters can relate to that!
