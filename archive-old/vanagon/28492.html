Subject: Help: Crew Cabs are worthless

I need your help.

I got a call this morning from the insurance adjuster re: the lady that 
backed into Opie, the '68 crew cab pickup.  According to her, the appraisal 
company said that basically the truck was worthless because of the rust and 
previous dents, but that since I was driving it, she felt that it was 
probably worth a few hundred dollars.  She feels most generous in saying 
that a driving vehicle is worth something.  She also said that the appraisal 
company called around a couple dealers and that the going price for a mint 
one is $700, so mine must be worthless.

I'd like to have some input from y'all as to what you think these might be 
worth, based on bus prices in your area, or crew cabs if you know of any.  I 
can't help but feel that almost any driving vehicle is worth $1000.

If I get some responses, I'd like to use them as evidence that Opie really 
does have some worth (it's bad for his self-esteem).

TIA,
Dean &amp; Opie

BTW - they seemed to ignore the fact that I had just put over $200 worth of 
tires on it since I was in the tire store parking lot when I was hit......
