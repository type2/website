Cooking in the engine compartment? Well, I've got the aux heater, but 
without it, I'd think the driver's side of the engine compartment would 
be a pretty handy spot for slow-cooking a pot of beans (provided you can 
isolate them from those exhaust/gas fumes that are bound to creep in.) 
Maybe a slow cooker would do the trick. Even with a good blower, 210-225 
is plenty hot for starting a pot of beans in the morning and eating them 
in the evening...course, you could always just set cans on a rack in 
there and warm them up.

&gt; Speaking of which, I used to have some cooking guidelines which would allow 
&gt; for cooking in the engine compartment (then it was a big V8 engine).  I 
&gt; remember like a couple hours for a whole chicken, or baked potatoes, or foil 
&gt; dinners (corn, hamburger meat, carrots).  Does it get hot enough in the 
&gt; engine compartment of a bus, on the top of the block, to do this?  Anybody 
&gt; know, or tried it?
