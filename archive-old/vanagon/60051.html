Subject: VW's Volkswagen Club

Hello,

Has anyone joined the Volkswagen Club from VW? They offer a whole bunch
of benefits that seem like it might be worth the $25. The parts discount
is the one that stands out the most (even thought I hardly ever buy
parts from the dealer) Any thoughts/experiences?

Cheers,
Dave
