 Hey all,  Need some advice on removing STUBBORN brake dust from alloy
wheels.
 Don't even bother suggesting stuff like &quot;Armor All wheel cleaner&quot; and the
like.
 Lemme just say I have even tried mineral spirits and a stiff bristle brush
to no
 avail. The damn stuff is on there like paint! 
 
 Anybody got any solutions of a solution that'll take this crap off without
 eating up the clearcoat?
  &gt;&gt;
The brake dust itself will eat the clearcoat.  Use polishing compound to
remove if it is not etched into the alloy itself.  Keep wheel waxed to
protect it and make future cleaning easier.
