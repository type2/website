Subject: Introductions???


The recent rash of introductions has this list sounding
like a 12-step recovery group...

Hi, my name is Dave, and I'm a VW-aholic.  I find myself
driving around aimlessly looking for volkswagens.  Please
stop me before I buy another bus.

Is there anyone out there who would be willing to be my
sponsor?

By the way, just where in Connecticut is that High Roof
Panel?  Let's see, that's only about 18 hrs away...  If
I left here tonight...
