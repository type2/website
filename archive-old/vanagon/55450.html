Subject: Re: Alternator &amp; EGR lights flashing?

Kyle,
The reason that the alt. and EGR lights flash at the same time is
because they are on the same circuit.  Both come on as a bulb check when
the key is first turned on.  VW needed a convenient way to turn off the
EGR bulb when the engine was started, so they tied it into the
alternator light circuit, so that when the alternator starts charging
both lights will go out at the same time.  The EGR light is otherwise
controlled by a mileage counter in line with the speedometer cable.
Every 15,000 miles the mileage counter closes the circuit to the EGR
light so that the EGR light will stay on when the engine is started.  

Of course, it's not normal to have these lights flash when driving.
That would indicate (to me, anyway) a loose connection somewhere that
reveals itself as things are moving around.  So, I would check the
connections on the rear of the alternator (the alternator and voltage
regulator are in the same unit).  The light comes on when the battery is
not being charged by the alternator, so you're moving something around
so that it's coming loose and then at that moment the alternator is not
charging the battery.  

I'm not sure what the relation would be to the LED on the panel
flashing.  I'll let someone else attempt that one.

&gt; Here's question that's beyond me.  Ever since I got my 1980 VW camper 
&gt; (last August), the alternator &amp; EGR lights would flash together and at 
&gt; the same rate.  They don't flash all the time, maybe 1 out of 3 short 
&gt; trips.  
&gt; 
&gt; I had the van worked on my a guy that knows vanagons pretty well, and he 
&gt; said not to worry about it.  Plus I just had a new battery put in three 
&gt; weeks ago, and they checked out the alternator, and it is fine.  
&gt; 
&gt; Also, I just noticed that the red light that is the fourth light to the 
&gt; bottom of the water lights(water tank) sometimes flashes at the same time 
&gt; too.  To be more specific it is behind the driver's seat, below the 
&gt; stove.  I think there are 3 lights for the water tank and the fourth one 
&gt; is something else.?
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, if anyone has the same problem, or has any advice it would be 
&gt; helpful.  
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt;
