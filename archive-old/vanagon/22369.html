If that price is the going rate they hold their value well.  I love my 
Eurovan but I have the MV.  On the parts that would be the same between 
these models the EV is a real good deal.  The MV of course has more 
functionality but it has a higher price as well.

Not sure what you mean by 'one sliding windows'.

The EV is a more modern van than the Vanagon.  More car like in feel but 
I think it is still rugged enough for most of what the non-synchro 
Vanagon can do.
