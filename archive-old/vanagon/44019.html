Subject: where to find a '79  Campmobile manual


Hi 

I just bought a '79 Campmobile,
but there wasn't a Campmobile Owner's Manuals.

The 2nd battery was dead  and disconnected,
anybody knows about the wiring specific to the campmobile,
so i can put the fridge back working?

Anybody knows where to get a copy of it?
