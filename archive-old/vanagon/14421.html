Subject: Later breadloafs with Type I engine
Date: Wed, 29 Mar 95 22:33:22 PST

  Could someone, perhaps one of the UK listmembers, who is familiar with
  how the upright fan engine is installed in the '72 and later bay window
  please describe the mounting arrangement? Does the plate behind the engine
  still remove? What sort of engine bearer/crossmember is there? Are there
  mounts on the bellhousing like on the type IV engine? 

  The VW Custom Handbook, published in the UK, shows several examples where
  an upright fan engined bus has been &quot;upgraded&quot; to a 2 liter type IV. Does
  anyone ever convert in the other direction, perhaps to take advantage of
  the less expensive parts prices for the type I engine?



  Thanks in advance,

  Dave


  P.S. David Schwarze &lt;and others&gt;, you can probably tell what I am thinking,
       Is this a dumb idea?
