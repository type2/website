&gt; Randy,
&gt; You may also want to check the flexible rubber brake lines to make sure they 
&gt; are not blocked.  I have had the experience on both my '70 Bus and '69 BMW 
&gt; that after sitting in neglect for along time, the brake fluid had caused the 
&gt; rubber to deteriorate and swell internally.  The result was that as you 
&gt; applied the brakes, enough pressure was generated to force the fluid past 
&gt; the constriction in the brake line.  When the brakes were released, the 
&gt; pressure cannot bleed off and the brakes drag.  Hope this helps.

I had the same thing just the other week with my '71 Bus that hasn't been
driven much in the last several years.  The pads weren't smoking or anything,
but were dragging enough that you wouldn't roll at stop signs even with your
foot off the brake.  New hoses fixed it right up.
