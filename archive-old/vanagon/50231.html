I, too, just called GEICO.  I asked for a quote for my '83 Westfalia and
'88 Olds Regency 98.  Based upon the serial numbers they quoted for 6
months:
		Rated on Serial #		Rated as Motorhome
Westfalia		$373			$331
Olds		$355			$438

The quote on the Olds skyrocketed, because if the Westfalia is rated as a
motorhome, it causes the quote on the Olds not to qualify for a multiple
&quot;car&quot; discount.  

Go figure!!!!

&gt;&gt; Listees, 
&gt;&gt;  
&gt;&gt; Prompted by the discussion on the list about motor homes, house tags 
&gt;
&gt;&gt; and insurance, I called my insurance carrier here in Texas, GEICO, 
&gt;&gt; and explained that upon registration of the vehicle, I had failed 
&gt;&gt; to specify that my Vanagon was a Westfalia,&quot;a motor home' and 
&gt;certified 
&gt;&gt; as such by the California Department of Motor Vehicles in the state 
&gt;&gt; in which I bought the vehicle.
&gt;
&gt;&lt;&lt;snip&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt; she researched the 
&gt;&gt; topic and telephoned with the pleasant news of a reduction in 
&gt;premium 
&gt;&gt; of about 45 percent for the year. 
&gt;&gt;  
&gt;&lt;&lt;snip&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;hi-
&gt;
&gt;i just tried the same thing, also with GEICO, and was quoted an 
&gt;INCREASE of 
&gt;$20/mo.  when i told her i wasn't interested, she advised that none of 
&gt;the 
&gt;inside of the van would be covered by insurance.  i kept saying that 
&gt;it was a 
&gt;motor home, and she kept talking about conversion vans.  i told her 
&gt;that while  
&gt;there was a conversion done on the van (in germany, by westfalia), it 
&gt;was 
&gt;bought new from a dealer as a motor home.

&gt;advice/comments welcomed
