&gt;         Also, this time when I adjusted the valves, all of the exhaust
&gt; valves were pretty tight.  I could not get the guage in.  Is this a bad
&gt; thing?  It had been 5-6k since I last adjusted them...  All of the intakes
&gt; were fine, and one was a little loose.  

Well.... it's definately not a good thing...unless you like burnt valves. :O  
You should be adjusting your valves at the very least, every 3K miles.  I'd 
start at every 1K just to get an idea of how quickly they go out of adjustment.
Then increase the mileage interval by 500 miles until I had an idea of just
how often they need the adjustment.  But I would not go past 3K miles.
