i seem to remember that the original sticker that started the whole thing
was &quot;fuNkingroovin&quot; from a publication of the same name (they have a
webpage...) I think the whole &quot;fukin&quot; thing is a bad takeoff of the
original, i dont much like to cuss on my bumper and i like funky :)

peace,
