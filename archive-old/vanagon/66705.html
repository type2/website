Subject:      Re: black tail pipe

Perhaps the black tailpipe results from the enrichment mode of the
engine.  Most, if not all, gasoline engines run rich at high loads.  The
engines are enriched as a function of throttle position or some
convolution of throttle position and air flow or straight out manifold
air pressure (not the VW Vanagon, it doesn't use Manifold Air Pressure:
MAP). Try putting in a good O2 sensor and monitoring operation, it
should read about ~0.4 volts at stoichiometric and ~0.8 volts at rich
operation ( ~0.0 volts at lean operation)  a new sensor should only cost
about $15. Try to get hold of an analog volt meter to do the measuring.
