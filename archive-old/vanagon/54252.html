Subject: 1985 Vanagon stumbling-Again!

I thought the new fuel pump and fuel filters replaced in Reno NV solved the
missing/bucking problem in my 1985 Westy(112K).(Ran great 3000miles return)
But on a recent trip in TN  while plowing down I-59. I felt a short stumble
which cleared for about 1/4mile followed by a more survire stumbling. I
put the accelerator to the floor and it seemed to clear up and has not
acted-up again in the last 300 miles. I have checked and cleaned all
grounds and checked the wiring to the temp sender II. The airflow box was
replaced by the PO(thank god), 30K miles on the new airflow box. No vacuum
leaks.No pattern to the appearance of this missing/bucking. Sounds like the
Digifant vanagon syndrome, but the 1985 has the Digijet system. I am not
really certain if the problem is ignition (Firing) or fuel delivery ( fuel
injection). All ignition components check good.

Is it possible the airfow box electrical contact has worn out at this low
of mileage-would that account for the clearing-up at increased acceleraton?

I don't think the temp II sender has ever been replace, will buy and carry
as a spare.

I guess it could have been a bit of H20 in the fuel, but not
likely.(Filters new- should catch)


Has anyone experienced this problem in your 84-85?
Charles
