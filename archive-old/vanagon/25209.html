Subject: Re: VW Bus Reviews???

Well, this isn't a review, but I found an ad in the January 20, 1964 issue of
Sports Illustrated that's pretty good.  Here's the text from the ad:

Sean Stueber
'63 Kombi
'72 Bug

(Headline) Somebody actually stole one.

We were tickled pink to hear that somebody wanted a Volkswagen Station Wagon
badly enough to go out and steal one.  It wasn't so long ago that we
practically couldn't give them away.  So when Martin Carlson reported his
loss to the police, we took it as a triumph.  In its own way, the VW Station
Wagon is one of the world's best getaway cars.  You can escape north or south
of the border.  (The VW engine can't freeze up or boil over because it's
cooled by air.)  You can go farther in a VW than in any police car (24 mpg is
our average).  You have 21 windows to spot anyone who's tailing you.  And it
carries more loot (170 cu. ft.) than the bigest regular wagon you can steal.
 Sadly, the whole theory blew apart when Mr. Carlson found his VW abandoned
in the very spot he had left it.  Maybe everyone isn't ready for it, after
all.  Not even crooks.
