&gt;Joel suggests that I might want to replace my fuel filter if I ran gas with
&gt;water in it.
&gt;Why?
&gt;Does the water sit in there or wouldn't it just come out eventually?
&gt;Does the water somehow ruin the fuel filter?

cause if you get a lot of water causing stuttering and such, it's likely that
you'll also get some crud from the bottom of the gas tank. while the water
WON'T get stopped completely by the filter (otherwise you'd get no gas at
all, instead of sputter-sputter), the crud will ...

i've just always heard that it's a real good idea to change the fuel filters
after you get a tank of bad gas. better safe than later-sorry.
