Subject: One last EV/Vanagon/Caravan observation
Date: Mon, 18 Apr 94 8:25:17 PDT

&gt; First off, I would like to thank Gerry Skerbitz, Steve Johnson and
&gt; our &quot;trivial expert&quot; Joel Walker for a most stimulating and interesting
&gt; discussion ( or was it an arguement...remember that old Monty Python
&gt; sketch anyone?) on Vanagons, EVs and Chrysler shitboxes (can we all
&gt; agree on the Chrysler shitbox designation?....after all they don't
&gt; even have a ladder frame like a VW) this weekend.
&gt; 
&gt; I would like to close with one FINAL observation. Grateful Dead stickers
&gt; do not look out of place on a EuroVan, Vanagon or early VW vans. They do,
&gt; however, look WAY out of place on a Caravan!
&gt; 
&gt; ;-)

Yeah my fingers are tired too. ;)  I agree that ANY minivan that does not have
the VW badge can have the distinction of &quot;Shit-Box&quot;.  I won't downgrade a full-
size van though.  They've been through some tough stuff and done pretty well.

Cheers!
