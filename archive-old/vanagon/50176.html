Subject: Bleeder Valve, CV's, After-Market Filter

Hey Guys,

I just changed  my coolant after checking out the archives first.  One
thing that was mentioned  was that the radiator bleeder valve looks like
a brake bleeder.  My bleeder is nothing more than an 8mm bolt (maybe
tapered).  Is this right?  I bled it by removing the bolt and spewing
coolant at a fast rate.  I think I got all the air out, but I'm gonna do
it again just to be sure.


While I was under there I noticed a slit CV boot.  Getting the axle off
is no big thing, taking the CV off of the axle to change the boot seems
a little bit harder.  I don't have a press, will I be able to get the CV
back on the shaft without one?  Any ideas would help.

Fuel filter thing - I posted a question previously about a Purolator
fuel filter.  Let me rephrase.  Is there an after-market fuel filter for
an 86 GL (my Bosch guy is way out of the way from where I live and not
open when I can get there)?  I need the one that's about the diameter of
a coffee mug. Sorry, I forgot to measure it.
