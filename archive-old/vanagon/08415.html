Subject: easier shifting in the rain



It has been raining pretty hard for about a week here and I've noticed
that my vanagon shifts easier. Could this be water lubricating the long
linkage? Has anybody else noticed this water effect?

One of the thing I don't miss from my '72 is the cloud of windshield
obscuring steam that would blast out of the defrost vent when the van went
through a large puddle, very scarey at night.

Alistair
