Subject: Re: OLD busses (3, or so....)

ditto for me, i wouldn't say the handling is that bad, but if you're
comparing it to a Eurovan, then it does seem rather crude by comparison.

The bottom line is that split window busses were made almost thirty years
ago! They're antiques, and as such shouldn't be really perceived as
anything else. Sure there are improvements that can be made to improve the
driveability of them, but if you want to make it do 70MPH for hours on end,
turn on a dime and stop immediately, you will be sadly disappointed.

Part of the reason that I have a 65' camper, is i like the van the way it
is (vague steering, under powered etc.). If I were to change it all over to
today's spec's, then to me it wouldn't really be the splitty that I enjoy.
That's my opinion for what it's worth.

&gt;&gt; Anyways, if you plan to go above 60 mph...don't get a pre-67 bus.
&gt;&gt; I, (IMHO) want STYLE, not substance...
&gt;&gt; Sorry my posts are obscure...ask for a translation...will oblige.
&gt;&gt; I can go 60 in my bus...55 is the SPEED LIMIT...so I'm OK.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;  My memories of my '64 are very much in agreement with what Eric says here.
&gt;   Also, IMHO, the handling, brakes, and crosswind stability are so bad on
&gt;   the old buses that pumping up the horsepower for higher speeds would be
&gt;   unwise without modifications to substantially improve those attributes.
