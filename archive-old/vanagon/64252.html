Subject:      high output bulbs

derek,  not to question your expertise in this regard because you have
been around these cars longer then i have,  but is there something
different about vanagons that would make them prone to ignition switch
failure from these bulbs?  i have used these bulbs with no relays for
somewhere around 12 yrs without a single problem.  this includes 5
gti's,
4 911's,  volvo 740 turbo,  ford explorer,  and a bunch o bmw's.....(
this makes me wonder how i wound up with a syncro w/ 90 hp! )  the
amperage tables show that the 55/100 bulb will increase the load by
3.1 amps per side at maximum load.  my experience is that this simply
isn't sufficient to cause anything but maybe a popped fuse,
especially given the fact that each side of the highbeam circuit is
seperately fused.  does anyone have any data in this regard?
cheers,
jim catterson
91 syncro
