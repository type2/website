Subject: List Coffee/Travel mugs anyone???

  Hello from the recently slack promotions department. As some of you may
recall, a few months back, I was talking about printing up list coffee and/ or
travel mugs. Things got a bit derailed for a while there due to some financial
strains on my part, but I think I have recovered enough to go ahead with this
project, if the interest is still there.
 From past discussions, I realized that the demand is about equally split
between &quot;nice&quot; ceramic coffee mugs, and sturdy, insulated plastic travel mugs
with lids.
  The design would be the trusty 4-bus Netvergnu:gen design, most likely on a
white, or natural ceramic color, depending on the model chosen.
  Cost would probably be around $10-$12, with a large part of that being
packaging and shipping charges. While a t-shirt can be mailed in a tyvek
envelope, which is free from the post office, a fragile mug will require a
special box, with padding, which will add a couple dollars in packing charges.
Unless, of course, you *want* it shipped in a tyvek envelope, in which case I
can do that as well!
:)
  So, then, I am looking to guage the IMMEDIATE demand for such items. Please
write me only if you fully intend to make an order. It has always been a
problem in the past that 50 or so people say they want t-shirts, but then only
about 30 ever send in an order. So, please only respond if you fully intend to
order. If you DO want me to do this, please tell me know how many of which
style you would like, so I can get more specific cost charges from the printer.
Of course, the more orders there are, the lower the cost.
 Anyway, Happy Friday, and hopefully you all still have a few dollars from
buying Ken's shirts and stickers... BTW, he and I are currently discussing a
permanent list-website-store, where in the future he may be able to keep a
small stock of list parephenalia on hand to sell that way...
