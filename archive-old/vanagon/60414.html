&gt;Other problem was the lack of ventilation.  Rain in the Badlands makes for a
&gt;muggy night, and since we don't have screens on the windows, we can't open
&gt;without the nightlife intruding. (bugs)  Does anyone know of screens made for
&gt;the standard Vanagon window, or has anyone made some?

My 90 Multivan has side screens, also do you have the mosquito net that
buttons to the back of the van when the hatch is up, this really help with
ventilation.
