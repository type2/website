&gt; We were on our way south to Los Angeles in our 95 EV Camper
&gt;  before Christmas, when lo and behold an 97 Camper passed us
&gt;  as we are about to climb the Tejon Pass grade. Not wanting
&gt;  to miss an opportunity to post to the list, I tried to
&gt;  keep up with the 97 up the 6% grade to see if the VR6 had any
&gt;  performance advantage versus the inline 5.
&gt;  
&gt;  Our top speed on that hill was 60 mph in 3rd gear (automatic.)
&gt;  They didn't seem to slow down from their approximated 75 mph
&gt;  and lost us with no effort...

And you would have lost me as well.  Our trip up that road on saturday was at
50 mph in out 87 Syncro - with quite a load.  I think I might have been able
to eek out another few mph (53 or so), but took it a bit easy on the engine.

Now, if I could just put that VR6 in my Vanagon.  Al's that's in my way is
money, fit, &amp; hassles with the California gov't.
