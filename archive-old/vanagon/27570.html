Subject: RE: The Forever Car (or Why Trade It In?)


&gt;&gt;Anybody ever read the book &quot;Why Trade It In?&quot;  Early
&gt;&gt;editions had a couple chapters on how much waste goes on in
&gt;&gt;cars since the average life was 12 years from showroom to
&gt;&gt;junkyard.  Later ones took it out.
&gt;&gt;&lt;snip&gt;
&gt;
&gt;I have that book but it is packed away in a box in the barn.
&gt;The authors did not have to convice me, I liked their
&gt;approach.  It did not sound quite as much like the Bob
&gt;Revolution as it just made sense for people *not* into
&gt;conspicuous consumption.  You got me curious and now I get
&gt;to find the right box to see which edition I bought.


Who wrote that book? Where can I get a copy, either new or used
or current or old or... ???
