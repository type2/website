Subject: RE: Interstate Batteries

        Harry:
        
        Over the years, I have bought about 4 or 5 Interstate batteries 
        and have been pleased, more so than with Sears.  The Interstates 
        were good values from my local FLAPS but the guarantees are 
        honored in a lot of other locations.  No battery lasts forever, 
        at least not the ones I've bought, but all my Interstates 
        exceeded the warranty by at least a year.  I currently use one in 
        my bus, 72 Westy, and one in my son's 72 Super Beetle.  Both are 
        around 2 to 2 1/1 years old and have been trouble free.  I do 
        keep the water level checked and the terminals clean.  Hard to do 
        in the bus!!  In sum, my experience with Interstate has been 
        positive.
        
        Peace,
