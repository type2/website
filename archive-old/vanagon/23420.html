Subject: VW Engine Fires (was: seat belts, fuel gauge, &amp; a firey death)


&gt;Apparently the owner was a victim of the dreaded engine fire

We've all heard of this, and/or seen it, in one form or another
I'm sure. Explanations abound, and no two are alike. Time for a
new, highly relevant thread?

In my experience (three fuel leaks, one fire), there have been two
different problems:

1.) Fuel lines get old, and start to crack/split. First clue is the
gasoline smell, which hopefully you notice before the leakage gets
severe enough to go boom. Anyone know if this is more common for
aftermarket tubing, as opposed to fuel tubing bought from a VW dealer?
Which lasts longer?


2.) No clamps on the fuel lines, at pump, filter, and/or carburetor.
Come on, guys, this one is a no-brainer. But I've seen quite a few
VWs without them. Have you hugged your fuel system today?

I actually had one mechanic tell me that the VW fuel lines are
designed to be used without clamps-- they grip tightly due to their
flexibility, he said, and therefore you shouldn't put clamps on them.
I asked him if his insurance was paid up, and he agreed to put clamps
on the rebuild he had just done. Maybe this is how he finds good used
long blocks to re-sell???

OTOH, another mechanic once told me that he won't even touch a VW
engine that doesn't have clamps on the fuel lines. If/when it catches
fire later on, and maybe incinerates the people along with the car,
the first thing that gets asked, he said, was, &quot;Who last worked on
this engine???&quot; In todays litigious society, you can understand his
reluctance. He issues a stern written and verbal warning to the owner
containing words like &quot;Severe Fire Hazard&quot; and &quot;Extreme Danger&quot;, and
wishes them a nice day.

What happens when these oh-so-flexible lines get old? You got it--
they stiffen up, conform to the shape of the pipe on your fuel pump
or whatever, and... they gon't &quot;grip&quot; any more! The rest is left as
an exercise for the class.

Then, when (not IF) they do slip off, it's not a gradual thing like
an old, fraying (but properly clamped) line in example (1) above.
You instantly get a jet of liquid gas onto your generator and/or
distributor, both of which make nice, fat sparks all the time.


3.) I once had the brass inlet tube at the top of the float bowl on
the carb, pop right out of its mount. Engine wasn't running at the time,
luckily. Never heard of another example of this failure mode, but once
is all I need.


Anyone else have any stories/questions/advice to relate on this thread???
Airing them publicly may be the greatest favor you ever do someone.
