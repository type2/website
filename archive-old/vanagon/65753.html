Subject:      Re: Propane leak / where to service

&gt; When I turn on the master knob at my propane tank I can smell propane and
it's quite strong.  I've tried &gt; spraying soapy water along the gas lines
but I cannot find the leak.  Does someone know where I can get &gt; this
serviced near Valley Forge in Pennsylvania?

Shaner's Propane in Sanatoga (about 1/2 hour from Valley Forge).  He's a
propane guy, not an RV guy, so if your problem is inside the camper rather
than under it he probably won't touch it, but he's the most knowledgeable
propane specialist I know, and very reasonable.  Hard to reach, though,
since he also manages an adjacent mobile home park; best time to get him is
first thing in the morning, as I recall.
