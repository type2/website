Subject: More rebuild/new engine questions


I checked out a couple of my options today for fixing my engine, which
will need new heads, pistons and cylinders, and I came up with a couple of
new questions I hope you guys can help me with.

First, some of the mail order companies in Hot VWs advertise &quot;new&quot; heads
for the Vanagon.  Who makes these, and are they any good?  $250 sounds too
cheap to be any good.

Also, there is an outfit in town that will recondition my existing heads
for $189.  I told him that there is a piece missing from the head around the
exhaust valve seat, and he said that that would not be a problem as they 
could arc weld a piece in.  This sounds *really* fishy to me.  Even if it
would hold, I would immagine it would have terrible thermal contact with the
rest of the head and get quite hot.  What say?

Thanks for all of you who already sent advice.  I still may opt for a 
rebuilt engine with a warantee.

--More later,  Albrecht
