&gt; hmmmm. my vote is for
&gt; 
&gt; Net-Vergnugen

I like NetSurfVergnugen, even though it is a bit long, cause it translates
properly.  I don't think people will get it if it just says Net-Vergnugen.
They might think we like fishing nets or something.   Hmmm... how about
InternetVergnugen?  SplitBayBrickEuroVergnugen?  SlowLaneVergnugen?  I think
using the stick figure sitting upright (maybe with a large, flat steering
wheel?) sounds good too.  If nobody has found out about how to do this yet,
I have an internet friend that produced bumper stickers for another &quot;group&quot;
I am a part of (Internet Bolo, bolo homepage can be accessed from my home
page - url in my sig).  I don't doubt that he could have the stickers made
for us for a small fee if I send him a graphic.  We would need to gather
a couple hundred dollars to cover production costs.  Should I contact him?
