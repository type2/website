Subject: 87 syncro won't start

I have an 87 syncro (MV with digifant water-cooled engine) which will not 
start.  It died in the middle of an intersection and hasn't run since.

I have checked sensors and switches that are shown in Bradley's Vanagon 
tech manual and they read correctly.  I can smell the fuel when I try to 
start it.  The spark and compression are good.

The one or two times that it tried to start, it pumped black fuel and 
white smoke out the tail pipe. 

I'm looking for ideas.
