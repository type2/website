Yours is a tale of woe, truly  :(   I'm really sorry to hear about Woodstock.

Is there any way the source of the fire can be determined?  What about
contacting your state fire marshall's office?  They might be willing to
help--after all, what else are they for, right?  If you can figure out the
cause, then maybe you can go after SF--if not, I'm afraid they won't give a
hoot, will claim you did something wrong, etc.

Again, we're sorry to hear about the loss of Woodstock.

Mike Wright,
(and Die Frau &amp; Mrs. M.)
