Hello Gerry Skerbitz, Ron Lussier:

You can count me in too.

I have found the Vanagon list one of the most successful newsgroups on 
the web.  All this time I have taken the benefits for granted, the _dot_edu
sounded like an offshoot from a university web experiment.

For the record, and in order to understand why other such servers don't
work as well, I'd appreciate a few comments from you on what it takes 
to run the service. Its quality for me is not only the ability to 
subscribe and ask the webmaster questions once in a while, but more 
important to have the archives, the weekly stats, and links to other 
personal web sites of interest.

How many contributions does Ron Lussier need in order to take over? Are
the archives in danger of going away?
