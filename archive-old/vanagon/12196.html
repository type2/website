Martha:

My awning provides an extension of the utility of my little toy!

I have the flexibility and comfort of shade whether there's a tree  available or not.

There have been instances while visiting campgrounds that either there were no 
trees, at all or the trees/shade was not where I wanted to park.

Worst case has been winged-feathered friends were not considerate of what was 
below them &quot;when they had to go&quot;.

While I (we) could go into the van to sit, there's just some evenings  or days when it's 
nice to sit outside, feel the breeze and enjoy the panorama while still having shade 
above.

Another consideration ... the awning provides a covered space to place &quot;stuff&quot; from the 
van for awhile. Even on some evenings/nights there is protection for things against 
dew and condensation (not complete but some).
