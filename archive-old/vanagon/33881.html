Subject: VW Sightings...


It seems like everywhere you look, VW's are  showing up.  Here are a few 
I have seen in the last few days..

Public insurance company... Has an ad like the Sears ad of a few weeks 
ago where a number of cars (actually) parts of cars, flash through at 
high speed while they talk about how they insure lots of types of cars 
and people.

Lee jeans... this was on about a month ago.  a woman driving a beetle 
with NY(?) plates is being followed by some big o'chevy and she seems 
oblivious until she is crossing a river on a ferry and the guy who was 
driving jumps on the boat as it is pulling away from the dock and he 
walks up to her and holds out a necklace and says something like &quot;you 
dropped this back there&quot;  and she says &quot;where&quot; and he says something like 
&quot;Wyoming&quot;....

Saturn autos... voice over while a bunch of bikers are riding down a 
desert road talking about how there is this &quot;group&quot; that until you ride 
with them you can't understand.... and as the bikers roll into what looks 
like their old hangout...they pass a Beetle fender and the bar is now a 
hangout for Saturn owners...

Chevy Camaro (sorta')... shows two kids hanging out, one looking out the 
window and the other across the room...everytime a car goes by outside, 
the kid who is across the room id's it just from the sound and one is 
like a &quot;'74 VW superbeetle&quot; or something close.

Seinfeld...in this week's episode, George calls Jerry from a phone at a 
garage near the cabin where he is taking time off from work, and in the 
bay you can see a yellow beetle. 

Mel Brooks'  SILENT MOVIE... I just saw this this week.  It is set in 
Hollywood and there are many VW's in the background of scenes which are 
shot outside.  Also, the car that Brooks, Dom Deluise, and Marty Feldman 
ride around in looks like a kit car (maybe a Gazelle?) and the rims on it 
look like VW rims.  

And one from memory... I seem to remember a Jerry Lewis movie in which at 
one point he is a bellhop at some hotel and some people drive up in a 
beetle and tell him to &quot;bring in everything from the trunk&quot;  and then they 
walk away.  The next scene shows Lewis delivering an aircooled engine to 
their door... Does anybody know the name of this movie?  (The Bellhop 
perhaps?)

Just thought that I would share this for anyone who is interested.
have a good weekend,
dave.
