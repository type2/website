Subject: re: Smelly Interior

	Bought a couple guitars from a full-time working musician-
case interiors smelled like a bar- beer and cigarets. Pew! Tried
Nature's Miracle pet smell remover but it works by trimming nitrogen
atoms off the smelly stuff- no nitrogen, no effect. Lots of soap
and water helped some. I'd remove everything I could remove and scrub
with a good dish-soap and stiff brush, rinse, dry with a towl and
let air-dry after that. I'm going to try that Ozium stuff on the
guitars one of these days... :) I expect to be an expert at
stain and smell removal soon :)
