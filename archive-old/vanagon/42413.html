Subject: Re: external oil cooler for 82 vanagon? Heating up????

&gt;I have an 82 vanagon and I am thinking of installing an exterval oil 
&gt;cooler. I have a VDO temp guage on the sump and the temps are running 
&gt;around 230-250. I know that is too hot. I have brought it in to get 
&gt;checked out and they say that everything is fine with the cooling system. 
&gt;So I am wondering if anyone has any suggestions on why it is getting so 
&gt;hot and how much and should I get an external cooler to hopefully solve 
&gt;the overheating problem.

Drive slower, and run oil level between the marks, not full.  That should
lower the temp some.  If 250 is top limit, at least t is somewhat controlled.
 Waterboxers can get the oil hotter than this.  Even if you add an oil
cooler, you wil not cool the heads much. Not much you can do except the
above.
