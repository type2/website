&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I happen to have a Westy manual for 1967 Campmobile's :):). It is a
&gt;&gt; photocopy, and is not 100% complete but it is a completists wet dream. tell
&gt;&gt; you what joe;, you send me a copy of your 68-72 manual, and i'll send you
&gt;&gt; one of my 67' is it a deal?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;joeclark_at_freenet.scri.fsu_dot_edu responds:
&gt;
&gt;Sounds good.  It may take me a few days to arrange xerography - strictly 
&gt;for hobbyist purposes, of course.
Wow!  What a score on that parts manual!  If you're taking requests, I'd
certainly appreciate a copy too.  It sounds chock full of the minutiae
detail-obsesive owner/restorers such as myself covet.  (&quot;Hi, my name is Pat
and I admit to laboriously peeling the interior stickers from Westys in
junkyards and to picking up used trim screws from junkers instead of using
&quot;newfangled&quot; unoriginal ones from the hardware store.&quot;)  I could give you a
copy of my '70 Westy manual (covers '71 too, I'm told), or volunteer to type
up a summary of the changes shown through the years as indicated in your
manual (for inclusion in the gopher).

&gt;But how could I have forgotten the curtains?  By the end of '71, you've 
&gt;lost those absolutely KILLER (sano, too, man) sliding-track curtains 
&gt;over the doors, to be replaced with a three-panel snap-on up front and a 
&gt;cheesy rod-and-pocket deal on the sliding door.  Oh pale echo of thy 
&gt;former glory!  At least they're not orange yet.  IMVHO the earlier curtains 
&gt;are the most _intense_ automotive curtains ever produced.  I am very 
&gt;serious and will engage you in a distastrous (and brilliantly 
&gt;puerile) flamewar if you contradict me.  Man.
Hm.  My '71 has one GIANT curtain that covers the windshield and both cab
doors and snaps in place.  You're saying it should have tracks?  Even for
the windshield portion?  I'm fairly certain mine didn't come with the track
curtains as I don't see any holes in the sheet metal where the track would
have been.  Mine DOES have a sliding track curtain over the sliding door,
though.  (And no, I'm not trying to start a flamewar.  ;-) )

Pat &quot;Too much time on his hands&quot; Walsh, '71 Westy
