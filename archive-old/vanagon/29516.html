1970 VW Camper Bus, near Jamestown, NJ.
Asking $2200 obo. (908) 254-2532, ask for Jim or Drew.

According to owner, the engine of this bus has been rebuilt within the
last 3000 miles, along with work on the steering, completely new
brakes, new tires, and other stuff.  Documentation of this work is
available.  Sink, refrigerator, auxilliary battery, bumpers, and
hubcaps all present.  Overall very clean, inside and out.
VIN: 2302034813, Engine # AH444171.

My observations: Odo reads 13,900.  Current owner doesn't know actual.
One dent, left rear fender.  Pop top and interior look to be in good
to very good condition, but I didn't pop the top.  This bus is
generally solid, *ESPECIALLY* in the wheel wells (no rust), but does
have some rusty places.  Floors very good.  Some bondo and some
welding work evident.  Engine seal missing.  Engine stronger than
transmission.  Steering *is* very good.  Probably worth the asking
price, but I'm no expert.  It looks like it's had all the typical bus
problems, and someone's been taking care of it.

All inquiries to the number above; I have nothing to do with this sale.
I just volunteered to post it for the guy.

-Rodney
