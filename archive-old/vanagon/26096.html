Subject: WTB: $1500 worth of bus in L.A.

Howzit everyone,

A friend of mine in west Los Angeles has $1500 that's
burning a hole in his pocket.  He dearly wants to join
in the fun.  He needs an everyday driver, splittie or
breadloaf, no matter (I told him a split is the only way
to go).  He prefers a relatively clean interior.  Any help
would be appreciated.

By the way, wassup up with the late October baja gig?
I'm putting a new case in shortly, so I'll be rarin to go.

Thanks,
Danny D.
