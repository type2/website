From: &quot;Joseph F. Fournier II&quot; &lt;jfourni_at_comp.uark_dot_edu&gt;
Subject: Coleman Catalytic

Probably going to a local auction Saturday that advertised a Coleman
Catalytic Heater for sale. I recall someone was interested in this, but
don't recall who. If you'll reply privately, perhaps I can purchase this
for you....that is, if you're still interested and promise not to kill 
yourself with it.

Thanks! Joe
