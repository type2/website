Subject: VWoA Core policy info!

List Members,

  Thought I'd share some info I just got today on VW's core policy!

  I have a friend who is looking to buy a NEW engine!  Trouble is that 
it has thrown a rod through the Block!  I thought that this would make 
the Core useless.

  My Good Friend at the Dealer informed me that if the failure happened 
internally, and the motor wasn't dis-assembled, it's still a good Core!

  Well, I had to re-check with him after I had thought about this a 
while, I now that a few List-Members have thrown Rods out their 2.1 
engines and have been looking for good cores.  Here's the info you 
people have been needing to see!  Unless we have inside connections, WE 
(consumers) don't find out about things like this!!!

  I hope this helps someone out in the VW world, I know I'll be using 
this info at some point.

  I'm more fortunate than most to have the connections that I do, but 
I'm not Selfish with the info that can and will help others.

  Kyle
