Subject: More fuel to the fire(was mail header suggestions)

All,

I think we need to have a printed list(to be kept on our person at all time,
under threat of imprisonment, in a locked room with Steve Maher talking about
his V6anagon ;-)) with everybodies name, e-mail address and what he/she drives
then we would not need to mess around with special subject lines

;-)

Cheers,

David
