&gt;And more important than anything, I'm seeking Lexan headlight covers to
&gt;hopefully avoid costly replacement of those snazzy '91 headlights.
&gt;
&gt;Sources and prices for these items used or new would be appreciated.
&gt;
&gt; Hi:
     A good source for headlight protection is Groit's Garage in Tacoma Wa.
They have a mailorder catalog and one of the items they have is a plastic
mat-like material with stick-um on the back. You just cut the shape of the
headlight out of the mat and stick it on to the headlight. I use it on my
lights and it works well. I havn't noticed any dimming of the headlights
because of it and it is supposed to be able to shed a pellet fired at it at
20 feet.
 My Tristar came with lexan covers that clip on. They are nicely contoured
to fit and have four thin white lines drawn across them for style. They look
good but one of them is cracked and I would like to replace it. There are
numbers on it: CLC-VWV86 and 19704. It also says MADE IN AUSTRALIA  on the
edge and VOLKSWAGEN on the front. The dealer I talked to dosn't know a thing
about them. Anybody?
One thing about the clip on cover VS the stick on covers is that dirt gets
behind the clip ons and doesn't affect the stick on cover.
