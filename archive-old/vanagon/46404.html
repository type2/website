Subject: Re: Go with the split (NOT)

Well, it's not up to any of us (save Gerry) but I have a feeling 
that the people who are cheering because they think their 
incoming mail is going to be reduced will be quite disappointed.  
I've only been on the list for 10 months or so but I figure that 
each list will get about 80-90% of the volume that this one does.  
Of course this means that people who don't want the split will 
get 160-180% of the current volume ;-(
