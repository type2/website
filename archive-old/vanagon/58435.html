Subject: Add-A-Room

For David Radcliff:

You asked about the &quot;Add-A-Room&quot; ...

I have/had that and here's my two cents. (In no particular priority 
sequence)

	The expense was a bit more than I had originally expected.
	The installation requires one to have an awning with fixed
	  equipment mounted above the passenger/cargo door.
	The Add-A-Room (I had) &quot;created&quot;/required an actual room
	  (need the space for) of the size of the awning (mine was
	  approx. 9'x8'). Where you park becomes a consideration.
	Whlie in transport mode, need to make space for four long poles
	  plus a bag (parts/pieces) about the size of an overnighter,
	  about 5 lbs. (no big deal).
	Assembly COULD be accomplished by one person
	  -&gt;WITH DETERMINATION&lt;-, but normally 'needs' two people.
	The pieces, other than the awning, include two side units &amp;
	  a long, front unit.
	The front piece slides into a channel on the end of the awning
	  (like the rain channel on the van).
	The side pieces slide onto poles which are then connected into
	  fittings on the van and at the extended-ends of the awning.
	Once in place, the three pieces are then zippered together to
	  create the room.
	The room, at that point, has flexibility to allow privacy
	  curtains to be rolled-up and out of the way. There are screens
	  to hold back critters! The curtains can be selectively
	  rolled in any combination (two in front, one on each side) for
	  aunshade etc. There's a separate zippered door/entry access!
	The side units must be 'secured' to the van, somehow, to complete
	  the closure (this was my first shock, the installer drilled
	  holes into the sides of my van &amp; placed fasteners, I had no
	  idea, back then).
	There are pieces to cover the space beneath the van doors and
	  over/around the wheel well.
	Once assembled you have a side tent that looks great and is
	  functional!
	Set-up/take-down will take about 15-20 minutes.
	A BIG disadvantage, however, is you give up freemdom of moving
	  the vehicle while the unit is 'up', it goes with the vechile!
	We learned several 'lessons' while using ours.
	  It is V E R Y convenient, if you are completely stationary!
	  It's a nuisance if you plan to use the vehile for sporadically.
	  It's great for added space and a room, as described (we rested
	  in it, slept in it, changed clothes in privacy, etc., etc.)
	  It's comfortable, like the van, warm at night, cool in day!
	  The van's ventilation system extended to the room.
	We used ours for two years and loved it, as long as we
	  'conformed' to the limitations.
	We survived several heavy rains (the flat roof required 'forcing'
	  the water outwards). The method used to create a closure
	  between the van/awning/sides must be considered carefully or
	  one must deal with water leakage/runn-off.
	We realized that a tarp or some type of flooring was needed.
	We eventually &quot;lost/gave-up&quot; the idea of using the entire unit
	  after we went touring/sight-seeing and left the sides up with
	  only the awning extended. A heavy wind got under it and twisted 
	  the frame(s) badly. We couldn't get it repaired, tried
	  several dealers. The option was to purchase another awning
	  unit (costly)!!
    We are now looking for a side tent.

   If this does not turn you off, wanna buy a slightly used Add-A-Room?
   All you'd need then would be is the awning!! ;-)

Hope this is informative and helps!

Regards,
