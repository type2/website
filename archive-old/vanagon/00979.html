Subject: How to get to stuff on camper luggage rack?




Greetings again,

First, thanks to everyone who responded to my query about fixing the
fuel inlet on my Solex carb, the epoxy seems to be holding but I had
some good suggestions about what to do in case it fails.

Now a new question.  How do you camper owners get up to your luggage
rack on top of the bus/vanagon?  I was putting some stuff up there
last night and used a step stool but I don't really want to haul
the step stool around.  I can get to the back of the rack by standing
on the bumper and I can get to the front by popping the top and
unziping the big rear-facing window but the sides are a problem.
Has anyone added steps or a ladder to make this easier?  Any other
suggestions?

Thanks for any ideas,
