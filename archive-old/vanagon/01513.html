Subject: ATF in the oil, postscript

Postscript to cleaning the engine by putting automatic transmission fluid
in the oil...

My mechanic Jim told me that what he does when an engine is really dirty is
to change the oil and filter but put in two quarts of diesel fuel instead of 
oil, and the rest oil.  He told me that then you can't drive it, but you run
it on idle for half an hour.  Then you drain the oil and replace it with
regular oil but with about a quart of automatic transmission fluid, again
changing the filter.  Then you drive it for 20 miles or so, and finally
replace the oil and filter one last time, this time just oil.  (But when
Jim changes the oil, he puts in an additive that he swears by called 
KO8 -- Anybody heard of it?)

I realize that for this group all this is academic since nobody around here
ever lets his/her oil get that bad.

Jim recommends an oil change every 2500 miles, whereas the owner's manual
says every 7500 miles.  What are some opinions about this?
