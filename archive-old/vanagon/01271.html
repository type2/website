Subject: loose wipers

Now that a few of you have brought the subject up, I remember to ask if
anyone has ever found a solution to loose wipers.  The splines seem to have
worn just enough to slip a little no matter how tight I fasten the wiper
arms.  I've thought of drilling a hole for a set screw, but I don't think I
want to weaken the system.  Some sort of metal epoxy seems a little too
permanent, but maybe something like hot glue might work...

My 72 Super Beetle had the same problem, but I tightened the bolts often,
and the cat couldn't climb up and loosen the wipers.
