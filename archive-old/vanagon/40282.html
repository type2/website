&gt;&gt;No overrunning required-- they're quite happy to get rich selling it to 
us.
&gt;&gt;Everybody wins... until the oil runs out. By then we'll have developed
&gt;&gt;workable electric cars, and will be in the position that the oil countries
&gt;&gt;are in now. Except that we'll have gotten there, by sweating our brains
&gt;&gt;out in and R&amp;D effort, not by accidently finding ourselves over dead
&gt;&gt;dinosaurs' graves.
&gt;
&gt;And where will we get the electricity? Electricty is not a fuel, it is
&gt;an energy transport media!


Hydroelectric, solar, nuclear (fission and fusion). The most plentiful,
cleanest, and safest &quot;fuels&quot; ever developed.

Also coal burners in isolated areas, with one large scrubber instead
of fifty million little catalytic converters.

VW Content: You can buy, today, an electric motor that plugs directly
into your Bug or Bus's transmission housing and shaft. Batteries are
still too heavy, tho.

 &quot;Tax the rich, subsidize the poor.&quot;
 &quot;From each according to his means, to each according to his needs.&quot;
 Any Questions?
