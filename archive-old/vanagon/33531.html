Subject: Camping World Pop-Up Camper Accessories Catalog

I just got a sale catalog in the mail from camping world.  They are a 
mail-order RV parts company.  The are coming out with a pop-top camper 
catalog in April 1996.  To request a copy of the catalog call 
800.865.6899 and ask for the Pop-Up, Truck, &amp; Van Camper Accessories 
Catalog.
