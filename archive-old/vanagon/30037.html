Subject: Update the database

Joel, its time to update your database. I'm now the owner of a '95 EuroVan
Camper. This one took a lot of thought, test driving, q&amp;a with lots of list
members (thanks all), q&amp;a with VW reps, as well as convincing myself that
it was worthwhile to spend so much money on such a vehicle. So far I think
it was. No buyers remorse.

I still have my '80 camper, but I've decided to pass it on to someone else
who appreciates such a  vehicle. Not sure how much of a loss I'll take on
it yet, but at least I can say its in much better shape than it was when I
received it!
(This is good 'carma' right?)  It was a fun car and I certainly learned a
lot while figuring out its quirks.
(And if anyone is interested, let me know. I'll be cleaning it up and
getting it ready to sell over the next couple of weekends.)

Some comments for you would-be EV owners:
- the fit and finish on the interior rivals that of the Westfalias I've
examined. Frankly the design is pretty much the same, except they added a
grey-
water tank and a furnace. This thing is nice.
- although I haven't wound out the engine yet (breakin period you know) I
can say that even with the camper installation it's got plenty of power. It
may take 20 secs to get 0-60 but it doesn't have any problem getting there
and beyond.
Hell, I can even accelerate while going uphill at 50 mph!
- these things are available for significantly under MSRP, particularly
here in the PNW (where we have the highest 'Type 2' per capita ratio in
North America I think!) I got mine as an 'end-of-month' deal, mainly
because they had one with everything I wanted (5-spd, ABS, opt seat,
furnace) but the end of the year is coming up soon.
- in Seattle area, I went to Carter Volkswagen. These guys were some of the
most laid-back yet professional car dealers that I've ever met. None of the
arm-twisting, none of the gauntlet of folks trying to sell you stuff. Hell,
I did the whole deal over the phone, setup the bank loan over the phone,
then went in the next day and picked it up. (And if you go there, the Van
expert seems to be Scott Taylor - he has a 914 and works on its engine a
lot too!)

some questions for you existing EV owners:
- how did you do the breakin? I'm planning on draining oil &amp; trans fluid
after about 1200 miles. Not winding it out until about 600 miles. The
dealer recommended NOT using detergent oil until the first 'scheduled' oil
change at 7500 miles. I don't quite understand this - I could see not using
synthetic for awhile but why should detergent oil cause a problem with
this?
- Mine was manufactured in March 95, I don't know when the conversion was
done. But the thing sat on the showroom floor for awhile and I think the
camper battery is suffering because of it. How long does this thing take to
charge on your vehicle? What is the LED reading you get a full charge? I'm
letting it charge overnight on 110V to see what kind of difference that
makes.
- any experience with the various fabric protectants out there? Is it worth
going to a detail shop and letting them use silicon gunk, or is ScotchGuard
sufficient?
- I'm figuring Maguiars wax, although my M5-owning neighbor recommends
their &quot;Pro line&quot; which requires a 2-step process. Any other
recommendations?
- the book shows a bunch of optional equipment - screens, awnings, rooms
(?!), etc. Any experience with any of these? I'd like to put an awning and
a sliding door screen on it. Any recommendations?
- finally, they *did* offer me an 'extended warranty' deal, through GE I
think. I told them I'd think about it. My initial reaction is that this
would just be a waste of money. But there *are* a lot more things in this
thing to break. I'm wondering if any of you have experience with this. Did
you wish you bought it? Or are you sorry you wasted your money on it?

Soon as I get it out somewhere scenic, I'll update my Web page (although
since these things all look the same...)

later,
-rick
