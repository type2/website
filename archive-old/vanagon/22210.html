&gt;Even then the alternator will probably be okay.  You cannot hurt your

&gt;alternator by hooking it to a battery that is &quot;too large&quot;.  An
&gt;alternator is merely a bunch of wire spinning around (inside of a
&gt;magnetic field).  It is very hard to hurt it.  If you're going to worry
&gt;about something, worry about your cylinder heads.  :)

whilst
happily mig welding for an hour or two. Try it for fun kiddies!!
