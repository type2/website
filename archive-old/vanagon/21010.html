Subject: Washing the motor
Date: Tue, 18 Jul 1995 09:21:54 -0500 (CDT)

I have the motor out of my bus and it is sitting on the floor in all of 
its greasy glory.  About the only thing from it that is going onto the
new motor is the generator and the tin.  I didn't get a chance to run 
it to the carwash before I got started because it wasn't exactly in 
running condition.  I am wondering if I could throw this thing in the 
back of my dad's truck and take it to the carwash.  I wonder about 
that flywheel and stuff sitting there.  It doesn't look like it would 
like to get wet.  I just figured I could save my garage floor from a 
bunch of this gunk if I were to get it off of there before I started 
removing the tin.  Oh, while I am on the subject, where do you people 
find that citrus based cleaner stuff.  My FLAPS just has the very 
nasty solvent based stuff.  Thanks, Jim
