So Commodore Harris sez:
&gt;
&gt;I was wondering if anybody had any experience with towing any VW bus or
&gt;truck.  I am seriously considering buying an old 1958 split window
&gt;doublecab.  It is in pretty rough shape at the moment.  I am currently at
&gt;college, and would like to tow it home (about 600 miles away).  Where could
&gt;I get a tow bar cheap? (uhaul?)  How much strain would the VW put on the

You could tow it to my house! :) :) :)
