Subject:      Fan inside fridge that runs on D cells.

Hello--

Sorry if this is a no-brainer. But if there's any of you that don't know
there are self powered small fans that sit inside the fridge, and for me it's
worked great.

The little blue fan runs about $14 in the JC Whitney or Camper's World
catalogue and runs on 2 D cell batteries. It's made a huge difference in the
overall cooling in my fridge. Ultimately I'd like to mount a permanent fan
inside, but till then this works great.

(I should add my fridge makes ice. But honestly I think the fan has little to
do with that. I'm just bragging.)
