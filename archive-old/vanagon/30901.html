Subject: The color of your smoke (was '79 bus...grounded again)

plima_at_indirect_dot_com wrote about blue smoke from the exhaust:

&gt;evidently I'm told it IS oil, not an over-rich carb.

According to the book Weber Carburators(I cannot remember who the author
is at this time). Blue smoke is due to an over-rich carb, black is due
to oil (the colors are hard to distinguish sometimes), and white is due
to a head gasket leak.  The author made a special note to be sure
whether the color is blue or black before adjusting the carb, as black
means the oil is burning.

Cheers,

David

79 Westy - black smoke = burning oil = rebuild soon = empty wallet :-(
