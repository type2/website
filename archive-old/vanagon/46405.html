&gt; &gt;the craft.  This hasn't just affected van owners:  What are the cars from
&gt; &gt;the late 80s and early 90s that people are messing with for fun?  Are
&gt; &gt;there any?
&gt; 
&gt; There are.  My '87 fuel-injected, computer-brained Mustang has gone under
&gt; the wrench several times, and never to replace something that broke.  I
&gt; modify it so it will turn faster and accelerate harder at the track.
&gt; Definately something I do for fun.  Of course, there's a whole 'nother
&gt; mailing list that I subscribe to just for this purpose.  There are a lot of
&gt; parallels to this list, including a pretty strong community spirit.

This is also true of the Miata list. People there are changing
everything from ignition timing and exhaust bits to installing turbos,
superchargers, and any manner of suspension modifications, in addition
to figuring out how to fit very large stereos into a very small
car. In many cases, changing equipment on a new car is easier than in
the old days. Most manufacturers of speed equipment get their products
apporved by CARB, which makes it legal almost anywhere.

And I haven't even mentioned the wacky banter and bad jokes that
are present there too, along with the seemingly endless newbie
questions and subscribe messages.

&gt; I don't think the list splitting will be the end of the vanagon_at_lenti
&gt; community, but if it were my choice I would leave it as a single list, and
&gt; those people who cannot or will not learn how to effectively handle their
&gt; e-mail can leave.  Boy do I sound grumpy today or what?  :-)

It's all part of being on a list. If you want the info, ya gotta slog
through the trash, or teach your computer to do it for you.
