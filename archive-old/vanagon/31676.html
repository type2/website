Subject: Old Bus Review/Wannabusers

Wannabusers:

The NEATO newsletter &quot;Old Bus Review&quot; should be hitting mail
boxes in the not-too-distant future.  I just finished typing
the For Sale ads for it.  FYI, 21 split-window buses, 7-bay
window and  2-Vanagons are listed for sale all over the USA.

I saw a few names familiar to the list (Yes, Jon and
Michael, you're in there).

And no, I don't give out &quot;early bird&quot; previews.  If you
REALLY wanted that bus, you would have already sent in your
membership dues.
