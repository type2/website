Subject:      Looking for info from up north of TN

I recently test drove a nice looking Syncro from PA.
The body was beautiful.  But when I raised the deck lid the motor
compartment was covered with rust and corrosion.   Is this common in
cars from the north.   I was certain I was going to purchase the Van
until I found the rust and corrosion.  The few mechanics I spoke with
said every nut and bolt on the underside of the van will be rusted
solid.  Are they correct?

These vans are hard to find.  I don't want to miss out a good deal.
Someone with rust and corrosion fighting experience please give me some
helpful information.  At this point I am afraid I will  Have to pass on
the Van ??????
