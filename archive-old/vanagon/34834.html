&gt; &gt;POSTAGE:
&gt; &gt; for up to 7 stickers, use one 32-cent stamp
&gt; &gt; for 8-15, use two 32-cent stamps
&gt; &gt; and add stamps for additional stickers.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Non-USA orders, please send an extra $3.00 for postage. (in USA cash)
&gt;
&gt; Hmm, let's see, 32 cents for a stamp, but send $3.00 for postage. &quot;Poor
&gt; Richard&quot; won't be poor for long.
&gt;
&gt; Richard, perhaps you should rephrase that to &quot;overseas orders&quot;, because,
&gt; Canada just happens to be stuck on your northern frontier and isn't as
&gt; furrin' as you may think. Typically, postage costs more between Canada &amp;
&gt; the U.S., but usually in the order of 20 cents, or maybe two first class
&gt; stamps, I do not remember, but cetainly not $3.00.
&gt;
&gt; How about if the Canadians sent you a self addressed envelope and a US buck
&gt; for postage? Sound fair?
&gt;
Hmm, it seems that this whole sticker mess just gets stickier and stickier...
I charge $3.00 for non-USA orders to cover not only actual postal costs, but
time as well. For USA orders, I will simply place the stickers in the return
envelope, and drop it in the mailbox. For all others, I will have to get up off
my lazy rear, and go to the post office to mail them. Not much of a hassle you
say? Consider the Post Office's operating hours. They are, unfortunately,
within the hours that I am at work. Therefore, to go to the post office, I have
to take off from work. I have to clear this with my boss, and fill out
paperwork. I also ride my bike to work, so I will not have to pay $200 for a
parking sticker. Therefore, I have to take off enough time to ride my bike
home, and then go to the post office, which makes for at least an hour and a
half...
While I realize that $3.00 might seem like a lot, there is reason behind it. If
there were 100 or 50 or really even 20 non-USA orders, then perhaps I could not
justify the extra cost. But, as of yesterday, there are 8 such orders, which
makes for a pretty high average cost.
I certainly do not wish to be annoying, or appear greedy, I just wanted to make
known my reasons for the postage costs...Thanks.
BTW, the stickers *should* be going out next week, barring another blizzard or
some other lame excuse...
Thanks.
