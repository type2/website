Subject: Vanagon rear speakers (in the AC unit)

I want to replace the factory installed rear speakers on my '87.  These are
mounted up in the AC unit.  What's gonna happen when I remove the (rear-most)
cover?  Will the AC components fall on my head?  Is there anything I need
to be forewarned about?  Thanks in advance ...
