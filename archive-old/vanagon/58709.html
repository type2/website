&gt;  &lt;&lt; Anyway, I am a brand new Vanagon owner and am wondering what the 
&gt; differences are between an '87 GL and an '87 Wolfsburg. What makes it a &gt;
Wolfsburg? &gt;&gt;
&gt;  
&gt;  Jim - you can have this one.....  :&lt;)

Here's the deal.......and then some:

Yes &amp; no.  With regard to models produced for the USA, I have the following:
In the mid 1987 model year VW introduced its line-up of Wolfsburg Limited
Edition cars that included a version of the Vanagon GL.  Vanagon Wolfsburgs
were also available in 1984-1986 but were considerably different than the
later ones.  Most of the distinguishing things that make up any Wolfsburg
edition (whether it be a Golf, Jetta, Vanagon, etc.) are cosmetic changes
(like special paint colors) and certain options becoming standard on the
Wolfsburg (like alloy wheels).  With the 1987 Vanagon, VW put a little twist
on its normal offerings and included a special interior arrangement that (for
lack of a better name) I call &quot;Wolfsburg seating&quot;.  This included a rear
bench that folds to a bed, a fold-up table on the driver's side wall and two
rear-facing bucket seats, in place of the 2-passenger front-facing center
bench.  These seats are located direclty behind the driver and front seat
passenger and have fold-up bottom cushions like theater seats.  Upholstery on
these seats was light gray pinstripe velour.  Between the cushions of the
front seats &amp; the rear-facing seats, a little storage tray snaps in.  For
maximum versatility, each of these seats can easily be removed by pulling up
on a little knob and lifting the seat out.

The 1987 Wolfsburg was popular enough (by Vanagon terms) to do it again in
1988.  The 1988 Vanagon GL Wolfsburg Limited Edition was nearly identical to
the 1987.  Upholstery on these seats was again, light gray pinstripe velour.
Customers from all around flocked to VW showrooms (well 3 or 4 came anyway)
and in 1989 VW introduced the Vanagon Carat, a model that had this seating
style all model year long. Upholstery on these seats was again, light gray
pinstripe velour.  Also in 1989 VW had a Wolfsburg edition Vanagon - it had a
bold diagonal stripe upholstery pattern.  Other Vanagons with this seating
style included the 90 &amp; 91 Multivan &amp; Carat with medium gray velour
upholstery with pinstripes &amp; little squares and basic Vanagon that had a
course tweed gray upholstery.

Carats were made from 1989 to 1991.  While their equipment varied a little in
each of the years they were all top of the line Vanagons in the non-Syncro,
non-Westy sense.  They were all 2WD, no pop-top models, mostly produced with
automatic transmissions.  I think 1990 &amp; 1991 they may have only came with
automatic transmissions.

Hope this tidbit helps,
