Subject: GEX advice, et al.

It looks as though GEX may be the source of the replacement engine for Utta
(80 westfeelya)  Does anybody have any thoughts?  I got a good quote and a
discount for being a 'jobber' (which just means I get to work on cars all day
long AND get paid for it!)  After reading some hoover sermons, I'm rethinking
the quick pull of the coming parts vanagon engine and using it for a winter
rebuilding/ zen / meditation project. and below, my 2 scents worth....
On the 'mom and pop' issue.  While mail order has been ok, (I like to see and
touch what I'm going to buy), here in Richmond both the Bug House (FLAPS),
and Agee's Bicycles will sell at or very close to big mail order prices
either voluntarily or with a little prodding.  Those of us who live in
isolated areas should make friends with a firm (like Ron's) and put faith in
them.  Developing a relationship is the key. BTDT.
AND finally.... If I am not mistaken, the intro letter to the list said
something about copying ONLY enough information to provide context.  Scrolling
 through the same posting fifteen times is getting old, so please.......drive
safe and slow! patrick
