Vanagonians!

I just wanted to send yuz a hearty thanks for fixed my mount.  Billy-Rae (82
Bunker Burner) was getting alittle cranky.  If you recall he was smoking up
the neighborhood during cool start with cloud of blue-white smoke.  The
collective felt it was probably a bad injector.  Well I bought one and put it
in my tool box.  The other day ol Billy-Rae wouldn't start.  No big deal just
change out some glow plugs. I remembered back to the collectives
recommendation to pull the fuel injectors and look in the hole to see if the
plugs are glowing.  Well I pulled the injectors, gave the glow plugs some
juice, looked in the hole and found that two glow plugs were toast.  I also
discovered that one of the injectors had &quot;oil&quot; all over it and down inside
(between the heat shield and the injector nozzle).  At first I thought it was
motor oil from a crack in the head, however, under closer examination I
noticed the color of the oil was the same as new motor oil.  So it wasn't
motor oil but &quot;coagulated&quot; Diesel.  I replaced that injector with the one I
had bought and the problem was solved.  Killed two birds with one stone and
almost no hassles.  Its super easy to replace glow plugs with the injectors
out.  Now she purrs, if one can say that about Diesels.  Thats a bunch!
