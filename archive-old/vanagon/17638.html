Ok, I'm going to try this audiovox alarm and assume that the cooling fan
in the refrigerator doesn't draw enough current to trigger the alarm. I'll
post the results. I'm even more convinced to do something after reading the 
article in Backpacker magazine last night about trailhead vehicle break-ins.

I too bought the Camping World refrigerator fan. Went to Myrtle Beach and got
the in store sale price of $15 (oh-boy). It does seem to last a month on two d-cells
and doesn't take up too much room. 

In the way of other refrigerator toys, I bought some expandable rods that go in
the refrigerator to keep the food from moving too much and I bought a digital
thermometer with a remote sensor so I can see the refrigerator temperature right
on the dash.

Because we're about to spend a month in the camper I've done a few other things
to make it more comfortable/convienent. I pulled the front plastic piece off the dash
that is right in front of the stick (covers heating vents and hoses) and mounted
two cupholders, a CB (with weather band) and the refrigerator temp remote display.
We put seat back stuff holders on the back of both front seats (from Autoshade). 
I built an awning with two wood dowels, a joiner, an 8x10 tarp, two spring clamps and two
telescoping legs (from REI). I wrap the dowels in one end of the tarp and put it
in the rain gutter and then secure at both ends with the spring clamps. The other
end is held up with the legs and rope with tent stakes. Works great for shade.
Tinted the windows to reduce greenhouse effect (we're going to the SouthWest) and
put one of those Fresnel lenses in the back window so I don't customize the
rear bumper backing up.

Just got 4 new Michelin MXL 205/70 14's (reinforced) to handle the extra load. They
were $83 (not including mounting and balancing) at Western Auto.

Hope this wasn't too boring :)
