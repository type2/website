Subject: Re: runs lean / runs rich ?

&gt;I'll bet a dollar that counts as running rich...
&gt;_______________________________________________________________________________
&gt;Also, how do you determine if the engine &quot;runs lean&quot; or &quot;runs rich?&quot; The
&gt;black carbon deposits on the plugs of my '71 Super is an indication of
&gt;one or the other, right?
&gt;
&gt;SAK
&gt;
Yes the black deposits indicate rich running, but it depends when you pull
the plugs. If you pull the plugs after idle it would indicate rich idle
(sometimes you need this to prevent off idle bogging.If you run the car at
speed and cut the motor before you pull the plugs it will give you an 
indication of main jets.Leaking needle and seat or bad float can cause
rich running. We use an exhust gas analyzer to determine this problem.
Don't rule out a tired motor.I've seen too many premature carb rebuilds
while ignoring the basics.
