Subject: Aux Gas Tanks

&gt;The purpose of this posting is to ask if anyone knows of this space being
&gt;used for auxiliary fuel tanks, and to invite comments on auxiliary fuel tanks
&gt;in general.

I have often thought about an auxiliary tank for my vanagon Westy. Since I
also ride BMW motorcycles, I have met several riders from the Reno NV area
that have installed 4 to 5 gallon aux fuel cells on their bikes. The tanks
are race-car construction, with hex cell internal baffles to prevent
sloshing. This is probably over-kill for a van, but with a long, flat tank
that would fit between the main frame structure, a fore and aft slosh
preventer would be nice. I havn't figured out if the aux tank  should just
fill from and pump back into the main tank, or if another filler neck and a
feed to a control valve further down the fuel line  would be better.
Another 10 - 12 gallons  would be quite useful on long trips.
