To All:

Okay, okay.  I'll tell ya how to keep warm in your van in the winter.  But
it's going to cost you.

Take out a window.  If you got a panel, read on.

Make a metal window to replace the glass window.  Cut a 3&quot; diameter hole in
the metal window before you mount it.  Buy a 3&quot; vent elbow and a two foot
section of galvanized iron smoke stack, 3&quot; in diameter.  Get a conical cap
for the top.  Rivet the elbow to the metal window approximately where you cut
the 3&quot; hole.  Install the stove pipe onto the elbow.  Both of these pieces
should be OUTSIDE the bus.  Drill two holes in your rain gutter and make
guy-wires to hold the stovepipe in position when you're driving.  Install the
conical cap to keep the rain, snow and birds out of the stove pipe.  Make a
little brace out of wire to keep the smoke stack away from the side of the
bus.  Heavy wire.  No, heavier than that.

This concludes the Stove Pipe instructions.

Making the Stove.

Go find an air filter for an early bus or Ghia, the kind that mounted off to
one side.  Cut/trim the air inlet so you can hammer the thing closed, but
leave the air pipe fitting that goes into the bottom.  Block off the
crankcase vent fitting that goes into the top.  Tear out the coif filter
element and toss it.  Cut the straight part of the air cleaner's outlet pipe
so you can wedge it into the stovepipe elbow you've riveted to your metal
window.  Drill four holes in the metal window near the corners.  Rig guy
wires to the air cleaner elbow.  You figure it out but the idea is to have
the air cleaner sort of hanging in space when you get done and fairly sturdy.

Wash all the oil out of the bottom of the air cleaner.  The bottom part is
now your stove.

Score some flexible metal tubing.  I used electrical stuff but there's real
stuff available.  Make a piece to fit onto the air inlet you left on the
bottom of the air cleaner's air inlet horn, the thing on which you hammered
shut the opening of.  Drill a hole in your metal window for the other end of
your flexible metal pipe.  Or in the fender well.  Or the side of the bus.
 That is your fresh air inlet.  It feeds air to your stove.  If you get the
high quality flexible metal pipe you can squeeze it almost flat without
hurting it.  That is your draft control.  If you're a handy sort you may even
want to put a metal valve in it.  Make it look like a little throttle valve.

Loading the Stove.

The air cleaner fastens together with four metal clips.  Unclip them.  Put
some sand in the bottom of the air cleaner, about half an inch.  Then some
newspaper, then some sticks, then some charcoal briquettes.  Set the paper on
fire and put the top on your stove then press the top against the air cleaner
elbow and fasten the four clips before you get burned or set the camper on
fire.  If I can do it, you can do it.  Wait until the fire is going good then
connect your flexible metal hose.  

You now have a wood/charcoal/coal/old magazine-burning stove hanging in space
inside your bus.  If you touch it, you will die.  In about ten minutes the
interior of your bus will be at least 100 degrees, Celsius or Fahrenheit,
doesn't matter.  Hot.  

If you decide on who should be Pope, throw in damp straw to make white smoke.

People will laugh when they see you drive by.

PS -- You must be seriously cold or slightly crazy or a bit of both to try
this.  Oddly enough, it works like a charm.  Keep oven mits handy for
refueling.  If you build it right you can heat water on the air inlet horn.

Post PS -- Everyone who builds one of my heaters owes me at least a buck,
mebbe more, 10% of which will go to the O.J.Simpson Defense fund.  (What do
you mean, he got off?  No, see, I've been on this crazy trip and haven't seen
the papers or TV or nothing.  Seriously?)

Post P-PS -- Never mind about the 10%.
