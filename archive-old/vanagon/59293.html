Subject: Two newbie questions

I found an '88 westie Gl for sale that I'm in the process of purchasing. I
have three
questions that the group may be able to answer.

The van has 100K miles and the PO just had a coolant leak repaired (Heads
were cracked and were rebuilt &amp; valve lifters were replaced.)  How reliable
are the rebuilt heads? How long will a repair like this normally last?

Has anyone tried towing a small trailer behind a vanagon? (1500lbs 250lbs
toungue weight) Does anyone offer a hitch for vanagons? 

I saw no leaks on the engine, but did notice what seemed to be a metalic
jingle from the exhaust system - any guesses what that might be?

thanks!
