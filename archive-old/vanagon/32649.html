&gt; Hiya! Going thru the local classifieds this a.m., came across a gas
&gt; heater for a thing, $200. Anyone know how much chance of adapting this to
&gt; my bus there is?           Put down the paper and back away slowly and no one will get 
hurt.  I spent many hours trying to bring my gas heater back from the 
dead.  With all of the sensors and exhaust pipes and the danger of 
having something burning an explosive fuel sitting in your lap, should 
be enough to disuade you.  If that isn't enough, you can find a 12V 
electric heater that is considerably more efficient and safe.  If 
someone is advertising the heater, it probably doesn't work anyway.  I 
finally got mine to work and sold it to some slobbering VWphile for his 
vintage bug.  I know use the space for my stereo amps and tape storage.
