RE: Hair-trigger wimps who enact silly regulations:

In my wife's '94 M*zda Protege, I once wanted to roll it back about
three feet, to change the oil. No problem-- pop the tranny into
neutral, release the brake, and give it a push, right? Noooooooo...
you can't pop the tranny into neutral unless you first place a foot
FIRMLY on the brake pedal. Why? Because about 50 brain-dead Audi
drivers, years ago, couldn't tell the accelerator from the brake.

Well, they got their lumps, and learned their lesson thru the old
School of Hard Knocks, just like the rest of us, right? Noooooooo...
somehow, they blamed _the car_... AND THE HAIR-TRIGGER WIMPS BELIEVED
THEM!

The Fedrl Gummint then proceeded to change ALL CARS with auto trannies,
requiring trans/brake interlocks on what used to be (for good reason)
independent systems... and guess who gets to pay for them! As well as
finding them in the way when you actually want to _use_ the car.

Well, (sigh) so I took off my greasy overalls (smudging the SO s new
seats brings the death penalty), sat in the seat, pressed a foot
firmly on the brake pedal. Pushed the button on the tranny lever,
pulled it back, and... nada. Doesn t move. Still locked in Park.

Why? It won t move unless the engine is actually running. Grrrrr...

Get out of the car, go inside, find the key to the M*zda. Back to
the garage, sit in the seat, pressed a foot firmly on the brake pedal.
Leave the driver s door open since I m going to get right out again
in two seconds. Key in the ignition, start the engine (I d really rather
all the oil had stayed in the pan for this service item... sigh)...
...and get nearly strangled as the automatic seat belt zips up to
its &quot;fastened&quot; position at the top of the door, which, being open,
pulls the belt right across my throat. Grrrrr...

Finally, with door closed, belt properly in place, foot firmly on
the brake, flight plan filed, and the appropriate authorities notified,
I accomplish the feat of shifting the car OUT OF PARK, and move it back
three feet in the garage. Hey, Steve, a certified bennie-- since you
had the engine running, you didn t have to push the car! You didn t
even have to move the shift lever two whole notches--- just one, into
reverse! See... it was all worthwhile after all.

...NOT.

BTW, I don t know about you, but I have always worn seat belts, ever
since my Driver Training instructor insisted on it. I m so used to
having them on, that it feels like you re missing something without
them. But when this automatic belt zips into place, I say: &quot;Well, now
I m belted in! How nice&quot;, and I drive away... blissfully forgetting to
fasten the lap belt. Yup, due to M*zda s mandate to protect me from my
own stupidity in not wearing seat belts (Uh, but Mom, I _DO_ wear them),
I now wear belts LESS than I used to! Yes, I know, now I m the one who s
stupid, not remembering that lap belt. But, I thought I had this covered,
like for the last 25 years! Big Brother, would you please stop doing me
these favors?

Anyone else??? Your tax dollars at work...


Oh, yes-- VW content? Well, none of this sh*t ever happens with my
'71 bus!

And the band plays on. Stay tuned for the next installation. In the
crosshairs: The center-mounted third brake light!
