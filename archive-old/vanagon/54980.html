Subject: Cool Transporter Picture

Hi all: I was just thumbing through the new VW Trends (march 97) and on
page 81 there is a picture of a three door Transporter all painted up
for Rallye use. The article is about the cars in the VW museum. I would
like to see a clearer shot of the transporter and it's history would be
interesting.   Todd Francis
