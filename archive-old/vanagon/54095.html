&gt; I've seen 12v submersible pumps in that catalog.  Try looking for &quot;RV
&gt; pumps&quot;.
&gt; 
&gt; I've not tried ordering anything from them, yet, so can offer no comments
&gt; about their service, etc.

I may have mentioned this a while back, but when my submersible pump 
went out on my Westy, I replaced it with a bilge pump purchased from 
Wal-Mart.   I think it was a 300 gallon per hour model (the smallest)  
The water hose to the Vanagon just happened to be a perfect press fit on 
the water pump's fitting.  The pump only cost $9.95 and 2 years later 
it's still working great.
