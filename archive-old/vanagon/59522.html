&gt; 
&gt;    Volkswagen of America, 1997 Volkswagen EuroVan manufactured between
&gt; August and Nov. '96 (201 vehicles)    NHTSA recall # 97V016001, VW
&gt; campaign # SL.
&gt; 
&gt;     The models are unfinished campers produced by VW and finished by
&gt; Winnebago industries.  During the installation of the camper equipment,
&gt; an improperly adjusted power tool drill bit punctured the fuel tank vapor
&gt; cannister.  This can allow fuel vapors to escape and could cause a fire.
&gt; VW dealers, on behalf of Winnebago, will check the fuel vapor container
&gt; for the defect and replace the fuel tank if necessary.
