Howdy....

We took our van in to get the fridge fixed since it wouldn't ignite or the 
green light would flicker.  The dealer (OWASCO near toronto) changed the 
thormo coupler and adjusted the flame.  

Altitude problem....
I was told by the helpful manager that winabago said the fridge 
may/would/could not at altitudes above 5000 ft.  Was told to either plug frige 
in or run it on the battery.  This to me is unsatisfactory.  They also said to 
leave the window behind the fridge openned for ventalation.

Main Beef....
No where in the manuals or brochures does it say that it will not run at 
altitude.  This is unfair.  Apparently,m in the 1997's it is an option to put 
in the high altitude kit for about 100 cdn.

Story continues....
I told the manager to install the kit and i would pay for it.  Then i would do 
battle with Winabago, VW and norcold.  I was told that Winnabago would 
consider putting in the kit for people living in mountainous regions.  Hey, 
but, that is where i travel to!!!!

Limbo....
Got another call from the manager.  They have ordered the parts and now they 
are considering (Winabago) what action they will take.  The manager seem 
hopeful.  

Bottom Line...

We should have been told when we boughtthe van that i would not work at 
altitude.  If i had known about this before hand i would have grumbled but 
they would have been dealing with me upfront.

The other effect is we had to cut our trip short since the fridge wouldn't 
work and the van has been in theshop for a week.

PS...I will keep you posted.
