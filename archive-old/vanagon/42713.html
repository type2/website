Subject: Head Temp Sender

I'm still searching for ideas to fix my '80 Vanagon. The head temp sender
fell out of the head. The threads inside the head have stripped. I've got a
couple of ideas on how to fix this, but I need to know more about how this
system works. I can find no mention of it in my Bentley manual. 

Does this thing need to conduct electricity? Does it provide a ground? Is it
a simple on or off situation, or does it decrease or increase in resistance
as it warms up? What are the temps to be expected on a normally operating 2
liter head? 

My thought is to squirt some of that loctite thread repair stuff in the
hole, and screw the thing in. If it needs to conduct electricity, I'll put a
spade lug around the bottom and ground it out. If it doesn't need to conduct
electricity, and just needs heat, I won't have to use the spade lug. 

This loctite stuff says it's good up to around 300 degrees. Is this enough,
or will it get hotter than that.  I can't find another place to put this
sender where it will work. My wife told me where I could put it, but I don't
see how that can possibly help this situation :-)

Anyone had these problems? Anyone know how this thing works, or knows how to
fix it?
