Subject: Re: Excessive Oil Usage


&gt;Is there a good way of determining which parts are broken?
&gt;The engine is developing good compression though.

If you've measured the compression, and found it to be acceptable, then the
oil may be leaking into the combustion chamber via the valve guides. 
Burning oil while still having good compression usually means that the
heads need to be rebuilt/replaced.
