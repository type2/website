&gt;     I'm interested in fitting a full set of popouts to my Samba. 
&gt;     
&gt;     Thom, Where did you get yours from and what sort of condition were 
&gt;     they in?
&gt;     
&gt;     For that matter has anyone anywhere got any popouts to sell?

I got mine in a junkyard, and paid $5 each w/latches.  I also managed to
get a set of 6.

I will have 2 frames (minus windows/or w/windows &amp; cracked glass) once I
get around to restoring my windows.  These two are kinda &quot;rejects&quot; tho -
a lot of rust on the bottom of the frame.  I have restored windows in this
condition before,  but I had an alterntive this time.

At shows, windows usually go for about $15-$20 in decent condition, and
if they have latches they would be the late ones.  The early spoon latches
are much sought after (myself included - I need all six).  BTW - on the
early spoon latches, one is shorter than the rest - the front cargo door
latch is shorter so it doesn't interfere with the passenger door.
