Subject: Vanagon Rear Camber setting

Hi Volks,

   I was wondering if anyone knew how to fix the negative camber in the
rear of a Vanagon?  My '82 squats in the rear like an old bug.  I was
thinking maybe I would switch the hubs around, or maybe the trailing arms
like a bug.  I'm about to get new tires and I don't want the inner edges to
wear faster the outer.  I know rotating them regularly will help prevent it
but I would like to fix this problem.  Any suggestions?  Thanks in advance!
