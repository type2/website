Subject: Re: Broken cylinder head stud

&gt; 
&gt; Repairer says stud will be case hardened and drilling and using a stud
&gt; extractor will not work.  I think it may.
&gt; 
&gt; Can anyone help with practical how to do it I can't find anything in the
&gt; FAQ archives
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks

--Hi Jack: If there is no other way it is possible to take it to a
machine shop that has a EDM (eiectrical discharge machine). The case
will have to be disassembled. It will be no problem to burn out the stud
and save the threads. With one of these machines it is even easy to get
rid of a broken tap in aluminum without hurting the threads the tap had
just cut.
