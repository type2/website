no,no,no,no,no,no.
(1) i don't have a vw cap (vw cup holder, but no cap).
(2) i ALWAYS peer AROUND the monitor (makes it harder for folks to see me!)

besides ... i look more like this:

                  *********
                 ***********
                ( =(o)=(o)= )
                 **   A   **
                 ***********
                  **IIIII**
                  *********
