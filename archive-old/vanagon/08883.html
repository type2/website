Subject:      more buses for sale ...

from the Feb95 issue of Hot VWs:

1964 single cab, looks good, runs good, rebuilt 1600cc (new baby - must
sell). best offer. ask-4-run (501) 796-8597. Vilonia, AR
&lt;picture looks good. nose mounted spare tire&gt;

and, for that man-about-town, who wants to impress his friends:

split windshield working tow truck. dual rear wheels, electric winch, working
tow boom, 12 volt, dual port motor, IRS trans. send $5 for photos. $2,800.
easy restoration &lt;i swear, that's what it says!!&gt; Ted. (503) 479-8888
