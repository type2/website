&gt;but even when you have all this, there are still episodes of sheer despair and
&gt;desparation! because we are human, we make mistakes. because of the Law of
&gt;Perversity of Inanimate Objects, cars just 'do' things to really piss us off
&gt;.. and make us fearful of them. and the cars can SMELL that fear! and they
&gt;USE it against us! they ALL hate us, and loathe us ... they want to take over,
&gt;but they have no hands! yahahahahahahahaa.

Not my Helga (1977). She loves me. Of course we've only been together for
three months and, therefore, are still in the &quot;romance&quot; phase. By the way,
I need a front pair of shocks. Gas charged or standard? Any
recommendations?
