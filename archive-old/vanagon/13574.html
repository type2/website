&gt;Subject: What-not clarifiaction

On Thursday, 3/16/95 I posted a request for help in locating a cabinet piece
for my '67 Wesfalia camper restoration project. As a clarification, the
what-not cabinet is the L (el) shaped can shelf unit that attaches to the
rear most side cargo door on the passanger side of a pre-'68 type II.
Locating one of these buggers has proven to be more difficult than I
originally considered. although some VW items survive beatifully in Arizona,
the interior, canvas and rubber goodies are generally in poor condition due
to the sun and heat. I should have been more specific in my original post.
It would be very appreciated if y'all would please keep your eyes open for
one. Thanks again!
