    &gt;You Wrote:

&gt;&gt;Dear Digijet experts:
&gt;&gt; I have a '84 Vanagon. Last week I was driving down the highway and the
&gt;&gt;engine suddenly stalled without any warnings. I first examined the fuel
&gt;&gt;pump and it was making  a clicking noise (ie. it  was being turned on and
&gt;&gt;off repeatedly.) I tested the pump and it works fine. I tried to hardwire
&gt;&gt;the pump to see if the engine would start, but got nada. It had fuel
&gt;&gt;pressure and all of the other start-up procedures work(ie. starter,
&gt;&gt;ignition,).  I assum the control unit must be fried and is not opening the
&gt;&gt;injectors and causing the fuel pump relay to switch on and off.
&gt;&gt;Please give me any input you can.
&gt;&gt;If anyone knows who might have a used computer let me know. VW wants $600
&gt;&gt;for a new one, Parts Place says $450 for a used one. There is a local
&gt;&gt;Parts America Store that says they can order a rebuilt one for $170 after
&gt;&gt;exchange (sounds too good to be true).
&gt;&gt;Thanks Marc Rainville


Dear Marc:
As it happens I have a control unit that was removed from my old '84.  At
the time, the mechanic was not sure that there was anything wrong with it
and we went on to discover other sources for the original problem. I have
no idea whether it's any good or not but it's worth a try.  I'll be glad to
ship it to you C.O.D.   Give me a call on the land line _at_ (573) 339-0076
