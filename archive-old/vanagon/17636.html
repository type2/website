Subject:       Fridges : Re: Refrigerator and alarm

Hi Roy.  I regularly put 3 full litres of milk/juice on the door of 
my fridge, and haven't had a problem with it sagging in my '90.

Harry.

&gt; On the subject of fridges...
&gt; 
&gt; I put a couple of Coke cans in the fridge on the door compartment. After
&gt; about three days of sitting there, the fridge door sagged enough to let
&gt; the cold air out. I tried to adjust the door hinge, but it would not
&gt; close as tightly anymore (the door was thus warped). So, what I did was
&gt; to fabricate a plastic door latch at the bottom corner of the door (oppo-
&gt; site the hinges) so that the doors clamp tighter again. Has anyone
&gt; ever experienced this 'door-warping' after putting stuff on the door 
&gt; compartment?
