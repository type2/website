Subject: EV brake problems


We also got the 82 diesel Westy back from our mechanic today, with a brand
new clutch and brand new seals, a re-surfaced flywheel, flushed and
refilled cooling system and a brand new battery...


A  friend of mine  (also happens to be a neighbor) decided to 'adopt' the
diesel westy for the time being.  He registered it under his name and insured
it.  In return, he gets to use the car until:

  a) somebody crazy enough to want a diesel westy buys it.
  b) my son gets his drivers license (only 5yrs left!!!)
  c) it dies beyond repair.

It still looked good, and as 'peppy' as ever... It was able to maintain
40 mph up the 378 hill in Bethlehem, PA....  I was driving behind, in my '87,
and could not see any smoke off of the tailpipe even under the light from
the headlights, so I assume the valve adjustments are still good..

This friend of mine actually does have e-mail access, but he uses and
old-fashioned trash compactor (um, sorry, e-mail reader), and including
him in this list would be a cruel joke, due to the volume of the e-mail
from this list...  I'll forward him the e-mails that I think he'll
be interested in...
