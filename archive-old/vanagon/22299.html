Okay if you're coming down 95 just past DC and need stuff we got a couple 
good and a couple not so good dealers.  If you need something Radley 
VW/Acura in Woodbridge seems as good as anyone.  US 1 Woodbridge exit on 
left and straight until you get there but don't expect too much in stock.

We're running around to all the area dealers trying to find the stray EV 
item.  Got a keychain and a T-shirt from one.  Pricing the bigger ticket 
items like hitch, floor mats and all.

&gt; I'll definitely wave on the I 95.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks !

I promise I'll wave back if I see you.
