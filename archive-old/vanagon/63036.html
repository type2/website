Subject:      Debt to Gerry/Re: What About Archives?

Gerry, It saddens me to see all the energy and money going in to the new
list. You have been so important to all of us.

I wish this energy had gone into a parts drive to buy parts for you or
something special to thank you. We all owe you such a great debt of
gratitude and I know that debt will never be repaid.

Thank you.

&gt;For now they will be on two servers, but Chris intends to bring them over.
&gt;Maybe Chris will post more details to the list.

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Are they going to be ported over to a new location from lenti or are
&gt;&gt; they--worst of all possible worlds--going to be stored on two separate
&gt;&gt; servers, depending on whether messages are pre or post 7/97.
