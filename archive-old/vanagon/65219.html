&gt; I had to replace this on my 84 Westy earlier this year because I broke
&gt; the 8mm pushon fitting that the bypass hose connected to (I will
&gt; remember
&gt; to CUT the hose next time, not pull it off).

I just broke this little bugger off too!!! Warning to all, when removing
the little hose from the bleeder valve, BE CAREFUL. Carefully cut the
clamp and cut the hose with a knife.

My dealer wanted $48.00 for the replacement.  For a temporary fix, I
drilled out the plastic fitting on the bleeder valve with a 1/4 inch
drill bit and fit a two inch length of 1/4&quot; O.D. copper tubing into
the bleeder valve glued up with a bit of JB Weld.  This fix seems to
be working fine, but have ordered the new valve anyway.

BTW, does anyone know if it is ok to introduce copper tubing into
the cooling system??? I'd like to make up a few of my own hoses and
have considered making some of the more complicated bends from copper
tubing with generic rubber hose for the straight runs.  Any comments
on this idea?  I just had to purchase the little hose that goes from
the coolant tank to the water pump (the little one that precariously
threads between the A/C belt) and the cost from the dealer was $38.
I also priced a few other hoses and could not believe the price.  Also,
I wanted a new strap to hold the muffler in place, figuring a few
bucks... Ha!  $58.00 for that thing.  I came home and made one out
of galvanized plumbing strap for $0.58!!!

Please let me know what you think about using copper in the cooling
system.  These cooling systems are so touchy I hate to run the risk
of damaging it.  All opinions are desired...

Thanks.
