Subject: Intros? 

When I joined this list, one of the things I liked best was that the 
welcome message didn't request an intro. In time, I thought, everyone 
will know what a novice I am. Why broadcast this fact?

Alas, the list is far too important to offend (*he shmoozes*), so I guess 
I'll intro myself:

Joe Fournier (pronounced &quot;forn'yay&quot;)/34 yrs. (237 dog years)/Computer
Training Developer.Coordinator.Deliveror/Fayetteville, AR/Employer:
University of Arkansas/MEd Educational Technology/BA English/BS
Frequently/'71 Campmobile. 

Used to have a '72 Campmobile, but sold it to my brother-in-law. BIG 
MisTEAK, as he now won't sell it back to me. :( But it did find a good 
home....New paint, etc. and it's still in the family... :) Funny, but the 
'71 and '72 look identical in terms of body style...and the '72 had a 
1600 in her. The Original Owner had her built in Germany, so he may have 
requested. I do get the better of my BOL (brother-in-law) because my '71 
has the auxiliary heater and the front hammock 8-)) 

I started off wanting to call the '71 &quot;Rusty,&quot; but I'm sandblasting cancer 
and primering on a daily basis, so I now want to call her &quot;Spot.&quot; 8-) I'm 
hoping to start a &quot;real&quot; primer job this weekend and open to any 
suggestions on Primer brands...and paint brands. I considered a 
funkadelic airbrush job for the bus, but I may just go with the original 
blue. I don't intend to keep her forever, probably someday to opt out for 
a splitty. Anyway, she's a campmobile, not a sideshow. Where do you get 
that original light blue color paint?

I'm enjoying the list, but I have to admit I can't digest it all...so I 
purge based on headings.

Thanks! Joe Fournier
