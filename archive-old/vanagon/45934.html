Subject: RE: 1986 heater fan dead

I'd appreciate any leads on where to purchase a new heater motor.  The best 
I was able to locate was $121 at Camelback VW, seemed a bit steep, so 
I've held off replacing my heater motor.  

Several years ago I looked into rebuilding these units, but was unable to 
find a source for bearings or brushes.  Doesn't seem like it is worth the 
effort to remove one just to lubricate worn out bearings.
