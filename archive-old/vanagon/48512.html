Subject: 84 Westy WB Instrument Panel Swap

At my local wrecking yard today in the hot Georgia sun, I found an 84
Wolfsburg with an instrument cluster with the digital clock and tachometer.
Has anyone attempted the switchover from the standard cluster with the analog
clock (which never works) and gauges? I am wondering that since they are the
same year, this might be an easy conversion with all necessary parts
available to be harvested from the donor van.
