&gt;
&gt;I have a 2.0 Lt Type 4 engine that I am doing a top end rebuild on.  This 
&gt;is the first time I have ever attempted anything like this... The heads I 
&gt;pulled off of my engine do not say VW on them anywhere,  the only marking 
&gt;on them is a large &quot;AMC.&quot;  I hear that this means that these are Spanish 
&gt;heads.  Are these worth rebuilding? Are they &quot;good&quot; cores?  Are Spanish 
&gt;heads an inferior to VW made heads?  Is it worth paying a couple of 
&gt;hundred more for VW heads?
&gt;
&gt;	Thank You.

I have used one of these spanish aftermarket heads and one of the valve
seats came loose after only 10,000 miles. It now sits in a box disassembled
waiting for a Mark Stephens overhaul. Thats the only way I would ever use it
again. Be careful!
