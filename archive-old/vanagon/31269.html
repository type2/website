Subject: O2 Sensor

Hello,

I put in a new O2 sensor in my van because the wire
had come loose on the one that was in there.

Now the O2 sensor light stays on constantly, is there
something I need to reset to tell it I put in a new sensor
or is it indicative of another problemm.

Please respond to me directly

Jim
