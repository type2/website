Subject: 

&gt;Tired of condensation in your empty Vanagon Westy water tank allowing all
&gt;sorts of yucky bacteria and algae to grow and slime everything up so that
&gt;you have to rinse the damn thing out with bleach every time before you use
&gt;it?

My solution is a little different. I have a special cap that I put on the
drain with holes drilled into it. Any water in the tank drains out these
holes. To keep dirt from flying up through the holes I glued some foam into
the cap. I manufactured the cap by cutting an old Advil bottle in two. The
advil bottle just fits and so it does not fall off.

It is torture to have to undo those screws to get the plate off to get to
the water tank so I attached some weatherstrip foam to the bottom of that
plate in the same shape as the cutout. This way, I don't need to use screws
but the plate cannot shift around.
