Oh I had thought he was making a concillatory effort by buying a present 
for your wife.  Not that you could buy a dress for $20 dollars anymore.  
Anyone thats gone shopping with a wife, girlfriend or duaghter would know 
that.

Yes the writing is poor quality which is the magazines take me all of 15 
minutes to digest all useful information.  I glance at the females but it 
makes no difference to purchasing the product.  THe ads that don't waste 
the paper space on girls and use it for product information are more 
likely to get my dollars by giving me what I need to make a purchase.  
Bimbos make very little difference to me in these magazines other than 
that.  Weak articles are more important in my decision process.

Why the nastiness about this issue I have no idea.

&gt; Martin,
&gt; 
&gt; Its rather obvious you can't deliniate the difference between my 
&gt; issue...the rather piss poor quality of the above mentioned
&gt; magazines and your projection of your own inadequacies (your
&gt; habit of wearing women's clothing)... so take your $20 and 
&gt; buy yourself a wonderbra.
