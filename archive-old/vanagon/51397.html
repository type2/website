Subject: Found 87 GL: Good Buy or No? Feedback appreciated

Volks,
I have been looking for a Vanagon for my wife and today found the 
following
1987 GL, Auto, Air, 76K miles (it's true!). 
Looks good cosmetically, interior really great, exterior has a few 
whiskey dents but nothing dramatic. Only the lower skirt under the rear 
bumper is dented and rusted, all else in A-Okay. A/C blows very cold, 
runs good with plenty of power and no oil leaks I could see. 
Needs: Tires, maybe front end align, work on stereo as PO pulled amp out 
and left wires.
This is on a lot here in the Houston are and he wants $3,995 however I 
struck a deal at $2,900.
I am taking him a check in the morning unless anyone here can talk me 
out of it.
BTW, what does a front align usually run on an 87 Vanagon? And can I get 
my tires at Discount tires (generics) or do I need name brands.
Any feed back Appreciated
We have already named her: &quot;Das Boot&quot;,,,, or do you Volks like &quot;Panzer&quot; 
better (I have a military background and my wife doesn't care).
Happy in Houston
Mark B. Magee
