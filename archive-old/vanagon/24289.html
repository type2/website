&gt; I am looking to find a copy of the VW Owners Manual for a '66 
&gt; Transporter.  Sorry, don't have the chassis number handy.. just a 
&gt; standard Bus.. not a deluxe, panel, or westy..

Hi John

I get all my manuals from Schiff European Automotive Literature.
They can be reached at (401) 453-5370, and have (so far) had everything
I've wanted in stock.
