Subject:      OXY SENSOR $$$$$$$$

My 85 Vanagon GL Westy just turned 125,000 miles and the OXY sensor came on a
little while ago. I just called an import place here called the VOLKSDOCTOR
and was quoted at about $125 for the sensor (I don't think it's installed for
that) IF it is a VW sensor. If I want an aftermarket &quot;universal&quot; sensor it is
$79. 95. We have TWO VW dealerships here. One is HUFFMAN, they deal mostly in
imports (VW, MAZDA, etc.) and the other is mainly an oldsmobile dealership
(they bought the VW dealership from another dealer a couple of years ago. The
OLDS/VW dealer took FOREVER (I was on the phone nearly 15 minutes on hold) to
look it up and quoted me at $190.00 PLUS $53.00 for labor!!!! HUFFMAN told me
$39.95 WITHOUT LABOR!!! Does this tell me that HUFFMAN is using NON_VW
parts!!??? So, I'm going to order one from a decent VW dealer and try to do it
myself. It's a big deal for those of us who are mechanically challenged! So...
if I'm rehashing this I'm sorry... we don't really keep an eye on things we
don't need at the time :-). Anyone buy this recently? Also, I can't get to a
MICROFICHE machine for a while, does anyone know the part number? Is mine a 3
wire?

One more thing, I'm trying to order a nose protector for the van. J.C.WHIPME
doesn't list one. Can anyone tell me where to find one that won't fall apart?
