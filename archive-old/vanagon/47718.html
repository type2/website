Subject:      EV for Sale in East Providence RI

The Used Cars guys at Scott Motors in East Providence have a 93 EV GL on
the lot. It has 65,000 miles, has a 5-speed tranny, power window/locks/
cruise, A/C and comes with a 12 mos/12k mi power train warranty and the
balance of the 6 year ul miles corrosion warranty. It's a pale blue-gray.
They are asking 14,999. SInce that's about $3,000 less than the thing
went for new, I guaranty they will come down. ALso since they haven't
sold a great many EV's (1?), they will be willing to drop the price.

          To get the real scoop on the van, call the Head Service Manager
Dennis Kollett. He's extremely knowledgable about all VW's (EV included)
and he's a straight-up kinda guy. No BS. 401-438-5555. Mention the list
to him if you call. I'd like to get him hooked in to us.

           For Chris Miller: We love our EV. It's been relatively free of
problems and is a great travel vehicle. Plenty of pep in the 5-cylinder
Audi-designed engine. Handles very well with excellent road feel. It has
many quality-constructed features. My favorites include the different-
sized and shaped rear-view mirrors, the extremely confortable seats, the
smooth-rolling side door, front and rear separate A/C....

          PS: on the Scott EV GL, the tires are new (and some mystery-brand)
but they are passenger car tires and definitely NOT reinforced like the
original equipment tires are. My COnti's are 5-plies on the tread and 2 on the
sidewall and that's what you should have for best handling and safety.

PPS: For Ric Golen: Somebody up here has a rare Porsche Synchro Van whose
power train and body have been place onto a Subaru Justy chassis. He
says it's great in the snow but he can't get it out of the driveway when
it's not snowing. He's willing to let it go for the right offer.... (NOT!)
Glad you didn't take the plunge. We'd be hard-pressed to replace the list's
#1 defender of the faith and source of obscure and valuable EV info!
