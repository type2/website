To All:

I was remiss in failing to mention that the over-all, hands-down winner in
Why The Throttle Wire Breaks is us.  We usually kink the cable trying to put
the engine back in.  Then we straighten it out, hope for the best.

The throttle cable is a high-carbon steel wire; a 'music' wire.  Once kinked,
you can never get it perfectly straight.  Once kinked, the kink will rub
against the tubing wall or the blower housing or some damn thing until it
wears itself in two.

So if you kink one, replace it.  You can always carry the kinky one for a
spare, which is somehow apropos for this list :-)

Other forms of failure are at the ferrel where it's secured to the barrel nut
on the carb.  Here again, the problem is Operator Error, usually from holding
it improperly while we tighten the barrel nut.

Other failures occur at the accelerator pedal, with either the hook or thee
eye wearing through.  If it's the hook on the cable, no sweat; replace the
cable and be on your way.  But it it's the eye in the accelerator pedal, you
have some interesting times ahead of you.  One fix is to grab it with your
vise grips then tape the vise grips to the pedal (!)  (This is fast.  It's
also infuriating to discover your foot is now an inch higher than it should
be.  And the accelerator pedal has just gained two pounds of mass, making for
some very interesting shifts as you fly low though the weeds.)

When was the last time anyone greased their accelerator pedal?  (Don't look
at ME!  I never grease the filthy thing!  Musta been Joel.  Prolly used some
of that Friday Grease.)

The above caused me to recall that a lot of really good drivers wear special
shoes with thin leather soles.  (I'm more of the Combat Boot persuasion.)
