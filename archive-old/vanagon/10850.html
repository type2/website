&gt; I'm about to replace the front door seals on the '75 bus. I got the
&gt; Brazilian ones for $20 instead of the German ones for $80. Once they're
&gt; in, I'll let you know if the Brazilian ones are acceptable or not.

I'm sure mine are the Brazilian ones, cuz I got them from JC Whitney and
they were only about $25.  So far, so good (6 months).

&gt; Right now, it looks like I'll encounter a problem with that ring/donut
&gt; shaped part of the seal that goes to the lower front of the door. Am I
&gt; supposed to cut it open, or is there a way to remove that metal bar that
&gt; goes from the frame to the door?

It is easy to remove the bar.  I can't remember exactly how (that's how easy
it was) but I think there is a pin that you drive out.

&gt; Also, is there some special glue that's recommended for that job? Anything
&gt; else I should know?

I used plain ole rubber cement.  Worked great!  The only thing &quot;wrong&quot; is
that it is harder to open and close the door now.  I was hoping it would
get easier once the seal got broken in, but so far this is not the case.
It takes a good, solid push to get the door to shut all the way, and lots
of force on the button to get the door to release.  But, there is absolutely
no way any water or air is gonna get past that seal, so it's a small price
to pay, IMO.
