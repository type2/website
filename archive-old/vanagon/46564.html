Subject: POSSABLE PROBLEMS

I JUST BOUGHT A 71 CAMPMOBILE,  BROUGHT IT HOME(ON A TRAILER) WILL NOT 
RUN. THE GUY I BOUGHT IT FROM RAN IT HOT (HOT ENOUGH TO MELT SEALS AROUND 
PLUG WIRES) THE ENGINE STILL TURNS FREELY,BUT HOW MUCH DAMAGE COULD THERE 
BE?,,I MEAN, WHAT SHOULD I LOOK FORWARD TO.. WHAT SHOULD I DO FIRST ,, 
TRY TO START THE ENGINE OR JUST TAKE IT OUT AND REBUILD IT?? 

ANY COMMENTS AND SUGESTIONS WOULD BE HELPFUL..

                                           RICHARD
