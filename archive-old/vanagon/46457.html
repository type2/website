Subject: FS 85 Westy Weekender

My 1985 Westy Weekender is for sale. Poptop(sleeps 4) No Stove/Sink combo,
Canvas is in good shape. Folding table, Seats are fair(seats 6), exterior is
excellent, 4speed, Power steering, AC (system rebuilt last year, but
compressor needs to be replaced).  135,000 miles, strong motor, well
maintained.  Items replaced/rebuilt: alternator, power steering rack, master
cylnder, header pipe, head gaskets.  Asking $5000.00  Van is located 90
miles east of Los Angeles (Lancaster/Edwards AFB area).  My reason for
selling the van; I found out we just don't go camping enough to have the
Westy.  I am looking for a straight Vanagon now.
