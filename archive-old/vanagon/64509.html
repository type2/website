Subject:      84 Vanagon For Sale: Price Advice

Hi everyone, hope this message gets out.  I'm thinking about selling my
84 vanagon, and would appreciate some price advice.  It has 115,000
miles, rebuilt engine at 86,000.  Newer muffler (thanks Gerry), new rear
and connecting exhaust pipes (installed today), new thermostat (also
installed today), two year old Michelin tires, two year old shocks,
heater core under third seat replaced last winter, newer brakes, pumped
grease into CV boots last summer.  AC died last summer.  Some rust (MN
van).  Decent clutch and tranny.  It's a good boxcar.  What's a
reasonable price range?  Thanks in advance.  Tim C.
