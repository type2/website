Subject: Re: Australian Members

Hello from Australia,
	I don't know if I am the only member of the group, but I subscribed to
the group in early December. My car is a very basic '91 Syncro (2 front
seats fitted but nothing in the back).
	My plan is to build the car into a semi-camper and use it to do camping
and fishing trips to our Snowy Mountains.
	And yes, I've had the van for about six months and had to replace one
of the heads with a reconditioned one due to a coolant leak. Sound
familiar?
	I will try to keep you posted when I accomplish some of the changes I
intend to do.
	
Regards,
Indulis Kradzins
