I think the vents are to blow out any remaining mouse guts/bird feathers.

BTW - in Excellence, the Porsche mag, a whaile back there was an article
titled &quot;How NOT to sell your 356&quot; whering the author describes bring his
pride and joy out of the garage to show some upscale prospective buyers,
and then starts the car up, craks the throttle a few times, and hears this
screaming.  Its the wife of the who wants the car, and she's screaming
'cause burned mouse guts are flying out of the exhaust!

Thats the same article where he has essentially sold the car to someone, 
but the guy never shows up to finish the deal/pick up the car.  Weeks go
by, and no sign.  Finally he contacts someone who tells him &quot;Nope, he's
not gonna buy the car&quot;  Turns out the prospective buyer boarded KAL 007...
