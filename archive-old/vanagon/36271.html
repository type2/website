&gt;My newly acquired bus has had the fuel injection system replaced with a

&gt;the fi back in. It's not a huge priority, and I've only started hunting
&gt;for parts. It looks as though I'll need the entire system: (fuel pump,
&gt;fuel filter, injectors, pressure regulator, computer, relay for fuel pump,
&gt;air flow meter, air filter and mounting hardware, intake manifold, other
&gt;assorted bits?.?)
&gt;
&gt;Does anyone know how many (if any) of these parts are interchangable with
&gt;other years of busses, and possibly other models of VW? (ie. can I pull a
&gt;fuel pump and pressure regulator off a late 70s/early 80s Rabbit?).
&gt;Reasonably priced used parts are hard to come by around here for VW
&gt;busses, and any straight across compatability

Things I remember from my '76 van:
1.      The air flow box changed from 6 pins to a7 pin plug in the middle
of '76. Be careful what you get.
2.      My automatic '76 had a different Brain box (different part #) from
the manual tranny brain box for that year, so watch for that, too (I did
run a '77 manual tranny brain box in my van for a few months with no
discernibly difference). It must have been tuned for engine response to
automatic tranny gearing needs.
3.      Your fuel pump is not the same, I think, as the CIS rabbit stuff.
The CIS system runs at 70-80psi (I think), and the bus systems w/air flow
boxes run at 28psi or so (of course, this is controlled by the pressure
regulator, so the pump may be the same--not much help, huh?).
4.      Really, your best bet is to find a junk bus with EFI, and strip it.
That's what I did when I went back from carbs to EFI (the resolution of the
engine fire I keep meaning to write about).
