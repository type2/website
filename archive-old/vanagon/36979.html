Subject: Re: Headlight oddity


&gt;When I rev the engine to about 3,000 rpm,
&gt;suddenly the alternator light goes out, the headlights bet brighter, etc.,
&gt;and system voltage now measures around 13.6V. After that, the system
&gt;operates correctly
     &lt;snip&gt;
&gt;In any case, test procedures for this series of
&gt;alternators included &quot;waiting&quot; for some period of time (like, what....30
&gt;seconds?) before measuring the charging voltage and deciding the alt was
&gt;dead.  I suspect that the revving to 3,000 rpm has not much to do with the
&gt;charging.

Well, a few times recently I've started the engine to do some carb
adjustments, and not revved it up as mentioned. Fifteen minutes later,
the alternator light was still on. When I finally did rev it, the light
turned off when I hit about 3200 rpm, and stayed off after that.


&gt;An alternate (!) explanation could have something to do with high base load 

&gt;(likes LOTS of accessories) dragging the voltage down during idle, or
&gt;pulleys too small to keep the resting voltage up.

This is very possible. The V6anagon has an electric radiator cooling fan
installed by the PO, which runs all the time the ignition is on, even
when the engine is newly started and still cold. One of my to-do projects,
is to install a *working* temperature switch and connecting it to the fan
relay... now that I have a reliable temperature gauge to tell me I did it
wrong before the engine cooks itself. This will leave the fan off until
the engine warms up enough to need it. Might let the engine run a little
warmer, too, which might help gas mileage-- I've never smelled or felt
the least bit of overheating, and the gauge always reads right around
170F, though we all know how accurate temp gauges can be &lt;not&gt;.

BTW, I found the cause of the headlight oddity that started this thread,
I think. A loose 12V connection to the headlight switch! The PO had
evidently removed/replaced the connector a few times, and the 12V
line from the ignition switch had pushed right out of the plastic
connector. The brass retaining tab on the connector was bent all the
way back-- looks like something gave it quite a shove!  :-O

Thanks for all your assistance, listmembers-- vanagon_at_lenti 4ever!
