&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Frankly folks, I think we're missing the boat on this one.  Since the Wall
&gt; came crashing down we've been trying to establish contact with Russian
&gt; veedubers, wondering if those rumors of cast iron Rumania 36hp engines were
&gt; true, or the one about a whole field of Wehrmarct swimmer-wagens moldering at
&gt; an armory near Trabdva.
&gt;
&gt; Here's are big chance!  We all know the best Russian mechanics are women.
&gt;  All we gotta do is find one that can provide information about Russian
&gt; air-cooled veedubs then elect one of our subscribers to woe the secrets out
&gt; of her, a neat reversal of the old Honey Trap.
&gt;
&gt; And what about a Russian Tour?  Hell, it's only a couple of miles between
&gt; Little Diomide and Big Diomide; we'll caravan to Alaska, hire a car ferry to
&gt; plop us down on the other shore and drive down to Moscow for the weekend.
&gt;  (Martha?  Think 'magnesium'.)  Buses under the Arch is fine.  But howzabout
&gt; Buses in Red Square?
&gt;
&gt; Come on, guys!  (And you gals, too.)  We owe it to our bugs and buses.  (I
&gt; nominate Joel.  Russian gals love a poet.)
&gt;

...count me in ! let's all go visit olga ! we bring buses and beer, she
provides vodka + women...
