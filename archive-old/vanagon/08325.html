&gt; &gt; the front bumper give nothing to hang onto, have someone weld a good bracket,
&gt; &gt; I hadno problem towing mine behind a 84 Nissan 4x4,,,
&gt; 
&gt;    No, no, no -- put it on a dolly, it will pull much better, you don't 
&gt; have to weld anything, etc. You can even put the rear end on the the 
&gt; dolly and it won't do anything to the tranny, although it probably won't 
&gt; anyway.

&gt;     All is impermanent, but this too shall pass away, and the way of the
&gt; Samurai is death --- so speak your mind now, or forever hold your peace! 

no no no no no,,,put the dolly back on the shelf, take the truck and tow
it with the van!
