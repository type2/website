Subject: Re: Handling Improvements

&gt; I would like to lower the front end slightly from its stock configuration.
&gt;1)Does anyone have any comments, ideas, experience with any of the
&gt;above???

I am not a great mechanic or an engineer so I can't give you any expert
advice on this subject.  However, I bought an Acura Integra, new, which had
been lowered as part of a sport package added by the dealer.  This
unconventional configuration led to premature tire wear (about 10,000kms),
and several busted shocks.  After being towed in to the dealership (at the
dealers expense) for the third time, the dealer finally agreed it was a
poor configuration and replaced any busted parts and reset the suspension
to factory specs.

The moral of the story is to do your homework carefully, get lots of
opinions and heed the advice of nay sayers.  Even though the dealer paid
for all the trouble I had with my configuration, I paid the price in time
and headaches toward an otherwise flawless vehicle.
