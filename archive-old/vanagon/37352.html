Thanks to all of you who helped me with the EGR warning light... or
should I say EGR ATTENTION light.  My '76 (no name as of yet) is
getting approximately 20 mpg.  The gas gauge is kinda broken.... kinda
meaning it shows full when the tank is full, but shows empty when
the tank is about half full.  I have been monitoring the the gas 
consumption for a few weeks now, so that average is pretty solid.
What sort of mpg are all of you getting?  I would expect a FI to be
getting much better gas mileage... I will admit that I do hit some
traffic to and from work.

Thanks in advance,
