Greg;
Do you access to a volt meter? 
The first thing I would do is check/clean all associated electrical
connections. With engine off disconnect the battery ground clamp.
Inspect the following:
1&gt;Alternator/battery connection at starter.
2&gt;Ground straps at transmission and engine.
3&gt;connections at alternator.
4&gt;All battery connections.
With winter coming some PMs in this area would not hurt anyway.
I picked up a regulator assy at a local alternator repair shop (Fleet
Supply) for around $12. For that price you can replace yours and keep it
for a spare if not bad .
I am not sure what affect this has on your poor engine performance but I
will ponder it.
Good Luck
