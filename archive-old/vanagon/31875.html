First off, HAPPY BIRTHDAY, GERRY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

OK, now for Gerry's top 5 wishes (it'd be 10, except Gerry would think it
too long and kick me off the list, which would make me very sad indeed):

1.  A text editor for each and every one of us.

2.  More diskspace for Gerry's list.

3.  A pristine T1 Type2.

4.  A pristine T2 Type2.
 
5.  A pristine T3...er, sorry, you already got that one!...uhm, T4 Type2.

OK, OK, after all that, he'll just have to have a sixth:

6.  A BIGGER garage!

Happy Birthday, Gerry, and many more!

Norman
