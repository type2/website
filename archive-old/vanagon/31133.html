Subject: How to fix a rear window defogger?

I've been trying to get the rear window defogger to work in my '77.  When 
I got the bus the wires weren't connected to the switch, so I figured out 
where to hook them up.  Well, that works, but it seems the traces going 
acreoos the rear window are old and corroded.  I have 13.73 volts at the 
rear window with the engine running.  But... there is about 1M Ohm of 
resistance across the window, which is about 1,000K Ohm to many. :)
I checked the connectors... and I get no resistance from them to the wide 
trace on the edge, so it must be the traces.  They don't have any visible 
cuts or breaks.  I check a friend's working defogger on his Dodge Colt, I 
figure it's the same principle.  It has 0 Ohms, and draws 12 Amps.

So is there anyway to &quot;redo&quot; the traces, or should I find a good window 
in the junk yards?
