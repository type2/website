Subject: VW's new Web pages


Volkswagen Motors To The Web

Volkswagen America has established a World Wide Web site to service
existing and potential customers. Volkswagen says it had tried to be
different from other auto-maker sites which it says are &quot;mostly text
based, on-line brochures.&quot; The VW home page features a road map, which
acts as the home page, navigating the user to various general subject
sites. One area, &quot;Shakedown Street,&quot; takes the user down a road built
in memory of late Grateful Dead member Jerry Garcia.
