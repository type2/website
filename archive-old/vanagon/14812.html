Bring on the GNATT!! I've got some other ugliness planned
which denies me the whole month of frolic, but I will join 
the rumble for as many adventures as possible.  I like the 
outerbanks proposition, there are some truly VW-esque campgrounds
in the National Park which we could sample.

Are we looking for an organizer for the Eastern Legg??  How much
time could we devote to this side and maintain a frenzied level
of participation?  The smokies are brilliant as well and there
are some awesome spots in the appalachian mountains.  I feel the
rumble over here, we just need to define the menu a bit more so 
everyone can get their vee-dubs poised for the feast.

A tip on the Yellowstone issue...

I hit that park in June two years ago on my epic ramble and they
had a number of parks which were 'free' and unregulated, the park
service has no idea as to their availablity, but it is first come
first snooze.  we didn't have a problem finding a spot.
