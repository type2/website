Subject: RE: Inquiry: Las Vegas VW Stuff??

 did all the CVs and had us out of the super clean shop in 1/2 
&gt;an hour, and the total bill was about $21.00.  Did not hear the slightest 
&gt;bump for the rest of the trip.

DOH!!!!
Just had inner and outter CVs done on the '83 Westy at a local
Phoenix/Scottsdale VW  (in desparation)  dealership. Took almost 4 hours and
cost hundreds of dollars!!!  Only passanger side. Needed it for basic
transpo and couldnt wait for myself and friends to fumble through the drill
on the weekend. For the price I paid I coulda had the bus towed to Vegas...
(almost).  Dang, maybe the knocking was not in the CVs but in my wallet.
DOH!!!!

Were the CVs replaced or just repacked? Mine were pretty worn.
