Subject: (Un) locking sliding door


     The slider on the new Syncro Westie:

      (1) Unlocks and opens with the power locks,
      (2) Unlocks and opens from the inside
      (3) Unlocks and opens from the outside with the key

     But won't STAY unlocked, i.e., you always have to do one
     of the above to open it up. Is this normal? (Don't have my
     manuals or Bentley yet..). If not, ideas on a fix?

     Thanks
