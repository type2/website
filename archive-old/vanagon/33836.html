Subject: FS 76 Westy (now I'm unknown!)

With my first posting to this list I shall now become unknown and offer a truly
fine 1976 Westfalia for sale in the Raleigh NC area.

First things first.  If it's so fine then why am I selling it?  Simply put.  My
wife and I have bought an '89 Westy (wife found it) from a couple who concluded
after 7 years of ownership (and little use) they prefer hotels over camping.

So what about the '76?

We bought the vehicle (no name formally but I have been known to utter the
words &quot;old yeller&quot; when referring to it at times) from an elderly couple (early
70's) 3 years ago.  After 133K thousand miles of camping they decided to part
with it in favor of a newer non-westy Vanagon.  Since that time we have put a
little over 7K miles on it.  It was used predominately for camping as it was
our third and only camping vehicle.  What impressed me when I originally bought
the vehicle was the outstanding maintenance and care it had received.  We had
been looking to purchase a used Westfalia (considered any year or model) but
were disappointed with the condition of most we saw.  Needless to say, even
though we have put very few miles on it I have continued the excellent
maintenance it is accustomed to receiving.

Our original intentions were to keep the '76 for many years, however this was
our first Westfalia and we love owning and using it more than we thought ever
imagineable.  Hence, we have been keeping our eyes open to finding something
newer and we have found it.

On to some descriptives.

Icebox, sink, spare up front with cover, original upholstery and curtains.
Canvas in excellent shape, no rust outside, underneath or in engine
compartment.
Original motor is extremely strong and reliable.  (This bus can be driven with
extreme confidence)

Price=$3,200.  This includes a great story of how we found the '76 (or did it
find us?!)
