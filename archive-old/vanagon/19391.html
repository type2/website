So Richard says:
&gt;   Well, yesterday someone decided to give my happy, peaceful,
&gt; brightly-hued 67 an extra stripe with their key yesterday. The nice
&gt; person graciously made sure the stripe went All the way down the side,
&gt; and was very deep as well. Just curious as to if any other busses,
&gt; especially the more colorful ones, have ever been, er, shall we say
&gt; &quot;modified&quot; by the less than adoring public?
&gt; Anyway, I hope not...
&gt; Richard

I'd like to see a list of who *hasn't* had this happened.  There's no
shortage of jerks in the world.  :(
