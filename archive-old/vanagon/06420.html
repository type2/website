  I hope this doesn't get chewed up too bad in the mail...


  Here's the first installment, compiled from the info I had at home. Vanagon
  and EV owners, please send along the ratio and stroke info. if you can. We
  need Diesel data for both 4 and 5 speeds if the top gear ratio is different.
  Also, we need the stock tire size for the EV - the calculations thus far
  assumes 185R - 14 Reinforced
