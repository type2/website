&gt;------------------------------------

&gt;as of 1995.04.04, this part number N 902 061 01 was invalid. the newer
&gt;part number for the Bleeder Screw, as seen on the 1993 Microfiche for
&gt;Vanagons 1983-1985 and Vanagons 1986-1991 is  861-819-039. the gasket
&gt;number is still the same. BUT the new Bleeder Screw seems to be plastic
&gt;again, not metal.
&gt;in fact, two reliable parts people have said that there were never any
&gt;&quot;metal&quot; bleeder screws ... only plastic. so apparently this tech info
&gt;is wrong. but a new bleeder screw might solve the leaking.

  I think the bleeder in the Raidiator is the same diameter screw and thread
pitch and would work in the heater core?

  Not positive but I think this id correct.
