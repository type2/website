&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Is there a way to install temporary seats in the open space 
between the =
&gt;driver's/passenger's front seats and the bench seats in the back 
of the =
&gt;80 Vanagon.  There is a *lot* of space there and when not camping, 
it =
&gt;would be nice to use it for seating.  What say ye?

I've thought about getting one of those big fishing coolers (with 
the padded top). May not be comfy for the long haul, but provide 
storage also.
