Erik,

Check the end play.  I recently installed a 2.0L from an automatic into my 
manual transmission vanagon.  After replacing the torque converter drive 
plate with a flywheel the crank would turn but end play was essentially 
zero.  End play creates space between the thrust surfaces for a thin 
layer of oil, which (if I understand it correctly) provides a cushion for 
the crankshaft to ride on.

I'm including a message from Bob Hoover about the procedure which was 
very helpful to me:

I checked the spec for Type IV end-play and found it the same as for the Type
I, .003&quot; to .0065&quot;.  Starting from scratch, when assembling an engine I shoot
for .0025&quot; and dead flat thrust surfaces.  This seems to wear at a slower
rate.  It is very satisfying to check end-play after 40,000 and discover it
has opened up only one-thousandth of an inch.

Since your engine is already assembled just be sure your shims and the
flywheel's thrust face are truly flat.  I've noticed that many after-market
shims are stampings that have not been tumbled, leaving an up-turned
feather-edge that is not only sharper than a razor, it is very hard, easily
capable of scoring your flywheel or gouging your #1 main bearing's thrust
flange.  When forced to use such parts, stone their edges to destroy the
feather-edge.  Be sure to clean away every single trace of abrasive before
assembly, even if only for  test.

I've used more than three shims on some engines.  I'm not sure what rule that
violates the engines didn't complain and were running fine years later.

Good luck with it.

If my crankshaft hadn't turned when I torqued the flywheel bolts I 
probably wouldn't have installed the engine, driven it a couple hundred 
miles, and been without a bus while I pulled the endine and did the job 
right.  Idiot acts are frustrating, but hey, I learned a lot.

Best of luck, 
Paul
