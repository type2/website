&gt;So today I replaced the starter.  Seems to have fixed the problem, but we've
&gt;heard that before.  The other one was just over a year old.  I don't think
&gt;they really &quot;rebuild&quot; them - I think they clean 'em up and repain them.  The
&gt;starter s'posedly has a lifetime warranty, so we'll see.  I can replace a
&gt;starter in about 15-20 mintues, so I guess thats not _too_ bad, but I'd
&gt;rather not do it...

Tom,
Did you replace or lubricate the starter bushing?  Sometimes this will seize
or drag and cause an intermittant starter drag or failure.  (I'm grabbing at
straws here)
