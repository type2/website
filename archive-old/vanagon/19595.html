Subject:       Re: Vanagon A/C 

Hi Everyone.  I would agree with some of the other posters about how 
good the Vanagon a/c is.  We sometimes call our van the Polar Bear.. 
it's white, big, heavy, and COLD in the summer!!  The a/c in our '90 
really does an excellent job keeping such a large vehicle cool.  
Running the a/c doesn't seem to affect our fuel mileage either. 

The trick to a cool interior is proper vent aiming.. we have 
Westy...once the vents are set correctly it's great.

I have always had the system evacuated/recharged every year since 
1992.  After the second year, it wasn't blowing that much cold air, 
and it was determined that the system was low on freon.  No leaks 
were detected at that time... at least not enough to show in a leak 
test.

Since then, I get the a/c serviced as an annual spring time 
service... at least as long as R12 is still available.  This year, 
the a/c sprung a leak at the pulley seal, and after much trouble 
locating the correct seal, this was replaced.  Luckily I had this on 
extended warranty as it was a job around $500 CDN.

Running the a/c is important.  Whether or not you use it, it must be 
run periodically to keep the seals lubricated.  I do this (minimum 
every 10 days or so), but me seals still gave out :(

I am very pleased with the a/c on our van.  It is very powerful, and 
efficient.  It's worth giving up that extra cupboard for!!

Harry.
