From:         Gerald Skerbitz &lt;gsker_at_LENTI.MED.UMN.EDU&gt;
Subject:      Admin Simple Instructions (QUERY instead of SET  Command)

I've been sending simple instructions to a few people and recently realized
they were wrong.  The SET VANAGON command which worked under listproc is now

QUERY VANAGON


under LISTSERV.  Send this commdand to LISTSERV_at_GERRY.SDSC.EDU and NOT to the
vanagon list.

It will send back output like the following:
&gt; query vanagon
