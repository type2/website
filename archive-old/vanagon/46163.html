Subject: Re hot solenoid not kicking


&gt;Mike Benthin:
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Otherwise, if I'm not on a hill, I get underneath with my
&gt;&gt;trusting 14g wire with alligator clips on each end and
&gt;&gt;attach one end to the pull-off connector on the solenoid
&gt;&gt;(red wire goes to it), and touch the other end to the HOT
&gt;&gt;terminal from batter to starter- it should try to kick over.
&gt;
&gt;I'm sure this goes without saying, but look: this kinda stuff scares me.
&gt;I'm completely paranoid about having trucks drop on me (I don't even trust
&gt;jackstands, I put bricks under the frame after I get the jackstands
&gt;situated) and yet twice this year I've had the truck fall off a jack.
&gt;Thought the parking brake would hold it, it didn't, etc.
&gt;
&gt;When you jump the starter like this, your chest (or your head) is under a
&gt;drive wheel. Right? All you have to do is leave it in gear once, and you
&gt;become a casualty in a Roadrunner cartoon. If you won't fix the starter
&gt;right, at least squirm up from the rear to hot-wire it so you're not under
&gt;the wheel.
&gt;
&gt;&lt;sermon over. please help yourself to cookies and hawiian punch in the lobby.&gt;

        I must just add... About 15 years ago my boss was working on his car
at home, it came down on him, he lived for a few days in pain but died of
complications. Also two years ago at a friend of mines body shop, one of his
workers had a car fall on his head... it was over quickly. Before going
under a car I always brace it with a dead weight such as a stump. 
        If you do not want to fix it properly for good, then wire out a
switch into the engine compartment.
