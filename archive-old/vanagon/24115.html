Just thought it would be interesting; didn't really expect to see much
substance. Anyway, wasn't Nader the same guy who spoke up against the
terrors of marachino cherries? Forget those nuclear test sites and
biological weapons....it's those d*mn cherries and volkswagens that will
do us all. Probably the Germans had planned to send over transporter-loads of
marachino cherries before Nader came to the rescue...I wonder if HE ever 
inhaled? 8) Joe

&gt; Ah yes, the Small on Safety Thread again.  This was one of Nader's
&gt; diatribes against autos.  It includes such scientific tests
&gt; as ramming a Ford Galaxie 500 into the back of a '56 beetle and
&gt; being amazed at the results.  It also refers to buses as by
&gt; far the most unsafe vehicle of any kind on the road, based on 
&gt; statistics that show it involved in more single-car accidents
&gt; than any other.  The theory being they get blown off the road
&gt; or the swing axles were unsafe.  My counter theory is that there
&gt; is just a small chance (in 1971) that maybe some of those people
&gt; driving buses had been, uh, stoned or something.  
&gt; 
&gt; Probably also didn't have the first ed. of Muir to tell them
&gt; to replace their swing lever pin bushing (which I'll be
&gt; doing this month :( I'll make sure to keep off drugs until then).
