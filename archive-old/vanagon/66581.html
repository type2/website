Subject:      Re: Gas Leak Fix

&gt; Hi, I have a gas leak . I can see the spot on the ground(getting bigger)
&gt; but can't find the leak. I checked the overflow tanks and tubing but  it
&gt; is ok. If you are under the van and look at the passenger side support
&gt; strap it is wet with gas but I CANT FIND THE LEAK!!!!!! PLEASE help me
&gt; before I go insane or WORSE like blow up. Thank you

I just finished dropping, cleaning, patching and re-installing my tank on
the 82 vanagon.
There was a large amount of dirt buildup in the air vent tunnel as well as
rust.  After scrapping away the crud with a wire brush I discovered that
the tunnel had already been repaired with soldered? metal plates done by
the PO.
I found one pinhole and patched it with Sealall then rust painted the
works.  Hope this lasts longer than a few weeks but without a proper weld
repair I may be back under soon.  A new tank was in the order of 350.00 CN
dollars.

Try to do the work on a windy day, those fumes are not fun.
