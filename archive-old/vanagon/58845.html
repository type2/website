Subject: Re: Dont blink your lights! *GANG DANGER*

I refuse to live in fear of such modern folk-lore stories. The danger
that YOU the next driver will get in an accident with a non-gang member
who is drunk (the primary reason for leaving lights off, ask a cop), or
who is sober and just hasen't noticed it is getting dark is much greater
than gang initiation violence. Gangs mostly shoot each other here in S.
Cal, not other people.

danger.
&gt;
&gt;There is at least a 50% chance possibility that you may find yourself
the
&gt;target of a gang initiation. It seems that some gangs initiate new
&gt;&quot;shooters&quot; by trolling in traffic with their headlights intentionally
left
&gt;off. Their goal is to wait until some well intentioned citizen blinks
their
&gt;lights at them intending to add to the saftey factor. The good
samaritian
&gt;ends up in the crosshairs of the newbie shooter.

&gt;I tend to think that I have a fairly decent &quot;sidewalk diploma&quot; in street
&gt;smarts but this was a new one on me. If I can help keep you and your
family
&gt;NOS then all the better.Peace, (please)
