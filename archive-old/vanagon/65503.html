I am waiting for UPS to deliver the &quot;correct&quot; Syncro driveshaft u-joints.
When and if they work as promised, I will make a full report to the list.
If anyone can't wait about one more week, contact me directly.

&gt;
&gt; Sometime within the last 2 months, someone wrote in and mentioned that
they
&gt; took the failed u-joint to a standard u-joint shop and they matched it up
to a
&gt; standard, available, off the shelf u-joint .
&gt;
&gt; &lt;snip&gt;
&gt; I removed the driveshaft yesterday, and found one u joint that was seized
&gt; along 1 axis.  It would only move about 20 degrees either way.  No wonder
the
&gt; thing shook!!  I hope the trans case wasn't damaged, as it is wet near
the
&gt; output flange.
&gt;
&gt; Does anyone know about those u joints?  Can they be replaced?
