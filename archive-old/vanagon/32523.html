Subject: RE Stovetop coffee makers

I have a manual coffee grinder that I bought at a camping store (REI) 
that works great.  I know that there are REI stores in: Seattle, San 
Diego, and Long Island New York.  To make the best coffee you should 
grind the beans immediately before you make the coffee.  Also you should 
not boiling water to make coffee.  It is too hot and extracts bitter 
flavors from the beans in addition to the good coffee extracts.  I think 
the best brewing temperature for coffee water is about 196F.  I boil 
water on the camper stove and then let it cool for a minute or two then I 
use a melita (sp?) type filter basket and make my coffee directly into a 
thermos (stainless steel).
