Subject: Re: What in the Wide, Wide World of Sports is a Weekender?

In a message dated 96-07-24 11:03:30 EDT, you write:

&gt;  Due to popular request, here is the non-official explanation of the 
&gt;     Weekender option (which is also part of the 1985 Vanagon for sale I 
&gt;     mentioned yesterday):
&gt;     
&gt;     The Weekender package is an option that came with Vanagon GL's. The 
&gt;     Weekender essentially makes enough sleeping space for two adults in 
&gt;     the rear of the Vanagon. This is accomplished by folding the middle 
&gt;     seatbacks forward, folding the rear seat flat so the seat cushions 
&gt;     face upward, and a VW furnished cushion that sits over the engine 
&gt;     compartment. This results in a fairly large flat area for sleeping. 
&gt;     There is no stove, refrigerator, or pop-top, so the Weekender is kind 
&gt;     of a &quot;Westphalia Lite.&quot;

This is correct, but I wouldn't go so far as calling a fold down seat &amp;
cushion a Westfalia Lite.  I'd say that Westfalia Lite better describes the
basic (not GL) Vanagon Campers that came with the pop-top but no sink /stove
equipment, or the 1990/91 Multivan models with a pop-top and seating for 7.
 Some call the basic Camper models &quot;Weekenders&quot;.
