                      RE&gt;&gt;#2(4) VANAGON digest 563                 8/9/95

The &quot;no-starter&quot; situation may have just initiated itself on my '83 diesel
vanagon (that was also the night leaving a concert that the glow plug relay
stuck &quot;ON&quot;, and I had to physically pull lit from it's socket to get the glow
plugs to power down).  At the time, I was more concerned about the glow plugs,
since a second spin of the key produced starter motor motion.

The discussions over the last week about this problem sound like the wiring
circuit is getting some high resistance connections.  Has anyone tried
tofilrst identilfy and trace the starter circuit, and then go through the
circuit connection by connnection and open each one, clean and reconnect to
see if this solves the problem?
