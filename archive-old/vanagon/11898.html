Subject: Rocks 'n' stones 

As I'm doing a lot of posts tonight, I might as well mention 
this ...

Let's set the way-back clock for 1987 ...

I had my lovely Jetta (Gizmo) for less than six months when 
there was the most awful racket when I was going over bumps.  I 
was certain that there was some major problem with the rear of 
the car and brought it in to the VW garage.  The mechanics 
looked at it and scratched their collective heads and said that 
it was major and they couldn't figure it out!

They tore the car apart.

They handed it back to me and started making noises that they 
would have to replace struts and shocks and stuff.  &quot;Come back 
next week and we'll sort it out.&quot;

That weekend, I had to change the tyre.

There was a 2 pound rock living in the spare.
