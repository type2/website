Jonah,

After doing the same to my 85 Westy, I repalced it with a radio shack
antennae that had a flexiable base.  It was easy to install.  I could access
the space I needed from under the dash, through the center console ashtray,
throught the instrument cluster housing and from under the front of the van
from outside (next to the spare tire).  Spent about $15 on the antennae and
and hour fiddling with the install.  No problems since.  Reception is better
because I installed and 'electrically' taller antennae.
