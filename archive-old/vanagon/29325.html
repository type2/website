Subject: shitty aftermarket muffler
Date: Tue, 21 Nov 1995 12:27:20 -0600 (CST)

One more thing I need to report after the 5-day trip: the Monza-style
aftermarket muffler that I bought from the BusBoys exactly 14 months ago
is *falling apart*! One of the tailpipes disappeared somewhere in
Maryland, while all other weldings between pipes and muffler body have
dissolved as well. The muffler body is now just hanging there. 

This muffler cost me about $110 and has been nothing but trouble. First,
the paint melted, obviously not being heat resistant. What stench! Since
then, rust has been *unstoppable*. Also: the Monza design is loud and does
not, IMHO, produce more power. Finally, the pipes are inconveniently
located and blow hot, stinky, and poisonous, exhaust fumes right onto the
owner-mechanic as he/she tunes up the engine (or, say, wiggles some
wiring). 

I'm returning to stock and will see to have the old assembly fixed.
