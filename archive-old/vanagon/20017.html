Subject: Re: 71 no start

I just rebuilt my 71 1600dp and installed it into my bus and it will not
start.  in checking when the rotor is at the #1 position the plug for #1
sparks, the piston is at TDC and the valve clearance is at specs.  The firing
order is correct. The thing will not even make a noise.  It just turns over
and over.  nice and smooth but no fire.  I did just for kicks twist the
distributer half way around and got a puf of smoke.  I installed the
distributer gear correct with the # piston at TDC  Sometimes I think no gas
but the filter is full.  I get no real smell of gas from the plug.  should i
throw sone gas directly down the carb or just all over the bus and burn it to
the ground.


PLEASE HELP I AM AT NEAR BREAKDOWN

71' BUS

I had the same problem in my '73.  I put the new motor in, checked all
connections, and STILL nothing!  I ended up tossing in the towel and taking
it to the local garage - $150 later, running like a champ.  Now that I'm a
bit wiser (?), I would try checking it more thoroughly myself first.  Are you
getting any fuel to the carb - check the bowl and see if it's wet.  Did you
have any fuel pump problems previously? If you're using an electric pump, is
your power wire connected to the coil?  Stupid question, but make sure
there's fuel in the tank - you had to drain a bunch to pull the old motor,
remember?!?  Now that you've checked fuel, check your fire.  All connections
to the alternator/generator and starter good?  Connections to the coil good?
 Check your coil by pulling the end wire off the dizzy cap, cranking the
motor a time or two, and connecting to a good ground (NEAR NOT A DROP OF
FUEL!!!) - you should get a fat blue spark.  Above all, consult your Idiot
Book by St. Muir.  Take it step by step and rule out certain possibles - what
you narrow it down to will help fix your problem and get you going down the
road again!

Hope it helps!
