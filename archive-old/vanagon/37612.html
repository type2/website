Subject: Re: finding bad syncro wheel bearing

Bill and Diane Killian don't like somebody's email signature bumper sticker.
I think you GOTTA let that stuff go by.  It's not like the opinions are
catching.  I've always found it interesting:  You read someone's perfectly
rational posts for months and then suddenly discover that in some non-
Vanagon part of their lives they have opinions you think are ... wrong.
Happens with home pages, too -- You're looking at a list of pointers
someone thinks useful, and among the good ones you find the pointer to
Bungee Jumping Your Pet.

Anyway I'm comfortable ignoring in bumper stickers what neither I nor
our honored Listmeister seem to tolerate as threads, and I demand that you
feel exactly the same way I do.  It's the American way.
