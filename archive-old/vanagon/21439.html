&gt; i know i am kinda of late on this thread but i am curious:

&gt; my van was sold to me as a 68(i haven't done any number checking).
&gt; there are two anomolies that stand out to me that i have not seen before.
&gt; 
&gt; 1. door handles are thumb activated buttons instead of the finger
&gt;    activated lever type.
&gt; 
&gt; 2. there are no vent windows in the rear of the bus.
&gt; 
&gt; what do you think?
&gt; 
My '68 Westfalia has the same handles and no vent windows.  It also has 
earlier ('67 I'm guessing) rear brakes.
