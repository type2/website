I think Craftsman tools are still fairly good.  The only one I've
ever broken is the 3/8&quot; u-joint ratchet extension, and I expected it to
break.  I also like Craftsman sockets because they are thin-walled and
allow you to get a socket over bolts that are real close to something.
I've never broken one yet, but for the really stressful jobs I use
impact sockets.  Good luck breaking one of those!  Until someone comes
out with stronger, cheaper tools, I'll be buying Craftsman.
