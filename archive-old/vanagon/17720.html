&gt;&gt;An informed discussion and/or pointers to 12v solar panel stuff would
&gt;&gt;be interesting.  Now that summer is here I'd love to implement a solar
&gt;&gt;powered ventilation system.  Anyone seen such?

Well, David Schwarze started it and I'm following into his footsteps. We
both have a set of 4 solar panels, each 1 by 4 ft. in size.  The set is
rated at 87 Watt. David has his already installed, while I'm struggling to
find time on a rainless day. 
   
   Very cool! Do you intend to add batteries to store collected energy
   or use the existing battery only?
