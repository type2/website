Subject: Re: PNW Camping Trip/Stove Install


I think the February dates may be better, but of course that would be 
right in the middle of finals and that may reduce the number of people going.

I tend to favor the NW coast, but really anywhere we end up this time of 
year is going to have limited outdoor activities.  Deception Pass sound 
like a good place as well.

ALso, does anyone know how well the original propane tanks on the busses 
hold up?  Mine has the tank, but somewhere along the way someone removed 
the stove(maybe with good reason?) and I am interested in getting another 
one.  Is this a good idea, or should I stick with the portable camp stove 
and save myself the trouble?  Has anyone had any experiences with this?  
I found a stove/fridge unit for $40 at a junk yard and considered buying 
it.  Any help is appreciated.

Craig
