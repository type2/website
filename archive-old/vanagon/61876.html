&gt;
&gt;Advice received from Sean, Paul, Joel, Rob, Ken, Norman, Steve &amp; John much
&gt;appreciated!  I checked my Bentley's description of the catalytic converter,
&gt;decided I'd been misinformed, got out my bike &amp; plugged in Tugboat.  I've
&gt;just turned the key... no sound.  I flipped the headlight switch on &amp; off, &amp;
&gt;Tug came to life.  Restart attempted... no sound.  Lights flipped &amp; YES!
&gt; I'll get battery voltage checked &amp; be ready to replace PO's Diehard, as well
&gt;as finding (yea Bentley!) &amp; bumping the solenoid, etc., etc.  Is it true-
&gt;will normal &amp; hill jump starts ruin my cat. con.?  The starter sounded
&gt;strong, but I do pull on the steering wheel when I come aboard, &amp; I'm always
&gt;trying to get the steering column covers to seat right to eliminate the
&gt;rubbing squeal they produce.  I'm off- can't send a progress report 'till
&gt;late tonight.
