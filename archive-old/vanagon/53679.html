&gt;Hello all,
&gt;
&gt;My parents are currently in Riverside, CA, and are in need of a new 
&gt;front wheel bearing on their '89 Jetta.
&gt;
&gt;They got a quote of $150 from one place, which sounds high to me.
&gt;
&gt;Any suggestions of a reputable shop in the area?
&gt;
&gt;Please e-mail direct asap. Thanks!

Try Walter's VW out in Banning, They deal in air cooleds but could probably
get you pointed in the direction of a reputable shop.  I used to live
in Riverside, but I do my own work.
