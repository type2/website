Subject: Re: gas heater fuel pump needed

Dieter

I've got the address &amp; phone number of the NA distributor for these 
parts. It's at home, but I'll check later if no one else comes up with it 
before then. You might check the archives, though I'll bet it would take 
some time with all the traffic on these heaters. 

Thanks! Joe

&gt; Well, I've had two different shops tell me I need a fuel pump for my
&gt; gas heater (Eberspacher BN4).  I suspect the first shop managed to
&gt; break the pump, since the problem I asked them to look at originally
&gt; was that it heated fine, but the fan would sometimes never cut out.
&gt; In any case, does anyone have any ideas on where to find a fuel pump
&gt; for this guy?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks.
