&gt;I've noticed that my coolant refill bottle seems to run dry, in the space of
&gt;about a week.  The engine was recently fixed for a colant leak and the
heads
&gt;rebuilt.
&gt;
&gt;1.) Is loss from the refill tank normal?
&gt;2.) Where do I check for leaks?

I have the same problem.  As far as I know, all coolant leaks were fixed
and I STILL have a regularly dry overflow bottle.  I'll be looking for
suggestions, too.


    *********************************************************************
  If the system has just been rebuilt, and there are no discernable leaks, my
guess is that there may be some residual air in the cooling system.  I not
sure how you bleed the system properly -- it would seem the radiator way
up front makes a good air trap if it were to have been drained.

  In any event, I would guess the air is slowly being purged from the system
as you drive -- being replace by coolant from the resevoir.  So keep an eye
on the level and refill as necessary, and I would think the rate of &quot;loss&quot; will
diminish over time.  It may take awhile, higher fluid velocities =  higher
speed driving with front and rear heater valves open will speed the
process.

   And if that isn't it, I had this problem: to the left of the resevoir is a plastic
expansion tank with a sensor in a recess on the top.  In my situation, the
O-ring on the sensor deteriorated and allowed fluid to puddle in the recess. 
Sometimes it stayed in the recess, sometimes it overflowed into the engine
compartment, but always on to a sheet metal shelf so you'd never see it on
the ground.  In either case, it would evaporate over time so I'd never find
any wet spots.  I eventually found it by looking at the system  ( engine
compartment open) with the engine hot and running  -  under pressure you
could see the fluid being forced out.  A new O-ring was a simple fix.

   Good luck,
