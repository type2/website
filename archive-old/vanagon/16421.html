Subject: Re: porsche heads question (sorta VW)

&gt;hi,
&gt;
&gt;have a set of nice heads that i got with a parts car, and thought that they
&gt;were for an air cooled VW, but on closer inspection they look like old
&gt;porsche heads.
&gt;

Probably from 914/912E &lt;1976, possibly 912/356 older style engine &lt;1967. 
There is a Porschephiles list, 900+ members and lots of traffic. I'll look 
for the # in a parts catalogue for you.    tim s.
