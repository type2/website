Subject: Unexpected trip part 2 (finally)

Sorry for the delay, I hate it when the computer crashes!

I awoke the second morning at 1:30, sweating.  I guess that i didn't 
need that second sleeping bag along with the electric heater (120 
Volt).  I got brreakfast going on my one burner propane stove, and by 
4:00 (after doing the dishes) I was ready to hit the road.

Passing through Columbus OH at that time of the day was very relaxing.  
Nice skyline too.  I did notice one problem though, the wind had 
started to come up.....

By the time I hit Cleveland, the radio was announcing a severe wind 
warning with gusts up to 50mph!!  But, with no other choice, I pressed 
on, trying to keep a lot of clearance on either side of the bus for 
that unexpected gust of wind.  And there were many!!  

As I got into snow country, I found about two inches on the ground.  
What a treat!!!  I hadn't gotten a chance to make a REAL snowball for 
about 5 years!!  I took the opportunity to make, and through my first.  
I through it at the Olga, but was careful to miss her...Didn't want to 
press my luck!!  Then I called my wife to brag.

The battle with the wind persisted all the way into New York.  I was 
pleased to see that NY finally raised the speed limit to 65 as my 
odometer passed 1,000 for this trip....

My only complaint so far was my gas milege, only about 18.5 average, 
but it certainly could have been worse!!  So far (except for hills and 
the occasional head wind), I had been able to maintain 60 to 65 mph, 
with about a quarter of the distance remaining to the floor.

Another couple of gas stops, and I had arrived safe and sound in 
Syracuse.....

More to come..........
