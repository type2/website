Subject: VW Motoring news flash!!

Just had a quick shuftie through a copy of October's VW Motoring and they've
got an article about VWs on the internet. Lee's web page gets a bit of
coverage and so does the Vintage web page and there's a brief mention of the
vintagvw list (but no address). I can't remember the name of the writer but
it didn't ring any bells. There's no mention of the Vanagon list at all,
which is a bit surprising, and the whole story is a bit thin on facts and
written with a touch of that happening-internet-media-hype-bullshit style. I
wonder how long it will be now until V**lksw**ld (spit) 'discover' the net.
