&gt;I remember something being continually posted about the solenoid.  Is this
&gt;the problem?

I'd give it a try.  The best way to check is to connect a 10 or 12 guage
wire to the post on the starter that goes to the start-on wire (do this in
addition to the regular start-on lead(you may need to use a Y connector))
put a wire nut on the end of this wire that is dangleing in the engine
compartment (the wire nut is to insulate the exposed end of this wire, as it
will have power going to it durring normal starting.

the next time it wont start, check to see if there is a voltage at this
point.  Your are looking for anything, 0VDC=bad start switch &gt;0VDC proceed.
Next tuch the end of this wire to the positive terminal(take the van out of
dear before this step) did it start?
If yes, you need a hot start solenoid.  if not, you probably need a main
starter solenoid. (the main starter solenoid ran almost $70 at my FLAP, but
he sold the Bently Book for $75, he said he was to embarased by the price to
do a full markup on it)
