One can get a catalog from Kennedy Engineering by writing:

KEP
38830 17th St. E.
Palmdale, CA  93550

or call:  (805) 272-1147

I can't vouch for their adapter kits, but the tech guy I talked to on the 
phone is very knowledgable.  You just have to communicate *precisely* what 
it is that you want to know.  He did't seem to have much patience for 
general meandering questions, like &quot;where is the best place to mount a 
radiator.&quot;  Get the catalog first, acquaint yourself with it, then call 
and ask away.
