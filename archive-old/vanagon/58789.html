&gt;I have an blinker problem with my '87 Weekender that I hope somebody can

&gt;- When I turn on my right blinker, the brake lights blink in addition to the
&gt;right turn signals.
&gt;- When I brake, my right turn signals (front and back) light up in addition
&gt;to the brake lights.
&gt;- When I turn on my emergency flashers on, my turn signals and my brake
&gt;lights come flash. I don't think the brake lights should blink.

Look at your symptoms and pick out the one point in common to both the
problem areas, the right turn signal and the brake lights. The brake lights
are wired parallel to each other and have a separate power supply from the
brake light switch to the lights. The turn signals are also wired parallel
on each side and the power to the lights comes from the turn signal switch
through the turn signal relay. The only place in common, I am assuming the
harness from front to rear is in good condition, is at the right rear tail
light. Pull it out and remove the wires and see if the problem remains, if
it goes away then reinstall the wires one at a time to see when the problem
returns. Be sure you start with the brown ground wire, if you connect two
light wires with a bad ground the current will flow through the second bulb
to any ground it can find. You problem could very well be simply a bad
ground. HTH
