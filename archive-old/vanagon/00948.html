&gt;There have been quite a few posts regarding,&quot;...what is the best tire for my
&gt;Bus/Vanagon...&quot;  I was wondering if there is a FTP site that has tire safety
&gt;and/or quality information.  Perhaps there is a general consumer information
&gt;source online?

i don't know about an 'on-line' source, but there is the NHTSA WATS line,
1-800-424-9393 ... this will give you a recorded menu of stuff about auto
safety, recalls, etc., and one of the choices is tires. but i think it's
mostly how to read the stuff on the side of the tire. it's free, and takes
about two weeks for the stuff to arrive.
