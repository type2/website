&gt;As you guys already know, the 85 Vanagon has the round headlights.  I
&gt;however, love the German look of the rectangular lights.  Any tips on
&gt;such a facelift?

it's real easy ... but expensive. :(  the only mechanical problem is a little
tab that supports one corner of the headlight fixture. on the round headlights,
this tab is on the top. on the square headlights, it's on the bottom (of the
big opening behind the grill). i think that's right. i may have it reversed.

anyway, when i first got my 88 bus (with square headlights), i really really
didn't like the look of the squares ... i wanted rounds! so i came up with
the parts (which is, by the way, a lot harder than you might think. the
junkyards don't want to sell just the headlights and grill unless the bottom
part of the front &quot;clip&quot; is smashed).

and it took me all of about an hour (maybe 1.5 hours) to swap it over ...
and i've rather slow at things like that. :)  i had to splice the wiring
to the new bulb connectors (and that meant putting TWO ground wires into one
new wires ... the square lights have two separate ground wires and two power
wires (high and low beams)).

but i'm happy with it. i don't think i would do it again (so if i ever get
another square-eyed bus, i'll just leave it). mostly because of the cost.

going in reverse, that is, putting the square lights into a round-eyed bus
should also be very easy. the separation of the wiring would be the hardest
thing ... you'd need to separate the high and low beam wires (already done
on your connector) and split the ground wire into a Y ... to service both
of the new bulbs. and fabricate  the &quot;tab&quot; to hold the fourth corner of the
headlight fixture. but the cost is gonna get you. :(
