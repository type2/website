Subject: Re: bus generations


Joel,

In regard to having barndoors and Syncros as seperate generations...
I think you are adding more confusion than anything else here. VW
only recognizes 4 generations....

To say a barndoor is a separate generation is like saying that 1200cc
busses are a separate generation from 1500cc busses, or that non disk
H:Fhb,e(\a+xsM
brake T2 busses are a different generation than disk brake T2 busses.

IMHO,

Ric
