&gt;Does everyone know that the ignition key unlocks the gas cap?  I had been
&gt;using the gas cap key just like the previous owner of my '84 Vanagon had

you mean the non-ignition key that i thought was for the glove box??? hmmm.
i've always just used the ignition key. never even thought about that other
one. huh.

ok. how about the cruise control. factory-installed only. mine can be
'released' by pushing the Resume switch/slide/button (instead of having to
hit the brakes or the clutch). can anybody else do this, or is mine broken?
well, not broken but just different?  i kinda like it that way, cause i can
disengage the cruise without flashing my brakes at the folks behind me ...
like if my cop-spotter starts squealing. :)
