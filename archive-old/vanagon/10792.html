Subject: Re: Oil cooler

&gt;  If it has a type IV motor, and I don't know if canadian buses do, and it's 
&gt;  leaking at the front of the engine then it's not the oil cooler. The type
&gt;  IV oil cooler is at the left rear of the engine, behind cylinder #4. You
&gt;  can see a bit of it from underneath. I'd be more suspicious of a leaky
&gt;  pushrod tube seal or rocker cover - Neither of which requires removing the
&gt;  engine to repair.

David,

Type IV engine it is--dual carb 1800cc--with what appears
to be about 108k on the speedo(could be 208k for all I know).
Oxidised red paint and an ugly hack job in the roof for a vent.
None of which I'm responsible for.  I did locate the cooler and
it is at the back left cylinder.  However I still suspect it as 
the culprit because it only leaks when it it running.  I think
that the leak makes its way to the tin covering the cylinders and
sort of makes its way to the front and down.  Did that make any 
sense?  But I will check it again.  --Ralf
