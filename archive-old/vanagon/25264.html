Subject: Westy on CBS News Last Night
Date: Fri, 22 Sep 95 7:32:53 EDT

Anyone else notice that on the CBS evening news bit about
the unexpected snowfall in Nebraska, etc in the very first little
clip there was a yellowish probably 68-73 pop top Westy covered
with snow to the right of the newscaster sitting on the street
in the background.  Luckily I don't think there was a tree on it.
Looked pretty nice in the few seconds it was on.
