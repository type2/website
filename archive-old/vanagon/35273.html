Subject:  buses in parking garages

** Reply Requested When Convenient **

Hey all,

Well, since we're on the subject, would a regular '78 bus fit in a 6'9&quot;
parking garage??  

By the way, electrical goofiness is somewhat fixed.  I cleaned up the
existing grounds and found a couple more loose ground wires just lying
around the engine compartment so I cleaned those up and grounded
them and things are working better.  The side marker light now works
and the brake light now works correctly.  However, when the right turn
signal is on and the taillight is lit, they blink alternately, i.e. when the
flasher blinks on, the taillight dims and then the taillight returns to normal
brightness when the signal blinks off.  Weird.  Also, the back-up light on
the right side is significantly dimmer than the one on the left, and it's not
the bulb because I switched 'em to check that.  I suspect more grounding
problems as well as dirty connections.  Over spring break I will take that
whole assembly out and clean everything up all nice and shiny :) . 
Thanks for the help all!

Sean
