Subject: Parting Out Another Bus

I am now parting out a '78 Bus, as well as the two '63 Deluxe 
Busses, the '76 Westy, and remaining parts from various other
busses.  As with the last couple of busses I posted, I hope to gut 
the '78 over the next week, and then immediately send the carcass 
to the crusher.  Engine, gas tank, drivers seat, and axle beam are 
all either not for sale, already sold, or no good.  Pretty much 
everything else is there.  Anyone need anything?
