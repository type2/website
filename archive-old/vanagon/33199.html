Subject: RE: Ignition switch on '71


&gt;I have had this stange thing occur after installing my ignition.
&gt;I turn the key to start it and it cranks but won't start until
&gt;I let go of the ignition.  This tells me that the juice to the
&gt;coil is getting cut off when I operate the starter.  Very strange.

Some '71s have a third switch position called &quot;Accessory&quot;, which is
for the radio, heater fan if any, etc. It is on when the ignition is on,
but cuts off as you crank the engine, on the theory that saving a few amps
while the starter draws 100+ will somehow make a difference (well, if
your electrical system is on its very last legs, maybe it will).

You might have accidentally connected your coil wire to this position
instead of the &quot;coil&quot; position? Sorry, I don't know what color the
wires are.

In a probably-unrelated note, I had a '75 Ford Mustang II (ever seen a
car bounce, rattle, and shake on a perfectly smooth, newly-paved freeway
with new tires and shocks?), which started doing this. In that case, it
was a chronic problem with the ignition switch which had to be replaced,
not a mis-connected wire. This was common to Fords of the era, but
probably has nothing to do with VW problems, so *never mind*.
