I'm looking for a '63 &quot;deluxe&quot; model microbus!  Fair to good/excellent
condition is about the only necessity.  Of course, it would also be
helpful if the bus was within a short driving distance of Raleigh, NC.
If there are any leads, please let me know.  Thanks.

Please respond to ppetrina_at_ppoe.coe.ncsu_dot_edu
