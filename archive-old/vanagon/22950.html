Subject: RE: Oil Temperature Gauge/ air cooled bus


&gt;I want to put an oil temperature gauge and sensor in my '77 westy. 
Wondering
&gt;whether or not to go with a dip stick style.


I just ordered and received an electric oil temp gauge from JC Whitney,
and also got the sender they recommend. Turns out it is a screw-in
sender, that APPEARS to be the same thread as the oil-pressure
sensor on my '70 bus engine (installed in a '71 bus-- long story).

Haven't installed this thing yet-- no time. I'm wondering a little,
how to keep the idiot-lite pressure sensor. Maybe a Tee fitting?
I would have thought that the temp sensor would need to stick
its silvery little end into a FLOWING stream of oil, for an accurate
reading. But I could be wrong.

Anyone have any comments on these gadgets? Let 'em rip!
