Subject: Carbs on '72 Camper

My idle cut-off valve on my left (stock) carb on my 1972 VAN is stripped out. 
To remedy this I stuck a teflon coated 8mm course thread bolt in the hole.  At
least it's not leaking fuel from there anymore.   Questions. 1) What harm am I
doing or problems am I creating?  2) Eventually I am going to fix this, I hear
(see) a lot of discussions about Webers.  Is this an upgrade that is worth
while? what is the merits of a Weber over the stock Solex? 

Thanks for your wisdom.

david
