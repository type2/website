&gt; now,,,,we all know that Alabama is not really part of the united
&gt; states...at lesat, in its eyes..:)
&gt; 
&gt; (got lots of family that lives there, and lived there for many years
&gt; myself...)
&gt; 
&gt; and, if i remember correctly, alabama doesnt even require liability
&gt; insureance on cars. at least, not to get tags. (my grandparents have
&gt; lived there for over 60 years, off an on, and i dont think any one in the
&gt; famiily that still lives there has ever had any auto insurance....)
&gt; 
&gt; thois state has one of the greatest (for us old car owners anyhow)
&gt; antique tag policy in the states, to my knowldge..
&gt; 
&gt; you pay a one time fee, of ~30 dollars (last i checked), and you get a
&gt; nice little antique vehicle tag. and you never have to register again.
&gt; nice, eh? and, again on memory here, it has a rolling age of 20 years....
&gt; (that is, 20 years old is consiered antique..:)
&gt; 
&gt; and there are no checks, emmisions, or otherwise, that one hasto worry
&gt; about either. you walk in, tell 'em a few things, and you get tags. even
&gt; on new cars. (again! memory...may have changed, but i havavnt heard
&gt; ggramma bitch about not being able to register her new 96 grad prix...)
&gt; 
&gt; so its likely that this dealer just told 'em it was a 97 beetle, and they
&gt; gave him tags for it...
&gt; 
&gt; just ideas...

I know in Ohio dealers don't put tags on cars. That's the purchaser's
responsability. The fact that they already have tags, and they're still
for sale might suggest a title problem.
