&gt;Volks,
&gt;Have 87GL w/rear heater and no manual, only the Bentley which can't help
&gt;me. I need someone to tell me the position of all four knobs for maximum
&gt;COLD! Down here in the Houston Area just the wafting of heat from
&gt;anywhere is of concern, and I have figured out exactly how to ensure all
&gt;vent controls are in maximum cold, meaning for use with A/C, that is no
&gt;hot water in front or rear heater cores and no HOT Texas outside air
&gt;getting in. I understand the bottom two control knobs on the four
&gt;vent/heater controls are for the rear heater, someone tell me how to
&gt;position the entire vent/heater panel to ensure the A/C will be most
&gt;efficient on recycle mode.

Mark, I have the Owners Manual to my 1985 GL. I will be happy to scan
the page that explains the controls and e-mail you a JPG of it. Let me
know if you would like me to do so.
