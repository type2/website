Subject:       [F] Re: WD-40 starting fluid; fishing lure

&gt; I met a guy at Manderfield Reservoir in Utah (anybody else know where that
&gt; is?  I think I'm probably the only one that ever drove a splittie up

Never heard of it?  Northern Utah?  There's a Scofield Reservoir up 
in them thar hills..

&gt; there!), while I was fishing years back.  We weren't catching anything,
&gt; while he pulled all kinds of fish (well, trout, actually) out of the water.
&gt; As he was leaving, he suggested I try spraying the worms with WD-40.
&gt; Didn't have any with me, so I couldn't.

Maybe a Utah Urban Legend?  I've heard it, and tried it last summer 
too!  We were trolling on Yellowstone Lake last summer using those 
little tripple teasers.  I shot them with some WD-40 to see what 
would happen.

Final results:  I caught lots of trout with or without it!  

Reasons:  Well I doubt the WD-40 could help in this situation.  I 
understand the fish bite the triple teasers because they glitter, not 
because they are shaped like little fish.  I doubt they could smell 
the WD anyway since they are moving along fairly fast (unlike a worm).

I think a new experiment is in order!
