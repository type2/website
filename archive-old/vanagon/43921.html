Subject: more 75 westy ignition? stuff

well, the flameage, um, possibly latent gasses sitting around? anyway..

after pushing bus into yard and working on my 74 super, i decided this 
morning to get brave. tossed the dizzy back in, set timing, and went to 
start her up. it fired, and began to run!! had to keep foot totally on 
gas tho, and it just barely ran. so, befor it could get hot, i stoped it, 
and got ready to get dirty, and set the valves. &lt;yeah yeah, planned to do 
that long ago!&gt; so after that, started it up again, and vwalah! it ran. 
like shit, but it ran. sounded like a major compressiion leak somewhere. 
it idled sortof, and ran sort of, at full throttle it even sounded decent!

so i cut it off, went back, and what do i know? smoke seeping out between 
the seal on #3 spark plug wire. pull wire out, and lots of exhaust 
smelling smoke comes out. so, question is this time, ideas on the cause? 
i assume that is where it felt the compession was lost, and the power?  
anyway...


TIA..
