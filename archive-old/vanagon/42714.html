Subject: RE: awnings, what I've learned

Hi Everyone.  With regards to the anchors on my awning, I neglected 
to mention in my post that I don't have the metal anchors attached to 
my van.  Couldn't stand the thought of drilling holes in the van.

I just anchor the support rods to the ground with a metal tent peg.  
There are 2 holes in the foot to accomodate a peg.

The Apollo awning does not have horizontal supports running in a &quot;V&quot; 
like the A &amp; E awning.  The fabric sags very little.  I always drop 
the back corner to aid water runoff (like a waterfall when it 
rains!).

Hope this clarifies.
Harry.

&gt; I don't want to drill any holes in my van's body (or my body either for 
&gt; that matter), so I was planning on running the support poles vertically to 
&gt; the ground. I tried this setup with the A&amp;E awning at an RV store and it 
&gt; works fine. You just have to secure the ends of the poles to the ground 
&gt; somehow (tent stake) to keep them from getting knocked or blown out from 
&gt; under the awning. To keep the awning from sagging, there are two horizontal 
&gt; supports running in a V from the roller to the outer corners of the awning.
