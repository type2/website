Subject: VR6 Eurovan sighted??!

As part of the Cold Weather Testing group in Bemidji (blah, blah Dan--
 we all know...) VW has replaced the Sharan they had here with a EV...
 
It is a panel :)

and something else---  
it has an enormous exhaust pipe diameter (pipe 
envy?).  Could this be the venerable VR6??  seemed way out of 
proportion for a 5 cylinder engine.  can anyone tell me if the 5 cyl 
engine normally has an exhaust pipe diameter the size of a tennis 
ball?

i'll try to track it down while they are refilling it sometime and 
see if they'll tell me anything.  might be some interesting 'extras' 
in the back of that panel area too.
