Had a really interesting problem when I first got my '66 which is related, but 
probably not the answer to your electrical problem.  (are you sure you have the 
right bulbs?)  Anyway, the signals wouldn't work unless you hit the brakes at 
the same time, and eventually neither would the wipers.  The only thing that 
worked constantly was the headlights.  One time I was driving and it started to 
rain - I had to hit the brakes every time I wanted the wipers to sweep the 
windshield.  I was convinced that there were major wiring problems and so 
neglected it for awhile.   Long story short, I brought it in to see Frank (the 
master mechanic) for some front end work and asked him to check it out.  Turns 
out the battery wasn't secured and had slid back into the rear lights, shorting 
everything out and causing the curious connections described above.  He secured 
it with a plastic strap and the problem was solved.  I felt fairly stupid, but 
hey what can you do.

In any case, good luck with your new wheels.

Mike
