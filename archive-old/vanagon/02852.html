Subject: Digest


	Sorry if this has already been covered, but it there any way
to get a digest of the mail, like on vintagvw.  I can't sort through
all the traffic to get important messages (ie. getting a job upon 
graduation) but I still enjoy reading the van mail.  

	If so how ??

	Thanks
	Brent
