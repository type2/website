|Need advice!
|
|We're in way northern Cal. and saw the note on the syncro with 90k miles at 
a
|dealership in way southern Cal.  Thinking of offering a trade for our newly
|gotten 91 GL westy that only has 60k miles.  It's about 10 or 12 hours 
drive
|for us and buying a vehicle blind is scarey.  If we're really serious, a 
kind
|soul that lives about an hour away  has offerred to possibly check it out 
for
|us. We've been wanting a syncro because the snow in the mountains makes it
|tough to drive around here.  I'm sure we'd use it but 25,000 bucks for a
|vehicle with 90k on it?!  Should we be serious?
