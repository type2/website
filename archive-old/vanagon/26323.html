A bus-friend of mine gave me some trivia tidbits tonite:

Our friend who is getting the '50/'51 or whatever would like to know this...

The barndoors had emblems that mount with 3 studs intead of 4, in a trangular
pattern.

The _early_ barndoors (50/51) had a cast aluminum or magnesium emblem,
not a stamped steel one.  They also had an emblem on the _back_

Barndoors don't have a dash, really, 'cept for deluxes.  They just have
an instrument pod with a beetle speedo cluster.  There is a big grab rail
on the passenger side, right under the windshield, and a similar looking
footrest.

Also, the taillights for the '50 are s'posed to be different, but I'm
not clear how.  A guy I know claims to have an NOS set of them.  I wonder
how much he would want...

Most of this stuff I already knew, 'cept the cast emblem stuff

Lots more tidbits where these came from...
