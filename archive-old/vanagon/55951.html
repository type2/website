Subject: erratic idle

Does anyone have any ideas why my 83 wasserboxer would idle smooth and then
rough very quickly. I have replaced the plugs and the wires, cap and rotor
too. I checked the vacuum lines and I couldn't find anything. I must admit
that I made a gigantic error when changing the air filter. I started the
motor with the plug to the air flow meter off. I am guessing that this
caused the O2 sensor to be fouled because it smelled like it was running
very rich. I bought a new O2 sensor but I am waiting to get my new exhaust
pipe on mon. Also, I have alittle exhaust leak, but this never seemed to
matter before. I am desparate and it is driving me absolutley crazy. I
checked the AFM with a volt meter and it was within specs. The timing is
correct too. I am obsessed with smoothing out the idle. I tried checking
things according to the bentley manual and everything seemed to be working
correctly. The idle is smooth and then rought very rhythmicially. Also if I
hit the gas off of idle the engine stumbles. It has good power mid and
upper range but the bottom edge is a little sluggish. Any ideas would be
appreciated. Thanks in advance.

Dave
