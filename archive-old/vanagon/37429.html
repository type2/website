Subject: internet mailing lists list

A few people have asked for info about other internet mailing lists, so
here you go.

Look in the USENET newsgroups (the same place you find
rec.autos.makers.vw.aircooled) for &quot;news.answers.&quot;  This is the place
where FAQs for various places are posted, as well as lists like the
&quot;Publically accessible internet mailing lists&quot; list.  The last time I
looked this was in at least 20 parts and contains hundreds and hundreds
of email lists.

I'm sure this is on a web page somewhere, anyone know?

Another useful site if you're into FTP is &quot;rtfm.mit_dot_edu&quot; which
has FAQs etc.

Enjoy.
