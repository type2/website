Subject: My Own Private FAQ

Having owned my 1986 Vanagon GL for about a month now, (my first watercooled
VW) several questions come to mind as I motor along:

 I wonder if there's a way to test the coolant for contaminents?  I'm getting
ready to do a coolant change and I'd like to get the existing fluid tested to
see if there's major chunks of engine/radiator/hoses floating around in
there...

 Would an electronic ignition set up smooth out the idle?  I wonder what system
would work the best?  I had a Perlux ignitor in my '67 for a while and it
worked great...

 The tires (Goodyear Arriva P185/70R14) are getting pretty thin.  I'd like
tires that fill the wells a little more on a stock 14&quot; VW steel wheel.  Maybe
Michelins...

 This shifter seems sort of stiff, but then this Vanagon has 129k on the
clock.  I rebuilt the shift linkage on my '67 Bus and it shifts nicely now. 
But I'll bet it's a little more complicated on this rig.  I wonder what parts
I'd have to replace to shorten the throws and take the mystery out of this
pattern...

 The Sewfine catalog hardly mentions Vanagons and the Auto-Mat catalog is a
little short on details.  I wonder if anyone on the Vanagon list could
recommend a good place to buy carpeting...

 How come the left turn signal ticks normally and the right turn signal ticks
about twice as fast?  Is a bulb burned out somewhere?

 I wonder when that Bentley manual I ordered from Mr. Salmon is gonna get
here...

 Sometimes the digital clock works.  Sometimes it doesn't.  I wonder how hard
it would be to replace...

 ...and on and on.  If you can provide insight to these burning issues, I'd
really appreciate it.
