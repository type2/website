&gt;I was looking at my fuse block today, comparing it to the diagram in 
&gt;Bentley (pp 97.102) and noticed that I was missing the 2nd stage radiator

&gt;be located elsewhere? What does this relay do exactly?

Bentley manual is incorrect.  the second stage relay is located beyond the
fuse box mounted to the side of the van.  It is a white relay and can be
identified by the fuse link attached to the base.  You will probably have to
remove the fuse box to reach or see it.  With the larger fan motor used with
the 2.1 and A/C, the current would melt the fuse box.  That's why it was
relocated.
