Subject: Re: &quot;Driveability&quot;  and more on heater cable snap

Ah, so that's the secret..
&lt;snip&gt; desc. of general acceloration weirdness &lt;snip&gt;
&gt; Is this what they refer to as &quot;driveability&quot;?  An experienced VW
&gt; mechanic who's driven it pronounced it normal for a Vanagon,&lt;snip&gt;

So sputter and spit are the way things go, eh? I learn 
more from this everyday. What I thought were indications 
of problems (or paranoia of same) are, in fact, 
standard equipment 'features' of vanagon operation.
More relaxation for my continued travels onward.. :)

jump back to other topic:

The klack sound that's coming from the air intake
failed to appear today, once warm.. 

I have managed to vise-grip the heater wire into near 
oblivion, as it came out about 3 inches and does not 
move in any direction now. I started it now,
how do I finish it? what is the other end of this 
control wire, specific to cold/heat control, attached 
to? Will I have to wait till summer to avoid frostbite?

The continuing saga
