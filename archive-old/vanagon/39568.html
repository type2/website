&gt;Subject: Search for 82 exhaust manifold
&gt;Message-ID: &lt;9604102301.AA21976_at_alfred.ccs_dot_carleton_dot_ca&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Hi all:
&gt;
&gt; Since putting the 82 Westy in storage for the winter, I have been in dig=
&gt;est
&gt;mode. Now with the 82 back on the road it's Vanagon time once again. I am=
&gt;
&gt;looking for the driver's side exhaust manifold for an 82 aircooled 2.0 li=
&gt;tre
&gt;engine. This is the second manifold that has broken in two in the same
&gt;number of years. I belive it is made of cast iron. The exhaust system is
&gt;equipped with an O2 sensor and a cat. The exhaust ports are rectangular. =
&gt;The
&gt;exhaust system is California based meaning that the manifold is peculiar
&gt;only to those exhaust systems equipped with the sensor and cat. A
&gt;passenger's side manifold will not fit. Nor will those from the 49 states=
&gt; or
&gt;Canada.
&gt;
&gt;If you have one or know of a place where I can obtain one, please e-mail =
&gt;me
&gt;directly. I will pay for shipping.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Thanks - David Carment '82 Westy - Vanagon list member since the summer o=
&gt;f ' 94.


Mine broke also.  Mine was cast only at the flanges that bolt to the head, and
welded steel of some wierd alloy elsewhere.  The local VW shop TIG welded the
tube back together for me with stainless steel rod.  He charged me $40.  So
far, so good.  BTW, it broke right about here:

                         break
                           |
                           v
                ______________|
               /  ______   ___ 
               | |      | |   |
              _| |_    _| |_

You may be able to get some local guy to weld it for you. Warn him that VW
uses wierd alloys.
