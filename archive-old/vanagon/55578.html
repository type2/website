Subject: Re: Replace Headlights?

The Hella H4 combination is the way to go in my opinion. I retrofitted the
rectangular headlights on my 87 to this system. I don't know about the
JCWhitney &quot;Hella H-4 Quartz-Halogen Headlights&quot; you refer to, but $17 to $25
sounds too good to be true for the headlight assembly and the bulb. I think
I paid around $40 or so for the combination. You have to buy a new headlight
for the H4 bulbs-they won't work with the stock headlights.

&gt;I seem to remember someone recommending replacing the lamps with Hellas.  My 84
&gt;has Sylvania lamps now.  What Hella lamp would be a direct replacement for
&gt;these, and would such a move be likely to improve lighting (I know there is the
&gt;issue of low voltage in the wiring, but I'm not ready to re-wire yet)?
&gt;
&gt;In JCWhitney they show two types of Hella H-4 Quartz-Halogen Headlights,
ranging
&gt;in price from $17 to $25 dollars, which they say are for &quot;off-road use&quot;.  They
&gt;also show a Hella &quot;Vision Plus High Performance Halogen Headlight&quot; with an HB2
&gt;bulb to replace &quot;existing H6024 or H6054 headlights&quot;, running $40.  Any advice
&gt;on what I should buy?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks to all.
