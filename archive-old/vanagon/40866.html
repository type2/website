Subject: Matt's Screaching

After I did my top-end rebuild last winter, I heard some screeching for a 
while once the bus warmed up. Turned out to be the generator rubbing on 
some bent metal in the fan housing. It wore the metal away and screeches 
no more. I have a spare doghouse shroud, so I didn't stress out too much 
about the problem once I figured out what it was. Perhaps when he did the 
fanbelt thing he moved the generator just enough to cause this.
