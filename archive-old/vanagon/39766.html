Subject: Vanagon Pilot Brg Finally Out

Hi All,

I finally have the 3/4 vaporized pilot brg out of the crankshaft hole on 
my 84 Vanagon.  After consulting with several list members, I decided to 
enlist my new birthday present tool--a Dremel moto-tool.  With very small 
grinding stone I preceeded to grindout a section of the spun out metal 
bearing casing after I duct taped the surrouding area by the flywheel 
shims &amp; seal.  After about 40 minutes the old scrap brg came loose.  The 
funny part about this ordeal is that I referenced a 2.0 TIV bus crank from 
a rebuild project I have and the pilot brg in back of the crank is in the 
same shape as my wasser Vanagon's!  I guess I'll be doing this routine 
again, but next time it will be on my workbench, not on my back under the 
Vanagon in my driveway!  8-)
