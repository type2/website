Subject: Re: Towing a Syncro on all 4's

Jim thanks for your insight.My Bently is still packed away w/ all my books in
a storage unit in Ramona,Ca., so I had to go by the warning listed in the
owners' manual.You may be correct on the fact that a tow is similar to a
coast, but w/ a coast the engine is running(maybe) and the input shaft throws
lube to the gears(maybe insignificant).I realise that your standard issue
&quot;dufus&quot; tow operator would lift the rear and destroy the viscous unit by
spinning up the front with the rear immobilized, therefore the caveat, but im
not entirely convinced that VW didnt intend this solely for the &quot;dufers&quot;.But,
If youve towed w/o any trouble for some distances...it's probably OK.
