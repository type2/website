Subject: EV A/C problem solved...


Well after a bit of detective work I think I have found the 
A/C and engine temp problem on my EV. I started at the
source...the temp switch on the radiator. Took off the
plug and jumped the leads. Normally this should turn
on the fan on low, and then on high. All that happened
was the fan relays turned on.

By using a combination of parts fiche, parts listing
and other stuff I found that in the circuit is the
temp switch, the relays and then some sort of
ballast resistor for low speed and high speed operation
of the fan. I believe that these resistors
are dead. 

There seems to be, however, a &quot;fail safe&quot; fan switch
somewhere which kicks the fan into high at temps
above 230F. However, this only works with the 
key in the &quot;on&quot; position.

It sucks not having a proper wiring diagram! My dealer
gave me a set of manuals for the EV, unfortunately
there isn't an electrical system one in the set.

Tomorrow, I'll hit the dealer for a couple of
these resistors...hopefully they know where
VW hid them ... I still haven't found where
they are located!

I'm also going to call VWUS and bitch at them for the
lack of availability of a workshop manual on the
EuroVan.
