&gt; My 64 has a very worn bushing on the center kingpin. Not to be confused
&gt; with the kingpins that the wheels are attached with. This is the one that
&gt; goes through the center of the top torsion bar. I would like to remove it
&gt; and replace the bushing without removing the entire front end. Is there 
&gt; an easy way to remove the ball joints from the tie rods? Any advice 
&gt; concerning these procedures would be greatly appreciated.

I believe the October '94 issue of Hot VWs described this problem along
with a step by step process to fix it.  If you don't subscribe, check out
your local library's periodicals archive.
