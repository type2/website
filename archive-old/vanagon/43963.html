Subject: Re: help-gas tank straps

&gt;That went fine.  But, now the straps won't come out.  There's nothing
&gt;holding them in, or is there?
&gt;
&gt;I took off the two front bolts, and the rear bolt which holds each strap in
place.  But those straps won't move!

The front sections of the straps are brazed/welded on.
