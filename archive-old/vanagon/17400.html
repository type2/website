Subject: Gas in face--

Thought many of you (Sami? and others who've been gassed excluded) might get
a kick out of this-

	Changed my fuel filter today.  Got gas all over my face.

Peace-
Jeff

ps-- oh yeah.  When I was done with the noxious endeavor I did indeed 
have a cigarette.  No foolin'.  Color me addicted  :-)
