&gt;Mercedes 207D (Westfalia camper), 1984, 5 Spd., 40K Kms, 7 pass,
&gt;sleeps 4 adults, exc. cond.  Never winter driven, very rare. $42,900
&gt;Now I wonder, did Westfalia convert this like a standard VW
&gt;Westfalia?  Has anyone seem one of these things?

yup. there's a fellow in town who has one show up in his yard every now and
then (don't know if he owns it, or if frequent visitors do). it is a Westfalia
... but it is a BIG sucker! very large, front engine-rear drive, diesel
engine. BIGGGG truck. :)
