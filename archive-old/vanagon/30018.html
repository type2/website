Subject: Honest Bay Area Mechanics?
From: Peter&amp;Varshna &lt;ztgst_at_eden_dot_com&gt;



Citizens:

I apologize in advance for  the lack of VW content, but last night my 
sister-in-law called me in tears.  She had taken her car into a San 
Francisco auto repair shop to track down a gas odor and before they were 
finished they were telling her she needed $1000+ of repairs.

She described the symptoms to me over the phone and from all I can tell 
she has a stuck choke, but seeing how she is in San Francisco and I'm in 
Austin there really is very little I can do for her. 

 I don't know why it is, but it seems every time this poor young woman 
goes into an auto repair place, they recognize that she knows little 
about cars and try to rip her off, and BIG.  That's why she was so upset 
when she called--- this is the third time this has happened to her this 
year.

She has a Suzuki Samurai (I know I know, but hey, it was given to her by 
her father) with 75k miles on it.  If anyone knows of an honest Bay area 
mechanic capable of working on this vehicle to whom I could refer her, I 
would greatly appreciate it. 

Cheers,

Peter.
