Subject:  Leak in new rebuilt Vanagon

I just found a coolant leek in 91 Carat that hase less thatn 1k on its
VW factoryt rebuilt engine.  It seems to be comming from the water pump 
line that is connected to the passenger side cylinder head. The leak is on the
(or near) the topmost bolt that protrudes from the head. I tried to tighten it
but the leak grows worse with pressure....Do you think I should complain to my
dealer that they didnot do a good job when they put the new block back together?
Thanks in Advance John.
