Subject: '84 Water Pump
Date: Tue, 28 Jun 94 11:19:56 EDT



I would first like to thank Frank Terhaar-Yonkers for loaning me his
Bentley Vanagon manual.  Mine should arrive any day now from Performance
Specialties.

My father and I replaced the water pump in my '84 Vanagon while I was on
vacation and although it was mostly an uneventful experience something
did happen that I think would be valuable to share.  The left side of the
water pump bolts up to the thermostat housing using two long bolts that
slide though the thermostat housing and thread into the water pump.  The
bolt closest to the rear of the van threads into a non-occluded portion of 
the water pump.  The other bolt, the one closest to the front of the van,
actually threads into the interior of the water pump.  The installation of 
the new pump appeared to go just fine with all of the bolts and nuts
tightening properly and no cross-threading.  All of the gasket surfaces
were cleaned and RTV was used to adhere the paper gaskets to the pump.
When the coolant was replaced it started hitting the ground like an ol'
cow relieving itself.  Turns out that the above mentioned bolt that threads
into the interior of the pump had run out of threads before it could
properly pull the two surfaces together.  Hard to tell the difference
from the end of a ratchet.  A couple of space washers fixed the problem. 
I should also mention that the water pump was purchased from NAPA and not
VW.  NAPA wanted $81 with a lifetime warranty and VW was $137.
