Eugene,

Someone posted this address to the list awhile back:

http://www.cpsc.ucalgary_dot_ca:80/~fridman/diy_efi/

It's a page for Do-It-Yourself Fuel Injection.  If you look under the
&quot;projects&quot; section there are two schematics for LED 02 sensors. They are
very simple circuits so I plan on doing this at some point (once I get
around to welding the threaded fitting to one of my heat exchanger tubes).
I remember pricing the parts I'd need through Digikey--I think it works out
to around $30 for the parts (plus the 02 sensor).
