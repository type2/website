&gt;        The 12V Sink pump and switch are completely shot, need new
ones.
&gt;Any suggestions as to where to locate these items or suitable
replacements?
&gt;
Not to bring up a bad name, but JC Whitney sells a pump that fits
                  ^^^^^^^^

Have you had problems with Whitney?

Maybe I'm the only one, but I've never had a problem with them or
their stuff, except once finding out the 300W amp they sold me
was 225W (they still advertise it as 300, same amp). Good amp,
works fine for 3 years now, could run the car with it, but it
says 225W on it.

I've ordered everything from steering boxes to stereos to leaf springs
to trailer kits (their 8x4 fold-up trailer is EXCELLENT) for many years,
with zero trouble. That's more than I can say for most other mail-order
companies. Some people on this list have mentioned problems they've
had-- see the archives.

But I thought I'd throw my two cents in.

Whitney oddities:

1.) Their shipping prices are weird-- high for small orders. Order lots
    of stuff on one order, the more heavy/bulky things the better.
2.) If they have to backorder something, they'll send you a notice
    saying so. About half the time, the backordered item arrives before
    the notice does.
