&gt;I believe the design weakness in VW water jacketed motor installations 
&gt;most commonly responsible for failures is their marginal heat rejection 
&gt;system.  Not only were heat rejection design errors common, but the gas 
&gt;motors developed a fearsome reputation for being easily damaged by 
&gt;over-heat conditions that other power plants would typically accept.  
&gt;Chrysler purchased and remarketed these motors with minor modifications 
&gt;in their early Plymouth Horizons and Dodge Omnis, and both kept their own 
&gt;records which each revealed unusually high incidence of over heating 
&gt;induced damage.  Their cooling systems were quite conventional, and 
&gt;remained nearly the same after they began using their own power plant, 
&gt;but that change ended the unusual incidence of over heating induced motor 
&gt;failures.


I'm confused here.  You start by talking about &quot;water jacketed&quot; engines,
implying the 1983 to 1991 wasserboxer engine, and then jump over to the
in-line engines of the Rabbit/Jetta variety that were used in the Chrysler
products.  Just what engines are you talking about here?

&gt;  Now I don't propose to address the causes for these motors' ungraceful 
&gt;sensitivity to occasional over heating, but I do think this group has the 
&gt;experience, insights, and talents necessary to develop a list of after 
&gt;market design improvements that can greatly lessen chances that van type 
&gt;vehicle owners will experience this violation of their reasonable 
&gt;expectations.
&gt;  Some well known or suspected design errors are:
&gt;
&gt;1) Weak and failure prone water pumps.  A more aggressive impeller design 
&gt;or what ever is required to increase coolant flow would be helpful. 
&gt;Bigger, spun faster, tighter clearances for improved idling flow, 
&gt;stacked?
&gt;
&gt;2) Water passages to and from the radiator from the motor were too small 
&gt;for their length on early units. I think this list's FAQ archive seems to 
&gt;suggest they were enlarged on vans after about 1983.

Yeah, they had much larger water passages after 1983, becasue before 1983-1/2
they had no water passeges at all - except in the diesel models.  In the case
of the diesel models there were no more water passages after 1983 because
there were no more diesels.  I'm still trying to figure out just what you're
talking about.

&gt;
&gt;3) Both progressively staged control switches for the two stage fan were 
&gt;specified with values that are either too high or were inappropriately 
&gt;located, and should be replaced by lower temperature switches or 
&gt;relocated to the motor or both.  Keeping the radiator within specified 
&gt;range is NOT an intelligent design goal, keeping the engine within good 
&gt;safe design range is an intelligent design goal. So these two radiator 
&gt;mounted sensor locations appear suspiciously like design errors.

It has been my experience that the coolant temperature stays just fine
withiut the fan even coming on.  Even when it's quite hot 100+ deg F.  The
coolant temperature stays normal with sufficient road-speed air flow.  If
stuck in traffic the fan comes on before the coolant temperature gets very
hot &amp; cools it right back down.


&gt;
&gt;4) The cooling system is already marginal 

I don't believe so &amp; I use the air conditioning PLENTY.  See above.

&gt;without reducing and preheating 
&gt;the remaining air flow to the main radiator due to air conditioner 
&gt;condenser location.  For that reason, alternative condenser locations 
&gt;should be examined.  An archive description of an engine transplant 
&gt;mentions that a rear wheel well area with high air flow successfully 
&gt;accepted an air to fluid heat exchanger. I'd fear impact damage, dried 
&gt;mud obstruction, and creating another location that would discourage 
&gt;frequent visual inspection and maintenance.  I am very attracted to the 
&gt;two high side rear loover openings, and would like to hear others 
&gt;thoughts about this.  If an electric fan is needed, unloading the 
&gt;engine's main radiator would justify it.
&gt;
&gt;5) The current inconveniently accessable bleeder valve for the radiator's 
&gt;top discourages frequent checks.  An extending tube leading to another as 
&gt;high or higher final valve?  Repositioning the current valve to accept a 
&gt;through-the-grill removable extention handle?
&gt;

There is nothing to check at the bleeder valve.  It's only use is during the
coolant replacement procedure.  Coolant checks are down at the tank behind
the rear license plate door and in the engine compartment.

&gt;6) Oil cooling capacity from oil heated surfaces outside the engine are 
&gt;too small and not optimally exposed to air flow.  It's always better to 
&gt;pull a btu from oil than the water based coolant.  A loover sized heat 
&gt;exchanger in the air dump?

Typical cars/engines do not have ANY &quot;cooling capacity from oil heated
surfaces outside the engine&quot;.  How could they be too small?  I suppose that
you might be describing an external oil cooer - but these are quite rare.
 The later wasserboxers do have a marginally effective oil cooler that
transfers heat to the coolant.

&gt;
&gt;  Now I know these thoughts aren't exhaustive but most are conceptually 
&gt;valid.  There's no excuse for designing a power plant installation that 
&gt;can't handle its peak thermo loads with some reserve.  What ideas give 
&gt;the most cooling bang per buck and per unit of required time?  Examining 
&gt;the diesel owners manual reveals that they did not offer air conditoning 
&gt;on diesel Vanagons (a sub set is Westy) because   Multiple guess for Car 
&gt;Talk:  1. Insufficient horsepower to pull additional load? or B. 
&gt;Insufficient cooling system reserve capacity?   ***************  Those of 
&gt;you who said B are correct. :&gt;

Perhaps B is also correct, but with just 48HP to push around a diesel westy,
the van didn't have ANY power to spare on air conditioning!


&gt;  Give some input.  How could we increase hot conditon coolant flow, 
&gt;better control the OEM two stage radiator fan, better position air 
&gt;conditoning condencer(s), improve radiator bleeder valve access, improve 
&gt;oil heat radiation, or what ever occurs to you.
&gt;	Thanks for listening and considering.  In a day or two, you may 
&gt;have thought up an elegant piece to this puzzle.  Please chew on this 
&gt;mind candy.
