Subject: RE 12 volt shop supply

I read with some interest the post on the use of an old car battery as a 12V
DC supply for someone's shop. I can only say as an electrical engineer, I
would never consider using an unsealed lead acid battery as an indoor power
source. In fairness to the author of the article, mention was made of placing
the battery outside and running wires into the shop area. According to the
national electrical code, all lead acid battery installations should be
vented to outside air. Unsealed lead acid batteries are notorious fire hazards.
Unfortunately, I know this from experience as a good friend of mine died in
a van fire which was started by a battery. The battery was mounted in a
plywood box in the back of the van and it was used to power his hydraulic power
wheel chair lift. Keep lead acid batteries vented at all times as explosive
hydrogen gas is generated from them if you are considering using them as
described in the article.
