Subject: Vanagon wannabe

OK.  We're looking for a Good Used Vanagon/78-79 Bus (with which to replace
the Mazda with the stupid automatic belts I hate so very much...) either an
air-cooled (in which case it has to have a gas heater) or a Wasserboxer.
If you know of anything in the Midlands, please let me know.  We're after a
7 passenger, not a Westy.  (Old though she may be, Frau Blucher the Camper
still serves us nicely.)  Ideally  it should be mint, have low miles, and
cost $250. (kidding, kidding ;)  )  Seriously, miles don't count as much as
care, and we'll pay the price for the right one.  We're in south-central
Iowa, 40-some-odd miles north of the Missouri line.

Thanks, y'all.
