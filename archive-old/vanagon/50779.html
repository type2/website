Subject: Looking for a Bus :-))))

Hey now!

	My son, who lives up in Lancaster, PA, is having some problems
with his Chevy and has decided it might be time to move up to a bus.  (He
must have fond early memories of tooling around in my '73.)  So, if there
are any listmembers who run across any leads for a decent, I'm thinking
breadloaf - Westy or non, in the $1-2K range up there in Southeast PA,
please contact he or I. 

Thanx!

&quot;The bus came by and I got on...&quot;
