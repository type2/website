Subject: California Vanagon Club?

Hi all,
I'm interested in forming a Vanagon (or VW van) club for California, or
perhaps just Southern California.  I've spoken with people at LiMBO about
making it a LiMBO affiliated club.  The focus would be on post-splittie vans
since splitties already have SOTO going stong in So. Cal.  I expect that we'd
have a gathering about 1/month and some kind of newsletter.

Any interest?

Any reccommendations?
