Did this a few days ago.  

A few pertinent factoids, as each car wash is different.  '80 Westi.
Vehicle is stationary and the equipment moves front/back to wash.
I folded the mirrors as close to the door as they would go, recessed 
antenna.  No top vent. 7 foot clearance car wash. Cost $2.50.  
Attendant did a prewash with big brush and soapy water.  No left 
mudflap on vehicle (fell off recently).  Ususally spend that much DIY 
with the spray/brush equipment.

Plusses - 

- Cleaned the oil/dirt goo from the rear casued by oil 
leakage on the the exhaust components, now fixed.

- Did a good job of removing bugs from front.

Minuses -

- Previous experience is that it removed one of the bumper 
end plastic pieces.  All are gone now anyway, so no problem there.

- Leakage at top of front windows.  Could be my old bus is just leaky.

- Didn't do the upper front doors with the flappedy washing things, 
as they are designed for vehicles with hoods.

- fun stuff

First stop after leaving car wash (to dry it) caused HUGE waterfall 
over front windshield from water in luggage tray, fun!

Now I can attach my list sticker!  Finally clean enough.  If I get 
REAL ambitious I'll wax it too!

Anyone take their westy through a car wash?  Problems?  Plusses (like the roof gets 
washed!!!).
