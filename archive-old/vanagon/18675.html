While staying at Bodega Dunes, I was convinced we'd encountered the world's
most stupid park ranger.  After reading what follows here below, I now
understand that people STAYING in parks can have even fewer brain cells.
(Do you suppose they killed theirs off with too much &quot;substance&quot; abuse?  :)

This isn't directly VW related, of course, but rather camping-pertinant;
just please don't tell me that any of these questions were asked by
some campers on OUR list!  :)  - /martha

  These are questions that people actually asked of Park Rangers around
the  country, proving once again that there is no known limit to the depths
of  human stupidity.  Excerpted from Outside Magazine, May 1995, pp.
120-121.

  Grand Canyon National Park
  -------------------------------------
  Was this man-made?
  Do you light it up at night?
  I bought tickets for the elevator to the bottom -- where is it?
  Is the mule train air conditioned?
  So where are the faces of the presidents?

  Everglades National Park
  -------------------------------
  Are the alligators real?
  Are the baby alligators for sale?
  Where are all the rides?
  What time does the two o'clock bus leave?

  Denali National Park (Alaska)
  ----------------------------------
  What time do you feed the bears?
  Can you show me where the yeti lives?
  How often do you mow the tundra?
  How much does Mount McKinley weigh?

  Mesa Verde National Park
  ---------------------------------
  Did people build this, or did Indians?
  Why did they build the ruins so close to the road?
  What did they worship in the kivas -- their own made-up religion?
  Do you know of any undiscovered ruins?
  Why did the Indians decide to live in Colorado?

  Carlsbad Caverns National Park
  ------------------------------------------
  How much of the cave is underground?
  So what's in the unexplored part of the cave?
  Does it ever rain in here?
  How many Ping-Pong balls would it take to fill this up?
  So what is this -- just a hole in the ground?

  Yosemite National Park
  -------------------------------
  Where are the cages for the animals?
  What time do you turn on Yosemite Falls?
  Can I get my picture taken with the carving of President Clinton?

  Yellowstone National Park
  ---------------------------------
  Does Old Faithful erupt at night?
  How do you turn it on?
  When does the guy who turns it on get to sleep?
  We had no trouble finding the park entrances, but where are the exits?
