Subject: discard? NEVER!

&gt;&gt;Remove the mounts from the new seats.  If all goes well you will discard these
&gt;&gt;along with your old seats.  Remove the rails and swivel from the old seats
&gt;(snip)

&gt;what &quot;discard&quot; your old seats, never, put em' in storage (see note below)

&gt;RULE NUMBER ONE

&gt;NEVER, NEVER throw any old bus stuff out. You'll never know when
&gt;you/somebody else will need this stuff. I like to of all Westfalia think
&gt;stuff as invalueable.The minute you throw something out, the next day you
&gt;find a need for it. All you have to do is find places to store all these
&gt;possesions. I have managed to fill up the basement, the driveway, and a
&gt;storage garage BTW.

OK.OK. I really didn't &quot;discard&quot; them.  That was just a figure of text.  
Just talk to my wife about the garage full of undiscarded stuff...

I actually gave the seats to a fellow grad student who had a bus almost 
identical to mine, but truly ratty seats.  He was from Chermany, and was 
delighted to see all the old VWs in the US.  Apparently most of them rusted 
away long ago back in the old country.

Don't worry - they went to good use.
