Subject:      Re: Middle Seat FS/weekender int FS

In a message dated 97-09-17 12:50:46 EDT, you write:

&lt;&lt; Is there a procedure to add a middle seat to a Westy ('90)? &gt;&gt;

you need the floor tracks, also..

by the way, if anyone's interested, i have a weekender interior from a '87 GL
 (grey velour) with the rear sofabed, the fold down middle seat, and the
captains chairs w/ the adjustable armrests, and all the
carpet/side/doorpanels.
also have 2 pairs of captains chairs in the blue velour..
