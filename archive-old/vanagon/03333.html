&gt;My 66 double cab and 67 camper had the headlight flasher feature.

So it seems that some do and others don't have that feature. Maybe the 66
and the 67 was altered later on (or did you buy them new this way?). But
wouldn't this be an easy fix, like just exchanging one of those relays
under the dash?
