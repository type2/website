&gt;This may be a stupid question but, How do I get to the back side of the
&gt;front nose panel of my 71 Bus to install the big &quot;VW&quot; emblem?
&gt;
Ya don't.  Well, at least not to do it stock.  (For security, you might want
to thread on nuts from inside but I haven't.)  The stock method is to obtain
four little cylindrical anchors that nobody has available (correct me on this
BusBoy Jim?) and push them into the holes in the sheetmetal from outside.
They have collars to keep them from going in all the way.  Then the four
prongs from the emblem push into the anchors.  It's a friction fit.  You
might find some at a junkyard.
