Okay, the verdict is in on my '89 Vanagon's exhaust problems. 

Parts -&gt;
   Front header replacement + gaskets + pipe + tip: $350
Labor -&gt;
   Installation + welding: $150

Should I go with this or someone else? It's severely rusted, running
around on expired tags, noisier than your average tuned out Harley,
and sitting in my FLVWD's repair lot.

(This dealer usually does good work for me, so I don't necessarily 
want to screw them... but if I'm gonna pay $500, I want to get the
best exhaust I can.)

I do not have a welder and I'm not good with pipes.
