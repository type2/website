Subject: other 87 questions

Forgot a couple of things that I was going to ask.

After searching my manual for the answers to theses questions, I turn to my
last line of defense (you all) for some answers.


1: Is there really supposed to be a bed in the '87 Vanagon GL? It says that
there is in the manual, and there is a small mattress in the back, but I
just don't see how anyone could be expected to actually sleep there. 

2: Exactly what is the purpose of having a rear passanger seat (3-person)
that can be propped-up? Is this supposed to be some kind of storage and
noting else?

3: Anyone ever have a problem with a scraping noise occurring when you turn
the steering wheel?

4: Even with all of the air controls and vents completely off, I still feel
a draft coming from my vent. Any way that I can remedy this?

Also forgot to tell you that MOKU was Christened this weekend: First road
trip, first speeding ticket. I was looking at the RPM's to see how much I
would lose going up a hill, neglecting to look at my speed (since I was
doing the speed limit when I first started up the hill, I figured I'd be OK). 

I was clocked _at_ 72 in a 60. THe trooper pulled me over and laughed because
he said that he'd never pulled a vanagon over before and never thought he
would. Guess I showed HIM!
