Hi all,

Just for fun, I scanned in three pictures of &quot;Red&quot;, my 1966 microbus project.
I have put them at the anonymous FTP site &quot;techie.phys.sfu_dot_ca&quot;.

The files are the following:

      red.first.gif       My first look at Red, been sittin there 14 years!
      red.trailer.gif     Loading Red on my friend's trailer for the ride home.
      red.home.gif        Red at home in my carport, thats &quot;Georg&quot; the 1973
			  Westy next to him and &quot;Rusty&quot; the 1980 shelty :-)

I also put them in my home WWW page, Red's page URL is:

     http://iraf.noao_dot_edu/iraf_staff/lytle/red.html

Yep, that box on the top of the bus is the air conditioner heat exchanger!
Colors are/will be Beige Grey on top, Titian Red on the sides.
Since these pictures were taken, I have stripped and repainted the wheels
and gotten new tires.  Brakes and an engine are next!

Cheers,
