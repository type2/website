Subject: Buying VW overseas?!?!

I have a brother-in-law in Switzerland wanting to pick up a military VW bus
or a VW bus to do some traveling in.  He is hoping to bring it home with him
when they return stateside in the winter.  I was hoping that all of these
wonderfully knowledgeable people on the list may have some suggestions that I
can send to him. 1) How to obtain one 2) Where to obtain one and 3) What to
know to be able to transport it back stateside?  Peace, love and
volkswagons....Christine
