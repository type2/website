&gt;Well, David Schwarze started it and I'm following into his footsteps. We
&gt;both have a set of 4 solar panels, each 1 by 4 ft. in size.  The set is
&gt;rated at 87 Watt. David has his already installed, while I'm struggling to
&gt;find time on a rainless day. 
&gt;   
&gt;   Very cool! Do you intend to add batteries to store collected energy
&gt;   or use the existing battery only?

Yes, Michael, that's the plan. The Camper is already set up for 2
batteries, where the 2nd is dedicated to run the fridge. The solar panels
are merely a second source of charging power. Eventually, I hope to afford
an inverter and run other things besides the fridge. -- Sami
