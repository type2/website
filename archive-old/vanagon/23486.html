&gt;&quot;Cal Look&quot;. Nipped that one in the bud...   ;-) ;-) ;-)

The workings of window tinting have to do with the filtering of certain types
of light.  If your windows are not tinted, have you noticed that on sunny days
during the winter the interior of your car can be quite warm? It is from the
infrared radiation produced by the sun, infrared = heat. In the army the
armored personal carriers had infrared lights on them, they produced no visible
light.  The way to determine if they were working was(and still is)to hold your
hand infront of the bulb. If your hand got warm, the light worked.  What the
tinting does, as does good sunglasses, is to filter down the amount of infrared
light, which produces heat, and filter out the ultraviolet light, which plays
havoc with your interior, and paint.  Of course air temp does play some part,
if it 100 degrees outside, it will be at least 100 degrees inside, with the
windows up, and no cooling mechanism employed(ie air conditioning).
Hope this answers your question somewhat
