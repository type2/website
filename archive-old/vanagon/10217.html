Subject: Q on converting bus to a camper
Date: Thu, 19 Jan 1995 10:44:08 -0500 (EST)

Hello all.  Any ideas on how hard it would be to convert a regular bus to a 
camper bus.  I want to convert my 69 to a camper.  I've found an old rusty 70 
westfalia for parts.  Is it possible, and economical to do this.  Any Ideas 
what a good price is to pay for the camper interior.  Another question would be
, if I remember right 71 was the year for some changes in mechanical aspect of 
the bus, so are 69 and 70 parts for the most part interchangeable, incase I 
have to buy a whole bus.
Thanks
Brad
