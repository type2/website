Subject: Continuing Engine Troubles

Well, with Dan Houg's and my Father's help, I've continued working on the
engine. To refresh your memories, I had replaced my engine with a used one
and it was running rich, so I solicited opinions.  None of which have
panned out.  

The weirdest thing that I see is that there is no voltage at the connected
Oxygen sensor connector.  Nothing.  If the sensor is disconnected, the OXS
behaves correctly -- giving readings up to .9 volts very quickly when rich
and dropping promptly to .2 when forced lean.  

The Fuel pressure is exactly correct, the temperature sensors send the
correct information.  All the pins at the ECU connector give the exact
proper response as detailed in Bentley.

Yet, the car runs rich continually.  I'm looking for more help here.  Any
advice is welcome. I'm really stuck.  I've even considered putting the old
engine back in.

HELP!
