Subject: Clocks

A while ago there was a thread on the clock that fits in the right hand hole 
of a Bay window dash. By all accounts these are not easy to get and I only 
ever saw one for sale at a swap meet with an extortionate price tag. But I 
saw plenty of cheap Type 3 clocks that look very similar (at least the dial 
looks similar) and thought I might be able to persuade one to fit the bus's 
dash. And it does, with a bit of modification, and unless you compared it to 
the real thing you'd swear it was stock. The clock only cost me 3 quid and 
matches the speedo and fuel guage perfectly. If anyone wants details of the 
butchery (to the clock, not the dash) needed to get it to fit, e-mail me 
directly. Its not a difficult job, just hard to describe.
