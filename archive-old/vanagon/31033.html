Subject: VW emblem

How can we put the big round VW emblem back on the front?

We found that by moving the inline fan closer to the middle(below 
the rear heater vents), the noise is cut down a little and there is a 
small incresase in the amount of heat that will reach the cabin.  The 
air won't come out quite as fast though.

Thanks for finding out which wire was for that low beam, now both of 
our headlights work!
