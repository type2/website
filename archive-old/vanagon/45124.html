Subject: Installing roof vent on Vanagon

Hi All,

I have a friend with '90 Vanagon. He's interested in installing an aluminum
vent into the roof of his van. The two of us have talked about doing it
ourselves, and had some thoughts about the following that hopefully others
have dealt with before.

1) When cutting through the metal, how do you deal with the headliner
underneath?

2) Has anyone had any experience with rain proofing the seal? Any tricks?

3) After cutting off the excess headliner, do you leave some overlap to
tuck under the vent frame?

4) What kind of tools have you used for cutting through the roof?

5) Did you start with pilot holes in the four corner locations of the vent,
and then just cut from hole to hole?

6) Is this better left to professionals rather than homebrew guzzling
weekenders?

BTW this Vanagon doesn't have air conditioning so there isn't any ducting
in the roof to worry about (I think).

Any and all comments welcomed.

Bren
