Subject: things I need...


Howdy all-
	Quick and to the point- Those of you in the PNW:

	If anyone has or knows the location of any of the following, I am 
very interested.
	1.  pair of doors, 78 (any w/ lock cyl. in handle will work, I think.
- NO Rust.  Mine are going from the inside out- btw, is there any fix for 
this? My body guy said no- just double checking.
	2.  pair of tail lenses- again 78, or applicable year. (73-79?)
	
	Sorry to post this to all, but my avenues of getting ahold of 
these items inexpensively didn't pan out.  Oh, yeah- cheap is good. Did I 
mention that?  ;-)

	Nothing about Chryslers here- just good ol' fashioned VW parts 
groveling...

	Jeff
