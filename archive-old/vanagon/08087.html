Subject: RE: vanagon cold oil warning system

Dave Kautz replied:
&gt;  The description you give here sounds more like a real problem to me than
  the cold/low oil pressure combination. I think you may have low oil pressure
  due to high oil temperature. The fact that it hasn't happened it the last
  five months suggests that it may occur more often in the summer, which
  wouldn't be a surprise. A co-worker of mine with an '87 Westfalia described
  a similar situation when he was towing a trailer with motorcycles on it.
  Also, we learned from the wear index that piston speed is higher on a Syncro
  than a 2wd Vanagon - a very likely result of that would be higher oil
  temperatures due to the increase in friction. 

For the friend with the '87, any solution to his problem.  I know awhile
back there was a thread on oil coolers.  At the time it didn't sound like
a project I wanted to get into!!  If there are two sensors for oil pressure,
which ones are telling us what?  Where does one attach an aftermarket oil
pressure gage?

Thanks
