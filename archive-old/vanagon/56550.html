If this is the case, then there is little, if any, difference between the
82 &amp; 85 fuel tank. My understanding is that the mis-design of the
Vanagon/Westy fuel tank was an afterthought. It appears to have been
designed such that water/mud collects on top of the tank (with no means of
flowing off) resulting in a very-shortened life due to premature
rust-through. The rust-through on my 82' resulted in gasoline soaking (via
splashing) the centerline air vent (cardboard). The fumes subsequyently
would fine there way into the cab. There were many a hot days when the
fumes were intolerable. Yes, I did get the tank replaced. With a new one
at that ... apparently the salvage yards had had a run on tanks a few
years back. I wonder why ?! I also understand that VoW may have had a
recall on their tanks as well (rumor!).

Point of my story is, I highly recommend that you drop your tank. Do the
tank inspection and replace all the fuel lines, whether they look like
they need it or not. Eleven years is a lot of weathering for the original
lines to bear.
