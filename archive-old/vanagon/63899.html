 found a 21/2 to 3 inch cardboard pipe which extends  about 5
 inches from the body but isn't connected to anything.  As I  cannot
 find anything nearby for it to hook up to  could it be a vent of  some
 sort to vent battery gas? What is its  purpose and can I plug it  or
 find out where it supossed to connect  to? Help me if you can. &gt;&gt;

   You're correct.  It's there to vent gas from the battery box.
 There's no other connection, it's just open to atmosphere.
 Prolly not a good Idea to plug it.

A lot of the heat you'll feel coming from the floor of the
driver/passenger compartment is conducted from the radiator.
I've had good luck with  3/8 thick insulation padding that I got
 from JC Witless and  placed under the carpeting,  with some
of the leftover material glued  underneath the van in the space
behind the radiator underneath  the spare tire.
