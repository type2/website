Subject: Fridge/Sink Mod

I have a 68 camper bus.  We just took it out for a 3-week vacation and it
functioned perfectly.  We ended up the whole thing at a dead show and saw
many many many buses there.  On the way there was a caravan of buses a mile
long, all going bus speeds...  dreamy.

Anyway, I saw a lot of the fridge/sink and gas stove modules there.  I have
since looked into getting one, but they seem pretty spendy.  Is there any way
around this??  I thought of building one my self... any advice?  where would
I look for parts... are they sold used anywhere?

Help me!!
