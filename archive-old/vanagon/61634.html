Ok, it's time to swallow my pride in having an all-original cockpit in
my '75 Westy.  After driving across the continent twice without
headrests, I now look like one of those buzzards in the Looney Tunes
cartoons -- remember, the ones with the snakey necks, big paunches, and
bad posture???.

Anyway, my question is:  Where do I get headrests for my '75 Westy?  I
have the holes in the top of the seats and everything, but the spacing
between them is rather wider than what you normally see around. Someone
once told me that Audi headrests had the right spacing, but talk about
color clash!  What I'd really like is to get a set of headrests that
would match the lovely orange plaid on the seats (and in the rest of the
van).  Anyone have any suggestions?
