Subject:      Tailgate Awnings from Bonny Scotland

Hi,

I've just seen a report of a firm making tent/awnings that fit at the back
of a car, van, 4x4, camper etc.

The firm is Caranex. Their address is:

Caranex Ltd,
Cuan Ferry
Isle of Seil
By Oban
Argyll
Scotland
PA34 4RB   Tel 01852 300 258   (44 1852 etc from outside UK)

They have a simple colour scheme, Light/Dark Brown, Light/Dark Brown or
..., well I'll let you guess. Price range is 250 to 280 UK pounds.

Now the slopey shoulders bit - I have no other knowledge of, or connection
with, this outfit. I don't know if they export or send brochures overseas.
If you mention my name when you contact them you probably won't get any
discount and they won't know who the hell I am...

(But if you do contact them please mention the British Camping and
Caravanning Club, the source of this snippet).

Another pissibolity, this time for a _side_ awning, is:

Autocamp,
Johns Cross Motor Caravan &amp; Camping Centre,
Battle Road,
Robertsbridge,
East Sussex  UK,
TN32 5JJ
Tel 01580 881288

They have one model, price 280 UKP basic, 80 for inner tent, 115 more for
groundsheet. (Same info source)
