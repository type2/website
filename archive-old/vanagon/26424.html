Hey there Ric!

Is this the report produced by historian Hans Mommsen?  I read an article
in _History Today_ entitled &quot;Beetles in Brown Shirts?&quot; (November 92, volume
42, for those of you who want to check it out.  Good article) about it.
Seems that even though he's a respected guy, VWAG spent a couple million DM
and all he produced was a slim report.  Not only that, but it white-washed
(ooh, bad pun) VW's early years during the war.

Actually, it doesn't sound like the same report, but I'd been meaning to
write the list about the article anyhow, you just reminded me about it :-)

Cheers!
Bill

&gt; I just received a package from the VW Museum.....in it was a 60pg
&gt; book entitled: &quot;An idea that made history - The story of
&gt; Volkswagen.&quot;
&gt; Its a year by year history of VW from 1934 to the present. Lots of
&gt; photos and neat graphs showing the production numbers of bugs,
&gt; busses,
&gt; and even golfs to date...
&gt;
&gt; The book is published by VW AG and is available
&gt; from:
&gt;
&gt; Volkswagen AG
&gt; Public Relations
&gt; P.O. Box
&gt; 3180 Wolfsburg
&gt; Germany
