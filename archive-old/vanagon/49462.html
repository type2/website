Subject: 25 cent manual


At the local library they have a book sale table and people can leave 
their books and the library sells them to support themselves. I gave a 
glance at the table and there was a Type one bently book from the 
seventies in good condition. Colored wiring diagrams and everything. I 
payed 25 cents, don't have a bug but I thought it would be a great 
investment. By the way if anyone has a bay window bently with colored 
foldout diagrams that they would like to sell please let me know, Thanks.
