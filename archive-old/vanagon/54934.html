&gt; Hello Folks! My saga continues with a myriad of little misfires and no

&gt; expensive. But never the less a intermittent problem exist.
&gt; List of replaced parts
&gt; 1) coil
&gt; 2) air flowmeter
&gt; 3) cylindar head temp sensor
&gt; 4) thermo time switch
&gt; 5) dual relay
&gt; 6) cap, rotor, wires
&gt; 7) fuel pump-it was making lots of gurgitating sounds
&gt; 8) ecu module (Halls control module)
&gt; 9) key starter switch on steering column

I remember you!  (I'm interested in all those good old parts you must be 
pilling up!)

The intermittent misses can be tough, but I recall you also had no-starts.
Did you determine whether the no-start was caused by lack of fuel or lack
of spark?  How's the idle?  High?  Low?  

There's not much to replace.  You don't mention fuel filter in the 
above.  I understand that a clogged filter might possibly cause these 
symptoms; junk clogs up the filter causing the engine to fail.  After 
sitting a spell the junk settles off the element of the filter allowing 
fuel to flow until the filter clogs again.
