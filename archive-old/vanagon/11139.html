Subject: Re: CV joints in an '85 Vanagon


My wee trick in re-installing the cv joint/driveshaft at the axle is to
jack the van up enough so the wheel is just clear of the floor. Block and
support van well, ie: good stands. I rest the outboard end in the trailing
arm and then attach the inboard end with a couple of bolts. The hardest
part is getting the first couple of bolts in the outboard end, but with
the wheel above the ground, you can spin it so that you can get your 12/6
pt onto the bolt and the bolt into the hole. Jamming your knee or thigh
against the wheel will allow you to tighten the bolts securely.

If you feel queesy (sic) about jamming your thigh against the wheel to
tighten the bolts, you can haul yourself out from under the van and put on
the handbrake, get back under, tighten bolt, get back up and undo brake,
get back under and rotate wheel so next bolt is accessible, get back out
and tighten brake...
