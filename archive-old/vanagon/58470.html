Subject: 85 van

I'm just about to replace those long steel coolant pipes between my engine
and radiator, and am looking for advice.  I'm also looking for a place to
get a good repair manual on the thing at a price I can afford without a
home-equity loan.  Any ideas?  I would appreciate it.

Thanks,
Luke
