Subject: RE: Bolt Broke in Head! AARGGHRRGH !!!

If you have access to a drill-press, you could try drilling with left-handed
drill bits, so drilling force tends to bring the stud out.  Good machine shop
could do both jobs; in fact they'll have a technology that can torch out the
steel stud without affecting the aluminum head.  Visit some machine shops, 
see who gives you a trustworthy feeling.
Good luck!
