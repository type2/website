&lt;&lt; I drive a 1986 Syncro Westfalia, use 91 to 93 octane gasoline, drive 100
 km/hr = 63 mph.
 My consumption is 14.5 litres/100km = 19 mi/imp gal = 16 mi/US gal.
 
 According to a report from S.Africa, 14.5 l/100km is normal at 100
 km/hr. Any other Syncro drivers have better/worse results?

I generally get a bit better mileage from my 87 Syncro.  In 1991 (with around
50,000 miles on the van) I was getting around 18.5 miles/US gal.  Over the
years my MPG has decreased gradually and now my overall mileage (cumulative
since 1991) is now down to 17.5 miles/US gal.  The van now has about 148,000
miles on it.  The last 30 tanks have averaged about 16.4 miles/US gallon.
