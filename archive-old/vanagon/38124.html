Subject: misc EV topics

Too many EV topics on today's digest. So I'll just lump everything together.

Van with louvered windows: was it white? did it have windows on the
passenger side? and that big top? if so, it's probably a 'bago.

EV Westfalia - (full camper version) all the manuals/fiche I've seen call
this the EuroVan CV. So if you see that logo on one, you'll know its a
Westie.

cramped inside: actually the thing has me room inside than the Vanagon does.
That extra 15 inches they added to the length, plus the rear seat slides back.
windows are all tinted but since there are the windows on the passenger
side its not that bad in the back.

extra seat: actually the extra seat fits well, and has a back that folds
down to ease getting in/out of the rear seat. With the extra seat, I could
easily haul 7 people, assuming they're not too wide!

re all those bad things that happened to Tomaselli's van: so far, no one
else has had the same kinds of electrical problems he has. However his
advice is sound: this is a complex vehicle made by two companies - it would
be worthwhile to make sure that everything functions before you take it off
the lot. The dealer should then write you up a list of items that need to
be repaired, if any.

enough for now
