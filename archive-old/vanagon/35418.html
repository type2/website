Subject: Kill switch/ignition idea

&gt;
&gt;  Will this work?
&gt;&gt;
  I have this idea that I thought I'd shoot past you.
&gt; What if I were to connect the coil wire from the ignition switch to the
&gt; hot wire that leads from the fuse box up to the kill switch?  That way
&gt; the key would work normally but I could flip the switch to prevent someone
&gt; from starting the van.
&gt;

&gt;                fuse box(hot)-------------------------|
&gt;                      |                  |
&gt;                      |                  |
&gt;                      |                  |
&gt;                      hot                coil
&gt;                     (big red)           wire        
&gt;                      |                  | 
&gt;                      .......................
&gt;                      . ignition switch     .......starter............
&gt;                      .                     .......head lights........
&gt;                      ..............................dome lights........
&gt;
&gt; Would this work? or would I end up frying everything again?
