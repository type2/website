In my garage I don't have 'pipes', I have 'mechanical advantage'. I am often 
heard to say to my son (and No 1 helper) &quot;let's get some mechanical 
advantage&quot;. I think he's amazed that what he learnt, or didn't learn, in 
school actually has some practical use.

My 45 kilo wife and my 85 kilo self undid the gland nut on my engine with 
the help of an 8'x 2&quot; pipe on a 36mm socket and a 4' sash cramp on the 
flywheel (as per St Muir). She was amazed.

My son was amazed when we undid the nuts on the lower end of the front 
struts of his little Japanese car with an length of 8' x 1&quot; water pipe 
after he had struggled with them for about an hour before I got home from 
work.
