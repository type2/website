Subject: RE: Temperature Related Performance Problems



&gt;The second problem has developed over the past few years.  On warm (55-65 
F)
&gt;AND damp days the engine stalls at cold idle.  You can keep it running with
&gt;a foot on the accelerator until it warms up...then it runs OK...but again
&gt;it's annoying.  (Dealer said I should just warm it up in my driveway on 
such
&gt;days before leaving). This problem does not occur on dry days, or hot and
&gt;damp days for that matter.

I had this happen on an old '70 squareback. I replaced the spark
plug wires, and it lived happily ever after. They were old and oil-
soaked (I guess), which tends to make them leak charge through the
insulation. This has more of an effect on damp days, but once the
engine warms up (which lowers the humidity percentage in the engine
compartment), it was fine.

Any chance your engine could be having the same problem?

On a damp day, pull the center wire from the distributor, hold it 1/4&quot;
from metal (wrap it in thick rubber, or you might get bit), and have a
friend crank the engine over. You should get a bright blue-white spark.
If the spark is like orange or yellow, then your ignition isn't doing
its full job.  Might be wires, or coil, or condenser.
