Hey all.
Once, again it's the Washington Post Classifieds.  FYI, I go through the
classifieds searching for VW vans of any type.  I post those.  Then I go
through and post any other air-cooled VWs that are listed for sale.  I
skip all the water-cooled VWs because there are a LOT listed and because
most of us are only concerned with the REAL VWs ;) (no flames please,
I've got better things to do).

'91 Vanagon GL, 1 owner, excellent condition, fully equipped, new tires,
4-speed, reduced to $9450, 703-620-2449.

'84 Vanagon, like new, front and rear a/c, 2-tone, MD inspection, $3400
or best offer, 301-948-4745.
