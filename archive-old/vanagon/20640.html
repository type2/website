&gt; When I was wrestling with the bumper this weekend I found a lot 
&gt; of rust on the battery tray on my '71 bus.  It has big holes all the 
&gt; way through it.

I had this problem too, and when I had the engine out for a rebuild
(1991) I sanded down the area, brushed on some of that rust fixer you
mentioned, and then applied a couple of layers of fiberglass (resin +
cloth) over the whole area.  This sealed the area real well, and four
years later the rust hasn't come back.  Oh, I did have to drill a small
hole in the center of the tray, to keep water from accumulating there in
wet weather.
