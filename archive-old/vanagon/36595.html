&gt; Volkswagen of America announced today that it will reintroduce
&gt; the classic VW bus to America.

...snip...
&gt; The prototype Concept II Microbus was built by a special VW engineering
&gt; team, and then sent to Sweden for testing. It recent arrived in the United
&gt; States, and will begin a tour of the US autoshows shortly after some
&gt; shipping damage is repaired. A photograph of the new Concept II is
&gt; available for viewing at: http://www_dot_calweb_dot_com/~thom/54dlx5.jpg

Shipping damage????!!!!  Man, that sucker looks like they &quot;transported&quot; it
in the bilge! ... and came to the east coast via the Pacific route!
