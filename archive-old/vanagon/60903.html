Subject: HELP  clutch master cylinder R&amp;R and water pump R&amp;R

Sorry for the cry for help, but I'm suppose to be on the road tomorrow, and I need
to fix these problems before I leave.  The archives seem to be down and I have
never performed these tasks before.  Guess I'll be up the bestt part of tonight.
Any help from my fellow listies would be a great gift.
Clutch Master Cylinder - Well I found the problem with my difficulties shifting
into 1st gear,..I think.  My clutch master cyclinder is leaking and I have a
replacement.  Soooo gooood, sooo faaaaar. Now Bently's picture is a little vague
here, and I have never done one of these before.  Mostly I'm having problems with 
how to access the &quot;clevis&quot; pin.  It seems to attach behind the sheet metal, what's
the trick????? The rest seems to be straight forward, but if you've done this, any
light is more than I have right now&gt;
Water pump- This looks like fun.  Not!!!!!!! Again any help and/or procedures 
would be very very welcomed.  I have never replaced one of these, and this Bently
well, some of the pictures are nice, and some are...well I'm sure you know.
I'll be checking this computer through out the day and eve, again thanks, in
advance for any and all help.
