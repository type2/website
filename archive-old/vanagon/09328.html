&gt;Did anyone see &quot;Cops&quot; (last night for me), with the guy who got taken out

&gt;Nice looking Ride, I wonder where the police auctions are?

i thought they said that the real owner had gone into a 7-11-type place and
left it running outside, then the perp (cop-slang for Perpetrator! :) had
driven it off.  it was a blue camper, from the door panel it looked to be
a later model bus (like 76-79 or so). didn't make much sense why he already
had all that drug stuff if he'd just stolen it, though. (i don't really watch
closely ... that show is just sort of background 'filler' for me. ;)

and it's probably already gone. :(  they had to have filmed that several
months ago, don't you think?
