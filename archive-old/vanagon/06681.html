&gt; The following is a press-release, from the staff at Bryce Hospital for the
&gt; Mentally Confused, and the staff at Charles L. Seebeck Computer Center for
&gt; the University of Alabama:
&gt; 
&gt; Mr. Joel Walker was admitted this afternoon, after being cornered in a pecan
&gt; tree, just back of the Math, Psychology, and Computer Center Building on the
&gt; campus of the University of Alabama.  He was knocked out of the tree by a
&gt; tranquilizer dart, but was semi-conscious as they wrapped him in the
&gt; protective straight-jacket.  He was muttering about &quot;ass-key&quot;, which was
&gt; unintelligible to most of the attendants.  The on-site diagnosis was some
&gt; sort of psycho-sexual reversion-repressive neurosis, possibly bordering on
&gt; schizophrenia, with complications of delusions of grandeur.
&gt; 
&gt; His position will be filled as quickly as possible, in order to preserve the
&gt; stabilization of the budgetary outflux and local economy during the upcoming
&gt; holiday season. He will, in all liklihood, be hardly missed.
&gt; 
  

  Perhaps he was really muttering about &quot;ass-ski&quot;. What he really needed was
  a winter vacation.....
