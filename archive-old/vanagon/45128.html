&gt; For me, means coming cold turkey off my vanagon_at_lenti habit. For everyone
&gt; else, it means blessed relief from one of the bigger mouths on the list.
&gt; But I'll be back. Thanks to all of you who put up with my long-play
&gt; spiels-- I hope they did more good than harm overall. And a BIG thank
&gt; you to those who helped me with myriads of VW problems.

See ya Steve!  Thanks for all your help over the past months.  And as 
always I hope to see a status report on the V6anagon in the future.  
Good luck with those clutches, etc!

What will the list do now that we don't have your monster .SIG's to 
mock?  &lt;GRIN!&gt;

Best Wishes,

 


- Mike White
