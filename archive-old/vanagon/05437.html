Subject: Re: Aux. heater questions.


I think I may have been temporarily relocated to Mars when
I responded to this post yesterday.  It had been a long day
and several things were whizzing thru my head &amp; I managed to
get 2 separate heater problems I've had twisted into one
improbable answer.  I suppose what I wrote _could_ happen,
but the engine exhaust is what I was really thinking of.
Geez.  Maybe I shouldn't have had that lobotomy after all.
Seemed like a good idea at the time.

Just to make today more phun, our Vax system was down for
most of the day so I couldn't make amends early on.  

Now.  Another important question.  Should I buy a 65 Camp-
mobile in fairly good shape for $500?  The interior stuff
has all been removed so the guy could haul motorcycles with
it (!) but it's been stored in his basement.  Body's not
bad (rockers rusty, but all else OK).  Starter turns real
slowly, 'tho the battery's up.  Runs well, steers fair.

Should I or shouldn't I?  Aren't 2 Busses enough?  Am
I crossing some line?
