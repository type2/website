Subject: Re: Starter


     Tom said (in part):
     
          The starter on my '81 has a seperate solenoid. 
     
     Not to pick a nit, but I'm gonna assume that &quot;separate&quot; means that you 
     have to buy two distinct parts which do not have a mechanical 
     connection to have a complete starter replacement.  Or, was the 
     &quot;other&quot; piece likely a &quot;post-manufacture&quot; Ford-type solenoid installed 
     and used as a starter relay to reduce the distance the electricity had 
     to travel to get from the battery to the starter (an old &quot;fix&quot; that 
     dates back to 36hp days)?
     
     Apologies for possibly being obtuse, but what the average VW nut 
     usually calls a &quot;solenoid&quot; is the lesser of the two cylindrical 
     objects which make up a complete starter assembly.
     
     'Course, I'm willing to admit (without being browbeat) that your '81 
     may indeed have some configuration that I have not seen.  I'm old, but 
     I haven't experienced everything (yet)!
