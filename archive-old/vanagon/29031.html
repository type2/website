&gt;The interesting part is that the flashing indicator went away each time

&gt;intermittent sender signal gets &quot;latched&quot;?  Also, this problem seems to
&gt;have disappeared now that I'm back down at sea level from 3000' to 7000'
&gt;where it was happening.

Yes, it does get latched.  Once the level drops below the sensor (if only for
a moment like while going around a corner) the light gets latched on and is
reset only upon turning off the van and turning it back on with high enough
coolant level.
