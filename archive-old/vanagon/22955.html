Subject: '65-67 Westy flooring [Q]

Markus Benne at (mbenne_at_Newbridge.COM) and I are in need of a definitive
answer from a the list regarding the size and coverage of the plywood
flooring that is installed in the '65-76 Westfalias. It's understood that it
spans the width of the bus with allowances for the aluminum edging strip on
the outside passsanger side. The question is: What is the length of the
piece? Does it go under the forward facing bed/bench or only up to it? I
think it runs the length of the bus from directly behind the front seats and
up to the forward edge of the bed/bench. Can anyone confirm this as fact?
Thanks from both of us.
