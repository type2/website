I like to spray everything that may rust in storage with white 
lithium spray grease.  Just make sure it is all removed before using 
the parts.

&gt; 
&gt; I just stripped out a new front brake system from a 71.  I also got the 
&gt; rear drums and shoes.  Does anyone have any suggestions as to how to 
&gt; store these things.  I'd hate to go use them later and find them too 
&gt; rusty or the rotors stuck.
