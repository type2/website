Subject: Re: Syncro transaxle hard shifting 

In a message dated 96-10-01 12:58:03 EDT, you write:

&lt;&lt; Someone had been into the
 trans before and installed brass syncro rings instead of the required steeel
 ones. They had also downsized the pinion bearing.  &gt;&gt;

Todd, how did you get steel syncros?I have o/hauled many vw vanagon boxes and
the syncros are all brass.There is a difference in german vs. brazilian
construction, but all are brass...porsche uses a stell syncro, but it is a
split design unlike the vanagon solid  &quot;baulk rings&quot;.Also how did they get a
different pinion bearing to work...I've found that the orig. fag bearing is
the only spec bearing that will work on these(094) boxes.I have replaced at
least 12 of them and cannot see a way to use another brand let alone design.I
think the shop may have spun a tale to you...But i'm sure you needed both.BTW
a hard entry into a second gear when cold is absolutely indicative of a
failing syncro ring.Also, as a caution to all....pay the extra scratch for
the oem german syncros...they last...even used ones are better thatn the new
brazilian ones, or aftermarket...take it from the horses mouth.....Mr. Ed.
 Adios
