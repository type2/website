Subject: Re: da trip..../CB radio

Talking about CB radios, does any one know if one uses crytals is better than
those use synthesizers? I got a pair of Radio Shack CBs that require crytals.
I have got only 2 channels of crystals installed. They allow up to 5 channels 
total. Those use synthesizers can have 40 channels. Seems a great advantage.

But which type is better in terms of distance (sensitivity) and chanel
separation? Mine are actually walky-talky CBs. They were used only a few
times since I bought them new 10 years ago. Since I have only 2 channels 
installed and they are not adjacent channels the crosstalk between the 
two channels is nonexistent.

In addition to CBs, make sure you carry additional alternator/water pump
belts during the da trip.... It always breaks at the time when engine overheats.
