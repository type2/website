Subject: Last Call, '78 Bus Parts

The '78 parts bus that I got two weeks ago is going to the crusher 
next Monday or Tuesday. I'm actually sending it away with many good 
parts still on it, because I'm running out of storage room.  If 
anyone needs anything, I'd part with it very reasonably rather than 
give it to the junkyard.  Even more reasonably if you come &amp; pull 
it.  
(Between Phila &amp; Allentown, Pa.).

Still available...
	Gas tank
	Doors (except sliding door)
	Seats (one front seat, middle and rear seats - brown)
	Dash &amp; related components
	All brake/wheel components
	All Glass
	Bumpers
	Transaxle
	Wheels w/almost new tires
	etc. etc. etc.

Also, I still haven't had any takers on that automatic '76 Deluxe 
Westfalia in almost mint cond. for $4500 (76,000 orig. miles).  Got 
a few calls, but not from anyone close by.  It's going in the paper 
tomorrow.  Someone should have this bus who appreciates it!
