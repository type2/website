Subject: Torque Heads after new Heads???

I did the deal with the devil (local VW Dealer) and had my heads
replaced recently. They paid for 2 new heads etc. I paid labor $600.00
They even threw in one of those  $100 wiring harnesses to cover the
weird cut out and misfire problem when first starting.. When I went to
pick it up I asked if I neeeded to have the heads retorqued after a few
thosand miles.  they said &quot; Nope , never heard of that.  Same Dealer had
done the recall re torque.  So does any one know if I need to have these
puppies re torqued or not and if I do. Is it difficult.
