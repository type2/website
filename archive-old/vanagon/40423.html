&gt;I mean, you can't really swing a dead cat without smacking one of those 501
&gt;cid Cadillac engines in a junkyard, and if you scrounged you could come up
&gt;with an old Cad V16.
&gt;
&gt;If we're going to get rotten mileage, Steve, then let's do it up RIGHT! ;)


Thanks for volunteering, Ken!

When do you think you'll have it ready? Can't wait to see it-- one
touch on the gas and the front wheels will be waving in the breeze.
Remember the red flag to hang on the rear pulley-- DMV requirement
for anything that sticks out more than 24&quot; past the rearmost part of
the bus body.

Nope, the V6anagon has plenty enough power for me, as I've said a few
times in the past (actually a lot of times). I only wish the whole
drivetrain were reliable (are you listening, clutch?).

BTW, I've gotten more incredulous response for that little tagline at
the end of the post about Chev 2.8L vibrations, than for the entire rest of 
the post. Keep those cards and letters coming, sports fans...
;)
