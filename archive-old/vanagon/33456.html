&gt; As if my stuck solenoid on the '79 Bus wasn't bad enough, this morning as I

&gt; semaphores ($200) once rested with pride.  Oh, how they loved to pop out at
&gt; the flick of a switch, announcing to the world my turns. . .and turning all
&gt; SuperBeetle drivers green with envy.  But no more.

&gt; P.S. Last month, someone stole the fuel cap off of my '79 Bus, so even
&gt; late-model Buses aren't immune.  (The #$_at_%! fuel cap?)
&gt; P.P.S.  Any suggestions as to how to protect semaphores from theft? Locking
&gt; devices, inscribed numbers, etc.?  Remember, old Buses got 'em too, I think.
&gt; Assuming I ever FIND replacements. . .

I came home once to find some Neanderf--- had taken the taillight lenses
off my 60 Singlecab while I was at work (daytime on a busy street!!).  This
after I had just bought them at a SOTO meet.  This was before any of the
repros were available, too!

When I put the new ones on, I soldered the phillips heads on the screws
flush, so you'd have to melt them clean to get the lenses off without
breaking them.  You might try this on your *next* set of  semaphores
(bummer, lenses were about 40 bucks, a lot less painful).  I wouldn't try
that on the gas cap, though. 8')
