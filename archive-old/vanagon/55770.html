&gt; Greetings All -
&gt; 
&gt; In a general (and negative response) to Dan Flemings request for a wheel
&gt; cover, I'd like to add that I need one for my 1980 as well.  Lost this
&gt; one on the road to Telegraph Creek, BC, last summer.  It's the one with
&gt; the little castle in the middle...rare, I'm told.
&gt; 
&gt; Regards,

In Toronto (actually Scarborough, a municipality of Toronto) there is a
shop with nothing but Hub Caps and Wheel Covers. You would have to see
it to believe it. I recently bought two Vanagon wheel covers (he takes
trade ins of any vehicle) at quite a reasonable price. It helps if you
speak Greek.
