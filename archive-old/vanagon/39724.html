Subject: P &amp; C's Replace or hone?

Engine rebuild saga part III, proverbial can of worms has been opened...OK,
heads are off (1978 2L), FINALLY removed the exhaust headers so I could
return the heads to Mark Stephens for my core deposit. A couple of the
cylinders have some scratches that you can definitely feel with your
fingernail. I want to remove the Pistons and cylinders anyways because
they're so filthy, but can these be re-honed? Or do I need to go with new?

If I do need to go with new any suggestions? The local VW shop out here in
the SF Bay Area quoted 365$ for German replacements, 320 for Brazlian. Are
those good prices? Any other suggestions for sources? At least this would
keep me from having to clean the old ones! Man this engine is fillllllthy!
Thanks to Bob (veeduber) for great cleaning suggestions, bought 2 roasting
pans today! Any and all suggestions once again very much appreciated!   Tom
