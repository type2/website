Subject: RE: 1988 Syncros?

This is true because I read it in one of my 1988 buyer's guides.  They only
sold left over '87 Syncros in 1988.
 
&gt;&gt;I am curious to find out if anyone has a definitive answer as to whether or
&gt;&gt;not VW sold Vanagon Syncros in the United States for model year 1988.
&gt;
&gt;While I was searching for a Syncro I found out from an owner of an '87
&gt;Syncro that VW did not import any Syncros in the United States.  He said
&gt;he had wanted to buy an '88 when they were new but the dealerships only
&gt;had '87 Syncros.  The dealers told him VW could not get enough Syncro
&gt;specific components to produce enough '88 Syncros to cover all markets
&gt;so they elected not to bring any into the U.S.  I think he said it was the
&gt;shortage of the viscous coupler being made by one of VW's vendors.
&gt;
&gt;This '87 Syncro owner ended up buying a new '87 Syncro from a Minneapolis
&gt;dealer after being told '88's would not be available.  Either this is true
or the
&gt;dealerships were trying to fill people with a line to get them to buy the
'87 Syncros
&gt;they still had on their lots.
