All,

BAS sez:

	The filtercase is of poor quality according to them,
it has 8mm oilgalleys (with hydraulic lifters ?!), only one
oilpressure relief valve and suffered sealing problems at the
case parting line, those would be the main reasons why VW
discontinued it after a short period of production ('79&gt;'82,
enginecode CT).

Anyway, maybe i hear more about it tomorrow, i'll let you
know if it's something worth mentioning.

Brian.
