Subject: Re: baja trip - dates? 

To All:

For those willing to consider a real taste of Baja instead of the usual
tourist-thronged beaches,  the Melling Ranch (about four hours south of the
line) offers a glimpse of things seldom seen.  (Looking out across the river
one morning at breakfast we watched a cougar unsuccessfully stalk a new colt
in the paddock near the air strip.)  It's a working cattle ranch that has
accomodations for a few guests, usually catering to visitors to the
observatory atop Mt. Diablo (yes, it snows in Baja, too.)  They used to
advertise in 'Sunset' magazine.  I haven't been there in years, don't know if
they're still looking for guests.

-Bob

   I read something about the ranch, how steep is the hill to/from
   this place?
