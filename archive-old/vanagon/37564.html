So 2 Amys and a Bren says:
&gt; Listers:
&gt; 
&gt; Having lurked about on this list for some time and never posted, I 
&gt; now feel I must let my true feelings out.  I love you guys, man!  
&gt; Thanks to all of your expostulations, I have been soaking up 
&gt; information like a sponge.  I wish to thank Bob Hoover in particular: 
&gt; I will be your disciple!
&gt; 

No Bren! Your not getting my last beer!  ;p
