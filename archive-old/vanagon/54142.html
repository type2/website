Subject: Vanagon Model Summaries on WWW???

Hi all,
I've written several (86 to 91) Vanagon Model Summaries (I named the last one
Vanagon Models, 1991 - USA though) and have sent them to the Vanagon List.  A
while back I saw a few of them that someone had included in a WWW site.  I've
recently attempted to find that site, but have been unsuccessful.

Does anyone know where these are located??

Thanks,
Jim Davis
