Subject:  2l air-cooled engine fs, how much?

the decision has been made to rebuild my motor w/ mark stephens' rebuilt
heads rather than install my brother's.  i am in michigan, the motor is in los
angeles, and my brother now has a waterboxer.  the engine should go to
a happy home in a bus rather than sitting (we have no place to store it). 
here's the basic info:

2l air-cooled engine, complete w/ fi stuff 
rebuilt less than 30,000 miles ago (new pistons/cylinders/bearings)
been out of vehicle (82) for about two months now, ran well then
exhaust still attached
missing driver's side rear tin (sorry, i needed it)

i'm wondering what everyone's idea of a fair price is.

thanks, matthew (81 adventurewagen)
