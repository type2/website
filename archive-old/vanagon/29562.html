Subject: new buyer need advise

I am a rookie and I have been lurking for about a month, learning about 
the vanagon campers in order to decide (1) if it is for my family of four 
and (2) what to look for when shopping for one.   Now I would like to ask 
some advise from the group.

Prior to today I have seen 2  Waserbox Westies in area (1) '87 GL Camper 
with 74k miles in amazing shape at $10,000 and an 87 GL Camper with 34k 
miles at $12,000.  Neither has been sold but those were the only prices 
the owners were willing to part at.   I have been thinking that the 2.1 
engine, 1986+ Westies would be a great vehicle and (because I need heat 
up here in Valley Forge) I have avoided the air-cooled campers.

Today I saw a 1985 Westfalia GL with 38,000 original  miles on it for 
$8,600 outside Philadelphia at a VW dealer.  It has a four speed manual, 
AC/PB.  Body was clean of rust and no dings/dents, although the engine 
showed some rust, but it ran great.  Is this a good price? Market is high 
here and I might not see a GL this clean, at this mileage, below $8,000 
for some time. 

Dealer  can offer 12 month/12k mile service contract from Fireman's Fund 
(included in above price) , has anyone had any experience with it?  I 
tied for a GE contract but it was not available.  Anyone have anything to 
recommend to me about these &quot;extended mechanical protection&quot; contracts?  
Standard coverage was 1 month, 1K miles at the dealer; but the dealer is 
60 miles away.

How about the dealer prep of this camper?  Is there anything I should 
insist on as part of their prep work? Oil, filter, trans, coolants, brake 
flush?  What may be  about to wear out on this guy (heads, exhaust,CV)?  
Any help here would be appreciated because this is a budget buster.  That 
is why the low mileage and  the VW dealer warranty have me thinking Buy, 
You may never see it again.

Gotta get back to them Monday morning, so time is of the essence.  Please 
email to me unless you think it should be on the list.  Thanks again for 
all the information  shared so far and I hope to join the east coast trip 
next summer.  


peace,
