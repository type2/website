&gt;Rusty says no way man, I just leave the oilcooler seals out of the engines
that I drive and fling oil all over them. It really torques them off when I
lock up my motors when they are tailgating. I just laugh when I hear that
good ol' rod knock starting to happen. I tell the passanger that's with me,
&quot;Watch this!&quot; =)
Brrrrrta, Brrrrrta, Brrrrrta, Brrrrrta, Lunch! Hee hee hee. That really gets
em every time! That and throwing cigarette butts out of the window if there
is a convertible on my butt. This works especially good in California during
the fire season! ;)
