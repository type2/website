Subject:      temp sensor (II)

I just got back from thinking about replacing my blue temp sensor in my
84 (temp sensor II in bentley i believe).

My limited understanding is that this read the coolant temperature.
If this is correct, do I need to worry about losing coolant when i
remove the old sensor?

If so, what do i do, if not i'll have at it.

Oh yeah, do I need an o ring for the new one?  It didn't come with one
but I would think it needs one.

Thanks, as usual, in advance
