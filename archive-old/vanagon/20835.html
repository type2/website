&gt; The manual sez the 76 westy is 6' 8&quot; in height, and mine is pretty darn

&gt; about 1/16th of an inch clearance.  (Love to freak out my landlord by 
&gt; barrelling into the garage full tilt and watch his face as the daylight

There is a garage in downtown San Jose (San Pedro Sq. for you yokels...) that is
an incredibly tight fit for my '82 Westy. If you look at the van from the side, 
the antenna looks to be about the same hight as the roof, but in the garage the 
antenna hits the ceiling beams. I'll bet if you drive fast over the bumps you 
could crack your fiberglass shell.
