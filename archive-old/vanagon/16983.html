Subject:       1990/91 Injector Recall (Canada)

I also had this recall performed (campain RV) while my a/c was 
getting rebuilt, &amp; charging system checked/battery installed... pretty busy 
guy, huh?? :)

New injectors, fuel lines, injector fuel rails were installed.  This 
cost VW $680 CDN for the parts, and a token $64 for the dealer to 
install.  Must admit that it was nice of VW to change them for me, 
but there goes more corporate profits out the door.

Anyway, between my new battery, Bosch Platinum plugs I put in 3 weeks 
or so go, and the injectors changed... this baby starts right up big 
time.  In the 5 years I have owned my Syncro Westy, it has always had 
to crank 3 or 4 times before firing.  I thought this was normal.  
Well, the Platinums helped for sure, but they can't take the full 
credit as it starts very quickly and strongly on the first tick over.

Very pleased, impressed, and happy with my van.  

Harry.
