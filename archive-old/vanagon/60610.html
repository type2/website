Subject: RE: 91 Vanagon Auto Trans Repair Part 1

None of these parts explains why the transmission did not work.  I do suggest 
you go to a local Trans shop and get the master overhaul kit.  It will contain 
all the friction linings and seals including those for the final drive.  I 
would also replace the second gear brake band and all the piston cups.  The 
steel plates for the direct and reverse should be checked carefully.  Do not 
mix up the friction linings for these, they are a slightly different thickness 
and not interchangeable.  Also, consider getting a rebuilt torque converter 
from the Trans shop.  You do not want all the junk in it getting into the 
newly rebuilt box.  Above all, you must find the cause of failure so you do 
not have to do it twice.  Also, when pressing in the two seals that separate 
the Trans and diff oils, make sure there is a space between them.  This is 
needed so that any fluid that gets past a seal can drain out through that hole 
in the bottom.  Otherwise, the two fluids will mix and mess up the works.

Good Luck,
Dennis

I started out Saturday evening jacking the Carat as high as possible and 
removing the axle 
shafts.
Sunday morning was spent removing the various linkages and bolts and dropping 
the transmission 
and differential. It went very smoothly. I built a transmission holder out of 
a 2x4 and a 2x8 
that really made it easy to handle the 300 lb assembly underneath the van. 
Then I did a quick 
cleanup of the unit. I removed the torque convertor and siphoned all of the 
fluid out of it. 
Siphoned the fluid out of the transmission through the dipstick tube also.
This morning I separated the transmission from the differential. I drained the 
gear oil out of 
the differential and removed the pan. I removed the axle flanges and turbine 
shaft. Then I went 
to the dealer to get parts.
The following is a list of parts and dealer prices for the items that I picked 
up today.

Item Description				VW Part Number	Unit Price
Differential Pan Gasket	 		080 507 215		$30.42
Turbine Shaft Seal Ring			087 323 559		$15.84
Torque Convertor Oil Seal		003 519 089D	$19.14
Torque Convertor Bushing		003 323 611		 $8.64
Axle Shaft Seal (2)			016 409 399B	 $5.94
Differential/Transmission O-ring	010 409 549B	 $5.85
Differential/Transmission Gasket	010 321 385B	 $2.50
Transmission Cooler O-rings (4)	089 409 069		 $2.16

I also ordered some additonal parts and they should be in Thursday.

I will probably spend some time today redoing the CV joints and checking out 
the rear brakes. I 
intend to repack the rear wheel bearings while I have the Vanagon torn down 
this far.

The transmission should be in by Thursday. I should be able to get the Carat 
back on the road by 
Monday.

Happy Memorial Day
