&gt; Rich sez he replaced the indicator color (windows) in his speedometer.
&gt; Rich, are these homemade or actual acquirable parts...?
&gt; 
Wow, seems to abe a lot of interest in this...
OK, (big grin) I used......
Those little colored plastic subject tabs for file folders and
notebooks! A package of 24 in 6 colors is only $1.99 or so from your
local supply store. These are thick and sturdy, and my friend has used
them and they seem to have lasted for some time.

IMPORTANT!
Be very careful what kind of glue you use to hold these down. Many glues
will actually melt the plastic, thus slightly discoloring it, so don't
really glob it on, and you actually might want to test it a bit first to
see how strong the glue is. (I used superglue-overkill I think)
'
As to the little bulbs, make sure you get either 12v or 6v, whichever
you need, from your local VW store. They were fairly cheap. 

Anyway, good luck to you all...
Richard
