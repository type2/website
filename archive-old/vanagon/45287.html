&gt; Nearly mint condition.  Burgandy with factory stereo, floormats and bra. 
&gt;  Original owner - got this puppy right out of port.  88K miles with new 
&gt; tires and no dents, rust, nicks or damage of any kind.  Have always run 
&gt; Mobil 1 synthetic oil and changed at every 3K miles.  Very few luxury 
&gt; Carats to be had in this last model year for the Vanagon.  Best offer!  
&gt; Call quick!  Jim or Carol

if anyone is interested in this van i will gladly go check it out and 
report back!
