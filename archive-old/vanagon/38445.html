&gt; First time post been on list about 3 months wonderful information
&gt; Question: opinions wanted on 91 Westfalia,52,000 miles, poptop, bed
&gt; ,no sink,
&gt; no frig.  2 rear facing seats in back a/c heat good interior $11,900.

You lucky dog!  This is a Vanagon &quot;Multivan&quot;.  I spent the last three years 
looking for one just like this--a late model Vanagon Multivan with low 
mileage and A/C--in Southern Ontario.  A month ago I got tired of being a 
wannabus and bought an 89 Westie, which I love, but in my mind, the Multivan 
has three advantages:

 - the lower bed is wider
 - more cargo space if you take out the seats
 - more seating for passengers if you leave them in

The main disadvantages are of course, no fridge and stove and not nearly as 
many cool storage spaces.

I bought my 89 Westie for $16,900 Canadian (about $11,900 US given the 
current exchange rate).  It has 84,000kms (about 52,000 miles).  Mine also 
has A/C and was in excellent condition, both inside and out.  So it looks 
like the Multivan is quite comparable to my Westie in terms of price, 
mileage and options.

These are rare and I'd buy it in a second.  Hmmm... where is it, just in 
case you pass on it? :-)
