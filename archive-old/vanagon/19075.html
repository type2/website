Subject says it all.  I got these off from a 50's era splitty I believe.  
The plastic is in tact but riddled with fine internal cracks.  However, 
the metal housing has surface rust but it is intact...nothing a little 
powder coating or good paint job couldn't handle.  Lemme know if you are 
interested.  Just would like to get the parts out to those who can use them.
