Subject: Vacation!!

My wife and I and two 6 week old kitties are leaving on vacation in 4 
days. Call me crazy, but we are picking up our two new kitties and 
heading from Indianapolis to Charleston South Carolina to visit our 
daughter. She's working on the new movie with Jim Carry called Ace 
Ventura Pet Detective does something, or something like that. I will be 
driving my 1971 blue Riviera conversion camper (Blushie, named after my 
Godmother who willed me the money to fix her up). Blushie has never been 
this far from home before, and doesn't have a great track record on 
shorter trips. Maybe I'm crazy, but..., well yes, I'm crazy. Here's our 
proposed route: I-70 from Indianapolis to Cambridge Ohio. I-77 from 
Cambridge Ohio through Charleston WV, Charlotte NC, Columbia SC to 
Charleston SC. Going back it's Charleston SC to Columbia SC to Asheville 
NC to Knoxville TN, to Nashville TN, to Louisville KY, to Indianapolis.

My question is this: where will I be able to fine competent repair 
service along the way. If anyone has any ideas from anywhere along this 
route, please let me know. If anyone is touring through Indy, let me 
know. I'll be happy to set you up. 

We are also looking for good Blues bars, brewpubs and old antebellum 
style houses to take photographs of.

TIA,
