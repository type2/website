&gt;Right-On!  Besides, cheap gas is a God given right of every American! 
 Isn't
&gt;there some small third world oil producing nation we can overrun to protect
&gt;our rights!


No overrunning required-- they're quite happy to get rich selling it to us.
Everybody wins... until the oil runs out. By then we'll have developed
workable electric cars, and will be in the position that the oil countries
are in now. Except that we'll have gotten there, by sweating our brains
out in and R&amp;D effort, not by accidently finding ourselves over dead
dinosaurs' graves.


As I think back on it, hasn't our history been, when one third world country
overran another for its oil, we moved in only then and kicked the bastards
back out, and restored the original structure in all ways? And then left?

Oops, we benefitted from the original. That makes it wrong, doesn't it.

How I love Fridays...!

&quot;Tax the rich, subsidize the poor.&quot;

Any Questions?
