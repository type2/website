Subject: Rubber tape (Magic Wrap)

I went to Home Depot and called all the electrical supply houses in my area and
cannot find this stuff and no one has even heard of it.  If someone knows where
to get it could you please contact me and send me a roll.    THANKS
&gt; Remember the guy in Sweden who has this mail order company, and all? 
&gt; well..I contacted him...he cant help me. those were his words...so, I 
&gt; guess he cant deal w/ the US....any one else have a source for the self 
&gt; curing rubber tape that we spoke of?
keyword rubber tape
It sounds like this is the same tape I picked up at Home Depot not too
long ago.  Its name is &quot;Magic Wrap&quot;,  and it claims it &quot;FORMS A SOLID
RUBBER WRAP!&quot;  Also says it's a &quot;Multi-purpose rubber repair kit in a
roll.&quot;  It sounds like the same stuff described in the various posts.

Comes in a roll 1&quot; x 16'.  Made by Glosgow Manufacturing, London, Canada
