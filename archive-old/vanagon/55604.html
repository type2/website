Subject: Re: K2 EuroVan

Hi Folks

Just for kicks, I surfed over to the official VW web page (www.vw_dot_com) 
 and found a special section on the K2 Eurovan.  There is a cute 
 (virtual) graphic icon of the van driving around, but no real photos.  
  Lots of K2 and Golf promos.
Maybe VW is going to re-import these vans and they're just testing the 
 water, or in this case the snow.  It would be nice to have a choice in 
 van models that didn't cost $30K and you could easily find one.  Most 
 &quot;volks&quot; can't afford that.

Just my $0.02 and gripe at VW's marketing efforts (lack there of)

Joel
