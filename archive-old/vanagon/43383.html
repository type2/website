Subject: Re: front cover plate for 59 bus?

I need the front plate (i don't know what else to call it)
that covers the master cylinder, etc underneath the front 
for a 1959 bus.  I don't know how easily one from another 
year would fit, but I can't find anything in the junkyards
around here (yet).

also called belly pan, or under pedal  pans, they are the same on all post
barndoors splits.  i wouldn't pay more that ~$20 for one.
