Subject: '84 Westy Pop-Top Tent Screen Replacement

-- [ From: Thomas D. Hanlon * EMC.Ver #2.3 ] --

Listees,

Has anyone had any experience replacing the screen on the front of the
Westy tent? It is the horizontal white plastic piece which has a zipper
which runs around the two sides and the top.  The bottom is sewn, and it
appears to be a major renovation, including removing the entire tent to
stitch a new screen into it. It is a case of patches upon patches at this
point.
