Subject: Boxter engine

Hi
 I just finished reading a article about the new Boxter engine. There is
a good article about it in &quot;Excellence&quot; magazine. It was described in
detail. There are a few details about it that are interesting upgrades
for Porsche engines that should promise more longivity. It should be a
great Vanagon engine once they become available in the junk yards. I can
dream in the meantime.
