When I was in high school, we had a PDP 8 (I think) computer,
one of those ones with yellow punched tape to store your
programs and huge rolls of that cheap yellow teletype paper
as your &quot;screen.&quot;

One student, having learned a tiny amount of BASIC, wrote
this program:

10 PRINT &quot;MR. BOND SUCKS MOOSE&quot;
20 GO TO 10

Unfortunately, he hadn't learned the artful use of 
^C, so he was getting pretty worried that Mr. Bond
would show up as line after line after line printed
&quot;MR. BOND SUCKS MOOSE.&quot;  My brother had some fun with
him for a while by telling him, oh no we'll just have
to wait until it runs out of paper. . . . .
