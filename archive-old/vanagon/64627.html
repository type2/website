Subject:      circle the buses camp

Hi all,
I was wondering if any listees were planning to attend Burning Man.  Is
there a circle the buses VW theme camp?   If not we should form one.  I
plan to leave Salt Lake City this evening.  Hope to see some list folks
there.  My first time there so it will be interesting. Ken
