Subject:  Thermostat???

Hello everyone, I'm building an engine for my girlfriends ' 61 Bug and am
wondering about the thermostat.  I'd like to NOT install it at all and wire
the cooling flaps into an &quot;always open&quot; position.  I'm taking out the heat
exchangers and running J-tubes so not having a heater is obvious.  I did this
with my Type III engine, wiring the cooling flaps open but I'm just want to
get some advice for doing this with a Type I.  It's not driven much in the
winter although the winters can be cold (Eastern Washington). Thanks for the
input.....
