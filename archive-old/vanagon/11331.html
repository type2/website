From: Richard &lt;rapalmer_at_unity.ncsu_dot_edu&gt;

So, as the time approaches, we have reached the point of deciding
exactly what we wish to do for our little soiree. Stefan and I met today
and discussed the possiblilties for communal meals, so now we cast the
vote- who is interested in doing such a thing? Do we want to do a dinner
and a breakfast, or what? Should we assign folks to bring various things?
Anyway, all interested parties please respond. I plan to head out there
Friday the 17th around lunch time to pick the best spot, and set up
camp. I will leave directions at the main gate as to where exactly we
will be. Remember, the gates will be closing at 6:00. So, if you are
planning on coming, please let us know your thoughts. Also, if you don't
see your name on the list, please tell us, as well as thoughts on when
you will be arriving. As always, all the pertinent information is
below...
thanks
Richard

&gt; &gt; &gt;   Frank Terhaar - somewhere in NC

&gt; &gt;     Donald Baxter - Atlanta
&gt; &gt;     Sami Dakhlia (possibly) - Missouri
&gt;       Jerry Huff - Durham N.C.
&gt;       Jeff Howard - Chapel Hill NC
&gt;       Jason Teets - Raleigh
&gt; **Several people have mentioned bringing family and/or friends as well**
&gt; Wow, 12 vans, plus people. 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Others have expressed past interest, so if you do not see your name
&gt; &gt; &gt; here, please do respond soon. Also, at least one communal meal has been
&gt; &gt; &gt; suggested. Perhaps some suggestions for that? Perhaps two, a breakfast
&gt; &gt; &gt; and a dinner? Also, when are folks planning to arrive?(stressing that
&gt; &gt; &gt; gates do close at 6pm) Also , some regional caravaning has been
&gt; &gt; &gt; suggested.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  Ok, I have seen so far a few people interested. George Washington's
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Birthday weekend seems to be the time of choice. This is Friday Feb. 17
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; through possibly Monday, Feb. 20. Those interested would I suppose meet
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Friday afternoon/evening, and others join when possible. Sorry to bother
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; those who have already replied yes, but please, let's get a sort of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; final count and idea of times people could arrive. ( I will probably get
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there Friday early afternoon, and remember, the gate closes at 6) Also,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; should we dare to try a communal eating set-up?any ideas/volunteers for
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that? Anyone bringing kids/dogs/guitars/anything else?  I am not much of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; an organizer, so I'm sure I'm forgetting a lot. Please do respond, even
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; if you have already. Thank you all and have a lovely day. I have included
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; below all the information about the location, the Jordan Lake State Park.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   So, there is ONE park open now, it is the Jordan Lake State Park. It
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is on highway 64, around Apex, N.C. which is actually closer to D.C, and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; around the same from the South.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   They have 100 spaces available now, 6 people per space (as many
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; vehicles as you can fit! ) and it's $9.00 for a regular space, and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; $14.00 for a space with a power hook-up (this is per space, not per
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; person) The park gates are open 8 am - 6 pm, and the number for all
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wishing further details is 1-919-362-0586. This is the park office, open
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 9-5. As Isaid, this is on a lake, with trails to hike, etc. I have talked
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to several people that have been there, and they all said it was nice.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
