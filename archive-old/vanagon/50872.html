Subject: Where would you go in your VW? &lt;a friday question&gt;

May I propose a mental break for the mechanically weary:

Where would you like to be able to drive your favorite VW if given the time,
health, and a modest budget. Who would you take along and why? What vehicle
would you take?

I personally would love to escape Arizona with Mrs.VanBondo in the then
completed '67 RFH Westy from May through late September and visit Northern
California, Oregon, up to Washington, into Canada's B.C. then over into the
Banff area and gradually wander south into the Yellowstone kind of areas
then back to Arizona &lt;or not&gt;. Of course we would avoid all of the tourists
and have wide open roads and be able to take a leisurely pace. &lt;Dream on&gt; 
This trip would be an extension to a brief one time childhood visit with my
parents and sister. As I recall it &lt;Banff&gt; was the most beautiful place that
I have ever seen.
Reality is that with the limited vacation time and budget, we will be lucky
to squeak a trip to NorCal and back this (next) Summer. Solvang?
Sacramento's Vintage Show and a little camping thrown in?

Where would *you* go in *your* VW?
