Subject: some wind!!!


Interesting gas mileage...

I filled up the '87 weekender with SUNOCO 94 octane
before I left from Pittsburgh Friday evening (unlike Bob H., 
I only have the factory-installed, regular gas tank in the '87),
and reset the trip counter.  After arriving to Bethlehem, PA
Friday night, and driving the '87 most of Saturday, I filled up
again, to my amazement, could not put more than 14.67 gallons
in there!!! This even after I waited a good 30+ seconds for the
tank's contents to settle down when the pump automatically
cut off on me...

In all, the '87 had covered 341 miles with 14.67 gallons, meaning
23.2 mpg !!!  I figure the winds must have been blowing my way.


maybe the next step is to install a mast...  Steve, what would
that be called?  SailAgon????  :-)
