&lt;&lt; I've never seen fighting like this on the list.  I can understand Martha
 not wanting to be on the losing end of the battle, but in this case,
 stubbornness isn't going to get you anywhere and could very well give
 you a life-threatening illness.  It's really not worth it.
 
 And I apologize if this sounds like &quot;gang up on Martha day.&quot;  I am sure
 Martha is a fine individual (anyone who drives an air-cooled Vanagon
 must be :-) ) and an asset to the list.  I just happen to disagree with
 her on this issue (and it seems like most other CCC members do too). 
 There's no reason to break up the CCC over this issue.  If you want to
 have an intelligent debate, fine, but quit this third-grade BS that's
 going on.  It's really embarassing.  
 
 I'm sorry if I'm out of line posting this message, but this is how I
 feel about the issue as I see it on the list.

RIGHT ON Sean!!!    

 We've heard the emotional, irrational, sensible and scientific sides to this
issue. I even learned WHY not to burn plastic in an open fire (below 5,000
degrees) .  Thanks Glen, I learned something.  I always like to know why or
why not to do anything.... That's why I joined this list!

I'm going to do my best to remember not to burn it, and I'm going to do my
best to stay away from burning plastic.....   And, I'm going to do my best to
not read any more &quot;burning plastic&quot; threads.   But thanks for the good read
to all sides.

Finally, to change the subject:  I got my Syncro rebuilt and installed for
$2,000 with a three year wartantee near Seattle, WA......  Anybody need the
details?
