Subject: EV MV/GL/CL Equipment...possibly a bit late...

Bill Killian dropped me a line and mentioned that someone had requested
a list of what the differences were between the MV/GL/CL were, so
here's what I have (as self-appointed-defender of Eurovans) in my
library:

FRONT PASSENGER AREA
CL - Two bucket seats with cloth surface and vinyl trim, adjustable 
backrests and headrests
GL - Two fully cloth-coverd captain's chairs with adjustable armrests, 
backrests and headrests
MV - Two fully velour overed captain's chairs with adjustable armrests, 
backrests and headrests

CENTER PASSENGER AREA
CL - Two person seat with adjustable headrests, plus arm rest, storage
area and cupholder on the end. Seat folds forward and is easly removed.
GL - Two person seat with adjustable headrests, a center armrest plust 
armrest
and cupholder on the end. Seat folds forward to convert to a tray table and 
is easily removed
MV - Two rear-facing seats, located directly behind the front cabin seats. 
Both seats feature adjustable armrests and backrests. Seats fold up (theatre 
style) and are easily removable.

REAR PASSENGER/CARGO AREAS
CL - Three-person seat with adjustable headrests. Seat folds forward once, 
then can tumble forward again to greatly expand the cargo area and is 
removed with a simple hand tool.
GL - Three person seat with armrests and adjustable headrests for each 
passenger. Seat folds forward once, then can tumble forward again to greatly 
expand the cargo area and is removed with a simple hand tool.
MV - Three person seat with adjustable headrests. Seat folds into a 
two-person bed measuring 72&quot; by 55&quot; and is removable without tools.


So there are the differences....possibly a bit late...but what the hell.
