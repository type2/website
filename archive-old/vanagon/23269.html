Subject: Re: Bodywork Book?



Chris,

One of the most common short-comings of books on body-work is that they're
all writen by experts very obvious in their speaking 'down' to the likes of
us mere mortals.  They always have the right tools (and seem to spend a lot
print promoting certain lines), always work in a neat shop and everything
always comes out perfectly straight, better than new, shiny bright... until I
sick-up all over the page.

You don't learn too much from such a book.  Spend thirty years banging on
body work and your results might look like those in the books.  It gets
pretty discouraging.  Then too a lot of the books are oriented purely toward
commercial repairs, geared to a standard level of acceptance dictated by
insurance companies who are their ultimate customer.  The books show you how
to do it fast and pretty and cheap enough to make a fat profit.  They don't
always show you how to do it right.

On the other end of the scale is the guy who starts with a flat sheet of
steel and ends up with a Ferrari 'America' after whirling about it like a
dervish in a flurry of body hammers, exotic dollys, welding rigs we've never
heard of and long lectures about the demise of quality craftsmanship in
America.

Pour over any of these tomes and you may pick up a few hints that will help
you with your project.  Then again, you may not.  The handiest book on body
work I've ever seen was about twelve pages long and not much bigger than a
hand of cards.  It had one drawing per page along with a short paragraph that
explained how to deal with that particular type of dent, wrinkle or tear.  My
dad bought it for a dime, mail order when he was a boy and learned
body-working from it.  He gave it to me, I read it, learned body-working from
it and promptly lost it.

But there's still hope.  A gentleman named Tommy Sandham has written a book
titled 'Panel Craft', by Willow Publishing, Barecroft Common, Magor, Newport,
Gwent, NP6 3EB.  (Apparently, that is what passes for a street address in
England.  Good luck.)

The British Library Cataloguing in Publication Data spif reads:

Sandham, Tommy
  Panel Craft; Featuring Ford Cortina
  MK.1 bodyshell restoration.
  1. Automobiles -- Conservation and restoration -- Amateur manuals
  
   I Title
   629.28'722     TL152.2

   ISBN 0-9512523-0-5

The truly unique thing about Mr. Sandham's book is that it will show you
auto-body repair from the non-professional point of view; it offers a glimpse
of reality.  This is a book without glitter.  The repairs, while functional,
do not have the polished perfection that comes from thirty years of
experience.  This rare viewpoint makes it clear that the novice is indeed
capable of doing his own bodywork.

I do not mean to speak disparagingly of Mr. Sandham's efforts, but offer him
sincere congratulations.  He has done us all a service.  

-Bob

PS - In an earlier post I uploaded a review of a repair and restoration
manual specific to Volkswagens.  I believe you'll find the post among the
'sermons' on Richard's web page.  Since your question probably reflects the
feelings of other list subscribers, I will make this a general posting.
