hello there all!
   well its been a while since i have been able to do any real work on
the bus lately.... ever since i found out I AM GOING TO BE A POPPA!!!!
sorry, i have to tell everyone that:)  anyway i have a few questions
here and there about some things, and wanted some advice, so here
goes.  well, i have a 73  bus with camper top, but no heater blower
motor.  so i am going to get a used one today, and install it this
weekend, and had a few questions pertaining to that.

HEATER FAN QUESTIONS:
- how can i check and make sure the fan/motor is in good shape?

i believe that normally the fan is attatched to the top of the engine 
compartment, with two hoses that run down into the (?)heater boxes(?)
that then go up to the front of the bus.  i've checked these chanels
as much as i can, and they seem to be ok.  there is some sort of
canvas/insulation around them.  

- this motor is supposed to turn on when i turn on the heat with the
lever in the bus.  correct?  this fan is to supplie (hopefully) warm
air when the bus is at idle or slow speeds?  i want to check and make
sure the wires are in good shape, so i am going to get a volt meter
also (actually i already bought one, but it was broken, so i have to
take it back:)

where does all the filtering out of bad fumes/engine dirt happen.
should the piece that holds the fan and hoses also have some sort of
screen/filter?  


TRANNY and BREAK MAINTENANCE QUESTIONS:
i am going to empty then refill the transmition fluid.  i need a 17mm
hex wrench, 3 quarts of transmition oil, and somesort of pump to get
it all in there.  these are also on my shopping list.  it looks pretty
easy. empty then refill until it begins to spill back out.  anything
else? the brakes will get adjusted and bled this weekend also.  i have
just begun to hear an occasional squeek from the from the  right wheel
when  breaking so i'll be changin the pads there (looks simple?)  i am
going to check the rear drum pads/shoes also.  are those hard to
change out if they are worn.  will i need a special tool? 


LUBRICATION:
i also want to lubricate everything i can.  i've looked in bently for
places that need it.  i have no 'tools' or grease for this, so i'll be
looking to buy some.  any suggestions, or is the standard tube
loadable grease gun and an array of cartriges good (i can look in my
book again on what types of grease i need)  can you tell i get paid
this week?



well, i'll stop there for now, but will probably be hitting eveyone up
again real soon for some collective wisdom.  hope all is going well
for everyone!

take care,
	brandy
