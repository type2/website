Subject: Exhaust Systems &amp; Other Ramblings....

Hey all!  I was wondering if anyone had heard of a &quot;J-Tube&quot; setup for a '73
Type IV motor.  I see them all over creation for Bugs and early Busses, but
no one seems to make them for pancake motors!  My heat exchangers don't have
much longer before they move on to a higher plane of existance (i.e.
disintegrating FAST!) and I really don't want to pay $250 a side when I don't
need heat anyway!  Heat?!?!  We don't need no stinkin' heat!  OK, so if
anyone has heard of any custom exhausts or have done one yourself, all hints
and tips would be greatly appreciated!

Now, for the dilemma....

I have a really nice '73 Sportsmobile that I just more or less finished
restoring.  It's not perfect, but I think it looks pretty damn good.  Anyway,
the guy that did the bodywork runs a little VW place down in Boston, NY and
sells quite a few Bugs &amp; Busses.  He knows I've been always half-looking for
a Splittie Panel Van and lo and behold, he's getting a '65 in this week.  The
guy wants $1000 and the van is probably worth it.  He'll even take a deposit
and payments, if I want!  Unfortunately, I have about a million other bills
that need taking care of.  So, my problem is (bored yet?) - how do I
rationalize getting into ANOTHER project?!?!  Most of my friends and family
(OK, all of 'em!) think I am certifiable for even considering buying another
Bus, especially one that is a project!  The other dilemma is that he has a
really nice '86 or '87 Vanagon coming in for around $4000 that would make a
beautiful daily driver and I could dump my '90 Jetta.  So, I guess I'm
looking for reasons why I should consider a '65 project over a '86 driver and
what to look for on both.  If I get the '65, I should sell my '73, but have
absolutely NO desire to!  If I get the Vanagon, I'll sell the Jetta without a
second thought.  OK, viewpoints?  Pros and cons?  Hate mail??!?!?!?!

Thanks for all!
