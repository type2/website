Subject: Reply to various digest offerings - grits, raised rear, heaters


Oh, boy, what a lot of traffic we generate!
Attached are (short) comments on today's (Sunday) digest.

&gt; Subject: Re: in defense of grits! 
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;defense of grits deleted...&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Hmmm.
&gt; 
&gt; In this part of the VWorld, grits are spread on the road by the 
&gt; County Council to stop you from skidding on ice...
&gt; 
&gt; What the **** _are_ grits?

&gt; Subject: in defense of grits! 


If you didn't get it from the other response, &quot;grits &quot; are a type of
breakfast meal in the same family as cream of wheat or oatmeal, but made
from corn.  Tasty (properly doctored), but not light.  Most common in the 
south.  BTW, &quot;Shponfirckle&quot;, Gaelic? Nonsense? 


&gt; Subject: RE: Raise The Rear!!!
&gt; 
&gt; Speaking of raising the rear, my 78 is getting tired rearend wise, and has 
&gt; sagged a fair amount. Of course the correct way is to remove the trailing arm
&gt; plates etc.etc.etc., and realign the splines for the correct squat. Well, I
&gt; am self admittedly a lazy s.o.b., just ask my wife. The lazy man's way 
&gt; would seem to be air shocks or coil springs to raise the buttend back up.
&gt; Any comments on this oh wise ones?? :)

I looked into this for my '78 and could find no one that made either air 
shocks or spring shocks for the bus.  A great idea, but...


&gt; Subject: Found: Type II graveyard


&gt; I asked the owner about gas heaters, and he said, &quot;You know, people just
&gt; weren't interested in them, so I put them all in storage.  I have about 25
&gt; of them from all types of VW's (some type II's) and I want to sell them as
&gt; a lot.  On the other hand, I just sold one to a guy yesterday for $75.  How
&gt; much for the whole lot?  Well, I'd like to get $50 each or around there&quot;.
&gt; He also mentioned that he only wanted to sell the heaters as units (sorry 
&gt; Jack R.).
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,

Oh, boy, oh, boy!  Heat!  I call tomorrow, maybe we get heat this weekend!
Thank you, David!
