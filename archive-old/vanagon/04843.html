So Christa says:
&gt; 
&gt; This is Christa now, and I want everyone to know that I am a 
&gt; technophobe.  When I write letters, I revel in the act of addressing the 
&gt; envelope, of sealing it with wax even, of dropping it in the mailbox and 
&gt; being able to think for days about how my comments, stories, intimacies 
&gt; will affect the addressed.  There.  

Yeah, but the replys take FOREVER! compared to the mailing lists/newsnet.
And I want that reply now dammit! Now! NOW!  NOOWW!!  

.....Excuse me.......  got out of control there for a second....   ;)


&gt; coming home to a guaranteed job.  This is my first time on the net, did I 
&gt; do o.k.?  I have to go get Tobin now to show me how to get out of it 
&gt; now.  Bye everyone!

I dunno, maybe you need to buy a vowel or two..... ;P  Well, if we can
let the likes of Ric on here....I guess we can let anybody on....   What 
do ya think folks?......

Uh hmm....Seriously now, your typing looks just fine to me.  :D

&gt; Important BTW: We have nothing against the Trans-Canada route from Kenora 
&gt; west.  It's just that we've done it a number of time already, It'll be 
&gt; cold, and Joel's right: we'll be under the gun for time.

I second Joel's comment about the hotels stops.  It's the only way to
keep your sanity.

Have a good safe trip!

Steven
