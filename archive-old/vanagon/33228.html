Subject: RE: license plate frames


&gt;At most autopart stores (Kragen, Grand Auto, etc.) they sell a &quot;kit&quot; which
&gt;is basically a blank frame with self-adhesive letters of the alphabet 
(often
&gt;2 or 3 of each letter).  With this, you can create your own custom license
&gt;plate frame, have it say what you want it to, change it if you like, and
&gt;be totally in charge of the graphic design/layout.  I can't remember what
&gt;this thing cost, but it was reasonable...


But, the $64,000 question: Does this kit have an at-sign (_at_) for email
addresses such as vanagon_at_lenti???
