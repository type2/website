Subject: Fridge Relay

The relay comes on only in the presence of alternator output. It shuldn't be
on unless the engine is running. It is separate from the load reduction
relay. It keeps your fridge from running off 12 v if the alternator isn't
supplying juice so you don't risk running your batteries dead. 

If you want the option to run the fridge off 12 volts when the van is parked
(like at a gas station on a long trip) then you can defeat the relay by
joining the two wires that go through old style fuses  next to the driver door.

When you hook your 2nd battery in to the camper, and you use super high
power relays the way you should (instead of isolators) then you might want
to operate these relays by means of this fridge relay. Fridge relay on = 2nd
battery connected to the system; fridge relay off (alternator off) = 2nd
battery disconnected. This way, you will set the system up so both batteries
are only connected together when voltage exceeds 12 volts so that no battery
can drain into the other one.


&gt;Yes, you read that right, relay for the water pump/fridge main power line.
&gt;WHAT THE HELL IS THIS RELAY ALL ABOUT ?   Sorry for the shouting but this
