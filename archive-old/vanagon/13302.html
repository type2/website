&gt; I really didn't want this to happen.  As I said in my original post, I love
&gt; the older vans, but I'm afraid that they would be too much maintenance.  At
&gt; least one response has said &quot;It ain't so!&quot;

&gt; I'm just wondering aloud... what should I do?

Keep 20K in the bank.  Use the other 10K to pick up a very good condition
air-cooled Westy (80-83.5) and add a few nice toys to it.

&gt; Getting a Vanagon Westfalia Syncro GL sounds great, though I doubt I could
&gt; find one.  Do the Syncros get lousy mileage?

I don't think so, but the Synchro owners will know for sure.  IMO unless you
do a lot of driving in the snow or mud, the synchro is just too expensive to
buy and maintain (from what I've heard on this list).

They are wonderful, and I'd love to have one, but there are other things I
would rather spend the money on.
