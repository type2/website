Subject: Getting Weber to run correctly.

I got my T4 rebuild started yesterday. The funny thing is that getting it started was the easy
part.  I am having the worst time getting the darn thing to run
smoothly.  Along with the rebuild I purchased a new Weber progressive
carb.  I have no idea how to adjust it, and it didn't come with a lick
of literature.  Muir's books says that for a 1973 1.7 liter manual
transmission, the timing should be set to 10 degrees ATDC.  With the
engine started I put the timing to this setting using a stobe timing
light.  Now I don't know if the idle fuel mixture is correct, and it
is a pain to adjust the idle speed screw.  The problem is that
everytime I give it some gas, the carb spits up a flame with a PSSST
sound.  Is the 10 degrees ATDC correct?  DO you have any idea why the
carb is spitting.  Note: I have a bosch 009 dist., not a vacum
advanced one.  Once again, any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks, Aaron
