Subject: Fw: Cupholders in late Westy's

FYI, Mark Upton in Akron (Cuyahoga Falls), OH sells cup holders very
similar to these in black and blue for pretty cheap, like $5 each or
something. These are the type that fold up relatively flat. I put them in
both my wife's '86 and my old '83 which I sold. Very cool!

Oh, I'm pretty sure he advertises in Limbo as &quot;Mark's VW Parts&quot;. He also
sells some cool stickers and those VW shop shirts too.

No, I'm *NOT* on comission ;-&gt;

Anybody remember the &quot;most cupholders&quot; contest from the pre-split days??
:-)

&gt; The late model Wolfsburgs had factory installed black cupholders front
and
&gt; back. Did the late model Westys also have these installed and where, in
the
&gt; back, were they located?
