&gt;You said that you saw the spark advance
&gt;when you rev the engine but double check the weights inside the
&gt;distributor for movement.  Spray liberally with WD40 if dry.


Don't get WD-40 on the point contacts! Also don't get it on the distributor
cam lobes where the little phenolic piece on the points rides. There's
a special grease on the cam lobes (or should be!!), but WD-40 might
wash it off.

If you get WD-40 on any of these parts, dry them off with a paper towel,
re-grease the cam lobes (NAPA has the grease if you don't already), and
back to the drawing board.
