N.G., I think, to try to add a pop top to a non-pop top vanagon since the
roof is specially reinforced for pop top at the factory to allow that big
hole in the roof. Cut such a hole in a non pop-top vanagon and you have a big
job to figure out how to reinforce the entire roof. Someone I know who of
great competency considered this problem concluded that it was too hard to
attempt.t
