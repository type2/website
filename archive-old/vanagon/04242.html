Subject: West Coast Travels

Just back from a marvelous two week jaunt down the Pacific Coast, Seattle 
to San Francisco, via Hwy's 101 and 1.  Generally great weather (though 
did have to summarily blast past some of S. Oregon and N. Cal. to avoid 
an impending weather system - hit these areas on the way back instead. 
Certainly, the ease/inexpense of such a maneuver is one of the Westy's great
strengths).  Naturally, saw lots of other buses/vanagons along the way 
and, as usual, got several enthusiastic comments/inquiries about Westy 
traveling/camping.  

This being about our tenth such trip (and frequently extending all the 
way to LA and including side trips to inland CA and Oregon as 
well), I've accumulated a fair amount of information about these areas.  
While I'd hoped (someday) to assemble some of this into a brief FAQ, 
until (if) I do, I'd be more than happy to answer any questions, make 
suggestions, etc. for any VW folks contemplating such a trip.  It's a 
gorgeous area, full of fun and interesting things to see and do.  So full 
it seems we discover more each year than the year before!
