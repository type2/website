Subject: Oil Pressure _at_ Cold Temps

Over the past several weeks there has been several discussions concerning low
oil pressure, flickering oil lights, warning buzzers, and filters.  The problem
of a flickering oil light has never happened to me..... although my buzzer did
come on once..... broken wire from pressure sensor.  However, today, would you
believe, my warning light and buzzer comes on, a couple of times, just after
starting.  The weather has gotten real cold all of the sudden in Connecticut.
Soon as the car warms up, no problems, even at idle.  Has anyone ever had a
similiar problem?  By the way I have been using  Fram filters with no problems
to date........OH NO!!!!
