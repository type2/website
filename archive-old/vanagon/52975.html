Subject: Re: Non- VW Headlights


&gt;Hey Guys,
&gt;
&gt;Over the weekend I was driving along and saw a new mercades coming up
&gt;behind me with very well focused headlights that had a blue hue to
&gt;them.  They were really bright.

That are Xenon lights. BMW, Mercedes and one Japanese van using this
style of headlights.

&gt;Has anyone seen them or know about them?  Could I get them or something
&gt;like 'em for my 86GL?

I don't think so, but when you rebuilt the grille yourself, you can buy
after-market headlights, spots and fog-lights from Hella. They mostly
squared in 7 cm x 12 cm dimension. I saw after-market Vanagon grilles for
this style of headlights but they are no longer available.
