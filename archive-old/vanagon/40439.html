Subject: Tranny/Engine mounts for T4-&gt;T1 engine conv.?

Hey now,
        Anybody know if I could take a later baywindow and drop my ('70)
engine/tranny combo into it? I'd like to find a '71 westy for Inuvik, but
if I find a 72+ I can either convert my interior, or convert the other
busses' engine/tranny. I don't want a T4 engine. Ever notice on the
keyboard that the number 4 &amp; the dollar symbol occupy the same key? I did.
;-)
        Of course, a '67 westy would be best, but I doubt I'll find one and
have the cash for it before July. Any help gladly accepted...

Peace,
