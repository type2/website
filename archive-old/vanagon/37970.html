Subject: H2O pump help needed.

Hello-

i continue to progress on the heads on my '87.  i'll post a full 
message when i'm done.  a few questions:

water pump.  how do i get this blasted thing off?  i can't reach the 
nut behind the wp pulley/crank pulley.  i might be able to if the wp 
pulley were off but i can't lock it firm enough to loosen the 3 
bolts-- how do i lock the water pump pulley in place????

push rod tubes.  should i re-install these AFTER the head is on for 
ease in aligning things up?  or isn't it too bad to slip the head on 
and align 4 tubes at once?

thanks.  

-dan
