Subject: NICK! DUCK!

Nick McRee thinks he knows what does or doesn't terrorize women.  I expect 
he'll get flamed for forgetting that men and women only APPEAR to have evolved
on the same planet.  The fact that the two sexes experience the event de-
scribed so differently is pretty scary in itself.
