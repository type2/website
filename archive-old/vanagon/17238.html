&gt;does KYB even make shocks for vanagons?? that's one of the problems
&gt;with
&gt;non-vw shocks: finding someone that makes them. Koni makes them in
&gt;Holland,
&gt;but few dealers want to import them over here (it seems).

Wolfsport in Berkley mentioned KYB's for my syncho so they apparently carry
them...
