Subject: Requested: suggestions for Maine Vacation


O.K., it looks like we're doing it... 

The Seren gang will take a 4-day road trip and visit Maine...  We're
planning to take off July 28th in the early evening, drive as long as
we can (with a short stop for coffe at our former neigbor's place in
Connecticut and also to drop their daughter -- who will be visiting us
between July 22nd and 28th), crash somewhere, then take off and drive
to Maine Saturday morning.  We plan to drive back all day Tuesday...

Any suggestions about Maine?  A friend of mine suggested Bar Harbor(?)
any other suggestion for places to visit?  any good campgrounds you
folks out in Maine know of?  Our kids really like going out for whale
watching -- any suggestions about ports that we can do that from?
Good places to eat? Scenic routes?  any good, reasonable priced hotels
around (in case the weather turns too sour for camping)?

Anyway, as I'm sure you folks get the drift, we'll appreciate any
ideas, thanks in advance...
Cetin

BTW,  someone suggested a ferry trip to Canada -- how long do these
take, any good ones to suggest?

Thanks again...
