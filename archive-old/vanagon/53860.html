Subject: Bad Headlights

Hi Derek,
        Thanks for the information on the low voltage at the headlights.  I
have been running 100 watt H3 for about a year now.  It has passed state
safety inspections with no problem.  I also removed most of the shield
inside the low beam headlights.  The bulb is almost completely covered by a
metel shield.  I removed the sides of the shield and left the small ring
infront of the bulb.  I was afraid that by removing it, that I might blind
oncomming drivers.  I have seen a marked inprovement in the light to the
sides and some inprovement in distance.  I have been thinking about removing
the rest of the shield.  There is a black painted shield on the top of the
bulb, that should be sufficent to prevent blinding people.   
        Thanks again for the info.
