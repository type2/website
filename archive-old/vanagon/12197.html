Subject: redrock/pseudo-shower


I'm working very hard trying to rig up something that we can all use
as a shower at Red Rock (since there aren't any there!).  It involves
a small, D-cell battery powered submersible pump and David Schwarze's
plastic inflatable shower enclosure.  But, I still need the following:

a 2, preferably 3-burner propane stove that's RELIABLE

a metal vessel to heat water on the above, preferably about the
     10 galloon or so size.  Ideally, it would have as much surface
     contact as possible with the propane stove - need something 
     shaped rather like a 10 gallon fish aquarium, that is, rectangular,
     flat bottom, etc.  But, realizing that that may be next to
     impossible to find, does someone have the &quot;next best&quot; thing?

lastly, it would help to have some sort of table or stand to prop
     the heated water on.  The higher the better, as it gives less
     resistance to the pump, and therefore we'd get more pressure and
     a better shower.
