Subject: Falling rock

Looking at the safety chapter in FAQ, i can tell that the eurovan is a 
pretty safe vehicle in some kinds. For a couple a days ago, one of our 
eurovan syncros was hit by falling rock. The rock was ore about 50 
kilos, fell from about 4 metres height. It hitted the roof right in the 
middle, between front and rear doors. The roof sunk in about 15 cm and 
the inner roof came loose. It looks like a little bird-bath now. The 
strange part is that all four doors operate with no hassle whatever. The 
door opening mechanisms operate just like the car was new. You dont have 
to slam the doors to close them, not more than usual. We shall have the 
roof replaced in the workshop soon. Its a 96 syncro crewcab pickup with 
four doors.
