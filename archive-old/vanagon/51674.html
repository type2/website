Subject: EV fuel/temp gauge revisited.

OK, well w/ input from Jack Lowry and Mark Chapman, here's my $0.02
worth to contribute:


1) remove the steering wheel (uses 24mm or 15/16&quot; socket)
2) remove cover around the steering column
3) remove turn signal and wiper switch from the column (Note: there are
    3 flathead/TORX screws to do this, DON'T remove the phillips head screw)
3a) There will also be up to five (5) wire connectors to disconnect)
4) remove black plastic inside of gauge cave (2 screws on top)
5) remove plastic face over gauges (2 small screws, one on each side of cover)
5a) You may also remove the entire cluster by reaching up behind and dis-
      connecting the speedo cable (squeeze tabs) and wiring harness, then re-
      moving the two screws (1 each side) holding the cluster to the dash
6) remove tach (it just plugs in)

Problem is related to 3 solder connections in a row at about 2 o'clock
position in the hole where the tach was.  Connections need to be reheated
w/ perhaps a little solder added.  Mark mentioned that there were four (4)
solder joints above the voltage regulator (would that be the IC?) that had
minute cracks requiring a magnifying glass to see.  Since there were any
number of solder joints that qualified for the descriptions given, I just went
ahead and soldered all the component solder joints in that quadrant.
(I think it was only about 4-5 components at most).

Buttoned the sucker back up and the gauges are working normally.

As Jack and Mark (and I) would say, you're on your own w/ this fix;
at a fairly relaxed pace, this repair would take a couple hours to complete.
