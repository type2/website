&gt; This is kinda off subject, but I just remembered at bug-out 34 that I
&gt; saw a late '70s Westy that had a hardwood parquet floor in the camping
&gt; area! Anybody seen anything like this before??
&gt; 
&gt; 	yup, in fact it was last summer at the Ben &amp; Jerry's Camping 
trip in VT... fellow had a '87 AdventureWagen with a nice parquet floor 
said it was part of the AdventureWagen package that he bought ( along 
with Microwaveand other niceties...)
