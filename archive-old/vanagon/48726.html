Subject: Re: water from A/C Unit

Ahhhhh.  Finally an answer that explains it (I hope).  I don't have the 
flaps, and I've tried to stick things up the hoses to clean them out.  
Where can I get the rubber pieces that go on the end of the drain hoses? 
dealer?  I don't know what they look like or I'd construct one myself.

Thanks.

&gt;  I had water leak from the A/C unit once.  It actually would get the carpet
&gt;  wet by the rear of the sliding door.
&gt;  
&gt;  The pan you describe is drained by two hoses that go down the side panels
&gt;  part way.  I couldn't get to them from in the van, but from outside you can
&gt;  remove the air intake grills on the van sides at the rear upper corners
&gt;  (the black plastic grills).  Inside there you should see a black rubber
&gt;  hose.  Mine had some piece on the end that plugged up with who knows what,
&gt;  probably some growth of sorts.  I just removed the piece.  Never leaked
&gt;  since.

&gt; That rubber piece is actually a check valve.  It plugs up with dirt that the
&gt; A/C washes out of the air.  That piece should not be removed as it functions
&gt; to keep air from flowing backwards through the tubes.  With the fan on high
&gt; and the van traveling at highway speeds, enough air will flow through the
&gt; tubes to keep the water from draining down.  A long trip with out stopping
&gt; will make this evident.  Cutting a small notch in the flap will allow more
&gt; dirt to pass and allow the water to drain faster but you should not remove
&gt; the flap.  I often use my van for long trips and It took me two years to
&gt; figure out why I still got rained on with the ruuber tips removed.  I now
&gt; clean them twice a year.  Only takes a few minutes.
