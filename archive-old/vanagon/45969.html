&gt;&gt; As I tried to explain when a co-worker asked &quot;just what does 'Fukengruven'
&gt;mean anyway??&quot; 
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Oh man, I know what you mean. The folks at the office think I'm totally
&gt;outta my tree. Then again these hosers think it's totally normal to work 101
&gt;hrs a week on a &quot;deadline&quot; for a program's release. Cee colon (sic)
&gt;backslash my arse! They seem totally amazed when the &quot;deadline&quot; slips at the
&gt;whim of the bigshots WAY up on the corp ladder. Hmmm... I'm at home having
&gt;the nerve to take a day of vacation that they regularly loose each year for
&gt;not taking them. Gee, I feel stoopid! ;-)

&gt;&gt;The Budweiser is cold about right now BTW! 8P

&gt;
&gt;GEE, WASN'T THAT ORIGINALLY &quot;FAHRFUHNUGEN&quot; OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT? I
SUPPOSE YOU HAVE SEEN ALL OF THE VARIATIONS THAT NOW ARE AVAILABLE ON SHIRTS
AND BUTTONS?  LIKE &quot;FARFRUMPUKKEN&quot; &amp; &quot;FUNKENSHROOMIN&quot; ? I SAW ONE TONITE AT
OUR LOCAL NOVELTY STORE IN THE MALL THAT SHOWED A LIL STICK FIGURE WITH TWO
BEERS AND IT SAID &quot;FARFROMGRADUATIN&quot;.  ...AND I HEAR THIS JOKE: &quot;WHAT'S THE
GERMAN WORK FOR CONSTIPATED?  --FAHRFRUMPOOPIN.&quot;   OH WELL.  KEEP UP THE
GOOD WORK, FELLER. I MAY EVEN GET BRAVE ENOUGH TO ACTUALLY POST SOMETHING ON
THE LIST SOMEDAY.
