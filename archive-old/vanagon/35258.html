Subject: re:VW T&amp;A

All,

I may be slow on the take with this, but is Bedwetter (I mean Ledbetter,
is that how you spell it) not the managing editor, or whatever title he
held?  I also noticed a distinct reduction in the amount of T&amp;A in the
mag.  Could this be the start of a revolution?

Just a thought(they're getting rarer everyday)
