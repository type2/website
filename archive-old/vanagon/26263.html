On Fri, 6 Oct 95 08:43:25 CDT david woodward wondered:
&gt;Does fuel injection protect against this type of fire? (no carb, fuel
&gt;lines configured differently)

nope. actually, if anything, fuel injection makes the problem worse ...
because of the much higher pressures in the fuel ring (that the injectors
are connected to), the fuel sprays out much faster and harder and is much
more likely to atomize (turn into a mist).

in my opinion.

on the other hand, fuel injection requires a stronger hose ... so maybe it's
not as likely to break. but even these stronger hoses get old and crack ...
and so the point is: if you can't recall when you last replaced ALL of your
fuel hoses, maybe it's a good thing to think about doing NOW before winter
sets in. my 88 bus has already had to have it's fuel hoses replaced.
