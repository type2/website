        The Candid Camera episode I remember best was the one in which an 
        extra gas tank was concealed in a a VW Bug and then driven in for 
        a fillup.  (Age note:  An attendent filled your tank and cleaned 
        your windshield at that point in history.)  As he pumped more and 
        more gas into the Bug, his eyes got larger and larger.  I don't 
        remember the details of the tank or its installation but I 
        vividly remember the gas station attendent's reaction.
