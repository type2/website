&gt;The Canadian version of daytime driving lights for 88-91's uses a normally
closed relay to turn

one side of the relay

The relay contacts

and to the 12V supply

relay is to keep from

&gt;I have wired my 91 up (temporarily) this way and it does work as advertised.


I need further enlightenment  8^).  on US vehicles, do the low beams usually
stay on at night when the high beams are used?  My concern is that on my '87
Westi, the illumination provided by the headlights at night seems only
marginally adequate as it is.  I haven't really noticed how much better they
are w/ the brights on.  While I like the idea of daytime driving lights,
have somewhat more concern about sacrificing any of the illumination now
available.  

I vaguely remember reading, when i first joined this list and didn't yet
have a bus, some discussion suggesting that round headlights were brighter
than square ones, and that swapping might be a solution.  If i decide this
is a priority, will have to check the archives.

Thanks for any info,

Gail
