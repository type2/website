Subject: Re: Cold Starting Question

In a message dated 96-01-24 07:03:21 EST, you write:

&gt;I am finding that I have a much easier time starting the Van in cold weather

&gt;if I give the accelerator a pump before starting the engine.  I know that 
&gt;most later model (all?) VWs have a choke of some sort, so it seems like this

&gt;shouldn't be helping.  Do any of you out there pump a little on the gas 
&gt;pedal before starting or I am just trying to flood my engine every morning?
&gt;
&gt;

Do you have a carb or fuel injection?  If it is fuel injection, contrary to
popular opinion, pushing the gas pedal half way to the floor manual sets the
cold start throttle valve in the open position.  There is not actually any
fuel being pumped since the fuel pump is electric and the ignition would have
to be turned on.  (If you listen carefully, you can hear the pump activating
when you turn on the ignition).  So to answer your question, yes it does
help, and no, you are not flooding your engine.  

If you have a carberator, none of the above applies.  I'm no expert when it
comes to carbs systems.
