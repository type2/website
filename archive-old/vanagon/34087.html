Subject: Programable W/W Upgrade: Vanagons Too?

     A similar thread has been going on over on the Quattro list.
     Some folks with late 80's Audis have upgraded their w/w by replacing
     the existing relay with the programable unit.


     Here are relevant snips from the Quattro list:


     Quote:

     The variable wiper interval relay is an over-the-counter Volkswagen
     part in the US.  The system was standard equipment on a number of VW
     models from  around '92-95.  I heard that it was dropped recently and
     the VWs are now back to the fixed interval relay used by Audi.

     I just stopped by my local VW dealer this morning to do some research.

     The part# is: 1HM 955 531A, and it replaces the Audi part# 443 955
     531. This is used in most Audis from mid-80's on (maybe '87+?). The
     relay is in the fuse/relay box, next to the fuses, third from the
     front of the car. It is white, with a &quot;271&quot; stamped on the top in big
     numbers.

     The new one dropped right into my '89 100Q, and works as follows:

     1) turn wipers to &quot;intermittent&quot; (*not* mist) 2) turn off
     3) wait time interval you want
     4) turn back to intermittent, it will repeat that interval.

     Unquote

     Someone wanna check out the relay number in their Vanagon during lunch
     today (I drove the Audi) and report back to the group if this is a
     possibility?
