                      The Poor Man's Press

If you've got a sturdy doorway, you've got a pretty good press. 
You will need a jack, a length of 2x4 and a socket that matches
the diameter of whatever you're pressing into place (bearing
race, oil seal, etc), but if you bought that $50 set of 3/4&quot;
drive sockets from Harbor Freight, one of the sockets will match
the diameter of anything you need to press-on to a Volkswagen.

The trick is to use the frame of the door as your press frame. 
Put the thing to receive the part on a piece of plywood in the
middle of the doorway, align the part being pressed into place,
put the driver/pressor onto it and put a bottle jack or screw
jack atop that.  Then cut a piece of 2x4 to fit between the top
of the jack and the top of the door frame.  Make sure everything
is nicely aligned, use the screw extension on the jack to take up
any slack, then do what comes naturally.

A Douglas fir 2x4 will withstand an enormous load in compression,
more than enough to install the typical bearing race (especially
if you leave the hub in the sun and the race in the freezer
before you do the installation).

                        Moving the World

If you've pulled the rear drums of a Volkswagen bug or bus you've
already learned that a length of waterpipe on your breaker bar
can turn a 97 pound weakling (even a girl-type weakling) into
Hulk Hogan.  The same principle of leverage can be applied to
installation of bearing races and seals.  Most oil seals go in
quite easily when you put the short end of the lever under your
bug or bus, position the seal driver and then lean on the long
end of the lever.

This gives you the Poor Man's version of an arbor press, and will
work right up to the point where your vehicle is about to tip
over.  And it doesn't take a rocket scientist to see that this
technique can be used to change a tire without a jack or to free
a mired wheel, assuming you have a strong enough lever.

                      Variations on a Theme

If you have a bottle jack and a doorway you can do most jobs that
would normally require a hydraulic press, but ball joints take up
to 10,000 pounds of force and assembling the gear cluster in the
tranny at least 5,000.  You will get the job done but your
doorway is liable to take on a new and unique shape.

When you need to apply more force than a doorway will withstand,
take yourself down to a scrap metal yard and prowl about for
steel 2x4's.  The guys at the scrap yard will insist on calling
the things 'C-sections' but they are really 2x4's.  Or 2x6's. 
Get some that are at least 1/4&quot; thick.  Take them to a weldor and
pay him to cut the steel C-sections into four pieces, two of them
about two feet long, two of them about 18&quot;.  Have him weld the
four pieces into a rectangle with the flat side of the C-section
toward the middle.  Talk him into adding gussets at the corners. 
You now have a clamping frame.

Pretend your clamping frame is a little doorway.  Sit it on the
floor and proceed exactly as before, except you may wish to use
pieces of pipe between the jack and the top of the frame instead
of Douglas fir.

Such a frame will handle about 90% of your hydraulic press chores
and when not in use it's easy to store.  If the welding is a
problem you can assemble the thing with bolts but you really
should ream the holes and use Grade 8 or better hardware.  And
you'll have to do a lot more cutting and fitting.  Of course, a
bolt-together frame can be unbolted for storage.

                         Concrete Press

If all of this sounds too exotic, you can still come up with a
pretty good press using nothing more than a hunk of sidewalk. 
Your front porch will work or mebbe the basement floor; any good
hunk of concrete.

What you do is drill some holes in the concrete and install
expansion bolts that allows you to bolt things to the concrete. 
A 3/8&quot; bolt is about as small as you want to go; 1/2&quot; is better. 
Prowling around a hardware store will give you some idea as to
what's available.  

If you bolt down a piece of strap iron you can use it as an
anchor for a lever, or if the strap is wide enough, as the top of
a miniature doorway.  Or you can drill some angle iron and build
yourself a little press right there on the floor.

                           Sermonette

There's no substitute for having the right tools, but any tool
that accomplishes the job without damage to the part is the
'right' tool by definition.  Often times it takes longer to make
the tool than to do the job but if the part being installed is a
bearing race with an anticipated useful life of years, but only
minutes if done improperly, the time spent to do the job right is
always justified.

Of course, you can always just beat on the thing with a hammer:-)
