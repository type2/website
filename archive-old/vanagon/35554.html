&gt;I am wondering if there was a year after which the headgasket problem was no

&gt;longer a problem. Did VW ever fix this in any year.  Also I understand it is

&gt;more likely to find a standard Vanagon than an automatic one, is the ratio 2
&gt;to 
&gt;1 or better does anyone know?
&gt;
&gt;

2.1L have less problems than 1.9.  Improved coolant circualtion makes syetm
less susceptible to air/combustion gases in system causing problems.
 Corrosion and other issues really not resolved.  Very late Vanagons seem to
be mostly automatics.  4 speeds usually most common and desireable!  If not
to worried abut trailer towing,2.1 autos move along fine.  1.9l autos have
trouble reaching high speeds and taking hills.
