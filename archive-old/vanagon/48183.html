&gt;now that rumba's front end and engine are doing well, i'm concentrating on
&gt;the interior. i've had carpet before but know from experience it's going to

&gt;protect the floor that is relatively tough yet looks spiffy?

Really short carpet works well.  A friend of mine used that indoor/outdoor
carpet (black) that they sell at Home Depot.  Looks great and can be swept
for easy cleaning.  I found a good deal on a remnant of similar looking but
not all weather carpet, and it's worn pretty well in the bus for a few
years.  When I replace it, it will be with the stuff from Home Depot
(hopefully with a generous layer of sound insulation underneath!).
