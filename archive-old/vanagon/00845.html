Subject: Retrofit A/C to '87 Vanagon?
Date: Fri, 13 May 94 15:54:20 EDT

Hi Vanagon fans --

I'm about to purchase an '87 Vanagon Westfalia  with about 56K miles for        something over 10 grand. It's extremely clean, 4 spd, newly painted (something about some dings).

But no air. Is it possible/feasible/practical to retrofit A/C? Where?  Who?
How much? I'm going out West in July (I live near Detroit) so if neces-
sary I could stop off in El Paso or Barstow or Garden Grove or wherever.

Anybody know of any dealers who'll do this for less than two arms
and one leg?

Thanks
