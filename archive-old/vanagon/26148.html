Notice to All About Gas Heaters . . .

If you don't have a manual and aren't sure of what you are doing, please
don't attempt to troubleshoot or repair gas heaters . . .

These heaters are all over 20 years old and the combustion chambers all
outdated 10 years ago. Careless mechanics have turned many a 1973 THING into
a Bar-B-Q while attempting to fix a gas heater. Consider fitting a set of
heat excangers and tubes under the back seat like a 74, add a few cables and
you will always be warm.

The THING Rgistry has a reprint of the correct gas heater manual, with 4
pages of VW part numbers and illustrations for $8.00 plus postage.

We also have a color schematic in our Master Service Manual, but the Trim
Shop sells the schematic by itself.

Good Luck and, if it smells like gas, don't try to make it work !
