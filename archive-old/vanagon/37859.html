Subject: RE: Upgraded Alternators


&gt;Uh oh, I was waiting for someone to mention JC Whitney. :)
&gt;Unfortunately, they couldn't tell the difference between a Ford
&gt;alternator and a Chevy. Guess which one I got? I sent it back. 3 months
&gt;later, I got my alternator. It had a cracked casing. That made me even
&gt;happier. I sent it back. 3 months later, I got my alternator. It was
&gt;another Chevy. I called them up and asked them what was going on. The
&gt;Ford alternator had been discontinued. I was overjoyed. I sent them a
&gt;nice thank you note.

Oops, I was afraid of something like that. I've generally had good luck
with Whitney, but I've heard bad vibes from other customers. And now,
sounds like you've got good reason to complain, too.  That's why I said:

&gt;&gt; Their return policy is also excellent. Fortunately.   :-\
&gt;&gt; Save your receipt...


Sorry for the bum steer.
