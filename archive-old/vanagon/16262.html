Subject: Re: SW BC (W WA?) Pizza!!

&gt;Ok, I've heard from Harry Yates and Jesus Dizon about camping.  Good.
&gt;Camping sometime, someplace this summer we go, along with anyone else
&gt;interested!  Yippee!
&gt;
&gt;Pizza seems a little less difficult right now, at least until the snow
&gt;melt off the mountains a bit!  :-)   Harry suggested the 2nd week of May
&gt;for pizza.  Let's put faces to names and get all the area netters
&gt;together.  According to Joel's stats, we got 10 in BC ('fraid a lot of
&gt;these folks are on the Island), and 14 (count 'em!) in W Washington.
&gt;OK, maybe Seattle's a little far for pizza (maybe not...), but aren't
&gt;there people up B'ham way?  Island people: here's an excuse to take the
&gt;ferry!  :)
&gt;
&gt;Suggestions on a restaurant?  Exact date? Etc, etc?
&gt;
&gt;BTW, all who are interested, let me know where you live so we can try to
&gt;meet in a place that's reasonably central.

Pizza in Bellingham???

We're gonna' have to hunt to find a place who's featured topping isn't sprouts!

:-)

Seriously, as a college town, there must be at least one decent pizza joint
that hasn't been ground under by Dominos/Little Caesars.

One thought, do we want to coordinate this dinner with the folks on the
GNATT? They will be coming through Seattle on May 31 going to Victoria on
June 1.

Something to consider anyhow.

And as far as trips go, after next week (where I get to live in my bus for
a week at snowboard camp), I'm pretty much tied up 'till mid September.

An October trip up and out towards Bella Coola, stopping at the many
beautiful lakes &amp; rivers along the way might be fun. While I'm sure it's
developed a lot since I was last out that way ('81), there's probably still
a few spots wild enough to justify my having bought a Syncro.
