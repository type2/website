&gt; &gt; There have been a couple questions about optimal cruising speeds.  One
&gt; &gt; today said 65 mph for an 81 air cooled van.  Another Westy owner once
&gt; &gt; suggested 55 as optimal (for water cooled late 80's models).  I happened to
&gt; &gt; meet this guy while I was on a trip.  He claimed to have been a VW
&gt; &gt; mechanic.  My gas mileage soared!  But otherwise, at what point are you
&gt; &gt; being too hard on the van?  Under some circumstances 55 would be TOO slow
&gt; &gt; (in terms of traffic and conditions).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Any thoughts out there?  I, too, tend to try to drive my van gently.

&gt; We routinely push our 87GL Autoboxer down the intense Houston area
&gt; freeways at with a full load of pax, w/AC blazing Max Cold at 70MPH. As
&gt; well, we will drive 70 on trips.

Yeah, me too.  something to do with TX I guess.  I don't think running
wide open will hurt the engine if your oil and cooling  systems are OK. 
My 1.9 will do 83 on the flat with no head wind, but what I typically do
is get behind a truck, back off on the throtle and do 70 or so.  Lucky
to get 20 mpg tho...
