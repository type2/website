Hi Y'all,
I just received a small catalogue from Kaylor Energy Products. It 
pictures a VW bug with the electric motor installed and mentions VW buses 
as candidates also.  It's a pretty crude little catalogue, probably done 
on a home PC, but gives some question/answer dialogue as well as a price 
list.  From what I can figure from this, you can hook the motor right up 
to the VW transaxle, and  &quot;retain the original VW flywheel and clutch 
assembly. This provides smooth gear shifting, excellent control at low 
speed, and operating safety.&quot;   Regenerative braking (charges batteries 
when braking) is available.  There are kits - the K-VETA (Kaylor Very 
Easy to Assemble) for $4500-$5000, and a 10hp gas engine to help on long 
trips.  Batteries not included... I think you need 20 (max) for a bus, at 
about $50, = $1000. Fiberglass bodies are available from $5k-11k, and a 
complete car (&quot;Danish Kewet El Jet&quot; - 48 DVC, 40 mi. at 40 mph) for 16k.

They don't accept credit cards, but do accept checks.  For &quot;fastest 
processing, send certified checks, cashiers checks, or money orders. You 
may also bring cash or gold coin.&quot;  Hmmmm.

Catalogue: (800) KAYLOR-K
