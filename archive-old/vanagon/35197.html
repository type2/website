&gt; 
&gt; Well, have you decided?  Or is it gnawing at you like starving rodent?
&gt; 

Yeah, along with the festering starving rodent, there's also a colony of
ants eating at my skin too. ;)  I'm going to call him today to see if
he still has it.  If he does, I'll ask him if he'll take a $200 holding
deposit and try to scrounge up the cash by Saturday.

Agonizingly yours,

Steven    ;)
