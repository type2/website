Subject: Re: Best Value Auto Clubs?

Ivan,

&gt; Still planning our trip from New Mexico to California and I'm wondering
&gt; what opinions ya'll may have on auto clubs like AAA?   

I happen to like AAA Plus.  I think it's near $70 a year now with the 
Plus option.  100-mile towing, locksmith services, a couple of 
gallons of gas if you run out, extrication (for those without Syncros 
:-), free maps, travel guides, camp books, discounts at lots of 
places, free traveler's checks, offices all over in US and CDN, etc.

It's worth it for me.  And no, I did not answer all &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; to 
the &quot;should you own a VW bus quiz.&quot;  :-)  In fact, I found the tranny 
fill plug yesterday, bought the 17mm bolt and 2 nuts to make the 
removal tool, and want to do the flush thing.  Now to hose it down 
with Liquid Wrench and wait...
