Yep - this is a tool you should not be without - it's heavy as all get out, 
but you can't budge these castle nuts any other safe way.  You'll find it 
even works on loose wheels - I dismantled a T1 axle last weekend that was 
torched off the donor car - no brakes, no frame to assist with holding the 
axle tubes - worked like a charm (and very satisfying to beat up on for 
stress reliever!)
