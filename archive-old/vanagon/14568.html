Subject: Re: Vacuum (Leak) Test

Actually, I've used the reverse of this method with success - take a water 
hose and run a slow stream on the areas mentioned (cool engine) and if it 
sputters and runs roughly, you've found your leak.

&gt;&gt; Yes: take a spray can of volatile ignition starter and spray around the
&gt;&gt; manifold, carb intake, plugs etc....if the engine races you have found

&gt;And if it sparks and blows your head off, you won't care about the leak 
&gt;anyway...
