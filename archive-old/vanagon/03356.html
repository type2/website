Vanagon Passat??? Sounds like some &quot;badge&quot; re-engineering...sort of
what is going around my neck of the woods...the local VW &quot;cool&quot;
motorheads round these parts (read the 18 to 22 get rubber in
all gears...take off all of your muffler types) have been ordering
the &quot;Rallye Golf&quot; badges for the back of their GTIs...Golf GLs (gak)..
and there's even one dweeb with a Rally Golf badge on the back of
a....&lt;puke&gt; Fox!!!

I guess Detroit is right...the proper stickers/decals/badges
make a car COOOOoooooL!

But for us &quot;mature&quot; VW types...badges??? We need no steeenkin' badges!
