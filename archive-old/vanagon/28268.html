&gt;I like like to be warm and snug as much as the next person, and I'm the 
&gt;first to admit that the camper can get a might chilly when it's well 
&gt;below freezing, but I have one major concern with this packing-all-the-
&gt;interior-spaces-with-expanding-foam approach:
&gt;
&gt;RUST.

&gt;Rusting, not tanning...

   Right now I happen to live in southern southern MD which has a fairly
moderate climate.  Last year we had one snow day and it all melted by the
next morning.  No salt, not even snow plows.  I'm originally from MN,
however, and I KNOW what cold is.  -25 air temp, -70 wind chill?  No
problem, let's play hockey.

   Anyway, what I used to do in my cars (I didn't have a bus then) is to
pack the doors with polyester stuffing (pillow stuffing).  This stuff
doesn't mind getting wet and helps keep the noise level down in addition to
being good insulation.  Plus it's cheaper than dirt.  I've also used
Owens-Corning pink insulation in my doors but the polyester stuff is a lot
friendlier to your body.  The expanding foam stuff works great on rust
holes, though!  Anyway, stuff the door full of polyfill and use a layer of
heavy-gauge plastic as a vapor barrier and you're set.

  Oh yeah, I forgot.  I also use this stuff for speaker enclosures.  It
kills that &quot;boomy&quot; sound you get out of a door or cabinet.  It eliminates a
lot of midrange resonance, too.  Try it.  If you don't notice a sound/heat
improvement within 30 days, delete this message.

Bob.
