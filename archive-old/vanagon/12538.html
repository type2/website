Subject: RE: 911 motor in a VW transporter

Shoot me.  I should be proclaiming, in connection with the subject, that the
2.2 liter carburetted six, nominally 125hp, that was the first six I used
in the Vanagon, is for sale.  Runs cool, good oil pressure, five cylinders
have compression in high 130s, last one 125.  30 days no questions guarantee.
Buyer pays shipping unless I deliver it within 150 miles of NYC.  $1500.
