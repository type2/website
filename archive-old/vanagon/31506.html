&gt; Ok, the bulb behind the speedometer in the dash of my '75Westy

&gt; It looks like a major job, pulling the instrument panel and opening it
&gt; just to get at the bulb.  Two questions:

I seem to remember the Bently saying that you don't need to pull the 
dash.  Just reach up under and pull the bulb out.

&gt; 1.  what are the specs for the bulb, and can I replace it with
&gt; a common bulb found at Canadian Tire or any auto supply store, or must I
&gt; go to the dealer?

I go to the junk yard and take all I want. I think they're $1 each if you 
buy them at a store.
