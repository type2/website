In the words of John Muir: do it yourself.  Or have someone who you know
knows what their doing build it.

You don't say what kind of engine you have.  If it's an air cooled then
there is many reputable possibilities.  Scat Performance, Stephens
Machining are just two that have been around for 15 or so years.  Or the
ultimate, buy a factory remanufactored short block from one of the dealers
that discount.  It may cost more but it will be done right.

&gt;I've started investigating engine places, and I haven't found too many that
&gt;consistently get good reviews.
&gt;
&gt;Places I've looked into:
&gt;
&gt;GEX:                    Consistently negative reviews(cheap prices)
&gt;Bernie Bergmann:        Good engines, bad service (high prices)
&gt;MOFOCO:                 Consensus says stay away from these (mid prices)
&gt;Strictly Foreign:       Heard nothing about these guys on the list,
&gt;                        knowledgable on the phone.  Don't like Bernie
&gt;                        engines (sloppy), says GEX
&gt;                        not bad, but employees paid by the piece (prices mid)
&gt;
&gt;Has anyone had an engine built that they were happy with?  From whom?
&gt;
&gt;I can put the reviews for the various places on a web page if there is
&gt;interest.

&gt;couple
&gt;hundred miles, and #3 is 30psi
