Subject: Looking for MIrrors

I'm gonna try some Mid-Winter improvements on MY THING.

Anyone got a pair of mirrors (left &amp; right) that are in &quot;decent&quot;
condition and can be acquired for a cheap price?

I'm sending for the door-hinge mounts and would liek to set up the
mounts, mirrors, painting and all that stuff in one process, if posible.

While I'm not very well versed in this stuff yet, seems I remember
hearing that mirrors from several years' bus will fit nicely.

regards,
