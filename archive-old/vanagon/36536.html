&gt;Howdy,
&gt;Does anybody know of a great place to mount the oil temp sending unit 
&gt; on a Type IV? With my upright motors I would mount them in the drain 
&gt; plate or tee off the pressure sending unit hole. I don't want to tee 
&gt; off the pressure unit because I would need to modify the tin and I 
&gt; don't think that it is the most accurate place. Could I drill a hole 
&gt; in the sump(?) plate on the bottom- the one right beneath the oil 
&gt; tube- or is there a better location.
&gt;
&gt;TIA 

VDO used to make an adapter plate that replaced the 2 hole metal plate on the
bottom of the crankcase.  Another option is to replace the oil filter bypass
with a direct fit sensor that VDO also makes.  On Vanagons, I've driiled and
threaded the releif valve plug and screwed the sensor into it directly.  All
these options work great.

Dennis.
