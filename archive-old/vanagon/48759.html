Subject: Michelin 205/70 reinforced MXT tire report

We just returned from 6.5K mile trip from NC to Glacier Park, MT with a new
set of Michelin MXT 205/70 x 14 reinforced tires on our heavily loaded '86
Westi.  IMHO the MXT's are superior tires to the 202/70 reinforced MXL's
and 195/75 load range C XCH4's I had previously.  We found the MXT's to be
more stable under wind and cornering conditions and seemed to have better
dry grip than previous tires.  I also feel these give better grip in the
wet than the old MXL's but I we haven't encountered much rain yet.  At
speed they are a very comfortable tire to drive with no obtrusive
characteristics.  Turn-in is much more crisp than the XCH4's.

I have been very satisfied with these tires so far and I believe these are
probably the most appropriate standard size available tire for the Vanagon.

These were purchased locally from a NTW store for aproximately $110 each
(inclun ding installation, lifetime balance, rotation, and tax).  It took
them about 4 days to order and receive the tires.  Service at NTW was quite
good overall.  Some other Michelin &quot;dealers&quot; couldn't (or wouldn't) even
give me a price quote!

The MXT's have a similar tread patern to the Michelin MXV4's and have a
load rating of 1709 lbs at 50 psi. Tread wear rating is 280, traction is A,
and temperature is B.  Michelin MXL's have a lower load rating of
approximatel 1500 lbs.

Note:  I am in no way associated with the Michelin Company.  The above is
just my personal opinion.
