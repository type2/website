Subject: Re: 82 Vanagon Exhaust parts ? 

Hi:

You might try German Auto Salvage Inc. in Berkeley 510-525-6000.

I was in 2 days ago looking for a left-side exhaust manifold for
my '81 California van and the guy came back with the combined
manifold/heat box for a non-Cal model.  Since they have that bit,
they might have the x-over pipe and EGR that goes with it.

&gt; I have an 82' Vanagon (2.0L, aircld, feul-inj), non-California exhaust

&gt; have any leads on persons or parts shops from whom I could get (trade,
&gt; purchase, etc.) these parts ?
&gt; 
&gt; I need:
&gt; 
&gt; 1) EGR filter unit
&gt; 
&gt; 2) Cross-Over pipe
&gt; 
&gt; or worse comes to worse, I'd consider purchasing the complete (no holes)
&gt; exhaust system (EGR, Cross-Over, Catalytic Converter, Muffler, etc.).
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks, Chris
