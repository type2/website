Subject: free offer: front westy table &lt;incomplete&gt;

Steven J. Hughes was writing about his failure to find a front table.
I have a spare front table leg and base for the table top that I came across
in my travels. Passing the Kharma baton, I am offering the thing to anyone
who really can use it for the cost of shipping.

It is proper for my '83 westy so its up to you to figure out if its right
for you. The thing has no table top per se, nor does it have the securing
knobs. I am tired of draggin it to swap after swap without having anyone
even knowing what it is. I ended up paying WAY too much for mine &lt;complete&gt;
at last years VW Classic. I just wanted to be done with the hunt for a
complete one.

Email me privately and I'll hook you up!
