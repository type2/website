Subject: Re: Metric Cubic Measurements of '84 Westy

Tom - 
	The dimensions are in the glossy sales room brochure I have in my file
at home. I will try to remember to send the full dimension and weight info
to you later this PM - prompt me if I fail and you still need it.

&gt; Listees,
&gt; 
&gt; I've been quoted $60 US per cubic metre to transport an '84 Westy by
&gt; freighter. This week,  I'm separated from both my Westy and my Bentley
&gt; manual. Can anyone figure the dimension of a Westy from the bottom of the
&gt; tires to the top of the camper top?
