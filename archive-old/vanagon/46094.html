Subject: Diesel cooling woes

I posted some questions a couple of weeks ago concerning my diesel 
westy's cooling troubles.  I have some follow up questions I hope someone 
can enlighten me on.
I finally received my replacemnet tank this morning.  I installed a new 
thermostat and the tank and filled it up.It didn't take as much as I 
thought (_at_3 gals.), but that may be because I didn't get all the old 
stuff out.  After some coaxing, it started up.  I added more coolant as 
necessary. 
I then parked it on the incline in my driveway (_at_ 35 degree angle) and 
opened the bleeder valve.  Nothing came out. No coolant no air nothing.  
I ran to the store with it and when I got there  I checked the level of 
the tank- almost empty.  i tried to open the cap, but the pressure was 
too much. Aftere cooling, I added some more coolant and headed the 1 mile 
home.  when I got there I attempted to bleed it again, this time to more 
success.  Coolant spurted out intermitantly with air. I let it run and 
checked the level again.  It was down again, so I turned off the engine 
so I could add coolant.  When I opened the cap, the pressure forced the 
tank to fill. I started the van again, but this time no flow from the 
bleeder valve again.
My questions are, what am I doing wrong?  Does it sound as I have some 
blockage somewhere?  My last tank blew from the pressure, and Im 
concerned about this happening again.  I need some advice.  Any ideas?  
Im about to succumb and bring it to a mechanic.  Anyone know of any good 
ones in the Cape Cod area (Orleans)?
Thanks,
Paul Cronin
