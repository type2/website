Subject: Re: Gerry Skerbitz's fuel pump problems

  Well, I finally got around to actually testing the results of my fuel tank
swap.  It's not good.  I was hoping to see some improvement, but there was
none.  I still have bubbles in the fuel.
Here are the details.
  With the input to the fuel pump in a glass jar of gas (no filter on the
source side of the pump) I put the return line from the pressure regulator in
a container of gas and ran the fuel pump.  bubbles appeared in the container. 
  So instead of using the return line, I put the line that goes to the T
connector (with the bleeder in it) in fuel.  This time, there were no bubbles. 
However, if I put some back pressure on the pump by pinching the hose, bubbles
began appearing.
  Before you blame my &quot;new&quot; Bosch fuel pump, I had bubbles in the return line
when I left Sacramento.  

  One theory is that I need stiffer fuel line from the pump to the engine?  I
have no idea. I'm stumped.

Help!

P.S.  My voltage stabilizer went again.  :-(  What makes it go?
