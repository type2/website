&gt;    Thanx for all those responses to my question about the fuel for a 73 bus.
&gt;I guess the bottom line is I can use unleaded, but preferably 91 octane or
&gt;more (Iguess that would make it premium). Maybe toss in a tankful of leaded

uhhhhh ... ok, now remember that the Powers That Be changed the octane ratings
sometime in the past. so what used to be 91 octane in 1973 is now 87 octane
in 1995. so you have to read the owners manual to see if it says
91 RON octane. if so, that's the new 87 (RON+???)/2 octane at the pump.

but there are folks who say that running Premium (92 or 93 Today Octane)
is better (here we go again! :) ...

&gt;  By the way: you guys are a REALLY active mailgroup...how do you manage to
&gt;read all these messages every day ? Or are all of you full time computer
&gt;eggheads ? any suggestions ??

actually, there are only three people on this list ... the rest of us are
computer simulation programs ... :)
