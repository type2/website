Subject: Rainy Day Blues, HELP!

Hey guys!  I need help!  My '85 GL acts up every time it rains.  When you go
out in the morning after an evening rain it either will not start or starts
but spits and sputters and won't move for a few minutes.  This morning (after
heavy thunderstorms last night) my wife started it up and got two blacks from
home when it started doing its thing.  This time, however, it did not quit.
 I just spent an hour trying to get it to go, with no luck.  It will idle
very roughly, but when you give it gas you can here what sounds like a
flapper valve shutting and it chokes.  Any ideas?

My wife is getting fed up and if I don't solve this problem soon Big Blue may
have to go.  Hate to see that happen.  Thanks.
