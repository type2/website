&gt; Hi!

&gt; I'm Kathy Myers.

&gt; I have a newly &quot;resto-customized&quot; '68 midnight pearl purple and
&gt; midnight pearl turquoise bus (ultra shiny -  full blown urathane race
&gt; car paint with 7 coats of clear) and my signifcant other has an emerald
&gt; green '69 squareback.  (very clean body - but - painted with totally
&gt; flat - Tru-Value Hardware forest green - spary cans! :-) )
&gt;
&gt; Does it go without saying, that we have a difference of opinion when it
&gt; comes to spending big bucks on restorations? :-)

Hey, no problem here, and I've been noted (to a few on this list at least)
as something of a pervert as far as stock/resto goes... My brother-in-law
had a 67 deluxe with a &quot;paint job&quot; that looked like silver, tar-based
stucco, for lack of a better term.  Had depth to it, too!  Probably weighed
in with an extra 10 pounds as a result, but it had NO RUST, brothers and
sisters!  But alas, some cute little 19-year old clobbered it one night
with a FULL-SIZED Chevy sedan (may it rust in piece).

Seriously, though, that night was wierd.  I had just finished painting and
detailing a 73 Datsun pickup that I was trying to sell, and my
brother-in-law asked if he could borrow it that night, cause his brakes
were pulling in the bus.  I said &quot;no&quot;.  About 4 hours later the phone
rings, it's a policeman telling me he's been in an accident, and we need to
come down and pick him up.  I was feeling totally sh*tty all the way there,
till I saw the van... if he'd been there in the Datsun, he'd not be here
today.  Chevy ran a red, hit him just behind the driver's door, caved in
the side of the van and pushed him diagonally across the street into a
telephone pole.  Nice pole-shaped crease in front of van, no windshields or
side driver's door window.  Brother-in-law has a cut and punctured eardrum
from hitting the metal divider in the center of the side window, but
recovered nicely.

This is my favorite brother-in-law (and with 4 sisters and a wife, I've
collected a few over the years!) so I was glad in retrospect that he wasn't
in that tinny Datsun at about Chevy grille level!

Safety in an old bus is a big issue.  I used to figure that the view
protected bus drivers quite a bit because they could avoid accidents better
than most.  These days, there's an additional advantage in that newer cars
don't have the sheet metal gauge that the old buses have.  I want myself
and all you good people to have long, productive, VW bus-filled lives.  So,
as the guy on Hill Street Blues used to say:  &quot;Hey hey HEY!  let's be
careful out there!&quot;
