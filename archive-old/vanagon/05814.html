now, the sharper and more sober of you may have noticed that i stuck a new
category into the eurovan folks. just in case one of them winnebago folks
show up. well, it might happen! :)  do the eurovan folks want to separate
the pop-top weekenders from the 'real' camper that came out in 95? or just
keep lumping them together? does anybody care? :)

'Unknown's cheerfully changed to Wanabus or even Realbus. whatever.
