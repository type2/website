Subject: Re: Canadian Parts for 73 Bus?

&gt;Can anyone recommend a reasonable sorce of parts in or near
&gt;Ottawa/Ontario/Canada?
&gt;
Talk directly to Frank Condelli, in your area, Email is  
ad793_at_freenet_dot_carleton_dot_ca. He has a vanagon with new exhaust stuff , but any 
VW supplier usually covers several years worth of vehicles.
 I noticed 3 different porsche 914 stainless steel heat exchangers for sale 
_at_ about $US230 in an Automotion catalogue I have. The 914 engine is very 
very similiar to yours, 4 cyl, 1.7,1.8,2.0 litre, exhaust ports/bolts point 
towards the ground. The outlet flanges looked like those on my old '72 
Westy. Maybe a bolt-in option? Don't forget your control flap boxes, again 
the 914 ones 'look' identical, and would certainly fit the 914 exchangers, 
you only need  a plastic/metal hose on the other side. A pair of SS xchgrs + 
Bursch muffler were $US700, this muffler is not cheap!!. Before you pay 
similiar $$ for non stainless try to find out if Automotions fit, their 
1-800 # works in Canada, bonus! Email me if you want it, it's _at_ home.
        About the torsion bar boxes, replace the front suspension completely 
if you can get a GOOD junker, it just unbolts. Keep everything from the ball 
joints out from your bus, saves bleeding the brakes (boy, is he lazy), 
unless your rotors etc. are shot.  Rust is insidious, you can get 
replacement metal patch pieces, they always scared me, plus they and the 
welding are going to run you close to a good used replacement. Check the VW 
rags for used parts suppliers also. The next thing to go on the torsion 
tubes will be the pivot mount for the steering, a notorious rust-out spot, 
especially if the vehicle has been standing for some time. Parking in grassy 
areas longterm really speeds this up, lots of moisture and abundant oxygen 
to feed the rust demons! good luck, tjs   
        ps  buy a gal. jug of WD40! it will soon become your only friend, 
that ...plus a big hammer, propane torch to warm things, wire brush,12,13, 
17 and 19 mm wrenches(lifetime warranty type), nut cracker, stud extractor, 
beer, sedatives.  I could go on..
and finally....
  DON'T DON'T DON'T strip the bolt threads in the aluminium cylinder heads, 
VW dealers have an 'one-end oversized' set that may get you out of trouble 
if you didn't do too too much damage. Don't reuse any of the 8 studs if you 
get them/some out, they will be old and brittle and rusty and always break 
as you try to get rid of that last little exhaust leak when you have 'just 
about finished'. Don't reuse those copper oval seals either, and don't just 
leave them out! I've spent way too many hours doing these repairs on several 
older extra rusty Canadian buses. I don't think those salt-free list members 
South o' the border realize how lucky they really are. bye
