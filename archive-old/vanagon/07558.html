Subject: in defense of grits! 




&gt;
&gt;   Hmmm.
&gt;
&gt;   In this part of the VWorld, grits are spread on the road by the 
&gt;   County Council to stop you from skidding on ice...

in December of '82, having only lived in the States for 2.5 years, we decided
to make our first venture into the Southern U.S. (Remember the Penn State
championship game against Georgia?).  4 of us drove in a diesel rabbit for
1,250 miles non-stop except for diesel and bio-necessities, and the occasional
food stops...  The 'grits' they served did taste like something we could
use for winter roads in PA.  Maybe you're not that far off... (or maybe it was
just that my tongue felt like the asphalt on the road at the time)...

Anyways, New Orleans and the game quickly made up for the travel horrors.
We had a great time...

BTW, the diesel rabbit got an average of 49 mpg on that trip, which really
earned my respect (at the time the advertised mpg values were too optimistic;
I believe the diesel rabbit was rated at 52 mpg or something like that). It's
range on a full tank was well over 450 miles...
