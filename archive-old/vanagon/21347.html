Subject: Re: Front wheel bearings (rabbits)

&gt;From: Jack Reed &lt;jackr_at_fortnet_dot_org&gt;

&gt; Were you able to get a look at the contraption they used?  I've never 
&gt; seen one and the picture in the &quot;Recycled Bugs&quot; catalog leaves alot to 
&gt; the imagination.  A description of the device might be enough for me to 
&gt; fab something up for the next go-round of bearings.

It is basically a long threaded shaft that uses several thick large washers
and nuts.  They are used to push/pull the bearing and wheel hub.  You supply
the power.  An impact wrench was used to speed it up.  I have read of others
on the vw newsgroup that used the tool.  If you are doing it by wrench it
requires a lot of muscle.

Of course, the easiest way to replace bearings is to get an entire wheel
assembly from junked rabbits and use those.  Just make sure that the ones
you get feel smooth running.  I had to check several rabbits before finding
a good pair.  You can get your original assemblies pressed later and swap
them. 
   
&gt; I had already assumed that the wheel and the CV joint would need to be 
&gt; pulled so I'm not surprised that it took them 45 minutes/side.

Yes, the wheel and CV joint is pulled.  The brake caliper is unbolted and
the ball joint is removed from the wheel assembly.  This is done to remove
the outer CV joint and to allow the threaded shaft to go through the opening.
