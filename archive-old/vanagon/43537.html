Subject: 86 head retorquing?

Hi All:
I was having a conversation with a friend and we were discussing if it is
advisable to retorque the heads on a wasserboxer 2.1. I have heard that it
is not necessary, like it is on a bug engine, but considering the head
gasket problems these engines have I can't see what it would hurt. I thought
maybe someone might have some thoughts on this subject. One other thing. Has
anyone ever had a leaking head gasket bad enough so the water fills up the
overflow thank like they do, and be able to seal it back up by just
retorquing the head?

Thanks a Lot
