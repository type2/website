Hi, list.  I've seen a few questions if theyre alive on the list recently.  I
talked to Bill this AM, and he said he was having phone problems.  It's not
totally fixed yet, but they are working on it.  I to have had trouble getting
thru in the last couple of days.  I know they were moving the warehouse this
last weekend as well.  

I told him to shoot a message to us, not sure if he can just yet, but they be
alive.
