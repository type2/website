Maybe it was the word volatile that tripped you up. Seriously there is
engine starter fluid in a spray can that is *volatile* but not necessarily
explosive. This is ideal for finding leaks in manifolds especially with FI
systems. The technique was used by both VW mechanics in the bay area when
we had the engine checked out and I have also used it. I would not
recommend liberal doses nor spraying on the exhaust manifold. Your two
other options are: a) using a long hose and &quot;listening&quot; for leaks as you pass
the hose around the  engine compartment (I also use this to tune dual
carbs by listenting to the pitch of each carb). The hose isolates your ear
from other engine noise; b) random tightening down and replacement of
hoses - good luck - DC
