So Matt Bushore says:
&gt; If you replaced the pads, and still have a bad pedal,
&gt; I would second the guess that your rears need adjusted.

Thanks Matt and Alistair on that one.
&gt; 
&gt; I know that mine do.  If you have a pair of very large
&gt; channel locks, pushing the piston back into the caliper
&gt; shouldn't be very hard.  Just clamp on and squeeze.  
&gt; Use the old pad to protect the piston from damage.

No got channel locks.  :(  Just a the BIG screwdriver (one of the
ten essentials ;) ) and open the bleeder valve a little.  It
was a bear with that too.

&gt; Also make sure that the mounting pins and all other sliding
&gt; points are rust free/clean and to put anti seize on them so
&gt; that everything keeps moving as needed.  This will help
&gt; the pads to wear a bit more evenly.  If the caliper can't float
&gt; for some reason, you usually end up with one pad worn to the metal,
&gt; and other looking brand new.
I confess, I didn't clean the pins, but I've never cleaned them in
the past on other cars.  Didn't make much difference.  VW sez to
replace one of the guide pin holds, I didn't see any reason to.
Maybe next time.

&gt; It has been recommended to replace all of the brake fluid when doing
&gt; a brake job.  I don't do it, but them I'm lazy, and likely won't sue myself
&gt; for my own negligence.  Its to keep water and contaminents from accumulating
&gt; in proportioning valves and the calipers where they can greatly accellerate wear.

Yeah, that's my mentality on this too.  I should do it, but I don't.  Well
I probably will do this one, cause I plan to keep the beast a loooong time.
