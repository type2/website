Subject: 86 Vanagon

Hi folks,
I'm a new VW owner and new to the list, although I'm not so new to working
on cars. I'm kind of an RX-7 fanatic. I have several questions about my new
Vanagon that I thought I'd throw out for anyone interested in responding.
Bear with me, I have a newfound curiousity of the realm of Vanagon...

I paid $1000 for this '86 GL with 98k miles. It's a 4 speed w/ great
interior. Exterior has a few dings but overall is in great shape. Paint is
nice, and its from CA so no rust whatsoever. Was this a good deal? (I have
a feeling it was.)

I need new tires. I usually like to go a couple sizes wider than specified.
Has anyone put 205s on the original 14&quot; wheels? Is this advisable? I also
understand that the heavy-duty tires that were originally made by Michelin
and are no longer available. My tire guy suggested Toyo 800+ and suggested
that I rotate and align regularly. Has anyone had any good/bad experience
with these or other tires?

The engine seems to 'miss' quite a bit, and visibly shake when revved. Is
there anything other than the obvious (wires, plugs, rotor, cap) that I
should be aware of in solving this?

The A/C is not working. The compressor does not engage when unit is turned
on. Fuse is OK. Is there a pressure switch and the unit just needs to be
charged?

The shifter seems stiff, should the linkage be lubricated? With what? Where?

I was disappointed to find that my rear seat do not fold down to make a
bed. Which models included those seats, and the swivel drivers seats? Is it
hard to find these in good condition? How much could one expect to pay for
them? Are they a direct replacement?

How difficult would it be to add Westy options such as fridge or stove to
my Vanagon?

Well, thats quite enough for now. TIA to everyone.
