Subject: Re:  Gas Heat in a Splittie....

c_dbowen_at_qualcomm_dot_com asks where he might acquire a BA-6 gas heater and if
installation is practical.

Acquistion:

Try your pick n' pull areas.  Look for a late model bay window or early 
vanagon.  I'm not sure when the first year was for this model (anyone?)
Also there are two heater gurus: Art Murvis (Sp ?) in N.J. and J.B. Heater
service in Colorado.  (This is the more $ route.) Check the archives of
this list for more information on these guys.  

Practicality.

If you live in florida, or S. Cal. - not very practical.  I use mine daily
now (up here in NE).  Yesterday morn 10C, Van 70C! :^)  I'm amazed at the
&quot;fit&quot; of the BA-6 under the bus and the degree to which it functions.
