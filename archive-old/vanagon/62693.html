&lt;&lt; Although initially it sounds great, I would be greatly concerned about
crash
 safety using fibergalss parts. VW designed and crash tested our trusty
 vehicles with steel panels, not fiberglass.
 
 While certainly there are carbonfiber auto componants that rival or exceed
 the capabilities of steel, and certain car companies have produced and crash
 tested composites for body panel usage, backyard manufacture of body panels
 would be a highly-risky business to be in.  &gt;&gt;

I agree also, but for a guality and duribility standpoint. 
Geez, think about it... if your Vanagon is so badly rusted that you have to
have large fiberglass (or metal, for that point) replacement panels grafted
on.....
Then it's prolly about time to get another Vanagon.....
