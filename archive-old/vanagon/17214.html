Well before knocking them totally, I was wrong in
saying I didn't like all Pirelli, actually I ran
210P winters on the Corrado with great results.
Sorry, I forgot about winter tires totally.
As to Michelin performance tires the H20 FAQ and
I agree with someones statement, utter crap on the
wet, this includes the MXX and all iterations of the
MXV used often on Accords.  However for FWD and 4WD
on the Quantum I loved the XGT H4, agressive all
season and held like a bear, alas not available in
50 series sizes for the Corrado but H rated and would
probably fit a Van but the standard question, is that
H rated sidewall as stiff as a C load range tire?
Certainly they will only carry a 35 psi max inflation
and lower load rating, though it seems it was higher
than normal, being an 88H instead of 85H maybe.  A lot
of Z rated stuff has 45 psi inflation limit but I don't
think we're going to quite need that.  On the Corrado
I'm currently using a very nice Sumitomo HTR4, the only
thing available in a M+S 195/50 15 and only H rated, had
a 40,000 mile treadwear warranty too.  I bought the car
with M+S Z rated Toyo Proxes that only lasted 15,000
miles (typical on a Corrado I guess) the Sumitomo's are
doing very nicely at 8000 miles look new, Sumitomo is the
current owner of Dunlop and maybe General.  Good luck
with tires everyone.
