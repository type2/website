Subject: '81 versus '83 wasserboxer
Date: Mon, 23 Dec 1996 10:41:42 -0500

I really couldn't wait to get the '81 sunroof with a/c and gas heater
running before I ask this question  :-)

As I won't be able to keep both the '81 (about to go through engine
rebuild) and my current '83 wasserboxer daily driver, I have a BIG decision
to make. Which one do I keep??

Any opinions on power, reliability, maintenance, etc (2.0L air-cooled vs.
1.9L wasserboxer)?

I have no experience thus far with the 2.0L air cooled. BTW, ain't no way
I'm getting rid of my 'new' '60 Westy!!

Thanks!

MERRY CHRISTMAS!!

tony
