Subject: 1985 Compressor Repair

Hello everyone,

        i got a freon recharge the other day and it has been diagnosed that
my compressor has a bad seal, when the compressor &quot;clutch&quot; engaged for the
brief while that it did, i could see bubbling brown lubricant near the
pully-side of the compressor.  Also a valve seems to be bad, but i can fix
that..

My question is, is there anyway that i could take the compressor out,
unscrew a few screws and slap a new seal in there, and if i could not
obtain/afford a new seal, maybe i could get a sheet of the seal material,
and use the old one as a template.  I have a bentley, are there any special
manuals out there that i could need?  Any advice would be greatly
appreciated (or warmly received, as its pretty hot in the van as it is  :) )
