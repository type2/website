Subject: Any listmembers near Renton, WA

 &gt;&gt;   Hello,  I'm interested in a syncro in Renton but I'm in CA.  If I could
somehow entice someone into checking it out for me.  Beer $$ !! Pretty
 please. &lt;&lt;

 IF I don't have to work tomorrow and IF I can find the place I can check it
out for you.  I've got a video camera - d'you want some footage on it?

 Remember, this offer is good one day only, I'm going camping tomorrow night.
