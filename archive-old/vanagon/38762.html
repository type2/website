Subject: 86 vanagon high idle

   This is obviously a problem with alot of Vanagons. When the Temp
   goes down around 32 deg. or lower The cold idle in both my Vanagons
   goes up.

   At first starting out cold I would think that's OK. But after they
   warm up (temp. gauge up to almost normal) the idle continues to
   to stay high (2000 rpm in the 2 wheel). The colder it is the more
   the idle will creep up from 1000 rpm to 2000 rpm. Man is this killing
   my gas milage! The only fix I could find (for the 2 wheel drive)was to
   pinch off the idle stablizer valve. After I did that the only problem
   was, at cold startup It won't idle at all. Once warm It run better
   than any stock Vanagon. 

  I have done the following: replaced throttle position switch with
    up date. Check for the obvious vacuum leaks. Complete tune up
    check. Check for cloggs in preheating. What am I missing??? 
      Any Ideas???      ERic ZEno
