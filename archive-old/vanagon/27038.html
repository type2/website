Hey Martha, could you please post this to vanagon for me
please?


-----------------------

Saw a most interesting vehicle for sale today, a Mercedes 206D.
It looks like a long VW bay window, with a raised roof and funky
moldings. It *has* to be a converted VW, it looks way too similar.

Here is what the sign says:

1976 MBZ 206D
4 cyl. diesel
25 mpg, runs perfect
89,000 miles
$4,100
415.962.3914

a footnote on the sign says &quot;Parts? Noooooo problem&quot;

I forgot to look for rust, but heck, this is California. Inside
there appears to be a fridge, stove top, aircondition unit (as in
a unit you stick in your house), heating tower (a weird wire heater),
sunroof, table between 2 bench seats, cabinets. very inefficient
interior in short.

If you want to drive by, its permanent home is the parking lot at
Adobe, near Shoreline. Send me email if you want directions, and
apparently the owner has an Adobe phone number.

I plan on getting my camera working just to take a picture of this
thing, it trips me out seeing it everyday.
