&gt;&gt; Just found out that after 140k miles, my heads are leaking.   The VW

&gt;&gt; me $1250 to replace and have it machined( what the hell is that?)
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Help me!  I am not rich yet!

&gt;How bad are they leaking?  Check yourself, do not trust the dealer.
&gt;If it's minor seepage, you can you a product called BarsLeak to 
&gt;seal it up.  You just pour it in your expansion tank and run the
&gt;engine until the thermostat just starts to open.  This should take
&gt;care of any small leaks.

I personally would not reccomend pouring barsleak in your expansion tank.
My heads are leaking and i did that and it just collected on the bottom and
clogged my valve cap. i poured it out of the expansion tank and put in into
the main tank and my heads still leak, but not as bad, BUT the majority of
it could still be on the bottom on my main tank, i will stir it up soon and
run my engine for 15 min.

Just unscrew your main tank and pour it in, it's heavy so it will force out
coolant and sink to the bottom, stir and run your engine.
