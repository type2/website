Subject: going to buy a westy.

I just sold my 73 camper pop top.  It was wonderful, but I am now moving into
the big league.  I want to buy a 87-90 westy and probably not a synchro due
to $$$.
Any suggestions on what to look for when shopping.  
How are the Auto vs Manual trans?
Any big ticket Items that I should evaluate besides engine and trans?
Any advice would be appreciated?
Thanks Steve B.
