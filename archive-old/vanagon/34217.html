Subject: Little explosions
Date: Wed, 31 Jan 1996 18:06:38 GMT

My friend has a 90 Vanagon Westfalia.  He has been experiencing what he calls
&quot;small explosions&quot; coming from the rear end.  He thinks it is a blocked line
which caries gasoline vapors through the charcoal filter.  He has found that
these explosions do not occur when he leaves the gas cap off (he has it stuffed
with a rag).  He has Bentley but could not pinpoint exactly what he should be
doing to correct the problem.

Any suggestions appreciated, especially with specific reference to pages in
Bentley.
