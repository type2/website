Subject: OXS LED

Fellow Vanamaniacs,

  I have my OXS sensor LED on the '87 Syncro glowing at me now.  I know that
I need to take/have taken care of the OXS sensor, but $$$ says otherwise for
now.  I need to turn off the LED for now as I am concerned that another LED
will come on and I won't notice it..  I knew where the switch for this was on
the '80 Rabbit that I had a few years ago but not this and the Bentley that I
had went back to the library (it had a reserve on it).  Anyone know where it
is?  I'm also starting to get the ignition cut-out that was briefly discussed
a short while back, possible connection?


&quot;Help me Obi-wan Kanobie, you're my only hope!&quot;
