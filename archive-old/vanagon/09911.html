Subject: 1600cc Vanagon: Oh well...


	I'd like to thank Andy Erskine and MIke Catlin for their 
responses to my post looking for a 1600cc Vanagon engine case.

	The 1600cc engine, coded &quot;CT,&quot; was offered in Europe in the 
early 1980's as an &quot;economy&quot; engine. It shares most internal 
components with the Type I/II/III engine, but has a Type IV style 
cooling system to accomodate the Vanagon engine compartment. What 
makes the &quot;CT&quot; engine case unique is the cast-in provision for an oil 
filter.

	(Look in the Haynes manual for air-cooled Vanagons to see 
	what I'm talking about.)

	All I was looking for was a rebuildable engine case, as the 
crank, rods, pistons, cylinders, heads, etc. are readily available.	
My idea was to use the case to build an otherwise standard 
Beetle-style engine for my Beetle, with a unique oil filtration 
system.

	*Yes, I know that new Universal cases are easy to obtain!
	
	*Yes, I know there are entirely satisfactory ways to add
	oil filtration to Type I/II/III engines. (Gene Berg, etc.)

	Thanks to contacts supplied by Mike Catlin, I have indeed 
found sources for rebuildable &quot;CT&quot; engine cases in the UK. BUT- I 
probably won't be buying one.

	The problem is that the CT case has cast-in bosses for the 
Type 4-style fan housing. These would prohibit mounting the standard 
Beetle engine sheet metal. Probably not insurmountable, but not worth 
it to me.

	Anyway, thanks again to Andy and Mike for the information.

	Happy Motoring!

	'87 VW GTI
	'88 VW Vanagon
