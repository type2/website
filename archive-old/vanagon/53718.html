Subject: Kelly On Line

Recently Kelly Blue book went on line

www.kbb_dot_com

Their free service is simply incredible, they pegged the values of 
the '81 Westy, '85 GL, '90 Corrado (which I did much better on 
thankfully) as well as a number of others I've run right at what I 
would put at on the nose.  Two services one for what to pay from 
dealer (retail) the other for trade in value I'd put actual values 
between the two but in general they are on the money and are highly 
customizeable and know what should be on your '89 Syncro Deluxe 
Westy, etc and give a near correct market price for it.  Pretty neat, 
only go back to '75, and older values are a bit on the low side of 
what &quot;collectibility&quot; if it exists seems to dictate prices will be.  
You would be hard for instance to get them to say anything over $2500 
for any late Bus camper unlike the exhorbitant values requested by 
some list members occasionally.  Of course I have paid $3800 for a 
'77 and people have told me I did well.
