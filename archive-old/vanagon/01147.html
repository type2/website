Well... I thought that the relay would only close the
circuit between the battery and the solenoid when the
ignition switch was closed.  That is, if I turn the key to
&quot;on&quot; (not &quot;start&quot;), the solenoid didn't kick in, only when
the ignition switch was on &quot;start&quot;.  Thus it stands to
reason that when the switch returns to the &quot;on&quot; position
after I let go of it, it would break the circuit between
the solenoid and battery.  But what do I know, I'm a
software guy :-).

But this brings up my next question... when Muir talks about
this he says to connect the lead for the battery to the &quot;B&quot;
plug on his regulator (or &quot;B+&quot; sometimes).  Well I have a
'76 Bus so it has an alternator, and the regulator only has
D, DF, and D+ plugs (I think).  What's the equivalent?  I
assume what he wants is a hot lead from that battery that
has been regulated to 12V.
