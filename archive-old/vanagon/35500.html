&gt; It has disc brakes and an upright engine, but I believe it has the new larger
&gt; taillights.  Does all this add up?  I think the '71 had the small taillights 
&gt; and may not have come in orange.  Could an upright engine have been added to a
&gt; newer bus?  

'71  was the last year for the small taillights.
'72 had large taillights, low front turn signals
'73 -on had front turn signals above the headlights.

Orange sounds like a later [73ish] color.

&gt; By the way the engine doesn't run but is all there.  How is $200-$300 sound for
&gt; a excellent body with a dead? engine.  Oh yeah, the front window is badly 
Could be a keeper.
