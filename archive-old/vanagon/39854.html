Subject: repost:should I Buy a '73 for parts?


Sorry if this just got posted a while ago but I lost contact with the 
list some how.  I also remembered that the interiors will not be 
compatible.  mine is a sportsmobile and the other sounds like a 
standard.  Did '73s have the high backed seats?

here is the original incase it didn't make it to the list.

&gt; Hi all: I just got a tip on a cheep '73.  I called the owner and he 
&gt; dosn't think that there are any real problems with it accept for a gassy 
&gt; smell in the engine compartment and some collision damage to the nose. I 
&gt; have a '72 and it sure would be nice to have a spair engine and trans 
&gt; sitting around for when the need arises.  Not to mension a good set of 
&gt; tires (mine are dead), and a bunch of other parts.  Does any one know 
&gt; what will and won't be compatible?  I know the rear brakes wont but with 
&gt; that '74 axle beam up front all the front brakes and suspension should 
&gt; right? Probably along with the engine lid and lights.  What about the 
&gt; windshield and sliding doors?  If it helps any, my bus was made in 4-72 
&gt; and I think this one has the low turn signals.  Basically, I need to 
&gt; justify spending money I don't have.  The guy is asking $450 but there is 
&gt; always the haggle factor.  BTW, he seemed to be pretty insistant about 
&gt; the thing being a parts bus although supposidly it drives fine and only 
&gt; has the afformentioned problems.  Well see.  O, he also said he put on a 
&gt; new set of webber carbs a couple of years ago and the bus only has a 
&gt; total of 60,000 miles.  something could be a little fishy.  lemme know 
&gt; what you think.
&gt; thanks.
