Subject: 93 EV MV For Sale CHEAP!!!


Since November, the local VW dealer has had a 93 EV MultiVan on its lot. Its 
the twin to my MV (white, 55K miles, good shape, etc.).They had been asking 
$14k miles for it. I just looked in this morning's paper and they have 
dropped the price to $11,995. I would suspect that it could be had for at 
least $500 less than the asking price...

If you are interested it is at Pearson-Miller VW, Rt6, North Dartmouth, MA. 
(508) 999-4573.
