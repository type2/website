&gt;&gt;OK, I'm willing to write this one off as a learning experience.  But what 
&gt;do
&gt;&gt;you do?


Go back, tell him you've changed your mind, and want one more drive.  Many 
novice VW drivers often shift from first to reverse until they are used to 
the shift pattern you know.  Fourth to second coming off an expressway is 
also a problem sometimes.  Sometimes it's even hard to know when to shift 
up, the engine is so far away you can't really hear it properly. ;&gt;   I'd 
get the $100 back, no excuses from the weasel. The plane fare is gone, 
that's enough 'learning' for me.  Tim
