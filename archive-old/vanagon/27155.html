 Dave---

Saw your note---the box is the oil cooler.  Coolant does circulate through
it and hence could leak from it I suppose.  I don't know what they cost to
replace but it can be done...although it will require draining oil and
coolant to do so and it's a pain to get out [have done it].  

But BE CERTAIN that is the cause first.  On my 86 GL the oil cooler is right
under the waterpump which can drip onto it [and has].   My guess is
something else is more likely---waterpump, gasket, hose. The fact that the
drip is forming on the bottom suggests coolant is dripping onto it and
running to the bottom corner.  I'm certain waterpumps go far more often than
oil colers fail.  Someone told me that VW went to a different water pump
gasket a few years back.  I have replaced gaskets and waterpumps over the
years [leaks apppeared on the oil cooler as a symptom].

&gt;&gt; Problem Description:
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; My 1990 Vanagon has a very slow water leak that
&gt;&gt; appears to be coming from the the box(?) the oil
&gt;&gt; filter seals on. I have pulled the fan belt off
&gt;&gt; to check the water pump; bearings felt good, no
&gt;&gt; slop in shaft, and no bearing noise when running.
&gt;&gt; Also, I can't find any evidence of the leak coming
&gt;&gt; from the water pump. The engine leaks a drip or
&gt;&gt; two at a time when the engine is running, and drips
&gt;&gt; for a few hours afterwards, and then stops dripping.
&gt;&gt; It's probably only losing a couple oz.s of water per
&gt;&gt; running. 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; When I lay under the car and watch it, it looks like
&gt;&gt; the drip is forming at the bottom corner of the box
&gt;&gt; the oil filter is sealing on. 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Questions:
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; 1. Does this problem sound familiar?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; 2. What is this box the oil filter sits on? Is
&gt;&gt;    it removable?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; 3. How should/can this leak be fixed?
&gt;&gt;
