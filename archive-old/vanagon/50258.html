&gt;&gt;Might be worth a try to install a set of gas pressure shocks - I put

&gt;&gt;Bilsteins ~80k miles ago &amp; the bus is still riding over 1&quot; higher than 
&gt;&gt;stock
&gt;&gt;(raised it about 2&quot; initially - about the same as a Synchro);  the
&gt;&gt;pressurized gas acts as a spring, of course.

&gt;Simple yet effective! Very clever.  Does  Bilsteins have a direct
&gt;replacement for the Vanagon? You wouldn't have the part # handy?

Sorry - took a while to track down the invoice.  Fronts were #B46-0820,
rears #B46-0830 (for an '87, non-syncro);  I paid a fortune (&gt;$100/ea) for
them, but that's long forgotten 7 years later for the ~80k or so miles I've
enjoyed them (&amp; they came with a 'lifetime' warranty).  They were quite
stiff at first - 20k miles B4 they broke in &amp; softened a little.   

Bilstein is currently advertising &quot;...shocks that normally cost up to $119
ea are $50 for a limited time/selected applications....&quot;  Phone is listed as
619 / 453 - 7723.
