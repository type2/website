Subject: More tidbits on my bus

I figures out that I had the pressure fitting for a bug on my bus.  This was 
supposed to screw onto the spare tire- this explains my confusion.  I cut a 
tire valve off and simply screwed it into the female fitting.  That part 
works fine, but the whole system looses pressure very quickly.  I guess I 
have a leak to hunt down.  Thanks for all the help.

I have a week till classes are out, and then its time to do some serious 
work on the bus.  How about this one- what do you do with the fresh air 
hoses when you install a extractor system?  I had been running them around 
the extractor and clampint them onto the heater boxes.  I was thinking about 
trying to fit the small air boxes off a stock muffler onto the extractor.  
What is the lists opinion?  

BTW- the deal with the new engine- I relentlessly hunted down every oil leak 
I could find, only to find the engine burns oil!  Bummer.  I figure that 
with 115~120 psi, the only thing that could be really worn is the valve 
guides.  I am really at a loss for an exact mileage on this engine, but it 
only has to last through the summer. 

Thanks to all-
