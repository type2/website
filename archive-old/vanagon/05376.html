Subject: Heater Tubes

This is kind of a strange question, but before I go off and prepare to do some
custom work, I thought I would ask y'all what the situation might be in 
your respective busi (multiple buses).

Here's the scoop:

I took a Westfalia interior out of a '69 camper, and put it in my '70 
transporter.

The problem?

There are these heater tube thingys that come from the back of the 
transporter(there are two of them, and they used to come out under the 
bench seat that was in the back, that has now been replaced with a 
foldout bed/seat), that did not exist in the '69 camper.  Right now 
these tubes come up into the storage space underneath the bus, and over 
the summer(long trip) they managed to fry several things in the storage 
compartment(cordless drill, timing light, various plastic devices).

I'd like to duct these things so that they are routing heat into the 
cab this winter(rather than selfishly keeping it all underneath the 
seat), and before I go and do up some custom ducting, thought I would 
ask if other people have these with a camper interior, and how the 
problem was tackled?(Did the Westfalia do some ducting, or did all the 
campers not have those little holes in the back?)

And if it does come down to doing it myself, can anyone suggest a high 
heat resistant material to do the ducting(and where I might find it?).  
I was thinking pvc tube at first, but when I saw it melt my timing 
light and cordless, I had second thoughts.

Thoughts?

Jon
