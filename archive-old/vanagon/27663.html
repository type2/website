&gt; I finally got the gas tank out of the bus. It was quite a job. Looks to 
&gt; me like it's gonna be a bigger job putting it back! I've made arrangments 
&gt; with a local radiator repair shop to acid dip it and coat the inside with 
&gt; some sort of gas tank stuff. Several of the rubber gaskets will need to 
&gt; be replaced. I need to replace the tank sending unit. You would not 
&gt; believe the amount of crap that came out of this tank. It's a wonder the 
&gt; damn thing started at all! Questions:
&gt; 1. The expansion tanks. Anyone know how the hoses that go to the gas tank 
&gt; connect/dissconnect from the expansion tanks?
&gt; 2. The black plastic piece that is on the bus body where the filler neck 
&gt; and cap all come together. Anyone know how to remove this thing? It would 
&gt; make putting the tank back on much simpler.

If you rotate it about 15-20 degrees (try to pry it loose from the 
inside, using a flat chisel or so) around its circumference, it can be 
pulled out...
&gt; 3. Are the rubber gaskets that got damaged in removing the tank a dealer 
&gt; only part, or does someone make after market pieces?

I ordered all of them through a local dealer (Sacramento), and they 
arrived by mail w/i 2 days and were really not that expensive, considering 
the fact that I was not worried any longer about the gas puddle under the 
VAN after each refueling...; I replaced all the rubber hoses that connect 
to the tank and the expansion tanks at the same time....

&gt; 4. Is anyone living in or around (or passing through) the Indianapolis 
&gt; area with knowlege of how to put this thing back together willing to 
&gt; trade some hands on experience for some pizza and home brewed beer?

Well, I'm a bit far off for that trade, but it took me less than 2 hrs to 
get the bugger back in and connected; use a lubricant on all rubber seals 
to get things together nice and smooth, and make sure that the breather 
pipe for the filler neck and the two connected breather pipes for the 
expansion tanks are in the correct holes. Good luck
