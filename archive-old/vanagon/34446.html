&gt; I just got this '86 Westfalia GL Syncro.  A lot of little thing were

&gt; When I bought it the rear differential lock did not work.  I talked to a
&gt; couple of mechanics and they told me that it is common for the servos to go
&gt; bad and should be no problem to fix.
&gt; 
&gt; Well the shop, which charges $70 per hour, has spent two hours and can only
&gt; tell me that it is not the servo and that some thing is stuck.  They say that
&gt; they will have to tear open the transmission and have no idea what they will
&gt; find.  They recommend that I drive without fixing.  That I will only need it
&gt; if I get stuck and that the 4-WD works great.
&gt; 
&gt; Anybody out there ever use there rear differential lock?  How much would it
&gt; cost to replace the whole tranny?

Hi Craig,

I have no idea what your problem may be however, hang in there.  I am 
also a New Syncro Westie owner.  I bought a 1987 about 3 months ago an 
I love it.  It has had it's problems when I first bought it, but the 
inspection brought them to light and I was able to use them as a 
negotiating tool.  There have been some unexpected problems that the 
inspection couldn't show, but I &quot;took them on the chin&quot; because I love 
this vehicle.  Living in the &quot;Great White North&quot; where there is snow on 
the ground for ~365 days a year (Or so it seems!!)... Yes I do use the 
diff lock.  ;-)  It is real easy to drive across lakes here, I don't 
know what all talk is about  ;-)

Some unexpected breakages probably due to *EXTREME* cold:

o Front header pipe exhaust elbox joint cracked.  Braised and collared 
  and all is well.
o Water Pump leaking.  Replaced because it could go anytime.
o Left front CV joint.

This vehicle is now very solid.  Most things that usually go wrong with
vehicle at ~200,000 Km have been done.  It will now serve me well for 
years to come. 

If you aren't going to do any off roading, you should be okay with the 
diff lock out of commission.  I have only locked the diff. is some 
extreme conditions.  

I haven't been much help with your original problem, but I wish you 
all the best.

May you have much enjoyment.

Cheers and have a good weekend.  It is going up to a balmy -17C on the 
weekend.  Time to get the Coppertone(tm) out!!!

Tony
