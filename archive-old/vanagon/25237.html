Subject: A good deal or not?

I am thinking about driving a few hours to see this '74 bus.  The guy wants 
$2700 for it and seems pretty firm.  Since he is not local, I'm going to 
have to rely on his description as the truth.  This is the scoop - '74 bus, 
automatic, 7K miles on completely new engine, new Webers (what is that?), 
new dist., new fuel pump, little rust and nice interior.  Is $2700 realistic 
for a bus like this or is this a little high?  I'll have to rely on your 
opinion.  Let me know 'cause I hate for it to get gobbled up if it is really 
a good deal.

Thanks!!!
Paul Smiley
