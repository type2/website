Subject: Adjusting Pertronix Ignitor Dwell ('79 Bus)

Howdy,

Anybody out there have any experience with the Pertronix Ignitor
points/condensor replacement unit?

With the Pertronix unit installed, the dwell meter reads a constant 59
degrees. I think that I want about 47 degrees or so.  The engine runs fine,
except that it idles at about 1200 RPM.  I've tried adjusting the &quot;air gap&quot;
between the ignition module and the magnetic rotor, in and out, with no
change in dwell.

The skimpy documentation that came with the unit explains only how to
install the unit.  It doesn't mention dwell adjustment or a number of other
obvious questions. 

TIA,

Cheese
