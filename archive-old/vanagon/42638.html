Subject: Latch Clarification, Re: Safari Windows

I mispoke in my last piece when I said &quot;I'll be the first to say my latches
don't break&quot;  Slip of the finger on the keyboard.  What I meant to say was
&quot;I'll be the first to say my latches may break, but I'll still back them up&quot;.
 Don't need to start the flamethrowers out here yet. :)
