yep:

i have some pic's from buses in Mexico when i was there last year. I
beleive they are now using a rabbit engine. Also not too hot on the big
grill on the front of the bus. IMHO I prefer the curved roofline of the
&quot;older&quot; buses.

&gt;Picking up a copy of VW motoring (I don't get it normally as it
&gt;covers Audi/Golf type stuff mainly), I came across a feature on
&gt;a German firm called Beetles Revival. This firm exists to import
&gt;Mexican VWs into Europe, mainly various forms of beetle (hence
&gt;the name), but also can get the current Mexican type 2.
&gt;
&gt;Most of the article was beetle options and prices, but a couple
&gt;of bits may be of interest here.
&gt;
&gt;`... Mexican built Type 2 features a 1781cc 63 kW water cooled
&gt;in-line engine with electronic ignition and a regulated catalytic
&gt;converter. Gearbox is a 4-speed manual and it has front disc brakes.
&gt;Extras on the Caravelle are tinted glass, metallic paint, sliding
&gt;windows, velour upholstery, reading lights and radio/cassette
&gt;with aerial and\ speakers.'
&gt;
&gt;A couple of small photos were also included, one showing a panel
&gt;van from a front quarter view with the raiator mounted on the front.
&gt;
&gt;The other photo shows a rear three quarter view of the Caravelle model.
&gt;&gt;From the gutter line down the whole thing is the normal bay window
&gt;bus (if rather clean and straight!), but the roof has changed. The normal
&gt;curve has gone to be replaced by what looks like a squarer top,
&gt;rather like a metal version of a pop top when it is down. Makes
&gt;the bus look quite different in some ways. There are other
&gt;small differences for this model as well; plastic wheel trims,
&gt;embossed vw badge on the middle of the tailgate and black (plastic?)
&gt;mirrors and bumbers.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;No price is given for the bus. Oh well, back to my heap.
