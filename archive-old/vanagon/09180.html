Subject: '85 Parking Brake Problems
Date: Tue, 3 Jan 1995 11:43:58 -0800 (PST)

I took my '85 Vanagon into my favorite mechanic (has worked on all of my 
Vws for the past 10 years) in for new brakes. On the rear brakes, 
specifically, I got new pads, and new wheel cylinders (drums were OK, 
just turned those).  Anyway, Marc got the brakes back together and now he 
says we are having parking brake problems.

At first, the parking brake would activate and hold only one wheel (the 
left, I believe) but not the other.  Then the wheel that it would hold 
was getting &quot;stuck&quot;.  This is not an overly complicated mechanism, or at 
least it seems to me--he still has it and I'm getting impatient.  Any 
suggestions as to what the problem may be?
