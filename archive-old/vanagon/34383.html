&gt; &gt; 	But I may not. Today I looked at a '71. Here's the scoop: This is
&gt; &gt; an engine from one bus in the body of another. The body has 57K
&gt; &gt; miles. Don't know about the engine yet bet I'll find out. It's a VW
&gt; &gt; repair shop that did the work and is selling it. Good tight steering,
&gt; &gt; good brakes and clutch. The motor looked fairly clean, not a lot of
&gt; &gt; oil around, but it needs a new rubber  seal. I didn't see any sign
&gt; 
&gt; Big red flag #1! Do the compression test. If it's missing the seal and 
&gt; sitting at a garage, be suspicious. My2Cents 8) Joe

	Good point Joe!!

	These guys are a VW repair shop and they say they installed the 
	engine.  If so, why did they reuse a crappy seal that they say only 
	costs 8 bucks.
		Hmmmm.........makes you wonder.

	Well, I've got a line on another '71. &quot;10k on a rebuilt engine, CD
	player....&quot;  blah, blah, blah....(I don't own any CD's, but I
	guess I could borrow some)   Price- $3,700.00.

	 I guess I'll look at it, but man, it's a jungle out there......
