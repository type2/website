Subject: 74 Westy for sale.

I posted this a few weeks ago for $3000; my wife and I are trying to raise 
cash for a house down payment, so I've slashed the price.  Now asking 
$2400.  Major problems are missing (rotted out?) heater carrier pipes.  The 
heat exchangers themselves appear to be nearly new.  There's some rust 
behind the front wheels.

1974 Westfalia VW camper van for sale. 

Orange and beige paint, with orange canvas (canvas has a few small tears, 
easily patched).  20# propane tank and 5000 BTU propane catalytic 
heater.  Sink and icebox.  4 speaker, AM/FM cassette.  Upholstered seat/ 
storage box between front seats.  Body is in good condition.  Booster 
springs in front and rear.  Orange privacy curtains all the way around. 

150,000 miles, with an engine rebuild.  VDO dash clock (not installed). 

Single carbeuretor 1800cc engine (the hard-to-sychronize dual carbs were 
replaced).  Runs like a champ! 

I know the previous owner paid $3000 for this about 3 years ago, so let's 
start the price discussions there.  I've only put about 2000 miles on it 
since I got it, and I've done a lot of work to it (I installed the stereo, 
the sink/icebox, the jump seat, the front booster springs, an ignition 
switch, a speedometer cable, etc.). 

Thanks, 
--Dale
