Subject: some question

OK, these question range from perhaps serious to not serious at all 
(unless you are a lover of music).

1.  All the sudden my shifting has become &quot;hard&quot;.  The gear shifter won't 
slide in and out of gear, it wants to be pulled out and pushed in.  Any 
ideas?

2.  I have a real bad loss of power, forward motion in general, in low 
gears, low speed.  Pulling out from a stop sign the van seems to just 
wait a while then slowly pick up and take off.  I've done plugs, wires, 
cap, rotor.  Any ideas?

3.  Can I salvage speakers from any Van for the door, or are they 
specific from year to year?

4.  ......I had another question, but, it is friday and i forget.....
oh well, can't be too important.  right.....right?
