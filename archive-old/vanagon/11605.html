Subject: Phoenix Vanagon Service?

Posting this for our son who recently moved his Westphalia to Phoenix, AZ 
and is looking for a reliable and affordable place to get service.  Would 
appreciate input from those of you who have had some positive experiences 
in the Phoenix area.  He needs air conditioning repair plus general 
maintenance.  His Vanagon exhibits a bucking symptom after driving for 
several hours.  Thanks in advance.
