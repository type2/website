     you clearly have a clutch problem.

&gt; Hello-
&gt;
&gt; I installed a rebuilt 4-speed trans in my 83.5 Westy and it grinds into
&gt; reverse. It's not the worst grind I've ever heard, but it's disturbing.
&gt;
&gt; If I start the bus with the clutch disengaged and put it into reverse there
&gt; is NO grind.
&gt; But if I let it idle with the clutch engaged then push down the clutch and
&gt; shift to reverse there is the grind. Also If I move in forward gear then stop
&gt; (completely that is) and shift to reverse it grinds. The forward gears all
&gt; work fine upshifting and downshifting.
&gt;
&gt; Is this reverse grind normal? Or has anyone else suffered this problem and
&gt; has an idea what to blame it on?
&gt;
&gt; I have a newly rebuilt engine so I didn't replace the pilot bearing when I
&gt; did the trans replacement. I assumed it was Ok. And I was also pretty broke
&gt; so I didn't replace the clutch or pressure plate. But like I said the forward
&gt; gears work fine.
&gt;
&gt; Finally, I didn't adjust the clutch. But if it were a clutch adjustment
&gt; problem, wouldn't it grind into forward gears as well?
&gt;
&gt; Any ideas?
&gt; TIA
