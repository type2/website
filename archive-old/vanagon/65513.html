Subject:      Finally fixed and FS West Texas

Hello gang, I am happy to report that I finally have my 82 Westy running
again.  Finally broke down and paid the big bucks for the Bentley book
and replaced the #2 temp sensor.  Runs great now.  While I was running
around town today I spotted:

1985 Vanagon GL Wesfalia For Sale
The current owner wasn't home but I have some information
Polar White with some dings but no major rust that I could see
94 K miles
A/C looks like it works
Nice tint job on the windows
Interior look nice
Outside flaps on access plugs (water, 120 ac, etc) are missing
No major oil drops under the back-end

Looks really nice, wish I could afford it.
If anyone is interested, I could try again and get a hold of the Owner.
Or E-mail me for his phone number.  I'm sure he wouldn't mind if it
helped to sell his vehicle.
