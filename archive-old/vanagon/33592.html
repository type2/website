&gt;I think that this is the chemical (NaOH-sodium hydroxide) that is used in a
&gt;hot tank.  Can anyone confirm of deny?

Yeah.... I think I can confirm that.  Rather. once upon a time, the favorite 
chemical for the hot tanks was NaOH.  These days, you are likely to find 
other chemicals that are less obnoxious (to use, dispose of, etc) and more 
compatible with more automotive materials.  NaOH does a great job on steel, 
iron, and basically ferrous materials; the story is different when it comes 
to non-ferrous metals such as aluminium or magnesium.  At the very least, 
NaOH will discolor these metals when left in contact for anything longer 
then &quot;casual&quot; periods of time; longer exposures will result in surface 
damage from chemical attack.  I've heard stories of machine shops placing a 
VW block in a dip tank for a good overnight soaking, and returning to find a 
collection of studs and otherwise ferrous components settled to the bottom 
of the basket....the rest of the block having dissolved in the dip solution. 
(talk about idiot factor....)

So, I would be very careful in attempting to use NaOH as a home made 
cleaning solution, and not use it on the non-ferrous components.  I've had 
good luck in using Simple Green, a razor blade (carefully operated) and 
Safety Kleen solvent (not necessarily in that order or combination!) to 
remove lots of things.  Gumout (in moderation) is also good.  If you find 
you must use some lye-like chemical, Oven Cleaner is (I think) the same 
thing, in a somewhat less obnoxious/hazardous vehicle.  The same warnings 
re: chemical attack apply.  Be Careful!
