Subject: Six split window vans to go 

Mail sent from AIR Mosaic (16-bit) version 3.06.04.01 

This will be of interest to people in Ontario, Quebec, upstate N.Y.  A friend 
has six vans from the sixties to go: 2 Deluxe, 1 Panel, 3 Kombis.  These are 
in his personal wrecking yard in a field north of Ottawa (you'll never find it 
without directions).  Some were rescued from being sent to the wreckers; at 
least two were project vehicles.  Expect rust.  Bring a trailer.  Wait until 
spring unless you come with a snow plow.

The owner is Paul Budd at 613 256-7000.  Call him if you are interested.  As 
he is a two hour drive (in a mid-eighties single cab VW pickup) from the site, 
he is interested in serious enquiries only.  No sense in four hours round trip to
sell window latches.  Take the whole thing, why don't you?  Make him an offer.
Get these beasts back on the road or parted out.

Owner of 67 Deluxe with world's ugliest paint job (not for sale)
