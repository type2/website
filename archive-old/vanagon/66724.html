Hello , I am still trying to sell my vanagon. I have it advertised in a few
VW garages. I was asking $3,000 for it but am now taking all reasonable
offers. My wife bought a newer van and we dont need two of them. So far, I
have had three responses but noone has actually looked at it yet. Hers a
recap on it:  Recently re-built engine, new heads and pistons and cylinders.
Tires are two years old and you will not beleive me when you see them. Shocks
are gabriel and also two years old. Paint is bright orange with cream on the
upper portion of the body. I have some hub caps on her but they look good
with the orange paint. Fake BBS style with gold spokes. I almost had some
real ones but someone beat me to them. The interior? Excellent condition
despite the age of the vehicle. Padding is worn on some seats but vinyl is
holding up well. The dash and interior side panels are like new. Headliner is
in good condition. Overall the condition of the van is excellent. Probably
the best unrestored example of the air-cooled model you will find. I am
looking for a beetle in good condition, I am willing to trade for a beetle or
a later model vanagon. JBrian65_at_aol_dot_com
