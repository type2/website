Subject: Re: Trouble with Type II rod bearings...


&gt; You need to know if the clearance exceeds spec, which should be about
&gt;.0015&quot;.  If the radial play is more than .0025&quot;, then you need to replace the
&gt;connecting rod.

I Platigaged carefully, clamped everything in such a way that it couldn't
move around. The verdict is:

On each lobe, something's not flat. Some are worse than others; they're all
triangular to some degree. The best I do is .018 and from there it moves up
toward .030. This Plastigage won't measure accurately beyond that, but it
doesn't really matter beyond that anyway...

Then I started calling mail-order places looking for new rods, not rebuilds
(why go through this all over again?), and it turns out there aren't any.
No longer available.

So. Can I get these rods wallered out so they take the +.75 mm bearings?
That would be...what...55.25 mm in the crankpin diameter? If I want it done
well do I have to go to a race shop?
