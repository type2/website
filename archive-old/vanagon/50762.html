&lt;&lt;       So, the question:  Why would the leading edge of the piston wear
 like that and would that cause the drop in compression?  I would assume
 that the rings are still doing their job as there is no oil consumption or
 blue smoke.
         If that is not the problem, what else could cause this drop in
 compression.  As I said, the valves seem to seat well, the rings are in
 good shape and the cylinder still looks very good.
         If you like, you can email me directly or to the list.
                 Thanks in advance

It did not wear!  It started burning away.  EGR valve is probasbly missing or
non-functional.  Look for other causes of overheating as well.
