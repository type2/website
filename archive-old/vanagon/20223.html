Yup, and I got to use it too.  I bought a brand new Die Hard Gold for
the Mustang, and a year later left my lights on overnight.  The battery
would no longer hold a charge.  I took it back to Sears, paid
$20-something for the pro rate, and got a new one.  I watch the
installer toss my one year old battery into a pile of Die Hard Golds.
He said they get them back all the time.    

The Die Hard Gold is a strong battery, but it doesn't seem to have much
resistance to being discharged.  I had an old car once with electrical
problems, with an old Black top/white case Die Hard battery in it.  That
battery got run down dead many times and I was always able to roll
start the car and it would charge back up.  I eventually sold the car
with the still good battery in it, several years later.

FWIW,
