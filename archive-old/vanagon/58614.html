&lt;&lt; &gt; &lt;&lt; chrisI have a 91 westy . How do I get a middle seat for that?
 &gt;   &gt;&gt;
 &gt; 
 &gt; do you have the tracks in the floor under your carpet?
 &gt; 
 &gt; any middle seat out of a 7 passenger Vanagon will work.
 &gt; chrisI do have middle tracks, but I think for a single seat only. Is this 
 particular to the canadian version? Also Where do I find a seat? &gt;&gt;

well, folks, it seems as if there is no semblance to this. 
So far we've concluded that '85's have it, '87's '88's and 89's don't, and
'91's do....
typical VW....  :&lt;)

oh, and where do you get a seat?
a junked Van, or you can always buy one from VW if you've got money to
burn.....  :&lt;)
