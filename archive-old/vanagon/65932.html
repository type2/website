Subject:      85 Camper:  Won't Start After long road run

Now experienced (once) problem I've occasionally had with 77 Bus:  after a
long run on the highway engine will not restart until half hour or more.  No
starter action.
Mechanics say they cannot diagnose unless it happens when I bring it in!
