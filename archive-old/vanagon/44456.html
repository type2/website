Subject: Engine?????

Hi,

Does anyone know how to tell the engine type, year, that sort of 
thing? There has got to be a number located on the block somewhere. 
All I know is its dual carb, the guy I got it from mentioned somethig 
about 2000cc, but it could have been a sales pitch. Its in a '73 
Westfalia. If its 2000cc then would it be ranging from '74-on? I 
admit Im an amature at this whole VW thing, only owning it for a year,
 and hobbiest at mechanic things. I finally figured out the VIN thing 
a little while ago,(233-000-000= (2-Transporter, 3-Kombi, 3-'73)right?
 Anyway thanx for any input.

Rich
'73 Kombi/Westy
