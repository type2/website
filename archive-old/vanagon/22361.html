Subject: Vanagon models

Hi,
Does anyone else collect Vanagon toys &amp; models?

I've developed a little collection of Vanagon models and toys over the last
few years and there's a few things I'd like to add to my collection:

Hot Wheels Sunwagon - purple color
Revell Vanagon Camper model
Revell Vanagon model (I have the Magnum P.I. edition, but not the standard
one)

If anyone out there is interested in selling these items please let me know.

JimDavis
