Subject: starter motor woes

Hi,

 Well the only two things that are now stopping me from driving my van
are, insurance (i've got to wait until pay day to afford it), and a small
problem with the starter motor, well the problem is finding the right one
to fit my engine. 
The engine i have is a 1200 30hp (i think you call this the 36hp in the states)
and every single 6V starter we have tryed does not fit the flywheel properly.
does anyone know how many different 6V starters there are, and any sources
i could possibly purchase one from?

 Sorry to bother people with this, but as i am quite new to all this
e-mail and internet stuff, i was wondering what other mailing lists are
availible, is there a list of lists availible, i know there must be quite a few.

Any help would be great!

Cheers,

Ben Ryan
