&gt; I gave 'em a tweak and the engine purrrrrred. Bob will live to see
&gt; another highway!!! Now I need to know what the mileage is supposed to
&gt; be, so I don't burn a valve or something. 20? 25? 

Well, I get 18-20, but I have the bubble top.  I would expect slightly
better with a normal van or westy.  Glad to hear your van is running
better, but remember to listen for pinging and richen the mixture and/or
retard the timing if you hear any at all.
