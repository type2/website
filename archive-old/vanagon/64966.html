Bob,

I have a set of the Mich. XC4S 185R14 C PR6.  They are 6-ply rated and
labeled 1710 lbs. _at_ 55 psi.  They are good tires in my opinion.  My
previous tires, Mich. XC 185R14 C PR6 with a highway tread, were identical
except for the tread and they lasted I guess about 65,000 miles.  The XC's
are supposedly discontinued and replaced with the lighter duty MX tire,
1540 lbs. _at_ 50 psi I think.

The tread on my XC4S set is an aggressive all season style, or a mild snow
tread.  The tread design reminds me of the Goodyear Wrangler, with four
rows of diagonal blocks.  The tire is quiet on pavement, but those big
blocks of rubber are wiggley and can wear unevenly if you do not rotate
frequently.

Your Costco price sounds like a good deal, although you might want to
verify that with a price quote from Tire Rack mail order.

&gt; I'm going to be replacing my Michlin XZX 185 R  14's soon and stopped by
my
&gt; local Costco to see what they had. The only thing they stock is a
Uniroyal
&gt; AWP Lariat 195 75 14, load range C,  LT tire. $261.70 out the door. They
&gt; can order a Michlin XC45 185 R 14 for $365.14 out the door. Anyone have
any
&gt; expierience with either of these? I hate the thought of not being able to
&gt; use the XZX's anymore cause the work so well. Later,
