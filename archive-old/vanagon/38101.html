Rick Koller asked:

&gt;gambler I was keenly interested. Any thoughts and or opinions from the List?

I use the above product in our Jetta; it seems to do what it's supposed to
(ie run
cooler).  As an aside, I also changed the thermostat and fan switch when I
changed
to waterwetter (to lower temp units), so that might have some bearing on the
results also.  It's worth a try, since I don't see any negative results when
I check
the coolant in the car

I have another bottle sitting on the bench in the garage, so I'll probably
try it out
on the EV the next time the system gets flushed.
