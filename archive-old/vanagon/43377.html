Subject: Boiling Aligators in Florida

Oh boy, here we go.  Seems I just asked about the two heat levels at which the two 
screw-in switches which close when sufficiently heated and are screwed into the 
Vanagon's radiator and which finally control the fan's two speeds.  Now comes Colin A 
Moran, who writes:  &quot;Bentley shows two switches for the fan on the '86
and newer vans on comes on at 192degF and the other comes on at 203degF.&quot;
  So naturally, I'm ready to remove my two switches, place them in a pot of water on the 
stove, and, using aligator clips and a meter set to ohms with a candy thermometer, find 
out if mine are within specifications.  Sweet, huh?
  But mine's a Diesel Westy.  My question is, are those heat closing values also correct 
for the diesel version?  If not, what are the numbers?
  And you though my subject might have meant something different.
