Subject: Info.Needed

Hello,

I have a 1985 water cooled Vanagon w/135,000 miles on the original engine. It
has a compression leak or two, and is definately in need of a complete overhaul.
Estimates for such an overhaul average out to approx. $3,500. 

Do you have any info on avg. prices for such work? How about some options - can
I find a used engine somewhere, or a long block?

Any info. you may have would be a big help.

Thanks,
Walter Houle
