&gt; demand, usually triggered by vacuum.  the water injection quantity

&gt; this were
&gt; 
&gt; 1. higher mpg
&gt; 2. carbon removal
&gt; 3. cooler running, smoother running
&gt; 4. reduced detonation
&gt; 
&gt; maybe this would help you air-cooleds, it seems like a perfect 
&gt; application.  yes, its dated technology but so are some VW engines.  
&gt; 
&gt; does anyone have experience with these set-ups?  are they still being 
&gt; marketed in speed shops??  i never did buy one of these setup but i 
&gt; think i kept the literature, i could post it if interested.

I can tell you how to build one out of parts available at any pet store!
It works on the same principle as the hokah pipe.  and it uses a 20% 
alcohol mixture.  I plan to install one in my bus as soon as I get the 
chance.  I used one in my pinto and it did give me a little gas mileage 
but not much more.  It might help to cool an air cooled engine but I 
don't know.  I'll do up a drawing and post it somewhere appropriate.
