Subject: '71; brake vacuum hose substitute
Date: Mon, 6 Nov 1995 17:26:19 -0500 (EST)

Hi Y'all,

I didn't pay attention when I should have and didn't see anything obvious 
in the vanagon ftp site (is there a better place to look?), so what 
exactly is the cheaper but reliable vacuum hose that runs from the master 
servo to the intake manifold?  What's on there has stuck me with its 
protruding wire for the last *&amp;%$# time, pardon mon francais.  

TIA,

Mitch
