Subject: Isetta = VW ?

i had a good look at an isetta a while ago.  It was in real nice shape, and i
noticed that a bunch of the parts were made by vw .!!     I dont remember
exactly what, though.  It was stuff like  door handles, ash tray, and
steering wheel.  There is also one in a foreign car repair place in downtown
Oly,  you can see it through the window with all the other dusty stuff piled
up everywhere.
