Subject: Re: Some 1600cc questions.


Sorry if I'm jumping into the middle of an already discussed topic, but 
is the &quot;2 liter&quot; a souped up type 1 or a real 2 liter FI pancake ?

My real question:

I'd be really interested to know if anyone has put a Bug engine into a 
'76-'79 Bus. Or alternatively, '76-'79 Westfalia camper components on a 
'68-'71  Bus.

I love my 2.0 liter, but It makes me uncomfortable in Mexico/CA. Any 
experiences ?

&gt; Subject: Some 1600cc questions.
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt;  Having pulled the dead 2 litre from my bus a few weeks ago I'm
&gt;  left with the dilema of rebuilding the 2 litre (which is what
&gt;  I really want), or slapping in a 1600 (which is all I can really
&gt;  afford). 
&gt;  
&gt;  I have a number of partially complete 1600s lying around, and
&gt;  so would really only require bearings, gasket set and rings to
&gt;  get a reasonable motor. That lot cost less than the gasket set
&gt;  alone for the 2 litre. 
&gt; 
&gt;  I pulled apart an AS21 based engine yesterday and the case, pistons 
&gt;  and bores are in excellent condition, but the whole thing has been 
&gt;  running really rich. The layer of carbon on the pistons and head 
&gt;  is amazingly thick! 
&gt; 
&gt;  I noticed as well that the oil deflector plate has been installed
&gt;  the wrong way round, probably not a problem but more a comment on the
&gt;  care (!?) that the previous builder put the engine together with.
&gt; 
&gt;  Which leads to some questions. This engine has a 050 dizzy fitted.
&gt;  Now Muir says this is a no no for this engine, as it dosn't retard
&gt;  #3. Has anyone run a 1600 with a 050? Any problems?
&gt; 
&gt;  I would have to use the alternator from the 2 litre with the 1600.
&gt;  I pressume that as the later 1600s had alternators, that they
&gt;  were of the same type for both engines?
&gt; 
&gt;  Having changed the engine mounting arrangement to suit the type 4
&gt;  style (i.e.) solid mountings on the chassis, rubber mounting on the
&gt;  engine, I now find the mounting bar for the 1600 is the other way round
&gt;  (rubber on the chassis mounts, bolts on the engine). I'm unwilling to hack
&gt;  the mountings around again, so is there a quick and easy solution to this?  
&gt; 
&gt;  (The more questions I come up with the more I start to realise I'd
&gt;   better re-mortgage the cat and go the 2 litre route, but anyway any
&gt;   answers would be appreciated)  
&gt; 
&gt;  TIA
&gt;  cheers
