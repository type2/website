Tim ,that flat spot in acceleration between shifts is a common result of a
lean condition brought on by the O2 sensor.I have found disconnecting the
sensor and readjusting the mixture to 2.0% and advancing the timing to 10btdc
works wonders for drivability and mileage as well as power.Too bad its
illegal?????
