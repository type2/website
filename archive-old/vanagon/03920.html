This is really for the UK dudes. (all 4 others)

Did anyone go to Gum-Ball rally at Alton Towers ?
I did.



I am looking at the events page in Volksworld, and
can't decide what to do next weekend 17/18th. There
are the two alternatives:

o    Bug blast - hmm, a long way from Manchester to
     get wet! Although I could get some waves in.
     And the night-life is cool.

o    Vanfest '94 - Being a bit Bug-Show-unaware is
     (as the name suggests) Vanfest a show/festival
     dedicated to Buses and lovely NOS Bus goodies
     stalls ?

Waiting in anticipation...

Lee.
