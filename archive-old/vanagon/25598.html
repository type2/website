Subject: Re: Mo' buses in da movies(2)


&gt;OK, I'll bite. In that case I would guess the black rubber knobs not the
ivory knobs typical of earlier buses. The bus probably also had a Eflasher
knob whereas earlier buses relied on brave folks with road flares. Seat belts?
&gt;
&gt;Could it have been a &quot;Bobby '68&quot; bumper sticker?
&gt;Don't *even* dare to ask &quot;Bobby who?&quot;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;-A 12v sticker?
&gt;&gt;&gt;-The rear view mirror?
&gt;&gt;&gt;-Radio w/backing plate or large block off plate?                   ______
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;It was an interior shot, but not these reasons.
