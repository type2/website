Subject: Re: dashboard fan?

My '81 westy came with a dashboard fan when I bought it about a year
ago.  I'd recommend getting something of good quality, and mounting
it in the center of the dash, or maybe even better, two fans, one for
each of the two frong passengers.  You may wanted increased air flow
circulation in the rear, too, btw.  Anyway, mine is hardwired to the dc,
so I can switch it on/off even if the engine is not running, which is
nice if parked in a hot car for brief periods of time, so as not
to drain the battery.  Also, mine is very adjustable, and has the
option to oscillate, which I find quite desirable.  I belive I
saw an ad in one of the VW mags in the last year advertising
from Barney's a VERY powerful dash fan.  I would think the more
power the better, as the air circ. in these cars is otherwise next
to nothing.

Hope that helps....
