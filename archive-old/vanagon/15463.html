Subject: Question on body panel &quot;filler&quot;
Date: Thu, 13 Apr 95 7:59:16 EDT

We are in the process of having the Vanagon repainted and since I will
be doing the bulk of the prep work, I thought it would be a good idea to
&quot;repair&quot; the hairline fissures that appear between the body panels. What
is this stuff? Is
this some kind of VW only elastic body filler or can I buy it anywhere?
Does it need to be sanded to be painted or can I just fill the cracks in like
putty and paint over them? Has anyone experience in using the stuff?
Thanks for any advice. David C.
