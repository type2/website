&gt; &gt; That is too much a waste for vanagon miles. Maybe it's time to get a Jetta?

&gt; I test-drove a Jetta with a VR6. I loved it. I can't afford it. I cried.

&gt; By the way, I've driven past Vanagons like they were standing still in

Tho I do love to drive my bus, there is nothing like the ol' turbo-d surge 
when I accelerate.  No, not neck-snapping, but (in more ways than one) 
I'm truly smokin'! (but not inhalin')   ;-)
