Subject: RE: Is Owning a Van Probable Cause?

        I would like to think that such thoughts are evidence of an 
        overactive imagination or a real need for prozac.  However, 
        within the last four weeks, one of my students, aged 17, who 
        drives a 73 Westy semi-hippiemobile, has been stopped twice and 
        submitted to what might be charitably called pretext searches.  
        One of these included a drug dog and detained him for about an 
        hour.  Both of the searches occurred on a Friday night and on the 
        local &quot;strip&quot; near our area's largest mall.  At no time could the 
        officers give any sort of reasonable explainations for the basis 
        of the stops.  The student's father, who is an ATTORNEY, had a 
        few words with the sector commander over the second incident.  
        Attitudes tended to change quickly even if no reasonable 
        explaination could be given.
        
        It can still happen but not as a rule.  I know too many 
        &quot;po-leece&quot; (emphasis on the po here in the Bible Belt) who view 
        a Type II simply as an historical curiousity.  Drug dudes and 
        dudettes drive much fancier vehicles now than then they did in 
        the 60's and 70's.  In short, do you stand much of a chance of 
        being &quot;Easy Ridered&quot;?  Probably not in 1995.
        
        Peace,
        Skip
