Subject: by the way Joel, change the stats

Well, having been busless for a month and a half, I now find myself the 
owner of an '87 Westy Multivan wolfsburg edition.....power mirrors, 
windows, door locks, and other strange amenities.  I'm currently residing 
in Durham, so I drove one car down to Columbia,SC to get it.  It 
successfully made its inaugural journey without a hitch and with the AC 
on full blast.  Now I have to go back to get the car I drove down there 
in.  

I do have many questions about owning a water cooled VW, but I suppose 
that I'll ask them another time.  However, since I have your attention 
and I'd like to keep this vehicle a while, if any of you have any general 
suggestions regarding maintenance, I'd appreciate hearing them.  By the 
way, though I have an owners manual, no maintenance schedule was included 
with my purchase.  Does anyone have one that they could photocopy??

It's weird driving a bus that goes up hills so easily, but I suppose I'll 
get used to it.

later.......

david
