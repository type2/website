Subject: Re: Tire Questions re: Steve's response


&gt;A point of clarification. Would a reasonable substitute for a C rated tire
&gt;on a Vanagon be a higher rated standard car tire? If I understand Steve's
&gt;point a stiffer sidewall would provide better handling so it might be wise
&gt;to go to tire rated for ahigher speed to gain that advantage.

Bingo, as far as handling goes-- that was my point exactly.

Not sure what a C rated tire is-- is that a speed rating like H, S, etc.,
or is it an indication of an increased load rating, such as LT tires
for light trucks in this country?

Normal passenger car tires have max load and pressure restrictions
on the side of the tire, such as &quot;MAX LOAD 980 LBS AT 35 PSI MAX
PRESSURE&quot;, or some such. It varies slightly with the manufacturer,
tire model, etc. Light-truck tires also have such ratings, but they tend to
be a lot higher, such as 1750 pounds at 50 psi or so. This is accomplished
by building thicker, stiffer sidewalls, usually with 6 plies instead of 4, 
and
doing other things to strengthen the tire. I would guess that these mods
also stiffen the tire, and may make hadling better. But since I've never
put these reinforced tires on my buses (and never had a problem with
the passenger-car tires I've always used), I can only guess at the
effects on handling.

Buses have a VERY high payload capacity, in case you've never
looked in your owner's manual-- I believe some can carry up to
one ton of people, suitcases, bricks, firewood, or what have you.
If you do this, THEN I recommend you use the reinforced light-truck
tires! But the bus alone is fairly light-- if you are only going to haul
the wife and kids around, and the occasional couch or small load
of lumber, then passenger car tires should be fine-- they work for me.

If in doubt, measure the load you want to carry, add the weight of the bus,
occupants, and fuel, divide by 4, and compare to the load rating on the
tires. Rear tires often carry the heavier part of the load-- add 10% or so
to be safe. If you are approaching the max load rating on the tire, better
make two trips, or consider getting light-truck tires.
