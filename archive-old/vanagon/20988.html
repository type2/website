Subject: Re: Problem w/temp gauge

In a message Gary (coyote_at_nando_dot_net) writes -

&gt;When I come to a stoplight, or am sitting idling, the guage reading drops 
&gt;to 5-10psi and the dummy light comes on.  I believe this is due to the 6 
&gt;inch nipple I had to use - at idle the oil is not getting up there !?
&gt;If I tap the accel. the gauge goes back up.

The stock Oil Pressure Sender is designed to turn the light on at about 5psi.
 The VDO Dual Sender is designed to have the light come on at about 7 to
10psi.  If you've got oil pressure that low at idle (should be about 950rpm),
there may be too much clearance on the main/rod/cam bearings - that's been my
experience - could be a tired oil pump too. 

&gt;The oil temp gauge never moves!  
&gt;Now I guess I will buy a different sensor - one that mounts in the oil 
&gt;drain plug would ensure that the sensor was getting contact with oil.

Never have had a true reading off the nipple-tee type fitting.  The oil plate
sender is the way to go, however it does not replace the drain plug.  You
have to drill a hole in the 2nd sump plate located just below the filler tube
(as per sender instructions) to mount it there.

Good luck with gettin' the temp :)
