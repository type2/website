Subject: VW Bus Reviews???

Today we have numerious magazines giving long write-ups on every new car and 
model available.  During the '70s was there such a magazine for original 
model year reviews?  Something like &quot;Introducing the new 1978 VW Bus!&quot;  I'd 
love to hear the explanations of the &quot;new&quot; features.  Any suggestions?

Thanks!
