Subject: RE: help - bentley manual


&gt;        I just called around to the 2 VW dealers in town and neither has a
&gt;Bently manual in stock. They can order them in no problem, but they cost
&gt;$145 + GST. Thats alot. I know it'll save me in the long run...but I have
&gt;to worry about my current short jog.
&gt;        So does anyone have a used one to sell (not likely huh?)? or else
&gt;does anyone know where I could order one for cheaper?


JC Whitney advertises the Bentley for '80 to '92 Vgon, for $69.99.
Part number 16NY6901N. Call them at 312-431-6102.
