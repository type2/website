Subject: engine trouble of a different kind

Pardon me for asking the list for advice not exactly related to Busses:

This morning I tossed my Bus engine case into the trunk of my Bug, 
so I could do some cleaning and measurment at work.  Now that I'm here,
I can't get the trunk open!  Any Bug owners know a trick to opening a
stuck trunk on a '71 Superbeetle?  Email me please, to reduce bandwidth.
