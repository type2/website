&gt; &gt; 	David S had suggested runnign it on 6V.  Does that seem wise to
&gt; &gt; y'all?  DO ya think it would even work?  I'm curious, and would like
&gt; &gt; some feedback before I start running amuck with wires and stuff.
&gt; 
&gt; The reason I suggested that was because the fridge basically just runs
&gt; on a heating element, and while it probably wouldn't get as hot on only
&gt; 6 volts, I figured it might work well enough to cool the fridge.  Some
&gt; one gonna back me up on this?  =)

I don't know enough about the fridges (or heating elements for that
matter) to say anything other than maybe.

Electrically speaking:
        If the power the fridge draws is constant, then halving the
voltage would double the current.

If this is the case, a voltage splitting circuit would be simple to
design and likely cost well under $10.00 to build. Find out if this is
the case, and I'll throw together a quick schematic for you with parts
readily available at Radio Trash er Shack.

Power=Current multiplied by voltage

        If the power the fridge draws is NOT constant, then it would
work but the power would be halved.

Sorry about the vague answer but it's the best I could do.

Lates,
Greg
