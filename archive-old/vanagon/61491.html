Subject: the cost of air

I recently bought an 87 GL to replace my much loved (but rusty) 75 westy.
I'm becoming acquainted with it's peculiarities/preferences, and are
pleased.  I was wondering ,since the wasserboxer is so much more powerful
than the air cooled version,  what is the cost, in horsepower, for air
cooling?  I am a heavy duty mechanic here on Vancouver Island in a logging
camp and are familiar with the 35 to 40 horsepower air conditioning costs on
the industrial installations I see so much of.  
Another thing occured to me while I was waiting for my wife  at the grocery
store in the rain.  The 75 had a cool little drain gutter on the front of
the vent window.  I assume it's there so that you can sit with the vent
window open, in the rain, and the water doesn't drip on the floor.  This
seems like a good idea to me.  If it was such a good idea why didn't they do
the same thing on the vanagons?  Or does it serve some other mysterious
purpose no longer nessesary on the vanagons?
