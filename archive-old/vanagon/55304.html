Subject: Re: Schematic Programmable Delay Circuit

&gt;&gt;  &gt; It explains the idea and gives the part number for a replacement wiper
&gt;&gt;  &gt; relay from VW that will give your Vanagon programable delay wipers. $35
&gt;&gt;  &gt; bucks or so, unless you dig one out the local junkyard. The you just
&gt;&gt;  &gt; replace the current relay with the new one.  Many other VW/Audi products
&gt;&gt;  &gt; have this feature: you can too!


OK, anyone know what wrecks we should be picking over to snag these relays
from?  year/model?  VWs/Volvos/Audis/......   fess up now, no hoarding
allowed!  Tim
