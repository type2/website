Subject: Aux battery

I know this been beaten to death in the past, but. In lieu of an isolator
what would happen if I wired the second battery in parallel with the first
but put a heavy duty solenoid in the + line. Then I could hook it up to a
switch and flip it on when needed. Is this doable or dangerous? Grainger has
continuous duty solenoids on sale.
