Hey There!

Putting in new stereo in my '87 GL and I bought some aftermarket
speakers.  The problem is that the grills of the new speakers are not
flush mounted like the factory models.  If I recall there was a vendor
who sold &quot;spacers&quot; so that the crank cleared the speaker grill.  Could
someone send me his phone/address please?

Thanks a bunch!

Also...thanks Richard for the coffee mugs, they are bitchin' (4 Type
Style)!
