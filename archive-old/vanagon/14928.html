&gt; &gt; Pete,
&gt; &gt; 	Here is a list of names and e-mails of people I have that are on
&gt; &gt; the East coast and have expressed some interest in GNATT:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Are you still willing to try and coordinate something?  It looks like
&gt; &gt; the West coast leg will be starting from St. Louis on Monday, May 29th
&gt; &gt; (after Busses by the Arch).  Let me know if you still want to do this,
&gt; &gt; and if not I will send this list to someone else...
&gt; 
&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; I've gotten busy and am way behind on email....  started working my way 
&gt; backwards.  Whatcha talkin about?  We're based in Northern Virgina and 
&gt; are interested in any east coast vw van type activity.  (93 Eurovan MV - 
&gt; almost a weekender)
&gt; 
&gt; bill and diane killian    killian_at_qnet_dot_com
&gt; 
Think South!  How far will the GNATT be travelling south?  Where are 
possible hook up sites for a Floridian?
