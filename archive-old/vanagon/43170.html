&gt; Subject:       [NEED INFO] Questions on AT Transmission

&gt; I am contemplating the purchase of an `87 Westy with the automatic
&gt; transmission.  Can anyone tell me what the idiosyncrasies are with this
&gt; trans, if any??  Are they reliable??  What is the life expectancy??  Do they
&gt; depreciate the value of a Westy??
&gt; 
I have an 85 GL w/ an automatic and a friend who has an 84 4spd.  
After having driven both, I prefer my automatic.  The van itself has 
137K miles and I did a rebuild at 120K.  Rebuild cost me $600 and was 
done by a local VW mechanic.  I saved myself a little $$ by removing 
and installing the tranny myself.  (NOT a difficult job at all!)  My 
van seems to have all the power that my friend's does and I've been 
happy with mine.  This is coming from a sworn manual transmission 
supporter.
