&gt; 
&gt; Hi!  I am looking for a 2000cc engine for my '79 VW bus, I have been
&gt; asking around, the best price I found for a rebuilt engine is with
&gt; GTX at $1100.00, does anyone have any suggestions as to where to find
&gt; one at a better price?  How difficult would it be to replace an
&gt; engine?  Any suggestions?  Thanks!    Dave

  Engines are not too hard to change, see the idiots guide or one of the other
  manuals for the scope of the job and the tools required. When shopping for
  an engine, make _sure_ you get one for a '79, otherwise your exhaust system
  will not go back on. Does anybody know if long blocks for 80-82 Vanagons
  will fit the '79 bus?
