&gt; Martha, What time do you think the dinner will be?  We will bring some after
&gt; dinner libations, as you suggested, and will probably bring an appetizer as
&gt; well.  Hopefully we can get there early enough for that.  Also, can you
&gt; remind me of the logistics?  Is the first person there going to try to round
&gt; up a group of nearby campsites and reserve them?

I don't think dinner will start till at least 7, because Martha has told
me she plans on arriving around 6 (and we can't start without the boss, now
can we?  :)).  I plan to get there by 4 pm... anyone going to be there
earlier?  Oh, and is anyone bringing an electric guitar?
