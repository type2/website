My '82 westy (just bought it, I'm new to this game) had 175R14 radials on
it and needed new rubber.  The 'tire store guy' said that there were
certain tires designed for westys (I had heard this before) and they were
8-ply (didn't know what the difference was) so I said &quot;Sure, put them on.&quot; 


Then a friend explains that 8-ply tires destroy suspensions (ndough).  Have
I made a huge blunder?
