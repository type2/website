Subject: Re: Advice Needed: Poptop Seal - 82D Westflailia

The replacement top seal that I got from PartsPlace has hard plastic that
clamps on to the top with no metal.  The seal works great.  I used 3M
weatherstrip cement to attach it, just to be sure.

&gt;I am going to do it!  The old, crusty, rotted seal is going to be 
&gt;replaced.  But with what - and from whom?
&gt;
&gt;I've seen many sugestions for poptop seals.  What do you prefer?  I once 
&gt;read of a seal made with aluminum (rustproof) clips.  Does nayone have 
&gt;any info?  Are the aftermarkets as good as the OEM?  What are my 
&gt;choices?
&gt;
&gt;Your thoughts are invited.
