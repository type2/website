Thanks.  A helpful tip indeed.  My VW dealer wanted $20 for the 'special 
tool'.  

By the way Joel, I'm going to be leaving on a two-week trip down the S. 
Oregon/N. California coast in a couple of days.  What's the best way to 
temporarily discontinue this list?  Am going to miss it, but clearly 
won't have time to get through 2-3 weeks of this traffic!!
