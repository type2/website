Subject: More Advise

Thanks to all for the good advise and input concerning my impending
ownership of a '90 Westfalia (four speed, not 4WD).  In the 24 hours
that I have been on this list I've gained a new found confidence about
water-cooled VWs.  What a great resource, this Internet thing.

Now for more questions if you please...  

The car has 133k miles, virgin heads, and very slight leakage around the
gaskets.  Maintenance records indicate regular oil changes and at least
two coolant changes.  There are TWO plastic tanks in the back, one
behind the license plate (empty) and the other to the left with fluid
(why two?  Are these overflow reservoirs?)  

So, considering what a good deal I got ($8500), I'm prepared to dive
into the engine.  I guess I won't know what condition the heads are in
until I pull em?  If pitted from corrosion they will have to be replaced
or milled?  I had a mechanic tell me the gaskets have to be replaced
every 60k miles, true?

I'm wondering if a complete rebuild is in order.  I have no idea about
oil consumption or compression yet, but considering the mileage I would
sleep better with a new engine under my pillow.

What's the story on performance rebuilds?  I replaced my blown 1970
camper engine with an ATK remanufactured motor (from Holland I think). 
Good option for 1990?  What about headers and all that other bolt-on hot
rod stuff?  

Do water-cooled engines have hydraulic lifters?  Or do I gotta adjust
the valves every 3000k miles like back in my long hair days?

Finally, any good books out there, a water-cooled &quot;Idiot Guide&quot; perhaps?

Opps, one more: those swivel captain's chairs sure are stiff.  Should I
yank 'em off, clean out the dog hair and Grape Nuts and grease the
skids?

Thanks,
John
