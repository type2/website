Subject: aftermarket ignition systems


While browsing thru VWTrends and thinking about vgon improvements i came 
across several aftermarket ignition systems that 'sense' the condition in 
the cylinder via the spark plug and modify the ignition to accomodate.  This 
system included at least wires and a controller box (plus other items, its 
been a while since I saw the ad).  The ad. claimed 10% mpg and hp increases 
on audi, vw and porsche cars.  has anyone installed such a system that could 
verify its performance?

thanks,
Fred Porter
87 syncro with slowly decreasing mpg.
