Subject: paper code coffee?
Date: Wed, 10 Jan 96 19:47:28 PST

Actually, percolators are supposed to be carcinogenic, because of the
boiling.  Long-chain hydrocarbons are formed.  Better to use a paper code
drip system.

Hmmm, the mind boggles...paper code paper cod paper cold paper er...cone

not to worry we were looking for microprocessor/code coffee things.

BTW. Use that fine perkeylater to bile up the water fer yer dripper. Or

do the cowboy coffee thing.

When a colt floats it's ready.
