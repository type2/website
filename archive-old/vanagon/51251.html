&gt;I just got another Vanagon and the guy told me he's been

&gt;
&gt;I checked it out at an auto parts store and Phosphates are not listed
&gt;(on all other brands they are listed) but there are some things that
&gt;could be phosphates disguised--Again, I'm sorry if this is a redundant 
&gt;FAQ, but I need to know.

Typical Prestone DOES have phosphates even though the label doesn't mention
that they're in there.  Prestone also makes a coolant that does NOT have
phosphates.  I believe that it's called something like LongLife 460 or
something like that.  This coolant jug says specifically that it does NOT
contain phosphates.
