&gt; anyone have a number for Transform? or other reliable parts distributors?
&gt; looking specifically for axle assemblies.

If anyone needs CV's only not full axles may I reccomend Transforms
rebuilt CV's, they went only $39 or $49 each last I purchased and
they were quite nice.  Rebuilt in germany in fact, oversized balls
and new high strength cage fitted I guess.  These are their lowest
priced and should IMHO give fine service in a regular Bus as their
primary customers are maniacs with turbo sandrails, etc who eat CV's
for lunch.  I replaced 2 on my old '76 before it was sold with said
CV's and they are going fine after another 15,000 by current owner.
One small gripe though, the inner and outer races both recieved some
sort of anti-wear anti-corrosion coating light grey, looked sort of
like annodized aluminum, and the joints were really really tight.  Plus
the coating made it majorly hard to press onto the splines of the
driveshaft.  Press required, no slipping on, and I don't like to
hammer.  Oh BTW remember, OEM Autobahn CV grease not a bad deal at
about $10 a tube at your local dealer, or use part store Moly EP
for a lot less but does it work?
