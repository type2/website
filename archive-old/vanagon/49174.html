&gt; 
&gt; Just back from two weeks in Germany, with my Vanagon enthusiasm
&gt; much refreshed, and with some parts ideas that may be of
&gt; interest to Vanagon owners.  We visited Darmstadt (where we
&gt; lived when I was in the Army 25 years ago), Heidelberg,
&gt; Rothenburg, castle alley along the Rhine, and Berlin, but the
&gt; rest of this note will try to concentrate on VW content.
