Ruby has a shower instead of an extendaroom off the rear veranda.

Sunshower lives in cargo well during the day, warming to a reasonable 
temperature.  Using the finely crafted churrman schwarzwalder proppenstock to
hold up the rear hatch door, place the sunshower on the skylight (rear window),
attach the modesty curtain, lay out the finely crafted churrman schwarzwalder
shower grate, put your shower kit on the rear cushion along with whatever
else sounds right at the time, like a towel, your tevas, next set of clothes,  
silk sarong or...

Shower for as long as the five gallons lasts, dry off, dress, and emerge into
the world a better person.  Cleanup is trivial, unclip the modesty curtain,
take down the sunshower, remove the finely crafted churrman schwarzwalder 
proppenstock, close the hatch door placing the skylight into it's fully upright
position, fold up the finely crafted churrman schwarzwalder shower grate and
voila' ready to ride.

NB Doesn't work well in the snow, modesty curtain only necessary near philistine
habitation, best done on non muddy surface.

Spent the weekend being a nerdybirder and poppywatcher at Pt Reyes and Bolinas
Lagoon.  Overnight at Olema Ranch CG.  Nice Place, no bottlerockets, nice and
quiet after 10PM fairly cheap $22 Full Hook, could be a CCC location.

Seen:

   Murre
   Caspian Tern
   White Pelican
   Snowy Egret
   White Egret
   Ruddy Duck
   Horned Grebe
   Western Grebe
   Broad bottomed wobbler
   Hairy Chested Nutscratcher
   lots more...
