Subject: Re: window tint, simple green

On the EV, we have 3M titanium (metallized) tint in grey on all windows except
the windshield.

Rear hatch window - 20%  (this is the amount of light allowed in)

Side windows from driver back - 35%
 
Front driver and passenger windows - 50%

In CAL it's supposed to be illegal to tint the front driver and passenger
windows, but 50% is light enough (and non-threatening enough) that most
public safety agencies won't bother you.

I can recommend the metallized tints because there is a noticeable increase
in the ability of the A/C to keep the van cool in triple digit temps.
It also slows the UV breakdown process on your upholstery, blah, blah, blah....

Simple Green:

Works great as an engine cleaner - spray it on a warm (not hot) engine, let it
sit for a bit, make sure your distributor, battery, other electrical delicates
are protected, then blast away with a jet nozzle on your garden hose.
If you've accumulated a lot of oil, dirt, crud, dead animals, etc. on your
engine, this'll get a lot of it off and the upside is that you *may* notice
that your engine will run cooler.  And it's bio-degradable to boot, too.
Oh, and have a can of WD-40 handy just in case you do get some water under your
distributor cap.
