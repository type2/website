Subject: Re: Emissions (CO) still out...

You are correct in the attempt to lean things out.This will drop the hc
levels down to a point, but at some point..maybe around .7%co the mixture
will pass past the stochiometrical  peak at which point the mixture will
become increasingly lean and a lean misfire will occur.You will not really
notice this to the untrained eye or ear, but the hc will start to rise as the
misfires continue.This is how  you can be shure you are at the leanest most
point in the injection circuit.High hc can be caused by lean misfire wash, or
by unburned raw gas from an extremely rich mixture. I have found a
preponderance of vanagons suffer from defective plug wire suppression caps at
some time in their lives. You can ohm this out with a good multimeter or if
you know of someone with a scope,(this is how I find them) you can physically
see the misfire spike.
This will frustrate you and cause a slightly elevated co and higher hc 400
plus.I usually replace the caps with MBZ resistors(BERU) or the entire wire
set if appropriate and within budget.Check these guys out of you still cant
get the mixture down.Give me a ring back with results.Ed.
