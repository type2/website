Subject: LiMBO/Vanagon Drive-In Night


Yesseree folks the second annual Vanagon-list drive-in night as well as the 
first-annual LiMBO drive-in movie night will take place on August 9th at the 
Rustic Drive-In on Route 146 in Smithfield RI....about 20 minutes north of 
Providence. The Rustic is about a mile north of the junction of I-295 and 
Route 146 making it an easy trip from Boston, CT, etc....


The Rustic is a three scree drive-in so there will be something for every 
taste (or lack thereof).

If you need more info, e-mail me.
