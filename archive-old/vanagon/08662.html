Ok, here's a quick one...

	I did the front brakes on my '56 kombi yesterday.  Boy were they a 
MESS!  Brake fluid everywhere!  The shoes didn't look very worn, but 
it looked like one or both wheel cylinders on each side had passed on.
I cleaned everything up real nice and even re-painted the backing plates!

 	After I put the right drum back on, I was hearing a slight scraping, and 
I just figured it was the spiffy new shoes, so I didn't worry about it, but
now it makes loud scrapy-squeeky noises when I drive.  But not when I first
start out, I get about a mile or so and then it starts, like it has to heat
up first to make the noise.

	The bearing looked so-so, not quite over the hill but with a darn good
view of the valley on the other side.  

	Any ideas?  Should I just replace it out of principle?  The brakes are
so radically different now, its like a whole new bus!  And I haven't even 
touched the back ones yet!!

	BTW - This new engine is great!  She starts faster than I can turn the 
key!  I'm going to try to get the new transmission next week.
