since you're the third person to ask, and i notice more than a few
messages where people talk about partners and help, and that some
don't let their partners even drive their buses (what a strange
concept.)  here ya go:)

&gt;How in the HELL could you get her to even try to crawl under the car??!! You
&gt;know what my wife would tell me if I suggested that? Even though she isn't PG

well, i asked her nicely.  i believe it went something like...

she tells me the problem and noises...

&quot;hmmm, well.&quot;, i say, &quot;a flapping noise too?  maybe the CV boot ripped
real bad and is flapping around with a clamp.  would you mind ... [ i
describe what i believe things should look like ] and if that's it
i'll call around and try and get one and figure out how to replace
it.&quot;

she asks if i want to hold on or have her call me back, etc. etc. etc.

mmmm, i love that woman:)  

feeling that life is really good,
			     brandy
