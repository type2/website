&gt; &gt;I would like to go on march 24-26 but feel that I may be out of place with my
&gt; &gt;70 westphalia that is terrible on the outside &amp; ok on the inside.
&gt; &gt; Are all the people there in immaculate restored Kombis? or are there a few
&gt; &gt;buses that need external work like mine?
&gt; 
&gt; Well, I'm planning to show up in a '69 with no paint and rust, and I
&gt; have no shame.  If the others don't like it, they can make me park across
&gt; the road.

Don't feel bad.  I may show up in something other than a VW!!
