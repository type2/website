-- [ From: Thomas D. Hanlon * EMC.Ver #2.3 ] --

It used to be a simple $400 o/o, I'm told, overnight ferry trip from Panama
to Colombia, but Crucero Express folded within the year.  Today, the trip
is about a $2000 experience, one way, on any number of freighters,
including air fare and other expenses for two persons.

We're still researching this one, and after six months, we're still without
an answer.

Please post any positive results you have on this problem.
