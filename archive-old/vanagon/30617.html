Subject: RE: J. C. Whitney error



&gt;The $4.95 outer front wheel bearings were priced at $49.95 --  $99.90 for 
the
&gt;pair.
&gt;
&gt;JCW's customer service lady had no explanation for the error but she was 
very
&gt;nice about setting things right.  Still...  kinda scary.  Given JCW's 
history
&gt;of bankrupcy and financial woes, and knowing a little error like this can
&gt;provide a nice boost to their cash flow, however temporary, I wonder if
&gt;anyone else has experienced a similar decimal shift?

Not I. I've dealt with Whitney for many years, and have never encountered
this sort of problem, nor practically any problem.

My worst gripe about them, is that their packing varies from lousy to
nonexistent. A few crumpled pieces of newspaper rattling around with the
stuff I ordered, does not contribute to cushioning IMHO. But since most
auto parts seem pretty rugged, I guess this doesn't make much difference
in the long run. I've gotten very few things (can't think of any off the
top of my head) that arrived broken.

Favorite Whitney stunt, is when they backorder or factory-ship something.
They send you a notice saying so, which arrives maybe two weeks after you
mail in your order. Often the item being backordered, has already arrived!

Once I ordered a 300W 4-ch amplifier for them. The one that arrived, said
225W 4-ch on it. Means I can only blow out one eardrum at a time, I guess,
instead of both simultaneously. A few years later, I bought another. Same
225W amp arrived. What the hell, they're very cheap, and they work well.
