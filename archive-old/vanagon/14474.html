&gt; &gt;I had a friend rip the fuel pump off my 1800,
&gt; 
&gt; moral of the story.........always interchange the same parts (IMHO),
&gt; pancake engine parts and upright engines use different carbs and #'s of
&gt; carbs!

They are both upright engines.  I should have been clearer.  It is a 
1776cc engine.  But the fuel pumps are different.  Odd.
