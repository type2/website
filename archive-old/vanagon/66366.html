Hello everyone,

In my continuing hunt for that perfect Eurovan, I found a couple that might
be interesting to others:

The EV MV in Southern California is a white MV with 5speed and only 33,000
miles. The price is $13,000. Email me directly and I'll send you the HTML
document from the ad as well as the email I've received from the owners.
I'd go for this one myself, but the seating arrangement of the GL really
suits me better.

The second one is an EV GL priced under $10,000. The ad read as follows:

1993 VOLKSWAGEN EUROVAN GL, automatic transmission, dual air conditioning,
rear cassette, new tires, 7 passenger, burgundy w/tan interior, 46000 MILES
$9950 STAN BENNETT SALES at 619 SE 6th, all indoors. 503-232-7915.
Portland, Or
Fax 503-236-0689

This one has had the left front fender replaced, which they say was the
only damage (i.e.. no auxiliary damage to the windshield, grill, or door.)
I might still be interested in this one if anyone knows of a good body shop
in Portland that could confirm the frame's alignment.
