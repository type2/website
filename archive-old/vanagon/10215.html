I had the same problem with my '92 Jetta TurboD--could be a (U.S.) $0.70 
in-line glow plug fuse.  Same exact symptoms--lotsa white smoke, then an 
eventual fire-up and runs fine until the next cold restart.

&gt; When I mounted the brave charger this afternoon to go to the 
&gt; shops in the snow, it wouldn't work.  The blue thing just sat 
&gt; on the road and grunted at me.  Every time I turned the key, 
&gt; the engine turned normally.  Except it wouldn't fire.
&gt; 
&gt; I trundled down the hill unpowered and tried again.  The 
&gt; wonderful 1.9L diesel engine that does 38.5mpg kept farting and 
&gt; spluttering for nearly ten minutes.  I cranked it about ten 
&gt; times during that period.
&gt; 
&gt; Just as I was about to walk the 100 yards to the shop, the 
&gt; engine chugged into life with an apologetic plume of grey smoke 
&gt; and it has run perfectly since.  FYI, my first task was to go 
&gt; to the VW garage to fill the tank and I mentioned it to one of 
&gt; the mechanics.  He said &quot;Isn't that strange?&quot; and walked away.  
&gt; I guess I owe them too much money.
&gt; 
&gt; Today had the first fall of snow of the winter here, a full 
&gt; quarter inch that lasted all of one hour on the ground.  Maybe 
&gt; the blue thing is frightened?  It might not have seen snow 
&gt; before.
&gt; 
&gt; I wonder what will happen tomorrow ...
