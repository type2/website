WHEW, I bet that feels good, and 120 psi is very respectable no less!

Try some spray chemical noxious toxic stuff right down its throat, after 
putting fuel tank / carb cleaner stuff through first. If this doesn't help, 
then remove the carb, take it inside and using more carb cleaner and a tooth 
brush try to clean things up. If after replacing it no improvement is noted, 
get a rebuild kit, gaskets etc. and take it all apart, noting/sketching how 
you did that, and the number of turns that various adjustment screws were 
set at etc. Tedious. You may need to blow the jets clear, WD-40 works, 
garage air compressor is better. Getting things back in running order takes 
patience as the adjustments WILL be off slightly and you'll need it 
re-tuned. Check out/clean your air filter, fresh oil and no 
sludge/leaves/sediment will let the engine breathe slightly better also. I 
have no idea the $ for a rebuilt carb, check all your options first.
        About the electricals, look inside the engine compartment near the 
tail lights. There should be a bunch of brown wires with lugs at the ends 
all grounded to the metal somewhere (someone help me! it's been too long 
since I had my '71 Westy) These are probably causing your lighting probs, 
cleans then up, WD-40 amd a tooth brush, maybe wire brush and fine 
sandpaper. Replace any lugs that feel weakly connected, they're probably 
down to one or two strands of wire by now. tim s.
