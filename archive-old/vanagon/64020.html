Subject: Speeding Ticket/Apologies/Definitions : No VW Content

Volks,
I apologize to any who thought I had -seriously- had recieved a speeding
ticket in my &quot;new&quot; Diesel Westy. The many serious replies for help in my
contrived condition were doubly humorous to me, but I wished to clear up
a few things I thought were common knowledge on the List:
	If you weren't aware:
1) /F in front of a subject line declares the message is in Fun, refer
to the list rules
2) It is as impossible for a stock Diesel Westy to go UPHILL much less
at 89MPH up a 25% grade, as it is to produce nuclear fission (or fusion)
in room temperature in a jelly glass jar.

I did not get a speeding ticket in West Texas, it was in fun and
physically impossible. Nevertheless I would still not retain Ric due to
his poor targeted outcome within the legal framework.
Regards
Mark B. Magee
