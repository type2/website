Subject: T-SHIRT OFFER CLOSED

Howdy all, and many thanks to those who ordered the shirts. I just posted a
list of all those whose orders I've received. If you didn't get your order in,
and have to have one, e-mail me, and I'll see about it.
However, the order is going to the printers early next week, so time is about
up.
I AM NOT ORDERING ANY EXTRA SHIRTS.
I can't afford to, so don't wait around and see about that later...
Anyway, Thanks again...
