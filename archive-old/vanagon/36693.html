Subject: Re: Rather odd EV 'road test'

&gt; &gt; They claim 115mph w/a 2.5 petrol engine? Sounds reasonable...

&gt; Not to me.  The Eurovan has a lot of frontal area.  I can't believe it
&gt; would go anywhere near that fast!  My guess would be 105, or less.  Anyone
&gt; been faster than that in theirs?  Doesn't hp required go up as the cube
&gt; of speed, or something like that?

Haven't been over some 90 or so in mine but this is a tame US weenie van 
not a European spec van.  Have little doubt 105 is rather easily 
obtainable.  at 80 its doing fine.  Red line would put it probably at 
over 115 I think.  Air resistance force does go up rather quickly.  
Square of speed sounds possible but this 'underpowered' van is not a 
wimpy little van.  How a European spec panel is geared I don't know and I 
don't live where I can safely exceed 100 mph anymore.
