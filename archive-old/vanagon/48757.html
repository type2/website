Subject: RE:  Front Heater Blower Motor Removal

Help!

Has anyone removed the front heater blower motor. I have 
managed to loosen the screws that secure the unit.  It 
appears that the cooling hoses must be disconnected as
well the as the upper dash panel before the assembly can
be removed and disassembled to remove the blower motor.
Can anyone confirm this?  Also, does the steering column
need to be disconnected to raise the dash up enough to
slide out the assembly?

Would appreciate any advice and assistance.  I looked for
advice in the archives, but could not find anything.

Thanks,

Fred
