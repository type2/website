There is no vw content below.  I warned you in the header.

Last I saw on PBS a show called something like 'B-29: Frozen in time'.
[text deleted] Certainly worth seeing if you get excited about really large 
aircooled engines.  I wonder how many valves and carburetors one of 
those engines had?  If you plan on trying to see it, stop reading, I 
am about to ruin the ending.  [remaining text deleted]

I have heard about this, and a real shame that so close to the end it was for
nothing.

I would have a good guess that Bob Hoover might have some interest and insight
on these engines.  I believe that they are/were variants of the Wright Cyclone
engines, radial, air cooled, turbo/or/supercharged . . .
