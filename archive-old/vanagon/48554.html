Subject: Use of Tow Dolly to Move a Vanagon

-- [ From: Thomas D. Hanlon * EMC.Ver #2.3 ] --

Listees,

Has anyone had any experience in moving an inoperative Vanagon a couple of
hundred miles using a Tow Dolly with the rear of the Vanagon mounted on the
TD axle and the front wheels on the road surface?  The Vanagon is without
engine, without spare tire and with one rear tire of questionable
character.

Regards,

Tom Hanlon
