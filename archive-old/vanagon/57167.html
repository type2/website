Food stuff:  in the beginning, we tried to organize this down to
the last detail and invariably had flubs ups waiting for someone
to bring a crucial ingredient for something, only to find out later
they'd decided not to shop up and hadn't bothered to let anyone know.
Things have gotten a lot more relaxed since those days.  :)

Basially, we do evening meals potluck, also breakfast, and lunch
is on your own, since many are out hiking, etc.  Breakfast can be
tricky, since not everyone wakes up at the same time.  For the extra
early or late, things like muffins, etc. seem to work well.

If you have a dietary restriction, it's best to bring your own.  Beyond
that, we all sort of eat anything, although planning around a &quot;theme&quot;
in the past has been a nice thing.  Rather than an ethnic designation
this time, I propose that we get creative and bring things in
galactical shapes:  moons, stars, etc.  Please don't everyone bring
hamburgers.  :)  Anyway, it's easiest if you sign up for the same
TYPE of dish both nights (like one kind of salad the first nite,
and another type the second nite, etc.).  Finger foods are
especially appreciated, as we're not always very organized about
sitting down and eating at the same time, though we do try at times.
Basic categores could be:  entrees, salads, fruit, appetizers,
veggies, desserts, breads, etc., but the sky is the limit.

If you'll e-mail me what type of dish you plan to bring, I'll try
to steer things towards being balanced as much as possible.  High
points for home-made, unusual cuisine.  Bring a LOT to share; somehow
we all see to get more hungry more often when outside.  Homebrew
is especially prized.  So let me know what inspires you.

Foremost, you need to start gathering and packing two things we
never seem to have enuff of (will try to post more soon on suggested
other things to pack):

firewood (bring double what you think you should
ice
oh, and additional things:  folding chairs, and sun screen.

For those of you planning to bring dogs, I'm told this could be
tricky - please call pinnacles and ask ahead of time.  If you need
the number, e-mail me privately, and I'll dig it up for you.

We'll have many newbies on this trip.  For them, especially,
bring anything magnesium you may have to burn (or just other
weird stuff).  We'll explain later.  :)
