&gt;&gt; Wow, Gary what did gas heaters ever do to you???!!! 
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Sorry for creating the stir about the gas heaters.  I just was saying 
&gt;that from personal experience, I will never use one again.  I did have 
&gt;bad experiences with them not working at all.  

Well, the funny thing about it is that this list is one of the few places
where saying gas heaters are bad can cause controversy (this place and a gas
heater engineers convention).  Most sane people would run and hide from
anything that's 20 years old and burns gasoline.  I'd like to say more on
the subject, but the snow's getting bad here and I can't wait to jump in my
bus, fire up that gas heater, and cruise home in the winter wonderland!
