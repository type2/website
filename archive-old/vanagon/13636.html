&gt; This is our dilemma: we adopted a declawed cat, that as far as we know,
&gt; never ventured outside a home. We could ask friends to take care of him in
&gt; our absence, but we're also thinking about taking him along. Before we
&gt; spend any time getting him acquainted with nature, we're wondering if
&gt; anyone on this list has had any experience with taking a cat on a camping
&gt; trip and would like to share it with us. (No worries: either way, we'll do
&gt; whatever is in the best interest of the cat!)
&gt; 
&gt; TIA for your opinions!

When I was but a wee lad, well okay when I was younger we took family 
trips in a Westy.  We only brought our cat once.  I wasn't that bad for 
this particular cat since he followed us around like a puppy.  However it 
was much more inconvient for the cat 'stuff' litter box and all.  He was 
not declawed but that wouldn't matter very much UNLESS you meet some 
other animal when you aren't quick enough to defend your cat.  I think 
that the biggest problem was that we usually went to National Parks and 
the like.  You might have trouble with finding places that would let you 
bring your cat.  I don't normally travel with any of the domestic 
carnivores  (cats, dogs or ferrets) now except to ferret events.
