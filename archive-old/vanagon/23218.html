	Ok, sign me up for a Bay-area-to-points-south (SF/Oakland to
Atwater/Gilroy/Salinas/Monterey leg- but since it'll likely be
in the Corrado, Bob, you'll have to leave that type I engine home. :)

	Martha, besides the Isetta and Messerschmidt (which were
NOT left-over Bf-109 fuselages), there were also 3 wheelers built
in the UK before the war, and a couple of kit/homebuilt vehicles
available in the US in the 70s/80 with seats for 2 and a 750cc motorcycle
engine and rear-suspension. I recall one such hybrid had genuine
VW front suspension :). There used to be one parked at a house
on Saratoga Avenue- I'll look for it tonight if I ever go home.
One style had side-by-side seating in a fiberglass thingy that
did look a lot like the front of a jet. The other had side-by-side
seating (this was the one with VW front suspension). Check the
library's 70s and 80s Popular Science &amp; Popular Mechani back issues.

	I believe the Brit 3 wheelers had a tax advantage since they
were classed Motorcycles rather than Cars- I seem to recall that the
Isetta had four actual tires- two in back very close together. Someone
who went to the same church as my family in Arlington Virginia in the
middle 60s had one. Anyone know if German tax law classed them as
Cars or Motorcycles?

	Someone with a Brit 3 wheeler drove across the USA a few years
ago and published the story in Road &amp; Track. Sigh- I remember when they
were good!

	Cheers!
	Bill
