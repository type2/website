&gt; PS- another friend said take this opportunity to put in an 1800 instead

&gt; plug-and-play thing, or require other work also?

Heh.  Some friend.  :)  I'm plotting to do just the opposite.  I don't
see any reason why you would want the 1800.  Parts are not significantly
cheaper, and certainly not worth the hassles of having the wrong engine
in the van.  For instance, wouldn't the decrease in displacement mess
up your fuel injection?  I bet I could think of a dozen more reasons
why you should *not* go down to 1.8 liters, but I'll start with that one.
