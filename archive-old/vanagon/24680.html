Subject: Alaska trip/ Blue Nelson

All suggestions on this subject seem to be good advice so far. I was also
thinking of Blue Nelson, the fellow that drove his Dormobile from Southern
California up to the Artic Circle a year ago (Summer of '94) with a couple
of friends. Possibly, or someone who happens to know him could interview him
to see if he has specific do's and don'ts for this kind of a trip. I know
that one of his &quot;don'ts&quot; would be not to dump your Dormobile on it's drivers
side (Left side)en route as he did. I don't know Blue personally, but he
seems to be a nice/talented young guy.
