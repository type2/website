Subject: Leaning tower of Westy

I was walking up to my '88 Westfalia, and something looked odd. Looking more
closely, it thought that it was leaning to one side. I had just inflated the
tires that
morning, so I knew it was not a flat tire. So I went and got a tape measure
and measured from the center of the wheels to the lip of the fenderwell.
While the rear was within 1/2&quot; the front had a full 1&quot; difference between the
right and left sides. (The driver's side is lower.)  I know that the camper
equipment does give the van a left side weight bias but given that the water
tank is empty and there is nothing in the cabinents, should I expect a full
1&quot; list to port?  Oh, the PO claimed the van has never been in an accident -
and there is no evidence that would suggest such.

What could be the culpret?
