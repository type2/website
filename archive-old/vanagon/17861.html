Subject: fuel gauge &amp; sunroof drain

I almost forgot these two questions.  
        1.  My fuel gauge seems to only work for the first 1/2 tank, at 
which time it goes to empty.  Any suggestions?

        2.  The drain holes in my sunroof don't drain.  I tried to blow the 
blockage out with air hose, which I thought got all the crud out, but the 
driver side failed my water test.  I suspect the drain tube got rusted into 
the passenger compartment.  The water flows in through the seat belt mount 
bolt on the pillar, and any where else it feels like coming through the 
headliner.  I came up with the idea of running a flexible plastic tube down 
the hole and seal it to the edge of the drain hole with silicon sealer.  
When I got about 3ft of hose down the hole, I noticed it came right through 
the headliner(one more hole to patch) and was wrapped around the steering 
wheel.  Had to give up to go to work.  Any other possible remedies?
