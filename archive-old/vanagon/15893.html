Subject: 77 Airflow meter


I think I am looking for a airflow meter
for the '77 fuel rejection.  Mine has some wonderful 
spots that have no carbon.  Doesn't run really good
like that.
 
I am also looking for CV joints perhaps.

Mail me and we will work something out...
 

OOOhh, I am still working on getting th turtlee bus
scanned in.  Its too large for a IIsi to handle :(
