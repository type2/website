Subject: '83s For Sale



To all wannabusses!!

Well, the time has come.  A business opportunity forces the
reluctant sale of my '83 Vanagon GL.  It has a bunch of miles
(166k) on it but it got an overhaul 40k ago and a reseal 15k 
ago.  It is a wasserboxer with NO leaks!  And if you ask, I'll 
tell you the secret of sealing a wasserboxer.  It has had a diet
of Castrol GTX its entire life at regular 3k intervals.

It's a GL 7 passenger in brown with a 4 speed.  It doesn't have 
air or power steering or power windows.  It does have power brakes.  
It is relatively straight (someone dragged their bumper down the
side door), has no rust, has a new windshield, and comes with a 
_complete_ set of spares (another '83 GL!)  It also has an extra
complete set of tyres (thanks to TFORHAN.)  It runs strong and I
have been extremely pleased with its reliability.  You would be 
purchasing from this bus's second owner.

They are located in NE Oregon near Pendleton.

I'm asking $2950 for the pair and we can negotiate.
