Subject: Re: Kitchen H2O pump-replacement?

Discussion has taken place regarding westy water pumps in the drinking water
tanks.
I have an '83 westy that is in need of a different pump. It gets warm as in
getting current but doesn't pump water. The bus is in extra super condition
but has needed several items replaced due to LACK of use and dryness.
(enough to make the east coast folks cry). I have been told that a
replacement is a small bilge pump that is sold in the Wal-Mart/K-Mart type
of stores in the fishing-outdoor departments. This is an acceptable
substitution for stock or high priced R/V suppliers as long as the purchaser
takes the time to make sure that the specifics of voltage and flow (and of
course water proofing/electrics!!) are the same. Cost estimated at $20-30
range as a guess. I intend to try it as soon as the next pay check hits my
wallet.
Does anyone have a substitute or insight on this subject that hasn't been
discussed?
