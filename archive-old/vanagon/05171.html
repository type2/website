I just went and checked the as-installed-by-Sears pressure on my new
Trailhandlers.  For the record, they are:

&quot;Trailhandler Radial A-T&quot;
Load Range C, Max Load 1435 lbs, max press. 50 psi
LT195-75R14
$59.95 each

The left one was at 34 psi, the right one 30.  I pumped them both up to
44 psi.  Ride is slightly improved, but not much.  Still very squirelly.
While I'm running amuk, let me throw in some more data.

The tires on the rear that the Trailhandlers replaced were Michelin XA4's.
215/70/14 M+S Max Load 1554 lbs, max press. 35 psi.  These tires are just
a wee bit taller than the 195/75/14 Trailhandlers - maybe half an inch, but
a whole helluva lot wider.  I wish I had kept them.  They were rock solid
on the road.  Crosswinds never bothered me.  Guess I fell victim to the
&quot;grass is greener&quot; syndrome.

On the front of Da Boat are Yokohama &quot;Radial 371 A-II&quot;'s.  Bought them used,
but they were almost new.  They have lasted me a long, long time and just
keep on going.  I must have gone through 3 (used) sets of Michelin MXL's
during the first 1/4 of tread loss on the Yokos.  I have had them on both
ends of the bus at times and they are a great all-around tire.  They are
6 ply, btw (2+2+2).

The following is for the Trailhandlers...

	My bus is probably heavier than most, especially in the rear.  High
top, 2 extra group 27 deep cycle batteries, Fridge, stove, lots of cheap
particle-board furniture, tons of extra parts, etc etc etc...  Maybe I 
should rename it lard butt.

In conclusion, I *still* think the Trailhandlers suck.  I just don't think
there is enough TIRE in contact with the ground to keep all that weight in
line.  I'll probably end up moving them to the front and going back to wider
tires in the rear...
