Subject: One prob. down, another comes up.

Well netters,

In the ways of the world, no good deed ever goes un punished, and no
successful repair does not turn up something else.

I successfully replaced the clutch cable for the '71 Van. It was 
most of a very greasy morning. HINT: Cut the end of the cable off
in front of the lever arm, pull it out, THEN unscrew the wingnut.
(Does anybody make wingnuts with extra-big wings? Sure would be nice)
I spent most of my time trying to manufacture a replacement for the
'clevis pin' that would not hit the front moutning bolt to the pivot
arm. What a pain, but fixed. I got my cable from BFY, and found them
to be quick, correct, and middle-priced. I just hope that this cable
will last another 23 years.

At the same time, I decided to try swapping back in the original dual-
hose distributor for the 009 to cure the flat spot from 1000-2000 RPM.
Well, I put in new points and condensor, gapped it, and put it in.
Turned the key, and it idled right up. Good sign. Pulled on the
accel, and it died. Bad sign.

Spen about 20 minutes tinkering, and finally decided that I had the hoses
backwards. Put the back hose from the carb on the front of the dist. can,
and it then began accelerating. Good Sign. I timed it to 5 ATDC, and it
still accelerated. So I decided to see how far it would advance.
Well, as soon as I crack the accelerator, it goes from 5 ATDC to 10 BTDC,
then NEVER MOVES. 11 or 12 degrees is all I can coax from it all the way
to 3500 RPM. Bently mentions like 20-25 degrees max. When I try to turn
the rotor, it turns a little, so the weights are not messed up. Mabye.

I took it for a spin. At idle, it accelerates easily, smoothly up to
3500 RPM. But as soon as my foot comes off the gas, or I start going
down a hill, it starts to make funny 'POINK-POINK-POINK-BLAM'
backfires and other nasty noises.

What is going on here? I am at a loss with this problem, and I need 
the Bus operational real soon to help me move into my first house. 
I am willing to try anything, and I will prob. go back home now
and pull the dist. and dismantle it to check the mechanical advance.

Any body experienced this type of problem? Hints? I wish I had another
dual-vacuum distributor around.

Despair.
