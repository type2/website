Subject: Thanks to all

Just wanted to thank all of you who responded with ideas and advice for me!
Thanks to the kind people of this group I made an aware purchace, and now
oficially own an '88 Westie!

I knew I was getting great advice from the group when the mechanic who
checked
out the Westie inturrupted my list of things to check with &quot;You sure are
unusually
informed about these vehicles...&quot;  

Again, thanks to all.
