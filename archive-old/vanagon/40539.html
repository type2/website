A dim memory.. reading of a Tatra, a Czech car.  Aircooled by an induction 
system.  The cylinders were shrouded with tin with an exit nozzle on one 
side, inlet on other.  The exhaust was blown out the centre of the cooling 
nozzle tin and created a venturi effect that sucked air past the cylinders.  
Supposedly noisy, wonder why?  Tim Smith
