Subject: 1980 VW Vanagon Camper for sale

Location is Bainbridge Island, WA. It's strong and clean, fun to drive,
and great to stay in once you get there. 

Check it out - pictures and specs on the Web at:

If you're seriously interested, let me know. I just let the insurance
lapse (I bought another vehicle) and I have to get it renewed before
anyone can drive it.
