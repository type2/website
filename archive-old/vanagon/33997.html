&gt;My vanagon was rear ended. I found this small black box (crushed) right
&gt;behind the paasenger side tail light housing (also crushed :) ). It is made
&gt;by VDO and has the VW part number 251 907 393B. Can anyone tell me what it
is
&gt;and what it is for?
&gt;
&gt;From its location &amp; description (not the p/n), I believe it is the idle
control unit.
