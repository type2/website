The Inuvik Run -- Second Whitehorse

5 &amp; 6 August

0810 5 Aug 1996  -- Departed Dawson for Whitehorse.  Grocery stop
at Partridge Farm.  Overcast and cool.  Spent the time sketching. 


Encountered light rain near Pelly Crossing.  The rain stayed with
us all the way into Whitehorse, heavy at times as we motored along
the marge of Lake Laberge.

Camped at Wolf Creek Campground, prepared for another two-day stay
as we wait for the group that took the Top of the World Highway
into Alaska from Dawson.

The group will splinter here, some heading for Skagway to catch the
ferry home.  Sue Booth is bound for Fairbanks.  Alaskan Dave split
after a day in Inuvik.  Dennis will probably stay in Alaska, not
coming back with the group.  I've no idea what happened to Seattle
Eddy.  Made camp in a light rain.

In a neat quid pro quo I try to find a replacement for Sue Booth's
propane regulator while she adds my duds to hers at the local
laundromat.  She returns my clean clothes all neatly folded but
I've been unable to find a replacement regulator; she will head for
Alaska without a stove or means of heating her camper.  To repay
her laundress duties I install a reading light over her bunk.

The group continues the custom of taking supper together.  My
contrabuition was:

                Beans la Boom

  Makes enough for two hungry people or four sissies.

  1 pound seasoned beef sausage
  1 large white onion
  1 clove garlic
  1 package Lipton's dried French Onion Soup mix
  1 medium can of pork &amp; beans
  1 medium can of refried beans
  1 cup spicy barbacue sauce
  about half a cup of tart brown mustard  
  Ground black pepper
  Couple of glugs of cheap plonk

Slice up the sausage and start it browning in your skillet. Keep
stirring.

Dump the pork &amp; beans into your coffee can (*) and start heating
them up.  When hot, add the Lipton French Onion Soup mix.  Keep
stirring.  Slosh in some wine if it looks too dry.  When the soup
mix is absorbed by the beans, open the can of refried beans and add
them to the pork &amp; beans.  Keep stirring.  Slosh in a little wine.

When the sausage is browned (not too dry), dump it into a pie pan. 
Slice up the onion and start it browning in the skillet.  There
should be a little grease from the sausage.  Peel &amp; smash the clove
of garlic and throw it in with the onions.  Add a little black
pepper.  Keep stirring.  When the onions are browned throw in a
little wine and add the barbacue sauce and the mustard.  Keep
stirring.  Mebbe you should add a little more wine.  Fold the
sausage back into the skillet with the browned onions and sauce. 
Keep stirring.  When everything is hot and all the gunk is scraped
off the skillet, pour the mess into the coffee can with the beans.

Be careful not to add any salt.  The sausage, beans and dried soup
mix already have too much salt in them.  Add more wine as needed.

---------------------
(*) Note on camp cooking:  I have two skillets, a big one and a
little one, plus a pair of pie pans. The skillets are my only
permanent cookware.  The pie pans serve as lids and plates and
anything else a pie pan is suitable for.  All of my pots are tin
cans.  The big pot is a three-pound coffee can.  I have about a
dozen cans in six sizes, from the big coffee can down to a Vienna
sausage can.  I use the cans for a trip or two then throw them
away, replacing them as needed.  If you pick the right sizes they
will nest together.

To bake on your Coleman stove, select a baking pan a little smaller
than the surface of the stove.  Light the burners and put the
baking pan atop a pair of small cans to hold it above the burners. 
Put two layers of aluminum foil under the baking pan to act as a
heat shield and diffuser.  Then build an enclosure over the baking
pan using aluminum foil fastened to the back &amp; sides of the Coleman
stove.  Leave a vent at the top rear.  Use two or three layers of
foil for the enclosure (the heavy stuff works best).  If the
enclosure feels like it's losing too much heat, add another layer.

The secret here is having a baking pan that's just the right size,
one that allows about an inch of space on all sides.  Too big a
pan, the bottom gets too hot.

A pan of bisquits takes about 20 minutes with both burners on low. 
Fancy stuff, like cakes or muffins takes a little longer.  Bread
takes about 40 minutes.  For roasts, beans and other things that
need to be cooked slowly at low heat it's best to use a Dutch oven
and coals from the campfire.

Camp notes:
It rained off &amp; on during our two-day stay at Wolf Creek but the
group had enough tarps to keep themselves dry.  The communal meals
were happy affairs, especially when we dug into the pies and fresh
roasting ears from Partridge Farm.

The Beans la Boom lived up to their name.
  
I use a plastic oil drain pan as my dishpan.  It is also my bath
tub.  I have a large (LARGE!) stainless steel bowl for rinsing the
dishes or taking a serious bath.  I contribute both to the communal 
dishwashing, failing to mention their other uses.  

Bob Heintz has an enameled coffee pot the size of demijon.  Each
morning it attracts a circle of zombie-like caffine addicts
standing like supplicants, cup in hand.

I am one of the few smokers in the group.  I've brought four pipes
with me, generally have one smoldering.  If awake and puffing, I
seem to be bothered less by mosquitos than the non-smokers..
