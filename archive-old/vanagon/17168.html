Subject:      dash fans

for those of you who want to consider the dash fans, Hella make several
models for just that purpose. nicely finished in black plastic (sorry,
no brown for the brown-interiored buses). even one little round tube-like
jobber available with a heater (for defrosting the windshield or rear
hatch window).

i don't have the model numbers here, but if anyone wants them, i'll post
them to the list tonight.
