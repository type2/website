Subject: Bay Area Vanagon Get Together Sunday

As posted previously, I suggested a brunch in Castro Valley, Noon 
Sunday.  Details following.  In addtion, Martha's students are having 
recital at 3-5pm, her house.  And Bill Abbott is going to to be singing 
'Stairway to Heaven.'  So, anyone is welcome to come Martha's house 
to listen to Bill sing.  And, perhaps there will even be a velour orgy in 
the spa afterwards.  So this can be a full fledged Vanagon Bash!

Please mail me if you want to go to Brunch.  Right now Martha and myself 
are willing to, and Dave Kautz sounds like he might want to go.
I can make reservations if there are enough people that want to go to 
brunch.  If you need directions to Martha's, email Martha at:

Repost of Brunch offer:

I thought I would call a little Vanagon/Bay Area Brunch.

It's at JD's in Castro Valley.  It's at 2837 Castro Valley Blvd., and at 
about 12 Noon.  Martha's keen on the idea, so that's two of us.

Good food, and plenty of it, priced starting at $5 for the meals.  A la 
carte items are available as well.  Rumour has it that they also serve 
really good beer and Mimosas.  There's somthing about them having good 
pie as well, but after good beer, who cares.  :)
I have a menu I can FAX out if anyone wants to see what they have.

	WHAT: Brunch 

	WHERE: JD's, 2837 Castro Valley Blvd.  Castro Valley, CA
	
	WHEN: May 21, 12 Noon

	WHY: What the hell, and they got beer and good coffee.

	OTHERS: This can be considered a Bodega Bay logistics meeting.

	DIRECTIONS: Take 580 to Castro Valley.  Take the Strobridge exit, 
		and turn north (left from 580W, right from 580E).  Go to 
		Castro Valley Blvd., turn right.  It's about 1 mile up on 
		the right.
