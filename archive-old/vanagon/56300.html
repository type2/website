Subject: MPG &amp; Gauges on '81 Westie

We took our &quot;new&quot; '81 Westie out for a real drive today, and we were
getting 12 miles per gallon.  This is hilly country at about 4000' of
elevation.  Is this normal mileage?  If not, what do we check.  I have
replaced plugs, cap, rotor, etc.

Also, what is a good source for Gauges.  I think I want to add oil
pressure, volts, head temp, oil temp.  What gauges are really useful?  Any
suggestions on a good looking installation?

Thanks,


Bill
