hmmmmm. when you moved the 'whole thing' over to the 84, did you move the
coolant temp sensors as well (oh, god! is he gonna start THAT again!?).
the reason i ask is that my gauge went wacko, and for some reason, i
suspected the gauge sender, not the engine. so i replaced it ... surprise!
the gauge works again. now, this is NOT the coolant temp sensor for the
computer. there should be TWO senders on the thermostat housing: one for the
gauge and one for the computer.

my train of thought here is that maybe the gauge sender was bad all along.
and the initial dealer just 'fixed' the thermostat to make the gauge 'look'
normal.

just a thought.

Good question Joel. I did test the temperature sensor, the one for the temp
gauge. I rulled it out as the source of the problem. When I took the whole
thermostat housing from 84 to the troubled 83, I swapped the sensor so that
the gauge will read temp from the same sender.

I have to start THAT again someday. Right now the westfalia is sitting on
my drive way getting sun burn. I was told that the frig has not been ignited
even once. The oven was used probably 4 or 5 times to cook coffee. The upper
bed has never been slept. the lower bed has been less than 5 times. The propane
tank was filled once only. The water tank was filled once. The ..... once...

I let it rest in peace for now. After two gallons of the autobaun stuff coolant
spent, I kinda want to take a break.
