	My friend Lorne agrees with that rather long-winded posting
that concludes the &quot;Good Times&quot; virus is a hoax, but adds:

It is possible, however, to embed ANSI sequences in Email that will
redefine function keys to do fun things like &quot;rm -rf *&quot; or &quot;format c:&quot;.
You don't even see them on your screen.  I would never do anything like
that myself, of course.  Heh heh heh.

	I don't know if that's actually possible- I suspect that it
is in DOS...
