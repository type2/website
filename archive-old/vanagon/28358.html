Subject: Non-Vanagon Factory Tools For Sale

I posted this to the newsgroups but I'll post here also since some of these
tools may apply to air cooled Vanagons or busses and splitties. There are NO
late model Vanagon tools in this post. I have some for sale, but this will
have to await another post.

If you have other VWs, read on. If you are on the corrodo list or an audi or
porsche list, perhaps you could repost there.

Volkswagen Factory Tool Blowout Sale

You're not likely to see a something like this again any time soon. The 
following factory tools are to be sold back into the VW dealer network but 
they are first being offered to hobbyists (and independent shops) at deep 
discount prices--33% of the list prices listed below--that's a 66% discount.

The prices below are 1993 DEALER PRICES, that is, these are the prices 
dealers were paying to purchase these tools from Zelenda in 1993. Actual 
Zelenda prices today are typically higher, sometimes much higher. Where a 
price is given as $0 pricing information is incomplete or still being gathered.

All tools are in good, used condition. None of these tools apply to 
Vanagon, so far as I know (let me know if I'm wrong!). Some of the 
newer tools, such as those for Eurovan, are brand new. Some of these tools 
apply to Porsche, some to Audi, most to Volkswagen. Additional tools are 
available but not listed at this time; email any special tool# requests. Some 
tools listed below have been discontinued and this is the only way you are 
likely to obtain them. Many tools below are available at Baum in 
Florida for roughly double the price given below. Bids for the entire 
collection will be considered.

To find out which tools apply to you, look in your Bentley manual 
and/or study your Zelenda catalog (factory tools catalog). If you are 
comitted to your vehicle, consider buying without hesitation any tool listed 
below that applies to you.

Shipping is extra and there is a $10 surcharge for all orders under $50. My 
name is Derek Drew, an active, respected and known member of the Vanagon

NW. In some cases, tools can be personally delivered between the three 
locations mentioned above.Tools will be sold into the Volkswagen dealer 
network as soon as arrangements for this can be completed.
