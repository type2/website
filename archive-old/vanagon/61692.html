I'm soliciting opinions from Listees as to what you recommend to run for
tire pressures in an '85 Westy, usually kept ready for camping.  Not too
much extra weight, maybe including water- 600 lbs extra.  We have the
Yokohama Y370 tires which we love.  Most of our driving will be high speed
highway but some back roads, no off roads (at least not planned ones).

Thanks in advance for opinions.
