At the &quot;National Air &amp; Space Museum&quot; in DC, a display was in the
process of being built in the lunar landing theme area.
There was a lunar landscape set up and a fork lift sat in the middle
of the scene, not in use.  The display was obviously not completed,
as there were wires and stuff coming up through the floors (not to
mention the presence of the forklift).  A little kid pointed at the
forklift and said to her mother &quot;Was that thing on the moon?&quot;
I was humored, but polite enough not to laugh out loud.
Mommy replied &quot;No, It's probably only a model of the real one&quot;


Cheers
