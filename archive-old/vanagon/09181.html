&gt; To build this size ( 1835cc 92mm X 69mm) engine you must split the case to 
&gt; have the case bored.  It is true that there are &quot;slip in&quot; kits for 87mm and 
&gt; 88mm bores.  With a stock crank, this gives 1641 and 1678cc.  The 87mm is a 
&gt; safe way to go- altough there are as many opinions about motors as there are 
&gt; people.  The 88mm is generally not recomended.  There is some confusion on 
&gt; what flycutting is.  Flycutting removes metal from the large flat area on 
&gt; the heads.  This is done to either increase compression ratio or to flatten 
&gt; the heads-cylinders mating surface.  Under no circumstances have your heads 
&gt; flycut to increase your compression ratio- this is a great way to burn up a 
&gt; motor.  To fit the case and heads with the 92mm jugs both the case and the 
&gt; heads will have to be machined.

Thanks for the correction Chris.  I didn't mean to imply that the compression
ratio should be increased - merely that the diameter of the combustion
chamber be increased.  I was also wrong about not having to split the case.
I forgot about having to widen the holes for the cylinders... DOH!  

As for terminology, I always thought &quot;flycutting&quot; referred to the use of a 
circular lathe to widen/deepen the combustion chamber, whereas &quot;milling&quot; 
refered to removing metal from the large flat area on the heads, usually 
done by running the head across a different type of lathe which removes a 
couple of thousandths each pass.  Milling doesn't do squat to VW heads
though, cause the mating surface is recessed.  In any case, you are correct
on all counts.
