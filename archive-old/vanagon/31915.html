Subject: Re: why I don't have a Subaru...




 I really think we VW guys are spoiled by the quality and
&gt; reliability of the VW...is the grass really greener?  Try selling
&gt; your '83 Subaru for over $1000 regardless of the mileage....then
&gt; put your '79 westy with 200K on the ticker and see the phone ring
&gt; off the hook.  
 
It's a lovely story about your 75 subaru wagon, but the transplant we 
are discussing is a 93 Subaru engine, which provides 130HP and should 
be cheaper to maintain than a 1.9L waterboxer.

As for the argument regarding selling a 83 subaru vs. a 79 Westie?  
Well,  as far as I know when you put a subaru engine into your VW you 
still have a VW, and I may be way offbase, but I think anyone who is 
into Vanagons would probably be REAL interested in looking at a 
Vanagon with 130HP and 1993 technology in a completely stealth 
conversion.  But like I said,  I may be way offbase ;-)
