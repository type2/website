&gt;Only problem that I could detect (I was only doing about 20 mph)
&gt;was that braking would cause the bus to pull left big time.  
&gt;Braking to turn left was like having power steering:-)  Turning right was
&gt;another story.

I had the same - no, opposite - problem.  After not driving for a year I had
a pull to the right big time.  When I first would hit the break it would
pull hard, but then brake straight (in the new direction, of course).  I
replaced all the front brake parts (a very quick job) and highly recommended
it.  The cylinders were only $10 each, shoes about $15 for the set, and
another $12 each for the hoses (why not? - just how thick is the front of
your bus?).  

BTW - The parts guy said that you can't find the bleeder valves anymore so
be careful removing the old ones - ya right.  After checking every VW place
in Portland, OR and loosing all hope I stopped by the local auto parts store
and found the bleeders no problem.

And *REALLY* BTW!  Don't over-torque those lug nuts!  Don't take even take
the wheels off the drums.  I bought new tires and the shop had to pay for
turning the drums.  Turn the drums with the wheels on the drums and don't
take them off.  Some say balance tires at the same time while the wheel is
bolted to the drum.
