  &quot;It took Volkswagen awhile, but they finally did just that in the past 
couple of years by superseding various Waterboxer Fan Switches to the 
present one being offered that turns at about 72C (I believe).  The old
321-959-481 &amp; 251-959-481 Series switches listed in ye old microfiche 
films turns on at about 82 to 85C.&quot;

  So, my old Bentley manual shows the diesel low speed switch is supposed 
to cut in somewhere between 93 and 98 degrees C, while the high speed 
switch waits until 100 to 106 degrees.  Since they haven't imported 
Vanagon diesels since 1983, they probably haven't given any thought to 
updating that to something like the 72 degree switch have they?

  Just as a first measure, switching the leads between the low and the 
high speed fan circuits  to these two switches will at least give the 
high speed to you if the low speed switch ever gets hot enough to switch 
the lower temp switch on.

  Could the person who found a FLAP source for a range of switches that 
will fit please repost the lead?  Thanks.
