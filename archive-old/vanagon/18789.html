Hello,


    I have been reading this list for about 2 weeks now and i find it
  very interesting, i am 17 years old and i am currently restoring a 1962
  camper van. I bought the van about half a year ago from a garage near my home
  in South England for 200 pounds, it was not in a good state and i have 
  spent all this time restoring it. This weekend i hope to put the axles back
  on so it can be moved for spraying (it's sitting on axle stands in primer).
  My driving test is on the 3 July so i am hoping it will be done by then.
  The van had been sitting in a field for 3 years before i bought it so
  you can imagine what the body work was like, in all the bottom 6 inches has been
  rewelded. The bit that has taken the most time is the rubbing down for spraying
  because sombody had painted the van with a paintbrush and some Dulux paint.
  I have been visiting all the show's i can but i am still looking for some 
  complete safari windows, which i think would top my van off. Can anybody help!!
  

Thanks, 
             Ben Ryan
