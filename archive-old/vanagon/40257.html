Subject: Re: 69 bus for sale ....


I saw this bus! it had to be the one.  I was crusing east on I94 
yesterday and comming the other way was a very purple '69.  Accept for 
the paint job, and the looking across a devided highway at 75mph factor 
it looked pretty nice.  just thought I'd let ya know.
