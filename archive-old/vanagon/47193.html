anyway.  What type of things since the &gt; Bus has sat ffor two years should
I change or inspect ffor sure during this &gt; revival attempt ??? It has the
2.0 FI motor &gt; in it.  BTW it has two batteries in the engine compartment
I don't have a &gt; manual but I'm guessing that the one on the passenger
side is for starting &gt; the Westy and the one onthe drivers side is ffor
appliances (IE FFrige) can &gt; anyone give me an idea which is which do I
have this guessed correctly ???? &gt; Thanks in advance. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Chris Jacobs

Hi Chris,

Little things you should check and maybe replace are:

1. Replace all the vacuum hoses.
2. Replace the rotor and the platinum, and check the rotor cap for any 
cracks.
3. Change the air filter.
4. Change the spark plugs.
5. Change the oil.
6. Check the control unit (computer).
7. Check the fuel pressure and the injectors to see if they are clean.
8. Take a little piece of sandpaper (125) and clean all the electrical 
connections.
9. Check if all the hoses are in place.

			*And that's about it*

Concerning the second battery, you are right that's for the fridge. The 
manual says that this battery keeps things cool inside the fridge while 
you are traveling. When you get to your destination you should connect to 
AC. 
Good luck,

Angel
