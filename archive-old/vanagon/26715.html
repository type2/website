Subject: Re: Cargo capacity

Just last week, as I cleaned out a local persons shed,
I was carrying an even dozen engines, from stripped blocks
to turnkey packages. Only leaked a little oil onto the rubber
mat, too. Also about 40 pieces of tin, 7-8 cylinder heads,
10 intake manifolds, two fenders and a couple of flywheels.
I could not see out the back.

I also once had 20 bags of limestone gravel and 25 bags of topsoil
in the bus. Not nice on the busses frame, and the only time I
have not been able to climb a hill in first gear. Had to go out of
the parking lot backwards.

A few years ago, we jammed it with bales of straw, stapped another 12 
on the top, and drove it for an hour. I still find straw in 
nooks and crannies.

But, I still like the pictures of Joel (??) carryiung the car frame
on the roof of his bus.
