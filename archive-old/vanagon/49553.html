Subject: CCC Mammoth Update  :-)
From: Mark &amp; Kath &lt;markath_at_qnet_dot_com&gt;

Greetings from a touch of fall in the Eastern High Sierra!

Mark and I decided to make some signs for the CCC Campout - to make it 
easier for you all to find us. Keep an eye out for a *BIG* BRIGHT PINK 
SIGN with a VW emblem and CCCs on it. It will point the way into Pumice 
Flat GROUP Campground.  

There will be another *BIG* BRIGHT PINK SIGN at campground information 
board that will have information flyers in it. PLEASE STOP AT THIS SIGN 
AND GET A FLYER. It will give you important information that will make 
setting up camp a lot easier. It also has directions to the local hot 
spots - like the FREE HOT SHOWERS and the STORE - to mention a few.

There will be *SMALL* BRIGHT ORANGE SIGNS at each site marker that give 
the maximum number of cars and people allowed at each site.

CCC Central is at Site #4 - the site that allows the most people and 
car. (10 cars and 50 people) Park there if you want to be right in the 
center of things. The other sites are REALLY close and we who choose to 
camp in them will walk to CCC Central for group stuff - like meals - 
campfire - and major kicking back!!! Bring your beach chairs!!!

Our local hot VW mechanic, Kevin Hickey, will be stopping by Saturday 
morning for a short visit. He is a GREAT guy and has done some pretty 
fantastic things to his bus. I'm sure some of you tech weenies out 
there are going to want to take a look at it. Kevin is WAY understated 
and told me that he's kind of embarrassed to be a show off - but I 
assured him that you would all LOVE to meet him and take a look at his 
ultra trick bus.

For any of you who might be interested, there is going to be a music 
festival going on the whole time you're here. It's called Mill Pond 
Music Festival and it's going to be at Mill Pond which is down by 
Bishop. (Kinda far - but I thought I'd at least offer) Mark has to go 
to it one of the days to display his beautiful hand built guitars, but 
he'll be with us most of the time. 

If there is anything else that either of us can do to make your visit 
more fun - PLEASE email us and we'll do our best to help you out. 

We're going to have a BLAST!

Kath

P.S. I would like to make a call to Bruce Simurda - the editor of Hot 
VWs - and ask him if he would be interested in an article about us and 
our campout. Do any of you have any ideas on that? I think it would be 
really cool - what do you think?
