&gt;I have discovered that Kelly Blue Book publishes a volume for older vehicles. 
&gt;The current issue is May-August 1966, '76--89 Cars and Trucks.  My credit
&gt;union has a copy that members can read, but not copy or remove from the
&gt;premises.

I have seen the Blue Book for older cars at the library.
