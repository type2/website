And to add to Joel's Van Paint scheme list..

Paisley:  People who have the vulgarity to appreciate paisley tend to be
lawyer types and we all know about them.  They snivel and poke fun at
Vanagons for head gasket problems while driving Eurovans.

Primer:  People who drive vehicles that are primer colored are the types
that know what needs to be done and when it's time to call a job done and
get a beer outta the fridge.  These people seem to have enough sense to
quit halfway thru the act of lovemaking to enjoy a beverege, with the
intention of returning to it, but usually get side tracked and start
leafing through their Rocky Mtn. Motorworks catalogs and completely forget
what they had set out to accomplish before the beer.
The spouses of primer people generally have an assortment of 'tools'
beside the bed which rival the tool collections of their primer spouse.


Cheers.
