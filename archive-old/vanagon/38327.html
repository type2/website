&gt;Also, at 322K, the tank is pretty grungy - I was thinking of running 
&gt;bleach through it to clean the tank and lines (some show mildew 
&gt;inside... yuck) then rinse well &amp; do a final rinse with some baking 
&gt;soda. Any problems with this, or better solutions?

RV suppliers sell a product I belive is called Sprakleen or somthing like it.
 It is designed to safely clean freshwater holding tanks.  It works very
well.
