Listees,

I spotted this in the local classified ads.  Heck of a deal if you want
one.  I contact the seller, he advised me it is from an '86 and is the
stock light brown (tan?) colour.  Please contact seller directly.  Seller
is in Vancouver, BC. Price is CA$.  US$ equivalent would be approx $72.  I
could (reluctantly) assist with pick up and shipping.

VOLKSWAGEN Vanagon middle bench seat, folds forward, exc cond, pd $350 sell
$100. No other pts avail Tel:  604-986-7750
