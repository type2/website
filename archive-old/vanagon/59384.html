Subject: two questions...

Howdy Volks!

Well, Moku ('87 Vanagon GL) and I went for our first road trip this weekend
(nope, haven't had him very long) and there are a couple of things I need
your input on.

First question: Boy-oh-boy is it ever noisy inside! Is there any way to
better seal the doors from the outside?

Second question: Moku decided that he doesn't want me to know that he's had
enough gas until it squirts out all over me. Anything I can do about that,
or will I just have to second-guess it?

TIA for your feedback.
