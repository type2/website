&gt;I recently got a hold of a 55-ish bus owner's manual, as well as a 66 bug
&gt;manual. These books are GREAT! they tell in detail how to tear down and rebuild
&gt;your carb, how to trouble-shoot brakes, distributor, and a whole bunch of
&gt;really useful stuff. With this book alone, you could do most of your repairs,
&gt;short of a major overhaul. In contrast, newer manuals are pretty much, IMHO,
&gt;useless. They tell how to open windows, adjust your mirrors, and other
&gt;superficial stuff. Anyone know why they cut out the good stuff???

Perhaps so you won't be inclined to do anything yerself, but have your
friendly(sic) VW dealer do it!

BTW - you interested in unloading that '55 manual?
