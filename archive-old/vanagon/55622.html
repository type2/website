Subject: rear hatch 85--&gt; 80

another thing i forgot to mention... my rear hatch is a little bent, but
not bad. the parts 85 i found has a rear hatch with built in wiper, not a
scratch on it. is it possible to move this hatch to my van, how hard would
it be to hook up the wiper if i decided to keep my current hatch?  
the lock button is a different size/shape, could i get this re-keyed to
match my current keys?

thanks a lot,

stephen white
