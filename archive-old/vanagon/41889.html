Subject: Re: Front glass

&gt;situation. It is a 1956 Microbus but I am of the belief that any front glass
&gt;up to 1967 will do and that both pieces are the same so any side will also
&gt;be accepted.

Glass from March 1955 to Sept (?) 1967 will fit.  Pre 3/55 glass is a bit
over and inch shorter.
