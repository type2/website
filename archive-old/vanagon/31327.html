Subject: POPTOP QUESTION, 

First year with the van, being up here in the northeast with all the ice and
snow.  I have the following question:

I'm very hesitant to open the top on my van during the winter for fear that
ice/snow might get under the top and into the canvas or that the top won't
seal back down to the van correctly due to ice/snow.  Does anyone agree or am
I being paranoid?

Sincerely,

S. Martel
