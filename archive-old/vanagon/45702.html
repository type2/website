Subject: Re: Nuts!...Axle Nuts!

As for the nut, I actually thing that it has fused with the brake
drum.  The nut looks as though it was beat off/on the last time and
the break drum has bee struck with a hammer....it is actually burred
down over the nut [either that or some genius thought they would put a
spot weld on the nut/drum along one edge of the nut....

Does anyone out there have a 46mm axle nut for  a '67 kombi/westy?  I
am beginning to think that I will have to cut this one off...

Also, is there any chance that all this torking on the axle nut will
damage the shaft/reduction box/ or trannie?

sounds like a tough nut to crack.   I recommend getting one of those
poundimiforms- it it a piece of metal with a hole to fit the axle nut and a
surface to pound on.  With a big hammer you can crack the nut loose.

my two cents.

oh, and if you need a new nut, i do have one for you
