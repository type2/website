Subject: Re: CV joints

&gt;
&gt;Since at least one of the CV joint boots on my 80' vanagon is more than 
&gt;cracked, I am planning on replacing all four of them, and check&amp;repack or 
&gt;replace the CV joints as well. Here my question:
&gt;
&gt;Any experience/recommendations/options to rotate the CV joints 
&gt;(inner/outer or right/left or both) or even left and right driveshaft 
&gt;with CV joints to assure even wearing?
&gt;
&gt;Marcus

Good question.  My first impression was that it would be bad, perhaps
beginning a flaking process or something, but I'm just guessing.  I forget
to mark which way my axles were facing when I R &amp; R them, which would be
doing about the same thing, running them in the opposite direction.  I think
any CV that is showing wear should probably be replaced anyway.
