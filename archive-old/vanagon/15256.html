&gt;Well all you Roadtripping VW Van Nuts, If you don't live in Eastern
&gt;Canada or near New England, Sorry, this probably isn't for you.
&gt;But,  Christian, David Carment, Other Easterners...
&gt;
Sadly, our bus will be spending another summer resting.  Cash, you
know, and all that.  I do intend to do the cv joints.  Oil cooler,
hopefully.  And maybe see if I can start planning on the heating 
system.  The trip sounds like it would be a nice cruise.  --Ralf
