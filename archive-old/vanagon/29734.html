&gt;&quot;Handicapped&quot; is not a derogatory term, any more than &quot;caucasian&quot;, or
&gt;&quot;tall&quot;, or &quot;short&quot;. They are merely accurate. If someone has a problem with
&gt;them, _they_ are the ones who are wrong, aren't they. Fortunately, very few
&gt;do-- and most of those, aren't even the ones to whom the terms are applied.

well, what's this got to do with vws? of course unless you are talking about
vws that have been converted with lifts...which my friend in a chair (who
detests being called handicapped) would be interested in buying. specially air
cooled westfalias. or if you have info on the cost or some idea of how to go
about converting a vw with a lift, hand throttles, electric sliding door, etc.
also, your pc arguements would be greatly appreciated on one of the pc
newsgroups i'm sure.
