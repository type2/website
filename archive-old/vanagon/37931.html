Subject: 78 camper for sale by friend of coworker

	Rob Sprinkle, one of my friends at work is helping a friend of 
his sell her 78 camper. She's going to be out of town for a couple of 
weeks, so it would be best if they contact him. He'll build a list 
(hopefully:-)) and pass it on to her.

	Her description:
1977 Bus with &quot;bubble top&quot; (which means you can stand up in it)
2 liter Porsche fuel injected engine with approximately 60000 miles on it;
the engine was a rebuilt one with about 10000 miles when I bought the
vehicle.
No back seats, instead it has a homemade bed (plywood); it also has an
&quot;upstairs&quot; bed that you can slide out.
Now the &quot;minusses:&quot;
Needs work on the front end; you need to start it up using external switches
since the ignition is broken; probably has a vacuum leak (it won't idle
nicely); needs a new battery (which I would be more than happy to provide).
Overall, it runs well but needs some TLC to become more reliable; has not
been in an accident, but has taken me on many, many fun trips!!! 


Contact Rob via Email at &quot;sprinkle_at_mtest.teradyne_dot_com&quot; or at 
(408) 451-3247 and he'll take their name and number for when she gets back!
