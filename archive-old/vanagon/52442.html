Subject: CV joint grease


   There was some talk about where to find CV joint grease last week,
   I had to much to do, to respond, but Anyway I found at Trak Auto
   a brand called &quot;Sta-lube&quot;. It comes in a can just like other
   wheel bearing grease. In small letters on the side 
   it states that it can be used for many things including
   CV joints. In big gold letters on the face it states &quot;Moly-
   Graph&quot;. This should say it all!
