Subject: re: Bosch CIS problems

&gt; Hi All,
&gt;    I need some input.  I have a 82 Westy Diesel that I converted to gas
&gt; using a 83 Rabbit GTI motor. I used the stock CIS fuel injection.  All has
&gt; been well until it started getting cold.
&gt; 
&gt; My problem:  1st, It started skipping.  Not ignition related.  checked
&gt; everything, cap,rotor,wires plugs,halls unit and control unit, everythings
&gt; OK and most of it is new.. It would skip worse when I gave it more thottle.
&gt; Then as suddenly as it started skipping it stopped.  Ran great, for a
&gt; while.  When it started again I decided to check FI parts.  Everything I
&gt; could check with a test light and multimeter, except Fuel pump seemed to
&gt; check out. Finally I borrowed a fuel gauge and the pressure seemed fine,
&gt; about 68psi.  Now the book said pressure was ok but the cold pressure
&gt; seemed high. Lets put it this way the pressure never dropped below 50 from
&gt; start-up til operating temp.  When the car was off the pressure dropped to
&gt; 28psi and stayed there for the time allowed when checking for leaks.
&gt; However fuel pump output was less than 16oz for 30sec operation.  Book said
&gt; at least 32oz.  I replaced the fuel pump.  Output great over 32oz of 30sec
&gt; operation.  The engine didn't run anybetter right away.  Then suddenly bam
&gt; runs great. And has seemed to run good ever since. Although a couple of
&gt; times I felt it skip under acceleration. Problem #2  Now it doesn't like to
&gt; stay running cold.  I have to start the van between 8 and twelve times
&gt; before it will stay running. It driving me crazy.  I hooked a gauge to it
&gt; today.  It never dropped below 70psi right from the start. I've been told
&gt; its the warm up or control pressure regulator.  I guy at the GM shop I work
&gt; at said its the injectors. (He's an old Saab tech and said Saab and VW used
&gt; same injection system, he also said injectors where Saabs big problem when
&gt; they were cold and ran crappy.) I'm at my wits end. HELP.  I can't afford
&gt; to buy more parts just to have them not completely cure them problem.  At
&gt; first I thought this problem was because of something I did during the
&gt; refitfrom the rabbit. I have checked and triple checked everything
&gt; associated with fitting the FI from the rabbit and it checks out OK.
&gt; Please help me.  Thanks for your help.  I think in the future when money
&gt; allows I'm going Digijet(?) Injection from an 88 or newer Golf or Jetta.
&gt; Looks like alot less parts and wires. Probably cost twice as much to fix.=)
&gt; E-mail me or post a reponce to the list. Thanks.  By the way the
&gt; convertion from diesel was fairly easy, if anyone want to know E-mail me.

Jim,

I've got an 82 Scirocco w/ CIS - it showed similar symptoms, and the 
PO had already replaced the warmup reg., so I tried the injector 
O-rings - it's been running great ever since! Cheapest fix ever - 
about $3 ! 
The injectors are hard to get out - I clamped carefully with pliers &amp; 
pried *straight* out. The O rings become brittle from the heat after 
a while &amp; no longer seal well.

PS: I'd be very interested in some info on your conversion also.

I haven't lost my mind;  I'm sure it's backed up on tape somewhere!
