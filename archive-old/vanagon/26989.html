Subject: Anyone have an extra 87 front tranny housing they can sell?

Just got of the phone from the shop.  The good news is that they will still
take my second born (lost the first on the head gasket job in the North West
Territories).  The bad news is that I need a replacement front tranny
housing.  You could imagine how delighted the dealer was on that news.  Does
anyone have one they could part at a more reasonable price?

A Camper :-) in need of assistance :-(...
