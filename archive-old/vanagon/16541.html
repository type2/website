&gt;...(SNIP)

&gt;I suggested Deception Pass on Whidbey or someplace in that area.  I guess
&gt;meeting stateside would be better for the WA people.  Deception Pass is
&gt;very picturesque, but I have seen the campsites pretty crowded at times.

If you're gonna come stateside, why not Moran St. park on Orcas. I know
it's a boat ride (or two), but it's definitely worth the added hassle. And
as an added feature, after we all bike to the top of Mt. Constitution (ha
ha), we can soak our bones over at Doe Bay for only a couple of bucks.

The problem all Washington campgrounds - no matter where - is that they
will probably be jammed with people every weekend between now and October.
The state parks may have a reservation system (I can't quite remember) that
we could utilize. Otherwise, maybe a couple of rigs could head out early on
a Friday to stake out a place.

&gt;---&gt; So, pizza in Burnaby Sat May 13 for starters?
&gt;

Can't make it. Don't let me stop y'all though. Perhaps we can do something
again when the GNATT crew comes through.
