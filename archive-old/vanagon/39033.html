Subject: Re: List Stickers

Garcia of the dead has nothing to do with VWs.  He was, however,
responsible for hooking thousands of people on drugs and cultivating a
lifstyle that glorified substance abuse.  It is poetic justice that he died
of heart problems stemming from his years of drug use . That many of his
followers drove busses in imitation of the Hippie years is no reason to
associate him with this list.  I would  be offended if the stickers
&quot;honored&quot; this guy.  Lets have stickers which have to do with us and our
love of these vehichles.

&gt;
&gt;OK, well I'm no fan of the 'Dead by any stretch of the imagination, but what
&gt;say
&gt;we make the next list sticker something along the lines of the list address
&gt;over
&gt;(or around) the facial likeness of Jerry Garcia?
