Subject: Questions....('69 Westy - Lazarus)

All righty, I got everything hooked up and we took it for a spin.

Here are my questions:

1.  I seem to have a minor (very minor ) oil leak but I can not see to find
the source.  How concerned should I be. NOTE this is a brand new rebuilt
GEX engine

2.  I have the Dwell set EXACTLY at 50 deg (i.e. points at .016&quot;) and the
engine at what seems to be o drg TDC.  This is an &quot;F&quot; number engine but it
does seem to have dual pressure relief andis a single port.  Am I setting
this right?

3.  Even thoiugh all of this has been set it seem to be running AWFULLY
hot.  Anything I could be doing wrong?  I do not want to have to replace
this engine anytime soon.

It runs fine after it warms up but it does dies quite a bit when it is
warming up if I do not give it gas.

BTW, the RPMs are between 800 and 900 at idle.

Thanks
