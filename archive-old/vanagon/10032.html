Subject: Re: Help with 81 Westy please

Hi Jim,

I have an '82 Westy with the same mechanicals. I have 95,000 on a well 
maintained motor, although I am the third owner (since 58,000). Lately the 
compression has started dropping in 2 of the cylinders a little (I forget which 
ones and how much), but it runs strong. Rebuilt tranny 5k mi ago. From my 
experience and by talking around, these motors are good for 120-130k if very 
well maintained. My friend bought an '82 (a clone of mine, puke yellow) that was
known to be poorly maintained by the previous owner, and a ring broke at 75,000.
Mine developed an oil leak at about 85,000 mi (a drip that finally became 
intolerable). I replace the push rod tube o-rings with the viton seals (yes, 
just like your '71, but you don't have to pull the heads!). Problem solved. BTW,
viton is a new high-tech material that doesn't harden so easily with prolonged 
heat. Better VW shops know about these. I got mine from Kohlwiess in Redwood 
City, CA. I could dig up the number if you need it. One of the few cases where 
aftermarket is superior to OEM.

$2,000 is a great price. For comparison, I paid $5200 3 years ago, but it only 
had 58,000 mi and was (and is) *very* clean. My friend paid $2500 for his over 2
years ago, but it had a little body damage and questionable maintainance. As 
usual, YMMV.

&gt; I have a friend looking at an '81 Westy that is for sale.  The guy is 
&gt; asking $2,000 before any talking.  It might be cheaper.  I haven't 
&gt; seen this bus, it is half a continent away.  From reports:  this guy 
&gt; is the second owner, 94,000 miles on original motor, little or no 
&gt; rust, interior in good shape, pop top and canvas good, motor leaks oil
&gt; (possibly from one of the heads?).  I don't know what this last thing 
&gt; means.  Do these motors have push rod tubes like my '71?  I guess what
&gt; I want to know is how much he might have left on the motor.  From 
&gt; there, can we guess what might be a more accurate price.  Hell, it 
&gt; might be a good deal now!?  Could someone please let me know.  Oh, 
&gt; BTW, the guy looking at doing the buying is the same one who sold me 
&gt; the '71.  He misses it.  :)  Thanks, Jim
