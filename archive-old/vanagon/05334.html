James: It might be a good idea to have the compression checked before you
undertake this operation. If the compression and other vital organs are
functional then press ahead, if not  you are shoring up an unjust
situation..... and the best recourse would be to put the patient to sleep
and purchase a long block for $1800-2000 (water cooled right?). The
mechanics will let you know if the valves are bad or the heads are
cracked; if so option b may be preferable - DC
