 &gt; There must be a way.  I replaced my antenna ('84 GL) a few
 &gt; years after I bought it.  I know I didn't have to do more
 &gt; that snake my hands up under the dash without taking out
 &gt; anything difficult.

I replaced the antenna on my '84 GL too;  as I recall the key is to remove the 
grille (6 dzus fasteners) and the headlight on the antenna side.  This makes 
attaching the antenna to the body easy.

Fishing the cable through into the dash is pretty easy too, especially if you 
tie a piece of string to the old cable before you yank it out.  You may want 
to remove the instrument cluster, but it chouldn't be necessary.
