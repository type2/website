Subject: vw ads

hi..jim mcg. here..kinda new to the list...noticed the talk about ads..

i love these vw ads...my favorite bus ad is the rear of 66 or 67 stationwagon

in some deep pow(powder snow)...and it reads &quot; a beautiful day to own a vw

stationwagon &quot;..the ad goes on to tell how a whole mess of snow fell on

jan 24 1966 and how people with busses got themselves and friends around..it 
d of tells how us vdubbers help each ohter out which is nice...also a great

photo...my favorite bug ad is a bug floating in water and reads

&quot; if ted kennedy drove a vw, he'd be president today &quot;..it's sick but true
keep on bussin!! jim
ps..any bussers in northern jersey..i'm 10 mins from nyc
