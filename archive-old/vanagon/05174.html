Subject: Brown Factory Captain Seat

I have for sale the special middle seat offered only during the 1985 model
year. This is the brown colored captain's seat that goes in a camper behind
the front passenger seat and near the sliding door. This is the seat that
clips in and out of the vehicle that everybody was talking about two months
ago as a means of seating five people in a camper.

I have a grey interior to my van so I don't want to keep a brown seat.

It is a heavy duty seat that is designed to face forward as you drive. It can
be fitted with a swivel base and pointed any way you like when not driving.

The seat looks absolutely brand new. The original owner took this seat out of
his van immediately after buying the van in 1985 and the seat has been
sitting indoors ever since. There is one blemish where it looks like someone
brushed a part of the seat with something hot but it is small and not very
noticeable. The seat looks better than the seats in my 1990. The seat does
not come with a headrest or the base which attaches it to the floor. 

Vanagon seats of this kind cost $500 to $900 each at a dealer when you can
get them. I will sell it for $195 plus shipping cost to get it to you via
UPS. You can use this seat either to turn your vanagon camper into a five
seater, or to use it as a replacement for one of your front seats when they
become worn or if you have a lower trim level and want to upgrade to GL
luxury. 

If you have a grey van and you want to add the middle seat it is possible to
take off the upholstery and put on the grey upholstery although I don't know
what the grey upholstery would cost at the dealer.
