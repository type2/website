I don't know whether you have Discount Tire where you are, but their prices 
are truly unbeatable.  What I mean is that they will beat anyone's prices, 
and I find that their service is much better than Price Club.  Very fast in 
and out.  In Phoenix, they post all the competitor's newspaper ads on the 
wall, so you can save time shopping ... just pick out the tire and price 
from the ads, and they beat the price.  They seem to be able to get any 
brand as well.

My last tires were chosen at Price Club, and purchased at Discount for $5 
less per tire after all service charges and warranty's were considered.
