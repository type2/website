&gt;&gt; HA Martha! Not only do I produce more &quot;minutia&quot; than you on this
&gt;&gt; list...but I'm more chronicologically challenged than you (1952)!!
&gt;&gt; Ric
&gt;Ha Ric!  I KNEW you we're a little older than me. (Just ask John
&gt;Ritchie)  I'm circa 1954.  Oh well.  I'm sure Joel could tell us
&gt;stories about when he was a wee lad on the buck-board! ;)

ayeah. ayeah. why, i remember WALKING to school, down the dirt road to the
railroad track, then along the tracks over to the school. all kinds of
weather. uphill both ways. past snarling junkyard dogs. Mean ex-Nazi teachers
... cause they let them out of the prison camps (no joke: my father's job
in the last years of the war was running a prisoner-of-war camp in Clanton,
AL). and all we had to eat were BEETS!!! (i HATE beets!!!!)

cars? we didn't have no stinking cars! i had a goat-wagon, pulled by two
goats!! and that was only after i was a teen-ager!! (really hard to get
girls to go on dates. never did figure that out.)

buncha damn 50's kids!!! young whippersnappers!! :) probably don't even
remember the Korean War!!! much less the Dominican Republic 'police action'
... just like what is happening about Haiti right now. what goes around comes
around: if you don't learn history, you are doomed to repeat it. ;)

&gt;P.S. chronicologically?????

yes. this is correct. chronic = repetitive, habitually, alway present;
logically = having to do with reason, logic, in an orderly cogent fashion.
=&gt;habitually logical. what's the problem? :)  us old folks is always been
more habitually logical than you diapered denizens of Dementia.

j.o.e.l.
julst old eloquent logic
