&gt;There's a mounting bracket for this. It's a four-bolt plate with a long

&gt;I think it's generic and about $10 or $15....then there are covers that run
&gt;from about $30 to more than an original, chromed emblem. Problem is, you
&gt;have to drill holes in the front of your bus to mount a tire up there.
&gt;Ouch!

Yeah, I've got one of these. I just removed it to paint my '76 (and take out
the dent in the nose). Are these really sturdy enough? What's supporting the
weight of the spare besides the body panel? Does anyone know of a spare tire
mount that is fixed to the bumper instead?

Just wonderin',
