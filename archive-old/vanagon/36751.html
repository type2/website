Subject: Piston pins

This article is dedicated to Ken Hooper of the Vanagon list, with my thanks
for raising the question of piston pin removal.


                                     Piston Pins &amp; Hammers

....don't go together.

The wrist pin or gudgeon pin of a piston must be a contact-fit in both piston
and only slightly looser in the eye of the connecting rod.  That is, there
should be no measureable clearance between them at room temperature, although
the pin should be free to slide with moderate pressure.  When the engine is
at normal operating temperature the aluminum piston will expand more than the
cast iron wrist pin, providing sufficient clearance for lubrication.  But
such a close fit often makes piston pins difficult to remove or install.  St.
Muir advocates the use of a hammer when the going gets tough.  The wiser
course is to out-think the problem.  

The pin should never be driven in with hammer blows.  

There are a variety of tools that will push or pull a piston pin into place
with no more effort than turning a wrench.  Because of the relatively small
diameter of the wrist pin you can make such a tool from a piece of  water
pipe, a pipe cap and a bit of threaded rod. Such a tool allows you to remove
and install piston pins with surgical precision, something lacking when you
whap the thing with a hammer.

Hammering side-ways on a piston, no matter how well buffered and supported,
imposes damagingly high side-loads on the connecting rod.  Connecting rods
are typically forged from mild steel and their shape is optimized to produce
maximum rigidity in the plain of the piston's travel.  By comparison, they
handle side-loads poorly.  Since the rod is at its maximum extension when you
install the piston, the energy of a hammer blow will be multiplied by the
length of the rod.  You'll have no trouble bending the thing or damaging the
bearing.  One of those.  Often both.

Prior to assembling your engine you should have tested the fit of the pins in
their pistons and in the rods.  Often times, even with new pistons, you'll
find the pin hangs up on the retaining ring groove.  Dressing the groove with
a light wipe of #600 silicone carbide paper is usually enough to remove the
lip causing the hang-up.

At room temperature the wrist pin should press into the connecting rod with
slightly less pressure than needed with the piston.  Turned so the pin is
vertical, the wrist pin should not slide out of the rod, or slide out v-e-r-y
slowly.  Many so-called 'rebuilt' rods are NOT fitted with new wrist pin
bushings.  They merely score or swage the old bushing to reduce the ID then
broach it back to size.  Such rods are worn out before you install them.

Removing the wrist pins on a high-time engine can be a trial because varnish
builds up on the pin between the connecting rod and the piston, forming a
collar that is larger than the bore through which it must pass when the pin
is removed.  Solvents more active than the typical mineral spirits -- MEK and
the like -- can dissolve the varnish but most pins will usually come free
when the piston is heated.  And we are talking hot-heat here, not just
warming the thing up.  Several minutes attention with a propane torch will
usually free the most reluctant wrist pin.  It may be pushed out with a
section of dowel or in seriously stuck cases, pulled out with the threaded
puller described below.


                                       Making a Wrist-pin Puller

The typical VW wrist pin is about 3&quot; long and about 7/8&quot; of an inch in
diameter (70mm by 22mm).  

The puller is made from a section of tubing or pipe about four inches long.
 Water pipe is a good choice, so long as the ID is large enough to accept the
wrist pin, which will extend up inside the puller as the pin slides out of
the piston.  The edge of the puller that presses against the piston must be
filed to match the curvature of the piston in order to insure the puller
pulls in a staight line and the piston is not damaged.  When filed to the
proper curve, the thick wall of the typical water pipe provides enough
surface to prevent marring the aluminum piston.  But tubing with thinner
walls will work.  The load puts the puller in compression and such a short
length of thin-walled tubing is extremely strong in compression.  But the
thinner the wall, the more the risk of marring the piston.

Another reason pipe works so well is that you may close the upper end of the
puller with a regular pipe cap.  With other types of tubing you'll have to
weld the end closed or make a suitable cap.  I've made pullers from materials
as diverse as electrical conduit and even a section of tailpipe from a Bug. 

The cap is drilled to accept a length of 1/2&quot; diameter threaded rod about
eight inches long.  (The extra length is needed when you use the puller to
insert wrist pins.)  The threaded rod is turned into a puller-rod by welding
or peening a nut on one end then grinding the nut until it is marginally
smaller than the diameter of a wrist pin.  Once ground down, the nut will
pass through the piston and connecting rod but will be too large to pass
through the wrist pin.

In use, the circlips, buttons or retaining rings are removed, the greased
puller-rod inserted though the wrist pin, the puller tube slid over the rod
and a nut threaded onto the free end of the rod.  Turning the nut will cause
the wrist pin to be pulled out of the piston.

Turning the nut will also cause a wrist pin to be drawn INTO a piston as
well.  I'll let you figure out how.  But be cautious.  The simple puller
described above can crush a piston.

                                       Sermonette

A remarkably thin section of steel will defeat the strength of the strongest
man.  When dealing with machines, humans must relie upon their wits, not
their strength.  If you encounter a tribe of obstinant gudgeon pins, outwit
the rascals!  Use chemicals to dissolve the varnish and heat to alter their
dimensions.  If they still refuse to budge, build a tool to move them out of
there.  

Any fool can pound on things and most of us do, at one time or another.
 Unfortunately, we usually causing more harm than good in the process.
