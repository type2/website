&gt;I'm still trying to track down a problem with my oil warning system. The
high
&gt;and low pressure switches have been replaced along with the circuit board.
At
&gt;about 3000 RPM the light flashes and the buzzer goes on. If I rev above 3000
&gt;, they stop. It was suggested to me to use the V.W. filter, it helped for a
&gt;while though it started again this weekend. Does anyone know if there is
&gt;another relay or cap. in this circuit . It gets to be pretty annoying after
a
&gt;4 or 5 hour drive. I actually cut the connection on the old board so we
&gt;didn't have to listen to the buzzer on the way home from Maine.

Are you sure the switches are good?  Are they correct?  Have you measurd the
oil pressure?  Are the wores connected properly?  Switching the wires to the
sensors will cause erractic operation.  Except for wiring and switch
problems, I have not actually seen this circuit fail.  I have seen legitimate
resons for the light  and buzzer to come on.  Especially after the engine
warms up.
