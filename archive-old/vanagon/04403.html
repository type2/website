Well!

	The plot thickens!

	She called today about picking up the car.  They told her cool, go ahead,
come on down.    

	He then called me to give me &quot;the speech&quot; before he gave it to her.

	There are hydrocarbons present in the cooling system now.  Meaning 
head-gasket or cracked head.

	Now the shocker.  They wrote the whole repair OFF.  Zippo.  No charge.
No parts, no labor, nuthin'!  The only thing it cost us was the thermo hosuing,
'caus ewe bought that ourselves at the BMW junkyard.

	I definitely smell a fish, and it ain't king salmon.  They put in a new
fan clutch, ALL of the hoses, had the rad cleaned, etc.  I'm guessing they had
5 hours labor, easy, if not 10-15.  _at_$55/hour.  And who knows what in parts,
fan-clutch = $100, hoses $100+/-, thermo, gaskets, etc.

	This is definitely a curve.  There is a damn good reason they are throwing
away $500 to $1000.

	So, my other problem is, now that they've sweet talked her by giving
her all this &quot;free&quot; stuff, she's apprehensive about doing anything about the
fiasco.  I'm trying to talk some sense into her, but arrgghhh!

	Now the punch line!

	The shop manager told her to put in a bottle of Bar Leak(sp?), drive the 
car for 45 minutes, and sell it!

	The name of the shop is:

	AutoSport Technology
	2630 Broadway
	Sacramento, Ca 95818
	(916) 453-1465
	Its owned by Dwight and Linda Mitchell, Jim Dooley is the manager.

	I used to trust these guys, but over the last few years, they've gotten 
more and more expensive, and now this!  I should have seen the writing on 
the wall when they started working on Japanese cars!
