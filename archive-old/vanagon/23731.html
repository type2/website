&gt; 
&gt; &gt;can anyone explain what the numbers mean on the metal tag that is pop
&gt; &gt;rivted to the bulkhead behind the front passenger seat on my 1965
&gt; &gt;Westfalia?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Here are what the numbers on the tag look like
&gt; &gt;_____________________________
&gt; &gt;|  191                       |
&gt; &gt;|  425 A42 002 080 108 168   |
&gt; &gt;|  UH 2312 523907 5091317    |

&gt; Hi Michael!  I'm going to take a stab at this.
&gt; 
&gt; The first line is the manufacturing date:
&gt; 
&gt; January 19, 1965
&gt; 
&gt; The second line has the M-codes for options.  The ones I can figure
&gt; out are:
&gt; 
&gt; 080     Separate Front Seats for Panel or Kombi
&gt; 
&gt; 108     With SO-42 Camper Kit
&gt; 
&gt; 168     88 Ampere/Hour Battery
&gt; 
&gt; The third line has the point of entry:
&gt; 
&gt; U is for USA, H is for point of entry
&gt; 
&gt; 231     is the model, Kombi
&gt; 
&gt; The next number is for color codes, can't figure out
&gt; 
&gt; The last number is the VIN number (add 23 for model)
&gt; (23)5091317
&gt; 
Is there a comprehensive list of all these codes anywhere?
Could somebody kindly post it if there is?
Thanks
Richard
