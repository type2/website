Subject: Re: Hard to read oil level?

My '85 has been pretty trouble free the last year or so (oh no must be
time for something major) so I'll bring up a nit-picky subject. Does
anyone else get irritated at the difficulty in reading the oil level on
the dip stick?

Because of the sharp bend only one side usually shows the correct level
which is fine but even it can be hard to read when the oil is cold and
almost impossible when the oil is warm. Any creative solutions out
there?
