 i've followed the list for 6-8 months now, and know of the intermittent
 power loss problems, but this seems different as it only happens in the
rain.
 
 any thought/hints/procedures for me to try?
 
 thanks...david
 
 ps-  i think ron's business and prescence on this list is great.  we have
 to be the toughest consumers out there (if you can make here, you'll make
 it anywhere).

Try an old trick.  At night, uncover engine, turn out lights, start engine
and let idle.  Take a spray bottle of water and spray the ignition wires.  If
there's a breakdown of your wires when wet, it will show up as a nice spark
(one of mine were sparking directly to an injector).  Look carefully all
around the wires and be carefull of turning belts &amp; pulleys.
