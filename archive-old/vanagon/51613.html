Subject: Re: Syncro Westie GVW?

Hello Al.  I've weighed our Syncro Westy many times for usual weekend 
trips... full propane, fuel, weekend gear , water, and ourselves.  The least 
amount was 5004 lbs, the most we've had was 5250 lbs (3 month trip!).

I believe the sticker on the door jam has a GVW rating of 2500 kg 
(approx 5500 lbs).  

For a good tire, try the Yokohama Y370 LT195 75/R14.  Rated at 
1710lbs at 65 psi, all season tread, with excellent snow and rain 
ability.  I run them at 43 front, 53 rear.

Hope this helps,

Harry.

&gt; So what is the real answer for &quot;how much does ruby-the-red-brick weigh?&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; Anyone weighed their syncro-westie w/water etc on a front-rear scale?  
&gt; What did the beast weigh?
&gt; 
&gt; I'm thinking that 1325 lbs_at_ 50PSI maybe isn't enough tire (Uniroyal Laredo).

&gt;  Jim...Tom...Derek ?
