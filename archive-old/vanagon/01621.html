Subject:      more electrical stuff

here's some junk i found as i was thumbing through the bosch books again.
one of these days, i'm gonna go out to the bus and see what wattage each
of the little bulbs are (i know the headlights are supposed to be 55/60W,
but what about the little side-marker lights and interior lights? i recall
that they have it marked on the bulb, but i never paid much attention before).
