&gt;How about attaching them to something secured by the wheels.  I'm picturing a
&gt;couple of pieces of wood or something that you drive the van onto, that
&gt;extends out away from the passenger side of the van.  Then attach the pole to
&gt;the wood.

&gt; Interesting thought. I was thinking of attaching (bolting) some sort of
tab under the bus that stuck out flush with the body....

how about putting some sort of reinforced bend into the poles and inserting
them in the jack points?
