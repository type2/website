&gt;  I wouldn't know Ron Salmon if he came up and bit me on the ankle.  But he sold
&gt; me a Bentley manual for $67.50 and that is a hell of a savings over the usual
&gt; price. The deal was simple and straightforward:  send a check, get a book.  I
&gt; look forward to working with him in the future.

I'd like to say enough of the pontificating about how good Ron's 
book deal is, it is the same price as available from nearly any 
quality supplier of Bentley manuals, no better, no worse.  Ron makes 
the money, not someone else, if you think this is good so be it.  
IMHO Ron does use this list to make likely a fair piece of money in 
car buying and selling, it is his perogative.  I don't care for the 
fact that some deals he might get from the list could have gone to 
others more needy, but I have done the same thing.  None of us are 
saints, but $68 for a Bentley manual does not qualify him as one 
either.  Personally I'd like no commercial ads of any nature on the 
list (oh yes Ron you are commercial) IE say if you sell over 5 cars a 
year, you do not post ads to the list, you could say put a line like 
&quot;I sell vans email me&quot; in your .sig and when you post regular factual 
postings (which Ron does regularly) people could know and contact you.

My opinions, I have many.
