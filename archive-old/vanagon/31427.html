     happy holidays all -
     
     
     I pulled the heater boxes from my engine last night, and thanks to the 
     paint thread I'll be fixing them up soon.  The PO must have had them 
     painted as 1) there's paint on them (duh) and 2) they're in really 
     good condition.
     
     On the transplant engine I found a push rod tube that has a dent in it 
     and I'm not sure if it has to be replaced (nor what I must do to take 
     off/put on the head).  Because the tube is inaccessible to the outside 
     when the engine is assembled, I presume that it has been this way a 
     while and that it ran ok (the engine has about 3K on it). Any 
     experiences ?
     
     I am also curious if I should replace the washer/gasket that is used 
     to connect the heater boxes to the engine. They don't look too bad so 
     I figure that I can reuse them, what's the common wisdom on these ?
     
     Now that I have most everthing off I am ready for the finishing 
     cleaning and to begine putting the good pieces on the new engine. I 
     suppose this is the half-way point.  Thanks to everyone for their 
     help,  it's great to have mystries deepened and solved.
