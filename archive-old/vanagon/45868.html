&gt;
&gt;Now let's not get on the government's case...I retired after twenty-some 
&gt;years with the &quot;gummint&quot; and I want to set the record straight.  We 
&gt;weren't allowed to use any sharp objects, much less a hammer and a 
&gt;chisel!
&gt;
&gt;	Thanks all for the advice and creative writing!

&gt;&gt;&gt;Claralw_at_aol wrote &quot;As for the nut, I actually thin(k) that it has fused
&gt;&gt;&gt;with the brake drum.  .   .   .   .   Does anyone out there have a 46mm
&gt;&gt;&gt;axle nut for  a '67 kombi/westy?  I am beginning to think that I will
&gt;&gt;&gt;have to cut this one off...&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;And John responded:
&gt;&gt;&gt;  Ok, I mentioned this one to one of my many years experienced truck
&gt;&gt;&gt;mechanic wizards.  He said he'd take a chisel and ....
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;A bad idea. If you can't get it off with a ten foot cheater your just 
&gt;going
&gt;&gt;to make a mess of things with this technique.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;If that fails, using the chisel to
&gt;&gt;&gt;help rotation with the &quot;blue wrench&quot; (torch) and the now familiar 
&gt;cheater
&gt;&gt;&gt;bar offer the normal options.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Not so fast. How are you going to get a socket on the nut you have just
&gt;&gt;beat to shit with a mallet and chisel?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;  Compared with the stuff he considers big, this isn't, so dealing with
&gt;&gt;&gt;this kind of effort is a regular event for him.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;        John
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Just 'cause he uses this technique on LARGE nuts doesn't make it an
&gt; aproved
&gt;&gt;method. Nor does doing it on a regular basis. If big means 'complicated'
&gt;&gt;pounding it off with a chisel (the wrong tool) is only cool if you work
&gt; for
&gt;&gt;the government ;-)
