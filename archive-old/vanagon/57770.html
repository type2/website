Subject: Different rocker arm ratios

Hi Volks,

I remember seeking somewhere that the rocker arms that volkswagen uses are
the same as those used on chevy engines. Can anyone confirm or deny this? I
was thinking that since there are more ratios available for the chevy
engine (1.5 and 1.6) that if it was compatible there might be a way to get
some more horsepower out of the WB engine. Any thoughts on this.

Dave
