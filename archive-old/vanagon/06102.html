&gt;&gt; &gt; I'm looking for someone to say &quot;I've got a 009 on my bus, and it's been
&gt;&gt; &gt; fine for X years =)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; How about this:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;       &quot; I had an 009 on my bus for several years, and never *could* get
&gt;&gt; it to run right.&quot;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I'm sure there is a source out there for a stock replacement distributor.
&gt;&gt; Find it, buy it, and be happy.  :)  If nowhere else, call Vee Parts here
&gt;&gt; in San Diego at (619) 477-4787.  They should be able to help.  I would
&gt;&gt; recommend avoiding the 009.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;Interesting, as I have run a 009 on my '67, which has a 68 Beetle
&gt;engine, for at least 4000 miles, and it's been great. I put it on at the
&gt;beginning of this year, and if it's as bad as some are saying, I'd love
&gt;to get an old one- I'd be flying! :)
&gt;Anyway, no complaints here.

OK, here goes.  I have a 009 on my '70 Bus and have been running it for 7 
years
(about 90k miles) and have had very little trouble.  I also ran a 009 on my
'68 Bug for 10 years with very little trouble.  I have found that it takes a
little bit of time to get the 009 set up right(trial and error) but once it 
is set it
runs fine.  I also have found that the 009 does not run particularly well
with any of the stock Solexes above a 30 PICT-1.  I am currently running
my '70 Bus with a '70 case, single port heads,  30 PICT-1, stock (factory)
exhaust  and the 009 at about 6 Degrees BTDC static timing.  This is
a compromise on the timing. It would run a little bit better with more 
advance,
but I have experienced detonation with more advance at highway speeds
so I backed off.  I have good idle and no flat spot on transition.
Just my $.02.  Hope it helps.
