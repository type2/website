Subject:      Re: Chilli in buses

if i haven't mentioned more than about three times in the last month or
so, some previous messages reminded me about getting stains up out of the
carpet in buses. specifically the carpet in the vanagon GL models.

i used Tuff Stuff by Simoniz, and it works great!! i don't know what the
heck they have in that stuff, or where the stains went, but it really works.
available at your local K-Mart, Wal-mart, and other fine retail outlets. :)

and, yes, i KNOW it's not made by 3M, but it still works. ;)
