Subject: Waterproofing canvas top

First of all, I should never argue with Joel.  Nowhere on my Westfalia can I
find the term &quot;Camper&quot; or anything like it, but when I dug through the docs, 
I found the pamphlet on the Westfalia conversion, and it calls my van a
Campmobile.  It's a 1980 Westfalia, so the term was still in use then.

What I'd like to hear is some feedback on waterproofing the canvas in the pop
top.  The canvas on my van has started to let the rain soak in when the wind
blows, and I was thinking that I'd like to renew the waterproofing.  I think
that I'll go for the silicone stuff that I can buy in camping stores for dry 
(non-oiled) canvas tents.  Has anyone had any problems with this stuff, or 
have any better suggestions of what to do/use?

Michael
