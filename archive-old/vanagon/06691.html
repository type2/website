From: Joe Clark &lt;joeclark_at_freenet.scri.fsu_dot_edu&gt;
Subject: Canadjuns, Bubbas, and false Joe Clarks

OK, this is getting way off-topic, but:

1. I stand corrected regarding the Quebecois (sp?) in black speedos.
2. Though Southern, I have never met anyone named Bubba.  However, I _do_ 
eat dirt and have wondered why my older sister sometimes calls me &quot;son&quot;.
3. No, I'm not related to former Canadian PM Joe Clark, that imposter, 
nor to any of the other pretenders.  In fact my .sig used to say:

The REAL Joe Clark, not: 1. Bat-wielding High-School Disciplinarian
			 2. Former Canadian PM
			 3. Late Pennsylvania Senator
			 4. Subject of Fare-thee-well song.

(hmmm.  beats the heck out of the latest .sig.  But how to get all that 
_and_ the URL in 4 lines so I can feel superior to the ASCII muralists?)

On to bus content: I have two 1/25 model kits of busses, both by Revell.  
One's a split-windshield panel van (you can tell that the mold was also 
used to make a 21-window, too! :-() and the other's a Vanagon Westy.  I 
also have a red glass Avon stink decanter-bus (2nd generation style) with 
a HUGE motorcycle hanging on the back, along with a hotwheels vanagon.  
My question: anyone know of other bus scale models available -- bigger 
than those 1/43-scale things that seem to crop up everywhere?

Waaah!  I miss my bus!  (The Prelude corners too well!)
