FEY,gary,
Bad!  you can't do that as the two refrigerants are not compatible with
each other!  I forget what exaclty it wdoes to you r sytstem, but
it's not good.  Anybody know why they're not compatible?

&gt; &gt;Just wondering if anyone on the list has any information on the refrigerant
&gt; &gt;changes (R-12 to R-134) that we all may be facing in the next 2 years or
&gt; &gt;so.  Does VW have any conversion kits yet for the Vanagon, any mention of
&gt; &gt;what the cost might be?  GM says their upgrades may be $500 to $600 while
&gt; &gt;Fords may run $1000 to $1200.
&gt; 
&gt; I lost the freon (R-12) charge in my 88GL and decided to recharge it with the
&gt; R-134.
&gt; I had an old vacume pump (the old high school demo kind purchased from a flea
&gt; market) with which I evacuated the system.  I made fittings to connect to the
&gt; ports on the Vanagon system from pieces of hose that I had and common
&gt; fittings that I bought at the auto parts store.  Once evacuated, I put in 4
&gt; (48 oz) cans of the new  R-134
&gt; and 2oz of compresser oil [USE SAFETY GLASSES!].   The manual calls for 50oz
&gt; total. This was done with the engine running the air conditioner set to high.
&gt; It works great - can't feel any difference in cooling power.  Total cost =
&gt; less than $50.
