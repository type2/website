Subject: How to replace vent window on '75 sliding door?

    How do you replace the vent window in the sliding door on a 75 bus?
    Looks like it had a peg at the bottom and top and it pivoted there.
    Mine no longer has a peg on the bottom.

    Last night, someone removed this window in order to steal my CD player.

    Thanks
