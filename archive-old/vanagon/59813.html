About $100 for the Freon and $10,000 for the fine. Do not open a system
with CFC's (e.g. Freon aka R12) without a certificate from the EPA.

The run up in prices on Freon result from the Montreal Protocol of 1989
that mandated the worldwide elimination of CFC's within a very short
time frame. We are well into final implementation of that protocol and
they are getting very serious about enforcement. You may not get caught
but who do you know that can/will sell you the Freon?

BTW: smuggling Freon in from Mexico is becoming a big business.
