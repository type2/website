&gt;I have a deep cycle RV battery that I store in a plastic case under the rear
&gt;seat of my 87 Westy to power a portable 9&quot; tv/vcr combo.  I just connect the
&gt;+ and  - poles to a BASIC DESIGNS12-volt cord (alligator clips and cigarette
&gt;type lighter adapter) and then plug in the tv 12-volt cord.  Well I just
&gt;tried this with the BASIC DESIGNS power shower and fried the cord!  Nearly
&gt;started a fire!  Was this just because the BASIC DESIGNS alligator clips
&gt;which connect to the battery are so &quot;wimpy&quot; or is this inherently dangerous?
&gt; I don't want to fry my tv.  Worse I don't want a fire.  Any suggestions? I
&gt;try to avoid using the dashboard lighter plug for obvious reasons
&gt;
&gt;

A abttery can pass an awfull lot of current.  Connecting an uncharged battery
to a chrged battery with the alternator charging can pass 30 amps or more,
plus any load connected.  All wiring needs to be sized properly and fused
correctly.  Unfortunately, many systems in a Vanagon are not fused from the
factory making things worse when modifications are performed.  Be carefull
what you connect and how.  I would recomend a second battery be permanatly
and proerly installed with appropriate relays to control charging and having
all loads properly fused.

BTW, not only can shorted batteries cas a fire, but the resulting gases and
heat can cause a battery to explode.  Charging frozen batteries are also
deadly.
