ok. so the left coast is getting tooooo many. if all you dudes and dudettes
from the shake-and-bake state will tell me your relative location within
california (north or south), i'll make the changes. but you are gonna have
to tell me ... cause i don't know where all those suburbs are and i don't
have a map here at work. :)  i know where san fran and san diego and l.a.
are, but i have no idea where many of the others are.
