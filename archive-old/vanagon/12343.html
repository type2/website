Subject: Question about propane tank

How do you know where to go to fill up the propane tank on the 'Falia?  
We would like to top up, but we have no idea how much we currently have 
or where to go to get some more.  Any suggestions, Oh learned ones?

By the way - Iv'e camped at Red Rock, and it's gorgeous, not barren.
And we have a backpacker and we love it too!

Alice
