Hi All:

Now that &quot;Das Boot&quot; is fixed and ship-shape, my travel plans point me 
west-ward from Chicago through Montana, on to Seattle, down to San-Francisco 
and then back through Colorado...round trip in two weeks time.
My question is: What are the engine RPM compared to MPH, ie, 75 mph = ? RPM 
etc. ( I have a clock not a tach). I want to figure fuel, etc. during my 
trip as well as get the best RPM for cruising speed without undue engine 
wear. (the engine has about 94,200 miles on it.)

Thanks

Matt
