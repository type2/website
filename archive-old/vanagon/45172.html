Subject: funny swap meet story

        At the Vallejo show, I performed a remarkable feat of human error.

        This guy had these little model barndoor busses for sale, $15 each.
Being the math whiz I am, I offered him $40 for the pair, to which he
replied, &quot;Sorry, can't do it.&quot;  I then realized my mathematical error, and
hurried away so I could laugh.  The guy was so adamant about not lowering
his price at all that he didn't even realize I'd offered $10 more than he
was asking!
