Subject: Kick Panels

Hey Volks,

I see lots of posts of people building their own kick panels.  I
attempted this using birch plywood, with partial success.  One
cracked, and the other one is OK, but could be better.  

In my other bus, the kick panels are that pressed paperboard material,
about 3/16 inch thick.  They look original.  By the way both of these
busses are Westys.

Anyway, I would appreciate any input on the making of replacement
panels without spending the $38 that some people want for
replacements.

Thanks!!

Royal
