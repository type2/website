Subject: List Mug Update


Howdy all, I just thought I'd give a status report about the coffee mugs. I met
with the artwork preparers Monday. I gave them the printing dimensions for the
mugs, and they're doing all the sizing and color separations for me. Once I get
that back, I'll send in the order to the printers. I still don't have a
definate delivery time yet, but it should be within the next month, if all goes
well...
 I have met the quota of Search and Rescue mugs, so if you want one, ORDER IT
NOW. I will not be ordering extras, since I've met the minimum, so once I place
the order for those, that's it for that design. I still have a few spots left
in the travel mug category, and oh, about 100 or so regular 4-bus mugs to go...
Anyway, just thought I'd pass the word along. Many thanks to those who have
ordered...
