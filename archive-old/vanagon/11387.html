&gt;     and he confirmed that the internal combustion engine is about 40% 
&gt;     efficient on a good day which gives us about 70 HP lost in heat etc. 
&gt;     that's about 50,000 watts, wow.

And I'm sure that's an average figure.  I'll bet our beloved air boxers are
worse than this. No matter how we feel, they are smog-churning gas wasters.
I had a FI Toyota 4-Runner (4 cyl. 2.4 liter engine) that got 27.5-33 mpg
on the highway at 55 mph.  With more power, and heat in the winter.  But
whenever I drove the beast, I missed my van.  When I had to get rid of it,
I bought a van.
Go figure.

Has anyone installed one of those new, $2000 fuel injection systems that
are available for the old 1600?
