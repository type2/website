&gt;Help!  My odometer is frozen.  I think it is related to the trip meter
&gt;which, when you push the button, clears to zero, but then only moves 1 to
&gt;2/10ths.
&gt;Can someone share your experiences about fixing this problem or replacing
&gt;the unit.  Junk yard? Rebuilt? If you have to replace the unit, can I swap
&gt;for a tach unit also? (Mine has an analog clock).
&gt;Thanks,

The plastic gear that drives the odemeter tends to crack.  This has been a
problem with all VDO speedos since they switch that gear from brass to
plastic back in 73 or so.  Notice how nobody has an odometer that works
properly.  Gear not available.  You may be able to sldie it off and crazy
glue or epoxy it back on the shaft.

If you want to install the later housing with the tach, you will nedd to do
some minor rewiring as the pin outs are different.  Use bentley to identify
the differences.

Dennis.
