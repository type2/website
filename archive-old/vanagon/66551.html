Subject:      Replacing radio antenna

Hello Vanfans:
I have an '85 vanagon with a fully retractable antenna housing implanted in
the wheelwell. At the moment a piece of utility wire is making enough
contact to give me reception. It however is more folkloric than the rest of
the vehicle and I'd like to replace it with a regular
non-retractable-still-sticking out antenna. The antenna I got from the
Auburn Hills Parts Place. I bought it thinking it would be as easy a
replacement as in a US vehicle.
Wrong! German engineering strikes again!
I've looked at it from many angles and I can't see the most efficient route.
Help.
What is the fastest and most efficient way to replace this antenna?

Thanks again

Leo
