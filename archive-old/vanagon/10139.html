&gt;&gt;&gt;Rust, Heck!  Move to Arizona!  No, the real enemy is entropy, and
&gt;&gt;&gt;I know of no cure.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Uh, living in Arizona is no solution either, it just takes longer to
&gt;&gt;happen here.  I've been trying to get my roof replaced since November,
&gt;&gt;and it just won't stop raining so they can do it.  :-(
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;In the past couple of years, some cancer has appeared in the 
&gt;&gt;side panels of the bus.  I guess when I start to lose things thru
&gt;&gt;the holes I'll have to fix them :-)   Anyway, I have living proof that
&gt;&gt;cars will rust without salt on the roads.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;

There would be no fun if vanagons never ever rusts. I guess living in the Bay
Area in California does become a bit bored. My 84 vanagon just doesn't seem
have a tiny patch of rust at all. Not just vanagon, Volvo does not rust either.
There has been a small spot on my hood hit by a flying rock on HW 101. The spot
exposed the shiny metal and NO RUST has ever developed after something like 3
years.  I went to Yosemite national park last winter (1993) and drove the vanagon
on Yosemite's salty roads. I just realized that I had driven the vanagon on salty
roads. Luckily, I still do no see any rust any where.
