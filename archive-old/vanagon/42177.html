Subject: '79 Bus FS

 I have a non running 1979 Bus for sale in Rhode Island.  It cracked a ring
 3d years ago and I bought a 914 porsche to use the engine but never
 finished the job.  Im looking for someone to adopt ASAP.  The body is in
 very good structural shape and set up to travel.  Its been to Alaska and
 all around the lower 48.  I has a hard shell 2.5 foot fiberglass shell on
 top allowing you to stand in the bus and store stuff in front and back.
