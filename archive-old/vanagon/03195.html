Subject: Installing a tape deck into 69 bus
Thought I had this one wrapped but JC Whipme didn't carry it any more. I need
to put my radio-tape deck in my 69 camper. Any suggestions as to a source for
an installation kit. The radio hole is already cut and I just want something
that will hold well and look ok. Any ideas? I don't know if bug solutions
would apply.
