Subject:      A little caravan?

B and I would like to do New Brunswick for the next week.  Maybe even Nova
Scotia/PI.  Anyone else in the area want to try it?  I guess the bridge to
the Island is really a time-saver.

The EVC has passed all tests, thanks to everyone, except for the gas guage
needle. Does the guage needle drop within three miles of a topped tank or
does it wait to drop for several miles.  I'm hoping it's several
miles....even many miles!!
