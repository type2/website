So King, Robert says:
&gt; 
&gt; The guy selling them was not home but his (elderly sounding) wife
&gt; was....Basically established (fairly sure) that one is a split microbus with
&gt; barn doors .... the other is a split single cab!......both have been under
&gt; cover (carport anyway) and the 1600 is thrown in.  The guy will be home after
&gt; 6:00 tonight so I'll get the whole story on year, more info on condition etc
&gt; and look at them tomorrow.......
&gt; 
&gt; How do I tell my wife I am going to look at TWO more splitties?  Do I look and
&gt; possibly buy and THEN tell her?  Do I casually mention it first?  HELP ADVICE
&gt; NEEDED.
&gt; 

Hi Robert,

What you should do is tell me where they are and I'll see to it that you
won't have to argue with your wife. Yeah, Yeah, that's the ticket, I'll a, 
take care of em' for ya, yeah.....  ;)

Anyway, I was in your same situation about 5 months ago.  I just told my
wife flat out about a '59 pickup in the paper thinking that she would say
&quot;yeah right, no way.&quot;  But she suprised be and told me to go have a look
see.  She even let me take a large amount of cash with me to boot.  
So give it a shot.  Ya never know...

Good Luck,

Steven
