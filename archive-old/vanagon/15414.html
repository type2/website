Subject: Re: rusted vent-wings

that's the ticket mon. I did the same for my bus and areberderchi (sp?) or
is that hasta la vista frustrating leaks. Those 3/4 windows almost always
seem to be decomposed


&gt;        Then came the fun.  Bye-bye frustrating leak- I kicked the *poop*
&gt;outta
&gt;that whole back side window- vent wing and 3/4 glass- and replaced it with a
&gt;pretty-lookin' new seal encircling my 1-PIECE window.
&gt;        No more leaks there, mom.
