Subject: Syncronizing dual carbs?

My 74 camper with a 1800 has stock dual carbs (solex 34-32 PDSIT 2,3.  I 
bought the van used and the carbs have never been set since I had it.
Both the Idiot guide and the Haynes manual give methods that require 
the use of a sync-meter of some 
kind.  They call it a uni-sync.  I have not been able to obtain one yet.  
All garages just look at me funny, even the ones specializing in VW's.  I 
don't like to risk my vehicles with garages.  The manual specifically 
says not to use the 'listen to the hiss' technique.  One VW guy said that 
is what they do.  Has anybody synchronized their carbs with or with out a 
meter?  If so how and if you used a meter where did you get it?  
I am planning on taking them off and rebuilding them.  I like to start from 
scratch and do it right. 
 Any tips on setting up the carbs would be appreciated.  
The van appears to be runnin rich the tail pipe is lined with a nice tell 
tale lining of black soot.
The ignition system has been replaced from points to plugs and timing set 
to 10 degrees ATDC with both vacuum hoses attached at idle with a light.
