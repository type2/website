Subject: Autobahn filters are made by FRAM !?


Yes, it's true, or so says the senior FLAPS guy after talking with FRAM 
office. I don't buy it, but anyhow.... the story.
   It came out that a local garage had put one on a Jetta, still under 
warranty. The oil pressure went south and the Jetta spun its main bearings. 
So the garage and owner went looking for blood. VW said get lost, it's not 
our filter.  FRAM said get lost, we make Autobahns filters.  The real 
culprit?  Oil pressure relief valve had stuck wide open, back to you, VW dealer.
    Do I think that the FRAM was not guilty?  Well, several exploded FRAM 
filters have been mentioned on the Porsche list and poblems on this list. 
I'd bet the FRAM put the pressure up so high so fast that the relief valve 
piston blasted open into areas never before explored/anticipated and got 
hung up, just a theory. 

and...  has anyone with a vanagon PS system replaced the filter in the 
reservoir. Any alternate suppliers? VW would like $35 for one, on top of $35 
for the 'zecret fluid'.  This is getting too costly.  Bentley says ATF 
Dextron fluid, may rinse with it first. My fluid looks like rusty bath 
water, anyone flushed theirs out? Tips?  TIA
