&lt;&lt;  these only came in grey velour, tho you could always re-upholster since
the
 seatcovers are the same as the front seats. (get a spare front seat and use
 the cover off it) &gt;&gt;

Oops, I meant to add on my previous message that the rear facing seats use
bottom cushions that are shorter than the front buckets.  I imagine that
front bucket covers could be used, but a little adaptation would be required.
