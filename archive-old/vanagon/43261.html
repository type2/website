Please note that I've put you down for potluck contributions for
dinner.  You can also serve your &quot;time&quot; by doing breakfast.  :)  
Remember, that we need donations of food for two days, not just one,
so if you sign up for say, an entree on Friday eve., it would be
great for you to do something on Sat., too.  

Looks like there'll be a good turn out for this one.  Bradley and
I and whoever else from the bay area who would like to carpool/caravan
with us are hoping to leave here on Thursday evening, in order to
get to the site ASAP on Friday morning, to save our prime spot right
by the river like last time.

Now seems as good a time as any to tell you that this is camping
in the real wild, i.e., no toilets or outhouses.  Bring yer shovel
and a book.  :)  Of course there's also no faucets, AC, etc.  It's
basically just the trees and the river, the stars, us, and some
roaring 5K degree inferno we'll be sitting around.  If you have
any spare ballons and butane, you might want to throw them in for
extra entertainment.  Also, old canned goods - or, just anything 
fun to blow up, explode, sacrifically burn, etc.  

Here's some more things you'll want to have along:

firewood (much as you can stand to bring!)
water - lots, otherwise it's just the river
toilet paper  :)
ice
drinks
lawn chairs, plus some extra for those who forget
sunblock
sun glasses
fishing gear
any magnesium you don't want
tables
first-aid stuff (we're kind of far out in the wilds)
CB's (channel 2, as in Type 2)
extra gas (not a lot of places to buy it up there)
anti-insect stuff (not sure about this, but someone warned it may be a problem)

For those of you coming from the east, I understand Tioga opens
tomorrow, and that Sherman pass will probably open soon.  You
should definitely call beforehand to check on both, since there
is some serious hill-climbing around there.  We'll be offroading 
a bit to get to this spot, and I'm working on directions - will
have them for you probably in the last week before we depart.
Basically, we'll be at a space in the Sequoia National Forest, about
one mile below lower Peppermint, and this area is about 23 miles NE
of Caliofrnia Hot Sprints, all NE of Lake Isabella, vaguely east of
Bakersfield, to orient you all.  OUrs will be Campsite #5, off
to the left on the road we take up to get there.  Please fill
with gas first, and make sure your tires will tolerate a bit
of offroading.  As I mentioned, I'll be coming early on, but those
of you wishing to come later, may want to try and meet somewhere
ahead of time and do this en masse, especially with one of us
who's been to the stie before.

Stay tuned...
