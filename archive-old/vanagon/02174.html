&gt;Okay, its time I asked, what exactly is a &quot;dropped&quot; or &quot;sucked&quot;
&gt;valve?  And I'm sure i know what a burnt valve is, but maybe you
&gt;guys can tell me just so I know fer sure.  And how do these things
&gt;manifest themselves.

david said it best, about the big end of the valve breaking/snapping off
and being 'sucked' or 'dropping' into what used to be the combustion chamber.
i said 'used to be', cause when that sucker lets go, you don't have any
combustion chamber anymore. :(  mine broke (yes, BROKE) the piston, gouged
all manner of metal out of the head, twisted the rod, and some pieces got
down into the crank.

how does it manifest itself? well, hopefully you mean BEFORE it breaks.
cause AFTER it breaks, there will be NO doubt in your mind. it is the most
horrible sound you can imagine coming out of a machine. really really loud
and sickening. and when the engine stops, the silence is incredibly expensive.

how did mine happen? because i mis-read the manuals. i thought ALL beetle
engines could go about 100,000 miles on a set of valves. i didn't comprehend
the part about buses being stressed more, and needing new valves at 70,000
miles. mine made it until 88,000 miles before #3 exhaust valve dropped/
sucked/broke. but that was a 71 bus. and my 80 bus went 110,000 without any
problems.
