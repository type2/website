Before someone else beats me to it:  there is no new bug.  VW is 
building a front engine, front wheel drive, water-cooled car that has 
a rounded body that sits on the frame of a current design.  They are 
going to make money on this.  Many of us will probably by them.  
However, I think it does some injustice to the 20 some million 
air-cooled VW's that were made to call this new contraption a bug.
