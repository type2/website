Hal Roth queried:

&gt;While I'm at it I have another question for the EV faction on the list:
&gt;has any of you purchased a set of floor mats from VW? I did and have had
&gt;a constant problem with the rear mat (in the &quot;cabin&quot; under the table) not
&gt;staying in place. We flatten it out, even pin it under the fiberboard panel
&gt;under the third row (bench)seat, and it always comes up in a hump in the
&gt;middle that all of us are constantly tripping over. Any experience with this
&gt;problem and solutions??


yes.

our's does the same thing; 'bunches up in a hump between the two rear-
facing jump seats.

solution(s)?  

well, i haven't found one yet...short of applying heat and fusing the damn 
thing to the OEM carpet underneath, about the only other thing I can think
of is to apply velcro strips to the bottom and stomp on that sucker!

eagerly awaiting fixes to this incredibly technical problem w/ EVs   ;-)
