Hi Mike.  It is my understanding that all vehicles that have either 
and/or ABS or full time (AWD) four wheel drive have to have tires 
that are within 10% treadwear.  The idea is that the wheels are 
supposed to rotate at the same speeds.  If they don't the systems try 
and compensate for the odd ball sized wheel, putting unnecessary wear 
on the system.

&gt; occured in the past 15,000 miles.  Could having different tires in the front
&gt; and rear affect the read of the viscous coupling???
&gt; 

Ideally, all four tires should be the same size/make/model to ensure 
proper outside wheel diameters, and ensure that all four corners have 
the same amout of available traction available.  Rotating tires makes 
an all time importance with AWD and/or ABS vehicles to ensure that 
all tires wear at the same rates.  I rotate tires every 12000 km 
(apprx 7400 miles).

Hope this helps.

Harry.
