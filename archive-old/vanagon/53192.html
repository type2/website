Subject: Re: Forget the Drums, How do you get the Lug nuts OFF!

     Hi All,
     
       O.K., I'm off to buy a six foot length of pipe to &quot;ASSIST&quot; in 
     getting the lug nuts off.  Just one more question.  Where does 
     everybody stow these essential devices for when they get a flat on the 
     side of the road?  Will anti seize on the studs or regular tire 
     rotations prevent this problem in the future for road side repairs 
     (O.K. that was two questions).  
     
     Regards,
     
     Vince.

&gt;      Well I attempted to put to use all the good advice I got on how to 
&gt;      pull (maybe hammer would be a better description) the drums off the 
&gt;      '85 Vanagon.  However, I naively assumed it would be easy to get the 
&gt;      wheels off--I could not remove even one of the lug nuts.   I have 
&gt;      tried penetrating oil soaked over night, heat from a propane torch, &amp; 
&gt;      a six point impact socket and 2 foot breaker bar.
     
Just to make sure; you are turning counter-clockwise, right?  
     
OK, get a longer pipe.  I use one that slips over my lug wrench, about 6 
feet long.  I really don't put them on that tight, it's just that they tend 
to set up over time and the 6-footer makes it nice and easy to remove the 
lugs.
