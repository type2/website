Subject: Re: Euro-Winnebago Complaint (long)

&gt; In our experience, despite careful attention to the=20
&gt; directions in the Owner's Manual (pp. 78 - 93), it is=20
&gt; impossible to demist the windows when the ambient=20
&gt; temperature is -10=BAC or less.  In more severe weather such=20
&gt; as -20=BAC, the inside surfaces of the side windows are=20
&gt; actually covered in a layer of ice. When outside=20
&gt; temperatures are -20=BAC temperatures at foot level, even in=20
&gt; the front, are as low as 0=BAC.  Any passengers in the rear=20
&gt; seat are typically wearing a sleeping bag =96 this in a 1995=20
&gt; vehicle!
&gt; The driver is armed with a windshield scraper.

Admittedly there is an extreme difference between Canada and the DC area...

I don't have any of these problems.

&gt; We note that, unlike the non-camper Eurovan, there is no=20
&gt; rear auxiliary heat exchanger or fan,  nor is there a floor=20
&gt; mounted air outlet.  (We anticipate that the air=20
&gt; conditioning in the camper will be as deficient as the=20
&gt; heating.)  Furthermore, the outlets shown at the base of the=20
&gt; windshield in the graphic on Page 84 of the owner's manual=20
&gt; are missing. =20

I think you might be compleining to the wrong folks.  VW made a box. =20
Winnebago made it a camper.  The problems in the rear area are Winnie's=20
fault.  Their modifications are what is inadequate.

&gt; Our primary concern is safety.  Being unable to clear=20
&gt; windows is very dangerous.  Our second concern is comfort. =20
&gt; No one should have to huddle for warmth in a vehicle costing=20
&gt; in excess of $40,000.

Thats true.  but again, the rear heating is not provided in VW's empty=20
box.  Winnie should have added rear climate control to the rear passenger=
=20
compartment.

&gt; We believe that Volkswagen's cold weather testing of this=20
&gt; vehicle was seriously flawed.  A van of this size clearly=20
&gt; requires an auxiliary heat exchanger.  We would like your=20
&gt; response to our comments as soon as possible. =20

The vehicle never went back to VW after the Winnebago modifications.

&gt; P.S.  Our two previous vehicles were VW Westfalias.  The=20
&gt; 1988 Wasserboxer had a terrific heating system (and leaky=20
&gt; head gaskets).

The EV heating and cooling is excellent in mu opinion.  It takes longer=20
to warm up then my S10 pickup but after that everything else is better. =20
Okay I've noticed the windshield wipers ice too fast.  A better defroster=
=20
would be helpful in this.  I think this is likely to be due to the more=20
heavily raked windshield.  The defroster hits too high on the windshield=20
to warm the wipers through the glass that low.

&gt; Dear Mr. Herbert
&gt;=20
&gt; Thank you for your correspondence dated January 14, 1996=20
&gt; regarding your concerns about the design and serviceability=20
&gt; of your vehicle.  We apologize for the inconvenience that=20
&gt; this matter has caused.
&gt;=20
&gt; We appreciate your taking the time to share your thoughts=20
&gt; with us, as letters such as yours keep us in touch with the=20
&gt; customer's point of view.  It is only through information=20
&gt; received directly from Volkswagen owners that we can=20
&gt; determine where improvements, extensions, or changes might=20
&gt; be required.
&gt;=20
&gt; We share your concerns regarding the difficulties you have=20
&gt; experienced with your defrosting and heating systems in your=20
&gt; Eurovan Camper.  Repairs are never welcome.  While we cannot=20
&gt; guarantee every  vehicle will be defect free, it is our=20
&gt; belief that, should a defect occur, it will make itself=20
&gt; evident well within the terms of our limited new vehicle=20
&gt; warranty.
&gt;=20
&gt; We want to assure you that by taking the time to write, your=20
&gt; concerns about the design of the defrosting and heating=20
&gt; systems will be noted by the appropriate departments within=20
&gt; our company.  We have taken the liberty of forwarding a copy=20
&gt; of your correspondence to our Product Planning Department.
&gt;=20
&gt; Please be advised that one of our highest priorities is=20
&gt; customer satisfaction, and we make every effort to provide=20
&gt; reliable products and service to our customers.  Thank you=20
&gt; for taking the time to write, and for allowing us the=20
&gt; opportunity to respond to your concerns.

This is a pretty standard form letter kind of thing.  But you do have to=20
ask yourself.  What do you want them to do?  You didn't ask for something=
=20
specifically.  I doubt they could retrofit a MV/GL style passenger A/C=20
heating system underneath the Winnie stuff.  I don't know what they did=20
with the Westy topped Weekenders.

When I looked at the Winnie conversions I decided they were not suitable=20
for my needs.  I think I'm glad I didn't look any closer or try to sell=20
myself. =20

I suspect Westfalia ordered a more suitable version of the transporter=20
than Winnebago. =20
