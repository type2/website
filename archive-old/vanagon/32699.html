Subject: Re: Need Advice on Window Changes on Rumba

I added one of these windows (they're called jalouse I think maybe) to the
sliding door on my 74 and I think it's real nice. Rattles a bit but not too
much. They don't leak at all. Two would make for a nice, bug free breeze.
Not too hard to install--gotta drill about sixteen small holes to screw 'em
on.

&gt;hey now,
&gt;
&gt;i have access to 2 side windows from the donor '71 westy that my interior
&gt;comes from. the kinda that you can roll out and that have screens on them.
&gt;i'd like to hear some discussion on whether i should put them on my '74
&gt;transporter. hell, will they even fit? advantages and disadvantages? will
&gt;i be able to get a tight seal? your help would be greatly appreciated!
