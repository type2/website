Bright RED?  Whoa.

&gt;I examined the exhaust pipe, and it is not double
&gt;walled. So to insulate the wall of the exhaust pipe from the wood,
&gt;I want to open up the wood portion of the hole through the floor
&gt;so that it never touches the exhaust pipe. I'd like to hear opinions on
&gt;this...

I'd be surprised if the exhaust pipe got hot enough to cause any kind of
fire damage.
