Subject: the false Joe Clark


Ya know, I saw a band called the Hypnotic Clam Bake out of Boston while I was 
up at the Rooney Festival in Deposit, NY this August.  They did a song called 
old Joe Clark.

John 70 bus 

someday I'll have to get myself one of those new fangled email editors

by the way .. could somebody please forward digests 231, 232, and 233.  For 
some reason I did not receive them.   Thanx
