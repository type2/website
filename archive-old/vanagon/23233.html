Subject:  pilot bearing q (was hard shifting q) 

problem (to refresh your memory): the van goes into gear (the stick
moves into the correct positions) as smooth as ever without the engine
running, but as soon as i start, it won't go into gear at all (except it'll move
toward, but not into, reverse with a huge GRIND).  if i put it in gear with
engine off, clutch in, it turns over but wont start.

listmember tim smith says that the pilot bearing is shot/seized, and i
believe him, it seems to make sense.  i have a question though: i talked to
a vw mechanic near here and he said that if the pilot bearing were shot,
it would be making noise that i could definitely hear.  is the mechanic
wrong  (i hope)?  i'd like to clear that up before i scrape together the $
and time to replace the pilot/release bearing, clutch plate, and pressure
plate.  thanks.
