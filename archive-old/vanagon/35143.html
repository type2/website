Subject: Lighting up Little Martha


	Saturday afternoon we worked on Little Martha and got the right rear
side marker lamp wired and working, cleaned and tightened the contact
for the left turn-signal/brakelight, and were present when the right
low-beam fixed itself. Wierdly enough, removing the two fuses that I 
*thought* supplied the low-beams resulted in the right one that hadn't been 
lit now lighting up... ????

	I called my brother in case this was some known wierdness like the
way beetle (and for all I know Bus) backup lights take power from
the switched (not points) primary side of the coil... misconnect it and 
putting the car in reverse kills the engine...

	Anyway he said no, he hadn't heard of a characteristic
problem where pulling a fuse out enabled the low-beam only...
(Couldn't be a simple ground problem, the high beam works AND
ground buzzed-out correctly AND the hot leads for both low and high
read 12V when operated... apparently the low-beam's 12V was through a
much higher resistance...)

	Re-installing the removed fuses didn't create any new problems,
so I'm assuming that (1) I mis-identified the fuses for the low-beams
(2) the extra torque/vibration of my removing the fuses rubbed some
somnambulent connection back to life. 

	I'm going to have to spend 10 minutes and pull each fuse in turn
to find out what doesn't work when I do so I know what each does- I
have 12 fuses and they don't seem to corespond to the simplest comparison
to the schematic in the Bentley manual. Maybe they do if I look at them
backwards or upside down. 

	Having said all that, I'm now fairly sure I now why I don't
have back-up lights- the bulbs are wired and the switch(es) in the
tranny are wired, but there's no supply connection! I'm going to
have to find the supply wire and fish it up to the switched primary 
side of the coil. Ahha! Ok, well at least I now have a plan. The
Bentley rumors that there's an in-line fuse for this circuit, which
would be nice-somewhere between the coil and the tranny switch for example.

	Can anyone conform this? Little Martha is a '70.

	That'll leave the dome light, which is disassmebled now
and just needs to be figured out, the emergency blinker which doesn't
work at all, and new screws for the license plate lamp. A friend is on
business in Luxembourg at the moment and he's been kind enough to send 
me two packages of metric sheet metal screws. One of those two sizes 
ought to work for the license plate lamp. 

	The Bentley specifies which terminals of the emergency blinker
should be 0 ohms when the swich is operated. I suspect one or more
isn't. The turn signals work, so the relay is ok, all that can be left
is the switch. Jumpers should prove that assertion. A new or junk-yard
switch should settle the issue. Courtesy of Brian Verbeek in the Netherlands,
I have the correct tool for removing and installing those switches!

	At that point I believe I can pass the safety inspection, so time 
to put on the other axle, get the temporary registration and try driving it!
