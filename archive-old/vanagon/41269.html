Subject: KYB shocks for the vanagon

Hello Vanagonians,

I had posted my experience with KYB shocks a couple of months ago
so the exact details are in the archives. But the short story is
I'm very happy with them, not too hard to install and provide a
nice firm ride and good handling. Well worth the cost of $88 for
the front pair and $90 for the rear. They have a life time warranty.
I got them from a FLAPS.
