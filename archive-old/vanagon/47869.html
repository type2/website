Subject: Toledo show, Sun. 8/4!


Howdy Volks,

        the Greater Toledo VW Club show goes down this Sunday 8/4 at the
Sundance Kid Drive In Theater in Oregon, Ohio (on Rt. 2).  Looks to be a
great show!

        Some folks will be driving down from Michigan Sunday morning, and
some of us will be leaving Saturday PM &amp; camp out near the show.  Also, it
looks like we'll be pitching in on a $15 swap meet space.  Drop me a line
for more info on the swap space.

        It looks like my family and Mark &amp; Betsy['62 Kombi w/ tent] (and
maybe Jack['62 Beetle] and Matt &amp; Faith['67 Westy] and Eric['71
Sportsmobile]) will be going camping Saturday night at Maumee Bay State
Park, which is right on lake Erie only a couple of miles from the show
site.  Camping there is $15 per site, with 6 people max per site.  We're
planning on sharing sites to split costs.  Pets are $1.  No reservations
are accepted; phone the park on Saturday to make sure there are spaces.  I
have been assured that we can virtually plan on there being plenty of space
(it's not a holiday weekend).  The park's number is 419.836.7758.  MBSP is
decked out with all of the modern conveniences (flush toilets, etc.) and
has ~1/2mile of beach, swimming, trails, etc.  (...so I'm told; I've never
been there!:)

        Send me email directly if you're interested in joining us for the
campout.  I've promised a pancake breakfast Sunday morning, so I'll need to
know how many I'm cooking for. :)  We might even be able to scrounge up
extra tent space for anybody who's not decked out with camping gear.  We'll
hit the show in timely fashion just as things get rolling on Sunday.
Weather forecast is dry, dry, dry for the weekend!  If you need directions
to the show or the campsite, drop me a line.  For those departing Sunday AM
for Ohio, I can help organize a caravan if y'all want to cruise down
together.

See you Sunday!
