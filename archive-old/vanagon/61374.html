Subject: Rear Wiper Motor source

A while back someone from the list emailed me mentioning that they
were looking for a source to find a rear wiper motor, as the one from the
dealer was around $300.

I lost your email address, but said that I'd look up the number for 
the parts place.  (A VW junkyard in MI) their number is 1-810-373-2300

Good luck!

Anyone else have any places you might find a used rear wiper motor?
