 The older you get, the more fires you have seen, and you get more cautious.
  Probably the safest place to carry an extra gas can is in the luggage rack
 of a vw camper.  There are still disadvantages to this, but it sure beats
 carrying it inside the van.  I feel the same way about Coleman fuel-I get
 nervous carrying it around inside the vehicle makes me nervous.  &gt;&gt;

I've run out of gas more times than I'd like to admit.  As insurance, I
bought a gas can that's made to fit inside the space at the center of the
spare tire.  I made a bracket thing to hold it inside the Vanagon's spare
tire, should the tire become dislodged in an accident.  The can was quite
expensive at around $75 (from Griot's Garage).  Of course, since carrying the
 &quot;insurance&quot; gas, I haven't had occasion to use it.
