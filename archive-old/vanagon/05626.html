Subject: Fibre glass bus bumpers

     Specifically for Marcus but anyone else who's interested.
     
     Marcus asked for the address of the guy who makes the 
     fibre glass bumpers for splits and bay windows in England.
     
     Here goes:
     
     P.E.Barton
     Old Bakery
     Sidney St
     Chesterfield
     Derbyshire
     England.
     
     Tel: +44 246-209-549 or 0246-209-549 (UK)
     
     I enquired about 6 months ago and the prices in pounds were as 
     followed for '71 bus bumpers:
     
     Front:  centre section  45
             steps section   23 each
            
     Rear:   complete        75
     
     
     Have fun,
     
     Lee.
