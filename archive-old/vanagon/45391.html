Subject: Westy stove output

Has anybody ever drilled out the orifice in the burner valves of a Westy
stove ? I've been thinking about trying to increase the output of the 2
burners.  I firgure that I can go up 1 or 2 sizes and dramatically increase
the usefulness of the stove. Any thoughts or suggestions are always welcomed.
