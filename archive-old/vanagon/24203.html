Subject: Re: more bug o rama - BUSGIRL

&gt;
&gt;My sweetie and I managed to make it down to the Bug O Rama as well,
&gt;later in the day.  Looked like a lot of the good swap stuff was gone,
&gt;but picked up a couple things, including the ever-so-elusive '71 bus
&gt;air cleaner. 
&gt;
&gt;Anyway, there was a split bus with &quot;BUSGIRL&quot; plates.  Did a double
&gt;take, and then a doule check, to make sure Martha wasn't holding out
&gt;on us :-).  Nope, somebody else...

Shoot, I think I have two spare '71 ish air cleaners.

Eug,
'71
