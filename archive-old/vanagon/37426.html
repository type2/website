Subject:  4-pos. windshield wiper

Hey all,
Well, it doesn't matter much to me if intermittent wipers can be had with a
relay as the wiper switch on my '78 has only three positions:

Push it up a little = single wipe
first click = low speed
second click = high speed

Tried pushing it down but it didn't wanna go.  Now, when you say
pushing it down, do you mean down as in toward your lap or down like
the opposite of the washer function?  I just now thought of that.  

Anyway, I don't think I got it.

Sean
