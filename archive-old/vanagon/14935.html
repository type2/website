Subject: Re: Parts Place Mats

&gt;OK. Here is my $0.02.

&gt;..their rubber floor mats! These cost only about $30 plus shipping; they
&gt;are made for Vanagon.

Derek, do these cover the whole floor, over the hump/shift lever base and up 
the front wall? If not, do they sell a full size one, like my panel has in 
it? I hate carpet!!! tim s.
