Subject: Will Vgn middle bench seat fit Westy? (was: Jump Seats) 

&gt;Anyone know what's need to make that jump seat fit in the middle 
&gt;section of my Westy, that is, behind the passenger seat? 


On a similar note, can the middle bench seat from a regular Vanagon be fit 
into a Westy?  At quick glance, it looks like the middle seat tracks might 
still be under the Westy carpet. But I'm not sure if the bench seat is too 
long to fit between the sink/stove cabinet and the sliding door.  If it did 
fit, you could just clamp it in when you needed 2 extra seats, and pull it 
out relatively easily when you needed the room instead, just as in a 
regular Vanagon.  Then again, I've never seen it done before in a Westy, 
which might be indication that it doesn't fit.  Has anybody tried it or 
measured it?
