&gt;&gt;I'd rather buy for my van for that much money. I just have to settle for my
&gt;&gt;little Schabak Vanagon model that sits on my monitor, and is even the same
&gt;&gt;color as my '87. Now I need a blue one to match my '85.
&gt;
&gt;and where might I get one of these?

fer you folks in the Atlanta area, check the yellow pages under Hobbies for
Automotif or Automobilia or something like that in Smyrna. it's tucked in a
corner of a little shopping center. i usually get there by getting off the
beltway at Paces Ferry-Vinings exit. lots of car toys, magazines, etc.
not tooo much on vw buses, but he had a few Schabak vanagons (gold colored)
not too long ago. and he gets in a few Rocco tiny ones every now and then.
