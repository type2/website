Subject: Digijet help needed!!

Volks,
I have an '84 Vanagon with about 8000 miles on a complete rebuild. 
Recently I have been having problems with the digijet system, the 
engine losses power while cruising between 2300-3000 rpms and after 
driving fairly hard the idle creeps to about 1200rpm. This has been an 
on and off problem for a few weeks, but today as i was waiting at a 
light (the engine was up to temp, but was warm), the idle dropped and 
the engine stalled. I got it restarted but I had to constantly rev it 
for about 5 minutes once it was &gt;3000 rpm the emgine felt fine, smooth 
and powerful. After 5mins everything seemed fine. Once I was home I 
let it sit and idle and it almost lost it twice but it recovered on 
its own.
???
Any input would be greatly appreciated!!!!
Thanks
