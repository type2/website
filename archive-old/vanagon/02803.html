&gt;Well, it finally happened. Pulling out of the parking
&gt;garage yesterday, going from first to second, the clutch
&gt;cable broke.
&gt;
This is NOT unusual for the '71.  I also have that model, and have a spare
cable on hand at all times.  I guess they twist around more than on the Bug
'cause I've had to change the cable on the bus 4 times and have NEVER had to
change a bug cable in 8 years of VW adventures with 7 different beetles.

&gt;Where can I get a new clutch cable for a '71 Bus? Will the
&gt;UFLVWD (Unfriendly local VW dealer) have one? Will I have
&gt;any luck at the FLAPS? Should I call up Recycled Bugs?
&gt;Who else?
&gt;What will it cost me?
&gt;Are there any tricks or tips for a quick and painless installation
&gt;and anything I should do to make sure the next one lasts 23 years?

Haven't had any trouble finding cables, but the price varies a lot from
13-25 bucks.  It is easy to install.  Just be sure to put plenty of grease
on the cable and don't leave off the chatter clip at the front.  They can
be bought separately.  When you get ready to tighten up the wing nut, hold
the end of the cable so it won't twist around.  You might get 4-5 years out
of it then.  Enjoy.
