Yes, I have seen them, and I love them. They have all the comforts of
home, or those larger winnebago, without the large bulkiness. 
A bathroom, with a shower, a kitchen with range an optional microwave,
refrigerator, and sink. T.V. and CD stereo. Air conditioner and furnace.
WOW, I could go on, but back to reality 38,000 dollars. ouch!
I have a full color brochure, if anyone wants to make copies for anyone
else, or place it on a web page, or on file.
BTW, I was told that you may be able to get a diesel option with these,
but I didn't research that option.

&gt; &gt; Second tip, if anyone does decide to go up into Sequoia, e-mail me and
&gt; &gt;     I will dig up the directions to a wonderful, one/two lane road that
&gt; &gt;     ran from the Grant Grove area back down to the valley. It is on some
&gt; &gt;     maps, but not all.  4wd not required, but no Winnebagos, either.
&gt; 
&gt; Speaking of Winnebagos, has anyone seen the Rialta model which is based on
&gt; the Eurovan?  What did you think of it?
