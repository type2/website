Subject: Rumba Rebuild on the Way...need some advice

hey now,

well, finally got motivated to get Rumba to my friend Sean's shop. we are
gonna see what needs to be done. gotta drop the engine..see what kinda
damage was done to the heads when the valve seat dropped. i'm going all out
if i need a rebuild. got some heater boxes to put on, going to install gauges,
maybe a new carb, new tin, etc. also, anyone know how hard it is to repair the
sagging rear end syndrome? i know it's a b**tch but what exactly is the
procedure for doing it? i really want to do it right, and not use the coil
springs or anything like that. also will hopefully be getting her painted.
any suggestions on what style or color? should i go with the stock or something
like a forest green metallic? how much hotter would that color make the inside
of the cab? ah, big projects. hopefully will have her ready to to roll by
july sometime in order to make it to Grassroots Festival in Ithaca, NY.

thanks,

jonathan
