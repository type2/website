Hi,

	Got the heater tubes installed.  They're a little short, but I
can engineer aorund that, I think.  The heater is silent now!  Yaaayyy!

	I also replaced the oil presuure switch, which turned out to
be the source of my leaks - NOT the crank pulley!  Yaaaaayyyy!A

	Now I just gotta see if there's a way to tone down the tranny
noise...

	I also ordered new rubber for the front windows. $150 for the whole
shebang, both doors.  Now I gotta get crackin on getting the frames cleaned
up and new glass cut...
	
Thom
