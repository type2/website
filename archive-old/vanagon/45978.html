&lt;&lt; Hi Bob -

Drag Link was dropped off at the UPS Center at 2:45 this afternoon.  Should
have it on Tuesday if UPS does it's thing right.

Too hot (106F) today - needed Air Conditioning - Went afterwards to the local
theater and watched Independence Day (ID4) - needed some escapism too - not a
bad flick either.

 &gt;&gt;

Jim,

Your day-off effort on my behalf is greatly appreciated.  The drag link is
the missing link in my front-end re-build.  I sorta jerked the other one
loose on the run to Kansas City, was pretty sure it wouldn't stand up very
much running off pavement up in the arctic.

The Inuvik run is supposed to take 23 days.  That's a hell of a big bag of
bagles.

-Bob
