Subject: RE: Passing Vanagons &amp; Westfalias

&gt;Just a comment about the Vanagons &amp; Westys seen in traveling.  I spent 2
&gt;days in Victoria,B.C. 2 weeks ago (I will be moving there in Sept. for a
&gt;sabbatical year).  While waiting for a bus on a Saturday afternoon near the
&gt;UVic campus I was startled to see 2 Westys pass in a couple minutes and 
&gt;started to count.  In just over 20 minutes till my bus came, I tallied 11
&gt;vanagons (all but 2 westys) 5 older westys and 4 older buses.  At one point
&gt;there were 3 westys in sight simultaneously.  I felt like I'd died and gone
&gt;to VW heaven. This density may be reflected by the list membership since I 
&gt;have noted at least 2 or maybe 3 subscribers from Victoria, which is not a 
&gt;particularly large city.  I will be taking my 1982 diesel-&gt;jetta GL gas West-
&gt;falia from Newfoundland to Victoria sometime in August (Now there's a megatrip
&gt; ;) )

Victoria is about 200000 people.  I live about 25 miles away.  Westys are a 
popular item; within three blocks of my home there are at least two other
Westys.  They are an extremely popular recreation vehicle in this area.  When
I go grocery shopping, I usually see one or two other Westys in the parking
lot.  

I think that Victoria has always been partial to Volkswagens;  until five
years ago, there were two dealerships, and that was before the population hit
170,000.  Now there is only one (large) VW dealership.  They sell Porsche too,
so every time I go for parts, I check out the Roadsters.
