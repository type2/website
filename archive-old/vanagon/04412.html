Excuse me, but piece of shit????  Most of the major changes to the
VW vans...or VWs in general which made them difficult to work
on or less reilable (ie: wasserboxers) were the result of US
mandated emission controls, safety equipment, etc. One could
also say some of the changes were mandated by the market place...
because of increased competition from Toyota, Nissan, hell even
the US manufacturers...

The beetle was taken off the US and eventually the European market
not because VW didn't want to sell it....but because the competition
was able to do, what the average driver wanted, better. The same
applies to the vans...the average driver just wants an appliance
like that piece of shit Caravan.
