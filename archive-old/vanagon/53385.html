Subject: Moving to Portland, Oregon from Raleigh, NC

Okay guys.

Guess this is it.  I'm heading out in the morning.

Thank you so much to the generous members who have offered their support should
it be needed.  I am deeply obliged.

I hope the road trip gods are smiling.

I'll be signing off till I get to Portland.

Joel Scratch one Raleigh, NC '87 Vanagon GL Westy from the statz.  Hopefully in
a couple of weeks you can add it to Portland.  More on that later.........
