Subject: Reenforced Deluxe splitties


Hi,

I was going over a guy's '67 Deluxe (a future list member??) and he had belly
pans on it.

Does anyone know if these belly pans have any structural purpose or are
they just to keep the floor healthy?

I was thinking of putting a Deluxe roof on my bus and was wondering if Deluxe
buses had any additional reinforcement.  With the roof open and the doors
open I had to wonder what the hell was keeping the front end attached to the
rear end?!?!?

What is the history behind these belly pans?  Did they only come on certain
models?  Where they always around?  Is it worth fabricating some for my bus?

Thanks for any info,
...Markus
