Subject: Re: Oil light flicker gone...

&gt; Current fix:   uhhhh, a VW oil filter (!!!) and a crankcase of 
&gt; Castrol 5-50 synthetic.  Now I won't even attempt to ascribe the fix 
&gt; to one or the other but the flickers are 100% gone.
&gt; 
This is EXACTLY what took care of my flickering oil light (also in '85 
1.9 Liter).  As soon as I drained the Mobil 1 5W 30 out (did not replace 
the almost new VW oil filter, though).  I'm left to believe that since so 
many of us have this common experience that nothing is wrong, kind of 
like the OXS and ALT lights that don't go out after starting until you 
tap the gas pedal.  By the way I had the flickering oil light with the VW 
oil filter, though--I think it's the oil.

Didn't VW Owner's Manual specifically mention that flickering oil light 
after extended period of high speed driving was of no concern (I know my 
'75 Rabbit book said this)--
