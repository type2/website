&gt;&gt; Also, I was considering seeing about
&gt;&gt;&gt;replacing the switch with one that also has pressure sending capability
&gt;&gt;&gt;for a oil pressure gauge. Any ideas or experience on this?
&gt;&gt;

I used steel brake line with proper adapters.I then bring tube up in front of
engine and mount sensor on top.  I use a VDO dual sensor that operates both
the gauge and the light.  I bracket the sender to the intake manifold so that
vibration does not affect the tubing.
