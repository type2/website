Subject: RE: VOLTAGE STABILIZER


&gt;DOES ANYONE KNOW if the voltage stabilizer is supposed to be insulated
&gt;from the back of the instrument cluster.  Everytime I try to fix my gas
&gt;gauge on my 74 westie it seems to die when I bolt the stabilizer to the
&gt;back of the gauges.  Please help I hate to run out of gas.  Erick


Well, I don't know specifically... but when I disconnected the old voltage
stabiliser on the '80 V6anagon, and soldered in another with a higher
voltage on top of it while leaving the old one mounted, I did not mount
the new one to anything-- it is held simply by the +12VDC and Ground
leads, and the third lead goes to a wire leading to the gauge.

And it works fine. Have you tried leaving the stabilizer unbolted, and
just supported by its leads? Works for me...
