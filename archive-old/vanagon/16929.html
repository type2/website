Subject: Re: Please don't mix used brake fluid and used oil

Hi All,

Out here in CA (Sillycone Valley), Jiffy Lube will no longer accept used motor 
oil from drop offs (i.e. people who are just recycling their own waste oil).  
Brake fluid and anitfreeze contamination has become such an issue that very few 
establishments accept waste oil from a hobbyist any more in our area.  
Fortunately, there are a few establishments left in the area, who will accept 
waste oil in bulk, but they make me feel like I'm some sort of criminal on 
parole every time I make a dump (10 gallons at a time....  we have 7 VW's)!  It 
is a sad commentary on just how an irresponsible minority of car owners have 
impacted the rest of us!  Nur mein zwei Pfennig...

       Jon

nah. i said that the Jiffy Lube folks told me to go ahead and dump it all
together in their big tank. what they do with it, i don't know. i thought
it was a little peculiar, too ... oil, brake fluid, coolant all in the same
muck.
