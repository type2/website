Subject:      Re: Coolant pipes 85 Vanagon GL

&gt; Has anyone had experience with optional replacement? rubber?  copper?
&gt; combination rubber/metal?

I used Gates 1.25 inch heater hose to replace the pipes on my '82 diesel.
They fine in front, but I had to use two short pieces of copper tubing to
match up to the engine hoses.

&gt; Has anyone heard of VW factory plastic replacements?

VW sells plastic replacements, but they are a different size, so you have
to buy a set of new rubber hoses to convert.

Good luck!
