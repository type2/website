Well, we have unsubscribed for a tad, and we leave sometime tommorrow
for St. Louis. Thanks to all the Michigan, Wisconsin and Minnesota
members for their touring suggestions. Unfortunately we are leaving a
week later than planned, and it is totally unclear what route the Syncro
Westie will  choose to get us over the Mississippi.

So if you see a Silver Syncro Westie with a tattered front bumper,
Maryland plates, loaded with bikes in the rear, sans a list sticker
'cause I was too slow, that is us! We will be waving/light flashing at
all VW Buses, regardless of age, cooling method, and engine location.

Hope to see you in Missouri!

Tom F.
