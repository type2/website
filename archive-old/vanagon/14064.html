Subject: Vanagon power vs. hills and loads

ok vanagon owners, i know the vanagon is not tops in performance but i am 
wondering, if i load one down, will its performance SERIOUSLY decrease or is 
it not really noticable?  im talking about 4 people total and luggage.  Does 
a westfalia package add alot of power robbing weight? Lastly, will i be able 
to climb a hill in a loaded vanagon, i have heard bad stories about 
insufficient power, im not interested in flying up a hill but i do want to 
climb it in a reasonable amount of time.
