 &gt; Anyway, I just spent $360 on the 84 vanagon for maintenance that I probably 
 &gt; couldn't have done myself.  But, just the same, I'm kinda interested in a 
 &gt; Bentley manual for the beast, but not to the tune of $85.

I **STRONGLY** recommend getting it no matter what it costs.  You *need* this 
information if you're going to do work on your van, or even if you just want 
to keep your mechanic honest.

Think of it as a tool.  Cheap tools are too expensive: they break, you replace 
them with other cheap tools, you have to go to the tool store when you should 
be wrenching, and so on.  Buy the best tools you can; they'll serve you well.  
After spending a couple of hours on the triple-square axle bolts on my Jetta 
and ruining 3 KD tools, I popped the $16 for a Snap-On version and zip-zoop!  
out they came.  Best $16 I spent on the Jetta.  I traded it off on having a 
shop do the clutch job: came out ahead.

The manual is like that.  It has everything you need to know.  Smaller manuals 
like Chilton and Haynes don't cut it, if you ask me.

Save up if you have to. and by all means shop for a lower price, (try Classic 
Motorbooks, or other auto-specific book mail-order places and let us know if 
it works) but GET THAT BOOK.

My opinion which is mine and belongs to me.
