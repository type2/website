Subject: Westphalia, MO, KS, IN


&gt;&gt; One stop I want to make is Westphalia, Missouri for a Kodak moment
&gt;&gt; similar to Rick Babor's in the 1996 NEATO calender
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;Speaking of Westphalia and Holidays.  Each time I make the drive home to 
&gt;see my parents in Newburgh, IN  I pass through Westphalia, IN.

There's also a Westphalia, Kansas.

(Note the spelling is different than our beloved Westfalia!)

Dave
