Subject: Re: poptops


&gt;The apparatus allows the top to extend straight up, rather than merely 
&gt;tip from one end.


&gt;now, do any of you happen to know where this company called Sportsmobile
&gt;actually is?

I don't know, but I think I have one of these on my 71 bus.  I mentioned 
that mine pops straight up and nobody had heard of it.  Anyone have any 
pic's or something like that?  I really want to get mine on the road to get 
to a get-together, maybe someone can ID this.
