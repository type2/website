I should try that -- except, she'd probably like the recently
refinished brewer's chair :-)

Like a lot of other things we did not have the time for, we skipped
the ghost ships also -- we decided to come back for a 1 or 2 week
stay...

BTW, we're also planning to make a trip to Martha's Vineyard one
weekend in september.  Are there any campgrounds on the island?

Good luck with your trip,
Cetin

 &gt; Cetin...the only known cure for your wife's &quot;transgression of 
 &gt; discretion&quot; is to strap her to a recently refinished brewer's
 &gt; chair which was purchased at a yard sale, tape her eyelids
 &gt; open (a la Clockwork Orange) and force her to watch an endless
 &gt; loop tape of &quot;Martha Stewart's Living&quot;....

 &gt; PS - Glad to hear your trip went well....did you get to see the
 &gt; ghost ships of Wiscassett?
