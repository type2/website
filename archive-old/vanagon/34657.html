Subject: tires syncro westie

Hello All,
        I'm now a BFG all terrain T/A fan. I thoroughly tested these tires
the past 2 weekends. First in heavy rain highway driving the tire noise was
minimal with no feelings of hydroplaning. Then this past weekend I took a
camping trip to the &quot; Dolly Sods &quot; wilderness area in the Monongehela
national forest in West-by-God-Virginia. Drove up in falling snow and then
drove on unplowed forest roads. The tires were great as was the syncro
traction. The temp that night went down to -15 F Brrrr!
