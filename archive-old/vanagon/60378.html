Subject: Eurovan can't get hitched

The time I actually used the hitch close to its capacity (big U-Haul
trailer) I was pleasantly surprised with how well it handled and how
well it climbed -- ~630 mile round-trip, empty one-way, packed to the
gills on the way back....

 &gt; That's strange.  When the Eurovan was introduced, VW was bragging about 
 &gt; its towing capacity!  I would check with another hitch dealer.
