As you'd expect, fuel econ. is lower with the auto. trans (while I
would have much preferred the standard, I took what I could get at the
time).  I would say the average mpg (US gallons) is about 19.  I've
gotten as low as 17.5 and as high as 21.  The range is about 350 miles
between fill-ups.  Power with the 5 cylinder is certainly fine for me.
