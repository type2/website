Tim laments:

&gt;worse. And to add to it, I tore upthe sender ring on the spark plug, thus I

and...

&gt;headtemp sender but they don't carry them. . The technician suggest soldering
&gt;the ring back together. Well it just so happened I had this brand new torch,

The sender will work fine, even if torn. Mine is. Just bent it back
