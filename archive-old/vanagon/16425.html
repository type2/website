Hey All..

Just swapped out the 'ol clutch cable ... the only hard part is that
it happens at both ends of the bus 8)

But this caused a pause of though...why do these things stretch?
I mean, they are made od steal, right? They don't stretch very
much for their whole life, and then BANG they grow an inch or two.

Why? Curious minds (or bored) want to know!
