Hello All,
	I've been talking to joel and would like to open up to any other
	experiences y'all may have. I've been modifying the electrical system 
	on my 78 bus (earlier posts may have said 79 mistakenly). I've replaced
	the stock 55amp alt. with a 70amp'er (minor mods); the difference is 
	phenominal!!! You can never have too much electrical reserve!
	I wish some aftermarket place had a monster big alt 100amps+ 8).
	Maybe I'll design a custom unit? No wait I've got it, I have an old 
	motor from a 67 ghia I can always set it up in sinc.running a couple 
	slave alternators :) I am wondering about ammeters; Anyone install 
	an ammeter in a bus before? Where did you find a suitable unit. 
	Also, Anybody hook up a 2nd battery. (I have a deepcycle
	die-hard marine just waiting to be added.) I'm curious about your 
	suggestions for isolation. I'm willing to try anything logical.
	Bore me to death with technical fufu, I'm an engineer 8&gt;)
	This will be the great experimental bus of the decade! I have the 
	summer, no job, and no life :)
