&gt;suggestion: since Hannover, germany is the ancestral 'home' of the majority
&gt;of our buses (early splits were made at Wolfsburg and later at Emden, then
&gt;all production was moved to Hannover for the transporters) ... what about
&gt;a city symbol/crest/flag of Hannover?? you know, like the Wolfsburg crest
&gt;on the Limited Editions and the old beetle hoods and horn buttons?

A trademark of Hannover is the &quot;Hannover'sches Genetiv&quot;. So what about
&quot;Dem Bus-geek sein Internet&quot;? 

&lt;I suppose only a few will get that one. OK, I'll log out and get some
WORK done!&gt;
