Subject: new look for my '71


Well, my bus is no longer brown, or even close to it, I had a few of my 
friends over today, and we painted the bus, the very front is random 
colors in a weird design, then on the drivers door is purple with yellow 
flowers, and on the middle pannel is an eye shape design, then the back 
panal goes into a sea and night sky scene.  The rear has a sunrise picture, and 
the the other side has a fish, and a brick wall, and all of our 
handprints... It is definately different, and creative, I can't wait for 
it to dry so I can parade it around town.  Dallas  ;) I will try to post 
pictures of it on my web page as soon as I get them developed.
