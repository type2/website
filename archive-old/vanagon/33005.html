Subject: Factory A/C w/2.0~performance?

I have the oppty to pick up a non-running '81 Vanagon which has the A/C unit
control panel installed on the headliner above the driver/passengers heads.
This is a 2.0 aircooled vehicle. Does anyone have any performance insight as
to this setup? I am getting the bus for next to nada! =). I have always
avoided A/C in the aircooled motors. It would be wonderful to have A/C in
the '83 2.0 Westy (Phoenix, AZ).  Is the danger of burning up the motor the
same as the earlier 1600 etc. ? To what degree should I expect the already
dreadfully sluggish performance to be affected?  This is the A/C that runs
off the pulleys not the top mounted unit.
