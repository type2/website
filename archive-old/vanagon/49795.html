Subject: Tri Star picture 

 I just recieved my November issue of Hot VWs in the mail and saw that in
the &quot;for sale&quot; ads in the back that there is a picture of the Tri Star that
I bought a few weeks back. Some people asked &quot; what is a Tri Star?&quot; , well a
picture is worth a thousand words. The transporter is not for sale. The
reason it is in the ad is that the magazine has such a long lead time (about
3 months) that the old owner sold it to me before it even came out in the
mag. After he sold it to me it was too close to print time so they couldn't
pull the ad.
