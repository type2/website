Matt D. mentions:

&gt;these are probably no better or worse than other vans on the market.
One =
&gt;thing he did mention that caught my attention was the gas tank
placement =
&gt;of the EV, that it was similar to the sidesaddle placement of the GM
=
&gt;pick ups. VW makes it a point to mention that they use plastic fuel =
&gt;tanks placed well inboard to minimize their exposure to rupture and =
&gt;explosion. Any EVers look under their vans to confirm the fuel tank's
=
&gt;material and placement?

Oh, oh, are those Ric's flying fingers I hear pounding out a scathing
rebuttal to the statement above by one Mr. Rand &quot;I'm a whiner&quot; Knox of
CARveat Emptor fame?...   &quot;She's coming in low!...Hit the deck!...&quot;

OK, well, I've looked and worked under my EV enough to confirm that
the
tank is some sort of plastic (I'd think you'd be hard pressed to find a

modern fuel tank that's made out of metal), and it does sit between a
ladder matrix to protect it from side impact, although I'm sure that's
not the sole reason that it's designed that way. Ever wonder why the
'93
EVs came w/ no airbag, yet did NOT have those putrid motorized mice?
(not to be confused w/ mice that make homes in your vent ducting)
Well, it's because VW got around the no airbag=passive restraint
require-
ment by classifying the EV as a truck.
