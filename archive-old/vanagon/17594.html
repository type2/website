Subject: Re: Refrigerator and alarm

I rigged my alarm so it sends out a 50 watt signal to my beeper on CB
frequency 27.195. It has never gone off, but it is nice to know I can walk
miles away from my camper into the woods and still be alerted if someone
breaks in.

The fridge uses no power but that noise you here is a little cooling fan
that will come on in hot weather. That little fan doesn't use enough power
for you to worry--it would take a week for it to drain much from your battery.

&gt;I'm looking for a simple and inexpensive alarm for my '87 Westy. I've
&gt;found an audiovox that is triggered by either shock or a voltage
&gt;fluctuation. It's only two wires to install. I'm wondering if the
&gt;refrigerator is going to be a problem though. I want to use the alarm
&gt;when we're off day hiking or shopping etc. and I normally leave the
&gt;refrigerator running on gas. Does anyone know if the refrigerator uses
&gt;any electric when it's running off the lp? I didn't think that it did
&gt;but when I listen closely it sounds like there might be a whirring
&gt;sound of some kind.
