Subject: Bug Blitz '97 - new site!

Volks Folks,

Mark your calenders!!  Saturday July 19th, Bug Blitz '97, New Location!!

This years Bug Blitz will be held at the Historic Independence Square in,
strangely enough, Independence Missouri.  This is a GREAT site and the store
owners are going all out for us.  The new site offers restrooms with running
water (yeah!), lots of antique stores for bored spouses, four restraunts (TWO
ice cream parlors),  an ATM for that unexpected swap meet purchase, LOTS of
parking, trees and covered walkways for shade, camping sites with in-ground
pool less than two miles away (Busses by the Square?), and much, much more.
 Hope to see there!!

As always, spectator admission will be FREE and all models of VWs will be
welcome.  National magazine coverage expected.

-Dan
