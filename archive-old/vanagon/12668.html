Subject: Bolt Torque Error In Manual

A notce from VW dated March 31, 1991 reads: 
=====================================================

Attaching Pressure Plate or Flywheel to Crankshaft

Attaching bolt, part No. N 902 061.01 is no longer available. 

The replacement bolt, Part No. N 902 061.03 will not endure the current
torque specification in the Repair Manual Microfiche. It will cause the
threads to strip. 

The correct torque applied is now 30 Nm (22Ft. lb) + 1/4 turn. 

=======================================================

I was horrified to think that my manual might cause me to strip a bolt here
so I looked in to it but did not find what page this bolt is shown on. Can
anybody determine whether we have to worry about correcting our printed
manuals (whether this applies to us) and on what page of the manual this
bolt is shown? 

I brought the matter of this revised torque spec up a couple of months ago
when Gerry was changing his clutch and posted something scarey to him but
was not able to locate this tech bulletin until now. (sorry Gerry). 

This tech bulletin is said to apply to &quot;All Models&quot; of Volkswagen but I
don't know whether the VW van employs this bolt.
