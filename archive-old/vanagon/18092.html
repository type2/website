Subject: Re: '71 Club Cab + friends

&gt;Just for the fun of it ask if he has a spicerack/L shaped whatnot cabinet
for a 65-71 westy camper. It has gotten to be my standing joke but I still
haven't found one that is complete enough for the '67 resto from he*l. At
the lowest common denominator level, I need the mounting hardware and two
pieces of the pinkish &quot;wood&quot; laminate on 1/4&quot; plywood measuring about 3&quot; x
16&quot;. I can't believe that I'm still looking for these pieces!!

&gt;        If anyone needs misc small part, ie. mailable size, I can ask him. 
&gt;He's been putting stuff away for years, didn't see any splitties though. tim s.
