Subject: List problems

The list problems that people were seeing were real.  There was a holdup 
of mail on a central mail server which got worse as listserv tried more 
and more to send the incredible traffic that went through on Wednesday 
and Thursday.  It's why some of the messages got to people late and at 
different times.  The list was down almost all of today as I tried to clear 
the mail queue and get the 642 messages sent to the people who didn't get 
them.  I've changed the path for the mail, but I'm not sure it's right, 
so let's tread lightly for a while until I can sort it out, k?
Lots of sympaty mail for me is ok, but try to direct replies at people 
instead of the list for a while.

By the way, the list is up to 235 addresses.

Thanks.
