Subject: ghosts in the starter

     For the last year or so, I've had the following problem with my '66 
     (converted to 12 v): whenever it's driven long distances (like Fla to 
     N.C.) the starter fails.  I have to crawl underneath with the mallet 
     and smack it a couple times and/or goose the solenoid with the 
     screwdriver.  I've done this in heavy traffic, in the rain, and on 
     lonely mountain backroads (gee, I wonder when they'll find me).  Now 
     that the motor is out again I'm determined to fix this.  
     
     I pulled the starter and took off the end cap.  An honest handful of 
     rust fell out and then even more when I banged the unit on the 
     workbench.  I disassembled further and sanded the armature, checked 
     the brushes, and sprayed the whole thing down with tuner cleaner.  Put 
     it back together and took it down to the local electrical shop where 
     they bench tested it and gave it their blessings.  
     
     Next, I crawled under and inspected the wiring.  The ass end of the 
     wire coming from the ignition switch has been replaced and the it 
     appears to be two sizes too small in gauge.  I'll run a new wire all 
     the way.  The ground cable to the battery is newish but the ends need 
     cleaning.  
     
     Am I missing anything else?
     
     Oh yeah, my apologies to the list for my error on mileage when I 
     posted re: GEX motor problems.  The clock is at 5k, not 5000k, as Joel 
     noticed and pointed out to me.  Oops!!  I do know a guy with 1000k on 
     his Mercedes sports and another with 1000k on a Moto Guzzi!!  Maybe 
     someday.
