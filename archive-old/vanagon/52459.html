&gt;With all that we know,  why would anyone place additional risk on
thier
&gt;children by placing them in the front seat?  Barely makes sense if
there are
&gt;no seats left in rear.

To which I reply:

I fully understand that the front seat is not the safest in the car,
and my personal preference is to have him in the back anyway, since
there's more likelihood of him causing an accident because he's a
distraction rather than a victim of an accident, however, my SO, due
to the dimensions of our garage and the parking arrangement, prefers
to load up the kids from one side of the car.

Don't think that we haven't discussed this subject before, 'matter
of fact, we discussed it again last night after I showed her the
paper,
and she half-heartedly asked &quot;so should we put 'em both in the back?&quot;
I can see her point of view (I'm faced w/ the same loading situation
too)
and I guess this is a conscious act on our part to subject one of the
kids to the danger of riding up front.  At least the seat is properly
secured, the child is properly secured, and we have no airbags.  
All I'm saying is that if anything did happen, we take ownership of
our decisions and actions, and their consequences.

I agree though, if it can be done, put children in the back.
