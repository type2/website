Subject: Re: '64 Deluxe Engine #?

Based on the info from my books here, the # 0301353 1500 was installed prior
to the 1964 model year (what's yer VIN?), and only as an option (M215, M216)
as the 63's were equipped with a standard 1200 40HP engine.

Here's what info I've got:

Jan 63  VIN (Parts Book does not say)  Eng# 0143543  1500 option introduced
Aug 63  VIN 1144282  Eng # 0578878  Beginning VIN for 1964 Model year

I would say that yer # 0590821 was made within the next month or so after
that. (The last 64 made in December of 1963 was VIN 1222500, but VW of course
gives no engine number in the books or the microfiche film).
