&gt;I am looking for the left wall folding table assemby from a

&gt;such as the molded left side trim panel, or any of the attachment hardware
&gt;unique to this particular table application.
&gt;
&gt;Don't have one, but know where one is? A finder's fee will be offered to any
&gt;lead which results in a purchase.

Be careful here.  The rear seat used in the 87,88,89 Wolfsburg editions, 89,
90, 91 Carat, and 90, 91 Multivan is narrower (about 4&quot;) than the standard
vanagon seat to make room for that driver's side table panel and the table
itself.  You can't just buy the table/panel and install it in you van, unless
you change the rear seat also.

Good luck,
