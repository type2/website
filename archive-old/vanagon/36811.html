Subject: vanagon emissions

 A couple days ago I took my new vanagon ('87 Syncro) for it's emissions
test.  I felt kinda sketchy, because (for the first time since I bought it
a few months ago) I had some greyish smoke comming outta the exhaust and it
didn't smell too good.
 Four minutes and twenty dollars later, I was told thatI failed, having too
high an HC level.  Being a relatively new car and in very good condition, I
was wondering if there was any minor adjustment I could do (or tricks...my
frined tells me he puts water in his truck's carb before the test, so that
&quot;steam&quot; comes out of the exhaust for awhile).  I don't have the time, or
especially the money, so any help would be greatly appreciated. BTW, I'm in
CT.
 Also, how difficult (time and tools) is it to replace a boot on the cv
joint?  Mine is cracked.
Thanks!
