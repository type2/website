Subject: Horn question

All,

Texans appearently feel that it is there god-given right to pull out in front
of anything smaller than a tractor-trailer, so I was wanting to know if
anyone has any ideas for a horn for my Thing, that would be sufficiently
loud to scare the he|| out of any one who felt the need to pull out when it
is too late.  I have had too many incidents where I have had to lock up all
four tires in an attempt to stop before hitting someone, fortunately not in
the Thing yet.  I am looking for something simple, and compact(ie not be
mounted on the hood or fenders) components could go in the trunk if necessary.

Thanks

David
