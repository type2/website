Subject: 90 westy 29k mi sold

Tried to have a second look at the 90 Westy with 28,500 miles, auto, air,
furnace awning, (asking $12,000)  at the used car lot here in Green Bay, Wis.
but it's gone.  He who hesitates.....The dripping transmission worried me but
this was still a deal.

Anyway my wife is happy.  She loves (so do I) our 87 westy gl, 95,000 miles
so all is not lost.  Tough to purchase a fourth car before selling the third.

Thanks to all with interest in mine but I'll be keeping it.

I did notice a few differences between the 90 westy and my 87.  Can someone
explain?  Mine has two tables the 90 only has one.  Also underneith the sink
I noticed an ac outlet with a plug it.  Is this std or was this installed
aftermarket to accomdate the aftermarket propane furnace.  Just wondering.  

Thanks,

Ajax
