Subject: Cannons in Buses: was Big Van Load

Not a Civil War Cannon but a cannon none-the-less. 

 My friends and I dug up a 20mm cannon from a wrecked fighter plane from
the 1950's in the hills above our home. About 6 ft long and 150 pounds.
Navy not really interested in the wreck since it's in a very remote area. 
Anyway..... Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms and the Navy do not look too
favorably on civilians possessing cannons and I need to stay on the up and
up for my work so we had to get rid of it.  A local aviation museum said
they would take it so off in my friends 88 Vanagon it went.  Too big for a
car trunk.  I remember that there were many remarks make about stupid
drivers as we drove to the museum.  Oh for a cannon to come as standard
equipment.  Even a fake one to just intimidate the idiots on the road.

&gt;Hello - since I'd last been on this list I noticed a thread re: big
&gt;hauls in vans. The week after my HS graduation in June 86 I drove a 66
&gt;bus from South Central PA (Chambersburg) to Dallas TX to just outside
&gt;Missoula MT to deliver a vintage Civil War cannon to its new owner.
&gt;THe cannon barrel, wheels, and carraige components weighed in at about
&gt;1800 lbs. + me (about 110lbs) + gear (about 60-70 lbs) --- REALLY

ok, folks. that's it. that tops the whole thread!!!! :)
