To Whom It may Concern;
Has anyone attempted to replace hoses to the heaters with PVC? I was
thinking it would be cheaper ,  and easier to insulate with foam pipe
insulation. This should increase the heater output and make it harder to
freeze up. The heavy duty gray type should handle the heat.
Just &quot;ah-thunking&quot;
Good Luck

&gt;Hi All,
&gt;
&gt;After an attempt to bleed the cooling system on my 84 GL Brownie Bus
&gt;last night in 20 degree weather, I burst a heater hose.  Upon 
&gt;inspection
&gt;of the other heating hoses I discovered that they are in pretty sorry
&gt;shape.  I need to make a run to FLAPS for replacement hoses; however,
&gt;before I do I would like to hear from anyone out there who knows how 
&gt;much
&gt;hose I will need.  The  T-fittings for the rear htr core are real
&gt;nasty looking.  I hope FLAPS can help out on those.  Is there a 
&gt;special
&gt;type or size of htr hose I should get?  I imagine it's not an exact
&gt;science.  TIA,
&gt;
