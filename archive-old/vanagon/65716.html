Subject:      Inside refigerator fans

Hmmmm, inside refrigerator fans might work well on the 97 Eurobago equipped
with the high altitude kit because:  I hear a fan at work in the burner
whenever the thermostat calls for the propane burner to be on.  If that is
truly a fan that I am hearing, then the inside fan could be wired to the
fan at the burner.
