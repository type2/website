&gt; I'm TRYING to understand this intrigue with awnings.  Why, for
&gt; example, should I want one?  Is it shade?  Can't I just park under
&gt; a tree or go inside the van for shade?  

We have an awning and decided it was useful after experience with our 
'73. 
We count on it for (1) shade - many places just didn't have trees or 
shade. and (2) expanding the living area with it is raining &lt;we get sort 
of claustophobic when we have to leave the door shut with us stuck 
inside&gt; and finally, as a frame to attach a wind break.
