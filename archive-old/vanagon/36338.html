&gt;Heres my question.  Whats the best way to hook my spare battery into the 
&gt;charging system?  Via isolator or just do like the marine applications 
&gt;do and install a A/B/C switch so only one battery is getting charged at 
&gt;a time? 
&gt;
&gt;

I use a relay to connect the battery for charging.  Automatic operation,(use
accesory circuit for activation) and no forward voltage drop that diode
isolators have. Isolators lose about 1.1 volt barely leaving 12.7 to charge
batteries.  As they heat up, drop is worse.  All the better RV's are factory
equiped with relays.
