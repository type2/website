&gt;&quot;I presume that Fish Chowder consists of Fish, Potatoes, Peas,
&gt;Carrots and little white Onions, with milk or cream and black pepper.
&gt;Gee, Sole or Cod or that kind of fish would be a good start, yes?&quot;
&gt;Sounds good to me, and I think it would be good with seafood in
&gt;there, too, like scallops, shrimp, crab, etc., kinda like a clam
&gt;chowder.  I'm hunting recipes and will report soon.  In the meantime,
&gt;I've sort of got categories for contributions I'll post here
&gt;separately soon....

huh. sounds just like possum stew ... cept for that mild/cream stuff.
and the sole is better if it's from a leather shoe ... them tennis shoes
just don't cook right.
