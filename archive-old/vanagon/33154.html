&gt; I can swap any of the stickers SSVC (Split Screen Van Club) make for anything
&gt; far out featuring Splitties (I'm too old to say cool, that's my kids
&gt; language)..anyone access Endangered Species?

I don't really like stickers on my vehicles.  My '77 had stickers from all
over the place... I scrapped them off after I started driving it.  I had to
scrape the &quot;I [heart] Jesus&quot; sticker off before I even drove home the fist
time. :) But this sticker I found was just to cool to pass up.  How about
scanning the stickers?  That way I can see if there's one I REALLY have to 
have.
