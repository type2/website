Subject: crutchfield/stereo


I just received a catalog form Crutchfield (stereo stuff), and noticed
at least 2 items in there that may be of interest to bus/vanagon folks:
(both items appear to be new on the market)

1.  Pioneer Subwoofer TSW-X30 (fits behind the seat in places
like a small pickup truck).  It's a slim box containing a single 5.25&quot;
speaker, tandem duct bass reflex design.  approx 14w x 10h x 6d (inches),
Item # 130TSWX30, $129.95.

2.  Pioneer subwoofer TSW-X50 (fits inside your spare tire rim).  Fits
inside wheels that are 13&quot; or wider.  You need an amp of 40 or 50 watts
RMS to produce strong bass.  13.75&quot; diameter x 4.75&quot; depth,
Item # 130TSWX50, $129.95.

If anyone already has these, or gets them, I know I and probably others
on the list would be interested in your comments.....
