&gt; &gt;&gt;I need to remove the #3 main bearing from the Bus crankshaft.  However,
&gt; &gt;&gt;I am without a press of any sort.  Anybody know a trick, using common
&gt; &gt;&gt;household appliances or rocks, on how to remove this bearing?

&gt; Is this #3 main bearing special that it takes a press to remove? When I worked
&gt; on bug and BMW engines all main bearing halves can be removed by a light tap
&gt; by a piece of wood block. Of course you could use a sledge hammer to do it (
&gt; just kidding). Maybe I am wrong, I don't see what the difficulty is.

Actually, this bearing is trapped on the crankshaft (it's not a split 
bearing) by the distributer drive gear, which *is* pressed on.
