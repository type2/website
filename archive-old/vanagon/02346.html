&gt;I'm just catching up to reading all of these messages after about a week
&gt;of being busy doing work (yes, actual work!).  I'm kinda wondering if
&gt;a wannabusser such as myself would be welcome on this trip.  I'd promise
&gt;to drive my 80 Scirocco so as not to pollute the blood with a non-VW.

welllll ... ok by me, but you have to 'act' like a bus: no passing, slow
waaaaay down on hills. :)

or maybe we could get you to ride 'Point' for the column. :)

&gt;Please, please, please Unca Joe!!!! (and others)

god, i hate it when they grovel! ;)
