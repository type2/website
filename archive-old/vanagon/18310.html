Hold on... I didn't think wasserboxers had a cold start valve. Am I

basically just another fuel injector in the middle of your intake manifold, 
provides extra fuel when the motor is cold.

That could explain why your motor idles better cold. Hey wait a minute, maybe 
its not shutting off and the motor's running too rich when warmed up?
