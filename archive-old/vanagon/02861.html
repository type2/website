Subject: cost of heat exchangers
Date: Thu, 11 Aug 1994 12:32:09 -0500 (CDT)

Just a few days ago someone wanted to know if there is a difference among
the various heat exchangers which sell at different prices. He or she
asked if a $200 heat exc. from supplier X is really better than a $50 one
from supplier Y. I inadvertently deleted that message and don't even
remember on what list it was. 

My question is: *where* can you find heat exchangers for 50 bucks??
At Rocky Mountain Motorworks they are $200 for the bus. If you need two,
that's $400. I don't even want to know how much VW charges.

If the cheap ones are really worse --I guess that means that they will
rust faster?--, then one could consider treating them with heat resistant
paint or hot-jetting them (whatever that means).

And BTW, why are those suckers so outrageously expensive in the first
place? It's just a bunch of pipes and sheet metal, isn't it? Not some high
precision performance part?
