Subject: 1.9L rebuild, cam bearing question

For:Anyone who has rebuilt a 1.9L wasserboxer recently.
Subject: Detail about replacement cam bearings.
 Specifically the bearing closest to the gear. The original set had one
half plain bearing (with tab) and the other half had the built in thrust
washers. The new (standard) bearing has TWO thrust washer/bearing halves.
What strikes me as peculiar is neither half has a tab to prevent bearing
rotation(if indeed that is what they are for). 
Thanks
