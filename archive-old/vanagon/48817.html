Hi-

After a year of lurking here, and 15 years of being a wannabus, I finally 
bought my bus.  It's a '88 Westy with 53K.  Been driven about 2k/year for the 
last 4 years, and was parked on a city street, so last night was wash and wash 
and wax.  Tonight I'll start trying to get the camping stuff working.  

Did someone recently post of a miracle substance to put on the pop-top that 
gets rid of/reduces that UV damage?

Anyway, thanks for all the help from the list, and please be patient with my 
silly questions.

Thanks...
