&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; I have an 86 Syncro GL with a problem with the fuel guage, which my mechanic
&gt; says is a bad sender.  Has anyone had experience replacing the fuel guage sender
&gt; in a syncro Vanagon?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,

     NO but I was able to repair mine. The electrical connector was
     very coroded and making no connection. I simply cleaned it 
     well enough to solder new wires to what was left.
