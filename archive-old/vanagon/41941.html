Subject: Re: Why gas taxes should be higher...

Ron and V_at_L,
	Thank You for sending this URL to the V_at_L list, it seems to be
relevant to a list that is interested in gas powered autos of any type.  I
agree with the other list members that politics should not take up a lot of
the space on this list but I think comments, reviews and information about
auto related books, articles, and websites do belong on this list. Please
keep the websites and reviews coming.  Thank you for your conciseness.

	johnny Stutsman
