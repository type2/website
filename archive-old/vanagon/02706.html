Subject:      now, how do I get the window out?



Well here I am starting on this 69 camper, got some good advice on changing
the locks, and now I have to deal with the passenger window that has dropped.
No sweet, I have done a little of that before, besides, I have my trusty
Bentley manual and Haynes to supplement. Well, you have to take the whole
winder mechanism out before the window comes out, or so the manuals say. The
weld holding the window lift to the lifter was broken, but no problemo, I had
the 71 to get another of. What those manuals don not mention is that place
just up and to the right of the crank that goes clear across making it
impossible to get the mechanism out. After much banging (ouch!! I hate
indiscriminate banging) I got the sucker out. Now the Window, right? No way.
To get any angle on that sucker it looks like you got to rip out the window
scraper et. al. On manual does mention you have to disconnect the internal
guide on the right. Bottom bolt is no problem, but who can find that upper
bolt. So my question is, &quot;HOW DO I GET THIS WINDOW OUT??? I still have to do
the same on the 71 bus, and then put the sucker back into the 69? Well
somebody has had to go through this before. Is there a trick to removing the
winder gismo and the glass? Please, what is it?

it comes to VWs and windows, go to the expert--its cheaper)
