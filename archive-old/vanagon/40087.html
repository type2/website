Don't forget all those salvage yards.

Some of those super trip computer gadgets from the high-tech all-digital
dash boards are getting into the yards now. Electronics prolly outlasted
most other parts of the car. Getting the sensors might be more work.

My dad has the Olds 88? (Park Avenue clone) land YAAACHT (excuse me) and
always goes out of his way to twiddle with his trip computer when I'm
driving with him. He's not subtle, either. Oh and he wears a hat!

Regards,

Jim
