&gt;My message says......
&gt;We were taught to avoid brake fade by downshifting and braking until
&gt;you're slow enough to let your brakes cool; let it roll til your too
&gt;fast and brake again. I do this and never had brake fade. Ya let it
&gt;roll on it own so the brakes can cool off.

This works well for manual transmission buy I find that our 89 Westy auto
trans does not develop enough compression. We always have to be careful in
windy, downhill, backroad situations. In other words, be aware and don't
let the speed build up too much to begin with.
