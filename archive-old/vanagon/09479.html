Larry,

you may very well be right. I just thought, since others had called
mineral oil dino oil, and since we know that nowadays dinosaurs can only
be found in Jurassic Park, that the term &quot;jurassic oil&quot; would convey to
the reader a sense of what CHAOS and havoc that untamed oil could create
inside their engines. Again, I personally favor the new age, precision
engineered, synthetic oil to that cheap and passe' stuff.
