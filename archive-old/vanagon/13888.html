Subject: Re: Sticker vote update

&gt;For those of you who haven't voted, don't let this opportunity to
&gt;participate in Vanagon democracy (or is that anarchy...?) pass you by -
&gt;VOTE! (mail to wall_at_mcm_dot_com).

Can we change our vote?  I'd change mine to Matt Sanner's most excellent
design.

Ron
