A clarification is in order here.  I learned this the embarrassing way. 
The Bentley manuals ARE the official VW manuals.  Bentley is just the
publisher.  I saw the &quot;official&quot; VW manuals in Whitney, but it's not clear
whether they are the Bentley manuals.  This is not to judge them -- as a
matter of fact, since you have one, Caroline (or George?), could you say
whether it's better or worse than the Bentley manuals? (or haven't you
seen Bentley's?) You can't really have too many, I don't think. Sort of
like Money and RAM. :-)
