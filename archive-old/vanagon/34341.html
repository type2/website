&gt; &gt;Harrah's Auto Collection in Reno had a one-only built car named the Julian,

&gt; Interesting.  Think of the torque-effects...
&gt; The Tucker had a transplanted helicopter engine (according to the movie
&gt; version of the story), but I don't know what the config of the powerplant
&gt; was.

I believe the Tucker had an air-cooled flat six, rear mounted.  Also I
saw one of those cars with the stationary crank and rotating engine at
the Smithsonian last time I was there.  It was a really early car, tho,
I think it was a three-cylinder.  The forebear of the Geo Metro?
