Subject: Re: Do dealers know how to work on EVs


&gt; &gt; Does the average vw dealer know how to work on a EV 
&gt; camper? 

Ah, but the question these days is do they work on splitties.  I was
at the local dealers not so long ago [they won't give I the microfilm
so I have to keep going back], when one of the young mechanics who
just came in from setting up a new GTI looked over my shoulder and
asked &quot;Do they drive shafts really go into the trans. like
that?  Never seen that before!&quot;

The manager assured I that he still does all the air-cooled work
himself.

Bugs &amp; Things &amp; Bricks...Oh, my!

Roy
