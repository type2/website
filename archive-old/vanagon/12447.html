Subject: Stickers, plaid and prunes


Geez, it's absolutely frightening to see what comes back from the
crazies on this list! Superb ideas, everywhere!

Just wanted to say that I'll take this task seriously and try to
organize this chaos. I'm in digest mode, so it takes me awhile to get
all of the responses, plus I'm heading up to ski at Tahoe this weekend,
so I won't be able to organize this until early next week when I
return.

Just wanted the list to know that I will fulfill my responsibilities!

Someone must have spiked my prune juice this morning - I can't be
thinking very clearly if I'm _volunteering_ to make sense of this
stream of consciousness! Or maybe my plaid jockey shorts are a bit too
snug and my brain is deplete of oxygen (hmmmm, does my brain have an O2
sensor like my Westy?...something to ponder....)

Enough! Got to hit the slopes!
