These funny, mushroom shaped articles are coathooks.  One of the very few
items essentially unchanged since the &quot;splittie&quot; days, this item has had
at least 4 different VW part numbers and is currently available under a
&quot;Vanagon&quot; part number.

The driver's side coathook on the Westy models is virtually useless
because the front of the rear interior light overhead structure (for lack
of a better term)(makes a neat place to stash small stuff) is mounted so
close to it.

&gt;what purpose are the white knobs just above and behind the driver and
&gt;passenger seats for in my 84 westy? They are not needed to hang the
&gt;curtains and seem to have little to do with the fuel infection system.
