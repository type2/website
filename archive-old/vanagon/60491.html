Subject: Noise, smoke, engine death, Quantum TD transplant soon


        Friday after work, I packed my van and began to head south to Chico,
CA in my diesel vanagon.  My plan involved a stop in Redding, CA (about the
half way point) for a bite to eat. When I got off I5 I noticed that the van
was having trouble ideling (it was running fine at Lakehead, a town just
about 30 miles to the north.  When I stoped I noticed a lot of oil smoke and
a bad noise so I drove across the streat to a large parking lot to have a look.

        When I started turning the crank to check the timing (I suspected
that the pump timing had jumped a tooth) I got to a point that the crank
would not turn.  The cam had jumped.

        I straightened it out so that the valve was no longer hiting and
turned around and headed back (very slow and more smoke than you would belive).

        It is now siting at my fathers and he feels that this is the time to
give up on this engine and put a TD into it.

        So, here is the question, what do I need to do in order to put a
Quantum TD into a Vanagon diesel?  I have the Quantum and I have the van and
nither on of then is going anywhere soon.
