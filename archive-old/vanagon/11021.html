Subject: 73 Westy into California...how hard?

Thanks for the info everyone

The vehicle in question is a 73 Westy with a  currently non functionning
air pump and blocked off EGR.

I am wondering if this is old enough that it predates differences between
California legislation and 49 state/Canadian legislation.
