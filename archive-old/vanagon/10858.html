Subject: Re: stripped cap-screws on the CVs...

&gt;I had to saw the head off one particulary stubborn bolt. Once the CV joint 
&gt;was off, the rest of the bolt was easy to unscrew by hand.

I say ... drill them.  The socket head assures you're in the center of the 
bolt head, and if you drill untill the cap falls off, your'e done.
