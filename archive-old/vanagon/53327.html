Subject: Re: What cruise control system should I buy/

Fred Porter asked...

&gt; What aftermarket cruise control systems have you 
&gt; installed in your vanagons?

I've got an aftermarket VDO unit in my '86 Westy.  No complaints so 
far: it's responsive &amp; easy to use.  The amplifier is hidden away 
behind the glove box and the control box (2''x1.5''x1'') sits right 
next to the instrument pod.

The only problem to date has been the foot switch on the clutch
pedal wearing out (it's in a rubber blister screwed directly to the 
pedal rubber) - I replaced it with a microswitch glued directly to 
the pedal lever.

The model is VDO Tempostat, serial number KBA-ABE 95.004.  No idea 
about price, sorry.

Regards,

Rich Lumb
