Subject: Vanagon Mechanic in Chicago?

Looking for any recommendations for both a mechanic and body shop of a
non-dealer variety in Chicago.  I have been using West Suburban Imports in
Maywood and I have been happy with them as far as dealers are concerned.
 They are not particularly cheap and being in Lincoln Park myself, they are
not easy to get to.
