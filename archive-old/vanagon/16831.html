&gt;returned yesterday evening.  The van started bucking a little about 70
&gt;miles out, and I told my wife not to worry.  After a while it stopped.  I
&gt;never did figure that one out and it never did it again.  When I got to

musta been pre-trip anxiety. buses do that sometimes. ;)

&gt;[GNATT context] On the return trip, we attempted to take the river route back
&gt;from Dubuqe up -- hoping to stop into the Linear bike shop.  We found
&gt;something fun -- a ferry! :-) Unfortunately, it was closed for the season :-(
&gt;Fortunately for GNATT, it's opening tomorrow and will be open for the summer.
&gt;:-) It's just an idea, but I thought it would be fun to get all the buses
&gt;that end up there to take the ferry across the Mississippi.  It's not a very
&gt;big boat, but it looked like it would take 6-9 vehicles.  I talked to the
&gt;pilot, and he said it was about a 15 minute ride and cost $6 per vehicle.

i think that might be the one that the Buses by the Arch goes up and rides
across. anybody know for sure?
