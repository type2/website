Subject: Potty Mouths!  Divergents!  

&gt; &gt; I allow others in this office access to read this list.
&gt; &gt; My wife has access to my mail also.
&gt; 
&gt; That's all fine and dandy.

Indeed it is good to allow people to receive information.

&gt; &gt; While I'm showing others the spirit, creativity, cooperation and wit of the members,
&gt; &gt; I'd rather not have to be surprised and apologetic for something coming across that 

Well, me, too, but let's be realistic.  I sometimes run into a group of 
people whose conversation I enjoy and I want to share this group with 
others of my acquaintance.  Of course, as soon as I introduce them to the 
new group, one of the group members says something tasteless and I look 
like an idiot.  I'm so embarassed I just want to flame the people in the 
new group.

If I could only find an absolutely singleminded, pure group of people...

&gt; That's the price that is paid for openness. One must be willing to accept
&gt; that occasionally someone unexpected or unwanted might be available.

I _suppose_ so, but it's so dreary.  And tiresome!  I have this same
problem at the library -- they have all these books there with tasteless,
irrelevant stuff.  I wish they'd just stock the shelves with stuff I
approve of.  And those newspapers -- all that gore and personal ads! 
Not to mention the disgusting people at the mall. 

If I could only figure out how to shut them up.  I mean, I _have_ to go 
to the library, read the newspaper, and visit the mall, and I _have_ to 
listen to or read everything within range of my senses -- not to mention 
protect the delicate ears of my loved ones.

The worst offender is this mailing list I've heard about that is actually 
a _support group_ for people who drive aging, polluting vehicles MADE BY 
KRAUTS!  They're taking food from the mouths of American workers AND 
poisoning the planet.  Not to mention their vehicles are ugly.
