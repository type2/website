Subject: Hello again &amp; Some questions



	Hello everybody,

	I unsubscribed for some time and sick of it so here I am,(between all the work).

	I Have the 3rd hole of my dash ('73 SingleCab) filled with the clock which
	I'd like to replace by a tachometer, I would like to know if a T3 Tach would
	fit just like that, and if they exist with the grey finish.

	On the headliner-rods there are these plastic plugs which the dealer can't
	supply anymore, I need one so I can install the new headliner, I want the
	Original or a good repro, Anyone knows who sells them ? Or maybe someone has
	one.

	Another item I can't locate is the rubber of the HandbrakeHandle 211 711 425,
	suggestions on this one ?

	I have a hole bunch of the plastic heaterhoses that connect the heatexchangers
	to the VW's heatingchannels but I can't recall which set came of my '73 1600
	can someone tell the partnumber on theirs? Or maybe I could figure it out by
	the length &amp; diameter.

	Who sells new vent windows or at least the frame piece that holds the 
	moveable part?

	And : is there a lenght difference between the steering shafts of the 3-piece
	steeringcolumn busses and the 1-piece ones ?

	I would GREATLY appriciate any input one the above,

	Thanks &amp; Have a nice day :)  Brian Verbeek  '73 SingleCab
