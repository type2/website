Subject: Re: used parts

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Does anyone have a good index for fair prices on used parts?
&gt;&gt;We are getting several used items and want to know if these are
&gt;&gt;reasonable prices:
&gt;&gt;speedo/odo - 50
&gt;&gt;fuel guage - 20
&gt;&gt;sliding door lock mechanism - 50
&gt;&gt;driver's side window regulator - 40
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Does anyone have any idea if these are good prices or not?
&gt;&gt;

There are junkyards in South San Jose that let you dismantle and pick whatever
you need from hundreds of retired/injured cars including VW busses (not vanagons).
They charge significantly lower. I picked up an alternator for my Volvo for
$18 including a voltage regulator mounted on it. It was pure breed volvo
alternator. I saw 4 or 5 busses and at least 1 camper with the pop top
raised up. I saw a pair of air cooled cylinder heads lying on dirt and no one
seemed interested. They are probably for 1600 bugs. I think there are at least
30 may be 50 bugs sitting there waiting for parts seekers. There are still a lot 
of useful parts on them. Many good body parts (no rust mostly).  If you happen 
to be in San Jose go check them out.
