Once, someone asked me to jump their car.  I very carefully connected
from the red battery lead of one car to the red battery lead of the
other, and black to black.  A few short seconds later, my wife asked,
&quot;Why are the jumper cables smoking?&quot;  I immediately grabbed one of the
clamps and yanked it off the battery terminal.

Somehow no-one was hurt, and upon re-connecting the cables + to + and
- to -, both cars still started.  I did get a little weak in the knees
though, upon reflecting on the fact that there were probably 500 amps
of current going through those wires, and I was clipping them on and
off with my bare hands.

Whoever heard of installing a red wire on a ground connection?!
