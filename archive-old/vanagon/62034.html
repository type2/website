Subject: Fwd: more mpg and emmison lowers with magnetic fuel saver!!!!

sorry all that just got sent for no reason damn aol.....ok anyways its safe
fro carbureded and fuel injected vehicals.....It goes on your inline fuel
line and breaks up the clusters in todays gas.....like the mr3 and
stuff.....ok heres what is written bye the epa accepted lavoratory
results....
             
            before        after          change
HC           .430         .328         -24%
CO         3.354       1.100         -68%
NOx       3.172       2.711         -15%
CO2     330.628      299.322      -10%
MPG       26.447      29.526       +11.6%


these things only cost 19.95 and are very earth friendly and they do indeed
WORK.....I save lots in gas every week....On my syncro I went from 16 city 20
highway to 19 city 24 highway..it was great and when you have a heavy load it
gets even better milage cuz of the way it works....its a very small piece
only two magnets but they work...I personally havent gone through emmisions
yet but will in Aug. and expect it to help me lots......I would suggest it to
anyone for any vehical....oh and its on page 198 in the new jc witney
mag....under fuel systems..
lots of luck to you all..
