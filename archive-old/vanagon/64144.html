Well if this is the ball and socket type mirror, are you sure the socket is
not cracking?  You tighten it cracks, you tighten ...

I just bought some from the Bus Depot $19.95 + S&amp;H.

&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone have any ideas on how to keep the driver-side rear-view
mirror
&gt; from closing up against the van body at freeway speeds?  The mirror is on
an
&gt; '84 Vanagon Wolfsburg.  I have tried to fix it 3 times with no success. 
So
&gt; far I've replaced the mirror, taken it apart and tightened the inside
bolts,
&gt; and taken it apart again and used a metal file to try and &quot;rough up&quot; the
&gt; metal on the interior pivot ball.  Now I'm driving down the freeway
holding
&gt; the mirror in place (talk about windy!!).  Any help will be greatly
&gt; appreciated!
&gt; 
&gt; TIA
&gt; Donna
