Not nessisarily Eric,
Looks like all you need to do is adjust the plate at the bottom of your 
shift lever.  Most of the manuals will explain it, Basically all you have 
to do is loosen the two bolts that hold it JUST enough to be able to 
slide it. Seeing what you wrote all you should have to do is slide it 
just slightly to the right (or could that have been left). A happy medium 
is what you are looking for and heeping the reverse lockout working.
Hope this fixes it
