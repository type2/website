&gt;I'd like to put a 2nd battery into my 85 Westy and have learned

&gt;Can anyone give me the name/model for a deep-cycle battery that fits?

The only battery that I've found to fit is a 'wheelchair' battery.  These
batteries are both deep-cycle and gel-cell, so they are very safe.
Unfortunately, they seem to max out at 32 Amp Hours.

Optima is now making a deep-cycle battery.  In an OPTIMA battery, the lead
plates and separator are wound and tightly compressed into a cell tube so
they can't move, shed, or break, even in severe shock and vibration
applications. In independent SAE tests, the OPTIMA kept working after being
subjected to vibrations up to 5G for 12 hours. There is no &quot;free acid&quot; that
can leak out or spill and the OPTIMA can be operated effectively in any
position -- even upside down -- without any risk of leaking and because it
is sealed, no corrosion can form on the posts, connectors, or cables. There
is virtually no hydrogen off-gas. 

Their deep-cycle battery is 56 amp hours, has marine terminals, and is
9.94&quot;l x 6.75&quot;w x 7.81&quot;h.  It *may* fit, but I haven't tried yet.  It's
also $180.00.
