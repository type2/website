I have no Busses in *my* yard.  Just one in the driveway, one at my Dad's 
house here in Springfield, two at Dad's house in St.Thomas (MO), one in a 
friend's backyard, one in the field where I bought it a year ago, and I 
just bought a '72 for $100.  Where am I going to put that one?  I need to 
stop doing this.

&gt; &gt; What?  Busses just sitting in the back yard is *not* a normal VW situation?
&gt; 
&gt; Not here... my roomate already has 3 in the back yard, 1 in the garage, 
&gt; and 2 in the driveway (only one is drivable).  So I have mine parked on 
&gt; the street in front and next to the house, and one in LA, and one at 
&gt; work.   :)
