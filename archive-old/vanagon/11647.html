&gt; Now, a couple comments.  I have a piece of cardboard in front of the

&gt; there) but -and this is key- I also cover the fresh air intake grill. 
&gt;  I've found that with it uncovered, too much air comes in at highway 
&gt; speed and even with the fan on '1' it blows cool.  This can be 
&gt; counteracted by moving the DEFROSTER (top) and FOOT (third) levers 
&gt; only partially open but then the wind noise gets real high so I just 
&gt; use cardboard in front of the intake.

Now I'm not one to praise the vanagon cooling system, but...
I think you must have air pockets in your system because,
at highway speeds, with the temp needle verticle (where it should be) 
and the windshield and feet ducts wide open, you could get minor burns
if you left your hand over the opening.
That is, of course, during the one week of every month that the 
bloody H2O system is functioning within acceptable parameters.
