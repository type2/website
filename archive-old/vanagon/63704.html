     Whoa there, pardner!

     Let's not forget why they were called &quot;Type IV&quot; engines.  First 
     introduced on the 411 in the late sixties, then used on the (U.S. at 
     least) breadbox Type II starting in 1972; finally carried through to 
     the first Vanagons in 1980.

     Before you get too ill, remember that for many years, Porsches shared 
     a lot of similarities with VW; sort of a VW on steroids.  And 
     internationally, it's all the same company.  Since VAG decided to call 
     the 914 a Porsche (albeit it was badged VW-Porsche in Europe), I guess 
     it is.  'Course it really was a VW motor, but since the design is Dr. 
     Ferdinand's, then by geneaology, all VW air cooled engines are 
     Porsches by virtue of being Porsche's design.
     
     Ever drive a 914?  I liked it better than the 912.  Better handling; 
     peppy.  And it was less expensive to maintain.  What a sports car used 
     to be!
