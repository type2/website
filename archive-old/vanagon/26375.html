Subject: oil stariner drip fixed

well, my bus (uky, a 1973 camper with pop top) was dripping tons of
oil (about a quart in 12 hours) from around the oil strainer plate
after last nights oil change in the dark, whereas before there was
only a slight drip comming from there before.  afraid of the worse, i
feared i over tightened the bolt. HOWEVER today i went and bought a
torque wrench on my lunch break and after work and decided i would try
again, hoping i just messed up the gaskets.  so after work i 
1) opened her up and let the oil drain while i went for a run, 
2) came back and spitshined the plate and the oil strainer, 
   gently bending the latter back to an almost perfect plane, and
   scraped off anything i thought could be a piece of an old gasket or 
   sealant, 
3) then completely wiped down and out the sump(?) and smoothed it out
   also, knocking off any debris that could possibley be there.  
4) gently put it all back together, and tightened to
   9 foot pounds, and filled her up with oil.

NO LEAK!!  even better than before.

i am pretty excited about this and figured i'd let you all know.  i
realize its only an oil change but a few months ago i could change a
tire and start a car, and that's about it.  now i am gearing up to
replace the clutch.  

oh well, time to finish up work and go home.  take care everyone,
