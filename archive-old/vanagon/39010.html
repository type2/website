Subject:  &quot;Bile&quot; Rack for a Eurovan -Reply

i too would like to know which is the best bike rack, i don't have a
EV though, i have a vanagon.
the defacto standard for the vanagon that i've seen is the one that clamps
the the front bumper and wobbles all over the place unless you bungee the
whole rig to the van after the bikes are in place (my van came with one,
but i threw it away)
i would like a rear one...

i remember someone saying that the thule one is best, but i can't remember
specifics...
