Subject: Re: Classified Listings on the Net

     &gt;Most car salesmen (the good ones) keep lists of people looking 
     &gt;certain types of hard to find cars.  Occasionally some poor misguided 
     &gt;sole will actually trade their westy in for something else.  That's 
     &gt;how my wife found ours and it was a good one.
     
     I talked to some guy recently at a show and he'd found a one-owner '68 
     Devon camper, never welded, low miles, full service history, original 
     receipt and German air in the tyres - you get the idea, he payed 1800 
     for it and sold it at the show the next week for 3500.
     
     He found it on a used car lot, and snatched it up right away.
