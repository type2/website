Subject: Lucas thread,  licence plates /f

First, I want to profusely thank Lucas, because their electrical
systems on my former British cars drove me into the arms
of VWs, and I have never looked back!

Second, I was thinking that a nice vanity plate for a
water cooled vanagon might be &quot;H2O LKR&quot;, or perhaps &quot;LKY HDS&quot;.

Later, 

Tom F.
