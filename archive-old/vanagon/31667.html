Sorry, but I disagree with your theory.

I've always done this on my van, my rabbit and my motorcycle with no 
deliterious effects.  I usually take a run through town and then pull 
into the driveway and immediately pull the plug and let the oil drain for 
15 minutes or so.  This gives me time to get the fresh oil and tools 
ready and in place, etc.  As I said, I've never stripped an oil pan
doing this.

The only time that I had the displeasure to experience the wonders of 
heli coil inserts was when I purchased my motorcycle.  Not knowing how 
long the oil had been in it, I decided to change the oil first thing.  
Pulled the plug, drained the oil and went to put the plug back in.  Found 
that the PO had stripped the oil pan.  Took the pan to my FMS, had a heli 
coil put in and have never had a problem since.

The other reason to drain hot oil as opposed to cold is to make sure that 
any iron filings that have fallen out of suspension get back into the 
mix.  Otherwise they'll just mix in with the fresh oil when they're 
lifted from the bottom of the case and it will almost be as if you never 
changed the oil at all.
