&gt;Does anyone know of a way to get at the antenna of an '88 GL

&gt;it.  Any shortcuts?

There must be a way.  I replaced my antenna ('84 GL) a few
years after I bought it.  I know I didn't have to do more
that snake my hands up under the dash without taking out
anything difficult.

Is yours on the driver' side?  Try pulling off the bracket
that holds the fuses and pulling out the plastic tubes that
supply the fresh air and defroster difussers.  I think you
can reach it that way.
