Subject: Mudflaps, oil pressure, etc. - medium-long post


First-

I got the right front mudflap installed this weekend (now the westfalia's 
yin and yang are balanced).  The rear flaps are obviously not intended to 
attach to a late model GL with the wrap around bumpers (since they have the 
&quot;ear&quot; that attaches to holes drilled in the sheet metal behind the fender 
well.  I can't gain anything by cutting off this part of the flap, because 
there's still the matter of the outboard hanger bracket that is meant to 
attach to the lower edge of the sheet metal (which is also obstructed by 
the bumper).

There must be a later model version of the rear mudflap.  Anyone have a 
pair to trade?

Second-

The mystery of the missing oil pressure LED became even more bizzare this 
weekend.

After doing all the Bentley checks on the instrument cluster and getting no 
results, I took the back off the speedo to have a look at the oil pressure 
sensor control unit (AKA the &quot;L&quot; board).  Guess what?  Missing!  Dealer 
parts guy was in on Sat, so I got one (for you wrecking yard hounds, looks 
like it's the same part as used on Golf II/Jetta II models).

Installed, buttoned everything up, wondered how it would work.  Well, LED 
flashed once when the key was first turned on, and that was it (kinda 
suspected it should continue to flash until the engine is started and the 
pressure builds, like in my Golf II).  However, after a couple of stops, 
the thing would start buzzing as soon as the revs topped 2,000.  Sounds 
like the high pressure (0.9 or is it 1.8 bar) circuit was open.

Back at the house, I started checking connections.  If I remove the 
instrument cluster many more times, I'm gonna start wishing it were 
Velcroed in place!  Disconnected the two wire connector on top of the 
engine and bridged the two contacts.  Put the VoM on the two connections at 
the instrument panel connector; nothing.  Checked each wire individually 
using the chassis as the loopback.  Still nothing.

Okay, trace the wiring from back to front using the book.  Says there's a 
connection in a box on the front &quot;firewall&quot;; found.  Wiring to this point 
checks out okay.  Check from here to the front again (just in case there's 
a bad connection at the box); still nothing.

Take the fuse box out; there's a ton of connectors under there!  Damn cover 
still won't lift (snagging on something halfway up).  Pop it off and remove 
the screw holding the box.  Drop the whole mess down, and guess what?  The 
yellow wire (higher pressure) has been cut and a slide-on lug connector 
installed (why?).  The connector's just flappin' in the breeze, too.  Break 
out the cordless soldering iron and shrink wrap.  Done.  No wonder the 
buzzer was going off.  If the revs hit 2,000 and the control unit reads the 
circuit as open (which it obviously is!), it thinks the oil's on vacation.

The blue/black wire has been pulled right out of the plug, end connector 
and all.  Bigger dilemma; there appear to be two places where it could fit, 
but which one?  Can't afford to guess (and risk letting the smoke out of 
the wire).  Bentley book's no help either.  Doesn't even list the 
behind-panel connector in the wiring diagram, and sure doesn't tell which 
hole the wire should be in.  Can see its &quot;twin&quot; coming out of the connector 
leading to the instrument panel.  Start to do a continuity check between 
the &quot;known&quot; pin on the socket to the instrument cluster, and the unknown 
pins on the main harness socket.  Dang angle's all wrong;  three hands and 
a goose-neck eyeball would sure be handy now.  Starts to rain, and besides, 
it's time to button the car back up and get myself cleaned up for my 
daughters graduation.  Have to fix this one later.

Heading to the graduation.  After the oil warms up, coasting with engine 
revs over 2,000 produces the annoying buzz and flashing LED.  Drat!  Guess 
I have an idea why the wiring was buggered up.  Wonder if the PO verified 
that the senders were okay before he hacked the wiring?  Hope there's 
really not a lubrication problem.  Wish I had a gauge instead of this 
verdammte idiot light!  I'll probably end up down at the wrecking yard to 
figure out where the blue/black wire goes, but it still won't solve this 
problem.

Sunday morning - the book says 20-50 weight oil in this climate.  I know I 
put a quart of 10-40 in it on the trip, so let's get the right oil in it 
(it's due anyway).  Still beeps after the oil warms up.  Please, Odin 
(probably best to invoke a Teutonic god in these cases), let it be the 
switch and not something diabolic like a spread center main!

(conclusion forthcoming - if anyone has any ideas how this story might 
likely end, please feel free to contribute)
