Subject: '82 diesel Injector Pump timing symtoms?


        I am trying to decide if I need to use (read buy) the dial guage to
retime the injector pump correct the proublem that I am having.  So, to the
people that have used the guage to retime ther diesels, what were the
symptoms of an out of time engine injector pump? (the flywheel TDC bump, the
camshaft notch, and the injector locking pin all line up)

        Now for the long drawn out, what I have done to this point...

        I was driving north from Chico, CA. On my way home (several months
ago) when my oil consumption sudenly got VERY BAD (apx. 25 mi per quart).
When I arrived home I found that air was blowing (rather forcefully), out
the breather vent, and when the vent hose was in place the case was over
presureing and pushing the dipstick up and out of the way while forcing oil
up and out the filler pipe through the dipstick hole(thus explaning my
sudden terrible oil consumption).  It also refused to start the morning
after I got it home. (at this point I think that what had happened was the
the timing belt had jumped a tooth, but I didn't think of that then)

        So, I replaced the rings and rod bearings (w/ timing belt, head
gasket, head bolts, and some other small parts).

        Then it wouldn't start.  I then replaced two open glow plugs (they
should be around 1 ohm).

        I then posted this

        I am still having trouble with my 82 diesel.  It is not reving up
under load, ther is air geting into the fuel (Ican see it in the clear line,
it is most visible when I turn the engine off) I am deting ready to replace
the line from the tank to the filter, does that sound reasonable?
[end quote]

        Based on advise I recieved as a response to this, I replaced the
seal behind the pulley on the injector pump.  This helped a lot, but I can
not get the van over about 45mph.

        Previous to all this it would run at apx 60mph on this same test run
(Hornbrook CA to Klamathon).  I tried running with a diferent set of
injectors (out of a TD, I dicovered that the injectors for the TD are
difrent than the nonTD injectors, the TD injectors are rated at 155bar and
the normal injectors are rated at 130bar).  It seemed to run about the same,
but a bit noiser for some reason.

        It also seemed to have one other air leak in the injector pump that
I will mention, for what it's worth.  There was still a air leak (but not
nearly as bad as it had been).  It wouldn't idle and there was still some
air leaving the pump after shut down (the air bubble in the clear tube had
gone from the length of the tube to apx four inches long).  So, I squirted
oil at the various outside seals on the pump, and when I oiled the seal on
the hexagonal plate on the side of the pump it sudenly started ideling right
and ther is now almost no air at shutdown (less than 3/4 of an inch).

        At this point, there is no excessive air coning out of the breather,
and the van is idleing ok.  But it is too slow to be drivable (and the temp
guage is right at the LED, it seldom got half way to the LED before).  I am
now thinking fuel pump timing, is there anything that I should check first?
