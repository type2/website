&gt; Well, here's the scene in BC as experienced by a loaf driver:

&gt; NEVER gotten a wave, or even an eye-to-eye look, from ANY Eurovan around 
&gt; here on a paved road.  Yuppie mobile.  I tried waving all spring and 
&gt; summer, but now I wave rarely at E-vans--I guess I don't take rejection 
&gt; well.  ;)

Just keep fannin' the flames.  Your report almost exactly mirrors my
