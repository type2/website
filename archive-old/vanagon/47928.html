Subject: Re: speedometer in Syncro

Well, since it's friday, I was wondering .. ..
 Dennis said &quot;The Speedo can be reset by resetting the pointer on the 
shaft.&quot;  So that would leave the speedometer showing about 4 miles per 
hour while its parked.  Now wouldn't that run up a lot of miles on the 
odometer that we never drive?  Dennis?
