I enjoyed reading about your Syncro and hope to one day have one. 
Meanwhile we travel in a 1971 VW Westfalia with a 1981 Toyota engine.  I
have various travel stories about trips to Baja and a trip to the end of
the road in Alaska.  When you have the time, check out.  And, maybe add me
to you link page.
