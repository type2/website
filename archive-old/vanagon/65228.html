Subject:      VW EuroVan chassis &quot;Rialta&quot;

I've seen a couple of real live motor homes based on the EV chassis.  These
are called Rialtas.  Anybody know anything about them, who makes them, how
much they go for?   Though small for a typical motor home they are much
larger than a EV Winnebago camper.  Probably a bathroom and microwave in
there somewhere but I haven't gotten a peek inside yet.
