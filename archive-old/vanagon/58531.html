Subject: Re: Running syncro w/o driveshaft?
Date: Thu, 17 Apr 97 18:10:27 PDT

&gt; 
&gt; What about the feared, but no one wants to try it to find out thing with the
&gt; four tires needing to be of equal size and wear or your coupling winds up and
&gt; up untill it goes boing? If the drive shaft was not in, and the syncro was
&gt; driven, I suppose all tires would go around the same amounts anyway, but
&gt; could something get put out of sync?
&gt; 

Mechanically speaking, one of my many tricks, the VC would be driven from 
the wheels rather than the driveshaft (duh) since the DS has been replaced by
elements of the air and space museum.  Now if the VC is always &quot;hot&quot; or 
engaged like with rotation coeficients that differ by ~10% it will indeed 
deteriorate (don't ask how I know this) but it is then always under load and
is always transferring power.   W/O the DS the VC has essentially no load 
as there is no power input.

So the question begs...if no load can you hurt it?  Still no definitive 
answer.
