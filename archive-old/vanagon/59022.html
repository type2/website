Sunday...read a few of the digests sitting around on the ol' HP sleepstation.

Water heating:  saw a most fine bus conversion (schoolbus) they had a super
heavy duty blue waterbed on a rack on the roof.  Had to cover it 'cause the
water got tooo hot.  Put an insulating layer on at night so hot water available
for the morning shower.  

The virus thing:  On a snoozestation an .exe file is not dangerous as you can't
execute it.  However on a PeaSea using windoze and some glitzy mailer if you 
doubleclick the attachment to the text message IT WILL RUN and do whatever it
was designed to do.  This is deadly for the unwary.  So never boink any 
attachment that is an .exe or .bat or _dot_com file UNLESS YOU ARE CERTAIN OF IT&quot;S
ORIGIN and IT HAS BEEN SCANNED FOR VIRI!

Don't ask how I learned this.  Now back to your regularly scheduled programming.
