&gt; Have I missed something?
&gt; 
&gt; The time cited is the same that was planning (I thought) for the GNATT!!
&gt; 
&gt; What's the story here folks!!

Basically, the Bay area folks are tethered to their area by a 200 mile
rope, and therefore can't make it on GNATT, so they planned their own
little trip instead.  :) =)  

Actually, I think some of them have work and school-related commitments
which are keeping them from participating in GNATT for more than a
weekend.  I just hope this Bodega thing doesn't turn out to be bigger
than GNATT!
