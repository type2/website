&gt; i have a 91 gl vanagon with power windows that are going. dont know if
it is
&gt; the regulator or motor. Any experience with this out there? thanks

Dear Erlaz,

	With my 91 Carat it was the motors; both sides failed within about 6
months. After 5-6 years in this humid climate, corrosion apparently
&quot;gummed&quot; them up. The cure: disassemble door, remove motor from regulator,
reattach to power. They wouldn't turn, but after manually turning the
motor shaft several dozen times, the DID! Applied liberal amounts of oil
while running each one. 
	Water obviously getting inside passenger side door and that window still
sounds &quot;sick,&quot; but works. The first time inside the door took me some
time, but should they relapse, I should be able to have them out on the
bench in 30 minutes.
	If motors work fine, then it's the regulator. They can break, from what
I've read on this list. So far my knowledge here is theoretical; and I
pray that it remains that way.
