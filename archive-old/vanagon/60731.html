&gt; Ok, I don't know about you, but I can't read the Statz for beans.  It's the
&gt; part about &quot;where you all tell me you are&quot;.  I think it's standard
&gt; abreviations for states and countries, but the alphabetic order seems hosed,
&gt; or do we just have a lot of canadian listees???? (Where the heck is
&gt; CAN.ON.OTT, CAN.BC.VAN etc. etc..., anyway??)
&gt; 
&gt; ACTUALLY - I'm hoping there are lots of Canadian vanogoners, in fact, I hope
&gt; most of them have Syncro's.  And do we have anyone in South Africa?? and how
&gt; about the members in Europe/England/the Nordic countries etc???
&gt; 
&gt; I'd like to ask you to call your local or not so local favorite
&gt; dealer/aftermarketer/shop/whatever and track down what the correct front
&gt; Bilstein shock is for a SYNCRO Vanagon, vintage '84 or so on to '91.  I'm
&gt; getting some info here in the states, but so far no confirmation that such and
&gt; such a Bilstein is the correct one for the SYNCRO front.
&gt;  
&gt; The front shock for the SYNCRO is different because it has a spring perch on
&gt; it.  The standard Vanagon front shock does not.
&gt; 
&gt; Let's see if we can nail this one down for the archives.  I know I can buy
&gt; OEM, several places have offered, but I want the better Bilstein.
&gt; 
&gt; Lacking the above requested info, I am talking to Bilstein about the
&gt; situation, and may be able to identify a shock that is close.  If that ends up
&gt; the way of it, I'll let the list know what I came up with.  Bilstein offered
&gt; that if I measured diam, length, spring perch diam, etc, he might be able to
&gt; adapt an existing unit for me.
&gt; 
&gt; If I get correct info for the front Bilstein, I'll pass that on to both the
&gt; aftermarketers and the list as well.
