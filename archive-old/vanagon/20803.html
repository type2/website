Hey all you campers fans, 
I have a 1977 vw camper, yellow/orange with pop top, no stove sink but no 
pump. 
The tent is in great shape (water stained but very much intact) good tires 
etc. Beds upstairs and down, ice box and curtains all around, original.

Motor, basket case, I think I droped a valve guide and she will need at least 
a new jug/piston and a valve job on that side. The motor is out for you to 
inspect. It ran proir to droping the motor but she bled oil out of the 
muffler. The valve guide banged around in side the number 2 cylinder. 
She has about 130,000 miles on the body, I am not sure about the engine, I am 
the 3rd owner, it seems that is was rebuilt at some point??? Don't remember.

Take it away!!!!! All of it!
I give up!
$350.
