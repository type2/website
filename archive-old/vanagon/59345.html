Subject: Considering 1997 EuroVan Camper...



I am very seriously considering the purchase of a brand-new Eurovan
Camper (1997 model year).

This is not a trivial decision (sticker price = $35,000.00), so I am
curious to know if anyone has firsthand experience purchasing or owning
one of these stylish new busmobiles.

If you do, please share your knowledge.

How much did you pay for the bus? (I never paid full sticker price for a
car before; I don't know if the dealer will expect me to for this one).

Do you have a 5 or 6 cylinder engine (The 1997 has a 6-cylinder)? Do you
like it? Does it run too hot in the summer? Too cold in the winter?

How's the heat? (We're expecting it to do double-duty as a carpooler).

How's the A/C? (And the kids don't like to be too hot).

Any surprises (good or bad) associated with the bus?

Any thoughts (via the list or by direct mail) are appreciated.

Thanks in advance.

PS - It's finally sunny here. I'll shoot some pictures of my 1967 Combi
(which is for sale) and get them up this week. Watch the Type 2 list (or
send me email) for details.
