Subject: Rust on seams

Today I had take a look over two seams that seems to have some rust
under paint. It seems that either VW or someone that had made a job
paint had put some caulking uin the seam. After I will have clean and
put some primer in the seam, will I have to put some new caulking, and
what is this caulking (silicon or what).

Thanks in advance
