&gt;&gt;&gt;Austin,
&gt;&gt;&gt;Saw your thread on the Adventurewagen conversions. I looked at one here
&gt;&gt;&gt;in the Houston area (just called rather), and researched the factory.
&gt;&gt;&gt;All is as you say, but one question, is it possible to alter the upper
&gt;&gt;&gt;bed to make it sleep say 2 adults? I am looking for a Westy, have wife
&gt;&gt;&gt;and 2 kids (hoping for one more soon) and I like the raised roof, but
&gt;&gt;&gt;need the sleeping space. What is your opinion on fabricating possibly a
&gt;&gt;&gt;sliding-berth addition to the upper bunk, is this do-able?
&gt;&gt;&gt;Thanks much. BTW This is an 87 Adventurewagen conversion which is very
&gt;&gt;&gt;desirable as wifes everyday driver is 87GL 7Pax.

&gt;&gt;Hi Mark! - actually the upper bed is already 'compressed' - the front end
is     ~ even with the rearmost seat-back; it has 3 different lengths to
which it may be extended, which of course shrinks the 6'2&quot; headroom
available.  The longest upper bed available is (also) 6'2&quot;, but anyone that
tall better be able to emulate a pretzel to get up there.  Because the
lower bed is a variation of the 'weekender' style of bed, the so &amp; I honied
that &amp; stuffed the rr's up above - they loved it as they had the side
windows, rear window, their own reading light, &amp; a nice elevated view
outside.  We dumped the mattress pads for the lower bed &amp; got one of those
blow-up jobbies from Costco (+ a turbine inflator-do *NOT* try to blow one
of those suckers (?) with lung power; you're gonna feel *real* weird &amp; the
kids won't respect you when it's half an inch high &amp; you've given up.
Don't ask.)  In doing so we gained another covered 'trunk' behind the
seatback.  We also slide the middle seat out (&amp; gain a couch in the
garage); I ordered it without camping ammenities so that I can use it as a
hauler (4'x9' with the hatch closed) - you could carry baby giraffes back
there!  I like this setup so much that I've had 2 of them (1st a '70 that I
bought used &amp; drove up to Ft. Bragg for a weekend installation by Ed - he
even put us up in the motel by the river just out of town that can be seen
in the movie 'Overboard'.  This one -'87- I had him buy &amp;  convert, all
done over the phone.)  Still wish I had the '70 though, after putting a
Corvair engine &amp; transaxle in it, it was a very nice driver.  Cubic inches
definitely count.
