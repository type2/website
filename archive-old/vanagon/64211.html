Subject:      Re: Mold

On the advice of another listmember I used bleach and water. There was a
change of color, because the process removed not only the mold, but an
accumulation of dirt.  It did not take off the fuzzy stuff.  I had no
problems resulting from unscrewing (and later rescrewing) the curtains from
the walls in order to clean my curtains. Jim McCarthy '87 Syncro Westy

&gt;Use &quot;Chem-Dry Stain Extinguisher&quot; carbonated cleaner.  Available at
&gt;Chem-Dry Carpet Cleaners, Price-Club/Costco etc..  Works GREAT!

&gt;&gt; We've just acquired an '84 Westfalia with two problems (well, a lot more
&gt;&gt; than 2 problems but only two for this posting).  Dennis, the Westy, has
&gt;&gt; mold on his ceiling.  I am afraid to scrub it because I think I might
&gt;&gt; take off the sprayed-on fuzzy stuff.  Does anyone have a solution?  Will
&gt;&gt; bleach discolor the fuzzy stuff?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; My other question is about the curtains.  I really would like to give
&gt;&gt; them a good cleaning but am concerned about unscrewing the fabric from
&gt;&gt; the wall.  Will it ruin the fabric? Does anyone have any other
&gt;&gt; suggestions?
