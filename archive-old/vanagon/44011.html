Subject: Immaculate '76 Westy For Sale in PA


This literally was the proverbial &quot;sitting-in-a-barn&quot; bus find. 
It is not perfect, but it's as nice as many I've seen on display at 
VW shows.  Easily one of the best that's every crossed my path.

1976 VW WESTFALIA DELUXE CAMPER with 76,OOO ORIGINAL MILES.
Garage kept.  Same owner for 17 years.

CAMPER INTERIOR is nearly perfect.  Has stove, sink, AC/DC fridge, 
sleeps 4.  Not a single chip in the cabinetry.  Upholstery is 
nearly perfect.  (Only rip is about 2&quot; near drivers seat seam.  
Also, front seatbacks could use to be restuffed.)  All of the 
&quot;extras&quot; are still there (center console-box/stool, both tables, 
rear mosquito screen, front windshield curtain, both manuals, etc.)

POP TOP CANVAS is perfect. 

AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION.  I was surprised how well this camper 
drives with an auto trans.  No problem on steep hills.  Top speed 
in excess of 70 mph (it wanted to go faster, but I didn't want to 
push the motor).  Shifts smoothly.  A little sluggish from dead 
stop to 30 mph, but easily as good as any 4-speed after that point. 

TOTALLY SOLID BODY.  The rockers, floor, etc. are COMPLETELY 
rust-free (remember, it was garage-kept).  There is a little 
surface rust at the bottom of the windshield gasket, as usual.

NO DENTS.  Sage-Green paint was touched up in a few spots, and is 
not perfect, but looks good.

RUNS GREAT. Motor was replaced with a 1.8L, single Weber carb. 
Plenty of power.  Steering is the tightest I've ever felt on a Bus, 
probably due to the low mileage. Tires are like new.  Intermittant 
MINOR hesitation when pulling out from a dead stop, but carb 
cleaner or adjustment may solve that (hadn't been run in 3 yrs.).  

PRICE:  $4500 and well worth it.

Email me or call (610) 754-8989 for more info.  I am in Pa., 
between Philly and Allentown.
