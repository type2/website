Subject: Re: Heater booster fans


Hey Folks, 
I recently installed the 3&quot; in my bus.  The 4&quot; won't fit.
A better option, if there are such things, is to get the 3&quot; fan
with 2 or 3 speeds.  My fan only has one speed, and I think if there was 
high and low, the low would be great for improved heating, and the high
speed could be used for rapid defrosting.  It's probably worth it
to find a dual speed fan IMO.

&gt; A short time back there was a thread about the Barney's heater booster.
&gt; The less expensive route was to go to your local boating shop and
&gt; purchase bilge fans.  For those who do not have the luxury of boating
&gt; supply shops in their locale, I just received my Overton's discount
&gt; boating supply catalog, and they have said fans in 2 sizes.

&gt; Turbo Blower 3000 - 3&quot;id, 135 cfm open flow - $18.95
&gt; Turbo Blower 4000 - 4&quot;id, 220 cmf open flow - $20.95
&gt; 
&gt; tel # 1-800-334-6541
&gt; fax # 1-919-355-2923
&gt; 
&gt; usual disclaimer - don't work for, own, operate, know Overton's, etc....
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers where it was 98 degrees today,
