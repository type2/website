Subject: Magnetic Vanagon Window Screens

Got JC Whitney Catalog #578J in the mail the other day. On page 92, it lists
magnetic Vanagon window screens for $33.95 per set (2). It says:      

- Magnetic vinyl edging attaches easily &amp; holds securely....no bracketes or
hardware required
- Glare free fiberglass fabric keeps out bugs and leaves while improving
ventilation.
- Won't interfere with normal window operation. Intended for use only when
van is parked. Washable fabric. Safety strap locks screen when door is
closed to prevent theft. Stores easily.

The part number is 12BP2743R

Their phone number is (312) 431-6102

I don't know anything about them, but they might be handy for those of you
who camp out!!
