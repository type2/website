Subject: Re: shakedown trip with infant


&gt;Clearly this technique isn't going to work once she's more mobile - I don't
&gt;want to find her sleeping in the foot well by the sliding door! Has anyone
&gt;come up with any interesting tricks to keep a sleeping infant confined
&gt;safely?

We decided to sleep in the upper bed. So the lower one was free for use as
a children's room. We set the rear seats to the upright position and
separated the room above the engine compartment with some removable plywood
and blankets. Of cause, we left some open space to get in and out, good
enough for the child.

We all were happy: The child with an own separate room with TWO windows,
and the adults having late dinner without disturbing the kid.
