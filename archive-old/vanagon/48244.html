Subject:      purchase advice

We are new to the listserv, and newly retired. In 1969 we bought a VW &quot;camp-
mobile&quot; and used it well until 1977. We'd like to purchase another and see the
USA and Canada. Any advice on what we should be looking for and where we might
find it? We have no mechanical ability and would like a Westy that is in good
condition. What's a reasonable price? Thanks for any counsel you can give us.
