Subject: Back frim Canada and Louvers!


This is a post about 1.5 weeks old due to Gerry being down.
Hi All. We're back from our tour of the Canadian Maritimes and it was
great! Siegfried , the wonder westy, only had one problem. One day we had a
lot of rain and we found ourselves racing to the next gas station as I
watched the gas gauge needle go down! We had very little power and the
engine was not happy. I got some WD - 40(next to duct tape the most
important thing I use) and sprayed the engine compartment. I also rapped
the idle stabilizer and Voila - fixed!! He ran fine the rest of the trip.
The OX Sense light went on the Friday before we came home and the
conversation went -&quot;Uh, hon, could you look in the glove compartment and
see what the Oxygen Sensor light means.&quot; My wife - &quot;okay&gt; Let's see, bring
vehicle to dealer for resetting of light and spend ing money.&quot; &quot;Okay, no
problem&quot;. I figured that since it didn't flash and beep we could go at
least 2 more weeks without fatal damage. Anyway, the trip went well, saw
lots of other Vanagon Westies, fewer bays, one split and some Eurovans. We
love the Maritimes and if anyone would like more details, let me know. Now,
we were also able to breathe a lot freer because we now have louver windows
in the slider and driver's side!!! It took some doing and a little faith,
but they're in! Boy it is nice to have AIR! I promise to put together my
experiences with this task. I have to credit Ron Maxson for the initial
plans and inspiration. Ron, did you ever get access? Somepeople have
already expressed an interest in this. I have you in one file. I will post
info when I have it together. If you want, email me direct and I'll put you
in the Louver file. I'm not sure if I can scan the plans in etc. That will
be the trick. Anyway, nice to be back.
One question - can the numbers that were with the posts from the old list
come back? I found it much easier to go to the ones that I wanted to read
that way.
        Think Louvers!!
        Mike
