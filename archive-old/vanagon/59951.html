Kelly et al.,

You should not lose coolant.  The Vanagon has a closed water system that
should pass a pressure test.  Losing a bottle a week is excessive, you
should check this with a pressure test.

&gt; &gt;I have the same problem.  As far as I know, all coolant leaks were fixed
&gt; &gt;and I STILL have a regularly dry overflow bottle.  I'll be looking for
&gt; &gt;suggestions, too.

&gt; Me too.  Maybe this is a very common problem.
