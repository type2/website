Subject: RE: valve adjustment + what else


1) as far as glue for the gaskets, i've heard use silicone based glue
or whell bearing grease.  anyone have an opinion.

Personally I use just a little bit of Blue Permatex, on the &quot;cover&quot; side
of the gasket only. This is the kind of application it's designed for.
