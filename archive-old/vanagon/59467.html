I have had virtually no problems with my AMC heads on my 80 Vanagon since
installing them about 20K ago, but I did something that I always do with
new heads - I remove and hand-lap the valves in to insure they are
matched with the seats.  Some AMC heads have been poorly put together in
my judgement and I always pass this info to customers purchasing them. 
Some customers have reported back saying that what I told them was very
good info and that hand-lapping definitely improved the valve and seat
match.  Time and mileage will tell however as I haven't heard back from
any customer purchasing the AMC Type 4 or Wasser heads with a problem in
the past year or so.

However, I do agree with Ron that even now I get REAL hesitant to supply
these heads, especially after taking a double-nickel tour through AVP
about two weeks ago.  Leonard was very thorough in pointing out the
deficiencies on AMC verses a proper rebuild.  I am upgrading my 84 Westy
to a 2.1 and recently purchased a set of remanufactured 2.1 heads to
complete the project.  In my opinion and FWIW, this guy knows his stuff
when it comes to Wasser Heads.  In addition to the &quot;minute&quot; cracks
between the seats, another seldom known problem area is where the casting
numbers and stampings are on the outside.  Very thin metal (water jacket
behind) in these areas and if they crack, the heads are junk and he
tosses them.  Ones that aren't cracked in this area, he really builds up
additional strengthening by welding a higher &quot;boss&quot; area.  Looked at the
production/welding area that was being done on these heads and was
impressed by the depth he cuts the head between the seats area to re-weld
and does a very impressive job of welding up the pitted area as well -
very professional.  Has 3 Bridgeport machines set up just to re-machine
in 3 steps the mating areas to exacting tolerances that I don't believe
you will find in a mass - producer like GEX (I've been to GEX many times
over the past 20 years - like night and day in some respects).  Above
all, the place is clean enough to eat off the floor too.  Love the great
service, because he tries to take the time to carefully explain what
should have been done, what actually was done, what's being done and what
you as the customer needs to do when replacing the head.  A real small,
but nice place to do business with.

The usual disclaimers, no vested interest, etc....
