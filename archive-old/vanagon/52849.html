Subject: Re: O2 sensor

&gt; i had a quick question about how i loose power on my 86 vanagon(terrorist
&gt; van). and was told i loose power after warm up due to a bad O2 sensor. so i
&gt; decided to call up my local supplier for the part and he says 140.00 for a
&gt; new one. i told him id let him know. then icalled my second option and they
&gt; said for 70.00 they would show me how to wire a &quot;generic O2 sensor&quot; in place
&gt; of the oem part. my question is what is so special about this oem sensor? is
&gt; it a 3 wire heated unit or just something with a fancy plug and price tag? 
&gt; 
BMW's use the 3 wire version of the O2 sensor.  What I discoverd is 
that the 87 Ford Mustang Bosch O2 sensor is the same one.  I buy one 
of those for about $55, splice it in, and everything is A-OK.  FWIW:  
many BMW owners on the BMW list do this w/ no problems.  I suspect 
that the Mustang sensor will work on the Vanagon too.
