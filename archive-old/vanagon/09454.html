&gt;Does anyone know of a way to grease a throttle cable without removing it.?  My
&gt;cable in my 1987 Syncro is beginning to bind and makes some weird noises when
&gt;the accelerator pedal is depressed.The problem seems to be worse during colder

check with motorcycle repair shops. they have a pressure cable greaser for the
older (i guess they still have them, anyway) bikes (that don't have hydraulic
brakes).  just a thought.
