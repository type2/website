Subject: Re: Help! I'm very confused.

(snip)
I have some shims from my spare engine which appear to be .008 inch shims. 
If I add one of these, I can get to .005, but at that point my flywheel
won't turn anymore. I'm confused. Is this symptomatic of some much larger
problem? I'm sure the end play is way too much to live with at .012 or
.013.  It's very obvious that my crankshaft would be slamming back and
forth and dramatically reducing the life of my engine. I've tried
everything I know to no avail. I hope someone out there has a good
suggestion. 


Oh NO! Sounds like the pounded rear main bearing syndrome to me! What is 
happening is that the rear main bearing is moving in and out when you check the 
end play. Sounds like .005 worth, based on your description. You have either 
installed a standard thrust bearing in a case that has a single thrust cut, or 
the journal is worn, and needs to be cut. You will need to disassemble the 
engine to do this. Good news is that it should only cost you about $30.00 for 
the work.

E-mail me if you need some info.
