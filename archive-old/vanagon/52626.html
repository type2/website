Subject: Re: Propex installation: lazy man's armchair plan

&gt; As for the heater and brain, if you just move them out of the way (my
&gt; recommendation now that I've been through it) its just a matter of
&gt; loosening three screws and removing two- really a two minute job.
&gt; 
&gt; So while it will not save all the interior efforts, overall, I *like*
&gt; it!
&gt; 
I too like the external idea, but for another reason: being able to 
remove the rear bench seat without *too* much trouble. I had to do 
this to clean up the mess from a leaky rear heater core, and while it 
was not too difficult, having a gas line running inside the seat 
&quot;box&quot; would make it much tougher. Presumably, running the line 
through the floor directly to the furnace would allow for a quick 
uncpuling of the gas line, provided the hole in the plywood allowed 
the end to slide through when lifting the seat.

Geez, by the time I get my Propex (next year I hope..), it'll be a 
piece of cake to install! :))
