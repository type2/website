Hi Volks,

In case you haven't seen the various threads about this vgon, here's
another :-)

Anyway, this is my first dealing with an automatic transmission, sorry if
these questions are obvious:

1) the tranny seems to shift fine and pretty quietly, but I cannot get it
to kick down into passing gear. Ie, when going up a hill, it won't
automatically kick down into a lower gear. I can manually do this with no
problem, but the manual says not to exceed 54 or so in second. The owners
manual says to push the pedal &quot;pass acceleration&quot;, even if I go to the
floor, it won't kick down. Is this normal?

2) the rpm's at 65-70 mph are about 4000 or so. This seems close to the
edge of the 'green' area on the tach. Is this ok/normal?

Thanks for the time/bandwith!

tony
