Subject: Piston slapped

Just got word from my VW dealer that my 93 EV does in fact suffer from
piston slap. Thanks to the list for making me aware that such a thing
existed.

Who'd a thunk it? Two weeks ago I'd never heard of it; now I are one!

What strikes me as odd is that of the 19 EV owners on the list, at least
two of us have this condition. The regional VW service rep had this
condition on his EV.

Now, I don't know very many EV owners (does anyone?) and this is either a
weird coincidence, OR there may be a larger problem here than has been
previously acknowledged. I choose B.

The dealer, by the way (Carter's in Seattle) is handling this great. All
repairs will be covered under the powertrain warranty, loaner car, great
service, etc. I've heard their reputation in the service dept. is pretty
good (he says with fingers crossed).

Other EV owners may want to listen extra hard to their engines when
starting up first thing in the morning. If you hear a banging (sort of like
a diesel engine sound) that goes away after about 15-30 seconds, it might
be worth your while to see a dealer for their evaluation.
