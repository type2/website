Anybody on the list headed to the Merle Watson Festival
in Wilksboro, NC this weekend? I haven't been before but
it's supposed to be a lot of fun with great music and
camping. Four days and 8 stages with live music.

I have a metallic silver '87 Westy which will have my
initials (JH) on a piece of paper in the windshield. I'll
get there Saturday morning and stay 'till Sunday morning.
Please feel free to stop by.
