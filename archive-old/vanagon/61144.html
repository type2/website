&gt; &gt;     2. I'm betting that wear of the Nylon slides is the reason my windows
&gt; &gt;     sound like the dreaded &quot;fingernails-on-chalkboard&quot; when I open and
&gt; &gt;     close them.  Garth seemed to intimate that the required number of
&gt; &gt;     these thingies is 8 per vehicle; true?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; Ditto.  My wife wanted me to ask the list if anyone had any brilliant
&gt; suggestions for getting rid of this hideous sound.  I thought of WD40 but
&gt; over time it will attract a great deal of dust and dirt.  Any other
&gt; suggestions out there?

I know they make a silicone based lubricant for bicycles.  Might be a
good option.  I really hate that noise when I am camping at night!
