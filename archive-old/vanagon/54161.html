Subject: Shifter, Mudflaps and the like

I've sat front row center to this list for just a little over 2 months,
absorbing all the advice you've offered each other.  Thankful for a
support group with such a vast knowledge base.  Now I would like to tap
this resource starting with small steps.

1) Shifter occasionally pops out of 1st upon acceleration with a BIG
   thunk.  Happened with the old and new transmission.  Ideas?

2) Has anyone replaced the drivers side mud flap?  And if so what      
fastener did you use?  How did you reach into the body panel to
   hold it in place?

3) Any list members in the SoCal area??  

Thanks - Dan
