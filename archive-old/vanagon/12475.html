Subject: rebuilding old distributors

I've read a number of posts about people being tired of using the Bosch 009
distributor in their pre-1972 Buses.

I have about a dozen old distributors, four of which I could use on my Bus.
 All of them were sufficiently worn to cause problems with setting the
breaker point gap.

  I have heard that the lobes on the cam that opens and closes the points
can get worn down and cause problems, but I have noticed that the problem
with my old distributors is that the bushings around the distributor shaft
are worn, and the shafts have some side-to-side play in them.

I tried using the old distributors, and was unhappy until I switched to a
new Bosch 009.  Compared to the old, stock, vacuum advance distributors,
the 009 really &quot;screams.&quot;  Maybe this is because the old distributors are
worn out, right?

Has anyone ever tried to rebuild their old stock distributor by replacing
the bushings?
