I highly reccomend the Lloyd mats. I have a set in my Audi , and they fit
perfectly, match the carpet, and even have the 4 ring logo on them.

I called them about a set for the Vanagon, and they had a set for the front
driver and pass, and between the seats. The price was around $50, the mats
are custom fit to cover all exposed areas, and match the Vanagon carpet
color. I don't know if they had the VW logo on them or not, tho.
