Subject: Place Yer Bets:  Westy Fridge Contest

On Friday, May 3rd, at 5:00 Central Twilight Zone time i fired up my fridge in the 
'87 with supposedly a full tank of fool (i filled it in January and 
have kept the valve off...).

When Will It Run Out?!!?

Geek Data:
-the ambient temps are ranging from the 30's to 50's F  night to day.
-interior van temps go into the 70's and 80's
-yes, the fridge is on continuously and at max coldness.
-and no, my fridge doesn't blow out when driving (and we won't start 
THAT safety thread again, i know i'm in danger :)
-lowest recorded fridge temp so far is 19F!

Winner of this contest gets an all expenses paid subscription renewal 
to vanagon_at_lenti.
