yup. :)  but i do NOT recommend getting that close to a truck ... it was
like maybe 6 to 10 feet back of the trailer's rear end. NOT a comfortable
place to be. and if a cop happens to see you back there (assuming the
trucker doesn't get really pissed and tap his brakes ... i asked him on the
CB radio if i could try it. he said it was my funeral.)

&gt;hightop.  I am inclined to believe that 40 mpg is possible, but I
&gt;imagine that to achieve that one would have to be going at a good clip
&gt;while having their gas pedal depressed only a fraction of an inch

if you want to get 40 mpg in a bus, just pick a windy day coming out of
Raton, NM heading for Amarillo, TX. that downhill grade with a tailwind
out of the mountains will get you up in that neighborhood. :)
