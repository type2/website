&gt;Steve reminded me (us):
Uh... SUV: 1939 Jeep?

Rusty sez:
How about a covered wagon? Before wagons there was the horse. How about the
thing made out of to poles with a hide across them that the Native Americans
of the Great Plains used to drag behind them? I think mebbe &quot;Og&quot; the caveman
used an old hide to drag his family around on before the pole fad hit. &quot;Oj&quot;,
Og's abusive brother used to drag his family around by their hair... Nothing
like a trip with the family!

Seriously, there was a display at the local RV dealer that included a very
very bitchen vehicel that must have been from the twenty's or very early
thirties that had a huge camper on the back which was basically Gramma's
kitchen on wheels with bunk beds. Metal screening and metal top counters. It
seemed big enough to hold a soccer game inside!
