Subject: needed: slding door hanlde for 84' vanagon

Does anyone have a sliding door handle that they would like to sell for a 1984 
Vanagon (Westfalia). My friend's extrernal sliding door handle broke off and he is 
looking for a replacement.

He is also looking for an affordable source for front exhaust manifolds.

Please respond to me privatley as I no longer subscribe to this list :(
