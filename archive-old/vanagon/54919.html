I just replaced the wipers on my Subaru, like you all not much better 
performance.  Got a container of &quot;Nothin's Better&quot; glass polish 
compound.  You wouldn't believe the difference in having clean GLASS 
makes in getting the wipers to do their job.  Also works great to 
remove the water stains on mirrors.

Did my Vanagon yesterday.  So THAT's what it looks like out there with 
a clear window?

&gt; I've checked to see that the wiper sits square against the glass, it does.  I
&gt; also theorized that the wiper wasn't pressing against the glass hard enough,
&gt; so I removed the arm and shortened up the spring attachment clip to get a
&gt; little more spring tension.  This did not help.

Forget going to the dealer.  Their &quot;wiper bender&quot; is probably just a 
mechanic with his back turned mangling your wiper arm.  DIY

&gt; No, I'm not just overly wiper-sensitive, I've driven in plenty of cars where
&gt; I rate the wipers as just fine, but not my Vanagons'.

Clean your glass.
