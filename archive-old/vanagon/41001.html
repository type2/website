The solution that I use is to have an account that is dedicated to
receiving mail from this and the other VW list servers. That way your
real mail won't get mixed up with the fun mail.


&gt; 
&gt; Ahhh!  I had no idea there would be so much traffic on this mailing list.
&gt; Is there any interest in switching over to a News group?  Has this already
&gt; been discussed?  I took yesterday off and had over 150 messages.
