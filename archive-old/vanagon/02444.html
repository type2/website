&gt; 
&gt; 	What a devoted group of afficianados (sp) and 
&gt; 	enthusiasts this is. Hard to imagine a bunch
&gt; 	of people getting excited over Caravans or
&gt; 	Aerostars.
&gt; 
&gt; 	Still babbling...

You know, I was sitting having coffee with a friend and his wife.  An 
Escort wagon went by and one of them commented that they had just 
bought one that was just like it.  There was this moment of silence 
and then the subject changed.  What could I say?  There is no comment 
on Escorts, etc...
