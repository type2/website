So Dan Houg says:

&gt; &gt; Joel: I have never put a wet noodle up a wildcat's rear end, much less
&gt; &gt; anything else ;)
&gt; 
&gt; this must be that Southern sport referred to as   *noodl'in*
&gt; (actually, noodl'in is far worse-- copius amount of alcohol followed 
&gt; by a trip to a river whereby one reaches his/her hand and arm up into 
&gt; holes in the bank with the hopes of grabbing a 30 pound catfish.  nevermind 
&gt; the cottonmouths, gators, etc.--  but I'm a northerner and really 
&gt; couldn't substantiate this.  they drive to the river in a VW van)
&gt; 

I just thought it was another one of those things people in the South
did where they wanted there victim to &quot;Squeel like a pig!&quot;.  ;)
