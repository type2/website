&gt;It was nice of you to tell us about the Tucson VW gathering. It would have
&gt;been nicer if you told us where the thing was being staged. Tucson is a
&gt;big place with lots of car shows and places for them to be held.

Yo, John, Dude! ;-)
I know the post was kinda vauge but I typed in the exact text that was
posted in the Bus Club newsletter. It was vauge. Get a clue and call Jon
Stanton at (602) 877-8662 or Jerry at (602)867-7672 for more details.
Typical bus club, freeking vauge until the last minute... I will post the
details as they become available to me. Hang tough and plan on being there.
Poop, as it is *I* dont even know where Corona de Tucson is. I figured that
it can't be that much of a brain strain to find it. I will look for the exit
to Corona de Tucson off of I-10 and then search for the VFW post. At worst
case I will look in the phone book and nab the address and then ask the loco
locals for directions to the VFW... I think it would be easy to find a
rednecked Vet down there ;-) 
Hey, I am going just to see if the VFW crowd gets along with the bus freaks
any better than a campout shared by a Montana militia and a Phish tour...
hee hee hee oughta be interesting... Funky Arizona~! Y'all come...
Sorry folks,
VanBondo\

At the very worst case, hang out near Corona de Tucson and look for the
invasion of splittie buses and join the parade. If I lived in Tucson, I
would jam down ther early and nab a good spot before the cluster... oops- I
mean, caravan arrives!
