Subject: Re: vanagon engine lid


&gt;&gt; Th  Those of you (eg Westy
&gt;&gt; owners) who lift off the the cover rather than rocking it back against the
&gt;&gt; seat should keep an eye open for a plastic lid in wrecking yards.
&gt;
&gt;	Has anyone had any experience using these in a camping situation?  Do
&gt;they hold up well, or will they develop stress fractures and drop an
&gt;unsuspecting sleeper into the engine compartment?  I have a chance to
&gt;buy one
Check your 87 Westy closely, you probably already have a plastic engine lid.
My 87 syncro Westy came with a plastic lid and I thought it was metal until
I examined it closely.
