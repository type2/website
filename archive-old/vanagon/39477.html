Subject: RE: Oil temp

Brian G. asks if an oil cooler could work too well.  Most oil cooler instal-
lations will include a thermostat that sends the oil right back to the
engine, not to the cooler, if the temp is below 170-180.  So worst case
the oil cooler would be &quot;wasted&quot;, not overly effective.  Thermostat is
especially important in an installation like mine where the oil cooler is
in front, behind the (81 Vgon) grill, at the end of a LONG run of hose.
Absent the thermostat, engine would try to push 80-100psi cold oil through
the system at startup, likely blowing the cooler or a connection somewhere.

On a cold day, the oil cooler doesn't get used until the van's been running
for a while, but it always gets used; the cooler on the engine can't keep
the temps below 180 even in 10oF. weather, especially at idle.
