Subject: Camper Toilets

Ok this isn't the most tasteful of subjects but has anyone got any good
suggestions for  portable toilets for my '82 Vanagon Camper?  I've got a
wife and two little kids that want to go camping in the bus but aren't
trilled about using the &quot;o-naturale&quot; latrine facilities.  Any real world
experiences along with manufacture and model information would be appreciated.

Please keep the bathroom humor to a minimum ........Thanks
