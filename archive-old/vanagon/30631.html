I was at the local FLAPS reading the Haynes shop manual for
'68-'79 Transporters.  In the middle of the book is a cutaway
view showing the drivetrain and location of an auxilary gas
heater.

It's underneath, mounted just forward of the transmission, 
in-line on the ducting that runs from the heater boxes to the 
steel duct pipe under the cockpit floor.

Remember this is from a Haynes manual for bay window busses.
I've never actually seen a gas heater in a bus, so I'm a little 
curious.
