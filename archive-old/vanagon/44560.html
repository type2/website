Guy on our oboe/bassoon list sent me this- all you Westy campers should
appreciate this one!

&gt;&quot;   The Boston Globe Magazine, June 25, 1995
&gt;
&gt;Today's culinary topic is: how to light a charcoal fire.
&gt;Everybody loves a backyard barbecue. For some reason, food just
&gt;seems to taste better when it has been cooked outdoors, where
&gt;flies can lay eggs on it. But there's nothing worse than trying
&gt;to set fire to a pile of balky charcoal.
&gt;
&gt;The average back-yard chef, wishing to cook hamburgers, tries to
&gt;ignite the charcoal via the squirt, light, and wait method,
&gt;wherein you squirt lighter fluid on a pile of briquettes, light
&gt;the pile, then wait until they have turned a uniform gray color.
&gt;When I say &quot;they have turned a uniform gray color,&quot; I am
&gt;referring to the hamburgers. The briquettes will remain as cold
&gt;and lifeless as Leonard Nimoy. The backyard chef will keep this
&gt;up - squirting, lighting, waiting; squirting, lighting, waiting
&gt;- until the bacterial level in the side dishes has reached the
&gt;point where the potato salad rises up from its bowl, Bloblike,
&gt;and attempts to mate with the corn. This is the signal that it's
&gt;time to order Chinese food.
&gt;
&gt;The problem is that modern charcoal, manufactured under strict
&gt;consumer- safety guidelines, is one of the lease-flammable
&gt;substances on Earth. On more than one occasion, quick-thinking
&gt;individuals have extinguished a raging house fire by throwing
&gt;charcoal on it. Your backyard chef would be just as successful
&gt;trying to ignite a pile of rocks.
&gt;
&gt;Is there a solution? Yes. There happens to be a technique that
&gt;is guaranteed to get your charcoal burning very, very quickly,
&gt;although you should not attempt this technique unless you meet
&gt;the following criterion: You are a complete idiot.
&gt;
&gt;I found out about this technique from alert reader George Rasko,
&gt;who sent me a letter describing something he came across on the
&gt;World Wide Web, a computer network that you should definitely
&gt;learn more about, because as you read these words, your
&gt;11-year-old is downloading pornography from it.
&gt;
&gt;By hooking into the World Wide Web, you can look at a variety of
&gt;electronic &quot;pages,&quot; consisting of documents, pictures, and
&gt;videos created by people all over the world. One of these is a
&gt;guy named (really) George Goble, a computer person in the Purdue
&gt;University engineering department. Each year, Goble and a bunch
&gt;of other engineers hold a picnic in West Lafayette, Indiana, at
&gt;which they cook hamburgers on a big grill. Being engineers, they
&gt;began looking for practical ways to speed up the
&gt;charcoal-lighting process.
&gt;
&gt;&quot;We started by blowing the charcoal with a hair dryer,&quot; Goble
&gt;told me in a telephone interview. &quot;Then we figured out that it
&gt;would light faster if we used a vacuum cleaner.&quot;
&gt;
&gt;If you know anything about (1) engineers and (2) guys in
&gt;general, you know what happened: The purpose of the
&gt;charcoal-lighting shifted from cooking hamburgers to seeing how
&gt;fast they could light the charcoal.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;From the vacuum cleaner, they escalated to using a propane
&gt;torch, then an acetylene torch. Then Goble started using
&gt;compressed pure oxygen, which caused the charcoal to burn much
&gt;faster, because as you recall from chemistry class, fire is
&gt;essentially the rapid combination of oxygen with the cosine to
&gt;form the Tigris and Euphrates rivers (or something along those
&gt;lines).
&gt;
&gt;By this point, Goble was getting pretty good times. But in the
&gt;world of competitive charcoal-lighting, &quot;pretty good&quot; does not
&gt;cut the mustard. Thus, Goble hit upon the idea of using - get
&gt;ready - liquid oxygen. This is the form of oxygen used in rocket
&gt;engines; it's 295 degrees below zero and 600 times as dense as
&gt;regular oxygen. In terms of releasing energy, pouring liquid
&gt;oxygen on charcoal is the equivalent of throwing a live squirrel
&gt;into a room containing 50 million Labrador retrievers. On
&gt;Gobel's World Wide Web page (the address is
&gt;http://ghg.ecn.purdue_dot_edu/), you can see actual photographs and
&gt;a video of Goble using a bucket attached to a 10-foot-long
&gt;wooden handle to dump 3 gallons of liquid oxygen (not sold in
&gt;stores) onto a grill containing 60 pounds of charcoal and a lit
&gt;cigarette for ignition. What follows is the most impressive
&gt;charcoal-lighting I have ever seen, featuring a large fireball
&gt;that, according to Goble, reached 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit. The
&gt;charcoal was ready for cooking in - this has to be a world
&gt;record - 3 seconds.
&gt;  There's also a photo of what happened when Goble used the same
&gt;technique on a flimsy $2.88 discount-store grill. All that's
&gt;left is a circle of charcoal with a few shreds of metal in it.
&gt;&quot;Basically, the grill vaporized,&quot; said Goble. &quot;We were thinking
&gt;of returning it to the store for a refund.&quot;
&gt;   Looking at Goble's video and photos, I became, as an American,
&gt;all choked up with gratitude at the fact that I do not live
&gt;anywhere near the engineers' picnic site. But also, I was proud
&gt;of my country for producing guys who can be ready to barbecue in
&gt;less time than it takes for guys in less-advanced nations, such
&gt;as France, to spit.
&gt;
&gt;Will the 3-second barrier ever be broken? Will engineers come up
&gt;with a new, more powerful charcoal-lighting technology? It's
&gt;something for all of us to ponder this summer as we sit outside,
&gt;chewing our hamburgers, every now and then glancing in the
&gt;direction of West Lafayette, Indiana, looking for a mushroom
&gt;cloud.
