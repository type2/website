Gerry steps in regarding comments made 'bout my screen comment...

&gt;You don't get it, Stuart. You are supposed to respond with an
&gt;equally rude and denigrating comment about either lawyers or Jews. (Guessing
&gt;here on &quot;Golen&quot;).


Actually the lawyer part is true...but would you believe I'm 100%
Polish...probably explains a lot!  ;-)

Some people think that Golen is a shortened form of Golenski...but
my relatives were so poor, they couldnt buy the extra three letters..
(S..K...I).


While we are on Polish humor...why do many Polish names end with
SKI??



'Cause they couldn't spell Toboggan!



If you are offended by this lack of political corectness, remember one
thing....If you can't laugh at yourself...then who CAN you laugh at?
