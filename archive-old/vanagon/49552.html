Here is my response, mailed not to Marsh but to SmithBarney_at_iddis_dot_com:

-----------CLIP HERE--------------------

Please direct this message to the CEO of Smith Barney.

Dear CEO

Some fellow by the name of Ward Marsh, or perhaps Howard Marsh is sending
out unsolicited and annoying messages over the internet. He is using a
process called 'spamming', whereby he gets ahold of a list of names and
then, with very little effort and no expense on his part, he sends an
unwanted solicitation to each member of the list.

If 1% of the recipients respond favorably, Mr. Marsh does very well.

What you may not know, is that the other 99% of the recipients now think
very lowly of Smith Barney, and will not ever trade with Smith Barney.

Thus this method works solely to the advantage of Mr. Marsh, and is very
deleterious to Smith Barney.

You should dissociate yourself with this fellow immediately and send him to
a real bucket shop, where he belongs.

Yours sincerely
