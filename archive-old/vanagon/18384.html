Subject: Re: [f] Kavorkian drove a VW

Bob Hufford was thinking that it would give him the creeps to own Dr.
Death's bus...

Rusty sez:
I would totally loose it if Dr. Kavorkian was complaining on the list about
the &quot;Dead spot&quot; in his PICT34-3 carb or the jerking motion/hesitation in the
F.I.

...........................................................................
&gt;Did anyone catch that Dr. Death used to drive a VW bus? He had a&gt;Someone
needs to start a famous VW Bus museum.  Add the Branch Davidian 
&gt;(sp?) Bus seen in all the video footage of the Waco raid.  Kavorkian's 
&gt;Bus has been used for assisted suicides in the past.  It would give me 
&gt;the creeps to own it. :(

&gt;&gt; windows.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I say &quot;used to&quot; because it was impounded when they found his last
&gt;&gt; customer inside it. There was a picture of it being towed away about 2
&gt;&gt; weeks ago, in some Bay Area newspaper.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; That's the way to go...inside a VW! I hope he gets it back soon.
