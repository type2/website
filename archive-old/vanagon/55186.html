Subject: Re: Fw: Ques: squeak under passenger seat.

This just started happening on my 87 also, and seems to be worse in cold
weather.    I'm suspecting the upper supension bushings, but haven't done
any real diagnostics yet other than spray silicone spray on all the likely
rubber bits  (made me feel better but didn't bother the squeek at all).
Next step is to get my family to jump up and down in the front while I
probe with a stethoscope.

&gt;BTW, the squeak is on my '83.5 (temporarily NOT for sale, might be keeping
&gt;both :-)

&gt;&gt; Helloall
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; There is a pronounced squeak emanating from under the front passenger
&gt;seat
&gt;&gt; |on 89 Westy. Squeaks regardless of whether or not a passenger is seated.
&gt;&gt; Any suggestions?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Thanks.
