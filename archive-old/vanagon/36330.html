&gt;I think that means Kombi, right?

If it was a kombi, it never had interior.  Does it have headliner clips and
glue remnants
up on the top?  Then it was a standard.

&gt;It seems like $2000 is more appropriate, but this bus is really rust free.

Depends.  Whats the body like?  How's it run?  Tranny?  Steering/Suspension?
