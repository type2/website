Subject: 85 Westy running warm.

Hey volks.

My 85 Westy has been running warm lately.  Granted, the weather here in VA is
getting warmer, but I can't seem to get the van to run at quite the right
temp.  The needle on the temp guage usually rides right in the middle of the
'low coolant light'.  Lately its been running a full 1/8 inch above the
light.

I was thinking about removing the coolant thermostat for the summer.  I need
to change over to phosphate free coolant anyway which means opening the
system (and consequently bleeding it).  It also appears that my water pump
belt is a touch loose.  It is tightened as far as the pulley will let me take
it.

Another strange symptom is when I have the front air selector switch on fresh
air, I still get heat though the front duct work.  Its much less than when
the heater is on, but its enough to be uncomfortable and really give the AC a
challenge in cooling the interior.

I am planning on draining, flushing and refilling the coolant system with
phosphate free coolant next week.  I thought at the same time I would replace
the water pump belt with a new one (so I can get it tight) and removing the
thermostat.

Last spring I did a complete rebuild and replaced all of the rubber coolant
hoses.  I am wondering if I installed the front hoses correctly.  Would it
make a difference which way I hooked up the two hoses that attach to the
radiator?

The other question is....is it okay to run the van in the summer without the
thermostat?  Also, what other possibilities could be causing the engine to
run warm?

Thanks in advance....
