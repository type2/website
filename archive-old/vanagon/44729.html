Subject: Re: Open letter to... &lt;less VW content&gt;

While I've found most people dealing with VW's not to exhibit this kind of
behavior, it is very prevalent, and especially so among mechanices.  This
is one of the reasons I own a VW and learned to do repairs myself.

Another recent example for me is my bike (which I also repair myself).

Me:  The freehub seems to be toast.
Scott the bikeshop guy (his real name):  What makes you say that?
Me:  I can pedal 1/2 stroke w/o the whell moving.
Scott:  Let me ride it.
&lt;rides the bike&gt;
Scott: The chain seems to be skipping.
Me:  The cogs don't seem to be worn
Scott (with just the subtlest sarcasm tone):Oh well, I don't know of
course, I just work on em.
Me:  Ok, goodbye.

I didn't leave quite so fast, however the trusting relationship I had
heretofore developed with the bike shop evaporated, as I don't need that
kind of non-professional treatment.  Maybe my assesment was dead wrong and
naive, however, I don't need that kind of message about it.  A nice &quot;well,
if you'll notice right here...&quot; would have been much more appropriate,
don't you think?

ranting,
Eric
