Subject: GNATT - one more call for participation!
Date: Fri, 12 May 1995 18:15:31 -0700 (PDT)

Well folks, the time is drawing near.  One week from today I am outta here,
and in two weeks, Busses by the Arch will be a reality.

I just got done updating the &quot;participants&quot; sections of the GNATT web page.
I count 22 people that have told me recently (like in the last 3 months)
that they will be attending part of the tour.  There are about another 20
that I haven't heard from in a long time, so a few of them may go as well.

Of all these, close to half are not actually going on GNATT, but just
meeting up at BBTA or some other point on the tour for a day or two.  A 
far cry indeed from the hordes of busses we had imagined mobbing the 
interstate.  It even looks as if I may be doing a portion of the trip
alone (from Waterton Glacier to BC).  Most of the blame rests on me for
not organizing it better and getting more people involved.  Still, I
think it will be worth all the trouble, and hey, it's not too late to
join!  :)

The following people I do not need to hear from regarding GNATT, because
I have talked to them recently about it:

Bell, Alistair (ui775_at_freenet.victoria.bc_dot_ca)
Brill, James (jbrill_at_unlinfo.unl_dot_edu)
Dakhlia, Sami (dakhlia_at_wuecona.wustl_dot_edu)
McGee, Ryan (ryan_at_falcon.cc_dot_ukans_dot_edu)
Lytle, Dyer (lytle_at_noao_dot_edu)
Walker, Joel (JWALKER_at_UA1VM.UA.EDU)
Rubin, Martha (nrubin_at_s1.csuhayward_dot_edu)
Sellers, Pete (pete.sellers_at_ha.osd_dot_mil)
Skerbitz, Gerry (gsker_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu)
Stafford, Jack  (STAFFORD_at_alcor.hac_dot_com)
Venama, Chris (CV06089_at_UAFSYSB.UARK.EDU)
Wright, Mike (wright_at_storm.simpson_dot_edu)

Anyone that is considering attending, that is not in the above list,
I NEED YOU TO CONTACT ME ASAP and give me the following information:

Which part(s) of GNATT you are thinking of attending
Your Phone number (optional)
Your Address (very optional)

I need this information to help coordinate meeting points for the tour.

Thanks,
	-David (Wannabe GNATT coordinator)
