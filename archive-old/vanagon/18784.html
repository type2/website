Subject: Brake parts


To All:

Replacement of all springs, return &amp; stand-off, keepers, nails, and
self-adjusters,  is a good idea when replacing brake shoes (and makes the job
go faster).  Drum-brake hardware kits are normally available wherever you buy
brake shoes.  If ordering from J. C. Whitney the stock number is 55FH3487P,
seven bucks (for two wheels).  Cite year, make &amp; model when ordering.

In a similar vein, any time you replace the front shoes or rotors it's a good
idea to replace the grease seal ($2 each, also avail from JCW [listed under
Wheel Bearings]).   You may also find my post on Brake Grease of interest.
 (Sorry; JCW doesn't carry it.) 

(No, I don't work for J. C. Whitney but I usta do brake jobs for Pep Boys.)
