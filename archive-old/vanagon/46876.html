Subject: fram filters

I recentley replaced the fuel filter in my 82 diesel with a Fram filter 
purchased at a FLAPS.  I was cautious about using it as it was much 
smaller than the one the PO had in it and the drain bolt was painted in 
with that blindingly bright orange paint.  I've also used the oil filters by 
Fram as they're only $3.99 locally.  At the very least the orange paint 
brightens up the drab interior of my engine compartment! ;)  Has anyone on 
the list had any bad experience using these?  I haven't had any trouble yet, but would like to avoid it!
Should I open the piggy bank and get Bosch or some other type?
Thanks
