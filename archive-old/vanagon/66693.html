Subject:      Re: seeping from core flange

&gt;|     The connection to the heater core is very fragile.
&gt;| I have seen them break right off, if one tries to tighten them too much.
&gt;| If someone breaks it, it is better if the dealer does it. At least, they
&gt;| will have to replace it for free.

        I will second this as I broke mine trying to fit that little square
seal to stop the dripping. Then I tried fabricating my own gasket and applying
a healthy amount of form a gasket to seal it. It was tight for a little while
but the crack I put in the valve flange (right by the bolt, not down where
the coolant flows) allows the valve to flex and leak when the system is
at pressure. VW parts guy quoted me a price of $56.95, though I know they can
be had cheaper at the Bus Depot (unless the quote was a typo). VW parts guy
also related a story of a friend trying to replace the valve and could not
get the VW gasket to seal, so he loaded the flange up with High Temp silicone -
that's my next try once I get a valve...
