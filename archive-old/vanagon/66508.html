Subject:      Eurobago Norcold Ref Update

Today I called all the local Denver VW dealers to find out the current
scoop on the High Altitude Kit for the Norcold Frige as previously reported
on the list.  All the dealers said &quot;We don't do that, call (insert random
suggestion here)&quot;  After many calls to Winni service centers, Norcold
service centers, and Norcold I got as many different stories as people I
called.

The final deal came from Winni Customer Relations who offered to ship me
the Kit for free, said to contact the authorized Winni service center
(dealer) in my area (they would not allow a Norcold dealer near me) and
that the service center would call them and they would authorize warranty
labor less $88.00.

So I pay $88.00 of the labor and no parts.  They are shipping the parts to
me directly so I will update the list on the progress.  This seems like a
reasonable result to this annoying problem.
