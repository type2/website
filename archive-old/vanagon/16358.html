Subject: For Sale in FL, 1975 Westy $2000

Ran across a Westy for sale yesterday.  I remember someone from FL asking 
about a bus that was not in too bad of shape.  The bus has the normal 
rust associated with it (the front seals have been replaced, the trim is 
a little rusted, however the main panels and frame appear intact).  It is 
still the factory original orange.  The bus has a ....1600?  1800?  I 
can't remember, but it is a factory rebuild with 14K on it.  A Weber 
2-barrel carb with 10K.  The inside is pretty immaculate with the claim 
that the upper bunk has NEVER been used.  It started up right away, was 
tending to stall out after a while.  Owner says that it blows smoke and 
he isn't sure why, has done it since he got the engine.  Overall this bus 
looks really good, I'm wishing I hadn't bought the Vanagon from hell and 
I would pick it up myself.  I didn't pop the top, but from the inside it 
looked OK, no mildew or wear and tear.  The phone number is (904) 
445-2399...I think?  If not, give me an email and I will drive back down 
and find out for sure.  The guys name might be jack.
chuck peterson...i think?
