Subject: 90 or 91 vanagon westfalia loaded &amp; in great condition

Hello vanagon lover:
I used to own a fully loaded 1990 vanagon westfalia camper (nonsynchro) 
and I loved it.  I am looking for another 90 or 91.  The only thing 
different, if anything, is I would be interested in a synchro possibly.
If you have any information, please please please, contact me about it.
Thank you &amp; hope to hear from you,

D at aaronm_at_sierra_dot_net
