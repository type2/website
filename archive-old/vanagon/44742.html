Subject: Re: breadloaf air flow meter



&gt;There is a strange situation with my 79 bus.
&gt;When I turn the key to the 'on' position, the fuel pump turns on.
&gt;Supposedly, this is a fire hazard!  The fuel pump should only run 
&gt;when the key gets turned to the 'start' position.
&gt;
&gt;This all leads(I think) to the air flow meter.  Is this the 
probable 
&gt;cause?  How do I test it?
&gt;

When this happened to my '77, the culprit was the air flow meter, 
which was passing a signal on to the dual relay when it shouldn't 
be.  Check the schematics in Bentley, and test with a voltmeter.
