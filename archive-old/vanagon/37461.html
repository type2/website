So then, Mike &quot;loose bolts&quot; White stated:

&gt;Since this is my third time around at losing the main bolt, I've got 
&gt;some big plans. I understand there is a heavy duty lock-tite stuff 
&gt;that will work to hold it in.
&gt;
&gt;Does anyone have any experience with this stuff?


That would be Loc-tite blue if you ever want to get the bolt off again,
and Loc-tite red if it's going to be pretty permanent.
