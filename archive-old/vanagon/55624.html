&gt;Well today I had my alloy wheels put on using the studs that were on the
&gt;car.  The factory alloy lug nuts _at_ $1/ea from junk yard.  And Saab 9000
&gt;alloy lug nuts also _at_ $1/ea from saab mechanic.  I will let everyone know
&gt;if my wheels fall off:)

I had this happen to me once.  In my bug.  It was disconcerting.
