Subject: re: Hydr. lifters

    When adjusting valves properly, they will lift off thier seat. 
    You must wait 1/2 hour or so before starting engine to let
    lifters bleed down.  It is normal for these lifters to
    ocaisionally loose thier prime.  The ticking noise will usually
    go away after 20 minutes or so. I find that running engine for
    short time without allowing full warm up will often cuase a
    lifter to bleed down and click on fiture startup.  I find this a
    common problem as I often move Vanagons around the yard for
    access into the garage.. Dennis. 

I've discovered this, although by accident. After frequent 
starts/stops over a few days, my new '88 was sounding horrible from 
at least two lifters. One long drive &amp; she runs like a champ again...

I haven't lost my mind;  I'm sure it's backed up on tape somewhere!
