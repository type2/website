Subject: Good AND inexpensive tire pump, where to

 &gt;&gt; 2/ Buy a foot pump: Real cheap ($5-10) but do they work? Do they last?
 And how long would it take me to pump the tires from 20-45 PSI?
 I hate to buy potential junk that break on me when I really need it. &lt;&lt;

 - These modest claims are from the most recent Griot's Garage catalog.  Get
yours by calling 800-345-5789.  I've ordered a few small items from them in
the past and have had good luck with their stuff.  Their *prices*, on the
other hand...
