Hi,

I have for sale a 1972 (paperwork says 1971) VW camper.  It runs well
and has a new muffler.  I just drove it 10,000 miles from Texas and
it performed flawlessly, apart from having to replace the muffler.
I've been living comfortably in it for the last few months and I
need to sell it to buy a plane ticket.

Replies please to harold_at_speakeasy_dot_org

Thanks
harold
