&gt; Back in early August R-134 conversion kits were being discussed.  At that
&gt; time I mailed the following letter to VW:

&gt; kits.  I am pleased to inform you that our engineers are working on such a
&gt; project, however, Volkswagen has nothing currently on the market.

This could mean anything.  There still in the conference room sipping coffee
and brainstorming how to make the most money while investing as little as
possible.

&gt; Our parts department is not aware of any third party product to advise.  We
&gt; will continue our development efforts and advise the public as soon as one is
&gt; available.  Thank you for your interest.

This means &quot;We're not about to about any aftermarket products since 'they' are
'our' direct competition.  And we don't plan to tell give you any clues in
the future.

Sincerely,

The Mouth of VWUS


&gt; 
&gt; Sure would have been nice if they would have mentioned a time frame for
&gt; their conversion kits.  I would like to get the ac fixed in at least the 
&gt; Golf next spring since that is the wife's transportation, but I would really
&gt; like to hold out for a R-134 system. 
&gt; 

I just hope they have one for the Vanagon in mind.
