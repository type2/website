Happy Solstice Vanaganoids!

I need to buy a set of cabinets for my 78 Westie (PO removed them in a 
 fit of serious cranial rectitus) and I found a set at a local salvage 
 yard. The yard boss said they came from a 76 and includes: propane 
 tank, Sink cabinet with burners and all the plumbing, rear side 
 cabinet, upper cabinet, and the cooler unit. The guy said it was an 
 electric fridge unit and showed me a control panel which looked to be 
 a battery gauge and a switch between AC and DC. The cabinets are in 
 good condition with minor delaminating that could be fixed, asking 
 price is $275 which I felt was a tad steep. My questions are: is this 
 a fair price? Is the electric fridge worth the hassle of dealing with 
 battery drain? Do the internal stoves work well? I was looking for 
 something similar in functionality to my 71 which was pretty simple 
 but the thought of on board propane has my interest up.

Thanks Clay

PS. In walking through the lot looking at one dead Bus after another it 
 struck me that most Busses in junkyards die slow deaths by being 
 hammered until they can't go any more and then sold for scrap. I 
 looked around and saw other cars that had been in major accidents 
 (including a 914 burned to the ground) and died instantly but no 
 busses, kind of made me sad.
