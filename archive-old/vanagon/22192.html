Subject:        sway bar or stabilizer?

&gt;Well, our 17-year-old son broke the sway bar on the blue and white 
&gt;'71 bus. He said that it just *popped* when he turned left.  Yeah, 
&gt;right!


    I had a sway bar break on me (also on a blue and white '71 bus). 
Managed to fit a replacement with a little brute force and ignorance. 
I recomend buying new fixing kits as they make it a little easier. A 
big hammer also helps!
