&gt;Subject: Mail Readers

Yo Dudes. I used to be a cranky old crank on this list until I got the right
mail reader. (Remember the birth of the /f symbol back when I used AOL?)
Anyway, I discovered that the problem was the mail reader software in AOL
that made it time consuming to read or delete any messages. 

Now I use the fully liscenced version of Eudora and it is killer! That is,
it automatically sorts all my mail from 15 mailing lists into their own mail
boxes. Then, I can open any one mailbox (like my Vanagon mail) and tell
Eudora to first sort this mail by subject. Then I can delete all mail on
subjects I don't like and open all mail on subjects I do like. It takes just
seconds to read a day's worth of Vanagon mail in contrast to the old days,
when it took, like 30 mins. 

Using this software, it is actually faster for me to read the non-digest
version of the Vanagon list than to read the digest version.

By the way, my wife did indeed write up an article about the Vanagon list
for publication next week in Newsday and New York Newsday. This is, like, in
the top 10 newspapers in the country for circulation. But I doubt if we'll
get many new list members out of it since, well, there arn't any VW Vans out
here in the VW Van desert of the east coast. 

The VW vans are all out there with you guys in California, Oregon, and
Washington. How lonely we are in the rest of the country. :( 

When I visit California I cannot believe it. People actually own and use
these things!

&gt;&gt;messages a day w/o being able to sort, see headers, etc. The freedom for many
&gt;&gt;of us would be dramatically increased. I know folks on rec.autos.vw who can't
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Am I answering the right question?..... I use PCEudora running under 
&gt;Windoze. My mail shows up with the original posters name, date+time, and 
&gt;header. It is an evaluation version (no kidding it even says that!) and 
&gt;works great. Replies are posted to the list automatically when sent. So far 
&gt;so good, would this help your problems?   tim s.
