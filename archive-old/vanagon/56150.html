Subject: 1981 vs 1982??

Vanagoners,

Last week I posed the question:
&quot;Does anyone know of any visible distinctions between the 1980 &amp; 1981
Vanagons?&quot;

I had assumed that the change from integral metal engine air intake grills to
the black plastic one had begun with the 1982 models.  Several wrote saying
that this started at the beginning of the 1981 model year, but apparently
this difference began mid-year 1981 with some 1981 models having each
variety.

Apparently there is no clear way to tell an 80 from an 81 except by the VIN?
Unless it has the plastic grills, but then it might be an 82 as well.
Comments?

My new question now becomes:
Does anyone know of any visible distinctions between the 1981 &amp; 1982
Vanagons?

If you're reading this from the Type2 list, please email me directly, since I
don't subscribe to that list.

Any help appreciated,
