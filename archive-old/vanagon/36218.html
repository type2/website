&gt;It is good that you've found some value in my opinions but there is a troll
&gt;under our electronic bridge.  Our remote-ness is a double-edged sword, often
&gt;causing me to mis-read the symptom descriptions posted by some list members.
&gt; And having mis-read, I go into Automatic Babble about the wrong subject.
&gt; Most are wise enough to know a fool when they hear one and are kind, but
&gt;others assume I can Do No Wrong and immediately remove the front bumper as
&gt;directed, even though the problem is with the rear.  I am reminded of Abbott
&gt;and Costello.  Or Buchannan and Dole :-)
&gt;
&gt;Lists such as ours should come equipped with enourmous yellow signs:  READ
&gt;WITH CAUTION.   Immediately followed by:  THIMK FOR YOURSELF, or something
&gt;like that. 
&gt;
&gt;Free advice is worth exactly what you pay for it.  Free BAD advice can prove
&gt;very expensive to the faithful.

But often the advice that helped most was like :

&gt;Back away from the problem a little and let your head get used to it.
and

&gt;Find some more support for the vehicle 
even though I didn't listen to you...  8(    
...and at some point you said, &quot;build up a string of small successes&quot;...
 this is really what kept me going when I was slippery and tired and cussing
out the cheapo grease gun and wrestling stubborn bolts...
