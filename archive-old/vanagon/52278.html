Ritche;
I think it is quite admirable for a young person to set a goal and persue
it like you are doing.  Have you looked into a diesel Vanagon? I would
think this to be a reliable and inexpesive vehicle to maintain. Another
benifit would be is it is not exaclly overwelmed with power and hence
should decrease the chance of speeding tickets. Also the NADA book says
these models run about 50% less than the regular models.
Good Luck

&gt;	Hello...I'm a 15 year old who is interested in VWs.  What I am
&gt;planning on doing is buying a car in bad shape and then fix it up.  Of
&gt;course, I'd like to get it done before I turn 16 because that is when 
***chomp***
&gt;	One last question, how much money should I expect to plunk 
&gt;into
&gt;this car?
