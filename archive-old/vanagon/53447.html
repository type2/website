Subject: '81 Westy gets a bath
Date: Mon, 23 Dec 1996 21:52:10 -0500

Hey all,
Today was the first time I really had a chance to wash the '81 Westy since
I've had it.  I had hosed and wiped it down a couple days ago because it
was covered with road salt (that stuff gets EVERYWHERE!) from the snow/ice
driving adventure.  I wanted to get that salt off pronto.  So I gave it a
quickie bath a couple days ago, once over on the body and hose off the
wheel wells and frame.  Today I actually washed it as it was sunny and in
the low 60's (in December!!) and the previous day's rain had washed all the
salt off the roads.  

Man, that Vanagon has a LOT of surface area to wash.  Whew!  It took a
while to wash it and then it took even longer to wax it.  At least now it's
got a bit of protection for the paint.  While getting intimate with the
nether regions of my Vanagon I found a few places that are in need of some
touch-up paint, so I'm taking care of that.  

I also tested the city water connection for the first time (with the garden
hose).  Found a leak where the hose hooks up to the faucet under the sink. 
Tightened the connection with my 19mm wrench and no more leak.  

Anyway, the Westy is looking better than it ever has.  It cleans up really
nicely :) .  That medium blue paint shining in the sun :) .  The
white-painted wheels really look sharp with that blue paint.  Especially
when you clean all the brake dust and other crud off the wheels :) .  

Man, I love that bus!

Sean
