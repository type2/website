Subject:  Horn

                                      Horn

Problem:  Horn don't work.  Fuse is okay.

Volkswagen uses a different circuit theory for their horns.  The horn is hot
all the time, insulated from the chassis by the isolator/bracket.  The wire
that goes to the steering box is hot, as is the horn.

Test the horn.  With the hot lead hot, use a jumper to ground the other
terminal.  The horn should sound.  If not, you have a bad horn.  I'm very
sorry for you if this is the case because there is no cure.  A horn is a
necessity of life, without it you are going to die.

Pull the horn button, check the wire.  (Horn should sound when you ground the
wire.)  If not, the problem is in the button or the wire.

Make up a continuity testor having a wire long enough to reach from under the
steering gear box to the steering wheel hub.  Test the wire that runs through
the steering column.  If it shows 'open' you'll have to replace it. (see
below)  It won't be shorted or the horn would sound continuously.  If it
proves good, use your static timing light and the wire you've used for
continuity testing to cobble up a test light that includes the horn button
and wire.  Test the function of the horn button.  If it proves good, and
since you've already tested the horn, the problem is either in the terminals
on the wire going to the steering gear box or you have gone deaf between the
first and third tests and the horn is driving your neighbors up the wall and
the cops will soon arrive to blow your young ass away since you are
obiviuously a drug-crazed hippie doper as proven by that crazy old van you
drive.

(The horn button may be corroded, or the entire steering column might somehow
be isolated from the frame of the vehicle [Wildly improbable].  I kinda like
the deaf thing.  In California if you're deaf they let you carry a white ear
and park in loading zones.  If anyone says anything, just show them the ear
and walk away.)

If everything checks out except the wire, the trick to replacing it is to
first get it out of there.  I'll leave you to figure out that part.  To
replace it, you should use a 'fish', a piece of very stiff steel wire with a
loop on one end.  Push it completely through the steering column, tape the
new wire to it and draw it back.  Or pull it through, your option.

When you make a new terminal for the horn button wire, solder as well as
crimp the fitting and seal it carefully with heat-shrink tubing.  You'll end
up with a better fitting than VW ever imagined and it will be the last thing
to fail on the vehicle, probably fifty or a hundred years from now.

Your horn is a legal requirement in all 50 states, Puerto Rico, American
Samoa, Guam, the Ukraine and the parts of California that start with the
letter 'S'.

If you wish to run an air horn, send me a private post with your address so I
can move if you're too close.
