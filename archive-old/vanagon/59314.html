Subject: Heat in the footwells modification

Greetings.  Someone recently wrote that they had performed some kind of
modification to a Westie that diverted heat from the foot wells.  I have
believed that my AC was grossly underrated for the task of cooling the va=
n
particularly since the vents are only located in the rear.

This last weekend I was driving for a short period barefoot and I realize=
d
that the floorboards in the front of my Westie actually get really hot.  =
I
think this must be heat from the radiator or the coolant hoses running
under the floor.  =


I thought that the note had said the &quot;modification&quot; to fix this was liste=
d
in Bently.  I can't seem to find it anywhere.  I've also searched the
archives under all the crazy names I could think of.  Could someone pleas=
e
tip me off as to what and where the instructions for this mod are?  Ideal=

would be a Bentley section reference and any kind of keyword that would l=
et
me in on the insights of those that have already passed this way in the
archives.

Sorry to ask dumb Q's but I have a feeling this is gonna really improve m=
y
summer if It exists.

-Clark
