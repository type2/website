Subject: Re: VW motor lifespan

I purchased my '73 Campmobile with 60,000 miles on the original 1.7 engine.  
At 79,000 I had to take it out for what appeared to be a head gasket leak.  
After I put it back in, it went about 10,000 more miles before broke off a 
valve head in the #1 cylinder.  I then put in a 2.0, which (due to a recent 
move and increased commute) has acquired about 22,000 miles in the last 
year.  It runs great, but leaks some oil.  I hope that it lasts much longer, 
since it has hydraulic lifters.

On a related note, how long does a transaxle last?
