Subject: 71 wiper screech

Last weekend while driving around my wiper system developed an awful 
screech.  It is not from the wipers against the glass, as it occurs when 
they are pulled away.  It sounds as if something is bound or over tight, 
but I haven't touched anything, except putting on new blades.  The other 
symptom is that the wipers won't stop in the correct park position.  the 
switch must be quickly turned on and off to get the to move that last 
inch or so to the correct park position.  I plan to look into it this 
weekend, has anyone else had this problem?  Any comments or suggestions 
that i could mull over in the mean time would be appreciated.
Thanks
