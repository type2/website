Subject:      Re: Dometic manual &amp; HOW TO LIGHT THE REFRIGERATOR

Thanks, George. I will certainly try your suggestions.  I've been dragging
my heels about pulling the Dometic.  Maybe this air pump trick will pay
off.
Much appreciated, Marty

&gt;Don't pull the frig until you are absolutely sure it's broken!  I pulled
&gt;mine twice only to find out that I didn't know how to light it!  I found
&gt;that the problem was that fire requires both spark, fuel, and oxygen (air).
&gt;I finally learned that I could first blow air through the drain hole with
&gt;a small plastic pump. Then quickly click for the spark by pushing in the
&gt;air pump just as soon as I pressed and held in the light button.  What was
&gt;happening with me is that too much gas was getting in, the spark was
&gt;causing a mild pop (explosion) and then there was no oxygen left for the
&gt;next try. You have to add oxygen (air) after each attempt to light the frig
&gt;or all you have in the burner is gas. The propane seems to linger in the
&gt;chamber displacing the air. The combustion chamber is sealed from the
&gt;inside of the bus.  No air can enter the combustin chamber from the inside
&gt;of the bus.  The vent actually contains two pipes, one for the burned
&gt;exhaust gas and another for air to enter from the outside.  Air does not
&gt;enter from the bottom of the burner (it's sealed).  It must first go down
&gt;the outside inlet tube.  When I first start to light I hold the light
&gt;button in for several minutes to give the gas time to blow out all of the
&gt;air in the pilot light line.  Then I pump in air through the drain plug
&gt;(which, by the way, connects to the bottom of the sealed combustion
&gt;chamber)and begin the lighting procedure (see above).  What more can I say?
&gt;It works for me!
&gt;
&gt;Hope this helps!
&gt;
&gt;I may have the parts list and diagram you want.  Let me know if you don't
&gt;find one.  I could copy and send it to you.  Don't have a digitizer or I
&gt;would attach it.
