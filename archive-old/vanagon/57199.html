Subject: Re: Help on importing a Canadian EV Double Cab

In the off-list e-mail I get from the Syncro Westfalia page, the last
week brought three inquiries about directly importing either a Syncro EV
or  EV Westfalia, and while we are dreaming  a Syncro Westie EV would be
nice.  So add these the wish list as well.

The six to eight grand estimate is probably each, figures like that ring
a bell back in the days when lots of gray market euro cars came into the
US.  But the importer may be figuring they need to weld in side impact
protection, add
US bumpers, etc. They may be used to handling cars, instead of the 
less regulated trucks, or vehicles that can meet spec out of the VW
parts bin.  The next question for the importer is an itemized estimate. 

On a similar front, didn't  someone in the Northwest import some Vanagon
crew cabs? New or used? How did the Tri-stars get here?

I don't like to ask questions I can't answer, but these are the things
one would need to know.  One by one, it is a bear. But if we got
together, we'd be a movement....;-).

Don't forget to budget for the 25% duty as well  :-(.
