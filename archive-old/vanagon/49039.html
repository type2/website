Subject: Need advice on Battery Isolators

Yes I know this has all been gone over before but I didn't pay all that
much attention since I didn't have a second battery to worry about.

I'm hooking up an Aux battery.  I want to isolate it.  What subtlties do I
need to know about isolators?


The battery I'm installing is a 12V deep cycle gel cell (Wheel Chair
battery). This battery is relatively tiny (less than half the size of a
regular battery) and yet will provide 31 hours of juice at 4amps.  These
batteries will provide two times, or more, the capacity of a conventional
deep cycle battery at low amps (under 25) loads.   It also needs to be
charged like a conventional auto battery and NOT like a standard deep
cycle.

So, what  do I need to know about isolators?  I have one I bought about 20
years ago (when I was just a tyke) from JCW and never installed.
