--- The first thing you do is get a big cutting torch.... no not really.
When I did mine it became
painfully obvious that it was the first thing they started with and then
built the van around it!! You have to remove almost everything up front to
get to it. Bentleys manual covers enough to get the job done. I highly
recommend that you take the time to lubricate the replacement before you go
through all of that again. My replacement came form Parts Place and was
almost as tight as the one that siezed in the first place. The real hassle
is getting the fan off of the shaft to lube the front bearing. Patience and
careful prying. I'm not sure what to advise for lubricant, I used some
grease that was made for slot car motors. Maybe something from a hobby shop
that they use in RC cars. Took the better part of 4
hours but I'm sure glad I wasn't paying shop labor rates!!! Good luck
Mark
