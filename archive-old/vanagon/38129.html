&gt; &gt; Last night I saw a Vanagon Westfalia Multivan.  This is one incredible 
&gt; &gt; looking piece of German engineering. 
&gt; &gt; Looks-wise, this thing blows almost any Vanagon out of 
&gt; &gt; the water. 
&gt;

He said Vanagon.....

I do like the Vanagon version and the Eurovan Version of this though.....

Pretty bad though If I get named more than Ric about the EV....
