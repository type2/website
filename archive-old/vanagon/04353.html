&gt; NPR has a weekly program, Saturday mornings in my area, called CAR TALK. 
&gt; Two mechanics, Tom &amp; Ray, field call-in questions. They have a great 
&gt; sense of humor making their show funny as well as informative. For you 
&gt; car song fans out there, at mid-point station identification they always 
&gt; have some car-related song snippet in the background. Try identifying for 
&gt; a challenge.
&gt; 

	Ah yes! I'm a Car Talk fan for sure.

	Being a refugee NewYorker, while I prefer to live amongst the
	more respectful, calm &amp; restrained Northwesterners, I'll always 
	have a sentimental attraction to obnoxious, loud, sarcastic &amp;
	abusive Northeasterners (in small doses). That's really why I 
	make an effort to tune in.

	While Ray has little time for older VWs, have you noticed a 
	change in tone since the Passat V6 and new Jetta has shown up
	in their lot to test?

	It's fun to listen to them describe the stereotypical bus owner.

	One of my favorite bits of advice from them:

	Woman called in and said she had an older Datsun with a five speed
	that was slipping out of 5th. Ray told her to go to a junk yard and
	buy a shifter knob from a Datsun with a 4-speed and sell hers as a
	4-speed. Hah!!
