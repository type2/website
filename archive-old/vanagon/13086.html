Subject:       power steering fluid advice needed

I am experiencing power steering pump noise in cold weather (ie below 
0 F).  I see from some tech bulletins that other VWs have gone to 
hydraulic fluid to alleviate this problem.  HOWEVER, on the bottle of 
hydraulic fluid available from the dealer, it says &quot;For all EXCEPT 
Vanagon&quot;

Does anybody have info on this?  Found a product that works?  Why
NOT Vanagons??  I've got a 2.5 gallon jug of hydraulic fluid sitting
in my garage I'd love to use for this...
