I can reply on the rear bumper.  First of all good luck trying to find
a straight used one.  Just the blade if it is chrome will cost arount
$500.00 from the dealer.  You can get a painted (satin black) one for
under $200.00.  I paid around $150.00 2 years ago and had to paint it to
my liking and also drill holes for the rubber impact strip.

To remove the bumper first remove the sheetmetal screws holding the
bumper ends to the body.  The screws are covered by a plastic cap that
must be pried out.

Then remove the 4 bolts holding the bumper brackets from
inside the rear fender wells.

Slide the whole unit out and remove the
plastic retain clips for the rubber impact strip with a pair of pliers
(squeeze the ends from behind the bumper and push through.  This will
exposed the two bolts holding the face of the bumper blade.

&gt; Hello,
&gt;
&gt;     I have found a vanagon which I am interested in buying, but I first want
&gt; to make sure that the fix-ups I'll have to do to it aren't going to cost me an
&gt; arm and a leg.
&gt;
&gt;     I am interested in installing a Weekender-style pull out bed.  Is this
&gt; possible (the van is a 84) ?  Are the fittings the same for the normal seat
&gt; and the puul-out seat ?  Has anyone done this ?
&gt;
&gt;     The rear bumper is missing, and I was quoted &gt; $800 for a new one.  Will I
&gt; have trouble finding a good bumper at the junk yard, and how involved is it to
&gt; replace this ?
&gt;
&gt;     Thanks in advance for any advice !
&gt;
