Subject: Re(2): how engine oil degrades (was: sysnthetic oils)

Thanks for the explanation regarding the two oil pressure switches.  You said
that the 13.1 switch must close with RPM greater than 2000, and if not the
flashing LED and buzzer occurs.  Does this mean that the switch is measuring too
high pressure?  I would assume that when you say the 13.1 switch closes, it
completes the circuit and the LED flashes.  I am still unclear whether or not
the two switches measure too low and too high oil pressure.
