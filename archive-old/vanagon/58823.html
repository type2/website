Subject: re: Paranormal VW story in AZ Republic newspaper (f) 


One day, my wife came home from running errands in our 85.  She told me that
the horn had been beeping by itself.  She was in a busy area and other
drivers were glaring at her.  Then it stopped .

I conducted a thorough investigation and found nothing.

Another day it happened and continued as she pulled into our driveway. Still
I could find nothing.

Some weeks later I was driving the van and the horn started beeping. That was
when I discovered the cause of this commotion.

Many of you will be disappointed to learn that the plaintive sound was not
related to the misfortune of a previous owner, nor the appearance of a seldom
seen comet. No, the unintended signalling was simply due to a key on my ring
sliding between the steering wheel and column, thus shorting the horn ring
and blowing the horn.
