Subject: Gas,Air &amp; H2o, My 84 GL is Drivable!

Hi All,

Now that I have test drove my 84 GL I have a few notes, and questions. The 
coolant bleeding went a lot smoother this time and the system appears to 
be airless.  The 1.9 idles fine, but just a little rough--I'm hoping it 
was old gas.  Speaking of gas, I went to the gas station and filled it as 
it was about empty and deja vu!  Just as I had feared there was some 
overflow problems once the tank was full.  By the time I drove 2 blocks 
it was still leaking, but stopped after a few minutes after I got home.  
Any suggestions on why this happens? The Vanagon had been sitting for a 
few years. All the fluids are now fresh.

The Vanagon's 4 speed was dissassembled when I bought it.  The pilot brg 
and clutch disk was shot.  All that is remedied now and no leaks!   It 
rides/drives smoother than I thought and the Continental Conti's 
reinforced sidewalls perform nicely.  Now for licensing and Buses by the 
Arch!  It's ready for the shakedown cruise after 6 month of sitting in my 
driveway!  8-)  

Will Vanagons remain a mainstay in my vehicular future?  

Will my longtime relationship with air-cooled beaties be severed?  

Yes and no.  The Vanagon has its merits and it's a bit of a test for my (the 
heater works great), but my aircooled Bugs, Karmann Ghias and splittie Buses
will be the object of my refocused venicular attention.  8-)
