hey All...I just picked up my 71 westy. i drove home late tues nite in that slop

 weather we had in NJ. It was quite an experience for someone who hadn't ever dr

iven a bus on the highway with trucks and cross wind and all. Add a little snow
and ice and it is an incredible journey. I still have a few problems, and need s

ome advice...i have vacuum assisted front disc, that are a real pain in the ass.

 The don't want to let go when I first get rolling. Then they loosen up and I'm
ok. 2. no brake lights..I have rear lights and blinkers, even backups, but no br

ake lights. It's not a fuse, I changed all of them. 3. no horn...well I have too

 much horn. Apparently,the horn wire has become exposed and grounds out on the s

teering column, so it beeps when it wants to and sometimes stays on constantly.
I disconnected it, but I want to fix!...This whole job has been an ordeal...I've

 waited 4 months, 3 w/o transportation and I go to pick up the bus at about 5pm
on monday. It is still being worked on, so I begin to help. 32 of the next 40 ho
urs were spent on the bus. I missed work etc and just stuck it out. I paid my du

on and I go to pick up the bus at about 5pm on monday. It is still being worked
on, so I begin to help. 32 of the next 40 hours were spent on the bus. I missed
work etc and just stuck it out. I feel like I've paid my dues after all that tim
e and then a mad dash to the finish. The guy doing the work was from Ed's garage

in Bath, PA( ed is the owner and only guy) and he was great, putting me up and feeding me
 in order to help him get the job done. My bus is smooth now, with the exception of the afforementioned items and the paint, so joel, change the stats!

ps, anyone else on the list that busses in my area, drop a line!
