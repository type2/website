Rocky Mountain Motorworks (800 258-1996) now lists new bumpers for '87
Vanagons at $139.95

&gt;Subject:       Reasonable source of rear bumper for '87 gl?

&gt;Hello, my wife was parking the Vanagon by the braille method and
&gt;banged up the rear bumper pretty bad. Luckily there is no body damage.
&gt;We priced a new bumper from the VW dealer and the price was over
&gt;$400.00. That seems like a lot of money for the thin piece of chromed
&gt;metal that makes a bumper.

&gt;Is there any chance of finding a good bumper in a junk yard? Or is
&gt;there a better source of new bumpers?

&gt;Thanks!

&gt;Later. . . . . . . . . Brad
