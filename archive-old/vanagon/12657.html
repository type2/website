Subject: Re: Embarrassing Question - Where does coil go?

&gt;Todays embarrassing question is...
&gt;
&gt;Where does the coil go?  I seem to remember that it mounts on the fan
&gt;housing somehow, but I'm not really quite sure where or how.  Is there a
&gt;mounting bracket for the coil?

on my '72 it sat on the upper edge of the aluminium cooling shroud, on the 
left I 'think', nestled in a set of curved ribs cast into the housing. A 
metal strap hooked into the space between the ribs, at the top, and a 
longish bolt tightened the strap around the coil. I never liked this, the 
coil got hot, took a lot of vibration, etc. I'd mount the damn thing 
anywhere in the engine compartment that was secure, dry, and within reach of 
the wiring. Minor mods likely needed. Bosch Super Blue coils work very well 
BTW, a bit more $$, however.   tim s.
