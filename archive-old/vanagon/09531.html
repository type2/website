Alright...I got the digest pretty quick...

What was this problem with the weather? I don't remember any cold
weather :) Sure, the river was a little cold, but the 50mph+ winds
that swirled in all directions made for an interesting time.

I heard that Martha went thru 4 D cell batteries for her feet warmers
:) I thought that it was very warm at nite and didn't even use my
sleeping bag, I just used one blanket (and no clothes). Maybe I had
too many beers to know any better ;*) What did we have altogether?
Whiskey, beer, schnapps, wine, ??? and other party favorites ;-&gt;

Of course the lake that formed in the meadow that forced me out of my
tent and into the Copley's van was a minor annoyance, but in general
the trees stayed whole and the mountain sides didn't come down (unlike
they are doing on hiway 17 right now - I hope I can get home tonite).

I should also mention that I was fairly impressed by the great people
that showed up...I have gotten together with several other
usenet/mailing list groups and almost everyone turned out to be the
biggest nerds with no life, but this group was able to offset our
nerdy sides and actually be interesting to talk to and spend time
with. We did spend lots of time together in very close quarters
because of the rain, and it would not have been possible without the
right people. I most certainly look forward to our next trip (and next
time I will try to make a 30 egg omlette).
