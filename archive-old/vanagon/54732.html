Subject: Help me fix my crappy idle, PLEASE!

  I know this question will lead to a long drawn out explanation, but here
'tis... Above idle my 81 Fuel Injected standard Vanagon runs great. BUT at
idle it runs very crappy. It never stalls, but it would be nice to have a
good idle. I've got a new battery, hotter spark plugs, new cap, rotor, and
points.

   I know the engine is back there, but why must it make itself be known so
vulgarly?

By the by, are Vanagons supposed to be slower than a fully loaded 18 wheeler?
