Subject:      Re: Speedometer cable

the old vanagon repair manual i have has this procedure:

speedometer cable, removeing/installing
work sequence
*removing
- disconnect battery ground strap
- disconntect speedometer cable     &lt;from the speedometer, i guess&gt;
- remove spare tire
- disconnect speedometer cable from EGR/O2 sensor mileage counter.
- remove nut from bracket  &lt;looks to be just in front of the sway bar&gt;
- remove circlip from speedometer cable  &lt;on the grease/dust cap, on the
    outside of the wheel&gt;
- remove speedometer cable from rubber sleeve in steering knuckle
    &lt;just behind the tie rod connection&gt;
- when installing cable, align marks on cable &lt;at that bracket, in front
    of the sway bar&gt;
- after installing circlip on speedometer cable end, seal with silcone seal

** caution **
to avoid premature cable failure, position cable so it is free of strain or
sharp bends. do not grease connection to speedometer, this could cause needle
to stick.
