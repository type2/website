Subject:      81 Camper...another newbie question: max safe cruising speed

How fast can you drive an air-cooled Vanagon for extended periods without
unduly stressing the engine? Mine winds out at about 78-80 mph on the flat.
My normal highway cruising speed in a normal car is around 72 or so, but
that's pretty close to the VW's top end. I've read that driving the diesels
at that speed is definitely abuse and will dramatically shorten the engine
life; should I be similarly concerned about my 2-liter?

Thanks again to everyone for bearing with me.
