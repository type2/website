To All:

I'm not sure how well this will apply to the younger vans but with a suitable
engine the older Transporter makes a fine tow vehicle.  Volkswagen produced a
variety of tow-truck/wrecker vehicles based on the early bus.  All included
additional struts from the rear frame to the bumper.  Emulating that
structure on your vehicle will insure adequate strength at the bumper to
handle the tongue-load (a new rear cross-member is usually a good idea).
 Since this transfers the tongue-load to the rear suspension some adjustment
and stiffening will be required.  To deal with the towing-load, the usual
procedure is to fasten tension members to the rear torque tube, supporting
them on the engine mount horns, carrying them all the way through to the
bumper.

A thermostatically controlled fan and remote oil cooler will allow you to
maintain highway speed on long grades and during desert weather.  (2180cc
Type I engine in a 1965 Microbus), with the exception of the 17% Santa
Roselia Grade in Baja California (best tackled at night).
