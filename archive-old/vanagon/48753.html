Subject: propane blues again

Thanks for the many answers re my problem getting LP Gas into the tank.  I
had to bring the camper into the dealer On Thursday past to have shifter
linkage adjusted and mentioned the tank.  They drove the camper to a
&quot;Superior&quot; propane office where the folks procedded to fill the tank!!!
Now, I had gone to a similar dealer while on the holiday road and was told
that I should get the valve replaced.  The VW dealer here said that the
Superior &lt;Sudbury&gt; guy used some kind of &quot;special&quot; nozzle.  I'm off to the
dealer on Monday to see what it is his nozzle has and mine dosen't!  ;-)

Again.. thanks so much for the help!

Barry!
