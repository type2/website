Subject: A/C freon R-134A upgrade...

HI Everyone.  Yesterday, when I was at my local dealer, I found out 
about the R-12 to R-134A freon upgrade kit that VW will be making 
available ... even for the Vanagon.

The kit consists of the followiing (all prices in CDN $$$)

freon (R-134A)  $75
labour (3 hours _at_ $79/hr)  $237
adapter kit  approx. $175

The adapter kit will consist of a new receiver/dryer and various new 
seals that have to be changed at every hose joint, etc.  VW  hasn't 
set the price yet, but my dealer has just trained 3 mechanics to do 
this conversion work, and hopes to make this available by 
the end of May/97. 

Now, he did warn me by saying that R-134A is no where near as 
efficient as R-12 systems in cooling.  Can anyone vouch for that?

Harry.
