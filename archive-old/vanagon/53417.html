    How would you test to find out it was transfering maximun amount
    of torch? 

    I went down a iced hill, that I had a hard time stopping on. Turned  
    around and came backup, stopping in the middle. The Syncro made it up
    but it did sound as if the rear wheels were in a very slow spin.
