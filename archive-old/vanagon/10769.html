Thanks Norman, I receieved the thermostat! I'm sorry this is a public
thank you but I don't have Norman's address....

Norman sent to me an Empi  thermostat which I will install in line with
the second oil cooler under the Westy. The thermostat opens at 175 C. It is
an interesting design- a conventional looking thermostat but one that does
not completely block the flow of oil to the cooler when it is completely
open. At any rate the set up is as follows: oil flows to the
thermostat which remains closed until 175 F; oil is then sent to the second
cooler which sits above the tranny; when the temp reaches 185 an in-line
switch turns on a fan which brings the temp down. A dash mounted light
indicates whether the fan is operating. I won't be putting the thermostat
in until spring, but it should mean faster warms up and in combination
with the fan a  decent range for the oil temperature. FWIW Bernie Bergmann
has a similar setup but it is expensive. This version uses parts from the
junkyard.....but so far it seems ok. I probably would not be going to all
this trouble if quite frankly I thought the OEM set up provided for a
decent margin of overheating, but when driving up the hills of Yosemite
last summer, I found out otherwise. Fully loaded the air-cooled Westy puts
quite a strain on the engine oil and engine temperature leading to loose
heads and oil leaks. Having been
stranded once before in a Karmann Ghia in Northern Ontario for the same
reason I am reluctant to go through it again....
