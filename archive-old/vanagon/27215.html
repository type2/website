Subject: 1980 Vanagon

The big deal is the two top hoses that connect to each other via a
rubber hose that passes through the frame.  When we replaced the gas
tank in my cousin's '87, we had a hard time using the existing rubber
hose to do the job -- too short to snap in place while your friend is
holding the tank at a height so that the tank is as high as it can be
and still let you put your hand in between the top of the tank and the
frame so you can connect the ends of the hose -- the trick was to use
a much longer rubber hose from a parts store (I learned it from
someone on this list -- Joel?? )...  Joel Also faxed me a picture of
the gas tank and the connections to it, which was a lot of help -- I'm
afraid I do not know where I put it, though :-(

Good luck...

 &gt; You may or may not remember the story of the free 1980 Vanagon in
 &gt; Charleston SC. It was given to me by a friend in June. We went down there
 &gt; (from Indianapolis) to get it a couple of months ago only to find it was
 &gt; too big for our trailer. I found a guy there who would put an engine in it
 &gt; for a grand and then the plan was to drive it home.
 &gt; 
 &gt; We made that trip down to get it over this weekend. The engine was in.
 &gt; It was supposedly ready for travel. My friend Rich Smith and I drove
 &gt; down in his Vanagon to get it. We drove off and drove it around town for
 &gt; awhile to see how it was doing. It was missing out a little and had no
 &gt; brakes. The right real wheel was smoking. It went back to the repair guy
 &gt; and he rebuilt the rear wheel cylinders. By this time it had quit
 &gt; missing out. Some junk in the fuel lines I assume. It had been sitting
 &gt; for almost 5 years, on an island on the Atlantic Ocean. We took off
 &gt; again and drove a hundred miles or so to a rest stop in South Carolina
 &gt; for some shut eye. They have way too many lights in those parks. I don't
 &gt; have curtains, or even tinted windows. But I managed. The next morning
 &gt; it wouldn't start. The starter is FUBAR. We pushed it and got it going.
 &gt; It drove like a champ. I was cruising at around 70 most of the way back.
 &gt; Rides well, handles well. We made it to about an hour south of
 &gt; Louisville KY. It crapped out. Figuring it had a clogged fuel filter we
 &gt; changed it. Sure enough a lot of black flakes and shit came out of the
 &gt; spent filter. After changing the filter, it started up but wouldn't run
 &gt; past idle. Pulled the hose from the tank and the gas just trickled out.
 &gt; Something is clogging up the tank. It has been sitting for a very long
 &gt; time. Who knows what could be growing in there.
 &gt; 
 &gt; So it rode the last two hundred miles on the back of a tow truck. Gotta
 &gt; love that AAA Plus!!  So it's home now! Mission accomplished. Now I need
 &gt; ideas on how to get the tank out, and what the hell to do with it when
 &gt; it's out. The Bentley manual is pretty vague on the subject. It just says
 &gt; remove the hoses and remove the tank. Any ideas?
 &gt; 
 &gt; I wanted to put in a plug for the guy that worked on it in Charleston.
 &gt; It's a beautiful installation job. Everything looks great. He took as
 &gt; much time to do it right if I had done it myself. If you are ever in the
 &gt; area and need any VW work done, or just want to chat about them, please
 &gt; call him. You won't be disappointed. Here's the poop:
