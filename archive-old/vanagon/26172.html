&gt; I had that pipe pop out of a Weber 32/36 progressive in a '69 bus, many

&gt; mentioned it on this list, and someone said that this was a common problem
&gt; with Weber carbs on many different cars.

that was me &lt;blush&gt;.  the permanent fix is to install tap threads 
into the carb body and install a threaded hose barb.  maybe J-B Weld 
it??  hardware stores sell a plethora of brass threaded hose barbs, 
the aftermarket one i'd had for a weber was aluminum.
