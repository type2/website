not a sticky steering wheel... that's a personal problem.

On my '87, i have found the sticky feel to the on-center position was the
u-joints that connect the wheel motion to the rack.  one in particular, the
forwardmost one, is subject to road spray.  i obtained a little relief by
squirting penetrating oil up under the grease cover on the joint.  best
course would be to replace the joint.

it should be a fairly universal (ha!  get it? universal joint?) application
that can be matched up with a spec book at a FLAPS.
