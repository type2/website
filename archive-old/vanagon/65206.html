 &gt; Does this sound right?

Stuck Lifter???  Probably more like a collapsed lifter.  I just had one.  Had
to remove it and prme it like the Bentley manual explained.  I have since
bought several spare lifters and expandable push-rod tubes to be prepared for
the next one.

Eric,  come to think of it, I returned from a trip to retrieve my Vanagon
after having the transmission replaced (Syncro).  It sat for 6 weeks.  The
mechanic friend that was keeping it for me said he started it up for several
short periods but never drove it anywhere.   When I fired it up, there was a
horrible lifter clatter that would not go away.  I can now understand why
Eric said:    &quot; never run any engine for a short distance. Always get the
motor hot.&quot;

Priming the lifter is not difficult with a good vise and a new expandable
push-rod tube.  You have to destroy the existing push-rod tube, so make sure
you have a replacement before you try it.

Scott, I live near you, so e-mail me if you want to talk on the phone about
other possible mechanics or solutions.
