Subject: Eurovans (was RE: 1988 Syncro Pickup)

&gt;well, there is the Winnebago version of the vw eurovan camper ... one model
&gt;made for vw to sell (about $30,000 US) and another version made for
winnebago
&gt;to sell (called the Riata, and it's cost is over $40,000 US). i wonder if
&gt;that's what he's talking about.

No, we were standing right next to a Winnebago Eurovan conversion when he
told us this. We were asking why there was no longer a Westy conversion,
and the DOT issue was his answer.

And something else with regards to Eurovans. He (the dealer) said that big
high mucky mucks from VW corporate (Germany) had been there (Carter VW in
Seattle) to discuss future product plans. One thing they mentioned was the
possiblity of a Syncro Eurovan for 96. While I doubt that I'll be in the
market for one (too mini-van like, yet too big for me), I'm sure this will
tantalize some readers.
