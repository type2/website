As to the sleeping in campers thread, here's something I haven't seen
yet. In my '67, I always sleep with my head to the back, mostly for
reasons of weight distribution. The top half of your body is a lot
heavier than the bottom half, so I always want that weight resting
securely on the metal hump, instead of the
somewhat-sketchy-for-lotsa-weight fold out bed.
Just my thoughts...
Richard
