&gt; Subject:       My Sliding door does not open?

&gt; Hi folks, I'm havingt trouble opening my sliding door! It seem that the
&gt; little wheel on the outside of the van is not running along the track like
&gt; it should. When I try to open the door the wheel falls of the track on the
&gt; inside side? Kinda a weird to explain. It seems to be very lose. I tryed to
&gt; take the panel off but it seems that u have to do more than take the two
&gt; screews off??? Can anyone help me with this.
&gt; 
&gt; Ps I hope I don't have to take the door off to replace that slider wheel?:(
&gt; 
&gt; 85 panel camper
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 

The top edge of the panel sits in a U shaped channel together with a  
weather strip.  It's a tight fit!  Before trying to remove it spray 
some WD40 or equivalent along the top edge then _hit_ the panel  
upwards with the palm of your hand (suitably protected with a cloth 
or such!) starting with the rearmost end.  Should come out.

Taking the sliding door out is not quite so bad as it seems - from 
the end of  '84 (September?) this was made easier. :-).   It does 
however rely on being able to move the door backwards! :-(

There is a cut out in the top edge of the track exposed by removing 
the panel.  This allows the problematic wheel to be removed from the 
track (or put back into it?).  Allign the wheel with the cut out and 
lift a little - it should be possible to 'wiggle'  the ruuner away 
whilst someone else supports the weight of the door.  With this back 
edge now free, move the door completely backwards until the topmost 
runner in the door opening can be released from its track.  Lastly 
swing the door outwards allowing the lower runner to be removed from 
the cutout in the bottom track in the lower rearmost corner of the 
door opening.

Hope that makes sense, &amp; HTH
