Ditto - this works great for me, almost like a newsgroup (yes Gerry I know IT'S NOT A NEWGROUP AND IT NEVER WILL BE ONE.) I've been =

Man, I can't tell you how much! Skip, please don't ever go on vacation, get sick or die.  My lifeline to the VW universe runs throug=

So, if you've got a Web connection you needn't suffer CCIBS (Constantly-Clogged In-Box Syndrome) any more - just set a bookmark on h=
