Well, I may have solved my own problem.  Yesterday i took out the fridge
--AGAIN-- it was raining here and I could not work on the house siding job
that pays -- so..... I found a &quot;new&quot; problem that I had not see
previously.  The air pump was not working for two reasons: one the rubber
seal in the pump itself seem to have colapsed enough to not pump any air
and two, the metal pipe to the combustion vent chamber was blocked solid. 
I repaired to rubber seal and blew compressed air through the blocked tube
and the frige lite up each and every time I tried it for a coupe of hours
--out of the van --  so... I put it back in the van... and it worked
alright for a few hours, starting that is.  It started each and every time
I tried for a few hours.  So.... I figured it was solved the fridge
problem....NOT.... After super I went out to try it again and had a bitch
of a time starting it.  It needed to be air pumped A LOT to get it to
lite, but it finally did lite after pumping and liting a zillion times. 
It seems to me that it starves for fresh air at ther start-up, but once
lite it seems to be OK.  For some reason the air pump still does't deliver
enough air to the combustion chamber at start-up.  I will try the
compressed-air-up-the-drain-pipe-trick today and see what that does.
Maybe I should get it lite and just leave it on all the time. {:-)

Cheers,

Frank
