Item Subject: Ultimate Vanagon Bra
      I to am interested in a Bra.  However from my previous experience 
     with these accessories, I remain skeptical of there usefulness.  They 
     protect the car from rock chips but they tend to either discolor the 
     paint from moisture trapped in them or dull the paint from dirt 
     trapped in them.  Any experience/comments on all of the above.

Vince,
'85 VW GL Westy
'90 Mit. Eclipse GSX (With scratches on the nose from the bra I used to use)

Hi Everyone,
     
After completing the not so epic North American Circle Tour 
(NACT) this year, I've decided to make a number of 
improvements to my '83 diesel Vanagon Westy (watercooled).   I 
logged close to 4,000 of the 27,000 miles on unimproved gravel 
roads, and my front end took a beating.  The next 2 years travels 
in Baja and Mexico will udoubtedly take me on many more of 
these roads so I am now looking for the ultimate front end 
protection - the ultimate bra.  
     
I'm wondering what companies make them, how well they fit, 
quality etc and what other volks opinions are.  I looked for one 
before leaving on NACT, but had no luck finding the right thing.  
My westy is watercooled so I have the 2 grills and the single 
round headlights.  I am also wondering if anyone knows of, or 
has seen a brush guard for a vanagon, something suitable for 
pushing those old land rovers out of the way ;-).
