Congratulations! Welcome to automotive hell!  Just kidding, I have a '80
Westfalia, the camper version of your van.  I'll be glad to help anyway I
can, we need to stick together!   You should subscribe to the vanagon list,
it is very helpful, especially if you're new to VW's.  I'm an ASE master
tech, and I still learn something now and then.  Besides, you can't beat the
wealth of experience of several hundred occasionally befuddled vanagon
owners.! Try sending a message with nothing in the subject to
&quot;vanagon_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu&quot;  in the text box type subscribe vanagon list
&quot;your name&quot;  That should get you on their mailing list, if not, let me know
and I really find out how to do it.  (ie not from memory)  good luck, patrick
