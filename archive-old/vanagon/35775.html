Sean,

The fuse problem you experienced is a perfect example of why you should be
using Buss GBC-type fuses (ie, GBC-8 &amp; GBC-18)

If your FLAPS doesn't have them/won't carry them, and if their minimum order
is something ridiculous, you'l need to get on to the Bussmann Division of
Cooper Industries, headquartered n St. Louis, MO.  Their probably on the web
but I don't have an address, although I'm sure the Thomas Register will list
Cooper Industries.

I've mentioned GBC's several times in previous posts and several have told me
their FLAPS refuses to carry them, selling instead the cheaper and more prone
to fail VW types.

Note to ALL:

GBC-type fuses fit VW fuse blocks.
