Joshua,

My dad used to carry a 17' Grummon canoe on the top of his '66
Micro Bus.  He devised this cool pivoting thingamajig that went
on one of the two racks on the room which let one person easily
load it up there. 

The canoe made it out on the highway some pretty long distances, 
the longest when we moved from Flagstaff, AZ to Bryan, TX.

Makes the high wind situations, which are always exciting in a 
microbus, even more so!
