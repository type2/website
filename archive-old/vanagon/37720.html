Subject: Jakin &amp; Moselle, RIP

Day before yesterday, the guy who bought Moselle (61 rustbucket exstandard
micro turned hippy camper with psychedelic paint job) from the guy who bought
it from my friend who had it for years somehow managed to destroy it and
himself.  :(

the bus was turned on itsside and he flew out and hit his head on a tree.  i
saw the bus and it was very mangled in front.   i think it must have slid
into something.  No other vehicle was involved, and no one was around at the
time.  I didn't know Jakin very well, but bummer.  I hope he's in a better
place.

Sorry to be depressing.  It kinda bugs me out.  i drove to B.C.  and Zion
nat'l park, and Dead shows in Vegas and Sacramento,  and through the so cal
desert back roads, and off road in that bus.  (why do people lower buses?
  how do they ford creeks like that?)  I saw the transmission get welded to
the spring plates.   The motor that was in it I drive around on in my bug.

Mike had got it from a guy who had bought it from a junkyard, and then he
resurrected it.  he traded a 58 panel body and some parts, and got Moselle
and a full length roof rack and some other parts.

well, that makes me feel a bit better to say that.   Be safe.

Clara
