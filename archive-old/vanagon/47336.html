&gt;So I fill the empty resrvoir (the main one you fill behind the license plate

&gt;the thermostat will open up the  valeve and coolant will start to flow. But
&gt;after a few minutes of running, I see the heat start to creep up slowly, but
&gt;steadily towards the top of the indicator, and I shut things down for fear
&gt;of a seziure (probably paranoia, but I ain't taking chances!!).

I had a problem with my 86 not taking coolant from the overflow tank.  I
found that the valve in the cap of the coolant tank (drivers side rear) was
not opening.  I put in a new cap and the problem of low coolant went away.
Maybe this helps.
