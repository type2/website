Subject: Re: A Freindly Wave

On the subject of waving vanagons, here's what I've noticed as I tool
around town in my '62:

vanagon drivers over a certain age will always wave,
under will not.

My theory is that old vgon drivers used to have buses, are are fondly
remembering them (at the same time they are blessing their functioning
heating systems).

Anyone else notice this?
