&gt;Old buddy (wholesale) price: $30!!  Of course, they have to 
&gt;order them, but big whoop (local dealer didn't have 'em in 
&gt;stock neither.)  Two new rotors and pads for less than $100.  
&gt;Larry kicks in another $30 for goodwill, installs new brakes, 
&gt;satisfaction achieved.  Dealer rip-off thwarted.

Not dealer rippoff, VW RIP-OFF.  No wonder they can't sell thier cars.  This
rotr should cost less than normal Vangon, no bearing hub.  Why does it cost
more at the dealer?  I do however recomend buying pads and shoes at the
dealer. Or try to find Repco Metal Masters.  Make sure pad you use has
friction rating of FF.  EE is long life, but not enough friction.  Also warps
rotors.
