Subject: Personalized License Plates

Howdy!
AS it is Friday, and I got back from an actually pleasant visit at the DMV, I
thought I'd bring up the thread on personalized license plates, specifically
those relating to VW's. You can gain a lot of insight into folks from their
plates, even from the fact that they went to the trouble of getting one...
Anyway, my old one was:

OLDNDWAY
and the new one is
NFA 4295  (a &quot;stealth&quot; hippie plate so as to avoid a bit of hassle)

Poor Richard

 &quot;I spend half my life explaining to Christians why I'm a Deadhead,
 and the other half explaining to Deadheads why I'm a Christian.&quot;
