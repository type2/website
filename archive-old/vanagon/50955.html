&gt; Hello,
&gt;         Just found this site, Kelly Blue Book. It will value your used car,
&gt; &quot;trade in price&quot;. Neat.

I got this response from the Blue Book for NY state (the closest to my
place in Canada):

VW VAN GL CAMPER,4 Cylinder Gas,5 Speed Manual,70000 miles,4WD
Syncro,AM/FM Stereo 
Price $14875

I paid $Cdn9000 ($US6750) this year and added $Cdn2000 ($US1500) to make
it right. That's a total of $US8250.
I think their $14875 is inflated. What do you think is a fair average
price?
