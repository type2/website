Subject: Ideas on my '67 microbus??
Date: Sun, 10 Dec 1995 22:58:50 -0500

Well, this may not be the right place to be asking, but I'll try =
anyways. I recently bought a 1967 VW Microbus in unbelievably excellent =
condition. The amount of surface rust is close to none and the interior =
is mint and original. It has the original paint job- Off white with the =
stripe and nose brown(?). It has an ice box as well as a pumpable sink =
(water tank) which we have already repaired. One thing that doesn't work =
is the windshield wiper squirter which we have to get fixed. Another =
cool thing that came with it is the original roof rack. It's pretty =
covered with rust but when we fix it, it'll look great. We were informed =
by a skilled (i guess) VW guy that the clamps which affix the rack to =
the roof of the bus are worth A LOT (like $300 or $400 for all 4 =
clamps!). I guess this is because they aren't manufactured anymore and =
are in demand. Anyways, I'm trying to figure out how I'd like to paint =
it. I've seen some cool pictures of microbuses painted dark or light =
blue with the white nose and stripe and I have found this to look quite =
nice. I think I got the car for a good deal (about $3500). Let me know =
what you think about it or what I should do with it. It drives great, I =
must say. I mean, the steering is a little loose, which hopefully we can =
fix, and the shifting is alright- just a little bouncy. But for the most =
part, it can really drive. The max speed that we've taken it to is about =
55 mph, but if you drive it for a while, i'd bet it could go 60. Well, =
enough of my blabbing. Any thoughts are appreciated. Thanks!
