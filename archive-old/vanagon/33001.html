Subject: Idiot factor (was: Not overheating Kombi &amp; holidays)


&gt;The idiot factor arises when you do something which you ought not to
&gt;do because you know better.
&gt;
&gt;The idiot factor causes you to do such things as put your distributor
&gt;rotor on 180 degrees out so your motor doesn't start 'til your mechanic
&gt;drives out to your house to tell you. It also causes you to catch your
&gt;accelarator cable between your engine and gearbox everytime you reinstall
&gt;your engine, resulting in you having to undo the engine bolts to get it
&gt;out. It causes you to connect the positive wire to the earth terminal on
&gt;you new VDO temp guage so that the guage doesn't work until your mechanic
&gt;checks it and tells you about it.


My own two personal favorites:

1.) Leaving the rotor out of the distributor after a tune-up or inspection,
and then riding your bicycle for a week while wondering why the car won't
start;

2.) Leaving the clutch plate out while installing the pressure plate,
and going through the entire engine-installation procedure only to find
that the car runs fine but won't go anywhere. Even after you find the new
clutch plate on your workbench, you still aren't sure you should pull the
engine again, because you couldn't possibly have been THAT stupid.


I've done #1 many times, once with a friend's car as she looked on. Haven't
managed #2 yet, but only because a friend told me about doing it himself,
and I've never forgotten it. But hey, the night is young...
