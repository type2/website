Subject: Bus Door Rubber Install, Part I
Date: Sat, 14 Oct 1995 21:32:39 -0700 (PDT)


Last night, I got the rubber around the door installed.  A lot harder
than it looks, if you do it the way I did.

ya see, the sum total of the lengths of rubber add up to more than the
perimiter of the door. And since this is expensive rubber, I didn't want
to cut it.

it will all fit if you scrunch it up a little.  It manages to even itself
out before the glue dries.

I'm using DAP Weldwood contact cement.  Sticky, yet forgiving.

Next I gotta finish cleaning the frames, paint them, and install the new
rubber.
