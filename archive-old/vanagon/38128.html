Subject: Re:Spotted EV Camper in Key West

Hi Jeff.  We could still get the Eurovan Westy (full camper) in 
Canada for the 1995 model year.  The last were sold last fall here in 
BC.  From now on, it's the Winnie.  There are no more plans to 
export the Westfalia conversion from Germany to North America. 
 Pitty. :(  The EV Westy was available from 1992 to 1995 model years 
inclusive in Canada.  

Harry.

&gt; When I was camping inthe Keys I saw a white EV Camper.  it had all of the
&gt; exterior hookups and had a real nice gray granite looking cabnit, sink,etc.
&gt; Does anyone know if they are going to produce any more EV Westfalias.  I am
&gt; thinking about either selling my 89 Westy or trading it in on a new one
&gt; later on.
