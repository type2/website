Subject: '71 bus, distrib. shaft endplay
Date: Fri, 18 Aug 1995 20:43:52 -0400 (EDT)

Hi y'all,

Like a good boy I checked the end play of the distr. shaft driver at the 
very bottom, under the two shims.  It's a VERY large gap...about .065&quot; 
instead of the .02&quot; that the manual and Veeduber Bob recommend.  No 
problem, I'll just get another shim or two. Call the best parts store in 
town,  the guy has always know his stuff.  Never heard of them.  What do 
you call them?  The three manuals I use call them washers, dist shaft 
thrust washers, and dist shaft shims.  Still never heard of them and I'm 
a dumbass for thinking they exist.  I call  the best and biggest foreign 
repair shop.  'Russ' has built over '500' engines.  NEVER has used extra 
shims!  There's a lip around the seat where the shims/washers sat, so I 
can tell it worn down a lot.  Has ANYBODY used extra shims?  This is 
becoming the engine from HELL! :-(( I gotta get this thing running 
yesterday!  Thanks for past and future help and input!

Mitch
