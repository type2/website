Reply to:
&lt;Has any other Eurovan owner received a letter, announcing The Eurovan Update
&lt;newsletter from a company identifying itself as HP Products.

&lt;I was just wondering if anyone else know anything about this newsletter.

I haven't heard anything about the newsletter. But I bought mine used so I
may not have made the mailing list. If the newsletter is worthwhile let me
know. Thanks!
