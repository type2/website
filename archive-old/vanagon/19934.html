    &gt; The bribes were all legal, of course -- campaign contributions and
    &gt; the like.

To quote (from memory) Barney Frank,
the finest wit in the House and a
great afflictor of the comfortable:

&quot;Giving money to Congress is like hunting;
 in season we call it a campaign contribution,
 out of season we call it a bribe.&quot;
