Subject: Re: Engine Life

This might be an old thread, but what's the longest mileage I should expect
from my wasserboxer motor?. This is before replacing cyls/pistons/bearings 
during a major rebuild. All this talk of engine swapping makes me wonder 
when my box is going to heave its last gasp! It is running fine, no asthma etc.
         So.. who holds the record for highest mileage H2O boxer?. I'm at 
157,000Km, about 100,000 miles, a mere pup? (he says hopefully)    tjs
