Subject: So much love.......

Listers:

Having lurked about on this list for some time and never posted, I 
now feel I must let my true feelings out.  I love you guys, man!  
Thanks to all of your expostulations, I have been soaking up 
information like a sponge.  I wish to thank Bob Hoover in particular: 
I will be your disciple!

Now let's dig into the meat:  I've got a '79 camper.  Apparently 
retrofitted with much stuff('fridge, many cabinets, beds), but not by Westfailia.  I have a 
permanently extended pop top that is supposed to sleep two people 
towards the rear of the bus and abovc the cab is an interior storage 
space.  Now what do I call it?  I mean it's not a Westy, so what is 
it, besides really cool?

Next portion:  GEX is a good company.  My last engine died on the 
freeway(it was about 10 mo. old from GEX--maybe 15K).  Had the van towed to 
Small Car Performance in Tacoma.  Don the shop guy called GEX and 
they talked about things unbeknownst to me.  End result:  GEX fired 
me off a fresh engine (same as the old one--2.0L), and are paying for 
1/2 the labor and all parts.  This is OK with me.  Of course the end 
result of all this is that I scored a Muir book and am considering a 
Bentley book as well for as many maintenance/repairs as I can do 
myself.  I got the Muir book on-line from Amazon_dot_com:
http://Amazon_dot_com
I'll most likely score the Bentley there too.  They have a truly 
amazing amount of books available.

Lastly:  Being (fairly) newly transplanted to Tacoma, any surfers 
(real, as in ocean, not virtual) on the list_and_in Tacoma, feel free 
to drop me a line and maybe we can hook it up for a session, eh?

The end,
