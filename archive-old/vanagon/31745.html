I have a question regarding my starter.  When I do some long distance 
highway driving and shut off the van, my starter turns but does not 
engage with the fly wheel. In order for me to get going again, I have to 
go under it and lightly hammer the starter.  It was fine last week when I 
was in Orlando and in the 60's but now I am back in Albany, NY and in the 
teen's with a snow storm coming.  This is was a problem this past summer 
and this looser VW mechanic supposedly took care of it.  Any answers 
before I break my New Year's resolution of being more thrifty and end up 
in a VW Dealer!!!!!!

Also, I have a broken engine mount.  Would that pull the starter out of 
place?
