&gt;Now that I know you mean the idiot lights, I can say that this is perfectly 
&gt;normal.  The alternator doesn't self excite from residual magnetism till 
&gt;about 1000 rpm or so.  So, the idiot lights light until you exceed that rpm 
&gt;once.  Not to worry.

You may have missed the gist of what went on here.  The original post said
something like: &quot;my wife was driving along and the alt &amp; oxs lights came on&quot;.
 This is definitely not normal.
