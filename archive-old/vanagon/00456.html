&gt; anybody else keep track of their mileage? anybody anywhere close to being as
&gt; anal-retentive? :)

I track mine with the old &quot;record the mileage and gallons and calculate the 
mpg&quot; routine.  I average 18-19 mpg all around.  22 mpg on the highway and 16 
- 17 city.  I'd like to have the mpg computer, but I'm too lazy to put it
in. ;)   I do keep my tires inflated correctly though.
