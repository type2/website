&gt;Dictionary of Terms          from the Bus/Vanagon List
&gt;&lt;all years are by definition for U.S. Models. European, Canadian, and
&gt;Australian years and models may vary slightly&gt;

&gt;** Bus Terminology **
&gt;--------------------------------------

Another term to add would be:

BARNDOOR:

Busses made before mid-'55, whose major characteristics are the oversize
engine lid and lack of a rear hatch.  These also did not have the 
ventilation eyebrow above the windshield/windscreen.

AMBULANCE:

Special model of the bus, based on the Standard bus, first available in
'51 (according to my source) whose most notable feature was the smaller
engine lid than the barndoor, although they began production in the
barndoor era, and the rear hatch hinged from the _bottom_.  The gas
tank and spare tire were moved in order to accomodate the rear hatch.
