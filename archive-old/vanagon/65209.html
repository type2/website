My fridge is stuck!


Not wanting to be left out, I decided to pull my fridge and see why it will
not work on propane, and why the fan I hear about never seems to run. But my
plans were foiled when I discovered I can't get the fridge out of the
cabinent. Yes, all gas and electric lines are free, the door and trim panel
removed, and the vent removed from the side of the van. The fridge refuses to
budge in any direction. Up, left, right, forward.

Any tips from the Domestic 182B sages out there?
I was thinking that plastic explosives might help....&lt;g&gt;

Thanks
