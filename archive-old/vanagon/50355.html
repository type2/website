Subject: KYB shock install

Volks,

A few days ago my order from RMMW works arrived, which consisted of a pair
of KYB Gas-A-Just front shocks and a VDO volt gauge.  Total with shipping
was $90, which I thought was pretty decent.  The order arrived correct and
on time as well.  So far I am 100% satisfied with RMMW, and I would
recommend them to others.

Two nights ago I installed the shocks.  Real easy installation, two bolts
on each side.  Rolled the front of the bus up onto ramps to make it easier
to access.  Took about 30 minutes total, I think.  Old Sears gas shocks
went straight into the trash.

Back on the road, I notice I can feel the bumps a little more now, but it's
not annoying.  Still a comfortable ride.  I was a little worried at first
after reading Sami's story of a bone-jarring ride with his KYB's.  I
couldn't tell a whole lot of difference in the way the bus handled - low
speed cornering seems a little flatter, but freeway lane changes seem about
the same, just a little &quot;twitchier&quot;, I guess.

Overall, the difference isn't as great as I thought it was going to be, and
if I had it to do over again, I might have waited a little longer before
spending the $65.  They are, however, the first pair of front shocks that
have made *any* difference in the way the van felt.  The Sears shocks were
installed new about three years ago, and I couldn't tell any difference at
all.

So why are they called Gas-A-Just?  I couldn't find any mention on the
shocks or instructions about adjusting them.  Does anyone know if they are
even adjustable?  The Koni shocks on the mustang are adjustable by pressing
the shock all the way down and turning the upper part.  I tried this with
the KYBs but couldn't tell whether or not it was doing anything.  Anyone
know?
