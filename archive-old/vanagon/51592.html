Subject: Re: Keep me from blowing myself up!

&gt; Hey all,
&gt; OK, here's the situation:  '81 Westy, leaky propane knob on tank.  This
&gt; is the knob on the tank that you use to turn on the gas.  When this knob
&gt; is turned on, it leaks propane (loud hissing).  Obviously, this is
&gt; undesirable behavior.  I have obtained a rebuild kit from Ron Salmon for
&gt; this valve, now all I need to know is how the heck to do it.  How do I
&gt; get this valve apart?  Would it be easier to do if I remove the tank
&gt; from the van?  What should I do about the propane that's already in
&gt; there (I don't like venting it to the atmosphere, I can see someone
&gt; tossing a cigarette my way...)?  Do the propane fill places have the
&gt; capability to recover propane from a tank?  If anyone can give me
&gt; specific directions as to how to go about rebuilding this valve (I'm
&gt; having a very hard time visualizing it as I've never done anything like
&gt; this before) I'd really appreciate it.
&gt; 
I would definitely remove the tank - it's easy to do &amp; makes things 
easier to get at. You only need to remove two of the four nuts 
holding the tank, then loosen the other two &amp; drop it down. (after 
removing the two gas lines at the regulator of course). Not sure 
about recovery, since I did mine when it was empty. If you can get 
the right adapters, most of the gas could be transferred to a 20lb 
bbq tank. You can pour it in by holding one tank higher than the 
other.
