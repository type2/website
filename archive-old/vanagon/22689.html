Yo,

	Well, I had quite the VW weekend:

	Friday:   Helped a friend of mine debug his sandrail's ignition
                  Turns out one or more spark plug wires were grounding.
                  When it got dark, we could see sparks jumping from the
                  heater opening plug to the fan shroud!

        Saturday: replaced the muffler on the bus and made the horrific
                  discovery of parts I destroyed.  Helped a friend down 
                  the street replace the back brakes on his '63 bus.
                  Sold my old muffler and header for $10 to another kid
                  who is re-creating a '67 camper.

	Sunday:   Put new hubcap clips on my set of wheels that I'm going
                  to paint for the bus.  Helped bus-friend put stereo in
                  his bus and showed him some of the bad things that were
                  done when the PO converted his bus to 12V.  He still
                  has the 6V starter and 6V wipers, both of which go crazy
                  when he uses them!  Oye!

See?  I've been good!  Now won't somebody leave a barndoor deluxe in
my driveway?

Now, on to GOOD TIMES!

My boss just bought a book called &quot;Building a Unix Internet Server&quot; and 
gave it to me to browse thru.  In the chaper related to security, at the
very end, it states:  (with all seriousness, I might add)

&quot;The 'Good Times' virus, for example, erases your hard disk and damages your
CPU.&quot;

I guess if a rumor goes around enuf times it becomes true! :)
