I have a question about electronic ignition.  I understand the benefit
derived from these in terms of better spark throughout the rpm range. 
Better being stronger and more even.  Now, besides the obivious of not
having to set points, would I get the same increase in spark benefit 
from a motor that will hopefully never be run much over 4,400 rpm?  
Will the stock system provide an even enough spark in that rpm range? 
I am thinking an 009 and a tach might be all the ignition I need.  
This would be the same stock 1600DP with dual kadrons, extractor and 
SINGLE springs.  Thanks, Jim
