Hello everyone,

Since the logistics of purchasing it and getting it back to Seattle, I am 
passing on a '93 Eurovan at a used car dealer outside of Nashville. Letting 
this one go stings a bit because the asking price is about $2000 less than 
EVs around here with twice the mileage.

If anyone is interested in an EV GL with the power group, 5 speed, 25,000 
miles at $13,900, let me know directly and I'll email the HTML document 
with all the particulars.

There will always be another van, there will always be another van.....
