&gt; !!I had also assumed that Kombis had only three of
&gt; _at__at_the square windows along the side, while Microbusses (Deluxe and
&gt; ##otherwise) had four (plus the most excellent corner ones pre-'64).  Ja?
&gt;
&gt; Lessee.  I've got a sliding window on my sliding door, an identical
&gt; sliding window opposite it (behind driver); window further back on
&gt; driver's side has one vent-flap style window, opposite it (behind sliding
&gt; door) has a solid piece of glass.

Unless this was just bait, I think you're a little confused. :)  We were
discussing pre-'68 busses with the square side windows.  Most 'normal' 
busses had 4 or 5 side windows, while Kombis had only 3 (to my knowledge).
