So Cetin Seren says:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;  Does anyone have any first-hand knowledge of incidents where propane
&gt; &gt;  caused a horrendous explosion?  
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; We have owned our Westy for about 8 yrs.  Had no problem with the
&gt; propane tank.  I have often wandered, though, why there are so many
&gt; burned (literally) Westfalias in the local junkyard (sorry, I forgot
&gt; I need to use the politically correct term), er, I mean, the local
&gt; parts recycling yard.
&gt; 

The reasons as for most cars is negligence of the fuel system.  Hoses
wear out and if they are ignored and not replaced with the appropriate 
equivalent, then they leak and eventually the vapors or raw fuel catches 
fire from heat or spark.  This is not exclusive to campers or VW for that 
matter.
