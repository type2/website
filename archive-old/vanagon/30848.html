Subject: Where to find radio schematics?

I picked up a radio at the junkyard a couple weeks ago - a Saphire IX am/fm. 
 When I tried it I found out that the smoke hasn't escaped, but all the 
music's gone.  Does anyone know where I can find a schematic for this so I 
can find out where to put new music in? :)

Seriously, I called VW-US and they gave me a number for someone, but they 
only had the little operator's leaflets for the radios - not the schematics. 
 I have found a place in Dallas to fix it, but he figures about $70 based on 
my description of the problem.  It might be more worthwhile to just try to 
find another radio.

So, does anyone know where to find schematics for VW radios?  Who really 
made these things anyway (Saphire - who's that?).

TIA,
Dean
