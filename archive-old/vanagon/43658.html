David,

Regarding the lower power output on the TDI....

Remember ALL of the T4 engines, gas &amp; diesel, have lower horsepower outputs 
than the passenger car versions...but have higher torque production, and the 
torque comes in at a lower rpm....I suspect the same is done for the TDI 
engine.

&gt;From what I have been able to figure out from the French brochures is that 
the 2.4L 5 cylinder diesel unit is being aimed at the passenger van segment 
of the market, while the turbo diesel version is being aimed at the 
&quot;transporter&quot; or delivery van segment.
