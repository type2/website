&gt; Subject: FS: 1973 VW Campmobile $1500/B.O.

Hmmm...  Guess Patrick's not on the list any more.  Shame to see him sell
that bus, but he isn't gonna get anywhere near $1500 for it with a bad
motor.  Probably $500 or less.  Broken-down busses are a dime a dozen in
his area.

&gt;  First off: one piston has a hole in it, so it needs at least a one-cylinder
&gt;  rebuild (estimate $650); wouldn't hurt to get all four at once (estimate
&gt;  $1000).

He obviously hasn't priced this.  If there is really a hole in the piston,
that means there are bits of metal circulating throughout the motor.  Even
bad mechanics wouldn't just do a top-end rebuild under this condition.  A
total rebuild is necessary.  Minimum $1400 unless he does some of the work
himself.

&gt;  The good news: Just had dual-carb rebuild (This cost me $750) and smog
&gt;  check.  Brakes and clutch replaced 12K miles ago.

I'd love to comment on what he paid for the carb rebuilds, but I won't.

&gt;  This is a bright green number with a pop-top.  It is a Safare Custom Camper
&gt;  conversion, not a Westy, so it has a different setup than you will see
&gt;  elsewhere.

More than that... I have *never* seen another camper like this.  I've seen
maybe a dozen Safare conversions, and all have been either high roofs, or
normal roofs. This could be the only one of its kind.  I doubt that will
get him any more money for it though.

&gt;  I'll probably end up getting the cylinder rebuild done and then selling it,

I think after he prices that he'll change his mind.  This could be a great
deal for someone wanting a really unique camper, who is willing to get
his/her hands dirty fixing it.  I sure wish a list member would save it!  I
would if I was still in Southern California.
