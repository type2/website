Subject: Re: CV Joints Thrust bearing (Jetta)

     I just dropped my left driveshaft on Sunday to take a look at the wear and 
     repack it while it was out.
     
     No thrust washers were used; I'm not sure what all of the pieces are 
     called(boot, ball bearings, retaining ring, outer and inner 'drive' ring).
     
     Mine had what looks somewhat like Brinelling(sp?) on the inner and outer 
     rings on both the CV joints; additionally there was a lot of wear on the 
     inner ring on the inner CV joint.  This was from the balls and probably 
     occurs on this CV joint due to the fact that it gets most of the punishment 
     form starts and shifts.
     
     Now I have to start looking for some good replacement CV joints...back to 
     the archives.

Hello all,

Finally got around to dropping the right axle on my Jetta due to 
horrible but intermittent CV noise. I haven't checked the Vanagon 
Bentley, and haven't yet done this on my Westy, but do bus type CV's 
use thrust washers? If so, is it common for these to explode? Turns 
out my horrible crunching sound was due to pieces of the washer 
flying around inside the joint! I've done 5-6 CVs on FWD VWs, but 
have never seen this before. What would cause it?
Can these washers be found easily? Since my new lobro joint didn't 
come with them, I'm assuming they're not normally replaced.

I'm hoping this isn't one of those dealer only things...
