Subject: shipping interior question
Date: Tue, 3 Dec 1996 13:40:23 -0500

I need to ship an interior (all seats and panels), does anybody have any
suggestions as to the most economical?? I called Roadway and by the time
trying to figure out some kind of cubic density, it came to like $250!!

Any ideas/suggestions??
