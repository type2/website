Hi Donald.  I had a similar leak in my '90.  It didn't leak to the point of
filling up the step, though.  It turned out to be the vapour barrier that
had come loose from the door.  Once reglued, all's well.

Thx.
Harry

 The step in the passenger side front door on my '85 Vanagon fills up with
 water every time it rains. It never fills up to the level of the carpet,
 and the carpet isn't wet so I don't think it's leaking from the front of
 the car.  The door is not full of water either, at least I don't hear it
 sloshing around when I open the door.  Before I start investigating this
 further, has anyone on the list experienced a similar leak. --
