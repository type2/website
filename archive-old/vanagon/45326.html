Subject: Re: Buying in Germany?

Rich, this is an exercise in futility.  If the Vehicle was not manufactured
specifically for use in the U.S., and bears the appropriate stickers, you
will run into a government nightmare.  You will have to post a cash bond for
the value of the vehicle. Then you have about 90 days to get it tested by a
bonded enviromental laboratory.  This test is not cheap. It seems that it
was over $500 a few years ago.  I spent 8 years in Germany, and really
looked into it.  You have much better luck with vehicles made before 1965.
Sorry, but &quot;Been there, Done that&quot;.

&gt;anyone know what it's like to get one from Germany/Austria in terms of :

&gt;- problems with incompatability of parts, etc. once in USA
&gt;- more availability of 4X4 models in Germany/Austria?
&gt;- other?
&gt;because I have friends in Germany and on the Swiss Austrian border and it
&gt;would be an easy hop up there to get the van.
&gt;
&gt;Any comments or info greatly appreciated.
