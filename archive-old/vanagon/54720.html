Subject: Type2 List T-Shirts!


Okay, I'm getting a lot of questions about the T-shirts so here's the deal:

You can have a look at the artwork for the T-shirts by pointing your
graphical browser to this address:

http://www.mindspring_dot_com/~wjb3/type2_5.gif

The shirts are Haynes BeefyTs. They're black, the better to hide spatters
and smears and filthy patches at the shoulder blades. Hey, we are who we
are. ;)

Sizes L-XL-XXL. I can get other sizes all the way down to toddlers, but the
deal on that is that the printer needs a 50% draw to print them, then the
other 50% on delivery. That means that if you want a size other than
L-XL-XXL you have to order SOON, before your fellows send me enough money
to make the draw, because at that point the order will be finalized and
it'll be too late for other sizes.

These are being printed by Progressive Graphics of Charlotte, which is the
same outfit that did Bob and Richard's superb ACS&amp;R shirts.

UK listees: Bob Wallace &lt;wallace_b_at_IPGATE.sls.co_dot_uk&gt; has graciously offered
to concatenate your Sterling so you don't each have to spend $7 for a check
payable in foreign currency. Get with him about it.

All sizes are gonna run you $17 except XXL, which is two dollars more. It's
the jobber doing that to you big folks, it ain't me--the raw XXL shirts
cost $2 more. Prices include shipping in the US.

For some perspective, consider that I've spent right at $700 on this list
since last July when we started it. No kidding.

Stickers:

The stickers are purple ink over chrome Mylar. The lettering resembles the
T-shirt and is &quot;reversed&quot;, so the stickers look purple while the lettering
looks silver. These have a coating over them to preserve the ink and keep
the chrome from being so glossy that it's obnoxious. Permanent adhesive,
they're designed to be mounted on the exterior lower left corner of your
rear window. Panel drivers will have to improvise.

I said originally that these would be oval like the v_at_l stickers but it
looks like they'll be more circular instead. Take a look at the artwork and
you'll understand why.

Stickers are $2 each, includes shipping in US.

   My ISP dictates that I must use this address: bighouse_at_mphs_dot_com
 My former more elegant address, bighouse_at_socomm_dot_net, still works and
may forever but you should probably use the former. Negotiations continue.
