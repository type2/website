Subject: Does anyone know if VINTAGVW is up?


Not to sound paranoid.....but the last time the listmeister
over there at vintagvw came up with a pronouncement of what
is and what is not proper vw conversation...I found myself
booted off the list...(hey, I admit I am slightly opinionated...)

Well, shortly after yesterday's latest pronouncement all reception
of Vintagvw over here ceased...is it the list...or did I offend
the listgods again?

Inquiringly yours...

Ric
