Subject:      gas leak, type 2 or 4

hello all,

whenever i fill my 1980 westy completely up with gas (the gas tank you =
wise
guys) i get a strong smell of gas outside the van up front.  I crawled =
around
under the van last nigh and noticed some gas around the right front strap=

bolt.  none of the hoses seem to be leaking so i'm thinking it must come =
from
the top of the gas tank, dribble down the front right corner.  this is =
the corner
where the fill tube goes intot the tank.  What's on top of the tank?  =
hole for
sender unit?  could it be the gasket for the sender unit?  remember only =
does
it when tank is completely filled.   use a gallon of gas or so and doesn'=
t leak.
Any tips on pulling the gas tank?

also i am confused about whether my engine is called a type 2 or 4, or =
is my
engine a type 2 and my van a type IV?  i see references of people calling=
 air
cooled vanagons being type 4 yet i thought the engines are very similar =
if not
the same as 78-79 buses which are type 2's.  Can someone clear this up =
for
me.  in muir's book he lists vanagons under type 2's.

thanks
