Subject: WCM Roof Seals (minus the Kool Seal)

Well, last weekend we took the old rubber seals off of Lief's roof.  They 
were still in fair conditions but we wanted to recover the roof with Kool 
Seal and I had already purchased new seals for Fritz (before he had his 
unfortunate accident).

So I scrubbed the roof with a wire brush, nylon scouring pads, and TSP.  
As I look at the hamburger meat that used to be my hands I think that 
maybe it would have been wise to wear gloves.  But it was a warm sunny 
weekend and us Vancouverites lose all use of brain cells when the spring 
sunshine arrives so....

Anyway, it camer pretty clean.  I was surprised because it had really 
looked like crap before (almost completely dark brown and black).  So 
Idecided to put some bleach on it and leave it for an hour or so.  When I 
rinsed it off it was almost completely white!!!  So I just washed it 
again to get rid of any risidual bleach and stood back to admire the 
work.

As a result I decided not to use the Kool Seal because it already looked 
great and I didn't want to risk making it look worse.

On Sunday I put the new seals on.  They work great except that I'm not 
too pleased with the way the flat seal across the top of the poptop meets 
up with the one that goes all the way around (with an alumininum clip in 
it).  The seals that were on there seemed to be one piece or they were 
vulcanized together or something like that.  I guess they were the 
original Westfalia seals???

Anyway, Lief looks great now.  New-looking white roof, new curtains.  As 
soon as I get some pictures taken I'll scan them and put them up on the 
web (wish I had taken before pictures; Doh!).

So if anyone in the Vancouver area wants Kool Seal (2 quarts) and Kool 
Patch Fibreglass (1 roll) and Cement (1 quart), drop me a line.
