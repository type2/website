&gt;&gt;I did not say that it doesn't cool, I said that it wasn't used specifically
&gt;&gt;for cooling.  Lubrication is it's main function.  How could it not help but
&gt;&gt;remove heat from the engine! &gt;&gt;

I believe the oil cooler for air cooled engine is for cooling the oil. The main
purpose is to prevent oxidation and vaporization of the oil. As far as cooling
the engine, it really relies on the cooling air blown by the cooling fan.

Eng temp of an air cooled engine varies a great deal therefore cooling the oil
is necessary. On the other hand, water boxer stays at a narrower temp range
and cooling the oil is therefore not needed.

I think keeping the engine cool really depends on the cooling air. If the
engine is hot, cooling the oil will not bring down the engine temp fast
enough.  If you have a problem on the (air) cooling system, your engine will
overheat no matter how much extra oil cooling capacity you add to your bus.

Again, keeping the engine cool but not too cool is what I believe. Otherwise
you will wear out your cylinders faster.
