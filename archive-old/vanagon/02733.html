Subject: Alloy Wheels

I'd like to get a set of alloy wheels for my '87 Syncro. Called the nearest
dealership and was quoted a price of nearly $400 a wheel.

Needless to say, I ain't buying them.

Our local VW wrecker quoted me $150 a wheel, but the guy said they rarely
get them in stock.

Therefore, I have two questions:

1. Are the alloy wheels used on late model Vanagons all identical, or are
there different sizes for different years, Syncro/non Syncro, etc.?
2. Does anybody know of third party sources for these wheels?

Thanks!

Paul
