Subject: Stupid Vanagon Tricks-Dual Hubcaps!

Hi All,

I impressed myself today with a stupid Vanagon trick.  The GL had some
cheesey FLAPS wheel covers made of low-inpact plastic that were quickly
removed after I took possession of it.  Since I didn't have any other
wheel covers, I ran Bug-type caps which looked ok.  Later I bought my
other 84 Vanagon which came with 3 silver frisbee-type covers.  Still
later I discovered a single frisbee type in the bone yard.  Today I went
out to take off the Bug-type caps and put on the soliver wheel covers and
stopped...  The big silver wheel covers fit right over the Bug-type caps,
so now I'm running 'dual' hubcaps!  I guess this might be the type of
thing Vanagon Listers could appreciate. 8-)
