&gt; &gt;Hi Steve. My wife says I'm supposed to write to you and tell you that
&gt; &gt;you're one of the most level headed folks she's seen on here yet.
&gt; 
&gt; Please give her my compliments, and tell her I applaud her taste in men! 
&gt;  :^)
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;I've been keeping her abreast of the T&amp;A discussion. I can't believe some
&gt; &gt;of these people. I decided it was a little quiet around here and thought
&gt; &gt;I'd spice it up. Well...I think I've succeeded! This is great fun!
&gt; 
&gt; You could try asking (publicly, on the list) what these ladies &quot;charge
&gt; for their services&quot;. After all, someone (you?) pointed out that they are
&gt; professional models who get paid for these pictures.  ;)
&gt; 
&gt; That other guy might sieze upon it as an example of &quot;degradation&quot;!
&gt; 
&gt; Steve
&gt; 
Funny you should mention that. I'm a photographer. I've done a few ad 
layouts using models, men and women. Most of these people can charge 
upwards of a couple hundred bucks an hour if they have the right stuff 
for the particular job. (Much more than the photographer, I might ad!) 
These bikini babes would have to get at least that much, or more. I'd say 
they're being degraded all the way to the bank!
