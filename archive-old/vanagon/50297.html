Jeff &amp; Jean-Marie Diebolt offered a document discussing water cooled Vanagon 
problems.  I'd like to see it.  Is there any way to get it on the WWW?

&gt; Hi to all the Vanagon readers,
&gt;       I've been reading some of the problems being discussed here and
offered
a
&gt; few solutions for some that I was aware of. I spent 12 years working at a
&gt; VW dealer only to move on to a new career about 5 years ago. I own a 1982
&gt; Vanagon diesel and love it. Don't like working on it any more though.
Just
&gt; got done replacing the valves, the timing belt broke, I consider myself
&gt; lucky. The reason I am writing today is to tell you all about a VW
service
&gt; communique that I was able to get from a friend still at the dealership.
It
&gt; deals with drivability problems with water cooled Vanagons. Intermitent
&gt; missing, cutting out, stalling, etc.. I know that allot of the fixes are
&gt; quite expensive, and may not even work as well as some of the ones
&gt; mentioned on this list. I left the dealership before this document came
out
&gt; so I cannot personally vouch for the repairs. I really don't like making
&gt; suggestions from information provided by other people without trying it
out
&gt; for myself. I figure there may be some of you out there that would try
some
&gt; of the items since there are so many reoccurring problems. (i.e. replace
&gt; ECU and air flow sensor and problem comes back) I was told that this
&gt; information is not to be let out to everybody in its original form. So I
&gt; have condensed the information from 12 pages to 5. Four pages are in Word
&gt; format and the fifth page is a test sheet in Excel format. I do not want
to
&gt; flood people with unwanted or unnecessary mail, and I do not know what is
&gt; in the digests. I will happily send the information to anyone who wants
it.
&gt; If enough people request it I will post the five pages.
&gt;       Another quick note. While ordering the parts for my diesel from a
supplier
&gt; that I used to deal with. I asked him if his company does any retail
&gt; business. He said yes so I asked if they stock the water cooled Vanagon
&gt; exhaust parts, they do. I've bought exhaust for my diesel from them and
was
&gt; pleased with both quality and price. The company is New Brighton Imports
