Actually, I'd like to take credit for it myself.  However, to be fair,
my wife who is also becomming a physicist contributed 1/2 to this
(we're going to be the Dr. and Dr.'s Hutton pretty soon, or something like
that).
Anyway, if the group can work out the bugs in this, it will indeed work
nicely.  I only wonder why vw didn't do it?
One note:  the kmart fan has red cloth fan blades.  It will fit there, but
a bit of adjustment in postion will be necessary.
