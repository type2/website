Subject: RE: Conversions and fresh meat! :)

Tom Carrington's plan to build a Vanagon-engine-conversion web site got
me motivated to make a couple of photos (of Porsche six in Vanagon)
available.  Look for them at http://partner22.njit_dot_edu/toybox/toybox.htm
but don't count on their staying there as the site only really exists
to serve the WebMaster course we are teaching.  Tom, and others, please
feel free to download them and include them in other material.  Just
associate my email address (kennedy_at_admin.njit_dot_edu) with them so that if
people have questions they know where to ask.
