&gt;Experienced has shown the members of this list that GEX may not be
&gt;the best choice.  Have you looked at Berg, Bergmann, Scat, Pauter, or
&gt;even MOFOCO?  The first four are really good, and the last one may be
&gt;good, but there have been less serious complaints from them then from
&gt;GEX.  There is also many other companies out there, members on the
&gt;list have a list as long as your arm with whom they have had success
&gt;with new and rebuilt engines.

I recently purcahsed a 2.0 liter engine for a Vanagon from GEX.  Upon leak
testing the engine before instalation I found the #2 exhaust valave to be
leakng.  I called GEX and explained my tale of woe, They over nighted a
repalcement head to me and I receved it the next day.  I installed the head
and it was all better. I also spoke to GEX regarding the hardware that was
used to mount the heads as I had a concern about the quality.  They asured me
that future hrdware will be the factory eqiuvelent.  Due to welding and other
work that is done to VW heads,  I strongly recomend that no matter who you
get an engine from, you shaould ask about new heads.  Especially type one
engines.  I understand that new heads are not available for type four and the
re-pop Vanagon heads have been nightmares in my experience.  Especially with
valave seats popping out.  This leaves most rebuilt vanagon/Bus engines to
have welded heads and the problems that go with them.  Although I hate using
warranties,  Gex is the only company I know of that offers to pay labor for
repair work when neccasary.  There is some value added here.
