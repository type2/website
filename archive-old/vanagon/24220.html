&gt; L82 &quot;Silver White&quot; is typically used only on the bumpers, wheels, and where

&gt; &quot;Pearl White.&quot; The &quot;Silver White&quot; has a very, very slight bluish hue to it.

Would you happen to have a formula for the L87 &quot;Pearl White&quot;?  I have a 
'66 Bus that I am resotring and want to paint the top half L87.

I also am trying to find out what the VW dark green was called.  I have 
seen it in several old advertisements from VW but only on bugs.  I want 
to use this green for the lower half.

Any insight would be greatly appreciated!
