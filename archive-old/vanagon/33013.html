Subject: Re: Question: CB Radio Interferance

&gt;I installed an old Realistic 40 channel CB yesterday. When the engine's
&gt;running, I notice a lot of interference...engine noise. I recall years
&gt;back using &quot;resistor plugs&quot; to eliminate this in another vehicle. Is the
&gt;same approach appropriate, or is some other technique required. Your help
&gt;appreciated.

Joe:

There are a number of electronic noise filters on the market.  You should
actually be able to get one at Radio Smak... hold on while I go get the
catalog...


Ah here we go...1996 cat, page 173...(it's Martin Luther King Day, can you
tell I've got some spare time..?)

20amp noise filter.  Heavy duty design for extra suppression of alternator
and ignition noise. $19.99.

If you don't like Radio Smak, then Jacobs Electronics out here in Texas has
some filters.  1-800 627 8800, part no 510050, electronic noise breaker,
available in many different sizes (for amp ratings).

Good luck!

Johnny
