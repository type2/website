&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Hello,
&gt; 
&gt; My name is Lee Ann (borrowing my boyfriends E-Mail account).
&gt; SHHHHHHHHH.

Sean doesn't know anything anyway.... ;)

&gt; 
&gt; I'm new to E-Mail so please be gentle.

Doh!

&gt; 
&gt; I have just bought a 1969 Campingmobile, at least thats what the guy I 
&gt; bought it from called it.
&gt; &gt;From what I understand it is the year before the Westfalia came out.

There are probably some stamps on the vehicle that will tell you what
year it is.  Check around the driver door frame.  Also, it should be
on the pink slip or registration.  

&gt;   
&gt; My boyfriend and I are planning a cross country trip in December.
&gt; We live in Vermont and will head south to Key West up through Louisiana, 
&gt; Texas, The Grand Canyon, over to Los Angeles, San Francisco and up to 
&gt; Vancouver. We don't have any time table so we can take our time.

Must be nice.  My wife and I had only two weeks.  Gawd, I wish we could
do a trip like yours.  BUT I'M NOT JEALOUS!!!!   ;)

&gt; I'm assuming that a lot of the readers of this net have done long trips 
&gt; in their buses and can offer some sound advise as to what to take along.
&gt; as far as provisions, tools, clothes, food, pots &amp; pans dishes etc.

Ahh... I get to post my essential tools list again and lest I forget (cause
some rude humanoids will remind me :P ) you should obtain a copy of the
&quot;How To Keep Your Volkswagon Alive!&quot; manual by John Muir (moment of silence,
please) which is affectionately referred to as the &quot;Idiot Guide&quot; in this
group.  You should read through this manual at your leisure and use it
as a reference for on-the-road help.  Another good manual is the Bentley
for your year vehicle.  Great illustrations and technical info.  Both
books are well worth the money.

And without further adieu, here his my generic list of essentials for
traveling on long trips or any trips for that matter:


Jumper Cables - Don't leave home without em'.
Sockett Set  - Misc. bolt tightening.
Wrench set  - Misc. bolt tightening.
pliers and crecent wrench  -  Various tighting/bending jobs.
Screwdrives flat &amp; phillips &amp; allen - tighting misc. screws.
Duct Tape - Broken radiator hose.
electrical tape - Ad hoc wire fixing.
wheel bearing grease - Various wheel maintenance
brake fluid  - Low brake fluid.
matches/lighter - If its cold and you need a light.
toilet paper - Need you ask?
spare auto wire - For testing or replacement.
Wire cutters/strippers for wire.
Rope  -  Emergency pulling, holding up things etc.
walking shoes  -  It could be a long walk.
hat - Keeps the rain or sun off when your walking.
Jacket  -  It gets cold sometimes.
Spare belts  -  You won't have to wait for the garage to order them.
                (sometimes it takes days)
Good Spare tire (fully inflated)  -  Nothin' like a useless spare to ruin
				     your day
Make sure your jack works.  Grease it.  -  Changing a tire is hard enough
                                           already.
Change your oil, oil filter and fuel filter  - Start out right.
Carry 4 quarts extra oil. -  In case you lose your oil for any reason.
Have a tune-up done or do it yourself.  - Good way to catch any problems.
align and balance the tires. - So you don't rattle your nerves. ;) 
Have the headlights aimed (With the car loaded) - Mis-aimed lights are
                                                  annoying
flashlight + spare batteries - You don't want to be in the dark.
A second flashlight. - In case the first don't work.
Sleeping bag. - It gets mighty cold at night.
Gallon Jug of drinking water - You could get thirsty or worse dehydrated.
First Aid Kit - Always 
bailing wire - To hold things together.
lug wrench - To remove wheels.
3' of pipe to put over lug wrench to loosen stubborn bolts.
food: granola bars and such. - You always get hungry when your stuck somewhere
Liquid Wrench - For those tough bolts.
WD-40 - Gets the grease off.
Spare fuses - Always have them.
Spare bulbs - Various ones for all the lights in your car.
Spare cash - Some people don't take credit cards or checks.
Waterless hand soap - To get the grease off your hands.
Book to read - To pass the time while you're waiting for the tow truck.
	       (or waiting for someone else to go get a tow truck) 
	       Or you could read the manual for your car and find out the
	       things you should have been doing for it.
Battery Terminal cleaner thingy - You know, the one with the wires in the doo-hickey.
Paper towels - There nice for cleaning up.
Small tarp - To put on the ground so you don't get too dirty.
Grubby cloths - To get dirty in.
Rags - To wipe off things on the car.
Gloves - For things to hot to handle.  Also for heavy duty stuff.
Bottle of Anti-freeze** - If the radiator loses some, you'll need to top it off.

** for water-cooled vehicles only (Duh...)

----------- end of essentials list ---------------------

Obviously, since you are in camping mode, you'll be taking more food and
stuff for &quot;roughing it&quot;.  Be sure to bring sleeping bags, even if you are
going in the summer.  It gets pretty cold in some places.

&gt; 
&gt; We are also planning to buy an Eagle Pass to National Parks. Has anyone 
&gt; done this?  Is it worth it, or is it best to just play it by ear?

Beats me...

&gt; We are also going to do most of our cooking on a camp stove.

Good for you!  Get a 10 or 20lb. tank so you don't have to buy those
little canisters that can't be recycled.  When you travel, just strap
it to the top of the camper in the cargo carrier.

Also, get one of those portable gas grills for about $20.  There are a
must for camping.

&gt; 
&gt; Also what should I expect to pay for a sink/cooler unit, used from a 
&gt; wrecked van?

I wouldn't pay more than $60.00 bucks for one out of a wrecking yard.
Depends on the condition.

&gt; Another questsion is about bras.  Our bus has one and it seem that rust 
&gt; has been forming under it.  Any thoughts?

Is it a cross-your-heart or what?  ;)  Since damage is already there, I'd
just chuck the bra.
