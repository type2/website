So Thom Fitzpatrick says:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;barney,&quot; but nobody seems to use that...
&gt; &gt;&gt; 
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;This term has also transferred over to the snowboarding world.  Although as
&gt; far as 
&gt; &gt;I can tell it has lost the negative association it used to have for
&gt; surfing.  Now 
&gt; &gt;it just seems to mean &quot;board babe&quot; (no political incorrectness intended)
&gt; although 
&gt; &gt;this may be a purely Canadian phenomenon.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;And what do big purple dinosaurs have to do with surfing anyway?
&gt; 
&gt; Sorry, but the term pre-dates the purple dinosaur poof by about 20 years.

Barney the (PBS)dinosaur never entered my mind.  I was thinking Barney
(The Flintstones) Rubble the entire time.

:)

Just say &quot;NO&quot; to cutsey dinosaurs.  ;p
