Subject: Intro

Well, OK, here goes:
 My name is Chris Grant and I live in San Francisco (for now) with my wife,
Leilani, and our eight month old son, Connor. I work as an Emergency Medical
Technician at a city E.R. Soon my RN license will come through and we will be
moving on. My interests are pretty varied...We are Deadheads in this
household. I have been studying Taekwondo for about five years now (2nd Gup).
I am also a licensed radio amateur. Any other Hams out there?
 When we do move from the city we will be doing so in style...in our 1976
Camper! It's still a work in progress. I bought the hulk a few months ago and
veeerrrry slowly put it back in perfect mechanical order (re-built my first
motor by myself - had someone *else* rebuild the tranny). Right now I am
prepping the body for a new layer of paint. The rest is really in great
shape. 103,000 miles, nice interior, got a stove, ac/dc fridge, and sink with
pump, of course. Just can't wait for our first camping trip in this bus...
Baby's first!
 I am pleased to meet you all,

Chris
'76 Camper
