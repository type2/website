for some reason it got sent before i meant to - oops again

...........

the saddest thing about Gus was that i killed the tranny.  It had been
sitting in the desert for three years before i bought it, and the trans boots
had completely rotted.  I drove it for about 300 miles and i started to get
tranny whines.  I  consulted my gurus, who told me to check the trans oil.
 It was, of course, dry, and the boots bad.  The guy had driven it 200 miles
back from the desert before i got it, so the 500 miles did permanent damage.
 i got 13,000 miles out of the trans, then the noises got awful.   I called
around to find prices on rebuilding split case trans - 750- more than i paid
for the bus.   Just in the nick of time, i saw on ad in the local paper for a
58 w/a good trans,  so i drove over and checked it out - he pulled it back
from idaho and had swerved to avoid hittin a deer and the bus tipped on its
side - it was not quite square, ok?  the drivers door didnt open too well.  

I adjusted the valves and the brakes, started it up, and drove it home, for
less than the 750 for a rebuild.    I agreed i wasnt buying the engine with
it, but he never came to get it  :).   Then i had to go to the parts store to
get some thing  On the way I lost 4th, then 3rd.   It just wouldn't do
anything in those gears.  (reverse had gone a thousand miles before)   So I'm
driving home in second,  and as i approached a stop light, there is this
horrendous sound of wrenching, tearing, shrieking metal, and i aint going
anywhere in any gear. 

it was kind of cool

well, it had a shadow of a first, and i got it off the street into a parking
lot, and called foe a tow from AAA,

so ALWAYS make sure of yr tranny boots &amp; check the oil on a new bus
