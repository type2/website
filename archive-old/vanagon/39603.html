Re:	looking for some Thing

Hi, all
I wanted to lurk more before I entered the frey, but I'm short on time. 
My wife's being transferred to Milwaukee, and we're moving from Puerto Rico. I
desperately need a car to pick up in the states sometime around the Memorial Day
weekend. My plans now are to fly to Manassas, VA and attend the Bug Out and hope
I find someThing there, but I'd rather have something lined up before then. I've
gotta have a someThing I can put about 3K miles on right away, it'll be our only
transportation until our Westie gets shipped up (about 3-4 weeks). 
Ultimately, I want a Thing in Very Good to Fine (or better) condition. Year is
unimportant (to me). It's gotta be pretty complete as far as emission controls
go (the Feds passed a new law... in order to drive a car on federally owned
property, ie: military bases, it's gotta pass the local inspection). I'm willing
to go somewhere besides VA to pick up the car, and I'll pay top dollar for
convenience and the right car.
If anyone can help me out, know someone who can, etc. I'd really appreciate it.
Thanks!

-Andy
