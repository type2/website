IMNHO put the bicycle in the van.  That's why you bought the brick instead of
a turbo corrado, remember?  Same with your slidin' stuff.  INSIDE out of mind
of the folks who might forget to return them.  So you say, what about my canoe?


Use the four hole rain gutter simulators on the f'glass top.  Measure thrice,
drill once.  Make sure every thing clears before you drill.

For your bikes:  You can drill a RGSimulator to match the bolts on the 
westie roof hinge if you have a westie and mount a standard RGutter mount 
crossbar there with fork mounts for the bikes.  Don't bother with the nifty
neato locks for the skewers, you'll use a pair of cables and serious locks
to deter the amateur.  The pro will get your stuff no matter what you use
unless you PUT IT INSIDE out of sight and mind.

Now get a mount that clips to raingutterless cars and mount it to the hatch
if you must.  It will fit and cinch it down just firmly not tightly.  It won't 
be carrying any weight only supporting the rear wheel in a near vertical 
orientation.  Keeps the wheel from rubbing on the paint.  You can carry three
or four bikes this way but YOU CAN'T use the rear hatch with the bikes on.

Reminds you to put em inside if parked for an extended period.  

A light tap from an unwary motorist and the bumper mount racks allow your 
custom unobtanium, carbone enhanced beauty to be trashed without further
damaging your car.  Lemme see, three bikes at $2500 ea (Merlin, etc) grunched
makes you weep, right.  Put em inside!  Or put em on the roof.  Or if mounted
on the hatch they're high enough that the errant soccermomintheUJV only
destroys your taillights and bumper.  

If you dint have the westie problem just use a guttermount bar set 58&quot; and
mount it to the very end of the raingutter.  It'll clear just fine.

Tall towers are necessary for mounting OVER the westie top and then of course
you can't open the top.

Much easier than finding the non existent on my 89 floor tracks.
