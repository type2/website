If you can measure and find the perfect thickness, have a glass shop custom 
cut a piece of tempered for you... this worked great on my Superbeetle 
'vert, and saved me a couple hundred bucks (the beetle glass ONLY comes as a 
kit, thereby selling you ever part associated). Make sure you have the 
propler &quot;tempered glass&quot; label showing on the final product.
