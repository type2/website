&gt;now, once you get the holder out, the bulb is still a bitch to get out.
pliers
&gt;will only break it. :(  find a drinking straw about the same diameter as the
&gt;bulb, and push it down onto the bulb. push all the way to the bottom of the
&gt;bulb &quot;slot&quot;. this will surround the little wire &quot;feet&quot; on the bulb and you
&gt;can pull the straw back out with the bulb. :)

&gt;yes, there is a little special stupid tool (looks like some tiny ice tongs)
&gt;to do this. the guy at the parts counter showed me the straw trick. :)

On my '83 camper, these little bulbs were soldered in to the bulb holder.
After trying to solder the wires on a replacement bulb, I went to the dealer
and 
purchased the bulb with the little black socket for $1.45 ea.   Much easier.
