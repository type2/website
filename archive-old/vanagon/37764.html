1971- the best year for The Bus- you know, Type I 1600cc engine, power
assisted brakes.

I just brought it down from Washington, it runs fine but needs to pass
CA smog. I had modified parts on it (centrifigal advance distributor,
2 BBL carb, smoother intake manifold) but The Man (State of
California) says I need all orig equipment- who cares if it is more
efficient with that other stuff on? Well, I tracked down the original
parts, except for the air cleaner, put it on, but haven't bothered
with the smog certificate or registration yet since I am now selling
anyway.

The rebuild on this motor was approx. 25,000 miles ago by a VW
mechanic in Wasington I bought it from. It was put back together very
tight- oil leaks almost non-existent. Has temp and tach gages on the
dash. 

Needs: clutch throwout bearing and clutch adjustement.
Horn doesn't work.

Appearance: Fairly ugly with a mish mash of paints and primer on the
outside and some rust. No award winner there. No serious body smashes.

Has Washington title.

Email me if you're interested.
