Subject: Christine

     Hmm,
     
     &gt;Say, none of you folks has a type II named &quot;Christine,&quot; do you? (or 
     &gt;should it be &quot;Kristine&quot;?)
     
     True Story:
     
     When I got my first car (A Fiat) I said to it (What, don't you talk to 
     you cars too?!) I'll call you Christine. And I said show me a sign to 
     tell me how you like the name...
     
     
     ...the cambelt snapped the same day talking out a couple of valves!
     
     
     Since then I call my vehicle car or bus, eg. &quot;Hi car, how are you 
     feeling mate?&quot;
     
     Lee.
