Subject: introduction

I just found this list by accident, it has been interesting reading, and
almost as active as the BMW MC lists I am on.
I am located in Palo Alto, CA. I currently own a 83,5 waterboxer westfalia
that I got new. I was one of the first to discover the coolant/metal
distruction problem (replaced pistons and liners on warranty). I mostly use
it to take me and my tuba to various jazz performances around northern
California. I have also taken trips around the US, old route 66, all 4
corners, and many desert expiditions without further major problems. I will
probably keep this one until I can get a Pinzgauer 6x6 to make into the
ultimate campmobile.
My previous bus was a 72 with all the typical problems. I installed a
custom internal/external oilcooler with ducted air flow, worked pretty
well. The current owner is using the bus as a loony-balloony delivery
truck.
