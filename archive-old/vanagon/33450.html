Subject: More on tires

Today I priced a new set of tires for the 81 camper and found that the
reinforced sidewall specification adds about $25 to the price of each. My
question is does the higher load range tire benefit normal daily driving or
does it anticipate loading 9 people with all their luggage on a 70 mph desert
run? In other words, is the heavier tire necessary for safe operation in
light to medium duty?

The PO had regular tires, two of which would be keepers. If the right answer
is to upgrade to the reinforced tires, would it be a problem to mix two and
two until those need replacing?

Thanks for your opinions,

Weston
