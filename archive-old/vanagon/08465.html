&gt;Anyone on the list know how to go about getting Transporter or
&gt;Transporter GL badges from Europe (or Mexico)?
&gt;How much--how much hassle?

i got mine from germany via someone from work who was going home to visit.
it wasn't but about $12US (&quot;but&quot;!!?!?!?!) and it wasn't a big hassle from the
dealer. there was some discussion with the parts clerk about WHICH badge was
wanted. apparently, there is a difference in the spacing of the holes (into
which the badge fits).  ???  anyway, they guess correctly and i got mine.

i don't think there is any such thing as a &quot;Transporter GL&quot;, however. as i
understand it, if it is a GL, it's called a Caravelle over there.

don't know about Mexico ... but if they do have &quot;Transporter&quot; badges, wouldn't
they fit only the older breadloaf buses? they don't make Vanagon bodies down
there.

what about Canada? do the pickups and panel vans come with &quot;Transporter&quot; or
&quot;Vanagon&quot;??
