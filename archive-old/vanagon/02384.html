Subject: Re: westy propane question

&gt; 
&gt; Can anyone tell me if it's safe to drive a westy with the propane
&gt; on for the refrigerator?  I know that one has to turn it off while
&gt; tanking up, but RV's all keep propane on while driving, so I'm 
&gt; wondering if this applies to the campers as well....
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks..

Well...*I've* done it since the refrigerator is such a pain to light up, even 
with '85 that had the auxiliary battery. Which battery saved the main battery
IF you happened to forget, and left the fridge running on 12v.

I NEVER had the flame go out, even in crosswinds and near horizontal deluge, 
while driving...

Turning it off while tanking? Why? What property of the propane burner 
in the recesses of the refrigerator cabinetry makes it dangerous in 
a fill-up situation? Considering the flash point of gasoline, I would 
consider it more hazardous to start a vehicle than continue the refrigerator
flame...
