&gt;I've always figured the electric heat units were for Californians, who think
&gt;that if it gets too cold you just take off your skis and go home.  I know
Correction: If it gets to cold, we take off our skis and go surfing! (at least
I do...)

Steamer Lane in Santa Cruz in the winter!  Ocean Beach (SF) will get to 18ft 
in the winter during some storms!  Even Cowells Beach in Stanta Cruz is good
in the winter!
