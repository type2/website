&gt;made out of kevlar instead of steel, no more &quot;stews&quot;.  For the unintitiated,
&gt;this &quot;stew&quot; was when everyone would put the &quot;entree&quot; (sounds better the main
&gt;can) in a helment and add heat and a lot of tobasco.  Not the best in the

a LOT of tobasco!! even more than Justin Wilson uses on his Cajun cooking
show. :)

&gt;C-Rats kept for a LONG time, too.  When I was in USMC boot camp in 1974 some
&gt;of ours were made in 1943!  Some with chicken noodle soup!  Still have my P38

yup. when i was overseas in 1969, i got c-rats dated 1953. still edible and
(depending upon the contents) somewhat palatable. sort of. sometimes.

so if you non-military types are reading this junk, you might ... MIGHT, mind
you ... consider army/military food such as C-Rations and MRE's as &quot;camping
food&quot; ... it's usually cheaper (if you can find it) than the stuff Campmor
and REI and the like will sell you. and i never ever heard of any soldier
who was killed by eating the stuff. :)
