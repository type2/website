We need to unionize!
Actually, the story you relate sounds pretty clear-cut!  The dealer AND
Winnie Bagoo are in the wrong!  Can't understand why they wouldn't simply
do the job over, RIGHT, and be done with it!  Better to spend extra time
ONCE and have a surprised, but satisfied, customer than a disgruntled one.


My problems, so far, have been handled without cost to me.  That's only
partial compensation, since I'd rather not ever see the dealer again than
know them by heart.

But my EV is a GL, so I don't have Winnie to deal with.  Good luck, but SUE
if it comes down to it.  Their &quot;repair&quot; is simply wrong, and you shouldn't
have to put up with it after spending on the order of 30K for the thing.
