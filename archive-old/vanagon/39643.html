Subject: VW Hello Atlanta 'Baseball' Caps

All,

I went by my dealer to pick up some stuff, when i was there i noticed this
cap, it is made out of grey cloth and has a velcro on the back for size
adjustment. On the front there is a orange/blue/white patch which says
'Hello Atlanta' and below that an 9 mm VW logo. Looks great. Dono if they are
available in the US. If anyone wants one or more of these: let me know, It's no
trouble getting them. They're not expensive but the airmail postage is more
than the price of one cap :( the total for one cap including airmail would
be  US$14.

Brian.
