&gt; XC4S    185 R14 C

I recently purchased a pair of these for the front of my 81 Westy.  I 
plan on adding a set to the rear come Summer if these are to my liking.  
I'll post periodic updates on their wear and traction capabilities.  They 
are basically a light truck tire tread pattern and look as if they would 
have excellent traction in most conditions.  The cost for two, mounted 
and balanced with a lifetime replacement warranty was $212US at Discount 
Tire.
