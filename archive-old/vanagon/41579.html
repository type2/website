Subject: '87 Syncro GL temp light


Symptoms:
*Sometimes flashes for a minute or more after starting
*Less frequently flashes intermittently during periods of slow driving
*Fades in and out during slow driving
*Recently does not flash at all upon starting ~50% of the time

Temp gauge seems fine, fan comes on at a reasonable temperature according 
to the gauge, coolant level is correct.  

So, what is the blinking light trying to tell me?

Thanks for any advice,

Chris Wyatt
