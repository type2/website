Subject: RE: '56 Kombi Update

Rust converter stuff that Thom used actually does work, but takes forever and/
or some low-humidity days to dry hard.  Also it only converts the rust it ac-
tually contacts, so you have to be conscientious about getting off all the
scale, even in the pits, or you'll leave rust working under the black converted
layer.
Good luck with it!
