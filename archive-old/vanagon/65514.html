Subject:      Why am I stalling?

Hello-

Upon starting my '87 Syncro it immediately stalls.  I have to give it a
little gas for 2-3 min. before it idles smooth.  When warm, it has no
trouble idling at 1000 rpm.  Any suggestions on the cause/fix to this
problem.

Background:     187K+, entire exhaust just replaced, coolant leak from
                stripped head bolt.

thanks,

Dave Dempsey &amp; '87 GL Syncro
