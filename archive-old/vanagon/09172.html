&gt; So now I'm thinking about rebuilding the slave cylinder.  Somebody
&gt; said rebuilds weren't always successful.  But the dealer wants $34.00
&gt; for the rebuild kit and $171.00 for a new cylinder.

Call Vee parts in San Diego.  They have the rebuild kits for $14.95 and
*new* slave cylinders for $69.95.  I just got off of the phone with them
and they said they would be happy to ship it.  

El Cajon	619-258-5524
National City	619-477-4787

In general, these guys can be a little gruff on the phone, but they have
by far the best prices on VW stuff, and they stock a lot of hard to find
parts.  For example, they had a large selection of main and air correction
jets for the dual solexes that came in 72-74 busses, as well as rebuild
kits for same for $13.95.  They also had a new master cylinder for my bus
for about $40 when Auto Parts Club wanted $100 and the FLAPS places were
even higher.

I have done lots of business with Vee Parts and they have never let me down.
