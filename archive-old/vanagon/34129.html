                                            Anti-theft Devices

The title is mis-leading.  You can't prevent your vehicle from being stolen
any more than you can prevent a bank from being robbed.  If someone wants to
steal your vehicle, they will do so.  Locking devices and alarms are more of
an inconceniece to you and your neighbors than to thieves.  The well
organized thief, and there are corporate-sized gangs specializing in stealing
cars for export, defeats such devices with ease, using electronic decoders
for the one and explosive-powered shears for the other.  (Despite their power
source, explosive-powered shears are very quiet, having a well muffled
exhaust, no louder than a heavy cough.)

The best deterrant is to introduce unknown factors into the thief's equation.
 And since they are going to steal the thing anyway, don't waste your
resources on systems already proven ineffective.

My idea of a good anti-theft system is one that provides for a graduated
response.  As the first stage, use something that calls attention to the
vehicle and the thief, such as pumping oil into the manifold and opening up
the vacuum line to the distributor.  The car lays down a huge trail of white
smoke, the engine balks and the thief usually bails out to look for easier
pickings.  These effects are easily accomplished with off the shelf
components and may be applied to both carburetted and fuel injected engines.
 For the forgetful, the system should turn on an unmistakable warning light
when armed.  To add a bit of whimsy, you might put a toggle switch near the
warning light.  Not a working one, of course.  The working switch should be
concealed, perhaps a push-switch behind a door panel, a completely invisible
switch.  The dummy switch will serve to distract the thief, giving them
something to do while the vehicle is lurching to a stop in the middle of the
freeway, surrounded by a cloud of white smoke.  

The ultimate anti-theft  weapon is to detonate a smoke grenade or tear-gas
cannister INSIDE the vehicle after triggering a 'count-down' beeper.  The
increasing tempo of the beeper has a remarkable effect on anyone unfamiliar
with it, plus it gives the forgetful owner plenty of time to toggle the
reset.

Both of these systems would has their own power source, using data from the
engine only for triggering information.  The system becomes armed whenever
the ignition is turned off.  Hot-wiring the car -- by-passing the regular
ignition -- does not render the system safe since it starts its count-down
whenever the engine is started by any means.

I admit the use of tear gas or smoke is a radical method.  The material in a
smoke grenade is a colloidal compound.  It clings to anything it touches and
may never be completely removed from some plastics, fabric and leather.  It
will also color the thief fluorescent red, yellow, purple or whatever,
depending on the color of the band around the grenade canister.  The tear gas
isn't much better.  It clings to fabrics and dissipates far more slowly than
depicted on TV cop shows.  But it also renders the vehicle valueless to the
thieves. 

If you're a chemist you might consider a system that sprays a ninhydrine
compound on the thief, such as used by banks and messenger services.  It
permanently stains the skin and is often still evident when the thief is
brought to trial.

Smoke and tear-gas grenades are normally classed as pyrotechnic or explosive
devices and their possession is illegal in some states.  Given the current
lack of justice in the American legal system, using such 'violent' devices to
protect your property from theft, a 'non-violent' crime, you may find
yourself in more trouble than the car thief, whos lawyer will probably argue
that his tramatized client, who now glows fluorescent yellow even in the
dark, should be compensated for the ridicule he/she/it has suffered from
his/her/its peers as a result of the cruel and unusual punishment you've
inflicted.

Personally, I believe fluorescence in defense of Volkswagens is not a crime
and will defend my vehicles to the last erg of my ingenuity.

PS --- ummm.... I wouldn't stand too close to my bus if I were you.  I found
these war surplus ejection seats at an auction and, well...
