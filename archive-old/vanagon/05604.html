Ok,

	I finally go the bus started!  Yahoo!

	It turns out that the brand new starter was toast, but that may have
been due to the bushing that was also toast.  Got a new one (warranty) put 
that puppy in this afternoon, and VROOOM!  20 or so horsies just waitin' 
to go!  (40 horse minus bad-valve factor)         

	I actually took it around the block!  Wheee!

	Now I need to find a good used shortblock to start my rebuild.

	A neighbor of mine is heavy into off-road racing VW's, told me to
get a AS21 or AS41 case.   So I'll be on the lookout at the junkyards.  I've
already got a good set of pistons and cylinders, and decent heads, although
I'll probably get them rebuilt or trade them in...

	I'm also considering a 12v conversion, since a 'fridge would be a nice
touch...

See Ya
Thom
