A while ago I mentioned a heater that I was thinking of installing. It is
available fro JC Whitney as well as Canadian Tire: Here's the scoop:

electrical - 12V
crystal energy cell
300watts/1200BTUs
102CFM
draws 25 amps
fan and heater

Q: will this be at all sufficient to add extra heat to the van and is
25amps an overwhelming drain on the battery?
