JeeeeEEEEEEEzzzz, lighten up Derek! As if we all have tons of time on
our hands to go pissin' around and bumping up the number of messages
so we can beat Joel, etc... 

If you want technical stuff, why not get friendly with your local
VW service manager....hell after dealing with my local dealership
for 25 years I'm on a first name basis with the owners, the parts
and service managers and all the mechanics, etc...on and on ad 
nauseum. I've managed to get a factory rebuilt engine for my wife's
bug convert at dealer cost, the service manager gave me his spare
set of EuroVan manuals, etc..etc. 

So as far as getting info, etc., I have my sources. But there is 
something very special about this group, as well as the Vintag
list that I haven't seen in other lists I subscribe to, or even
R.A.VW for that matter is a real sense of community. I have
only met a couple of people from the group face to face, yet
there seems to be a real bond between bug and bus owners that
transcends the simple need for technical interchange.

Let me give you an example. Six months ago I mentioned to my
wife that the &quot;face&quot; of the EuroVan looked like the Luck Dragon
from the Neverending Story. Two weeks ago Cetin listed the names
of his vans, and lo and behold his white EuroVan is named Falkor..
after the Luck Dragon from Neverending Story. Reminds me of the
Cosmic Lattice of Cooincidence from Repo Man... ok enough of the
movie cliches...

Another example. How then do you explain the desire for a whole group
of total strangers to drive cross country just to get together?

It would be interesting for some psychological-type or even someone
writing a doctoral dissertation to do a profile of this group to determine
what makes this group so closely knit. We've all heard the term
&quot;virtual reality&quot; , to me this group is a &quot;virtual community&quot;.

We share the pain when other's vans have major problems, heck we
even commiserate when (in the case of Ray Landers) family problems
cause a member to drop out, we share the elation when someone
like Thom Fitzpatrick gets his bus running.....and yes, most of
you out there even put up with me.

IMHO, I wouldn't change a thing about this list. Perhaps if
there is a need for a purely &quot;technical-nuts-and-bolts&quot; group
maybe a VWTECH group should be started, and leave vanagon and
Vintage to remain the &quot;virtual community&quot; that they have become.
