Subject: Peanut butter...(F)

Has anyone had positive experiences using the stuff as undercoating. Ron
mentioned &quot;carsicken-genick&quot; factors but what about raydon gas. Has anyone
experienced gas problems with peanut butter? I'm doomed to camping with the
inlaws next weekend and want to be prepared.
