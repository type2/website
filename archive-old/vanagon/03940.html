Joel made an attempt, but this one didn't _quite_ make it to the list, so 
I'm manually forwarding it.

&gt;Subject:      Some POR-15 Info

Due to the recent thread in the VINTAGVW mailing list, I took a field
trip today to POR-15, Inc.  It's a little place in Whippany, NJ where
they make all kinds of interesting chemical/paint/rust-inhibiting
products.

Outside the front door, they have a rusty metal hoe sticking in the
ground.  That is, the part that's still bare is quite rusty; the part
that was treated with POR-15 was real nice, and the POR-15 had been
painted over existing rust.  The POR-15 loses its shine in the sun, but
they sell a top coat for it that maintains its gloss even in the sun
(the un-top-coated part that was not in the sun looked as nice as the
top-coated part, so I'd imagine it would be a great undercoating.)

Inside, they have lots of cats and lots of products.  They make:

 - A rust coating that paints right onto metal or rust.  In fact,
   if you paint it over existing paint or undercoating, it may not
   hold if the paint its adhering to decides to bubble or peel.  This
   comes in black, silver, or clear, various sizes.  Evidently, once
   you open a can of this stuff, you must transfer it to a glass jar
   with some plastic wrap between the jar &amp; the lid.  If you try to
   reseal the can once you open it, it will most likely seal itself
   PERMANENTLY.

 - A rust cleaner/surface prep solution.  This I didn't see in action,
   but they say it's necessary to use on galvanized steel or aluminum
   before using POR-15, as the metal is too slick for the POR-15 to bond;
   this stuff apparently puts some zinc powder coating on the metal.

 - Gas tank cleaning/coating kits.  These clean the rust/gum/varnish
   out of your gas tank, then prep the surface, then coat the inside
   with a flexible coating that is not affected by fuel.  They are a
   big supplier to motorcycle places.  they told me not to use this on
   my brandy-new gas tank for the '60 bug, but that it would work fine on
   the old gummy tank I've taken out of the bug.  They told me that with
   all the steps and drying in between each step, it could take up to
   2 weeks to do a good job on your gas tank.

 - Engine enamel, in lots of cool colors.  This stuff doesn't prevent
   rust, but can be painted over POR-15, which does.

Anyway, the folks were real nice, and the products looked good, so I
bought me a quart of black POR-15 for the '60 bug, and they threw in
a sample can of the clear stuff (nice for scratches &amp; dings).

I'm in no way associated with these folks, and I haven't yet tried my
POR-15, but my interest was piqued by the discussions on the net of late.
Their number is:

Many thanks to Bradley for finding the ad for these folks in Super Chevy
magazine and telling VINTAGVW about it!
