&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Hi,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;We have recently bought an 87 Vanagon and with it the proverbial
&gt;&gt;leaking head problem. I've seen in the past people having
&gt;&gt;various degrees of success having VWofA chipping in with 
&gt;&gt;some of the replacement costs...I also dimly recall someone
&gt;&gt;mentioning an autoline arbitration phone number.

I am still waiting for a reply from BBB here in Oakland CA. Just look into
your yellow (or white?) page and look for BBB's 800 number. Sorry I don't
have my folder at work today, can not find the number at this moment.
When calling BBB just ask for AUTOLINE regarding VW engine problems.
You should prepare yourself beforing calling. Gather all info regarding
your head gasket problem first. Find all repair bills, etc. Once you call
they will mail you the claim forms in a few days and then you have a week
to turn the forms in. You need to get an estimate for repairing the problem.
They ask the estimate copy to be attached to the claim. 

You can call VWoA and ask for info about AUTOLINE. They will need info
regarding your problem and VIN before they mail you the info.

Good luck.
