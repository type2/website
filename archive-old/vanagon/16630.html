ok, so i tried to fix my ignition and lost my headlight dimmer.  there are
two wires coming from the switch one brn one brn-wht,  the circuit diagram
shows them connecting to the dimmer relay.  i checked that...they are. 
three thicker wires run from the relay to the lights.  the lights go on. 
the switch does not cause the lights to dim or undim.  what?

ok bye
