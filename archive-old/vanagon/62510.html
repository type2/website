Subject: Rebuilt ECU'S availible for 86 &amp; up Vanagons!!

Listees,

  There has been a problem getting a &quot;Decent&quot; price on a Computer if you needed one.  
The Dealer will let you know that $695.00 will take care of the bill.

  I have a option for those of you who need or want a different ECU.

  $285.00 for the Rebuilt Ecu.  I need a Core back to though.  The person doing the 
&quot;Rebuilding&quot; of the units values the Cores at $250.00.  If we keep the cycle going we 
can have an near endless supply of ECU's. I have $ invested in this program too. I 
have bought BAD ecu's and stockpiled to get this as an option to offer. I had to get 
enough of these together to get this person to do the work for me.  They have a large 
amount of knowledge in repairing these and I'm working on the warranty end of it too. 
 Right now I'm going to offer 6 Months on them, but after I see what he'll offer me 
that # might change too.

  I'm always trying to offer the things that are needed most at a reasonable price.  
The fact that I work in a VW repair shop helps me to know what is failing at the 
present time in the different VW's on the road today.  I notice the Same failures in 
our customers cars as the List members, kind of funny I think.  The problems come in 
cycles depending on miles and time frame. 

  Anybody that is in need of one of these ECU's, or wants more info e-mail  or phone 
me.

  Kyle
