Hey Guys,

Over the weekend I was driving along and saw a new mercades coming up
behind me with very well focused headlights that had a blue hue to
them.  They were really bright.  

Has anyone seen them or know about them?  Could I get them or something
like 'em for my 86GL?

BTW, I saw 6 Vanagons around Philly and South Jersey this weekend, one
of which I rode along side of on RT 295 for about a mile and couldn't
even get a smile out of the woman driving it, maybe she thought I wanted
more than to just say Hi.
