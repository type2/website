&gt; I am shopping for tires for my vanagon again too. One of tire dealers I talked
&gt; to said 6 ply tires and the reinforced tires are the same thing.
&gt; 

Hi David.  I use Yokohmama Y370 tires on my Syncro.  It's an
LT195 75/14 and is more than capable of supporting these vans.  They 
are fantastic as an all-season/all-terrain type tire.  Very quiet, 
and resonably priced.  The load rating is 'D&quot;with 1765 lbs and max 
air pressure of 65 psi.(I run tire pressures at 43 front/53 rear).
 These are probably the best tires I have tried in recent years.  Near 
perfect balancing, and excellent handling for such a heavy van!  Way
 better than the Contis, and they are excellent in snow/ice.  I have 
recommended these tires to others locally with these vans, and people 
really like them.  

Oh yeah, they are 6 ply rated as well.

Harry.
