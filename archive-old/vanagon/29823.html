Response to Dan Hebert:

            A few weeks ago I wrote a note about EV stalling. Your problem
sounds alot like mine, but mine only occurs when the A/C is on. Given it's
November in TO you might think this a ludicrous suggestion. But remember,
the A/C works when the defroster is turned on. So note if it occurs in this
situation. One very promising suggestion I received on this is to have some-
one check the relay or whatever that raises the engine idle speed when the
A/C is on. THis might be faulty. I will have the dealer do this next time
I'm in for something else.
            Good luck. And let us know what happens (as I will if I get there
first).
