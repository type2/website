Subject: Re: Trailer Hitches For Vanagon Class III Found
Date: Sat, 1 Apr 95 15:20:08 EST

&gt; This state of affairs is odd since in Europe Vanagon trailer hitches can be
&gt; found capable of towing 4,000 lbs or more. 
&gt; 
Not to seem crazy here, but how are you going to tow 4000 lb. with
a Vanagon, we used to tow a 500 lb. or so pull camper with our
'86 and top speed dropped to no more than 70 mph surely and that
was with the 2.1 liter, maybe guys with flat 6's could tow the vans
own weight, not most of us.
Still price seems reasonable enough considering we probably gave $100
for our tow hook attaching class 1.
