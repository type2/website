Subject: Bosch starter relay numbers


Sorry for the delay, this is the first time I've driven the Rabbit since
the question came up and I just haven't thought to look prior to this.
This is the relay to cure the dreaded &quot;It's got plenty of juice and I can
jump it with a screwdriver, just not always with the key&quot; problem I
posted about last week.

The Bosch relay number is:0 332 014 150
Specs:12V 30A
Hookups are:	85 - solenoid wires from ignition
	86 - GROUND (-)
	87 - BATTERY (+)
	30 - Starter solenoid

Check the diagram on the side of the relay for more info.

Hope this helps.
