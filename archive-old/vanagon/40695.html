&gt;Hi All!
&gt;
&gt;Does anyone know if upgrading a 1600 Type I FI engine to a 1641
&gt;is easily accomplished?  
&gt;
&gt;Actually, the real question is will the FI system self-adapt to the 
&gt;new displacement?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;..Markus

Yes, it will work just fine.  I have a 79 beetle running a 1776.  Only
problem is during warm up. That is probably due to the cam more than the
displacement though.  It even passes emissions with no problem.  I would
restore the EGR system to keep it from pinging and melting the heads.
