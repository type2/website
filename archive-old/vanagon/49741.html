Subject: Re: mood lights - read this


When my wife and I were rallying our GTI, I bought some of these so-called 
red mood lights in preparation for a night rally. As you may know, 
supposedly, red light does not screw up your night vision.

Anyway, after about 20 minutes of keeping the dome light on, the light grew 
dim...and then we heard a slight &quot;crack!&quot;.... and the light went out.

At the next checkpoint I popped the dome light out...aparently the red 
coating overheated....went from red to dark brown, and then the glass in the 
light bulb fractured.

Bottom line...we went to using regular bulbs and stage lighting gel inserts 
for our next rally.

These bulbs are a total waste of money.
