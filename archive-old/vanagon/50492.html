Subject: Re: Golf/Jetta engine in gas Vanagon

The reason for gas conversions to diesels is that the bell housing, oil pan,
et. from the diesel will fit on a rabbit engine (since it was a rabbit
diesel in the Van).  Yes you can do a gas-to-gas conversion, but it is
easiest if you find the stock bell housing to bolt up to the tranny, and
the oil pan (which has a bottom sitting at a different angle -- the Vanagon
installation sits real crooked.

Various folks sell bits to put all sorts of other engines in a Vanagon --
Porsche 911, Subaru's
