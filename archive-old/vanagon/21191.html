Subject: looking a the ol' cam shaft

After talking to Jim at Bus Boys(thanks jim), I went home to look at mine and
figure out which one I needed.  Well, after a bit of serching I found the
little that says how far off from 0 the cam is, -4.   I was a bit suprised by
this.  I think my motor has be rebuilt once, the bus has 203000 miles on it,
so I don't know if this is the orignal cam.  Is there a way that I can tell
if this is the correct cam.  The lobes on the old one are very groved. This
may seem picky but I want to do this right.

On a second cam note, what kinds of risks am I taking getting  a reground
cam.

Thanks for any info.
