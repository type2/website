I have the same problem, I also can occasionally smell coolant. Lots of
people on the list have had problems with the rear heater core leaking. I
was going to check it next, but haven't had time yet. It may be the source
of our problem.

&gt; &gt;I've noticed that my coolant refill bottle seems to run dry, in the
space of
&gt; &gt;about a week.  The engine was recently fixed for a colant leak and the
heads
&gt; &gt;rebuilt.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;1.) Is loss from the refill tank normal?
&gt; &gt;2.) Where do I check for leaks?
&gt; 
&gt; I have the same problem.  As far as I know, all coolant leaks were fixed
&gt; and I STILL have a regularly dry overflow bottle.  I'll be looking for
&gt; suggestions, too.
