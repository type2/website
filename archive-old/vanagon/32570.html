Subject: RE: engine swaps

Joel Danke asks if type 4 engine (that you remove to insert something
bigger in the bus) will fit in a bug, (so that the bug engine can go in 
a Honda 750 frame).  Problem with this is to figure out how to hold up
the back of the engine.  There was an article years ago in DBHVW about
Type 4 in a Thing.  Thing has more body work in back to bolt a new 
brace to, and any slab-sided box you add so the Type 4 fan fits looks
perfectly natural on a Thing.  Or you can use the fiberglas shroud that
puts the Type 4 engine's fan up on top like a 912.

I guess some people think the bug trans can hold up the Type 4 without
any new brace, but I'm skeptical.

Last swap meet I was at, there was a Porsche 356 with 911 six, so any-
thing is possible: &quot;If your bug's front wheels don't touch the ground,
your bug's engine is too big.&quot;
