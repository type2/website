Subject: Re: Parting out 80 westy

I need the three little doors on the side -- you know the electricty, water,
and, ....hm, maybe there are two different water ones.  All of mine are
missing the lids, but I scraped a concrete post the other day, too.  Now
all the plastic bits are busted...

If these are still there, I'd love to get them!

(If anybody else out there has these...)

Also check the oil door lid to see if it's a California model.  If so, the
exhuast pipes (mainly the left header pipe and crossover ppe) are worth
bigtime -- several folks on the list have paid more than $300 each.  I don't
need 'em, but somebody does.

Snag the idle stabilizer if it's there.  Again, I don't need one for an 80,
but these are expensive little buggers.

Oh, I'll take the gas heater, with all the wiring and pumps... (^;
