Subject:      Re: Leaking Heads - aargghh! - What to do?

On Mon, 29 Sep 1997 08:47:37 -1000 you said:
&gt;I've got some coolant dripping from my right side head. (An '87, 120k mi.)
&gt;What should I do initially? And then what should I do after that?

first, look VERY VERY carefully right after you shut off the engine ...
try to find out where the leak is. my bet is that it's not the heads, but
that little flange on the backside of the engine, where that little hose
goes go the bleeder-ring-tube (the tube that runs around the top of the
engine compartment). the hose goes between the v-belt for the power steering
(to get the belt off, you have to disconnect this hose). where the hose
attaches to the engine is a flange ... the original one is plastic, and it
eventually warps and starts leaking. my 88 did it at about 120K miles, too.

the replacement flange is metal, and uses a real gasket (instead of an
o-ring). here's some info:
--------------------------------------
Import Service, March '90  Vol3, No 3
Vanagon coolant leakage

&quot;A damaged plastic coolant return flange located at the rear of the
right cylinder head can cause coolant leakage on 86-88 models.  The
plastic flange is close to the engine's drive belts and can be
damaged by a loose or broken belt.  Engine overheating can also warp
the sealing surface of the flange, causing coolant leakage and more
overheating.

To correct (or avoid) these problems, replace the damaged plastic
flange with a metal coolant return flange, P/N 025 121 160 D, and
gasket P/N N 901 685 01.&quot;

-------------------------

for what it's worth, i never could get the gasket from vw dealers, so i
went to NAPA and got some multi-purpose, adhesive-on-one-side high-temp
gasket material and cut it to shape (you'll have to cut holes for the
coolant passage and for the two bolts). also make SURE you have a good
hex-head allen wrench (one that isn't too badly rounded) ... you CAN remove
the flange as-is, but it's MUCH easier to get to if you unbolt the power
steering pump and lay it aside. watch out for the wires.
good luck.
