Subject: Westy tent for sale
Date: Mon, 20 Feb 1995 00:16:26 -0800 (PST)

I went to an auto swap meet here in San Diego on Saturday.  It is called
the &quot;Big Three&quot; swap meet and was free admission.  It was a nice day, so
what the hell, I decided to look around.  Despite the name, there were VW
parts all over the place.  I met one guy with a 59 Micro Deluxe ragtop with
safari windows - he was about half done restoring it.  Talked to him for
about an hour tryin to get him interested in the GNATT tour and tryin to get
him to sell me his 61 single cab that he says he has in his garage.  Anyway,
I walk around some more (like two more hours) and I am not even half way
through!  This thing was huge!  I found out it is a once-a-year event.  Oh,
I guess I'm rambling, huh? 

So a little while later I stop and talk to this woman with a 72 Camper.  I
stopped cause there was a tent attached to the camper with a for sale sign
on it.  The tent is yellow, with a dark blue top, and about 6 by 9 feet.
It has a screen door with a canvas cover that is striped.  The tent is held
up by aluminum poles, and attaches to the rain gutter of the bus.  It also
has extra canvas that attaches around the sliding door to make a good seal
against bugs.  The tent is in great shape except for a tear in the front
(repaired) that she said was done by a hungry raccoon.  The tent has no
identifying marks on it but was obviously made for a VW van.  She swears
it came from a 67 Westy.  So how much?  She says she wants $400 for it.
If it's really a 67 Westy tent, it sounds like a good price.  She is a
nice lady and who knows, she may sell it for less.  Says they got a bigger
camper now and don't need the tent anymore.  I asked if I could post her
phone number to this list and she didn't have a problem with it, so here it
is:

(619) 445-0296

I think this is her husband's work number.  Hope someone will be interested...
