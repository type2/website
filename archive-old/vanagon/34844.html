HELP!

        I just got this 72 camper and the engine won't stay lit because when
the ignition switch is released from starting, the connection to the coil,
etc. is dropped.  I can see this with the dash lights, fuel gauge, etc.  I
am trying to remove the ignition switch, and having some difficulty.    
        I have dropped the steering column, found and unscrewed the little
hidden 2 screws underneath the attaching screws, but cannot seem to dislodge
the sumagun.  If I could remove the chrome ring around the key, it might
work, but it doesn't seem to want to budge either.  
        I tried to remove the wheel, and even unscrewed the 3 screws from
underneath the horn ring, but cannot get the horn button to let go....HELP.
