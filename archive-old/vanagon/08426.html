&gt;Heck, I am getting pretty darn jealous of our friend 
&gt;with the 1.9L Vanagon diesel.

Har, har, har. (Contented laughter.)

&gt;This is the 1.9L Umwelt diesel?

Nope.  Normally aspirated.  I don't think the Umwelt would have 
enough grunt to cope with my driving style.  (For further 
elaboration, check my Christmas post which I'm composing in my 
head and will type next.)  As an enviro-head, I like the idea 
of the Umwelt, available on the Transporter as a 68bhp unit.

&gt;Can one buy a Vanagon/Transporter with a turbodiesel?

Not according to their current catalogue.

&gt;Will VW ever let me order one, here in the UUUUnited States?

MMMMaybe.  :)
