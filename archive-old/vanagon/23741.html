&gt;  &gt; What do you call a vehicle that looks the same frontwards and backwards?

&gt; A Renault.  My son has a book titled &quot;Cars Europe Never Built&quot;, and in
&gt; it is a picture of a Renault that was designed to drastically reduce
&gt; the number of body parts to be manufactured.  No woder it never made
&gt; it to production!!!!

Ain't that the Renault Dauphine?  Rear-engined, water-cooled?  A buddy of 
mine back in high school had two, one for parts.  One of our hobbies was 
racing around in the sand hills west of Juno Beach, Fla.  He flipped his 
once.  Rolled it back over, laid down in the back seat and kicked the 
roof back into an approximation of its original shape, and drove off.

PS anyone who's had trouble reaching the westy tent page lately please 
drop me a note.

PPS Joel, don't be offended by them yankee law-yurs and their disparagin' 
remarks about our vehicular and familial peculiarities.  Evur'body knows 
they's just envious 'cause they cain't marry their purty cousins and 
serve dirt at the reception.
