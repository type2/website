Subject: Re: Diesel swap

&gt;Does anyone have an inkling of how well a diesel to gas motor swap
&gt;works out in an 84 vanagon? Ive got a line on an 84 westi with a
&gt;diesel/stick that doesn't work that I want to change to an 1800
&gt;rabbit/auto. I am curious how easy or difficult the swap is and does it
&gt;make for a better vehicle?

I purchased an '84 diesel to gas, and yikes, it was scarry.  The short
story is that I replaced 2 engines in 150 miles. The long story talks about
months of waiting and shipping engines to wyoming, fighting warranties,
attorny general, better business bureau, blah, blah, blah.
My trusted mechanic put a 2.2L subaru in his diesel and loves it. He got
mine running but I was too chicken to drive it anywhere, so I sold it. Of
course the folks who bought it drove it to Baja twice and other long
domestic trips without engine problems. Perhaps just bad Carma for me...
In speaking with other mechanics, they always make the same yuckie face
when you mention a diesel to gas conversion. I've seen it work, but I'll
never do it again.
