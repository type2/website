Subject: Intermittion power loss problem

You wrote that you were having power loss problem intermittenly with your
vanagon.  A while back someone wrote about the same problem in &quot;The
Transporter&quot;. If I remember correctly, the problem was in the wiring
harness the goes to the airflow meter.  VW was aware of the problem and
they have a replacement part harness for that problem.  If I can find the
artical in one of my past issues I'll post it to the Vanagon list.  Hope
this helps.
