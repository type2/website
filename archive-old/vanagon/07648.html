Subject: Strange Sounds From Engine

This is in response to Stuart Hutton's Dec 5 letter


I recently had some strange noises coming from my engine which sounded similiar
to what you were describing, although describing them is difficult.  However,
the noises occured during idle also.  I was able to pin point the problem to the
water pump.  Replacement of the pump has cured the noises, for this week at
least.  Also, there was no hint of engine over-heating.
