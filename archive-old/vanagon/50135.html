Hi John,

I've got an '87, and have never had any real problems, though I thought I
had. It seems to be a common complaint that people have, and they got to
lengthy machinations to have everything checked out.

Number one, don't trust the little change of color in the corner of the
fridge itself. I have never seen it on; my wife claims she can see it, but
I wonder.

Number two, unscrew that little screw underneath the door; maybe some water
will come out.

Number three, pump it 32 times and then click it five or so times, all the
time holding the button in; continue holding the button in. Watch your LED
for the clue as to whether it's lit.

If this doesn't work after five tries, then go outside the van, undo the
round cap (4&quot; or so in diam) and you'll see TWO holes leading down towards
the fridge, each about the diameter of a quarter. Get some kind of hair
dryer or other type of blowing machine and put it over the central hole and
let it blow; you should be able to feel air coming out of the other,
off-center hold. Do this for a minute or so; is lots of crap coming out of
hole #2? Good.

Now go back to starting your fridge.

Good luck.

Neil
