&gt; Gee, these prices seem amazingly high.  What would one expect to pay

I looked into buying a rebuilt engine for both air cooled and water 
cooled  Westfalias and here are the prices I was quited by Kohlweiss - 
$2000 with rebuildable core for a water cooled GEX engine and 1200 for an 
air cooled with rebuidable core. You will find similar prices in many of 
the VW mags. Essentially a rebuildable core is a short block (case/cam 
and main shaft that in GEX's mind can be refurbished for future use); 
prices go up between 3-5 hundred depending on the components that are 
not rebuildable. Mind you these are rebuilt heads (not new) and without 
the flywheel which is easily taken from the old engine. Pistons and 
valves will be new in either case.

You will probably pay someone 1000 dollars to install the engine.

WE ending up looking for an aircooled Westfalia and put the engine in 
ourselves (actually twice, because the first time the end play was too 
large - GEX replaced the engine hassle free). My sense is if you have 
taken out a bug engine this will be a breeze - 2 days max work. Without 
all the tin a watercooled would be even simpler to install - 4 bolts to 
the tranny, 4 to the engine mount and.voila!...The grunt work if you are 
willing to do it is not that complicated... we took pictures along the 
way so as to remember where all the wires and pipes went.

The biggest stumbling block was replacing the left exhaust manifold - VW 
wanted 400 for  what amounts to a cast iron exhaust pipe- fortunately a 
wreckers nearby had the part for 80....

After installation the key issue is break-in and getting the fuel injection 
equipment to 
operate hassle free at the earliest stages - this is where the VW specialist 
comes in handy 
because he/she could help you set the timing, check manifold leaks etc.
at the outset. There is no other way if you expect to pass the Cal smog test.

Greg's VW and Fred's Garage in Menlo Park were extremely helpful in this 
regard.


BTW the main reasons we ending up not buying a watercooled apart from 
the expense were the stories  about how the early ones (83-85) were prone to 
cracked heads and leaking gaskets after 80,000.... plus the aircooled 
mystique just wouldn't be there....
  &gt;  


I'll let you know if I still believe that in about a couple of years (I 
have heard GEX uses valve seat inserts that are prone to come out at 20k).
