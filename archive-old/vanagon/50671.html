Subject: 86 GL - Gas Tank Problem

Hi all,

I have now owned this 86 GL for 10 months, including a fair amount of maintenance
(head replacement etc.) but a problem which someone may have experienced before now 
needs to be addressed.  When I fill the gas tank, I am getting major spillage coming out
of what seems to be an overflow somewhere.  I have had it into the local dealer; their
comment was that they would have to drop the gas tank to investigate (apparently a 4 hour
task at $55 per hour) and only then would they be able to determine the cause.

This seems to be quite a bit of money just to determine a problem - has anyone experienced
this before - any suggestions would be much appreciated !

Thanks in advance
