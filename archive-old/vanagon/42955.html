   That's a nice description of a procedure to replace instrument bulbs Colin,
but it seems like an incredible amount of hassle to replace a bulb that I was
able to purchase at a VW dealer 2 years ago at US$3.80 apiece.  How much do they
want now?  

   They ought to last a long time at less than full brightness.
