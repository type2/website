&gt;You might try:
&gt;King Bolt Co.
&gt;233 W. Arrow Highway
&gt;Glendora, CA 91740
&gt;
&gt;(818) 914-2070
&gt;
&gt;They've had most of the metric stuff I've needed, even in stainless!

Thanks Jim, I'll have to call them after the fourth.  Have a great holiday,
I'll be traveling back to Topeka Kansas, for the fourth, so I won't be
online for a few days.

Happy Fourth of July to all List Members!!!

If you can't dazzle them with brilliance,
baffle them with bull sh*t.
