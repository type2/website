Subject: Re: Raceware Head Studs

&gt; 	I have heard a lot about RACEWARE studs for the Wasserboxer heads.
&gt; Supposedly they have been able to stop the leaky head gasket syndrome.  If
&gt; (when) my heads start to weep I will try them.  But I was also wondering
&gt; if anyone out there has used these studs, and how well they worked?  Also
&gt; do you guys think that it would help to prevent/postpone the leaking if I
&gt; switched them out now?  TIA

We've been here before as usual, the Raceware are plain and simple 
BS, weak studs are not the problem, the stock can handle being 
torqued well beyond the initial factory rates, the late 80's &quot;factory fix&quot;
was in fact to retorque to higher spec.  This is not the root of nor the 
solution to the problem which is one of crevice corrosion.  Also the 
Raceware are no more matched to the engines expansion rates than are 
the stock, the Racewhere are high grade alloy steel the engine a 
combination of steel sleeves and alloy water casing, always doomed to 
error.  Unlike Porsche dilivar studs used in conjunction with an air 
cooled engine it is the different expansion rates of the Wasserboxer 
pieces that exasperate the problem.  For a T4 engine, sure go with 
them and their new rod bolts, a fine idea, though pricey, Euro Car 
just started BTW a hi po T4 rebuild series for a 914 last month 
should have interesting though in EC fashion poorly documented tips.  
As to Raceware resisting corrosion of the stud better, sure maybe 
they are coated or something but I'd bet the corrosion will  beat
the stud rusting problem to a Wasserboxer death.  The Wasserboxer was 
plain and simple a badly flawed design and one thar VW clearly 
regreted, must have really goaded them that Subaru experiences no 
major problems, ones best chance is to maintain the cooling system by 
the book with proper changes at proper intervals and a lot of prayer. 
Still, we got heat after all.
