Subject: What cruise control system should I buy/


Listmembers.......

I've got truckers leg :-)  What aftermarket cruise control systems have you 
installed in your vanagons?
Who did you buy it from?
What model?
How well does it perform?
Any recommendations?
I've got an 87 syncro van.  I've looked at some of the JHW systems, but 
would like to get a recommendation from a listmember.

I'll also check the archives, but would like any up to date info you all 
might have.
Please reply directly since I am not currently recieving daily list 
correspondance:
