Subject: Re: Joel Walker, how 'bout your E-mail address?

&gt;Thom sucks up by typing:


&gt;&gt;Man, does _everybody_ owe Joel or what?  I know I do...


Awwww JeeeeeeeEEEEEEEEeeeeeezzzz Thom... will you quit feeding into
Joel's ego! I can see it now...Fridays will degenerate into two
lists...where people/busses are and the NEW &quot;Who Owes Joel&quot; List.
Yep, Godfather Joel (with tissues in his cheeks and all)...
&quot;You never gave me or my Vanagon respect...or even asked me
to your garage for a quart of oil....and now you are asking
me for help on the day of the purchase of a used Vanagon??&quot;

I know why Joel has a couple of old Double Cabs floating around..
he made the owner an offer he could not refuse!!!


Well, that's all I'm going to say about the subject lest I
add one other thing...perhaps GODfather is a bit much...
maybe we could call him the VANfather...

Thats it..yep...I don't want to say anymore so I don't wake
up with the front end of my EuroVan cut off and lying in
bed next to me!!!

P.S. Joel...only kidding...I would NEVER truly say anything
offensive about you!!   ;-)
