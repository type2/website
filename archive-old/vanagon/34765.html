Subject: EV/Projektzwo

Hello again,
As part of my Eurovan file, I  have a brochure from Project Zwo of 
Germany. (They had a press release in Euroean Car magazine for a remote 
control rear side windows, so they could be opened and closed from the 
driver seat (similar to a Ford Windstar that I had rented once.) 

In addition to the window kit, they have &quot;aero&quot; body styling kits, 
wheels, tires, steering wheels, a console (with cup holders), lowering 
springs, fog light kits (while they don;t list it in their price list, 
one photo even shows a REAR fog light!) tubular brush bar (for that 
non-stateside EV synchro), etc. etc..

While they do not have an agent in the States, they seem willing to ship 
overseas. In their brochure of EV accessories, there is a photo of their 
shop with a number of Eurovans and Vanagons parked outside, leading me to 
believe that they also have Vanagon accessories. 

Anyway, I thought I'd pass along their contact info for anyone who is 
interested:

			Projecktzwo
			automobildesign gmbh
			industriestr. 9
			D-86919 Utting
			Germany
			Ph 08806 1471
			Fx 08806 2738

	(Check your local phone book for overseas dialing instructions.)
 
No commercial connection to projektzwo,
