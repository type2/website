&gt;    This actually works.  as a kid, I discovered on a winter campout
&gt;that by lighting the tips of my shoes on fire, it kept my feet plenty
&gt;warm.  the rubber burns slowly and radiates a lot of heat. needless
&gt;to say, my parents werent any too happy.  Reboks work best.

campouts!!! :)

proud to be a part of it. :)
