Subject: Van too high?

All right, this may seem petty, but I just got a new job that comes complete
with underground parking garage.  It would be really nice to park underground
and take the elevator directly to my floor rather than park outside and walk
all the way around the building.

The problem is (you guessed it) with an 85 Westy, my height is 6'8&quot;.  The
clearance of the garage (and lowest point...I measured) is 6'8&quot;.  When I
tried taking my van in (with a coworker watching), my roof vent was about to
just barely touch the ceiling when I stopped.  We are talking a need for an
inch drop here.

Other than replacing my almost new tires with shorter ones, does anyone have
any other ideas?  Anyone have experience with air adjusting shocks?
