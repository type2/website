Subject: Towing yer trailer

Let me say a public &quot;thank you&quot; to those folks who addressed my trailer 
question (they were all thanked individually already :-)

More input is welcome, too. If Kermit is gonna pull a ton of added weight 
over 12,000' Independence Pass (maybe we'll take the long way instead), 
he'll need it, and so will I!

Yikes, but we CAN do it-
Jeff
