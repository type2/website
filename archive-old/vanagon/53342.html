Blake,

Here's the info to subscribe to Camp Box News:

Send $10 (for one year) to:

Real nice guy, he advertises a lot in the swap section of NEATO too. I just
sent my money, haven't gotten a newsletter yet so I can't comment on the
content. But for $10, figure you can't lose.

Merry Christmas!

&gt; Where do I find this?
&gt; 
&gt; I was going thru some old messages yesterday (cleaning up) and I found a
&gt; reference to this publication.  Anyone have subscription info?
&gt; 
&gt; I seem to remember this had something to do with westy-only subjects and
&gt; points of interest?  Correct me if I'm wrong...

&gt; P.S.--- This month's issue of VW T***ds has a good listing of VW-relevant
&gt; websites (surprise, surprise!)  I was amazed.
