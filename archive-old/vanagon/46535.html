Oil cause a fire in my '57 pickup once, so I'll disagree with that part,
(although I think it is not the likely suspect, and since the oil leak
was known and you continued to drive...).  In my case, I had a leaky hose
from the remote oil filter spray oil from the oil pump area onto the
muffler, where it caught fire.  I, too, knew that I had a leak, but continued
to drive.  My installation had an electric (and remote) fuel pump which was
wired to the oil pressure switch (through some electonics I cobbled), 
alternator, etc., to cut all fuel flow to the engine in case of engine
trouble.  The first thing the fire melted was the oil pressure wire, and
everything shut down, as designed, before any fuel caught.

with a mechanical pump, I would have first burned through the fuel line and
sprayed the engine compartment (I also had installed flame-resistant fuel lines,
steel mostly, with aircraft hoses a flex points.

the oil alone melted many plastic parts from the engine -- wires, distributor
cap, etc., but I managed to get it out (fire extinguisher -- A/B -- always
carry one!).

I, too, feel your grief, but concur that it is not something likely to
be set at the feet of the engine builder, although I think that an oil leak
certainly *can* cause such things.  Other than main seal, main case joint
and oil pump, I would not expect them to be at fault for an oil leak.  Leaks
in valve covers, pushrod tubes, etc. are to easy to get in shipping and
installation (or just becasue it was a full moon), and *I* would not care
to call them to task for that class of leaks (I have problems getting the
these other places sealed as well, so *I* wouldn't feel free to complain
on anything short of a big gusher!).  If I ever do another Type 1 engine,
I'll probably get one of the o-ring conversions, BTW.

Glad nobody got hurt, sorry the bus is gone -- so's my truck (via a suicidal
deer).
