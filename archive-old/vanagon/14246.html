Subject:       Help my '67 again!

Well, brethren:

It was a pleasant morning, as I hopped into my old '67.  I had just 
attached the &quot;Buy Me!&quot; stickers I'd made to the windows, prior to 
starting her up.  It was rather brisk this morning, but the new 
(used) 1600cc Dual Port, I'd had put in started and idled like a 
champ.  (From a '72 bug.) I chuckled to myself as I saw the rear 
bumper laying in the back of the bus.  Yes, this new engine has 
little bug exhaust pipes, so I had to take off the bumper for now.

Since I don't have reverse, I put one leg out, and gave myself a 
push, to coast down the driveway.  

Off I went...to Salt Lake.  With my &gt;&gt;JUST CHANGED&lt;&lt; engine.

5 Miles.  Something smells sort of weird. 

10 miles.  The old generator light (left light) started coming on.  
Hmmm.  Very strange.  It grew brighter and brighter.  Ack.  What is 
going wrong?

I pulled over.  The belt is just fine.  Maybe the generator went out. 
This is different engine than my old trusty one.  

Start up, and keep going to SLC.  Running fine.

20 miles.  It's cutting out.  Getting worse.

21 miles.  Get off exit.  Limp to gas station on corner.  

Serious smoke coming from rear!  Ack.  Please don't catch on fire.  
Hop out.  The right heat exchanger has oil on it which is smoking.  
Maybe the head gasket is leaking?  I don't see drips coming from 
it.  It couldn't be leaking enough oil to generate this much smoke.  
Maybe it is oil on there from when they changed the engine?

Hop in.  Go to start up.  Turns over, but won't fire up.

Maybe the coil isn't getting enough juice to spark?  But it is 
turning over fine.  Probably not a problem.

Maybe not getting gas?  I don't know this engine very well...

Questions.  What do you think happend to me this morning.  (Besides 
from being upset, and late for class...)

Does this sound like the fuel pump gone, and the generator being a 
totally different problem?

Thanks for any advice, options!  I'm going to leave here in a few 
hours to see what I can do.  

- Mike

P.S.  Mike is &gt;&gt;NOT&lt;&lt; a real mechanic!
