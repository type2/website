&gt; one story i heard was that you could take the old one to a ford dealer and
&gt; get a new one there pretty cheap ... but the $*%&amp;# ford dealer here wants
&gt; to know which year/model/color/dealer-you-bought-it-from about the car it
&gt; came from. it might be worth a try in your area.

I just bought the Ford 3-wire for $65.  It is Bosch.  I will look up 
the part # at lunch today.
