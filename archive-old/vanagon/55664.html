Subject: Westy curtains, and rust hole...


Two questions, the first is about my camper curtains.  They are ripped in 
some places, and expell this brown dust.  I was wondering what the best 
way to clean them would be.  Probably too fragile to wash in a machine.  

I need to get two back curtains since they were gone when I bought the 
van.  I don't know whether to buy some(and where) or just make some with 
fabric.

Also, I have a rust hole on the floor board on the drivers side.  I was 
wondering if anyone knew how to patch it up.  It lets in a lot of cold 
air in the winter.  

Any suggestions would be great!  Rust holes really get at me.  But of 
course I have to live in Indiana where they spread salt all over the 
place! ;)
