i always heard it was:
AUDI - Awful Ugly Deutsche Ingineering
BMW - Breaks Monthly or Weekly
      Big Money &amp; Women
CADILLAC - Cause a Dumbass Idiot Likes Long-Ass Cars
FIAT - Fix it again, Tony
FORD - Fix or Repair, Daily
INTERNATIONAL HARVESTOR (IH) - Incredibly Horrible
MG - Mostly Garbage
PONTIAC - Poor Old Numbnuts Thinks it's a Cadillac
VW - Very Weak

anybody remember any others?

&gt;Does GM stand for anything ;-)

only if their lawyers tell 'em to. :)
