Subject:      macklow's accel problem

i did find one slightly related bulletin, and it made me think about my
rotor and distributor cap: i have to replace them about every 25,000 miles
or so, cause they get rather burned on the contacts inside. any chance
your dist. cap and rotor might be needing replacement?

here's the tech bulletin:
