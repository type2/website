&gt; Why does the list use the message poster in REPLY TO and not the list?  I
&gt; haven't seen any of my posts, and realized when compared to another list
&gt; I'm on, the REPLY TO should be the list, not each individual poster, as
&gt; vanagon stuff is!  

This has been annoying me also.  Several times I've sent messages to individuals instead 
of the list (as I was intending) because I hit my ReplyTo button.
