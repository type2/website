&gt; My idle stabilizer seems to have a hyperactive streak lately. The idle is

&gt; Thanks again for all the help!!!!!!!

Be certain to check the adjustment of the throttle switches
(specifically, the idle stop switch) prior to replacing your idle
stabilizer.  Additionally, this problem can be caused by a vacuum leak
and/or a defective idle stabilizer controller as well as an idle-air
bypass screw which is backed out too far.

Good luck.
