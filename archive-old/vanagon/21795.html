&gt;For all those wannasplitbussers:
&gt;
&gt;As seen today in the St. Paul Pioneer Press:
&gt;
&gt;1965 Deluxe Bus. Does not run. Many new parts.  $800/offer.  Call before
1p.m.  612-690-9294


I went out to see this bus.  It is at a VW repair shop on Excelsior Boulevard
in Hopkins, MN.  The biggest reason that it isn't running is that it has no
motor.  The body (sheetmetal) is in halfway decent shape, not TOO much rust,
does have some bondo in the back.  It is missing both windshields and 3 or
four left side windows.  The interior is pretty much gone, the only seats are
the front two.  He said that he was flexible on the price and he needs to be.

On the other hand I found a 1968 deluxe bus that had just been traded in to a
used car dealer between Shakopee and Chaska.  Someone drove it in from
California (she got it in a divorce settlement) and got tired of freezing in
the winter so she traded for a_CHEVETTE_!   This bus has almost no middle
seat.  It also has no rust that I could see.  It has a clock and the metal
sunroof.  They have the receipts for the rebuilt 1600 single port and
transmission.  The worst part of this on is the awful spatter paint job on
it.  The original was red and white.  I talked with the owner right after
they got it when&lt;at that time, it was not for sale, their mechanic bought it.
 It is now for sale for $1585.  I don't have the name and number of the lot
but can get them for those that are interested.
