Subject: List split and Vaction with Bertha
From: chawk_at_juno_dot_com (j g shepard)

Hey fellow listees,

Just got back from my 7-3=4 day vacation. It was slightly shortened by a
lousy hurricane. The only good thing about coming home early was
being able to get back on the list and get some more bus info. Much to
my dismay, lots of talk about splitting the list. I personaly don't
think this forum should be used to talk about what should and should not
be on the list (in which I am now guilty). One thing we all should agree
on is the fact  that all of our VW &quot;busses&quot; have the same roots, old or
new. We can all learn a thing or two from other peoples experiences
whether they are with aircooled or h20 cooled VW's. Separating the list
will only cheat us out of infomation we can all use. If i have to
subscribe to two lists I guess I will because I love air and watercooled
busses. Having more descriptive subject headings would probably help
everybody weed out the stuff they don't want to read. Just my opinions.
I feel much better now.
