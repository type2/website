Subject: Towing a Syncro


Hi all (especially Syncro owners. Derek Drew, Tim Smith - are you out there?)

I know the owners manual says that the only way to tow a Vanagon Syncro is on
a flat-bed truck or trailer so that none of the wheels is on the ground.
 It's especially important that neither pair of wheels is on the ground while
the other pair is not. 
How about towing a Syncro with ALL the wheels on the ground?  It seems to me
that this would be o different to the drivetrain than coasting with the
clutch in or the transmission in neutral.  Can anyone think of a reason that
this would be a problem?

Thanks in advance for your help.
