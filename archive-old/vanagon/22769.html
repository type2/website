Subject: Help wanted from UK listmembers...


I am in the process of building a library of T4 sales brochures...
so far I have US, Norway and German versions. Included are 
accessory brochures, Multivan, camper, Caravelle and Transporter
brochures.

When I go to France this January I figure I can grab some French
versions. However, I don't think I'm going to be going to the
UK anytime soon...so, is there anyone out there who has access
to their local UK VAG dealer who can get me an assortment of 
T4 brochures?

Let me know..and we can make arrangements.

Thanks.

Ric
