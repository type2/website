&gt;also for the sake of discussion, i beleive the samll pop up tops (the ones
&gt;that go straight up) were still available in euopre after 67. anyone know
&gt;better than i?

i've got some books and catalogs that show various companies offering that
small straight-up top on vanagons, so i guess they are still offering them
to whoever wants them. Country Homes Campers, in california, had a straight-
top, but it wasn't too small.
