Subject: Hydraulic lifters in type I, II or III's

Does anyone have any experience or direct contact with someone who has retro-
fitted their type 1, 2 or 3 engine with hydraulic lifters?  I have heard
both good and bad things about them and would like to hear from anyone with
real world experience.  

Do they hold their pressure after the engine is hot?  
After several thousand miles?  
Highest mileage on an engine?
Does anyone have them running dual valve springs?
Any running on high lift cams?
Any that have burnt the exhaust valves?
Are they really quieter?  
What special installation procedures are there?  
Any other information?  

Please, no suppliers, just regular people who have
them in their cars or know someone who does.

Thanks,
Eugene
