David,

Thanks for quick reponse.  Also heard from Joel Walker, who gave me a
nice procedure to follow on bleeding system.

The pedal goes down fairly easily 3/4 of the way and then there's a
little feel to it.  I've had this 85 since it was about 9 months old
and have never changed the fluid or done anything to it.  I'll try
bleeding it and putting in new fluid and see what happens.  It hasn't
really been cold here yet, but I know that &quot;O&quot; rings tend to shrink
and allow fluid to pass by when it gets cold out.

I wish I had found you guys several years ago.

Thanks for you response,

Ted
