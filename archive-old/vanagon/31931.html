Subject: new engine question

        I am considering purchasing an '83 Westy without an engine.   I
live in the Los Angeles area and am wondering how dependable these engines
are that many sell complete, for under $1000.  Has anyone experience with
these businesses?  If so, which engines and companies are reccomended?
TIA.

Mark
