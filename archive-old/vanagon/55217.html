&gt; Okay, I've searched the archives to no avail on this one, even though I
&gt; know something similar was asked sometime around Thanksgiving.
&gt; 
&gt; Started yesterday, battery and OXS lights are coming on together.
&gt; They'll stay on a while then go off and stay off a while.  Road
&gt; conditions (i.e. bumps) don't seem to affect it.  It was quite rainy
&gt; here the last couple of days.  Stormed real bad during the night before
&gt; this started and water got into a number of places it usually doesn't
&gt; (talking my house here--not the van!)  I was woken up in the middle of
&gt; the night by rain dripping from my ceiling onto my feet!  As such, I'm
&gt; thinking that maybe the wind was just right to get water behind my dash
&gt; somehow?  I think a couple of drops actually fell from the bottom of the
&gt; dash onto the floor while I was driving--reason for my suspicions.
&gt; 
&gt; If it was the rain, it's going to be a while before it dries up, since
&gt; it's kinda cold here now.  If it wasn't, I would appreciate any insight
&gt; ya'll can give me.  Seems like it has to be a short somewhere, just
&gt; don't know where.  Engine starts just fine, so I don't think anything is
&gt; really wrong with the battery or alternator and the belts look good, no
&gt; slipping.
&gt; 
&gt; Ideas?
&gt;

Tonya,

My OXS and Alt. lights come on together too when there isn't enough
voltage.  I found my problem was the alternator pully slipped. You might
just need to check your belt and your charging system in general.

I think it's just afreak thing that both lights go on when I found it to
be a charging problem.  Oxy Sensor was fine.
