Subject: RE: Extended Use Report  1983 Vanagon Camper 36,000 miles

I'm approaching 34,000 miles on my Eurovan, Westalia, camper and I can still 
say with pride, confidence, and no regrets, that I like my Eurovan; I'm glad to 
have it and it's something to have 'fun' with (still have not figured an appropriate 
'name' ... yet. :)

My experience with repair and malfunction has not been as described in the 
article; I have, however, noted significant variations on the gauges ( fuel indicator 
has gone from full to empty to half-full, based on the number and severity of 
bumps in the road).

Even though I've been VERY good about checking and maintaining tire pressure 
and rotating tires, one tire has much more, and uneven, wear than the other 
three (I posted a note about 'cupping' problem before). I've had both front- and 
rear-wheel alignment (this is not cheap, folks!).

Funny thng about alignment; one (I)  can't tell whether the dealer has done a 
good (or even reasonable)  job until you've driven away and accumulated several 
more-thousand miles. Then it's time for ANOTHER alignment AND tires. 
Anybody know an inexpensive way to get a second-opinion about the quality/need 
of alignment?

My experience with dealers (my original purchase source AND on-the-road 
referrals) allow me to believe that 'luck-of-the-draw' predominates. One dealer 
and/or one mechanic, at a dealer, may be more concerned/willing than another 
with no predictability. I've been fortunate with respect to my 'home' dealer!

Not being a mechanic, I have taken the Eurovan back to the dealer to have the 
periodic maintenance services performed. Even though it's an expense I realize I 
could avoid or decrease in other ways, I'm comfortable (at peace) with the 
arrangement; the dealer 'knows' my vehicle. In circumstances where a 
determination of 'fair-wear-and-tear' or possible excessive wear were obvious 
choices, the dealer has more than once opted for my benefit. Even while 
on-the-road, the home-dealer influenced another dealer to make repair, under 
warranty, when the second dealer was 'leaning' toward a charge to me.

SUMMATION: Knowing what I know NOW ... if I had the opportunity to 
purchase this Eurovan all over again, I'd still do it!!!
