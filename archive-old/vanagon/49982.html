Hey Ya'll

The PO of Lewis smoked (Cigarettes!)...damn those POs...and I've been
trying to get the bad smells out.  I recall a while back there was some
heated discussion on how to get the bad smells out of your rig,
specifically the seats. Following your advise I steam cleaned the seats
and removed/washed the carpets.  Now a couple of months later Lewis
smells like a combination of smoke and carpet cleaner.

How do you get the ALL the bad smells out, how do you clean the
headliner, how do I get rid of the carpet cleaner smell?

Smelly in Seattle!
