Subject: TIRES

OK,

I've read the Tire FAQ, but now I want all the BUS FOLKS opinions.

I have a 76 Westy and would like to get the correct tires for it.  
Right now it has passanger tires, but I am told that Light Truck or &quot;8 
ply&quot; tires are the correct ones.

Want to purchase good but reasonable not the $100 a piece I was just 
quoted for Bridgestone 185 r14's 8 ply.

Let me know what you all think out there.

Thanks for the help.

Joe
