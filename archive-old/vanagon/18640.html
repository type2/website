Subject:      vw parts in Quebec

saw this in rec.autos.vw and thought some of you might find it interesting
(or even useful):

 There's a  parts store in St-Laurent, Qc that sells performance parts
  and  add-ons for air and water cooled VW. Their prices are a tad on
  the expensive side, but I've gotten good deals on certain parts there.
  Also, they will get any part you need from the US or Germany.
  Here's the address.

       RMR Autosport
       2945 Diab, Ville St-Laurent
       Qc, Canada     H4S 1M1
       Phone (514) 339-5277
       Fax (514) 339-1066
