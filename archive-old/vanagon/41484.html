&gt;  I have to may have to replace the front wheel bearings on my 86' syncro.
&gt;I have some play in the wheel tire assembly when unweighted.  Checked for
&gt;loose nuts and balljoints. The play seems to be in the bearings.  I would
&gt;like to know of a good source for wheel bearings.  I would prefer not to use
&gt;the dealer for obvious reasons.

I can get aftermarket bearings.  I will get numbers and prices back to you by
Wednesday.
