  Just passing on some great deals that I've come across and thought 
that some may benifit!  

  These things are to Keep Vanagons rolling happy and &quot;Knock Free&quot;.  I 
know how much I Hated:( that noise in th AM when the Outer cv on the 
passenger side of my Vanagon would &quot;Knock&quot; for the first few miles until 
that old grease would heat up enough to quiet down the joint!
