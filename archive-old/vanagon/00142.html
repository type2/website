Now, I just HAPPEN to have my original users manual here for the '71 Bus.
It lists all the standard body types and pertinant data. From the
breakdown picture explaining the types, I get this list:
Station Wagon and Kombi: Same picture, Standard van with windows.
Campmobile: Station wagon with poptop and plastic roof rack.
Delivery Van: No windows
Pickup: No enclosed cargo area.
Double-cab Pickup: A kinda rear enclosed area, but mostly like a pickup.

	wagon     Kombi     Campmobile     Delivery Van     Pickup     Doublecab
weight  2888      2810         3228             2612         2689        2777
payload 1940      2150         1600             2370          2293       2205

Common data: Length: 174 inches
Width: 69.5 Inches
Ground Cleanace: 7.3 inches
Permissible Roof Weight: 220 Lbs connected to gutters
Permissible towing weight without brakes: 1100 lbs.
Maximum cruising speed: 68 mph
Climbing ability with full payload and good roads:
     1st gear: 27%
     2nd Gear: 13%
     3rd gear: 7%
     4th gear: 4%  (I dont think I can take a 4% grade in 4th gear anymore, empty)

Lots of other comparible facts, cpacities, etc.

Hope this pleases the specification nuts out there!
