Subject: Sorry and Back


Good people,

  Just a quick note to apologize for spamming with the subscribe sent to
to list rather than the server...  DOH!

  I am now in the Philly are (joel take note) and NuBus ('82 diesel)
and I are back on the list. Well, NuBus is a non-sentinent cetane
burner, so I guess she ain't on the list, but NuBus is certainly the
reason I am here...

 Diesel fuel is $1.01 in NJ...I was paying $1.27 in Upstate NY..
