Subject: Re: How  to remove torsion arms, bearings?

&gt;The first step on the agenda for my new 73 bus is removing and welding the
&gt;brackets on the front torsion tubes.
&gt;
&gt;Getting the front end out was been a little more complex than I
&gt;anticipated.  As someone else mentioned, taking these things apart is a
&gt;little like peeling an onion.  Fortunately - and suprisingly for a 20 year
&gt;old vehicle -  nothing was impossibly rusted.  To get the torsion tube
&gt;assembly out I had to disconnect the drag link to the steering arm, the
&gt;shift rod linkages, the clutch cable, the master cylinder and the wheel
&gt;calipers.  I also removed the rotors before dropping what remained of the
&gt;front end.  In any case, a lot of this stuff needed overhauling anyway.
&gt;For example, the shift rod busings are completely worn - the bus has that
&gt;'omnishift' feeling.
&gt;
&gt;So now the front axle is sitting on my workmate.  I have removed the tie
&gt;rod arms and 3 out of 4 ball joints.  The bolt on ball joint number 4 is
&gt;very stubborn - I have to find a longer pipe!  My bentley manual has not
&gt;yet arrived from JCW so I have a couple of questions for the experts:
&gt;
&gt;1.  How do I remove the sway bar?  The nuts came off OK, but the bolts are
&gt;intractable.
&gt;
&gt;2.  How do I remove the torsion arms, bars, and bearings.  Muir indicates
&gt;that the torsion arms should just slide out after loosening the set screws
&gt;in the center of the torsion tubes and on the torsion arms.  I did this and
&gt;(suprise!)  - no sliding.  Is it time for Mr. Sledge Hammer?  How about the
&gt;needle bearings - do I need a special extractor to get these out?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks for any and all replies.
