Subject: RE:extra gas

Chances are many of us have carried a gas can in a vehicle at one time or
another, but most of us did so in the full knowledge that it was unsafe. 
The older you get, the more fires you have seen, and you get more cautious.
 Probably the safest place to carry an extra gas can is in the luggage rack
of a vw camper.  There are still disadvantages to this, but it sure beats
carrying it inside the van.  I feel the same way about Coleman fuel-I get
nervous carrying it around inside the vehicle makes me nervous.
