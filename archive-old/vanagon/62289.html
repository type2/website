&lt;&lt;  Getting a 5 cylinder 2.5
 liter VW/Audi TDI from Europe is my dream for repowering a Vanagon &gt;&gt;

Anyone (besides Helmut, and that wasn't a turbo) ever try putting a Audi
turbo in a vanagon? I've got one avail to me for reeeal cheep but needs a
turbo ( I'm familiar with the beast, I drive a 5000 turbo daily)
So can you get everything from Kennedy, or do you have get it from VWSA??
