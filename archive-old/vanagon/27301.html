Subject: methyl hydrate/methanol/MTBE use
Date: Mon, 23 Oct 95 21:55:34 EDT

&gt; probably the most significant reason was that METHANOL was initially
&gt; used in the gasahol formulations.  methanol raises havoc with
&gt; certain types of rubber components in needle valves, vacuum
&gt; diaphragms, fuel pumps, etc.  methanol also contributes to fuel
&gt; system corrosion and is to be avoided at all costs in fuel injected
&gt; vehicles for this reason.

&gt; isopropyl, it can only practically be made at about %95 strength, the 
&gt; remaining 5% being water.  occasionally you can purchase pharmacy 
&gt; grade 95% isopropyl, it is marked such on the botttle.
&gt; 
&gt; -dan (not a chemist, don't play one at work, but can fake it on this 
&gt; list)
&gt; 

Dan is entirely correct on the methanol, recently the university has
taken up a project using direct injection of methanol into aircraft
engines as an alternative fuel conversion.  Really warped system, they
are injecting through one of the spark plugs in the 4 cyl continental in
an old Cesna 140 or 150.  Sadly this really pisses me off as the Cesna
which was a truly ancient bird (50's era) only had a few thousand hours
on her, and now the thing is destined to be an expermental piece of
trash the rest of its life.  Anyway a friend is on the project, and
dealing with the injection system corrosion is the primary problem.

On the topic of isopropyl based gas line antifreeze, actually I had
read that even the 95% pure stuff is already too saturated to
effectively pick up water, best stick to genuine gas line stuff, though
actually I have a couple of bottles of reagent grade isopropyl at 99.+%
pure dad used to get from AT&amp;T as cleaning solvent, stuff would probably
work wonderfully, they used to pay $20 per quart.
