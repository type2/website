Subject: Re: What do you wash your van with?


For washing, I'm not to choosey, but I've GOT to let you folks in on the 
greatest stuff for polish and shine.  Ask David Schwarze: he's always 
asking &quot;How do you keep your van so CLEAN?&quot;  I love telling him I only 
wash it every few months, and that every weekend I drive at least 80 - 
100km on dirt roads.  And he's right: it looks great!  How do I do it?  
That's because I use:

				AUTO-GLYM ! !

Yes, AUTO-GLYM (pronounced Auto Gleam. I think), super resin polish, the 
only car polish by Appointment to Her Royal Majesty the Queen Mother AND 
His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales.  Ever seen the Queen Mum's 
Daimler limo?  Now, THAT'S a good polish!  Thank AUTO-GLYM!

BTW, I'm not kidding about this.  I love the stuff, and it gives a finish 
so smooth dust has a hard time sticking to it.  I AUTO-GLYM the bus maybe 
twice a year.  It's one of those rub in, buff off types.  A 300 ml bottle 
is enough to do the entire bus twice, plus my winter car (a Hyun*ai P*ny) 
twice, PLUS about half of my brother-in-law's Suburb*n.  A bottle costs 
about $15.00 CDN (ouch!), but, hey, it goes a long way, and any paint 
oxidation just disappears.  I don't know if it's available in the USA.  
It's made in Letchworth, England.

Of course, YMMV, and all standard disclaimers apply.
