So Tim Smith says:
&gt; 
&gt;         Has anyone had a slow/intermittent failure of an ignition component 
&gt; that occurs after the engine/component has warmed up? ie some thermal 
&gt; problem with the electronics. Could this be my coil simply giving out? None 
&gt; of the ignition bits have ever been replaced since 1988, 7 years use. When 
&gt; the van is running there are no problems at all, it just suddenly looses its 
&gt; spark! TIA.   tim s.

I would suspect the spark plug wires, the coil, the battery and the battery
connections at both the battery end and the ground/starter/alternator ends.
Work that out.  Then go to the fuel system and check out the fuel pump and
all related components.
 
If that don't fix it, then it's time to look at the main computer.  It might
be get senile. ;)
