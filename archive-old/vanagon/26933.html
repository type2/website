Subject: Early bus owner's, anyone know were to get this part?

i am in need of a stearing lock set-up.  it is for my 1960 crew cab that 
i am finishing a full resto on.  i need it to be black, with the lock and 
stearing collum.  The key's and wire cover are also needed but not 
absolutly nessisary.  any help would be greatly apreciated.
