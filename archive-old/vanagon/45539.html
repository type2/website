Subject: vw bus owner wanna-be

i'm 35 years old and live in riverside, ca.  i grew up in so cal (escondido)
and have always dreamed of owning a light blue and white vw bus.  i'm now
ready, willing, and able to do it but would like some help from the experts.
 i'd like a '67 or earlier camper version with either no windows or 21
windows.  what year and model is considered the &quot;ultimate&quot;?  is it better to
buy a completely restored model or one that needs work and do it myself (can
this be expensive)?  what's the best way to go about buying one?  classified
ads?  vw car shows?  please bombard me with your replies because i'm anxious
to become a member of the exclusive vw bus culture.
