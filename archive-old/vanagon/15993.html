Subject: Rear cargo door seal for '71 bus


The seal around the rear cargo door (not the engine hatch) of my '71 bus
is pretty well shot. Replacements are around $70-$80 by mail order-- ouch!
Does anyone know of any workable substitutes? Need not be exact original,
as long as it keeps the door from rattling, keeps out rain, can be cut to
length, and stays in place, possibly with a little help from Silicone Sealer
or some such.

Anyone ever tried this? Any advice would be appreciated.

TIA,
