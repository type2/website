Gerald, I didn't see the copy of your reply, just the quote of my 
message. Did it get cut off?

&gt; 
&gt; I'm familiar with info. in the archives of this list to effect that an 
&gt; FTC situation has led to a &quot;secret warranty&quot; for certain engine/head 
&gt; repairs, especially within 50,000 miles of when vehicle was new.
&gt; 
&gt; I have a somewhat unique variation of this case. My heads were replaced 
&gt; two to three years ago, and after the accumulation of about 25,000 miles 
&gt; (heads replaced at 133k, now at 155k or so).
&gt; 
&gt; Would you think that a 100% reimbursement should be available due to the 
&gt; fact that head gaskets go out this soon after heads redone?
&gt; 
&gt; TIA
&gt;
