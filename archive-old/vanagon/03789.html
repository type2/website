Subject:  To those '83-'85 Vanagon folks




Hi, there,

This is only to those who own a Vanagon and/or camper of '83-'85 model years.

Would it be possible to share with me the following information by replying
directly to me?
    
       year,
       miles, and
       list of problems (for example, overheating, rattling hydraulic
                         lifters,, frequent brake pad replacement, etc.)

Thanks.

Regards,
James
'83 Vanagon
