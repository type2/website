Subject: low power in re-built 2.0 vanagon

 I'm looking for some assistance in finding what ails my beloved vanagon 1980
7-passenger. I've just had the engine re-built this summer past. My van has
less power than when it had cracks in the heads. By re-built I mean, new
heads, not rebuilt ones, and new pistons and cylinders. My air box was
adjusted, as well as my timing. But, my problem still persists. The van gets
to operating temperature, then gradually loses power, It is a daily driver so
cannot be witheld from duties very long. My wife has threatened to blow up my
favorite vehicle in the world! Please assist me with any recommendations,
short of getting rid of it! Thanks! jlopez69_at_aol_dot_com
