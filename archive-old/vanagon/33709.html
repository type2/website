&gt;That said, with all the buses burning to the ground, engine and electrical
&gt;problems I've read about, I'd like for list members to tell us why they
&gt;stay with VWs -- some more positive messages, for balance.

I also get the offroad list (you think *this* list has traffic??). If you
wre interested in four-wheel-drives and you subscribed to that list, you
would shortly surmise that the AMC 258 cid inline six was an absolutely
terrible engine.

In fact, in terms of economy and reliability and tolerance for abuse and
(especially) low-end torque, the Jeep I-6 is arguably the finest
water-cooled engine ever mass produced. But nobody says, &quot;my low-end torque
is very good every day.&quot; Instead, they say &quot;mine leaks from the valve
cover.&quot; Most of the I-6es do. &quot;My Carter carb can't deal with a 45 degree
incline. The Jeep stalled.&quot; They all do that. People talk about problems
because they're aggravating.

People talk about engine fires and such here because they are remarkable
and unusual and frustrating, not because they are endemic to the
Volkswagen. But still, the VW has its weaknesses. Every engineered system
has its weak points; you know the Vanagon's weak points because you've hung
out here (not wiring. Valves and heads.). The real question, once you've
identified the system's weaknesses, is this: are you strong where the
system is weak?

Can you deal with replacing heads? Hondas have lovely valve trains but they
pop expensive CV joints with alarming frequency. All cars have weaknesses,
and cars with fewer weaknesses are more expensive. Would you rather pay
more for the sake of less inconvenience, or keep the money because you deal
with mechanical challenges well? Find one that's weak where you're strong.

&gt;I had thought that a bus purchase would be fairly inexpensive (compared to
&gt;new vehicle prices!) and that it would take a steady flow of cash to
&gt;maintain -- but it was do-able. Now, I'm not so sure...

&lt;grin&gt; &quot;Nickeled and dimed to death&quot; is a phrase people use when they're
trying to justify dollaring themselves to death. It's *always* cheaper to
keep an old car running than to buy a new one. Always.

Take the $25K sticker price of that new van, carefully calculate the total
interest on the note, and add the steep comprehensive insurance. Taxes. If
you're smart, you'll also take that total and make a good-faith effort to
calculate the opportunity cost of depriving youself of that same money
because every dime spent one place is not spent somewhere else. And see if
you don't come awfully, fearfully close to (dig this):

Fifty thousand dollars. Maybe just forty thousand, if we shave and tap-dance.

If you apply yourself, you can get a serviceable Type II camper for $2500,
maybe less. Insure it for liability only. Now do the numbers; I figure you
can buy approximately fifteen '71 campers for what that new car would cost
you. I paid $250 for my '71. Got it from somebody who was sick of being
nickel-and-dimed to death--but at that rate, I could buy...let's see...160
VWs for the price of one new minivan. Or I could just buy the one, maintain
it, and not pay for the other 159. Not dollar myself to death.

Vanagons cost more, but the same equation applies.

&gt;4WD would be great, I thought, so why not a Syncro? Not so cheap, those.

Apples to apples, they're very cheap. With a lockable rear diff and viscous
couplings, the comparable vehicle is the Toyota FJ80. $20-25K, used.

I cant answer your questions about the per-mile cost of a water-cooled
because I won't have any truck with a Type IV, but you get the idea. I
actually don't drive a bus because of parsimony, I drive it because I adore
the _ethos_ behind its design; but your questions are economic in nature
and on economic terms I don't believe that the bus can be surpassed--if you
will maintain it.
