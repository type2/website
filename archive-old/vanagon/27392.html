&gt; Did Weekenders come in pop tops and non poptops?
Wolfsburgs came in pop top and no pop top.  I have a Wolfsburg Weekender. 
The Wolfsburg has a table and the bench folds down to a bed.  The
weekender adds the clothes closet, a 12v/110v fridge and a overhead
storage compartment in the rear.  oh yeah, a poptop with bed.
 
&gt; Is a Weekender a variation on the Westfalia?
My weekender conversion was completed by/at Westphalia.  
 
&gt; I thought I was getting somewhere, but it appears I'm helplessly confused.

&gt; aftermarket camper junk is the way to go???
