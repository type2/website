Subject: '73 westy with a bug engine

I found a '73 westy for sale (real cheap) with a blown bug engine.  The body
is excellent.  Is it bad to use the bengine in the newer bus?  I figure I could replace the blown engine with a rebuild and have great bus for under $1000.
Or is the bug engine not up to the task?  I've heard they have cooling
problems because the tin does not fit right.
