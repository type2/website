Subject: EV Winnebago Defrosting - LACK OF

Hi Gang:

Well, after 2000 km in my new EV Winnebago, I
am pained to tell the list that the heating
and defrosting is horrible.  We went skiing
yesterday (-20 C a.m., -14 C p.m.) and spent
the three hours of driving, scraper in hand,
just like the old beetles we had.

Funny the things you don't notice standing in
the showroom - there are NO heater ducts or
outlets in the rear!  All of the front vents,
even with the vaunted recirculating feature,
can barely keep the windshield and side windows
clear - and this with the fan on level 4!

The (measured) temperature at floor level in the 
rear was 0 C!  Talk about frozen feet!  And I
traded in a 1988 Wasserboxer for this - that thing could 
cook eggs with the rear heater core.

So this is a warning to anyone who might be
contemplating an EV Winnebago - if you live
in an area where the mercury dips, don't do it!
This thing is DANGEROUS!

P.S.  Please don't gloat - and no &quot;I told you so&quot;s.

Dan
