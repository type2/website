&gt;     Hi All,
&gt;
&gt;       Well I attempted to put to use all the good advice I got on how to
&gt;     pull (maybe hammer would be a better description) the drums off the
&gt;     '85 Vanagon.  However, I naively assumed it would be easy to get the
&gt;     wheels off--I could not remove even one of the lug nuts.   I have
&gt;     tried penetrating oil soaked over night, heat from a propane torch, &amp;
&gt;     a six point impact socket and 2 foot breaker bar.  None of these have
&gt;     even allowed me to get a slight turn out of any of the nuts.

A 2 footer?  Boy, you haven't even begun to get serious.  Get a 4 foot
piece of metal pipe to fit over the breaker bar (about a foots worth).  Now
you've got torque.  Mulitply your wieght by 5 and you know the torque
potential.  That nut will jump off from fright alone!

This is what they'll do in the shop anyway.  You won't believe how easy the
nut will turn with that kind of power applied to it.  It not only will get
the nut off but it will supply you with a feeling of victoy and power that
one rarely experiences!

good Luck


James
