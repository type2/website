Subject: Prestone

I realize this is probably redundant, but I can't find any reference
inany FAQs.  I just got another Vanagon and the guy told me he's been
using Prestone as he was certain it had no phosphates--Is this true--amI
worrying about major head damage for a good reason or just habitual
parnoia?

I checked it out at an auto parts store and Phosphates are not listed
(on all other brands they are listed) but there are some things that
could be
phosphates disguised--Again, I'm sorry if this is a redundant FAQ, but I
need to know.

Thanks,
Greg
