Subject: FS: 85 GL N. Cal.

It's time to part with my trusty 85.  I have been it's only owner for 12 years.  Now I have
to get a 4 wheeler for my wife to get to work in the winter time.  Anyway, what I have is an
85 GL with 169K with the  weekender seat. No AC.  It's in very nice condition as I have
carefully maintained her through the years.  Last November, I did a top end rebuild complete
with rebuilt RIMCO heads, new rings, complete gaskets and seals, clutch disc, throwout
bearing, phosphate free coolant and some other stuff.  I also did a recent dis-assembly of
the CV's with new grease and some new boots.  Also replaced front pads, changed brake fluid,
master cyl, and other routine maintenance items.  She has good rubber all around.  Three
UniRoyal Laredo light truck tires and one original Conti light truck tire.

Runs great; absolutely no leaks of any kind.

$4100
