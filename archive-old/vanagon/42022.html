Subject: Re:Good deal for '86 Synchro?

Rinaldo,

Nothing wrong with that deal, especially with the reman engine and no 
rust. 10K is enough miles to know that the fresh engine will hold up, 
though I would have a leak-down test done. I would also make sure that 
all four tires are identical in size, wear, make and model. Failure to 
run identical tires on a syncro can be a big problem.

If there is a pull switch and a green light arrangement located
centrally below the dash and at about gearshift knob level, it has
a locking rear differential. I think these were optional in '86,
then standard for the later Syncros. They are very valuable in
you plan to get yourself in tractionless situations like ice, snow
or mud. To check the diff lock function,  drive the car in a few 
slow turn in a parking lot with it off to get a feel for it, then turn 
it on, and drive in slow circles. You should feel a definite change: 
tires scuffing and it more steering force required. 

Have fun!
