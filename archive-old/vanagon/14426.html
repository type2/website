Subject: Re: inverted clay pot Q

OK, I'm going to venture a couple questions here cause I wasn't there (make
sense=BF).  Does the pot sit on the grill or do you remove the grill and let
the pot sit on the stove-top?  What size of pot are you guyz talking about?
What about the gases from the burning propane?  Please someone spell this
out for me...I need it! :-)
Thanks, bruce
