Kenneth:
BTDT. One trick I use is to pre-mix the anti-freeze and water before I
add it . Make it a  little stronger than the final solution you  want in
the system. That way the water you have left hiding in there will dilute
it to the proper strength. I use 50%.

&gt;18.5 quarts. &lt;snip&gt;  I added the new antifreeze and then the water.
&gt;But the system would not hold the last 4 quarts of water.   Does that
&gt;mean I have  4 Quart air buble in the system?  A little Joke.
