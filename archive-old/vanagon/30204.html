Subject: CA Smog Impact Avoidance(?)


  I'm thinking of transferring my CA registered '75 westy to a friend
in MA (needs MA plates for resident parking) while I'm off to Japan
for a year.  I'll most likely transfer the car back to me and mostly
it will be in CA.  Do I have to pay the smog impact fee when I go to
re-register it?  How about if I keep paying my CA registration but not
wear the plates?
