Dave,

Unless I did something wrong the valves shouldn't need adjusting for about
3,500 miles, the oil about the same.  

Of course, if the pizza has lots of anchovies I could always throw a rod :-)

The thing is, I've been gone too long.  If I sit and steer and keep my foot
in it I'll be home by this coming weekend, and my wife and I will be very
happy to see one another.  (I know; it's my soap and my its my body and I can
scrub it as fast as I want but if I go blind I'll NEVER get home!)

Given the distance and the machine, I'll probably RON somewhere in southern
Oregon, do it again in Modesto where I'd like to visit with my son -- I blew
threw there on my way up, told him I'd see him in a few days on my way back.
 He said he would keep the coffee hot. 

Is Tracy too far east for you?  I could do the I-5 bit south of Sacto, turn
off at Tracy for Modesto.  Tracy usta be a nice little place back when the
Altamont was still two lanes.  Don't know if it's practical for you to go
that far just to see a rolling wreck.  Even a pair of them :-)  I don't know
how far it is between Grant's Pass and Tracy, I think about eight hours in
Grendel (if you know the distance, please pass it along).  I don't think I'll
be setting any speed records.  Modesto is only a few miles east of there.

-Bob
