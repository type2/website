Subject: Wilma (what? with list of vehicles)

 Thanks for the advice. I spent 4 hours on the phone with the owner of the
Transporter. Very nice old fellow. He had more to say than his dear other
half. It does have rust at the bottom of 1 of the many doors. By many doors
I mean that the vehicle has cargo doors on both sides of the vehicle. I will
be checking it out today and will post my findings. Are double cargo doors
common? I have never seen a van with this setup. A set of doors behind the
passenger side, yes, but, not behind the driver's side.

 An ASCII dump of the database file revealed that it was VERY wide for the
screen , so, I think that it would be a better idea if I passed it along to
the master of the list and see what he can do about posting. The same would
happen in someone's web page; too wide. I'll take suggestions and not trying
to make people drool like me. I see my database and believe me, if I had all
the money in the world.....Can it be zipped and sent? It is just about 6K
but it would be word wrapped and a mess to see as a message in the list.
Right now there are about 45 vehicles listed and haven't had time to add
about 20 more. I'll be doing that this coming Monday :-( (sorry) since I
have military obligations this coming weekend :-). So, whatever the list
master decides, goes. Fair enough?
