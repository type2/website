Subject: ANNOUNCEMENT: Passat mailing list

Hi, Volks,

The Passat mailing list I promised a few days ago, is now up and
running. The list is dedicated to discussions about VW Passat of all
years and models. Non-Passat postings are ok as long as they are
related to Passat (say, something about VR6).

To subscribe, send a message to:

        majordomo_at_blaze.cs.jhu_dot_edu

with the body (subject is ignored):

subscribe passat
end

For a complete list of majordomo commands, send a line &quot;help&quot; in the
body of a message to majordomo. You can use multiple commands in one
message.

A complete description of the list follows:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; info passat
This list is dedicated to discussions about Volkswagen Passat of all
years and models.

Subscription is open, and messages are not moderated.

Archives of this list are not currently available.

There is currently no digest option.

------------------------------------
* Send all subscribe and unsubscribe messages to:

majordomo_at_blaze.cs.jhu_dot_edu

* Send submissions to the list to:

passat_at_blaze.cs.jhu_dot_edu
------------------------------------

Please do not post messages about other VWs, unless they are also
related to the Passat.

Rude or off-topic messages are not welcome, and abusers will be
unsubscribed.

If your e-mail address causes too many delivery problems, resulting in
error messages being sent to the list, the address may also be removed
from the list.

Please follow netiquette when using the list. You can find a
description of what netiquette is at:

http://www.revealed_dot_net/IRWeb/INM/netiquette.html#email

Here are some of the most important points, IMHO:

Keep your questions and comments relevant to the focus of the
discussion group.

Resist the temptation to &quot;flame&quot; others on the list.

Remember that these discussions are &quot;public&quot; and meant for
constructive exchanges. Treat the others on the list as you would want
them to treat you.

When posting a question to the discussion group, request that
responses be directed to you personally. Post a summary or answer to
your question to the group.

If you can respond to someone else's question, do so through
email. Twenty people answering the same question on a large list can
fill your mailbox (and those of everyone else on the list) quickly.

When replying to a message posted to a discussion group, check the
address to be certain it's going to the intended location (person or
group).

When signing up for a list, save your subscription confirmation letter
for reference.

Occasionally subscribers to the list who are not familiar with proper
netiquette will submit requests to SUBSCRIBE or UNSUBSCRIBE directly
to the list itself. Be tolerant of this activity, and possibly provide
some useful advice as opposed to being critical.

Be careful when using sarcasm and humor. Without face to face
communications your joke may be viewed as criticism.

When quoting another person, edit out whatever isn't directly
applicable to your reply. Including the entire article will annoy
those reading it.

Abbreviate when possible:

Examples:

  IMHO = in my humble/honest opinion
  FYI = for your information
  BTW = by the way
  Flame = antagonistic criticism
  :-) = happy face for humor
