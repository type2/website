&gt;Do you know if any conversions to V-6 power or any other type of engine
&gt;(excluding Porsche) have been done? If so, could you put me in touch with
&gt;the individual or company that has done so.
&gt;                          Tom Fitzpatrick
&gt;                          Okotoks, Albert, Canada
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;But for your Syncro, perhaps you could contact a race-car fabrication shop
&gt;that has experience with Volkswagens. For the right sum, they might be
&gt;interested in doing a one-off conversion.


Well, if it's printed in a magazine, it must be true.
Especially one that can't spell Alberta.    ;^)
