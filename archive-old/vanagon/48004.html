&gt;Thanks to those who replied to my earlier post.  All three replies 
&gt;mentioned the same thing.  I took off the vents, and looked at the 
&gt;drain hoses....both seemed to be unclogged at the ends.  So, what can I 
&gt;do next?  Is it possible that they're clogged at the point where they 
&gt;hook up to the water collecting tray?  I'm still having the problem.
&gt;It makes more sense to me that the clog is earlier in the hose than at 
&gt;the end, but maybe I'm not looking at it correctly.

Each clog I've seen has been at the end where the little duck-bill-like thing
prevents bugs and other stuff from crawling up into your A/C area.  It the
clog is further up the tube, I'd suggest doing a little roto-rooter job on
the tube with a bit of coat hanger wire and see if that unclogs the tube.

Good luck,
