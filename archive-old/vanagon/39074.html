Subject: Re: Vanagon theft deterent

 I have one of the most ingenious theft deterent ever invented by VW.  
The Covenant Diesel!  (place fan fare here)  No self respecting criminal 
would dare steal a diesel.

&gt;  I have just installed an effective theft deterent on my 84 Westfalia that
&gt; someone else might like to try. I have simply taken the gound wire from the
&gt; fuel pump over the fuel tank and into the cab and connected it to ground
&gt; via a switch hidden under the carpet.  All I have to do when I park is press
&gt; the hidden switch and the car is disabled.  Very unlikely that any thief will
&gt; have time to find out what I have done as there are no tell tail wires around
&gt; the ignition.  It took about 60 mins to install and cost about $3.00.  I am
&gt; thinking of fixing it up so that the horn comes on if you try and start the
&gt; van whithout flipping the switch...
