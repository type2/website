&gt;
&gt;Hey now,
&gt;        Ok, folks. Time for me to show my ignorance and let some of y'all
&gt;clue me in.
&gt;        I'm thinkin' about this long trip to Inuvik in the middle of the
&gt;hot summer, and I'm thinkin' about how nice it would be to have AC. Of
&gt;course, I don't want to run it off my poor little old DP1600, so I'm
&gt;thinking shore power. Maybe a window mount unit, or one of those RV units
&gt;that sit on top. The other idea is a small generator to power the dumb
&gt;thing. Maybe in that left hand corner of the engine compartment which is
&gt;empty at the moment.
&gt;        The most obvious drawback to this is the heat from the generator,
&gt;I'd probably want to somehow vent it to the outside rather than let my
&gt;engine draw cooling air from it.
&gt;        This is more theory than anything else, as I seriously doubt I'll
&gt;have the cash to do this, and am not even sure if I would do it given the
&gt;cash. But theories are fun to kick around. How big a generator would be
&gt;needed for this? Would it fit in that little space? How much gas would it
&gt;suck up? Any other comments? Have at it boys and girls...
&gt;
