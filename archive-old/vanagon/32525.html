Subject: Attn: Mr. Derek Drew : 4x4 Vanagon

Mr. Drew,

	My name is sudhir desai, and currently I have an '84 RWD Vanagon.
since it is getting old and decrepid, I was surfing the net to find some 
information on vanagons when I saw and read your article on your 4x4 
Vanagon Camper.  I was wondering if you could give me some informaiton 
about how I can purchase a new / relatively new 4x4 Vanagon.

				Thank you,
					sudhir desai
