Subject: Re: 1977 bus

	David,
	Well, sounds like a useful vehicle. Needs some work.
Look in the paper for 77s that need some work and price it accordingly.
	You say the exhaust studs are broken- all 8? 
	When I sold my 69 bus, it was a basket case, with the engine
out and in irrepairable pieces. I got $600 or $650 for it, in 1977, 
from a nice fellow with a wife and kid who needed a second car and
liked working on cars. My 77 Rabbit went to a 20 or 21 year old
guy who paid $650 for my 209,000 mile car with original paint and engine.
	Don't sell it to a single mother with a newborn and a 2 year
old. Some young person with some time or an older person with
some money is who you are looking for. Expect it will be customized.
Be prepared to be offered less than you are asking. When you tell people
about the bus, tell them what's good about it FIRST.

	Good luck!
	Bill
