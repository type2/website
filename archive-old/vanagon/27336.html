Southeast Bus-Nuts:

There will be an informal VVWCA/SOTO meeting in the Marietta/Woodstock,
GA area this Saturday at 1:00pm.  We will be meeting at Southern Tech
at 12:15pm to caravan to the meet.  Bruce Jones will show a video he
took at the Lotterman meet this past June in Germany.

We are having a Late Fall Campout at Stone Mountain State Park just
east of Atlanta, GA.  The dates for this one are November 4 &amp; 5.  So
come on out &amp; hang out with a bunch of old fossils at the biggest
exposed hunk of granite in the world.  Fun for the whole family!

The weekend after that we will be heading down to the Tampa, FL area
for the Bulli Brigade/Land O'Lakes Bug Jam.  Anyone want to hook up
and caravan down to this one?
