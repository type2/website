Subject:      Burningman '98?

Well, Burningman '97 has come and gone, and like last year, I regret not
going.  I don't wish to be left out again.

In the spirit of Burningman, I'd like to create a Bus Village for the '98
camp, complete with our own theme and art work.

Please email me if you're interested in this project and in attending
Burningman on Labor Day weekend, 1998.
