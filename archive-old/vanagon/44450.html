 Subject: 75 Bus Worth How much?

   I am considering to sell my 75 Bus with 68,742 original miles on it. I
  want to buy a better bug.
  Good points- It has a 95% rustfree body, 1.8 liter engine with a weber
  progressive(yeah I know), Newer clutch, clean semi-custom interior in good
  shape.  Frontend great shape. Great trans. engine with good compression.
  body is Very Solid. Newer tires with very low miles on them. the bus was
  owned most of its life by a VW mechanic so it was very well maintained.
  Bad points- Missing middle seat, No spare tire only spare rim. Sliding
  door window wont open( Its been sealed shut). Alternator light sometimes
  comes on for no apparent reason.
  I am wondering how much I should ask if I decide to sell.
  I live in chicago, I know Rustfree Busses are worth more here.
  I am selling it because I want a nicer beetle and I am not really a bus
  person.
