&gt; 
&gt; &gt;a) What type of material are the original panels made of and
&gt; &gt;   should I have even bothered with the pressboard crud?
&gt; &gt;   The rear is campered out in original wood paneling and I
&gt; &gt;   was wondering if the same stuff is supposed to go up front
&gt; &gt;   as well.
&gt; 
&gt; Pressboard, is that the same as hardboard or Masonite? This is the brown 
&gt; stuff that looks like compressed dung. It breaks if you try to bend it too 
&gt; much and is difficult to cut cleanly. The hot tip for splitty interior 
&gt; panels here is to use thin (like 3 or 4 mm) MDF (Medium Density Fibreboard). 
&gt; This really tough, easy to cut neatly, and can be sprayed to match the 
&gt; original panels. It's even water resistant for when your door windows leak!

Cool, thanks Andy.  The crap I've been working with has been a nightmare.
I'll be hunting down some MDF this weekend.

Do you happen to know what the original panels were made of/looked like?
