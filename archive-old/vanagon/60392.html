Subject: Wipers

We had an unusual occurance in Northern California today. Rain! Which lead me
to the discovery that I don't have a clue as to why I can't control my
wipers. ('88 Westie.)  Here is what works:

1st  position down - front wipers slow
1st  position up - front wipers slow
2nd position up - front wipers fast
Pull back - washer - front
push forward - washer rear

I can't seem to get the rear wiper to work, or any intermittent features.
Though at the down position, I do hear an occasional relay click.

Do I just have a dead relay somewhere?
