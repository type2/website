Subject: 3.0 Liter Subaru Six 


I've found out from an independent mechanic that the Subaru six
cylinder engines go through cylinder heads.  Sorry, I don't remember
the details but I'll ask a friend of mine that would know more and report
back tomorrow.  It may only be the smaller six and not the 3.0 liter they
use in the Subaru SVX.

Has anyone else heard if these engines go through heads  ??
