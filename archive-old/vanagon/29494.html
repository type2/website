&gt;a million and a quarter miles on it.  Of course, the motor and tranny have

uhhhhhhhhh....     you mean MY tranny and motor WON'T last a million miles??
oh, noooooooo .... :)   wonder if i can sue?? ;)

do you realize that the odometer would have clicked over TWELVE times for
that mileage (1.25 MegaMiles)??? that would begin to get a little bit
difficult to keep up with. :)

&gt;BTW,  any other interesting repair shop names anyone has seen?  They seem
&gt;wierder in the back woods,   Why be normal and call it Dave's VW?

well, my &quot;shop&quot; (non-commercial, of course) is know as
Half-Fast Shade-Tree Parts-Swappers, Ltd.

and there is a big shade tree out back. :)
