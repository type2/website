BMW produced a tiny coupe in the late '50s that was air-cooled. Those little 
guys were popular racing cars in that time - I've seen films. A guy in town 
had one parked in his driveway for over 10 years.  Last year I noticed it was 
replaced with a 320i.

not vw content, but german and air-cooled  &lt;shrug&gt;
