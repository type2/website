&gt; 
&gt; Those hoser Canadians have had Eurovan campers for YEARS??????
&gt; 
&gt; Grrrrrr.  Are they done by Westfalia, or somewhere in Canada?
&gt; 
	The units I saw in BC were Westphalia and the (2) negatives:

		Electrolux Top-Load Fridge only 120/12V- no gas option.

		Only (1) table and it's fixed ridgid in front of rear seat.

&gt; 
&gt; I suppose the Canadians have V6 Eurovans, too????
&gt; 
	I don't think so....

&gt; And colors other than white??????
&gt; 
	Yup, including that nasty 1960s blue/green!
