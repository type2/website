&gt;        Why does VW use lug bolts versus lugs &amp; nuts? Does it have anything

the only reason i can figure is based upon the cars that still use all bolts
instead of lugs/nuts: porsche and mercedes.

so i figure it has to be something to do with either the design of the disc
brakes (cause mercedes and porsche have discs on all four wheels) or else
it has to do with strength under stress ... and the mercedes/porsche drivers
would, on average, certainly qualify for putting the car under that. :) and
the front of the vanagons would undergo more stress on the wheel bolts than
the lug/nuts on the rear wheels (since it's a heavy car and most of the
momentum/weight shifts to the front axle under hard braking).

them's my theories, which have absolutely nothing to do with anything. :)

besides, i can't change it, so i have to live with it. i'd LOVE to have
disc brakes on the rear, if for no other reason than it's much easier to
change pads than it is shoes.
