Subject: The $900.'92 VW'Bus' (lucky or tall tale?)

Just talked to a mechanic acquaintence of mine who told me a story about a
recent deal. He said that he and his venture capitalist partner spotted a
local ad for a 1992 VW Bus, bad motor, must sell, $900. Call xxx-xxxx. 

'62?  No, '92 no typo.

His pal/business partner immediately screamed over to the proper location
and negotiated a price of $800. The partner never bothered to ask about what
the exact trouble was. They anticipated a motor rebuild. What do you want
for $800!! Both partners came back later to pick it up with Chevy and the
trailer etc. My friend finally asked what the ailment was. The recently
previous owner said that &quot;It just wouldn't run!&quot; PEPBOYS supposedly had
conducted a compression test and diagnosed it as having a hole in #3.
According to PEPBOYS the engine would cost thousands to rebuild. The couple
didn't want to pay it. Otherwise the bus was beautiful and low mileaged and
complete. Perfect. The original owner,(described as the typical fragile
older church goin' couple) had such bad feelings toward the VW that they
just didn't want to fool with it any more-wash their hands and walk away-
didn't want the stress and troubles.
According to the story, The two stopped to fill the tank of the Chevy
Suburban for the trek home. While the partner was pumping gas my friend was
checking out the new acquistion. There was no gas in the tank! Some fuel was
added and a gentle claw hammer was applied to the frozen fuel pump and it
kicked right over! Stereo, ice cold A/C, complete with all seats etc.
According to my friend it ran perfectly after a quick check over.
Accordingly, the bus provided a quick turn of $7000 profit. The money
partner felt so bad that he went back to the original seller and gave them
more money to clear his conscience. Hmmm... 

Rusty has two reactions with varying mind sets:
*1. Cool story, mega profit! yea! Bitchen deal! Excellent! I'm jealous, I
would kept it and driven it, Oh MAN!!! =) Business is business. Don't fall
in love with metal, turn,-turn,-turn, I guess I ought to quit looking at the
'67 and older only sections.

*2. If the bus really didn't need fixing and it bothered their conscience
that much why didn't they offer to fix the bus and just help the older
couple get on down the road. Did the couple really hate it that much? Were
they that niave to sell a vehicle for that amount. They must have known how
much they paid for it only 3-4 years ago. I love making a buck now and then
but I am sensitized watch out for the welfare children and older folks. 

This is either B.S. or a true Bus Story (B.S.) Although the acquaintence is
a definite salesman who could sell water to a drowning man, the source of
the story isn't inclined to exaggerate to me about stuff like this. He said
that he had never run across a deal like that before.
