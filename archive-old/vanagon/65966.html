&gt;|      On a recent trip to the UP of Michigan, my syncro started leaking
&gt;|      anti-freeze from the front end (spare tire). This has never happened
&gt;|      before.  Has anyone else had this problem???
&gt;|
&gt;|                 Condition: Syncro was climbing a 7% grade with rpm's at
&gt;|                            3200-3500 in 3rd gear sometimes 2nd (30-35mph)
&gt;|                            for approx. 2 miles.

        How bad a leak are we talking here? A drip could be caused by the
bleeder bolt not being tighten enough or the washer not making a good seal.
You should be able to see a line of dried residue snaking down to the bottom
of the radiator if this is the case. It could also be the hoses to the raditor
or to the front heater, the clamps may not be seated well and thus when the
hoses got hot and pressurized, some coolant was sneaking past the lip and
clamps. I had this happen when I put a set of 27x8.5R14 on the van - the
spare was rubbing against one of the tubes and the tension was pulling seemed
to allow one side of the clamp to ride a little more on to the lip on the
lower raditor tube....

        If you are leaking A LOT of colant, I don't have any experiences
that were similiar...
