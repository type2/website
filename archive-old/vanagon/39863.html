I went to a yard this weekend and got a propane stove (2 burner), that fits
perfectly in the space by the sink in my Westy, and the propane tank with
all the hardware, skid plates etc...for a whopping 7.00$! Yes that's right
7bucks! Do I need to install a vent above the stove? Or will the window
suffice?

Also if anyone's interested a 77 westy (non pop) has a complete air
conditioning system in it. Complete with compressor, mounting brackets for
it on the engine, all the hoses and the roof unit. The unit seemed to be
made specifically for the Bus, fit the interior roof line prefectly. If
anyone is interested let me know, it's located at Pick and Pull, in San
Jose Ca. If someone really wants it I can probably pull it and we can go
from there. Thanks alot!   Tom
