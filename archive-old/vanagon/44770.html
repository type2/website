&gt;I found the key to safe sliding is making sure you break the rear end
&gt;loose before the lean gets too radical.

&gt;Saner and Safer in Seattle...

As a 20 year old, I once chased a friend around his own turf in western
Pennsylvania in my '69 Loaf. He, being well aquainted with the roads, tried
hard to shake the &quot;squid&quot; following him. On one turn, which was blind, down
hill and right angled, I threw the bus over hard enough to gring something
on the underside against the ground. Oh, I had some sticky Toyo Z raidials
on the bus inhibiting sliding. After he saw the sparks, he slowed down
considerably, he said, to save my life. My motto: always make friend who
are smarter than you are!

I did roll a Karmann Ghia over once (actually twice) but that is another
story...
