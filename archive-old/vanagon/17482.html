&gt; I very much want to install swivel seats in my '73 Bus.  Is there a
&gt; particular seat that I could look for in a junk yard that would [possible
&gt; bolt down so I wouldn't have to do any welding?  Are there any other
&gt; possibilities that would work?  Also, how involved would it be to cut the
&gt; metal off behind the seat?  
&gt; 
&gt; If anyone has ever attempted this before or has any help to lend or light to
&gt; shed, please let me know.  I plan to get started either tomorrow of Suday if
&gt; possible as I'll be living in my bus on Monday and I want to get everything
&gt; set before then.

I can't help with a &quot;bolt in&quot; installation, but I just got done putting
some seats from a Porsche 924 into my 73, and lemme tell ya, they are the
cat's meow.  I had to cut some boards to mount the seats to, then bolted
the boards to the floor of the bus.  If you need details, search the
gopher archives for &quot;seats&quot;.  As for the metal behind the seat, your best
bet would be to rent one of those power cutting disc things, but you could
probably use frameless hacksaw also, if you have, oh, 8 hours to do it.  :)
