I have had several people highly recommend Rainers in the DC area as an 
outstanding VW mechanic, have heard he even owns a vanagon, but every 
time I've talked with him (first for engine replacement question, 
second for coolant replacement) he's basically told me I'd be wasting 
his time and my money by putting anything into a Vanagon, as the 
&quot;engine is going to start leaking coolant at 40k no matter what.&quot;   It 
wasn't what I wanted to hear, and he didn't sound too enthusiastic 
about accepting my business, even stating that special scheduling would 
have to be arranged because the Vanagons take up so much room in the 
shop.  So, I too need my coolant replaced, the local dealer will do a 
flush and fill for 150 dollars, expensive but possibly worth it for 
peace of mind.  However, I would also be interested in having an 
experienced listmember doing the coolant thing (and showing me how).  
How about a coolant changing party?  Line em up, flush em out.
