Subject:      me again ... Bosch Automotive Handbook

in that same new issue of European Car (no, i DON'T have anything better
to do at work!), is an ad for Robert Bentley, adverstising the 3rd edition
of Bosch Automotive Handbook. it's a whole bunch of really technical stuff
that is probably a lot more than you would ever want to know about autos
and their design and the math, physics, chemistry, and electronics involved.

i have the first edition and it is kinda neat to thumb through it ... it
has come in useful in deciphering what all those german 'terminal numbers'
mean: it has the DIN meanings for them (and the old style, like in the older
vw buses). for $30, it's kind of more of a shelf-sitter, but for you really
far-gone techies, it would be worth the money.

say you can't wait to spend your money!? 1-800-423-4595. :)
