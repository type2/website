Subject: Re: 87 water pump

Sorry,

I don't have AC and don't even know what the engine looks like with it
attached. I just remember the releived look on the mechanic's face when I told
him it didn't have AC.  He said he hated AC.

Sorry if I gave anyone a bum steer.

&gt; Gregg and Tonya,
&gt;
&gt; &quot;If you have AC it will cost a lot more because of the labor.&quot;
&gt;
&gt; I have AC and have done this job myself.  I don't remember any issue with the
AC being in the way of anything.
