&gt;How do I get this very popular catalog? Is it a subscription that
&gt;everyone has (monthly?). How can I find the latest one?

try this address/number:
JCW  J.C. Whitney &amp; Co.           (312) 431-6102 24 hrs, 7 days/week
     1917-19 Archer Avenue        (312) 431-5625 FAX
     P. O. Box 8410               Visa/MC/Discover/AMEX
     Chicago, IL  60680

or check with some local larger mall-type book stores (that have large
magazine selections) ... often the JCW catalogs are on sale there.
