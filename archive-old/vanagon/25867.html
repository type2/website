Subject: Helping Grendel


To All,

Since the start of my quick trip north and hair-ball idea for getting home
again on the cheap, all of which lead up to my present situation, I have been
sustained and encouraged by the supportive attitude of the Vanagon list
subscribers, many of whom have offered assistance, some of which I've
accepted.  

I've asked for and received specific help on things like computer problems
and parts that were difficult to obtain locally.  The point is, I'm not the
strong silent type; if I need help you'll hear me screaming.  

Harvey Chao has very kindly made an open offer of assistance, going so far as
to urge the entire list to do the same.  As much as I appreciate the thought
behind Harvey's offer it isn't needed -- at the moment.  I would rather keep
things as they are. Most of the problems I've encountered have been minor,
the kind you can resolve with a bit of sweat.  If I asked for help on the
little things I'm afraid it would use up my credit should I run into a real
ball-busters; I don't want to cry wolf.

One reason I've continued to post my daily progress was to maintain a certain
level of interest among the list to insure someone would be awake should I
shout for help.  If things go well I will know the condition of Grendel's
lame hoof by Tuesday.  I'll keep the list aware of my progress but I consider
you to be a resource too valuable to be abused by asking for help on little
things.  Besides, having gotten myself into this mess it seems only fair that
I get myself out of it without pestering everyone for help :-)

-Bob

PS -- I've no idea what happened to my last couple of posts.  A lot of the
punctuation and special characters came out in Martian.  Hope it wasn't too
confusing.  And I don't have a Leader, so I sent the little green men next
door.  (The longer I'm away from home, the stranger life becomes :-)
