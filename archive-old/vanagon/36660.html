Subject: vanagon oil buzzer &amp; light problem

I've got an '87 Vanagon that lights and buzzes its oil indicators until it 
warms up (which can be quite a long time this winter in the northeast.) 
Someone told me to use an original VW oil filter to solve the problem. This 
worked...for about one day. Any ideas???
