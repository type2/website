Subject: winners receive..


Will Self, obviously out of his right mind, wrote:

Winner gets a big hug from Martha, to be delivered during the Bricks
Across America tour.  (Completely Platonic, of course.)  (If Martha wins
she gets to hug everybody, even including old farts like me and Joel.)

To which Martha responds:

You're damn right it's gonna be platonic.  Also, I'll only hug people
over 60, and only if they wear two layers of flannel.  Thirdly, these
are going to be &quot;politically correct&quot; hugs, meaning:

     1.  Neither the hugger or the huggee shall initiate the hug.
     2.  Neither party shall hug longer or harder than the other.
     3.  There must be at least a 3-inch clearance between the
         two consenting huggers.
     4.  If any monies exchange hands for this prize, both parties
         shall receive equal compensation, regardless of the absence
         or presence of testosterone.
     5.  Offer is null and void in CA, and you may have other restrictions,
         which vary from state to state.  

dream on, you estrogen-impoverished pigs!!  :)
