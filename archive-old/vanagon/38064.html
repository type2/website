&gt;&gt;Also- since I am chief designer of the cabinets I am looking for 
&gt;&gt; suggestions on the ultimate layout and configuration. I would gladly 
&gt;&gt; listen to any advice about what you would add / subtract from your 
&gt;&gt; current setup. 

I've had '67 Euro, '71 ,'84 Westys, prefer the vanagon layout best. 
Everything down one side, doorway clear for carrying furniture.  The '67 
Euro was nice, rear bed was full width of van, spacious.  There was a fat 
closet, twice '71 width, right behind driver, opening rearwards, and 
'kitchen' unit was across. This was in a partitioned bus, no way to get to 
rear without going outside. That was the down side. My ideal would be 
Vanagon layout with fat closet behind driver.

Only way to do roof is with 5'x5' panels which are rarely available.  I use 
melamine faced (white/plastic) 1/8&quot; pressboard.  Flexes nicely up into 
position, sort of snaps against roof, but you need a GOOD cardboard template 
to get it right. Takes 3 4x8 sheets to do the roof, and you can get white 
panel joiner extrusions to tie edges together.  I use this for all VW 
panelling, cheap and easy to work with. Flexes better than ply, 
washable/scrubbable and BRIGHT WHITE for best interior feel.  Sorry, no wood 
grain.  Under the plastic woodgrain on the panelling of my '71 was quite a 
nice grained plywood.  Took a belt sander to clean it up, the just light 
stained/varathaned.  Go get some older panels and refurb!   Tim Smith
