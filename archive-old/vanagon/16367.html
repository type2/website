Subject: Maps?!?!


Sorry about the lack of VW content, but is there a standard format for maps
sorta like gif/jpeg for pictures, mpeg for sound/video, etc?  Is there an 
on-line repository of maps?  Is there any on-line map stuff at all, even gifs?

When you guys were talking about Red Rock and various other trips, I'd like to
follow you guys in spirit:-)  

...Markus
