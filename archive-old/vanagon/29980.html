Subject: Vanagon snow performance

Since this is my first winter with my Vanagon, I would like to know
what to expect as far as traction and the like when it starts to
snow.  I will buy some snow tires, so can I get away with only two
rears, or do I need all four tires to be stable?  I have been told
that the Vanagons are actually quite good in the snow.  Your
opinions?
