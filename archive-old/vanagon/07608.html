Subject: Re: I like grits

can't offer any commentary on grits or black eyed peas for that matter, but
i know of french canadian people up here who enjoy a thing called
&quot;poutine&quot;. &quot;Poutine&quot; is basically fries with gavy, cheddar cheese all
mushed together. It looks gross, and is fondly referrred to as the &quot;heart
attack special&quot;. If you have a plate of these and a large chocolate milk
you can almost feel your arteries harden!

BTW if you put plaster of paris (sp.?) in a dish with a bit of sweetener to
entice cockroaches, when the little devils ingest this stuff, the moisture
in their stomach will mix w/ the plaster of paris, and render them little
fossilized corpses!

&gt;Greeting fellow AirHeads,
&gt;
&gt;I'm usually just a lurker here, but feel I must speak up after seeing some
&gt;of you slam grits.
&gt;
&gt; Now every region has some unique foods that others don't understand:
&gt;Australia has Vegamite (can you say axle grease?)
&gt;I hear some yankees put mayo and/or gravy on french fries (Eeeuuuuu!)
&gt;
&gt;My girlfriend and I go out to breakfast every Sat. morning, and I always have
&gt;a whole-wheat biscuit, soysage (soybean sausage), yogurt-based gravy, and
&gt;CHEESE GRITS. Yummie!
&gt;
&gt;I've also heard that if you have problems with ants in the kitchen,
&gt;sprinkle some grits around- they eat them, the grits swell, ants go pop.
&gt;
