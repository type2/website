Subject: Slow throttle response on 90 Vanagon

Hello all

It's been a while but I have been watching the proceedings carefully. (so
I'm excused?)

My 90 Vanagon(145000km) has just started behaving strangely. At startoff
from cold the first takeoff is fine showing the usual burst of acceleration,
we have come to know and love, expected of the mighty wasserboxer.

But the second takeoff is VERY SLOW. eg Foot flat to the floor, .5sec lag,
car slowly accelerates from rest as if I was just feathering the go pedal.
At speed it seems OK (but who can really tell?).

I have checked the archives and I cant find any references, but I do
remember a posting about an &quot;air flap&quot; that needed lubricating. 

Am I on the right track, and how do I do it?

Thanks.

Scott Atkinson
