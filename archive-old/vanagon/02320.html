Subject: Re: Rear speaker mounts

&gt;both broken.  I've tried to buy more from my local dealer, but their
&gt;searches of microfiche and shelves add up to zilch...

My dealer had to order them but got them within 2 weeks, maybe you should 
try a different dealer.

&gt;really want to get them from the junkyard, because the same aging process
&gt;that apparently got both of mine would likely have been at work there,
&gt;too.

The &quot;aging process&quot; that killed mine was side impact.  This is a pretty 
thick plastic part and I bet if you can find one from a junk yard that has 
no visible cracks it will last a long time.
