Subject: Re: Gas Tank Sealer

This week I removed the gas tank in order to replace the sender ($33
CANADIAN from CIP in Vancouver).  The tank was a little rusty, especially
around the outlet so I took it into a radiator/gas tank reconditioning
specialist.  They slooshed out the inside of the tank, sandblasted the
outside, and then couted the outside with a thick layer of polyurethane.
The polyurethane is a two part mixture applied through heated guns, so it
would be hard to do at home.  The gas tank is guaranteed for as long as you
own the vehicle.  The plastic looks impenetrable, in fact I wondered about
painting the whole van, but it would probably weigh about 500 lbs and cost
a mint.

Reconditioning wasn't cheap ($150 CAN) but I can't stand the smell of
leaking gas, and getting  the tank out is  a pain in the ass, so I hope I
never have to again.

It might be worth getting one of these places to sloosh out the inside of
your tank, even if you don't get it coated - Then you don't have the hassle
of dispensing of nasty chemicals afterwards.


&gt;&gt; What is the name of that stuff you &quot;slosh&quot; a gas tank with?

&gt;A couple of good brands advertise in Hemmings Motor News, I would
&gt;try one of those, make sure you first clean with acid to VW specs
&gt;like listed in the older Bentley manuals.  Also important to let
&gt;dry correctly less you glue down a gas float (which you may not
&gt;have, I haven't followed the year) also make sure the product
&gt;resists alcohol and other additives.
