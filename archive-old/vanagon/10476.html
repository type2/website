&gt; Well gurus,  football season has ended, so I finally got outside and
&gt; pulled out the engine from my '71 Westy.  I have torn it down to the
&gt; point where the next step is splitting the case.
&gt;
&gt; I haven't noticed anything really obvious (to me, anyway) that is
&gt; broken, worn, melted, etc., except the following:
&gt;
&gt; 1)  a bent pushrod
Dave- I have tore down the engine from my '71 westy.  I have 2 bent
pushrods.  I can't be of much help here, but read on.
&gt; 2)  some slight scoring (I can see it, but can't feel it with my
&gt; fingernail) on one of the cylinders, which looks like the piston
&gt; skirt was rubbing (similar marks on the skirt as well).  Bentley
&gt; says this may happen with overheated motors (?).
&gt;
&gt; The oil pump looks ok, there is slight scoring on the cover, but
&gt; not enough to fill up the oil with metal shavings like I saw!
&gt;
&gt; What would cause a bent pushrod?  Only thing I can think of is
&gt; a stuck valve or something.  The heads are brand new, and I kept
&gt; the valves properly adjusted.
&gt;
&gt; Do I need to split the case (tell me I don't!!)?  I just don't
&gt; see how the pushrod could be connected with all the metal shavings
&gt; in the oil.  I *can* see how it may be the cause of all the noise
&gt; I heard, but I fear that it's just another unrelated problem.
I've been cleaning my case after it was linebored.  I have a homemade parts
washer and I still can't remove all the small metal chips.  I don't know how
one would get your case *really* clean without breaking the case.
Let us know.
