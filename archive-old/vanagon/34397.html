Exactly! BTW, back in my other life when I owned my '70 bus, I didn't do 
anything more than my own valve adjustment. Had an engine rebuilt by a VW 
shop and it lasted 20,000 miles. They did lots of VWs, but as I later 
realized, they cut corners. Not too many shops in the area, so even with 
20,000 mile engines, they got some repeat business. They could always 
blame it on something else.

They're still in business, btw, and there still is little competition in 
the area.

&gt; 
&gt; 	Well, I've got a line on another '71. &quot;10k on a rebuilt engine, CD
&gt; 	player....&quot;  blah, blah, blah....(I don't own any CD's, but I
&gt; 	guess I could borrow some)   Price- $3,700.00.

Sounds steep,  but I wouldn't rule it out. A '71 in top shape is a great 
vehicle! Then again, I've seen very few '68-'71 buses advertised for over 
$2500. I have to believe that some of these were in top shape...and that 
$1200 is a lot for a CD player 8) joe.
