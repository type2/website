Subject: Re: sunroof or vent for 83 westy

On Fri, 5 Apr 1996, Jim Miller asked about sun roofs or vents for
the vanagon pop-top. Delta Six Industries, Inc. (818) 760-4214 has
them, they're expensive, don't recall the cost but well over $200. 

The vanagon has a flat rectangular area about 12&quot; by 16&quot;, the vents
sold for mobile homes require a flat are about 14&quot; by 14&quot;, and can
be as cheap as $30. Has anybody been able to mount one of these on
the vanagon pop-top??? It would be a lot cheaper. Replacement parts
would also be less expensive.

Good Luck,
