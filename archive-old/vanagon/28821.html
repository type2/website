&gt; I will be buying a 65 Camper next saturday :), not sure if its a westy, and
&gt; its been sitting for 8 years at the bottom of a sunken driveway [basement
&gt; level garage, lower than street...].
&gt; 
&gt; What I am hoping is that someone out there can tell me where to attach the
&gt; chain that will be used to pull it out.  It is parked nose in.  The rear
&gt; bumper is loose and would not handle the load.  Cant get the engine door
&gt; open, car parked behind it slid into rear.  There are 14 inches on each side
&gt; to work with. I have never seen the underside of a 65 splittie and would be
&gt; most gratefull to anyone who can advise.
&gt; 

What ever you do, don't try tying a rope to the door handle. The door may 
open and the bus may sink...right there in the driveway. I have this 
information on good authority. 8)

Seriously, I can't think of a good connection point, but I was wondering 
if you might have any luck removing the bumpers. If you could, you might 
be able to attach a properly threaded eye bolt to each side and then 
attach two chains ... giving better control and less stress on a single 
point. If it were me, I'd bring a shovel and get under there to find the 
best points.

Good luck! Joe
