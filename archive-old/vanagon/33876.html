Subject: Re:  Neat web site... well kind of!

I saw this too, and liked it.  I sent him some mail defending us, and 
told him that we all realize that we drive slow vehicles and therefore 
stay out of the way.  In fact, the bus in his picture is in the right 
lane. 

I think it would be kind of funny if we all sent him mail stating that we 
deserve better treatment:)  Maybe 500 letters would have some impact?
