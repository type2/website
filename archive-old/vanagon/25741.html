&gt; &gt; Does anyone know the criteria that a vehicle must meet before it can be
&gt; &gt; registered as an antique?  Is it just 25 years old??
&gt;
&gt; In California, anything over 25 years old can be registered as a Historical
&gt; Vehicle (BTDTGTLP)
&gt;
&gt; I think 50 years will get you an Antique Vehicle plate. (10 more years for
&gt; the bus!)

I do know that in Utah (like anyone cares, right?), when you register
your car as an antique (I believe it is 40 years here), that you are
only allowed a certain number of miles per year to be able to
register it as such.

Might be the same elsewhere.......naaaa!  &lt;g&gt;
