Subject: OVERLOAD WEEK

To One and All:

I have designated this week Aug 21 thru Aug 25 as OVERLOAD WEEK.  Normally
there are two people in the office to answer 4 phone lines, which happens to
be myself and my right-hand Man Friday.  This week my Man Friday is on
vacation and I'm by myself to answer these multiple lines in addition to
pulling parts, packing/shipping and a host of other things we both share in
our daily tasks.  I love talking on the phone to Bus/Vanagon Owners about
their problems, what they need and taking their orders.  However this week,
if ya gotta call, please make it short and sweet or leave a message on the
machines which will be handling the overload on the phone lines.  We don't
have any fancy automated-voice answering system like Bus Stop or West Coast
Septic (ooooppppsss, I mean Metric), so please be patient and I'll get to ya
as quick as possible.  If you have FAX capabilities, this would be
preferable, as it would free me up for phone calls from folks who won't or
cannot get this E-Mail message.  Our FAX is (916) 244-0933 (24 Hours).
 E-Mail for Bus Boys is usually done here at my home, so any E-Mail this week
won't be looked at until evening (if I'm still alive that is).  I really do
appreciate all of your calls, questions, comments and orders and the list
support has been extremely welcomed.  When do I get my vacation?  Whatsa
vacation?
