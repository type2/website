&gt;Between Grants Pass, Ore., and the coast there is a very inviting 
&gt;road directly to the coast. Looks good on the map. From Gold Beach
&gt;to Galice is about 50 miles. The major highways take about 150 miles
&gt;to get the same place.

Anyone remember this song:

&quot;Me an' RJ an' the kids went on a campout in the Mountains, and we had
us one-o'-them U-drive-em army jeep cars which we had rented from a
fellow by the name of Kubowski for 30 bucks a day, buy your gas along
the way, take a rabbits foot, and leave a pint of blood for a deposit.

And he explained it all to us, how we was supposed to get to
Telluride, which was 50 miles away by way of the regular highway.
However, there was a shortcut, but unless you had drove the Black Bear
Road before, you'd better be off to stay in bed an' sleep late and pay
no attention to gettin there.

Well, we took up off'n the highway an' we come upon a sign.  It
says, `Black Bear Road--you don't have to be crazy to drive this
road but it helps'.... &quot;

C.W.McCall.  Later became known by his real name (I think), Chip
Davis, when he did all the Mannheim Steamroller albums that people
like around Christmas time...
