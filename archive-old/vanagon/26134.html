Subject: Re: KOMBI ON FIRE or A GOOD WAY TO CLEAN THE ENGINE?

This happened to Frau B. a few years ago, fortunately right after I started
the engine from cold, and the outdoor temp was about -10F, so no danger of
fire.  It's a hell of a mess, tho.  I now make a point of checking those
pups every few months.

&gt;&gt;&gt; The small outlet brass pipe or fitting going to a rubber fuel line to
&gt;&gt;&gt; the carburetor had popped out of the fuel pump. It is apparently just
&gt;&gt;&gt; a pressure fit.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I have heard of the same fittings falling out of the carb itself.  Anyone
&gt;&gt;have this problem?  Glad to here there was no fire.
